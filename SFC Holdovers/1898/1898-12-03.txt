The day was ushered in with the
booming of cannon and a grand revollle
sounded by the bugles of all the regi
ments of the garrison. The city was
gaily decorated with flags and the
streets were thronged with people
wearing black and yellow or ed and
white favors and jubilee medalr. The
Archduke attended a special thanks
giving service in the garrison church.
The distribution of jubilee medals to
the troops followed. Services were nlso
celebrated in other churches, commem
orative meetings were held in .he uni
versity schools and there was much re
joicing throughout the provinces.
Reports from ail provincial towns of
Austria show that the jubilee has been
faithfully observed, which is also the
case throughout Hungary, where the
day was celebrated as a general holi
day with "fetes, processions and illumi
nations this evening.
Emjtfwor Francis Joseph has received
congratulatory telegrams from most of
the crowned heads and at all the Eu
ropean capitals the jubilee has been
celebrated by embassadorial functions.
The illuminations to-night are superb.
They extend into the remotest suburbs
of Vienna, The effects at the Rathaus
and the Commemoration Church are
grand. The Emperor's bust or portrait
everywhere figures alone and not as
formerly, side by side with that of the
Empress Elizabeth. This gives a note
of sadness, which is heightened by the
decorum of demonstrations usually
noisy. Huge crowds are parading the
streets, but there is ho shouting and
very little cheering, the populace thus
Indicating its sympathy with the Em
peror's bereavement. -:: ; 'â ''/â :'â  â â 'â  : "\':

CONDOLING LETTERS
GREENSBURG, Pa., Dec. 2.â The following is a letter received
from Admiral Dewey by Mrs. Noss of Mount Pleasant, whose hus
band, Jesse Noss, was killed in the battle of Manila, Ji ly 31:
OLYMPIA, FLAGSHIP, MANILA, Oct. 23, 1898.
My Dear Mrs. Noss: I wish to express to you my deepest sympathy. It
must lessen your sorrow somewhat to know that your young: husband fell
fighting bravely for his countryâ the noblest death a man can know. From
the Olympia I watched the fight that fearful night and wondered how
many American homes would be saddened by the martyrdom suffered by
our brave men. and my sympathy went out to each and every one of them.
Your loss has been sadder than others, and I am unable to express the
sorrow I feel for you. Tears came to my eyes as I read the sad story of
the father who never saw his child and then the loss of all that was left to
the brave mother. It is hard sometimes to believe, but our heavenly
Father, in his infinite goodness, always does things for th? bert. and some
day father, mother and daugrmer will be joined, never to te parted.
With my tenderest sympathy, believe me your sincere friend,
GEORGE DEWEY.
The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Noss, who died, was named for Ad

NO HITCH IN
PEACE TREATY
PROCEEDINGS
Minor Negotiations in
Progress.
MAIN POINT UNAFFECTED
GERMANY'S SLY GAME TO AID
THE SPANIARDS.
Bidding for the Caroline Islands in
Order to Make the United
States Pay a Higher
Price.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.â lt can be
stated that no hitch has occurred in the
proceedings of the Peace Commission
at Paris, and an impression to the con
trary in certain quarters probably arose
through a misunderstanding of the
phase those proceedings have reached.
With the acquiescence by the Spanish
Commissioners in the American de
mands set out in the original protocol
I all danger of a failure to reach the
point of signature of a peace treaty
disappeared, and that such a treaty will
be forthcoming, covering at least all of
the protocol points, Is considered as
sured. What is now going on in Parii
is a negotiation respecting certain ob
jects which the United States Govern
ment seeks to accomplish in that man
ner instead of resorting to the more
usual but more tedious method of cor
respondence -between the two Govern
ments. These objects have been clearly
stated in general terms in the cable
dispatches from Paris, namely, the ac
quisition of one of the Caroline Islands ]
as a cable station and coaling station;
of certain rights to land cables on
Spanish possessions at other points; the
procurement of freedom of religious
worship in the Carolines, and the re
vival of certain treaties of trade and
commerce, etc.
But, as stated, these matters are
purely the subjects of diplomatic ne
gotiation, and do not in any way affect
the conclusion of th*> p ice treaty.
They might all fail to be realized, and
still the treaty would not be affected.
Moreover, while Spain was the subject
of peremptory demands in the case of
the protocol points, she is free of com
pulsion now, while these diplomatic ex
changes are in progress. She may sell
to the United States one of the Caro
line Islands, or may refuse to do so,
and, moreover, if we buy the islands it
must be at a price satisfactory to
Spain. She may sell the Caroline group
to Germany instead of the United
States if she can obtain a better price
from the former. There is good rea
son to assume the correctness of the re
port that Germany is. even now, bar
gaining for these islands. All the other
points covered by these negotiations
likewise are a matter for mutual ar
rangement and not of demand.
The statement that Spain has re
fused to sell us Ceuta, opposite Gibral
tar, for a coal and cable station is in
accurate; the United States Govern
ment has not made any such proposi
tion for the acquisition of that island
and would hesitate very long before
f?nt?r : ng uipon thÂ«v turNalent field of
actively Involved in the assumption of
territory In the neighborhood of the
Mediterranean.
The case is different respecting the
Carolines. The American naval experts
have urged very strongly that this
group as a whole be retained if possi
ble, and in addition that â¢ the Pelew
group, lying to the westward, be pur
chased. They have pointed out that the
southernmost island of the Ladrone
group, Waloa, lies only 300 miles north
of Ponape, in the Carolines, anfi the
Pelew Islands are only about 600 miles
distant from the Philippines. With
these the United States would have a
complete chain of islands located at
convenient distances more than half
way across the Pacific.
Moreover, the vast bulk of trade In
that quarter of the world passes di
rectly through the natural channel be
tween the Ladrones and the Carolines,
of which the United States would have
command. If Germany is able to out
bid the United States for these islands
she may obtain them, but. suspicion is
entertained that the naming of $2,000,
000 was inspired by a friendly desire
to get the best possible terms for
Spain from the United States hy rais
ing the price of the goods.
One of the pledges, which Is almost
as good as a treaty obligation in its
force even now, is that the United

States, in return for the releaife of the
political prisoners from Cuba and Por
to Rico, held by Spain, will secure the
release of the Spanish prisoners held
by Aguinaldo.
There has been an almost daily dis
patch from General Otis announcing
the arrival of a transport there loaded
with United States troops, and the War
Department is fairly confident of its
ability now to undertake the full con
trol of the islands with the assistance
of the naval contingent under Admiral
Dewey. It is realized that the task of
inducing Aguinaldo to surrender the
captives, for whom he has demanded
such an extravagant ransom â $1,500,000
â under penalty of cutting their throats
fs going to be a difficult one; but, after
all, the United States Commissioners
in Paris have only undertaken that the
United States Government shall use ita
best efforts to secure the release of the
prisoners; they have not pledged the
Government to perform the impossible.
AGUINALDO WILL ASSUME
A CONCILIATORY ATTITUDE
MANILA, Dec. 2.â Owing to the fact
that the result of the Paris conference
has long been anticipated here, th#
agreement of Spain to cede the Philip
pine Islands to the United States cre
ated no excitement. The Americans
made no demonstration, commercial
circles were relieved, the Spaniards
were indifferent, and some of the
American volunteers were disgusted at
the prospect of being detained here now
that the fighting is finished.
Aguinaldo is certain to assume a
conciliatory attitude, because his po
sition is daily becoming more unten
able. His rival Intriguers are becoming
uncontrollable, especially since funds
have run short and the outlying prov
inces have hecome disaffected. Al
though never much more than a figure
head, Aguinaldo has been consistently
temperate, and the authorities have no
reason to fear that he will depart from
this policy. Nevertheless, the native
newspapers continue to publish in
flammatory articles. The Republica
Filipina to-day publishes an article
headed "The Moment Has Arrived."
"When the conference terminated its
labors," says this paper, "the Filipinos
had already conquered all of the island
of Luzon and the adjacent islands, ex
cept the towns of Iloilo, Cebu, Layte
and Samarillo. Therefore, Spain has
(jeded authority which she did not pos
sess. The Filipinos will never consent
to the ignominy of being treated as
chattels. They will shed their blood in
torrents again before bowing to foreign
dominion, however light. America
brought the great chief Aguinaldo from
Hongkong and recognized our nation
ality by allowing our flag to be raised
at Corregidor Island o^d to sail the bay
in full sight of all the foreign fleets.
None dared to interefere. If America
now declines to openly acknowledge our
independence a great Injustice will be
committed. Had Spain asked $40,000,
000 for the islands, the Filipinos would
gladly have given twice that amount
or more to preserve their rights, ruth
lessly set aside by the enemy and the
nation without a true understanding
of the aspirations, rights and sacrifices
of those who have. stood torture enough
and who are left to fight and suffer in
defense, of â¢their country from new
slavery."
In conclusion the article affirms the
friendship of thfe Filipinos for Ameri
cans, insists that the Insurgents will
never fire the first shot, and adds that
the harmony existing will only be
broken by "priests or traitor inducing
the Americans to attack us."
NOVEL IMPERIAL POLICY
AN EMBARRASSING PROBLEM
LONDON, Dec. 3.â The Times, dis
cussing editorially this morning "the
strange and embarrassing problem fac
ing the United States that springs out
from their novel imperial policy," says:
"It is almost impossible to view the pol
icy disclosed in Secretary Alger's re
port as complete or even intelligible un
til it is known what the Washington
Government means to do for the navy.
If the Philippines are to be effectively
occupied a large navy and transport
power will be necessary. The United
States must show themselves ready to
repel any attempt on the part of other
powers to attack a position which, for
some time, can hardly be regarded as
secure, or to assert a claim to a share
in the spoils of disorganized con
quest."
W. F. HERRIN ATTEMPTS
TO DENY THE TRUTH
Entertaining Spectacle of the Southern
Pacific's Political Manager Trying to
Save His Own Scalp.
ffhen Trapped He Seeks by Falsehood and Equivocation to
Avert From His Own Head the Conse
quences of His Double
Dealing.
William F. Herrln Is chief counsel of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
and the head of Collis P. HunUngton's
political bureau. He is also a liar.
Many men occasionally disregard the
truth, but the fact is passed without
comment, as their words and acts con
cern only themselves, their immediate
friends or business associates. But
when a man resorts to falsehood for the
deliberate purpose of deluding the gen
eral public In a matter that vitally af
fects the welfare of the whole people,
it is the province of a newspaper to
proclaim the fact, bo that well-meaning
people may not be made to suffer.
Mr. Herrin has lied with regard to
his and the Southern Pacific Company's
support of Colonel Dan Burns as a can
didate for election to the United States
Senate. He has lied not only for a
mean and contemptible purpose, but he
haa lied for gain and lied because he
loves to lie. So much for Mr. Herrin's
veracity. Now for his motive and the
manner in which he has attempted to
deny the truth.
Shortly after the election i.ir. Herrin
went among his personal friends and
acquaintances exhibiting a typewritten
list which he called "the scalps I have
taken at this election." The names of
the San Francisco Examiner and James
G. Maguire headed the list. These were
followed by the names of about a dozen
d(tieated candidates, some of them Re
publicans.
The public Is now presented with the
spectacle of Mr. Herrin trying to hold
his own scalp on with both hands and
a lying tongue. He permitted himself
to be led into a trap by the proprietors
of The Call and the Chronicle and thus
revealed the secret workings of the po
litical bureau maintained by the giant
corporation by which he is employed.
The blunder is one that will never be
pardoned or condoned by the shrewd
and crafty old man who is the head and
brains of the great monopoly, and that
is why Mr. Herrin deserted his law
business yesterday and spent the day
in pouring typewritten excuses, denials
and falsehoods into the editorial and
local columns of the railroad's news
papers in this city. The spectacle was
one calculated to make the late W. W.
Stow turn over in his "rave.
In his efforts to maintain his hold on
the position that gives to him the pleas
ant duty of doling out the political
largess of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, the Market-street Railroad Com
pany and the Spring Valley Water
Company he has found it necessary to
deny that he made the statement, when
drawn into a trap by John D. Spreck
els and M. H. de Young, that D. M.
Burns and no one else was the rail
road's candidate for United States Sen
ator. Mr. Herrin did make the state
. â  â â 
ment, Bid was frankly told, in words
that could not be misconstrued, that
neither The Call nor the Clwonicle
would consent to support Burns for
Senator. The subsequent action of both
papers is sufficient refutation of Mr.
Herrin's equivocation.
In the typewritten statements Mr.
Herrin gave to the subsidized after
noon papers he states in one breath i
that his personal preference in the mat- !
ter of a Senatorial candidate is M. H. j
de Young and in another that it is D.
M. Burns. For the rest he attempts to
cover up with a flood of equivocations,
misstatements and falsehoods concern- |
ing minor matters the main fact that j
he did make the statement, when driven |
into a corner, that the Southern Pacific j
Company is for Dan Burns for Senator.
He makes bare reference to it at the
very end of his typewritten interview.
In the face of the facts that have
been printed will Mr. Herrin dare to
deny that he went to a prominent at
torney and requested him to use his
personal influence with M. H. de Young
in an effort to get De Young to come
out in favor of Burns for Senator? Will
Mr. Herrin deny that he went to a
prominent real estate man in this city
and sought to Induce him to get De
Young to name Burns for Senator?
Will Mr. Herrin deny that he solicited
these gentlemen at the time he was
trying to induce Mr. Spreckels and Mr.
de Young to name a Senatorial candi
date favorable to the interests of the
railroad company? He is hereby chal
lenged to make such a denial.
In what has been said in the fore
going concerning Mr. Herrin only in
cidental reference has been made to
Colonel D. M. Burns. To those who
have a curiosity to know what The Call
, thinks of Colonel Burns and hla candi
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
dacy reference Is made to the editorial
columns of this issue.
What other people think of Colonel
Burns, Mr. Herrin, the Southern Pa
cific Company and their combined at
tempt to steal the Senatorial toga for
use as a cover for their many sins Is set
forth in the following article copied
from the columns of the Oakland En
quirer of last evening:
It Is certain that the next Senator will
not be Mr. de Young, and it is- about
equally certain that he will not be Col
onel Burns. The tremendous artillery
fire of the Republican press settles that,
and when The Call and the Chronicle, the
two big battleships of the fleet, trained
their guns on the candidate from Mexico
it was all up with his chances. There are
circutnstances under which even the
Southern Pacific of Kentucky cannot
elect theÂ»person of its choice.
In other words, those members of the
Legislature who under different condi
tions might find their pleasure and their
profit in voting to send Colonel Burns to
the Senate will not do so under the con
ditions which actually exist. They might
like to befriend the man who has ren
dered them service, but they are not
ready to go through hades to do it. They
want to leave enough of the' bridges be
hinJ them so that after the session is
over they can venture to go home to their
constituents.
Even the most hardened of them have
not progressed beyond that stage where
in voting for a railroad seLection for Sen
ator thoy could say they dl<l r_ot think
they were doing it, and after to-day's
exposure to vote for Burns would be like
voting that the United States Senator
from California should be any attorney
whom the railroad might find it conveni
ent to detail from week to week to pro
ceed to Washington and attend to Sena
torial duties.
Not for years, If ever, did the political
side of the railroad get such a whack
as it received to-day in the exposure made
by The Call and the Chronicle. Every
body haa read the story oÂ£ Herrin's dis
comfiture, and everybody is laughing.
De Young found that Herrin was send
ing his (De Young's) friends to him to get
him to declare for Burns, and also that
the same offer to "name the next Sen
ator" had been made to J. D. Spreckels.
After that the two editors held a joint
session and sent for Herrin, who came
over to the Spreckels building on the trot.
This part of the story is told by De
Young with a good deal of humor. He
says:
"Herrin complied immediately with the
request, and was ushered into the room
where we were. He was so surprised and
taken aback that he leaned against # the
wall for support until he could recover '
himself.
"I asked Herrin how it was that he had
made practically the same proposition to
Mr. Spreckels and myself. He hemmed
and hawed, pulled out a cigar and stuck
the wrong end In his mouth, and finally
stammered out something about the de
lay that had been made in making a reply
to his proposition. I then asked him point
blank: 'Who is the railroad's candidate
for United States Sehator?' Hia reply
was:
" 'Colonel Dan Burns Is the railroad's
candidate.' "
It is said by the knowing ones that
while Mr. de Young tells the truth he does
not tell it all, and that one part of Mr.
Herrin's errand was to say that George
Crocker and the others had decided that
Mr. de Young could not be Senator, thig
i being the first notification Mr. de Young
had received that his aspirations were to
be blighted. Another interesting fact is
that Mr. Herrin. after he found he ha-
been trapped by the two editors, hastened
to get his story before the public first.
To do that he gave the Examiner an in
terview, which was printed Wednesday
morning. In this he represented the scene
as bÂ«ing quite different from the picture
painted by the two editors and intimated
that they both wanted to be Senator, or
at least to name the man, and that he
told them they could not elect a Senator
without votes.
Gossip now turns on the question who
will be the railroad's next candidate and
also to whose support Burns will go, for
it is taken for granted that hia own
chances have been smashed. Some be
lieve that Burns will eventually assist
Grant, although the railroad appears to
be opposed to the San Diego candidate.
But there are so many candidates in the
field, and the feeling excited is becoming
so rapidly embittered, that no quick solu
tion of the matter is generally looked for.
One of those trying struggles Ui which
a Legislature ballots without result day
after day may be the ill-flavored fruitage
which is In store for the State.

Likely to Go Even Farther and In

System.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Dec. 2.â The great fight be
tween the Northwestern railroad inter
est which has been agitating Wall
street has apparently been transferred
to the Pacific Northwest. WhUa th?
Northern Pacific and the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company are
building parallel lines up Clearwater
River in Idaho James J. Hill is making
ready to extend the Great Northern
Railway from Seattle to Tacoma and
Portland, a distance of 175 miles.
: Hill recently sold his Northern Pacific
stock and locked horns with J. Pierpont
Morgan for control of the Northwestern
railroad situation. He has tried to keep
the Northern Pacific out of Idaho ter
ritory claimed by the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company. Failing there
he is preparing to parallel the Northern
Pacific's line to Portland and obtain
a. share of the Puget Sound and Ore
gon business which the Northern P.i
cific.'hi.is. heretofore monopolized.
This move will greatly affect the
Southern Pacific's interests, since Hill
will either want to make close traffic
connection with that road or will push
southward into Southern Pacific terri
tory, which, in turn, might cause the
Southern Pacific to extend northward
to Puget Sound.
While here in 1592 Hill announced his
intention of building to Portland within
a year, but the business panic of 1893 I
caused a change in his plans* At that
time he. d-wned a half-interest in a lia'.f
built; railroad grade between Tacoma
â¢â and : Portland, constructed in IS9O by the
Union Pacific. The latter road aban
doned the plan of building to Tacoma
when.it went into the receiver's hands,
though:.it had expended over $500,000 on
this : grade. It was then that Hill
bought a half -interest in the grade.
Tax liens against portions of this
grade were" bought by speculators. Sev
eral months ago these speculators were
approached by Great Northern agent?,
with the result that all these tax liens
have been bought and all back taxes
Fettled in Pierce, Thurston, Lewis and
Cowlitz counties. These settlements
were made with drafts drawn on Judge
Burke, Western attorney for the Great
Northern. This is one of the several
things which cause railroad men to be
lieve that Hill's line south will be
started within a few months.
Early this year a strip of tide land
between here and Seattle was pur
chased from the State by men who are
-believed to have been acting for Hill, it
being his announced intention to build
a shore line between Seattle and Ta
coma. Colonel Frank Ross, a close
friend of Hill, has recently applied for
a franchise for a railroad (presumably
Hill's), which will enter Tacoma from
the north. Hill is undoubtedly prepar
ing to retaliate against the Northern
Pacific by paralleling its line to Port
land, at the same time obtaining an en
trance into the Oregon metropolis be
fore the Union Pacific shuts off his
present entrance into Portland over the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Com-;
pa.ny's road from Spokane.

SPAIN WILL NOT CEDE -
THE ISLAND OF UALAN
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Dispatches were received at
the State Department to-day from
Judge Day showing that but little sat-
' isfactory progress had been made at
the meeting of the Peace Commission
ta-day. These dispatches were read
at the Cabinet meeting by Mr. Hay
and were commented upon by the offi
cials. There is reason to believe that
the authorities are satisfied that Spain
will not grant the request made through
the American Commissioners to cede
the island of Ualan to this Government
for certain considerations, and it is not
intended there shall be any extended
negotiations on the subject. The au
thorities are also satisfied that Spain
intends to sell the entire group to Ger
many, and they would not be surprised
If active negotiations on the subject
were now in progress.
Before su.ch negotiations were begun,
however, Berlin asked the United States
what its policy was with respect to far
eastern islands, and announced that if
It would not be objectionable to this
Government nor be considered as inim
ical to its interests it would like
to negotiate with Spain for the pur
chase of the group.
This Government can have no objec
tions to such action. If it could obtain
possession of Ualan Island as a coal
and naval station it would be glad to
do so, but as this island is not men
tioned in the peace protocol, and as the
American representatives are bound by
the provisions of _ this instrument, no
demand can be made on Spain, and she
is at perfect liberty to sell the island
or dccMne to do so.
NO WARRANT ISSUED
FOR GOVERNOR TANNER
When the Illinois Executive Is
Wanted for Trial He Will
appear Voluntarily.
CARLINVILLE, 111.. Dec. 2.â The ex
citement over the findings of the Vlrdon
Grand Jury is somewhat abated, l^jal
processes have been instituted against
all the parties indicted for participation
in the riot, except Governor Tanner.
State's Attorney Vaughn stated this
evening that no bench warrant would be
issued for Governor Tanner, at least not
for the present. He stated as his opin
ion that when the executive was wanted
for trial he would appear voluntarily.
This would be decided by mutual agree
ment.
The State's Attorney further said he had
not recommended the executive indict
ment, nor had he advised against it. As
to his plan of procedure he had not de
cided.
Whether Manager Lukins would be
asked to come to Carlinville and give
bonds, he refused" to say. There is no
doubt that the prosecution of all but the
Governor will be vigorous. But as to
whether the case against the Governor
will be pushed or not the State's repre
sentative utterly refused to make a
statement.

Special Dispatch* to The Call,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.â The annual
report of Secretary Alger is a practic
ally complete official history of the
Spanish-American war. The Secretary
has given to the public not only all the
official dispatches that passed directly
between his own office and commanding
officers in the field and camps, but has
supplemented these with short explan
atory notes setting forth the reasons
for various movements, and then, to
complete the record of events, he has
included in the body of his report the
report of General Miles, of all the gen
erals who participated in the campaign
in Cuba, Porto Rico or the Philippines,
and, finally, the reports of all the bu
reau officers of the Wqj Department.
Nowhese is there shown a disposition
to criticize, the official dispatches be
ing allowed to tell their own story,
and generally the Secretary finds much
to praise and cause for sincere congrat
ulations in the results obtained.
The report proper begins with what
may be described as a chronological
history of the war, consisting of a
number of short paragraphs beginning
with the declaration of war on April 21,
and setting forth the date upon which
any event of importance occurred, but
making no comment whatever upon tte
facts. The only exception to this rule
is in reference to the casualties of San
tiago. Some criticism had been made
that there was a lack of surgeons pres
ent. The report states that there were
140 surgeons in attendance, and that
of 1431 wounded only thirteen died of
their wounds.
The Secretary, coming down in his
history to the middle of August, when
an order was. issued, which is now in
execution, to muster out 100,000 volun
teers, says:
Thus an army of r.bout 230,000 volunteers
and recruits for the regulars was called
Into existence from civil life, and includ
ing the regular army, the total force was
274,717 men. It was organized, armed and
equipped (no supplies being on hand
other than those lor the regulars, save
Springfield muskets), and 50,000 men of
this force were transported by land and
sea to battlefields in the tropics, 10,000
miles apart, where they won their victo
ries without a single defeat and all within
the period of 113 days from the declara
tion of war to thÂ« sipnirtg of the protocol.
This great achievement can be credited
to no individual; it bHonsrs to the nation.
It was accomplished through the intelli
gence and patriotism of all who served,
From the commander in chief to the pri
vate in the ranks. It also sneaks volumes
for the prompt, patriotic and intelligent
assistance of the people who furnished,
in so short a period, the supplies neces
sary, to prepare this great array for the
field. To the heroic men who served in
distant. lands the country will ever offer
a true irioed of prai c; but the mighty
army in camp, ready and eager to take
the field, should also be given equal
credit. It was their presence, ready at
an hour's notice for any emergency, that
overawed the enemy and proved to him
that further resistance, would be in vain.
The deaths in the army from May 1 to
October 1. including killed, died -' wounds
and of disease, were 2910, the smallest
death rate recorded of any army In nis
torv, a remarkable fact when it is con
sidered that ovÂ«r BOajOO of our troops,
born and reared In the temperate zone,
were campaigning in tropical c.imates,
subject to rain and heat almost unprece
dented. â¢' .
The Secretary says of the volunteers
that to furlough them in winter would
be a hardship, so he recommends that
in lieu of the furlough the officers and
men be given two months' pay at the
time of their discharge, thus admitting
of their prompt discharge in their pres
ent camps in the South. Under the
head of increase in the permanent es
tablishment the Secretary says:
In view of the needs of a military force
in the islands occupied by the United
States it is earnestly recommended that
the regular army be permanently in r
creased to 190,000 men and the requisite
officers; that a portion of this army be
recruited from the inhabitants of thoso
islands, to be mustered into the service
of the United States, commanded by offi
cers of our army, discretion, however, to
be given the President to make appoint
ments of officers from the force* so re
cruited. â  â¢
Secretary Alger thinks that the Gov
ernment will be greatly taxed to sup
ply food to the destitute, especially in
Cuba. a. he effort should be made, he
thinks, to give the people work instead
of allowing them to dwell in idleness,
living upon charity. He says:
Would it not be wise economy for the
â Government of the United States to con
struct a substantial railroad, practically
the whole length of the island of Cuba,
with branch roads to the leading cities on
the coast? Such a road would, of course,
Cost a large sum, perhaps â $20,000,000; but it
would give employment to the people of
Cuba, teach them habits of industry, be
an inducement for them to cultivate' their
farms and thus .furnish supplies for the
laborers' and for market when the road is
constructed. This, in my judgment, is ab
solutely essential to the pacification and
development of that great island. The
road would be a good property, and when
it has served its purpose could be sold for
its cost. If such an improvement is not
made the Government will, no doubt, ex
pend fully that much in charity. .
At this point the Secretary Includes
reports of General Miles and all the
other generals w.ho participated in ac
tive operations. He then takes up the
telegraphic and other correspondence
relating to the war, and that matter
occupies more than a fourth of he
Secretary's whole report. That portion
devoted to the telegraphic correspond
ence of the. war closes with a few dis
patches Indicating the finish of the San
tiago campaign.
Next follow a number of reports of
various officers and officials to the Sec
retary of War,, some of which are in
dorsed by the Secretary. Of the mili
tary, academy, for instance, he indorses
the recommendation for an increase of
the number of cadets by twenty an
nually to be appointed by the President
and/one by each Senator to supply the
officers needed for the army of the fu
ture.
Of the adjutant general's recommen
dations the Secretary says they are
judicious- and merit the favorable con
sideration of Congress. Instead of in
crease of pay for officers serving in the
West Indies and Philippines to the next
higher grade, as recommended by the
adjutant general, the Secretary thinks
that the pay of those officers, as well
as those in Alaska, should be increased
50 per cent while they are so serving,
because of the additional expense they
are put to. He says the question of
navment for damages to farms and
HALE'S OPPOSITION
TO PEACE TREATY
Th)e Seoator Fron) MaiQe Speaks
AgaiQst the Acquisition of
the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.â Senator Eugene Hale of Maine to-day
announced his opposition to the peace traaty which is being formu
lated in Paris. He is opposed to the acquisition of the Philippines,
and his antagonism to the treaty will be based upon that section
of the treaty which deals with the Philippine question.
"The negotiation of the treaty, unfortunate as it is," said the
Senator to-day, "by no- means insures the actual annexation of the
Philippine Islands. It is uncertain when the treaty will be signed or
when it will be submitted to the Senate, and still more uncertain
whether it will ever be ratified. The responsibility Is so vast and the
solicitude of the public is so great that ample time will be given to
its discussion and to getting the real facts before the American people.
"Many things will be found out which are not now known, and the
evils of the proposed annexation will so grow upon the public mind,
and upon Congress, and upon the President, that it Is by no means
unlikely that within six months or a year everybody, instead of being
for annexation of the islands, will want to be rid of them.
"The people of the United States will find out that the commerce
of the Philippines is very limited in extent; that they are inhabited by
a people l whose habits and wants forbid an increase of trade, and that
under the scheme of annexation presented to us this trade is to be
shared equally with Spain and all other competing nations. What is
called the 'open-door' policy cuts down the interest of the United
States in the Philippine trade to a point where it makes no figure in
our commerce. The entire trade of the islands, if we had it allâ not
the profit derived from it, but the whole amount of tradeâ will not in
any year pay the expenses of the army and the navy that the United
States will be obliged to maintain there."
other property by movement of troops
will be made the subject of a special
communication to Congress. He recom
mends that $30 instead of $10 should be
allowed for the apprehension of a de
serter.
In the subsistence department the
Secretary finds an urgent need for a
regimental commissary, and also for a
commissary sergeant for each regi
ment.
Discussing the surgeon general's re
port ho says it was a mistake to de
tail regimental surgeons to large hos
pitals, but this could not have been
avoided and division and general hos-
I pitals, which were Indispensable, main
| tamed. Ample provision should be
j made to supply the places of surgeons
i who fall sick. One of the great mercies
!of the campaign were the women
nurses. The report says that until one
has had experience or has made careful
observation he cannot realize the work
that these noble women did for our sick
soldiers in the hospitals; but they can
not be well employed at regimental hos
pitals in a campaign. Both the divi
sion and general hospitals are abso
lutely necessary, in the opinion of tae
Secretary, but the general hospital
should be provided with separate wa-.ls
for each regiment, so that comrades
could be kept together.
The Secretary says the Red Cams
and other relief associations contrib
uted in a very large degree to the
care and comforts of our sick soldiers
and should receive the. grateful thanks
of the nation: The Secretary calls at
tention to Surgeon-General Sternberg's
circular of instructions to the army, is
sued April 25, and says had it been
strictly followed less sickness would
have resulted. He feels that a force of
practical engineers, skilled in elec
tricity, should be provided, and that a
large number of engineers should be
educated at West Point, so that an
officer can be placed permanently w r ith
each river and harbor project. These
projects should also receive the recom
mendation of a board of skilled en
gineers before appropriations are made
for them.
The manufacture of the Krag-Jor
gensen, or a similar magazine gun,
should continue until we have, at an
early date, at least 500,000 of these arms
in our arsenals, with a full supply of
ammunition.
NURSED THE WOUNDED
ON THE BATTLEFIELD
Passing of Mrs. Elizabeth Howe, a
Heroine of the War of the
Rebellion.
POMONA.' Dec. 2/â Mrs. Elizabeth
Howe, for twelve years a resident â  of
Pomona, who died to-day in Phoenix,
Arizona, was one of the founders of the
Woman's Relief Corps of America., a
part of the Grand Army of the Republic.
She had a national reputation among
war veterans and represented California
many times in National Encampments
of the Grand Army of the Republic and
Woman's Relief Corps.
Mrs. Howe was the widow of General
James A. Howe, who was. on the staff of
Qenerals Logan and Sherman, and she
probably saw more of the horrors of
warfare in the Mississippi Valley
campaign under Grant and Sherman
than . any other woman. She â  was
with her husband, at Shiloh. in
April, 1562, and she was the
only woman who helped in the care
of wounded soldiers while amputations
were progressing. She cheered and com
forted the dying soldiers at Shiloh for a
fortnight after the battle. From that lo
cality she and her husband wont with
Grant's army through the wonderful
campaign to open the Mississippi River.
She saw seven battles in five months.
She was in camp about the trenches at
Vlcksburg, and the stories she told of
the horrors and pathos she saw there
daily while the Union artillery besieged
Vicksburg were always thrilling. She
rode with the Union army when it finally
entered the surrendered city.
Among Mrs. Howe's treasures were let
ters of thanks from President Lincoln
and many friendly letters from
Generals Grant, Logan. Sherman
and Sheridan. The remains will be
buried at Kewanee, Illinois.

SUPREME COURT
SITS AT SANTIAGO
General Wood Opens the
Proceedings.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE REPLIES
RECOGNIZES UNITED STATES AS
SUPREME POWER.
Newspapers Declare the Judges Will
Be Able U) Show That the Cu
bans Are Capable of Good
Government.
Bceclal Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Dec. 2.â The
opening of the recently reorganized Su
preme Court this morning was an im
pressive ceremony. Chief Justice Eche
verria and the Associate Justices, prior
to the opening, called at the palace,
where they were received by General
Wood, after which, with General Wood
and his aids, Robert Porter and others,
they were driven to the Supreme Court
chamber. Here the Judges donned their
robes of office, lortt silk gowns, trim
med with white lace, and accompanied
by the attorneys practicing in the
co-urt, who were similarly dressed,
formed in procession and passed into
the courtroom, the Chief Justice es
corting General Wood.
The procession having divided into
semicircles General Wood, in a few
tactful and forceful words, opened the
proceedings, delivering the court, in the
name of the United States Government,
to the Chief Justice and his associates,
and demanding from the public implicit
obedience to the court's decisions and
decrees. His pronouncement was trans
lated into Spanish by Captain Mendoza.
The Chief Justice, replying, accepted
the judicial offices in the name of jus
tice, formally recognizing the United
States as the supreme power and de
claring that the bench would render
justice to rich and poor alike.
The proceedings terminated with
handshaking, after which General
Wood's party was escorted to the en
trance by the entire legal body. The
first session of the first purely Cuban
court was then opened.
The local newspapers consider it the
dawn of a new era and express the hope
that the Judges, who are men of legal
acumen and profound research, may
be able to show the world that the Cu
ban population has within itself the
elements of good government. The same
papers are exceedingly complimentary
in their allusions to General Wood, de
claring it "quite impossible that any
other American could have secured a
better grasp of the entire situation."
On Monday 150 men will beg4n to build
the road to Holguin. The distance,
making allowances for necessary devia
tion, is seventy-five miles. General
Wood is determined to facilitate the
means of intercommunication for the
towns on this end of the island, and on
the same day 100 men will begm a road
to Guantanamo. In this case a distance
of forty miles must be covered.
COAL BARGES LOST
DURING THE STORM
Ten of the Crew of the Helicon, Quin
neljaug and Corsica Went Down
With the Vessels.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â The coal barges
Helicon, Quinnebaug and Corsica, it has
just been learned, were lost during the
recent storm, with ten of the twelve men
who composed their crows of four each.
The barges Helicon and Quinnebaug,
loaded with coal, in tow of the tug Ocean
King, and the Corsica, in tow of the tug
Luckenbach, left Norfolk on November 23
for New England points. They encoun
tered the gale in all its force. When about
thirty-five miles off Bargate the Corsica
broke from her tow and went down, fol
lowed by the Helicon, and of eight men
composing the two crews six were
drowned. The Quinnebaug. being the rear
tow of the Ocean King, was lost sight of.
It was learned to-day that she went down
Sunday night off Scotland lightship, prob
ably taking her crew of four men with
her. The lAikenbach Towing and Trans
portation Company says the barges were
worth $20,000 each.
URGENCY IS ADOPTED.
Election of French Senators by Uni
versal Suffrage Approved.
PARIS, Dec. 2.â ln the Chamber of
Deputies to-day M. Gau'thiei, Republican,
introduced a measure providing' for the
election of Senators by universal suffrage
and demanded urgency. The Premier, M.
Dupuy, opposed the granting of urgency
and said the Chamber should think twice
before deciding upon a proposition chang
ing the whole electoral system. ...Urgency,
however, was adopted by a vote of 243 to

AULL MAY GIVE
WAY TO AGUIRRE
Change in Prospect at
Folsom.
WARDEN TO BE REMOVED
IS GUILTY OF OFFENSIVE PAR
TISANSHIP.
Appointment of His Successor One
of the First Acts of the In
coming Adminis
tration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2.â lt is given
out on the best of authorte that one
of the first appointments that will be
made under the administration of Gov
ernor-elect Henry T. Gage will be that
of Martin G. Aguirre of this county as
the successor of Charles Aull as warden
of Folsom Prison. The assertion is
made that the removal of Aull will be
effected on the ground that during- the
campaign he was guilty of offensive
partisanship. His objectionable act
constituted the authorized distribution
of circulars among the employes of the
prison and other persons advising them
to vote for Maguire for Governor.
The warden is appointed by the Board
of Prise Directors, but there will.be
several vacancies cm the board which
Governor (Sage will fill, and in this way
the removal of Aull will be brought
about.
Aguirre, whom it is stated is slated
as the new warden of Folsom, has been
a close friend of Governor Gage for a
quarter of a century. Gage made
Aguirre quite a factor in Republican
politics in this county. In ISBB he ob
tained for Aguirre the Republican nom
ination for Sheriff and he was elected.
Aguirre is now one of the deputy sher
iffs of this county. He is a Spanish-
American, and as Gage received the
nearly solid support of that element in
this part of the State Agulrre's ap
pointment will be accepted as a recog
nition of their loyalty by the Repub
lican standard bearer.

BY THE SHADOW OF DEATH.
Hospitals All Appear to Be Crowded
to Their Fullest Capacity by

BY CORPORAL F. A. HEALY.
Special Correspondence of. The Call.
MANILA, Oct. 22, IS9S.â Things con
tinue to go on here about as usual.
Each succeeding day brings fresh ru
mor of startling happenings in the
chamber where the Peace Commission
deliberates when not occupied with Pa
risian hospitality and each European
born canard is equaled if not outdone
b- the wild tales from the hiils anent
Aguinald-o, and the hordes he is gather
ing to crush out the newly established
power of the Americans. All these dif
ferent reports give us something to
think bout and discuss, but as there is
practically nothing else for the men to
talk about, these very reports have in
themselves become at last only an addi
tion to the already long list of monoto
nous happenings. The regiment moved
its quarters a few days ago from San
Miguel' down to the large Spanish bar
racks on the other side of the Pasig
River, where that muddy and turbid
stream is spanned by the big suspension
bridge over which the Second Battalion
inarched on the memorable 13th of Au
gust, when they were the first Ameri
can troops to enter the promised land.
The First and Second Battalions are
quartered in a fine large collection of
buildings adjoining the Division Hospi
tal, while the Third Battalion is quar
tered in another lot of buildings about
three hundred yards farther down the
Stream toward the walls of old Manila.
These quarters, the best in Manila,
were formerly occupied by the Eigh
teenth regulars, who have been sent
over to Cavite, replacing the Montana
troops, who now occupy the old quar
ters we have vacated. Our new bar
racks are a great improvement on the
old. They are larger, better ventilated,
cleaner and better drained, in addition
to which advantages they possess ex
cellent cook houses and have fine fresh
water shower baths, something not ex
isting in any other regimental quarters
in the city, as far as I know.
In a farmer letter I said considerable
concerning the prevalence of sickness
among the troops. Well, we have just
as much of it as ever, and each morn
ing's sunshine still continues to be tem
pered by the shadow of death. As I
write I hear the strains of a 1a 1 dead
march and, looking out from my win
dow, I see filing past a funeral cortege
bearing to its last resting-place the
body of a California boy, who died last
night from the effects of typhoid pneu
monia. He was Toye Freestrom, a pri
vate of B Company, and one of the best
men in Captain Filmer's command. He
was sober, steady, brave and able, a
good comrade, a good soldier and a
good man. Xone were more ready to
help a friend, none more willing to ac
cept a post of danger and hardship. He
was extremely, popular throughout the
entire command and many a sincere re
gret will I'olluw his body to its island
grave.
Not much information concerning
things medical reaches us bf the
rank and file, and the only way that
â we have of forming our ideas as to the
amount of illness among the men is by
observatlon. We don't know just how
many men are sick, but we do know
that besides the division hospitalâ a
place capable of accommodating con
siderably sver half a thousand men â
there are other places hera and there
all over the city, and each one is
crowded to its fullest capacity. The
smallpox is still with us, and only yes
terday I learned that three new cases
had gone out to join what is left of the
little colony In the tents. The convales
cent hospital, established through the
efforts of Colonel Smith and Major Mc-
Carthy, at Hermita for California boys,
1? working wonders. It stands in an
ideal location, where it gets the full
benest of the soft breezes that sweep
in across the broad expanse of bay,
and where its comparative isolation
from the noise and bustle of barrack
and city life insures the quiet which is
fo Mnuch needed by one recuperating
from a long and severe illness. In ad
dition to this place there will soon be
another hospital erected fo â  the benefit
of the Frisco boys, where the danger
ous cases can be sent, instead of to
the general hospital. These arrange
ments are of the greatest ben ;flt to the
health of the regiment, and too much
cannot be said in commendation of Col
onel Smith and Major McCarthy, to
whose energy the success of the two
undertakings is due. Th" Red Cross
people are still with us, and are doing
excellent work, whic" co.v!'' be greatly
extended were there more of them.
Good nursing is one of the things that
is most needed in 'very large army,
and which, as a general thing. Ls most
lacking. The ladies of the Red Cross
are doing all and more than was ex
pected of them, but there are so many
down here who need careful attention
that double the numoer of women who
are with us could not possibly attend to
all. As to Schlott, the manager of this
auxiliary branch of the army medical
corps. I kmw not what to say. He has
certainly succeeded in winning fame
for himself, if tn be talked about is to
be famous. There is no other man down
here who has been s thoroughly dis
cussed and so thoro hly burnt up as
the suave, good-looking shepherd in
charge of the Red Cross flock. He has
been charged vvith most everything
from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter,
though when the matter is sifted down
I don't believe anything very serious
v.ijl be directly urged against him. As
to his competence or incompetence I
personally know nothing. What I do
know, however, is this: That he has
done everything in his power to assist
Major McCarthy in the letter's efforts
in behalf of the regiment, and since
his arrival our sick are better nursed
and our convalescent taste delicacies
which were impossible to obtain be
fore. So, since these material benefits
have come with Schlott. let him stay,
competent or incompetentâ what does
it matter?
Before I finish with this portion of
my .'orrespondence I would like to
mention something that has several
times struck me very forcibly. The
Red Cross Hospital is situated on the
Calle Conception, Just below the divis
ion hospital. It is crowded with men
and officers, many of whom are sick

almost unto death. Every afternoon

the division hospital and pass the Red
Croso place at a slow step, with the

m since the commencement of its
rison life. Things go on without

rely jog along in a sort of an "act

n to-day" sort of a style, waiting
something to turn up, and hoping
t that something will pso~e to be
a transport with orders to carry us
home. The other day M Company was
enlivened by an incident which at first
looked as though it would end in a
fatality, but which fortunately con
cluded with a brilliant display of hero
ism and the saving of a life. One of
the boys of the company while en
gaged in some sort of an occupation
near the river's edge managed to fall
in. As he could not swim he was in a
fair way to become an addition to
Davy Jones' collection of curios, if that
ancient mariner ever does any gather
ing at the muddy bottom of the Pasig.
Luckily his dilemma was seen by two
of his comrades, who, fully dressed as
they were, plunged in and swam to his
assistance. They managed to get him
ashore before life was extinct, though
they had a hard. time of it, and nearly
lost their own lives in the effort. The
gallant fellows who so nobly imperiled
themselves to sÂ£ /c a comrade are Cor
poral Frank L. Owen and Private Ed
gar A. Taylor, both San Francisco boys
and both members of M Company. A
German baker by the name of Kline,
who came down here on the Valencia,
became involved in a quarrel with a
woman of the town which ended in his
beating. his lady love nearly to death
with the butt end of a pistol. Mr. Kline
has already started in on a on^e year's
sentence in t! c way of reparation for
the wrong he did.
There is no monkey business when
martial law takes the place of civil.
Kline is the firs* white man to be
charged with a serious offense. At least
he is the first I have hÂ«ard of. By the
by, in a previous letter I spoke of the
band possessing professional attributes
which made the resemblance of their
music to that produced by a Chinese
orchestra noticeable to the practiced
ear of a trained observer. The band has
improved. It now beats anything that
can be produced by the best orchestra
in all Chinatown. In fact, its leader
has by careful attention and constant
pratice brought it up to a fair degree
of excellence, and it will now compare
favorably with the other bands down
here. This is the truth, as was my
statement in the previous article al
ready referred to. There are a few other
things in which the regiment has great
ly improved. I mean in its marching,
Ed mounting and> manual of arms,
ry morning and evening the boys
put through their paces and in a
petition between the First Califor
nia and any of the other regiments
down here, volunteer or regular, I
would willingly risk a pay day on the
boys from the Golden Gate and I never
allow sentiment to influence my betting
either. The enlisted man may have the
hardest time in camp, the line officer
may be the worst off in battle, but there
is one poor unfortunate in every regi
ment whose lot is a hard one, whether
in field or garrison, and who, when he
gets the best of it, receives nothing but
the worst. This unfortunate individ
ual is the regimental adjutant. He is
the recipient of every complaint, the re
dresser of every wrong, the man who
must bear every kick and attend to
every little matter that arises in the
entire regiment and the only thanks he
gets is the grumbling acnuiescence of
the disappointed party. Our adjutant,
Captain Kelleher, has troubles of his
own, but he manages to worry through
them and still retain his health and "he,
together with the sergeant major, has
at last succeeded in getting things so
systematized in their department that,
strange to relate, for once, at least, in
military history, things in a regimen
tal adjutant's office run as smoothly
as clock work. I know that letters of
all sorts are being sent from this regi
ment and other regiments have gone
I'ond mere private epistolary com
int and have indulged in general pe
on trying to impress en the nation's
i eutive the necessity of calling them
ne and mustering them out.
low, I would like the people at home
know just how the California boys
1 on the matter. Firstly, they want
get home, now that the war is over;
want to get there in the worst way.
They feel that they have done their
j duty in- every particular and done it
! well. If there are regular troops at
home to take their places they feel that
a great injustice will be done them if
they are kept here in garrison when
they have so much awaiting them in
their business at home. Yet they will
J make no complaint, keep no wires hot,
j nor will they get up any petitions ask
; ing for their recall. If they must stay
: down here they will stay like men and
J make no complaint. They "lave proved
that they can take the hardships of
campaigning and take then cheerfully,
they have proved that they can fight
and fight well and they will not spoil
the luster of the glory they have won
by whimpering to get out of a contract
j which has not yet been half worked

will wait patiently and in ;i soldierly
I manner until the call come.? to them

dentally there are three things which
have received no special ment.on. in any
of the various and varied histories of
Manila that I have seenâ beasts, babies
and bugs. The fecundity of U 3 islands
In these three things surpass belief.
No household but has at least live dogs,
no dog but attracts to his. person and
vicinity at least fifty different varieties
of bugs, while for babies, the place can
not be outdone. The dogs are of all
sorts and colors; so are the bugs, but
in justice to Manila motherhood I must
confess that, the babies are generally
brown. They range on an average from
three to a dozen in a family, though
I know one happy female who boasts
of seventeen and blushingly whispers
of prospects in the near future. Even
anticipation takes the plural in this
wonderful country. These idols of
I hearts and of households may be all
right under most circumstances, but
when you find that all the dogs in the
neighborhood have organized a sport
ing club to bring off nightly events
under your window, when you fill in
the interlude between canine scraps
with infantile choruses and have your
attention diverted only in the exciting
chase after some curious insect, which
eventually eludes you and escapes to
some darksome but safe recess in the
folds of your blankets â when, I say,
you enjoy all these different excite

FRESNO, Dec. 2.â At the Fruit
growers' State convention to-day further
time was allowed a committee for a con
ference between the manufacturers and
university- authorities for the framing of
legislation to regulate the sale of com
mercial fertilizers.
W. N. Rawley submitted a list of sev
enteen of the principal commission mer
chantÃ and receivers of fruits and fruit
products in San Francisco, who have ex
pressed their recognition of the value of
State inspection and a quarantine law
for fresh fruit, particularly apples and
pears.
M. Theo. Kearny read a naper on the
raisin industry, showing how, through
the operation of a combine, there has al
ready been sold this year 224 of the 3000
car lot crop, and the market has taken up
1000 more carried over from 1897. The East
ern market has been steady at highest
prices, with no stocks at distributing
points. The trade freely bought on the
fuarantee that prices will be kept up.
ales with few exceptions have been made
for cash before shipment. Shortly after
delivery an advance of 2 cents per pound
has been made, an additional 1 cent is
being paid on certain grades, with more to
come at the final exportation, so that the
net result for the whole crop will equal
about 3H cents per pound in the "sweat
box, while last year an average net re
turn of 1%, cents per pound was not real
ized, l.nder a makeshift plan and a cost
ly deal with commercial packers over $1
more has been realized to raisin-growers
this year than they could possibly have
secured for their crops without this or
ganization.
The scheme of pooling and its applica
tion to the fruit industry was discussed
and San Jose was chosen as the place for
the convention of 1899.
B. E. Hutchinson of this county then
offered resolutions indorsing the w"ork of
the horticultural commissions of the vari
ous counties and recommending that no
change be made in the present law in so
far as It affects the commissioners Some
opposition developed, John S. Dore of this
county declaring the law to be an ex
travagant one, but the resolutions were
adopted.
G. P. Hall of San Diego gave an inter
esting talk on "Methods in Citrus Fruit
Culture." He considered at length the
matter of trimming the trees, and favored
training the branches to grow in a hori
zontal instead of a perpendicular course.
When limbs grow upward they produce
more wood than fruit. The matter of
steaming lemons to bring out the color
and make the skin elastic was discussed
by the speaker. Oranges were subjected
to the same process, ho was sorry to say
for it did not improve them.
The olive industry was next considered.
President Cooper and Secretary .belong
taking part in the discussion. Reference
was made to the failure of the crop this
year, but no definite cause could be as
signed therefor. A technical discussion on
the pollination of fruits followed, after
which resolutions thanking the citizens of
Fresno and the Southern Pacific Company
for courtesies extended were adopted. The
convention adjourned sine die.

MESSAGE FROM ANDREE
STOCKHOLM, Dec. 2.â An engine driver named Detke has written
to the Swedish-Norwegian Minister at St. Petersburg a letter in
which he says that he found in the vicinity of the Ural a
bottle containing two papers, one of which bore the following mes
sage, written in French:
"Andree's balloon has crossed the Ural Mountains.
ANDREE."
The other paper, inscribed in Russian, was as follows:
"Give this letter to the Consul or to the police."
The balloon Eagle, with Professor Andree and two companions,
Stridenberp and Frankel, in the car, left Danes Island, of the
Spitzbergen group, on July 11, 1897, in an attempt to cross the Pole.
Since then no definite news of the aeronauts has been received beyond â¢
a message attached to a carrier pigeon found by the whaling ship
Falken, which arrived at Copenhagen on September 2. This message
read :
"July 13, 12:30 p. m.â Latitude 82.2 N, longitude 12.5 E. Good voy
age eastward. All well."
quired to acquire the municipal water
system.
This summary includes the important
points of a document which, in its en
tirety, comprises about 70,000 words.
There is no organized opposition to
the adoption of the charter. Some citi
zens oppose it, however, on the ground
that it gives to the Mayor autocratic
powers. There are others who do not
favor it for the reason that they are
opposed to the initiative and referen
dum clause. On the other hand, some
people will vote for the charter simply
because it contains that one clause.
Among those engaged in the whole
sale and retail liquor traffic there is
some opposition to the charter for the
reason that the number of saloons to be
licensed in the community is to be re
stricted.
The school teachers and their friends
are actively supporting the charter for
the reason that it provides for some ad
mirable reforms in the School Depart
ment.
The general feeling among those who
have given the matter any study is
that the new charter will be adopted,
as it requires only a majority vote.
REGULARS WILL SOON
BE SENT TO MANILA
At Least six Infantry and One Ar
tillery Regimtnt to Relieve
the Volunteers.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: There is reason to believe that
the War Department is considering the
advisability of immediately reinforcing
General Otis in Manila by at least six
regiments of infantry and one regi
ment of artillery. The troops will be of
the regular establishment, and if the
situation permits may take the place of
volunteer regiments now there.
The War Department is preparing a
bill of its own for the reorganization
and increase of the army. This bill is
the result of a conference held a few
days ago by Secretary Alger, Senator
Proctor of the Senate Military Commit
tee and Chairman Hull of the House
Military Committee.
The bill will provide that the regular
army shall consist of 100,000 men, and
it if, understood that authority will be
given the President to enlist a certain
number of natives of Cuba, Porto Rico,
Hawaii and the Philippines for ser
vice in their respective countries, such
troops to be officered by Americans.

NICE QUESTIONS FOLLOW
THE EXPANSION POLICY
British Claims for Redress in Hawaii
Must First Receive
Consideration.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.â The United
I States Governmont is being called upon
| to face some questions of interest re
, suiting fro-m th<; expansion policy. The
British Government, some time before
the annexation of Hawaii to the United-
States, filed with Hawaii a number of
I claims for redress for the ill treatment
and illegal confinement of British sub
jects involved in the revolutionary
movement which overthrew the Queen.
These amount to several hundred thou
sand dollars in the aggregate, and the
! question is, the Hawaiian Government
havin-g failed to settle them, whether
the United States Government does not
i inherit the liability. The claims are
I Just such as were filed by the late Sec
i cretary Gresham against the Hawaiian
Government in behalf of a number of
alleged American citizens, most* of
whom afterward turned out to be
aliens. None of our claims were
pressed, but they formed the founda
tion for the British claims.
Another question of more importance
is the determination of the status of
our newly acquired citizens or sub
jects. Already a Chinaman by birth,
but a Philippine by citizenship, has ap
plied for recognition as an American
citizen. Another Chinaman in Hawaii
wants a passport showing he is a citi
zen of the United States. The annexa
tion law prohibits the coming into the
limits of the United States of Chinese
persons from Hawaii, but the constitu
tionaiity of any act that proposes to
discriminate among American citizens
has been raised, and this Chinaman is
a citizen by adoption. These are a
few of the questions that ha%e already
arisen, and others are expected to fol
low in the near future.
FOR A NATIONAL
NAVAL MILITIA
Delegates From Many States Discuss
the Plans ior the Or
ganization.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 2. â The
fourth annual meeting of the Associa
tion of Naval Militia of the United
States was held here to-day on board
the old receiving ship St. Louis, rep
resentatives being present from Flor
ida, California, Georgia, Illinois, Loui
siana, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, New
York, New Jersey, Missouri and other
States.
The meeting was one of national im
portance, on account of the movement
now on foot' looking toward the forma
tion of a national naval militia. To
day's session was given to a general
discussion of the advisability of form
ing a naval reserve of a national char
acter. It appeared to be the opinion of
all those participating in the debate
that such a step would be a move in
the right direction, and about the only
point on which there seemed to be a
difference was whether or not State
naval militias should be dispensed with.
Captain John Bartlett, U. S. N., who
had charge of the naval militia during
the war, favored the continuation of
the State militia as a stepping-stone to
a higher organization, to be known as
the National Naval Reserve. He held
that the State militia could be made
a valuable training school and give to
the National Reserve men of experi
ence.
Lieutenant H. H. Sutherland, U. S.
N., gave his views as outlined in his
recent report and held that the men
composing the National Reserve should
be trained from the start in that body
and under its regulations exactly as is
done in the regular navy.

GOOD WORK OF
THE RED CROSS
AT MANILA
Much Dome for Sick
Soldiers.
NEEDED MEDICINE FURNISHED
COMFORTABLE BUILDINGS HAVE
BEEN SECURED.
There Has Leer a Great and Com
â ' .'â¢ ' mendable Change in the Man- -
"...": agement of Affairs Since
â " â¢â â .â¢â¢. ' Schlott's Arrival.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
Oct. 21.â There has been a
'. -great and most commendable change in
.: the management of Red Cross affairs
. since Mr. Schlott came to Manila. I
have come to believe that grave in
. justice has been done to this gentleman,
due. in part to his own misunderstand-,
! . ing :6f the situation here and in part
: also, to the fact that he was not directly
â ' â¢; accredited by somebody at home
. . to the California Regiment. SchJott
â  : : E'ho\ys a determination now, at all
â â¢...events, to aid the Californians by every
;' . -means in his power, and he has been
. the cause of a great lessening in the
sickness ' amorigr the lads of the regi
ment. Of course his work has taken
a .broader scope than that. The sick of
the /whole army has been made to feel
that the Red Gross is a merciful organi
zation, although Schlott has been ham
pered not a little by the arrant stu
pidity, to call it by no milder name,
which has characterized the manage
ment of the medical department of the
Eighth Army Corps.
In the first place, after he had gained
some knowledge of the situation and
set his original mistakes right, Mr.
Schlott rented a new house on the Calle
Concepciun which he fitted up originally
as a hospital for the Californians, but
which was taken as a hospita} for offi
cers. This place is still partly under
Mr. Schlott's direction, and as a re
sult ib the best managed institution of
. the kind in Manila. In this place there
are accommodations for sixteen officers
and twenty men, and the place is full
. all. the time.. The friends of officers
will not permit them to chance the hor
rors of the brigade hospital, and the
.men who can get under the wing of
. the Red Cross esteem themselves for
". .turiate; : -' V ,'. V.. Â»
. The taking over of this concern by
. the army authorities made it necessary,
: '- ' of course, for Schlott to seek a new out
â¢ let for the energies of the society â and,
.this time, it was deemed better to do
something for the Californians that
could not be taken away from them.
Major McCarthy of the First California
â¢acted as director of the movement this
time, and as a starter obtained his own
appointment as director of a ward es
pecially for Californians in the brigade
â '.. hospital. This was the opportunity Mr.
-. Schlott had secured for the accommo
dation of his iiurses, a house on < 'a!le
; Concepcion, one block from his original
. hospital. In this house several rooms
. . were fitted np as wards, and besides
this the Red Cross manager put up in
the â yardâ a large oneâ -four big, roomy
â  tents, with floors raised from the.ground
;â¢" arid accommodations in each for forty.-'-'
.;' eight patients. These tents have.com
â â¢â 'â  '..fbrtatjle cots, each with its mosquito
i netting, tables, camp chairs, all the
â  ' 'accessories, designed to lessen as much
as possible the evils of sickness in camp
. .life. .Between the tents a large Moor
'. has been laid, roofed over with thatched
a;nd painted bamboo to keep out the
rain and the sun, and here the male
nurses eat with such of the patients as
are able to be out of bed. It is a most
.complete arrangement ail through.
There is a tent, also, used exclusively
for sick Filipinos.
1. have described, in a previous letter,
the California convalescent hospital at
Ermita: This place, with two large
tents, for officers and attendants, Mr. (
Schic/tt fitted up from the Red Cross
fundâ and he likewise furnished the
tents. Seventy-five cots, all those orig
. inally. brought: out from Sari Francisco,
' .went into this hospital. â '.'-"'.'. : . â 
The smallpox patients, too, would
have suffered very; much more than
they did if it had not been for the Red
<'rnss.'. . The' army medical authorities
did not provide for any such contin
gency as the outbreak of a plague. The
army medical authorities did not pro T
vide fox any â contingency, whatever,. It
was Schlott who gave the tents for the
pesthouse and who had them floored^
It was Schlott who furnished Dr.
O'Brien 'the drugs needed to combat the
disease â as he has furnished the Cali
fornia medical officers with drugs to
take the place of inferior articles pro
vided by the Government, thereby ma
terially decreasing the sick list of the
regiment. It w-as Schlott who fur
nished' the alc<,-holÂ° in which -the pest-.
; house attendants bathed themselves to
ayoid' contagion and -to the use of which
Dr. Lippincott. objected, as "too expen
â¢ Bive"- for. the purpose- .. â  '.'â â â ;.'-' â¢ '..
In fact,, in his ne w. character; Schlbtt
â¢ has pome to be the. saying angel of the
troops .here. He is generous Where gen
erosity is of .value in dealing with the
sick: He has shmvn admirable execu
tive ability, and he has sought the best
â¢ of advice.' Nobody, in the army is bet
ter fitted to advise with intelligence
in a matter of this- kind than Dr. Mc-
Carthy of the First California, arid Dr.
McCarthy . is Schlott's best friend here
now/ '.â ' â '.. .â :â¢'â ;â 'â ':â¢â â ;'/â â¢â â .â¢'. ' â  â¢'â â¢ - : - â â¢â â .â¢
Mr. Schlott yesterday' rented still an
other house, which he will at once fit up
in his grounds rh.Calle Cbhcepcion, but
there is a need for more women nurses
than he has here now., and the need
is growing. It would do your heart
. good to go among the sick men here
and Â»cc how the presence of a deft-fin
gered woman at the bedside brightens
them. There are eleven of these women
here now, all doing noble work. The
. society should send no more married,
couples. as nurses, the couple that came
with Schlott having turned out a dis
appointment, and men who come to
nurse are, unfortunately, not to be re
lied' upon. Two of those who came with
Schlott, Hyle and Ross, deserted him
after their arrival here. He has .four
â  male nurses now, all doing good work,
but the women are very much better
on the whole. They work harder, are
conscientious, and infinitely painstak
ing.
There is need for money, too, and
here is a chance for arieal to the gen
erosity of Californians. It is a spirit
which, as all men know, is not invoked
In vain. Drugs afe needed constantly,
and can only be bought for cash. Sup
plies are needed, and delicacies. There
is need for even more hospitals than the
army has now, and should Manila be
permanently occupied should the vol
unteers unfortunately be kept here,
then the need will be gTeater instead of
less. The donors can rest perfectly well
â¢ assured that the ironey will be ex
pended for the purposes to which it has
been devoted.
BOMB EXPLODED
UNDER A HOUSE
Attempt to Kill a New
Jersey Councilman.
WORK OF POLITICAL ENEMIES
DYNAMITE PLACED IN THE
SLEEPING MAN'S ABODE.
The Building Wrecked by the Force
of the Explosion, but the In
mates of the Place Escape
Injury.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â An Atlantic
City, N. J., special to the Herald says:
Under the house of Councilman-at-large
Edward Johnson in Brigantine, near
here, a dynamite bomb was exploded at
11 o'clock last ntght, partially wrecking
the building. '
There is no doubt it was the inten
tion of the perpetrators of the outrage
to kill M r, Johnson. Threats against
his life had been heard, owing to the
part he had taken in the recent politi
cal struggle in Brigantine. Mr. John
son by his vote holds the balance of
power between the factions in the
Brigantine City Council.
Johnson retired at his usual time last
night, and was sleeping soundly when
about an hour before midnight he was
awakened by a loud explosion. The
house rocked as though shaken by an
earthquake, and there was a crash of
breaking glass and falling timbers, fol
lcâed by darkness and silence. Nobody
in the house was hurt.
After a prolonged search the bomb
that caused the havoc was found. It
was a shattered piece of lead pipe that
had evidently been filled with dyna
mite. The crime apparently was com
mitted by some one familiar with the
premises, as the bomb had been placed
directly under Johnson's bedroom win
dow. Johnson is certain the outrage
was committed by political enemies.

Commissioner Hardens
Investigation.
SILVER MONEY CIRCULATED
SYSTEM CAUSES SMUGGLING
OF THE WHITE METAL.
Four Principal Industries of the Isl
ands Are Hemp, Sugar, Copra
and Tobacco â Room for
Cordage Plant.
ppecial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. â Edward
Harden, who was appointed in Au
gust last an honorary commissioner of
the United States to make an investi
gation of the financial and industrial
conditions in the Philippines, has made
his report to the Secretary of the
Treasury, in the course of which he
says:
Silver is the basis of the currency In the
Philippine Islands. There is no gold in
general circulation and has been none for
more than twenty years. The Mexican
dollar of a date previous to 1577 is current
in the islands and it is practically the only
money in general circulation. The Span
ish Government in the summer of 18i>7
coined $6,000,000 of silver in a local cur
rency, which was sent to the islands.
These dollars are lighter in weight than
the Mexican dollars, but the scarcity of
money in the Philippine Islands caused
them to be quickly absorbed. There is a
local note-issuing bank called the Banco
EspJtnol Filipino, which has in circulation
notes based on silver, of which there was
outstanding on September 30, IS9B, approx
imately, $2,500,000.
The fluctuation in the demand for money
In different seasons of the year resulted in
widely fluctuating rates of exchange, and
In the continued flow of money either to
or from the inlands. The law which pre
vented the Importation of the Mexican
dollars of a date subsequent to 1877 proved
a great hardship to the business interests
and would have been a much greater evil
had it not been for the laxity of the ofti
cials. which permitted and encouraged
smuggling. It was not uncommon for the
dollar to go to a premium of 10 or li! per
cent, and this would immediately start the
flow of silver toward the islands, which
â¢would be continued until the demand was
met and the rate of exchange was reduced
to a point which would cause smuggling
to cease being profitable.
The smuggling of silver into the islands
was a recognized industry. It was carried
on largely by the rich â¢"mestizos," or Chi
nese half-castes. There was a regular sys
tem for the bringing in of these coins.
After the occupation of Manila by the
American troops permission was given the
banks to import silver freely, and the re
sult has been to keep exchange rates on a
more stable basis.
There are eight million people in the
islands, according to the estimate of the
Spanish Government, of whom only a
small fraction live In the territory con
tiguous to Manila and Ililo. When money
once leaves these centers it passes out of
the knowledge of business men, and it is
impossible, therefore, to form any correct
idea of the amount of money now In the
islands. It is estimated there is in cir
culation $10,000,000 of subsidiary coins, mo
10-cent, 20-cent and 50-cent pieces, which
have been reccflned from Mexican dollars
by the Spanish Governments The esti
mate of the Mexican dollars^ now in cir
culation, as given .by one of tne best-in
formed bankers in the islands, is from
$20,000,000.- to $25,000,000. This, with the
$2,500,000 of notes of the Banco Espanol
Filipino now in circulation, constitutes
the currency of the islands. This would
make a total of from $40,000,000 to $45,000,
000, speaking roughly, for the entire isl
ands, or, approximately, $5 per capita for
the total population of the islands. It
must not be overlooked that these figures
are given on a silver basis and that,
therefore, in figuring on our own stand
ard, all of these figures must be cut in
two.
Three banking institutions do the bank-
Ing business or the Philippine Islands
aside from that done by the large com
mercial houses which buy and sell ex
change, and, to a limited extent, carry on
the business which legitimately belongs to
banking institutions.
â¢ The question of the future currency of
the islands is one which is of vital im
portance to all business men of the isl
ands. The beÃt-lnformed men in Manila
are unanimous in their opinion that under
present condition the silver currency is
the only one suited to the islands. The
natives of the Philippine Islands are con
servative to a degree in the matter of
their currency, and it would be a long and
tedious task to educate them to a dollar
which would be worth twice that now in
circulation. Notwithstanding the Amer
icans have a force of 15.000 somiers in Ma
nila who are paid in gold, the people of
the islands will believe in nothing but
silver. All the soldiers when they are
paid in gold take their money to one of
the banks and exchange it for local cur
rency. The native will take the Mexican
dollar, worth fess than 50 cents in gold,
In preference to the United States dollar,
worth 100 cents. If the United States re
tains the Philippine. Islands a special
coinage of silver dollars might be minted
for circulation in the . archipelago, the
same as the British dollar was put in cir
culation in the Straits Settlements, in
Hongkong and in other ports where Brit
ish interests predominate.
Practically all of the export and import
trade of the islands is in the hands of
foreigners. There are a few Spaniards
engaged in trading, but the bulk of the
business, in a commercial way, is done
by British, German, Belgian and Ameri
can citizens. TheÃe men do not meddle
with the insurrection, and they have been
able to maintain friendly relations not
only -with the Spanish Government offi
cials, but with the natives as well.
The most reliable figures that can be
obtained on exports from the islands for
the year 1897 show a total of $41.342,250.
Hemp and sugar were the principal arti
cles of export. â  Tobacco and copra were
aleo exporteu in large quantities.
There are no official figures obtainable
giving the imports for the Philippine
Islands. One of the larger importing
houses, which keeps statistics of Imports
and which has practically complete fig
ures of all goods shipped into Manila,
has kept records which, show the impor
tation of goods to the value of $17,400 000
during the year 1857. Taking these figures
as being correct, there is a trade balance
in favor of the islands of $23,999,290, that
being the excess of exports over imports
The four principal industries of the
islands in the order named are hemp
sugar, copra and tobacco. The hemp in
dustry supports a large proportion of the
populution of the southern part of Lu
zon and islands to the south, and, accord
ing to the opinion of those most familiar
with the trade, there is no danger of an
overproduction. It is all exported and
there would seem to be room for the es
tablishment of a plant for the making of
cordage. There is practically no rope
manufactured in the Philippines.
PICKS UP A RICH PRIZE.
British Steamship Tows the Bark La
Escocesa to Port.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 2.â The Brit
ish steamship Marstonmoor, Captain
Angus, which sailed from Baltimore
November 29 for Rotterdam, arrived at
the Delaware breakwater to-day, hav
ing in tow one of the richest prizes
picked up at sea in some time. She
towed in the British bark La Escocesa,
which was bound from lquique to New
York, laden with about 2000 tons of ni
trate of soda, valued at about $65,000.
The prize was picked up twenty-four
hours previously to the eastward of
Cape Henlopen.
From Captain Angus it was learned
that the bark when sighted was in
charge of the chief officer. Captain
Evans,- her commander, had died of
brain fever on September 22. She was
in a helpless condition, having experi
enced a heavy pale on November 29.
The decks were swept, pumps smashed
and . boats carried away, together with
the fore and mizzen masts. According
to the bargain made by Captain Angus
the settlement ,of - the case of salvage
is to be left to arbitration.

ALUMNI HONOR THE
FOOTBALL ELEVEN
ROUSING BANQUET AT THE MER
CHANTS' CLUB.
Cochran the Target of Applauseâ The
Team Entertained by the Grad
uates of the State
University.
Never before has so much rattling noise
emanated from the Mercantile Club as
last niyjht, the occasion of an alumni ban
quet o* the- University of California in
honor of Garrett Cochran and the blue
and gold football team which won the
signal victory from Stanford on Thante
giving.
Between courses, during courses, sand
wiched in between glasses, came a va
riety of noises and yells that made the
roof of the building vibrate to the rhythm
of the rah, rahs. Graduates of antiquity
were there shoulder to shoulder with the
freshly made alumnus, and ail joined
in the apotheosis of the football team,
Coach Cochran and Captain Hall.
For seven years the university gradu
ates have nursed their latent enthusiasm
for a victory, and last night it let loose
wifh more than natural vigor. Gathered
around the board were Chief Engineer
Storey of the Valley road, Charles Wesley
Reed, Frank Carpenter, George Pardee,
Mayor Phelan, R. W. Davis, George Cad
wallader, Carey Jones, Elliott McAllister,
George Roos and a number of other
prominent alumni. The faculty all yelled
and hurrahed, and not a single occasion
was lost to pour praise and gratitude Into
the ear of Cochran.
Cochran was the target of all the ora
torical arrows. D. A. D'Ancona, president
of the Alumni Association, presided, and
his first tribute was a mixture of glorifi
cation of the University of California and
the football team. He introduced Gar
rett Cochran, who made a few remarks
advisory to the football team and pro
phetic of future vhctories. He was inter
rupted by calls of Cochran for '99 until
the hall rang with the cheers for his re
turn.
Percy Hall was then called upon and in
a few titling remarks thanked all for
their good will and pledged himself to do
all in his power to sustain the record of
the team of 1898. Everard Brown told how
he labored in the East to secure the serv
ices of Cochran, how Princeton men sent
him to New York, to Philadelphia and
to Princeton in order to delude him in
his search for Cochran, and how he fin
ally tracked his "arae and forced the
contract upon him. Again came "Coch
ran, Cochran; we want Cochran."
Mayor Phelan. amid cries of the "plug
hat," arose and paid a tribute to athletic
sports, mens sana in corpore sano. He
was lustily cheered. President Kellogg
spoke of the victory, the necessity of
combining work with play and as
sured all that he was heart and soul
with the battlers of the gridiron.
The toast of the evening. "The .blue and
Gold," by John R. Glascock, was- a poetic
tribute to the colors of the University of
California. In a short speecn, full of elo
quence and power, he exhorteu all to con
centrate their efforts to the advancement
of the university.
Professor Moses then arose and enter
tained the banqueters. He said: "L,ast
year I Bald football was not a very good
game, This year by opinions have under
gone a very great revolution. To-day we
believe in things we did not a year ago,
and before sitting down I wish to express
my thanks to the football team for hav
ing wrought the change."
Others who spoke were Warren Greg
ory James Hopper, Charles Wesley Reed.

George Cadwallader^

last evening and the women were charg
ed at the California street police station,
from where they were immediately re
leased on $500 bonds. All the women ar
rested last night have been placed under
arrest during the past week_a number or
times on charges of vagranry and keep
ing houses of ill fame. As soon as they
return to their houses Kane swears out
new warrants.
Henry Ach, who is employed as attor
ney for the property owners, was pres
ent last night when the warrants were
served and did all in his power to soe
that the women the officers wanted were
found. Four of the women were stok
last night and not in the houses, so but
thirteen of the seventeen warrants coald
be served.
ROBBED HIS EMPLOYERS.
Edward Sullivan, Stock Clerk of the
White House, Arrested for Theft.
Edward Sullivan, a 17-year-old boy, em
ployed at the White House, was arrested
yesterday by Detective Dillon. He was
taken to the City Prison, where he was
locked up. Neither Sullivan nor Detec
tive Dillon would talk when questioned
regarding the arrest.
Sullivan was employed, so it is reported,
as a "stock clerk in the White House, and
had worked in that capacity for some
time. It is satd that he has stolen goods
to the amount of between $500 and $1000.
The boy's parents are poor people and
respectable, and it is reported that no
charges will be preferred against him.
Raphael Weill, the president of the com
pany, when seen last night regarding the
arrest of Sullivan, admitted the boy's
guilt, but stated that on account of hia
age no charges would be made against
him by the company. He will be released
from custody to-day.

County Hospital Overcrowded.
"Not a single vacant bed In the City
and County Hospital," is the notice posted
up on the blackboard by Dr. Tillman yes
terday afternoon as he placed the last
male patient in the only cot in which a
/patient could find accommodation. In
consequence of this crowded condition
over twenty applicants had to be turned
away during the day, as no room could
be found for their accommodation. There
are 420 male patients now in the hospital
and the female wards are also full. Under
these conditions the hospital authorities
are sorely perplexed as to what they are
to do with the other applicants who may
apply to-day and in the future until some
of those now in the hospital vacate their
places.
JASPAR ROBBERSON DEAD.
The Well Known Attorney, Attacked
by a Fainting Spell, Expires
in a Few Minutes.
Jaspar Robberson, a well-known attor
ney, whose practice has been confined
largely *to the police courts, died in the
back room of a saloon at Polk and Mar
ket streets at about midnight last night.
Robberson was passing down Market
street with a couple of friends when sud
denly he stopped, telling them that he felt
faint and would like to rest for awhile.
They took him into the saloon and asked
the bartender for a chair. Robberson sat
down, breathing heavily, and after a few
minutes expired. Death is attributed to
heart failure. He was unmarried and
occupied a room at 240 Montgomery street.

NOT A SIMILAR CASE.
A Horse Thief Need Expect No Mercy
in Texas.
The old-fashioned Texan had by some
strange apportioning of fate been put in
a room at a crowded hotel with a divinity
student from an Eastern college, and they
soon established a conversational footing
between themselves, though the Texan
couldn't quite understand why the young
man wouldn't "take a nip for a night
cap." Before they slept the talk turned
upon the customs and morals of Texas, as
xemplified in lynching, ho young man
arguing against it.
"Gee whiz, you don't reckon we oughtn't
to hang a hoss thief, do you?" the Texan
exclaimed in tones of horror, but without
profanity, out of deference to the char
acter of the other side.
"Most assuredly not."
"But what ought we to do with him?
Not let him git loose?"
"Let the law take its course."
"Mebbe It'll miss fire and the cuss'll git
away."
"That Is not your fault. If the law says
he is guiltless you must accept the de
cision and forgive the sinner."
"Thar ain't no authority fer that, Is
thar?"
"The Bible."
"Thar's nothin' thar that covers the
ground."
"Oh, yes, my friend," replied the stu
dent, warming In his zeal, "even the
thief on the cross was forgiven."
For some reason the Texan seemed to
choke a moment, till he caught his voice
again.
"Aw, here, young feller," he ex
claimed in a tone of expostulation, "that
wasn't no hoss thief," and the Texan was
so serious about it that the young man
had to laugh in spite of himself.
EMPEROR'S TALL GRENADIER
"There was nothing unusual in the
German Emperor selecting Chiemke, the
tallest grenadier In his army, to accom
pany him on his spectacular visit to the
East," said an ex-English officer, "be
cause he expected to visit people who
might easily be impressed by size. When
England has had occasion to send Com
missioners to any of the savage tribes
with which she has had dealings she has
usually selected tall men as escorts.
Chiemke is six feet ten inches, and I
have no doubt that his height duly im
pressed the Turks. When the German
Emperor returned in 1889 from hie first
â visit to Constantinople he sent the Sultan
a complete set of kettledrums, which
he Intrusted to Lieutenant Pleskow, who
Is nearly soven feet in height. There
was an amusing story told of Pleskow
several years ago. He was 'making a
short walking trip and he lost his way.
He looked over a seven-foot garden
wall and asked a girl who was picking
gooseberries to direct him which roan
to take. The maid, seeing only hia head
and assuming from its height that its
owner must be on horseback, told him
to ride first to the right and then to the
left. That story clung to Pleskow.
FORMATION OF CANYONS.
The secret of the grer-* denudation and
of the wonderful achievement of the
Colorado in carving out of rock a series
of canyons about 500 miles long, and, in
one place at least, more than a mile deep,
with a multitude of tributary chasms
and gorges, is very simple when you
know It. say a Harper's. The old lake bed
slowly rose. At first the Colorado River
and Its trioutartes, or some nameless
monstrous ancestor of these, sweeping
over the slbwlv risii. : surfaces, planed
them down in most relentless fashion, and
then began wearing out broad, shallow
stream beds. But then the country rose
more rapidly, and the water had to cut
deeper channels in the rocks in order to
get out and away to sea.
Owing in part to the ' wear of the
water itself, but more to the ceaseless
bombardment of the suspended sand
which it bore from the up country, or
picked up as it went along, and to the
thump of pebbles and bowlders which it
swept on in flood time, the river kept cut
ting dawn as the strata rose, until finally,
when what was left of our inland sea bot
tom got thrust up so that, towering far
above its erstwhile rocky shores, It had
to be called a Plateau, the Colorado and
its auxiliaries found themselves at the
bottom of a series of canyons and gorges,
where they are to-day.
WHEN TO EAT DINNER.
Hardworking men, especially in the
learned professions, are often puzzled aa
t<> the right hours for their meaas and tbe
right diot to be taken at their meal3> Tho
much graver question of stimulants also
Interests them personally. The fear of a
midday meal is very common among
brain-workers. A good luncheon is apt
to interfere with inspiration, especi.i:ly
if any form of alcohol be taken. Tea,
vry popular with scholars, is i-^s ob
jectionable as to its immediate effects.
but it is very dangerous to digestion, es
pecially among scholars, who, like work
women, nearly always take too much and
prefer their tea to be strong, "red as
blood," as Garrick used to say. The chief
danger in taking too light a midday meal
is that the student is at his worst, phy
sically, just before dinner time, xlonce
Tlinner is rendered a fresh source of dys
pepsia, and if he strolls about oefora the
evening meal he is apt to take cold.
The special stimulants of great men
have been recorded in their memoirs. One
of the most remarkable records of tnis
kind has come to light in Aubrey's "Brief
Lives," founded on notes taken by me
author in the middle of the seventeenth
century. Few drinks are more* distrusted
among bralnworkers in these days tnan
ale, but Prynne seems to have thought
Otherwise. He was a voluminous writer,
nhd his pamphlets lost him his ears ana
endangered his head. Aubrey informs ua
that "about every three hours hia
(Prynnes) man was to bring him a roll
and pot of ale to refoclllate his wasted
spirits; bo ho studied and drank and
munched some bread, and this maintained
him till night; and then he made a good
supper. Now, he did well not to dine,
which breaks off one's fancy, which will
not presently be regained."
The danger of a priori reasoning may.be
seen from the hoOTt quotation. Those
who have forgotten about Prynne would
take him from tills note of his dit't to be
a Bohemian of tho well-known old-fash
ioned type; yot he \vnn a stern, uncom
promising puritan, who luffered mutila
tion and tlu" pillory, fend hud a violent and
very un-Holu'inlnn prejudice against the
stage. The diet doÂ«l 801 Hun proclaim
the man. We doubt, however, if the seri
ous student of the end of the nineteenth
century would do WÂ«ll to "refoclllate hia
wasted spirits" by drinking a pot of ale
every three hours. Pyrnne was perhaps
wise not to dine, which meant to lunch
in those days, and implied a very heavy
meal. But the munching of rolls all aay
find the "good supper" were questionable.
His style was very caustic; perhaps be
cause of the misrule of Charles I, out
possibly, also, through dyspepsia, which
also had so disastrous an fnfluence on tne
literary temper of Thomas Carlyle.âBrit

BECKER WOULD
ADD MURDER
TO HIS CRIMES
Artist Stirs the Venom
Within Him.
FORGER CREATES A SCENE
ATTEMPTS TO HUBL A HEAVY
GLASS INKWELL.
Attorneys Opportunely Interfere.
One Accepted Juror Challenged
and Five Added to
the List.
The evil nature of Karl Becker, "prince
of formers, " manifested itself yesterday
as it has not done since his arrest. The
aged manipulator and raiser of bank pa
per became angry when a newspaper ar
tist sat beside him and endeavored to
transfer his features to paper, and had it
not been for the timely interference, of
the attorneys Becker might have added
murder to his list of crimes and the ar
tist would have been the subject of the
addition.
During the morning session the time
was occupied examining talesmen, and D.
Brune was accepted as a juror. In the
afternoon Becker took his seat by the
side of his counsel. He was evidently
unstrung and frequently shifted his po
sition and toyed nervously with a heavy
glass Inkstand on the desk. Again he
would^init his brows and leer at the
jurors and then settle back for a mo
ment's meditation.
While thus employed he discovered that
an artist was busily employed sketching
him. lie changed his seat and placed
his hand over his face so that its lines
could not be followed. The artist changed
his position likewise and finally, seeing
that the prisoner was becoming angry,
indiscreetly approached him and stated
that he hoped he (Becker) would not get
angry, as n0 harm was Intended. Becker
wh :i !ed In his seat and said that no man
coi;d sketch him. Becker then turned
and in a gentle voice informed his coun
sel. Attorney McPike, that an artist was
worrying him. McPike did not answer,
but continued examining talesmen. Then
Becker lost his temper, and seizing the
inkwell- half raised and was about to hurl
the heavy missile at the head of the ar
tist, when Acting District Attorney
Hinckle quickly rose and started toward
the frenzied forger. McPike also turned
and before Becker could accomplish his
purpose the inkwell was wrested from
Becker's grasp. "With lips twitching with
anger "the Dutchman" took his seat and
Attorney McPike informed the court that
his client objected to being sketched.
"Very well, if the prisoner objects,' said
Judge Wallace, "the artist will kindly de
sist. This closed the incident, and Becker
settled down, his face flushed with sup
pressed indignation or Joy over vanquish
ing the artist, it is not known which.
L. Lazarre, who was accepted as a juror
Thursday afternoon, was called after
Becker's anger had somewhat subsided
and questioned upon his relationship to
Police Sergeant Llndheimer. Lazarre ac
knowledged that his brother was married
to a sister of the wife of the sergeant
named, and the juror was promptly chal
lenged. The examiitatton frtfen continued,
and at the close of the\day's proceedings
W. Olsen, Fred Walker. Robert Moore
and ~Fred Dassonville had been accepted
as jurors. The following jurors were ex
cused during the d#iy for various reasons:
C. W. Kenltzer, Joseph Robinson, H. E.
Pennell, W. F. Harris, S. Aaron, A. R.
McFarland*C. C. Carlton, F. W. Twiggs
and L. W. Rea.
As several hundred talesmen have either
been excused or examined and challenged
since the third trial of the case opened.
Judge Wallace at the adjournment of
court yesterday afternoon appointed Ben
jamin Solomon, clerk of the court, elisor
to summon talesmen to qualify- as jurors
to-day. Twenty Jurors were summoned Dy
Solomon, and to-day they wilr be ex
amined, and it is hoped the jury can bo
completed. ____________
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
PENSIONS â M.. City. This corre
spondent, in a letter of inquiry, says:
"A woman had a husband and a son
â who served in the War of the Rebellion.
She was entitled to a pension from the
Government. I claim that as the widow
she was entitled to such pension and
that as the mother of the boy she was
entitled to a pension as both died in the
service of their country. She married
again, and I claim that while marriage
cut off her pension as a widow she was
still the mother of the boy and entitled '
to pension on his account. Am I right
'The pension laws say that no one can
draw two pensions. A widow and moth
er must elect how she will take the
pension, on account of her late husband
or on account of her late son. As a wid
ow she has a right to a pension on the
husband's account and that pension
ceases on her remarriage. A mother is
assumed to be dependent on her son,
within the meaning of the law at the
date of his death if she has no other ad
equate means of support than the ordi
nary proceeds of her manual labor and
the contributions of said son or of any
other persons not legally bound to aid
her in her support. On the remarriage
of any widow, dependent mother, or de
pendent sister having a pension such
pension shall cease.
CANNOT BE ANSWEREDâ C. T. S.,
Red Bluff. Cal. It la Impossible to fur
nish answers to the following questions
for the reason that there are no statis
tics on the subject: "What is the total
number of persons killed, wounded and
missing in all the wars that ever occurred
from the beginning of man to the present
time? How many deaths have been
caused by whisky? What is the annual
.. death rate caused by whisky?" For years
physicians and persons interested In tem
perance have been trying to collect sta
tistics that would show how many deaths
result from alcoholism, but as -yet have
not been able to obtain satisfactory re
sults.
NO MORE CONTRACT MARRIAGESâ
D., Guerneville, Cal. The law of the State
of California no longer recognizes con
tract marriages. If a man and woman
live together without being married and
the man introduces the woman as his
wife it is to be inferred that they have
mutually agreed to live together as man
and wjfe and would come under the head
of implied contract. The law as it now
stands does not apply, however, to con
tract marriages antedating the passage of
the law. You can present the case to the ;
District Attorney of the county, who will
inform you if there is sufficient ground
to warrant a prosecution of the parties. â 
ANNUITYâ L.. S., City. In life insur
ance parlance "a simple annuity policy" i
provides that in consideration of the pay- ;
ment at one time of a specified gross sum
the company will pay to the annuitant a
stipulated sum annually, either for a
stated term or during life. A "survivor
ship annuity policy," sometimes taken by
I one partner for another by a debtor for
| a creditor, and otherwise for a business
security, guarantees the payment of a
stated sum to the person named by the
person taking the policy, during the peri
od in which the nominee survives the In
sured.
CHARACTER SONGâ M. E. Q., Auburn.
Cal. If you have written the words of a
character song, and the words have been
set to music and you have not the means
to have the same published, have your
song copyrighted to protect your rights,
then submit it to a publisher of music â
there are several in San Francisco. If it
has any merit and is likely to prove pop
ular and a good seller you will have no
difficulty in having it published.
THE CONSTITUTIONâ S. A. M., City.
One of the principal defects of the ar
tidles of confederation was that there waa !
no provision for amendment except by the
unanimous consent of. the thirteen States.
Three proposals of amendments failed to
receive the unanimous consent, therefore
the convention of 1757 was summoned and
it framed a new constitution. If you will
read the constitution you will see what
the â  scope of the first ten amendments
were. The constitution went into opera
tion by â  being ratified by the different
States, nine being sufficient for its estab
lishment between the. States ratifying it.
A VALUABLE HALF-DOLLARâSub
scriber, Sacramento,' Cal. A half-dollar
of the United States mintad at New Or
leans in 1838 is desired by dealers, who
offer from $12 to $25 for one. The partic
ular one. desired has the letter O between
the lower line of the bust and the upper
part of the date. Do not mistake the orna
ment which loops the drapery on the bust
for the letter Ch Half-dollar pieces of that
date without the letter as described are
worth only thxir face value.
CERVERA'S FLEET-J. H., City. If
you will look at the files of The Call
during the .early part of July, IS9B, yo-A
will find accounts of the destruction r?
Gervera's fleet as it attempted to escape
from Santiago harbor. The account of t;-j
naval fight, as detailed by "Fighting Bob-
Evans of the lowa, which was published
July 9, Will give you a good idea of
the movements of the ships and the dis
covery of the Spanish vessels.
SUPERVISORSâ A. S., City. Supervis
ors in the city and county of San Fran
cisco are elected under the provisions of
the act of March 30, 1872, which Bays that
"Supervisors shall be elected by a plu
rality of all the votes cast at an election
for such in the city and county of San
Francisco." The twelve receiving the
highest number of votes are declared
elected, as they are elected from the- city
at large. '
A WOMAN'S RIGHTSâ N., Oakland. A
wife in California nas the risrht to,dis
pose of her individual and separate prop
em- as she sees fit, without interference
on the part of her husband. If she has a
nephew living in St. Louis, Mo., or else
wbere she can deed a piece of property,

' CAUGHT IN A PAMPERO.
The British ship Lancing, which arrived from Swansea yesterday, had a terrible experience off the
River Platte. She was bowling along before a stiff northwest breeze when, without a moment's warning, the
wind shifted around and blew with terrific force from the southwest. Sails were blown from the bolt ropes and
for a moment it looked as though the stout ship would go down stern first. She was finally got before the
â wind and started away bows under in a mad race against time.
WINTER FOOTBALL
PROJECTS NOW ON
AN ALL-CALIFORNIA ELEVEN
FOR THE EAST.
The University of Wisconsin Team
May Come to This City and
Play Berkeley and the
Olympics.
There are a number. of winter football
projects afloat, some of which should be
realized before the end of the year. The
most bizarre of all is the intention of
Howard P. Taylor to take an All-Califor
nia team East to play with representa
tive college teams in New York on Christ
mas and New Year's days.
Taylor has been giving considerable
labor; time and attention to the forma
tion of a California eleven w^hich would
represent the pick of the football athletes
of the coast. He has his men selected
and conditions made with the railroad to
transport the chosen few to the other end
of the continent, if the plan prove feas^
ible. The All-California team of Taylor's
selection will be made up as follows:

RHODES BORDEN
IS FOUND DEAD
Superior Court Judge Expires in the Bath
Room at His Residence of Rush of
Blood to the Head.
JUDGE RHODES BORDEN of the Superior Court was found dead in the bath
room at his residence. 424 Scott street, at 8:15 o'clock last evening. The im
mediate cause of death was a rush of blood to the head.
Judge Borden iiad.been in poor health for some time, and for the last week
had frequently complained of not feeling well. He refused to take a rest, how
ever,; and yesterday held court as usual, remaining on the bench until the regu
lar hour of adjournment, hearing the evidence in the case of Lee Poy, charged
with assault to murder. He appeared to be in good spirits and even cheerful in
court, but wfcen he reached home he again complained of feeling badly.
â¢ About 8 o'clock he stepped into the bathroom and locked the door. A moment
later the servant girl was startled by the crash of a falling body. She was unable
to open the door to the bathroom and called *a neighbor, who forced an entrance
and found Judge Borden lying lifeless on the floor, with blood flowing from his
mouth and nostrils. Dr. Charles W. Card, 502 Devisadero street, was hastily
summoned and a message was dispatched to Dr. J. Stow Ballard, Judg Borden's
family physician, at 610 Hyde street. Dr. Card arrived in a few minutes and was
soon by Dr. Ballard, who was accompanied by I. L. Borden, but death
had been instantaneous, and the efforts of the physicians were dir' ted to re
lieving the aged mother of the deceased, who was prostrated by the shock and
is now in a critical condition. â  .
Judge Borden was born in Alabama. He came to California with his parents
in 1869, locating in Fresno County. In ISSI he came to San Francisco and entered
Hastings Law College, being at the same time employed in the office of Garber,
Thornton & Bishop. He was graduated from the law department of the Univer
sity Of California in 1884 and immediately began the practice of law in this city.
Judge Borden was a Democrat and always took a deep interest in politics. Two
years ago he was a Democratic, candidate for Superior Judge and was defeated,
but upon the resignation of Judge Slack, about a year ago, he was appointed to
the vacancy on the bench by Governor Budd. At the recent election he was a
candidate for Judge on tne ticket nominated by the Democratic committee of
One Hundred. He was elected after a hard fight.
Judge Borden lived with his mother, widow of the late Dr. Joseph Borden.
Three brothers and a sister also survive him. They are I. L. Borden, superin
tendent of the artesian water works of Alameda; Sheldon Borden, a lawyer in
Los Angeles; Joseph Borden, a farmer in Fresno County, and Mrs. J. o .Hara
Cosgrave of this city. The latter was married only ten days ago, and spent her
wedding night in the Baldwin Hotel, narrowly escaping death wnen that hostelry
was burned.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1898.
Sheehy and Pringle, tackles; Womble and
Craig, ends; Moirphy, quarter; Hall and
Smith, halves, and Fisher, fullback. This
team is drawn from the two colleges and
the Olympic Club, and is perhaps the best
aggregation of football talejjt attainable.
The more feasible project'Ts to bring the
team of the University of Wisconsin out
for the winter months. That eleven has
met the best of the middle West and has
come off the champion. Before Thanks
giving day negotiations were pending be
tween that college and the University of
California for a game in San Francisco
on Christmas. The terms demanded by
the Wisconsin kickers include an expense
guarantee, but to this Manager Brown of
California does not wish to accede on ac
count of the uncertainty of the attend
ance. He is willing to give a big percent
age of the gate receipts. Whether this
will be satisfactory to the Wisconsin men
is yet In doubt, as. he is now awaiting a
reply to his last telegram. The Univer
sity of Chicago eleven is also one of the
big teams of the middle West and' it may
be induced to come to the coast during
the winter.
Should Stanford and the Olympics fol
low the University of California in this
venture there will be three big games dur
ing the holiday weeks. The Olympics are
willing to give the possible visitors a
game, and this will make at least two
matches in case terms can be satisfactor
ily arranged.

Private Moffltt, who has been serving
a sentence of three years at Alcatraz,
escaped from the guard at the Presidio
Thursday afternoon and is still at large.
Moffltt at the time he took his departure
was acting as cook for a gang of slxten
military convicts from Alcatraz, who
had been detailed for work repairing
roads at the Presidio. After the mid
day meal he was left alone temporarily
while the guard was busy lining up the
prisoners, preparatory to resuming work
on the roads.
Moffitt took advantage of the opportu
nity to make himself scarce, and al
though his absence was almost immedi
diately discovered, he had made such
good use of his time that no trace of his
whereabouts could be learned. A detail
of eight men searched for him all the af
ternoon and night and all day yesterday
without success. It is not believed that
he can long evade the searchers, how
ever, and if he is captured he will have
to pay dearly for taking French leave.
He had but nine months of his term to
serve, but the punishment usually pro
vided for attempts of this character is
severe, and in the case of Moffitt will
probably be a year or two additional
tacked on to his term.

PAY ROLLS OF

RENTAL OF THE NEW DEPOT
COLLECTORS WHO DRAW PAY
BUT DO NOT COLLECT.
The Harbor Commission Is Not Well
Advised as to Interest Ac
count and Bono. Re
demption.
Two sessions of the Senate Investigat
ing Committee were held at the office of
the Harbor Commissioners yesterday.
Expert James W. Reid was on the witness
stand throughout the forenoon session.
He responded to Inquiries relating to cost
and measurement of material used under
the revised specifications for the
construction of the ferry building.
The questions were propounded by
Contractor Bateman. The information
elicited were jotted down by the contract
or, who will endeavor to show that the
expert's report does not give proper credit
for work performed and material sup
plied.
When the committee met after recess
General Dickinson, chairman, called J. J.
Keegan, secretary of the Board of Har-
bor Commissioners. The chairman had
before him a typewritten list of all the
names on the payroll of the commission.
The list also gives the salary per month
or the wages per day of each person on
the roll. The name of the Commissioner
at whose instance the employe was en
gaged is also shown on the list. Many
men are yet on the payroll whose ap
pointments are accredited to ex-Commis
sioners Chadbourne and Cole. According
to the list the Bassett men are out of
season, but the Herold crop is beginning
to come in.
In the testimony of Mr. Keegan the fact
was disclosed that there were collectors
on the payroll who did not collect, but
performed other duties and received pay
for collecting. Mr. Keegan testified that
there were no restrictions on the board in
the employment of clerical force. Gen
eral Dickinson asked:
"When was the custom established of
appointing a man collector and assigning
him to duty in the office?"
The secretary could not answer the
question, but Commissioner Harney said
it began in 18So, when W. D. English was
chairman of the board.
Responding to questions put by General
Dickinson the secretary said that names
of men who worked less than one month
did not appear on the pay roll, and there
fore the roll did not give the full amount
disbursed each month for labor. It was
explained that men working a few days
or two weeks from the beginning of the
month were not obliged to wait until the
25th to get their money.
Secretary Keegan was asked to explain
the item in the last report of the Board
of Commissioners wherein an increase of
$6000 was indicated for wharf cleaning.
Mr. Keegan replied: "The increase was
for cleaning the wharf."
Commissioner Harney, who obviously
fancied that the secretary's response was
deficient in lucidity, explained to Senators
Dickinson and Boyce that when the ferry
building was in course of construction
watchmen and gatekeepers were required,
and that the expense of their employment
was entered under the heading of "ex
pense for cleaning wharves." The increase
was rendered necessary by the construc
tion of the depot.
Another increase of $3400 was accounted
for on the ground of disbursement for
electric light.
Mr. Keegan explained an Increase of
$7000 in the cost of maintaining the belt
railroad. He said the work now demand
ed the employment of day and night
crews, and repairs were constantly made.
The report for the year ending June 30,
1898, showed an increase of general re
ceipts amounting to $17,000, as compared
with the receipts of the year 1897. The
belt railroad receipts In 1897 amounted to
$11 619, and in laM to $13,313. In 1897 the
cost of maintenance was $11,000 and m 1S&8
$18,000. , .
General Dickinson asked several ques
tions with a view of ascertaining to what
extent the revenues of the State had
been increased by reason of the construc
tion of the new depot. He first asked the
secretary to state what rental was for
merly received for the space on the water
front now occupied by the depot.
In a roundabout way the information
was elicited that the monthly rental was
$780 before the depot was erected. It is
now $1556 and will be increased to $1806
when the Mining Bureau and State Board
of Trade are established in the building.
Figures were produced showing the to
tal cost of the depot as follows:
Foundation $344,344 58
Superstructure 691,608 32
Total $1,035,952 90
The unpaid items in addition are: Cro
nin claim, $1500; upstairs work in progress,
$3000, and cost of electric plant.
Mr. Keegan testified that there was no
contract for electric wiring, but that the
plant was being put in by day's work.
The amount expended up to date was
$953Â» and more bills would come in.
Some questions were asked by the
committee concerning the original plans.
Mr. Keegan testified that the plans drawn
by Architect Page Brown included the
foundation and the building. The archi
tect received 2^> per cent on the founda
tion and 5 per cent on the building.
General Dickinson requested the secre
tary to produce at the next session of the
committee a statement showing the
amount paid by the commission in attor
ney's fees, apart from the amount al
lowed, the regular attorney of the board.
The secretary said that the sum of
$4631 was remitted monthly to Sacramen
to to be applied to the Interest and sink
ing fund account. The Harbor Commis
sioners' report for the year ending June
30. 1898, shows the amount jn the sinking
fund for interest and redemption of the
bonds to be $301,000. The amount realized
from the bonds was $607,000. Of this sum
$7000 represented premiums.
General Dickinson called attention of
the witness to the report of the State
Treasurer showing the amount in the
sinking fund to be only $202,525. Mr. Kee
gan said the commission had nothing to
do with the accounts kept at Sacramento.
The commission was not advised con
cerning the State of the funds, the pay
ment of interest or the redemption of
bonds.
"Do you mean to say," said General
Dickinson, "that you are not advised by
the Treasurer Â«or Controller monthly as to
the amount of the credit of the sinking
fund for the depot bonds?"
"We simply keep an account of the
money transferred to the State Treas
urer," was Mr. Keegan's reply.
To account for the discrepancy between
$301,015 forwarded by the commission, and
$202,525, reported by the Treasurer as the
amount in tire treasury, The Call last
night wired to Sacramento for a state
ment from the Treasurer. The reply
shows that there is more money to the
credit of the sinking fund than even the
Harbor Commissioner's report accounts
for.
The statement telegraphed to The Call
sets forth that the cash balance in the
fund is $32,525 65; United States bonds,
$170,000. Two payments on account of in
terest on State bonds, and on bonds pur
chased amount to $284,439 35. The trans
fers from the Harbor Commissioners to
the Treasurer to June 30, 1898â sixty-five
months at $4631 monthlyâ amount to $301,
015. The fnterest on $170,000 United States
bonds, $16,000; total. $317,015.
The difference between the transfers
and Interest received, amounting to $317,
015, and payment on account of bond in
terest and bonds purchased, amounting
to $284,439 35, represents the balance in
the depot fund June 30, 1898â that is $32,
625 65 cash.

DUNN GETS
A JUDGMENT
FOR LIBEL
Hearst's Default Was
Entered.
AN "EXAMINER" PRIZE FIGHT
MADE THE PLAINTIFF PABTY
TO AN ILLEGAL BOUT.
He Objected and Filed Suit for Dam
agesâHearst Pays No At
tention to Legal
Service.
A default judgment in favor of ex-Sen
ator W. J. Dunn and against W. R.
Hearst, proprietor of the Examiner, for
damages in the sum of $25,000 for libel, was
entered in the Superior Court yesterday.
In the summer of 1597 a bare-knuckle
fight took place, or at least was alleged
by the Examiner to have taken place,
somewhere in the wilds of San Mateo
County. That paper, extravagant as us
ual in sensational word painting, pictured
the pugilistic contest as an exciting, gory
event. It had the gladiators of the arena,
with iron hands uncovered, struggling for
supremacy. It was the fight of the cent
ury, if the description was to be relied
upon. Outside the ropes the shouting mul
titude surged, insiJe the blows fell thick
and fast: the duck, the side step, the
swing, the jab, were there, and all tne
while the field ran blood. And by way of
â r.-vtbor dncorlptinn, if not comment, in
the report It was stated that Senator
:. IVY . as timekeeper at the battle,
his watch and call marking the opening
and the close of each round.
On October 11 of 1897 a suit was filed
against Hearst by Mr. Dunn for $85,000
damages for libel. Mr. Dunn was not
present at the fight, as stated by the Ex
aminer, and in fact was miles away, at
tending to his various duties. This fact
he established by a preponderance of evi
dence, and when the Examiner was made
aware that Mr. Dunn did not propose to
let the matter drop, it attempted to adjust
it out of the courts, but withou success.
Then the attorney representing the plain
tiff in the action, as did many others who
had been wronged by the Examiner, anx
iously awaited the return of Hearst.
Hearst finally returned and in the early
part of last month service was made on
him and the suit then began to run. Ten
days was given the proprietor of the Ex
aminer to plead, but he evidently forgot
it, or did not think it worth the trouble,
with the result that yesterday Judgment
for the amount named was entered
against him. Through some legal tech
nicality Hearst may succeed in setting the
default aside and fighting the case out in
court, at least when he sees that time for
delay is at an end be will make an effort
to reduce the amount of the judgment in a
legal fight.
Mr. Dunn, in whose favor he judgment
was entered, is not averse to having his
name mentioned as a patron of any sport
that bears the ring of a legal sport, or
legitimate pastime, but when he was men
tioned as the timekeeper in a contest
tacitly prohibited by the laws of the com
monwealth he objected, with the result
given. â

plied for a divorce from John Koerber,
alleging failure to provide. Sophie H.
Schur has sued Alfred RjfcSchur for a
divorce, alleging infidelitâ¢ as a cause

THE PROTESTS OF THE PEOPLE.
REPORTS from Washington announce that the
President is hearing from the peopleâ remon- |
stranccs against the annexation of the Philip- '
pines are coming in every day, and from all parts of
the country, but mainly from New. England and the
M iddle -States. ' . :
It is not strange that New. England has taken the I
. lead in the contest against the proposed annexation ;
of tropic islands swarming with cheap labor, for in
that section of the Union one of the greatest indus- j
trie?., that of- cotton manufacturing, is already heavily !
. handicapped by the cheap labor competition of the
. mills of the Southern States. The New England
workingmen see very clearly that if wages in North
ern cotton mills have been affected injuriously by
Southern labor, the competition of the labor of the
Philippines will be even more injurious.
In order to obtain the advantage of cheap labor j
a considerable number of New England manufactur- j
ing companies have transferred their plants to j
the South, and others are preparing to follow the j
example. The warning is too plain to be mistaken.
The Boston Post, in commenting on it, says:
'The wages on' which the Filipinos manage to live
are small beyond the conception of any laborer or
operative in this country. How long will it be before j
our industries are taken over there, close to the great
markets of the East, or. perhaps to send back their
products to supply the home market here?"
The danger is perceived by all classes of far-seeing j
men, capitalists and workers alike. On this issue Mr.
Carnegie, the millionaire, and Mr. Gompers, presi
dent of the American Federation of Labor, take the !
same stand. Both have been earnest in their pro- j
tests agajnst the scheme.
Great as is the danger to the workingmen and the
industries of the East, it is even greater to those of
California..- We will be the first to suffer by any com- j
petition that may arise from the use of cheap labor ;
in the Philippines to supply the American demand for
sugar' or fruit or any manufactured goods which that |
' kind of labor is capable of producing.
In a recent address before the convention of the \
National Grange at Concord, New Hampshire, Mr.
Herbert Myrick, after describing the condition of j
h'bor in Hawaii and the rates of wages prevailing
there, said' "Neither the American farmer nor the i
American workingman can withstand the competi
tion of labor at such prices." The shrewd farmers !
of New England agreed with him. Californian farmers i
are not les-s intelligent than those of the East. From '
this State, therefore, and from all classes of people, j
even more than from the East, the protests of the '
people should go to Washington. It is our fight
more than theirs, for we would be the first victims j
of imperialism and coolie labor.

WITH the opening of the 'grand bazaar in Me

â  the tityy art' opportunity is afforded to all citizens for
the enjoyment of the beginning of the Christmas ;
'season' in its dual aspect of a season of Christian
â  benevolence and of joyous merrymaking.
The object for which the bazaar is held appeals to
the best sentiments of humanity. In the helpfulness
oi the strong for the weak, the robust for the sick,
. the! rich for the needy, the prosperous for the suffer
ing, nnd of the general community for children left
without father or mother to. sustain their infancy,
there is td be found a true gratification for both the
giver and the receiver. Even among barbarous peo
'. pies the instinct of this helpfulness is felt, and the
most enlightened and refined nations measure the
' degree, of. their civilization by the extent to which
that helpfulness manifests itself in private and in pub
lic charity.
Jf tKe enjoyable features of the bazaar it is need
' â¢ less to ' speak. Whenever the ladies of San Fran
... Cisco array themselves in festal garments and take
â â  -upon them the entertainment of their friends, there
'. is ever a pleasure for all who have the good
. fortune of admission to the charmed company. The
bazaar, like all other entertainments of the kind, will
be bright with musrc, .wit, beauty and flowers. Had
it. no other function than that of social enjoyment it
would be well worth the liberal patronage of all.
. . San Francisco has repeatedly shown a lavish will
... ingness to support prize-fights. Many a self-respect
ing citizen has paid $20 to see two bruisers play a
. fake and defraud the public.- It is now time to show
â¢. . the better and truer side, of our nature. Let the Char

Franciscan liberality, â¢glowing' with the joy and the
toad will of the Christmas season.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1898.
THE SENATORSHIP.
I-'HE Oakland Tribune deprecates the use of
personalities in the Senatorial campaign. So
do we. Personalities in the sense which we
suppose to be meant by the Tribune have not so far
been used by The Call, nor will they be used in fu
ture.
An examination of a man's personal fitness for the
great office is not using personalities against Item, and
it is due to the State that such examination be made.
The Tribune says: "Throughout the contest there
is no occasion for anything but the friendliest feeling
among bidders for the prize."
That may be true also. If any number of men are
bidding, and the place is to be knocked down to the
highest and best bidder, it is a mere business tran
saction, and there is no room for personal feeling in
bu-siness. â  .
But how is it with the people who are to be repre
sented, with the press which must defend the selec
tion made by its party, .and with the State which has
a reputation at stake in the manner of man sent to
represent it in the greatest legislative body on
earth ?
The bidders may be friendly. Competitors for the
honor, who are not bidders for a prize, may meet and
dwell in amity. But outside these the people are vitally
concerned. The office of Senate is as important now
as in any period of our history. The air is filled daily
with descriptions of the new importance of the Pa
cific Coast, and with affirmations of California's en
larged leadership of this side of the continent. The
era upon which we are entering is one in which the
rrost profound and delicate questions of public and
international law must be discussed in the Senate.
Occasions as great as that which brought on the
constitutional debate in which Webster and Hayne
immortalized themselves are already above the
horizon.
For the highest part in the coming intellectual ac
tivities, the Senator whose place is to be filled is
entirely qualified. The Republican party here and the
State of California will go to judgment on the man
ner of man sent to take his seat. Is it possible that
our party has in its ranks no man of capacity com
parable with his? The roll of Senatorial material has
been called and many have answered to their names.
Many of them have qualities that mark them fit. Some
have none; Is' it necessary to go down the class
marked by a cipher, as having no required qualifica
tions, and pass over to the list marked with the minus
sign and hunt for a candidate among the decimals?
If the push insist upon Colonel Burns, his fitness
must be examined, not in the interest of any rival
candidate, but in the interest of the State and people.
When we enter upon that examination the fairest
mind in the State can find only disqualifications to
discuss. This is as painful to say as is the necessity
for saying it. It is not uttered in rancor, for we feel
none.
To properly fill a Senatorial seat from this or any
other State a man must have scholarly training, some
intellectual grasp of the science of government, a
trained mind, a fair acquaintance with history, and
a practical experience which can apply knowledge to
the concerns of the people. None of these figures in
the equipment and mental assets of Colonel Burns.
A man fit for Senator must have a nice sense of
personal honor, a high regard for his good name,
and this must be proved by his record. Can any evi
dence of it be found in the record of Colonel Burns;
in his former discharge of official duty; in his ac
tion under fire; in his avoidance of vindication of
his honor; in his neglect to make restitution to the
State of thousands that it lost through him?
Has there been anything in his subsequent career,
in his chosen associates, in the pleasures he pursues,
in his part in politics, that need.; reward by the
Senatorship? Why should the Republican party, by
selecting him for the Senate, startle Christopher A.
Buckley with a sense of lost opportunity? He had as
good right, and by reason of his superior manner and
better address a better right, to pass from boss-ship
to Senatorship than Burns has to make the same
transit.
Why should, the Republican party elect Burns Sen
ator and so lose public confidence that before it can
carry California again it will have to follow him in
pleading the statute of limitations? Do Republicans
appreciate the length of time that must run before
that can be?
Viewed from Colonel Burns' point of sight it is
pitiful that these true things must be said. It is piti
ful that his backers must stand silent over his record,
mute to the utterance of his qualifications and pain
fully wincing at the list of his disqualifications. But
the people have not compelled the exhibition. The
people have not called him from his chosen ways to
expose a naked reputation to the blasts of criticism.
The people have not invited him to exhibit all he has
in lack of. merit, preparation, fitness and disqualifi
cation, and it is not their fault that good men feel
like walking backward and dropping the mantle of
oblivion over him.
WORDS SPOKEN IN SEASON.
WHILE some of the Eastern papers foolishly at
tempted to make something of a sensation
out of the report that the bubonic plague had
found its way to San Francisco and existed in China
town, it is gratifying to note that the more conserva
tive and influential journals have been prompt to re
fute the rumor and rebuke those who tried to work it
up into a widespread scare.
The Chicago Journal, for example, in commenting
upon the rumor at its first appearance said: "The fear
that either bubonic plague or Asiatic cholera will rav
age San Francisco, to which a morning contemporary
hysterically gives voice, has about as much sensible
foundation as the fear of an outbreak of some disease
from the moon. There ought to be enough intelli
gence in any wide-awake American community, and
doubtless there is in San Francisco, to save it from
panic over anything of that sort."'
As the Journal very gensibly points out, there is no
really great danger of the spread of Asiatic plagues in
civilized communities where sanitary science is un
derstood and practiced. Eastern Europe is more or
less subject to the importation of diseases from Asia
every year, but invariably the disease dies out before
it gets far. A plague that originates in the burning
climate and amid the filthy communities of the
swarming Orient never spreads any extensive ravage
ir the temperate zone, where cities are well drained
i and a high degree of private and public cleanliness
j prevails.
I The action of the better class of Eastern news
papers in promptly checking this false report is the
more pleasing because the general tendency of the
East is to accept as true any kind of frightful story
about California. The State has been frequently de
picted as a tropic region of earthquakes, droughts,
floods and lawlessness. The plague story would have
harmonized well with what had gone before. We
have,, therefore, good reason to be thankful to the
papers that stopped it as soon as it started.
IRRIGATION OR IMPERIALISM.
ACCORDING to the report of the Secretary of
the Interior there are at the present time
579,368,274 acres of unappropriated and unre
served public lands in the United States, exclusive of
Alaska. Of this area 546,549,655 acres, or more than
94 per cent, are in the thirteen so-called desert land
States and Territories. Of the vacant lands in these
States and Territories it i? estimated that 332,176,000
acres are of a character that may be denominated
"desert" under the law providing for the disposal of
desert lands â that is, lanas that do not produce native
grasses in sufficient quantity to make an ordinary
crop of hay in usual seasons without irrigation.
The amount of these lands in the various States
and the acreage which it is estimated there is a suf
ficient water supply to irrigate are given as follows:

It will be seen from the table that the Government
can by irrigation redeem from desert conditions and
render available for farms, orchards or vineyards
more than 71,000,000 acres, of which 17,000,000 are in
California, and all of them in the vast region of the
Greater West which is so rich in minerals and other
resources that it needs only a good foundation of
Agricultural industry to enable it to compete with the
East in all the elements of prosperous communities.
The people of the United States are rich, but not
infinitely so. The amount of money they can afford
to expend upon great national enterprises is limited.
This being so, no great work can be undertaken un
til after a careful consideration of the cost. The peo
ple have now before them a problem of that kind to
solve. It is the question whether they shall employ
their energies and their surplus wealth in irrigating
the desert lands of the Great West or in conquering,
civilizing and supporting some millions of mongrels
in the tropic islands of the Orient.
There can be no question as to which of the two
would be the cheaper. It will cost us more time,
more money and more labor to establish order in the
Philippines than to irrigate the 70,000.000 acres of
Western land. The land when irrigated will maintain
not only itself, but a thrifty population of Americans,
and pay a revenue to the Government. The Philip
pines, when once subdued, will continue to be an ex
pense. The issue is one of home development against
foreign imperialism, and every argument of economy
is on the side of home.
THE STATUS OF HAWAII.
/""* ONFRONTED, as it will be, by many grave
I problems arising out of the war and calling for
prompt settlement, it is probable that Congress
will be inclined to accept without much discussion
the report of the Hawaiian Commission in favor of
giving the islands a territorial form of government,
with representation in Congress as in the case of
other Territories.
Unless all signs fail, however, the inclination will
probably be balked and baffled in its object by rea
son of the strong opposition with which the report
has been received not only by those who opposed the
annexation of Hawaii, but by many who favored it.
The course to be adopted in the case of Hawaii will
form a precedent almost .sure to be followed when
the time comes to deal with Porto Rico and other
islands which we may take, and if the one is granted
a territorial government, the others will obtain it
also.
The New York Press, a strong jingo organ, fa
voring the annexation of everything in sight, balks
at the proposition, and in discussing the report of
the Commissioners says:
"They have set Hawaii on the way of becoming a
State, and have thereby set Luzon, Mindanao, Min
doro, Panay and the rest of the larger Philippines, as
well as all those West Indian islands which will, ere
long.be clamoring for admission, in the way of becom
ing Statas. For once the principle is established of the
participation of the inferior races of alien dependen
cies in national deliberations the practice can have ho
limit but the interests of such peoples and the ex
igencies of our parties. The test of this assertion will
shortly be at hand. Once having admitted the South
Sea islander, three generations removed from can
nibalism, to the House of Representatives, how for a
moment can we refuse the same boon to his infinite
superior, the Porto Rican?"
It is gratifying to perceive this evidence that even
the most reckless expansionists are beginning to un
derstand the gravity of the problems involved in the
annexation of tropic islands whose inhabitants are
incapable of self-government. When the Hawaiian
bill comes before Congress a good opportunity will
be offered to consider the whole issue of colonial
expansion, and it is to be hoped the opportunity will
not be lost. Speedy action is of course desirable in
most cases, but a measure of this importance is not
to be railroaded through without debate.
It is not every girl who, shooting a man twice,
would put one bullet in the heart . and the other in
the brain. As a feat of accurate pistol practice s this
could hardly have been : excelled. â¢ However, . the
young woman has probably concluded that ; she shot
not wisely but too well. A dead man is said to rest
heavily on the conscience.

HERRIN CAUGHT IN A TRAP.
From the Oakland Enquirer.
At last we are fui -ished some light on the question whether the South
ern Pacific Company is in politics, and more especially whether it is inter
fering in the election of a United States Senator. Mr. De Young and Mr.
Spreckels have told what they know, and the revelation is one of the rich
eat exposures of corporation politics which we have had for many a day.
The Chronicle and Call (otherwise Mr. De Young and Mr. Spreckels) do not
often agree in their statements, and when such pronounced Tivals do hap
pen-to coincide in their statements, it is quite safe to assume that they tell
the truth. So general confidence will be put in the present tale.
The gentle railroad corporation, which is "out of politics," has been going
about in the person of Mr. Herrln. its chief counsel and official politician,
offering humble newspaper men the privilege to "name the next United
States Senator." Mr. Herrin made that -offer to Mr. De Young and also to
Mr. Spreckels, but, according to the views of. both gentlemen, this overture
was only thrown out as bait for gudgeons, because while pretending to
name the candidate for Senator. Mr.- Herrin all the time had his own can
didate, or, rather, the railroad's candidate. When the two editors got to
gether and cornered the chief counsel, he admitted this by blurting out*
"Colonel Dan Burns is the railroad's candidate."
This is pretty good testimony to the railroad's relation to politics but it
is not all. According to Mr. De Young, the railroad company contributed
money for the election of men to the Legislature, and did it through Burns
Moreover, Mr. De Young specially charges that "the political managers of
the Southern Pacific Company and Burns have woVked together during the
whole of this campaign with the end in view of securing the election of
Burns to the United States Senate." So the railroad has political managers
selects candidates a long time in advance and contributes money for their
benefit.
* AI L Of â¦ tl l 1 Is very funny-Mr Herrin caught by the spring of his own
trap, the tables turned, the biter bitten, the chief s political manage-- of the
corporation caught. In the open an i trying, to break for. -cover/but unable to
dp fso because ' his coat tails ? are ;; held in 5 the â  grasp iof t two ; husky > editors.

V The home has fallen upon evil ways of
: late, in a financial sense, and after having : i
tried in vain to dispose of the property
â  the trustees- find their, funds practically
exhausted and only one recourse. . left â to
close the institution. Three times they
; have offered to give the property to the
v city outright, and twice the deed has been
. made out and attested, but each time the
Supervisors have refused to accept it.
.; Once they agreed to take it On condition
..that the trustees also turn over what
.cash they had on hand, agreeing to oper
.. ate it as long as the money held out, but
> they distinctly stated that there was no
Â hope of appropriating city funds for its
..maintenance. The trustees concluded to
'â ':.. run it themselves as long as they could,
.bo the offer was withdrawn. â¢
Next it was decided to sell the home for
,:. what the permanent improvements cost,
a sum approximating $20,000. It was of
fered to the Italian Benevolent Society,
but the offer was rejected. Finding they
could not sell it even at that low figure
(for the lot and improvements are valued
at Â£50,000) the trustees offered to deed it
to the King's Daughters for a hospital,
but that organization did not want it even
as a gift, so now it will be closed until a
purchaser is found for the property. The
present trustees are: H. J. Burns, presi
dent; William Martin, secretary; E. D.
Sawyer, W. G. Badger, J. K. Cooper, John
Densmore and J. W. Butterwortn.
The home is one of the landmarks of
the city. The big brick house on the
northeast corner of Stockton and Chest
nut streets was originally built by a
Frenchman named Piper for a residence,
and became known as "Piter's Castle .
and "Piper's folly." In 1859 the late Judge
Blake, ex-Mayor of this city, negotiated
its purchase and it was turned into a
home for the care and treatment of dip
somaniacs. For many years the home
received municipal aid, but two years ago
the Legislature withdrew this support
and the home has steaaiW run behind.
Where formerly its revenues amounted
to $1000 or more a month they have
dropped to $400.
â¢ .. .As the operating expenses average $700
monthly, it has not taken long to oat up
all -the reserve fund Dr. R. H. McDonald |
failed to steal. McDonald was treasurer j
of the home, and had part of the funds ;
deposited in the Pacific Bank and more in
â¢ the People's Home. He could not be hon
est even with his associates in the ter
nâ . perance cause, and when the banks'/went
under* the home lost every cent It had on I
deposit there. A few thousand dollars |
was in another bank, and this money is
what, has kept the institution open till |
â : now. â¢â â â â .
â¢ During its prosperous days the number â¢
of patients at the home was so large that
It b( ame necessary to build a substantial i
tliree-story frame annex, which is still in i
excellent repair. Since it was opened â¢
: 40.000 patients have been cared for in the j
home, many of whom have been perma- I
nently cured. â¢'.:<â ' â ' : - - 'â¢ , '
The founding of the home was brought
about through Frank Whitney, Chief En
gineer of the Fire Department many
years ago. Back in the fifties Whitney
was foreman of No. 3 Engine and about ;
as hard a drinker as any member of the
department. It was customary for the
firemen in those days to celebrate New
Year's by accumulating a "poem" that
usually lasted a week. After sobering up j
on one of these occasions Whitney, pre- i
pared a roll, and, after signing it himself, j
: circulated it among his associates. It was ;
a pledge to abstain from intoxicants for |
six months, and almost every member of j
the department was in a proper state of ;
remorse to sign it. From that grew the â¢
old Dashaway Association and afterward j
the Home for the Care of the Inebriate.
â¢Whitney continued his temperance work
â¢â¢â until his death, and the Veteran Firemen
'.- are now trying to raise funds to erect a
â¢ monument over his unmarked grave in
â¢ Laurel Hill Cemetery.

are being filled with the products of the loom and of the workshop. Many
intending exhibitors have had their goods at the Oakland Exposition, and
with its close to-day will at once move over here to fit up their allotted space.
The first of the school children's days was held yesterday afternoon, and was
availed of by many pupils. They roarped at will through the Pavilion and lis
tened to the music. This afternoon the children from Franklin Grammar, Adams
Cosmopolitan, Clement Grammar and Cleveland Primary schools will be admitted
free of charge, both afternoon and evening.
The musical programmes have been selected with great care, and embrace
many popular numbers. Miss Pearl Noble, the celebrated cornet soloist, will play
both afternoon and evening. A feature of the evening performance will be the
"Greater America" march, composed by Miss Nina Ch. de St. Hubert. She will
lead the orchestra, and will be assisted by a chorus of forty voices.
In addition to the orchestral selections last night. Miss Lillian Sprague Cop
ping, the contralto, sang two numbers, "Answer," and for an encore*, ''You," with

ALL THE UNION MEN
WILL SOON UNITE
TWO CENTRAL BODIES ARE ;
ABOUT xJ COME TOGETHER.
The Labor Council Wants the Gov
ernment to Build a Railroad Be
tween Kansas City and
San Diego.
For years there has been an under
ground internecine fight between the two
central labor bodies of this cityâ the La
bor Council and the Building Trades
Council, but it now appears as though
the hatchet is buried and in the future
both bodies will work together.
A few weeks ago a committee was ap
pointed by the Labor Council to "sound"
unions affiliated and see what the senti
ment was toward amalgamation. The
committee, after due deliberation, pro
mulgated the following plan: "It will be
best for both councils to retain their
present identity. In view of this fact, we
have visited both the Building Trades |
Council and the unions affiliated with It, .
and find that the general sentiment is
toward amalgamation, with its conse
quent centraliza'tfOÃ of power. . We have
not yet fully completed our plans, but ]
with the co-operation of the Building |
Trades Council a scheme will ' undoubt- I
edly be devised by which both bodies may i
work in harmony without the obliteration
of either."
A proof of the good feeling existing be
tween the two bodies was the action at
last night's meeting regarding the trouble
at Central Park. A cyclorama is being
erected there by a man from San Jose.
The men are being; overworked and
underpaid. The Building Trades Council
has called all its men off the job, and its
action practically means a boycott of the
place after it is formally opened as a t
place of amusement. This has. already
been called to the attention of the public. !
A committee from the Building Trades
Council appeared before the Labor Coun
cil last night and made a plain statement
of the case. The result was that the lat
ter body decided unanimously to v.-ork in
harmony with the Building Trades Coun
cil and boycott the place if necessary. Jn
connection with this matter all parties i
wish it to be known that the steeplechase i
now in the course of construction on the
same grounds is a union job throughout^
Union men are being employed at union,
hours and at union rates-
Other business of the Labor Council con
sisted of the adoption of the following
resolution: â 
Resolved, That the suggestion of General
James Longstreet that the United States Gov
ernment construct and operate a doable track
railroad from Kansas Cfty to San Diego 1b
worthy of the immediate attention of Congress
and that this council indorses the suggestion.
The resolution will be at once forwarded
to the officers of the American Federation'
of Labor and will probably receive Imme
diate attention from that body, as any
thing emanating from it is considered as
voicing the sentiments of the laboring
men of this coast. :

AN EGYPTIAN DINNEB.
Grace Methodist Church Resurrects
Ancient Mummies With Q-ood
Effect.
A dinner of four thousand years ago,
4ated at a period when knives, forks, nap
kins and finger bowls were commodities
unknown and unsought, was given in the
parlors of Grace Methodist Church on
Capp and Twenty-first streets last night
by the ladies of the church and their
friends. The object of the antiquated meal
was for the purpose of raising funds for
the benefit of the Mission branch of the
Young Men's Christian Association, which
is located on Mission street, between Nine
teenth and Twentieth streets.
The affair was a decided success and the
ladies, particularly Mrs. Nolte, under
whose management the dinner waa got
up deserve credit for the pains taken in
the interest of the society for which the
benefit was given.
The following programme was faithfully
carried out:
Piano solo. Miss Nolan; pantomime, dinner
In Egypt 4000 years ago. (Arrival of late guests;
removal of sandals; offering the lotus bloom;
coming of musicians; worship of mummy; the
vocal solo, Mrs. Stadfeldt; reading in
costume, Cleopatra's dream. Miss Hettie Cor
lett; piano duet. Misses Howard and Allen;
"Dance in the Ruins of, Karnac (after J. F.
Porteal's picture). Miss Flora Bowley; vocal
duet Mr. "and Mrs. W. Stadfeldt; wedding pro
cession, bride, Mrs. Leek; wrestlers, E. Per

ness and displacement of the womb. â  -
"I could not sleep at night, had to walk j
the floor, I suffered so with pain in my
side and small of my back. Was trou-
bled with bloating, and at times would
faint away; had a terrible pain in my
heart, a bad taste in my mouth all the
time and would vomit; but now, thanks
to Mrs. Pinkham and her Vegetable
Compound, I feel well and sleep well,
can do my work without feeling tired;
do not bloat or have any trouble
whatever. .

than marvelous, all conditions considered. He
only 'shot : part of two days . on the preserves j
of the CShIBS Gun Club ; and- bagged sixty, !

mallard districts. mostly lle.inÃutte and Colusa

The Pujol brothers. Jerome and Adolph, and
John Chambers of Knights Landing, ' recently
made . a three, days' hunt in . Sutter County,,
during which they bagged over 200 birds. : Mcst
of their ' shooting was done In the . vicinity of

The big lake on the Nelson tract, which is
part of the Woodland Gun Club's preserve, was
dry for several months, but during the last
two weeks water from Willow, slough has been
slowly running into it. . Birds are coming in
gradually, but blinds have. not. yet been ar
ranged, and shooting is attended with much In
convenience. There is not: likely to be any.
good shooting until after- the first big rain.'
In the meantime the members 'of the club are
becoming decidedly impatient: -.: â  . . â  â  .-
A few market hunters, are' doing â  a little
shooting over decoys on the â  Sacramento " and
Feather rivers. During the middle of the day
and sometimes late in the afternoon the ducks
remain on the river, something unusual for this
part of the State. This is due to the lack of
water in the sloughs, lakes, and marshes. They
congregate in very large bands,- but are very
wary and the .cleverest' hunters cannot get
within shooting distance, of them. the use â 
of decoys and blinds they are: sometimes lured
within range of favorable points on the river
banks. These ducks leave the river for the
train fields as soon as darkness comes on. '

, The Audubon Gun Club- of: Buffalo : has
nit upon -a novel idea, the object of which
Is to _ create -an active interest in â¢ trap
shooting. The new idea may be called a
4i p a , b "baer - â¢â â¢shoot,"- and. is conducted on
the following lines: The dub. announces ;
its grab-bag event .and Invites its mem- j
bers and their friends to attend. The con- !
ditions are fifty -targets per. man,- $1 en
trance, a fee that fully pays for the tar
gets hot at. There is, however, another
entrance fee, and . that is the condition
that each contestant must furnish one
prize the value of which is not to exceed
$1. Each prize is taken by the club com
mitttee, is numbered and then- marked
â with the donor's name.:. The race is then
Bhot out and thd scores arranged in order
of merit. The highest score . entitles its
maker, to the first draw- from a hat in 1
â which are . numbers corresponding - with
the numbers on the. prizes. "Whatever
number a man' draws he is. entitled" to
the . prize marked with 'â  that- number.
Sometimes a man gets back his own prize
and in such case he is the subject of much
good-natured banter. There is plenty of
amusement- to- be derived from opening
the prizes, etc., and the man who has per
haps only expended 60 or 70 cents on his.
prize feels more than ordinarily cheap \
when he. draws a fine knife or some other
prize that is worth : the full dollar. As a '
means of obtaining an afternoon's amuse
ment, the "grab-bag" shoot is a good idea
and is likely to-be tried in more-places
than Buffalo. " â¢ â  â¢
CLOSING OF ENTRIES
FOR ALL-AGED STAKE
The entries for the California Collie
Club's specialty show in Oakland closed
on Wednesday last. The show will un
doubtedly be a success, and the innova
tion of judging tollies by the score card
â will draw many visitors. Mr. Stewart has
been indefatigable in his efforts to secure
a large entry.
The entries for the all-age stake will, by
resolution of the directors of the Pa
cific Coast Field Trial Association, close
on the 15th inst.
The cups and other trophies offered as
prizes for the winners are now on exhibi
tion in Shreve's window in the Crocker
building.
Two of the candidates for the stake are
dead, and the sympathy of all sportsmen
will be extended to Air. Schumacher of
Lob Angeles, the owner of the canines.
The dogs in question are the English set
tor <1>- Valionte. and the almost equally
â well known English setter bitch. Rowena.
The former died of lever and the latter, it
is supposed, of grief at the loss of her
mate, as ne other cause existed.
Los Angeles is the home of another
fancier who has suffered the loss of his
dogs by death. "W. R. Murphy's fox t. r
rier bitch Snowfiake died, and her Utter
of puppies, by Aldon Swagger, followed
her to a premature end.
K. Bryon of Alameda ha.s rescinded his
Intention of sending his great dane. Queen
Olga. p:apt to be bred to Champion San

her to one of the local cracks, probably
to George L. Bralnard's Don Caesar.

THE FIELD OF SPORT
PITCHER HUGHES
WILL
TWIRL SUNDAY
"Jimmle" -Hughes, the great Baltimore
find of last season, will pitch for the Gilt
Edges Sunday at Recreation Park, The
news- will undoubtedly be hailed with
great delight by those interested and
those who watched the career of this
young man last year. It is expected that
the banner crowd of the season will be
present, and in view of the fact that such
a wondrous star is to be presented I can
hardly fancy any lover of the national
game remaining home under such entic
ing circumstances.
It has been a long time since Hughes,
the idol of Baltimoreans, appeared on a
dianiond in this immediate vicinity. Those
of us who saw him last at Central Park,
pitching as an amateur, little dreamed at
the time that the boy possessed the abil
ity to., shut out the Bostons and "play"
with various other teams of the major
league. We considered Him v. good man
in his class; but few predicted that he
would meet with Such great success- in
the far East. The boy surprised us all,
however, yet the surprise was surely an
agreeable one. When he twirls on Sunday
it is said another big surprise will be ion
the programme. However true mis may
be, I wish to state that it would be un
just to expect Mr. Hughes to pitch any
shut-out games. To do this it requires
practice and condition, and while Hughes
may possess both the qualities in a de
gree, still it cannot .be expected that he
will give such an exhibition as marked
hia famous career in the East. Let us
rest contented over the fact that we are
to see him pitch. What difference does
it make to us whether he lets a team
down with no hits or permits, them to
make twenty-five? We simply want to see
the boy that made, such an excellent
showing among the big leagues, and those
fans who do nothing at a game but roast
want to reserve their ammunition and be
satisfied with whatever order of work Mr.
Hughes is Capable of giving after such a
long rest.:
The Altas will journey to Napa on Sun
day to try conclusions with the Aldcn &
Levisons of that city.
The Altas are playing in the Pacific
Coast Minor League, '; but on account of
the bad condition of the grounds at Elm
hurst they cannot play their scheduled
game, and have succeeded, after much
inconvenience, in securing a game at
Napa. The Altas. claim ..ne amateur
championship of .California; having de
feated the Golden Gates, who were up to
the time, of their defeat -the acknowledged

The annual meeting and election of of
ficers of the California Associated Cycling
Clubs will be held this evening at 8 o'clock
at the Olympic Club. : There will undoubt
edly be a large attendance of delegates,
as a .great deal of interest is being taken
in this year's election, and there will be
quite a contest for the control of the as
sociation.
J. J. B. Argenti, W. J. Kenney, P. M.
Nippert and S. G. Scovern have been ap
pointed by President Adams to represent
the unattached delegates. The organized
clubs will each appoint three new dele
gates for the ensuing year, to take their
seats at to-night's meeting, and their per
sonnel will not be known until to-night.
John E. Wing of the Olympic Wheelmen,
encouraged by his recent successful at
tempts at long distance record breaking,
I will try for all short-distance marks up to
and including one mile at the San Jose
track to-morrow, paced and unpaced. Most
of these short records are now held by
George P. Fuller, who made them about
two months ago.
Racing' itien are much pleased at the
prospects of a big meet at San Jose by the
Garden City Wheelmen on Monday, Jan
uary 2, 1*99, as told in The Call yesterday.
1 he programme as announced Is an inter
esting one, and should furnish not only a
good day's sport but a good chance for
borne of our speedy "riders to again demon
strate their abilities in that direction.
Interest in the Cycle Clubs' Baseball
Leagre is still on the increase, and to
morrow's game will attract a large crowd
to the I-iesidio Athletic grounds in the
foionoon. starting at 10 o'clock. The teams
to contest will be from the California
Cycling Club and the Bay City Wheel
men. The Bay Citys head the list thus
far, not hsving lost a game, whereas the
San Franctscos, Californlas and Olympics
have each lost one. The tournament ends
December 18.
The Bay Citys claim to win their ball
games not only by good playing but by
enthusiastic rooting on tfee part of the
spectator members, and Captain Menne
expects a laige concourse of '"rooters" to
morrow. H. W. SPALDING.
EUGENE B. GARBER'S ESTATE.
The Bulk Is Composed of Money and
Railroad Bonds.
The inventory and appraisement of the
estate of the late Eugene R. Garber was
filed yesterday. The property is appraised
in total at $44,974 10. Of this amount $30.
129 10 Is represented by money and $10,975
by bonds of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company o^ Arizona. The half interest
in the firm of Garber & Garber is men
tioned as an asset of unknown value.
Stocks in various mining companies were
scheduled as of no value.
The Window Breaker.
Michael Williams, the shoemaker who
has a penchant for breaking windows in

THE MIDGETS MAY
RACE
SENIOR CHAMPIONS
The members of the Alameda Boat Club
are much gratified at the success of their
representatives at the Long Bridge regat
ta, at â which the creek oarsmen became
the holders of three championships, viz.:
The senior barge, and the senior and jun
ior outrig-ged .skiffs. To celebrate these
victories the friends of the club will give
a performance at a hall in Alameda early
in the new year. The proceeds of the
performance will be expended in enlarg
ing the boat house, which is now quite in
adequate to the demands of the growing
membership. Three years ago the club
had twenty-four members in good stand
ing; now it has more than eighty. The
club house will be remodeled, and a large
parlor, containing a piano and a bilbard
table, will be provided.
The entertainment will of songs,
recitations, etc., and will probably be fol
lowed by a dance. The following have
been appointed a committee to take
charge of the entertainment: W. G. Han
sen, F. S. Cone, Theodore Eisfeldt, D.
Greenleaf and H. Wllhelmi.
Some of the Alameda oarsmen play
baseball now and then, and it has been
suggested that a football game should be
got up for the benefit of the "kickers."
The Alameda senior barge crew will
probably be somewhat changed next sea
son, as Eugene Hadcock, occupant of the
bow thwart, has announced his intention
"Whirlwind Billâ Say Windjabber, this sack-cutting Is a great Invention; It gives a fellow who has a horror of
hard exercise and is too lazy to train a chance to scoop In a good pot once in a while, win or lose.
Professor Windjabberâ Yer dead right, "Windy, old chap. Where would us fat blokes who love easy sailing ever
get off if we didn't get an even cutat the dough bag once in a while? I guess we are as good as Vanderbilt, who
says, the public b. d.
of taking up sculling. It has been sug
gested that the Alameda seniors, as at
present constituted, should row a race
against the South End "Midgets, 1 ' the
tvent to take place on the Oakland Creek,
where a course of any desired distance
can be laid out. and where spectators can
watch the whole race. If a course of one
and a half miles Is decided on, it will be
accurately measured, bo as to make the
record good.
The South End "Midgets," with Gus
Carson (bow). R. Me Arthur (No. 2),
George Bates (No. 3), and Prank Duplis
sea (stroke), are willing to row against
the Alatneda seniors, and will try to bor
row a new barge for the race. This is the
crew which represented the South Ends
at Astoria, and, though handicapped by
an old and heavy boat, had a good lead
up to the turn. The new Alameda barge
gained so much in rounding the stakes
that the "Midgets" were beaten by sev
eral lengths.
Dr. C. C. Dennis, outrigged skiff cham
pion in 1897, goes out frequently for prac
tice, and last Sunday J. Lyons, M. Breen
and others were on th^water. The South
Ends have now enough money in hand
to complete the work on the much-talked
of handball court, and next season hope
to have a light new barge and to make a
strong effort to regain some of the lost
championships. Though the South End
candidate for Sheriff was not successful
at the recent election, two members of
the club became District Attorneysâ H.
Mclsaac of Marin County, and A. Camp
bell of San Luis Oblspo County.
The Arlels have received notice to re
move their club house and boats from
Long Bridge, which is to be torn down.
To-morrow G. W. Phelan will raffle his
skiff at the Ariel boat house at 11 o'clock;
it is as good a racing boat of its ci;uss as
there is on the bay.
The silk flag presented by Mrs. Smith,
wife of the president of the Alameda
Boat Club, to the barge crew, and carried
to victory on five occasions, now adorns
that lady s parlor, and is highly prized by
her as a memento.

HIGH CLASS SPORT
AT THE
INGLESIDE PARK
The managers of Ingleside Park have
made preparations to receive a large
crowd of lovers of good sport this after
noon and to-morrow.
The card arranged to please the patrons
of the park cannot be duplicated. Of the
large numbers of nominations that were
received at the drawing on Thursday
evening, only high class "racers" were
accepted. In fact the officers of the cours
ing sward have wisely concluded that
good sport can only be attained from good
running stock and with that object in
view coursing at Ingleside Park in future
will be of very high quality.
Among the dogs that have been entered
are some "nail drivers" of well-known
fame and of the number of course adver
tised on the programme the talent will
find that picking winners will not be an
easy task simply because the dogs are too
closely matched.
It Is somewhat of a singular coinci
dence that picking winners at Ingleside is
now a most hazardous undertaking, and
in fact it is only those who make a study
of the game and the condition of the con
testing dogs that come out on top at the
finish of a meeting. The drawings have
considerable to do with the success the
club now enjoys. The dogs that arc
classed as being evenly matched are for
tunately drawn to meet in the slips and
as. a ir.atter of fact that means good sport
and hard guessing.
Whatever new scheme the keeper of the
MODERN RING METHODS ILLUSTRATED.
hares has recently developed with the ob
ject of turning out flyers of from two
to throe mile stamp, It goes without say
ing that he has hit the. nail on the head
as the "short tails," during the past
month, have been literally flying over the
grass and making their escape; but not
until after giving their pursuers gruelers
from start to finish.
The coursing to-day will be no excep
tion to the general rule. Good hares, high
class dogs, good judging and able slip
ping is all that * is necessary to attract
thousands to any park, and this is the
order of sport that is offered to patrons
of the leash at Ingleside Park. To see Is
to convince, and doubtless an immense
throng of spectators will witness the final
results of to-day's big stake.
GOLFERS PRACTICE ON
THE PRESIDIO LINKS
There has not been rain enough to cover
the Presidio links with grass, which is
In some spots rather conspicuously ab
sent. There has been a fair amount of
practice play during the past week, but
several of the players have made no re
turns. The following scores were made
last Saturday and Sunday:

D. Pillsbury went round the course twice
in 49 and 48.
This afternoon the regular monthly
tournament for the Liverpool silver medal
for men, IS holes, with handicap, will be
played. The handicap is based upon the
recent performances of the players, the
scratch score being 93. the best score yet
made for 18 holes in a tournament, though
87 is the best on record for the Presidio
links. When the captain of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club returns to this city next
week he will select the team of eight men
to play against the Oakland golf team on
Saturday. December 10. The representa
tives will be chosen from the following:
E. J. McCutchen, S. L. Abbott Jr., Charles
Page, Dr. C. T. Hlbbetts. H. D. Pillsbury
J. W. Byrne, A. B. Williamson, H. Bab

The ladies' foursomes, 9 holes, with han
dicap, and the ladies' driving competi
tion, heretofore set for December 10, will
take place on December 9.

EXCELSIOR CLUB
WILL
NEXT ENTERTAIN
The National, Western and Excelsior
clubs have announced fistic entertain
ments for this month as follows: Jim
Jeffries and Joe Kennedy, in Woodward's
Pavilion, December 27; George Green and
Dan Creedon, Woodward's Pavilion, De
cember 30; Sammy Maxwell and Martin
Denny, December 22.
Patrons of boxing can rest assured of
seeing something in the line of hard hit
ting within the next thirty days that
should certainly tickle the fancy of the
most exacting crank on pugilism. It is a
well-known fact that George Green in
variably puts up a good stiff argument,
and he will certainly need to be in fine
fettle on this occasion, as his opponent,
Creedon, has a record for fast fighting
and hard punching. It is to be hoped,
however, that Creedon is himself again
and that too much good time has not
interfered with his once magnificent con*
stitution. He will be here in the very near
future, and then a line on his present ap
pearance can be taken.
Billy Delaney, who is looking out for
the interests of big Jim Jeffries, is author
ity for the statement that the champion
heavyweight of the orange groves hae
been practicing new moves and has
changed his style of boxing entirely.
"Why, you will be surprised when you
see Jeff strike out now." remarked Dela
ney, as he smiled blandly. "The big fel-
low hits straight from the ' shoulder and
every knuckle counts. You will not hear
of Jim s. thumbs going- wrong again and
if . I m not: very badly mistaken Jeffries
will be your champion heavyweight with
in a year from now." --â¢ "
Joe . Kennedy, the champion heavy
wei?ht â  of.. ..the Excelsior â  Club, will be
handled by Young Mitchell, and it goes
without say ng that Kennedy must be one
of the fast improving kind when Mitchell
condescends to take him under his wing
The sports who delight to witness a bout

SITED FOR STATE'S MONEY.
Directors of the Napa Asylum Fail to
Return a Surplus.
E. P. Colgan, as Controller of the State
of California, applied to the Superior
Court for a writ of mandate to compel
the Board of Managers of the Napa State
Hospital to deliver into the hands of the
State Treasurer the sum of $7450 65. It Is
alleged by the Controller that the amount
named was drawn out of the State treas
ury and is an excess of the sum expend
ed for the support of the institution dur
ing the thirty-ninth and fortieth fiscal
years.
The amount was deposited in the treas
ury of the hospital, and although a de
mand has been made for its return to the
State treasury the Board of Directors of
the hospital, which Is composed of H. H.
Harris, E. E. "Washburn, Raleigh Barcar,
Robert P. Lamdln, A. W. Barrett and C.
B. Seeley, refuses to comply. Hence the.
application for a writ of mandate.
WILL REORGANIZE
THE
SCHUETZEN BUND
The first steps toward reorganizing the..
National Schuetzen Bund preparatory to
the big shoot that is to be held here In
1901, were taken at a recent meeting.
Representatives from all of the principal
rifle clubs around the bay were present.
Thtre are still several clubs that have
not yet affiliated with the bund, but It is
expected that they will Join long befoijf
the important event. The clubs represent
ed the delegates present at the first meet
ing follow:
Sacramento Rifle ClubâJacob Meyer and F.
Ruhstaller; San Francisco Grutll, Schuetzen
Sectlpnâ G. R. Hauser, C. Gut: Red Men's
Schuetzen Sectionâ A. Grleb, William Dress
ier-, C. Bolsdorf; California Schuetzen Clubâ
A. Rahwyler, R. Langer, William Holden, O.
Brenier, H. Gumbel; San Francisco Turner
Schuetzen Sectionâ Captain F. Attinger, J.
Ptraub, L. Brune; Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Clubâ Dr. L. O. Rodgers, D. W. McLaughlln,
F. H. Bushneli; Germania Schuetzen Clubâ E.
Goetz, F. P. Schuster, H. M. Wreden. A.. Jung
blut; Norddeuscher Schuetzen Clubâ William
Garms, J. D. Heise, George Alpers; Deutscher
Krleger Vereinâ Robert Wllnecke, A. Franke,
C. Martizen; Verein Eintracht Schuetzen Sec
tionâCaptain F. Kuhls, L. Schmidt, O. Thiele;
San Francisco Schuetzen Vereinâ L. Haake, P.
B. Faktor, O. Burmeister, John Utschig, N.
Ahrens. John Thode, Captain John Bolts.
The temporary officers elected were D.
B. Faktor, chairman; O. Burmeister, sec
retary; A. Jungblut, treasurer. It was
decided that the permanent officers shall
be elected on next Thursday evening. In
the meantime a committee to makÂ« nomi
nations, consisting of Louis Haake, H.
Wienecke and N. Ahrens, was appointed.
The officers to be elected will be president,
four vice-presidents, recording secretary,
financial secretary, corresponding secre
tary, three shooting masters and five
trustees. There is a warm contest going
on for the position of president, D. B.
Faktor, Louis Haake, Captain Fred
Kuhls and N. Ahrens being mentioned.
There is, however, a desire that this posi
tion shall go to some outsider, not neces
sarily a rifleman, who has ability and
means and who would not be backward
in assisting the bund In a financial way.
The bringing of the national rifle tourna
ment to this city was accomplished by
the representatives of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Club and the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club who attended the recent
bund meeting on the Glendale range. Long
Island, N. Y. From promises made by the
riflemen from all parts of the United
States at that gathering the coming tour
nament should bring to this city many
wealthy people of the East, and possibly
some from Europe. Cash prizes and
trophies amounting to thousands of dol
lars will be contested for by the shoot
ers.
As might be expected in a project in
volving so much responsibility and honor,
dissensions, frictions and jealousies are
sure to bob up. It was so in the first
meeting. The business of .the bund â Is
conducted in the German language, and
when Delegates Dr. L. O. Rcdgers and
D. W. McLaughlin of the Columbia Pis
tol and Rifle Club found that they were
left out in the cold because they are un
able to speak or understand the language
spoken they withdrew. Their contention
is that being a national organization,
composed, of American citizens (although
of German parentage or birth) the busi
ness should be conducted in the language
of this country and not in the tongue of
any foreign country. Those who are of
different mind justify their position by
claiming that English speaking delegates
are in the small majority, and further that
the constitution and by-laws of the bund
specifies that the business of that body
shall be conducted in the German lan
guage. What the result will be remains
to be seen. M. J. WHITE.
A LIVELY SEASON
FOR LAWN TENNIS
There has not been a great deal of play
on the grounds of the California Lawn
Tennis Club lately. Owing to the rain
and the foggy nights the courts have
had considerable moisture on them and
the sun has not been hot enough to dry
them early in the day.
On Thursday George Whitney and J.
Daily played five sets, all of which were
won by Whitney, who was playing in
excellent form. The scores were: 6â3,6 â 3,
6â2, 7â5, 6â46 â 4 and 6â3. Yesterday morn-
Ing the courts were dry and Miss Palmer
and Miss Farnsworth had some practice
games. But the attendance during the
week has not been large. This after
noon there will be a round robin tourna
ment, singles, in which several of the
well known members of the club will
take place.
From this time forward a season of
considerable activity is expected. There
are among the new members of the club
many young people of both sexes who have
taken up the game with enthusiasm. The
winter in San Francisco is, except for
the early hour at which darkness sets in,
better suited for lawn tennis than the
summer, when the strong westerly winds
sweep across the courts and interfere
with the regular flight of the balls. The
dust, too, in summer is a serious draw
back to comfort. Rain is the only
hindrance in winter, and ' asphalt courts
from which the water has been swept
with a squeegee dry rapidly under a
warm sun.
On Saturday, December 17, It Is proposed
to play a series of exhibition gamrs, in
which the Hardy brothers, the Whitney
brothers and other experts will take
part. The exhibition will be for the ben
efit of J. Daily, the court keeper, who
has been most attentive to his duties and
has taken great pains to keep the courts
in good order.

PIGSKIN CHASERS
MEET FOR THE
CHAMPIONSHIP
The "â  plans for winter football on this'
coast are beginning to buzz. . Howard P.
Taylor has been considering a project to
take an all-California team East to play
a representative , eleven In New York on
Christmas ; and New ; Year's days. ! He has
even gone Iso far as to secure transpor
tation from the. railroad-, the payment of
which '. Is to be dependent upon the gate
receipts of the prospective games. It is
Taylor's idea to pick an eleven which will
represent the best we have in the West.
The 0 men whom he wishes to take East,
are- Hobbs, Olympic, center;. Smith,
Olympic, and Fickert, Stanford, guards; .;
Sheehy, Olympic, and Pringle, Califor
nia tackles; â . Womble and Craig, : Califor
nia' 1 ends; Murphy. Stanford, quarter;
Hall and Smith, California, halves; and
Fisher, Stanford, fullback. .
This team would certainly be equal to
anything the West could get together.
The line is exceptionally, strong and the
backs are as good a quartet as could be
collected in the State. Murphy will act
as a kicking fullback and Fisher as full

ager Brown ; offers a large percentage of
the cate receipts, but this does not seem
satisfactory to the Middle Westerners.
Satisfactory arrangements may yet be
made and the great team of the Middle
one game, as it is not- likely that Stan
ford would care to organize for a con
test. The Olympics could be got together
for a game on New Year's day. and by
this means help to continue the winter
season up to the first day of 1899. . .
To-day the championship game of tnÂ»
Amateur Academic League will be played
on the gridiron at Recreation Park be
tween Belmont and the ; Lowell High
School. These games have been. running
since the beginning of â  October and now
the last match of the year is to decide
which team Is entitled to the palm of
championship glory- A large attendance
is expected at the game this morning,
especially from among the college men
who are watching the" material in the
preparatory schools. , â 'â¢> .
Both the Belmont and the Lowell High.
School elevens have clean records, and
when theySiross swords to-day a battle
royal will ensue. Neither team has suf
fered defeat in the scheduled games, but
both lost to the freshman elevens of the
universities, and the Belmont eleven suc
cumbed to the University of Nevada team,
the â¢ same which beat the second â¢ eleven
of Stanford 22â0. ' '.- ,--*"

BOW IN A MILLINEBY STOBE.
Mrs. M. Schneider Alleges Tha;t ShÂ«
Was Knocked Down, Beateti
and Sat Upon.
Mrs. M. Schneider of 1525 Steiner street
appeared before Judge Mogan yesterday
to answer a charge of disturbing the
peace. She is accused of raising a riot in
the millinery store of Mrs. Kahler, 909
Market street, Thursday afternoon.
Policeman Chase, who- made the arrest,
testified that he was called to the store
and found a large crowd blocking Â£he en
trance. Mrs. Kahler and Mrs. Schneider
were both very much excited, and the
former ordered the officer to arrest Mrs.
Schneider for disturbing the peace. Mrs.
Schneider .objected to being arrested and
Chase had to get two other officers to ac
company him in the patrol wagon to the
City Prison. All the way to the prison
Mrs. Schneider fought the officers and at
tempted to kick Chase.
Mrs. Schneider testified in her own de
fense that she went to the store to. see
why a feather had been taken out of her
hat. Mrs. Kahler refused to give her any
satisfaction and ordered her out of the
plaoe.. She refused to go" and she was
knocked down, beaten and sat upon.
The Judge continued the case until to
day to enable Mrs. Kahler and her as
sistants to be present and testify.
Quinine for Porto Rico.
Customs Collector Jackson was notified
yesterday by the Secretary of the Treas
ury that cinchona bark and its alkaloids
or salts, including quinine, are admitted
free of duty at all ports on the island of
Porto Rico. The regulation was made on
the suggestion of the Secretary of War,
who has become convinced that the balmy
climate of Porto Rico is best enjoyed by
the American soldier when under the in
fluence of a shipload of quinine.

David Tenny Was There.
Track Notes.
Jockey J. Shields will probably never
have a narrower escape from stepping oft
Into the.great unknown than he had yes
terday. The auburn-haired rider had the
mount on the narrow-headed brute Sug
den in the two-year old scramble, second
on the day's racing card, and with a big
Held at twelve going into the starter's
liand. As the stretch turn was neared,
with Almoner in the lead, Sugden sudden
ly bolted from the bunch and made rapid
strides toward the outside rail. Shields
was tugging with all his might to pull the
fractious animal up. but without avail.
He broke through the heavy railing, and
horse and boy disappeared down the ten
foot embankment. The rider managed to
escape from the mad leap with a com
pound fracture of the collar-bone, while
thirty yards away the horse was assisted
to his feet without the loss of an inch of
li'.s hairy hide. The accident happened so
quickly that but few of the spectators
were witnesses of it. Shields was taken
tVa hospital, and it will be some weeks
IVifore he can sit in the saddle, again.
Three favorites earned brackets. The
attendance was good, and the crowd had
the pleasure of witnessing two very ex
hilarating reversals.
Not many days age the Calgary wonder,
May \V, started in a race, and her owner,
Don. Cameron, bet on her, getting 6 to 1,
and plenty of it. She was ridden by
Gouin. Somebody didn't like her, for she
ended up beyond the money. Yesterday
the mare was a starter in the fourth
event, for which Paul Uriggs was a piping
hot favorite. The ring laid 3 to 1 about
her, and she won all the way, reeling off
the seven furlongs, over a track a trifle
Plow, in 1:27 flat. Griggs just managed to
beat Rosinante a neck for the place. The
latter mare backed up in the betting for
lack of support. â¢ â

an .underdone corn 'cake when compared
to the flipflap executed by San Venado,

wonder, â¢â ' Not until his master wept over
the smoking ruins of his tavern, and his
few .remaining: gray hairs turned to the
whiteness of the show-crowned Sierras,
did he quit sulking and go out to retrieve
the shrunken, fortunes of the stable. Not
until 15 to ;1; 1 was chalked up against him in

Time. 1:14. Winner. D. A. Honlg's blk. g. by imp. Albrrt-PlaÂ«a. Bad start. Won
easily. Second and third driving.
K<l Oartland was rlddc-n from th'- drop of the hat. Whltcomb ran a splendid racÂ«. The
bad start ruined Outa way's chances.
Lothian colt experienced no difficulty in
winning easily from Faversham. Royal
Fan secured the show.
Pat Dunne's sturdy piece of racing fur
niture, David Tenny, at odds on, annexed
the mile and a sixteenth event without
half trying. McFarlane made a clever
showing under Powell's good handling,
taking the place from Frank Jaubert.
Adam Andrew was sore and unable to ex
tend himself.
The condition of the closing six-furlong
sprint fitted Ed Gartland nicely and start
ing an even money favorite made all the
running, and with little to spare led Whit
comb over the line less than two lengths
in 1:14 flat. _
Track Notes.
The geldings, broodmares and yearlings
owned by W. M. Murry were listed to be
sold at the Occidental Horse Exchange last
evening. The gathering of horsemen was
so limited that after one or two animals
had been knocked down for a song the
others were withdrawn for lack of bids.
Riley Grannan laid against both Tor
sida and Recreation, and the win of San
Venado made a big swelling in his bank
roll.
It has been no secret for months that
San Venado was a good horse. At Los
Angeles during the fall meeting a former
employe of the stable said he was better
than La Goleta over a distance. Yester
day he showed himself a sprinter of high
class, and what the stable has been doing
with the brown horse in the Interim would
make good reading.

THE COMING
NAPA STOCK
FARM SALE
Yearlings at Auction
December 6â7.
HOME OF CANACE AND SEVENS
ENGLISH, AMERICAN AND AUS
TRALIAN STRAINS.
Imp. Crighton and Imp. Idalium
Well Represented â First of the
Get of Imp. The
Judge.
The next big thoroughbred sale of any
importance will be held on the nights of
Tuesday and Wednesday, December 6â7.
On that occasion Kllllp & Co. will sell
at their palesyards, Market street and
Van Xcss avenue, the yearlings con
signed by Napa stock farm, the proper
ty of A. B. Spreckles. In all thirty-one
yearlings will be led into the ring. The
stallions represented will be Crighton,
the Australian racehorse and sire; Ida-
Hum, brother to Sir Modred and Cheviot;
Eolo, son of Eolus and War Song; Gen
eral Miller, Lew Weir, Puryear D and
the stoutly bred English horse The
Judge.
This will be the second annual sale of
this model breeding establishment, and
taken as a whole a grander looking lot
of individuals were never sent to the
market. In the stud imp. Crighton is an
assured success. The past season his
fast but unlucky daughter Canace was
one of the sensations of the Western
turf. Starting thirty-six times she was
six times first, sixteen times second
(beaten noses and short heads by the
crack two-year-olds of the Chicago
track) and six times third, Sevens, an
other of his daughters, even faster than
Canace, a winner in California, went
amiss before being able to show her
worth in the Middle West. Idalium's
most noted performer was Miss Pollard,
winner in two seasons of $3565. Lew
Weir t got the shifty moneygetter Satyr,
winner of a number of races from good
ones; and Eolo, General Miller, Puryear
D and The Judge, bred as they are, will
assuredly make their success in the stud.
The latter is a picture of the model stock
horse, and as the English blood infused
with that of American mares is so much
sought after his sons and daughters
ought to be in demand.
When some two weeks ago a visit was
paid to the establishment by a party of
horsemen it was difficult to tell which
was the better looking of this band of
superbly bred youngsters. Number one
on the eatalouge, Abbieolo, a daughter of
Eolo and Abbie F, was a strikingly
haudsome piece of horseflesh, sturdy and
sensible looking, with plenty of bone and
substance, and looks as if she would
fight every inch of the way.
Balaruc, by Lew Weir-imp. Yaranbee,
has plenty of daylight under him and
looks a money-getter. Bamboulia, No. 5
on the catalogue, much resembles the get
of imp. Brutus. Finely coupled, with a
sturdy pair of shoulders and a bulldog
looking head, this youngster was intense
ly admired by the visitors.
Champion Hose, a brown filly, by imp.
Idalium-Annie Race, looks not unlike
Jingle Jingle the shifty filly racing in
the colors of Jimmy Coffey, and had
many racy looking ways about hc-r. Catu
lus. No. 8 on the list, bears the honor of
being the only Crighton of the sale. He
is a brown colt possessed of great bone
and substance, with line quarters, deep
through the heart, and a set of legs to
stand on that look like pillars In the Hall
of Records building.
"If Florestine," said Superintendent
Shafer, "can step as fast In races as she
can in the fields, she'll get some money."
This one is a daughter of Eolo and Flor
ence B. Foligno, by imp. Idalium, from
the Wildidle mare Folly, is a "better
looker" than her half-sister, Sevens. The
latter was a natural born crackajack, and
only an accident kept her from taking the
measure of the cracks at Chicago.
No. 12 in the catalogue, Fridalium. by
Idallum-Frisa, has a big, honest-looking
eye and is an exact pattern of his sire.
Possessed of plenty of bone he is a trifle
lanky looking, but should later furnish
into a good looking racehorse. Patricia,
own sister to the speedy Misty Morn, is
represented by a racy looking filly, Ida
letta, by imp. Idalium. She is growthy
and there is no reason why she should
not prove a winner.
The son of Idalium and Maria F, latter'
the dam of the star performer Baggage,
wears the odd name of Kickumbob. In
conformation and general looks he resem
bles the game Cadmus, and if as good as
that many-time winner should be a prize.
Lewzara, Idalium-imp. Zara, is a partic
ularly pleasing looking piece of turf bric
a-brac. Large, with plenty of girth, she
will certainly make a hit when led into
the sales ring.
Militouche, so named, is a stylish, mili
tary-appearing chap, a chestnut in color,
by General Miles from Nitouche. In tne
paddocks he can run away from his mates
and has a back that ought to, some day
in the future, see him a crack timber
topper like. his sire. Nemesis, a bay filly,
by The Judge from the Hying Border Las
sie, is blessed with fine shoulders and
hocks and quite as racy-looking as her
dam. And the latter was fast enough to
beat almost anybody's horse at times.
The great four-mile mare, the Austra
lian blackbird Candid, is represented by
a chestnut youngster, a colt by Eolo.
Well set on stanch-looking underpinning*
he has an eye and hook nose that would
indicate him to be a stayer. The first foal
of Victory Pythia, a bay miss by Lew
Weir, is stylish looking and a great fa
vorite with the farm hands. TradaUum
a brown colt by Idalium-Tragic, is one on
which Mr. Shafer, the superintendent is
very sweet. With plenty of size, strong
shoulders and well coupled, he looks like
one that would have his number c.splayed
at the races.
Umaolo, the Eolo-Umatilla filly, is horse
all the way through. A striking proto
type of Sevens, she has square shoulders
not unlike a trotter, broad bone, plenty of
driving power behind, and is an especially
"fine .looker." There will be plenty of bid
ding when No. 27, Zanoni, daughter of
Lew Weir and Cattle Kate, is led into the
ring. This is an exceptionally well fur
nished specimen of the thoroughbred
Stylish appearing, broad back, superb
head and neck, great depth through the
heart and rare good hocks, she looks the
ideal racer. To mention the others in the
catalogue would be merely a repetition of
what has been said of those criticized
above. When Enoch Wishard, the astute
Eastern turfman of the firm of Duke &
Wishard, said, "1 never saw a finer bunch
of yearlings," he expressed all that can
be written in praise of them.
They can be inspected at the salesyard
on Monday, December 6.
I TO TEACH CHIEDBEN KINDNESS.
A New Departure for the Local Hu
mane Society.
The Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children has taken a new depart
ure In line with its humane work. It
proposes to educate tho people through
the children of the community, and thus
reach those who are not In the habit of
giving the subject of kindness to ani
mals much thought. To this end the ser
vices of Miss M. E. McGraw have been
engaged. This lady comes from the
southern part of the State and has been
identified with the work she is undertak
ing. With the assistance and by the con
sent of the Board of Education she will
introduce humane literature Into the
public schools. The reading matter will
be in the shape Of attractive stories, all
of which have a moral tending- to make
the young readers more considerate of
the dumb animals they have or that may
be under their control.
â¢After this branch of the work is start
ed Miss McGraw will begin the estab
lishment of Bands of Mercy in every
part of the city. Organisations of little
folks known by this name have been
created in many parts of the United
States, and under considerate instructors
they have been productive of much good
in "the way desired. Miss McGraw will
soon turn her attention to the Sunday
schools of the churches, and in these in
stitutions she hopes for considerable en
couragement. In her visits to the Sun
day-schools she will deliver interesting
lectures. When the new Board of Edu
cation goes into office the officers of the
society will endeavor to secure permis
sion to have the lady lecture to the chil
dren occasionally. An effort will also be
made to have the board set aside certain
days for the regular teachers to address
the pupils on the subject of kindness to
animals.
CIVIL SERVICE CHANGES.
President McKinley's Proclamation
Creating Consternation in the
Custom House in This City.
A Washington dispatch announces that
President McKinley's civil service order
was about to be issued in a day or two,
and that It was expected to remove from
the classified service 957 deputy collectors
of internal revenue and others.
Collector Lynch said yesterday that the
order would affect in his department
eighteen deputies. Thirteen of them are
in the San Francisco office, and of these
thirteen three are outside deputies. All
the outside deputies are Republicans, he
said, as are also most of the office depu
ties. . Â Â
"There will not be many changes, said
Mr. Lynch. "There are some men in the
office here whose knowledge of the tech
nical details of the business is so valuable
that they are in a measure indispensable.
Mr Lynch declined to say anything fur
ther as to his intentions with respect to
the subject. In the meantime his office
will continue to exist in a state of breath
less agony. *Â«_/.Â«. ,
Collector Jackson said that the order
would affect his department but slightly.
Until the arrival of the full text of the
President's proclamation he declined to
say whether or not he would make any
changes in the personnel of the Custom
House. ___
WRECKERS ARE NOW
MAKING PROGRESS
BALDWIN RTJINS COMING DOWN
AT LAST.
The Work of Removing Debris Is
Expected to Begin Next
Week.
More rapid progress In the work of
razing the Baldwin ruins is now being
made. The wreckers yesterday succeeded
in pulling down a large section of the
Market-street wall. Another gang was
employed in clearing away the debris and
cutting timbers and bolts so the Powell
street side can be hauled down. It is the
intention of the wreckers to remove the
Market-street side down to the second
story and then pull In the other walls.
When this is accomplished the removal of
the debris will begin. Thirty-five men are
now employed, and the force will be in
creased Monday when the digging com
mences. As fast as the debris is dug out
of the interior it will be carted away.
"Lucky" Baldwin has sold all the tim
ber to a concern which will use it for fire
wood. Another firm has bought all the
wood pillars which decorated the hotel,
paying 75 cents apiece for them. Sixteen
chimneys were toppled over into the ruins
yesterday. All the dangerous portions of
the walls will be down by to-morrow
night,. and then a large force will be put
on. Everything of value and the bodies
of the victims which still remain beneath
the debris will then be recovered
Mr. Baldwin has not yet decided what
he will do in the matter of rebuilding.
Pending the formulation of plans for the
future he may make temporary repairs
on the more solid portions of the building
by putting a tin roof over the second
story and refitting the stores for occu
pancy. The construction of a ten-foot
fence around the block began yesterday,
but little could be accomplished, as the
carpenters were compelled to leave work
when the walls were being pulled down.
A Now York corporation which desires
to build a magnificent hotel has made an
offer for the property, but Baldwin re
fused to sell more than half of it. He
thinks he will be able to erect a modern
hotel and will not relinquish his title to
the best property he ever owned until he
is forced to do so. He says he does not
owe over $10,000 exclusive of those debts
which are secured by mortgages, and he
can easily arrange terms with the minor
creditors. Baldwin declares he will not
have a theater In the new building if he
rebuilds.
Bradstreet's circular contains a para
graph that Baldwin is endeavoring to ef
fect a compromise with his creditors.
To protect patrons on the Powell-street
cars from falling timbers and bricks all
the passengers are prevented from riding
under the walls. They are compelled to
alight at the corner of Ellis and at that
point passengers must also embark. This
will be the rule until all danger Is re
moved.
DOLL FETE STILL
IN FULL SWING
LAST CHANCE TO VIEW BISQUE

Dolls Being Quickly Disposed Of at
Fancy Prices at the Private
Sale.
The model doll show still continues to
be the thing for those that set the pace
in all matters fashionable.
The large attendance that "marked the
opening was again in evidence yesterday.
There is something so fetching and alto

Woman's Heroism.
From the Register-Gazette, Rockford, 111.
During the civil war nearly as much
heroism was shown by the women of our
ration as by the brave soldiers. Many a
woman, weeping for her dead son, bound
up the wounds of his suffering comrades,

Corps
whoso aid to the soldier or to-aay, fighting
against the world for a living, is no less
notable than the heroism of the early '60s.
One of the most earnest members of the
corps at Byron, 111., is Mrs. James House-
weart, but illness once put a stop to her
active work. A year or so ago, when she
was nearlng fifty years of age, the time
when women must be most careful of
their strength, Mrs. Houseweart was tak-
en seriously ill. The family physician told
her that she had reached a critical period
of her life, and must be very careful. His
prescriptions and treatment did not bene-
fit her, and other treatment proved un-
availing.
At last Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Paio
People were brought to her notice, with
indisputable evidence that they were help-
ful in such cases as hers, and with re-
newed hope she tried the remedy. Last
March she took the first box of the pills,
which gave much relief. She was de-
termined to be cured, and kept on with
the medicine, until now eight boxes have
been consumed, and she feels like a new

Mrs. Houseweart said: "I have taken
only eight boxes, but I have been improv-
ing' since I took the first dose. I do not
believe I could have lived without the
pills. They certainly have done me more
Rood than any physician or any medicine
I have ever tried."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are sold In
boxes (never in loose bulk) at 50 cents a
box or six boxes for $2 50, and may be had

:. â¢vShlnÃles at the present: time are dull, there
- being but a small demand, as is usual at this
' time' of the year, but the prospects for next
â  reason are excellent. Shingles are quoted at
â¢ retail: Common,. jl*0; fancy, â¢ $2 60; shakes,
ppllt; Jll; .shakes, sawn, $12. . There Is little
-. tleriiarid- 1 for- shingles from the Pacific Coast.
'from Eastern points -.because of the i Inclement
' weather. which prevents repairs â . and â¢ general
â¢ building. -Few shingles were shipped to South
.-em California ports .during the past month,
â¢â â¢but '-the- supply at those points of distribution
â¢ is. rapidly rounding into excellent condition for
Ka-stern shipment in the early spring. ; .
' "The heavy storms general throughout the
" East arid Middle West naturally have an. un- |
desirable effect in lumber trade circles. Rail- j
road .shipments were, interfered frith for a
time, and such occurrences are certain to hap- I
pen at any period during the winter. Between 1
tueh epochs trade will naturally return to the
â normal, but until the spring natural conditions
will not be the rush. : . .
"The: hard-wood : conditions will be lax also
until the early spring, when the excellent pros
pects of to-day should be realized. Quotations
phould be better: in fact, the general lumber !
conditions in California., the Middle West and j

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: '
More than the customary amount of atten-1
tlon has been paid this week to foreign Influ
ence, 'and speculation, while displaying bullish
tendencies, has been more ;or less . Irregular In
Its actual course. The local professional ele
ment has been ranged on the bull side In an
ticipation .of . an agreement by the . Spanish
Commissioners :to the American peace condi
tions. 1 The realization of ; this belief r on last
, Monday found the traders generally disposed to
â  take profits and to work for a reaction. -Lon
j don, however, was : a large purchaser of our
I stocks. and support from that quarter checked
! the recession in prices. On Wednesday, how
1 ever, the taking of J1.000,000 gold from the
IBank of England (or shipment to . New York,
; accompanying a withdrawal of over $2,500 ,
, from Berlin, brought about a sharp rise In the
money market, : and .'caused, foreigners .to \
â¢ change their, speculative attitude and become
sellers of our stocks, i Berlin was credited with
being, largely responsible for this movement '
particularly in connection with the Pacific
stocks, and : for a . short time a somewhat ex
aggerated view of the financial and speculative
i conditions at the German â  capital . passed cur
; rent in Wall ' street. On .Thursday, however,
| the situation abroad became . more settled No
advance . took place, as was feared might be
â  the case, in the Bank of England . discount
I rate, while the rises of money in London and
j of exchange rates here seemed' to allay the
j ,fear of heavy gold withdrawals : to this coun
â  ll y / â¢, Lo . ndon >. ; therefore, repurchased some of
! the stocks which it sold on the preceding day
; and the market here displayed a renewed bull
ish tone, - although the Industrials rather than
' the railroad share list were mainly benefited

NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say:'
Tha business world enters on the closing
month of the year with bo many favorable and
so few depressing features in sight as to leave
little doubt that the year IS9B as a whole must
hereafter furnish the basis for estimate when
comparisons of large business are to be made.
Nearly all obtainable statistics and reports as
to the volume of business point to the present
year having heavily exceeded any former year
in the amount of business done, and though
comparisons as regards prices are not so fa
vurable as in earlier years, notably 1592 and
lStn;,' when quotations of most staples were con
siderably higher, still the expansion in trade,
due to increased population and enlarged for
eign demand for our products, lias resulted in
an aggregate volume of business done consid
erably in excess of any former year.
In the general business world the leading
event of the week has undoubtedly been the
placing ot very larjje orders, estimated at be
tween 50u.00u and 700,000 tons of steel rails,
more than a fourth of the entire country's
annual production, at prices which If not en
tirely satisfactory to the competing rail mills,
are encouraging, oecause they indicate that no
check caused by combination of interests will
be administered to our growing export trade,
which business, coupled with the possible de
mand next year for structural steel lor build
ing purposes, in likely to play a most im
portant part in the government of prices of
steel products generally. Nominal prices of
steel rails show little change trom those rul
ing some time ago, but quotations for Besse
mer iron and steel billets reflect the stimulat
ing influence of the removal of the uncertainty
regarding the placing of this large volume of
rail business.
Foreign demand for our food products has
continued an encouraging feature of the cereal
situtlon, and wheat prices particularly are a
little lower on the week, notwithstanding very
heavy farmers' deliveries and increasing do
mestic stocks. Exports this week are the larg
est ever reported, reflecting partly materializ
ing of early reported business and rartly in
creased foreign buying at concessions earlier In
the week. Corn and oats appear to have tem
porarily parted company from wheat and are
higher on the week on improved speculative I
buying- and enlarged export trade. The ocean
freight situation is slightly easier, and the sup
ply of tonnage shows some enlargement. The
price situation generally is an encouraging
one, and advances largely outnumber declines.
The early arrival of winter weather in the i
South has tended to make smaller cotton crop j
estimates more i>opular. and enlarged specu- \
lative and spot purchases have advanced prices !
for this rtaple. Anthracite coal has been ,
marked up in some markets, largely owing to
cold weather, but there are yet few new de
velopments in the direction of control of out
put. Tin and copper are again active specu
latlvely,- and tin plates reflect the formal
launching of the new combination in slightly
higher quotations. The boot ..nd shoe situa
tion has been improved by the severe weather
lately experienced, as has the outlook for rub
her goods. Leather is steadier and hides are i
higher, an unusual feature at this time of the
year. The recent advance in raw sugar ap
pears to have culminated this week, and a
Blight reaction is shown on reports that beet
sugar Imports f r ,m Europe are likely to heav
ily Increase. Refined is firm. November busi
ness having been very heavy.
The advent of winter weather has tended t r
reduce the demand for building lumber, which,
in some markets, particularly the East, waa de
pressed during the summer because of the in
activity In building. A rather better tone !s>. ,
however, now reported and the opening of the |
now year is awaited with confidence. Recent !
advances in prices In pine and spruce lumber j
are well maintained, stocks In dealers' hands ;
are not at all heavy, and reports both from the :
y3llow pine and cypress producing sections of I
the South and the white pine markets of the j
North and Northwest are that a heavy output
has been as a rule satisfactorily handled. The
hard wood situation maintains all of the
strength previously noted. The domestic wood
working demand is of good volume, while ex
port business is steadily Increasing and prices.
as a whole, are considerably, higher than they
were at the opening of the year.
The general Jobbing trade has been rather
smaller than usual at this time of the year,
and sever? storms in the East have hurt distri
bution but the demand for holiday goods is of
an encouraging volume and promises well.
Business failures are of normal volume, num
bering 212 for the week, against 1512 last week.
250 In 1597, 359 In 1896, 315 In 1895 and 022 in 1894.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW : YORK. Dec. â¢ 2.â R. G. "". Dun & Co.'s
Weekly : Review of Trade will 'â  say to-morrow:
The ' report of failures . ; for the month . of No
vember Is extremely â¢ gratifying because it
shows not only ' a decrease 'In number ; and , a
smaller amount .of liabilities - than â¢". in' â¢ any
month excepting three summer i months since
the monthly record ' began, ' but because 1 careful
analysis shows a striking. improvement both In
the small and In ' the large failures and In
1 nearly : all classes of : Industry "and ; trade. Con
| sidering the failures are â¢ usually smaller in
j summer months than in November the monthly

Nobody can estimate the train for the. Iron
and . steel ' industry which will result from the
past week's ; transactions in steel- rails, which
are said to exceed 7000 tens. The makers hav
ing failed to agree, and to complete the con
solidation under which a- single agency was
expected to sell all the rails for ; domestic use
or for export the Western works entered Into
an agreement by themselveÂ« and fixed their
scale of ; prices at $17 for Pittsburg, $18 for
Chicago and $19 for Colorado,' and the Illinois
steel works are said to have taken orders In a
single week -covering, much the greater part
of next year's capacity. But Eastern concerns
have not been idle and have , taken such large
orders that the i output ;of the year is now . ex
pected to exceed -2,000.<vv) .tons. ..; Bessemer pig

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 2. â The early news concern
ing wheat rather tended to curb the enthusiasm
of the bulls who looked forward to another day
of profit. May started a shade higher, but
there was plenty of small fry selling, and the
price immediately fell a fraction. In spite of
the very substantial advance here yesterday,
Liverpool waa only slightly higher at the
opening, and all the advance was lost before
trading commenced here. When the scattered
liquidation had ceased prices improved. Selling
against "calls," however, started it on the
down grade again. After 11 o'clock the market
became excessively dull, and until the end of
the session prices flucuated In a range as nar
row as that usually ruling in coarse grains.
Very little news of any influential character
was circulated, but the extreme dullness was
in itself against the market, and the tendency
was in the main downward. Very little was
done In December, but that option was much
weaker than May, so much so, in fact, that It
influenced the latter option. Leading commis
sion houses were sellers toward the close. May
left off with a decline of Uc at 66Hc bid, De
cember lost %!B'%c, closing at 65% c.
Corn was firm early, but reacted and closed
weak. The seaboard reported a big export de
mand, over 100 boat loari* sold, and on this
account prices advanced somewhat. But coun
try advices suggested a heavier movement, and
cables were dull and lower. May closed VÂ»c i
lower.
;â¢â ;: Oats . were entirely, dependent on wheat and
corn,* and the . price â¢ range was narrow. ..May
lost %@%c. -â â¢..â , .. : - . .;
Provisions were fairly active and in the main
steady, though averaging little lower. Hog â  re
ceipts were heavy and packers sold more
freely. At the ; close â¢ January - pork was . 2%c
lower, lard a shade lower and ribs 2%@5c lower.

KNOCKED OUT WITH A BOTTLE.
MRS. KATE BENNETT, Keeper of a
Lodging-House, Chastises Her
Refractory Porter.
I'M tired of your domineering
ways and I won't sweep the floor
again/ was the remark that
precipitated a bloody encounter
between Mrs. Kate Bennett, the
keeper of a lodging house at 303^
Sutler street, and James Morris, her
porter, night clerk and general util
ity man. about noon yesterday.
Mrs. Bennett was in bed when
Morris went into her r-oom and
swept it. She declared that the work
was done in a slovenly way, and
insisted that Morris sweep the floor
over again. He threw down his
bruom and made the remark quot
ed. Then there was trouble.
Morris' account of what followed
is that Mrs. 'Bennett jumped out of
bed. seized a water pitcher and at
tempted to strike him with it. He
Krappled with her and took the
pitcher from her. She rushed out of
the room and locked him in. In
about ten minutes she returned and
unlocking the door said: "Now you
can go and pack up your things and
quit. " He .went out of the room,
and as soon sts his back was to
Mr?. Bennett she struck htm a vio
lent blow on the ton of the head
with a beer bottle. Morris collapsed
and Mrs. Bennett walked away.
"When he recovered his senses blood
was running down his cheeks and
onto his shirt.
Morris staggered to his feet ana
rushed out of the house In search
of a policeman. He caused a scare
on Sinter and Kearny streets by his
Moody appearance, and it was not
until he reached the corner of Mar
ket and Third streets that he en
countered Policeman Jordan. He

told Jordan of his trouble, and they *
went back to the house, where they .
were joined by Policemen McNa
mara and Douglass. Mrs. Bennett
was in one of the front rooms and â 
refused to open the door and admit
the officers. One of them climbed
through the transom and placed her â 
under arrest. She wns taken to the .
City Prison and booked on a charge
of a^eault with a de&dly weapon.
She did not deny striking Morris
with the bottle, but sala* she did it
in self-defense, as he struck her with
a Water pitcher and she had a mark
on her right shoulder to prove it.
He not only struck her with the
pitcher, but tore her hair, all of
which Morris Â«denied. She was re
leased on $500 bonds by Judge Low.
She is a buxom woman and would
weigh twice as much as Morris.
Morris was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where his wounded
scalp was stitched and dressed by
Dr. Maher. The wound was about
two inches long and penetrated to
the bone. Morris was able to leave
the hospital, but the doctor warned
him to be careful. Mrs. Bennett,
who gave her name as Mrs. Kate
Jones, threatened to swear to a war
rant this morning for his arrest for
assault with a deadly weapon.
PETER M'GLADE IS
IN THI LAW'S HANDS
CAUGHT AT DEMING, NEW MEX
ICO, YESi.'EUDAY.
Traveled Under the Name of W. B.
Russellâ Chiei Lees Will Swear
to a Complaint This
Morning.
Peter McGlade is in the hands of the
law. A deputy sheriff at Doming. New
Mexico, interrupted the flight southward
of the defaulting deputy at an early hour
yesterday morning and immediately com
municated with the Police Department in
this city. McGlade was traveling under
the assumed name of W. B. Russell, and it
was only through the precise description
sent out on Thursday by Chief Leees that
the Deming authorities were enabled to
catch their man.
Detective Thomas Gibson has been de
tailed on the cuse ami when Chief Lees
swears to a complaint this morning will
probably leave for Deming to bring back
the prisoner.
Yesterday afternoon the Chief wired Mc-
Glade at Doming if he would come ba^k
into the jurisdiction of this State without
the formality of extradition papers, but
up to a late hour last night no reply had
been received. McGlade's friends say,
however, that they have no doubt that he
will return without making any trouble.

REAL ESTATE
IS SLOWLY
IMPROVING
Condition of Market
the Past Week.
NUMBER AND VALUE OF SALES
IMPRESSIONS OF BROKERS AS TO
THE FUTURE.
a Review of the Records, Recant
Sales, New Building Con
tracts and General
Notes.
A Blow but steady progression still con
tinues to characterize the local real es
tate market. Notwithstanding many ob
stacles that rise to obstruct Us general
course on to the goal of prosperity it is
still striving with a marked degree of
success in combating them and substitut
ing for the long-existent business stagna
tion a healthy condition of advance and
progress.
The fear of another advent of the de
vastating drought that cajused universal
depression in realty a year ago has been
abandoned, and in consequence of the
markedly different atmospheric conditions
of the present season has given place to
a general feeling of confidence among
brokers that the market, instead of de
preciating, within the near future will as
sume a definite and indisputable change
for the better.
Sales, although not of an extent and
value likely to inspire, are, 'nevertheless,
increasing In number and size. During
the week there were many negotiated of
considerable importance, both in the city
and throughout the State.

only good after I have had a regular house cleaning,

TEMESCAL IS
NOT ANXIOUS
TO PAY TWICE
Says the Railroad Dis
criminates.
TO MEET GEORGE CROCKER
WANT SAME FAVORS AS ARE AC
CORDED FRUITVALE.
A Large District Prevented From
Progressing Because of the
Double Cost of Trans
portation.
\
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 2.
Many hundreds of. residents in Temescal
have organized for the purpose of trying
to induce the railroad company to grant
them the pame favors that are enjoyed
by the residt-nta of Fruitvale. People in
Temescal are Buffering from what they de
clare is a quality of discrimination on the
j>:irt of the railroad. They are now com
p< lied to pay double the fare charged the
residents of other- localities because the
railroad will not transfer them to its
streetcar Itnea from the local trains.
"â¢ Coming from San Francisco, people liv
ing in -Berkeley, which is several miles
farther than Temeacal; people living in
Alameda and people living at Fruitv&le
are taken. the whole of the distance for
their commutation ticket, which costs W a
.month. People living' at Temescal haye
t<> pay just double this amount, as it is
necessary for them to pay fare on the
Southern Pacific streetcar lines in order
that they may connect with the local
trains. The. Telegraph Avenue and North
ern Oakland Improvement Association
will appear before George Crocker ivxt
Tuesday morning to present its grievance.
The executive committee consists of Pro
fessor : J. D. Lemmon, M. S. Dewing, \V.
â ,<_'.. Wallace, R- J- Montgomery and L. N.
Hagar.
\\ . C. Wallace, secretary of the club,
thus describes the inequality complained
I have lived in Temescal for thirty
years, and selected this part of the coun
try because 1 thought it was the best part
Of town. We all think so, but in spite of
advantages thi.s vast territory dues not
thrive as it should. Thrifty, industrious
mechanics, who make a community, will
not f 'uy homes in Temescal simply De
cause if they work in San Francisco, as
many of them do, it costs them the price
of two commutation tickets to go back
and forth. This question of transporta
tion is a vital, one, because it puts Temes
cal t<> a great disadvantage, and yet the
railroad has a street oar line running 1
from the local train clear through Temes
cal We pay just double what the man
pays who lives in West Berkeley or i\ en
Fruitvale. The commutation ticket costs
!.'â¢; a year, but we have to pay anotnn $36
for street car fare. Thirty-six dollars will
puy interest on a nice little sum of money.
Certainly enough to cause a workingman
who is buying his own home to think. In
thirty years 1 have seen Oakland growing
up around a circle in the center of which
is Temescal. I am satisfied that if we
can make arrangement* with the Tele
graph avenue, car line, which ip owned by
the Southern Pacific, to give us the same
show as our neighbors, then: the curse
fn.m Temescal will be raised like magic,
and this district will prosper as it de
terves."
NOW BLAMED ON
A LADY MEMBFR
SECRETS OF THE ROW IN THE
BOYS' BRIGADE.
â _
Many Claim That No Official Drill'
Was Held and That Prizes
Were Not Earned. .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S xiroadway, Dec. 2.
The trouble in the Boys' Brigade is
spreading and half a dozen cities and
towns in the State are now interested in
the future of the Second Kegiment. The
â whole matter centers in the recent compe
tition in Alameda that ended in an open
Quarrel.
In speaking of the trouble one of Colo
nel de Wolf's officers' said to-night: "The
facts connected with the trouble have
never yet been published truthfully, and
as many cities are interested 'it is but
right that the truth should be Â£iven them.
. . "A drill was ordered to be held on a
certain, evening at the First Presbyterian
Church, Aiameda, for the purpose of
awarding a gold medal and a silver cup j
to the winners. The rules were approved !
by all the â¢ companies. The appointed j
night came, and owing to a heavy rain
Colonel William" M. de -Wolf officially
postponed the drill. He ordered Lieuten
ant Al. D. Bird. one. of his staff officers, to
inform the several captains, and Bird did j
so by telegrapning to L..' N CotHaledick,
captain of Company D, and by telephon
ing- to W. B. Barber, captain of Com
pany A. - :. . '. . -
"1 am told that BJrd ordered Barber to
inform Captain Tellar of Company E. but
â¢' cannot say â  that he did so. However,
Captain Cobbledick disobeyed orders and
. took his company to Alameda. . Captain
Barber, saying that he was t<-Â» senior
captain, appointed judges and ordered the
. drill to commence in direct violation of
â¢ orders. â¢ â¢ .. â /â¢
"The colonel, hone of his staff and the
official Judges were not present, and the
officers, excepting thoSe of Company E,
quarreled. The -Judges awarded the gold
â¢ medal to a 'man': In Company v and the
' silver cup, to Company E. . â 
â  'â¢â¢ "It all now seems to.be a personal quar
rel between a. certain â¢ lady of Company
A and an officer.:
' "But for this affair the matter could
have been easily; adjusted. â¢ As It Is now
â Company A- Is out of the regiment, but
the regiment still has a .big company at

Oakland,' and another at Christ Epis

Ci the out-of-town companies in Stock

DR. PATTERSON NOW
ALLEGES CONSPIRACY
REVIVAL OF A FAjmIOUS SUIT
FOR MEDICAL FEES.
He Charges That the Harringtons
Deeded Away Property to De
fraud Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 2.
The old medical feud and famous case
of Dr. E. M. Patterson against Dr. \V. C.
Harrington has been revived.
Dr. Patterson to-day filed suit against
Dr. Harrington, Louisa S. Harrington, his
w!fe. and W. S. Harrington, their son,
wherein plaintiff seeks to have set aside
a certain deed wherein Mr. and Mrs. Har
rington convey property at Tenth avenue
and Twenty-second street. East Oakland,
to their son without consideration. Plain
tiff alleges that thereby the defendants
conspired to defraud him from recovering
$I^l6 30 on a judgment obtained last May
in the Superior Court.
The parties formerly resided in Colusa,
and while there it appears Mrs. Harring
ton suffered from cancer. Dr. Patterson
Informed the operation and charged I
JKOOO as his fee. For the recovery' of this
amount Patterson commenced "suit in
June, 1594, and after a protracted legal
battle a judgment for $1750 and $66 30 as
c< sts was rendered in May. IS9B.
Last October an execution was issued
for the amount of the judgment by Sher
if; 1 "White on property of the defendant,
when it was discovered that the defend
ants had, on December 15. 1597, deeded all
their property to their son, a fact which
defendants claim they had a perfect right
tc do. Another hot battle, is now antici
pated.
TOOK A HUSBAND SECRETLY.
Miss Marie Schubert Went for a Buggy Ride
and Became a Bride.
OAKLAND, Dec. 2.â Opposed in her ambition to become an actress, pretty
Marie Schubert secretly became a bride. Miss Schubert is a well-known young
lady of East Oakland, gifted with a sweet voice and possessing enough of
nature's charms to justify her in thinking she could make a success in tne
lootsteps of Mary Anderson and others of her profession.
This Idea did not please the young lady's parents, and neither did they approve
the attention she bestowed on Ralph Q. Hoyt, a salesman of the firm of Baker
t'c Hamilton of San Francisco. Some months ago the young people met, and from
sll that can be learned. It was a desperate case of love at first sight. Mrs. Schu
bert did not admire Mr. Hoyt, so she said to-day, sufficiently to welcome him as a
son-fn-law, and she endeavored to break off the friendship.
Two weeks ago a mutual friend arrived on the scene, and being friendly with
the Schubert family, he took Miss Schubert for a drive. She did not return, and
1 iter It was discovered that she had met Mr. Hoyt and had been secretly married.
Mrs. Schubert made this discovery by looking through the marriage licenses In
the newspapers. She was very grieved at her discovery, for Marie Is the only
daughter. The bride's father recently returned from Manila, where he had been on
the steamer Morgan City, and he is no more pleased .with his daughter's marriage
than Is his wife. Mrs. Schubert, in speaking of the affair, says that Mr. Hoyt
U- not the man she would have picked for her daughter's husband, and she fears
taat her daughter has made a great error. Mr. Hoyt is said to be well connected
in San Francisco, where he and hla pretty young wife are now living. Despite
the parental opposition, he is the object of congratulations from a host of
friends.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1898.
GOETZ MAY BE
THE VICTIM OF
ASSASSINS
Student's Fate Still a
Mystery.
EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLA,'
EASTERN RELATIVES RENEW
THE INVESTIGATION.
The Stanford Student Received Many
Letters From a Mysterious Bus
iness Firm of San.
Francisco.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 2.â A profound mys
tery still surrounds the disappearance of
Adolph Goetz, the Stanford University
student, who left the home of his friend,
Mrs. A. H. Clark of Sherman street, this
city, the evening of October 22 and
dropped completely out of sight. He told
Mrs. Clark he had a business engagement
and that he "would return in an hour.
Nothing has been heard of him since, and
although the police of all the principal
cities of the State have been investigating
the case they have failed â â¢ - secure the
faintest clew as to his whereabouts.
The young man's aunts in the East have
taken the matter up and have appealed
to the Alameda oiucers to renew their ef
forts to find the young man.
Mrs. Clark has made a thorough inves
tigation of the case during the past week,
having visited Goetz'a rooms and talked
with his acquaintances at Palo Alto. She
states that the result of i.er researches
firmly convinces her that t.e young man
was led into a trap by confidence opera
tors and murdered in order to secure a
small amount of money he had accumu
lated.
A few days after his disappearance a
Turlock Constable reported that a man
resembling Goetz hau passed through that
place en route to Los Aneeles. Subse
quent investigation proveu that the Tur
lock official was mistaken in his identi
fication. Mrs. Clark Dases her theory of
foul play on the statement of Tom Forbes,
a room mate of Goetz at Palo Alto.
Forbes said Goetz had been receiving and
replying to numerous mysterious letters
from San Francisco. He would not toll
his friend tne nature of their contents,
but the day before he left the university
to visit Mrs. Clark at Alameda he told
Forbes that a fine business opening had
been offered him. and that the parties
who had written him informed him that
If he wanted it ho must meet their repre
sentative in Alameda the following night.
The lady also learned that the same day
Goetz withdrew a deposit he had in the
Palo Alto Bank and collected numerous
email sums of money that were due him.
If the student is really the victim of
thugs the conspirators timed the Alame
da meeting well. There was a political
meeting in this city the evening of Octo
ber 22 and tne streets were thronged with
strangers, making it an easy matter for
confidence men to operate without at
tracting the attention of the police.
Since Goetz's disappearance a number
of letters for him have accumulated at
the Palo Alto Postofflce. His friends be
lieve they will give some clew as to the
mysterious San Francisco men with
whom he was corresponding, but the
Postmaster refuses to allow an examina
tion of the letters.
The Eastern relatives who are renew
ing me effort to locate the missing man
are Mrs. Christine Kiram, 233 South Sev
enth street, Richmond, Ind., and Mrs.
M. A, Goetz, Ludlow, Ky.

THE BRUTAL BEATING
OF LILLIAN BRANDES
SENSATIONAL TESTIMONY AT
THE FATHER'S HEARING.
Important Witnesses Relate the
Events of the Tuesday Be
fore the Murder.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 2.
The cruelty of the treatment and the
murder of Lillian Brandes was most
forcibly brought out in the preliminary
examination of William A. Brandes to
day in Justice Cliffs court.
W. J. Richardson, colored cook, was on
the stand. He lives in a cottage aujoin
ing- the Brandes' residence in Berkeley,
and he told of having heard a beating
that was going on in the Brandes' homo
just prior to the alleged murder, and of a
child's voice crying out, "Oh, Al! Al!
don't." Then witness had heard the gruff
voice of the prisoner yell, " you,
If you don't find that money I'll choke
you."
This loud talking was mingled with the
tones of a piano and the knocking about
of furniture. Witness told also of hav
ing previously seen Lillian a whole day
in her back yard scraping over the dirt
and earth with a stick evidently looking
for something lost.
Louis Long was the next witness. He
too had heard the loud noises, the beat-
Ing, the sound of a body banging against
the walls. This was on the evening of
the Tuesday before the girl's death. The
witness also heard the girl cry, "I didn't
steal the money." His attention had
been called to the noise by Mrs. Rich
ardson, who remarked as he passed her
house, " Just hear that beating at
Brandes'." The witness stated that he
heard Brandes playing the piano. Then
it ceased and he saw the scuffling of
shadows through the lower windows;
then the softnd of banging against the
walls, followed by' silence, and sub
sequently the piano playing was re
sumed.
It is now believed that the hearing
will occupy at least three more days, as
a great deal of expert testimony will be
put in.

LAID DOWN HIS PENCIL.
Editor Alfred Chaigneau Has Betired
From the Local French. Paper.
Alfred Chaigneau has retired from the
field of local journalism. For the last
twelve years he has been the owner and
editor of Le Franco-Californien, the organ
of the French colony of this city,
in Tuesdays issue of that paper
appeared the farewell of its re
cent editor and manager. A little over
a dozen years ago Mr. Chaigneau con
ceived the idea that the French people of
this city should have the daily news print
ed in their own language, and he was en
couraged to embark on the uncertafn sea
of metropolitan journaJism. His efforts
met with success, and this may be at
tributed to the fact that the owner made
it a rule never to show any partiality to
any of the factions that occasionally
develop in the French colony, -...bout a .
year ago an offer was made by a number
of Frenchmen to relieve Mr. Chaigneau of
some of the responsibility of the property
by making the paper a stock company.
To this he agreed, reserving a goodly
part of the stock to himself. A day or so
ago he disposed of his share, resolving to
take a well-earned vacation. His position
as manager will be filled hereafter by A.
Goustiaux. The retiring editor said yes
terday: "I came to this State with my
parents in 1849, and have always led a
very active life in whatever business I
have undertaken. For the time I have
had charge of the paper I have not been
able to take a vacation or participate in
any of the pleasures of life. Now that I
am free again I propose to make a tour
of the entire State, in whichi have lived
so long and of which I have seen so little.
I have no plans beyond this, but I expect
to start in some business in San Francisco
when I come back."

Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department
is in receipt of a- letter from
the secretary of the Merchants' Associa
tion notifying him of the action of the
association in deciding to award a gold
medal each year to a member of the de
partment for conspicuous bravery, and
that the first medal would be ready for
presentation at the proposed entertain
ment in the Mechanics' Pavilion on Janu
ary 1.
The Chief has received a communica
tion from S. Davis, secretary of the Musi
cians' Mutual Protective Union, that the
board of directors, at a meeting Wednes
day, had decided to offer a volunteer band
free of charge for the entertainment at
the presentation of the two Soannell
medals and the Merchants' Association
medal, and adding that "the Musicians'
Union feels it an honor to be able to add
its little assistance toward the worthy
and fitting appreciation of the bravery
of San Francisco's noble firemen of whom
every citizen should feel proud."
t The arrangements for the entertainment
are not yet completed as the Chief has
not been able to secure the Pavilion for
the purpose, but it is expected that no
oracle will be put in the way.
Nothing definite has as yet been decided
as to who will receive the medals, but
'the fortunate ones will be named by Chief
Sullivan In a few days.
PROTECTION J?ROM FIRE.
The Merchants' Association Inter
ested in This Important Matter.
In view of the possible consequences of
fires similar to the recent Baldwin con
flagration, the board of directors of the
Merchants' Association discussed the
question of better fire protection to the
city at its last regular meeting. It wfis
decided that the committee on public af
fairs investigate the subject thoroughly
and report to the board at its next meet
ing recommendations for the better pro
tection of the city against fire. As soon
as these recommendations are made tn&
board will take suitable action to nave
the authorities adopt every possible pre
caution against serious losses to the city
from extensive fire, as well as such pro
visions as may tend to prevent the loss of
life.
The committee is composed of D. V.
Kelly, John E. Qulnn, J. D. Grant, W. R.
Sherwood and Marshall Hale. The in
quiry is to take an extended scope, and
all points bearing upon the subject of
better protection against fire will be con
sidered. All of the fire ordinances will be
examined, and if any suggestions can be
made for their improvement the board of
trustees will be so advised. It is believed
that the city has laws enough, but that
enforement is lacking. If this be the
case efforts will be made to fix the rer
sponsibility upon the proper officials and
compel them to attend to their duties.
According to the statement of one of the
officers of the association one of the
greatest dangers to the city is the grant
ing of special permits by the Supervisors
to people to violate the fire ordinances.
One law prohibits the erection of wooden
buildings within the fire limits, yet most
any one with a "pull' can get a special
permit to put up all kinds of wooden
structures where brick, stone or Iron only
should be used. The association proposes
to handle the matter without gloves and
without regard to persons or interests.
HALE & NORCROSS SUIT.
After a Decade of Bitter Litigation,
It Is Finally Ended.
After almost a decade of bitter litiga
tion, the famous case of Fox against the
Hale & Norcross Silver Mining Company
is at an end. Stockholders and attorneys
alike declare themselves satisfied with the
result of the lengthy litigation as it now
stands, and the threatened last appeal to
the Supreme Court has been averted.
The Grayson and Fox boards, heretofore
at swords' points, finally decided to agree
not to longer disagree, and after an amal
gamation sufficient for all purposes had
been effected, the Superior Court was pe
titioned to modify the decree recently
placed on record and declare a dividend
of $1 50 a share on 112,000 shares of the
capital stock of the company. This would
reduce the funds now in the hands of rte
ceiver Groom $168,000, leaving a balance of
$43,270 85.
Yesterday mourning Judge Hebbard or
dered a hearing" to determine whether or
not the proposed modification was satis
factory to all parties in interest. Resolu
tions passed by the Grayson and Fox
boards approving the plan and an inde
pendent petition signed by the owners of
93,000 shares of the stock of the company
were presented, and at the conclusion of
the hearing Judge Hebbard made an or
der directing the receiver to pay $1 50 a
share as above stated. The balance re
maining in the hands of the receiver is to
be held subject to the order of the court,
such order to be agreed upon by a com
mittee composed of George Ives, Charles
E. Paxton and Henry Wadsworth. 'me
final order contains a further allowance
to Receiver Groom, to be paid when his
labors are completed.
MORE BUNKOED BROKERS.
Dr. E. L. Parromore of the Health De
partment Cashes His November
Warrant Too Often.
Dr. E. L. Parromore, vocclnation phy
sician for the Board of Health, is the
very latest City Hall employe, to come to
grief through his love for the horses.
When payday arrived on Thursday four
different brokers turned up to collect Par
romore's November salary of $100, and
as the vaccinating physician had only one
salary coming to him an Investigation
was started with the result that Parro
more was discovered to have hypothe
cated the same warrant in four different
places for the full amount.
The brokers who suffered through his
double dealing are Boas, Bier and Re
gensburger, who were pinched for $1100 by-
Peter Mc'Glade's operations; H. Monta
gue and an institution known as the Pa
cific Investment Company.
A warrant for Parromore's arrest was
applied for, but the complainants were
informed that the code did not provide
a punishment for such crookedness as he
had been guilty of, and as a last resort
they sought the young man's mother In
Berkeley. Mrs. Parromore was bluffed
into giving them a mortgage on her prop
erty In that town and the matter was al
lowed tc drop until such time as Parro
more may fail to come up with the
monthly installments that he has ar
ranged to pay.
AFTER THE HIGHBINDERS.
Lieutenants Price and Esola Raid the
Dens of the Hatchetmen.
Lieutenants Price and Esola and Detec
tive Gibson continued their search for
highbinders last night, but the former
raids by the officers have so frightened
the Celestials that hatchetmen are rather
scarce.
All of the highbinder clubrooms were
visited last night and any luckless China
man who happened to be there received
a gentle hint that his presence was dis
tasteful. Very few Chinaman were found
in the rooms, however. Tile furniture in
the dens which had not beon broken up
on previous raids was demolished. The
police moved from one meeting place of
the hatchetmen to another in double-quick
time in . order that those that had been
routed might not be able to notify their
brothers of the coming of the officers.
A dozen places were raided In the course
of a couple of hours. The patrolmen in
Lieutenant Price's posse are: Robert Mor
ton, Thomas Slattery, Peter Chapelle
Stephen Bonher, Hiram Hutchings and
William Samuels.
While the lieutenants were after the
highbinders Sergeant McManus with the
regular- Chinatown squad made raids on
the clubs. Three of the gambling dens
were entered and a dozen Chinamen ar
rested for playing fantan. Sufficient evi
dence was secured to insure their con
viction.

THE SELF-MADE
WIDOWCHARGED
WITH MURDER
Anna Mantel Lodged in the Alameda
County Jail for the Shooting of
Her Young Husband.
Friends of the Dead Man Say He Was of a
Kind and Gentle Disposition and Would
Harm Nobodyâ A Mysterious
Woman.
Out In the neighborhood of Sl6 Filbert
street the North Beachers are talking \ of
the secret marriage of Anna Beth, the 20
year-uld girl who shot a roan over in
Alameda Thursday afternoon and then
said he was her husband. And she tried
to kill herself, too. It was a strange story,
and they are trying to recall details and
incidents of the past few weeks leading
down from November 2, the day of her
wedding. She married him and then
shot himâ and they can't understand it.
To the people around Mason and Fil
bert streets Anna Beth was "the proud
young girl," living quietly at home with
her folks, going out never alone, but al
ways with her mother or younger sister.
"The pretty Beth girls were nice, but
not very sociable," a lady of the neigh
borhood said yesterday. "Rather reserved
and distant. They dressed well and were
apparently careful of their associates.
They never seemed to have any gentlemen
company or to go around much. I can't
imagine Anna married. That child. And
'â¢;.â¢ to shoot him, too. Took her father's
revolver and killed the . . man who ill
treated her, " â 
And so the girl from SIC Filbert street
announced her marriage with a pistol
shot and the man she wedded lay dead at
her feet. The honeymoon arose in mys
tery, shone in secret and waned in the
powder smoke of a tragedy. The name
of William W, Mantel was never heard in
that locality until his wife, now in the
Alameda County Jail, shot him down
Thursday evening. No one there has any
recollection of the young man who soli
cited for medical works and collected
doctors' bills.. He and the woman who
took his life evidently kept their matri
monial secret well in the Beth vicinity. ;
When a reporter called at the Beth \
house yesterday the entire family was
absent, having hurried to Oakland at the ]
first news of the tragedy. The people liv- ;
ing in the same building where is located ;
the room of the Beths hardly knew wheth
er such a family existed or not. While they
were struggling with a defective memory
Miss May Both, the younger girl, returned
home and unhesitatingly spoke of tfte af
fair.
"I never saw William Mantel in my
â¢ life." said she, "nor did I ever hear of him
before last night. My sister kept her se
cret from us all. I assure you it was a
sad surprise to my father, mother and
myself. I have always been the constant
companion of Anna, and I never saw any
thing in her words or actions to make me
suspect that she was keeping anything
from us. We are all in the dark. How
ever, I know Anna is not the girl who
would permit any man to abuse and ill
treat her."
The ignorance of the Beths regarding
their daughter's matrimonial venture may

tie in a measure explained by the fact that
she was In the habit of getting her letters
at places Other than her own home. Such
missives as were not for the eyes of her
parents were left elsewhere. For almost
a year she had been receiving mail from
Mantel, in all probability, In secret.
In the pocket of the dead man was found
a card upon which was written "Miss
Delia Leslie, care of Miss Lizzie Keegan.
134 Powell street." To a representative of
The Call Miss Keegan stated that "Mftss
Delia Leslie" was a myth, and that the
name was only used by Miss Anna Beth
for the purpose of receiving letters under
cover. Miss Keegan, whose place is a
hairdressing establishment, stated that it
was no uncommon thing for her lady cus
tomers to have their mail addressed to the
store. 134 Powell street, in care of the pro
prieties.
"Miss Anna Beth was one. of my custom
ers," said she. "She had Her hair dressed
here occasionally. During this year she
has received four or six letters, all ad
dressed to 'Miss Delia Leslie." I am sure
that was a fictitious name, although she
never made a confidante of me. I of
course, did not know she was married I
believe she had learned the hairdresser's
trade, but I did not know she had ever
worked at it. I never heard of Mantel
before. The letters always came throurh
the mail."
William Mantel la described by different
physicians he had worked for as being a
dapper little fellow, fond of dress and
ladies' society. He was not a financial
success, and was idle a great deal between
his spells of employment. He never had
anything except a minimum of dollars and
a good suit of clothes. However, his old
employers speak well of him, and his good
character went toward helping him into
an honest if not a well paid job. He was
employed by Dr. H. L. Wagner of this
city in a humble capacity for four years,
ana seelrg that his poverty would prevent
him going through the medical school, he
turned his attention to some other means
of livelihood. His light weight impelled
him to try the life of a jockey, and he
worked at the Hobart stables for some
time. He left that situation and was em
ployed by Dr. d'Evelyn as a sort of col
lector. Afterward he worked in the
leather establishment of Nichols & Co.
A short time ago he called at the office of
Dr. C. C. Wadsworth, 1104 Van Ness av
enue, seeking employment. He was per
mitted to solicit for a medical publication
on commission.
This record proves that Mantel finan
cially was hardly a fit candidate for mat
rimony, and Anna Beth had some reason
for keeping her mariage a secret from the
proverbially stern parent.
By William Mantel's intimate friends
his wife's assertion that he abused and
threatened her with bodily harm is char
acterized aii preposterous. They describe
him as a little, mild chap, not capable of
harming a kitten. Gentle and inoffensive
even to effeminacy is the character they
give the man his wife shot down without
a moment's warning. Among those who
give this testimony concerning the dead
man are Edward Ayers, druggist at the
corner of Leavenworth and Eddy streets,
and S. F. Hughes, corner of Post and
Powell.
It was also a well-known fact among
his nearest associates that he feared the
woman who ended his life. L. C. Hof
man, grocer, corner of Eddy and Leaven
worth streets, states that Mantel was in
the store about two weeks ago. He was
very much depressed and confessed that
he was in deep trouble "over a woman."
With some reluctance, as he was very
close about his private affairs, he Bald
that it was a Miss Beth and that she was
fearfully jealous. She had even threat
ened him. Several days ago he came into
the store and when questioned by his
friend about "that affair" answered that
it was "worse." He did not state that
he and Miss Beth were married, but left
the impression on the mind of his hearer
that no wedding had taken place.
"Hofman," he said, "never got tangled
lup with a woman. Of all troubles a man
ever got into that '.b the worst."
"I can't believe that Mantel abused and
ill-treated his wife," said Mr. Hofman.
"He was not of that kind. He was one of
the tenderest hearted little fellows I ever
saw. I also know his wife, as the Beths
once lived in this neighborhood. She was
a very nice girl, very reserved and lady
like. She was large and strong enough
I to have picked him up and carried him
around the block. He was about four and
a half feet high and weighed probably
120 pounds. Why did she use a gun on
the poor little fellow? He was a customer
In the store, and often when he was broke
bought groceries here. He was perfectly
honest and always paid hisÂ«bills. I think
the poor little chap has an account on
my books of 15 cents, the price of a pur
! chase a day or so ago.
"Mantel was a gentleman in appearance
!as well as in soul. One of those who
brush their clothes till they shine and
pay their debts."
A dispatch from San Jose received last
evening states that William F. Mentel
was married in that city November 2
under name of William Fred Mentan to
Anna Beth. Justice Gass performed the
ceremony, which was witnessed by
George C. Russell and Mrs. Mary E.
Lightbody, who were in the office at the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1898.
time. Mentan's age is given as 27 and
hers as 26. Both claimed California as
their nativity, with residence at San Ra
fael. : They did not stay in San Jose, as
no. trace of the couple can be found at
the hotels. Mentel or Mentan or Mantel
had evidently been masquerading under
two names, for the records of Recorder
Owens' office show that the recorded li
cense was mailed, according to instruc
tions, to W. F. Mentel on iMovember 18.
Yesterday morning Dr. Porter told Mrs.
Mantel, now in jail at Oakland, that her
shots were fatal and that she was a mur
deress. He did not tell her In such blunt
language, but he conveyed the fact to her
very forcibly, and. girl-like, she affected
an indifference which she could not
maintain. She. expressed for a few mo
ments neither sorrow nor satisfaction,
but when darker pictures of the future
passed before her she broke down, cried
bitterly and asked to be left alone.
The parents, of the young murderess
went over yesterday morning and spent
several hours with their daughter. Mr.
Beth left the jail at lunchtime, but the
mother was closeted with her child till
evening. From Anna's lips they learned
for the first time, so they both declare,
the story of her infatuation for and mar
riage to William Frank Mantel.
The wound inflicted on herself imme
diately after shouting her husband Â«a uo
more serious than was at first supposed
The bullet glanced off the skull and left
no permanent injury. This morning Dr
Porter consented to the young woman's
removal to the County Jail, where she
wilt remain until tried for her crime.
Beyond a little fever and excitement not
at all unnatural, the girl is in her usual
health and able to converse intelligently
She repeated the story of the shooting
; precisely the same as it was published
; this morning, but expressed a willing
ness to go more into detail. She says
that Mantel was not a caller at their
j home in San Francisco and was not
! known to her father. She admitted that
| before she left home she took her fath
j er's revolver, anticipating trouble, as
i Mantel had recently been very threaten
| ing in his language toward her.
"We kept our wedding a secret," she
said this morning, "and intended to do
iso for some time. About a week ago my
I husband told me that I was not his wife
: and that our marriage was a Isliam, and
i talked as though he would like us to
! part company. I could not entertain
such an idea for a moment, and when ho
took- to threatening me it was more
than I could stand. Before I shot he
had struck me, and then I concluded it
was time to defend myself. I do not
know the name of the man who married
us in San Jose, but we went there from
San Francisco. On our return I did not
tell my mother, but I have the certificate
and can prove that everything was
legal."
Police Sergeant John Conrad of Alameda
j swore to the complaint to-day before Jus
: tice of the Peace Morris, charging Mrs.
Anna Mantel with the crime of murder.
The remains of the dead man are laid
out at the Morgue in exactly the same
posture as they were found by the Dep
uty Coroner. His right hand is in his
trousers pocket, and this fact will be used
to offset the claim of the woman that she
did the shooting in self-defense, and that
her husband was In the act of striking her
when she fired the fatal bullets.-
A SLAVE TO THE PUNCHING BAG.
Actress Minnie Packard's Hobby the Cause of Many Fines
for Missing Her Cue.
MINNIE PACKARD, who plays the part of the young "chappie" in
"Gayest Manhattan," now on at the Columbia Theater, has a perfect
mania for punching the bag, which latter enters so largely in the
training of pugilists. The passion for the fascinating sport first
made its appearance some months ago and has increased to an alarming
degree. She has had a punching bag erected in her apartments at the
hotel, and not a day passes but the
athletic Minnie devotes two or three
hours in making it perform count
less gyrations. She has become quite
an adept in the art and has devel
oped much muscle by the violent ex
ercise.
But Minnie's hobby has well nigh
been the cause of her undoing, and
it all came about in this way: When
the company was rehearsing on last
Monday afternoon Minnie began to
wander about in the fond hope that
she would find a punching bag con
nected with the place and her search
was rewarded, for one had Just been
erected in the carpenter's loft. The
delighted Minnie immediately began
to work on it, after donning a pair
of boxing gloves which she found on
the floor. She grew so interested
that she forgot all about the rehear
sal on the stage.
When her cue came she was not on
hand to take it up. Ten minutes
passed by and messengers were dis
patched in all directions to find her,
and she was finally located in the
very heat of her favorite occupation
by one of the colored pickaninnies
who accompany the show. He in
formed her that she was wanted to
respond to her cue. and when she made her way to the stage she was met
by the scowling faces of her waiting companions and the announcement
by the stage manager in indignant tones, "Miss Packard, you ara fined
$5 for missing your cue." This she paid forthwith:
Now it would appear that this experience would have broken her of the
habit, at least while rehearsal was going on, but it didn't. The next
day another rehearsal was called, and when her opportunity came Minnie,
feeling the strong grasp of the habit, slipped away unobserved to the car
penter's shop and was soon engaged in the delights of bag punching.
Again she kept the stage waiting, and again she was fined. This occurred
five times, and Minnie had parted with $25. She was only cured of the
habit when the punching bug was taken out Minnie has threatened to
make a punching bag out of the stage manager, and the latter is dis
creetly thinking of remitting the fines.
The police have in their possession the
woman's hand satchel. She claimed that
it contained evidence proving her mar
riage to Mantel. While the officers will
not permit an examination of the con
tents, they assert there is nothing in the
satchel that will throw any light on the
tragedy. There is an election card of
John W. Glass, City Justice of SanÂ« Jose,
and a number of business cards or Miss
Lizzie Keegan of 134 Powell street, San
Francisco.
The police are searching for a mysteri
ous woman who visited Alameda to-day
and viewed the body of Mantel, after
which she told a story to Bruno Steinmetz,
a member of the Alameda Fire Depart
ment, which may throw some light on the
case. The identity of the woman is kept
a profound secret, although it is known
she is a resident of San Francisco.
She said Mrs. Mantel dressed her hair
early yesterday afternoon. During the op
eration she told of her troubles with her
husband and said she was going to Ala
meda to find him and kill him. The wo
man says she took the girl's pistol from
her and only returned it when Mrs. Man
tel promised she would not carry out her
murderous threat.
Drs. Buteau, Keyes and Lubbock per
formed an autopsy on the remains this
evening and traced the course of the bul
lets. The Coroner's inquest will be held
to-morrow evening.

TEACHERS TO
APPLY TO THE
HIGHER COURT
Taking No Chances
on Their Salaries.
GALLAGHER'S NAME HISSED
WARM MASS MEETING IN GOLD
EN GATE HALL.
A Fund Has Been Subscribed and the
Courts Will Be Requested to
Enforce Payment of
Salaries.
The school teachers of this city, at a
meeting held in Golden Gate Hall yester
day afternoon, unanimously decided to
sue the Board of Education for their No
vember salaries.
At about half-past 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon the little music hall on Sutter
street looked like a woman's rights as
semblage. But it was not a woman's
rights gathering, and a closer look at
the stormy sea of vexed faces would
show that these were not the kind of
people usually found at such meetings.
They were the pretty schoolma'ams of
San Francisco, and they had assembled to
see if there was not some balm in Gllead
after all, some rest for the weary and
some money for the moneyless. , They
had not borrowed Diogenes' lantern and
started in search of an honest man; they
are too well acquainted with the
School Board to start on any such fool's
errand, but they did want to find some
method of getting their salaries for No
vember â those salaries earned by the
sweat of the brow and castigation of the
rising generation.
Christmas, with Its bright vacation
days and open hearts, is at hand, but the
School Board has decreed that there
shall be no consequent Indigestion in the
families of the teachers. There will not
be salary enough to buy a stick of can
dy and a tin whistle. This is what
caused the stormy session in Golden Gate
Hall yesterday afternoon, and there was
not a School Director who dared come
near enough the building to attempt an
explanation. Once during the meeting
the name of Director Gallagher was cas
ually mentioned, and the chorus ofhisses
and groans with which it was greeted
would have made that worthy feel ii*e a
lead ten-cent piece with a hole in it.
The meeting was formally opened by
Albert Logan, principal or the John
Swett School, who suggested that Super
intendent Webster be placed In the chair.
Mr. Webster's election was unanimous,
as was that of Mr. Marks of Everett
School for secretary. The chairman
then introduced Mr. Bartlett, a teacher
who is also well versed in ways of laws,
School Boards and other queer things.
"At the opening of the fiscal year," said
Mr. Bartlett, "the School Board practi
cally makes a contract with each teacher
for one year. This is always the first
contract made and it has therefore prece
dence over any contracts entered into at
a later date. We have, therefore, the
first claim on all moneys held by the
board Or at its disposal. I suggest that
we appoint a committee to employ a
competent attorney, who will petition the
Supreme Court for an injunction and a
writ of mandamus. The former will re
strain the board from paying moneys to
outside creditors beiore our claims are
satisfied, and the latter will order It to
present us our November warrants. This
is the quickest and safest method."
Several of the teachers took the floor
and concurred with >xr. Bartlett. In fact,
about the only dis'-..ting voice came
from ex-Superintendent Babcock in the
rear of the hall. He said he was satisfied
that the salaries wou.m all be paid with
out any difficulty. If this board could not
do it the next one would..
W. D. Kingsbury got up in opposition
to Mr. Babcock and favored immediate
action. "We have submitted to so much
already," he said, "that Boards of Edu
cation actually seem to thinit they can do
just as they choose and we will not dare
say anything. For months the employes
of the office of the board have been get
ting their warrants on the Ist of the
month, while we are forced to wait until
the sth. This thing has gone on long
enough, and I move that a committee be
appointed to employ counsel and take the
necessary legal steps. If this body does
not take action as a whole I know that I,
for one, will file a suit for my salary."
Mr. Kingsbury's motion prevailed and a
committee was appointed, consisting of
C. H. Murphy of tue Polytechnic High
School, L. Bartlett of the evening
schools. Albert Lyser of the John Swett
Grammar School. \V. D. Kingsbury of the
Horace Mann School, Miss A<?nes Man
ning of the Webster School and Miss
Emma Stinson of the Whittier Primary.
The teachers will assess themselves 1 ncr
cent of a month's salary to pay the ex
penses of the suit.
This Week's Wasp.
Profusely illustrated with pen sketches and
half-tones and crammed from cover to cover
with humor, this week's "Wasp is an excep
tionally entertaining number. Sailor Sharkey's
coronation as the are-eminent star of the
American stage vice gentleman-actor-pugi
list Corbett is the subject of a cartoon in col
ters. Teresa Doane discusses interestingly "Girl
Bachelors" and "Matinee Favorites." Mulrooney
criticizes in his inimitable way the doings of
the reformers and the City Hall incumbent who
is so busy admiring himself in the window he
has no time to attend to his duties. A notable
feature is a fine full-page photogravure of the
men who led the Baldwin fire fighters.
BITUMEN FOB POLK STREET.
Merchants and Property-Owners De
clare for a Better Pavement.
The merchants and property owners on
the line of Polk street from Sutter street
to Pacific avenue are of one mind In so
far as the repavement of Polk street is
Concerned. One of the chief objects now
before the Polk-street Progress Club
is to have the basalt blocks taken up and
a pavement of bitumen put down in
stead. The members say that Polk street
as a ouslness thoroughfare is among the
most important In the western portion of
the city, and as such should be provided
with a modern pavement.
It is being urged by some of the mem
bers of the club that as private streets
in almost all parts of the city have been
paved with bitumen there is no reason
why Polk street should be longer neglect
ed. This street is one of the oldest out
side business streets in the city and yet,
except what has been done on the im
provement of it by private contribution,
ft has received less from the public treas
ury than any other business street in
the city. In the meantime there is no
other except it be Market street, that
is as much subjected to heavy teaming,
as it is the main route to the northwest
ern portion of the city as also to the
Presidio and Black Point military reser-
vations. . . ...
One reason why the repaying of this
street with bitumen was not sooner ad
vocated was because some of the prop
erty owners had thought that the heavy
traffic which passes along that way would
so cut up the* modern pavement as to
make it too expensive on the taxpayers
to keep it in repair. But now that Mar
ket street has received a coating of oil
rock there are no further objections raised
to following suit on Polk street. At all
events the Progress Club is determined
to urge the matter before the incoming
Board of Supervisors in the near future.

BOYS TAT7GHT TO SEW.
Interesting Exhibition by the Pupil*
of Sunshine Sewing School.
The pupils of Sunshine Sewing School
entertained their friends and relatives in
their -hall, 934 Harrison street, yesterday
afternoon. The occasion was an exhibi
tion and fair to demonstrate to parents
the improvement made by their children,
after a few months' training and instruc
tion.
The hall was thronged. An informal pro
gramme of music and recitations had
been arranged and was successfully car
ried out under the direction of Mrs. E. Q.
Smith. The pupils are boys and girls of
tender years. The lads are taught the art
of sewing on buttons, against the day
such an accomplishment may be of usa
to them. The ladies in charge were pleased
with the interest taken in their exhibition.
