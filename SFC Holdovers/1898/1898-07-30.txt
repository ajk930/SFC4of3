PONCE, July 28, by The Call-Herald dispatch-boat
Mindora to the Island of St. Thomas, D. \V. L, July 29.
The city of Ponce was formally given over to the Ameri
cans this afternoon. Ferdinand Torro, British Consul, act
ing in behalf of the Spaniards, placed the city in the posses
sion of Major General Nelson A. Miles, with whom was
General Wilson. The scene was more like one on a gala
day than one involving the surrender of a city. The ma
jority of the residents remained in the city to welcome the
Americans.
The ceremony was unique. General
Miles and General Wilson, by a prear
ranged plan, had been driven from the
American headquarters at the port of
Ponce to Casa del Rey, in the city
proper, where Consul Torro and Ul
piano Colon. Mayor of the City, await
ed them. The bombero, or the city fire
brigade, was drawn up in the Lallaca
dellcia, opposite Casa del Rey, and as
General Miles and General Wilson left
their carriages the fire brigade band
played Sousa marches. A guard in
front of the buildings cleared the way
for the American generals, and through
a cheering crowd they walked into the
building, where they were presented to
Consul Torro and Mayor Colon.
Consul Torro said to General Miles
that the citizens of Ponce were anxious
to know if the same municipal officers
and system as had been in vogue would
be continued temporarily. He was as
sured that the municipal affairs would
not be disturbed for the time being and
that the same local officials would be
retained for some time. But it was ex
plained that they would be responsible
to General Wilson as Military Gov
ernor, who would keep the city in or
der under a form oi martial law op
pressive to none.
General Miles and General Wilson
then stepped out on the balcony to
view *<he square. The crowd cheered
wildly and th>i two American generals
hastily withdrew. They received an
ovation as they made their way to
headquarters.
Mayor Colon, after the conference,
told me that hÂ» was glad the Ameri
cans had come. The island, he said,
would now enjoy prosperity and peace,
and the best citizens wanted the Amer
icans to take possession.
The political prisoners in Cuartel de
Infantarla were released by our sol
The San Francisco Call
diers. Redolf Flgeroa was saved in the
nick of time from being shot by the
Spaniards. He was charged with hav
ing cut the telegraph wire between
Pone- and Pan Juan last night. It was
his plan to prevent the authorities in
Ponce from sending to San Juan for
reinforcements. He had been led from
his cell to be executed, but when our
ship.s entered the harbor the Spaniards
Hed and Figeroa escaped.
Some men who have been political
prisoners for years were released. The
anchors of the American vessels
scarcely had touched the bottom of the
harbor this morning before the ships
were surrounded by boats filled with
citizens shouting "Viva Americanos!"
Flags of all nations except Spain float
ed from the houses in the city as pro
tection against destruction. On the
signal houses were flags of six nations.
Those citizens who fled began to re
turn from the hills and woods this af
ternoon. They brought their treasures
back to the banks and stores from
which they had taken them for fear
they would be lost. The stores were
opened again in the evening.
The Second and Third Wisconsin
troops are scouting over the hills for
lurking Spaniards. The Mobile, with
the Sixteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers
left Culchra Island accompanied by
the Cincinnati and arrived here at
noon. The Pennsylvania troops are pa
trolling the city.
Macadam roads extend from this city
to San Juan, the distance being bul one
hundred miles. These roads cost fc!.V
000,000, and there are several towns be
tween here and San Juan. All Lhasa
towns will be taken. Only two of them,
Albino and Cagnitas, are fortified.
These roads wind through the moun
tains and afford ample opportunity for
Spaniards to await the American
troops in ambush. The prospect is that
the march will be a slow one.
The landing of the American forces
to-day was greatly simplified by the
capture of many lighters whi.-.h were
used for the men and horses. A con
siderable quantity of coal also was
seized. General Maclas and Colonel
San Martin, who had been ordered by
SAN FBANCISCO, SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
the Governor General to fight the
Americans, were prepared to resist un
til shortly before our troops arrived. At
the solicitation of all the consuls, the
Spaniards retreated to the mountains.
A garrison of twelve hundred regu
lars and many volunteers remained and
welcomed the Americans. The Spanish
â Oldlera on the island are said to num
ber 7000 regulars and 5000 volunteers.
None of the American ships had been
reported at Fajardo or Culebra at day
light this morning-.
It is probable that the expedition to
be landed at Fajardo will fr.rni a Ju ic
liuii .>iJi the army at Ponce. The Mo
bile and Cincinnati loitered near there
yesterday, the commanders saying they
misunderstood the rendezvous. Colo
nel Allen is arranging to operate the
cable from Ponce in a day or two. He
goes to St. Thomas to-night for a con
ference with the cable company about
the matter.
The message from the Herald an
nouncing that Spain had opened peace
negotiations was delivered to Colonel
Allen before he left here.
General Miles has issued the follow
ing proclamation:
â¦ u ln i J he , Prosecution of the war against
the kingdom of Spain by the people of the
united States in the cause of liberty, jus
tice and humanity, its military "forcea
have come to occupy the island' of Porto
Rico They come bearing the banners of
freedom, inspired by a noble purpose to
seek the enemies of our Government and
or yours and to destroy or capture all in
armed resistance. They bring you the
fostering arms of a free people" whose
greatest power is Justice and humainty
to all living within their fold. Hence
they release you from your former politi
cal relations, and it is hoped this will be
followed by your cheerful acceptance of
the Government of the United States.
The chief obiect of the American mili
tary forces will be to overthrow the au
thority of Spain and to give the people of
your beautiful island the largest measure
of liberty consistent with this military
occupation. They have not come to make
war on the people of the country who for
centuries have been oppressed, but, on the
contrary, they come, to protect not only
yourselves but your property, to pro
mote your prosperity and to bestow
the immunities and blessings of our en
lightened and liberal institutions and gov
ernment.
It is not their purpose to interfere with
the existing laws and customs which are
wholesome and beneficial to the so
long as they conform to the rules of the
military administration, order and jus
tice. This is not a war of devastation and
desolation, but one to give all within the
control of the military and naval forces
the advantages and blessings of enlight
ened civilization.
Political prisoners who were released
to-day besieged the American camp
asking for food. They said they had
been starving for days, and they wept
for joy at the kind treatment accorded
them. The cafes to-night are filled with
Spaniards drinking to the health of
Americans. Our men have been wel
comed into the homes of the Spaniards.
Ponce, instead of Guanica, has been
used as a base by the Americans, the
harbor of Guanica being poor.
After the Mindora had left the port
of Ponce with this dispatch, about 7
o'clock to-night, we came alongside an
American warÃhip, which reported that
firing had been heard seven miles out
of Ponce. American scouts and re
treating Spaniards are thought to have
clashed. The Spaniards are said to
have twenty-four pieces of artillery,
and it is feared that in retreating from
Ponce they formed a junction with an
other body of Spanish regulars and
hastened to get the guns placed in the
mountains. Our scouting force has

PORTO RICANS MUCH
SUPERIOR TO CUBANS

PORT OF PONCE, Porto Rico, July
28, by The Call-Herald Dispatch Boat
MJndora to St. Thon.as, :>. W. 1., Jui;r
29. â General Miles arrived at this port
at daybreak this morning from Guan
lca, with General Ernst's brigade of
General Wilson's division of transports.
The town had surrendered to Comman
der Davis of the Dixie the evening be
fore without a shot being fired.
The commander-in-chief with the
headquartf-rs' Hag was received on
landing by the entire population. It
was one of the most remarkable scenes
of the war. The piers and balconies,
roofs of houses and streets were alive
with Porto Rieans representing every
class of society, who cheered General
Miles and the flag for half an hour.
Greater enthusiasm for the American
soldiers has not been seen, even at
home. The people are, man for man,
immeasurably superior to the Cubans.
They look prosperous and intelligent.
There was apparently not a single
Spanish sympathizer in town.
The American soldier and sailor were
given the freedom of the town and as
the flag was raised on various official
buildings people gathered in the streets
below and cheered the United States
and the American soldiers.
The town is clean, well-built and
bears every sign of prosperity. The
country beyond is rich in pasture land
and is as beautiful as any part of Cuba,
the climate being far superior. Our
troops have been moved outside the
city and strict orders issued forbidding
them to enter any street or residence.
The men are well and all are in high
spirits. There is an incentive in this
campaign which was lacking in that of
Santiago. Then the men were fighting
for the Cubans, of whom they very
soon obtained a very low opinion. Here
they feel they are winning land for
their own people â for themselves in
fact. Every foot of ground over which
they advance means to them so- much
more territory added to the United
States.

THE INJURED.
MRS. SILVA, known also as "Santa Cruz Rosa," burns
and internal injuries.
EDWARD M. KENNEDY, burns on back, arms, neck
and legs, probably fatal.
PAT DO NO HUE, burns on chest, arms, head and back.
CHRIST CHRISTENSEN, face badly burned; hair and
eyebrows singed.
JOHN KING, right arm and side badly burned.
A fire in the Oregon, a cheap lodging
house at 113 Oregon street, last even
ing, resulted in the death by smother
ing and burning of five people and the
serious injury of five others.
That there -were no more fatalities Is
remarkable, as then were over twenty
people packed into the small house and
the fire, which was not discovered un
til it had gained considerable headway,
ate its way through the building with
great rapidity, doing damage in every
room in all three stories. A number of
the inmates escaped death or mutila
tion by Jumping from the windows and
but one of these was injured by leap
ing to the ground.
The blaze was discovered by Special
Officer Gillen, who Immediately warned
the inmates and then called out the de
partment by an alarm from auxiliary
box 19. The fire had a good start, but
was soon under such control that the
firemen could enter the building.
While going through one of the rooms
in the second story Captain William
Killday of chemical engine 3 came
across the body of a woman, which
afterward proved to be that of Kate
Connelly. Assistant Engineer Wells
picked up the woman, whom he thought
to be still alive, and carried her down
a ladder. This was the first thought
that there was anyone still in the build
ing, and when Captain Comstock
learned of it he immediately put his
patrolmen at work searching for bodies.
F. Kelly, also known as "Lighty"
White, was found lying on the floor in
a room directly in the rear of the one
in which Kate Connelly was discover
ed. When taken down to the street by
the patrolmen it was found that he was
still breathing. A young medical man
in the crowd of spectators did what he
could for the suffering man until the
arrival of the ambulance, when he was
removed to the hospital, where he died
almost immediately. He was burned
about the face and body, but his death
was probably due to suffocation.
The body of Robert Kelly was found
on the floor of his room in the third
story near the door, which indicated
that he had discovered the fire, but
was unable to reach a place of safety.
His death was due to smothering,
though his face and body were burned.
Robert Curran, a longshoreman, as
were nearly all the men killed and in
jured, was found dead in his bed on the
third floor. His face and shoulders
were scorched to a certain extent but
the suffocating smoke was the cause
of his death.
A one-legged newsboy named Char
ley Holmes, a familiar figure to all who
have occasion to visit the ferries where
he had his stand, was the fifth vtctim
of the fire. His body was terribly
burned and he is probably the only one
of the five whose death was caused by
burns. He was found near the windem
of his room on the second floor.
All of the bodies were taken to the
Meipue am the scene there was heart
rending. Friends and relatives of the
victims v!si+?d the place in large num
bers and their cries and moans were
enough to tovch a heart of atone.
Martin Abram, the proprietor of the
Oregon House, was probably among
the first who heard Special Gillen's cry
of fire. He said:
"When I heard some one hello up the
stairway tl.at the house was on fire my
first impulse a s to run out and warn
the lodgers. My room is just at the
head of the stairway in the front of the
building. I opened the door and the
whole place was ' flames. Finding it
impossible to make my way out that
way I closed the door and awoke Kate
Connelly, who was sleeping in the same
room, and told her to follow me. She
must have becÂ«.i . confused, for when
I looked around to see if she was be
PRICE FIVE CEISTS.
hind me I saw her goinr Into a room
directly behind ours. I saw I could not
save her, so I jumped from ihe win
dow and saved my life."
Among those who escaped by Jump
ing from the windows was Mrs. Sllva,
known as "Santa Cruz Rosa." She
leaped from the third story and was
the only one injured in that manner.
Jacob Heinz, who is said to be the
father of Police Officer Heinz, was in
the rear of the building and Jumped
out without injury to himself, which is
almost a miracle, as he is quite an old
man.
There were about thirty Chinamen In
the house next door to the building:
burned, and they created considerable
disturbance in trying to rescue their
vegetable baskets stored in the first
floor of the lodging house. They were
finally huddled together by the police
and prevented from interfering with
the work of the firemen.
Captain Comstcck attributes the fire
to the explosion of a coal oil lamp,
which was probably in the hall on the
second floor of the building. The lodg
ing house was not very well kept and
it is presumed that there was consider
able rubbish in the hallway, which
made excellent fuel for the blaze
caused by the lamp. Special Officer
Gillen first saw the flre from the cor
ner of Davis and Oregon streets. He
says the door of the house was open
and the flames were reflected on the
transom. When he went to the door
he saw the fire raging in the hall of
the second floor.
The building was of wood and burned
like tinder, but the flames were con
fined largely to the inside, the front
wall being but slightly burned on the
outside. Not a single room escaped the
blaze, and nearly everything in the
building was consumed. The damage
to property is estimated at $1500.
All the lodgers were poor and the
loss of their little all will be a great
hardship. Same escaped from the
burning building with nothing but their
sleeping garments, and as a good many
of them have few if any friends, they
hardly know where to turn for aid.
Women scantily attired huddled in the
doorways until taken into an adjoin
ing house, where they were cared for.
The smallness of the house gives rise
to surprise that some of the inmates
did not discover the blaze in time to
warn the lodgers and save the loss of
life and injury. This is explained by
one of those who escaped in the re
mark, "The poor fellows didn't know
what hit them." He afterwards said
that he meant the men were in the
habit of returning from thoir work in
in the evening and drinking wine until
they were in a sort of comatose state,
when they would retire to sleep off the
effects of their spree. This man w-aa
one of their friends and gave this ex
planation as a matter of course.
The scene at the Harbor Receiving
Hospital, where the injured were taken
by the patrol wagon after being pick
ed up at various places after the fire,
was one of horror. With clothing hang
ing in tatters, faces, arms, legs and
bodies terribly burned, the unfortunate
victims presented a most pitiful ap
pearance. Drs. Hill and Zabala, how
ever, did everything in their power to
alleviate the sufferings of the injured,
some of whom it is feared will not re
cover.
Pat Donohi: received severe burns
on the chest, arms, head and back, and
is suffering intense pain and his re
covery is doubtful.
Christ Christtnsen was burned about
the face p ' arms.
John King, right side and arm
burned; will re- over.
Edward M. Kennedy, burns on back,
arms, neck :nC legs: condition serious.
Mrs. Silva, badly burned about the
arms and legs; probably injured in
ternally; caused by jumpinpr from a
window.2
REPLY TO SPAIN'S APPEAL
FOR PEACE TO BE MADE TO-DAY
Future Government of tr;e Philippines Probably tf}e Only Bone of
Contention.

NEW YORK, July 29.â The Wash-]
lngton correspondent of the Herald
Bends the following: President MoKin
ley's reply to Spain's appeal for peace
â¢will be placed in the hands of Embassa
dor Cambon to-morrow afternon. "It
â¢will be emphatic and definite as to the
terms upon which the United States
â will consent to a cessation of hostili
ties, but will leave open the question of
the future government of the Philip
plnes. The general terms as agreed
upon after an all day's Cabinet ses
sion are substantially the same as
those previously outlined in the Her
ald, namelyâ Absolute cession of Porto
Rico to the United States, independence
of Cuba, cession of Guan Island to the
United States as a coaling: station, ces
sion of at least a coaling: station in the
Philippines, r*nd a port if desired. The
future government of the Philippines
will be a matter for future, negotiations
after Spain has cone-nted t'i accept the
general terms outlined above.
Tli. 1 immediate acceptance of these
general terms by Spain will mean im
mediate peace. A refusal or desire on
\h*> part of Spain to dicker for better
terms will mean a prolongation of the
â¢ war with more rigid demands involv
ing: The payment of Indemnity, and the
libility of the complete loss of the
Philippines when the United States
again submits terms.
Although another Cabinet meeting j
has been called for half past ten o'clock

RECEIVES MIDNIGHT ORDERS
FROM THE MAYOR.
Superintendent of Streets Scouring
the City for a Formidable Crew
to Start Work This
Morning.
Late last night Superintendent of
Streets Ambrose was instructed by
Mayor Phelan to proceed with the
work of tearing up the street car
tracks which have been condemned by
the Board of Supervisors.
Ambrose is determined to carry out
the instructions of the Mayor to the
letter, and to overcome any objections
which might be interposed by the rail
road company, he has selected a for
midable crew to be ready for any emer
gency.
The action of the Mayor seems to
Indicate that he intends to carry out
the edict of the Board and will not
brook any "foolishness."
Early this morning the deputies un
der Ambrose were scouring the city for
men to assist in removing the rails.
A sufficient gang will be employed so
that by the time the railroad company
learns of the work the rails will have
been taken up. This Is to prevent the
company from suing out a writ of in
junction, which would necessarily pre
vent the Mayor from carrying out the
edict of the Supervisors.

CALL AND HERALD SENT
FIRST DISPATCH-BOAT
INTO SANTIAGO HARBOR
NEW YORK, July 29.â T0 the Editor of the Her
ald: To settle the claims as to which was the first news
paper dispatch-boat to enter the harbor of Santiago, I will
say that the Golden Rod, the Herald-Call boat, was the
first. We steamed into the harbor at 5 o'clock on the even
ing of July 17, the first to enter with the exception of
small naval boats, and the Golden Rod was right in our
,wake. No other boat entered the harbor until some time i
later in the evening. J. A. YOUNG,
Master of Steamship State of Texas.
New York. July 29, 1898. 1
were substantially agreed upon when
the Cabinet adjourned at 6 o'clock this
evening. The main bone of contentionâ
that relating to the permanent control
of the Philippines by the United States
âwas settled before the Cabinet ad
journed to-day.
The views of the President and Sec
retary Day against the acquisition of
the entire islands by the United States
prevailed. Those opposed to allowing
Spain to retain sovereignty over the
islands linally agreed that it was nei
ther wise nor prudent for ue at this
time to define a policy fdr the future
control of the islands, and they agreed
with the President that it waÃ not de
sirable for us to permanently hold the
islands. When the Cabinet adjourned
this evening a great many verbal
changes had been made in the draft of
the note prepared yesterday by Secre-
tary Day after consultation with the
President, but all the essential points
having been agreed upon, Secretary-
Day was' directed to prepare a new
copy of the note, and members of the
Cabinet were invited to go to the
White House to-morrow morning for

As was expected the main point of
discussion to-day was over the ques

Philippines. It developed early in the
discussion that different members en

the final disposition of the islands, but

There Is Dullness Just Now at the
Union Iron Works.
There is no excitement at the Union
Iron Works Just now. All the men that
can be conveniently put to work on the
battleship Wisconsin are at work bring
ing that vessel up to the finishing degree.
It Is quite apparent that Uncle Sam does
not consider that his boys in blue will
need this marine destroyer Just now,
since there are no Spanish vesrels to be
sent to Davy Jones' locker: The armiA'
i plates for this and the other vessels now
being built in the East have not been con
tracted for, so far as is known In this
; city, and as a. consequence the Wisconsin
; can not be finished until these plates ar
: rive. Excepting thiÃ thÂ«* work on the
i vessel is progressing rapidly, and in the
course of a few months she will be
â  launched, as the armor plates can be put.
j en after she goes into the water.
The Japanese war vessel Chitose is
' having her machinery put in place, and
when this is completed she will be in a
condition to turn hÂ«r nose homeward.
Her armament will be placed on her
when she gets to Japan.
On the berth of the Farragut -ft-ill be
laid the keel of the Active, the new tug
boat ordered for the J. D. Spreckels Com

at the Union Iron Works, and the thou
sands of mechanics and laborers who ob

yards are in hopes that the Scotts will
obtain the contract for one of the new
boats now to be built for the navy.
Work of the Immigration Bureau.
Commissioner North has Just dispatched
a report to T. V. Pmvderly, Commissioner
Gor.tral oi Immigration, showing the
work: done at the local office during the
past year. The report shows a general
falling off of immigrants during the year,
due to the Increased patrol force a.long
the front, and a special falling off since
the commencement of the war with Spain.
He callfe attention to the ne.ed of a prouor
landing station and additional service
from the revenue marine. Mr. North has
been greatly aided in his work by the as>
slstance rendered him by John J. S. Rod
gers of Philadelphia #nd W. M. Rice of
victoria, also by the harmonious manner
in whi''h his subordinates have worked
during the year.

possession of the islands. As there wns
a difference of opinion as to what
should be done about the future Kov
ernment of these islands, it win-! de
cided to so word the note to Spnln :is
to leave the subject of future govern
ment subject to negotiation after Spain
has accepted the several general termi
which will be demanded its conditions
under which the United Stated will
consent to a cessation of hostilities be
fore proceeding with the negotiations
for perfecting the details.
The least the United States will de
mand in relation to the Philippines is
the permanent cession of a coaling sta
tion, the administration at the same
time reserving th*i right to lay claim to
a port and have a voice in the future
disposition of the islands when that
point is reached.
At the present time the Cabinet is not
willing to bind itself to an agreement
which insures Spanish sovereignty over
the islands. President Mcltlnley feels
that we are under certain obligations
to the insurgents of the islands and
that we should have full particulars
from Admiral Dewey as to his exact
relations with 'the insurgent forces be
fore entering into an agreement for
Spain's retention of the islands. Al
though there has been no formal recog
nition of the insurgents, they have to a
certain extent been our allies and the
President feels that it is only fair that
their demands should be taken into
consideration.
At this time the Cabinet deems it
wise to have Admiral Dewey's views

Way to Santiago to Carry
Home Fifteen Thou
k sand Troops.
SANTIAGO. July 29.â Major General
Shafter is desirous that it should be
known that the United States War De
partment has in no way Interfered with
the conduct of the campaign. The gen<
eral adds that he was never hampered
by the War Department, and that, if
the campaign in this vicinity had failed
the fault would have been all his own.
The department's only participation ifc
the operations was in ratifying tho
terms of the surrender of the Spanish
forces. .
General Shafter has requested that
these statements be published in view
of the fact that the department haÂ»
been criticised for faulty management.
General Shafter has received advices
that two Spanish transports, one of
them being a hospital ship, have left
the island of Martinique. They are ex
pected here to-morrow.
In addition, th?ee Spanish transports
left Cadiz yesterday and four others
are to leave Cadiz on July 30. Those
vessels are capable of carrying a,bout
15,000 troops, and the embarkation will
begin when all the vessels are here. It
is expected that all the Spanish pris
oners of war will be embarked by Au
gust 15.
The American commander has au
thorized the K-anish officers who com
manded the troops that came to San
tiago during the siege from llanza
nillo to send for their wives arid fami
lies, in order that they may be able to
take them back to Spain at the Gov
ernment's expense. In all there are
about 750 womer and children.
The telegraph operator at Manzanillo
notified the authorities here that Cap
tain General Blanco â  first refused to
permit the delivery of messages sent
by these officers to their families, but
later, under a protest from General
Shafter, the Captain Gen ral allowed
the messages to be delivered.
The American General has aJso au
thorized the Spanish officers to charter
a schooner at Manzaniilo for the pur
pose of bringing their families to this
port, but no vessel was available, and
other plans are now under way. Prob
ably a schooner will be sent from here
to ManzaniHo, under a flag of truce, to
fetch the wives and children of the;
Spanish officers.

LONDON, July 30.â A special dis

not likely that Government will decide
to prolong the war because of Porto
Rico, considerable feeling is manifested
and every possible diplomatic effort
will be made to retain it. Apparently
there is little objection to ceding a coal

islands, which, in the opinion of the
government and official circles gener

M'KINLEY A SECOND LINCOLN
STIRRING COMMENTS OF THE
SPECTATOR,
Strongly Urges This Country to As
sume Direct Control of the
Philippines as" Well
as Cuba.
Special Dlspatoh to The Call.
LONDON, July 29.â The weekly pa
pers credit the United States with a de
sire to deal generously with Spain. The
Saturday Review says:
"We are convinced that America will
not play the part of a Shylock, but now
that she has learned to appreciate the
bravery and fighting qualities of the
Spaniards as well as the worthlessness
of the Cuban rebels, she will make ob
vious atonement for the precipitancy
i\ ith which she entered upon the war
by dealing generously with her oppon
ents."
The Spectator takes a line quite un
usual in the English press, most strong
ly urging the United States to assume
direct control of both Cuba and the
Philippines. It implores the Washing
ton Government "rather to break an
Ingenuous pledge to Congress than to
allow Cuba or the Philippines to be in
dependent or to return to the cruel
Spanish dominion."
"Since it is equally inadmissible," the
Spectator says, "to grant independence
or to transfer the Philippines to any
other power, it is beet that the United
States should assume the heavy re
sponsibility involved, which will serve
to bring out the best qualities of the
American nation. England d</es not
desire the Philippines; and if she did
Bhe would not take them, because she
wishes to prove that her sympathy fur
the United Spates is quite disinterest
ed."
The Spectator devotes another article
to a r-ulogy of the "splendid and un
expected manner in which President
McKlnley has ripen to the requirements
of a high and difficult position."
"The President has developedvlatent
tÃlents. snowing him the possessor of
many of Lincoln's great qualities. It
would be remarkable," the Spectator
continues, "If for the second time in a
generation the American system of
really an elective monarchy proves its
strong power of dealing with great
crises. Europe may have been hasty in
rejecting the very idea of an elective
monarchy as fatal alike to stability and
strength."

FEELING OF ANXIETY
PREVAILS AT SANTIAGO
Copyrighted, 189S, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA.JuIy 28 (delay-
Ed in transmission).â A panicky feeling
prevails in business circles here, owing
to a fear that the Americans will turn
the city over to the Cubans for self
government. No confidence exists, ow
ing to the uncertainty of the future.
Orders that were given during the first
days of the American occupation have
been countermanded by cable. Euro
pean merchandise on through bills of
lading via New York have been order-,
ally will afford compensation In com
merce for the loss of the Antilles, be
sides procuring occupation for the West
Indian army in re-establishing Spanish
rule.
The reply of America is anxiously
awaited. Judging from press opin
ions anything beyond the cession of
Cuba will be considered harsh and un
just. This is the unanimous feeling
among even the strongest advocates of
peace.
The people are beginning to realize
that peace will mean almost a total
loss of colonies, and looking to the del
icate and difficult position of the
Queen Regent, great care is still nec
essary to induce the nation to accept
the terms.
The Carlist and Republican papers
are making the most of the situation,
while many of the Catholic prelates de
cline to comply with orders from the
Vatican to censure the Carlist agita
tion. El Imparcial's Rome correspond
ent says the Pope is so displeased with
this attitude of the priests that he has
washed his hands of the whole af
fair.
According to El Liberal, the Govern
ment would not allow even the loss of
the Philippines to hinder the conclu
sion of peace, because it is very doubt
ful whether the country would indorse
sending an army of 40,000 men to
crush the rebellion. One of the leading
Carlists here denies the reports of dis
sensions. El Heraldo publishes a
warning as to the necessity for closely
watching the Carlists as peace ap
proaches. It is estimated that there
are 20,000 persons out of employment

DREAD TO RETURN TC
SPANISH DOMINATION
Natives and Residents Implore Pres
ident McKinley to Hold the
Philippines.
LONDON, July 29.â Natives of the
Philippine IslandH and British subjects
who have interest there are alarmed by
the reports that the peace terms in
clude the return of these islands to
Spain. As a result they have held a
meeting here and after consultation
with the Philippinans in France and
Belgium, have cabled to President Mc-
Kinley and to Senator Davis, chairman
of the Forelfim Relations Committee.
The message to President McKinley is
as follows:
"The Philippinans resident in Europe
pray you not to abandon the Philippine
Islands for the sake of peace with
Spain. Our loyalty and trust in the
honor of America entitle us to your
consideration and support. To hand
over our country again to Spain is con
trary to the humanitarian proceedings
of your noble nation and the wish of
all classes. Civilization, trade and all
will be lost if Bpanlsh authority is re
established in any form."
The message to Senator Davis says:
"A castiron agreement binding Spain
to form a government satisfactory to
the inhabitants is prepostereus. To al
low her to retain sovereignty means
deception, oppression and bigotry. We
placed our rights In your hands, and
pray you to induce the President and
Senate not to abandon in the hour of
peace a people who, trusting in Ameri
can honor, fight for their common in
terests."
The agent here of Aguinaldo. insur
gent leader In the Philippines, has re
ceived a cable dispatch dated Hong

mention of Manila ha/ing 1 surrendered

HAVANA'S CONDITION
GROWING DESPERATE
Knowledge That Famine Threatens
the City One Eeason Why
Spain Sues for Peace.
NEW YORK, July 29.â Horatio S.
Rubens, counsel for the Cuban Junta,
in an interview said that the reason
Spain made proposals at. this time was
that Havana could not hold out much
longer.
"I am advised," said Mr. Rubens,
"that Havana's food supply is sufficient
for only about two weeks more. There
are 200,000 civilians in the city and
from 50,000 to 60,000 soldiers. Only two
steamers have succeeded in running
the blockade and their cargoes will not
go very far among 250,000. Madrid has
been notified that Havana's condition
is becoming desperate, and with that
in view, and also with the purpose of
doing something before General Miles
had invaded Porto Rico or Manila had
fallen, the peace proposals were made.
"They knew very well in Madrid
that Porto Rico could not effectively
resist Miles and the surrender of Ma
nila is only a question of days. There
fore, they thought this a fitting time
to negotiate for terms of peace, assum
ing, of course, that the United States
would Btop fighting at once and that
the weakness of Spain would not be so
completely revealed as it would later."

LANGUISHING IN
SANTIAGO'S JAIL
WITHOUT TRIAL
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1888, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SANTIAGO, July 29.â Many cases of
gross injustice are being discovered by
the special committee which is inves
tigating the city prison. Through the
courtesy of Judge Advocate Grosbeck,
I was allowed to accompany the com
mission to-day. These examinations of
prison records and questioning of pris
! oners shed strong light on the peculiar
'. manner in which Spanish justice has
been dispensed here. Men and women
accused of such petty offenses as speak
ing disrespecfully of the Spanish Gov
ernment have been thrown into prison
and kept there for years without trial.
All recordÃ of charges against them
have been lost sight of; witnesses have
died, and, the victims been detained, al
though not sentenced. In many In
stances the present officials are igno-
rant of the crimes charged against the
prisoners, and the victims themselves,
in some cases, have forgotten the accu
sations.

to the plaintiff many years ago, but was

now, but the alleged "ringsters" de
nied this, though the history of events
went to show that White's charge was
certainly sustained.
In the matter of the charges brought
"to public notice by Detective Frost, the
commission, on the opinion of Attorney
General Fitzgerald, decided that It
could not go into matters that had not
occurred during the regime of the pres
ent board, unless specific charges were
filed. Notwithstanding that he had
asked for an investigation of the utter
ances made by Frost, Dr. Sponogle de
clared himself satisfied with the action
of the commit, ion.
The Tourtillott-Madlgan charges are
presumed to be a closed Incident, owing
to the farcical investigation to which
the public was treated under the
auspices of the Board of Managers.
It was brought out In a striking
manner that the appointments made
by all the members of the present
Board of Managers, with the exception
of those made by HaJe, consisted large
ly of relatives and friends, and that
politics had little or nothing to do with
the selections. The Democrats became
sponsors for Republicans, and vice
versa.
White further said that much of the
turmoil within the asylum was caused
by the lack of firmness on the part of
Superintendent Rponogle and his want
of executive ability. Gould countered
by charging that it was due to the an- ,

LA BOURGOGNE COULD
HAVE BEEN SAVED
Statement of the Manager of the In-

Company.
CHICAGO, July 29.â La Bourgogne
could have been saved with all her pas
sengers on board, according to P. J.
O'Flaherty, manager of the International
Ship Bandage Company. In an Interview
to-day, referring to the derision of the
court of inquiry, held at Halifax regard
ing the lohh of the French liner, Mr.
O'Flaherty said to a representative of the
Associated Press:
"Advices received from United States
Consul Foster at Halifax say La
Bourgogne remained above water for
probably about forty minutes, while five
minutes woulu have sufficed to have ef
fectively closed the hole in the ship's side
with a ship bandage. The findings of the
Halifax court as to i..a Bourgogne are
incr.mplete. inasmuch as no recommenda
tions are made to induce steamship com
f>anies to pay more attention to life-sav
ng apparatus than heretofore. The ship
bandages I refer to have recently been
successfully tested at the New York
Navy Yard."
SANTA FE PACIFIC
ASKS FOR REDUCTION
Petitions for a Fifty Per Cent De-
crease on the Barstow-Needles
Branch Assessment.
SACRAMENTO. July 29â The last rail
road corporation to apply for a reduction
of assessment before the State Board of
Equalization was the Santa Fe Pacific,
which filed Its petition to-day. The rep
resentative heard was A. P. McGinnis,
the tax commissioner of the Santa Fe
Pacific, which includes the old Atlantic
and Pacific and the Southern California.
The road from Barstow to Needles, a
trackage of 71 miles, was assessed
last year at $6000 a mile. Mr. McGinnis
asked that the assessment be reduced
to $3000 a mile because the line was op
polntment of an incompetent and
vicious matron on the solicitation of
White. Gould also testified that White
wanted to be a director simply to con
trol patronage, and that White had so
declared.
Incidentally it was admitted by the
Governor that he had designed Tourtil
lott, the half-brother uf Gould, for a
place- on the water front, but that ow
ing to differences between Gould and
Harbor Commissioner Colnon he was
unable to carry out his purpose. He
then suppestod to Gould to make Tour
tillott a burden on the State at Agnews,
and this was done.

NEW EL DORADO
FOUND NEAR THE
ALASKAN COAST
Quartz SparKHog With Leaf Gold
Close to t\)e Surface of
the Grourjd.
JUNEAIT, Alaska, July 26 (By Steam
er Cottage City to Victoria, July 29).â
There is considerable of a sensation all
along the coast of Southeastern Alas
ka, from Ketcl ikan to Sitka, over the
find of a ledge of half decomposed
quartz, richer than anything that has
ever been discovered and almost too
rich for the belief of any one who does
not know the possibilities of Alaska
quartz. Several Klondikers on the last
northbound steamship City of Topeka
heard about the find when the ship
reached Ketchlkan. They decided that
such a prospect and country were good
enough for them to try their luck in and
left the ship there. With their Klon
dike outfits the prospectors are now
heading for that section from nearly
every settlement on the coast.
Joseph Hamblet, a naif-breed pros
pector, found the ledge which he says
is located on Thorn Arm. He says he
found leaf gold in the quartz taken
from almost the top of the ground. He
became astounded at the amount of
free gold in it.
A. Cramer, a California prospector,
came along in a sailboat. He had
pome powder and they put a shot into
the ledge. The result amazed the men.
The- rock was heavy with leaf gold an<i
s<> rotton that they pounded out about
JSOuO in free gold. rhe rock blown out
by the shot was sorted and it tilled six
sacks. These sacks were cached near
th.- claim, and, taking a boxful of the
richest ore, studded and glittering with
gold, the two men returned to Ketchi
kan. This rock was exhibited on the
â wharf whenever a steamer came in, but
no sale of the claim was made because
it is said Hamblet and Cramer wanted
a fabulous price for it and could not
agree between themselves as to the di
vision of the money. Several weeks
later they returned to the claim and
found that the six sacks of rock had
beerrstolen.
The first really authentic news of the
discovery comes from as far away as
Sitka. Hamblet is a fairly well edu
cated half-breed, tall and of command
ing appearance. He has been paying
attentions to Mrs. Paul, a widow who
is a matron in the Presbyterian Mis
sion at Sitka, and he wrote to her the
full particulars of the discovery, stilt
ing that he wanted to sell but was hav
ing trouble in d6tng ku. She consulted
with Professor Kelly, superintendent of
the Mission, and then wrote to Hamb
let to come to Sitka for a consultation
and bring Cramer. They went and
Superintendent Kelly, who is a man of
some means, interested himself in the
rich discovery. Ke employed a Sitka
mining expert to visit the claim and
Hamblet. Cramer and the expert pass
ed through here to-night on the Cottage
City for Ketchikan.
The rock will average about $46,000
to the ton. Some of the leafs of gold
are a sixteenth of an inch thick and as
large as a man's thumb nail. Cramor
says there is plenty of the rock and If
the average holds up the mine will
prove the richest in Alaska if not in
the world.

SAUSALITO GAMBLING
WILL BE INVESTIGATED
Judge Angellotti Orders the Impan
elment of Twenty - Five
Grand Jurors.
6AN -RAFAEL, July 59.â Judge Angel
lot*! to-day <inlÂ«!red CVerk Bonneau to
Impanel twenty-ftve grand jurors to
meet on August 8. This impenalment is
two months ahead of the usual time on
account of rumors of political intrigues.
It is stated that among the first indict
ments to be found will be one against
Thomas H. Bush, editor of the San Ra
fael Sun, for extorting money from Wil
liam Vanning on the understanding that
if he did not pay Rush a certain sum
Rush would procure the insertion of a
"roast" In the San Francisco newspapers
steamer from Pyramid Harbor. They
are George Tyler of Juneau, G. Galuly,
W. Gaisford and B. Murphln.
Tyler's extraordinary good luck has
caused something of a Bensatlon here,
where he Is well known. About a year
ago he was a barber in a popular shop.
He went Into the Klondike region last
spring. Tyler brought out about 200
pounds of dust, or nearly $40,000, and
about equally divided among the other
three are 150 pounds, Murphin's money
being in Ran Francisco drafts. The
other six had very little pold. This
gold came from Bonanza and El Dor
ado.
Murphin and Tyler say that much
gold is coming up the river and out
over the Dal ton trail, though there has
been some delay in getting the pack
trains in operation on the trail. On
the trip to Rink Rapids they passed
boat after boat. They are going down
the river in. such numbers that it seems
the procession will never stop.
Dawson is now crowded to the ut
most, suitable camping ground being
almost impossible to find close to town.
The tents are so crowded that it is al
most impossible to find a way among
them. This party left Dawson on July
2. One other boat had gone up the
river but her name was not remem
bered.
A personal letter from Dawson. dated
July 13, of which the following is an
extract, throws a new light on the sit
uation there In some particulars:
Lots of people are selling out and going
back. A great many are going o Eagle
(*ity and Forty Mile. The mines are not
being worked very much now, as they
haven't much water. All the ground here
has been staked, but it is not hard to get
hold of lots of wildcat property. It sells
all the way from 3 to 15 ounces. Of course
It may turn out good and it may not.
More may be not than otherwise.
Some of the mines are paying well, and
some came out only a couple of thousand
ahead on their whole winter's work, and
not a few came out behind. There Is a
great deal of kicking here aoout the roy
alty. It â is thought it will be removed
before very Jong. There was a stampede
on Dominion Creek a few days ago.
The hill claims have been on the closed
list for some time, and the mounted police
issued notices that they would be thrown
open, but no * one /would, be allowed to
prospect without a permit. By that I. do
not mean a miner's license. You must
have your license. Then no permits would
be issued until July 11. They waited for
nearly a week, till about the 9th. and by
that time had caused enough talk about
It to call the attention of all the 'Vhee
charkos" to it and worked all of them
for miners' licenses that they could. Then
they, withdrew the order for permits and
threw the "round open unconditionally.
Of course-by thf-t time all the friends of
the officers had staked off claims and the
greenhorns stood a poor show. It is a
case of graft here all the time from the
police. They license you for everything.
There have been no great strikes lately,
and mining property is. very cheapâ that
is. except on Bonanza and El Dorado.
Sulphur rtnd Skookum are . turning out
very good.' â¢ â¢ .

CARTAGENANS NOT IN
FEAR OF BOMBARDMENT
Thought the Cerruti Indemnity Will
Be Forthcoming if Peremp
torily Demanded.
COLON, Colombia, July 29.â The lat-
est advices from Cartagena Indicate
that there Is no scare whatever over
the presence of the Italian squadron at
that port. The outward relations be
tween the Italians and Colombians con
tinue to be exceedingly amicable, and a
similar remark applies to the Isthmus.
In fact, there is much apparent indif
ference and skepticism prevailing there
and here In regard to the rumored In
tention of the Italian admiral to bom
bard Cartagena. The general opinion
of those best able to judge is that the
Indemnity in the Cerruti case will be
forthcoming If peremptorily demanded.
A sore point with the Colombian Gov
ernment all along has been President
Cleveland's alleged adjudication of
questions extraneous to those submit
ted for arbitration.
DAVITT INTERCEDES
FOR MRS. MAYBRICK
Says Her Release Would Establish a
Better i'eeling Between Eng
land and This Country.
LONDON, July 29.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day, during the debate on
the Home office vote, Michael Da
vitt, member for South Mayo, broached
the question of the imprisonment of
Mrs Florence Maybri k and represent
ed that she was in ill-health. Mr. Da
vitt said that to "release this American
woman would be a small step in the
direction of establishing good feeling
between England and the United
States."
Sir Matthew White Ridley, Home
Secretary, replied t,hat he thought the
reports of her ill-health were exagger
ated, but he promised to make in
quiries.
WATER COMPANY'S CLAIM
AGAINST LOS ANGELES
Demands Cash Because of the City
Council's Action in Beduc
ing Rates.
LOS ANGELES, July 29.â The Los An
geles City Water Company to-morrow will
file a claim with the City Council asking
that the municipality reimburse the cor
poration in the sum of $137,000 alleged to
be due it. The water company's claim
is based on the decision of Judge Wei
TnE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1893.
born of the rutted States District Court,
who held that the contract between the
city and the water company was legal
and that the City Council had no right to
fix rates under it, as the" contract was en
tered into-.ln ISGS, prior to the adoption of
the new constitution, which gives to mu
nicipal legislative bodies the right to
regulate rates.
Within the past three days the Council,
under the water company s protest, has
n-duced rates approximately 40 per cent.
This the company claims the Council had
no right to do. and, therefore. It asks
that body to reimburse its stockholders.
The Council probably will pay no atten
tion to the water company's demand, In
wnich event, the officers of the corpora
tion claim, they will endeavor to enforce
it in the courts.
The water situation Is further compli
cated by the fact that the Supreme Court
has remanded the Hooker-Pomeroy con
demnation- suit for further argument.
This suit Involved the head works site
for a water system the city Intended to
construct. By this action of the court
the matter will be delayed and no deci
sion will be reached for several years.

IMPERIALISM
Senator Hoar States His
Attitude.

IS AGAINST ANNEXATION OF
THE PHILIPPINES.
Declares That Every Member in Con
gress From Massachusetts
Is of a Similar
Mind.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARBLEHEAD, Mass, July 29.â
Speaking before the Massachusetts Re
publican Club to-day on the effects of
the war with Spain, Senator Hoar de
clared that every Republican member
of Congress fro 1 Massachusetts would
oppose the establishment of an im
perial policy In the Pacific, saying:
It is Impossible to predict with certainty
how we axe to solve the difficult problems
that* are coming upon us at the end of this
war. But of this you may be sure, that
the vote of every person now In either
House of Congress by the choice of tho
Republicans of Massachusetts or who Is
likely to have such responsibilities here
after will be cast in accordance with the
opinion of Massachusetts. She will not
depart from the Declaration of Independ
ence. She will not depart from the doc
trines of liberty laid down in her own
constitution. She will not consent to be
the ruler over vassal states or subject
peoples. She will enter upon no mad ca
reer in distant seas. She will not seek to
force her trade upon unwilling people at
the cannon's mouth. She will not exact
tribute or revenues from men who have
no voice in regard to them. She will not
consent to enter with the powers of Eu
rope into any partnership for the plunder
of China, the division of Africa, or the
subjugation of Eastern archipelagoes, or
for compelling unwilling people to trade
with her. If the American flag appears in
the East it will be as the emblem of their
liberty and not of our dominion. The
power of the United States is to be exert
ed through example and influence and not
by force.
It will be a sad thing for the country If
the people of the United States abandon
their fundamental doctrine. We are giv
ing it a hard strain in our dealing with the
negro of the South. But it cannot stand
if this country undertake also to exercise
dominion over conquered Islands, over
vassal states, over subject races.
If, in addition to the differences of race
and the differences of education we at
tempt to govern great masses of people,
aliens In birth, of strange language, of
different religions, our spirit will not, I
am afraidâ God grant that I may be
wrong â the American spirit will not enter
Into and possess them, but their spirit
will enter Into and possess us.
An aristocracy or a monarchy may gov
ern subject states. It was never done and
never will be done successfully by a de
mocracy or a republic.

RED CROSS NURSES
BACK FROM SANTIAGO
Wife of the President's Secretary-
Tells of the Society's Good
Work at the Front.
NEW YORK, July 29.â The Red
Cross steamer State of Texas has ar
rived at quarantine from Santiago.
The State of Texas has a crew of
thirty-five men, and brings Mrs. Por
ter, wife of the President's secretary,
who volunteered as a Red Cross nurse;
Sister Blanche, one of the Red Cross
staff of nurses, and Red Cross Surgeons
G. R. Ball, C. B. Long, Charles Do
herty and H. R. Livingston.
Mrs. Porter said: "I aided in the
landing and distribution of the Red
Cr,oss stores at Santiago. I went
ashore and visited the hospitals and
the battle-fields, -where our heroic sol
diers fought and died. I cannot speak
too highly of the magnificent work
done by the Red Cross Society at the
front. I feel that without its aid num
bers of our brave m.-n would have died
from lack of medicines and other neces
saries."
The State of Texas had the proud
distinction of being the first vessel to
enter the harbor of Santiago after its
surrender to General Shafter. Admiral
Sampson and Commodore Sehley visit
ed Miss Barton on July 17 and ordered
that the State of Texas be permitted
to enter the harbor* Miss Barton and
her staff disembarked at Santiago and
proceeded to carry out the work of re
lief to the sick 'and wounded and also
to assist the reconcentrudos.
The State of Texas left Santiago on
July 21. On arrival at quarantine the
State of Texas was inspected, and, all
being well on board, she was permitted
to proceed to her dock. She brought
two bags of mail from the United
States cruiser Brooklyn, which she
met off Santiago.
SUDDEN ILLNESS OF
FOURTH CAVALRYMEN
Half the Men of Company A At
tacked by Cholera Morbus
After Eating a Heal.
SEATTLE, July 2'J.â Forty-two men of
Company A, Fourth United States Cav
alry, stationed at Fort Walla Walla, were
attacked by cholera morbus yesterday.
Considering that there are at present only
106 enlisted men in the garrison, the re
sult was that nearly half were at one
time under the care of Acting Surgeon
J. E. Bingham, U. S. A., assisted by Dr.
Shaw of this city.
Breakfast was served at 6 o'clock yes
terday morning, consisting of coffee^
hash, bread and butter. Shortly after
ward two men reported themselves sick
and were ordered to the post hospital.
At 6:30 the balance of the company an
swered drill call, returning to Quarters
at 7:;;0. A few minutes later several men
were taken violently 111 and additions
were rapidly made to the list of sick un
til, all told, forty-two were writhing on
their beds in their quarters, violently suf
fering from some unknown cause.
The symptoms in each case were the
sameâ violent pains in the stomach, nau
sea and a feeling that internal fire was
raging. Their comrades were kept busy
supplying icewattfr to the sick, but it
brought no relief to the forty-two poor
fellows. The men were ordered to the
hospital, many being unable to reach
there without 1 elp. falling prostrate upon
the ground in severe agony.
Soon after the arrival of Dr. Bingham
the majority of the men were relieved
and returned to duty, but at last reports
several men are still in the hospital seri
ously ill. These are Privates Hardening,
Somera, Schwartz, Furnell, O'Brig and
Bow, and Sergeant Hoffman.
Dr. Bingham made a thorough exami
nation of the food furnished for break
fast and found nothing of an unhealthy
character. The doctors are at present
making a thorough investigation of the
matter, and it is hoped the cause will
soon be discovered. At a late hour last
night two new cases were reported, but
not of so serious a nature as the others.
FINE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE NEUTRALITY LAWS
Hayti Will Not Permit This Govern-
ment to Erect a Weather Sta-
tion on Her Domain.
WASHINGTON, July 29.â The Gov
ernment of Hayti has declined to per
mit this Government to erect a weather
station on its domain. Its action fol
lows a request fur this privilege made
by the Secretary of State at the in
stance of the Secretary of Agriculture
with an expressed explanation of the
purposes sought and a statement that
the Haytien Government would thus
get the benefit of Cur weather service.
The declination, however, was definite
and doubtless based on a fear that It
would offend against neutrality be
tween the United States and Spain. All
of the other Governments approached
for authority to establish meteorologi
cal stations in their territory have as
sented, including San Domingo.
The French possessions of Martinique
and Guadaloupe have notified this Gov
ernment that they must decline to per
mit the establishment of our stations,
as they have a complete service of their
own, whose results they cheerfully of
fer to cable to us.
Chief Moore of the Weather Bureau
estimates that this entire Caribbean
system now provided for by an initia
tory appropriation of $76,000 may be
permanently conducted at a cost of not
over $40,000 a year.
GENERAL DICKINSON'S
CLAIM FOR SERVICES
Demands Pay for Having Assisted in
Placing the State Guard on a
War Footing.
SACRAMENTO, July 29.â General
John H. Dickinson has modestly put in
a bill for $1228 97 for services rendered
during the time- the State National
Guard was bein- mustered into the ser
vice of the volunteer army to fight
against Spain. Maj- : General Dickin
son, N. G. C, hopes that his claim may
be paid out of the "army fund," as it
is termed, which fund is also used in
paying hall rents, etc., for the National
Guard.
He recites that on May 3 last, by an
order of the Governor, commanding the
State forces, he was placed on active
duty. He was required to turn over to
Captain F. de L. Cfirrington, TL S. A.,
the First and the Seventh Regiments,
N. G. C. He was also empowered to
place on active duty such members of
his taff as he saw tit, to procure suit
able headquarters and to taJce the nec
essary steps to preserve the State's
property. Pursuant to this order,
Major General Dickinson was on dtKy

AT ST. MICHAEL
Mushroom Steamship CompaQy
pails and Leaves Its Patrons
in the Lurch.
SEATTLE, July 29.â George Grayson,
gc-neial passenger agent of the Plf
Square Yukon Steamship Company,
saved his life two weeks ago by escap
ing from 268 angry passengers on th*
steamer Progeso at St. Michael. For
several weeks the company has been in
financial difficulties, though Portland,
Me., New York and Chicago men are
said to have advanced $350,000 to put
the enterprise on its feet. Grayson says
the company's officials began to scat
ter soon after the Progreso started
north a month ago. The Progreso had
been chartered with the passenger and
freight proceeds.
Several Yukon steamers had been
purchased of Moran Bros., on St. Mich
ael delivery, with $31,000 owing on
them.
Grayson was ordered to go to St.
Michael witl; the passengers and raise
money to pay f.or the river boats and
other expanses or. drafts for $30,000,
which he was told the North American
Tmnspmtation and Trading Company
would cash. If necessary he was to
sell the 1100 tons' cargo in the Pro
greso's hold.
On arriving at St. Michael he found
the North American Trading Compa
ny would not cash the drafts and that
the cargo did r>nt belong to the com
pany. The passengers learned this,
and, seeing that they had been swin
dled, as the company could provide no
river steamers, they made threats of
hanging Grayson. He got ashore and
immediately boarded the steamer
Charles Nelson for home.
The Progreso's passengers are either
catan, Allegheny, Comal and San Mar- I
cus sailed for Tampa yesterday, while
the Seguranca, Miami and Matawa
were to sail to-day. The department
wants at least three of these boats at
once at Tamna to load on the artillery
and cavalry of Coppinger's division.
General Coppinger telegraphed to
day that so far these troops have left
Tampa: Eleventh and Nineteenth In
fantry, under General Schwan; Bat
teries C and M of the Seventh Artil
lery; Troops B, Second Cavalry and A,
Fifth Cavalry-
The following troops are waiting
transports: Batteries X and M, Fifth
Artillery; E of the Sixth; H of the Sev
enth and I of the Fourth, the Fifth In
fantry, Fifth Cavalry and General
Hudson's brigade, consisting of the
Second Georgia, Fifth Maryland and
First Florida.
BEGINNING TO CURTAIL
EXPENSES OF THE NAVY
Peace Representations of the French
Embassador Change the Plans
of the Department.
NEW YORK, July 29.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says:
Secretary Long has already begun
curtailing the expenses of the navy.
He gave instructions to-day to Captain
J. R. Bartlett, chief of the auxiliary
coast defense fleet, under which that
official has withdrawn 120 men from
service in connection with his fleet and
assigned them to men-of-war engaged
on active duty and will put out of com
mission the monitors and yachts which
are under his command.
Secretary Long has also instructed
Civil Engineer Endicott to purchase
only one floating dock for service in
Southern waters instead of two, as had
been determined before Embassador
Cambon made his peace representations
to the President. Naturally if peace
comes without interference by a third
power all reason for dispatching the
Eastern squadron abroad will be aban
doned, but it is not intended by the
authorities to disband the squadron, at
least until negotiations are very nearly
concluded. .. ...
I learned to-day that the authorities
had intended to add converted yachts
to the squadron for use as torpedo-boat
destroyers.* The Mayflower had been
attached to Commodore Watson's com
mand and the Scorpion and other ships
would undoubtedly have been added.

Fever Situation Among the
Troops at Santiago.
NEW YORK. July 29.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: During the past few days
the public have become through the re
ports of General Shafter so accustomed
to the large increase in fever cases
with the small percentage of deaths
that less and less Importance seems' to
be attached to the disease among the
troops at Santiago. But Surgeon-Gen
eral Sternberg does not seem to take
an altogether hopeful view of the ""sit
uation. He said to me to-day that al
though he would not apply to it the
word "alarming," he would call it a
"serious" situation. He added he
thought the worst was yet to
come. General Sternberg has become
so impressed with the danger to the
men that he is sending forward nurses
and doctors faster than ever. Many
will go to Santiago from New York on
the Relief in two or three days, to be
followed soon thereafter by the hos
pital ship Breakwater. Nurses are be
ing sent from Tampa also as rapidly as
possible. General Sternberg told me
that under certain conditions, different
forms of typhoid fever were more fatal
than yellow fever. It is prevalent now
not only among the troops at Santiago,
but among those in Florida als/).
GREATER COMFORT FOR

WASHINGTON, July 29.â The care

stranded at St. Michael or are return*
ing on the vessel. Grayson will libet
the steamship on her return for breach
of contract, and declares the passen
gers will do likewise.
D. R. Campbell & Sons, millionaire
ship-owners of Portland, Me., advanced
$80,000 to the steamship company and
then quit. They are supposed to be the
largest individual stockholders and
losers.
Grayson alleges that F. K. Gustln of
Chicago, treasurer of the company,
took about $4000 of the company's
money away with him, presumably to
Chicago. He says Gustin's books are
being experted and that warrants will
be sworn out.
J. T. Evans, the company's auditor,
is in the Yukon country to establish
trading posts, which plan probably will
be abandoned. The company's offices
are closed. Until a week or so ago it
was believed the company might pull
out and recover its money through
stores to be located in new Yukon min
ing camps, but the closing of Its offices
and the lack of Yukon steamers leave
little opportunity to engage in such a
venture. D. O. Campbell, son of D. R.
Campbell, is here from Portland, Me.,
to protect their interests.
Grayson had trouble at St. Michael
with Captain Gilboy of the Progreso,
who wanted a demurrage of $250 a day,
claiming the steamer's charter had ex
pired. Grayson declined to pay it and
persuaded Captain Gilboy to land the
passengers who wished to go ashore
and to reimburse himself out of the
freight collections. The Progreso is
due back here next week and Is certain.

looking to the accommodation of sick
soldiers on furlough, enabling them to
visit their homes and return with
greater dispatch and convenience.
It has been determined to send a
commission to visit the hospitaiÃ of the
various army camps with a view of
ameliorating the condition of the sick.
A surgeon of the army and Major Hop
kins of the adjutant general's office
will compose this commission, with
perhaps some other officer of the army.
J. Hopkins is Secretary Alger's mili
tary aid. The surgeon general's office
also is considering the advisability of
allowing a number of women as nurses
in the hospitals at the large camps. The
surgeon general has been averse to
having women nurses in the field, but
it Is said that the large rendezvous
camps cannot be considered as field
service and that the objection to
women does not apply as it would in
active service.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
Lieutenant Colonel Lee Stover, of the
First South Dakota, will be in charge of
the vessel.
The object of Colonel Barber's depart
ure in advance of his regiment is to se
lect a site for a permanent garrison at
Honolulu. In determining a location he
will consult with his quartermaster, sur
geon and engineering officer. As soon aa
they arrive they will select a place for
temporary encampment somewhere with
in the city limita. The permanent garri
son will be erected probably in the vi
cinity of Diamond Head, which commands
the entrance to the harbor.
Colonel Barber said: I have recelyed
orders to select a site for a permanent
garrison at Honolulu. It will be neces
sary to have a capable engineer pass upon
the selection In order that no future dif
ficulties may arise when It comes to the
construction of works and fortifications.
The engineering phases will rest with
Major Lansing, who is an old friend of
mine. Dr. Griffiths will pass upon the
sanitary qualifications. Just what will
bo the ultimate destination of the First
New York I am at a loss to say. Our
chances of reaching Manila are very slim
from the present aspect. I judge we will
permanently garrison the island. As I
understand it I will be practically in
charge. I hope my men will get along as
well in Hawaii as they have here. There
has not been a case of serious illness in
camp so far."

Before Interment.
The body of Private Wheeler. First
California, who died on the *sth inst.
from pneumonia, has at last found Its
ri-sting place. For four days it has been
bandied about from one hospital to an
other, and from the headquarters of one
regiment to another, and at each place
burial was denied it, and for no other
reason than that no officer remained of
the First California to attend to the de
tails of the obsequies.
On Thursday General Miller learned
of the delayed funeral, and he imme
diately ordered the chaplain and a firing
squad from the Kansas volunteers to re-
Eair to the Presidio and there give the
ody fit interment, but when the squad
arrived at the Presidio plat the body had
disappeared. It was unceremoniously
placeri at General Miller's Camp Merritt
headquarters an hour later. From there
it was taken to the dead room of the
French Hospital, where it remained until
yesterday morning, when a chaplain and
firmg 1 squad from the First Tennessee
carried it to the Presidio National Ceme

Executors of the Estate of James Q.
Fair Decided to Retire From

On the Ist of August the Lick House,
which has been regarded ns one of the
best paying properties belonging to the
estate of the late James G. Fair, will pass
out of the Immediate control of the exec
utors of the estate. Negotiations have
been pending for several weeks between
the executors and K. B. Soule, manager

years.
Negotiations were pending between
James G. Fair during his life and Mr.
Soule for a transfer, but before arrange

tion being disposed of, negotiations were
opened and the property is now out of
the hands of the executors.

Charges were preferred yesterday

The charge as preferred by Colonel

"Charge: Embezzlement In violation of

"Specifications: In that Quartermaster

was under suspicion of being cognizant

against Green will be taken.

The man pretended drunkenness and
picked up a neuvy Instrument which he
had laid on the floor when he came in.
Mrs. Hanson, receiving no reply to her
summons for . the police, called upon

the burglar to believe that there was an

PUBLISHED OFF MANILA.
THE BOUNDING BILLOW is the very appropriate title of a neat little 16
page publication issued at intervals on the United States flagship Olympia
at Manila in the interests of American men-o'-\varsmen. The Call has re
ceived a copy of the tlftli issue, published in June. Ihe headline of the title
page is "The Battle of Manila," followed by the laconic Caesarian sentence,
"We came! "We saw! We conquered!" Beneath is a cut of the American
spread eagle surmounting the globe between two American flags in colors,
and between two cannon is the Liberty bell. Under this illustration are the lines:
" 'Twas for Cuba and our honor to avenge our heroes slain
That victory wreathed our banner when we fought the ships of Spain."
The contents of the Bounding Billow include a vivid description of the battle
of Manilaâ ships were sinking. Old Glory flying, guns were roaring and Spaniards
dyingâ Hot Shot, embracing paragraphs for the wayward and wicked; "A Naval
Surprise," translated from the Dlario de Manila, May 4, giving the Spanish ac
count of the Manila engagement; "MHson of Illinois." a poetic tribute to the war
Senator from the Prairie State: "Chat 3." :i collection of local paragranhs;
"Rear Admiral George Dowey," a tribute to the gallant leader; "Captain Charles
V. Gridley," a toucning obituary; "The Maine," a poem, and "The Curio
Fiends," an amusing rhyme, both by L. S. Young, who also contributes a lengthy
poem entitled "The Battle of Manila Bay." Mr. Young is the editor of this most
interesting publication, and H. B. Glover is the printer. The motto of the
Bounding Billow is: "Excelsior, per Gradasâ Onward and Upward, Step by Step."
The "value" per copy is stated to be "50 sen."
elation had visited the camps in this city
and made inquiry for Foresters who have
enlisted in the army. The organization
is now fairly started on Up good work,
and as contributions from courts and cir
cles of the Order of Foresters of America
come in it will have no difficulty in carry
ing out the purposes for which it was
started.
The association has adopted a neat but

enrolls as a member.
SORROW OF A BEGGAR.
Mrs. Bonnet Produced in Court â De-
serted by Her Companion.
Mrs. Octavia Clarisse Lapierre Bonnet
is no longer counted with the missing.
Neither is she in hiding or the prisoner
of those who would do her harm. The
habeas corpus proceedings instituted by
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children against Joseph Bisson of 111
Trenton street commanding him to pro
duce Mrs. Bonnet in court proved of
avail. Bisson was charged with having
spirited the aged organ-grinder away,
but the charge was not substantiated.
Nevertheless it had its effect, and when,
in compliance with the order made by
Judge Hebbard, a few days ago, Bisson
appeared in court yesterday morning,
Mrs. Bonnet was by his side.
Bisson testified that the old woman
went to his home some time ago and
asked to be given shelter. He did so, and
since that time has provided for her.
Mrs. Bisson, her frame bent under tho
weight of years, next took the stand.
She corroborated Bisson's story. She was
deserted by Leonard Bonnet, with whom
she had lived and toiled for twenty-six
years, she said. He gave away the fur
niture of their home on Trenton street
and with their joint savings, amounting
to several thousand dollars, departed for
France. The organ she used to grind for
a living had also be*n given away by her
companion and was now in the posses
sion of Bisson. She asked that it be re
turned to her and Judge llebbard so or
dered. By consent of all parties the old
woman was placed in care of Blanche
Gaffe until such time as a guardian can
be appointed for her. The police in New
York are on the lookout for Bonnet, and
should he be found he will be arrested
and returned to this city for having le
vanted with a sack of gold, oDly half of
which belongs to him.
Grand Army Beunion.
The anniversary of the birth of General
George H. Thomasâ the "Rock of Chlek
amauga" â will be celebrated this evening
at the California Hotel by the Grand
Army post which bears the name of the
illustrious soldier. The celebration will
take the form of a banquet and reunion.
At the conclusion of the feast short
speeches will be the order of the occasion.
The affair promises to be one of the most
notable and enlivening ever held under
the auspices of George H. Thomas Post
No. 2, Department of California and Ne
vada.
Cruelty to a Dog.
Officer Walton of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has in
vestigated a case of harsh treatment to
a dog In the Mission, and he says that he
will to-day swear out a warrant for the
arrest of Mrs. Tracy of 43 Willow ave
nue. According to the story the woman's
children were playing with a stray dog
on the sidewalk, ami when the youngsters
of the Hospital Corps will accompany the
First Troop of Utah Cavalry to losemite
and Sequoia parks, leaving San Francisco
on August 5.
The members of the Seventh Califor
nia highly appreciate the work of the
Catholic Ladles' Aid Society. The ladies
have remade the soldiers' clothing when
ever found necessary and have sewed on
stripes and chevrons and have done much
other needle work. They have also fur
nished writing materials and in many in
stances have supplied the men with
stamps. To the sick they have been very
attentive, furnishing all kinds of delica
cies.
The Red Cross Society has applied to
General Merriam for a convalescent hos
pital at the Presidio. This hospital is
intended for the full recuperation of con
valescents before returning to duty. The
idea is approved by General Merriam
and he will probably see that It is car
ried out.
The Red Cross Society is making ar
rangements to send a large quantity of
supplies to Manila on the Scandia and
Arizona.
Fifty-First lowa.
The efforts of the Women's Relief
Corps, under whose auspices the mili
tary drill and entertainment will be held
this evening at the Mechanics' Pavilion,
are meeting with great success. The
tenting of the soldiers and the sham at
tack on the encampment, being different
from anything that has heretofore been
given, is the feature that seems to be in
teresting the public, and which promises,
along with the other exercises, to fill the
Pavilion to overflowing.
The songs, "Tenting on the Old Camp
Ground' and "Just Before the Battle.
Mother," to be rendered in chorus, prom
ise to be very effective, and, under the
circumstances, will be appreciated as they
have not been since the days of '63.
entered the house she saw that the lip
of one had been cut. The dog followed
the children upstairs into the house and
the woman wsls so enraged, believing that
the child had been bitten by the dog, that
she seized the animal and hurled it over
the banisters into the street, a distance
of 15 feet. , The fall broke the dog's leg,
and one of 'its eyes was knocked "but. Dr.
Creeley set the broken bone, but it was
found necessary to kill the animal to end
its sufferings.

United Presbyterian Church

Gibson, pastor of the First T'nited Pres
byterian Church of this city, were held

years preached the gospel. The sacred
edifice was crowded with the members of
his congregation and friends from other
churches from all over the State.
The services were impressive and were

Illness of Mother Russell.
The authorities of St. Marys' Hospital,
â¢where Mother Russell, superior of the in
stitution, is lying seriously ill, state that
' she is not suffering from a disease of the
heart, as rumored. They are. however,
reluctant to give the real cause of her
illness or to make a statement of the
danger attending the same. Mother Rus-
I sell, who is a sister of Lord Chief Justice
I Russell of England, has been connected
1 with St. Marys Hospital ever since the
early history of the institution. She is
possessed or great executive ability and
Is known far and wide as a lady whose
i charity has extended wherever, it was
found worthy to t.estow. She has been
a Sister of Mercy since her childhood.

The Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors met yesterday
afternoon and reported favorably on the
proposed ordinance regulating the busi
ness of junk dealers. If passed by the
board all junk dealers -will be compelled
to keep a record of all persons from
whom lead pipe, faucets, etc., are pur
chased. The object of the ordinance is
to assist the police In tracing stolen goods
and arresting the thieves.
The committee also reported in favor of
granting a permit to the Merchants' Ath
letic Club to give monthly amateur ex
hibitions of boxing and wrestling.

THE GRAPSUS PICA'S.
WITH something like a pyrotechnical display of
scientific lore and lingo, the return is an
nounced in our Eastern exchanges of a corps
.fit proiessors and students of Yale from the Bahama
Islands, where they have been engaged in the study
<of the marine zoology that swarms in those tropic
eeesv Rich and rare, it is said, are the treasures that
have been brought back, and according to all reports
the richest and rarest gem of the collected trophies of
science is a "grapsus piokus."
The name is not exactly familiar, but it will sound
to every Califomian as something that he ought to
recognize. The Century Dictionao' informs us that
the grap.su-; belongs tv the scries ocypodoidea of a
family of brachvurous, drcapod crustaceans. It is
further said of them that the carapace is quadrilateral,
the orbits are moderate, the postabdomen is very
wide; that they inhabit the seashore and run with
great rapidity.
We are not informed in what respect the pickus
differs from any other grapsus, but the New York
Times, aiter what stems to have been an inspection
of the treasure, says that where he is not brown he
is .eiiliar red or yellow. The scientists who gathered
hiTh in declare that his instincts are predatory and his
habits mysterious. With this much to go upon, it is
easy for us to reconstruct the brachyurian in every
form and feature and duly recognize him.
On this, coast the grapsus pickus is neither rich
, nor fare. He can be seen at any Democratic gather
ing: As a rule they are red, deeply tinged with yel
low,, Kke the Maguire specimen, but now and then
one .can bre found like the Hooded Gould type, that
presents a decidedly dun, brown appearance. In all
â  varieties the predatory instinct seems to be developed
largely, though occasionally it is absent, but the wide
.postrvbdonu-n and the mysterious habits are invariable
in the, species.
â  While aÂ« a rule all are brachyural, or short-tailed,
the qualification decapod does not apply to the local
tribe. So far from having ten feet, some of them
h'aven't a fopt to stand on. though the Maguire freak,
which-Ms now stretching over two platforms, implies
a tendency to approach the decapod type. As to
their inhabiting the seashore and running rapidly,
the question is an open one. On the Pacific
they 'in habit everywhere from the Sierras to Hono
lulu, and while they may not always run rapidly, it
is certain that whenever an office is in sight they run
the beÂ«t they can.
If. any Eastern college desires a grapsus pickus to
rival the Vale treasure the faculty should apply at
once to a Californian friend, specifying whether they
prefer the dun. brown. Hooded Gould type with cara
pace . quadrilateral, or the yellow Maguire with de
capod tendencies. The applications should be made
early, however, as we do not guarantee that any of
the species will be fit for preservation after they make
their periodical swarm up Salt River in November.
WELLS-FfIRGO PRETENSE.
IF 'the Wells-Fargo Express Company was sincere
in its repeated asseverations that it intended to
dimply with the law governing the war tax as
Â«oon' as the law had been construed, it has now no
further excuse for refusing to pay its share. To add
that there was never a belief in its sincerity is a mat
ter of Mrrple truth.
The company begged the Merchants' Association
tn Rofd off until a test case had been decided in the
East. More than one such case has been decided,
' all .a^gajnst the company. No other result was pos
sible, for the law is so plain that it cannot be twisted
even by a corporation lawyer. But the cases have
bferj; appealed to the United States Supreme Court,
and" the Wells-Fargo people still beg the merchants
to-bold off, to patiently continue to pay the tax which
ought, as the company knows, and as everybody else
knows, to be paid by the company. Iq other words,
thre- rich -company is trying to sneak out of its re-
EportFibrHries. It should not be permitted to do so.
Such action on the part of Wells-Fargo is partic
ularly niMn. To grant delay would be to cheat
tUepjiblic. The tax's being paid by patrons can
never, be recovered. By the time a decision could
bt' givcji by' the Supreme Court' the war would be
over, the expenses provided for, and Wells-Fargo
be alA'.tu view, an adverse ruling with the utmost
uflcOpcqrn. â  And this is the corporation which has
b.een regarded as liberal, and for which California
entertained respect. No jobbery more contemptible
mas ever attempted.
The duty of H. S. Foote, United States District
Attorney, is clear. Public sentimettt demands that
he begin at once action against Wells-Fargo. and
no longer wait for what may be done elsewhere.
Thy endeavor to make him wait is but part of the
scheme to bunko the people, and evade a tax as just
âºand as necessary.as any- ever imposed.
THE TERMS OF PEACE.
THE conditions of peace with Spain, which have
been outlined, and attributed to President Mc-
Kinley, will attract the attention of the world by
their extreme moderation. This admission of mod
eration, however, is from the standpoint of mili
tarism. There are two courses which the United
States may pursue, leading to the same end, but by
paths entirely different. A& the people and posterity
are vitally concerned in the choice soon to be made,
it is fair that each course should be fully and frankly
stated, and that the consequences to follow be
pointed out as far in the future as legitimate foresight
can go.
Referring to the principles which actuated the peo
ple of this country before and at the beginning of the
I controversy, the course of abstention from conquest
has a definite basis. Let that course be stated. The
government of her island colonies by Spain had un
dergone no change of methods for centuries. These
methods became less tolerable as aboriginal condi
tions disappeared and the colonists, touched and
elevated by commercial contacts, were enabled to
contrast their situation with that of the people of the
English, French and Dutch colonies within neigh
borly distance of them.
We made war to compel a change for the Spanish
colonies. We have vigorously prosecuted it to suc
cess. Projecting the declared purpose of the war into
the terms of peace, we can compel the independence
of Cuba, and its future government by its people
under such system as they freely select, with the over
shadowing understanding that we will no more per
mit the misgovernment of the island by Cubans than
by Spaniards. We may permanently secure coaling
and naval stations in the American and Asiatic
tropics. We may bind Spain in an agreement, to be
broken at her peril, for a Philippine government that
will respect the rights of man, open ports to com
merce and permit to the archipelago the penetration
of modern enlightenment, religious toleration and
civilized industrial methods. Then we can recall our
armies and navies, pay the bill and go about our own
business. The practical politician will call this an
ideal policy. It is. Let its strength be fairly exam
ined. Having demonstrated our power in war, and
the irresistible quality of our soldiers and sailors hav
ing been exploited on land and water from Santiago
to Manila Bay, the world will always know tnat be
hind this ideal policy there is a physical force that no
nation, nor combination of. nations, can resist. We
will be known as a people willing, at our own cost,
to inflict a lesson useful to those who endure and
those who inflict oppression. Thereafter, throughout
the world, the yoke of government will rest lighter
upon the shoulders of men, and this nation will be
the strongest that has ever existed. This strength will
be ours without a vast army or a magnificent navy.
We can create both whenever they are needed. No
one can then accuse us of ulterior motives when we
order lifted the hand of the oppressor and strike it oil
for refusal. We will become the agent of the regener
ation of the Spanish people. W r e will not be a stalk
ing horse for Don Carios and the means of the
medieval reaction which the success of Carlism will
mean in Spain. No nation will care to be our
enemy, and all will compete for our friendship. We
need make no alliances for our own sake. They will
seek us, and be ours to choose or refuse.
It will be observed that this policy differs entirely !
from that of every imperial nation from the begin
ning. It was not the policy of Babylon, nor Mace
donia, of Rome nor Carthage, of Charlemagne, of
Philip 11, nor Charles V, of Napoleon, nor of 'Ger
many and Russia. It is the policy of abstention, of
self-control, of unselfishness. It is a novelty in its
idealism. But our republic is ideal. It was founded
on a novel view of the rights of man and dedicated
to their recognition. In the line of its ideal purpose
it cannot become a conquering nation. More than â 
a century has passed since the idea, which was the 1 !
germ of its existence, was concreted in the constitu- â¢
tion. People complain that we have been a hermit '
nation. Recurring frequently to the advice of the !
fathers, we have not intruded upon the affairs of the
world further than was necessary to protect our own
people and secure by diplomacy the right of expa
triation in order that immigrants, alien born, might
be invested with our citizenship and partake of our
birthright. Granting the hermit character of our
past policy, let us consider the manner of our entrance â 
upon the world's stage to take a part thereon. What
shall be our cue and our character? In the beginning
of this Spanish war the cue was in line with our ideal
policy. Shall the character we play be that of re
publicanism or militarism? Shall we stand with the
nations, not a partaker in their policies, but in main
tenance of our own? The course herein stated puts
us on that great stage, to take a part in its complex
dramas, as still the republic of Washington and Jef
ferson; to exert the influence which our strength jus-
I tifies, in line with our professions and history; to
humanize government, to impress upon those in
authority the capacity of man to manage a larger
rather than a less part of his affairs. No other nation
has ever stepped on that stage in that character. If
we do not, we bring to it no novel feature. If we go
there to haggle over conquests, to dispute over the
division of spoils, to give and take blows in the in
terest of our imperial expansion and to repress the
same ambition in others, we will offer evidence that
sovereignty, shifted from one to many, loses none of
the virus with which it has poisoned the waters of life
from the beginning. If we go as believers in the right
of conquest, that he may take who has the power, and
he may keep who can, we go not in our moral but in
our military right, and until now no nation was ever
so strong in its military power that it did not meet
its conqueror.
We have inscribed on the keystone of the republic's
arch "Esto perpetua." Can it be perpetuated by ex
changing moral for military strength? That is the
issue to be decided, and we have endeavored to state
it fairly, as we will endeavor to state the arguments
for the opposite policy.
An effort to have a Call-Herald man expelled from
Madrid is not surprising. He has been telling the
truth, and he is in an enemy's country. When the
Examiner-Journal men are sent into exile the reason
is different. They are bounced from territory under
United States jurisdiction, and though accused of
many things have escaped any charge of telling the
truth.
Soldiers cannot be strongly condemned for at
tacking the owner and circulating agent of a pie
wagon. They have suffered considerable from sick
ness, and realize what has ailed them.
It is impossible to retain respect for a quartermaster
who has been stealing from the commissary. He is
too much like the fellows who annexed and sold Red
Cross Bupplies.
Wjth a pertinacity worthy of a better cause the
Examiner is still trying to bring Admiral Dewey into
:ontempt.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
BY a liberal application of whitewash Gould,
Curnow and Hale have covered the blackness
of the, stain on the administration and internal
management of Agnews Asylum, but the stench of
the unearthed scandal remains and the bad odor will
cling to the institution until a thorough cleansing
has been made. Moreover, it now appears that the
cleansing will have to include the eradication from
the asylum of Mr. Gould and his colleagues of the
San Jose gang.
To the general public the greater scandal of the
administration of the institution is not in any -way
associated with the loves, lawful or unlawful, the
jealousies or the rivalries of the subordinate employes.
It matters little whether the conduct of Gold's half
brother and the girls was or was not up to the normal
standard of Santa Clara County morality. Curnow
and Hale, who live in San Jose, are competent judges
on that point, and having now granted to that con
duct a certificate, "cum summa laude," the public has
hardly any further concern in the subject.
The graver, issue and one of importance to the
whole State is the disclosure that the directors have
made the asylum a "private snap" for the benefit of
their relations and political friends. The whole in
stitution, it appears, has been used for the benefit and
behoof of the managers, positions have been be
stowed without regard to fitness or fidelity, and
hardly even to decency. As a result the discipline of
the institution has gone to pieces. The medical di
rector himself, not free from suspicions of the
gravest character, holds the office, it appears, in vio
lation of the law, and of course has been able to do
nothing to check the vagaries of Gould's half
brother or any of the frisky friends of Curnow and
Hale.
Moreover, the use of the patronage of the institu
tion for personal or family advantage has led to dis
sensions among the directors themselves. The ma
jority of the board â Gould, Curnow and White â are
Democrats, and had they agreed they might have
worked the institution harmoniously on the spoils
system without serious scandal. Curnow, however,
is a Jim Rea Democrat, and Gould soon found that
he must join that gang if he wanted to make sure of
a place for his family connections and their girls.
He seems not to have hesitated in his choice. He
laid aside all loyalty to the Democratic party, all re
gard for the welfare of the institution, all respect for
his obligations to the State, all consideration for the
administration of the Governor who appointed him,
and stood in with the gang. As a result of the deal
he was enabled to introduce into the asylum that
fascinating half-brother whose attractions for ladies
have been the cause of so much vanity and vexation
of spirit among all the employes of the institution
from the innocent farmhands to the spotted Sponoglc
in the medical director's office.
This is the deeper scandal of Agnews Asylum â
that a State institution can be used by its directors
for strictly family benefits; that appointments can
be made without regard for merit or sen-ice, and in
direct violation of law. The true offenders at Ag
news are the three directors, Gould, Curnow and
Hale. What could Sponogle do to enforce discipline
and keep order in an institution where his subor
dinates in rank were the relations or the girls of his
superiors, where every one had a pull, and where any
interference on his part could be met with an im
pudent tra la la? Agnews needs cleaning, and the
cleansing process must begin at the top.
A ''GROWING" OPPOSITION.
WE observe with much interest that in one
quarter at least several Republicans of this and
three other outlying counties have opened the
State campaign in a manner that is not only enthu
siastic, but eminently "regular." A morning con
temporary, which every two years vigorously pro
motes the Senatorial prospects of its proprietor, an
nounces that the opposition to the renomination of
Congressman Loud of the Fifth District is "grow
ing." Forty men representing "leading" clubs in this
:ity, Santa Clara, San Mateo and Santa Cruz coun
ties called upon the State Committee on Thursday
and, according to this contemporary, "in the strong
est terms made known their opposition."
This may be said to be the "opening gun" of the
great fight for Republican victory In California in
1898. Opposition to the renomination of Congress
man Loud is "growing." We do not read that the
forty "leading" Republicans referred to by the morn
ing paper in question suggested any man to fill Air.
Loud's place. Indeed, no evidence is produced that
they were not all disappointed office-seekers intent
upon wreaking the revenge customarily distributed
in Republican "yellow dog" years, and which cus
tomarily results in turning Congress, the Legislature
and the State government over to the Democrats. The
shyness of our contemporary in giving their names
leads us to suspect that they were actually a band of
pap-suckers who have temporarily lost their grip
upon the public udder and who are charging around
hungrily searching for the man responsible for the
disaster.
It ought not to be necessary, however, to remind
our Senatorial contemporary and "leading" Repub
licans, not only of the Fifth but other Congressional
districts, that the interests of the State demand the
constant re-election of experienced Representatives.
Until a man has served in the Lower House two or
three terms he amounts to nothing. Chairmanships
are never given to unseasoned members. To retire
Loud at this time means that the Fifth District shall
go unrepresented in Congress for about six years,
or at least until the new man shall have mastered his
job and attained sufficient prominence to entitle him
to a recognition by his party. The operation of re
tiring Loud, to our mind, would resemble the dis
missal of a competent man and the filling of his place
with a blank.
If Congressman Loud had committed any political
crime, or had failed to represent his district, or had
neglected to get appropriations, it might be proper
to call him to account. But the "leading" citizens
who oppose him prefer but one charge. They say
it is rumored that Speaker Reed has written to the
railroad asking it to do what it can for Loud! Of
course this is terrible, if true. But why does not
somebody prove it? Certainly the "leading" Re
publicans of the Fifth District cannot ask us to credit
their unsupported statements in the midst of an ex
citing campaign.
However, we shall observe with interest the en
deavor of our contemporary and its "leading" Re
publicans to turn the Fifth District over to the Dem
ocrats. The successful accomplishment of the feat
ought to entitle the former's proprietor to the Sen
atorship.
Chicago morning papers have raised prices from
one cent to two cents. The act cannot be considered
an evidence of greed. A morning paper not worth
more than a cent 13 not worth the trouble of un

from the Caucasian standpoint. In his
Childlike, Innocent way, he will do things
which would send a European peddler to
jail for months, and no one will take
serious notice. That is why the decorous
gravUy of a Pine-street French restau
rant was rudc-ly disturbed the other
night.
The proprietor was busily engaged fill
ing bottles with the compound familiarly
known in the Latin Quarter as "dago
red." This is an operation which requires
great skill nowadays, since the war tax
fell with a sickening thud on the land.
Every bottle bears on its neck the 2 cent
stump required by law. When refilling
the bottle you must be careful not to
stain or destroy the stamp, or else it
could not be utilized again. With proper
precautions, the same stamp may he used
over dozens of times, and thus it hap
pened that the proprietor of the restau
rant, in his absorption, failed to notice
the entrance of the prohibited Chinese
peddler.
John marched gravely up to the center
table, where a half-dozen ladles and gen

lie held out a gauzy, lace-trimmed pet

turned her attention to a mysteriously
compounded entree.
"Allee litee," continued John, nothing
discouraged; "this one more better."
He held out a delirious dream in lace and
gauze, with frills and furbelows all over
it. His eyes shone with triumph as he
displayed this masterpiece of his pack.
"Only one dollar," said John.
It was just a question whether the inci
dent would end as a joke or a scandal ;
but, fortunately. the audience, having
well dined, saw the humorous aspect of
the case. A roar of laughter from -Ul
the tables delighted John, and taking this
as a sign of approval, he proudly trotted
round, the room, displaying his pair of
unmentionables to every lady present.
Just then the proprietor, having dodged
the war tax for the fiftieth" time that day,
arose and took in the situation at a

THE TAX
COLLECTOR
Strange Consistency
of James H. Barry.
WANTS TO GO TO CONGRESS
DEFIES THE LAW, YET WISHES
TO BE A LAW MAKER.
He Is a Resident of the Fifth Con
gressional District and a
Candidate in thÂ«
Fourth.
Now that Congressman Magrulre has
finally decided that his fluty to himself
and the people of the State lies in the di
rection of the Gubernatorial chair, In
stead of in Congress, where there la work
ahead for those who have the interests of
the State at heart and wish to save It
from the grasp of the corporations, a
host of would-be Democratic statesmen
have bobbed v:> with the announcement
that they are aspirants for the Congres
sional nomination in the Fourth District.
The fact that the district is supposed to
be . Democratic may or may not have its
influence with those who are falling over
each other In their efforts to secure this
particular nomination at a time when
other districts are going begging for i em
ocratic candidates. They are all willing
to offer themselves as a sacrifice on the
altar of their party, their only conuition
being that the altar shall bo, constructed
In the very center of the Fourth Congres
sional District.
At the head and front of this flying
wedge of hope-to-be Congressmen is
James 11. Barry, who is the guide, coun
selor and friend of the man whose shoes
he hopes to fill, besides enjoying the repu
tation of being the only genuine living cus
pidor on this side of the Rockies. He
gained the latter distinction through a
certain Incident that occurred at a meet-
Ing between himself and a gentleman
named N eagle.
Barry's legal residence is in the r iftn
Congressional District and in 1896 he was
a candidate for the Congressional nomin
ation from that district before the Demo
cratic convention at Redwood City. He
â¢ was turned down by the convention, a
'proceeding that Influenced him so strong
ly .that he Bet to work and did all In his
'â¢power to defeat the convention's nominee.
As his own district will have none of him,
he now proposes to grab the political pie
-.from the table of his neighbors over in
the Fourth District. From the fact that
he may. wun the assistance of his friend
â¢ and single tax brother, Magulre, succeed
in securing the nomination for which he
is reaching the matter of his Identity and
' his standing, as a good and law abiding'
citizen has become a subject of some inter
est to the citizens of the Fourth District
whom he aspires to represent in the halls
of Congress;. Those who have been in- '
vestigating the matter have ascertained j
that Barry Is the owner of a two-by-four \
weekly publication called the Star, which !
twinkles somewhere in the vicinity of ;
Montgomery and California streets and :
has a wide circulation on the bill boards
and dead walls in that vicinity. This ;
knowledge is In Itself unimportant save
for the fact that this same Star is a sewer
Into which some of the city's cash is oc- â 
casionally dropped in payment for the
publication of transient scraps of official
advertising.
Through the medium of the twinkling j
Star and the records of the Tax Collector !
it has become known that Barry is an
arrant advocate of the single tax theory
â that is to say, be is in favor of "very
Bingle person in the United States paying
taxes except himself. The records tell ;>n
unromantic story and one that is proving
to be of great Interest to the voters of me
Fourth District. They show that for y?ars
past and up to the present time Barry
has been paid considerable sums of money
for official advertising. They also show
that since 1890 he has steadily and con
sistently refused to pay his personal taxes
and that on this account he is now Indebt
ed to the city in the sum of 1568, includ
ing the. year 1898. The records do not
show that he has ever refused to take the
money. paid into the treasury lor taxes by
honest citizens In payment for his print
ing bills. It is a fact, however, that he
steadily refuses from year to year to
make a statement to the Assessor, and
when he is of necessity assessed arbi
trarily he rises in his wrath and takes a
solemn oath not to pay a cent, because
he is now and always has been opposed to
arbitrary acts by officials of the munici
pality. In this connection it may be stal
ed that Barry is the particular friend of
"Whispering Gavin McNab and is a
member of that collection of able-bodied
reformers known as the Committee of One
Hundred, which was brought Int.) exist
ence by the Three Tailors of Tooley Street
for the purpose, of disposing of .;o> 1 bricks
to the local Democracy.
Having a supreme contempt for the !r.tv,
particularly that part of it relating to
the payment and collection of taxes, Bar
ry has now made public his desire to ha>-e
the voters and lav/ abiding citizens of the
Fourth Congressional District reach over
into the Fifth Congressional District
pluck him from behind his locked and
bolted office door, and give him a front
seat among the nation's law-makers at
the National Capitol. In the language of
the showman: "What will the little lady

AN ADDRESS TO POPULISTS.
MESSRS. MILTON, Carlson
and E. M. Wardell reply as
follows to the proclamation of
Thomas V. Cator and others:
To the Populists of California: The
undersigned, delegates to the State
convention of. the People's party, de
sire to make a few statements for the
purpose of correcting the bombastic,
misleading and strictly personal pro
nunciamento recently Issued by T. V.
Cator, with the assistance and con
nivance of D. T. Fowler, Green Maj
ors, W. it. Batten and Carleton H.
Johnson.
The Gator statement begins with
the assertion that the delegates
named above were appointed a com
mittee by the State convention of the
People s party.
That statement Is incorrect for the
reason that the People's party con
vention did not appoint any such
committee.
The Cator statement attacks the
position of the San Francisco delega
tion and questions the validity of its
acts.
Mr. Cator knows that any irregu
larity or attempted irregularity in
the selection of the San Francisco
delegates was of his own making,
and he was openly charged with sucn
irregularity during the State conven
tion by Mr. Asbury Johnson of San
Francisco, who is well known
throughout the State.
Mr. Cator states that the "conven
tion" which selected the San Fran
cisco delegation gave "unanimous in
structions against fusion."
Mr. Cator knows that the San Fran
cisco delegates were selected by the
County Centra] Committeeâ not by a
conventionâ and that the committee
had no authority to bind or to in
struct the delegates.
Mr. Cator knows that most of the
said committeemen did not vote upon
minor questions for the reason that
they did not wish to show their vot
ing strength till it came to the more
Important matter of selecting dele
gates to the State convention.
Mr. Cator knows that ho himself
was beaten when the delegates were
selected, and that he afterward got
a place in the delegation by subter
fuge.
Mr. Cator asserts that the minority
withdrew from the convention as
soon as Maguire was nominated.
Mr. Cator knows that nobody
"withdrew" from the convention at
that session or at any other session;
that upon the completion of that
day's session a motion made by a
member of the "minority" that the
convention adjourn till 9 o'clock a. m.
the next day was regularly put and
carried.
ily engaged in preparing a bolters'
convention was held till George W.
Baker came up hurriedly from San
Francisco, after Maguire was nomi
nated, and consulted with Cator.
Mr. Cator knows that the "with
drawing" was done in the darkness of
the night, and that many of those
who "bolted" afterward bolted from
the bolters when they discovered the
deception that was practiced upon
them. _
Messrs. Cator & Co. assert that
members of other parties were seated
as delegates in the convention, and.
that they were allowed to place candi
dates in nomination.
Messrs. Cator & Co. know that none
but members of the People's party
with proper credentials, were seated
in the convention as delegates. They
know that two members of the Silver
Republican party were allowed the
privilege of the floor for the purpose of
eulogizing the candidates for tho two
positions allotted to that party, and
that such candidates were afterward
regularly placed In nomination by dele
gates to the convention.
Mr. Cator claims to be opposed to
fusion, as a matter of principle, and lie
knows that he has been an advocate of
fusion in every Populist State conven
ti >n held in this State previous to th.s
7 In 'his manifesto Mr. Cator proteins
to believe that the so-called ticket, put
t.r by himself and a few others should
have a place upon the ballot as the
regular Populist ticket.
Mr. Cator knows that section 1130 of
the Political Code makes that ticket il
legal and will, therefore, prevent Its
being placed upon the legal ballot.
The Political Code, section 1190, reads
as follows: , .
"No person shall join in nominating,
under the provisions of this code, moiro
than one nominee for each office to be
filled; and no person who has vote.] in
a convention for or asalnst a candi
date for any office shall Join in nomin
ating, in any manner, any other nom
inee for that office."
Mr Cator knows that his attention
was called to the above section of the
Political Code on the day that he led
the so-called bolting convention, and
that he then stated that he knew that
part of the code thoroughly, because,
as he said, he "had helped to compile
it."
If he took such steps with his eyes
open, he is all the more to blama for
his action. Â£
.lust previous to the nomination of a
candidate for Governor Mr. Cator
practically agreed to support Buch
nominees as would sign the platform,
and he seconded a resolution offer< â !
by Mr. Carlson requiring all nominees
to sign the platform; the purpose of
said resolution being to unite all the
warring factions.
Mr. Cator comes before the Popu
lists of California avowing that he
always was a false prophet and a blind
and ignorant guide, and he has tho
monumental audacity to nsk the peo
ple to believe that he Is now the only
true political guide.
Mr. Cator spent much of his time at
the '-'invention In -open consort with
pome of tho most notorious of tho
lobbyists of the Southern Pacific, and
hf> was in frequent consultation with
ithern Pacific attorneys of all
the parties who hung about the con
vention.
Mr. Cator gives every evidence that
POPULISTS FEELING SORE.
Claim They Were Deceived
by the Maguire De
mocracy.
Th" Board of Election Commissioners
will meet In special session this morning
to formally pass on the namra of those
selected to act as precinct registration of
ficers. A meeting for the same purpose
was called for yesterday afternoon, but
the "programme" had to be rearranged
and a postponement was necessary.
It is expected that there will be a lively
time "nhen the commission meets. The
fusidnist Populists are beginning to re
alize that the. Magulre-Oallagher Demo
crats played the whale nnd Jonah act on
them at the Populist convention in Sacra
mento. They swallowed Maguire and the
Maguire Democracy has In turn swallow
ed them. The fuslonists were led to be
lieve, thut they would receive proper rec
ognition when the time came tor the dis
tribution of the political plums. As one
of them put the mutter yesterday, they
have been badly deceived. "We Populists
who stood by Maguire," said he, "expect
ed a fair representation on the registra
tion and election boardÃ. Wo are getting
it. The Populists have been given repre
sentation, but In the majority of cases
the representatives are not the ones we
wanted. The list of precinct registration
officers will show the Populist affiliation
of many officers, but if the label 'Popu
list' ll taken off you will find 'Democrat
underneath. But what Is the use of cry-
Ing over spilled milk? It won't do any
rood I suppose we will have to take the
label, knowing that the article given is
not genuine."
The list of officers was pruned yester
day and many changes made. It was
fmind In some instances that the officers
selected did not live in the precincts in
Which they were to serve, and, further
more. It is alleged that several of the
"chosen ones" had not been long enough
out of jail to have their past misdeeds
civilly forgiven.
ASK HIS DISBARMENT.
Attorneys Francoeur and Beatty
Take Action Against Joseph
Hutchinson.
George 11. Francoeur and Henry N.
Boatty, attorneys of this Hty, presented
a petition to Judge Belcher yesterday
asking for the disbarment of Attorney
and Politician Joseph Hutchinson. The
petition for the disbarment of Hutchin
son arises out of the death of Anni<Â»
Johnson, a domestic, which occurred In
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
his present opposition to fusion is
based upon the evident impossibility
of his being elected to any office; his
personal spite against James G. Ma
guire, and the strange influence which
the Southern Pacific has acquired over
Mr. Cator himself.
Professor D. T. Fowler, who signs
the Cator manifesto, and thereby
sanctions the queer Catorisms, went
into the fusion caucus at Sacramento
on the. evening of July 11, IS9B. Then
Professor Fowler gave his pledge that
ho favored fusion. Professor Fowler
was a candidate before the caucus for
the position of fusion caucus nomineÂ©
lor chairman of the State convention.
Professor Fowler was not the suc
cessful candidate before the caucus,
but he then and there pledged his
support to the successful candidate
for the caucus nomination, and he re
newed bis pledge to support fusion in
the convention. The next day, with
out giving any reason for his* sudden
change of front. Professor Fowler
astonished everybody by declaring
that he was opposed to fusion.
On the night of the second day of
the convention, Professor Fowler was
found with Mr. Cator and others bus-
Mr. Cator knows that no bolters'
ticket. Professor Fowler's remarkable
allegations concerning fusion come
with peculiar ill-grace from a man of
Ills learning and ability and political
experience who took three pjedges to
support fusion In the course of one
evening, only about two weeks ago,
and who incontinently broke all those
pledges the very next day, without
the formality of suggesting any plan
of fusion which might be acceptable
to him.
Nothing need be said concerning the
other three members of Cator's com
mittee. Evidently they did not speak
for themselves.
Mr. Cator's attack upon Mr.quire Is
known to be because of jealousy and
personal spite, and Is backed up by
garbled extracts from the CongTes
filona! Record and by other distorted
statements.
The fact that tho so-called bolters*
convention of thirty or forty adopt
ed the plfttforra of the regular con
vention proves that something be
sides principle actuated the leaders
of the bolt.
Messrs. Cator and Fowler know that
the great majority of Populists, the
Democrats and the Silver Republicans
have many political Ideas In common.
1 hey know also that the cardinal prln
cipl, s (.i" th" People's party are rap-
Idly permeating all the liberal part of
the body politic.
They know that nearly all of those
re Interested in trusts and
monopolies and Bpecial privileges have
be, n or have gone without be
ing driven, into the Republican party.
They know that only such monopo
lists a* bid for a price for treachery
remain In the Populist, Democratic
or Silver Republican parties. They
know that such traitors are being dls
c'plined and banished as fast as they
are found out and that the liberal
parties are rapidly becoming purer
and more devoted to liberalism.
Messrs. Cator and Fowler know that
the late convention of the People's
party, which met at Sacramento, wns
beset by more varieties of external.
Internal and infernal foes than ever
before hovered about a convention in
this Stat:.
Messrs. Cator and Fowler know that
republican emissaries were there to
prevent fusion, if it could be present
ed by them.
They know that one treacherous
Silver Republican was there to fight
apalrst fusion. "':â  â¢ .â
They know that a few alleged Dem
ocrats who were in the employ of tlie
Southern Pacific were there to oppose
fusion. > ;
': hey know that at least two or three
alleged members of the People's party
who are on the Southern Pacific pay
roll were at Sacramento to oppose fu
sion at any cost.
They know that enough unholy
creatures were there fighting fusion
to make the cause of fusion seem al
most holy in the eyes of those who
saw clearly.
They know that there were also
enough honest but misguided anti-fu
sionists to make the fusionlsts almost
despair of success. â¢ . . .- â¢
They know that ev.^ry gold stand
ard monopolistic Journal in the State
opposes fusion; that every adherent
of Alger opposes fusion; that every
one of Huntington's minions opposes
fusion; that every Republican otnee
holder opposes fusion: that every foe
to liberty opposes fusion.
They know also that the weak and
the oppressed cry aloud for fusion
between the scattered forces of the
liberals as the only possible means of
securing justice and the equality of all
men before the law. And they know
that the nomination of James G. Ma
guire and the probability of the suc
cess of the plan for honorable fusion
has caused a greater rattling of po
litical and monopolistic dry bones
than was ever before heard in this
State.
And everybody knows that the pres
ent campaign in California is exciting
more interest throughout the United
States than any other political con
test that is now going on.
They know that if we are true to
our principles we will clasp "hands in
friendship with all who believe as we
do, remembering that:
"United we stand, divided we fall.
We therefore call upon all who want
a change for the better in our affairs
of state to candidly and calmly con
sider the conditions which confront
the people of this State. Scrutinize
the candidates and consider well the
platform and principles which they
are pledged to carry out. If mis is
done we have no fear for the result.

HOLLANDER'S
AWFUL PLAN
OF REVENGE
" Brandy Jim" Blame's
Rival Enlisted.
BUT AFTERWARD RELENTED
OTHERWISE THE SPANISH DOITS
MIGHT BE TREMBLING.
Madeleine Bouton's Brave "Boy"
Was Only Deterred From the
Field by Thoughts of
Dear Ones.
Not content with having vanquished
Captain Blameâm ore popularly known as
"Brandy Jim"â Sumner K. Hollander
paused for a moment in the swirl of his
rose leaf life on Thursday and determined
to obliterate Spanish rule in the islands
of the Philippines by joining the First
New York Volunteers.
But the eternal afterthought changed
his plans, and now Sumner has decided to
return to Boston and the home of his an
cestors where all is eternal peace and
beans.
The story of the Hollander boy is one of
many tints and phases. His career has
been punctuated with the popping of wine
corks, and he has been popularly branded
as a good fellow.
When Sumner R. Hollander determined
to Income a private in the ranks of the
FlrSt New York Volunteers It was almost
a foregone conclusion that the waves of
the l J a<;llic from the Golden Gate to the
Hawaiian Islands would be speckled with
the corks Unit popped from the fragrant
and effervescent wines of Champagne.
The news that Sumner K. Hollander,
tlu- young Bostonlan who was willing to
sacrifice his life for the heart of a maid
playing upon the stage, was about to
join the First New York Regiment was
greeted with the wildest enthusiasm by
the privates and non-commisloned officers
of that organization.
To be sure there were other young men
of unlimited means and unquenchable
thirst In the ranks of the First New
York, but there is always room for an
other "opener," no matter how exclusive
or crowded the set may be.
Sumner R. Hollander, after winning the
heart of Madeleine Bouton of the Fraw
ley Company and vanquishing the son of
a great American, grew weary of his
triumphs and longed for other fields to
conquer. So he bethought himself and
dt-t< rmlned to link his fortune with the
fate of tho gallant First New York Vol
unteers.
First he called on Captain Grade of
Company E and communed with him for
a while. He told him he wanted to be a
soldi, r; that he was tired of life and that
on tin- ashes of the lire he had already
burned he wished to erect a structure
that could be chronicled among tne
Bhrines of the dogs of war.
Captain Grade argiu d with him and
explained to him the succession of hard
ships and deprivations that fall to the
lot of the soldier. But Sumner R. Hol
lander was obdurate and insisted on en
listing. So he was turned over to Cap
tain Staats, the recruiting officer. That
was <>n Wednesday.
To Captain Stoats he told his story.
The captain assured him that while he
was pleased to have such a personage ap
ply for â¢nlistroent in the ranks of the
gallant First New York he was afraid
that the hurly burly life about the camp
fire would bo too fatiguing for a young
man whoso greatest effort in life was the
ordering of a waiter to "put another
bottle on ice."
Hut Hollander protested and finally
Captain Staats consented to seriously ac
cepting him as a ivoruit. At 6 o'clock
on Wednesday evening they parted with
tho understanding that Hollander wns to
enlist In the First New York on Thurs
day. That afternoon Hollander la said to
have wired his folks that he was going
to wade in tho seas of blood that swash
the shores of tho Philippines as a private
In tho First New York Volunteers. For
a few moments the wires between the
PrUaco Hotel and Boston wore hot with
dots and dashes going to and coming
from the elder and tho younger Hol-
At the expiration of the affair on the
ticker young Hollander, who had quelled
tho finme of "Brandy Jim" Elaine's duel

announced that he had no further ambi
tion to become a soldier.
When Captain Sta.its. tho recruiting of

was greatly depressed, and the men of the
First New York Regiment were sad and
downcast at tho doleful .tidings. For even

West End Republicans.
The organization of the West End Re
publican Club was effected last nisrht by
the representative men of the Thirty
seventh District. Tt was determined to
include in the membership of the club nil
members of the party residing: also in tho
Thirty-eighth District, thus making the
club representative of the Twenty-first
Senatorial District.
The rlub proved a power In the last
campaign and the members expect to be

FLYING HOUNDS
AFTER
FLEET HARES.
Tt required something like thirty years
to lift coursing to the plane of a popular
sport on this coast. But it has attained
Buch a place, ami from present indica
tions many years will elapse beforo it
wanes. The spacious grand stands at
tho pnrks continue to show an increasing
attendance weekly. New dogs are being
sought throughout tho country and even
throughout tho world. Competent train
ers no longer know empty pockets. Pup
pies are reared as carefuly as high-born
Infants. It is the era of coursing and of
"the trreyhound.
At Inglesiue to-day an open-stake and a
â¢aplitiK event will be rim down, and the
lies run off to-morrow. At Union Park
tlio feature is ;m all-ape, open stake, em
bracing seventy-two thoroughbred can
didates. At both parks the sport should
be of the warmest kind. The best stock
at pns.-nt or; the coast will be seen in
the two open events. Tho sapling con
test hits brought out many fledglings new
to the slips, but all have been tried in pri
vate and many are declared to be em
bryo champions.
Tho aggregate strike money disbursed
at the two parks to-day is over $ltsoo.
Last week' 8 work at Ingieside showed
a marked improvement in several of the
performers that of late have seemed
" hardly at their best. The most noticeable
Were: Mialmo.- Mohawk, Crosspatch, Hot
Stuff, Bwinnerton, Rathbone and Prince
Hal. All will â go to the slips again at
one or the other of i..c parks to-day, and
even better work will doubtless be shown.
Picking the final winner at Union Park
this week will tax the ability of the
ertrowdest. Curtis & Son, the Pasha' ken
nels and E.V. Sullivan look to have the
:biÂ£ end of the game with some one of
their numerous candidates, but the sport
of coursing is fraught with much uncer
tainty.
The record of winnings at Ingleslde
since the opening of the year shows a
string of greyhounds to be a valuable
holding. The Dean stable has been the
most profitable, Moondyne having won
31092 50, Connomara $799, Gladiator $660,
Mialmo $444 and Brilliantine $2 50; total,
â S29?!>. Lowe & Thompson's kennel is also
well up, with a gross winning of $1599. of
which Patria landed 5599. Victor $217 50,
High Born Lady $202 50, Prince Hal $190,
Prince of Fashion $66. Phoebe $25 and Sir
"Willful $10. During the same period Kay
& Tiant have called on the Ingleside
management for (1398, Deckelman & Pa
nario for $12."9. D. Hooper for $972, Lynch
A Ma her for 1620 60, J. Byrnes for $502 50,
and Larkey & Rock for $482 50. Resides
â¢the foregoing, too, all the owners named
have won various sums at Union Park,
Dean, Larkey i\: Rock and Hooper having
landed stakes therein.
Lowe 0c Thompson are giving Sir Will
ful hi* first run at Union Park to-day.
The big dog should make a good show
ing. '
: â¢The field at Inglesldo has been gone
over during the week and is in almost
perfect condition. The running will prob
ably be much Improved in consequence.
i.. V. Sullivan has seven candidates at
Union Park to-day. Curtis & Sons and
the Pasha kennels are close up. each with
live,- while. R. E. do B. Lopez bases his
hopes on four.
The drawing for next week's sport at
Ingleside will take place at Pythian Hall
next Thursday night, instead of Friday.
Thursday will also continue to be the
night of future drawings.
; E. R. Smith and Charles Dryden of Los
Angeles are negotiating for several long
tails at both Ingleside and Union Parks.
They will probably take back with them,
next week, a considerable string.
The secretary of the Union Coursing
Perk Association writes the sporting edi
tor that the great Produce stake, which
will bo run in the near future, closed on

IN THE FIELD OF SPORT
BASEMAN GAGUS
SHOULD
NOW RETIRE.
Popular Charley Gagus, alias "Buck,"
alias "The Jap," the grand old man of
baseball on this coast, it is said, intends
re-entering the game.
Rumor has it that way, but from
what I have heard on the subject I am
inclined to believe that it is one of those
false rumors and that Charley's days as
a "star" player are a thing of the past.
His friends will not entertain the idea
that he contemplates such a move, and I
have been asked at least two hundred
times whether or not it was possible for
a man who was the idol of baseballdom
about the year 1569 to re-enter the sport
In ISOS and be successful. The question
really baffles me, as I do not recollect of
ever hearing of a player returning to the
game after an absence of nearly a half
century. However, the National League
has this year demonstrated that it is
possible for players, after a few years'
absence, to return and gain new laurels,
so it might be conjectured that Gagus, if
age has not materially interfered with
his speed and throwing propensities,
could duplicate this feat of those Nation
al LeagiJors.
To see and talk with Gagus, one who
is familiar with his past record as the
king of second basemen and is also aware
of the fact that he Is at the present time
in his dotage, cannot help but admire his
youthful appearance and beautifully pro
portioned physique; also his determina
tion to make clear the fact that people,
especially ball-players, are as young only
as they feel.
The writer had the pleasure of Inter
viewing the famous fellow but a day ago
for the purpose of ascertaining the truth
fulness of the report that his reappear
ance was soon to be a reality.
I could not refrain from wondering, on
being ushered into his presence, what a
strange coincidence it was that I should
be Interviewing â  man on baseball who,
in days pone by, I had gone to see always
in the care of B parent or brother, for
you must remember that Gagus played
many years ago ar.d that I was but o
child, so young that I had to be carried
to the park and home again for fear of
being k'jit.
I was received with the usual courtesy,
for Charley is a genteel chup, and on
putting the question "Is it a. fact, Mr.
Oaugiis, that you intend returning t<s the
diamond?" my query met with the fol
lowing retort: "No, sir; I am too old
to play ball. True. I am exceedingly
fond of the game, but I have taken The
harness oft', never to don it again. I
feel young and strong, however, and am
liable to fool some or theye people who
seem to think me an exempUlicatlon of
the real 'has been.' "
"But these rumors, Mr. Gagus. where
do they originate?"
"Oh, I suppose some of my old club
mates of former years, such as Mr. Hunt,
now a Superior Judge In the City Hall,
have started the story."
The mention of Judge Hunt's name In
connection with the national game was
indeed a surprise, for I had never heard
of him in that capacity, and asked Ga
gus If he was not mistaken.
"Why. Mr. Hunt and i played in the
same team at the time the Red Stock
ings came out here."
This I remembered to be before I had
seen' the light of day.
"And what a grand team it was. There
was Gus Nixon, first base; John Calvert,
catcher; John Walen, pitcher; Pete Mar
they, snort stop; SI Wade, third base;
John Dlrkie.. center field; Judge Hunt
left field; "Parse" Miller, right field, and
myself second base. The grounds were
then at Twenty-fourth and Polsom, and
I tell you there were good ball games in
those days."
Unfortunately I could not discuss these
bygone days which were, I assure you,
a source of great pleasure to Mr. Gagus,
and was compelled to retire, not, how
ever, until I had thanked the gentleman
for his information, which was interest
ing. 1 still entertained the opinion that
there were a few games left in the old
veteran, and so considered it a wise plan
to interview a few of his intimate friends
on the subject. After doing so I kicked
myself on that part less capable of mak
ing a defense, as Goldsmith would say.
for all those I interviewed were of the
Fame opinion, that if Gagus played ball
again the sun would cease to give heat
but would continue with the light.
A few opinions are given lor future ref
erence:
Judge Huntâ What, Charley Gngus go
ing to play ball again? Impossible; mv
dear sir, impossible.
Dan Learyâ I crazy? Is this entire
world crazy, or are you crazy? Is Char
ley Gagus too old to play ball? Why, he
is. old enough to be your great-great
grandfather. For goodness 1 Bake ask me
something plausiole.
"Well. Mr. Leary, do you think Mr
Gagus could get in good enough condition
to play ball?
"If given a year's steady practice the
chances â you, the chances â are that
lie might. But do you know that Gagus
has been in the game longer than An
son?"
I answered in the negative and received
another surprise by being assured that he
had.
Rube Lew- could not play mar
bles, let alone ball. He is too old.
Mike Finnâ l got on to myseu seven
years ago. Gagus is much older than I
am.
Hen Harrisâ Ye gods! You don't mean
that Gagus Intends playing ball again?
"Yes. I 1 do."
"Well, then, it will be a sad sight. I
could not bear to see it."
Jack Gleaaonâ l have been slck all day.
Don't bo joking.
George Ryanâ Buck is a good fe'.low,
but he can't play ball, He is much older
than you Imagine, j . .
Heelev â What a gall some people
have! r>Jow just think of that "never waser"
thinking that he can play ball. He nover
could play. I tell you, never, and if he
attempts It again Just watch- the recep
tion that will be accorded him.
After interviewing these people I have
arrived, at the conclusion that after a.
lapse of- forty years it is time for a player
to stay at homo and live in the gloried of
the past. ' '
To-day's game will be a hot one. Th*
line-up "is as follows:

THE SAIST FRAKCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
LADIES' DAY AT
DOLPHIN
CLUB TO-MORROW
The fouling- of the Pioneer boat by the
South Ends in the senior barge event last
Sunday, and the lons lead gained by the
Alamedas in conseqeunce, deprived the
spectators of the pleasure of seeing a. fine
race from the stakes home between the
South Ends and the Alamedas. Tha
South Ends had a good lead at the turn,
and say that they were rowing 1 well with
in themselves. It Is highly probable that
they would have given the Alamedas a
hard struggle.
At the semi-monthly meeting of the
South End Rowing Club last Tuesday
live applications for membership were
received, two being from men who have
rowed in the East, an<i who should be
good material for a Junior crew. It is
proposed to get up a match race between
the Alameda senior crew and the "Mid
gets." J. Foley, last year's Junior cham
pion, will enter the senior single shell
race.
All the boats available at the Ariel
While camped on Leech Lak.e Mountain,
twenty miles north of Round Valley, Men
doclno County, Dr. Charles Litton of this
quarters will be used to-morrow to carry
members round to the Dolphin reception.
The hew Ariel barge will be ready at
the end of August; it will be slightly
heavier than the Alameda barge, being
more strongly braced. The club will or
der new sets of sculls for skiffs.
The Alameda men in going home from
El Campo last Sunday in a launch en
countered very rough water; almost all
hands were seasick, the secretary being
put ashore at Berkeley; the launch's
yuwl broke loose and was not recovered.
At the last monthly meeting S. J. Pem
broke was appointed a committee of one
to ascertain whether there is any race
for four-oared barges at the Astoria re
gatta on Augunt 19, 20 and 22, and, if
there is, to make arrangements for the
Alameda senior crew to enter it. Several
of the Alamedas will be at the Dol
phin reception to-morrow. Three Junior
crews will begin work to-morrow, and.
after they have had some practice to
gether there will be a try-out between
them. One junior crew will consist of
F. S. Cone, Ed Edwards, Bert Guild and
C. G. Ayers, but their positions in the
boat have not yet been settled. They are
strong men, and should .::ike a good
crew. The senior crew will keep together.
E. T. M. Eckert and Edwin Thornliiir
were elected members, and there are two
more applications for membership.
The present Quarters of The Olympic
Boat Club at Tlburon are owiii'd by the
Belvedere Land Company and are not en
tirely satisfactory. It is proposed to
form a stock company to put up a
two-Storied clubhouse, having on the
lower floor a handball court. To carry
out this plan a hundred members are
necessary, and the dues would have to be
raised.
At a special meeting of the Dolphin
Boat Club on Wednesday evening It was
decided to buy a barge built by Twlgg
and to procure seats and oars from the
East. She is built on the lines of the
South End Blister and the fast Stockton
barge. To-morrow will be ladles' day at
the Dolphin quarters, which have been
newly painted and look very attractive.
The committee which has the arrange
ments in charge consists of W. O. Patch,
T. J. Kennedy, F. Woorner. B. P. Sulli
van and A. W. Pape. The officers are as
follows: Referee, A. Rothkopf; stnrt.nr,
A. P. Treadwell; announcer, T. J. Sulli
van; marshal of course. E. P. Sullivan;
judges. C. Roach, J. I^aib iind J. S. Enrls.
The race for the A. P. Treadwell media]
for Junior skiffs will be rowed, the entries
being E. P. Bartman, Victor Caglleri. T.
J. Hopkins and C. M. Farroll.
The Irish and German fours will row
from the clubhouse around a ship an
ehorad off Alcatrai and back. The Irish
crew hns the choice of boats and course.
It consists of C. M. Farrell. bow, T. J.
Kennedy, No. 2; W. O. Patch, No. 3; T.

PREPARING FOR
THE
NATIONAL FEST.
The big shoot of the National Schuet
zen Bundfest at Glendale, N. V., is still
the chief topic of conversation among lo
cal riflemen. The Interest is greater than
usual because of tho fact that the next
festival. In 1901, is to be held in this city.
It will be some time before any very act
ive work is done In the line of preparing
for this event, i but the members of the
local clubs will not remain idle. There
are committees to form nnd a plan of
action to lay out and change from time
to time as new conditions arise. The first
to begone is to organize the clubs. At
the present time there are only ?*vo clubs
members of the bundâ tho San i raneisco
Schuetzen Club and the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club. All of the other shooting
organizations, about two dozen. In this
city and adjoining- towns, will have to be
come members and get in touch with the
spirit and history of the national body.
Within the next month or so there are
likely to be a number of meetings of the
city bowled over a magnificent bucK
which dressed 140 pourjds. fi 30-30 Win
chester dispatched the bullet to its fioal
leading riflemen of this city. At these
gatherings committees will be selected
and the work apportioned among the sev
eral organizations.
There is every reason to believe that
â when the crack shots from the East come
out here they will find more good shots
than thay had any Idea of meeting. When
the representative* of California went
East recently they dv. some {'me work,
and that, too, under adverse conditions.
1). \V. McLaughlin, who has Just come
back, states that it takes several days
to get the motion of the train out of the
body, and when in the shooting stand the
swaying of the cars Is felt. For all that
they upheld the honor of the State. This
is shown by a letter from F. O. Young,
who. after telling of the success of Will
Hayes, the crack Eastern shot, pay.-:
"McLaughlin was high on the standard
target with 48. He also made. 93 on the
man target and 71 on the ring target and
335 on the king. I made 332 on the king-"
Mr. Young is one or the most enthusi
astic members of the Columbia Club and
he could not resist the tempta
tion to arrange for a match with
one of the best bodies of re
volver .shooting clubs in the East. He and
J. E. Gorman of the same local club vis
ited the Brooklyn Revolver Club and of
their visit he writes: "Get ready for a re
volver match with them on the Columbia
target in the fall, 20 yards, five or six
men." A few days later he and Gorman
went to the Walnut Hill range, near Bos
ton. The California men must have as
tonished the bean-eaters, for they beat
them badly with the pistol. On the stand
ard American target Gorman made 9r. and
93 and Young made 92 and 91. Thi|fcÃos
tonlans' best was from 87 down.

To-day the annual cruise up the Sacra
mento River is eet down on tho pro
grammes of the five yacht clubs. The
boats that take part In the event wil-1 be
accompanied by the rest of the Ueet, and
the escorts will return to their moorings
to-morrow. So many owers, however,
have already been dp the river this sea
son that it is probable that there will be
a small number of boats on the cruise. F.
A. Schober, R. H. Morrow. D. Erskine, C.
H. Buck and Guy Ransome, the well
known Corinthian yachtsmen, will go up
tTie river in the sloop Clara, which has
already made two or three similar trips
this summer. Commoflore T. L. Hill of
the San Franclscos makes a trip up thÂ«
Sacramento almost every year, but at
present he and Mrs. Hill are cycling In
the Yellowstone National Park. Vice
Commodore G. T. S. White cruised up to
Napa City and afterward to Walnut
Grove early in June in Arthur D. Naylor's

Xapa Creek. Ex-Commodore I. Gutte's
Ch&pa haa been cruising a pood deal In
the upper bay lately, and \V. S. Goodfel
low's schooner La Paloma is still at Santa
Catallna Island. In the al ?nce of Com
modore Dr. T. L. Hill the vice commodore
hus declared to-day and to-morrow
"open." so that it is doubtful whethar
any of the San Francisco fleet will take
part in the cruise.
Last Sunday Vice Commodore G. T. S.
White of the San Pranciscos and Arthur
D. Naylor were at McNear's in the lat
ter's sloop Twilight, and they propose to
spend next week in Tiburon Cove in the
Bioop Will o' the Wisp. On Thursday
night the Bachelors' Cotillon Club gave a
dance at Sausalito in the San Francisco
Yacht Club house.
F. F. Ames' sloop Ella was at McNear's
Landing last Sunday and many of the
Corinthian fleet cruised off El Campo or
anchored in Paradise Cove.
Port Captain J. H. Keefe is making ar
rangement! at the Corinthian Club house
for a clambake on the afternoon of Sat
urday, August 6.
Last Tuesday Delaney and Lally started
on an up-river trip. Harry W. Brydges'
sloop Hope, E. N. Walter and Laughland
Brothers' sloop Embla, H. S. Pratt's
yawl Idler and Carl A. Tarnberg's The
North Stai will Join the up-river cruise.
On board the yawl Idler will be H. S. and
Mrs. Pratt, A. Buncombe, W. C. Wallace
and others. On board Embla will be Com
modore C. J. Lancaster ana Treasurer E.
N. Walter. Carl A. Tarnberg has sold
the sloop Mist and bought the schooner
Meliva, a keel boat of about twelve feet
beam, and has named her The North
Star. Prather of the launch El Casador
recently enjoyed a successful hunting trip
at Point Reyes. L. S. Sherman's sloop
Royal cruised to El Campo on Sunday.
On Thursday night at me California
Yacht Club house Admiral E. A. yon
Schmidt gave up the Wallace trophy,
which was won In 18% and 1897 by his

DEATH OP A WELL
KNOWN CRICKETER
In the match at Alameda last Sunday.
Banks and Insurance vs. All Comers, the
All (.'nmcrs, going to the bat, were all out
for 2S, the smallest score of the season,
Sewell taking six wickets for 22 runs, and
Driffleld 3 wickets for 6 runs. The Banks
and Insurance men scored 87, of which J.
J. Morlarlty made 29. and C. B. Hill 21.
B. Bird bowled most successfully, taking
6 wickets for 15 runs. In their second
Inning the All Comers did much better
than in their first, scoring 110 runs for 8
wickets, of which B. Bird made 34 not out
and R. B. Hogue 29. The match, however,
being a one-day event, was decided on
the first Inning, and consequently was a
victory for the Banks and Insurance men,
with 68 runs to spare.
A. E. Coates, a vice president of the
California Cricket Association, who died
on July 19 at Los Angeles of cardiac
asthma, was one of the most widely
known cricketers in this State. lie was
born August 4, 184N, In .Lancashire, Eng
land, and was consequently almost fifty
years old when he died. The eldest son
of the Rev. Arthur Coates of Newtown
House, County Month, Ireland, p.nd of
Clifton, England, he was 1 educated at
Shrewsbury school, and at St. John's Col
lege, Cambridge. He came to California
six years ago. and was for four years
secretary of the Citrus Colony Club at
Loomis, Placer County, and, until his
health failed in UN, was captain of the
Placer County eleven. The funeral ser
vices took place at St. Paul's Church, Los
Angeles. He will be deeply regretted by
all cricketers, and especially by the mem
bers of the CntniP Coir-v, to a*ll of whom
he had endeared himself.

Billy Burg, the crackajacks of the club
were figuring for week* before the season
opened how they would surprise their
friends on the eveolng of the first day of
the cannonade with large and tender ven
ison steaks.
"I think it was on the 12th or 13th of
the month. I'm not positive now wfilch j
day, but at any rate the keeper, Ben j
Johnson, sent word to Bergez that while
out herding cattle he ran across a spiked '
buck and lassoed the beauty as it leaped !
from the brush into the open, and held it
captive waiting instructions from the
club.
"Bergez . immediately called a conven
tion of the rough riders and at a meeting j
it was decided that the deer should be led
to some isolated point in the demesne and I
shot at from a distance of 300 yards by i
the party in question.
"On the morning of the 15th inst. the
sharpshooters of the club opened lire on
the highly prized game, which was tied
with a rope to a tree In full view of the
marksmen. The boys tossed a coin for ;
positions. Bergez had first shot and after
taking down the rifle a dozen times from
his shoulder he finally managed to steady
his nerves by great effort, but his aim j
was poor, the bullet taking quite a slice
of bark from the tree a foot over where
the deer stood wondering what all this
fuss meant.
"Billy Brown won second place, but he
was too confident and undershot the
game, the leaden missile from a Kray-
Jorgensen rifle raising a cloud of dust un- i
der the spiked buck, that now realized '
the danger of its position. It is hardly ;
necessary to say that Brown was wild.
He had wagered a wine supper with his i
friends that the bullet would enter under
the shoulder blade and cause instant l
death.
i " '}Â£?, *5y5 y turn now - Eald Burg, smiling- â 
ly; 111 do him sure,' and La Coste in- i
wardly prayed that the second Billy
would shoot wide of the mark also.
u Th sharp crack of the Winchester
echoed through the canyons and the little
deer never budged an inch. The bullet
went wide of Its mark and whistled over I
the head of Otto Snoozer, who was en- j
joying an early morning breakfast on a '
mountain peak a mile from where the
crack marksmen stood.
J ' l C st ? was the ast man to the trap.
He handled a Mauser riflÂ« which he said
was presented to him by the King of I
Spain two years ago.
"Carefully the butt was placed firmly ;
against the right shoulder and a deliber- !
ate aim taken at the deer, which was
standing broadside to the marksman. :
But La Coste's hand trembled and the
weapon came down from -its perch. A
glass of wine relieved the man's excite
ment of the moment, and again Frank ;
drew a bead, but large drops of coal '
perspiration fell from the hunter's fore
head on the rifle's barrel and once again
the weapon came down.
"'Give me that bottle. I can't stand
this strain any longer,' barked the
sharpshooter, as he raised the glass to
his mouth and finished the contents. '
" 'Now, I'll wind up thjs job In style.' I
muttered the last of the Mohicans as the \
rifle was raised gingerly and a cold, dead
ly aim taken at the first deer of the sea
son. Crack! The buck leaped high in the j
air and shot like a bullet downhill and
into the canyon unscathed by the enemy. I
La Coste drew too much in advance of |
his game, and the bullet from the Mauser j
cut the rope that held tho yearling ,a !
captive."
Denis Donohoe Jr. and friends are up

a tyro at rifle shooting can bowl over a

turned from a five weeks' deer hunt on
Leech Lake Mountain, north of Round I
Valley. The sportsmen enjoyed a very |
pleasant outing and report having had i
excellent shooting and fishing. During !
their stay in the mountains they bagged j
twelve bucks and basketed numbers of '
trout.
To-morrow the Marysville Gun Club
will en.lov its annual oufing and dove

saying 1 that a srlorious time will be en
joyed by the invited gupsts, among whom
from this city will be Otto Feudner. who
expects to uphold his reputation for ani
mate and inanimate Wrd shootlnc.
Last Saturday Joe # N^alon killed a nice
buck near Novato. 'making his third for
the season. Joe. who Is fond of the sport,
if an excellent shot, and will soon make
as good a marksman as nfs father. The
latter will he Sf>en on Sunday evening
homeward bound with a good-sized spike
buck swung to his shower. The ex-
Assessor knows exactly the spot where
the buck Is in hiding. and it Â»<* handballs
to peanuts that one deer will be culled
from the "pnlked" family of the Novato
ridges next Sunday.
Sportsmen who are camped in the

LOCAL 'KENNEL MEN
ARE STILL AT WAR
Of course the local kpnnol faacy Is
much wrought up over the meeting held
nt the Occidental Hotel on Wedneseday
last, and its somewhat unexpected con
clusion. The chief topic of discussion is
the strength developed by H. T. Payne,
who practically dominated the meeting
with his proxies. Payne's hobby Is se
c<>Â«sion. and he started in to ride ener
getically, but his wild career was brought
to a Fudden close by a point of order
raised by H. H. Carlton and sustained by
the chairman, Dr. d'Evelyn.
The members of the San Francisco Ken
nel Club, -which was the body initiating
the convention, are much disgruntled at
the result. An lntoryiew with the secre
tary discloses the fact that the report of
the vote to be sent to the American Ker
nel Club will be accompanied by a mi
nority report, now in course of drafting.
There is no earthly prospect of inducing
the A. K. C. to revert to the old rules,
but there is a possibility that the minor
ity report, signed as it will be by the rep
resentatives of the best element in Pacific
Coast dogdom, will induce the A. K. C.
to modify the present rules so as to give
our country shows a chance for life. Of
course Payne is extremely jubilant over
his success, but oven those among his op
ponents who share hln views and sympa
thize with his desire for an Independent
Pjicifi" Coast League, claim that his re
cent action can but tend to defer their
realization incleiinitely.

RECORD-BREAKING
HARNESS RACES
CLEVELAND. July 29.â Record break
ing marked the close of the grand circuit
meeting, as record clipping had signalised
the opening. This afternoon the world's
record to wagon was broken twice, lir>t
by Kentuck) Union, who went under '.he
mark established by the Village Farm
stallion The Abbott a second and a half,
and by Grace Hastings, who lowered tho
mark to 2:09V2. half a second below even
the unrecognized clip of Elloree.
In the first race, the 2:10 trot. continue!
over from the day before, The Abbott,
with (Jeers in the sulky, traveled the
fastest heat trotted this year, the fastest
trotted on the Glenvllle track in two sea
sons, cut the world's record for five-year
old geldings from 2:09% to 2:08$. and went
three heats that formed the fastest race
trotted this season, robbing Matt Patter
son of the recently gained glory.
The 11,000 people who' packed the stand
not only witnessed a breaking ofturf rec
ords, but they saw four of the preai >Bt
races ever bunched together on a gwvl
circuit course. Smashing four records in
a race won by straight heats was a won
derful achievement, yet that was what
The Abbott did in the 2:10 trot. Pilot Boy
was the only real competitor of The Ab
bott. Three times he had what appeared
to be a "cinch" on the heat, but The A.l -
bott always managed to push his nose un
der the wire first.
Annie Lee and John Nolan won the 2:19
pace and 2:14 trot with comparative ease.
There were seven starters ' in the 3:06
pace, and Bumps and A.naconda were
placed to win. but Anaconda took the race
after losing the third and fourth heats to
Frank Bogash. Anaconda was beaten
only a head in the third, and In the fourth
heat he was pocketed on the last turn.
The trial miles by Kentucky Union and
Grace Hastings to beat the wagon record
made by The Abbott were fine exhibitions-

THE SAX ERAXCISCO CALL, SATUEDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
SHE WON'T BE
INTERVIEWED
Dr. Emma Merritt Ably
Guarded.
ELABORATE RED TAPE SYSTEM
SITTRO'S GUARDIAN HAS A SE
CRET BELL SERVICE.
A Descriptive Blank and a Time
Card Torwarded to the Doctor
With Each "Would-Be
Visitor's Name.
Dr. Emma Merritt won't be inter
viewed.
She has nothing tÂ«o say for publication.
In regard t<> the now famous case con
ng the custody of her distinguished
father, ex-Mayor Butro, Mrs. Merritt has
no Btatement to make. In fact the lady
d >es M' ; Bee how her views in this matter
can in- of public interest.
Personally Hutro's guardian does not
say all this. Her trusted attendants say
it for her. These Bame henchmen care
fully guard the doctress from the prying
eyes of the curious, do her fetching and
carrying, convey her decisions to those
who await her word and attend to the
elaborate system by which appointments
are made by humble petitioners.
At a glance tHe uninitiated visitor
makes sure that the office of attendant
to Dr. Emma Butro Merritt is no sine
cure. The successful clerk must possess
an Insolent â¢â¢.-is.', a power of lightning ob
servation, a descriptive pen, an eye that
sizes up to the sixteenth part <>f a second
the indications of the office clock, and an
ear that can discern and discriminate the
various tans of an intricate bell system.
Four men are employed to do this work,
and to each man is allotted a separate
duty. One man receives the visitor and
Inquires the nature of his business. An
other keeps tally of the interview time
card and states to the nicety of a minute
when one's â¢â¢nun" will come. To the
third man falls the important mission of
carrying the card. The card man's busi
ness'is intricate. Below the name i.i neat
Spencerian hand he atates the nature of
tiic visitor's errand, affixing his signature
to the same, with date, day and exact
time. Then at a certain tinkle of a bell
manipulated by an attendant in an inner
room, man No. 4 conveys the descriptive
card to the doctor. Finally an attendant
who supposedly basks in the smiles of
the learned lady comes forth from the
brightness within, his eyes contracting
and blinking in the dingy waiting room
light, and says, "Mrs. Merritt will not be
interviewed."
This wai> a poor scribe's experience.
SEIZED THOUSANDS
OF LOTTERY TICKETS
GOVERNMENT OFFICERS DO THE
WORK OF NEGLIGENT LEES.
The Goods Were Shipped by Wells-
Fargo & Co. and Seized by the
Marshal.
That lottery tickets are sold openly and
unreservedly in this city has been for
some time a notorious fact, despite the
laws and ordinances against them. They
are sold in the saloon, the house, the of
fice, on the street corner and even In U;<>
public building under the. very nose nt
the senile Chief of Police, who, were he
disposed to make a venture in this line
himself, might purchase unlimited quan
tities of "winning" numbers.
The Chief, however, has apparently
made no efforts to stop the illicit traffic
which has become so notorious that com
plaints regarding it have at last reached
Washington and the Government has fin
ally decided to take a hand in the mat
ter. Unlike the Police Department, what
the Government does, it does well, and it
will stop the sale of tickets by seizing
them as soon as they arrive In this city.
Majors Moore and Vernon, special
agents of the Treasury in this district,
were officially notified of the traffic, and
at once set to work to stop it. They did
not follow the example of tho Illustrious
Lees and arrest some one who had once
seen a ticket or have the street sweep
ings sifted over in the hope of securing
"evidence" that tickets really were sold;
in fact it is stated on the best authority
that they did not even go to the City
Hall and ask for advice as to how to pro
ceed. Yet they did their work.
Thursday afternoon United States Mar
shal Shine was furnished with a
search warrant. It was^/placed in the
hands of Deputy Marshal'- Monckton, who
served it on Wells, Fargo & Co., and
upon its authority seized several thousand
tickets of the New Louisiana Lottery
Company which had been shipped from
New Orleans to W. W. Ogden & Co. of
this city. The tickets were in various
denominations, running down from $5 to
23 cents. Of course the firm name of
Ogden was only a' blind, but whoever the
party or parties the tickets were con
signed to evidently expected little diffi
culty in disposing of the tickets, as they
were for a drawing to take place on Au
gust 14, and to sell thousands of tickets
In a few days would require a small army
of agents. Where are the minions of the
illustrious Isaiah W. Lees when the town
is overrun with these agents, or rather,
what are their instructions in the prem
ises? .
Hut the officials of the Government,
when doing the work of Lees, seem total
ly regardless of his methods of procedure
from start to finish. In the eyes of one
who .is familiar with the way things are
done in the upper office at the City Hall
it seems remarkable that the advice of
Its superannuated head was not asked but
after the capture was made what, to
Lees, is the most important part of the
affair, was wholly neglected. When Ma
jor Moore was asked about the matter
he did not puff out, don a supercilious
and condescending, smile, spit all over the
walls, and tell all about how "I" did it.
He seemed, on the contrary, to have a
general aversion to discussing the mat
ter, and simply said that he had acted
upon Instructions, gathered evidence, had
the tickets seized and that was all about
Different people do the same things In
widely different \ ways..

WHY CAGLIERI
WILL NOT ROW.
VICTOR CAGLIKRI will not win the Treadwell medal to
morrow at the Dolphin reception. When Victor announced that he
would compete there was a general assembling of excuses from the
other members, for It was conceded that If Caglierl wanted the
medal he could get it.
But In addition to being an expert oarsman Caglleri Is something
of a scientist, and like all scientists he experiments. Being much inter
ested In the recent operations performed upon human beings whereby
certain Individuals, minus stomachs, lived, moved and had their beans with
a seeming unconsciousness of the absence *f important viscera, Caglieri
concluded to investigate the question of Rtomachless dogs, and with that
end in view took to his home and fireside a vagabond cur. For a few
weeks the dog Invert as he had never lived before, and yesterday Caglieri
BUtds preparations to separate the dog from his stomach.
All was ready; knives, chloroform, lint and bandages were laid out
ready for the act of vivisection, and It looked as if science would learn
something, but Just as the operator was ready the dog forgot all that
had been done for him and turned on his benefactor, and in the subse
quent entanglement Caglieri came near losing a thumb.
The dog still retains hiÃ stomach andy'Caglleri will not row for the
Treadwell medal to-morrow.
HELPING THE
BOYS IN BLUE
Good Work of the Cath
olic Truth Society.
SUPPLYING HOME COMFORTS
AN ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE
BENEFIT FUND.
Food, Medicine, Nursing and Neces
sary Assistance Afforded
Unfortunates at the
Camps.
A very pleasing and successful musical,
literary and social entertainment was
given last evening at Turner Hall, on
Eighteenth street, for the benefit of the
soldiers' fund of the Catholic Truth So
ciety. The sale of tickets was large and
the result will be a substantial addition
to the working capital of this deserving
organization.
The programme was well selected, be
ing largely devoted to patriotic songs and
instrumental numbers, which were greet
ed with generous applause. Among the
selections were a well executed war song
by Miss Ella Donlon; a tenor solo, "Just
Before the Battle," by Robert Saxe,
which was heartily encored; songs by a
glee club from Camp Merrltt; a recita
tion by Harry Stafford; a very pleasantly
rendered patriotic song by auss Tlllie Ma
honey; fancy dancing by Annie and Mabel
Miihoney; a woll executed piano solo by
Miss Quajada; artistic dancing by Margie
McGlvary and Annie McNeil and a
soprano solo by Miss Adelaide Haubold,
with guitar accompaniment.
Following the musical and other exer
clseÃ there was a social dance, in which
n.-arly the entire audience took part,
making it a very enjoyable occasion. The
benefit entertainment was given under
' the direction and through the efforts of
the Mlssea Klla and Eva McCloskey. as-
Blsted by Mr. Cannahan as master of
ceremonies. Frank Kessler floor manager
and Frank Peters, Robert Saxe and
Thomas McConnell assistants, 'lue pro
moters of the affair have reason to be
proud of the results of their efforts not
only In an artistic but a financial Bense,
and they feel encouraged to continue in
this commendable line of charity work.
The organization for which the enter
tainment was given is laboring with high
ly gratifying success in providing neces
sities and comforts for the soldiers at
Camp" Morrltt and the Presidio. The work
is being conducted in a business-like man
ner and the society has the satisfaction of
knowing that it has the praise and grati
tude of every soldier who has been so ror
tuinite as to" have his wants ministered to
by these ladles.
These Christian workers make no dis
tinction as to religion, their only aim bo
ing to lessen the hardships of the boys in
blue, and they are succeeding handsomely.
At both the camps they have large tents,
from which the sick soldiers are furnished
with medlclneÃ and delicacies in the shape
of gv'od, wholesome soups and broths,
toast, etc., made as "mother used to make
It." and served hot; substantial food for
the hungry from the commissary and
from the sanitary department, chest pro
tectors, abdominal bandages, along with
which go comfort bags, the mending of
old clothes, the alteration of misfit suits
and general attention and assistance, such
as the boys have missed Bince leaving
their homes.
Another feature or the good work of the
Catholic Truth Society is the furnishing
of postage stamps to all who have letters
to mail. As a result of this from 200-3 lo
8000 letters are posted every day. This
charity will be conducted so long as it is
necessary and Its promoters suggest that
they should be given all possible assist
ance in their efforts in the matter of con
tributions.

After the opening ceremonies Junior
Past Grand President Mary I. Wynne of
Vullejo delivered an Interesting address
on the order and the work it has done
In the past two years.
The greater part of the forenoon and
of the afternoon session was given to fur
ther discussion, each section being taken
up and passed upon. There were a few
slight changes, but the only one that the
press committee declared was of general
public Interest was the effort to change
the amount of the death benefit. That
was allowed to remain at the sum lixed
In the old constitution, namely, $150.
Rev. Father Cummings. at the after
noon session, delivered an address, as
did also Past Grand President Mrs. Dr.
Ragan, each dwelling upon the work that
the grand body has already done and
encouraging the ladies to continue in the

Each of the grand officers received a
bunch of beautiful flowers from some one
whose name was withheld.
In the evening the delegates to the
Grand Institute, under the tscort of Mrs.
Mac Stein, Mrs. J. Keating and Miss

ment, visited the Columbia Theater.

an address; Mrs. J. B. McClusky, who
sang a selection; Miss Mac Stein, who

A young lady in New York City relates the curious case of heVslStet
who suffered from a sort of nervous dyspepsia â that was what the doc*
tor called it. She was despondent ; low-spirited, inclined to imagine all 'â 
sorts of things. One thing especially seemed to be in her mind ; that
was the idea that abscesses were forming In different parts of her body. 1
The sister who tells the story had found Ripans Tabules> specific tot
headache, and generally had a supply on hand. One day, more ia
joke than in earnest; : she said to the afflicted one: "Try these t
... they'll cure you." Well, she did try them, and strangely enough thÂ»,
Tabules did :; cure her. The despondency left her. This was nearly
â¢â¢â â â¢â  a year ago. : She '; took less than a dollar** worth in aIL and has not
taken one for over eight months now. ': : ; ; \

EASTERN
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 29â The significant net
changes In most stocks are a fair Indication of
the r>glected condition of the days market.
The prospects of early peace With Spain, the
esFiirnnce of cheap money and the already se
cured cr> >ps are not sufficient to induce buy
ers to take stock?. Holders are equally averse
to selling at the existing level. Such a market
naturally invites aggi esaton by the better ele
ment, but the profesali nnl maneuver of sell-
Ing short some one st"rk or group of storks
Whtah Is particularly vulnerable has again and
agaii failed to make any notable Impression
en the general 11 Â«t which continues Inactive,
apparently waiting for business conditions to
change either for better or for worse. Dealers
In Ftrcks keep one eye perpetually on the grain
markets these days. The granger roads re-
fleeted to-day some feeling of relief over the
â  reported rain? in the corn belt, but on the other
band "the drift of price of wheat away from
â¢the dollar mark, which was the magic touch
â¢ BtOne In- all of last year's bull market. Is one

crops' are not yet sufficiently defined to lndl
. .c.ate- what the market for our surplus grains
â¢.'Trill amount to. The dullness of to-day's stock
market was varied only by the manipulative
movements of the industrial specialties, partic
ularly Rubber and Sugar.

â¢ In the day, but anticipations of gold engage
â¢â¢ ments for import were disappointed.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July 29.â Brartatreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will cay: The Spanish
application for terms of peace has been the
chief factor In the speculative situation this
week. It created a more confident tone and
greater activity has been shown, though It Is
a profound kind, the public being still out of
the market, while London has continued in
active. Large financial Interests seem, how
ever, to be much better satisfied with the
situation, not only as regards the peace out
look, but In relation to the crops and to rail
road rates. The conflicting crop accounts from
the West seem. In view of Wall street, not to
disturb the presumption that the grain yield
will be very large and afford a heavy export
able balance and ample tonnage for the rail
roads. Western railroads have also shown a
i disposition to restore rates and stop cutting.
j Borne action of this kind was certainly ren
! dered necessary by the unfavorable statements
Of Juno net warningÃ which are coming out in
tome instances. Another factor in the market
Is the ffeneral belief that considerable gold
will come from abroad this autumn. The ease
of money and the thirst for investments Is
! another circumstance, and it might be noted
I that the b"nd market has again been very
active and decidedly strong. The success of
the popular Government loan and the failure
of the operation to disturb the money market
haw produced a favorable impression, both at
home and abroad.
Large dealings In the new 3s have been re
corded deliverable when Issued, the price ris
ing to l(M@l944fc. At the same time other
classes of governments have risen sharply from
'vil't: per cent in the different issues. This
ll probably due to the fact that the new bond
Issue has caused no decided soiling of the older
ones.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 29.â generally distrib
uted rains and thunder storms last night
washed all semblance of bullishness out of corn
to-day. It appeared to be taken for granted
that corn, like the belated sinner, could be
saved at the last hour. There was plenty for
sale at the opening at lc under yesterday's .
close. There was some recovery, but the mar- I
ket did not show strength. Country accept
ances of cash bids were very large. September
closed 14c lower on the day at 3S%c bid.
Lower Liverpool cables and fine weather In
the northwest started wheat lower. The j
course of the price of corn was so decidedly
downward the first hour that wheat had a fur
ther decline In sympathy. There was a very
prevalent Idea that while receipts were run
ning light there was a great abundance of
wheat In the country and the trade acted as
If the world could be fed on Ideas. Business
as a rule was quiet and narrow. While weak
ness was the chief feature there was no es
pecial slump and the decline was slow and
gradual. The close was "<o lower In July,
F%c in September and lU<gl%c in December.
Oats sympathized somewhat with corn, al
though there was enough cash demand to
keep them relatively .steady. September left
off %O%C down.
Small receipts and better prices at the yards
started provisions firm. The weakness In corn
depressed prices for a time, but the market
finally rallied near the close on heavy buying
by packers. Lard showed an advance at the
close of 10c; pork 2%c and ribs sc.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW TORK, July 29.â R. O. Dun ft Ca's
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Big business In January Is expected, but big
bustnees In July means more. It Is the month
of all others when trade Is naturally light.
I New engagements are ordinarily deferred and
men wait for the outcome and movement of
crops. But more business Is being done this
year than In any previous July of which there
are records. The payments through clearing
houses have been 6.8 per cent larger than In
1392. the year of greatest prosperity heretofore,
and for the month thus far 6.6 per cent larcer
than last year and 8.4 per cent larger than Jn
1592. Hut these records and the others have to
be Judged in the light of heavy declines in
prices since Ife92. so that the volume of business
transacted is about 20 per cent larger than the
volume of payment indicates.
Considering that the purchases of nearly half
the people depend on the success of agriculture
and that the prosperity of the entire trans
porting Interest Is materially affected by the
â Ixu of the crops to be moved, If may be said
that Is the reason that the promise of general
prosperity this year is unusually bright.
The official report of iron production for the
first half of 1898 shows an increase of over half
a million tons compared with any previous
year and what is far more important the con
sumption in manufactures appears for the half
to have exceeded the output. Estimating the
exports for June, only five months having been
officially reported, the consumption has been
6,948.345 tons, arainÃt 6,809,701 produced, aver
aging Â»9i.3tl tons monthly against 984,960 tona
produced. It Is well to remember that In June,
when produotlon declined because of stoppage
for repairs, the decrease In unsold stocks was
4216 tons weekly. The new orders received are
surprisingly large for the season, covering 6000
tons at New York for rails and 10.000 taken at
Chicago, and a noteworthy demand for struc
tural forms at Philadelphia and Increasing de
mand for bare, with enough to keep the plate
mills busy for a long time; a larger demand
for bars at Chicago, including one order for 6000
tons Implement Btuff, and an excellent struc
tural demand and the heaviest demand for
plates ever known at Plttsburg. Bales of Bes
semer Iron have been heavy, reaching 25,000
tons at Plttsburg, without change In prices.
Wheat receipts for the month thus far have
been 7.309,333 bushels, against 10,652,044 last
year, but prices have declined 11H cents and
farmers are holding back their wheat in the
hope of higher prices. The exports for the
week have been 1.307 815 bushels from Atlantic
ports, flour Included, against 1.715.739 last year
ami from raciflc ports 126,117 bushels against
420.3?! last year, making for the month 8,833.193
bushel 6 against 7,342.467 lust year.
Tho sales of wool show a remarkable In
crease In large transactions for which no
prices are named, four being quoted at Boston
covering 2,600.000 pounds, and the aggregate at
the three chief markets has been 7.039.300
pounds for the week and for four weeks 19,919,
200, of which 12.C11.400 were domestic.
Failures for the week have been 225 In the
United States, against 236 last year, and 26 in
Canada against 28 last year.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. July 29.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: While as yet showing little
actual effect upon distributive trade, there Is
evidence that the Improved prospects for peace,
with probably wider markets for American
products, have given a more hopeful tinge to
the trade outlook, more particularly with the
East. This Is reflected In active preparations
by shippers and coasting trade Interests to
share In the expected widening of demand from
the West Indies. As for some time past, how
ever, reports of solid business returns come
mainly from the Western part of the country,
and In the markets of that section are re
ported signs of the ground swell of fall de
mand. Signs of cumulative Improvement come
from the Iron and steel Industry more par
ticularly from west of the Alleghenles, where
slight advances In prices accompanying a good
volume of domestic and export business are
reported. Expected activity In chlpbuildlng Is
reflected In the demand for plates at Eastern
points. A rather better tone Is found In the
anthracite coal trade, In which as a result of
another one of thoÃe numerous '"gentlemen's
agreements" prices have been advanced at the
West from previously low cut rates. The situa
tion In cereals Is hardly as satisfactory as
could be wished, cash prices being lower for
the week In the face of probably record-break
ing small world's supplies on August 1, and
good exports from this country, while futures
are leÃs depressed, but exhibit the pressure of
expected liberal supplies at hoirfff and heavier
crops abroad.
The sugar markets remain dull and stocks
of refined In the channels of distribution are
reported small. Raw sugar, however, remains
featureless, perhaps awaiting a closer approxi
mation as to the effects of recent or Imminent
changes In territorial authority on the sugar
trade of the world.
Cereal expwts 6tlll continue of a satisfactory
volume. Wheat shipments for the week (flour
Included) aggregate 2,271.872 bushels, as against.
2.303.46S bushels last week, and compared with
2,343.021 bushels In the corresponding week of
last year. 2.648.7G8 bushels In thin week of IS9B,
1.460.M7 bushels In 1895 and 2,977,967 bushels In
1894.
Business failure* In the United States remain
at a normal low point, aggregating for the
week 189, against ISS last week, and compared
with 259 In -this week a year ago, 234 In 1596,
221 In 1895 and 221 In" 1894.
j Business failures In Canada for the week
number 34, against 17 last week. 32 a year ago,
37 In 1898. 29 In 1890 and 31 In 1894. Â»

Jacob Wollner's circular says: "Although
there were no very large sales made- In this
market, inquiry still continues for good choice
wools. Scoured wools still do not seem to he
In demand, and as three fourths of the wools
In this market can only be classed as scour
ing wools, 1. c., wools that are heavy, some
what defective, and also mountain fall wools
which cannot be shipped In the grease, we will
have to wait until scourers get orders : anil
scoured wools are In demand. The reports
from the East for the last week as regards
the wool riarket say: 'There Is rather a bet
ter demand for wool noted and the sales this
week foot up the largest for any week during
many months past. The total business exceeds
3,000,000 pounds.' â¢';.>,
"As the light weight season progresses, man
ufacturers show an Increased disposition to
combat the comparatively high prices at which
the raw material Is held. The position of the
goods market and the prices at which manu
facturers are forced to sell new goods Is un
doubtedly hindering a further advance In
wool. Outside of the goods situation, the
factors governing the wool market are all fa
vorable. Neither new clips, domestic nor for
eign wools can be bought at prices that per
mit of their being turned over at a profit upon
the present basis of prices In seaboard mar
kets. As regards the goods market, conditions
are more or less unsatisfactory, but as the
season progresses, features detrimental to a
good output are gradually disappearing."

this Is Inevitable, as the brisk demand f. ir

PARTIES ARE
ARRAYED FOR
THE CONFLICT
Politics in Alameda County Rap
idly Arriving at Boiling
Point.
Stories of the 'Turning Down" of One
Pardee by the County Committee.
The Present Outlook.
.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 29.
With one or more avowed candidates
from one of the three political parties for
almost every place on the State ticket
and others awaiting a favorable oportun
lty to offer themselves up on the political
altar, in addition to the Congressional,
.Legislative and county lights opening up,
more politics are being "done" in Ala
meda County just now than in all the oth
ers combined. Broadway is studded with
headquarters, proprietors of cornjuice
emporiums note with keen satisfaction
that the- fall trade has already begun,
â with every promise of being unusually
heavy, while the ward clubs are tilling up"
their torches and furbishing tinsel and
cotton uniforms. In all the smaller towns
and hamlets the evening gatherings at
the postottlee are Increasing and the war
Situation has been dropped as the main
subject of debate, the approaching elec
tion being substituted, to the evident sat
isfaction of all the participants.
With the meetings of the Republican
and Populist county committees yester
day the campaign was practically opened,
and from now until November S the voice
of the politician will ring throughout this
section of the State, to the exclusion of
less â trident and more melodious sounds. I
Naturally the main feature of the tv- !
mult Just now is the scramble between
Davis . and Pardee for the Republican
Gubernatorial nomination. Davis' friends
are conducting a quiet but effective cam
paign," while Pardee has resorted to the
â¢ brass band-hurrah method, which Is gen
eraliy regarded as an indication of wan
ing strength.
The turning down <*t Pardee by the
County Committee yesterday by refusing
to allow him to dictate as to the number
of. primary election officers to serve, and
again In preventing his friend Breed from
controlling the district recently annexed
during the primary has caused wide
spread surprise and no little chagrin to
the doctor, who was so deeply interested
in the matter that he cast dignity to the
â winds and attended the meeting in per
son, sitting alongside Breed and actively
conducting his end of the contests. The
action of the committee is all the more
surprising because heretofore it had been
supposed that a majority of the members
were decidedly friendly to Pardee.
And right here it Is proper to call atten
tion to the fact that T. M. Robinson, the
member from the Fifth Ward, did not re
sign from the committee, nor was his con
templated resignation referred to in any
manner although it was thought certain
he would step down and out because of
his open candidacy for Tax Collector. At
th*> last county Republican convention a '
resolution .was; adopted expressly prohib- '
iting any candidate for office serving on :
the County Committee. Notwithstanding
this, Mr. Robinson has His card In all
tne local papers announcing himself a
candidate for Tax Collector, subject to !
the action of the next County Convention.
The failure of Mr. Robinson to meSt ex
pectations and withdraw from the com- 1
mittee can Only be' accounted for by the
Pardee men suddenly rinding themselves
In the minority, where they had all along
figured on holding a good working ma- !
jority. The committee is composed of
thirteen members, Robinson being classed
as one of Pardee's supporters. Prior to
yesterday's meeting the most of the Par
dee men would concede was six votes to
their opponents. - "With Robinson off the
committee this would leave a tie vote I
ami no possible chance of electing his I
successor. But yesterday's proceedings
demonstrated that Pardee's friends were
not a? numerous in the committee as had j
been counted on and so Robinson re- I
tamed his seat.
Robinson is understood to justify his
MOFFETTS LIFE IS
IN THE BALANCE
THE WIFE SLAYER'S TRIAL IS
NEARING AN END.
Arguments Are Advanced For and
â¢ Against the Theory of
Insanity.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
KM Broadway, July 29. '
The trial of Joseph 11. Moffett, wife
murderer, was closed in Judge Hall's
court to-day and the case will be argued
next Tuesday. The arguments are to be
limited to two and a half hours on each
side.
The defendant did not take the Btand
In his own defense, as was expected, and
his attitude has all along been cold and
indifferent until this morning, when he
broke down completely. His eyes were
,naed with tears and his head was bowed
on the table. This change of attitude was
caused by the testimony of Witness F. \V.
Leutz, who described how affectionately
Moffett used to treat his wife and two
little girls who lived at his home.

Last night's split in the Populist party '

MRS. MARTIN
IS ARRESTED
Will Test the Ordinance
Governing Health.
WRATHY AT MR. DINGEE
READS AND INTERPRETS LAW
TO JUDGE ALLEN.
She Is Charged With Having the
Water Turned Off at the
House of Her
Tenants.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 29.
Mrs. Isabella Martin waa arrested in
this city this afternoon for an alleged
breach of a health ordinance. The arrest
was made at the Instance of the Health
Board on the ground that Mrs. Martin
had willfully risked the health of her
tenants by turning off the water without
giving notice.
The lady was taken before Judge Allen
and as she had not $20 to deposit as bail
he allowed her to depart on her promise
that she would be in court next Monday
morning. Mrs. Martin is confident that
at that time she will be released, as she
will plead her own case, as usual.
"I have fallen a victim to the greed of
the combined water companies of the
city," said Mrs. Martin after her release
from the City Prison. "Some months ago,
when 1 was a patron for my live cottages
in Oakland of the Contra Costa company,
an agent of Mr. Dingee came along and
with much argument induced me to
change to his company at 50 cents a
month for each cottage. I consented, and
before a couple of months had passed by
1 was presented with a bill for $2 50 for
each cottage and I refused to pay any
such price. I made several attempts to
s.-c Mr. Dingee, but was never success
ful, and so 1 paid something on account
and left the balance to be settled when I
could meet the president of the company.
"This afternoon 1 come over here from
my Van Xess avenue residence, and while
in Mr. Dingee's office 1 was served with a
warrant tor a misdemeanor and taken to
the City Hall, i then learned that my
crime had consisted in the water having
been turned off at my Rouses. Health
Inspector Perkins told me that I could
not get rid of my tenants in that way,
and that I must stand trfal for my con
duct. I find that Mr. Dingee ordered the
water cut wff and he is tho responsible
party. 1 showed the ordinance to tfie
Judge and read to him that it says 'any
one who turns off the water of an in
habited house is guilty of a misdemeanor
and should be punished by a line of $100
or else be put 100 days in the City Pris
on. 1 suppose they want to make me
serve a hundred days. The ordinance is
very dear, and I told Health Inspector
Perkins that the warrant should have
been served on Mr. Dingee. I shall ap
pear in cnurt noxt Monday morning and
I shall adjust this wrong in short order."
The oaee is one of more than ordinary
Interest, as it involves the right of a
water company to turn off the water
from an inhabited house.
THE WATER METERS
GO STEADILY ON
Auditor Snow Suspicious of a Big
Leak. .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 2b.
The close of the first month of the fis
cal year under the new ordinance fixing
water rates will show some remarkable
changes from the old order of things, es
pecially in the cost of water used at the
City Hall and its park.
The monthly bill of $135 60 for water
used on the little park, and which came
in for considerable discussion at the
meeting Of the Board of Public Works,
h:.s caused much surprise. Formerly the
city paid but $1& Zo per month for hall and
park, but since competition between the
Contra Costa and Oakland water com
panies has subsided two meters have been
put in and under the ordinance a rate of
20 cents per 1000 gallons is charged. The
final result of the investigation of the bill
has not yet transpired, but several offi
cials were yesterday afternoon listening
to the click of the meter hi front of the
Health Board's rooms.
"It was found," said Auditor Snow,
"that the meter seemed overworked, but
It was still on deck and doing business.
If all the streets used as much water as
â¢d on the City Hall park, according
to the meter, over 19,500,000 gallons would
be used per month and things would be
afloat. I have taken a snap judgment on
the Police Department, going through the
prison carefully, and I find all plumbing
modern and all flushing done by the tank
system. They are not using more water
iii the prison than an ordinary family,
and 1 should be unable to account for the
enormous use of water unless it be run-
ning into some sewer.
"At any rate there is no question but
the people should own their water plant.
It all shows again the necessity of a
municipal water supply from the moun
tains pure and unrestricted."
The grass plat at the City Hall park
does not cover more than 1000 square
yards and the rate charged prior to com
petition was 5 mills per yard, but since
the meters have been in vogue the hills
have been: April, $112 55; May, $9C 45;
June $135 60. Of these amounts *10 85 was
segregated as a fair charge for the City
Hall proper. The June bill represents
that 678,000 gallons of water were usod,
but this is regarded as absurd by all City
Hall officials.
Mayor Thomas has figured the matter
out in a novel way. In round figures 720,
000 gallons having been used, it would
take forty-six sprinkling carts, 500. gallons
each per day, thirty-six days to cover the
S 'Yf is still proposed to uncover the pipes
leading to the City Hall wltrPa view of
discovering whether or not there is a
leak.
POUNCED ON A COLLECTOR.
As a Besult Seven Japanese Fruit
Pickers Are Landed in the
County Jail.
OAKLAND, July 29.â 1t does not take
very long for the diminutive Jap to catch
on "to tho American way of doing things.
Yi-sit-rday afternoon K. Nakuno, a Japa
nfse from San Francisco, called at Meek's
ranch and orchard, between San Lorenzo
and Haywards with a view of collecting
a small bill from one of the Japanese
frult-plckers there. He spotted his man
and demanded payment. Being refused
he slapped the debtor's face, whereupon
six other Japanese fruit-pickers pounced
upon the collector and mauled ""him un
mercifully. Nakuno hastened before
Justice Pimentel and swore out a war
rant charging them with battery. As a
result Kunada, Shlmada, Nakamura
Bros, SentanL Yonoda and Yano are to

CANNOT CONTEST A
DEAD OFFICER'S BILLS
Supervisors to Pay Bills of Consta-
ble Koch.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 29.
Attorney C. E. Kinard was squelched
this morning by the Supervisors. For
several weeks Kinard has been going be
tween the Supervisors and the Grand
Jury with numerous complaints regarding
the charges made against the county by
Constables Koch and Cronin. Kinard
has alleged that these charges were ex
tortionate and illegal, and has tried to
have indictments issue as well as prevent
Borne payment by the Supervisors. , ,
The constables retaliated by finding evi
dence against Kinard and alleging thai
his testimony would be of no value.
This morning the matter canie before
tho Finance- Committee of the Suptr
viaors, but since the charges. were first
filed with them Constable Koch has been
killed by the Melrose explosion. Kinard
appeared as his own attorney and cited
law to the Supervisors, which ex-Judge
Nusbaumer, attorney for Cronin. stated
wad annulled by statute in 1883. Ex-
Judge Nusbaumer spoke very forcefully
against the accusatious and comments of
Kinard.
"It is an ill-advised time to file objec
tions to these bills." said the Judge.
"Kinard has absolutely nothing to sup
port his accusations. These bills were
legal ones. Koch has since laid down his
life in answer to the call of duty, and no
man could' make a more costly sacrifice.
Two men have lost their lives within the
past year in this township in obeying ihe
demands of their office, and yet hero
comes Kinard and objects to honest bills
for their services.
The Finance Committee voted to sus
tain the bills, which will be paid.

UNDIVIDED PROFITS
MUST BE ASSESSED
The Internal Revenue Commissioner
Makes a Ruling That Does Not
Suit the Bankers.
NEW YORK, July 29.-A Washington
special to the Herald says: Much con
fusion haa arisen over the interpretation
of that provision of war revenue law im
posing a special tax on banks and bank
ers. The law imposes a tax of $2 on each
$1000 of capital stock, and provides that
in estimating the capital the surplus
Bhall be included.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
with the approval of Secretary Gage,
himself a banker, holds that "undivided
profits" must be included in estimating
the "surplus." This Is contrary to the
opinion of other officials in the Treasury
Department, and it is understood that it
Is not being observed by all internal reve
nue collectors. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue Scott told me this afternoon
that he proposed to stand by his ruling,
and that if any collectors were not as
sessing undivided profits they would have
to d<* their work again when their re
turns came in.
Washington bankers will pay the tax
on undivided profits under protest and
will take the case to court to obtain a
Judicial interpretation of the law.
KILLED BY A BLOW
FROM A HORSE'S HOOF
Mrs. Matthew Fealy of Rutherford
Loses Her Life in a Shocking
Manner.
ST. HELENA, July 29.â An accident at
Union Station yesterday afternoon re
sulted in the almost instant death of Mrs.
Matthew Fealy of .Rutherford and the
serious injury of her daughter, Julia.
The two were returning from Napa, when
the horse they were driving got scared
at a passing train and wheeled into a
ditch at the side of the road. While
prancing and kicking about the animal
kicked Mrs. Fealy on the neck. The cart
was at the same time overturned and
both occupants thrown out. Miss Fealy
ran for assistance, but before her mother
could be removed to a neighboring house
she had expired, the kick from the horse
having broken a blood vessel.
Miss Fealy sustained severe injuries
from her fail, but is expected to recover.

MENACE TO
NAVIGATION
Large Derelict Drifting
Down the Coast.
GOVERNMENT VESSELS IDLE
SHIPPING MEN ANGRY BECAUSE
NOTHING IS BEING DONE.
A Number of Small River Steamers
Tied Up at St. Michael for
Want of Engineers and
Masters.
At the present time the following Unit
ed States vessels are lying idle in the har
bor: lroquols. Vigilant. Active. Rush and
Albatross. Underwriters and shipping
men are wondering why this is so when
a grave menace to navigation Is drifting
about right in the track of coasters. Last
March the bark Forest Queen sailed from
Tacoma for San Pedro and has never
since been heard- from. The supposition
is that she capsized in a gale after, leav
ing port and is floating around some
where, buoyed up by her load of lumber.
About three weeks ago a derelict that
somewhat resembled the missing bark
was sighted bottom up in latitude 43.19
north, longitude 129.55 west. There were
not as many idle government vessels in
the bay then and no notice was taken of
the report by anybody. . . â 
Wednesday last the schooner Louise at
Umpqua reported that in latitude 35.09
north, longitude 129.54 west (off Point
Reyes), the same derelict was sighted.
This fact was given publicity by the news
papers, but not a government vessel has
made a move toward removing this men
ace to navigation.
Charles Ledbetter has been appointed
to the State Harbor Police by Harbor I
Commissioner Herold, vice George Ecker,
resigned.
The advent of the United States In- |
spectors of Hulls and Boilers at St. Mi
chael has played havoc with the plans of ;
many private expeditions that left here i
and Puget Sound for the gold fields. â¢
These people took their own river steam
ers with them and it was their Intention !
to do their own navigating and engineer- |
ing. They now find to their sorrow that |
they must carry a licensed master and
engineer and Quite a number of them
are tied up In consequence. All of them
have to carry life preservers and in con- j
sequence those articles are at a premium â 
on the Yukon.
The little river steamer May "West came j
down from Dawson with 12a passengers.
She carried no life preservers, no lire j
hose and only one little skiff. Directly
she reached St. Michael the inspectors
tied her up, and when the Portland sailed j
on the 15th lnst. her captain was still I
trying in vain to get his vessel ready for j
Inspection.
The Portland brings the news that there (
was a great deal of smuggling going on
along tno river. Six custom nouse offi- ;
cers started up the r|vÂ«r on the 11th lnst.
on a still hunt after â whisky and smug
glers. . .
The Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers at ,
St. Michael are Captain Whitney and j
Charles Lenhers. Both gentlemen are ,
well known in San Francisco, Lenhers ;
having been for years chief engineer of
the big tug Fearless (now the gunboat
IroquoTs).
Captain Clem Randall, late of tho Fear
less, was at St. Michael when the Port- :
land left. He is master of the new tug
Ernest A. Hamill. which was built to low
barges from St. Michael to the mouth of I
the Yukon. â 
The following extracts from a private !
letter dated "St. Michael, July 13," will
be found of Interest:
A good many steamers are going tip the [
river, and they arc having lively weather.
Overcoats and furs are out of the question. i
Nearly alt the steamers, the National City,
Grace ,Dollar and Charles Nelson, for Instance, :
are here awaiting a chance to get their pas
senders up to Damon. Their agents contem- '
plate buildlDg a hotel here to accommodate
the passengers.
The Alaska Commercial Company's steamer
Leah started for Dawaon July 12. fihe h.i/i a
barge In tow and also the propeller steamer
Miriam. The latter Is going to purvey the
upper Yukon, and try and find a d<?*per chan- j
nel. This Is a good Idea aa reliable pilots (both â¢
â white and Indian) rep rt that thÂ«re Is not more
than two feet of water anywhere above Fort:
Yukon. The steamer B*-lle has also gone up i
the river with a number <>'. paenengers and
several missionary priests. â¢ â¢ â¢
The town of Bt. Michael Is overcrowded, and
the beach Is covered with tent* The news
from the Interior 1* very encouraging, and doz
ens of small steamers are being built in the
different coves to carry prospecting parties up
the river. There will be a great nodal â¢- San
Francisco this fall, however, as one winter on
the Yukon seems to be all anybody can stand.
â¢ â¢ . â¢ The value of the gold that has come
down the river to date (July 13) is about $7,000,
000. That Is the closest estimate that can be
made. Of this (am about 16,000,080 has been
handled by the Alaska Commercial Company. I
Koyukuk Creek is being very much prospected.
Gold Is In large quantities in the gravel, but
then It is from 10 to 20 feet to bedrock. There
are about 600 women here all waiting for a
chance to get to Dawson.
The steamers that have gone up the river,
and thoâ that are getting ready to go are:
Louise, Leah, Bella. Rock Island No. 1. Rock
Island No. 2. Bar. Cudahy Powers, Luida and
City of Soo St. Marie. Small craft awaiting j
engineers and masters or necessary alterations
are thÂ» El Sueno, Sunflower, Eclipse. Tanana
Chief, Mabel Laun and a ' number of others.
The river is said to be excellent for navigation.
The water has remained at four feet for the
last four days, and thÂ» prospects lor getting
over the Yukon flats are first rate.
Gulseppe Giorso was arrested by the
Harbor Police yesterday on a charge of
an assault to commit murder. The pris
oner has been In hiding since last Octo
ber, and would not have been arrested
yesterday had not one of his relatives
informed Captain Dunlevy that he was
back in town. Giorso and his son-in-law,
Gulseppi Uccelll. live at Ocean View, ana
have never been good neighbors. Last
October they quarreled and Giorso drew
a revolver and attempted to kill his son- i
in-law. The latter secured a warrant for
his arrest, but in the meantime Giorso
had fled Into the country. He returned
last Wednesday and at once began quar
reling with Uccelll's brother and threat
ened to kill him. The latter then informed
the police.
The American ship R. D. Rice sailed
for Nanalmo yesterday. There Is nothing
unusual In this save that E. L. Colnon,
president of the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners, sailed on her as an ordin
ary seaman. In spite of Hie fact that he
was rated as such on the- ships' articles.
Mr. Colnon was on the quarterdeck with
Captain Carver as the ship was towed to
sea by the tug Sea 1 King. Mr. Colnon
wanted to take a sea voyage, and. as the
Rice is not allowed to carry passengers,
he had to s,hlp as an ordinary seaman at
25. cents a month In order to make the
passage.
The Austrian steamer Slam arrived
from Pu get Sound yesterday with a load
of coal for John Rosenfeld Sons. This is
the Slam's first .voyage to this port, she
having been purchased by the Rosenfelds
to replace the Peter Jebsen, now the
Government collier Brutus. The Slam
was built in 1&93 and is IPÂ£! tons net bur
den. She is 324.7 feet 10ng.42.2 feet broad
and 18.4 feet deep, and carries about 3000
tons of coal. She is not a very handsome
vessel/but Is well built and Is fairly fast
and is a welcome addition to the coasting
fleet. - . -â¢â ' 'â¢: â  â â - :

THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
MILL VALLEY
OWNERS SUED
Tamalpais Company At
tempts to Take Away
Their Land.
BECAUSE LIQUOR WAS SOLD
IT WAS WINKED AT BY THE
PLAINTIFF FOR YEARS.
Defendants Will Make a Hot Fight
in Court to Have the Proviso
Declared Null and
Void.
Three suits brought last Friday !n San
Rafael by the Mt. Tamalpais Land and
Water Company have made the air of the
picturesque Mill Valley grow hot with
contention, and all the Indications point
to a fierce legal battle on the part of the
defendants.
They are Lottie E. Bundy, John H.
! Mclnnes and Dora Landgraf, all of whom
j bought land from the company years ago
I and were given the usual deeds contain
ing a proviso that the purchaser should
not sell any intoxicating liquor on the
lands so deeded until the year 1900. The
penalty for the violation of this proviso
was stated to be the reversion of the
lands with all the tenements, heredita
ments, etc., thereon. The complaints of
i the â  company allege that the defendants
I have violated the agreement In the deeds
I by selling liquor or allowing It to be sold,
and ask that the court adjudge that the
. property revert to the company.
There are many sidelights to the suit
that will make much interesting reading
when the cases come to trial. It is stated
on behalf of the defendants that there
! are dozens of persons on the land who
are and who have been for years openly
selling liquor in defiance of the proviso
i In the deed, and that the reason why the
i company has not filed suit against them
lis because of a desire to discriminate
against the defendants for the benefit of
j the other violators of the agreement.
It will be urged that the violation of
the agreement on the part of the de
fendants in these three cases did not
work any injury whatever to the com
pany because a large number 'of other
persons have been tacitly permitted by
the company to sell liquor on its grounds.
It will be urged further that the com
pany sued Mclnnes about four years ago
for the same purpose, and because of the
same alleged violation of the proviso in
the deed, and then dropped the suit, from
which time Mclnnes has been selling I
liquor openly and with the knowledge and |
implied consent of the plaintiff in the
suits. This fact will be urged as a laches
on the part of the plaintiff and it will
be construed as an implied agreement on
the part of the company to cancel the
anti-liquor proviso.
The defendants will show also that the '
inn at the summit of Mt. Tamalpais on ,
the land of the company has a bar and i
sells Intoxicating liquors openly, and that
a drug store and several 'hotels In Mill '
Valley do the same. They will show that
for years, as now, the visitor could get
wine or other liqilors with his chicken
dinner at "Prince Charlie's" and at other
resorts, and that the company by wink- !
Ing at those violations has revoked the i
proviso. They will point also to trie sig- I
nificant fact that they alone have been
picked out for prosecution and that tho
other offenders have been allowed to con-"
tlnue to sell liquor without any attempt!
at concealment.
One of the" 1 defenses to be mado will bo
that the proviso is contrary to public pol- |
icy, and Ik, therefore, null and void. Thin
matter has never been tested in Califor
nia, but test eases have been made in
several other States, and in most in
stances the provisos in the deeds bare
been declared Invalid on general prin
ciples, while In almost every rum- In
which, like the one at bar, the grantor of
the real estate has permitted the. proviso
to be violated and has failed, an In thin
case, to diligently prosecute ail offender*,
the courts have decided that the proviso
has been canceled by Implication.
In the meantime, as In the past, tho |
tourist who visits Mill Valley will never
get black in the tongue for want of some
thing stimulating to moisten it with.
SALMON WILL WEAR
ALUMINUM BADGES
NOVEL METHOD FOR TELLING
THE GROWTH OF FISH.
The Fish Commissioners Will Cut the
Fins of Young Salmon for Sci
entific Identification.
Claude Rutter, assistant United States
Fish Commissioner, arrived In this city
lust night after several months of ex
perimental work and scientific Investiga
tion on tho Sacramento River. He has
been studying the salmon, their habits
and their development.
Rutter has made two rowboat trips
down the river, the first from Red Bluff
to Sacramento and the second from Red
ding to the same destination. He says
that the river has been stocked with 40,
000,000 young salmon during the past few
months. But the novel part of his labors
is yet to come. The adult salmon will
be tagged with three-quarter inch plates
either of copper or aluminum fastened to
the fins or gills. Their movements up
stream will then be noted and observa
tion made accordingly. The public are re
quested to return all tagged fish to the
river in the event of a successful angling.
In order to determine the rate of growth
of salmon several hundred specimens of
young fish will have their adipose fins
cut. The adipose fin is on the back In front
of the tall fin and is of fatty nature. Tho
cutting will leave a scar, which will be
the means of Identification should any of
these abbreviated fish return to the
scenes of their youth. A single specimen
of one of these finless fish found in tho
river will be the best evfSence that ne
was launched In IS9B. find his rate of
growth may be accordingly Judged. The
general belief is that the salmon gets out
to sea soon after hatching and aoes npt
return until it has reached the age which
places it in the class of adults. The tag
ging and cutting will be the means by
which the habits of the salmon may be
ascertained by the fish experts.

J. L. WILLCt'TT.
Secretary of the Market Street Railway Com
pany.. â¢ v;: :
San Francisco, July 29, IS9S.
Mayor x- hÂ»>lan said In reference to the
protest: "If the Market Street Company
adheres to the position outlined in this
communication you may assume that
those outer tracks will come up on the
6th of August. Nothing has occurred to
alter our intention to see the street re
stored to tho city. Tho Supervisors will
no doubt consider tho prOtMl at th.ir
n<-xt mooting, but there In no reason to
expect that they will rescind thÂ«lr for
mer action. Tim clerk of the board has
already advortisod for lililh to jmvo the
space where t>i<- tracks are now lornttMl,
and tho contractors are very anxious to
make bids. I have hail â  consultation
with Contractor McDonald, who Ik tlolnir
the paving now In progreiti on Market
street, arid ho aHHtiri'K mo that j.i ir. â  i

Superintendent of Streets Ambrose mild
last evening that .ho had not been served
with a copy of the protest by the Mar
ket-street 1 Company, but ho hud heard
of it.
"I am satisfied," said be, "that those
tracks must come up. My attorney has
been rooking -up the -statutes for several
days, and while he has not as yet given
me his opinion, I am satisfied from what
he has said that the resolution Is legal,
and that I will only doing my duty in
following out the instructions of the Su
pervisors." ; â  -
WELLS-PARGO'S CASE.
No Action Will Be Taken Till the
Supreme Court Decides.
From present appearances It seems un
likely that the courts of this city will be
called upon to determine the merits of the
controversy as to the payment of the
war tax imposed by the Government upon
every- receipt or bill of lading issued by
an express company.
The members of the Merchants* Asso
ciation have collected the necessary evi
dence upon which suits may be brought
and were prepared to submit it to the
United States Attompy for action. The
decision rendered by Judge Tuley of Chi
cago in favor of the shippers has, how
ever, caused a decided change in the
plans of the association. According to
the dispatches the case of the Illinois
Manufacturers' Association will be ap
pealed by the defendants, thus taking it
to the Supreme Court.
As that case would naturally have pre
cedence over all others the court would
entertain It before another on the same
subject. Thus a suit brought here would
be of no avail, ns It would ultimately
have to await that decision. The direct
ors have practically determined to hbld
their case in abeyance unless some con
dition arises to make it expedient to
press their claims. The Supreme Court
is not in session now, and will not recon
vene until October 10.
Where Society Is.
Society, where it i*. and what It la doing. Is
fully told In this week's Town Talk, out to
day. San Jose, Belvedere, Santa Cruz, all the
popular out-of-town resorts, have received due
attention. The portrait on the title-oase Is
Colonel Fred Burgln, the popular military and
club man, now on the Governor's staff. The
Saunterer abounds In good stories, with a few
remarks about the newspaper correspondents
who are winning the war In Cuba. A particu
larly pleaplngr paragraph In the editorial col
umns describes the present pnstltlon of the
Amprican tourist in France and the probable
cause for his unpopularity. The storiettes are
taken from real life and are very pointed.
The dramatic criticisms are full and bright.
Tapped a Till.
Morris Monhelmer, a young man who
nearly got himself into contempt of court
by tampering with witnesses in the case
of Joseph Reid, "the dark secret." was
yesterday morning arrested by Policeman
Fennell for petty larceny. He went to
a cigar stand on O'Farrell and Powell
streets and told the boy in charge a fake
story that his sister was dying and want
ed to see him. After the boy left Mon
helmer took $3 from the till and a num
ber of cigars and plugs of tobacco.

Crocker Trust to Be Settled.
Owing to the death of O>iarles F. Crock
er, who, together with his brother, Wil
liam H. Crocker, was a trustee under a
trust fund left by Charles Crocker, their
father, of which Harriet V. Alexander Is
beneficiary, It became necessary to settle
the accounts of the trust. A motion for
leave to settle the account was heard by
Judge Belcher yesterday and was grant
ed. The value of the property constitut

THE PONIES
ARE WAITING
Some of the Flyers at
Sacramento.
PREPARING FOR SEPTEMBER
STBINGS AT OTHER TRACKS
IN READINESS.
A Great Array of Gallopers, Many of
Which Will Probably Be Heard
From in the Fall
' Campaign.
While hundreds of California horses
are struggling for supremacy, and inci
dentally for money on the tracks of the
far East, : middle West and Montana,
there are still left in this State a couple
of hundred gallopers which are just be
ing "taken up" and" ' gradually made
ready for the fall campaign in the Gold
en State. This consists of one month at
Sacramento (the month of September)
and a trifle over three weeks at Los An
geles in October. There are a few minor
meetings in the State, but not much at
tention is paid to them by owners of
thoroughbreds of the better grade. Most
of the horses are at Agricultural Park,
Sacramento. Following is a partial list
of the owners at present stationed there:
W. ("Butch") Fisher, with sixteen
head, including Wheel of Fortune and
Fashion Plate. He has just started to
gallop the first named, the best daughter
of Gano and winner of over $20,000.
â¢Tom Boyle has fourteen in hand, many
of unknown ability.
W. M. Hurry is handling fifteen head
for P. Herzog, who bred Rey Alfonso,
Charley Quick, Rey del Tlerra, et al.
In the veteran's hands are Rey del Ban
dldos, who has been gelded, fired and
blistered, Yankee Doodle, Red Glenn and
many other well-known performers.
W. ("Frisco") Lind has "Plunger" Mc-
Manus 1 collection in charge, Including
Lord Marmion, Cross Melina, St. Philip
and Charles le Bel. All are looking big
and strong.
Ab Stemler, who has just returned from
Bartlett Springs, has six head galloping.
Flour de Lls looks high in flesh. The
general opinion Is that the great mare
will stand training.
Atkin & Lottridge have half a dozen
flyers in Mike Kelly's hands. Atkin will
remain in Sacramento until the State
Fair meeting is over.
Al Martin has a couple of money-get
ters stabled at "The Park," and Dr. Cut
ler is training Zarro and Royal Spirit,
two very useful ones.
At Ingleside track are the strings of
Matt Storn and W. ("Curly".) Shields,
containing Morellito, Horatio, Mercutio,
Joe Terry and others well known to race
goers.
\ Burns & Waterhouse have about twenty
training in Oakland; Ben Timmons in
charge. A number of the firm's young
sters are being fitted for the nursery
stakes, to bo run at the State Fair meet
ing.
Frank Taylor, who last season handled
E. J. Baldwin's horses, is conditioning a
small Bering at the Oakland course, in
cluding Major Cook and Our Climate;
and Al Smith has old Sport McAllister
galloping along sound and well at the
.same place. /
There must be over thirty Brutuses old
enough to race belonging to the Messrs.
Boots on their MUpttas place; Elmwood.

MERCHANTS SAY
THE PHILIPPINES
SHOULD BE HELD
Business Men Want to Retain
the Conquests in the
Pacific.
McKinley Asked to Keep the Conquered
Islands for Room for the Expansion
of Trade.
. The Chamber of Commerce, tho Manu
facturers and Producers' Association,
the Merchants' Association and all the
kindred commerciaJ bodies of San Fran
cisco yesterday declared by resolution
that it would be advantageous for the
â¢ commerce and expansion of the Pacific
â¢Coast and for all America for the Araeri
â¢ can people to retain full possession of all
â  : the islands of the Philippine gTOup. That
â â 'resolution was adopted at a meeting of
' representative business men and of dele
'" gates from the different bodies at the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday after
â¢n.oon, and the decision reached was tele
graphed at once to President McKinley.
President Hugh Craig, In calling the
meeting to order, said:
In the short period of the last 100 days
events have transpired that have thillled
the national pulse from Maine to Pall'ornla,
in.ni Washington to Florida, entirely ob
literating sectionalism and concentrating
into one paean of praise and gratitude to
the Most High tho swelling hearts of 78,-.
000.000 Americans.
The victories of the United States sea and
land forces have laid at the feet of the
nation the richest and most productive of
all the tropical islands in both the Atlantio
and Pacific oceans. They are ours by light
of conquest, and the enemy is likely to
realize within a few weeks at the most the
utter hopelessness of further contest. When
the time arrives pressure may be attempted
by foreign powers to deprive us of some,
. at least, of the fruits of the magnificent
accomplishment of the United States navy
in the Orient.
It is especially fitting that this chamber
Fhould express Itself clearly in hoping that
ut whatever cost our acquisition* in the
Philippine Islands may be retained as the
permanent possession of the United States,
that our flag now raised there may ever
temain, so it may again be said: "When a
crown fallF in the North Pacific It is pul
verized, and when a sr.>jÂ«ter departs In that
â¢ ocean it departs forever."
Spanish misrule of the Philippines has
been a by-word for centuries; the natural
productiveness of the islands and the In
dustries of its ppople have been cruelly
retard.-.!. To return any portion of that
rk-h group to a tottering monarchy that
cannot adapt Itself to nineteenth century
progression would be a crime. Truly Is it
written: 'â¢None of us llveth to himself."
Of nations the some Is true.
\V.- . mid not anil will not tolerate the
rnlsgovermnent of Cuba, which precipitated
the war, an<l at this stage we cannot help
doing for the Philippine Islands what we
have undertaken to do for Cuba, namely,
five Ihe natives a stable, firm and power
ful government, and show the world that
a government "of the people, by the people,
for the people," although Imperfect at best,
â¢Is calculated to give the most of happlnesa
to tit Kreate^t number.
Holding these Islands means for oui- coast
the oiitrol of an ever-Increasing and enor
". mouK commerce, numerous steamship lines,
carrying Uir natlonul flap, the ent.-. fng of
two additional transatlantic railroads Into
' Pan Francisco, laying; a submarine oible to
China, via Hawaii and Manila, a.id will
â¢ make our city In time the great entrepot
for the Trade of all the coasts of the Pa
cific Ocean.
It Is a i;. od thing that this .lattor, by
acquiring distant possessions, should, by
anticipating and overcoming difficulties of
administration, prepare Itself and Its repre
sentatives for the overwhelming influence
â  which it must exert In the affairs of the
WorM In the near future.
Our exports durfhg the past year ex
Â«*ede.] MM hundred millions (JIOO.OQO.OQO)
>er month. This is only the beginning of a
marvelous development in manufacturing
Industry which will In time make the
United States the workshop of the nations
and the industrial center of human Intelli
gence. Our steamships, carrying the fin
ished product of the loom and machine shop,
will race along every lane and route of
ocean and river commerce; our commercial
mitrine will carry the flag Into every known
eeaport: our navy must be ready to pro
tect our merchants In every clime, and at a
day's call by cable. To do thlg effectually,
â¢ Jiu\al stations, Socks and coal Rupplles con
nected by wire with Washington, must be
ours In all parts of the world, that our
BhiiiinK may there find protection when
neutral ports are closed to us by war.
For these reasons every sentiment of en
l'phtened patriotism and national inde
pendence points to the necessity of retain
ing In perpetuity the properties bo gallantly
won from the enemy by -the intrepidity of
the United States navy, which can be so
easily held against all comers by the grow
ing sea power of our own nation.
Charles Nelson, the vice-president of
the Chamber of Commerce, offered the
following resolution:
â Whereas, by the fortunes of war and the
splendid achievements of the American
navy there have come to our flag the Soo
loo Islands, Ladrone Islands, the Caroline
Islands, the Philippine Islands and their
dependencies; and
"whereas, the Chamber of Commerce of
San Francisco, the Manufacturers and Pro
ducers' Association, the Merchants' Asso
ciation and all other kindred organizations
of San Francisco to express its continued
confidence in and appreciation of the pa
triotic nnd statesmanlike manner in which
the President of the United States has con
ducted the war with Spain, and desirous
of strengthening his hands by expressing
our determination to abide by any adjust
ment of our new possessions that in peace
negotiations may appear to him beet for
the Interests of our beloved country; and
Whereas the abondonment of the Island?
now and the return of Spanish power would
result in a state of affairs even worse than
that to the end which American soldiers
are laying down their lives in Cuba, while
the establishment of American institutions
In the Philippines and the perpetuation of
American patriotism and power there would
rescue the Islands from their seml-baxbar
lsm, give peace and happiness to the people
thereof, Increase the prestige and influence
of the United States, further the great
principles for which It sjande and open an
avenue for the legitimate and profitable
employment of American capital, enterprise
and the world's commerce; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Chamber of Commero*
of San Francisco, voicing the commercial
views of this city, hereby respectfully and
earnestly petitions the President to huW and
retain under our full control the Philippine
Islands and all other lands which are now
or may hereafter be acquired In the present
war with Spain, with a view to strengthen
ing our trade relations with the Orient,
building up a business that belongs to this
country, and extending the cause of human
ity and civilization, as well as greatly ben
efiting the people who will thus be brought
under our nag.
"We should be unanimous in retaining
possession of all the islands we have
taken during this war with the exception
of Cuba." said Mr. Nelson, in support of
the resolution. "When the executive is
sued his war proclamation he held out
to the nation and the worfi] that we were
not commencing a war of acquisition, but
one of humanity. In the course of events
a more aggTosslve war became necessary
and compolltd a great sacrifice of Jlfe
and the expenditure of murh money.
This nation will keep its promise in that
Its war was a humane one. This war
compelled the nation to annex Hawaii
and also to reach far beyond to the
Asiatic coast. I hope the administration
PACIFIC COAST MERCHANTS WANT THE PHILIPPINES,
will listen to us and retain the Philip
pines. The retention of tlie Islands under
the American flap will give us an access
to the countries of As"la and greatly faci
litate the progress of trade In that direc
tion."
George A. Newhall seconded the reso
lution, and addresses supporting It w< re
made by J. P. I^e Count, Charles Bund
scher and Tl. G. Sneath.
J. A. Jones, who declared he was not a
member of the Chamber of Commerce
asked the privilege of tlio floor. He said
he would oppose the resolution. He was
stopped In his remarks and ruled out of
order. The motion was called and the
resolution was unanimously adopted.
OPPOSE ANNEXATION.
The Labor Council Does Not
Want the Competition of
Cheap Spanish Labor.
"I am opposed to the annexation of the
Philippines, but In my Individual opinion
they will be annexed and we will
yet have a standing army of 200,000 and
forty or fifty battle-ships to sustain,"
said A. Furuseth, secretary of the Sailors'
Union, at the weekly meeting of the San
Francisco Labor Council last evening.
The speaker voiced the sentiments of
a majority of delegates present, but in a
mild way, as the speakers who preceded
him waxed warm In their arguments
against the preconceived policy of the
Government In annexing the islands.
Secretary Ed Rosenberg showed why
the United States should not make the
move. After calling attention to the fact
that the council had opposed the annex
ation, of Hawaii a year ago he said he
was a sailor and had seen the conditions
of the peopte who occupied the Philip
pines. He said they were driven by the
lash and worked like hounds. He feared
that as soon as they came to this coun
try the worklngmen would descend to
their condition.
R. Caverly doubted that any Individual
would benefit by the move. He thought
that the gTeat masses of laboring men
should show their disapproval. "The con
dition of the country Is such," he said,
"that if we annex the islands it would be
the most favored spot of our politicians to
hold positions at the expense of the coun
try. We will have free trade between the
islands, and any man who believes in the
protective tariff does not believe In the
annexation of the islands."
W. Macarthtur thought that the organ
izations they represented should express
their views on the subject and the fol
lowing amendment was made, which met
with the approval of those present: "That
this matter be referred to the executive
committee with instructions to draw up a
resolution opposing the annexation or per
manent occupation of the Philippines, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1898.
YARDE-BULLER
ESCAPED FROM
THE MADHOUSE
My Lady Recovered Sufficiently
to Be Let Out of the
Asylum.
She Is on Her Way to This City to End Her
Remaining Days in Peace and
Quiet.
"Lady" Tarde-Buller Is westward
bound. Tho portals of a Parisian mad
house which clanged In her wake not
many weeks ago have been opened to her
again, and once more she has set out to
face a busy world and the society which
In days gone by had banished her.
This time the Hon. Mrs. Yarde-Bulier
Is In quest of the Kirkham thou3nnrls
which have been left to her, and once
procured they shall go toward the estab
lishment of a permanent home for the
wretched woman who has wandered over
two continents, a physical and mental
wreckâ the architect of her own misfor
tune.
Information to the effect that "Tiarty"
Yardo-Buller was in New York City am',
would leave at once for California, to rest
en route and to arrive In San FrancUco
on August 10, was received yesterday by
the .English woman's youngest son, Ralph
Klrkham Blair, a Berkeley student, now
residing In Oakland. She comes, the fon
declares. In secret to live upon the coast
again, to receive some gentle treatment
for her shattered nerves and to live down
the past.
"Lady" Tarde-Buller, If her son is cor
rectly informed, gained her liberty from
the "hospital for the mentally unsound"
in Paris, to which she had been sent
some weeks ago. A rigid treatment had
so far restored her health as to enable
her to^ realize the remarkable end to
which she had come, and resolved to
make one more stand In life this remark
able English woman sought for and tie
cured her discharge, laid worthy plans
for the future and set out to do or to die.
Part of the time she has traveled "in
cog," and thus far she has kept out of
sight and hearing, bent only upon gala
ing health and strength and finally the
prestige that once was her boasted pos
session.
Her son in Oakland, a tall, stoop-shoul
dered fellow ol 20 years, is loth to discuss
his mother or ncr plans. He has but a
passing interest in her now, he says, and
the world has been regaled with enough
of her adventures, he Insists. He is not
a bad sort of a fellow, once he is ap
proached in the right way, but English
fads and fancies have crowded out Â»11
else in his nature, and matters of domes
tic importance find but little to make
them welcome there.
When seen yesterday this youngest
scion of a house that is both proud and
that It be referred back to the various
unions for vote."
In answer to a communication sent Col
lector of Customs Jackson, the following
communication was received;
I have your favor of date the 15th inst.,
asking me what steps I propose to take us to
the mlmlpsion of Chinese persons coming from
the Hawaiian Islands to the United States,
pending a ruling from the Treasury Depart
ment ;it Washington.
In answer I beg to state that- all the rulings
necessary in the premises have already been
made.
The joint resolution providing for the annex
ation of the Hawaiian Islands to the United
States, approved July 7, 189$, by the United
States Congress provides, among other things,
as follows: "Until legislation shall be enacted
extending the United States customs laws and
regulations to the Hawaiian Islands the exist
ing cuÃtoms relations of the Hawaiian Islands
with the United States and other countries
shall remain unchanged."
Alho, "There shall be no further immigration
of Chinese into the Hawaiian Islands, except
upon such conditions as are now or may here
after be allowed by the laws of the United
States, and no Chinese by reason of anything
herein contained shall he allowed to enter the
United States from the Hawaiian Islands."
These provisions are definite and determinate
of your question. Of course I shall obey the
law.
Any supposition that I would deal leniently
In the admission of this class of Immigrants Is
certainly negatived ry my course In these mat
ters since I have held the office of Collector at
this port now a little more than one year.
During that time the excess of departures over
thr.ne admitted amounts to 1302.
You can, rest assured that nothing but the
express mandate of the law will induce me to
admit Chinese to a landing at this port.
I beg to remain, very respectfully,
J. P. JACKSON, Collector.

SENTIMENT OF THE COAST
Unanimous Desire to Retain
the Islands for the Benefit
of Trade.
The sentiment of th â¢Â» Pacific Coast 5n
regard to the Philippines Is further Indi
cated by the following dispatches:
PORTLAND, Or., July 29.â The Port
land Chamber of Commerce to-day adont
ed the following resolution, which was tel
egraphed to President McKlnley:
Resolved, That the Chamber of Commerce of
Portland, Or., reflecting the sentiment of a
unfortunate, said: "Yes, my mother i 3
in New York city and will be here on
August 10. Everybody thinks she is in a
French insane asylum, and I did myself,
don't you know, until 1 was notified to
day to the contrary. I went to San Fran
cisco and investigated, finding out that
her agents there knew all there was to
be learned.
"My mother had been placed in an asy
lum all right enough, but asylums are
hard to endure, don t you know, and she
was: soon sufficiently well, I am told, to
wish herself somewhere else. So she
agreed to establish a home and take life
moderately, and finally got out of the
Place, although I am informed that she
had a merry time of it getting free, don't
you know.
"Now, we may not live here, in fact I
favor living in the East. But her health
will be seen to. and all that. She will
first settle her affairs here, which have
been more or less complicated since the
death of my grandmother last spring, and
then select a home.
\ "The world, don't you know, thinks her
insane, but I am informed that she can
be cured. Of course I hope.so." And hero
the young Englishman gathered himself
together in his pearl-buttoned overcoat
and waved his gloved hand In a sudden
adieu.
This early release from the retreat
which had been selected for her abroad
will astonish a number of "Lady". Yarde-
Buller's most Intimate friends, most of
whom believed that after an exciting and
unhappy life she had gone to a madhouse
ot end her days.
Her return is the sequel, of a most re
markable story, for, born in affluence and
raised to fame, honor and refinement, her
failure in life was one which few women
could have ever overcome.
As the daughter of old General Kirk
ham in Oakland she -was beautiful, ac
complished and petted, but the glamor of
an exciting life claimed he; marriage
brought strife, and fortunes melted away
in .her hands.
In. desperation she traveled, but at the
Mink" â? ' th re . She w . as entertained, the
clink of the ice-pitcher was too often
heard in the halls, and "Lady" Yarde-Bul
ler went down the scale until at last, with i
the consent of her relatives, she had to
be taken into the home of a former ser- I

Lamentable Lack of Spirit in What
Was Once the Crack Athletic
Organization of the
State.
On Monday evening the Olympic Club
will make another struggle to elect a
new board of directors and executive of
ficers for the coming year. The
president, George A. Newhall, has
called for a general meeting in the
club gymnasium on Monday night, Au
gust 1, to elect a nominating committee
whose duty it will bÂ© to name the execu
tive officers and the board of directors
on the regular ticket.
Two years ago the present administra
tion was elected to office after a faint
opposition. They have held office since
that time not because they were re-elect
ed last year, but because the spirit of
the club was at such a low ebb that no
ono could be induced to head the ticket.
A nominating committee was elected, but
so multiform and varied were the de
mands of the individuals composing it
that no agreement was reached, and the
committee, after many meetings, dis
solved itself. At least a dozen names
were suggested for the presidency, yet no
choice was made. The result was that
George A. Newhall and the board elect
ed with him were forced to remain In of
fice another year.
That year has expired and efforts will
be made to put up a new ticket.
Whether this call for a general election
of a nominating committee by the mem
bers will or will not be productive of any
results is a matter which time must set
tle. In the old days there were always
two tickets in the field, the regular and
the opposition, and the fight waged be
tween them was both active and spirited.
It showed the existence of a healthy
spirit in the club, something which has
altogether vanished.
The present board seems anxious to be
relieved of its duties and tHere are
some members who are equally anxious
that it should come to pass. Some talk
has been current that the meeting will
be well attended and that a nominating
committee has already been slated. But
the majority seem to be of the opinion
that the club is lifeless, that no esprit de
corps exists, and that the meeting for the
election of the nominating committee will
have to be postponed from time to time
as it was a year ago. Newhall and the
others of the present regime are in for
another siege If this prove to be the case
They have held the fort for two years
and the present indications point to an
other year's holding.

BECKER AND
CREEGAN WILL
BE SET FREE
The Bankers' Association Is
Disgusted With Lees'
Methods.
His Failure to Seal the Fate of the Ne 1 ada
Bank Forgers Was Expected â A
Promise to Deane.
Chief Lees Is indignant over the action
of the Supreme Court in granting Becker
and Creegan, the noted bank forgers, a
new trial. As usual, he thinks that the
court erred, simply because the decision
adds to his incompetency.
To overcome the "awful blow," as one
of his sleuths expressed it, he is telling
his few friends that the Supreme Jus
tices do not know their business. Had
the decision been in his favor he, no
doubt, would have extolled their virtues,
not only as exponents of the law, but as
citizens, who were anxious to place such
men as Becker and Creegan in the peni
tentiary, where he thinks they belong.
His signal failure to carry out the sen
tence of Judge "Wallace created consider
able amusement wherever the decision of
the Supreme Court was discussed. Such
expressions as "Lees has lost his grip,"
or that the "Chief is a dead one," were
frequently heard.
The Nevada Bank forgery Is perhaps
one of the most noted in the criminal
annals of this State. In 1895 the eang,
which consisted of Becker, Creegan,
Frank Deane and a noted crook, who is
known to the Plnkertons as "Rat" Mc-
Cluskey, arrived here from the East.
Deane rented an office in a building on
Market street, and as the first move in
carrying out the bold crime he deposit
ed $2000 with the Nevada Bank. The fol
lowing day he went to Woodland and
purchased a draft for $12 on the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank. The draft was turned
over to Becker, who Is known as the
king of forgers, and he raised it to $22,
000. The bogus paper was subesquently
deposited in the Nevada Bank by Deane.
A few days later he went to the bank
and drew the check for $20,000. Not sus
pecting anything wrong the cashier gave
him the amount in gold. After dividing
the money among the gang McCluskey
and Deane went to St. Paul, while Beck
er and Creegan journeyed to New York.
While they were arranging to "work off"
another forged check the clerk of the
bank which they intended to "beat" rec
ognized McCluskey from a picture which
was published in a newspaper and con
cluding that ho was at his old tricks at
once notified the Pinkerton agency.
Both McCluskey and Deane were subse
quently arrested, and being recognized as
two of the men who had a hand in the
Nevada Bank forgery, the authorities lost
no time in notifying the police of this city.
After they were brought back Deane, who
ciaimed he was shabbily treated by Beck
er and Creegan, "peached" on them. They
were indicted by the Grand Jury and
through the information furnished by
Deane they were located and arrested. In
the meantime McCluskey had been ac
quitted of the charge, and Deane put un
der heavy bond pending the trial of Beck
er and Creegan. Lees promised him his
freedom if he would testify against his
two accomplices.
"Help me convict these fellows," he is
Bald to have remarked, "and I'll see that
[ you are well taken care of. The bankers
are hot after Becker, and if I can secure
a conviction in this case they will begin to
realize I am all right."
Deane, who admits he is a crook, asked
Lees what compensation he was to get for
"squealing" on his pals-.
"Anything you want, my boy," he re
marked. "Your freedom, money; any
thing you desire."
Deane replied that he prized his free
dom more than money, and on that con
dition he decided to take the witness
stand against Becker and Creegan. Alter
the men were convicted mainly on his
testimony the Chief promised to release
him in a few days.
"AT" a " lan of "my word," he remarked,
patting Deane on the shoulder. "You're
all right, and I Intend to help you "
After several weeks had passed and
still no sign of his promised freedom
Deane sent for Lees and asked him when
he intended to release him.
"Don't worry, my boy," he remarked,
his face illuminated by that same old
smile. "We've got them. Tney can't es
cape us this time."
By way of complimenting Deane on his
efforts in securing a conviction, Lees
after extending "the glad hand," prom
ised to take him to a prize fight which
was to take place the next night. In the
meantime the scheming head of the-
Police Department wrote to the Pinker
tons and had them send several tele
grams congratulating him on his "clever
capture." As Lees did not even know
the Identity of the quartet of forgers the
clever capture" telegrams caused con
siderable amusement in police circles
That is almost three years ago. Becker
and Creegan are still in the County Jail,
while Deane, who has grown stale wait
ing for Lees to keep his promise, lan
guishes in a cell in the City Prison
On account of his turning State's evi
dence the "kind-hearted" Chief did not
send him to the County Jail, as he did
Becker and Creegan, but allowed him to
remain In the City Prison, under the
watchful eye of Sergeant Wolf. Since
Deane has oeen locked up in the City
Prison Lees has seen that he received
two meals a day from the outside. The
expense, it Is needless to state, is not
borne by Lees, but comes out of the po
lice contingent fund.
Last night Lees consulted Captain Sey
mour as to the advisability of proceeding
further with the case.
While both were reticent on the subject,
it is believed that Lees is satisfied with
the reward he received from the Bank
ers' Association for "catching" the forg
ers, and is willing to abandon further
prosecution.
It is known that the Bankers' Associa
tion is disgusted with the failure of Lees
to send Becker and Creegan to the peni
tentiary, and will not spend any more
money to secure a conviction.
