Sampson Sends Dispatches to

Some of the Vessels of the Spanish Fleet
Are Yet Hovering Around
Martinique.

PUERTO PLATA, San Do
mingo, May 14. â The United
States torpedo-boat Porter arrived
here at 3:15 this afternoon. She
steamed rapidly past old Colum
bus Fort, where no flags were dis
played nor any other official recog
nition taken of her presence, and
cast anchor in the harbor.
Lieutenant Vincent came ashore
in the Health Officer's boat and
sent dispatches to Washington to
determine the future course of
Rear Admiral Sampson's fleet.
Other ships are sailing along the
coast of San Domingo awaiting a
reply.
The searchlight thrown ashore
last night is believed to have come
from an American hospital ship go
ing west.
The Porter was not hurt at San
Juan, although she went within
1 500 yards of Fort Morro beside
the lowa. Lieutenant Vincent
said they got in very close with
out being seen, although the light
house was lighted. There was no
reply to their shots for fifteen min
utes, all the men in the San Juan
fortifications probably being asleep.
Admiral Sampson had no intention
of bombarding the town, purpos
ing only to attack the fortifications.
He did not wish particularly to de
molish Morro, but the stronger
works on top of the bluff to the
east. Shots fired at these works
must have done some damage to
the city beyond.
The barracks appeared to have
been destroyed, and some of the
guns were hit, but the fort was not
silenced and was peppering away
heavier than ever when the Porter
left on Thursday, sailing first to
ward St. Thomas and then coming
back here. The Porter occupied a
position where Fort Morro' s guns
would have told but for the fact
that the best of the Spanish
marksmen could not fire straight.
Some of the Spanish guns used
projectiles which tumbled in the
air, revolving as they fell. The
Americans pointed at them in as
tonishment.
No Spanish warships have been
sighted by Sampson's fleet. The
Porter expects to leave here as
soon as she gets word from Wash
ington. The sailors who came
ashore from the Porter complain of
the heat, and say accommodations
on her for a sea trip are very poor.
The belief aboard is that the
Spanish squadron may try to cap
ture the battleship Oregon.
SPANISH WARSHIPS
OFF CURACOA ISLAND
Arrival of Some of the Enemy's Fleet
Caused a Belief That a Battle
Was Imminent.

WILLEMSTAD, CURACAO IS
LAND, May 14. â Six Spanish
men-of-war were sighted off this
The San Francisco Call
harbor this morning. The ap
proach of the warships to this port
created the greatest excitement.
The cruisers Maria Teresa and
Vizcaya later in the day entered
the harbor. The cruisers Almi
rante Oquendo and Cristobal
Colon are cruising out at sea with
two torpedo-boat destroyers. 1
have been unable to ascertain how
long the Spanish warships will re
main here, but it is believed they
stopped here only to receive and
send dispatches.
Great interest is taken here in
the war between the United States
and Spain, and the appearance of
the Spanish warships caused a ber
lief that there may be a battle in
this vicinity. The harbor was
thronged all day with sightseers.

ST. PIERRE, Martinique, May
14. â The general situation here re
mains unchanged. What was sup
posed to be part of the Spanish
fleet was seen again to-day off the
southwest point of the island. The
Spanish torpedo-boat destroyer
Terror remains at Fort de France.
The Spanish warship Alicante is
also in the harbor. Signal lights
have been seen along the hills back
of the city for two nights.
Consul Darte saw the Governor
of Martinique at Fort de France
and lodged a protest. He was told
that everything in the world would
be done to put a stop to the sig
nals. It was noticed that the sig
nals seemed to have decreased
after this.
Captain Cotton of the United
States cruiser Harvard is being
treated very courteously by the
authorities here. It is impossible
to state how long he will remain.
The Harvard is still in a disabled
condition. Her mooring in the har
bor has been changed.

Were Changed.
CAPE HAYTIEN, May 14.â The
steamer Supply (formerly the American
steamer Illinois) under command of
Lieutenant Roberts from Philadelphia
arrived here at 5:30 o'clock to-day.
Upon his arrival Lieutenant Roberts
wired to Admiral Sampson for orders
Admiral Sampson is at Puerto Plata,
on the north coast of Santo Domingo.
He communicated to-day with the
American Consul at Cape Haytlen.
BUENOS AYRES, May 14.â Advices
from Rio Janeiro confirm the reports of
the arrival at Bahia, Brazil, of the
United States warships Oregon, Mari
etta and Nicthemy. The steamer Rio
Janeiro, which has arrived at Pernam
buco, reports having seen during the
night Wednesday last three vessels
supposed to be Spanish warships,
cruising before Cape San Anostlnogo.

United States cruiser Montgomery ar
rived here at 7 o'clock in order to take

crulser Yale, formerly the American
1 line steamer Paris, has also called here
and it is understood she will clear with

LONDON, May 14.â The Star says a
Madrid dispatch via Paris ihrows in
teresting light gathered from an offi
cial source on Admiral Cervera's
movements since he left the Cape
Verde Islands. It appears that he
headed for St. Pierre Miquelon m th-->
coast of Newfoundland, where sealed
instructions awaited him. There col
liers from Sydney were met and the
Spanish fleet coaled. Admiral Cer
vera's instructions then were to raid
Portland, Boston and Newport, and if
Rear Admiral Sampson bombarded
Havana to draw him off. The news
from Manila seems to have changed
the plans.
The next proposed move was to de
coy Rear Admiral Sampson to Porto
Rico and then sail rapidly for Havana
and destroy the few ships left there.
Finally, should Admiral Cervera, j
after reaching Santiago de Cuba,
learn that two American squadrons
were coming to meet him, thus leav- j
ing the sea free, his plan would be to j
avoid them, sail straight for Charles- j
ton and bombard that city.

SPAIN'S CAPE VERDE
FLEET NOW HEADED
FOR CUBA'S COAST
At Last It Would Appear the Dons Are
Seeking to Reach Havana or
Cienfuegos.
Sampson and Schley in Quest of the Enemy's Ves
sels and May Soon Co-operate in a Great Sea
Battle With the Hostile Ships.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 14.
Last night every one in
Washington was speculating
as to the whereabouts of the
various fleets and their prob
able destination. Strangely
enough, not even the Presi
dent or members n* > u^ War
Board were able to say where
Sampson's fleet was at that
time or what its destination
would be, for Sampson's
orders were discretionary.
Soon after the cablegram was
received from Captain Cotton
of the Harvard locating the
Spaniards off the island ;of
Martinique, and after the
Cabinet had given a brief
half hour's consideration to
the matter, Secretary Long
filed a cablegram to Sampson
directing him to go in quest
of the Spaniards unless he
was apprised by cable via St.
Thomas or by his scouting
cruisers that the enemy had
sailed from Martinique in a
contrary direction, in which
case he was to steam as
rapidly as possible for Ha
vana.
This cablegram of necessity
passed through St. Pierre,
Martinique, and there was
delayed in telegraphic trans
mission or else the dispatch
cruiser Yale delayed its trans
mission across the Virgin
Straits to Sampson at San
Juan. However that may be,
it is certain that Admiral
Sampson received news from
Martinique that the Spaniards
had sailed southwesterly, for
early this morning he was
reported off the north coast
of Hayti, near Puerto Plata,
steaming rapidly westward.
When the department this
afternoon received reliable
news that the Spaniards had
been sighted off the island of
Curacao, Venezuela, 500 miles
west-southwest of Martinique,
the officials could account for
its arrival there on no other
hypothesis than that reports
from St. Pierre last night to
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the effect that the Spaniards
were still in that vicinity were
willfully misleading. To have
traversed this distance would
have required at least forty
eight hours, so that the ves
sels must have left Martinique
some time on Thursday. It
is considered barely possible
that Spain has more vessels
on this side of the Atlantic
than we are aware of.
It has been suggested that
possibly the vessels observed
near Martinique for the last
day or two did not belong to
the Cape Verde fleet, but
were some small men-of-war
belonging to Spain, which
hovered in those waters for
the purpose of deceiving and
distracting attention from the
Cape Verde fleet. It was sug
gested that Spain might have
assembled a "quaker fleet"
off Martinique, while the Cape
Verde fleet might be moving
in some other direction. This,
of course, is the merest spec
ulation, but illustrates the
condition of uncertainty
which prevails here. The de
partment officials insist there
is absolutely no doubt that
the vessels at Martinique orx
Wednesday comprised what
is known as the Cape Verde
fleet, but they do not know
whether this fleet has been
augmented The press dis
patches contained in several
of the morning papers, stat
ing that the fleet is composed
of eight war vessels and
seven torpedo-boat destroy
ers and torpedo-boats, was
puzzling to the department,
bu t whatever uncertainty
may have existed heretofore
it is pretty well settled to
night that a powerful Span
ish fleet was this morning
off the coast of Venezuela,
near Curacoa, steaming west
ward. It was at first sur
mised that the Spaniards had
taken this route with the
hope that they might be
able to intercept the Oregon
and Marietta, but if such is
their intention they will be
woefully disappointed, for2
the big battleship and gun
boat Marietta and Nictheroy
are safe in the harbor of
Bahia, Brazil, where slight
repairs are being made on
the Oregoa
Naval officers here are
laughing over the bait the
Spaniards tried to swallow
and which brought them to
their present situation. The
bait was the Oregon. She
should have been in the vi
cinity of Martinique now, ac
cording to the schedule pub
licly announced by the de
partment when she sailed
from San Francisco. She
kept to the schedule down
the west coast of South
America and around the
Horn, then began to halt and
make slow progress, with
the result that to-day she is
well away from the place the
Spaniards expected to find
her. It appears to be pretty
well settled to-night that
Sampson is speeding back to
Havana and that he will
reach there in good time, but
it is not so certain that this
is also the destination of
Schley's flying squadron. It
is more likely that he will
sail through the Windward
passage to protect the small
men -of - war along Cuba's
south coast, for Sampson is
abundantly able to take care
of Havana, and it would be
criminal negligence to expose
our small vessels now block
ading Cienfuegos to the fire
of the Spanish fleet.
At Havana Schley would be
out of reach of Cienfuegos,
while, were he stationed in
the Windward Passage, he
would not only be able to in
tercept the enemy on the way
to Havana, but could sail
quickly to Cuba's southwest
ern coast when apprised of
their approach by the swift
scouting cruiser Minneapolis.
Therefore, as stated in these
dispatches last night, there is
good reason to believe that
Schley has sailed for the
Windward Passage instead of
Havana.
It is quite generally be
lieved in naval circles to

night that the Spanish fleet
will seek to secure a base of
supplies on the Cuban coast,
now that the fortifications of
San Juan have been reduced,
and Spain's land defenses
have thus been materially
weakened There are two
points toward which the
Spanish prows may even
now be turned and the ships
sent forward at top speed in
the hope of reaching some
base before the Americans
have headed them off. These
ports are Cienfuegos and Ha
vana, on the south and north
shores of the island of Cuba,
respectively.
In considering the chances
of such an enterprise dis
tance comes prominently
into the calculation. The
route to Havana by the Wind
ward Passage, between the
eastern end of Cuba and
Hayti, would add to the
steaming distance of the
Spaniards. Meanwhile the
flying squadron would in all
likelihood have headed them
off from that port. It seems
altogether improbable that
the Spanish vessels can reach
Havana without a fight, even
with due consideration for
the probable superior speed
of the enemy. If Cienfue
gos were the objective point
there might be more difficulty
in intercepting the enemy.
Sampson might do so by sail
ing southward or around the
north side of San Domingo
and Hayti and thence through
the Windward Passage.
Schley might, perhaps, do it
by skirting around the west
end of Cuba without stop
ping on his way. This would
add about 650 miles to his
course, making a run approx
imately 1700 miles from
Hampton Roads.
There seems to be little
danger of the Spanish vessels
reaching Havana in advance
of an American force suffi-
ciently powerful to prevent a
junction between the ships
and the land defenses. It is
probable, on the other hand,
that a Spanish effort to reach
Cienfuegos first and to make
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
it the future base of Spanish
naval operations might be
successful.
While these movements in
Atlantic waters are occupying
the most attention, the Phil
ippines are not forgotten. It
was decided to-day to in
crease the number of troops
to be sent to reinforce Dewey
at Manila from 12,000 to
1 Â£,000. They will be sent
from Nebraska, Colorado and
Wyoming. General Miles said
to-night that the City of
Peking, convoyed by the
Charleston, would leave San
Francisco on Monday and
that 1300 troops from the
Fourteenth Infantry, Third
Artillery and Fifth Cavalry
would be sent on this first
expedition under command
of General Otis. He was not
able to say how soon the
other transports could be
ready to leave.
The island of Curacoa was
originally Spaoish and is peo
pled mainly by descendants
of Spaniards, though it is
now one of the Dutch pos
sessions. The Spanish ad
miral's course was also influ
ended by the fact that the
French cable starting from
Caracas, Venezuela, touches
at the island of Curacoa,
thence proceeds northwest
ward through the Caribbean
to Hayti, with spurs running
east and west to Porto Rico
and Cuba respectively. He
is thus enabled to get in
touch from Curacoa with the
Spanish authorities in Cuba
and Porto Rico, and through
them directly with the Span
ish admiralty at Madrid. No
I immediate battle with Ad
miral Sampson's fleet is ex
pected, and the Spaniards, as
seems likely, have succeeded
in passing south of the Amer
ican fleet and are now well to
the westward of it. As the
enemy is in reach of the ca
ble the Navy Department re
gards it as of the most vital
concern that the exact where
abouts of the American ships
should not be made known
during the next few days.
Thus far they have felt han
dicapped by the fact that the
Spanish admiral knew the
whereabouts of our ships,
while we were in doubt as to
the locality of his ships.
The officials here regard it
as essential during the next
few days to reverse this con
dition so that the Spanish
admiral will be moving in
the dark, while our officers
will be posted as to his
movements through the Car
ibbean. The department
doubtless is informed as to
the whereabouts of Admiral
Sampson's squadron, but it
does not see fit to give any
information on the subject,
and the same rigid silence
prevails as to the where
abouts and destination of
Commodore Schley's flying
squadron. The game has
reached such a critical state
that premature publication as
to the whereabouts of our
ships might cause inesti
mable loss and failure of
present plans.
It is not to be supposed
that the Navy Department,
with a knowledge of the
whereabouts of the Spanish
fleet, is going to allow any of
its hard-worked little cruisers
and gunboats engaged in
blockading duty on the Cu
ban coast to fall victims to the
huge Spanish ironclads. Their
commanders will be promptly
advised of the approach of
the Spaniards, and it may be
set down as sure that unless
the department is satisfied
that Sampson or Schley can
head off and crush the Span
ish fleet the Cuban blockade
vessels will be given permis
sion to take care of them
selves and get out of harm's
way. The determined attack
made by the Marblehead and
other vessels on the ocean
cable running seaward from
Cienfuegos shows that the
Government finds it neces-
sary to cut off all communi
cation betwen Captain-Gen
eral Blanco at Havana and
Spain by cable.
That the effort was not wholly
successful was owing to the ap
pearance of a superior force of
cavalry, aided by machine guns,
which appeared to have taken the
American sailors in the boats en
gaged in cable-cutting by surprise.
They were prepared to risk a few
rifle shots, but not the murderous
fire of Maxims. However, Captain
McCalla, who is noted for de
termination and courage, if for any
quality, it can be taken for granted
will not abandon the task until he
has succeeded. Considering the
great strategic value of such a
move, the loss sustained by the
American vessels was insignificant
and the venture was certainly
warranted by the results. Once
Blanco is prevented from com
municating with Spain as well as
Porto Rico, it is expected discour
agement will set in and this cam
paign consequently will have an
earlier conclusion.
The War Department shows no
signs of relaxation in its war pre
parations, but appears to be mak
ing ready for hostilities on the the
ory that they are to last a long
time. Thus bids were opened to
day for supplying the Government
a very large number of piercign
shells of the largest caliber, such
as are used almost entirely by coast
defense guns in attacking or repel
ling heavy iron-clad ships. An
other transport was chartered to
day at New York, indicating that
the move of the army upon Cuba
is not to be long delayed, else the
Government would not go to the
needless expense of chartering the
boat immediately.
Two of the big tugs bought by
the navy from private parties were
christened to-day â the Hortense
becoming the Tacoma and the
William H. Brown becoming the
Piscataqua. The nava! register
promises to include some odd
names, for only recently the pretty
yacht Felicia was rebaptized by the
uncouth name of Uncanoomuck.

KEY WEST, Fla., May 14.â The U.
S. S. Uncas, Captain Brainard, left here
soon after midnight last night forC :ba,
to rescue two Americans captured by
the Spaniards on Friday. Correspond
ent Knight of the London Times is
aboard the Uncas, and the plan is to
send him ashore under a flag of truce
to negotiate for the surrender of the
prisoners in exchange for two Spanish
captives taken on one of the prizes.
The Americans were carried over by
a dispatch-bo t on Friday and were
sent ashore in a small boat, effecting- a
landing near Mariel. As the small boat
approached the land there was no sign
of life ashore and it was thought that
the men were safe.
Dispatches received to-day told of_
the capture of the men by Spanish sol
diers almost immediately after their
landing and of their imprisonment in
Fort Cabanas as spies. Negotiations
with Washington were promptly be
gun and orders to dispatch the Uncas
on the mission of rescue came last
night from Secretary Long to Commo
dore Remey.

PARIS, May 14.â The Temps this
evening published the following dis

"The successes achieved by the Span
ish troops against the American land
ing parties in Cuba and the insignifi
cant result of the bombardment of San
Juan de Porto Bico have strengthened
the feeling here in favor of prolonging
the war in the Antilles and Philippines.
It Is believed that Admiral Cervera's
squadron will, as soon as it has picked
up its dispatch-boats and torpedo-boats
off Martinique, pursue a cruise into Cu

FLYING SQUADRON
EAGER FOR ACTION
All the Men Under Commodore
Schley Ready to Face the
Spaniards.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., May 14.â
Owing to the dense fog that hung over
Hampton Roads this morning and oth
er reasons that were not made public
by Captain Sigsbee, the cruiser St. Paul
did not -weigh anchor before daylight
to join the flying squadron, which left
Hampton Roads yesterday afternoon
under sealed orders. The St. Paul took
on the greater part of her ammunition
here, which came by express. Included
in the supply were twelve car-loads of
smokeless powder, but only one car
load was transferred to the ship up to
last night. Some time after daybreak
this morning the St. Paul steamed
down to Old Point Comfort, where the
cruiser New Orleans was lying, but re
turned to her anchorage and remained
until 3:15 in the afternoon when she
again moved to Old Point Comfort.
There the St. Paul finished taking on
the supply of smokeless powder. It
was 5 o'clock when the big warship
pulled up her anchor at Old Point and
started on a bee line for the Virginia
Capes, going, it is suppopsed, to Join
Commodore Schley's squadron. The
New Orleans is still at Old Point Com
fort, and It is not known when she will
sail.
FORT MONROE, Va., May 14.â 0n
Board the Flagship Brooklyn at Sea,
via Pilot-boat, May 13.â Commodore
Winfleld Scott Schley and the fighters
of his flying squadron steamed out of
Hampton Roads this afternoon at 4:25
o'clock under sealed orders. The entire
squadron was to have gone, and at 1
o'clock all the ships had reported ready
for getting away, but at 1:15 p. m. a
dispatch from the Navy Department
ordered Coi.-modore Schley to leave the
cruisers New Orleans and Minnneapo
lis in Hampton Roads for further or
ders.
Both are fast ships, much better
timemakers than the big battle-ships,
and could leave hours later and still
catch the squadron. Captain Folger
of the New Orleans was left In charge
of the two cruisers.
At precisely 4:20 the flagship signaled
that she was ready to proceed, and at
4:25 the Brooklyn, the Massachusetts,
the Texas and the Scorpion were mov
ing majestically down Hampton Roads
for the sea, the water with scarce a
ripple on it and the bright sun touch
ing Old Glory as if in tender benedic
tion.

ron was well illustrated by the ring
ing cheers that echoed from the fore
castle down to the quarterdeck and
made Commodore Schley remark with
a smile: "Those are the boats for
fighting."
He refused to say where he thought
the fleet was bound for, but the fact
that the collier Sterling accompanied
them, carrying 2500 tons of extra coal
and that each ship had on board extra
coal and water, would seem to indicate
that there is lively work cut out for
them.
It is a hard fighting aggregation, this
flying squadron, under a cool and dar
ing fighter. The Massachusetts and
Texas arc not equaled in fighting power
by anything in the Spanish navy, and
the Brooklyn is the best fighting ship
of her kind in the world. In totals the
ships carry four 13-inch guns, two 12
inch guns, sixteen 8-inch guns, ten 6
inch guns; sixteen 5-inch guns, and an
enormous battery of rapid-fire guns of
smaller caliber.
As soon as the squadron was at sea
active preparations were made to meet
an enemy. The ships were stripped for
action, all lights covered, ammunition
supplied to the guns and men sent to
fighting quarters for the night. The
ships are all ammunitioned to their full
carrying capacity, and will do desperate
fighting. The men at the guns have
been proved to be accurate marksmen.
At Cape Henry, where the squadron
arrived at dark, the pilots were dis
charged, taking their own boat. The
men worked the ships in safety
through the various mines in Hampton
Roads. "W. W. Scott piloted the Brook
lyn, J. K. Peak the Massachusetts and
George Bew the Texas.
Commodore Schley stood upon the
bridge as long: as the light lasted, and
when he retired said: "I have not been
so happy in weeks. Inaction was kill
ing me." Nearly every officer and man
on the flagship seemed to think the
same way.

PREPARINC FOR A
PEACEFUL SOLUTION
OF THE CONFLICT
Department of State Is Already Antici
pating the Closing of the
Hostilities.
But the Prospects Are That Spain Will Never
Sue for Peace Until Her Friends in
Europe Intervene.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 14.
While the War Department is busy ;
preparing for the invasion of Cuba '
and the Navy* Department is on the
tip-toe of expectancy of further re- j
suits in naval warfare, the State De- ;
partment is quietly at work prepar
ing to meet all possible contingencies '
that may arise in a peaceful solution I
of the pending difficulties when the |
work of the other two departments j
shall have been accomplished.
bpain is expected sooner or later to j
realize the impossibility of the con
flict, and in some shape there will
come a suggestion of peace. But in
what form no one can say. Secretary
Day and those of the higher officials
of the State Department who are in !
his confidence are at present acting j
on the theory that the defeat of the j
Bpanish squadron under Admiral Cer
vera will bring Spain to her senses,
that such a defeat will inevitably re
sult in peace even if it does not bring
immediate overtures from the Span
ish Government.
Informally the possibilities of
peace have been discussed at meet
ings of the Cabinet as well as in the
State Department, and of course there
is any quantity of outside specula
tion, but State Department qfficials I
will not allow themselves to indulge j
in speculations for publication, and !
those close to the President are as a j
rule equally reluctant. To-night, j
however, I had a talk with a member j
of the Cabinet, who gave me his own ,
ideas.
"In dealing with Spain," said he,
"we Â£.re in a sense dealing with an
unknown quantity, and for this rea
son the President realizes that it is
next to impossible to make any pre
diction as to when Spain will open
her eyes to the inevitable and sue for
peace. If we were dealing with any
of the enlightened nations of Europe
we would know what to expect, and
we could make our predictions ac
cordingly. Any other nation of Eu
rope would, in Spain's predicament,
see that the odds against her are
overwhelming, and that, having made
the best effort possible, she would
sue for peace. But the Spanish people
have been educated by those in power
to believe that Spain is invincible.
The people have been kept in utter
ignorance of the inadequacy of the
Spanish navy and the incompetency
of Spanish officials in both the army
and the navy.
"The absolute destruction of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIiL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
Spanish fleet in the Pacific and the
inevitable loss of the Philippines
ought to open the eyes of the Spanish
officials. It is no surprise that the
real facts have not dawned upon the
Spanish people, because, judging by
the reports which are given out from
Madrid, the character of Dewey's vic
fhas been carefully concealed
the Spanish public. The de
ion of the batteries at San
portending, as it does, the in
Â»le loss of Porto Rico, ought to
away whatever doubt eat
. Add to this the state of affairs
I in Cuba and the overwhelming odds
against Spain, and you have a condi
! tion of affairs, which, irrespective of
: the troubles at home, point inevitably
i to the downfall of the dynasty.
"Faced by such odds, any other na
| tion would, I believe, begin overtures
| for peace, especially in the contin
| gency of the defeat of the squadron
under Cavera. But it is the boast
of the Spanish people that their na
tion has never sued for peace. They
are tenacious of their national honor,
and it may be that there will be no
movement toward peace on their part
| until European nations, in self-de
i fense, step in and force them to it.
"If, at this distance, we can judge

of the conditions in Spain, her in
ternal troubles are even greater than
her foreign ones. It is more than
likely that the defeat which we be
lieve will come will bring about
revolution and anarchy in Spain. It
is difficult to see how the dynasty can
be maintained in view of the incom
petence of Spain's leading men.
"I do not put much confidence in
the cabled reports which tell of a
strong peace element being now in
the Cabinet as the result of recent
changes. No Cabinet could stand
which would make overtures toward
peace at this time. There must be one
more desperate effort on the part of
the Spanish forces to retrieve the dis
aster of Manila. That effort will be
made within the next few days.
When we have defeated the Spanish
fleet Spain's friends in Europe may
start a movement looking toward
peace. It is certain that this Govern
ment will listen to no suggestions of
peace which fall short of the loss to
Spain of Cuba, Porto Rico and the
Philippines. If, after she has suffered
another defeat, Spain asks for peace
on those terms she can have it, but
she may not ask it, and in that event
tjo man can predict what will follow.
"I believe that Spain, as a nation,
will cease to exist, for the time being
at least â and that peace may come
through this dissolution, and not un
til it occurs."
HAVANA IS PREPARED
FOR A LONG SIEGE.
Spanish Troops in Cuba Said to Num
ber One Hundred and Forty
Thousand.
CITY OF MEXICO, May 14.âLead
ing Spanish residents have issued news
from Havana, brought by the steamer
Lafayette to Vera Cruz. Blanco has
shown great energy in preparing for
the expected siege by the American
fleet and land forces. The city and
forts are provisioned for three or four
months. It is believed the mortality
among the besiegers in the hot and
rainy season will compel the Ameri
cans to raise the siege.
Havana is now surrounded by en
trenchments for thirty miles. The
troops in the garrison number 70,000
and a like number are in the interior
fighting the insurgents.
The condition of the reconcentrados
in Havana grows steadily worse. ThÂ»
Spaniards ask them when their Yan
kee benefactors are coming to relieve
them. The mortality is increasing
among this wretched class, which has
taken to begging for morsels of food.
Nobody in Havana except a few
higher officers knows that the Spanish
fleet was annihilated at Manila, and the
report is believed that the Americans
were beaten there. Blanco allows no

MORE VOLUNTEERS
WILL BE CALLED
CHICAGO, May 14. â A special from Washington to the News says:
"You can put it down that the President will issue another call for
100,000 volunteers within the next ten days," remarked Representative
Lewis this morning as he was leaving the White House. "I know that
this matter has been considered by the President and his Cabinet. The
Secretary of War, I understand, wanted the first call for .200,000 volun
teers, but it was considered best to divide the question and issue another
call later. At the time the first call was issued it was not contemplated
that we would take the Philippines and Porto Rico, and hence need
more volunteers."
favorable news to be circulated. It is
believed in Havana that the campaign
on the island will prove enormously fa
tal to the American troops and will be
prolonged a year.
Another account Is that food supplies
in Havana are good for a much less
time than four months, and that Blanco
is in a trap unless the Spanish fleet
breaks the blockade to allow supplies
to come in.
The Havana people continue light
hearted and the theaters put on pieces
ridiculing the American fleet.
MUTINY IN THE RANKS
OF NEVADA VOLUNTEERS.
Captain Wright of Reno Arrested
and Three Men Sent Back to
Their Homes.
CARSON, May 14.â Insubordination
broke out in the rank of the Nevada
volunteers and Captain Wright of Reno
was arrested this morning. Wright,
upon being sent to drill the men, called
an indignation meeting and protested
against the temporary officers appoint
ed by GoveYnor Sadler. A petition
signed by about seventy men, asking
the Governor that the company be per
mitted to select its own officers, is said
to have been headed off by Major Cox,
who is Sadler's appointee; hence the
meeting.
A number of men refused to accom
pany the troops unless the officers were
changed, but only three fell out of line
when Governor Sadler visited the camp
at 8:30 this morning. These three
were permitted to return to their
homes. The troops left to-night for
Cheyenne. Wyoming. A dispatch from
Congressman Newlands announced that
Nevada would, in all probability, be
permitted to furnish another troop of
cavalry or infantry.

TERRIFIC
FIGHT AT
CIENFUEGOS
American Sailors and Span
ish Soldiers Exchange
Shot and Shell.
The Loss of the Enemy Placed at
Four Hundredâ Our Loss Is
One Killed, Five Wounded.
KEY "UTEST, May 14.â Amid a ter
rific storm of shot from Spanish rifles
and batteries the American forces cut
the cable at Clenfuegos on Wednesday
morning. Four determined boat crews
under command of Lieutenant "Wlns
low and Ensign Magruder, from the
cruiser Marblehead and the gunboat
Nashville, put out from the ships, the
coast having previously been shelled.
The work of the volunteers was peril
ous. The cruiser Marblehead and the
gunboat Nashville and the auxiliary
cruiser Windom drew up 1000 yards
from shore with their guns manned,
ready for desperate duty.
One cable had already been cut and
the work was in progress on the other
when the Spaniards in rifle pits and
a battery in an old lighthouse standing
out in the bay opened fire. The war
ships poured in a thunderous volley,
their guns belching forth massive shells
into the swarms of the enemy. The
crews of the boats calmly proceeded
fvith their desperate work, notwith
standing the fact that a number had
fallen, and finished it, returning to the
ships through a blinding smoke and a
heavy fire.
One man In a Marblehead boat was
killed and six were seriously wounded,
one of whom, Robert Voltz, is now at
Key West and is expected to die before
morning, a bullet having passed
through the base of his brain. Harry
Hendrickson, who also may die, was
shot through the abdomen.
More than 1000 infantrymen on shore
kept up a continuous fire and the bul
lets from the machine guns struck the
warships a hundred times, but did no
great damage.
Commander Maynard, of the gunboat
Nashville, was slightly wounded by a
rifle buHet that, before striking him,
passed through the arm of an ensign
whose name is unknown. Lieutenant
Winslow was shot in the hand, making
thref officers wounded in all.
After all the Spaniards had been
driven from the rifle pits, many of them
took refuge in the lighthouse fortress,
upon which the fire of the ships had
been centered. A four-inch shell from
the Windom tore the structure to
pieces, killing many and burying others
in the ruins. The Spanish loss is known
to have been very heavy, the warships
firing hundreds of shots and shells into
their midst.
Captain Maguire of the Window be
lieves that several of the six badly
wounded men who were brought to Key
WW T est this morning on the Windom can
not recover.
Following is the list of killed and
badly wounded:
Killed:
PATRICK REGAN, seaman of the
Marblehead.
Badly wounded:
JOHN DAVIS of New York.
JOHN J. DORAN of Fall River,
Mass.
ERNEST STJNTENIC.
HERMAN W. KUCHNEISTER.

The Engagement Off Cienfuegos on Wednesday Which Attended the Cutting of the Cable by a De
tachment From the Nashville and Marblehead.
ROBERT VOLTZ, Caster County,
North Carolina, of the Nashville.
Soon after the arrival of the warships
off Cienfuegos four boats were launch
ed and proceeded in shore for the pur
pose of grappling for the cable in order
to cut it. The warships lay to about
1000 yards or more off the harbor.
It was observed that the Spanish
troops had assembled ashore, but it
was not known that heavy guns had
been placed in a masked battery, and
that the old lighthouse, far out on a
neck of land, had been transformed into
a formidable fort.
The small boats proceeded cautious
ly and for more than an hour worked
unmolested on the cable. Suddenly,
just as the work was about complet
ed, the shore battery fired a shell at
the boats. It was followed by others,
and the Spanish infantry opened fire
then with their rifles.
Then, like a flash, the Marblehead
sent a shell inland and followed it with
a perfect shower of shot. The NaÂ«h
LIEUT. FRANK E. NEWCOMB, COMMANDING U. S. S. HUDSON.
It was Lieutenant Newcomb's undaunted courage and timely action in
towing the torpedo-boat Winslow out of the range and heavy fire of the
Spanish gunboats and shore batteries of Cardenas that prevented her,
together with his own vessel, from falling into the hands of the enemy-
He was appointed a third lieutenant in the Revenue Cutter Service in 1873
from Massachusetts; promoted to second lieutenant in 1882, and advanced
to first lieutenant, his present rank, in 1891, at which time he was
assigned to the Rush at this port. In 1892 he servedkas executive officer
on the Corwin and in 1894, upon his expiration of duty on the Pacific,
was assigned as inspector of life-saving stations on the New England
coast. He was ordered to the command of the Hudson at New York in
June last.

vllle was quick to follow suit, and the
little Windom cut loose with her four
pounders.
In the meanwhile Spanish bullets fell
in every direction around the small
boats. Though the attack had come
suddenly and fiercely, the blue- jackets
were not dismayed, and protected by
the terrific return fire of the warships
work was continued and the cable cut.
When the boats returned to the ships
Reagan, who was in one of the Marble
head's boats, of whi,ch there were two,
was found to have been killed. Six
men were badly wounded.
The Spaniards had by this time suf
fered severe loss. Their shots from the
lighthouse struck the warships several
times, and, although they did not do
much damage, the fire aroused the de
termination of the American officers
to exterminate the fort. Thereafter,
for the while, the fire of the warships
was concentrated upon the lighthouse,
and the improvized fort was blown to
pieces. As there were great numbers
of Spaniards in and behind the fort at
the time, there is no doubt that many
of them were killed.
The Marblehead and the Nashville
used their heaviest guns, as well as
their small rapid-firing guns, and hun
dreds of shots were thrown into the
Spanish troops.
On board the ships a number of men
â¢were slightly wounded.
Commander Washburn Maynard at
the Nashville was slightly wounded by
a spent bullet.
When the commanders of the Marble
| head and the Nashville called for vol
i unteers to man the boats and cut the
i cable the men responded with a jump.
i Lieutenant "Winslow of the Nashville
i took command of the Nashville's boats.
j The shore surrounding the entrance of
the harbor was first shelled and the
I boats proceeded in. The cable was
i deep in the channel and was found with
difficulty. One of the relays of the ca
; ble had been cut when the Spaniards
opened fire.
The marines in the boats replied at
once and a machine gun from the for
ward launch sent in a stream of bullets,
! while heavy shells from the warships
drove the Spaniards from the rifle pit
at the shore, many of them seeking
refuge in the lighthouse fort, which
was afterward torn to pieces by a shell
I from the "Windom.
With desperate courage the American
sailors stuck to their posts and suc
ceeded in dragging up the second relay
of the cable and severing it. Seven men
badly wounded was the cost, and one
of them, Reagan, died while on the way

back to the ship. Lieutenant Winslow
was shot in the hand and a number of
others were more or less Injured.
On the Nashvilla Captain Maynard
was standing forward with an ensign
when a Spanish bullet passed through
the ensign's shoulder and struck May
nard on the chest, wounding him only
slightly. The Marblehead was struck
scores of times by bullets from machine
guns, and the Nashville suffered to
about the same extent. The Wlndom
also had many marks of the fray. Her
shell blowing up the lighthouse and
scattering the Spaniards in all direc
tions ended the battle.
Boltz and Hendricks, who with four
others of the wounded are at the naval
hospital here, are expected to die. The
remains of Reagan were buried at sea.

THE LIFE OF A WAN.
That is the one thing that we cling to most fondly. Even the man who believes
that he is so ill that he can never recover loves to live. But how much better it is
to enjoy life to the full extent than it is to get only half the pleasure that Provi-
dence intended should be yours. You remember with joy the happy days when you
were young and full of vigorous manhood. You remember with delight all the happy
times you had. Then you were full of fire, full of vigor, and the rich, warm blood went
bounding through your veins. And the same thing would be happening to-day had you
not been too free with the gifts of nature. Those who spoil good digestive powers by
and by find that they have none, and so it goes on through all of nature's functions.
Abuse brings weakness. It always does. You may stimulate tired nature for awhile,
but there is always that feeling of gloom, despondency and a knowledge that you are a
weak manâ and not a strong one. Just ask yourself for a moment: "Have I been
guilty of any follies either as a youth or as a man?" "Have I tired myself at any exer-
cise?" "Have I gone to excess in anything?" Answer the question to yourself with
truth. "Am I

torhoea, all wasting processes, all prematureness and all lack of vital force. It does not merely
cure some cases. It cures all. 20,000 men sing its praises loudly. Circulars and testimonials
about it are sent to you for the mere asking. It will not cost you a single copper to find out the
truth. If you are weak would it not be sensible to get strong? Remember that

Victims.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, May 14.â The steamer
Farallon arrived in port to-day from
the north, bringing the news of the re
ported drowning of "Swiftwater Bill"
Gates and three others of his party in
Lake Tagish. Later information was
received to-night on the steamship
Amur. The drowning is said to have
occurred at Skaguay on May 10. The
story is both confirmed and denied by
persons arriving from Lake Bennett,
and there is as yet an apparent uncer
tainty about the matter.
A young man named Moore arrived
in Skaguay on Tuesday over the White
trail, having left Bennett at noon the
day previous. He said that at the time
he left the lake a bulletin was posted
on the board maintained at the hotel
for the purpose of bulletining such
meager news as reaches the inside con
cerning the war, to the effect that the
reported drowning had been confirmed.
This notice gave the victims as Swift
water Bill, Dr. Wolf and two of the
girls who accompanied the party.
AnotherTeport which has not been
verified gave the name of one of the
girls as Miss Nellie La Moore, Gates'
sister-in-law.
The Dr. Wolf who . was with the
party when it left Skaguay is Dr. J.
H. M. Wolf of Salt Lake City.
J. C. Wilson of Seattle and J. M.
West of Tacoma, on their way out
from Dawson, left Lake Bennett at an
early hour on Monday morning, reach
ing Skaguay the following day over the
Dyea trail. They say the story was
being denied by the Canadian police
at both Bennett and the summit. They,
however, did not meet the party on
their way up to the lake, nor did they
see the bulletin that was posted at
Bennett at noon.
Messrs. Wilson and West left Daw
son on April 17, making the trip out
ij\ twenty-two days, with 510,000 in
gold. They report no later gold ex
citement than that at Monte Cristo
Island. At Walsh Creek every one is
building boats preparatory to going
down the river. The river from the
foot of Labarge to below the mouth of
the Hootalinqua or for a distance of
seventy miles is already open but full
of running ice. They report sufficient
provisions in Dawson to last till the
river opens.

BERLIN, May 14.â While there has '
been a marked change In the com
menta of the antl-Amerlcan press of |
Germany, there have been no changes j
In the opinions of the people, which j
continue to be most hostile to the i
United States, especially among the j
upper classes. An American lady who
married a German nobleman â both of i
them in close touch with the highest ;
society â said to a correspondent: "You
have no conception of the bitter feel-
Ing against America. It is Impossible ;
for me to go anywhere without hear- j
ing my country abused on all sides, j
We are accused of being a nation of j
hypocritical tradesmen who forced war i
with Spain with no other object than ;
that of financial gain."
The war news continues to arrive
here twelve Lours late, and the Lokal
Anzelger is the only Berlin paper with |
enterprise enough to get a few brief
specials from New York direct. When !
the reports arrived of the return of !
the Spanish fleet to Cadiz the news- j
papers emptied the vials of their !
wrath on their erstwhile proteges.
The Berlin Tageblatt editorially re- |
marked: "Without firing a single
shot this mysterious fleet has excited J
repeatedly panics In New York, and ;
has kept the whole American fleet in :
check. Admiral Sampson's blockading
fleet ceased to blockade, and Commo
dore Schley's flying squadron did not
fly, but lay as though hypnotized at
Hampton Roads dumbly awaiting the
uncanny fleet which has been at sea a i
week and a half, yet was nowhere
sighted. The nervousness of the Amer
icans gave rise to veritable hallucina
tions. However, the Spanish admiral
â sized that prudence was the bet
ter part of valor, and he returned to
Cadiz without having reduced New
York to ashes or swept the Yankees
from the ocean. The merchant traders :
and millionaires of Americamay there- ;
continue to tremble."
The exporters, who are greatly per
turbed at the serious losses which have
already resulted from the anti-Ameri
can tone of the press, which losses are
reported to-day to have already
amounted to several million marks,
as they threaten to be followed by a
permanent transfer of orders to a
friendlier nation, are making strenu
ous efforts to curb the newspapers. The
semi-official communications made by
tho Government of Germany, protest
ing that Germany is friendly to Amer
ica, may be accorded due recognition
in Government circles, but unfriendli
ness toward the United States means
loss of trade.
Baron yon Bulow, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, has reiterated to
United States Embassador White Ger
many's intention to observe neutrality
during the war. He explained that
the absence of a formal declaration on
the part of Germany was simply due
to the fart that Germany is not In the
habit of making such declarations, even
in the case of wara which are more
important to her Interests than the
prespnt. like the Russo-Turklsh and
('hi no- Japanese wars.
The newspapers here are discussing
the probability of national Spanish
bankruptcy. The Papal Nuncios of
Munich and Berlin have had several
interviews with Baron yon Bulow and
Prince Hohenlohe. the Imperial Chan
cellor, with the view of trying to bring
about the intervention of Germany in
the war between Spain and the United
States. The answers they have re
reived are in substance that Germany
does not deem the time ripe for inter
vention.
The proposition of the Russian and j
German newspapers to make Europe i
independent of America for grain sup
plies by the establishment of state
granaries is being discussed. The Gov
ernment press holds there are no means !
to accomplish the scheme, and that j
KiiPFia especially Is unable to supply \
the deficiency. It is further pointed ]
out that there was a famine in Russia
in 1891, and it is added that famine at
the present time is threatening many
districts of Russia.
The officials of the German Foreign j
Office are watching events in the Phil- '
ippine Islands in the closest manner |
possible. German subjects at Manila j
have already filed claims for damages
against the United States, but the For
eign Office here says they must await :
the conclusion of the war before any- i
thing can be done in the matter. It is
said, however, that the Geri.in admiral
commanding the far East has been
empowered in case of riots at Manila
to land troops to protect the German
consulate and the German residents of
that place.
Emperor William at Metz has receiv
ed in audience General Count yon Hun
s' en-Ladenburg, the German Embas
i ador to France, who furnished his Ma-
Jesty with reports on the subject of
vpnrh election sentiment and on
the Hispano-American war feeling.
The Emperor is elated at the recep
tion h" has mot with at Metz. Even
the o]<i French families participated in
rchlight processions in his honor.
Prince Henry of Prussia has been ac-
I a l.rilliant official reception at
Peking. A very large crowd of people
witnessed the Prince's arrival by a
l train. His Royal Highness pro
1â  â¢ ded to the German legation. A long
of official and private entertain
ments had been arranged.
The fact that the lower house of the
Diet pa^s..i without debate the third
reading of the bill subjecting univer
sity lectures to the control of the Minis
try of Education has aroused fears of
interference with the rights of pub- i
lie meeting an<l political association,
and has also given rise to renewed ru
mors that a measure is being prepared
to modify or restrict universal suffrage.
The semi-official denials on this sub
ject have been received with skepti
cism. In the event of the approaching
elections resulting in considerable ac
cession to the ranks of the. Conserva
tives and National Liberals there is no
doubt there will be Rr e a t pressure
brought to bear on the Government to
alter the condition of affairs

A SERIOUS MATTER.
NT OTWITHSTANDING the allegation of the
Third Street Boodler (late of Mission street)
' that all disposition to inquire into the financial
system of the proposed new charter is inspired by the
sugar trust, C. P. Huntington, the water, gas and
street railway corporations, we are constrained to ob
berve that unless figures are doing considerable tall
lying about now there is something wrong with the
document. Auditor Broderick and Expert Williams
of the Supervisors' Finance Committee have both fig
ured out a deficit under the proposed dollar limit.
There is no material difference between the results of
thtir investigations. Broderick's estimated deficit is
$1,121,788, and that of Williams $950,000. Had the lat
ter added the probable shortage this year ($100,000), as
Broderick did, the totals would have been as near
alike as two peas.
It is no answer tc these figures to say that the offi
cials who produced them are allies of the sugar trust
and opposed to good government. That sort of ar
gument is unworthy even of the Third Street Boodler
(late of Mission street) â an organ which for down
right mental vapidity has long held the championship
of the Pacific Coast. If a fair and honest analysis of
the financial system proposed to be adopted by the
new charter will yield any different result than has
been produced by Broderick and Williams, why not
order the analysis made and publish it? The fact
that this is not done goes far to establish the truth of
the allegation that the charter if adopted will impose
upon the city a system of deficits certain to result in
great loss and damage.
The purpose of The Call in publishing the estimates
of Auditor Broderick and Expert Williams has not
been to raise any false issue in connection with the
proposed charter. We have merely desired to place
before our readers the truth concerning a very impor
tant matter. If the charter makers have devised a
faulty system of finance their work should be rejected.
Indeed, as good citizens, not only they, but the Mer
chants' Association, which is supporting their char
ter, should be the first to agree with us on this point.
Even if they consider the Czar Mayor a desirable ac
quisition and centralization a desideratum devoutly to
be wished, they cannot honestly urge that a hotch
potch financial system will be a good thing for the
city.
The first duty of a municipality is to meet its ob
ligations promptly. In order to do this the power to
levy and collect a sufficient amount of money in taxes
ought to be clear and easily understood. The charter
has fixed a limit on taxation, which is an excellent
thing. But it establishes expenditures far in excess
of the limit, and thus itself opens the way to financial
confusion. The figures prepared by the Auditor and
Expert Williams should be met by facts, not silly
charges of improper motives. The matter is too se
rious to be treated in the manner familiar to politi
cians, demagogues and boodle newspapers.
Commodore Schley displayed the proper spirit
when he set off in quest of a fight, remarking that in
action was killing him. But several brave men of the
navy have already been killed in action. The former
may be harder to endure, but the latter is more deadly.
A writer in an evening paper professes to wonder
what the volunteers think they have enlisted for. But
as he is a gentleman of intelligence hi; profession
must be regarded as a joke, and not a particularly
bright one.
The Spanish fleet seems to have a facility for being
in several places at once. Evans and Sontag once
held the record for this sort of business, Dunham tried
it with fair success, but the Spanish outclass them all.
Rochefort's suggestion that Spain and Italy be
come republics and form an alliance with France will
probably not be acted on, and it would not be much
of an alliance, anyway.
The mob which feels impelled by hunger to burn
a storehouse filled with food needs something in its
head as well as in its stomach.
Admiral Montijo of the late Manila fleet is a brave
man, for Dewey has said so, and anything Dewey
says goes in this country.
Information comes that hundreds of Spaniaid9 have
been killed, but It does not come by way of Blanco's
typewriter.
There seems no possibility of beating into the head
of a Spaniard a knowledge of the fact that ho has been
Ucked
YELLOW MORALITY.
IF a man who is admitted into decent company re
port therein a conversation with another upon mat
ters of serious personal importance or of public in
terest and it turn out that no such conversation oc
curred he is called, known, branded and posted as a
liar. If he persist in reporting things that never hap
pened and conversations never had he runs the risk
of condign punishment It is safe to say that no gen
tleman would speak to such a man and no lady would
toUrate his presence. He would be without influence,
and men would prefer his enmity to his friendship, his
blame to his praise.
Will some one tell us the difference between the
man who offends against truth and decency by word
of mouth and one who commits the same offense in I
cold type and persists in it, using a newspaper as his j
medium? What difference is there between William R.
Hearst telling all who will hear him of a conversation
with the Pope, in which that august person treated
issues of the greatest gravity with undiplomatic
brusqueness, when he had not seen the Pope at all, j
and William R. Hearst publishing such an interview
with the Pope that never occurred and was promptly
denied by the Pope himself?
Again, if William R. Hearst should boast of an in
terview with the Queen Regent of Spain, in which
she talked of the most delicate matters pertaining to
her kingdom and her people, and he should vaunt
himself upon his enterprise and influence in being
able exclusively to enter her seclusion and get such
an interview and it turned out that he had never seen
the Queen Regent at all, and that the tale was a lie
from beginning to end, what gentleman or lady would
recognize him again? Can any one suggest any dif
ference between his telling of such an interview and
printing it in the Journal and Examiner when it
never took place and was a lie, made out of whole
cloth?
If William R. Hearst go among others and tell of
a conversation with the wife of the President of the
United States and it turn out that he had never met
the lady and that no such conversation had been had
with her, it would be the verdict of every gentleman
that he should be kicked out of decent company as a
liar and a poltroon.
Now all of these things have been done by William
R. Hearst. Through the Examiner he has boasted
of interviews with the Pope, the Queen Regent and
Mrs. McKinley, and has published' the same in de
tail, putting words into the mouth of the Pope, the
Queen and the President's wife when no such inter
views ever occurred.
Will some one here speak for him and tell us why
and how such conduct differs when its medium is a
newspaper from the same course by word of mouth?
When Mr. Hearst says in his paper that his "com
missioner" interviewed the Pope, Queen or Presi
dent's wife, knowing that such things never happened,
it seems that he has no defense. He pretends to state
as a fact that which he knows is not a fact. It is not
like printing a rumor of outside origin. It is a pre
tense'that he ordered his personal representative to
meet face to face these three persons, the Pope, the j
Queen and President's wife, and receive from them
an expression of their views upon the issues between
the United States and Spain, and that such order was
executed, and that it was evidence of his enterprise
and power, when such order was never given and
never executed, and he knew that they were not.
His offense is a deception of his readers and is ly
ing of the most serious kind. The Pope's Secretary
of State, Rampolla, at once denounced it. The Presi
dent, through his private secretary, has denied the in
terview with Mrs. McKinley. and it is known as posi
tively that the Queen Regent never met any repre
sentative of Hearst nor gave any interview.
Now what a perverted mind it must be that can
parade these three gross offenses, these three out
rageous lies, and boast of them as journalistic enter
prise!
If Hearst had told them by word of mouth his coat
tails would have been frayed by the deserved kicks
of every gentleman who could get within leg reach
of him. Why is he entitled to any more consideration
because his lies are in print?
THE ARMY APPOINTMENTS.
WITHIN a week after the passage of the bill
creating the Volunteer Army it was reported
from Washington that upward of one hundred
applications had been made for every office in it at
the disposal of the President. Later information is to
the effect that applications for staff appointments ex
ceed 10,000.
A large number of the would-be staff officers did not
even take the trouble to read the bill under which the
army is constituted, for while the bill expressly pro
vides that the staff officers for the corps, divisions
and brigade commanders are to be appointed by the
President, many of the applicants sent their requests
to the generals selected as commanders. It is said
that Fitzhugh Lee could form a full regiment from the
men who applied to him for staff positions.
A considerable number of these applications were
backed by more or less Congressional strength. Sen
ators and Congressmen in a good many instances
seem to have looked upon the Volunteer Army as a
field for obtaining patronage for political supporters.
"Prominent statesmen" were recommended to com
mand a brigade or division who could not fitly com
mand a squad. The army was in danger of being
officered by politicians rather than by soldiers, and
sent to war under the direction of men who were
more desirous of winning a personal reputation for
themselves to use in politics than to win victories for
the nation.
From that fate the army and the country have been
saved by the sagacity and firm patriotism of the Presi
dent. The Volunteer Army will be commanded by
men who have had either military training or a large
military experience during the war. The command
ing generals have both. Politics has played no part
in the selection of the officers. Sectional divisions of
the Union have been recognized only so far as was
just and right in order that men from all parts of our
wide republic might go to the field under the com
mand of men in whom they have the confidence born
of local knowledge of their ability and their heroism.
The people at large have reason to be thankful that
the President has had the firmness to resist political
pressure for the appointment of untried and possibly
incompetent men to command, and the boys who
have enlisted have still more reason. The Volunteer
regiments, full of courage but without experience in
actual war, would have been heavily handicapped in
fighting even a weak foe if commanded by men who
at critical moments would have lacked the knowledge
of What to do or the nerve to accept the responsibility
and act with vigror without hesitation.
President McKinley has been himself a soldier and
has had experience with commanders. He knows the
kind the nation needs and the army requires and has
had the courage to appoint that kind notwithstanding
the clamors of the ten thousand applicants for staff
anoointments and their urgent frienda in Congress.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
THE LIVING AND THE DYING NATIONS.
ADDRESSING his constituents at Birmingham
on Friday evening the Honorable Joseph
Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colo
nies, began by saying that he intended to make a
plain statement of facts concerning international
affairs and the policy of Great Britain, and that with
out revealing secret negotiations he would speak
"unfettered by the mysteries and reticences of dip
lomacy," so as to be clearly understood by the people.
With this prelude he declared the policy of the Sal
isbury Ministry is to preserve for Great Britain an
isolation from European alliances and to seek for such
strength as might be needed in addition to her own,
to withstand the Continental combinations against
her, by drawing all parts of the empire into close
unity and maintaining the bonds of permanent friend
ship with the United States. With a burst of im
passioned eloquence he added:
"Across the Atlantic is a powerful and generous
nation, using our language, bred of our race and hav
ing interests identical with ours. I would go so far
as to say that, terrible as war may be, even war it
self would be cheaply purchased if in a great and noble
cause the 6tars and stripes and the union jack should
wave together over an Anglo-Saxon alliance."
This frank statement of the policy which Great
Britain intends to pursue will recall attention to the
recent declaration of Lord Salisbury' before the Prim
rose League in a speech which was almost aa frank as
that of Chamberlain. Salisbury attributed the present
crisis in international affairs to a change that is now
going on in the conditions of the nations. The weak
states, he said, are growing weaker, and the strong
ones growing stronger, so that, to use his epigram
matic phrase, "the nations of the earth may be divided
into two classes â the living and the dying."
The seeds of conflict, he declared, are inseparable
from a dying nation. Strife cannot be avoided in com
munities where both the Government and the manhood
of the race are decaying. Nor can strong races stand
aloof from these conflicts when the strife approaches
the border of the land occupied by the strong. As the
decay goes on and the civil disturbances among the
dying nations increase, the living, growing powers
must necessarily assume a larger responsibility in the
government of the world.
Had Salisbury spoken merely as a philosophical
student of politics he would in all probability have
named the living nations and the dying ones, but as
he is Prime Minister of Great Britain and has upon
him the responsibilities of office, he did not venture
so far. To the intelligent observer of the world's
affairs, "however, it will be easy to supply the names.
We know that China, Turkey and Spain are decad
ent nations. We know that Great Britain, Russia,
Germany, and above all the United States, are living
and growing nations. The seeds of conflict insepar
able from the dying cause conflicts among the strong.
Which of the living nations is it that is to assume or
have forced upon it the largest share of responsibility
for the government of the world?
Our own experience affords an illustration of the
truth of Salisbury's words. The decadence of Spain
by producing conflict in Cuba has forced upon us a
war which will leave on our hands large possessions
and a consequent responsibility for their government.
Under such circumstances we will be compelled to
give more than a passing consideration to the British
offer of lasting friendship and possible alliance. We
cannot stand aloof from the dying rations. We
must face the inevitable crisis brought about by their
decay. The responsibility is already upon us. and
when the time comes for us to determine what shall
be done with the Philippines we shall have to decide
the question of what part we are to take in the larger
politics of the world.
ThE TONNAGE TAX.
WHILE the Democrats and the Populists of
Congress have attacked the war revenue bill
mainly because of the provision of a bond is
sue, a different set of antagonists in the commercial
cities of the East are directing their efforts toward the
elimination from the bill of the clause imposing an
increased tonnage tax on shipping.
According to the arguments of this class of oppo
nents the effect of the tonnage tax will be to obstruct
commerce rather than to increase the revenue to any
great extent. The Boston Herald says it is question
able whether the tax would yield as much as $2,500,
000 a year, while it is fairly certain it would tend to
increase shipments of wheat, pork and other West
ern produce from Canadian ports and diminish
those from our own ports. The New York Times
takes much the same view of the probable effects of
the tax. It declares the increased duty will be particu
larly vexatious to those who have to pay it, and thus
to some extent drive commerce from our shores with
out yielding any adequate recompense for the loss.
These arguments will have the more weight because
at this time the urgent need of the country is a widely
extended commerce. We produce in almost all kinds
of staple crops more than we can consume and require
foreign markets for the surplus. It is clearly, there
fore, to our interest to extend commerce rather than
to obstruct it, and if the proposed tonnage tax is to
have the effects calculated by the commercial interests
of New York and Boston it would be well to have the
revenue bill amended in that respect.
It has been said of old, however, that good argu
ments must give way to better. In this case it seems
that the better arguments are on the side of the
framers of the revenue bill who proposed this among
other taxes to raise a war revenue for the nation.
During the debate on the bill in the House Mr. Ding
ley pointed out that the increased tonnage tax would
be no higher than that imposed by France, and but
slightly higher than that imposed by Great Britain.
It is not calculated, therefore, to be so onerous as the
people of New York and Boston think, and conse
quently not so likely to drive trade away from us as
they fear.
Another point made by Chairman Dingley is of the
highest importance. He directed attention to the fact
that nine-tenths of the vessels engaged in the ocean
carrying trade from ports of the United States are of
foreign ownership, and that if the war continues very
long it is probable all of them will be. The proposed
tax is therefore a tax on foreign shipping and will
tend to promote the building of American ships. This
consideration had great weight with Congress and will
have an equal effect with the people.
The nation is at war and must raise a large revenue
to defray the cost. All parts of the country must bear
their share of it, and the commercial cities of the East
ought not to complain of the burdens which the pro
posed increase in tonnage duties will place upon their
interests. Moreover, as the foreigner gains by carry
ing American goods across the ocean, he might as
well pay his share of carrying on the war.
Spanish efforts to approach the insurgents with
friendly overtures do not seem wholly successful, the
response generally heing a volley. The jpanish them
selves taught the Cubans the habit of disregarding a
flag- of truce*
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
It Is a standing problem why the fact
that a girl is going on the stage should
be considered of enough importance to
warrant the printing of her picture and
pedigree. I cannot see wherein it is of
the slightest moment to anybody but
herself whether she goes on the stage,
gets a Job as typewriter, learns how to
trim hats or becomes what is known in
commercial circles as a saleslady. If
there is one calling a girl can choose
in which such talent as she may pos
sess will almost to a certainty be wast
ed, it is the calling of the actress. The
life is a shallow mockery, an existence
of tinsel and pretense, carried on in
an atmosphere of scandal. It involves
no opportunity for a home, but scant
opportunity for fame, and the chance
to retain such reputation as one may
take into it is painfully slight. I feel
sorry for any girl who adopts the stage.
Unless she is a genius there is every
probability that she will never be heard
of again except as the figure in some
unsavory episode. If she is a genius
she may rise to the position of a Bern
hardt, in whom much can be forgiven.
But it must be remembered that the
children of a Bernhardt do not have the
privilege of speaking of their father,
and, Indeed, may be unable to speak
with any certainty.
There Is no particular reason why
this city should provide an orphanage
for homeless monkeys, and certainly
none why a large tract of land should
be purchased for a site. Some people
may have noticed that out toward the
Cliff House there Is a beautiful and
spacious park. This Is free to all. It
has been Improved at great expense,
but the Improvement will inevitably go
on for many years. If the monkey must
be provided for, Golden Gate Park is
the place for him. There a secluded
valley could be set apart for him, and
the taxpayers with tolerable grace sub
mit to contributing toward his board
and lodging, but to be asked to "pungle
up" for the support of a lot of fellows
with some realty of which they have
been unable to dispose In a legitimate
way touches them In a different spot.
I object to President Jordan as an au
thority, because he does not live here.
I object to Superintendent McLaren's
dictum, because McLaren does not
want a "zoo" in the park he so ably
engineers to a state of verdure and
bloom. He dislikes the presence of the
animals now there, and they are not
given proper attention. If of a hardy
family they thrive tolerably, and if not
hardy they die. Even the grizzly which
Hearst unloaded on the park after he
found him unavailable as a member of
the staff had to be located in the park
by a trick. It Is far better that San
Francisco should have no "zoo" than
that It be established through fraud in
a section of the city reached with diffi
culty from every other section. it
would be far wiser to use the money in
prosecuting the Supervisors who are
trying to loot the treasury of what
Widber missed. To have a batch of
them in a cage would be somethins like.
Reports that Fitzsimmons is to. fight
a bull In a ring at Havana doubtless
represent a silly attempt ro revivify
the unpleasant remains of the notoriety
won by a blow in the eolar plexus of
another of the pestiferous tribe. I wish
it were possible to believe the report,
and that the bull might toss Fitzsim
mons up with one horn, catch him on
the other and finish an interesting per
formance by planting a triumphant
hoof so as to double the diaphragm of
the pugilist into a mortal kink. I have
nothing against Fitsimmons person
ally, never saw him, never want to, but
he is one of a class that cumbers the
earth.
â¢ â¢
For Just fifteen minutes I would like
to be President of the United States.
This period would be sufficient for the
formulation of a message to the war
lorder of all the earth. I think it
would be possible to convey to him in
language at once diplomatic and
forceful information that his royal
nose, as often before, is being poked
where it has no business. He would be
told that we are competent to take
care of our own affairs, that he tiSM no
more voice as to the disposition of the
Philippines than in settling an elec
tion contest between two Congress
men from the Podunk district. If he
does not like our style he must en
dure it as patiently as he may, for we
are too busy to change it to please
him, and don't particularly care to
suit him, anyhow. Having done this,
I would cheerfully resign and let Mc-
Kinley go right on with the war, as
he seems to have the hang of it.
*. â¢ â¢
The fact appears that Widber in
tends to make a technical fight. In
other words, he confesses to being a
thief, but defies the people to do any
thing about it. I think that in the
event of his securing his freedom on
any such plea there could arise no
question as to the justice and advisa
bility of organizing a vigilance com
mittee and hanging him.
An actress who is attracting gTeat
crowds in New York does so by the
simple process of undressing on the
sta#e. Of course no respectable nor
decent woman would do this. lam not
attempting to lay down any moral
law, but must confess to a feeling of
irritation that one woman is sent by
the police to a certain quarter of the
town where the public may not be
shocked at the sight of her, while her
sister in degradation disports in the
glare of the footlights, and the public
tumbles over itself in the effort to be
shocked. It is not a fair deal.
There has been on exhibition In this

whose forbears were probably wild,

antiquity, camels with real humps and
a colony of lousy monkeys who skip

distress them. Their superior intelli
gence Is tried by the presence of zoo

been cowed to a state of absolute

a cruelty for which there can be no
excuse. Anybody can chuck dogs and

nothing admirable in the act, and that
the resulting exhibition of suffering is
not worth the price of admission.
Some German scientist has been fig
uring with infinite pains the amount of
food consumed by a man during a life
of seventy years. He has calculated
how big a loaf would be constituted
had all the loaves eaten been combined
in one, how great would have been the
size of the aggregate potato; he has
even branched from the main topic and
studied out the dimensions of the cigar
that might have been built of all the
many cigars burned during the jour
ney through this vale of tears. Such
statistics are always interesting to me.
They show how a person with the abil
ity to think, to grasp a pencil, and ac
tually to make characters on a piece
of paper can, after all, be a fool frit
tering his existence away and devoting
all his time to boring his fellow men.
Most of the weekly papers of the
East are patriotic. Truth Is doing va
liant service for its country. I regret
to say that Life is not. I regret it be
cause it has always had an element of
brightness about it. Its jokes for the
most part have not been borrowed.
While it devotes Itself to the lighter
side of existence it is serviceable in
whiling a moment away. In discuss
ing the serious business of war it is a !
sneering traitor with too little courage â¢
to say that it favors Spain. All it j
dares do is to gibe at love for the flag, j
disparage by innuendo the efforts of the j
administration and of the brave volun
teers who are going out to battle. It
deserves to be suppressed, not by spe- j
cific act, but by the method of being j
let alone.

I observe that the Rev. Dille objects
vigorously to the ladies of the Fabiola
Society accepting money from the man- j
agers of the racetrack. It seems to j
me he is wrong. Even if the racetrack j
people are to be considered as directly
representing the powers of darkness,
their money, once in the hands of the
upright, is very like any other money.
If not taken by the Fabiola it might ]
go into channels tending to the promo- j
tion of evil. I think the ladies should J
take all the racetrack money they can j
get and regard the operation as forag- i
ing on the enemy. The Dille position |
is weakened also by having acquired
the active support of the Rev. Steb- i
bins.

There has been a shameful negligence
in the reception of the soldiers in San
Francisco, It must be said that this
is no fault of the citizens. Their
hearts warm toward the volunteers. (*( *
They respect them for their quick pa
triotism and for their courage and sac- j
rifice. They are doing all they can to
add to the comfort of the boys now ;
in acmp 'at the Presidio. Their I
greatest worry is that they can do so
little. But when a battalion from x
sister State lands at the wharf and iÂ»
not met by somebody officially qualified i
to lead it to its quarters, when the
man in charge is obliged to ask hi*
way, the indignity is inexcusable. The |
Oregon lads, big, brave fellows, came :
as the sworn and mustered-in soldiers :
of Uncle Sam. Surely there must bs ;
an official amenable to rebuke for the
neglect of them. They enlisted to j
tight, not as martyrs. If Uncle Sam |
cannot care for his men in this city. ,
where he is supposed to have store*. ;
where there are thousands of mer- ;
chants with goods to sell, and where .
his credit is ample for anything he
wants, the promise is he will make a
pretty mess of it when he gets them
six thousand miles from anywhere in
the land of a hostile and well-armed
foe.

The world has never known a more
important catastrophe than that which :
wrecked the Maine. It caused the loss ,
of but 266 men, for the most part of
humble origin, the sinking of a yes- ;
sel valued at a few millions. Buc, I
had almost said, it changed the destiny ;
of the world. Nothing changes the
destiny of the world. Events may roll
aside the curtain revealing the fate
which from the beginning had been
written. This explosion was such an
event. Now the mind's eye can see
that which had been hidden. It can see ;
thrcmes ready to fall, dynasties about
to pass away. It can see a young
giant among nations just realizing its
own strength. It perceives a new fear
in the face of royalty. That when the
Maine went down it carried with it
principalities and peoples no prophet is
needed to tell. The tragedy was but
a link in a chain of circumstances, a
brief chapter in an Almighty plan. I
would like to see a monument to the
men of the Maine. Where they sleep
now on an alien shore a great shaft
should arise to show that Americans
flo not forget their dead. But islands
wrested from the treacherous Span
iard will be a grander monument, and
in the thunder of guns there is eulogy.
With no desire to embarrass the ad
min iteration I wish to go on record as
opposing the appointment of Russell
Harrison to be a major. Young Harri
son is more varieties of foolishness
than ever on exhibition under one hat
until he pranced into the subdued light
reflected frcm the fiercer beam which
necessarily beats upon a white house.
He did more to make a joke of his
father's administration than would !
have been thought possible. He talks :
with all the volubility of a parrot and
the judgment of a Burchard. Perhaps
he could meet the requirements of a
drummer boy's position, but I doubt
it. As soon as he ascertained that he ;
could not rise vocally above the clamor i
of the drum, he would either puncture
Urn instrument, or retiring sulking to
his tent, let the army of the nation go
to smash.

Brother-in-law Bird is in the em
barrassing position of being accused
by Frank Belew of having guilty
knowledge of the murders for which
Belew is shortly to be hanged. The ;
possibility that the prisoner is lying j
must of course be recognized, for men j
do stand on the gallows' trap and lie
reason to feel proud of himself. A man
who will betray fen Â«ftA>de*r tl the law,
the offender being a relative and the
betrayal long delayed, and then claim
the reward, is not the style of man
who inspires confidence. At least ha

J. F. J. ArchibaJd Is to be congratu
lated. He received the first battle
wound inflicted upon an American in
Cuba, It was seric-us enough to be
worth mentioning, and yet not serious
enough to tie a rag around. Mr. Archi
bald was known to possess the ele
ments of the soldier. No one more
bravely than he ever chased across the
Sausallto hills the wild and untamable
aniseseed bag. He was always In at;
the death, and the fiercest aniseseed
bag ever cornered gnashed its teeth
vainly at him. No sign of terror was
excited within his breast, and, without
a pang, as calm as a May morning, he
looked upon a tear in his trousers and
laughed it aside as a mere trifle. More
over, he Is a good fellow, devoid of pre
tense, as little afraid of a Spaniard as
of the game infesting the environs of
San Rafael. I hope he will get back
with no worse hurt and with several
notches in his rifle.
A FREEHOLDER ON TEACHERS'
SALARIES.
To the Editor of The Call: "With ref

I arles:
Firstâ Section 9, chapter 3, article VII

aries shall be limited to this amount. If
it were argued that salaries must be kept;
within this limit because $28 per pupil is
set aside to be used for salary purposes
only, it might with equal force be argued
that no salaries could be paid at present
because nothing is required to be set
aside for that purpose.

The statement of Mr. Williams asserts:

No More Red-Tape Delay-Troops
From the North-Rain in

Something has happened In Wash
ington, and it is about time for the
happening. Either Secretary of War
Alger or Major-General Miles is finally
conscious of the fact that there has
been a battle at Manila and that Ad-
RECEPTION TO CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS.
Heroes of the Nation Honor the Occasion hu Their Presence.
The reception to the officers of the California Volunteers by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion at the
Officers' Club of the Fresidio, yesterday afternoon, brought together many of the old heroes of the nation. There
were veterans of th* Mexican war and veterans of the war of the rebellion. The regular army was represented by
nearly all of the officers stationed a: the various posts In San Francisco harbor.
Colonel John C. Currier, vice-commander of the Legion, in an address, interspersed with outbursts of patriotic
sentiment, welcomed the g occasion, and Introduced General W. EL L. Barnes, who delivered a most
stirring oration, saying, in part:
This war marks a new era. an alllan a between the English-speaking nations of the world. It means the building and open
ing of the N anal. This war will build the Nicaragua canal as surely as the war of the Rebellion built the great
bands of steel that connect New York and San Francisco, the great transcontinental lines that enable us to ship to our coasts
the troops that go to fipht our battles enabling us to protect this broad nation as it looks on both sMes of the seas.
Th- European powers have cl 1 the earth; they have spread their civilization in China and in India and on all sides
they ha\e begun a threatening . nt upon our shores. The previous speaker has spoken of keeping our flag afloat in the
Philippine? and keeping It th and I want to add that I am in favor of this. I am asked, "Do you wish to make
this a colonizing nation?" and :; ally say "Yes"." For the first time since the birth of this great nation the troops of
the repubi: v: shores and wherever the American flag is placed there let it wave:
This war is but the beginning; there will be intervention, and there will be armed Intervention, and there will follow a
erenoral mix-up. This war is the sol it: >n of a great problem and we are bound to win and this we know: It will never be
said that a nation of sixteen millions, two-thirds of which can neither read nor write, whose highest ambition Is to eat garlio
and a: 1 right, can ever conquer a nation of seventy-five million freemen!
Whether under c tT pic sun or under the pole, I know the young army of the republic will do It* duty and that it will
always be an i. â¢ Btarry flag. We who are not allowed to go, who are by physical disability or age compelled to stay
at borne How a younger Renerati .n to vindicate the honor and majesty of our flag.
In the days to o :vM be won from the very stars themselves, when advancement and science shall bring
Into play in- forces of natur . ements, and when chaos reigns in the shoe* of worlds in combat, the last flag to float
among the stars themselves above markind shall be the Stars and Stripes.
Oh. Hod of Battles', if there is a God of Battles, as there is a God of Peace, come to his aid and glvo long, loving com
fort and lasting peace to him who dies on behalf o: his native land!
After the conclusion of General Barnes' oration. Colonel W. R. Smedberg, acting as master of ceremonies, re
quested that before dispersing the assemblage join in singing a patriotic song, entitled "Don't You Forget We Have
a Navy." which was i [to with a will
By the courtesj Louis T. Morris commander of the post, the band of the Third Artillery and that of
the Fourteenth Infantry f\ msic for the occasion. Colonel Morris also kindly furnished transportation to
and from the ears to all of the participants in the happy event, which will ever remain as a pleasing remembrance
In the hearts of the officers of the California Volunteers.
The commissioned officers of the t alifomia and Oregon Volunteers, and also the officers of the Fourteenth
United States Infantry, paid a visit to the clubrooma during the afternoon and were cordially greeted by the companions
of the Loyal Legion. The reception wa.' a great success.
niral Dewey. who gained a great vic
ory on the sea, is patiently awaiting
he arrival of a land force to co-oper
ite with his sailors. At this dists
!rom Washington one can hardly tell
rho Is commanding the army. Per
laps Aiger is at the head of affairs
o-day and Miles is admiring himself.
t may transpire that Miles is in com
nand to-day and Alger is doing th?
.ct of self-adoration. Miles is obvious
y Imbued with the idea that he ought
o go to the front himself, but is not
luite satisfied with the thought of
saving the defenses of Washington to
he care of Alger. Again it must per
ilex Miles and be equally perplexing to
llger and the Board of Strategy to de
ermlne whether the front is Manila
ir Havana.
While the Board of Strategy is pon
fering, -while Miles is pluming and
fhile Alger is bossing, the work of or
ganizing the Manila . expedition lags.
Ihips carrying re-enforcements to Ad
niral Dewey ought to be steaming to- |
card the Philippines, but not a single j
hip- is ready to sail, and The Call is '
nlormed by an officer high in author
ty that none can sail before next Sat- j
â¢.rday. The Charleston may get away j
ooner and do something to break the '
aonotony of waiting.
Yesterday the Washington authori- I
tes got "move on -" Man >' messages
ame over the wire to the command
nrnf a ener^l of the De Partment of Call- j
orn a. The particular organizations
or < the â¦ expedition to Manila were
* at s Among other commands
mentioned was the First Regiment of !
alifornia, United States Volunteer In- j
antry The squadron of the Fourth '
nited States Cavalry, the Fourteenth
inlted States Infantry and the Third
rtjllery were also designated.
The dispatches from Washington
lention to-morrow as the day of sail
ag. It is not possible to put the ships
i shape for the troops by that time,
ut the fact that a day has been ap- I
ranted signifies that Miles and Alger
tve heard of Manila: If plain, com
lon-sense, business methods could
aye been introduced into the direc
pn of army affairs and a few kinks
â¢ red tape been eliminated the ships
"PUld be ready now. The Call under
st&nds that military movements must
be made in a military' manner with
due regard to army regulations, but it
does seem odd that while advancement
and the acceptance of new and Im
proved methods are recognized in
every other branch of the Government
the army should cling to obsolete forms.
The mustering officer of the Califor
nia volunteers waited five days for the
mail to bring blanks from Washington
before the troops could be mustered in.
The form might have been transmitted
by wire and the blanks printed here by
any printing office in town, but the
mustering officer had to wait to get by
mail the' particular packages bound by
the particular strips of official red
tape.
The same sort of delay haÃ been the
rule in the engagement and refitting or
ships for the Manila expedition. If a
man with a genius for organization
were at the head of affairs in Wash
ington practical, common sense meth
ods would take the place of obsolete
forms. Th*Â» best men make mistakes
and the greatest military leaders oc
casionally make a bad move, but com
mon sonse comes to the rescue to rec
tify errors. The progress of battle fre
quently uVmands revision of the whole
plan of operation. It is plain enough
now that some one In Washington,
f-ither Miles or Alger, or both, made a
great mistake, if not a blunder, when
the First Regiment of United States In
fantry and tie two light batteries of
the Third Artillery were sent away
from Pan Francisco to the Gulf coast.
When thÂ« troops were going it was
known in Washington that the fleet un
der the command of Admlrai Deney
bad been directed to move on ManUa.
but no one spems to have had the head
to estimate that troops might be needed
at the Philippines and that S.an Fran
clsco was the natural point of embark-
It to gratifying to note at this late
date that the authorities in Washing
ton are beginning to size up the situ
ation at the Philippines. An extra
rush might get some of the troops on
the way to Admiral Dewey by next
Thursday or Friday.
Significant dispatches were received
at the Presidio yesterday. The officers
who were advised by wire from Wash
ton to buy horses for the Utah Ligh*
Batteries were instructed by telegraph
last evening to suspend purchases. The
indications are that the Fourth Cavalry
will go to Manila without their horses,
but the troopers can fight as readily on
foot as on horseback. It is not known
at present how many batteries of the
Third Artillery will be sent away. Men
of the best military Judgment believe 1
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, STJNDAT, MAT 15, 1898.
that the Third Artillery should remain
here to care for the high power breech
loading guns defending this harbor. It
will require two months' instruction to
qualify new men to handle these guns
in anything like an effective manner.
When volunteers may do nearly as well
as regulars to assist Dewey it would
be a blunder to send away skilled ar
tillerymen.
At midnight the rain that falls alike
upon the just and unjust was descend
ing In torrents upon the soldiers In
camp at the Presidio, and where yester
day was a wide, barren and sand cov
ered desert, last night was a sea of
muddy water. The transformation was
almost incredible, so perfect was the
change, and if the troops in the First
Regiment want to get to their mess ta
bles this morning they will have to
build pontoon bridges. Men never spent
a much more disagreeable night in
camp than did the First Regiment
boys last night. Many of the tents
were practically uninhabitable, the
drains that were dug proving incapable
of carrying off the water fast enough.
Be it said to the credit of the men,
there were no kicks registered, and
they put up with their first real hard
ship like the veterans of the sixties.
As many of the men as could be ac

commodated were transferred to the
Red Cross Society tents, while many
slept In headquarters. Colonel Smith
and his officers did everything in their
power to make the men as comfortable
as possible. The other regiments did
not fare quite as badly, as their camps
are upon more elevated ground.
General Merriam, U. S. A., the de
partment commander, issued an order
yesterday appointing Major McCarthy,
surgeon of the First Regiment, brigade
surgeon. This will give Major Mc-
Carthy full control of all the surgeons,
and he will have charge of the brigade
hospital.
Dr. F. P. Muffe, a prominent physi
cian of the city, who was for many
years a surgeon in the United States
army, yesterday received an appoint
ment from the surgeon general as a
regimental surgeon. He has accepted
the position and will probably be sta
tioned at the Presidio.
Advices were received from Washing
ton yesterday that First Lieutenant S.
A. Colman, Fifteenth United States In
fantry, has been appointed commissary j
officer of the first division of the Phil
ippine expedition. Lieutenant Colman
is on duty now as Instructor in mill
tary tactics, University of California.
The volunteers in camp at the Pre- j
Fidio will be treated to salmon by ]
Henry F. Fortmann, president of the j
Alaska Packers' Association. Fruits j
and fresh beef may be all right for j
awhile, but a little fish now and then Is
relished by the most of men. Mr. Fort
mann's contribution is so generous that
every soldier in camp will be supplied.
The Gray brothers, who were at the
San Francisco Club yesterday when Mr.
Fortmann made the donation, agreed
then and there to transport the sup
plies to camp. Lieutenant J. E. No
lan, Fourth United States Cavalry, post
commissary at the Presidio, will re

CAMPING IN THE RAIN.
The Ardor of the Troops Was
Not Dampened by the
Shower.
The soldiers of the volunteer regiments
now encamped upon the Presidio reser
vation experienced their first real hard
ship yesterday when they were forced
to spend the day in ramp with a dismal j
and penetrating rain falling. Fortunate- ,
lv drains were rapidly dug to draw off
the water from the tents, and the can
vas proved to be waterproof, so beyond
i the fact of being kept confined in their
' quarters the men fared well, as compared
I with what they may expect when they
I get to the Philippines. Those who suf
! rered the greatest inconvenience were the
i sentries, who were compelled to walk !
' their beats, but even they managed to
get overcoats, so that the boys took the
rain more in the way of a joKe; in "fact.
! they seemed to enjoy it after the dust
j of the preceding week.
Major Robe of the Fourteenth Infantry
' was in receipt yesterday of a dispatch ;
i from Colonel Ward, sent by the direction !
of the Secretary of War, instructing him
to inform the men now enlisting in the
Fourtenth Infantry that they will be i
given their discharge at the end of the i
I war upon their personal application for
j the same. This covers the case of all
; men now enlisting or re-enlisting in the
regular service.
General Merriam is expected here by
Monday, and as soon as he arrives a
brigade will be formed from the troops
now in camp. There is no doubt that
; brigade and division formations will fol- :
low the arrival of the general, as it is
his intent; m to begin the preparatory
organization of the troops and get them
Into shape for the purpose for which they
have been mustered into service. Other
regiments are expected here next week,
and brigade headquarters will be at once
established, and the military routine of
a large camp of war got Into Imme
diate shape.
There now seems to be no doubt
that Captain Carrington, who mustered
in the volunteer troops of this State, is
to receive some recognition from the" Gov
ernment for his services. It is positively
known that there is a movement on foot
upon the part of Governor Budd to try
I and obtain the permission of the Secre-
I tary of War to add the necessary battal
ion to the two battalions of infantry, now
forming the Sixth Volunteer Battalion,
so that this command may be made into
a full regiment. At present Lieutenant
Colonel Johnson is in command of vie
Sixth Battalion. In view of the fact that
more volunteers may be called for .there
Is a strong possibility that the request
of the Governor will be granted, and in
that event it Is said that Governor Buuu
will tender the colonelcy of the regiment
to Captain Carrington, provided the Gov
ernment will permit him and he cares to
accept the command. There is no doubt
that the Government intends to mass a
large body of troops at the Presidio, ana
many seem to think that the Secretary
of War will be willing to have the Sixm
Battalion made into a regiment to save
the expense of transporting that many
troops here.
Colonel Smith, of the First California
Infantry, Issued orders yesterday detail
ing Second Lieutenants Otto Schewerdt
ferger ;in<3 James A. Hutton for special
duty ;it headquarters. The strength of
the regiment is now 1032 men. fifty com
missioned officers, twenty bandsmen and
six men in the non-commissioned and
regimental staff. Major Surgeon Mc-
Carthy, of the First Regiment, was in
structed by Major White, U. S. A., yes
terday to issue an order to the different
surgeons of the hospitals, informing them
that in the future all serious cases will I
be treated at the brigade hospital and all !
the remainder at the different regimental i
hospitals.
The arrival of Colonel Summers, of the
Second Regiment of Oregon, is looked for- I
ward to with much pleasure by the offi
cers now in camp, for the colonel is said
to be a martinet and a rattling good
officer.

merits to ascertain what is thought of the
Red Cross Society. This grand and noble
organization is doing its work in a quiet
but most effective manner. Ever since
the First went into camp it has sent
supplies to Major McCarthy and done the
greatest amount of good work, yester
day the agents of the society erected two
tents near the Brigade Hospital, and
these will be put to immediate use. Into
these tents the more serious cases will
be moved. The society also sent out a
supply of blankets yesterday, as well as
the new field ambulance that they pur
cased for the hospital corps.

600 cakes of soap, 268 needle cases, a

It is known and authoritatively stated
by persons who are in a position to talk.
! !vit orders were received by Colonel
Smith, of the First Regiment of Volun
teers, at the Presidio yesterday, ordering
him to move upon Manila to-morrow
night. The order came from the Wax
Department early in the morning, and
Colonel Smith immediately left camp and
came into the city to report at the army
headquarters. When seen about the or
der that he had received he refused to
discuss the matter, as did all of his offi
cers. It la further known that Major
Robe,' of the Fourteenth United States In
fantry, r.nd the commanding officer of the
Fourth Cavalry also received orders from
the War Department yesterday ordering
them to accompany the .First Regiment.
Major Robe, when asked what his or
ders were, refused to say, while the olll
cers of the Fourth also refused to dis
cuss the matter, but Lieutenant Neall
stated late last night that he was not
aware that any orders had been received
by his command.
Colonel Smith had an Inspection of the
regiment in the morning just after he had
received his orders, to ascertain exactly
what the men needed to completely equip
them. The commissary has just received
ten days' field rations, in addition to
those already on hand, which are prob
ably for three days. The regiment needs
at present shoes, overcoats, rifles, clothes
and ammunition, and requisitions for
these are already in the quartermaster's
department. At the meeting of the com
inifsioned officers of the First held yes
tfrday evening it was unanimously de
cided that the regiment should be equip
ped with the Krag-Jorgensen rifle, if it
can be secured, or the Springfield "1884"
pattern, with 400 rounds of ammunition.
From the most experienced officers at
the Presidio it was learned late last night
that the troops cannot possibly leave to
morrow night unless they do so totally
unpreparod in every respect for the duty
which they go to perform as soldiers. Of
the three commands ordered to Manila,
the Fourteenth is certainly the best pre
pared, and it is short of rations. The men
cannot be moved from their base of sup
plies and sent upon a four weeks' trip un
less they have at least thirty days' ra
tions, and that number is not here in the
rii;;trtermaster'K department. The First
Regiment has absolutely nothing, compar
atively spc-aking, and unless the Govern
ment can get the necessary supplies
aboard the City of Peking by to-morrow,
the soldiers, if their commanders obey
the orders that have been given them,
will leave the city of San Francisco upon
a foolhardy mission.
Generals Mcrriam and Otis arr expected
any day, and the latter will no doubt ac
company the expedition. It remains to be
seen whether they will permit the troops
to leave in their present condition. It is
said that General Merriam will not hear
of the troops going to Manila until they
are properly and thoroughly equipped.
From the general expressions to be heard
among the officers of the First It waÂ«
THE EMPORIUM.
very evident that they have no idea that
the First will get away to-morrow night
unless they leave without supplies. It is
believed by many that the order was sent
out by the War Department simply for
the effect of hurrying up the preparations
of the troops.
UNPATRIOTSC
SUPERVISORS
Resort to Low Politics to
Fill a Soldier's
Place.
It transpires that Lieutenant J. W. F. I
Dlss of the Heavy Artillery was mis- j
taken in his estimation of the patriotism j
of the* Board of Supervisors of San Ber
nardino County. Shortly after Lieuten
ant Diss was informed that he would re
ceive the appointment to a place in one â 
of the batteries he telegraphed the Board
Of Supervisors for a leave of absence I
that he might enter the service of the;
I'nited States. He received replies from
three members of the board assuring him
that they would vote to grant ins re- i
quest, and upon this assurance lie ac
cepted the office of first lieutenant and
whs mustered into the service.
Yesterday, however, he received a tele
gram informing him that his chief dep
uty, D. A. Moulton, was making a strong
effort to be appointed Recorder of the
county, the place which Lieutenant Diss
has held for some time, and that two of
the members of the board, from whom
he had received assurances of support in
his efforts to secure a leave of absence,
had turned traitor and are now in favor
(if declaring the office of Recorder vacant,
and will vote to fill the position by the
election of Moulton to the place.
Lieutenant Diss left last night for Red
lands, the county seat of San Bernardino
County, hoping that when the matter
comes up to be acted on next Monday he
will be able to bring the recalcitrant
members of the board to a full sense of

the unenviable position in which they are
placing themselves.
The feeling among the officers and men
of the heavy artillery against the Board
of Supervisors is very bitter, and they aro
not sparing in invectives against what
they term the disreputable action of thÂ©
individuals.
War Incidents.
Yerba Bucna Lodge No. 14 of the An
cient Order of United "Workmen, with its
usual generosity, to which has been add
ed patriotism, will look to the interests
of any of its members who may enlist.
Court Presidio of the Foresters of Am
erica at its last held meeting unanimously
resolved to keep in financial standing any
of the members of the court who shall
enlist under "Old Glory" during the war
with Spain.
Charles A. Smith of Court Star of the
West, Juvenile Branch, No. 1, A. O. F.,
has been congratulated by his fellow
members of the court for his patriotism
in suing to the rescue of his country. The
sense of the court was expressed in a res
olution regularly adopted. All members of
the court enlisting to defend will be ex
empt from dues.
The Oregon volunteers passed a pleas
ant day in camp at the Presidio yester
day. The ruin made them feel perfectly
at home.
Arrangements have been made by Ma
jor General Dickinson to handle reading
matter for the volunteers. Books and
magazines will be conveyed from the
homes of donors to the camp of the vol
unti ets. Notice of contributions should
be sent to "Division Headquarters, Room

The Independent Rifles. L. Schneider

At a regular meeting of U. S. Grant

Â«
Great Britain's Sharp Veto of a
Plan to Keep This Country
Out of the Far East.
LONDON. May 14.â The moment is at
hand when the American Government
and the American people must decide
the destinies of Christendom for at
least a generation to come. It is ab
solutely imperative that the attention
Of the United States should be turned
from the daily events of the Spanish-
Amerioa.'i war to the vastly greater is
sues which involve the future political
history of the entire world. There has
been repeatedly urged upon the read
ers of these dispatches, in the past few
weeks, the Importance of the great crisis
In the affairs of' mankind, of which the
present war is only a single feature.
It will serve, perhaps, to demonstrate
this importance if a single fret is men
tioned, the knowledge of which has
been confined until now to diplomatic
Circles. It is this: Had it not been for
the sharp veto of the British Govern
ment the United States would have
been confronted, several days ago, with
the difficult problem whether to with
draw Dewey ignominiously from the
Philinpines or fight combined Europe.
This statement is made on the author
ity of two prominent members of the
Salisbury Cabinet, and its accuracy is
1 yond question.
Moreover, it falls far short of con
vc'ing an adequate idea of the mani
fold perils, plots and counterplots which
the situation c ins.
Some of these dangers were indicated
yesterday in Chamberlain's remarkable
speech, which is the most pessimistic
and alarming utterance from a member
of the British Ministry in this genera
tion. His open charge of bad faith
against Russia amounted to a chal
lenge.
The whole object and aim of Cham
berlain's speech was to advocate an
alliance with the United States. He
went on to declare that though war was
terrible, it would be "cheaply pur
chased if in the great and noble cause

There Is no doubt that Chamberlain
won the heartiest approval of his hear
ers. There is no doubt also that be
cause the British Government is earn
estly desirous of the consummation of !
such an aJliance the fact Is now
permitted to be known that Great Brit
ain alone has averted the active inter
ference of Continental Europe in the
present campaign between Spain and !
America.
The most superficial observer now
understands that it was only the fear
that the United States and Great Brit
ain would be driven into an alliance
which prevented the unfriendly senti
ments of the Continental powers from
finding: an expression ere this. It is
doubtful if even this fear will avail
until the end of the war.
The proposition to send a demand to
Washington to limit the campaign to
the West Indies and to enforce such
demand with the combined fleets of
Europe came to the British Government
from three powers. On the highest au
thority it can be said that this proposal
was rejected by the unanimous vote of
the British Cabinet.
Moreover, no confidence is violated in
â  sayinp that the Ministry was equally
j unanimous in favor of granting the
United States the fullest British sup
port in resisting interference. It should
be explained that the idea of a Euro
pean interference was not prompted by
any really friendly sentiments for
Spain.
Continental Europe is convinced that
the complete downfall of Spain is a
I foregone conclusion. It is expected
j Spain will be stripped of all her pos
i sessions outside her domestic borders
las the result of the war. The powers
are already discussing the division of
the spoils "between themselves. The
only hope is that they may quarrel.
The points wherein they agree are
i that the United States shall retain
1 nothing outside of the West Indies and
i that Great Britain shall get nothing
whatever, least of all the Philippines.
In fact, the attitude of Europe may

now be best described not as anti-Brit
| ish but as broadly hostile to the Anglo
; Saxon race.
The vacillating attitude of the Ger
man Emperor would be amusing if it
were not of some serious importance.
| Whatever he may do officially, there
seems no reason to doubt that person
ally Emperor William is in complete
sympathy with Spain. Although he
has only shown this publicly by impli
| cation, he takes no pains to conceal it
' in his private, or, rather, his unpublic
i conversation and written communica
, tions.
He has been professedly much
! amused at the exaggerated importance
; attached by American newspapers to
i occasional skirmishes on and off the
coast of Cuba. He has commented with
what he meant to be withering sar
casm upon the spectacle of a squadron
of warships accompanied by press dis
patch boats.
And he was particularly wroth with
Admiral Dewey for doing what his Ger
man majesty, who knows everything,
has been pleased to describe as an en
tirely useless thing.
Emperor William s -nderstood to be
prepared to maintain against the
Washington strategy board, or any
other collection of experts, that Dewey I
ought not to have attacked the Philip
pines until he had been supplied with
at least 5000 troops to f-m landing
parties. In this matter, it must be con- j
fessed, the Emperor does not stand ;
alone, for similar language is heard in
Vienna and Paris.
STELZNER GETS A DECISION
OVER VAN BUSKIRK.
Wins by Forcing the Fighting in the
Last Few Rounds of the
Combat.
MARYSVILI.E, May 14.â The seven
teen round glove contest which took
place to-night between Theodore Van
Buskirk of Marysville and "Jack"
Stelzner of Pan Francisco resulted In
a decision for the latter. De Witt Van
Court of Oakland, the referee, declared
that up to the fifteenth round the hon
ors were even.
He gave the decision to Stelzner for
forcing the fighting and scoring the
most points in the sixteenth and seven
teenth rounds. The decision gives gen
eral satisfaction.
There was no real hard fighting in
the go, it being give and take through
out. In the fourth round Van caused
blood to flow from his opponent's
mouth. Stelzner had it pretty much
his own way in the last two rounds,
but could not deliver a knock-out blow.
About 1100 people witnessed the con
test, which took place in a canvas tent
on the south side of the Yuba. A heavy
shower caused water to pour through
the roof of the tent, much to the sports'
discomfort. Stelzner had in his corner
Martin Murphy, Sam Burton and Tom
Johnson. Van Buskirk had "Jac-k" Nor
ton, Patsy Corrigan and Joe Cotton.
FIVE MASKED MEN

MERIDIAN, Mles., May 14.â The Ala

w s held up by five men near Cuba,
Ala., at 10 o'clock to-night. The men
wore masks and were evidently old
hands at the business. The express car
was robbed of $25,000. Express offi
cials, however, claim only $500 was
taken, as Express Messenger Nicklen
had hidden most of the money in the
stove pipe. A posse was immediately
formed here and left about 12 o'clock
with bloodhounds and are on the track.

Six- Year-Old Boy's Sad Dem
onstration of How a Man
Is Executed.
Jumps From Â« Stump With a Rope
Around His Neck and Is In
stantly Killed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, May 14.â At Elma, south
| west of here, f.ie little ?on of William
| Taylor, aged 6 years, met death yester
! day as the victim of a juvenile hang
ing party. .Strange to relate, the child
; was his own executioner.
In an effort to demonstrate to his
playfellows that hanging was easily
performed, Willie Taylor put a stuut
rope around his neck and jumped off a
large stump into eternity. Instantly
his neck was broken and his com
panions ran h< -,c with sorrowful faces,
leaving his body partly suspended in
the air, thougl. the feet were on the
ground.
The Taylor child and other children
were putting up a swing under some
trees, where they intended building a
summer playhouse. He was an unus
ually bright boy and took the lead in
their pastimes. He had fastened the
end of the rope to a strong limb above
a stump, and was preparing to com
plete the swing when the conveisation
among the other children drifted to
hanging. It was remarked by one
that trees and ropes were used at
hangings, particularly lynehings, and
they wondered if hanging was easily
accomplished.
Willie overheard this conversation
and replied by fastening the louse end
of the swing rope about his neck.
This greatly interested the children
and none dreamed of the sad conse
quences that were to follow. A moment
later the boy had jumped off tho
etump, apparently expecting he could
swing back upon it.
It was really a terrific fall, as was
disclosed by his distorted features,
with eyes bulging from their sockets,
which the neighbors beheld on being
summoned by his panic-stricken play
mates.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 14.â A
correspondent who pasased through
the Cienfuegos blockade on the steamer
Adula on Monday last succeeeded in
entering that y and getting a good
i(" a of the situation. He left Cien
fuegos on the steamer with a number
of refugees on Tuesday, and last even
ing he sent the following dispatch
ashore from the quarantine station:
When about forty miles off Clenfue
,gos on Monday afternoon we sighted
the American blockading squadron,
consisting of the Marblehead, Nash
ville and Eagle. The flagship, the Mar
blehead, bore down upon us at full
speed and fired a blank shot across our
bows.
We came to and were boarded by a
lieutenant. We showed him a permit
from the State Department to pass the
blockade for passengers on condition
that we carried no cargo, and we were
allowed to proceed. The officer of the
Marblehead said the flagship thought
the Adula was a Spanish troop ship,
which is expected daily.
When abi.mt 400 yards from the nar
row entrance to the harbor a Spanish
twenty-ton gunboat, mounting one
quick-firing one-pounder aft, poked
her nose out from the mangrove-cov
ered reef and stopped us. Our papers
had been vised by the Spanish Con
sul at Kingston and soon we were al
lowed to enter the harbor.
The harbor entrance of Cie*.fuegos is
about 250 yards wide and there are
forts on either side of it. These forts
have long rows of old-fashioned guns
and just inside the harbor there is a
modern fortification building of timber,
earth and sand.
The British Vice-Consul, Mr. Fowler,
told the correspondent that the Span
iards had eight or ten modern high
power guns to mount on the new works.
Their calibers were four to six inches.
Inside the harbor were three tiny gun
boats. The only warship of any con
sequence in port was the third-class
cruiser Galatea, The correspondent
counted four guns in her main battery
and she had one quick-firer aft.
The Galatea went outside the harbor
a few days ago to engage the United
States auxiliary gunboat Eagle, Com
mander Sutherland, a vessel about one
third the Galatea's size, The engage
ment was short, sharp and decisive.
INDORSE DICKINSON
FOR BRIGADIER-GENERAL.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 14.â Representatives Barham and
Castle called on the President to-day and recommended that Gen
eral John H. Dickinson be appointed to command a brigade. Hun
dreds of telegrams from California are daily being received here in
Dickinson's behalf. He has now been indorsed by the entire Cali
fornia delegation, except White and Maguire. If a Californian is
appointed Dickinson will be the man, but the chances are that the
President will adhere to his determination not to appoint a Cali
fornian unless the delegates unite on some one.
One of the Eagle's six-pound shells
splintered the corner of the Galatea's
deck house and the Spanish cruiser
quickly retreated into the harbor.
Besides the warships there were two
2000-ton merchant steamers, the Rio
Janeiro and the Alava of Bilbao, and
three coasting steamers inside the har
bor of Cienfuegos. These vessels were
caught in the harbor by the American
blockade fleet, and will doubtless fall
into the hands of our sailors in due
course of time.
A crowd of about 2000 curious people
gathered at the wharf to meet us and
the correspondent was told there had
not been so much excitement in Cien
fuegos since the preceding Saturday
week, when a few shells were thrown
at the American warships, during an
attack made on the Eagle. No one
was hurt.
The correspondent went ashore and
walked through the principal streets
of the city. About one shop in four
wa3 open and business was utterly life
less.
Blockade prices for food are charged
in Cienfuegos.
Flour sells at 25 cents per pound,
meat costs 40 cents a pound, and if you
want milk you must pay 20 cents a
quart for it. On the other hand, bread,
fruit and plantains are plentiful at 5
or 6 cents a pounu. The correspondent
was told there was food enough in the
city to last forty-five days, still Jhe
population Is afraid the blockade will
result in starvation. There are at least
30,000 to 40,000 people In Cienfuegos and
its vicinity, including about 15,000 regu
lar Spanish troops and 5000 volunteers.
The townsrrople and the soldiers
were talking about a vaguely glorious
victory said to have been won by the
Spanish forces at Havana-
General Pando left here for Havana
on Sunday, and heavy fighting took
place on Tuesday about thirty-one
miles from the city.
The British Consul, who was the
charterer of the Adula, has sent to
Jamaica his family, several Cuban-
Americans and forty of the best Cu
ban families in Cienfuegos, in all 297
persons. As the Adula was only pro
visioned for 130 passengers they were
short of rations, but nobody grumbled,
all being glad to get out of the block
aded city.
The Adula steamed out of the Cien-
fuegos harbor at 10:30 a. m., at which
time the American blockading squad
ron had been increased by a large
fighting ship whose name was not dis
cernible.
Nothing is known here concerning
the reported bombardment of Cienfue
gos by the United States squadron, but
as the squadron was reinforced it is
possible that the commander may have
felt strong enough to engage the bat
teries of Cienfuegos.

RbPETITION OF THE
BATTLE OF MANILA.
Naval Official Makes That Predic
tion Concerning the Fleet
of Cervera.
CHICAGO, May 14.â A special from
Washington says: An Important at
tache of the Bureau nf Navigation ap
peared before the Naval Board of War
to-day with a convincing argument
touching the strategic phase of the
situation, so far as it relates to the
probable movement of the Spanish
fleet.
"Admiral Cerveras," he Insisted,
"knows that an overwhelming force of
American ships await him at San Juan.
His only hope of defeating the United
States lies in his ability to reach Ha
vana and place himself under the pro
tection of the Havana fortifications.
"With the start he has he could an
chor in the harbor before Schley heads
him off. If my calculations prove cor
rect we will have a repetition of the
battle of Manila and that, too, on a
larger and grander scale. I do not be
lieve Cervcra will take the risk of put
ting Into Cienfuegos. He will be bot
tled up there. The land batteries on
this point have been reduced."

Sarah Tyson Rorer, the famous food

, Some one asked, "What about Cer-
eal Coffees?"
"Many of them are coffee and very
poor coffee at thatâ do not be deceived
by them, If it is a true cereal coffee,
It is an excellent food drink Mrs.
Rorer, herself, uses Postum because

A week's use of Postum will make

FABIOLA DAY
MARRED BY RAIN
Notwithstanding a Good-
Sized Crowd Viewed
the Sport.
Mr. Bates on William OB
First for the Fabiola
Cup.
Oddson Gallapped Away With, the
Handicap â Mocorito Scampered
Off With the Opening Dash-
Great big pattering drops of rain that
fell from the skies without cessation
dampened the ardor of Oakland's swell
society following, and made a dull af
fair of â¢'Fabiola day." Two or three
I gayly bedecked equipages did make
their appearance In the infield, but
their occupants early became disgusted
with the clerk of the weather's disin
| terestedness and sailed away, home
1 ward bound. Still there were those
j who braved the inclemency of the
weather, and while the bright mlllen
; cry effects were lacking, the well-filled
grand stand plainly betokened the fact
; that the regular racegoers were heavi
ily reinforced. Mr. Bates on William
OB captured the Fabiola cup for gen-
I tlemen riders, and his excellent horse
; manship was well applauded by upper
j tendom. It was well deserved, for he
is no novice.
Of the every-day come and go race
events they were not above mediocrity.
Favorites more than held their own by
captUiing four of the purses and the
bookmakers took what was left. The
rain made the track sloppy and the
mud runners found it easy.
The Fabiola handicap was something
in the nature of a clambake for the
Burns &.Waterhouse entry, Oddson. The
chestnut colt with ninety-one pounds
up and Johnny Woods in the saddle
was a 4 to 5 favorite in the betting, and
after racing head and head with Buck
wa to the head of the stretch, drew
away and won easily, covering the mile
and a sixteenth in 1:50. McDonald on
Imp. Mistral got up in time with his
mount to take the place from Judge
Denny by a long neck.
The Fabiola cup, at a mile, with gen
tlemen riders up, was an enigma for the
talent. In the batting the mount -of
Mr. Dieckman. Wawona, was marie
favorite at odds of 8 to 5. While no
fault could be found with the gpntle
man's riding, the chestnut horse could
not land his big impost inside the
money. Mr. Bates, astride William
08. handled his mount at the post
with the air of a veteran, and getting
away In front rated his mount to a
nicety, and won galloping from Me
talre, piloted by Mr. Blake. Zarro, with
Mr. Howard up, was a good third. It
was by far the best race of this sort
given during thf> season.
The popular colors of Mrs. Nettle
Harrison were carried to the front in
the opening five furlong scramble by
Mocorito, the 7 to 10 favorite. The
chestnut filly made all the running, and
at the end disposed of Master Mariner,
th*> second choice, like breaking sticks.
Castake was third.
The old story of "back a Hindoo in
the mud" was closely followed by the
talent in the five furlong scramble for
two-year-olds. Humidity was played
down to 7 to 10 favoritism and defeated
the second choice Canace, in a canter.
Jennie Reid, a 40 to 1 shot, finished in
the show.
For some unknown reason Colonel
Dan was installed favorite for the mile
selling run, and brought up in third
place at the end. Watomba. with Joe
Piggott in the saddle, heavily played at
odds of 2 to 1, made a fine run through
the stretch, leading the 12 to 1 chance,
Mistleton, out with pounds in reserve.
The crowd all landed on Lucky Star
to pull off the purse in the final seven
furlong run, decided under selling con
ditions. Backed from fours down to
8 to 5 the Friar Tuck gelding was in
front when the stretch for home was

RIVALS TO MEET
ON THE DIAMOND.
The game to be played to-day at Re
creation Park will be between the two
greatest rivals in the league. The man
agement of the Santa Cruz club cannot
understand why the Athletic should ]
have defeated its team on the home j
grounds last Sunday. It was at Its
solicitation that these two clubs were
scheduled to play here to-day.
Mr. Swanton, the Santa Cruz man
ager, claims that his club could always
win with ease from the Oaklands, San
Franciscos and Olympics of the late
Pacific States League, but cannot real
ize that Managers Crowley and Kaplan
have picked a winner from the three
disbanded teams.
Mr. Crowley claims that his team is
the equal of any in the State to-day,
and when it plays a few more games
together the other managers will all
know that there is a club called the
Athletic in the Pacific Coast League.
Manager Crowley has insinuated that
the managers of the Santa Cruz club
have a very exalted opinion of their
team. He was also heard to say that he
would bury this "sea foam" aggrega
tion in the sands of Recreation Park
before the next train leaves for the Sea
Beach. ,
President Bert will have introduced a
resolution at the next meeting of the
league imposing a fine of not less than
$100 on any club that deliberately leaves
the ball field before the end of the
game.
This is something that should be ob
served by all club managers, as the re
fusal of a club to finish the game is al
ways disgusting to the spectators. If
there be cause for a dispute over a de
cision of the umpire the captains of
the teams always have the privilege
of registering a protest with the scorer,
who is in duty bound to transmit the
same to the secretary of the league
within forty-eight hours after such
game. If the protest is properly filed
the president will within a reasonable
time call a meeting of the executive
committee to act upon the matter.
Don't fail to be present at the battle
between the following armies to-day
at Recreation Park. Firing will com
mence at 2:15 p. m. The line up:

A GREAT PAINTING
NOW BEING EXHIBITED.
The great historic painting, "The
Birth of the Nation's Flag," will be
on exhibition at the store of Wein
stoek, Lubin & Co., corner Market and
Taylor streets, commencing Monday
morning. This is an intensely patriotic
work of art, depicting on canvas the
historic personages engaged in the act
of designing the flag of our nation. It
was a prominent feature of the art ex
hibit at the World's Fair, and since
that time has been viewed by thou
sands of delighted people in various !
Eastern cities. This is the first time :
San Francisco has had the opportunity
to see it. To children especially it af- !
fords a valuable lesson in patriotism, j
and mothers, fathers and teachers
should by all means have them view it. ,

MISDIRECTED
LETTER.
was seated in his office yrsterday after
noon directing the destinies of a large
corporation of which he is president,
when he was called up by his wife on
the telephone, and on answering the call.
his better half said in excited tones:
"Penry I have a letter in my hand which
Just came through the mail, and you must
tell me whether what it contains is true
or false. I will be down at the office in
twenty minutes, and I must have an im
mediate reply." The lady offered no
further explanation, and in the interim
at her arrival, the surprised husband
wondered what had happened to thus dis
turb the peaceful serenity of his house
hold. It was probably another one of
those detestable anonymous communica
tions, which had wrecked so many homes,
he thought, but he could recall no act of
his that would warrant the writing of
one. True, he had been to a champagne ,
supper with some male friends the night
before, but had been uncommonly dis- j
creet, as becomes a staid, serious mem- j
ber of the business fraternity, and though
somewhat perturbed hÂ« fHt Safe on thnt ;
score, and anxiously awaited for his wife;
to appear. ,
She finally came Into his office, and
placing a letter on his desk, said ncr- j
vously: "There, now, tell me if what that
letter says is true." The now thorough
ly frightened husband glanced at the su
perscription on the envelope and saw
that the address read "Mrs. Penry
Noughtmann, 1007 II street, San Fran
cisco." His mind was set at rest for
he knew that the letter was probably in
tended for the wife of a man of the same
I name In Sacramento, whom he had al
ready heard of. The "San Francisco"
had caused the letter to be delivered in
this city to the other Mrs. Noughtmann.
Without explaining it to his wife, how
ever, he opened the missive and read as
follows:
â¢â¢Mrs. Noughtmann: If your husband
does not pay the mortgage due me I
will turn you all out of house and home |
immediately. G. A. BLACK."
He saw it all now. His deluded wife !
was fearful that her husband was In j
financial difficulties, and that there â as
danger of losing their beautiful home by )
reason of unfortunate speculations. Ho
did not disabuse her right away, but pro
ceeded to carry out the little deception,
and in a mournful tone said: ''Yea, my !
dear, I am sorry to say that owing to i
business reverses I have lost everything
but honor. But never mind. 1 will per
form manual labor to keep tlu> wolf from
the door. As for that Infernal scoundrel,
Black, I'll teach him to worry my poor
little wife with my business troubles.' 1
and calling his typewriter, he dictated
the following: "Mr. Bkickâ Sir: How
dare you write to my wile and distress
her with my misfortunes? To-morrow I
will give you a well-merited thrashing."
By this time the now thoroughly fright- !
cned wife paid to her exasperated lT< Â£â¢â 
lord: "Oh. don't do anything desperate,"
and with that Bhe shed silent tears.
Thinking that the joke had gone far
enough, the husband disclosed the secret
of the two Noughtmanns and that the
letter was Intended for the one In Sacra- i
mento, and the local Noughtmanns are In j
no danger of losing their home for a i
while at least, whereat the lady rejoiced I
exceedingly.

Another Faithful Animal ThÂ»t Es
corted His Young Friand
to School..
When society goes to the dors
The dogs are not happy, I ween,
For they bark and they howl.
They grumble and growl.
All the time on their benches they're Â«een.
Yet society goes to the dogs.
Since society's dogs are on view;
The St. Bernard may growl.
And the Schipperke howl,
Tet we all love the doggiesâ you
Everybody Is looking forward to the
bench show, which will open at the Me
chanics' Pavilion on Wednesday, and
any information about the wonders to be
on view there Is eagerly caught up.
Among some of the prominent exhibits
Cbtno Don (AKCSB 40560) is the highly
prized property of J. P. Norman ,of Bel
mont, the secretary of the Pacific Mastiff
Club. Don won the first prize at the San
Francisco show of 1596, and at last year's
show achieved the honor of being award
ed the prize for the best mastiff stud dog.
Don is a dog of unusual intelligence. He
was frequently known to travel on the
ferry to the Oakland Mole and would
there board the train for Alameda, where
his former owner had friends. He was
never known to take the wrong- train.
He was in the habit of escorting his
owner's little boy to school, and when the
latter â would approach the edge of the
sidewalk too closely Don would interpose
his lliu pounds of bulk between his young
charge and the curb, and gently but firm
ly push him away from danger.
The complete entries to the show are
made up as follows:
Mastiffs 13 Collies 41 '
Great Danes Xi I Dalmatians ....26
St. Bernards 45 Poodles 6
Newfoundlands 7 Bulldogs 8
Deerhounds S Bull terriers 3*
Greyhounds 37 Fox terriers 26

Cocker spaniels 48, Miscellaneous 9
The largest entry is by the Verona Ken
nels with twenty-six, E. V. Sullivan be
ing a good second with twenty-three. H.
A. "Wegener makes ten entries, and it is i
safe to assert that his magnificent cock
ers will be "in the money." Champion
Havoc. Mr. Wegener's latest acquisition
from the East, has an unblemished record
of victories behind him.
A very fine French poodle. Tricot, will
be shown by Mrs. Hunt. This is a recent
importation, and by all accounts will
prove too tough a nut for the local dogs
to crack.

HE WANTS A PRIZE.

Dash Antonio, the all-age winners, and
Vanquished will again contest for su
premacy, together with other noted
cracks." Lock, the winner of the inter
national cup, will give Dash Antonio an
other chance of retrieving his reputation.
A. Bennet, Lock's owner, is confident that
his dog will confirm his previous victory.
Among the English setters, the most
remarkable dog shown will be H. S.
Scott's Count of Monte Crlsto. This is
the animal that recently created such a
sensation by swimming across the bay
from shore to shore, in pursuit of his
master. It is such fidelity as this that
endears the dog to man. "In life, his
firmest friend; the first to welcome, fore
most to defend."
George E. Bell, the judge of the show,
will arrive at the Occidental Hotel on
Tuesday evening, but will absolutely re
fuse to see any one connected with dogs
! or dog shows until he enters the judging

Such an explicit declaration as this

ACCUSES A SOLDIER,
' Private John Green Charged With
Deserting His Family.
There is one of the volunteers whose
experience in the army is not likely to be
in the line of honors and promotion. He
is John Green of 239 Shipley street. Ac
cording to the complaint made recently
to the Eureka Society for the Protection
of Children he has a nice little wife and
I two small children. Without warning he
left a lob that paid $15 a week, and with
out providing for the care of his family,
joined Battery B, heavy artillery. The
wife told Secretary Wadham that she
was destitute and the little ones have
nothing to eat. Wadham at once got out
a warrant for the arrest of the young
man and laid the case before the officers
of the battery. The latter have taken a
keen interest In the case and the result
was that the assistant adjutant general
sent the following order to Major Rice,
under whose command Green now is:
"Please take such measures as will pre
vent Private John Green, Battery B,
heavy artillery, from escaping until ques
tions' of his status can be submitted to
department commanders on Monday."
Secretary Wadham has been informed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
that Green will be drummed out of the
ranks in disgrace and turned over to the
civil courts as soon as the commanders
can pass upon his case.
WIDBEB, DISLIKES JAIL.
Still Making a Technical Fight to
Keep From the Penitentiary.
Ex-City Treasurer A. C. Wldber, who
is under Indictment on a charge of hav
ing embezzled over JUS, OOO belonging to
tho public funds, is still determined to
make a technical fight to save himself
from tho State penitentiary.
When he was called for arraignment a
few days ago, his counsel interposed a
demurrer to the indictment on technical
grounds. The demurrer was overruled Dy
Judge Cook yesterday, whereupon Widber's
attorney made a demand on Assistant
District Attorney Hosmer for a copy of
the testimony taken by the last Grand
Jury, and on which the Indictment was
based.
Attorney Hosmer replied that testimony
given before the Grand Jury is not taken
down by a stenographer, but asked that
he be granted until next Wednesday to
show to the court the testimony on which
the Indictment was found.
The motion was granted by Judge Cook,
and Widber was escorted back to his
quarters in the County Jail.
Furniture in the Rain.
The furniture of T. Harrigan, who was
evicted from 443 Tehama street last
Wednesday, was yesterday afternoon
placed under cover in the cellar of a near
by house. Harrigan is a blacksmith by
trade, but has done no work for some
time past. On Wednesday afternoon the
Sheriff's deputies carried his belongings
out into the street, and although neigh
bors offered to store them away he re
fused to touch them. In the evening he
took his wife and two children away with
him, and they have not visited the neigh
borhood since. All day yesterday the fur
niture lay out in the soaking rain, until
finally a complaint was mode to the
Street and Health departments that the
goods had been blocking, the street for
more than the forty-eight hours allowed
by law. At about 4 o'clock Mrs. Harrl
gan's brother and a couple of friends ar
rived on the scene and moved the eoods to
a place of safety.
Within the last ten years the- number
of rallwav stations in Germany has in
creased from 6376 to 8893.
HARES FLEW
IN THE RAIN
Sport in the Parks Thai
Tickled the Fancy of
the Leashmen.
The Talent Received Some
Heavy Upsets at Union
and Ingleside.
List of Dog* That Won and Failed
to Haiae a Color on thÂ»
Court*.
Coursing! Never has there been better
sport in an inclosed park than that which
was witnessed yesterday on the Union
Association grounds by at least 1000 peo-
pie.
The hares? Well, they flew from the
dogs as fast as the Spanish warships
are now flying from Admiral Sampson's
squadron, and in many instances made
cover at the extreme end of the big de
mesne, much to the pleasure of the spec
tators and to the disgust of their pur
suers.
Those who played the short end, regard
less of promising tips and sound advice,
captured Borne very tempting pots. The
upsets to the talent were as follows: Lord
Byron, tipped by The Call to defeat the
crack dog, Rusty Gold, sold on the short
end. Three to one was laid against the
Lord, but after a "no course, Byron In
a strong run to game, passed Rusty just
as the hare swerved from its Una and
made a beautiful pick-up and kill.
The next UDset to the judges of form
was in the defeat of W inonu, a 1 to 3
shot, by Little Dottie. But the hardest
fall of the day which the taent sus
tained was when Buckwa, following a
"no course," handsomely defeated SKy
lark. With Jl invested in the pools the
short ends raked in ten heavyweight
silver coins.
Crosspatch, also on the short end at Z
to 3, disposed of Black Prince. Mira
Monte, a 1 to 3 shot, showed a clean pair
of heels to Lady Campbell. Then came
Susie "short-tail," a winner of many
prizes in the slips with Green Valley
Maid. Betting was 2^ to 1% with Susie
on the long end, and considerable money
passed into the boxes at these figures.
The first course was "no go," but in the
dcci course, which was very short,
tho rl clearly showed her superiority
and cptured a flag.
At Last, another of the dogs tipped by
The Call to win, sold at $1 as against $4
on Chartist. The course was long and
tested the qualities of the contesting
hounds. At the finish the red flag was
hoisted and the backers of At Last
cashed their tickets.
The longest and most grue'lng course
of the day was between Ajax and Arapa
hoe. The hare ran both dogs, so to speak,
off their feet, and then defiea Ajax in a
straight run of <00 yards to the escape,
which it made w.th yards to spare.
The final upset of the day to the talent
was in the defeat of St. Lawrence by
White Chief. The deciding rounds will
be held to-day and first-class sport is
anticipated.
The result of the first run downs of the
puppy and all-aged stakes are as follows:

AT INGLESIDE.
Many Show Crack Formâ ThÂ« Stake
Much in Doubt.
Rain detracted much from the pleasure
of getting to Ingleslde yesterday, but It
kept few away. Several nundred people
braved discomfort, and once Inside the
grand stand the discomfort ceased.
Signal and Frlnk were first to the slips,
and Signal sold favorite at 2 to 1. Signal
was one of those that are "never heard."
Fashion Plate then bobbed up as another
2 to 1 cinch over fair Rosalind. Fair Rosa
lind has learned to dance since her last
appearance, and lost the Fashion Plate
with a readiness unusual to her sex.
Thence on, the talent had, Â«.\ings much
j their own way. The stake, of its class,
is higher quality than has been seen for
many weeks. That the short ends were
not sprinkled throughout the run down
; was a surprising action on the part of the
I so-called beaten stock. The only other
that did pull out was Mission Tip, over
whom Prince of Fashion sold favorite at
7 to 2. The Call had observed that Mis
sion Tip would win, and he did, despite
the odds.
The running In detail and by courses
yesterday afternoon were as follows:
Ford & Duffy's Trink beat Richard Jullen's
Signal; H. Caro's Fair Rosalind beat T.
O'Dowd'B Fashion Plate; F. Moran's Van Kirk
beat J. Quane's Captain Morse; O. Wallace's

A Young Burglar Caught.
Henry Rubinstein, aged 9, was arrested
by Special Officer Williams last night and

two companions forced their way Into an

ticles from the place.
DEWEY STBEET.
Editor Call: In a recent issue of The
Call appeared a communication from Pa
cific Parlor, N. S. G. W., stating that it
is the sentiment of that parlor that the
name of some street or avenue other than
Balboa avenue be changed to Dewey ave
nue, after the hero of Manila.
As most of the principal streets of the
city, such as Market. Mission, Kearny.
Montgomery, Grant avenue, Golden Gate
avenue and others, are either named afti
other heroes of our wars or are peculiarly
characteristic to California, I suggest
that the name of East street be changed
to Dewey street. It is not only a promi
nent street, but fronts on the water,
hence its name being that of a naval
officer would be particularly appropriate.

EXCITING BELAY BACE.
Collision Occurs Only a Hundred
Yards From the Finish.
STOCKTON. !V.ay 14.â The Young Men's
Christian Association and North Ends bi
cycle relay race was run from Stockton
to Gait and back to-day. The start was
made on the Plaza at 10 o'clock in the

of the North Ends and Holman of the
Young Men's Christian Association were
wheel and wheel. Only a hundred yards
from the finish Holman turned out and
the men collided. The Young Men's Chris
tian Association rider went to the pave
ment, but Barnes was lucky. Holman
was badly bruised and had three ribs
broken. "Barnes then had it all to
hlmsolf, and won by a slight difference
between the men. The finish was made
at 12:38:05â just 2:38:05 for the race, a dis
tance of nearly sixty miles. It was a well
won victory for the North Ends.

Friends.
SANTA ROSA, May 14.â Guests and
lelegates already are arriving to attend
the Pythian carnival in this city next

Heavy Land Fortifications
Thrown Up Around
Havana.
Spanish Infantry Risks a Volley
From Gunboats and Suffers
Considerable Loss.
ON BOARD THE HER ALJ>- CALL,
DISPATCH BOAT ALBERT F. DEW
EY, off HAVANA, via KEY WEST,
May 14. â Matters have been ordinarliy
brisk during the last twenty-four hours
Inside the lines of the Havana blockad
ing squadron. Yesterday afternoon the
gunboat Osceola and the torpedo-boat
Ericsson had a lively skirmish between
Cojimar and Havana with Spanish sol
diers on shore.
General Blanco no longer fears that
Havana will be attacked from the sea-
Admiral Sampson and his big battle
ships and formidable monitors no
longer haunt him. They have disap
peared. Blanco knows not whither they
have gone, but any apprehension he
might have entertained went with
them.
East of Morro and half-way up the
slope that rises to old San Diego fort is
now a battery bearing on the approach
along the shore from the direction of
Matahzas. This battery is just com
pleted. To-day I could see soldiers
throwing up big sand embankments to
protect the guns. It contains four 10
inch rifles, two of which are mounted
in barbettes. These preparations show
that Blanco has not been sleeping. The
sea defenses of Havana are twice as
strong as they were a month ago.
Lately, however, Blanco has begun to
fear an attack by land. For this he
is not so well prepared, but his soldiers
are making extraordinary efforts to
strengthen the land defenses. Ha
vana's principal defense from an as
sault by land is the trocha which ex
around the city at an average
distance of. ten miles. East of Ha
vana this trocha terminates at Coji
wlu-re there is a battery sweep
ing the little bay. The trocha is like
ther trochas, only much stronger.
it consists of a series of stone forts
with buih-.1 -wire barriers strung be
tween and protected by rifle pits and
earthworks.
For two weeks Blanco has had thou
sands of soldiers working to strengthen
those lines of defense. He has been
constructing an inner line of redoubts
and Ui*reÂ»ehmenta This will be c6m
within two weeks.
i Marco has evidently expected an
American army to land in Cuba beforo
this, judging from his preparations. For
the last week he has been moving large
bodies of troops and field artillery from
Havana to the outer line of defense.
The movement of these troops has been
plainly discernible from the gunb
which patrol close in shore. For con
venience. Â«nd probably in lieu of bet
ter roads, thousands of soldiers march
along the beach. They keep a sharp
it for the gunboats, and generally
r> tire into the woods \vh
Sometimes they show their t"Kh in
a funny way. Captain Pureell of the
,1a observed a body of about 500
Spanish infantry and cavalry march
ing eastward along the beach about
four miles west of Cojimar. Captain
Pureell signaled the torpedo boat
Ericsson, and the two stood in shore
at full Bpeed. The Ericsson h.is only
small sruns. and th , be
ne of the mosquito fleet, boasts of
only one three-pounder forward and a
Catling aft.
They did not look very formidable to
the Spaniards, who drew up on the
beach and waited. When within 1000
both boat? opened with shrap
:.-l. The first few sh'M'.s flew wide,
and the Spaniards defiantly replied
with rifle volleys. Bullets splashed like
hail about the bc-ats, but did no dam
age. After a few shots our gunners
?z< >t the range. In rapid succession
shells burst among the Spanish, who j
promptly broke ranks and took to the
woods. The Spaniards are known to
have lost half a dozen men killed and
wounded. It was a brisk little skir- 1
mlsh while it lasted.
This morning bodies of troops could
be occasionally s^en marching- east
ward between Havana and Cojbnar,
but they kept well under cover. Tiv j
Osceola steamed slowly within 1000
yards of the bench, with a chip on her
shoulder, but the enemy appeared to
hnve lost their inclination to fight gun
boats.
The Dewey had a lively experience
with the blockading fleet last night.
which illustrates the eternal vigilant
of the gunboats. The HferaM-Call dis
patch-boat arrived off Mariel about
dusk. When darkness fell no gun
boat was to be seen and the Dewey lay
to, for it is dangerous to cruise about
off Tuba at night. Clouds obscured
th" const lino and the stars and a squali
was brewing to the northeast. About
8 o'clock the man nt the wheel reported
a ship to port. With his glasses Cap
tain IJyor could dimly see smoke some
four miles off, in the direction of Hn
vnna. For ten minutes we remained
stationary, except for our driftway,

"Guess she's a gunboat," Bald Cap
tain Hyer, "and we had better go to
meet her."
Gradually the ahip grew bigger and
bigger through the gloom. She car
ried no lights, and neither did the
Dewey, that being an order issued by
Admiral Sampson. "Within a quarter
of a mile our boat flashed her fleet
signal, but the gunboat seemed to re
gard the Dewey with deep suspicion,
keeping her search light full on us. She
slowly circled around the Dewey. Not
a word was spoken on either vessel.
This was kept up until we began to
feel embarrassed by the steady stare
of the searchlight, which was absolute
ly blinding. Finally came a hail:
"What boat is that?"
"The Herald-Call dispatch boat Dew
ey," I replied through the megaphone.
"Why did you start to run away from
us?"
"We did not. We came to meet you
as soon as we sighted you."
"All right," after some doubtful con
sideration and then came:
"Any news?"
I told the Mayflower, for she It was,
about the fatalities on the torpedo-boat
Wlnslow and the report that Admiral
Sampson had bombarded Porto Rico
offered some late newspapers if
they would send for them.
"Much obliged; wait for a boat," was
the response.
In a few minutes a boat came along
side and I loaded an ensign with papers
Ining full -reports of the battle of
Manila. When the boat had returned
the officer of the deck shouted:
"Keep outside the blockade so you
won't chase us five miles out of our
course."
We took the warning and steamed
out.
ADMITS HEAVY
LOSS OF MEN
Madrid Newspaper Gives
the Story of Dewey's
Victory.
Three Hundred Spaniards
Slain and Six Hundred
Wounded.
MADRID, May 14.â A dispatch to the
Liberal from Manila, dated May 9,
and sent by a special steamer to Hong
kong, says:
"The arsenal has surrendered and
Cavite has been evacuated by our
troops. The Spanish losses were 300
men killed and 600 men wounded. The
enemy suffered considerably, including
an officer killed on the Olympia. The
Raltimore was damaged. Our shells
did not burst and all the enemy's shells
burst.
"Admiral Dewey has had a long con
ference with the foreign Consuls.
"The Yankees took and burned the
merchant ships, dorregldor Island was
betrayed.
"A consultative assembly is discuss
ing the horrible situation created by
hunger and misery. We are isolated
by the blockade and are in fear of an
immediate attack.
"Since the cable was cut few import
ant events have occurred. The blockade
continues, but Admiral Dewey says he
win not bombard the town without his
Government 1 * orders. He also says he
| hopes that a general rebellion will take
place within four days. New batteries
are on foot in Pamansan."
The Manila dispatch to the Liberal
also says the Panay insurgents have
been conquered and adds that armed
and uniformed bands of insurgents
have appeared in the Province of Capiz.
The Guamboles, Island Luzon, militia,
it appears, is being ordered out for
j the defense of the province.
The reference to the Panay insur-
I gents is probably another version of the
i official dispatch received in Madrid on
j May 7, via Labuan, and cabled to the
i Associated Press, announcing that the
j Spaniards had captured Panay the
headquarters of the Philippine insur
| rection. This was pronounced to be a
most important step toward the pacifl
| cation of the Philippines.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
TO SETTLE
DEMOCRATIC
DIFFERENCES
First Meeting of the
Local Adjusting
Committee.
Fate of Harneyites and
Sullivanites in the
Balance.
Rival Claims for the Contro 1
of the Party Organ
ization.
EXERCISE GREAT SECRECY
. â 
The Hand of Governor Budd May
Make the Last Move in the
Came.
The fate of the local Democracy hangs
: in the balance and the question that the
Harneyites and Sullivanites are asking
] themselves this morning is "Are we in or
: are we out?"
The committee recently appointed by
the State Central Committee of the Demo
cratic party to adjust the differences of
the local Democracy met at the California
Hotel last evening for the purpose of lis
tening to the claims of the opposing fac
tions. The hearing was held behind closed
doors, but the sounds that filtered out
through the oak panels gave evidence of
the bitterness of the strife that resulted
when the flght for supremacy was well
under way.
The committee consisted of Robert M.
Fitzgerald, chairman; Ben M. Mauuox,
secretary; Governor Budd, William H. Al
vord, Eugene Deuprey, Gavin McNab,
Frank H. Gould, Charles M. Cassin and
I. I. Irwin.
It had been previously agreed that each
of the opposing factions should have the
right of selecting two members to
present their respective claims before the
committee. In compliance with this agree
ment the faction known as the Harney
Democrats sent as representatives P. J.
Harney and John F. Me.Govern. The Sul
livan Democrats were represented by. Wil
liam P. Sullivan Jr. and Max Popper.
Each side explained the details of its or
ganization and set forth at length tne
reasons why one faction should be recog
nized and the other ignored.
Every argument that has ever been
put forth in the past on behalf of the
county committee and the general com
mittee was again dragged Into the light
for the benefit of the investigating com
mittee and accusations of bad faith and
broken promises were as thick as flow
ers In May. Sullivan accused the Har
neyltes of making a deliberate effort to
wreck the party, to which Major Har
ney replied that if it were so the only
evidence of It was a few disgruntled pol
iticians who wished to pose as reformers
In order to gain control of the party or
ganization. He â¢ thought if any wreck
ing Was being attempted It was being
done by these same reformers.
To the man in the middle of the road
it would appear that the faction repre
sented by Major Harney has a slight ad
vantage not only In numerical strength,
but also in the manner in which the iinal
report of the Investigating committee Is
likely to be received by the general com
mittee. It is admitted that Governor
Budd Is on the side of the Harneyites,
and as tho Governor Is the power behind
the throne in the State organization it
goes without saying that the report of
the sub-committee will not be acceped un
less it is satisfactory to the ruling power.
No definite action was taken by the
committee last night. After swearing all
members to secrecy as to what trans
pired during the session an adjournment
was taken until 7 o'clock this evening.
In the meantime the followers of the two
local Democratic leaders are holding
their breaths and standing ready to de
sert to the winning standard at the first
intimation of the course of the judicial
body.
There is a great deal of dissatisfaction
In Democratic circles because the plan of
fusing with Populists has failed, except
on term? dictated by the Pnpuliats. These
terms are of such a character as to prac
tically absorb the Democrats.
The Populist convention has been called
to meet at Sacramento on July 12. It will
nominate a full State ticket and seven
Congressmen, as well as Railroad Com
missioners and members of the Board of
Equalization.
The fusion question was taken up and
Settled definitely at the Populist commit
tee meeting In this city a few days ago.
The following resolution was adopted de
manding a joint platform as a condition
precedent to any joint nominations:
The State Executive Committee of the Peo
ple's Party, in regular session assembled. In
flxincr a date for the People's Party State con
vention, hereby resolves tliat it is the sense
of this committee that a union or amalgama
tion of political reform forces or parties in the
Btate <>f California in 1898 should look to a
placing of principles first and the selection
of candidates second, and that thÂ« People's
Party should demand of such other political
forces desiring unity of action, that said par
ties should by their proper conventions first
apree and adopt an identical or common plat
form of principles which all candidates desir
ing the support of any of said parties must
accept and that such common platform must
precise any and all nominations.
In order that there be no questions left
to dispute the Oregon platform was se
lected as the basis and a referendum left
to the party as to whether it would unite
with that as the basis.
SAN RAFAEL SCHOOL
TROUBLES SETTLED.
The Vice-Principal Tenders His Bes
ignation and It Is Promptly
Accepted.
SAN RAFAEL. May 14.â The commotion
in local school circles seems to v - settled
temporarily at least. Vice-Principal Ab
shire handed in his resignation to the
Board of Education to-day and it was
promptly accepted, co he is no longer con
nected with the public schools of San
Rafael.
The following paper signed by all but
two of the teachers has been made public:
We, the undersigned teachers of the High
School, Grammar and Primary schools, wish to
express our Indication at the malicious and
unwarranted attack upon our principal, Mr
George H. Boke, and to state that we cpn
tld'-r the charge of incompetency utterly un
true.
We have worked under Mr. Boke three years
and are thoroughly satisfied that he la ef
ficient, Just, energetic and capable.
We have found him to have the courage of
his convictions, and to be swayed by no con
siderations of policy-
The school has steadily advancer! under his
charge. The school has a course of study as
much to-day as it ever had since the county
course was abolished in the city schools, five
years ago.
We know the charge to be made without
foundation and we repudiate It. Finned:

INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
Of an lowa Lady Who Was Cured of
Dyspepsia After Suffering lor
Twenty-Five Years.
Mrs. Sarah A. Skeels, an estimable
lady residing at Lynnville, Jasper
County, lowa, was for twenty-five
years a sufferer from Dyspepsia, and
her complete restoration to health is
so remarkable that we present the facts
in the case for the benefit of our read-
ers, many of whom have doubtless suf-
fered in the same manner and will,
therefore, be interested in learning how
all stomach troubles may be avoided
and cured. Mrs. Skeels says: I used
only one package of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and I received such great and
unexpected benefit that I wish to ex-
press my sincere gratitude. In fact, it j
has been six months since I took the ;
medicine and I have not had on-> par-
ticle of distress or difficulty since. And
all this in the face of the fact that the
best doctors I consulted told me my !
case was incurable, as I had suffered !
for twenty-five years. I want half a ;
dozen packages to distribute among my ;
friends here who are very anxious to
try this remedy. Yours truly,
MRS. SARAH A. SKEELS.
The reason why Stuart's Dyspepsia '
Tablets are so successful in curing in-
digestion and stomach trouble and the
reason why it never disappoints those
who need it and use it is because noth-
ing is claimed for it except what it will
actually perform. It is not a cure-all
and no such claims are made for it.
It is prepared for the sole purpose of
curing Dyspepsia and the various forms
of indigestion.
There is scarcely a patent medicine
made but what Is claimed to cure dy-
spepsia, as well as a hundred other
troubles. When, as a matter of fact, a
remedy to cure Dyspepsia must be pre-
pared especially for that and nothing j
else; and among all the remedies, pat-
ent nostrums, bitters, etc., so exten-
sively advertised you will find that j
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the only j
one advertised as a cure for Dyspepsia
and nothing else. The remedy is pre-
pared by the Stuart Company of Mar-
shall, Mich., and for sale by all drug-
gists at 50 cents per package, and If
you suffer from any form of stomach
derangement or indigestion a trial will
not disappoint you.

TherÂ© was a tendency among the sol
diers and officers quartered at the Pre
sidio and in Fontana warehouse to ridi
cule and laugh at the efforts of the Red
Cross League to alleviate their sufferings
on the battle-field; but since they have
received physical evidence of the society's
noble work they have changed their
opinions, and are now profuse in their
expressions of gratitude for the relief It
has afforded them.
The troops stationed at the latter place
were compelled to sleep on bare boards,
with very few blankets to cover them
from the piercing winds that swept
through the old building from the bay;
ate food that was cold on arrival, and, in
fact, suffered from privation and neglect.
IDENTIFICATION MEDAL.
This condition of things was speedily
changed when the Red Cross workers
heard of it. They immediately set about
procuring comforts for the men, such as j
stoves, clothing, soap and towels, blank- j
ets and everything that would tend to j
keep warm the spirit of patriotism that j
they have shown since %'olunteering. On ]
the three floors of the barracks there are
comfort and happiness, and every man
of them is bestowing blessings on the j
thoughtful ladies, who did not wait until
their arrival at Manila to begin their good
work.
With a view of still adding to the wel
fare of the men, President. Mrs. Harring
ton, the energetic and Indefatigable head
of the league, went forth yesterday and
ordered 376 blankets and groceries of all
kinds to he sent out to the warehouse at
once. The money used in the purchase- of
the blankets, amounting to $200, was do
nated by a tender-hearted citizen- on con
dition that it be used immediately in pur
chasing the coverlets.
The men encamped at the Presidio have
not been forgotten by the league, as their
welfare is being looked after. A hospital
tent has been erected, and two nurses are
duly caring for patients that have been

"HEARTY
THANKS"
The following letter received yesterday has given much pleasure to
the patriotic workers under the Red Cross banner:
Secretary Red Cross Society, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: In behalf of the
enlisted men composing the command, battalion of heavy artillery, Califor
nia Volunteers, I desire to express to your society our hearty thanks for
your great kindness in coming to the renef of the battalion In the matter
of those supplies so necessary to their comfort and cleanliness. I refer es
pecially to the five large stoves supplied by your society for their use and
comfort, and also the coal to be used In connection with the same. The
towels, soap, washbasins and so forth have been a great boon to the men
and are much appreciated.
If the members of your society and also those individuals who have been
Instrumental In bringing about the donation of these articles to the command
had been here to witness the pleasure of the men when receiving the same,
all the trouble they may have taken in providing them would. I think, have
been fully repaid. The command is now fairly well provided for and doubt
less In a very few days will be fully supplied by the Government.
I also desire to say that the - conduct of the men under somewhat try
ing circumstances for raw recruits, as most of them are, is worthy of favor
able comment. They have borne their inconveniences in a soldierly spirit
and I feel proud of them. They will make good soldiers. Very truly yours,
FRANK D. RICE, Major Commanding Battalion.
brought Jn for tender watching. The many
thousand books and magazines that have
been contributed by the schools of this
city and the Interior have been carefully
wrapped, fifty in a bundle, and taken to
the camp for distribution. The men have
now found a means to occupy their leisure
moments in perusing the interesting do
nations. Mrs. Sloss will see that the men
are supplied with tobacco, and has al
ready received assurances of generous do
nations of the weed.
There Is no abatement in the scenes ox
activity and hard work of the members
of the league. The suite of rooms In the
Claus Spreckels building was filled with
ladies busily engaged in transacting the
many duties that are constantly arising.
Among these tireless workers are ladies

to furnish fi.M") abdominal bandages by
Monday night, and already its members
have begun to fill the requirement. The
belts are to be forty inches long and
twelve inches wide, and the materials to
be. used must be gray all-wool flannel.
Tiiese belts will be worn by the men
wnile in the tropics and are extremely
necessary. It is expected that every
patriotic mother, wife, sister and sweet
heart will aid the leaugue by using her
nimble fingers in making the useful ar
ticles. As will be seen by the accompany

A special festival service will take place
this evening In Grace Church, at which
the offertory will be devoted to the Red

rhe work of handling contributions at

ladies, and their task is a difficult one.
They tie up bundles, segregate donations
and handle packages much too largo for
their untrained muscles. While not com
plaining, the ladies are struggling hard
to overcome their troubles. There ire
times when a wagon drives up to the door
and deposits heavy packages, and they
of necessity must carry them in. It is
hoped that General Dickinson will detail
two men daily to assist the ladies in
thei rarduous undertaking. A lack of
wrapping paper and rubber bands is caus
ing delay, and it Is hoped that some house
will donate, the necessary things.

A Poster Exhibit Is Given in
Aid of the California
Hospital.
Misa Helen Knapp Fitxgerald the
Main Contributor Â«nd
Manager.
Although the rain had a tendency to
throw a pall of disappointment over the
success of the poster exhibition and mus
ical given at the studio of Mrs. McDonald
Sleeth yesterday afternoon. In aid of the
free ward and clinic of the California Eye
and Ear Hospital, it nevertheless proved
both an artistic and financial success.
The large attendance in the evening more
than compensated for the lack of visitors
; In the afternoon, and pocketbooks were
i burst asunder with a liberality thaV
| fairly swelled the little treasury-
The unusually large variety and col
lection of posters, designed and painted
by Miss Helen Knapp Fitzgerald, the
young and accomplished daughter of the
| Attorney General, proved the center of
j attraction and, in fact, the attraction on
every hand, as the walls of the quaint
studio were literally covered with them.
The entire exhibit consisted of 1000 de
signs and was the largest and best ever
exhibited in the city. Nearly all of them
were disposed of by auction, and in ad
dition to realizing a good price on the
sale, they carried the satisfaction to the
purchaser that he was receiving more
than an equivalent for the money ex
pended. The entire display, with but two
exceptions, was contributed entirely by
the brush of Miss Fitzgerald, the young j
and .shining light In the work of charity.
Her whole mind has been concentrated
and centered on a desire to benefit the j
hospital by the institution of the blind
and deaf ward, and if, when the final
count is made, she Is unable to realize
this ambition, It will be no fault of hers,
but rather the Indifference of an unchar- j
itable public.
In conjunction with the poster exhibit
a musical by the following well-known \
i artists was given: Frank Coffin, Misa!
Agnes Simpson, Professor Ketzenbach, j
Miss Scheel and three professionals from i
I Scheel's orchestra.

GOLDEN DROPS,
THOUGH TARDY
Rain Falls Upon Fields
Bleached by the Long
Drought.
Slow but Steady Downpour in
the Northern Part of the
State.
Weather Bureau Station Re-estab
lished at Independence, Inyo
County.
The present rains have not been general
throughout the State, the northern part
having been visited in spots only. There
are grave doubts as to whether the visi
tation has been of any benefit. Weather
Official Hammon is inclined to the opin
ion that it would appear to have caused
eerious injury, especially to the cherry
crop, and It will have a tendency to make
that fruit burst open; that is, if the rama
will reach the cherry sections at all. It
will also rot considerable of the cured hay
that has been lying on the ground, but
may probably produce more of that valu
able article in other localities.
Mr. Hammon further said: "The rain
fall, though steady, has been compara
tively light, and up to last night it had
not reached half an inch in this city. The
conditions all yesterday afternoon were
favorable for a continuance, but the
slightest change in atmospneric condi
tions would give us dry weather again.
It looks as if this might be the long ex
pected rain which failed to materialize
last winter. The barometer has been
siowly falling and there have been some
rain storms in the plateau region. Tno
wind has been southeast off Point Reyes
and this presages more showers and trom
present indications we will have rain
Sunday."
A weather bureau station has been
re-established in the little town of Inde
pendence, lnyo County, and is in charge
of Observer J. J. McLean. The geograpn
ical position of this station is a tine one
for weather observations, situated as it
is northwest of an immense stretch of
territory six. hundred miles long by about
two hundred miles wide, occupying the
outpost of this area.
Tnia section contains the highest and
lowest land in America with the exception
of Alaska. Mount Whitney, over lo.two
feet high, is sixteen miles from Independ
ence, covered with perpetual snow, while
violets are to be seen growing in winter
at the base of the mountain called Lone
.fine. On the other hand, .Death valley,
about forty miles from the mountain, is
4uo feet below the level of the sea.
Climatically, the weather station occu
pies one of the driest spots on the Pacific
Coast, the percentage of humidity tre
quently going as low as 4 per cent, when
the winds are brisk and northerly; us
opposite being Eureka, Humboldt County,
on the north, where the average humidity
far exceeds that figure. Therefore from
Its geographical and favorable climatic
situation. Independence will be an excel
lent place to study meteorological phe
nomena. . ...
The station is to be equipped with a
complete set of self-recording instruments
by the United States Department of Agri
culture after July 1. 1898. Its instruments
at present are self-register, showing wind
velocity, thermometers, barometers, rain
and snow gauges and wind vane, and
these are sufficient to render the data
gathered there of great importance to the
forecast officials of the Pacific (.oast.
Daily forecasts are distributed as wide
ly as the limited mail facilities will allow
and this station will nil a Jong-felt want
in that section of the State and the re
sults obtained will be invaluable

cipitation is of great benefit to fruit trees
and late sown grain. Prospects are good
Â°SUISUn" liay 14.â 1t began raining here
at 2 o'clock this afternoon and up to 8
this evening over a half-inch has fallen,
with prospects of the storm continuing
all night. Orchardists are in the midst
of gathering cherries and all ripe fruit
will be somewhat damaged The benefit
to other varieties of fruit will much more
than offset the damage to cherries In
fact two inches of rain a*, this time
would be the salvation of fruit-growers,
as the lack of moisture in the ground
would have caused a small yield and poor
quality of all late varieties of fruit. Much
hay has already been cut in this vicinity
and rain naturally would result in dam
age, but the benefit to grain would be
more than an offset. The rain comes in
the right time for the 500 acres planted
in sugar beets. The beets are growing
nicely and without doubt will yield well.
MONTEREY. May 14.â Rain began fall
ing here this afternoon at 1 o'clock, and
continues In a steady downpour. Lp to
7:30 p. m. the precipitation was .68 of an
inch. Reports from outlying districts
state that considerable rain has fallen
and comes as a perfect godsend to far
mers and fruit growers in this section.
Fruit ranchers in Carmel Valley will be
especially benefited, and much expensive
irrigation will be spared them by to-day s
ran. Grain is too far gone to receive ben
efit from the rain, but cattlemen here
about say if the precipitation continues
during the night sufficient grass will be
assured to keep cattle in Monterey Coun
ty through the summer.
PETALITMA, May 14.â Rain has been
falling heavily for the past ten hours and
indir.i Lions are for a continuance. Con
siderable hay has been cut, but will not
bt injured unless the downpour is pro
longed. Fruit is not far enough along
to be materially damaged and the farm
ers say the rain will be of vast benefit.
SANTA ROSA. May 14.*-Rain has been
falling in Sonoma County since noon.
Farmers, while not wanting rain just now
for their hay, are jubilant over the pros
pects of much feed and good crops of
corn.
SANTA CRUZ, May 14.â Rain com
menced falling at 1 o'clock and there has
been an unceasing downpour since. The
damage to hay already cut is slight com
pared with the thousands of dollars oen
efit which this rain brings with it. There
will be no damage to cherries, as they
were not far enough along.
HALFMOON BAY, May 14.â 1t com
menced raining here at noon to-day and
for almost five hours fell without inter
mission. The precipitation comes most
opportunely, as it will save the grain
crop from almost total destruction. If
the rain continues at intervals for a- few
days this vicinity will produce almost an
average crop.
SAN RAFAEL, May JMâ There was a
slight drizzling rain in this county yes
terday which Increased to a heavy
shower to-day and shows no signs of
abating to-night. Farmers are nappy
over the fact that it will benefit the late
crops. Some hay may be damaged, but
very little has been cut.
WOODLAND, May 14.â Rain is falling
here. If it continues long It will ruin
considerable hay.
MAYFIELD, May 14.â A light rain com
menced falling here this morning and has
continued steadily. Farmers have con
siderable hay cut. and if the downpour
continues much damage will be done.
Orchardists are much encouraged.
FRESNO, May 14.â T0-day's rain
amounted to only a slight sprinkle In this
portion of the San Joaquin Valley, result
ing in no benefit and doing no damage.
STOCKTON, May 14.â Rain commenced
falling in Stockton at 5 o'clock thi3 even
ing and continued until a late hour to
night. The downpour was heavy for
three hours and considerable water fell.
It is not believed the rain will do much
damage, and it will help some of the late
grain and make feed and some hay. There
Is not much hay sown to be Injured.
SACRAMENTO, May 14.â 1t has been
raining here since 6 o'clock. The fall has
generally been light, but a few heavy
showers have occurred. Should the rain
continue throughout the night and to
morrow, it will benefit late crops of grain
and vegetables on bottom lands, but can
hardly help grain on the uplands. Ripe
cherries will doubtless be injured, but as
most of that fruit has not yet ripened
the damage should not be great. Hay
may suffer, but there is not much of it
at best.
HIS VERSATILE LIFE.
C. A. Shafer, Journalist and Sailor,
Succumbs to a Spree.
S. C. Ainslie enlisted as a landsman on
the United States steamer Mohican a
short time ago and was promoted to the
post of coal passer. Last Friday night he
went on a spree and told a messmate
that he intended to kill himself. He was
found by the police an hour later unable
to take care of himself and was given a
cell in the City Prison. He was taken
sick and was attended by Dr. Tormey,
but died shortly after.
The unfortunate sailor enlisted under
the name of Ainslie. but his true name
was Charles Shafer. His home prior to
his enlistment was in Woodland. Death
was caused by excessive indulgence of
liquor and morphine.
WOODLAND. May 14.â The name of the
sailor who died in San Francisco's City-
Prison this morning Is Charles A. Shafer,
formerly of Woodland. His widowed
mother and his sister. Mrs. H. E. Coil, live
here. He was 28 years old and a lournal
ist by profession. At various times he
was employed on Woodland. San Fran
cisco, Fresno, Washington, Idaho and
Arizona papers. He was a member of
the Examiner expedition to trap Cana
dian opium smugglers. He lost the po
sition of State Librarian of Idaho on ac
count of his convivial habits. He was a
brilliant, fluent writer, inclined to sensa
tional flights. He was genial, generous
and good-hearted and belonged to the
class described as his own worst enemy.
HÂ© was of a roving disposition and his
relatives rarely knew his whereabouts.
He left Woodland two years ago, worked
on the Fresno Expositor a while and
then enlisted on the Independent at Mare
Island. He deserted last January and re
mained at Liverm ?re with a newspaper
friend for two weeks. He returned to

THE FLOBAL SHOW AT AN END
Beautiful Display of Wildflowers at
the California Society's Ex
hibition.
The fifteenth semi-annual exhibition of
the California State Floral Society came
to an end last night with the largest at
tendance that had as yet gathered to see
the beautiful display, and this notwith
standing the inclemency of the weather.
The show has not been as well patronized
as it should have been considering that
the proceeds are to be devoted to the very
worthy movement of the Red Cross So
ciety. '
A lovely collection of wildflowers was
the main feature yesterday, and in beauty,
number and variety were favorably com
mented upon. A number of prizes were
awarded to successful contributors, and
the show was the 'best ever given from
an artistic standpoint by the California
society.
In Aid of the Infant Shelter.
The Little Sisters of the Infant Shelter
will receive a monster benefit at the Bush
street Theater Friday evening. May 20.
in the nature of the presentation of
Geo. H. Baker's "Francesca daÃiminl"by
a carefully chosen amateur theatrical
company, under the personal supervision
of Dudlelgh Stanhope. Owing to the
charitable object upon which the benefit
is based a general response is expected.
General admission to the performance will
be 50 cents.
Tug-of-War, Bain or Shine.
The Chutes management was not dis
couraged at the weather outlook late last
night, but announced that the tugs-of
war between "Jolly," the elephant, and
200 men would come off, rain or shine, this
afternoon and evening. There is plenty
of room in the Zoo for the competition,
and the question of superiority of human
or brute strength will be determined.

A FAIRY IN A
BLUE WATTEAU
Pilar-Morin Charms All Eyes !
in "A Dresden Shep
herdess."
The Queerest Mixture of Realism
and. Fancy Wht6B Result
Is Art.
Imagine a fairy queen dressed In. a
Watteau grown of blue satin, who wears
her white hair a la Marquise, and a
dainty fan at her side; who keeps her
golden scepter safely locked up, like a
careful housewife would, in a box with j
a glass front, and who ascends a j
throne comfortably wadded with satin !
pillows.
Imagine a Cupidâ a Mephistophelean
Cupid, author of all the pantomime's
woeâ a French Cupid attired in pink
satin costume, Louis Seize, a monocle,
a blonde head and a bow and arrows,
tangible, shootable.
Then imagine any mortal woman
you know dressed in Pierrot's shape
less rosette- bedecked blouse and
trousers and big white ruff, her face
chalked, her black head round and {
shaven. No, it would hardly be fair to '
imagine an ordinary woman looking
beautiful under such circumstances,
but Pilar-Morin accomplishes it with
out half trying.
"A Dresden Shepherdess" is the
queerest mixture of realism and fancy, i
whose result is art, thanks to the â¢
grace and beauty and brains which
together constitute this French pan
tomimist. --;, V-
Pilar-Morin is like a clumsy, un
couth boy when she tumbles out of the
moon in response to Titania's ardent
prayers.
Her indifference, her adorable clown
ishness, her youthful, relentless cruel
ty are all so many representations of
mock emotion. You know all the time
the story isn't true, and you only hall'
sympathize with the cheated fairy
queen, while you exult in the success
of Pierrot's shameless treachery. But
it's a different matter when Sylvia gets
possession of the potent scepter and,
in her turn, drives Pierrot forth. Such
a passion of sorrow, of despair, of love
there is in that round little white face
with the great dark eyes; such plead
ing as might move even Sylvia, so that
lest she relent Colin takes the scepter
from his sweetheart; and such hope
less grief when the humanized, heart
broken Pierrot vanishes at length from
sight, borne upward on the moon's sil
ver crescent, his hand outstretched to
ward the cruel little shepherdess, his
dark, sorrowful eyes turned toward her
to the very last! It's the prettiest
tableau. But every scene of the pan
tomime is a picture. The Dresden
Shepherdess ballet is graceful and
charming and Pierrot's dance with
Sylvia is an optical poem. Mile.
Severine is a delightful Sylvia, hard,
vain, coquettish, a fascinating, shallow
little hoyden.
There's more real acting, a finer ap
preciation of dramatic possibili
ties in this company than San
Francisco has had the good for
tune to see for many weary
months. When. In addition to this
Frpnfh idyl, the beautiful tragedy, "In
Old Japan." is given, and Fritz Scheel's
orchestra plays the Flirtation waltz In
softest pianissimo and the intermezzo
from "Cavalleria Rusticana" exactly
as Shepl knows it should be played, and
the Hungarian dances, as Brahms
heard them in his mind's ear before he
wrote them with all their melody and
rhythm and lawlessness â then one can
realize the merit of the performance
at the Baldwin: be grateful for the
charm of it: and sing the praises of the
artists who make it possible.

The unkindly weather of yesterday did
not deter a goodly number of ladies and
members from attending: the Encinal
Yacht Club's opening entertainment. The
club-house was gayly decorated with
Chinese lanterns and draped with flags,
and a little after 8:30 p. m. Dr. C. L. Tis
dale president of the Encinal Yacht
Club for IS9B, made a few opening re
marks. Then F. R. Ziel, the clever ama
teur photographer, exhibited a number of
lantern slides, representing ships of the
United States navy, Commodore Dewey,
well-known yachts and some striking
sunset and moonlight scenes. Then fol
lowed songs and recitations by H. Melvin,
W J Hines. W. J. O'Brien and others.
After the songs a set of engrossed resolu
tions was presented to ex-Commodore J.
A. Leonard, owner of the yacht El Sueno,
who is about to depart for the Klondike.
The evening wound up with a dance.

Why James Was Led to
Kill Himself and
Wife.

Which the Shooting
Occurred.

Mrs. Jamas' Wild Schemes Ended in
thÂ« Total Loss of All They
Possessed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 14.
A bundle of letters which was found
among the effects of the late Morris
James, who committed suicide In a res
taurant on Ninth street and who at
tempted at tho same time to shoot his
wife and another lady, makes tho cause
ot the tragedy very clear.
It was supposed at the time and was
bo announced that James was led to act
as he did because of jealousy of his wife.
This is now proved not to have been the
reason why he appeared at the restau
rant with his gun, pretending to murder
any one he might meet. The letters just
made public show very plainly that James
and his wife owned much property In
Tehama County, also some In Oakland
and San FraJicisoo. The little town
where they lived became objectionable
to them on account of gossip, and Mrs.
James came to Oakland for the purpose
of trading off their country property for
anything she could get in San Francisco,
Oakland or Los Angelee.
Mrs. James evidently considered every
proposition that was made to her, for in
July and August of last year she wrote
to her husband every other day, and each
letter contained references to some new
deal which was going to make them rich.
When Mrs. James started out with her
system of trading -she had property which
her letters show was valued by a lead
ing real estate man of tnis city at $50,000.
Her first trade was for a valuable piece
of property in San Francisco, which,
when she thought It was her own, she
discovered was carrying a mortgage
which she could never hope to pay. This
deal robbed her of a considerable portion
of her property. Then she entered into
an agreement to trade all she owned for
property at Los Angeles worth $50,000.
Somehow or other, which Is not made
clear, this deal fell through, after consid
erable* time had been spt-nt in examining
i^." property, makin~ abstracts and sim
ilar proceedings. This deal was so nearly
closed In her mind that she told her hus
band she would receive the money next
week. Somehow tho money never came,
nnd another slice of her property dis
appeared.
Trades in Alameda and Fruitvale prop
erty foil i wed, hut the lady always found
that there were heavy charges against
them and mortgages which she could not
possibly meet, and as they passed out of
her hands each left her a little poorer
than before.
There is a vein of unconscious humor
throughout the letters. One of them
"I have made a big trade to-day, :
0. Hurrah for Bryan; good boy;
don't be lonesome; will be home soon "'
â¢ The next lett. r shows that the $20,000
dirtn"t materialize. In another place Mrs.
James states that her husband was down
here for several weeks and did not make 'â 
: ffle trade, -whereas she was only \
here a week and she traded with nearly
every real est;u.- dealer in town.
Finally. ...s. .lames found that all she
could do was to buy a restaurant. This
is the way she informed her husband of
her last trade: "I have taken in a res

MYSTERIES OF ASTROLOGY.
"Dr." H. E. Howland Claims That
Mrs. Clara B. Sterling Sought
Him.
OAKLAND, May 14.â "Dr." H. E. How
land, who is charged with fraud by Mrs.
Clara B. Sterling, denies that he did any
thing wrong, but says he left the woman
because of her tongue.
He says Mrs. Sterling came to him and
said she would like to be initiated into the
mysteries of astrology. She took him out
to" dinner in this city and in San Fran
cisco, and it was at her suggestion that
the property at Elmhurst was purchased.
He being ill at the time, she suggested
that it would be beneficial to his health
to live In the country, and he claims that
he put in one-half of the money. A joint
deed was made out, which was placed
on record. The property consists of three
lots, giving an area of 106 by 132, a cot
tage, garden and orchard.
Subsequently he said that, she became
jealous because he was teaching astrology
and drove his customers away from the
house. Finally he declared that he would
leave if she would give him back his
money. He picked up his things and w-as
about to go away when she called an offi
cer and had him arrested. She had him
charged with battery and also with em
bezzlement, which he denies. He claims
ti.at the articles which he was about to
remove were lent him by a lady who lives
on Clay street.

preliminary hearing to proceed in the
Police Court to-day, owing to the absence

Monday, the day originally desired uy
the court but refused by the defendant-
Scott presided, definite steps were ta
kon to oppose the proposed new char
ter.
An address on the subject was de
livered by J. Munsell Chase, whose
views were so well liked that they wore
unanimously indorsed. It was decid
ed to familiarize the public with Mr.
Chase's views, which were adopted as
those of the league, and to this end it
was agreed to circulate the address in
pamphlet form and otherwise.
Following is the text of the address:
Fellow-citizens of San Francisco: In a
few days you will be called upon to adopt
or reject, as the fundamental law of your
city and county, the charter proposed by
the Freeholders elected last December.
It is a voluminous document, requiring
long and exhaustive study in order to ar
rive at anything like acurate knowledge
of its provisions, and, along with a few
things that are commendable, it contains
a multiplicity of provisions that are in
congruous with a democratic form of
government and that are subversive of
much that is best in present institutions.
We therefore ask that you carefully con
sider the followng objections to it:
Firstâ lt is too long. It is longer than
the Alagna Charta and Bill of Rights of
Great Britain, the Declaration of Ameri
can Independence, the constitutions of the
United States and the State of California
all combined. This great length is un
necessary and dangerous, for the greater
the length of a document the more like
lihood there is that some mischievous
omission or insertion of a phrase or word
may have been made, accidentally or
otherwise.
An instance of the injurious effect of
length may be found in section 1, chapter
11, article 11. The Board of Supervisors
is granted power "to ordain, make and
enforce within the limits of the city and
county all necessarj* local, police, sanitary
and other laws and regulations." This is
a full and complete grant of power in
the express terms of the State constitu
tion, and any further detail of what the
Supervisors may do is entirely unneces
sary, if not pernicious. But the charter
as proposed goes on through thirty-four
other subdivisions to provide that the
Supervisors shall have authority "to reg
ulate and control for any and every pur
pose the use of the streets, highways,
public thoroughfares, public places, al
leys and sidewalks of the city and
county," etc., etc., each subsequent sub
division being a special enumeration of
power already granted In the first sub
division and repeated in subsequent divi
sions of the same section.
In law, special enumerations of power
granted have the effect of nullifying all
general grants except as to powers spe
cifically enumerated. Hence, In this sec
tion we may reasonably expect to find, If
the charter is adopted, serious if not fatal
restrictions on the power of the Super
visors, ajid it matters not in the result
whether this failure to grant proper au
thority is an oversight or intentional. In
either case, the effect is the same.
Secondâ The charter contains mLsohiev
ous restrictions on the legislative author
ity. The most serious of these is that
provision known as the "dollar limit"
(Section 11, Chapter I, Article lllj, a
provision never before placed in the or
ganic law of any city or State.
"We want good government. We want
it at the least possible cost, but good
government we should be resolved to have
be the cost 95 cents or $1 05 in the $100 val
uation. The dollar limit provision In tin
charter is almost certain to prove detri
mental ftather than beneficial to the city's
best interest, and, therefore, should never
have been proposed, and now that it is
proposed should serve to defeat the docu
ment containing it.
With the dollar limit in the organic law,
tax reform will be. out of the question,
for it will be absolutely Impossible to
obtain sufficient revenue without keep
ing in vogue the pernicious poll tax, and
ail forms of inquisitorial business and
personal property taxes. The present cost
of municipal administration is about $4.
900,000 annually. Of this, under the dollar
limit, it will be possible to obtain from
land, houses and personal property about
$3,500,000 on the present valuation. The re

THE WEATHER
Fabiola's Friends Parade
in a Heavy Rain
Storm.
Ladles Not Unanimous on the
Propriety of Racing ,
Benefits.
Dr. DillÂ« Amused at the Way . the
Prayer of Rabbi Levy Whs
Ignored.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 14.
Fabiola Day has passed. It was spoiled
by the rain. Whether the financial end of
the day has been damaged by the stormy
weather or not will be known In a few
days, but the parade was killed off al
most entirely. . :';{':. :-'.V
The day was to have been a day of dis
play, and society had decided to appear
in all the beauty and gayety of summer
dresses and be-ribboned horses and car
riages, but by noon the rain commenced
to fall and did not cease until midnight.
The controversy over the advisability
of the Hospital Association accepting the
gate receipts from the racetrack is not
yet ended. There are many who believe
that the heavy rain was a sign of dis
pleasure, especially as the day has been
both condemned and recommended to di
vine favor by prominent divines. Rabbi
I ovy, in an open letter, asked for God's
blessing on Fabiola Day, while Drs. Dille,
Coyle and Horatio Stebbins have publicly
declared that no Christian should take
iiny i>art that would tend to swell the
coffers, even for charity.
Rev. Dr. Dille, whose printed prelude
last Sunday night proved such a bomb
shell to local society, was asked to-day If
he thought Providence had purposely
worked against the success of the day
by making it stormy.
"I cannot help being a little amused,"
he said, "that charity should be so treat
ed by the elements. I am not going to
say that it was a direct intervention of
Providence, but certainly the man who
prayed for God's blessing on the day
must be grievously disappointed.
"I have letters from three of the ladies
on the directory of Fabiola, assuring me
that they approve of my stand, and many
prominent people all over the State have
sent me letters couched in the same spirit.
I was particularly pleased with the letter
of Dr. Stebbins, published' this .morning.
"Now, then, I would like to tell you one
of the many incidents that have come to
my notice In regard to the race track.
There is a young lady in Berkeley who
is a pupil of a San Francisco art school.
For several weeks she was supposed to be
going to San Francisco every day, but
when the time came to pay her bills she
was forced to confess that the money had
gone into the race track coffers and that
she had been a daily attendant at the
racing. Phe said that she was fully aware
of the foolishness of her conduct, but that
once she started betting she could not
restrain her passion. These are my ar
guments."
Three Rails to Be Used.
OAKLAND, May 14.â The narrow-gauge
railway will not be entirely abttn
in t hi-;' city. The road over the new bridge
will have three rails, and this will be
carried from the mole to the Fourteenth
street depot. The local trains will be
composed of broad gauge cars, but the
freight work will be done on the narrow
gauge tracks. The reason given for this
1* "hat the city's franchise precludes a
complete change. Excursion trains for
maining $1,400,000 must come from other
sources From where?
In proposing this restriction in taxation
the property owning class have asked fpr
a special exemption in their favor. In
â , l in ;', of Public need evenr dUiea wig
can bear arms is compelled to do so. it
matters not that he may be under or
over the usual enlisting limit, every man
who has hands to hold a gun and eyes to
see an enemy, and feet to get about on
rrust place his life in jeopardy that the
property of his fellow citizens may be
protected. Yet property demands that
only $1 in $100 of valuation shall be taken
to carry on the necessary business of the
city Wherein is the Justice in this?
Thirdâ ln pretending to promote it ef
fectually precludes the possibility of ad
vantageous ownership of public utilities.
Article XII (Acquisition of Public Ltill
ties) provides that 15 per cent of the
qualified voters shall have power to ini
tiate a proposition looking to the acqui
sition of a public utility, but leaves with
the Supervisors the power of determining
what proposition shall be submitted to
the people. (See section 3 of article XII.)
By the provisions of this section 15 per
cent of the voters can require the Super
visors to submit the question; Shall we
buy the Spring Valley Water Works?
But the question as submitted may ne:
Shall the city of San Francisco pay $30.
000.000 for the Spring Valley Works? Or,
if the people petition for the submission
to popular vote of the question: Shall
the city proceed by original construction
to own and operate water works? the
Supervisors have power, under the char
ter to submit the question: Shall the city
FROM HIGH ART TO VAUDEVILLE
* DOUARD REMENYI.the eminent
* Hungarian violin virtuoso, is
, t another great artist who has
condescended to join the procession
of those who have lately flocked
to the vaudeville ranks. He will make
his debut therein on Sunday evening
at the Orpheum, and the master of
that king of instruments will undoubt
edly electrify his hearers as he has in
the past.
The distinguished musician, who ar
rived Thursday from St. Louis, said
yesterday: "Yes, I have decided to
make my entry on the vaudeville
stage, and I must say that the con
sideration is such a large one that I
could not very well refuse to do so.
And why not? I am sure the people
who frequent vaudeville performances
are appreciative of good music. I will
appear in my violin selections at one
of your theaters, and I must say that
I am glad to be with you once again.
It has been said that vaudeville per
formances are attended by a more
cosmopolitan audience than I have
been in the habit of playing to hereto
fore, but this will not alter my fixed
rule to play only musical compositions
of the highest claws. I shall endeavor,
if necessary, to educate and elevate
my auditors to the high standard of
musical art which it has ever been my
ambition to attain, and I trust that I
have not lost any of the power I for
merly possessed to accomplish that
praiseworthy result. I still have my
'Stradivarius' with me, and isn't it a
beauty?" and with that Remenyi
grasped his beloved instrument, which
be fondled as one would a baby, and
with a few deft touches of his bow he
evolved such delicious strains as un
questionably stamp him one of the
greatest violinists of thÂ° age.
the Santa Cruz Mountains will also be
run into this city on the narrow gauge
track. _
SUNDAY'S MASS MEETING.
OAKLAND, May 14.â George D. Gray
will preside at to-morrow's Red Cross
meeting in the First Presbyterian Church.
It will take place at 3:30 p. m. and be
addressed by Mrs. Charles Webb How
ard. Mrs. Sarah Sanford, Hugh Craig,
William N. Friend, William R. Davis,
James S. Stevens, Chaplain Clark, A. H.
Elliott and Hon. Frederick S. Stratton.
Already some unscrupulous persons are
taking advantage of the generous spirit
prevailing and are making collections for
their own benefit under the cloak of the
Red Cross. No solicitors have been ap
pointed, nor will be until further notice.
The enrollment blanks indorsed by Misa
M. E. Babson, which, when signed, call
for $1 are the only forms of solicitations
yet undertaken, excepting the gentlemen's
finance committee. This is composed of
a number of well-known men, with John
A Britton as chairman. They are solicit
ing from the banks and other corpora

A MINER WANTS
TO MAKE MONEY
Evidently Thinks Brierling Is
Anxious to Become a
Manager.
Proposes AIL Sorts of Wager* to
Work and Walk Fifty
Miles-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, May 14.
Since Assemblyman Brierllng lost $50
trying to prove that his butcher boy
could not walk from San Jose to Oak
land immediately after his day"s work
was done, and without any rest, he has
learned that there are others who are
anxious to walk for money.
It is very evident that some of the
people who are willing to wager money
with Mr. Brierling on the result of a
i test of their endurance consider the As
i semhlyman quite a nice fellow to do bust
1 ness with. His butcher boy, Gorman, ex
! perienced no difficulty in walking the dis
i tance in fourteen hours, instead of twen
1 ty-four, and now comes R. B. Sears, a
! burly miner of Calaveras County, who
submits the following proposition:
SNELL MINE, Calaveras County, May 10.
Editor Callâ Sir: I notice in your paper a
walk for a wa#er between Assemblyman Brier
ling and Richard Gorman. I will agree to come
! to Oakland and stay one month, do no train-
Ing", and work in the shop of Mr. Brierling free
of charge, do the same work as Mr. Gorman,
and walk the same distance In 17 hours. If I
win the wager I will then complete it in IS
hours. This must be for a 6um of money no
less than $500.
Then if 1 am successful I will agree to com
plete the distance In 12 hours. I am a miner,
and all the walking I do Is to my work and
back, which conptttutes about three miles a
day. Yours respectfully, R. B. SEARS.
Husband's Letters in Court.
OAKLAND, May 14.â Constable C. F.
Weldon, who levied an attachment upon
the trunks and papers oi "Dr." H. E.
Howland, has been .served with a sub
pena by District Attorney Snook, to bring
all of the letters in his possession into
court. This is done to secure evidence
against the man in the case of felony
now pending. It comes up on June 1
before Judge Ellsworth for trial. An of
l:ce boy is the complaining witness, and
it is claimed that some interesting affairs
will come to light if the letters are read
in court.
huild a water work system to cost $35,000,
000? In cither case the people would vote
no, and the only inconvenience the Spring
Valley Company would have experienced
would have arisen from the necessity of
"convincing" the Supervisors to submit
the question as the company wished.
But suppose the first election results in
the people voting to buy, or build water
works, a second election must then be
held to vote the bonds for the purpose,
and at this election two-thirds of the
persons voting must favor the proposi
tion or it fails. What likelihood is there
that under these circumstances any pub
lic utility will ever be taken under public
control except the corporations become
more generous than in the past?
As conditions are the city can secure
control of public utilities by condemna
tion and appropriation, but under the pro
posed charter this method is effectually
done away with, inasmuch as it is speci
ally provided that the method for acquir
ing such utilities shall be by purchase or
by original construction. As a first-class
humbug we commend this charter in its
provisions relative to the acquiring of
public utilities.
Fourthâ The proposed new charter
makes of the Mayor a veritable Czar. He
is authorized to initiate policies and veto
legislation, to cut down appropriations,
to refuse the ratification of contracts, to
reject items of account, and besides his
legislative functions he will have dis
cretionary power to appoint and remove
the officials who are the nominal heads of
government. Moreover, he is authorized
to suspend the very elect of the peopie.
He appoints and will control the election
SMALL WATER
FRONT VICTORY
Pierhead Lines Will Not
Be Changed by the
Engineers.
The Peculiar Brock Petition
Fails to Accomplish Its
Purpose.
Other Tactic* Will Have to BÂ» Put
in Usa to Disturb trie
Property.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 14.
The War Department has decided that
the pierhead lines of Oakland harbor shall
not be changed. This decision disposes of
the petition of the C. C. Brock Company,
which set forth that the interests of
shipping would be best served by disturb
ing the present lines and surveys.
Major Heuer of the United States En
gineer's office received information yester
day that the Secretary of War had sus
tained the opinion of the local Govern
ment engineers, which is favorable to
maintaining the existing conditions. The
War Department states that it has care
fully considered all the arguments sub
mitted, including the stenographic report
of the statements of the Brock Company
and the city of Oakland, and there is no
reason for making the change. This de
cision is final as regards the pierhead
lines.
The Merchants' Exchange and the
Board of Trade and the City Council are
greatly gratified at the result of their
labors, as they put in strong protests
against the proposed change. The people
of this city were not consulted when the
petition was drawn up by the Brock Com
pany, and as Oakland is the party most
directly interested there was more than a
suspicion in the minds of merchants that
there was a power at work not apparent
on the surface. It was only after some
days that this city learned that a petition
had been filed.
It is the general opinion among those
conversant with water front litigation
that the attempt to have the pierhead
lines changed originated in some quarter
where there is a desire to disturb the
status of the water front cases now in
the courts. If the Government could have
been induced to make the change it would
certainly have been an advantage to the
water front company, and would have
operated against the interests of this city.
Attorney W. R. Davis, who appeared
before the engineers in the interest of
this city, is gratified at the result.
"This decision of the Secretary of War
puts an end to this kind of business," he
said. "Hereafter, people that are anxious
to get away with the water front will
have to adopt new tactics."
Lowell High Takes First Place.
OAKLAND. May 14.â The twenty -five
mile relay bicycle" race of the Academic
Athletic League was held on the San
Leandro road this morning for the second
time. The Lowell High School of San
Francisco captured the trophy. The Oak
land Central and High came in second
and third respectively. Time, one hour
eighteen minutes fifty-six seconds. The
Oakland High School held the lead until
the beginning of the fourth relay, when
their man failed to make connections.
The time lost then lost the race.
Delegates to the Federated Clubs.
OAKLAND, May 14.â Mrs. Alice W.
Bunnell, the retiring president of the
Khali Society, and Mrs. E. Southard have
been chosen delegates to the National
! officers and is responsible for an honest
counting of the votes, and, in fact, he
will have control of S3 per cent of the en
j tire expenditures of the city government.
It is thought by many that the one-man
government has resulted well where it
has been tried. Such is not the case.
There is not a single case where large
powers have been conferred upon the
Mayor that evil results have not followed.
The power has been as often abused by
the Mayor as has any power possessed by
the Supervisors, and the experience of
many cities has proven that there is more
probability of electing a bad Mayor than
a had Board of Supervisors, some of
whom have invariably proved honest. All
that the machine has to do is to concen
] trate its ejiergies upon the election of a
I Mayor and the machine is in control. If
I a good man is a candidate, then it has to
j tlnd a second or third good man who will
I consent to run and divide the honest vote,
I at the same time concentrating the vote
i of the "push" upon the candidate who
! will be subservient to the wishes of the
jobbers. Under a storm of public excite
ment Seth Low was elected a model
Mayor of Brooklyn. He was followed by
Whitney, Chapin and Moody, who were
creatures of Boss McLaughlin. For eight
I years the city was dipped in corruption,
I waste, inefficiency and extravagance. In
| Boston, Mayor after Mayor has been
elected only to disappoint the hopes of the
municipal reformers. The public debt has
I increased, employes were hired at more
â  than market wages and the grea:*st
frauds in executive contracts have been
perpetrated by the Board of Public
Works. In Cleveland the concentration of
power has not been followed by the adop
tion of business methods. In Cincinnati
Boss Cox rules the Mayor. Philadelphia
under its Czar Mayor has the worst mu
nicipal government in the United States.
Civil service rules are a dead letter. The
city is controlled by politicians, who live
on patronage and are corrupt and ex
travagant.
In Quincy the author of the autocratic
charter admits its failure. Under a simi
lar charter the Mayor of Indianapolis re
moves and appoints office-holders in his
own interest. At the first election under
the autocratic charter of Greater New
York Boss Croker of Tammany secured
the election as Mayor of his man Van
Wyck. who has the distribution of pa
tronage valued at nearly $100,000,000 an
nually. Under a similar charter Oakland
has as black a mayoral scandal as ever
disgraced any solid eight or nine in the
history of this city. (See editorial in Ex
aminer of April 2.) In San Jose like re
sults have followed from the adoption of
a one-man government. Boss Rea's man
was elected Mayor at thf first election
held under it and now rules the roost.
Fifthâ The pretense that the charter
gives the people power to initiate amend
ments to it is false The method of
amending, as of making charters, is fixed
in the State constitution and cannot be
changed by charter or by general law.
Hence if you adopt this charter in order
to amend it you will have to:
Firstâ Elect ten Supervisors and a
Mayor, or, without the Mayor, fourteen
Supervisors, who will propose the amend
ment to the people.
Secondâ Secure a favorable vote of at
least three-fifths of the persons voting at
an electionâ a thing almost impossible of
accomplishment; and
Thirdâ Secure the approval of both
houses of the Legislature.
These three conditions can never be ful
filled.
In conclusion, fellow-citizens, you do
not want a form of government in which
the determination of nearly every ques
tion of policy and riprht is vested in one
man. But you do want a simple, straight
forward charter vesting all authority in
a Board of Supervisors sufficiently large
to render it practically impossible to cor
rupt it, and each memher of which is re
movable at the will of his constituents.

ENCINAL YACHT CLUB.
Opening Day Under Discouraging
Weather â The Evening Enter
tainment All Right.
ALAMEDA, May 14.â The rainy weather
to-day acted as a decided dampener on
the opening day of the Encinal Yacht
Club. There were a number of visitors,
however, and the indications are for a
successful season. The rain did not affect
the evening's performance at the club
house, however, and there was a large
gathering of members and their friends.
An impromptu vaudeville peeformarue
was given, which was participated in by
Dr. Bertrand, Dr. J. G. Humphrey, Billy
Hynes, Harry Malloon. Captain Leal, Wil
liam O'Brien and others. F. R. Zea^ gave
some stereopticon views and Yanke's or
chestra furnished the music for the Sing
ing, and afterward for dancing, which
was participated in by most of those
present.
A Strange Proceeding.
ALAMEDA, May 14.â Another step in
the ante-matrimonial woes of Heinrich
Schmidt and Mrs. Sophia Kammerer has
been taken. It will be remembered that
the not at all youthful couple obtained
a marriage license and made a date for
the performance of the ceremony with
Justice Morris one day this week. But
the lover came not on the appointed
hour, and subsequently Schmidt said the
affair was off because Mrs. Kammerer
wanted him to deed all his property to
her before the ceremony was performed,
und this he was too shrewd to do. But
an arrangement of some kind must have
been entered into, as the transcript of
records shows to-day that instead of
Schmidt deeding to his bride-elect she
has deeded property to him. Whether
they are married or not 's not known.
Schmidt took the license away from Jus
tice Morris and has remained very much
in the background ever since the fiasco
of the other day.
Patriotic Knights.
ALAMEDA, May 14.â The Knights of
Pythias have decided to erect a pole on
their lot on the corner of Santa Clara
avenue and Oak street, and will raise
thereon a flag of suitable size, which will
be donated to the lodge by J. F. Barber.
This flag will be kept floating "for two
years or the war," or at all events until
peace once more reigns. There will be
appropriate ceremonies when the banner
is raised.
HONOB FOR A BRIGHT STUDENT.
George D. Leslie '98 Awarded the Le
Conte Memorial Scholarship.
BERKELEY, May 14.â The Le Conte
memorial fellowship for the coming year
was to-day awarded to George D. Leslie,
who will graduate next Wednesday from
! the college of social science with the de
i gree of Ph.D. The award was made by
the Le Conte memorial fellowship com
mittee, consisting of Professor Joseph Le
j Conte, Professor W. E. Ritter, W. R.
| Davis, Elsie Lee Turner and Herbert
I Dam.
Leslie is considered one of the brightest
â  and most conscientious students at the
I university. He has completed the four
years' course in three years, after com
pleting a three years' high school course
in two years. He will pursue advanced
graduate study in history, politics and
economics. His is the first case of a stu
dent, not specializing on science, receiving
the Le Conte scholarship.
CLASS PAGEANT POSTPONED.
BERKELEY, May 14.â The rainstorm
played havoc with the annual class day
exercises at the university to-day. In
spite of a threatening sky in the morn
ing, the class pilgrimage to the various
points of interest on the campus took
place, but shortly after noon the rain
began to pour and the grand Chinese
pageant and class dispensation that were
to have been hold in the amphitheater on
the hillside had to be postponed. The
celebration will take place next Tuesday
afternoon at 2 o'clock.
the "all powerful and one-sided new
fangled charter."
The following resolution was unani
mously adopted at a meeting of that body
ivAd last night:
Whereas, The new charter, under the title
of "Civil Service Reform. Article XIII.-" pro
vides for the appointment by the Mayor of
three Civil Service ConuniMlOÃers, whose joint
fixed ralaries, with thetr clerk, amount to SG'iOO
per ypar; incidental expense, sue I ;is assist
ant clerk.-., Janitors, printing, stationery, rent,
fuel, light, etc., will amount to $6wo more;
total expenses in one year not less than $12 -
000, and In ten years it will amount to more
than J12O.O00: therefore.
Resolved, That the members of the Conti
nental League art- opposed to creating more
useless offices, notably sinecures as those
and charging the amount to the already oyer
burdemd taxpayers, especially as the same
service is now performed by the heads of the
various departments, with better results and
without any expense whatever to the city
Any three citizens selected at random can per
form all the work required of these superflu
ous commissioners in twelve days In any one
year, >tnd any ordinary clerk, when made chief
examiner, aided by the other examiners to be
appointed by these exalted commissioners, can
perform all the work required of them in
thirty days in the year, working three hours
per day. This work, if contracted for. would
not cost the city more than J.ino per year.
Ar.d yet our young, esteemed. Inexperienced
Afayor has been fretting and stowing for nearly
two years and using the courts and all the
power at his command to remove a few over
worked clerks employed by the city in order
to economize in favor of this useless expense
because it gives the Mayor the power to ap
point his relatives or partisans in the ring to
thrso sinecures.
It would have been of far greater lmportan. c
to this community If the freeholders had pro
vided for a commission of three eminent phy
sicians and made It their duty to discover some
specific for the cure of that terrible disease
known as the chicken disease which affects so
many elected officers.

portance. they aim to display It by trying to
change the customs and laws of the country by
compelling the people, their superiors, to
humiliate themselves by undergoing a non
sensical examination for a simple position.
If the applicants for examination were al
lowed in return to examine the commissioners
the people would soon discover the farce of
these examinations and discontinue them, for
the commissioners would be made the laugh-
Ing stock of the community.
The object of the competitive examinations
Is not to procure more competent employes for
the city, but to prevent the office holders,
elected from being Importuned for a political
position. They forget that before election on,
their bended knees they importune all the:
voters Individually or collectively to vote' for
them, and resort to every means honorable or
dishonorable known to the science of politics
to procure their election.
These would-be boss rulers know or should
know that in this republic every American
citizen that has arrived at the years of dis
cretion and graduated from the grammar
schools Is just as competent to hold any elec
tive position within the g-ift of the people of,
this city as they are and no American mechanics
or clerk who has any self-respect and values :
his liberty and the privileges guaranteed tÂ«
him by the constitution since the birth of tha
nation. If he stops to consider the matter
will vote to adopt a new charter that degrades
him and his children by compelling them to
undergo a competitive examination while it
exempts another class holding higher positions
from any examination whatever.
And no party can afford to disfranchise lta
advocates and friends in that direction whem
it becomes known and is made apparent that'
the object is to establish a life-holding class!
in the civil service in this republic. If this'
charter is adopted our boys who do the fight
ing and return maimed and disabled will be
told the civil service positions are all ta'te.i
for life, there is no room for you. If this
obnoxious doctrine is forced upon the ;>eo;ji,s
at a special election called for the purpose tiiot
people will soon demand that a limit of time
be fixed by law for all employes in the civil
service. THK EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

POOR MEMORIES.
Two Chinese Native Americans Not
Acquainted With the Hills of
San Francisco.
Chow Hing Suey and Chow Oum Choy
were before United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock yesterday on a writ of
habeas corpus, they having been denied
the right to land by the Collector of the
Port. They claimed admittance to this
country on the ground that they were
born in San Francisco and went to China
when they were only 7 years old. Al
though they had traveled from the
steamer to the County Jail on Broadway
and thence to the Appraiser's building,
they were unable to say whether the
streets of this city were level or hilly.
All that they could remember was that
it rained here sometimes.
The Commissioner announced that he
would report to the court in favor of the
deportation of the applicants.
Died on a Car.
A man who ia supposed to be. named
P. O'Connor died on Potrero streetcar No.
1123 last evening about 9:30 o'clock. He
got on the car somewhere in the Potrero,
and when the car reached Market street
and turned to go back he remained in his
seat. H. Webster, the conductor, was
unable to arouse him and at Third and
Harrison streets the passenger was
found to be dead. Officer P. K. OKeefa
took the body onto thf sidewalk and noti
fied the Coroner. A butcher's booK with
the name of P. O'Connor in account with
George Rauber was found in the mail's

ten that landlords ever existed. There are no
renters there. Every family In that prosper-
ous neighborhood owns Its own home. The old

ly Installments, the same amount that you
used to pay In rents, benefits you directly,
for each payment brings you nearer to the
time when you will have to pay no more.
Two new houses, modern, cozy affairs. Just
completed in the Heyman Tract, can be pur-
chased on these terms. To see them take

VALE, MASONIC FESTIVAL!
WIDOWS ajid orphans of Califor
nia whom fortune has neglected
and left penniless in this work
day world will soon have a home,
iiappy and comfortable, in which they
c&n dwell and rest. The last bell has
pealed at the Masonic festival, and it
lives now only as a memory, but that
memory is a happy one. That fete, in
augurated in the cause of charity, has
served its purposeâ a most laudable oneâ
and as a monument to forever mark the
time when the multitudes gathered as
friends of the cheerless poor a stately
building will soon stand, and within its
walls good will and peace will supersede
the anguish Its inmates knew when they
dwelt forgotten by the world.
Thirty thousand dollars at le**.t, per
haps more, has been realized at the fes
tival, and when the Baldwin Theater
closes next Thursday afternoon a fund
sufficient to complete the contemplated
building will be in the hands of the
finance committee. Work will then com
mence Immediately on the home, and the
passing of another year will doubtless see
the penniless widows and orphans in
stalled within it.
Notwithstanding the fact that the rain
poured in torrents the livelong day thou
sands upon thousands of visitors enjoyed
the festival yesterday afternoon and
evening. Those who enjoyed the fete
when it was new were there and rein
forced by new faces in multitudes they
crowded the hall to almost the limit of its
capacity As it was auction night a
caravan of visitors bearing tickets in
their hands and gold in their pockets
moved from booth to booth, bid for the
auctioned wares, and the lucky bearers
of raffle tickets carried away their win
nings. Many of the larger donations were
not auctioned last evening owing to the
Immense crowd, which rendered it al
most useless to endeavor to exhibit the
MORE TROOPS FOR
CAMP PRESIDIO
A Battalion of the First
Regiment of Washington
Volunteers Arrive.
The new steamer Senator, of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, which sailed
from Tacoma on Wednesday evening, ar
rived in port last night at 7 o'clock, hav
ing on board the First Battalion of the
F ; r=t Regiment of Washington Volun
teers. It was in a heavy and steady rain
thai the steamer docked at the Broad
way wharf, and as there was no prospect
of an immediate cessation of the storm
it was decided to allow the troops to re
main on board the boat during the night
The trip was a pleasant and comfortable
one. and was thoroughly enjoyed by all.
The battalion is in command of Lieu
tenant Colonel W. J. Fife, and consists
of four companies as follows:
Company A. formerly Battery A. of
Spokane; captain, O. H. Otis; first lieu
tenant. E. Erwin; second lieutenant,

Adams; first lieutenant, Henry Eggle,
second lieutenant. George Lamptag.
Company E, of Takima, formerly Troop
A: ciptaln, Scudder; llrsi lieutenant.
Briggs; second lieutenant, \\ illiam J^em-
The battalion, consisting of fifteen offl
,n,i â :.- men, has been in camp at
Camp Rogers, Tacoma, for about two
we< ks and during that time the troops
have drilled daily. They are a fine look
â  men. and are all eager to go
to the front. On the day of their de
parture from Tacoma the citizens of that
town gave thÂ«-m a big and enthusiastic

Company 1> holds the record for having
the lowest percentage of physical failures.
Out Of 106 men only sixteen failed to pass
the examination.
Lieutenant Colonel Fife, commanding
the First Battalion, has long been a
prominent citizen of Tacoma. He Is a
r by profession, and is a writer of
considerable al'ility. He has some talent
as a poet and as an actor, and is con
ceded to be a very accomplished gentle
man and versatile entertainer.
The major of the battalion is J. J.
nbergr. a prominent lawyer of "W'hat
com, who lias long been connected with
the National Guard of Washington.
The Second and Third Battalions will
arrive In San Francisco early this week.
They will probably come by rail. The
regiment is commanded by Colonel John

For ten years I suffered untold agonies from

slippers so that I could moveabout at all. My
brother, a physician of thirty years' practice

to effect a cure and signally failed. I tried
other physicians of splendid ability with like
results, and had reached that point where I
became absolutely disheartened, and in fact
had :<ist all hope, when a friend induced me
to give Ci'ticcha Remedies a trial. 1 used
two cakes of Cttiocra Soap and two boxes

an absolute and permanent cure. I am now

companions, resolved only a few days
ago to leave a comfortable home, father,
mother and sisters and submit his destiny
to the fortunes of war. He is not yet

it will be seen what a trial it was for
his parents to part with him. However,
he was resolved and determined, and even
the tears of his mother could not deter
him from his purpose. He declared that
he was not born to commercial pursuits,
as his father had intended him, but was
made of sterner stuff, hence, on Wednes
day last, he bade good-by to his family,
kissed his tearful mother and two little
sisters, shook the hand of his good father
and started off for Mare Island with his
grip.

THE SAN FKANCI6CO CALL, STJND AT, MATT 15, 1898.
AN UNSIGHTLY STRUCTURE.
ProDertu-Owners Protest Against a Street Obstruction
on Pacific Avenue and Scott Street.
FRUITLESS ATTEMPT TO REMOVE IT,
J. A. Geene, the contractor and owner of two buildings situated on the
southwest corner of Pacific avenue and Scott street. Is enjoying an immun
ity from the law seldom tolerated in a city boasting 1 of the individual rights
of its citizens.
Genee a year or so ago was given permission to erect a structure to serve
the purposes of a toolhouse, carpenter-shop and general repository for
valuable building material, to remain in its position on the corner as long
as the buildings on the adjoining property were in process of construction.
This time has long since elapsed, as the houses have been completed at least
five weeks; but as yet no disposition is shown by the contractor to com
ply with the requests and demands of the law. Complaint has been made,
but to little advantage, by the property-owners. Petitions have been for
warded to the Board of Supervisors requesting that the street be cleared of
the unsightly structure; but these have been totally ignored and never an
swered, either through oversight or direct motive, and, as a consequence,
taxpayers, who think they have a right in demanding protection of thoir
property, have reached the conclusion that it is useless to protest, as the
Supervisors have evidently arrogated to themselves the right to govern In
direct defiance of the laws which they are supposed to follow in furthering
the protection, welfare and interests of the general public.
The abuse of citizen rights and the violation of all known laws govern
ing the erection of such structures is considered by the property-owners
In the vicinity outrageous and beyond toleration. They claim that the
Street Superintendent, the Board of Supervisors or whoever is responsible
for the long delay in removing the structure should not only be compelled
to remove it immediately but should be made to give an explanation of the
delay in not demolishing it before.
For twelve months the dirty, unpainted boards, thrown together in the
wildest fashion, have remained an obstruction to pedestrians, who have
been compelled to either take the street In passing from their homes to the
streetcars or of choosing the alternative of ruining their clothes walking
through the small passageway the building affords on the sidewalk. In ad
dition to being an Inconvenience to pedestrians, it has been a continual
menace to teams passing down Scott street from Jackson to Pacific avenue,
as the space between the building and the opposite curb is hardly sufficient
to allow the safe passage of an ordinary light wagon.
Not content with obstructing the sidewalk and the greater part of the
street, the privileged law-breaking contractor took advantage to add a few
embellishments to his nuisance in the form of a projecting shed on Pacific
avenue, which incidentally included the telegraph pole and a fire alarm box.
In order to make things seem more homelike, an aperture was cut in the
front of the new addition and an old section of stovepipe Inserted, which
more than completed the Impression that Geene had come to stay.
Underneath the closed and well-built floor, and in full view of passers-by,
are a number of wheelbarrows, timbers, etc., which serve to designate the
contractor's occupation without the necessity of the erection of a shingle on
the premises to that effect.
The structure is over 13 feet In length, 15 In width and 10 In height, and,
considered as a whole, and especially in these hard times, would make a
comfortable domicile for a family of at least eight.

THE CYCLING CLUBS.
The board of governors of the Associ
ated Cycling Clubs met in the California
Cycle Club's room at Twenty-first and
Folsom streets last night. Delegates were
present from the Acme Club, Bay City
Wheelmen, California Cycle Club, Gar
den City Club, Golden Gate Club, Olym
pics and Ariels.
It was expected that there would be
many protests filed regarding the award
ing of last Sunday's relay race to the
Bay City Wheelmen, but none were filed.
It was suggested, however, that it would
be advisable to find some means of abol
ishing pacing at relay races or make it
legal, and also to clearly discriminate be
tween a local or outside man and keep the
lnterclub events purely local. This cre
ated considerable discussion, and it was
claimed by some of the members that it
was impossible, as a member of a club
cannot be barred from a contest simply
because he lives in another portion of the
State, so long as he is a regular member
of some local club. Others thought that
more interest would be awakened in the
events if some law could be framed
which would keep all who are not strictly
local men out of the local races.
matter was finally referred to the road
racing committee, with instructions to
draw up rules relating to this matter and
present them to the next meeting of the
board.
Owing to the dispute as to whether
Fowler is entitled to ride as an amateur
his record was looked up, and the com
mittee reported that, while he should
long ago have been classed as a profes
sional, the matter had been overlooked,
but that he would be notified that in the
future he will be classed as a profes
sional.
CLEVERLY
DUPED BY
AN ATTORNEY
How Lawyer Cald
well Imposed on
Julia Avanseno.
Induced to Part 'With
Money She Drew Out
of the Bank.
Represented That He Could Fix
a Case in Which She Was
Interested.
USED AN INNOCENT TOOL.
The PolioÂ© Bolievo CaldweU Has
Loft th.c City to Avoid
Arrest.
Attorney Caldwell, the well known Po
lice Court practitioner. Is likely to find
himself In serious trouble. He is accused
of obtaining $150 from Mrs. Julia Avan
seno, a widow residing on Geary street,
near Larkln. Some time ago Mrs. Avan-
seno cau=ed the arrest of W. H. Simpson,
a machinist, for stealing $700 from her.
Simpson was released on $1000 bonds, and
through the efforts of several Police
Court attorneys he managed to have the
case against him dismissed.
About a week ago Caldwell, it is
claimed, visited the residence of Mrs.
Avanseno and informed her that Simpson
had considerable money in the bank and
offered his services in compelling him to
disgorge the amount he took from her.
He further represented that he had con
sulted Attorney Edward Comyn, who de
fended Simpson in the Police Court, and
that he was willing to assist him in forc
ing her alleged despoiler to return the
amount it was claimed that he had fraud
ulently obtained from her. The unsus
pecting woman, after listening to his
story, promised him a handsome fee If he
succeeded In recovering the money. Cald
well subsequently went to Comyn, and
after unfolding his plan requested him
to accompany him to the home of his
victim.
"It is like getting money from home,"
he is said to have remarked. "Just you
say that you are Simpson's attorney and
I will do the rest."
Comyn refused to enter Into the scheme
and ordered Caldwell out of his office.
Caldwell, it is said, afterward hunted up
Judge Wirt, who is also a Police Court
attorney, and informed him of his scheme.
He asked Wirt to represent himself as
i Attorney Comyn, and promised to pay
him well for his trouble. Wirt is said
to have accepted the offer, and together
they went to the residence of Mrs. Avan
seno.
Caldwell introduced Wirt as Attorney
Cemyn, and declared that he had volun
teered his services in assisting him to
recover the money which Simpson is al
leged to have taken from Mrs. Avanseno.
Apparently satisfied that Wirt was Attor
ney Comyn, the unsuspecting woman
agreed to give Caldwell $150 if he succeed
ed in forcing Simpson to disgorge.
She suggested that they go to
the Hibernia Bank with her, where
she had some money on deposit.
Accompanied by Caldweli and Wirt, Mrs.
Avanseno went to the bank and drew out
the amount which she promised to give
them. She handed the money to Wirt
and asked him to at once commence pro
ceedings against Simpson to compel him
to return the money he had taken from
her. Caldwell, it is claimed, agreed to
lose no time in forcing Simpson to dis
gorge.
Alter leaving their victim, the attor
neys went to a saloon on McAllister
street, where Caldwell induced Wirt to
turn over to him the money be had re
ceived from Mrs. Avanseno. Taking a
silver dollar out of his pocket, he handed
it to Wirt with the remark that he would
"see" him in the morning.
i Since then Caldwell has not been seen.
His friends claim that he is on a spree;
i but the police are inclined to believe that
he has left the city. Several days later
Mrs. Avanseno, realizing that she had
| been duped, visited police headquarters
and endeavored to procure a warrant for
the arrest of Caldwell. She was met by
Attorney Walter Gallagher, who is a
friend of Caldwell. After hearing her
rtory, Gallagher persuaded her not to
have Caldwell arrested until he had been
given a chance to make good the amount
he had taken from her. Attorney Comyn
said last niprlit that after he had learned
of the transaction he went to Mrs. Avan
seno's house and told her that he knew
nothing: of the transaction. She was sur
| prised when she learned that he was At
! torney Comyn. The woman admitted to
him that she had given Wirt and Caldwell
$150, but begged him not to say anything
about it.
Mrs. Avanseno indignantly denies that
she gave any money to Caldwell or Wirt.
She claims that she does not know the
former and that the story of her having
hem duped by him was concocted for the
purpose of injuring her. Notwithstanding
her denial, there seems to be an abund
ance of evidence to show that she was
not only cleverly swindled out of $150 but
that she was at first determined to have
Caldwell arrested.

RENOWNED MUSICIANS.
The Kneisels, From the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra, in the City.
One of the most renowned musical or
ganizations in the country, the Kneisel
quartet of Boston, arrived last evening
from Denver, and is stopping at the Pal
ace. It is composed of Franz Kneisel,
first violin; Otto Rotli. second violin;
Louis Scvenski, viola, and Alvin Schroe
der "cello. For thirteen years they have
played with the Boston symphony orches
tra" and during the summer seasons give
chamber concerts throughout the East
and Europe. ,
In London they are established favor
ites and the usually conservative English
press is lavish in praise of these instru
mentalists. The London Morning Post re
marked: "It would, Indeed, be impossible
to conceive greater perfection in the mat
ter of ensemble, precision, delicacy and
all the qualities requisite for the proper
interpretation of chamber music."
This year these artists concluded to
come to the Pacific Coast, despite the pre
dictions of many Eastern pnp^rs that
their tour would result disastrously. En
route they played at Buffalo, St. Louis
and Denver to a tremendous business, and
last evening Mr. Kneisel said:
"Many people tried to dissuade us from
coming to the Pacific Coast; but when
our friends Mr. and Mrs. Georg Henscnel
told us of the kindness with which tney
were treated we resolved to try the ven
ture. I am sure that we will have no
cause for regrets."
They will give their first recital at
Sherman, Clay & Co. f s Hall to-morrow
evening. _

â \_ *r MalL 10.000 Tmtmontm. JTaauESCAPED FROM SPANISH DUNGEONS TO JOIN OUR VOLUNTEERS.
Thrilling- Story of J. W. Masters, who is now encamped with tnt volunteers at the Presidio, en route to the Philippine Islands. Masters was among the first in Cuba to rise with General Maceo against Spanish misrule. He
was captured, escaped and joined the filibus'ering expeditions. After a number of daring adventures he was recaptured and taken to Madrid for trial. With the aid of Lilia Moreita, he escaped from his dungeon and fled to Mexico.
When war was declared he promptly volunteered and is now on his way tc the. front to fight the Spaniards again*
REVENGE! That is what I en
listed for and that is what I am
going to have. Once I fought
for Cuba in Cuba, but Cuba is
free now and hereafter I will
flght for the United States and
revenge."
The speaker was J. "W. Master, pri
vate of Company D, First Infantry Vol
unteers, at present stationed, at the
Presidio preparatory to being sent to
Manila.
Master was one of the first to vol
unteer under Maceo at the beginning of
the Cuban revolution. He Is a man
who looks every inch a soldier and a
fighter. He stands a full six feet in
height. Is broad in proportion and has
muscles on his arms that stand out like
knots on a rope. He is thoroughly
hardened to the work that is before
him and knows more about what he is
going to face than any man in his
company.
He is the only man in the regiment
who has really experienced Spanish
cruelty and injustice In the war to free
Cuba. Fez. mcDm eD j, aHS through the or
deals that have been his and fewer still
are willing to face the possibility of
undergoing them a second time.
But Master is not afraid, even though
his body la covered with scars, inflicted
while he was imprisoned in Spanish
dungeons. He has been fighting against
Spain for four years and Is willing to
fight four years more if necessary for
his revenge.
"Don't think I am bloodthirsty," con
tinued Master, lying back on his pallet
of straw in his tent at the Presidio,
for if any man had been through
what I have he would feel the same
way. Is.o man can realize just the
amount of Incarnate deviltry there is
in a Spaniard until he has lived among
them during war times.
"The cause of their fiendlshness Is
more than I can comprehend, for in
times of peace the Spaniards are pleas
ant enough to get along with. But
when they get angry they seem to lose
all control of themselves and become
veritable savages. I think the fact is
that they are not really civilized. They
only think they are. Talk about the
villainies of the North American In
dians â they are not a bit worse than the
THE CALL Sunday Edition
Spaniards. I have seen worse sights
In Cuba on the Spanish army's trail
than any soldier ever saw among the
devilish Apaches.
"The word "butcher' do<*s not fitly
describe the Spanish soldier. On a
few occasions we Cubans had the gooa
fortune to surprise parties of Spanish
soldiers while they were engaged in
games of torture, such as cutting out
an insurgent's stomach while the man
was alive. And I tell you we made
short work of Mr.' Spanish soldier right
then.
"How did I come to fight for Cuba?
"That is easy to answer. I saw that
the cause was Just and felt it my duty
to help a down-trodden people gain
their liberty.
"The trouble broke out In the spring
of '94. At that time I was working in
Havana at my trade. lam an Ameri
can engineer and machinist. Of courss
there had been talk of rebellion for .v
long time, but the fight began all of n
sudden.
"I am not exactly certain of the date,
but one evening Maceo made a speech
in Havana and recited the wrongs un
der which the people were trying to
live. He asked for volunteers to freÂ»
Cuba from the yoke of Spain. Of course
such bold words roused the authorities
and they tried to suppress him. There
were few soldiers in Havana at thÂ«
time, or he would have been arrested
and shot.
"As it was Maceo left town and sent
out circulars asking men to join him
in an insurrection. He didn't have to
ask very many times. Men came from
miles around.
. "I was one of the first to sign the roll
for 'Cuba Libre.' My name was about
the third from the top. It would have
been first if I could have got to the
book sooner.
"Our struggles began on the first
day. As soon as it was known in Ha
vana what Maceo was doing a troop
of soldiers was dispatched to arrest us.
But they didn't find us. We had taken
to the country and were engaged in
getting recruits in such sections as
were friendly to us.
"We had not much to offer the poor
fellows in the way of worldly goods.
But we spoke the magic word, 'Free
dom,' and that brought thousands un
der our banner even though they knew
Jt meant hardship, hunger and perhaps
death.
"My first detail work was carrying
dispatches. For some months I went
across the country between Havana
and the insurgent camp unmolested.
Then I acted as scout for about four
months. I went into all sorts of places
and kept our army fully posted on the
movements of the Spanish forces.
'In all this time I did very little
fighting. But, to be sure, there was
not very much to do. Real hostilities
had not yet commenced.
"My career as a scout came to an
end through treachery. A boy who
had been our friend was bribed by the
Spanish to betray all he knew. Part
of his information was the fact that I
was a scout. They promptly offered a
reward for my capture.
"It happened that I was Inside the
Spanish lines at the time. The Span
ish soldiers were between me and my
companions.
"Had I not accidentally seen the
placard offering a reward for my cap
ture I surely would have been ar
rested. As It was I was on my guard.
I tried to find a place in the lines
where I could get through, but there
was no break and I knew I could not
make it.
"When things reached this stage I
suddenly made up my mind that I
would go to Havana and boldly leave
the country. The possibility of my do
ing this never entered the heads of the
Spaniards, for notice of the discovery
of my identity had not then been sent
in the direction of Havana. So I
reached the city easily and boarded a
steamer for the United States without
even being suspected. I even con
versed with the Spanish officers there
and told them some things about the
insurgents that pleased them greatly.
"At this time they seemed to think
that the whole uprising was a sort of
farce. They laughed at the idea and
said that the insurrection could be put
down at any time â just as soon as the
Spanish officers had made up their
minds to stamp it out in earnest.
"Although I got out of Cuba all right,
I had no idea of giving up Cuba's cause
of freedom. I turned to the work of
filibustering. This was not a difficult
thing to do, as men were wanted for
the work and expeditions were on foot
all the time.
"The first expedition that I went on
was just like taking a pleasure cruise.
We loaded a small steam schooner at
a wharf in one of the Atlantic cities,
cleared In proper order and left with
out anybody Baying a word. We had
hundreds of rifles and thousands of
pounds of ammunition on board, which
passed muster as canned meat, tea and
household utensils.
"The cargo was landed as peacefully
as if thei'e was m> such thing as a revo
lution going on in Cuba.
"Our second expedition had trouble
In getting away. Our contraband cargo
was known to be in town and was be
ing constantly watched by the authori
ties, so that we could not g-et it aboard.
We had a good load of provisions, but
we needed guns and pistols and pow
der and bullets.
"Finally we had to resort to strategy.
We cleared the vessel for a place in the
West Indies, sailed to sea a few days
and turned about at night and sneaked
back to within a few miles of the har
bor and sent a boat ashore.
"Everything was found to be Just as
we wished. The authorities believing
we had gone for good had left no
watchman around the building where
the ammunition was stored, and the
night was as dark as pitch. We hired
a tug, and in less than one hour we had
inir stuff aboard. The rest was easy.
The munitions of war were put on
board our vessel at Bea and the tug
sneaked back to her moorings without
even waking up the policeman. We
then went to the port for which we had
clrared, dumped a few sacks of rice on
the dock, authenticated our papers and
cleared for the place from which we
had started.
"Hut we didn't go straight back
there. We went around by Cuba and a
quiet little cove that we knew of and
where we were sure a group of insur
gents would be waiting to receive the
supplies we had on board.
"We had almost reached the cove
when a Spanish gunboat saw us; and
we had to put back to sea. It was a
lively chase, but we managed to keep
ahead of her. At dark we turned about
and made a circle of about a hundred
miles, so- that we reached the cove ear
ly the next morning.
"We landed our stuff all right. While
we were at work we peeped through
the trees and saw the Spanish gunboat
that had chased us the day before go
steaming slowly back, most likely pon
dering where we were.
"On this expedition it was necessary
for me to join the land party to
convey the goods to the insurgent
camp. The trip was one long series of
skirmishes. There was fighting nearly
every day, and one day I missed my
companions and was captured by the
Spaniards-
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
"Some of the soldiers wanted to shoot
me at once, but others said it would
be necessary to go through the proper
form and "try" nic first. This was to
be done in the morning.
"That night I managed to get one
hand and arm loose, grab a sword from
the guard as he passed me and lay him
out before he knew what struck him.
I then cut my feet loose and made my
way to my companions.
"We finally got our goods safely to
the insurgent camp. On the way back
to the steamer, which was waiting for
us in the cove, I saw some of the most
awful sights that ever any man beheld.
The Spanish soldiers had just been over
the trail and their way was marked by
horror. The sights were positively too
horrible to describe. Whenever I re
member them I have an overpowering
feeling for revenge.
"We got back to our boat all right
and soon reached the United States,
and tied up at our old wharf as inno
cently as could be.
"On the next filibustering expedition
there was more trouble in getting away.
We could have got our cargo easily
enough, but a close watch was kept on
our boat, as the authorities were now
positive of the business we were en
gaged in. But there was not a particle
of proof against us.
"This time our captain thought it ne
cessary to go into drydock, and when
we got there our contraband cargo was
secretly waiting for us. It did not take
us long to get it aboard and get back
to the wharf. The officers were at the
wharf watching us closely and exam
ined every package we took on board.
They did not know that the contraband
stuff was already stored in the hold.
"The rest of our trip was much like
our preceding ones. We landed our
cargo, took it inland, did the usual
amount of fighting and got away
safely.
"On our fourth expedition I was cap
tured again. This time we loaded our
vessel and got away without any
trouble. We even reached our landing
place all right and had part of our
cargo ashore. Then suddenly we saw
a Spanish gunboat heading for us and
knew that our only hope lay in putting
out to sea and making a run for it.
This was on June 17, 1896.
"Leaving all but fourteen of our
crew of forty-one to guard the cargo
we Bteered for the open sea and suc
ceeded in keeping out of range for
about seven miles. Then we had to
surrender or be sunk. So we surren
dered and were taken to Matanzas
and thrown into horrible dungeons.
"After being ironed in Matanzas for
about two weeks we were taken to
Morro Castle, where we found things
even worse. Each man was kept alone
constantly in the dark, damp cells, un
ventllated and without any plumbing.
We were given no bedding whatever
and cleanliness was absolutely impos
sible. We were forced to simply live in
filth.
"While imprisoned here our only food
was tortillas and foul water. Every
day the guards came in to tie us so
the head guard could venture in and
inspect us. This individual had a habit
of prodding me with his sword and I
carry several wounds to-day, the result
of his cruelty.
"Just let me ever lay hands on him
while I am able to defend myself. I
wilj have revenge to the utmost.
"Through some diplomatic arrange
ment all we prisoners were sent to
Madrid, the intention being to try us
over there and do the executing in the
presence of the people so as to make
a general impression that the adminis
tration was really doing something in
the Cuban war.
"But for some reason the trial never
came off. Nor were we allowed com
munication with the outside world.
We asked to see the American Minis
ter, but were only laughed at for mak
ing the request.
"We lay in this Madrid prison for
months, each day our hopes growing
less and less. But we were not with
out friends and they were working
strenuously for us all the while. Cuban
friends were doing all in their power to
free us. They did not resort to any
diplomacy either.
"In this case our good angel was a
young Cuban girl named Leila Moreita.
At the time she was only 19 years old
and filled with enthusiasm for the free
dom of her country. No work was too
hazardous for her and be it said she
has never failed yet.
"In order to release us her first work
was to go to Madrid, where she was a
perfect stranger, and find out our
whereabouts. She passed herself off
as a young girl from the country and
nobody suspected that she was not
Spanish.
"After locating our prison she pro
ceeded to get acquainted with our
guards. With the night watch she be
name very friendly and often came tÂ»
the prison at night to have a chat with
him.
"He pointed out our cells. When she
had all the information she desired
she laid her plans.
"One night she visited him and after*
a short time bid him good-by. Ha
thought she had left the prison, but she
only went down the corridor and con
cealed herself in a corner. There she
waited until the guard, as Spanish
guards will, bobbed his head and fell
into a doze.
. "Then Leila stole up gently and held
a bottle of chloroform under his nose.
In a few moments he was stupefied.
"Hastily taking the keys from thÂ»
senseless guard our brave deliverer
soon unlocked the prison doors and led
us out to liberty. She had everything
prepared for us. and soon had us safely
and comfortably housed.
"Of course, our escape was discov
ered the next day. The guard was
sent to prison for a number of years.
Xo particular search was made for us
because a steamer for America had left
the very night we escaped from the
prison, and it was thought we were
surely on board.
'"So we were forced to make quite a
visit in Madrid. We left the city un
der assumed names and in the most
public manner.
"It was thought best that I should
not go back to Cuba, so I was sent to
Central America, where I remained for
some time. I afterward went to the
City of Mexico, where I worked several
months and earned enough money to
come to the United States. My face
became so well known to the Spanish
authorities that it was considered im
possible for me to do any more work
for Cuba on .the island, and it wai
decided that I should wait awhile. I
worked in Los Angeles and also In
San Diego. I was in San Diego when
war was declared some weeks ago.
About this time I heard that my de
liverer, Leila Moreita, was in Patos
Negas, Mexico, where she is to remain
until Cuba becomes a republic, so that
she can get the reward she deserves.
"When America called for volunteers
to free Cuba you may be sure I lost
no time in enlisting. I came to San
Francisco the first thing. I hope that
we will soon be fighting, for when that
time comes I will get revenge for what
I have suffered at the hands of th%
Spaniards."18
THE WAR SPIRIT TOLD IN LETTERS AND ANECDOTES
AMONG the gallant gunners of
the Olympia, Dewey's flagship
before Manila, is Frank Lock
ridge. Any act of bravery he
may perform will merely live up
to the traditions of his family, as his
father was an officer in the War of the
Rebellion. He distinguished himself
when the blockade was run at the
siege of Vicksburg. At the same time
three of his uncles were fighting in the
ranks for their country.
Aside from this showing for the
males of Lockridge's ancestry, the fe
male side has distinguished Itself in
martial events. His aged gr wdmother,
a resident of this city, rendered valu
able service to the nation by bearing,
at the risk of her life, information to
our Government during the entire pe
riod of the Civil War. She calmly re
lates such experiences as riding seven
miles through the cold of a wintry
night, upon a race horse never before
ridden by a woman, to carry valuable
news to the Governor of the State, by
which a great calamity to the land was
averted.
She also tells of anxious moments
upon Ohio River mail steamers and
flag boats, when rifle balls from the
shore whistled uncomfortably close to
those on b ,rd; or the strife for su
premacy which war often breeds even
among compatriots, made quarters in
the cabin even unsafe for peaceful
passengers.
"I never carried papers," she said,
when the risk of bearing information
between the two armies was men
tioned.
"With a good memory one can carry
dates, the names of places as well as
plans in their head, and nobody is go
ing to swear to what you are thinking
or Just what you are going to tell."
When asked what she thought of the
present declaration of war, she replied:
"It was the only thing to be done, as I
told my family when we heard of the
Maine outrage. They took it quietly
and said they didn't think there would
be war â that President McKlnley
would never approve it.
"We don't care whether he does or
not!" I said. "We shan't ask President
MrKinley's permission for everything.
Where will the United States be in the
annals of history if she doesn't go to
war after this insult? Benedict Ar
nold's shame will be nothing compared
to that of our whole nation! Her dis
grace will not be lived down in six gen
erations to come. But my country has
lived up to my expectations of her; she
has done the only thing possible under
the circumstances.
"Admiral Dewey's victory is the most
glorious victory ever known. There is
but one that will compare with it in
my estimation â that of General Jack
son at New Orleans over Sir Edward
Packenham's British troops in 1815.
"I have always felt proud to think
that I once met and shook hands with
that grre^t hero. General Jackson,
though at the time I was a very little
girl and paid for the honor with a se
vere whipping.
â¢When I heard that he would past,
through Steubenville, which was then
my home, on his way up the Ohio River
as he journeyed to Washington, I felt
as much interest as any of the grown
people.

to receive the admiring citizens of the
towns he passed, and understanding
that a reception would be given upon
WHAT THE AMERICAN AND SPANISH CARTOONISTS THINK OF THE WAR.
SPANISH CARTOONISTS
Draw
AMERICANS AS PIGS.
ALLi the cartoons here depleted are
from recent Spanish papers pub
lished either Jn Madrid or Barce
lona. The cartoonists of Spain
always represent America as a
hog.
In one cartoon It will be seen, for In
stance, Uncle Sam Is represented
threatening Spain by sending the ship
Maine to Havana, whereupon Spain
turns to take revenge and Uncle Sam
runs away in the shape of a hog. In
another cartoon the American hog is
impersonated by Minister Woodford.
while the Spanish nation takes the
form of a dove with the head of Senor
Gullon, the Foreign Minister.
In another cartoon President McKln
ley is represented as a hog dressed in
the stars and stripes, attempting in a
treacherous and cowardly manner to
stab the Spanish lion through the bars
of a cage.
Another cartoon represents America
In the form of a hog mingling In the
gay throng and making advances to
Spain, represented as a fair lady.
The cartoons are a fair sample of the
Spanish wit expended on the present
relations betweeen the two countries.
\ his boat to the people of our town I
i begged my mother to take me to see
! him.
"Not understanding my Inborn admi
ration for heroism my mother laughed
! at the idea and s said*'no.'
"But tot though I was I made up my
mind that see General Jackson I would.
; So when the day of his arrival came I
: said nothing further to my mother and
j stole out of the house, but took good
! care that she did not see me cross the
| square toward the river.
"When I reached the river I saw that
two flatboats were already busy, one
carying and another bringing back
from the military vessel the people who
were bent on shaking hands with the
old soldier.
"I kept with the crowd going out,
and young as I was my heart thrilled
at the thought of seeing him.
"In those days village children went
barefoot in the summer, and as I had
to get out of my mother's sight with
out exciting her suspicion, I wasn't
dressed up for the occasion and had on
neither bonnet nor shoes. But I didn't
give a thought to my dress. I was
busy thinking about getting near the
great tall man, who stood surrounded
by his staff, and of shaking his hand
as I saw the others doing.
"At last my turn came.
"I think I remember the occasion
better because Black Abe, one of the
town water-carriers, went up just be
fore me with his little son and intro
duced him to the general as his name
sake, Andrew Jackson Abraham
Moore.
"As I had no proud parent there to
introduce me, after Black Abe moved
on, I caught hold of the big hand and
craned my little neck to get a good
look at the man towering so far above
me.
"I saw a lean, tanned face, with a
pair of sharp eyes, which glanced
down into mine from under bushy eye
brows as he slightly smiled.
"Whether he had smiled or frowned
it would have been all the same to me,
for I had seen a hero, and in the coun
try there wasn't a happier child than I
all day long, though I did go barefoot
and carried on mv back smarting rec
ollection of a hard switching."
"Now I'm a grandmother, but the
scene is as fresh in my mind as though
it had occurred yesterday. My grandson
is on board the Olympia before Manila,
fighting for his country. I think of
him a good deal, of course, and I pray
for him. I know that he is in the
hands of the Lord and that he is doing
his duty, as every American should.
"My one regret is that I am too old
to be of further service to my country,
for apart from the watch I kept upon
its interests I nursed many of our
boys back to health, tending them as
though they were my own. I have had
dozens of grateful letters from them
long after I had forgotten even their
names.
HOW COMPANY G
OF THE SIXTH LEFT
BAKERSFIELD.
The following letter received by a
lady residing in this city from her sis
ter residing in Bakersfleld well illus
trates the spirit actuating Americans,
young and old alike, in the pending
contest:
SUNDAY, May 8, 1898.
Dear Sister: Well, this is the day of
days. Our boys have gone to the war.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
Company G, Sixth Regiment, recruits,
left this a. m. It truly was exciting.
I 11 tell it in pieces.
We stayed in town last evening and
went with Mrs. Taylor and others and
decorated the cars the boys were to go
in with bunting and flags on the in
side and nailed big banners the full
length of the car, with the words.
Company G, Sixth Regiment, Ba
kersfleld," on it. We got home about
12 o clock, and then went out early
this morning to put the flowers in. The
train pulled out at 7 o'clock, and we
got up at 5. About a dozen went out*
to decorate.
At 6 o'clock all the bells in town
were rung and all the whistles blown,
so the people would wake up.
Ihere was a Jam of people at the de
pot. Three bands, the regular one, the
juvenile band and the colored band.
Between them, they kept musio going
all the time.
When word came to town that the
boys were called out, the town people
took up a collection and bought them
a beautiful silk flag. Lawyer Lock
hart presented it while the boys stood
'uncovered." Captain Cook replied for
the company. It was a very broken
and disjointed speech, but all the gaps
were rilled with lusty cheers, for every
one was feeling the strain of the
good-bxs, and anything to make a
noise and relieve the feelings was
welcomed.
The captain is very popular with the
boys. The Governor offered him a
commission as lieutenant of artillery
under Major Rice (did you know he
had gone?) which pays better and is
very much easier than captain of in
fantry, but he declined and requested
that he be allowed to keep his com
mand of Company G. Isn't that kind
of nice?
The boys cheered and cheered and
the bands played and every one shook
hands with every one %lse and said
"Good-by!" "Good luck!" "Don't stop
any Spanish bullets!" "God bless yju: "
The mothers and sisters and wives
were red-eyed but smiling, and every
one did her best.
Every one looked kind of dewy, and
mamma shed copious teurs of sym
pathy. The boys felt gay and then a
trifle dewy, too, when they looked at
their mothers, and once or twice I saw
tears when they said the last good
bys, which we hastily swallowed as
unsoldierly.
I knew the boys would hate to be
cried over, so I determined that not
one drop of brine should come from
an excess of sympathy on my part, so
the result was that I had a very nice
time. The boys all stood around and
talked to me and we laughed and sung
snatches that the band played, but
there was so much noise we couldn't
hear' ourselves. Claude Blodgett says
they'll "never kill him, not while
there's anything to hide behind," etc.,
and every one tried to say something
witty, and if they didn't succeed, it
didn't matter, for it went just as well.
Percy and Rush Blodgett are under
age and they are so mad at their
father because he wouldn't consent
for them to go that they can hardly
live. They are perfectly green with
envy of Claude. Percy related in a
very disgusted tone when I was talk
ing to him this morning that a little
girl about six years old said to him:
'â¢You great, big, lazy boy, why don't
you go to war like your brother?"
Charlie Ward and Bert Colton have
gone.
The one I felt sorriest for was Mabel
Blodgett. Charlie has enlisted, and
they've only been married a month.
She wasn't crying, but she looked too
pale and miserable for any use, and
trying to laugh it off all the time. If
I had had time for a tear it would
have been then.
While the boys were drawn up to
receive the flag, she stood right facing
him, and she never moved her eyes
from his face, and then the captain
said there would be a few minutes for
good-bys before they went aboard,
but told the men not to break rank.
Charlie held out his hand to her and
she just came flying. He put his arms
around her and I looked the other
way. It didn't do any good, however,
to look the other way, for every one
else was doing the same thing. George!
There Is the tear now, but it was
really enough to make any one wee
to see her face.
We didn't have any one to shake
. hands with; we'd done it all before,
and that part was rather painful to
see, so we walked up to the west end,
way up by the express office, so as to
wave as they pulled out. When they
were all on board, people began hurry
ing along down the track to wave
good-by.
While we were standing there I saw
a cute pup, and I said to George Me
Leod, "Steal that pup and give it to
them for a mascot.
There was a little boy there and
George asked him if it was his. The
kid (about six years old), said yes,
and George asked him if he could put
it on the train, and the kid grabbed
the dog and hugged it close and said
"No-o-o!"
No more was said to him. but he
heard us talking about they're not
having a mascot, etc., and so just as
the train started by us (it went very
slowly on account of the crowd), the
kid pulled George's coat and held up
the pup and said; "Here, you, put it
on, quick. I can't reach. Give 'em
my dog for a mascot."
George grabbed the dog and yelled
in a voice they could all hear, "Boys,
the kid wants you to take his pup for
a mascot."
The boys all reached for it and
yelled, "We'll take it." "Hurrah for
the kid." "Bully for you, Johnny,"
and as they went out of sight they
were waving flags out the windows
and one fellow had the pup by the
back of the neck holding him out for
every one to see, and everybody
cheered and yelled, and . the band
played' The Girl I Left Behind Me."
That pup is the right kind of a
mascot, all right. The fellow had him
by the back of the neck and was
waving him with one hand and a
flag with thÂ« other, but the pup never
Bouealod a Hit. Hf> is clear grit.
How was that for patriotism on the
kid's part? It was probably his dear
est possession; but he thought they
certainly ought to have a mascot, and
he grave It willingly, once he made up
his mind, and yelled with the rest
when they wore cheering for him.
It's wonderful how much good it
did them to cheer. ' They gave three
cheers for the flag, for Captain Cook,
for the ladies who brought the flowers.
Then the civilians gave three cheers
for Company G. for Uncle Sam and
for Captain Cook. Some Â«ne yelled,
"Remember the Maine!" and the yells
and howls that greeted that remark
would have caused the Spaniards to
turn pale if they had heard it.
It was splendid, and like the boy in
the song daddy tells about:
"I burned to wear a uniform.
Hear drums and see a battle."
Oh, dear, I am all tired out (mam
ma's upstairs asleep); but I am so
stirred up I want to have some one
to yell three cheers for something
again. I just feel thrills clrar to my
toes. I wonder why I wasn't a boy?
"O. mah honey!" I wish you had been
here. It was just I'm-ra!
As the train was pulling out some
of the boys gave me a particular "lit
tle salute. I hadn't seen Bert Colton
to say good-by to him, and as he rode
slowly by he sang out, "Good-by
Violet." and I said. "Good-by Bert "'
though I doubt if he heard In all the
noise and shouting; but we nodded and
waved and smiled.
Kenneth, who is a sergeant, was
riding on thÂ« step and I was standing
a little buck in the crowd. I'd given
him some beautiful red roses, and he
had them pinned "where he wantid
the bullets to be scarce," that is, over
his heart. And when he rode by he
waved at me, pointed to his flowers,
nipped one off the stem and threw it
back to me and waved and waved and
smiled and tried to make me hear his
yells above the rest. Isn't that fun?
Claude Blndgett waved his flag and
shouted, "We'll lick 'em now, sure."
Winston Spencer from Tehachapi
had no one to say good-by to, so I was
especially nice to him (which, I guess,
surprised him. for I never talked to
him before), but he seemed especially
pleased and waved his cap as Me went
by and shouted, "Tell 'em goo4-by at
the Summit."
There's no use in trying to tell It all,
for things lapped over each other in
happening and all came fast. Anyway,
I expect this is all I have stamps to
carry, and you're probably a wreck
from trying to read It.
Don't expect anything rational from
me for some days.
Love and love to my sister.
VIOLET.
WANT TO FIGHT
FOR THEIR COUNTRY,
HERE are two letters written by
two American lads who are
wildly ambitious to be right at
the front in the present war. One
of these boys is at the front and
the other hopes to get there at an early
date if his father will only consent to
his enlistment.
Here is his last letter to his father:
Los Angeles, April 22, 1898.
Dear Father: I am writing to
you about a very serious matter.
1 suppose you have heard that
Spain has declared war against
the United States and that the
United States cruiser Nashville
has captured the Buena Ventura,
loaded with lumber.
This State has offered a regiment
of cavalry volunteers to the United
States Government. Mr. H. J. To
berman, son of Major Toberman,
ex-Mayor of this city, has organ
ized or rather is organizing a troop
of cavalry from the High School
to go with this regiment. Mr. To
berman has graduated from a mili
tary college and has served as cap
tain in a company of cavalry for
a year and a half.
The boys will serve for the war
with Spain or for three years. They
will elect Mr. Toberman captain
and have some other reliable men
for officers. General Jones, an ex-
Confederate officer, who has some
thing to do with the regiment â I
think he is raising it â left for Sac
ramento yesterday to see Gov
ernor Budd, who is a special friend
of his, politically and otherwise. He
will give the regiment the first
chance at the first call for volun
teers.
The boys in the company Mr. To
berman has got up are all High
School boys, and I know most of
them; they are of good character.
Claire Umsted, our neighbor on
Houver street, for one has joined.
When the first call for volunteers
comes the cavalry will go to Chiek
amauga and will there receive
horses, uniforms, arms, drill, etc.
Tin y will most likely be along the
Atlantic coast.
I WANT TO ENLIST WITH
THIS COMPANY OF CAVALRY
FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL.
Father, I am in earnest. I wish
you were here and could see me. I
have thought the matter all over
and know what I am talking about.
The kind Lord has my life all
mapped out, and I will have to die
some place some time; only he
knows where and when. If it is his
will that I should die serving my
country instead of at home with
the family I am perfectly willing.
It will be a great disappointment
to me if you do not give your con
sent. If I get yours I am sure I
can get mamma's.
I think thnt you would be will-
Ing to sacrifice at least one out of
eight for your country. I won't go
expecting to be killed, but will make
the best of things. I don't go ex
pecting to have a picnic at the ex
pense of Uncle Sam, but will go
prepared to enuure hardships.
Mr. Toberman says that I can
enter even if I am under 18 with
parents' consent. I am 16 years
old now and I have the size and
constitution of a boy of 19. The
boys are most all 18 or 19 years old.
I suppose you will hate to let me
go. but when you think why I am
going and who I am going for you
will let me go.
Claire Umsted asked his father
and he said "Yes. I am glad to see
you want to go," or something to
that effect. I will havo everything
furnished by the Government, in
cluding all the hardtack, pork,
bacon, beans and coffee that I
want. I will get $13 per month. I
would a great deal rather be in the
cavalry than in the infantry, be
cause it is lighter duty and no
marching on foot. You can write
to Mr. H. J. Toberman, 613 South
Pearl street, and get particulars.
I want an answer immediately, if
possible, because the volunteers
may be called out very soon, and I
want to be with them and help
represent the Los Angeles High
School. I do hope you will let me
go. I have made this solemn prom
ise before God and signed the
pledge that I will never drink a
drop of liquor. I intend to live up
to that promise in the future as I
have in the past. I will not forget
my Bible.
Last night I went down to River
station to see the First Regiment
of United States troops. They
didn't get in till 11 and I didn't get
home tiâ half-past 12 on acount of
the crowded cars. They said it
took them 26 hours to come
from San Francisco. There were
three trains of them of about
twenty cars each. The band
played all the patriotic songs and
played them well, too.
Hoping that you -will consent to
my enlisting in such good company
and in such good cause, I remain,
Your loving LUCIUS.
P. S.â REMEMBER THE MAINE,
and excuse poor writing, because
I have had two examinations this
afternoon and have written a good
deal.
I will earn as much money there
as in the city and will send money
home.
Here is the letter from the other lad
to his mother. He is an apprentice on
board the Petrel, that same little gun
boat that did such heroic service in the
late gTeat naval battle at Manila. The
letter was written when the vessel lay
at Hongkong, while rumors of ap
proaching war were in the air and be
fore Admiral Dewey sailed south to
carry out the order, "Find and take or
destroy the Spanish fleet."
HONGKONG, April 3, IS9B.
Dear Mother: "Rumors of war
and rumors of war." That is the
way things are on board the
Petrel. We are as well prepared
as we can be and could go to sea
at a minute's notice. The com
modore is anxiously awaiting the
outcome of affairs in the United
States. Our fleet is daily expected
to be re-enforced by the Baltimore
and maybe the Oregon.
The Reuter telegrams are about
as reliable as the . We raised a
nice subscription for the Maine
relief fund â I don't know how
much, but I think $1500 would not
miss it far.
England, Japan and Russia are
having quite a bit of trouble in
the Far East. Russia wants the
whole province of Manchuria.
It was reported that a Japanese
cruiser fired on a Russian ship in
Taiien Wan Bay. A Russian man
of-war sent a boat over to find out
the reason, which was given them,
and both captains agreed not to
commence hostilities until the Czar
and Mikado were notified. The
news was suppressed as much as
possible. I see Old Krauth. It is
very disagreeable and unhandy to
be kept In suspense like we are. All
the news we g-et are the Reuter
telegrams, and they are very
short. The Chinese papers don't
pretend to write up any news ex
cept local brevities. We were ex
amined for the quarter and I was
the top one.
The Concord is alongside of us
and I can see many people I know.
My inability to write a letter is
plainly evident in this epistle. All
we hear are rumors, and I don't
like to write about them, as a
sailor's imagination is something
wonderful. When the ship's cook
shines the coppers he is liable to
find out wonderful things pertain
ing to the topics of me day, or
when the leadsman hauls up
lead" many a strange tale clings to
the lead line, and when the helms
man turns the wheel the spokes are
always sure to tell him what is
happening in other parts of the
club Vessels sunk, nations at war,
rulers killed, etc.â all come to these
jolly boys as easy as falling off a
I hope this letter will find you In
good health. Your
HONGKONG. March 20, 2M&
Dear Mother: At present things
look as if some trouble was brew
ing. We have been divided off for
landing parties in case of bombard
ment. So many men to land and
so many to work the guns aboard
the ship.
The chief quartermaster and I
are detailed to send and receive
signals. Everything is dull or\
board the ships, as lots of changes
will be made when the Olympia
and Boston go home, and many of
the men would like to go home in
one of thorn. The Olympia will un
doubtedly leave when the war
cloud blows over and the Boston
about three months after.
Prince Henry is receiving all
kinds of banquets. The Deutsch
land has gone into the drydock at
Kowloon, just across from here.
The Gaelic is expected in here
Wednesday and we will read all
about the Maine affair. When you
write to Sally send her my love*
also regards "to Jim and Baby. I
would like to be in the country for
a change myself. These Chinese
cities are dead, no life at all in
them. I am trying to think of
something to write, but can't. Tell
Ed I think of him oft^n and won
der how he is getting along at
school. I am getting an idea in
my head that I should like to be a
Thespian, but have sense enough to
know that all the acting I would
ever be able to do would be to col
lect tickets at the door.
March 22.
The Raleigh has just challenged
the Olympia to a cutter race. There
may be an international regatta
soon. Mail closes to-night, so I
will finish. Your loving son
VERD.
HONGKONG, April 3, 189 S.
Dear Ed: If the excitement In
the United States is half its great
as it is here I suppose all the boys
are talking of fighting.
It is not so much fun as one
would think standing behind a
large gun when she is tired. You
think your head is flying off, and
the concussion makes you dizzy
until you get used to it. Just at
present I don't know where our
next destination will be, but I
would like to go to Yokohama.
Your loving brother,
VERD.
Up to March 23, 4060 Klondlko miners*
licenses to prospectors (mostly from tha
United States) had been issued at tho

The cash receipts therefor were $45.600 '
and the cost being less than 3 per cent.'
the remainder of this sum was turned

READ THIS AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE DIFFER
ENCES BETWEEN BATTLE-SHIPS, CRUISERS,
MONITORS AND THE "UNTRIED WON
DERS" OF THE SEA.
IT is a question, in spite of the fam
iliarity of the public with the tech
nical phraseology of the warship,
whether the average reader has a
very accurate idea of the distinc
tions between the various classes of
ships and between the various ele

ments from the combination of which
these ships derive their distinctive
ciass characteristics.
He is told that the Indiana is a bat
tle-ship, the Brooklyn an armored
cruiser, the Columbia a protected
cruiser, and the Puritan a monitor.
But it is probable that he has only a
vague idea as to what qualities it is
that mark the distinction, or why the
distinction should need to exist at all.
These diagrams and a perspective
drawing which show the constructive
features of the several types of war
ship have been prepared to answer
these questions.
In diagrams 1 to 3 the armor is in
dicated by full black lines or by shad
ing, the approximate thickness of the
armor being shown by the thickness of
the lines and the depth of the shading.
The fine line represents the unarmored
portions or the ordinary plating of the
ships. In the perspective view the ar
mor is shown by full lines and shading
and the ordinary ship plating by dotted
lines.
When the naval architect sits down
at his desk to design a warship of a
certain size he knows that there is one
element of the vessel which is fixed
and unalterable, and that is her dis
placement. By displacement is meant
the actual weight of the ship, which is,
of course, exactly equal to the weight
of water which she displaces. This to
tal weight is the capital with which the
architect has to work, and he uses his
judgment in distributing it among the
various elements which go to make up
the ship. Part is allotted to the hull,
part to the motive power, part to the
armor protection, part to the fuel,
stores, furnishing and general equip
ment.
It is evident that the allotment of
weights is a matter of compromise â
whatever excess is given to one element
must be taken from another, else the
ship will exceed the given displace
ment. Among the elements above
mentioned there are some, such as the
weight of hull, provisions, stores and
furnishings, which for a given size of
ship will not vary greatly. There are
other elements, such as guns, armor,
engines and fuel supply which may
vary considerably in different ships,
according to the type of vessel that is
produced. .
If, for instance, th > architect is de
signing an extremely fast ship of type
No 1, which has a sp "d of twenty
three knots, he will have to allot such
a large amount of weight to the motive
power that he will only be able to give
the ship very slight armor protection
and a comparatively light battery of
guns. If he wishes to produce a fast
ship that shall be more heavily armed
and armored he has to be content with
Ipps gpeed, say twenty or twenty-one
knots, as in No. 2. and the weight so
saved on the motive nower appears in
the shape of a side belt of armor at the
water line, more complete protection
for the guns in the shape of barbettes
and turrets and considerably heavier
armament. If, again, he desires to pro
duce a .Â«hip capable of contending with
the most powerful ships in line of bat
tle, as in No. 3, he is content with much
lower speed, say sixteen or seventeen
knots an hour, and he increases the
â¢ of his guns until they weigh
over sixty tons apiece, and pro
tects them with great redoubts and
turrets of steel one and a half feet
thick, besides protecting his water line
in the region of the and boilers
with a belt of steel of the same dimen
sions.
The swift and lightly armed and ar
mored ship is known as a protected
cruiser; the less speedy but more heav
lly armed and armored ship belongs to
the armored cruiser type, and the slow
est ship, with its capacity for taking
and giving the heaviest blows that
modern guns can inflict, is known as a
battle-ship.
In the construction of a warship the
two qualities of attack and defense
have to be supplied. The offensive
powers are furnished by the guns, tor
pedoes, etc.
Now it can readily be understood that
all this amount of heavy armor and
gunÃ adds greatly to the weight of the
ship, and for this reason, in spite of
her smaller engine power, a first-class
It will be seen that all that part of
battle-ship rarely displaces less than
10,000 tons, and in some foreign navies
the displacement runs up to nearly 16,
000 tons. This will be understood by
reference to the perspective view,
where the armored portions of the ship
are indicated by full lines and shading,
the ordinary shell plating being dotted.
the ship lying below the water line is
shut in by a continuous roof of steel
which is three inches in thickness for
ward and aft of the bulkheads. Over
the central armored citadel it is two
and three-quarter inches thick. All the
plating indicated by dotted lines might
be shot away without the 'vitals" suf
fering injury or the ship being sunk.
The reader will see that it is its loftier
sides and the extra deck and freeboard
which they provide which constitute
practically the difference between a
battle-ship and a monitor.
This brings us to the consideration
of the monitor type. Take away from
a battle-ship all that portion which is
shown in our drawing in dotted lines
above the water line; lower the bar
bettes until they rise only a few feet
above the steel deck, and we have a
ship of the general monitor type. The
monitor is distinguished by very low
freeboard â only a tew inches in the ex
treme type â the absence of a heavy
secondary battery and the possession
of a main armament of heavy guns.
Such a ship labors heavily in bad
weather and is not intended for ser
vice at any distance from the coasts.
To make a seagoing vessel out of her
it would be necessary to add one, or
even two decks, placing the guns well
up above the water, after which
changes she would be no longer moni
tor, but seagoing battle-ship.
In the cruiser type the protective
deck does not extend across the ship
at one level, but curves down to meet
the hull at a point several feet below
the water line. This sloping portion
is made thicker than the flat portion,
as in diagram No. 11, where the deck
is three inches thick on the flat and six
inches on the slopes. In the case of
the armored cruisers, a belt of vertical
armor is carried at the water line and
in all cruisers the V-shaped space be
tween belt and sloping deck is filled in
with coal or with some form of water
excluding material, such as cornpith
cellulose.
In diagram 11, which represents the
fine armored cruiser Brooklyn, it will
be seen that before it could reach the
engine-room a shell would have to pass
through three inches of vertical stee!,
about six feet of coal and six inches or
inclined armorâ a total resistance equal
to fourteen or fifteen inches of solid
steel. The guns and turning gear are
protected by five and one-half inch steel
turrets and eight-inch barbettes. The
barbettes, it will be seen, do not ex
tend continuously down to the armored
deck, as in the battle-ship, for this
would require a greater weight of
armor than can be allowed. Conse
quently, the architect is only able to
furnish the guns with a small armor
plated tube for protecting the ammuni
tion in its passage from the magazines
to the barbettes.
In the protected cruiser the side ar
mor at the water line disappears alto
gether, and dependence is placed en
tirely upon the sloping sides of the pro
tective deck, the water excluding cel
lulose and the 6 or 8 feet of coal which
is stowed in the bunkers in the wake of
the engines and boilers. The barbettes,
turrets and armored ammunition tubes
of the armored cruiser disappear, and
their place is taken by comparatively
light shields and casements of four
inch steel which serve to protect the
gun crews.
It will be seen from the above de
scription that each class of vessel is
only fitted to engage ships of its own
type The protected cruiser Colum
bia (No. 1) might, with her light 6 and
4 inch guns, hammer away all day at
the Indiana (No. 3) without being able
to do much more than knock the r-gint
off the latter's 18-inch armor, whereas
one well directed shot from the 13-inch
guns of the Indiana would be sufficient
to sink or disable the Columbia. The
Brooklyn would fare better, and at
close range her 8-inch guns might hap
pen to penetrate the belt or turret ar
mor of the Indiana, but the Issue of the
duel would never be in doubt for an in
stant. A Columbia or a Brooklyn
would show its heels to an Indiana or
Massachusetts, and their great speed
would give them the option of refusing
or accepting battle with almost any
craft that is afloat upon the seas to-

tion of warships, are somewhat flexible.
We may find a battle-ship like the 12,
320-ton Yashima (Japanese), with a
trial speed of 19*4 knots. On the other
hand, we see cruisers like the Viscaya
(Spanish), with a 12-inch belt and car
rying heavy guns of 11-inch caliber.
The battle-ship and the cruiser of a
modern navy hold the same mutual re
lation as the three-decker and the swift
frigate in the days of the Bailing ship.
When a fleet set sail in the olden days
to find the enemy and bring him to bat
tle upon the high seas, the heavy and
somewhat slow line-of-battle ships
kept together in a methodical forma
tion, while the fr'~ates cruised at a dis
tance of several miles, where they could
report the first appearance of the en
emy and signal to the main fleet his
position and maneuvers. When the
main fleet had been brought within
striking distance, the brunt of the bat
tle fell upon the three-deckers.
To-day the swift protected cruiser
will perform the same duties for the
heavily armored and more cumbrous
battle-ships. When the attack takes
place it will be the battle-ships and ar
mored cruisers that will decide the is
sue. Hence the battle-ships will con
stitute a nation's main line of offense
and defense upon the sea. A cruiser
will avoid engagement with a battle
ship â it will be no disgrace to her if she
shows it a clean pair of heels, trusting
to h<=r great speed for safety; for she
could neither hope to pierce the armor
nor resist the great guns of the heavier
ship.
The battle-ship is built to fight. It
is designed with this sole object in
view, and it must be prepared to fight
at any time, and if need be against big

equally great powers of resistance.
: There has been only one great naval
fight between modern warshipsâ the
battle of the Yalu, -between Japanese
and Chinese fleets â and the : most, by
far the most, important fact developed
by that engagement was the correct
ness of the theories upon which mod
ern battle-ships are designed.. The
brunt of the Japanese attack fell upon
two somewhat antiquated battle-ships,
the Ting Yuen and Chen Yuen, and for
several hours the swift Japanese cruis- ;
ers circled around these two grim ships
of war, pouring in a perfect hail of
rapid-fire shells, with occasional shells
from their great 66-ton guns; yet the
two battle-ships came out of the fight
with their armor and big guns practi
cally intact. The same deadly concen
tration of '< shell-fire would have sunk
a whole fleet of cruisers. Had the Chi
nese battle-ships been manned by bet
ter crews the Yalu would have had an
other ending.
The new navy, of the United States is
relatively strong in battle-ships. We
have now twelve first-class ships of this
type either built, building or author
ized. Four, the Indiana, Massachusetts,
Oregon and lowa, are in commission;
two, the Kentucky and Kearsarge, are
launched; three, the Alabama, Illinois
and Wisconsin, are about half com
pleted, and three others are authorized.
A battle-ship, as we have already
shown, is essentially a fighting ma
chine, and when the designer haa given
her sufficient structural and armored
protection to enable her to take her
place in the first line of battle, his next
object is to arm her with as many ar
mor-piercing and rapid-fire guns as the
limits of her displacement will allow.
Judged by this double standard, the In
diana is without a rival; for it is a fact
which has never been disputed that she
carries the heaviest armament of any
ship afloat to-day. This preponderance
of power is due to the eight 8-inch guns
which are carried in four turrets flank
ing the two turrets of the 13-inch guns.
They are an entirely novel feature in
battle-ship design, and may be called
the chief distinctive feature of this
ship. The accepted type of battle-ship
carries usually a main battery of four
heavy guns disposed in two turrets,
fore and aft, supplemented by a broad
side secondary battery- of 5 or 6 inch
guns, the first being capable of piercing
armor and the latter being used against
the lightly armored or unarmored por
tions of the enemy.
Thus the Camperdown of the British
navy, a ship of the same size as the In
diana, and less effectively protected,
carries four 67-ton guns of about the
same power as the heavy guns of the
American ship and a secondary battery
of six 6-inch guns. Against this the In
diana carries in addition to her main
and secondary batteries the eight B
inch armor-piercing guns above men
tioned â a preponderance of power
which should give her the victory in a
naval duel.
The cruisers are the light cavalry of
the navy. As their name implies,
their duty is to cruise the seas, keep
ing in touch with the enemy's fleets
and acting as the "eyes" of the llne
cf-battle ships. They are also intend
ed for the double duty of attacking an
enemy's commerce and defending that
of the country whose flag they carry-
Fleets of merchant vessels or of trans
port ships will be "convoyed" by cruis
ers from port to port. Upon the cruis
er will devolve the duty of hunting
down, capturing or sinking the armed
merchantmen, known as auxiliary
cruisers, and the regular cruisers of
the enemy, and she must be ready at
any time to make a dash at her top
most speed with important naval dis
patches.
For these special duties she requires
to be a good seaboat with high free
board adapted for steaming at a high
rate of speed in all weathers. She
must be furnished with powerful en
gines, and her lines must be fair and
fine; she must have a large coal sup
ply, enabling her to keep to the sea for
lengthy periods; she must have ample
berthing space for a numerous crew,
some of whom will have to be placed
aboard her prizes to carry them to a
home port; and, finally, she must be
armed with a powerful battery of me
dium caliber guns, to enable her to
fight ships of her own class.
The earlier ships of our navy were
entirely of the cruiser class, and at
the present time these ships consti
tute the most numerous portion of our
fleets.
The monitors of our navy form a
connecting link between the early and
later systems of armored warship con
struction. They embody in the original
design the lessons which had been
learned in the naval operations of the
Civil War, and, as their name implies,
they are modeled after the plan of
Ericsson's famous Monitor. The chief
characteristics of this style of ship are
moderate speed, low freeboard, mak
ing them a difficult object to hit, thick
armor, and an armament of a few ex
ceptionally heavy guns. Sitting low in
the water, they are not suited for work
on the high seas, and their sphere of
operations lies within sheltered wat
ers, such as are found in our bays and
harbors. This is their proper sphere
of action, and to enable them to man
euver in shoal waters they have as lit
tle draught as possible.
Strictly speaking, they are floating
batteries, and as such they are in
tended to co-operate with the land
batteries In defense of our coasts. But
though the monitor is designed especi
ally for harbor defense, it would be
quite capable of taking part in a fleet
action off the coast in ordinary
weather.
By far the most unique ship in our
navy, and, indeed, the only craft of its
kind in the world, is the armored ram
Katahdin. The ram as a weapon of
naval warfare is one of the most an
cient of which we have any recorded
history. It was used with deadly ef
fect in the naval fights of Greece and
Rome, and in later times, as at Lissa
and during our own Civil War, it
proved a terrible engine of destruction.
The value of the ram as attached to
the huge and swiftly moving warships
of modern navies has yet to be de
termined, and many authorities claim
that the ship which uses the ram is
liable to be only less badly strained
and shaken up by the shock than her
opponent.
The Katahdin, however, was designed
for the express purpose of ramming,
and her hull has been constructed with
a view to her being able to withstand
the terrible wrench which a ship that
runs its nose at full speed into a mov
ing vessel is certain to suffer.
The Vesuvius, like the Katahdin, is
a type of vessel that is only to be
found in the United States navy. She
was designed for carrying dynamite
guns of considerable range and enor
mous power, and it is upon these that
she depends for her offensive power.
The Helena is one of three light
draught gunboats authorized in 1893.
The ship was specially designed for
service on the rivers of China, and was
originally intended for the Asiatic sta
tion. With a beam of 40 feet she
draws only 9 feet of water. Sha is
driven by twin-screw engines of 1988
indicated horsepower and her twin
screws, coupled with her large rudder
area, give her excellent turning power,
a valuable feature in river work.
While the boat was being planned a
Japanese officer happened to see the
designs, and he suggested the utility
of a conning tower of sufficient eleva
tion to overlook the banks of the Yel
low River of China, the Yang-tse-
Kiang. These banks are so high that
they exclude the view of the country
from those on an ordinary ship's deck.
The Navy Department acted on tho
hint.
One of the earliest successful at
tempts to make use of the torpedo
boat in naval warfare occurred in tho
Civil War, when the Housatonic was
sunk by a rebel craft, which paid for
its daring with its own destruction, be
ing sucked into the -hastly hole which
it had torn in the man-of-war. This
was one of the lessuns of the Civil
War which "was laid to heart by tha
European nations, and out of this and
later successful tests of the torpedo
has sprung that vast fleet of miniature
craft which forms such a formidable
feature of the equipment of the navies
of the world. The earlier boats wero
what is known as spar torpedo-boats,
from the fact that the torpedo was car
ried at the end of a long spar whicti
projected forward from the bow of tho
boat, the torpedo exnloding by con
tact. â 
Then came the automobile Whitehead
torpedo, with its ability when once dis
charged to run (JOO or 800 yards of its
own accord. The size and speed of the
torpedo boat were rapidly increased,
especially the latter, and the impor
tance of this method of attack
was instantly recognized. The torpedo
boat of twenty-five years ago with its
spar torpedo, was a diminutive affair,
having a speed of only twelve or thir
teen knots.
In 1877, however, it had grown to
have a length of from 85 to 100 4!eet and
a speed of from eighteen to twenty-one
knots. As the demand increased the
builders paid particular attention to re
duction of- weight and increase of boiler
and engine efficiency, and in 1887 tha
Ariete, built by Thornycroft for the
Spanish Government, astonished the
world by running a mile at a speed of
twenty-six knots an hour. Five years
later the Daring, a 220-ton boat, built
by Thornycroft for the British navy,
made 28.65 knots an hour, and in 1595
the Sokol, built by Yarrow for the Rus
sian Government, passed the thirty
knot limit.
The later torpedo boats are known. asi
destroyers. They are large vessels of
300 to 400 tons displacement and po<wer
ful enough to maintain their speed in
rough weather, which the torpedo boat
cannot do. They have a speed from
thirty to thirty-three knots and carry
a powerful armanent of rapid-fire guns,
the object being to enable them to
chase and sink a fleet of torpedo boats
and prevent them from attacking tha
larger ships. At the same time the de
stroyer carries a full complement of
torpedoes and would be capable of
sinking battle-ships and cruisers if sha
could get within torpedo range.
It is greatly to be regretted that In
the earlier years of our naval construc
tion we omitted to provide the navy
with an adequate torpedo fleet, as wa
are likely to suffer from lack of them.
The defect is being remedied, however,
as fast as the boats can be turned out,
and the present Congress has recom
mended the construction of thirty craft
of the kind in addition to those already
on the stocks.
The Bailey is one of three torpedo
boat catchers for which provision was
made at the last session of Congress.
The s\im appropriated for each boat
was $250,000. In advertising for bids
the Navy Department stipulated that a
speed of3o knots per hour would be ex
acted on the official course.
If we except the Porter, which is,
strictly speaking, a first-class torpedo
boat, the Bailey and her mates are the
first torpedo boat destroyers to be built
for our navy; and if the expectations of
her builders are fulfilled she will be ca
pable of a speed of 33 knots an hour.
The principal features of the designs
are: Length. 205 feet: beam, 19 feet;
depth of hold, 13 feet 5 inches: dis
placement on trial, 235 tons, and dis
placement when in commission, 265
tons.
The Bailey, like the Dupont and Por
ter, will be able to do battle with bat
tle-ships aftÂ»r the fashion of torpedo
boats. When thus engaged she will
have recourse to her torpedo tubes. But
the princir. 1 duty of the new craft will
be to drive uiT and annihilate with gun
fire the torpedo boat torments of the
battle-ships and cruisers. Speed alone
will enable the Bailey to do this, and
this speed the catcher is expected, by
reason of her size, to maintain in a
high sea.
The Bailey Is essentially a seagoing
vessel. Her bunker capacity is deemed
sufficient to enable her to steam three
thousand knots at economical speed. In
time of war she may be expected to ac
company the battle-ship fleet, and to
serve both as a scout and defense for
the heavier vessels.
It is probable that the introduction of
a successful submarine torpedo-boat
on the lines of .the Holland will mark
one of the greatest revolutions that
ever occurred in naval warfare, for
there is a general belief that a thor
oughly efficient under-water warship
would have the above-water ship at its
mercy. A submarine torpedo-boat, be
cause of its invisibility, is deadly by
day and in the openâ it will be doubly
bo by night.

THE STORY OF LIBERIA
A Republic governed by African negroes
REV. PAUL BUNGHALOW AS HE ARRIVED AT MONROVIA.
SEVERAL societies in the South
ern States are tryfrng their best to
start colonies of negroes in Mex
ico, but thus far they have not
met with very nattering success.
In discussing the recent aban
donment of one of the colonies the so
ciety overhauled the reports and the
experiences of the men who struggled
their mightiest less than fifty years ago
to found a great negro republic in Li
beria and gradually bring all of Africa
under its influence.
Toe republic of Liberia on the west
coast of Africa must bs considered as
one of the greatest philanthropic move
ments in the history of the world. The
members of the Episcopalian church,
both in the United States and England,
poured millions of dollars into the
scheme. Negro youths of both sexes
were taught trades and also the arts and
sciences. Houses, stores, schools and
churches were built for them. In fact,
a city was brought into existence in a
fertile country for their benefit. They
â¢were supplied with all needed utensils
and machinery.
For a few years the projectors of the
enterprise maintained white people
there to train the negroes for their new
duties. During this preparatory train
ing and building up things went splen
didly.
When the day came for the negroes
to assume the direction of affairs and
start nut as a nation th T'nglish Gov
ernment loaned them $500,000 and guar-
anteed independence to the new repub
lic. It seemed as if everything must go
well with the venture.
Concerning the result of the experi
ment after a fair trial the conservative
Encyclopedia Britannica in substance
e-iys:
"The experiment cm hardly be called
a success. The $500,000 EnHand lent
the republic of Liberia is still lent. Not
a penny of either principal or inttesrest
has been paid. The people have not
improved their conditions in the least
and in many instances have returned to
savagery."
Perhaps the only man in San Fran
cisco who visited the community during
its brilliant rise and pathetic lapse is
Captain George Jackson. Of the de
tails of the experiment Captain Jackson
is fully conversant, for he was in the
British navy at the time, and did a
great deal of special work aiding the
new republic.
In discussing the problem, Captain
Jackson said: "To tell all about the
African colony it is necessary to go
back to the time when a number of peo
ple in the United States and England
were interested in the humane cause of
freeing the black man and giving him
a chance to do something for himself.
About 1817 the American Colonization
Society was organized. In 1823 a tract
of country in Western Africa was se
cured, and the first batch of colored
emigrants was sent from the United
States to a point near CapeMontserado.
They left America under the most fa
vorable circumstances and auspices
and with everything needful for a
starting in colonial life.
"But the story of Liberia has an al
together different ending. The new col
onists inhabited a country of boundless
extent with a soil rich in all the most
valuable productions of the country,
and they could have controlled the re
â ources of a commerce of immense
valua to the other nations. They had
churches and schools and the opportu
nities of social intercourse and the
means of intellectual improvement.
"I visited Monrovia in 1857, just two
years after the establishment of the re
public and found the people fast retro
grading. Their once neat and well
built homes were uncared for and fast
falling into decay and ruin for the lack
of care; the churches were nearly all
closed and the school houses were used
as barns. Many of ihe people had left
Monrovia and had scattered away

among the neighboring tribes of Afri
cans even intermarrying with them,
and had adopted the old African modes
of life.
"Little or no commerce was left and
during my two months' stay on the
Liberian coast I never saw a single
trading vessel.
"Liberia has to-day become an un
known quantity.
"The people that remained had com
pletely degenerated, were unclothed
and demoralized.
"Let me tell of an individual case
which came immediately under my own
observation. In 1847, just about the
same time that Liberia was declaring
its Independence, a Spanish slaver was
captured near Havana by a British wap
vessel, and she had a car'- of three
hundred slaves on board, besides the
little son, aged about 12 years, of the
Chief of Kabenda, a few miles north of
the Congo River. The father had given
this cargo of slaves, valued at about
$50,000 in Havana, to the Spanish super
cargo as payment for the lad's educa
tion and he was to be h: ided over to
the Jesuit order for that purpose and
returned to his home in Africa in ten
years.
"Capture by the English gunboat,
however, knocked out all these plans,
and upon the arrival of the prize and
her captors at Kingston, Jamaica, the
boy was turned over to the London
Missionary Society. They themselves
undertook his education free of charge
and prepared him for missionary life.
"After the young fellow, enjoying all
the time the benefits of Caucasian so
ciety, had graduated through the
schools at Jamaica, he was sent to
England, where the finishing touches
were put upon him, ending with a
three years' college course at Oxford,
where he left a full fledged M. A., B. A..
D. D., and I don't know what besides.
"Having been ordained a" priest of thft
Anglican Church with much ceremony,
he was sent out as a missionary for the
London Missionary Society back to his
own country, where it was hoped he
would accomplish great things and es
pecially be able to convert all the slave
dealers.
"In due time the Rev. Mr. Paul Bung
halow. for that was his name, arrived
at Sierra Leone and was met on board
the mail steamer by the Right Rev
erend Bishop of Sierra Leone, whose
guest he remained during the two
weeks he had to wait until a vessel

FIGURE OUT THE DISTANCE OF THE ENEMY.
THE accuracy of modern rifled
guns is one of the wonders of en
gineering. Two experimental
shots fired a f ;w years ago at the
same elevation from the same
gun fell within thirty yards of each
other, after traversing a distance of
twelve miles. If a modern rifle is laid
upon the target, with proper cevation
and allowance for windage, it Is safe
to say the shot will find the mark.
The correct elevation of the gun can
only be determined if the distance of
the target is known, and the exact de
termination of the distance of a moving
object is a problem that has worried
the gunner ever since the day when
n.-und shot was first thrown from the
sides of the wooden fighting ship.
In the early days the determination
of the range was a matter of guess
work.
This was all very well in a day when
the guns were too feeble to do much

"I was on board the English man-of
war that took the reverend young chief
to his home. During the passage of
about ten days he performed most
zealously the duties of chaplain on
board, but the young man had been al
most completely spoiled in England,
and to Us young fellows he appeared
about as impudent and overbearing a
fellow as ever you would wish to meet.
"Arriving at Kabenda he was taken
ashore and with his belongings turned
over to the chief who was an entire
stranger to him, his own father having
died a short while after the boy was
captured by tha English gunboat.
"We left him there and took up our
regular cruise.
"On returning after two months' ab
sence the first canoe to come alongside
with chicks. -s and fruit for sale was
paddled by our 1: te acting chaplain.
"He had completely fallen back into
the habits of his tribe. He told us his
people had no use for a missionary and
had advised him to take a tumble to
himself and be a good African again.
"He took the advice of his people and
parted his raiment among them. He
had given away all his clothes and
kept only a silk hat for his own wear.
He made his appearance in canoe with
this 'Oxford' plug hat on apd a white
shirt for a pair of breeches, buttoned
behind, while another of his company
wore only the clerical coat and an old
naval cocked hat on his head.
"Poor Bunghalow never got anything
more from his English friends, as they
gave him up for a bad job.

would perhaps have done fairly well,
but he was too young and Inexperienced

"I know of another instance where
an African had been sent from Eng
land under somewhat similar condi
tions, bringing with him a highly
cultured white lady (charmed with the
prospects of missionary life) as his
wife. In two years she saw his com
plete demoralization and return to

to return to England, where she died

With the advent of modern ordnance,
however, with sixty-ton guns and cost

Then, knowing the length of the base

across the river can be determined by
trigonometry.

must save yo-ur powder just as you
must save your coal in the steam en
gine. Hence, these gun powders are so
composed that, when Ignited, they will
drive the bullet along the gun barrel,
gaining In power as it goes, but so nice
ly balanced in explosive action that the
last speck of powder is not utilized un
til the bullet has reached the muzzle
and is about to leave the gun.
Thus a gun is really a heat engine.
But, as I have intimated, the rending
power of some of these explosives is so
great that the bullet cannot, so to
speak, keep ahead of it. Before the bul
let reaches the muzzle of the gun the
accumulated gases behind it have in
creased so much in volume as to over
come the lateraJ resistance of the bar
rel, and the gun bursts.
You hear people talking of the dan
gers arising from the handling of dyna
mite. I never could see that it was
very dangerous to handle, in the ordi
nary sense of the word at least. I re
member once taking a quantity of dy
namite out in the woods near my iron
mine up the State and trying to ex
plode it by such means as might enter
into any accident likely to occur in
general handling. We did it as an ob
ject lesson to the men as much as for
anything else. We burned it, threw
big rocks at it and tried other ways of
exploding it, but we couldn't make It
go off. We use lots of it for blasting
purposes, but we never have had an
accident. Of course, it produces fright
ful effects when exploded in conjunc
tion with some other high explosive.
Nitro-glycerlne, on the other hand, is
to be feared at all times. I have heard
of a blacksmith who placed one drop
of it on an anvil and then struck it a
hard blow with a hammer. It must
have been a hard blow. It blew out
the side of the shop and made a big
hole under where the anvil had stoocf.
and the blacksmith did not even need
burial. But even this is not to be com
pared to iodide of nitrogen. Its ex
plosive power is equal to 4000 feet a
second. That is, if you laid a train
of it 4000 feet long and exploded one
end of the train, the explosion would
be transmitted to the other end of the
train in one second. I don't know but
that under these conditions the cumu
lative character of the effect would
cause the other end of the train to be
come ignited even sooner than in one
second. That speed is greater than the
accredited velocity of Bound, which
travels at the rate of 1400 feet a sec
ond.
In fact, there are explosives of such
tremendous power that no one dares
make but a very small quantity at a
time, and I doubt If they have ever
been seen outside of laboratories. I
have made them, a drop at a time. But,
oh, how unstable them are! Actually, I
have made explosives of this nature
which have gone off when I yelled at
them. I simply placed a small drop
on a table and shouted at it. It ex
ploded instanctly. You see, the thing
Is in a state of very delicate equilib
rium. It is a question depending on
surrounding conditions as to which it
will do â remain a liquid or turn into a
gas.
When, as in the case just mentioned,
this balance is about equal, it takes
very little to incline it toward a gas
eous form, so that even the sound of
the voice â¢will cause the change. A
violent fit of couching will produce the
effect, and so would a heavy weight
dropped on the floor.
Speaking of this explosive reminds
me of how I got rid of some ministers
who once insisted on boring me in my
laboratory, when I had some impor
tant experiments on hand. I treated
them courteously as long as I could,
but they grew more interested as the
day wore on, and seemed to have no
intention of going home. Finally, as
a last resort, I told them I was going
to make some highly explosive ma
terial. This made them only the more
interested, and they got in my way as
much as they possibly could. Ido not
suppose they knew much of the nature
and appearance of high explosives, for
when I placed a number of drops of the
material in various parts of the room,
so as to scatter any accidental explo
sions, they seemed not to notice it.
At last, when they got crowding al
most between me and the workbench,
I very carelessly pushed a board off
onto the floor. Well, it was worse than
I had intended it to be. It nearly shat
tered the window glass and jostled
things around generally. The mini9
teers seemed scared half to death, and
from the way they held their ears you
would have supposed some one had
bumped their heads together. When I
told them how it had happened, and
discussed the possibility of more acci
dents taking place, they said it really
was quite wonderful, but they guessed
they had better be going. I urged them
to stay and see more fireworks, but
they all had very important engage
ments, and hurried off.
But to return to the subject in hand,
the science of explosives is a very in
teresting one, and if some way is found
to utilize the tremendous forces which
are engendered when the chemicals are
properly combined and exploded, we
may yet come to respect them more
than we do at present. Our knowledge
of the very high explosives dates back
but a few years.
The present war spirit may nrovoke
enough activity in the line of explo
sives to cause their development not
merely as agents of destruction but,
w'lat Is better, in industrial lines. Here,
then, is a chance for budding- Inventors.
Mr. Edison's joke on the mtnist - is
in the same line with one he has played
several times on obnoxious callers. For
instance, a reporter from a paper whose
methods do not entirely agree with the
inventor's ideas of fair dealing, recently
called to interview him. Not wishing to
be rude to him, Mr. Edison asked him if
he objected to his continuing his ex
periments while he talked. Of course
the newspaper man was delighted. It
really added the spice of human inter
est to the affair.
He conducted his caller into a little
room where he had a certain form of
oxygen apparatus which charges the
surrounding atmosphere in a manner
very unpleasant to one not used to it.
Mr. Edison did not mind it in the least,
but his visitor could not ask questions
for choking and coughing. He shortly
excused himself in a most embarrassed
way and left without asking a ques
tion; all of which was rendered still
more ludicrous by the apparently of
fended manner with which the inventor
regarded the reporter's actions. Prob
ably that reporter does not even yet
know a trick was played on him, but

signal
of the
Corinthian
Yacht
Club
ONE of the most energetic, active and prosperous yacht clubs on the bay
of San Francisco â or, indeed, in all California â is the Corinthian, with
headquarters in Tiburon Cove, Marin County. It is now twelve years
old and is third in point of seniority, the San Francisco and Pacific
clubs being older.
The Corinthian Yacht Club was founded in the spring of 18S6 by several
owners of small yachts who were members of the Pacific or San Francisco
clubs, but had become dissatisfied with the treatment accorded to small boats
on club cruises and at regattas. Believing that the sport
of yachting is enjoyed best by men who take care of their
own boats and sail them without the aid of professional
boatkeepers, several enthusiastic young yachtsmen met In
Irving Hall building on the 31st of March, ISS6, to discuss
the question of organizing a new club, in which no boat of a
greater length over all than forty-five feet should be per
mitted to take part in regattas.
The meeting was under the chairmanship of T. F. Tracy,
and George E. Billings acted as secretary. Among the most
active spirits were L. B. Chapman, Ward Battles, H. D.
Keil, W. C. Moody, E. S. Emmons, F. D. Spaulding and G.
F. Byxbee.
W. C. Moody of the schooner Bonlta was chosen first
commodore, L. B. Chapman of the sloop Spray first vice
commodore, and G. E. Billings of the yawl Ripple secretary.
T. F. Tracy was financial secretary, F. D. Spaulding treas
urer, and S. H. Williams measurer.
The following yachts were enrolled: Schooners Bonita
and Neva, sloops Spray, Thetis, Lively, Gertie and Anita;
yawls Ripple and Pearl, the latter having formerly been
named Startled Fawn and now Seven Bells.
The objects of the club were defined to be the encourage
ment of small boats and the handling, management and
sailing of them by amateurs only. Lovers of all aquatic
sports, as well as yacht-owners, were invited to Join the
club, and several owners of rowing boats did so.
The first club cruise took place on May 29, 30 and 31, 1886.
On the evening of the 29th the yachts sailed to Martinez
and on the 30th to Vallejo, returning to Tiburon on the 31st.
At the present date a Corinthian cruise is attended by from
twenty-five to thirty yachts. In 1886 there were about one
third of this number. There being little difference in size
between the boats they kept close together throughout the
cruise.
The first Corinthian regatta took place on June 19, 1888.
W. B. Chapman's sloop Spray, of a sailing length of about
29.C feet, beating on corrected time the yawl Pearl, which
had a sailing length of about 43 feet, and making better
actual time than all the rest of the fleet.
The sloop Lively won the flag in the second class. A
good stiff breeze was blowing in the channel so that the
race afforded a good test both of the speed of the yachts
and of the seamanship of their owners and crews. In the
same year the schooner Bonita was taken down, without
accident, to Mazatlan by W. C. Moody and S. H. Williamsâ
an excellent performance for a 40-foot boat.
Jr. the winter of 1886 and the spring of 1887 the peninsula
to the west of Tiburon ferryslip was chosen as the site for
a clubhouse and was secured largely owing to the liberality
of J. Marvyn Donahue. The members held an informal
opening in 18S7, the clubhouse being not yet finished.
During the winter, L. B. Chapman being commodore, the
fipf-t cruised to Martinez and thence up Suisun Creek to
Suisun, where a reception was given by the townspeople to
the yachtsmen.
The season of 1888 opened on April 28 with dancing and
aquatic sports. During the winter of 1888-89 the accommo
dations for storing boats were much improved by the build
ing of a boathouse, which was opened on February 22, 1889.
On the opening day of 1889 nineteen yachts flew the club
flag.
Without following the history of the Corinthian minutely
year by year down to the present date, it may be said that
the enthusiastic spirit in which the club was founded ani
mates it still, and that its quarters, convenient and well
situated as they are, have long ago become somewhat
cranjped for the accommodation of the 170 or 180 members
now enrolled.
The principles upon which the club was founded have
b* - adhered to throughout its history, viz: the building

and handling of small boats by amateurs and the acquisition of a knowledge
of navigation and of skill in the art of sailing yachts and other vessels. To
be entitled to representation at a meeting of yacht-owners or to be allowed to
participate in the annual club regatta sailed on Decoration day, yachts must
either not exceed 37 feet on the load water-line or must not exceed 45 feet over
all, the latter provision being made to avoid barring out some boats built ac
cording to old models. For example, the sloop Clara has a load water-line of
38 feet, but her length over all is only 44 feet 10 inches; similarly the sloop
Elia has a load water-line of 38.11 feet, but a length over all
of only 41.6 feet. Both boats are, therefore, entitled to take
part in the Corinthian regatta.
The officer* of the Corinthian Yacht Club for the present
season (1898) are: Carl Westerfeld, commodore; Andrew
Thorne, vice-commodore; E. B. Lathrop, secretary; Charles
L. Barrett, treasurer; John H. Keefe, port captain; T. L.
Miller, measurer. The commodore, vice-commodore, secre
tary and treasurer, with O. Eastwood and Fred E. Schober,
make up the board of directors. The regatta committee con
sists of John H. Hopps, P. J. Martenstein and W. F. Dixey,
and the delegates to the Pacific Interclub Yacht Association
are John H. Hopps, P. J. Martenstein and ex-commodore
Alexander J. Young.
The Corinthian fleet is made up of about thirty sloops,
eight yawls and one schooner. The sloops in class 1 are ex-
Commodore G. E. Billings' Nixie, 51 feet 7 inches over all,
the largest and probably best-appointed yacht in the fleet;
E. Donohoe's Speedwell, 45 feet over all and 34 feet on the
water line; ex-commodore A. J. Young's Clara, F. L. King's
Lois, E. B. Lathrop's Pride, and the Ella, chartered by F.
F. Ames. The sloops in class 2 are F. R. Cook's Harpoon,
S. B. Stevenson's Thelma, Frank A. Bartlett's Queen, J. M.
Patrick's Thetis and Rounard's Freda. The sloops in class 3
are ex-Commodore J. W. Pew's Truant, well known as one
of the swiftest and best-handled yachts in the bay; Commo
dore Carl Westerfeld's Aeolus, flagship for 1898, and winner
last year from the Encinal Yacht Club's champion Fawn
of the perpetual challenge cup offered by the San Francisco
Club; J. M. Mattoon's Amigo, W. P. Humphrey Jr.'s Mignon,
ex-Commodore T. F. Tracey's Secret and H. H. Gorter's
Feu Follet. The sloops in class 4 are R. R. I'Hommedieu
and S. C. Delamater's Phoenicia, Breitzmann's Cupid, M. A.
Newell's May and W. C. Howe's Cisne. Class 5 includes
T. L. Miller's Idler, W. Romaine's Venture, H. D. Kiel's Dart
and C. G. Barlage's Dreadnaught. C. C. Bruce's Rover,
which last season was in class 1, is for sale, as are also the
Secret and Feu Follet, the Petrel was lost and L. E. Hart's
Pride, a small sloop in class 4, is not in commission.
In the Corinthian fleet are the following yawls: Vice-
Commodore Andrew Thome's Seven Bells, the Kelleys*
Naiad, W. S. Grover's Arcturus. T. L. Miller's Guinevere,
F. A. Schober's Pinta, W. Brooks' Witch, O. Eastwood's
Kittiwake and F. E. Baker's Phyllis. The only schooner
now nn the club's rolls is W. L. Oliver's Wave. To the list
of sloops are to be added F. E. Baker's Emily, formerly
named Florence, and enrolled in the Encinal Yacht Club; Ed
Segar's Edna, formerly owned by C. J. Lancaster, commo
dore of the California Yacht Club, and Harry Simpkins"
new half-rater Mistral, the prettiest and best-appointed
boat of her size on the bay.
All the vessels in the Corinthian fleet are centerbnards,
except Feu Follet, Naiad and Wave, which are keel boats.
Naiad and Arcturus have auxiliary engines. The keel boat
Nereid, chartered last season by W. F. and E. Fisher and
C. Gerlach, has been chartered to Peat and others, and is
no longer on the rolls of the Corinthian Club. There are
also eight launches, of which the largest is George A.
Knight's Athlete, which is thirty-seven feet over all and
fourteen horsepower.
Though the Corinthian Yacht Club does not, in the year
of grace 1898, "own the Cove" in quite the sense in which it
did some years ago, before the advent of the "ark angel"
and the enterprising housebuilder, it has never been more
prosperous than it is at the present moment, and has never
had brighter prospects for a successful season.

STRANGE STORY CONNECTED WITH THE FAMOUS DUKE OF PORTLAND ESTATE
THE Duke of Portland is one of
England's wealthiest noblemen.
His income from a rent roll
alone is $2,000,000 a year. He
owns a big portion of London.
The line is one of the most famous in
the British peerage. Welbeck Abbey,
the family estate, dates back to the
year 1140, and millions of pounds have
been spent upon it. And vet there
comes a woman, a woman heretofore
unknown, who claims that the fifth
Duke of Portland, the immediate pre
decessor of the present Duke, was the
father of her late husband, and that
her son is the rightful heir to the titles
and estates.
It is a weird story that this woman
tells, a story such as the fanciful brain
of Bulwer might have concocted. It
hints at foul murder, it suggests clank
ing chains and noisome dungeons, it
openly charges a dual personality on
the part of the late Duke, and the
burial of a man who never died and
who never existed!
The woman's name is Anna Maria
Druce, and she says that under the
name of Druce the Duke married her
husband's mother. Her son, she says,
is the real Duke of Portland. He is
now in Australia,
It has always been understood that

ARE WOMEN'S CLUBS HARMFUL TO THE HOME?
DISCUSSED BY:
MRS. HORfITIO STEBBINS-
THE almost phenomenal growth of the woman's
club idea during the past decade or so has
aroused the attention of the entire civilized
world. Women's clubsâ social, scientific, ar
tistic, literary, musical, political, patriotic, phil
anthropic, utilitarian and aestheticâ nave sprung into
existence in cities, towns, villages and hamlets, and
the "club woman" has become a featureâ and a very
large one â in all communities.
The question as to whether bo much of club life does
not interfere with home life is occasionally raised, not
especially by opponents of woman's advancement, but
by those who honestly desire her best good and the
best good â through her â of the world.
-> Mrs. Horatio Stebbins, a woman who is widely
known and universally respected not only for her quali
ties as a wife and a mother and a home-maker, but
for the good which she has quietly and unobstrusively
done and Is constantly doing outside her household,
has recently expressed her opinion concerning this
matter, and her views are here presented, together
with those of some of California's most prominent club
women and some of San Francisco's well-known men.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It is generally assumed,
without any disparagement to
the other side of the house,
that the mother's spirit and
character determine the spirit
MRS. H. STEBBINS.
and character of the family; if this is so there can be
no question concerning the rank of maternal influence
compared with other influences of any kind. What
ever aids the mother of a family gains rrom other
sources they find their highest expression in the in
fluence they have upon home. Nowhere does the
mother appear so well in the character of woman as
at home; nowhere is her influence more profound or
more lasting. Like most other great influences it is
silent but pervasive and penetrating. It domestic life
is the foundation of civilized and Christian society
there can be no questions concerning these things.
Whatever impairs this influence, whatever diverts
It into other channels, is yielding up the greater to the
less. Yet these duties cannot be wisely discharged in
utter seclusion from the daily life of the world; the
doors of the home must be open to the best Influences
that society affords; the mind must be refreshed by
the open field of thought; weariness must be relieved
by change; monotony overcome by cheerful inter
course, and sympathies awakened and responded to by
the generous mingling of true feeling.
The question arises now, can all these be appropri
ated to enrich the mind and heart with cheerful wis
dom, happy love and patient care?
In all things good there is a tendency to excess.
What is called society has a fascinating charm, but
unless wisely enjoyed it is one of the most prolific
sources of superficial thought and feeling. What is
commonly called fashionable society is a combination
of conventionalism, self-consciousness and insincerity;
a woman who is at the head of a family and is given
up to this cannot bring into her own life or home any
fine influences from that source. The criterion of wis
dom and love in social relations is that woman who
uses society and is not used by it.
A form of social life, Improvement and recreation is
the club. The club for women is comparatively a new
institution. The club is a fascinating association for
men or women; for men it is valuable for pleasure,
convenience, bus! ess or idleness; for women it is ex
hilarating, affords a cheerful change from the mo
notony of woman's work that is never done, and gives
much interest and zest to common events and common
experience, but it is exposed to many excesses and
trivial ambitions.
A cl- â â 'Â» woman (and I use the phrase in the same
sense in which we say a club man) I believe cannot be
the wise, patient and loving administrator of her
household. Sh - can bring little into her home from
that source to refine its temper, soften its asperities,
or unravel the perplexities that are natural to young,
untrained minds; but a wise use of the club affords a
cheerful change, a happy intercourse of intelligence
and refinement.

The club to women Is but a higher grade In life's
school, and if one does not have the time or Inclination
to study the many Intricate problems touching the
civilisation of to-day she can profit by the research of
her sister, thus gaining in a few moments what it has
taken another days and weeks to gather.
The club, to a large extent, has aroused women, and
through its agency her latent ability and energy have
been brought forth and she Is realizing, as never be

with the realization of this fact comes the desire to be

are that homes are better regulated, motherhood more

no club has ever had the opportunity to experimental
ize on my home or home life.
In my estimation the question as to the desirability
of such clubs depends to a great extent for Its answer
upon the worldly circumstances of those who join
them. Those women whose incomes are sufficient to
make them able to put all the real work of their house
holds, and care of their children, into other hands,
leaving to themselves merely the general supervision
of affairs, may perhaps give much of their time and at
tention to club work and club pleasure without ma
terially defrauding the home, save in taking from it
the wifely and motherly presence, and the wifely and
motherly influence, which the homes or the wealthy
too often wofully lack.
On the other hand, women in moderate circum
stances, whose homes and children are almost. If not
entirely, dependent upon their personal good offices
for all their care, comfort and happiness, can scarcely
give much of their time or thought or strength to out
side duties without actually neglecting, in material
ways, those who should be nearest and dearest to
them.
I am not prejudiced against women's clubs, for I
see ways in which they can be used, as well as abused;
but I think that the majority of women connected with
such organizations become so engrossed with their club
work and aims and so absorbed in themselves in re
lation to these things, that a certain spirit of selfish
ness is unconsciously cultivated, and they become club,
and self, centered, thus neglecting or ignoring more
important outside duties.
I also think that the political side* of club lifeâ the
electioneering and the small ambitions for office â have
a tendency to destroy the feeling of sisterhood which
ought to exist in assemblages of women Joined together
for some common purpose, and to create in its stead
petty jealousies and differences which extend outside
the club doors, and do much harm, sometimes, indeed,
developing into almost a feud between factions. Such
things may, and undoubtedly do, happen in men's clubs
likewise, but I was not asked to express an opinion of
them.
As to the educational vaJue of women's clubs, It
seems to me that the average woman by devoting to
some special study the time that she gives to the club
â the preparing of her toilettes, the dressing, the going
to and from, the hours spent in her clubroom and on
committee work â in fact, exactly the hours, minutes
and seconds that she gives to it at home and abroad â
would acquire a larger, more accurate and more avail
able fund of real knowledge than she could hope to
gather from listening to club papers and club discus
sions.
There is only one kind of a woman's club which
would have my entire indorsement and sympathy, and
that is one where women should band together for the
sake of alleviating the suffering and pitiable poverty
which exists all around us. If women would organize
such clubs and prove true to themselves, their obliga
tions and their fellow beings, thinking not of personal
aggrandizement in any way but of the work which lies
before them to do, such clubs would be a wonderful
power for good, not only to those cared for, but to the
members themselves, and would be a blessed stepping
stone to higher things.

costly and more questionable ways.
The present agitaticmÂ»about club life for women is
more or less provincial. In more populous and oldei
localities this question was fought out and settled
years, ago.
Any student of the recent conditions of womanhood
will not escape from the fact that the great body of
American women look upon life with a larger, less per
sonal and less passionate view than was the case
twenty-five years ago, and this is very largely due to
the growth of the woman's club. Such women make
better, because wiser, mothers.
In spite of many undesirable forces that strongly
affect the national character, there is a large per
centage of young people now growing to maturity who
look upon life with pure hearts, serious minds and high
ideals. Go into any small town and select the boys
who respect women, who are clean of body and mind,
who have a pride and interest in their town, their
State and their nation; select the girls who dress sen
sibly as well as beautifully, who are following earn
estly some especial line of work or study, and who
look upon marriage as something besides the acquir
ing of a well-feathered nest, something imposing large
obligations upon the woman as well as on the manâ
and you will see that these boys and girls have moth
ers and teachers who have been considering all those
questions studied in the ordinary woman's club.
And it requires but a very superficial observation
to see that these results are far more obvious in the
towns where there are such clubs than in towns where
there are none.
Women's societies auxiliary to churches do not ac
complish the same results, because^-flrst, they are
email and divided by sectarian differences; and sec
ond, their object, is usually not moral or religious so
much as it is a money-making object to aid the mar
terial welfare of the church.
Much that is foolish is said both in and about wo
men's clubs. Churches and church women have com
bated them; but while it is true that club life does
tend to break down sectarian differences, to ignore
the non-essentials in religion, to cast aside Dorcas So
ciety customs, yet much of that which is essential and
permanent in religion, a broad outlook upon life, a
lively interest in the life of the entire community, a
higher morality, a development of spirituality ex
pressed in more thoughtful living and a greater love
of humanity, and a grander, more intimate sense of
union with the Infinite â these results do follow the
establishment of the typical woman's club every
where.
Concerning the Influence of
women's clubs I echo the sen
timent expressed at the con
gress by that most helpful of
our club women, Mrs. Sarah
Pratt Carr, that wherever wo
men ore organized In club work there is to be found
the sane, sound and helpful women.
It Is true that women in secular organizations have
done, but do not. The club woman Is a true social
being, trying to find out what she may do to help this
world and to grasp the present opportunity; not satis
fied with the best she knows how, but searching for
and eager to adopt a "yet more excellent way."
I do not think it can be found that any more women
neglect their homes for their club than neglect home
for church, and these women, were they interested in
neither church nor club, would find still other outlets
for their energies than domestic ones.

When men live In men's clubs and women live In
women's clubs, where does the home life go to; and
with home life gone what becomes of the nation?
You say a woman may belong to a club and still
be a good wife and mother.
I deny it, and facts will substantiate my denial.
Whenever women begin to ape men in any way they
lose their charm for men. This is a fact there is no
use trying to deny.
When the United States Census Bureau tells us that
more than four-fifths of our men (80.69 per cent) at %
years of age are unmarried, that nearly a half (45.98
per cent) at 30 years are unmarried, that over a quar
ter (26.50 per cent) at 35 years of age are unmarried,
then the said bureau tells us that a vast majority of
our young men are leading licentious lives.
In other words, the unwomanly manners and ways
of modern women, of which "women's clubs" are one
expression, "woman's suffrage" Is another, and all the
varied forms and ways in which women turn from
their one place in the worldâ "home-makers"â to enter

I think women's clubs are
one of the last mile stones on
the way toward national de
struction, the goal toward
which this nation is at present
authority. As he is In Australia, It
must be delayed, but I am absolute
ly confident of success."
This is the strange story told by Mrs.
Druce. Burkes peerage throws abso
lutely no light upon any such romance
in the life of the late Duke as that
openly charged by th^ woman. If there
be a flaw in the title she will have a
desperate struggle to prove her claim.
According to Burke, the fifth Duke
died unmarried. December 6. 1579, and i
the dukedom passed to his cousin, Wil- i
Hum John Arthur Charles James, the
present Duke, who was born December
28, 1857, and i.iarrled Winifred Anna,
only daughter of Thomas Yorke Dallas-

into competition with men, take the bloom off the
grape, and then man's interest in woman becomes
simply animal, devilish.
Mind, I don't say this is woman's fault chiefly. On
the contrary, it is man's fault for ever permitting it.
Man has allowed a lot of "talkers," who by the
direction of Satan himself have garbed themselves in
woman's habiliments, to go about the land shouting
about the "tyrant man" trampling on the much-abused
woman, telling woman she could do something "higher
and nobler" than motherhood, and that she ought to
be man's competitor instead of his coadjutor. The
result is that now, when it looks as if the Anglo-Saxon
race had got to combine to fight nearly all the rest of
the world, the young men whom we might have had
with us are going to be awfully needed.
I suppose, however, we can console ourselves for
their loss with "women's clubs" and "women's con
gresses," etc. I am afraid, though, we shall find them
mighty poor substitutes for the men.

MRS. E, 0. SMITH,

many things have to be taken into consideration in
discussing a matter of this kind.
There are, unfortunately, both men and women
whose minds seem incapable of dealing with more than
one Idea at a time, and who run on one straight line
to the neglect of everything outside of that when once
their inertia has been overcome sufficiently to start
them in any direction. I believe that the church has
been of infinite damage to some homes for this very
reason, the devoted "church worker" being, however,
in his or her own estimation actuated by the very
best of motives and never realizing the deplorable
facts of the case.
There are women who have become so interested in
their church, in Booriboola Oha and their other mis
sions at home and abroad, as to neglect their house
holds and their children most markedly. There are
others who arrive at the same undesirable end through
their devotion to fashion, and to society, and there are
still others who have become so infatuated with the
appearance of the home itself as to almost ruin it
for those who are forced to abide in it. There are
also women who are so devoted to their children as to
spoil the children utterly and cripple their usefulness
in the years of maturity. The average woman and
the average home, I believe, have been greatly bene
fited by the kind of club life which women have taken
up in the past few years.
While it is man's rightful place to skirmish for the
bread and butter for his family, it is the mother's place
to skirmish for vv'hat will benefit her household men
tally and spiritually, and bring to- it the inspiration
which comes from such an interchange of views as
can be obtained in the woman's club where every one
brings her best and highest thoughts.
No well-poised woman will ever be so carried away
with any outside call upon her time and attention as
to ignore or neglect the claims of those who are near
est and dearest to her, and the woman who is not well
poised fails in the performance of her duties wherever
she may be placed, and neither the club nor the home
is the better for her presence.
While there undoubtedly
are women who neglect their
home duties because of out
side interests of some kind,
such women, I am convinced,
compose a very small minor
ity and women of the same caliber most certainly
neglected their homes long before women's clubs ex
isted to be blamed for their remissness.
The ordinary club fills up only a small portion of
time not nearly so much as is spent in social calls,
and as, instead of the half hour of chatting between
two women on no particular subject, the time in the
club is spwu* in listening to instructive papers and dis
cussing them with an assemblage of women who have
read and studied and thought for the especial purpose
of bringing something of real worth to their club meet
ing, it seems to me that there can be no question as to
which method of spepding time is the more valuable.
The interchange of ideas, the bright, earnest discus
sions, the contact of different minds, which club life
gives to women is not only pleasant, but greatly bene
ficial, and a wife and mother who finds the time to at
tend such meetings goes back to her home better fitted
to perform her duties there.
The only objection which I have to the clubs of the
present time is that there are men's clubs and women's
clubs, instead of being, as there should be, clubs for
both together. Men's clubs, as a rule, are very dif
ferent from women's clubs; they are run on different
lines, being more for amusement and recreation, and
their Influence is not bo good. There are not & few

William John Cavendish Scott Ben

to the title and vast estates March 27,

whether the reather was wet or fine,
without an umbrella.
He would invariably drive alone, no
one approaching him but his valet.
There were drawn for him every day
two quarts of beer and two of ale, but
he never drank them. He was free
from vice, and his unusual manner of
life was said to have been caused solely
by an overmastering desire to carry
into effect his rare constructive skill.
It is also true, as Mrs. Druce alleges,
that he caused to be constructed under
ground passages leading from Welbeck
Abbey. It is ridiculous to presume,
however, that he did so with any desire
to use them as a means of escape. He
was addicted to underground architec
ture, and it is because of its subterra
neous apartments that the abbey is to
day one of the curiosities of England.
The late Duke's vast income was ex
pended year by year on the estate and
buildings. He had a passion for archi
tecture. The reason generally given
for the creation of the wonderful un

honeycomb the estate is that the Duke
wished to give employment to the poor,
of whom he was always considerate.

oellent thing for women, more

" our community, and most
especially the home women in only ordinary clrcum-
We have many such clubs In San Jose â bands of
women, with a greater or less membership, busy at
odd moments studying varieties of art, history, music,
some particular author or authors in Â«ral. In this
way even the woman who6e early education has been
much neglected can acquire a measure of culture that
will be a benefit to her famny and put her at her ease
in almost any circle. I believe this culture club has
done much toward the loftier thought and broader in
telligence of our domestic women, the homekeepers, the
wiVes and mothers of to-day. Anything that can oc
casionally lift the thought of men or women, particu
larly of mothers, out of the rut of the commonplace
and set it climbing to loftier heights is a blessing; and
that this is being done by our better class of culture
clubs no one can doubt who has knowledge of them.
I am speaking now only of the modest culture clubs
that have taken unto themselves so many of the best
of our quiet, domestic women; having no reference
whatever to the "woman suffrage" and other "reform"
combinations which, in the lang-uage of Rudyard Kip
ling, are "another story."

such a woman the club is really a blessing. If she be
a wife and a mother, tired, and made at times a bit
despondent and discouraged by her multifarious duties
and the incessant demand upon her time, her strength
and her temper, an afternoon spent at the club, where
she sees friendly faces and listens to the ideas and ex
periences of others, and finds opportunity aJso to give
of her own best for the encouragement and help of
others, is both a rest and a tonic. She goes back to
her home, her nursery and her kitchen better able to
deal with affairs of her every-day life, and her family
as well as herself is a gainer by her brief holiday.
Then again, there are many women who have
neither home nor children â teachers and working wo
men, who find their best recreation and highest pleas
ure in the society of their club members, and who look
forward to the weekly or monthly meetings with keen
interest and the pleasantest anticipations. Here they
find congenial friends, their equals In mind and antici
pations, and their sisters In sympathetic companion
ship.
Of course, if women are to be only housekeepers and
nursery maids, if they are expected to deal only with
the material wants of their families, and to have no
mental and spiritual gifts, then the club life is cer
tainly detrimental to them, since it broadens their
minds and most assuredly unfits them to be mere
drudges.
But surely a woman is no less motherly because
she is made more intellectual by friendly association
with refined and cultured women, and quite as surely
it is not necessary that a woman should be a recluse
in order that she may love and care for her children
and home as she ought.
In refutation of this idea, let me say that the "club
women" of my acquaintance are shining examples of
happy home makers. Take the Century Club, for in
stance, of which I am a charter member. There aro
over 200 of San Francisco's best women in that organi
zation and they are the best homekeepers and mothers,
and yet find time to attend the weekly meetings of
their club and maintain its high standard without in
terfering with any of their other duties. The Suffrage
Association also is composed to a great extent of wives
and mothers, and the uplifting and improvement of
the home is their central idea â not its neglect and de
sertion.
If my home is not happy and well ordered, my farm
not properly run and my children not Just as well loved
and well cared for as those of any woman who never

IN th i TCb the country was startled
by the boldness and frequency of
stage robberies In the Blue Moun
tain section of Oregon. The rob
beries were not only bold, but re
munerative, and It seemed impossible
to catch the guilty parties. For a long
time their operations were confined to
Wells, Fargo & Co.'s express, and so
long they escaped detection. At last,
In a bitterly contested stage robbery,
they added murder, individual robbery
and the rifling of Uncle Sam's mail.
Then, by a combination of all the
forces in clever detective work, the
robbers were run down. Wheeler,
Brown and Billings were convicted and
sent to the State prison at San Quen
tln. They were assigned to different
duties in the hospital department.
It was while these men were serving
their time behind the prison walls that
they organized themselves to rob ajid
plunder the people of the northern
counties of the State. Individually
and collectively, they were the shrewd
est, boldest and most desperate lot of
men that ever gathered inside San
Quentin cells for a like purpose.
Wheeler was finely educated, a good
chemist and, as events subsequently
showed, the master mind directing the
movements of the band afterward
known as the Mendocino outlaws.
Brown had been a minister of the
gospel, was a pleasant talker, appar
ently as mild a mannered man as any
minister of the gospel. He had kindly
blue eyes, an open, frank countenance,
and he was one of the sweetest sing
ers ever heard. He was sociable and
f<>nd of singing. But, oh, what a
change could come over the man. I
have met him three times In action.
Once he was the attacking party and
twice the attacked. When in his fight
ing temper his oaths were the wicked
est I ever heard. His eyes seemed to
turn green, a?, wfth unerring certain
ty, they drew a bead. He had tried his
hardest to kill me. I knew he had
killed my friends. After he was secure
in the iron ceil upstairs at the Ukiah
jail and stripped <>f his shooting irons,
I used to hear his almost plaintive
voice singing the songs with which he
used to lead his flock in church. When
no one else was in hearing he would
a< knowledge his part in all the crimes
i:: which I knew he was a participant.
'lay lie told me why he had left
the ministry. He said he was ready to

think he could have been blindfolded
ar.d placed any where west of the
Rocky Mountains, and that, on remov
ing the blind, he could tell you where
he was. liis ideas of locality were
mist remaxki hi-.
Wheeler was the head and chief
brains of the gang. He was a quiet man,
and besides being a chemist he was a
g< od dentist. His tawny complexion,
dark hair and piercing black eyes sug

was a sealed book. In directing 1 the

ance of their plans, he went to Men
doclno City and took with him a pleas
ing woman as his wife. Their conduct
was circumspect and they gained the
good will and esteem of everybody in
Mendocino City.
Occasional rumors of a swift, solitary
midnight rider among the redwoods
were circulated, but none connected Dr.
Wheeler with this. I saw Wheeler in
the full tide of his social and business
career at Mendocino City. I saw him
captured on Cow Mountain in Redwood
Valley, after he had been surrounded
and stormed out. After his capture I
saw him die on the jail floor at Ukiah
by means of self-administered poison.
I tried to talk with him in jail many
times and to this day I know nothing
of his private life or who he was prev
ious to the Blue Mountain robberies.
Billings I knew little of, as the only
times I met him he had a gun in his
hand and he was not in a chatting
mood. In the mountains in Humboldt
County I came upon three of the band
unexpectedly. Billings wa.s amusing
himself by throwing up two buckeye
balls and shattering them both with
his pistol before they could strike the
ground. He also held up a piece of a
looking glass in front of him and, buck
eye balls being thrown up fifteen paces
behind him, he took aim by the aid of
the looking glass and broke several
balls.
I had been hunting them, but when I
saw this performance I was afraid th' j y
would find me.
Billings was always full of fight and
died fighting. He was the first to fire
on the attacking party and the last to
quit. He never retreated until over
whelmed by numbers. I have now on
me a scar from one of his bullets.
He had a sweetheart somewhere and
was trying to raise money to get mar
ried. He was splendidly proportioned
and a better looking man one seldom
sees.
Carr was not line the others. He was
a saloon man of San Francisco and had
been convicted of murder or robbery
in his saloon. He was not a gun-fight
er. He had no grit and could not stand
hardship although he was the largest
man in the gang. He quit the first few
days of the chasÂ« and ignominiously
surrendered near Usal in Mendocino
County.
He had trained Heenan, the Benicia
boy. in some of his fights, and. if I
remember correctly, was his trainer at
the time he fought Sayres. He had

Brown, much to their subsequent sor
row and chagrin.
Gaunce, the last of the quintet, had
no previous criminal record. He was
raised in San Rafael. How he made
the acquaintance of the other four al
ways remained a mystery. He was a
young and boyish looking, not more
than 20 years old. He, llk% Billings,
was very handsome. He didn't know
how to use a gun, but he was the last
one captured. His sweetheart stayed
with him to the last. He was of good
family, but some powerful influence or
some inborn deviltry made him desir
ous of being a noted criminal and he
was the most foolhardy of the lot.
The sentences of all these dare-devils
expired in San Quentin about the same
time and they began their new career
of robbery and plunder according to
the programme they had so carefully
mapped out while under the prison
keeper's eyes in San Quentin. Wheeler
went to Mendocino City in the guise of
a physician and assumed what was to
all appearances a most respectable
course of life. This was only a blind,
however. He was to keep the others
posted on what was going on, give them
warnings of any approaching danger
or suspicion and they were to commit
the crimes.
A queer accident cut short the career
of the whole gang, but so desperate and
bold were they that several lives were
lost before they were finally run down;
even then most of them had to be killed
because they would not surrender.
Wheeler, the leader, died by self-ad
ministered poison rather than take his
chances of a trial.
In 1879 and for many years previous
it had been the custom of the Sheriff,
who was also tax collector of Mendo
cino County, to give public notice of
the time when he would be at certain
places to collect the taxes due. There
were no railroads then and the Sheriff
carried the money with him from place
to place in large sums, as then all the
taxes were collected at one time.
One of the plans of the gang was to
rob the Sheriff when he was returning
with his load of tax money. After Dr.
Wheeler had gained the confidence of
the citizens of Mendocino City the other
prison birds drifted into the neighbor
hood and met at a rendezvous. So
cleverly did they manage this that no
one knew of their presence. A simple
mistake betrayed them and led to the
undoing of the gang.
It was their intention to kill a beef

two-year-old heifer belonging to a Por
tuguese. It was jthe only one the man
owned. When the Portuguese missed
his heifer he started en a persistent
search for her. If it had been the heifer
of the company the chances are she
would not have been missed so soon
and when missed the search would not
have been so persistent. At last the
Portuguese found traces of her hide
buried and also discovered the camp of
Brown, Billings, Oaunce and Carr, who
had killed her. He returned to Mendo
cino City at once and swore out a war
rant fur the arrest of four unknown
persons.
The constable went to their camp to
make the arrest and found them too
strong. They were able and to him
seemed willing to make a fight.
The next morning the Sheriff re
turned with a posse. It was a damp,
foggy morning. The outlaws had moved
camp and while searching for them the
posse was fired upon by unseen parties
from a goose nest in a redwood tree.
The unerring guns of Billings and
Brown found Dallard and Wright, two
estimable young men of Mendocino
City. They fell mortally woundei.
Thereupon the posse disappeared and
the desperadoes started on a trip
through pathless mountains to escape.
For sixty-two days they fled and lor
sixty-two days, under the guidance and
directions of J. M. Stanley of Mendo

mountains, through canyons and across
streams.
Sometimes the trail would oe lost.
Then hours and sometimes days were
devoted to finding it. The puwuit
hung doggedly on. Every nonr f>t the
time was filled with exciting events
All this time no one suspected the
good Pr. Wheeler with being- mixed up
with these cattle thieves. This is the
odd way in which his complicity was
discovered:
In searching their camp a tag, show
ing a cost mark, was found. After
many days' search a tinsmith recog
nized the mark and he remembered
having marked half a dozen drinking
cups with the tags, which he said he
had sold to Dr. Wheeler.
There was the first clew to the iden
tity of the men.
Many proclaimed Wheeler's innocence
and it devolved on C. C. Hamilton, now
an attorney in Oakland, to make the

arrest. Nothing could be learned from
Wheeler.
The pursuing party tracked the band
to a cabin in the mountains near Usal.
There they found Carr, weary and
footsore, ready to surrender. He told
ajl he knew. For the first time the
pursuers learned whom they were fol
lowing.
Had Wheeler not then been In the
Jail at Ukiah he never would have been
taken.
Carr confessed that the original plans
of the outlaws had been made while
they were prisoners in San Quentin.
Wheeler was to be the captain; to en
gineer the scheme and keep them post
ed. Wheeler, he said, used to visit the
ramp late at night every night. Their
plan was to rob the Sheriff on his way
down the coast with his tax money and
then go to Ukiah, rob the Treasurer's
office, take in all the stages, and rob
and plunder every safe and every per
son that had money â in fact, do a gen
eral robbing and murdering business.
Long days of tracking the other out
!a\vs followed. It was scant food,
clothes torn to tatters, hunting des
perate men and fearing we might at
any time be .ambushed.
Nothing was seen or heard of them
except as I have detailed, until, de
scending a deep canyon in Humboldt
County, through which runs Rattle
snake Creek, shooting was heard.
Creeping cautiously through the brush
we heard a voice saying:
"Boys, some one should be on
guard."
Brown anrwered: "We are as safe
here as if we were 100 miles in the
middle of the earth."
By that time we saw them. Gaunce
was stripped for a swim. Brown was
building a fire and Billings was fool
ing with his pistol. As Gaunce struck
the water "zip" went seven bullets at
them.
The two others returned the fire for
a time, but, finding- themselves out
numbpred. they broke across the creek
and all got away.
We got part of their camp and some
of their clothing. As they were scram
bling up the c-pposite bank we heard
Gaunce say
"Hell, Brown, if this is like 100 miles
inside the earth, I don't want to be
there."
The pursuit finally led to the Sacra
mento Valley, but some way they
eluded all the watchers at the ridges
and crossed safely.

tured, but Billings answered with a
shot. At that fight were Stanley and
Clarence White, then a boy in his teens,
who afterward killed Wylakie John in
Covelo, and two others.
Stanley stationed one on each of
three sides of the cabin and put Clar
ence White behind a big rock, thinking
him too small for such a time. Stan-'
ley commenced shooting into the cabin
where Billings was, aiming his bullets
about six inches apart and about one
foot from the floor. The party on the
other side got the "buck ague" and
left.
Billings was shot in the knee and
started from the cabin at the side from
which the deputy had gone. Clarence
White had been unable to see anything
from behind the rock, and hearing the
shooting came out in time to meet
Billings.
Unknown to the others, White and
Billings had a duel to the death.
Billings' aim was unsteady owing to
his wound and Clarence killed him.
Gaunce was found in hiding behind a
cupboard in a house near by. He and
Brown were taken to Ukiah. Wheeler
and Carr were already there.
At the trial Carr turned State's evi
dence. Wheeler was not tried. Brown
and Gaunce were convicted as a matter
of course. A young attorney was ap
pointed to defend them. The Judge, an
old criminal lawyer, in charging the
jury, said "Murder is the unlawful kill
ing of a human being," leaving off the
words "with malice aforethought."
This being a fatal defect, a new trial
was granted, but the rascals were con
victed and were given life imprison
ment at San Quentin.
STRANGE PRACTICES
IN
CHINESE SURGERY.
DR. J. J. MATIGNON, after three
years' sojourn in Peking, says
that a study of Chinese medi
cine convinces one that China is
the paradise of routine. Even savages
must learn something of disease by ex
perience, but in China the practice of
medicine is so hedged about by cere
monial that it becomes inoperative.
A royal officer being wounded by an
arrow, sent for a surgeon to remove
ON PARADE.
THE MORNING TOILET.
It. In doing so he broke the arrow off
inside the man's body, whereon he de
parted, leaving the patient to the care
of his physician, because the custom of :
his country forbade him to meddle
with anything below the surface of the
skin.
The Chinese literature is rich in tha
number and size of medical volumes,
but they are entirely commentaries
and recompilations of the old masters
who practiced their art at the time
Hector bade farewell to Andromache
on the wall of Tr-y and of the land
where Cleopatra was a child.
The chief object of the author of
Chinese medical works is to make their
theories as obscure and mysterious as
possible. They bury their ideas under
volumes of shadowy discourses even
deeper than our medical man buries
his under â words unpronounceable, un- i
known and unknowable to the ordi
nary layman.
The Chinese make no dissections, and
study anatomy from fantastically elab
orated charts where nerves, tendons
and blood vessels are confounded.
Their lay figure for studying is a
bronze manikin bearing a large num
ber of punctures corresponding to the
lance cuts that may safely practiced
on a living subject.
To pass an examination for a diplo
ma, the manikin is covered with paper
and the surgeon locates these punc
tures.
The Chinese horror of surgery arises
from religious notions rather than
from fear of pain. According to their
ideas, any attempt to improve upon
one's body would be a direct insult to
one's ancestors. Accordingly, surgical
operations are little practiced.
According to their teaching, the head
is a solid bone, the brain being un
known to them. The heart rules the
body; the seat of ideas of pleasure is
the pit of the stomach; the liver is re
sponsible for sentiments of nobility
and generosity, while the gall bladder
dominates the courage of its owner.
They believe that the body is com
posed of five elements â fire, water,
metal, wood and carth â and disease Is
the disturbance of their equilibrium,
and is caused by evil spirits.
They are Heathen Scientists, as It
were, and either exorcise these evil
spirits by charms and incantations,
circles and sprinkling, or else i- voka
the aid of more powerful good spirits.
These good spirits must be called and
propitiated by food and burning punks.
If a Chinese loses a member or sub
mits to an operation, the amputated
part is carefully preserved to be buried
with him.
Bowling alleys are being fitted with
electric fixtures to indicate the moving
of the pins, an electric circuit being made
through a plate in the bottom of each pin,

THE DOCTOR'S VISIT.
"SEATED ONE DAY AT THE ORGAN.'
2324
BERTRAM EASTFORD had intended to pass the
shop of his old friend, the curiosity dealer, into
whose pocket so much of his money had gone, for
trinkets gathered from all quarters of the globe.
He knew it was weakness on his part to select
that street when he might have taken another, but
he thought it would do no harm to treat himself to
one glance at the seductive window of the old curiosity
shop, where the dealer was in the habit or displaying his
latest acquisitions.
On the central shelf of the window stood an hour glass,
its framework of some wood as black as ebony. He
stood gazing at it for a moment, then turned to the door
and went inside, greeting the ancient shopman, whom he
know so well.
"I want to look at the hour glass you have in the
window." he said.
He took the hour glass from the shelf in the window,
reversed it and placed it on a table.
"There is no need for you to extol its antiquity," said
Eastford with a smile. "I knew the moment I looked at
it that such glasses are rare, and you are not going to ttnd
me a cheapening customer."
"So far from overpraising it," protested the shopman,
"I was about to call your attention to a derect. It is
useless as a measurer of time."
"It doesn't record the exact hour, then?" asked East
ford.
"Well, I suppose the truth is they were not very par
ticular in the old days, and time was not money as it is
now. It measures the hour with great accuracy," the
curio dealer went on, "that is, if you watch it, but,
strangely enough, after it has run for half an hour or
thereabouts, through some defect in the necK of the glass,
or in the pulverizing of the sand, it stops, and will not go
again unless the glass is shaken."
The hour glass at that moment verified what the old
man said. The tiny stream of sand suddenly ceased, but
went on again the moment its owner jarred the frame,
and continued pouring without interruption.
"Well. I don't want it as a timekeeper, so we will not
allow that defect to interfere with the sale. How much
do you ask for It?"
The dealer named his price, and Eastford paid the
amount asked.
"I shall send it to you this afternoon."
"Thank you," said the customer, taking his leave.
That night in his room Bertram Eastford wrote busily
until a late hour. When his work was concluded he
pushed away his manuscript with a sigh of that deep con
tentment which comes to a man who has not wasted his
day. He replenished his open fire, drew nis most com
fortable armchair in front of it, took the grren shade
from his lamp, thus filling the luxurious apartment with
a light that was reflected from armor and from ancient
weapons, standing in corners and hung along the walls
THERE is an interesting relic of
the early political history of
California in the possession of
the Sacramento Society of Pio
neers. It suggests a volume of
pioneer memories and as time passes
its value and interest will increase. It
is a scroll of blue writing paper â such
as was generally used fifty years ago â
upon which is written briefly the bio
graphies of the members of the first
Legislature of California. It is of
especial historical value in that each
individual penned his life sketch with
his own hand; that it relates to as re
markable a State Legislature as was
ever convened, and that many who
made the record have been distin
guished in State and national history.
Very few of the writers survive. The
last to pass away was Captain Joseph
Aram, whose death at San Jose was
noted in The Call last month. There
were but sixteen Senators, who repre
sented the nine districts that had been
established by the Mexican Govern
ment.
The first of the Senators who wrote
upon the scroll was David F. Douglass,
and he incidentally mentioned that "on
March 17, 1839, had a fight with Dr.
William Howell, in which H. was
killed; Imprisoned fourteen months."
Douglass was a member of Captain
Jack Hays' celebrated regiment of
Texas rangers during the Mexican war,
and on the declaration of peace came to
California. After having served two
terms in the State Senate and one in
the Assembly he was appointed Secre
tary of State by J. Neely Johnson, the
"Know Nothing" Governor, in 1855, and
THE HOUR GLASS
"THERE, GENERAL," I GASPED, "THERE IS YOUR CITADEL."
He lifted the paper-covered package cut the string that
bound it, and placed the ancient hour glass on his table,
watching the thin stream of sand which his action had
set running.
The constant, unceasing, steady downfall seomed to
hypnotize him. It? descent was as silent as the footsteps
Of time itself. Suddenly it stopped as it had done in the
shop, and its abrupt ceasing jarred on his tingling nerves
like an unexpected break in the stillness. He could almost
imagine an unseen hand clasping the thin cylinder of the
glass and throttling it. He shook the bygone time meas
ure, and breathed again more steadily when the sand
resumed its motion. Presently he took the glass from the
table and examined it with some attention. He thought
at first its frame was ebony, but further inspection con
vinced him it was oak, blackened with age. On one round
end was carved rudely two hearts overlapping, and
twined about them a pair of serpents.
"Now. I wonder what that's for?" murmured Eastford
to himself. "An attempt at a coat-of-arms, perhaps."
There was no clew to the meaning of the hieroglyphics,
and Eastford, with the gloss balanced on his knee,
watched the sand still running, the crimson threads spark
ling In the lamplight. He fancied he saw distorted reflec
tions of fact's in the convex glass, although his reason told
him they were but caricatures of his own. The gre.-it bell
in the tower near by with slow solemnity tolled 12. He
counted its measured strokes one by one, and then was
startled by a decisive knock at his door. One section of
his brain considered this visit untimely, another looked
on it as perfectly usual, and while the two were arguing
the matter out he heard his own voice cry:
"Come in!"
11.
The door opened, and the discussion between the
government and the opposition in his mind ceased to con
sider the untlmellneaa of the visit, for here in the visitor
himself stood another problem. He was a young man in
military costume, his uniform being that of an officer.
Eastford remembered seeing something like !t on the
stage, and knowing little of military affairs, thought per
haps the costume of the visitor before him Indicated axi
officer in the Napoleonic war.
"Good evening," said the incomer. "May I introduce
myself? I am Lieutenant Sentore of the regular army."
"You are very welcome," returned his host. "Will you
be seated?"
"Thank you, no. I have but a few moments to stay.
I have come for my hourglass, if you will be good enough
to let me have it."
"Your hourglass? "ejaculated Eastford, in surprise. "I
think you labor under a misapprehension. The glass
belongs to me. I bought to-day at the old curiosity shop
in Finchmore street."
"I have already admitted that my claim is moral
rather than legal," continued the visitor. "It is a long
story; have I your permission to tell it?"
THE LEGISLATURE OF 1000 DRINKS.
was afterward appointed United States i
Marshal by a Democratic President.
Old General M. G. Vallejo was a na
tive son member of the Senate. He
had been connected with the Mexican
civil and military Government since
1824, and was one of few prominent
natives who favored the transfer of
California to the Americans rather
than to the English at the impending
outbreak of the war with Mexico. But
he never forgave the bear flag party
for taking him a prisoner at Sonoma,
carrying him to Sutter's Fort and keep
ing him there in confinement.
When the constitutional convention
of 1849 was selected the old general wa3
a delegate and all went well until it
was proposed to place the representa
tive of a bear in the State coat of arms
at the suggestion of one of the party
that had inaugurated the revolution of
1846. The memory of the inuignity to
which he had been subjected was re
vived and he demanded that if any j
bear went into the State seal it should
be represented as being lassoed by a
vaquero.
Don Pablo de la Guerra was another
native Californian Senator. He was of
distinguished family â one of the oldest
in the territory, and a man of refine
ment and education. His career in the
Legislature extended over many ses
sions and for a time he was ex-offlcio
Lieutenant Governor. At the time of
his death he was holding the office of |

and had entered on a successful law
practice in Stockton. In 1858 he mar

that his widow, Laura D. Fair, shot
and killed Alexander T. Crittenden,
who represented Los Angeles in the
first Assembly, and who wrote upon the
same scroll with Colonel Fair. There
was a bit of gTlm humor in the nota
tion made in the scroll by Crittenden;
he closed it with the words, "Died,

The writing of David C. Broderick is
concise and formal. He was then, as

John Bidwell was a Senator from

Henry E. Robinson was another Sen

the benefit of the poor in San Fran

"I shall be delighted to listen," replied Eastford, "but
before doing so I beg to renew my Invitation, and asK jou
to occupy this easy chair before the fire."
The officer bowed in silence, crossed the room behind
Eastford, and sat down in the armchair, placing ms
sword across his knees. The stranger spread his nanas
before the fire, and seemed to enjoy the comforting
warmth. He remained for a few moments buried in deep
reflection, quite ignoring the presence of his host w no,
glancing upon the hourglass in dispute upon his knees,
seeing that the sands had all run out. silently reversed it,
and set them running again. This action caught the corner
of the strangers eye, and brought him to a realization or
why he was there. Drawing a heavy sigh, he began

East ford listened to this announcement with the idea
that there with something absurd about the statement.
The man sitting there was calmly talking of a time IH
years past, and yet he himself could not be a day more
than 25 years old. Somewhere entangled in this were tue
element! of absurdity. Eastford found himself unable to
unravel them, but the more he thought of the matter the
more reasonable it began to appear.and so, hoping lp srtst
tor had not not.-d the look of surprise on his face, he said
quietly casting his mind back over the history of England,

"Everything went well until we cam.- to the town of
Elsengore, which we captured without the loss of a man.
The capture of the town, however, was or little avail, tor
in the center of it stood a strong citadel, which we tried
to take by assault, but could not. General Trelawny, a
very irascible, hot-headed man, but on the- whole a just
and capable officer, impatient at this unexpected delay,
offered the garrison almost any terms they desired to
evacuate the castle. Hut having had warning or our com
ing they had provisioned the olace. were well
with ammunition and their commander refused to make
terms with General Trelawny.
" 'If you want the place,' said the Frenchman, come
and take it.'
"General Trelawny. angered* at this contemptuous
treatment, flung his men again and again at the citadel,
and that without making the slightest impression on it.
"We were in no wise prepared for a long siege, nor
had we expected stubborn resistance. Marching quickly,
as was our custom heretofore, wo possessed no heavy
artillery, and so were at a disadvantage when attacking
a fortress as strong as that of Elsengore. Meanwhile
General Trelawny sent mounted messengers by different
roads to his chief, giving an account of what had hap
Jersey a few years ago.
Dr. E. Kirby Chamberlain, a Senator
from San Diego and Los Angoles, was
the president pro tern. He had been a
surgeon in the army during the Mexi
can War, and died at sea en route to
the East in December, 1851.
Senator Thomas J. Green from Sac
ramento district was a Jackson Demo
crat of the most pronounced type, a
Southerner by nativity and breeding.
He was a veteran of the Texas revolu
tion, and had been one of the prison
ers in the Castle of Parote. His wife
was possessed of a large fortune and
from It she liberally supplied her hus
band to support his extravagant hab
its. He was proud of his ability to
entertain his friends and did so with
lavish hand. His birthday anniver
sary occurred in January, and he cel
ebrated it in grand style by a big ban
quet and a rousing dance. There was
no business done in either house the
day succeeding the festivities. They
were too much for human endurance,
even in those speedy days. It was truly
a "Legislature of jn thousand drinks,"
and of many thousand more. The Leg
islature elected Green a major-general
before it adjourned â a fitting recogni
tion of the estimate his liberality had
gained for him. He left the State in
early days and died in Warren County,
North Carolina, December 13, 1863.
The Assembly comprised thirty-six
members. The district of San Jose
had three representatives. San Diego
and San Luis Obispo one each, Los An
geles, Santa Barbara, Sonoma and
pened. explaining his delay In Joining the tna'n army, and
asking for definite instructions. He expected that one or
two at least of the mounted messengers sent away every
day would reach his chief and be enabled to return. And
that is exactly what happened, for one day. a dusty horse
man came to General Trelawny's headquarters with a
brief note from Marlborough. The commander-ln-chlef
said:
" 'I think the Frenchman's advice is good. We want
the place, therefore take it.' "
"But he sent no heavy artillery to aid us in this task,
for he could not spare his big guns, expecting aa he did
an important battle. General Trelawny having his work
thus cut out for him, settled down to accomplish it as best
he. might. He quartered officers and men m various parts
of the town, the more thoroughly to keep watch on the
citizens, of whose good intentions, if the siege were pro
longed, we were by no means sure. It fell to my lot to
be lodged in the house of Burgomaster Seidelmier, of
whose conduct I had no reason to complain, for he treated
me well. I was given two rooms, one a large, low apart
ment on the first floor, and communicating directly with
the outside by means of a hall and a separate stairway.
The room was lighted by a long, many-paned window,
leaded and filled with diamond-shaped glass. Beyond this
large drawing 1 room was my bedroom. I must say that.
I enjoyed my stay in Burgomaster Seldelmier's house, not
the less so because he had an only daughter, a most
charming girl. Our acquaintance ripened into deep friend
ship, and afterward intoâ but that has notning to do with
what I have to tell you. My story is or war and not of
love. Gretlich Seidelmier presented me with the hourglass
you have in your hand, and on it I carved the joined
hearts entwined with our similar initials."
"So they are initials, are they?" said Eastford, glanc
ing down at what he had mistaken for twining serpents.
"Yes." said the officer. "I was more accustomed to a
sword than to an etching tool, and the letters are but
rudely drawn. One evening after dark Gretlich and I were
whispering together in the hall, when we heard tnÂ« n^avy
tread of the general coming up the stairs. The girl fled
precipitately, and I. holding open the door, wafted the
approach of my chief. He entered and curtly asked me
to close the' door.
" 'Lieutenant,' he said, 'it is my intention to capture the
citadel to-night. Get together twenty-five of your men and
have them ready under the shadow of this house, but give
no one hint of what you intend to do with th<m. In one
hour's time leave this place as quietly as possible and
make an attack on the western entrance of the citadel.
Your attack is to be but a feint and to draw off their
forces to that point. Still, if any of your men succeed in
Ruining- entrance to the fort, they shall not lack reward
and promotion. Have you a watch?'
" 'Not one that will go, general; but I have an hour
glass here.'
" "Very well, set it running. Collect your men and
exactly ut the hour lead them to the west front; It is but
five minutes' Quick march from here. An nour and five
minutes from this moment I expect you to begin the
attack, and tho moment you are before the western gate
make as much noise as your twenty-five men are capable
of, so as to lead the enemy to believe that the attack ia
atferious one.'
"Saying this, the general turned and made his way,
heavy footed, through the hall and down the stairway.
"I sat the hourglass running, and went at once to call
my men, Ftationing them where I had been ordered to
place them. I returned to have a word with Gretlich
before I rieperted on what I knew was a dangerous mis
sion. Glancing at the hourglass I saw that not more than
a quarter of the sand had run down during my absence.
I remained in the doorway where I could keep an eye on
the hourglass, while the -girl stood leaning her arm against
the angle of the dark passage way. supporting her fair
cheek on her open palm, and, standing thus in the dark
ne.ss, she talked to me in whispers. We talked and talked,
engaged in that sweet, endless conversation that mur
murs in subdued tone round the world, being duplicated
that moment at who knows how many places. Absorbed
as I was in listening, at last there crept into my conscious
ness the fact that the sand in the upper bulb was not
diminishing as fast as it should. This knowledge was

presently:

again and its liberation seemed to unfetter my paralyzed
limbs. Bareheaded as I was, I rushed like one frantic
alonp the passage and down the stairs. The air was
resonant with the quick following reports of the cannon,
and the long narrow street was fitfully lit up as If by
rpiick flashes of summer lightning. My men were still
standing where I had placed them. Giving a quick word
of command. I marched them down the street and out into
the squnre. where I met General Trelawny coming back
from his futile assault. Like myself, he was bareheaded,
ami his white hair bristled with rage. His military
countenance was begrimed with powder smoke, but he
spoke to me with no trace of anger in his voice.
" 'Lieutenant Sentore,' he said, 'disperse your men.*
"I gave the word to disband my men, and then stood
at attention before him.
" 'Lieutenant Sentore,' he said, In the same level voice,
'return to ycuir quarters and consider yourself under
arrest. Await my coming there.'
"I iirned and obeyed his orders. It seemed incredible
that the sand should still be running in the hourglass, for
ago* had passed over my head since lust I was in that
room. I paced up and down awaiting the coming of my
chief, feeling neither fear nor regret, but rather dumb
despair. In a few minutes his heavy tread was on the
stair, followed by the measured tramp of a file of men.
lie came into the room and with him was a sergeant and
four soldiers, fully armed. The general was trembling
with rage, but held strong control over himself, eÂ» was his
habit 'in serious occasions. 'Lieutenant Srntore,' he said,
'w'.iy were you not at your post?'
" 'The running sand in the hourglass' d hardly recog
nized my own voice on hearing it), 'stopped when but half
exhausted. I did not notice its interruption until it was
too Into."
"The general glanced grimly at the hourglass. The
last sands were fulling through to the lower Duib. I saw
that he did not believe my explanation.
" 'It seems now to be in perfect working order.' he
"He strode up to it and reversed it, watching the sand
pour for a few moments, then he spoke abruptly:
" 'Lieutenant Pentore, your sword.'
"I handed my weapon to him without a word. Turning
to the sergeant. "he snid:
" 'Lieutenant Sentore Is sentenced to aeath. He has
an hour for whatever preparations he chooses to make.
Allow him to dispose of that hour as he chooses, so long
as he remains within this room and holds converse with
no one whatever. When the last sands of this hourglass
are run, Lieutenant Sentore will stand at the other end
of this room and meet the death merited by traitors, lag
gards or cowards. Do you understand your duty,
sergeant ?'
" 'Yes, general.
"After that, for a long time, no word was spoken. I
watched my life run readily through the wasp waist of the
transparent glass, then suddenly the sand ceased to flow,
half in the upper bulb, half in the lower. 'It has stopped.'
said the sergeant. 'I must shake the glass.'
" 'Stand WTiere you are,' I commanded sharply. 'Your
orders do not run to that.'
Monterey two each. San Francisco five
and Sacramento and San Joaquin nine
each.
The delegation from San Jose was
composed of Joseph Aram and Elam
Brown, who had been delegates to the
constitutional convention at Monterey,
and the late Dr. Benjamin Corey.
The first Legislature met at the
Pueblo of San Jose, on December 15,
1849. The Capitol building was an
adobe structure 60 feet long, 40 feet
wide, two stories high, and adorned
with a piazza in front. The upper
story, used for the Assembly chamber,
contained but one room. The lower
story was divided into four rooms, the
largest, 40 by 20 feet, being designed
for the accommodation of the Senate
and the others for the secretary and
the committees. The building had been
constructed for a hotel and had been
purchased by the town authorities and
placed at the disposal of the State.
When the Legislature convened the
work of remodeling the structure had
not been completed, and for a time the
Senate met in the residence of Isaac
r.ranham, some little distance away
from the meeting place of the Assem
bly. The gathering of the Legislature of
a new State that was afterward ad
mitted into the Union without going
through the usual form of territorial
government was of itself a novelty and
without precedent, and naturally at
tracted a large number of outsiders, in
dependent and irrespective of the regu
lar organization. Two United States

"The sergeant did not hesitate a moment, but S^*

tip-toed out of the house. Probably more than hair an
hour had passed, during which no man moved, tne ser
geant and his three remallning soldiers seemed afraid to
breathe, then we heard the step of the general himseir
on the stair. I feared that this would give the needed
impetus to the sand in the glass, but when Trelawny
entered the status quo remained. The general stood look
ing at th.> suspended sand, without speaking.
" 'That is what happened before, general, and that is
why I was not at my place.
"The general, .still without a word, advanced to tne
table, slightly shook the hourglass and the sand began to
pour again. Then he picked It up in his hand, examining
it minutely, as ir" it were some kind of a strange toy,
turning it over and over. He glanced up at me and said,
quite in his usual tone, as if nothing in particular had
come between up:
" 'Remarkable thine that. Sentore. isn't Itr
'Very,' 1 answered grimly.
"He put the glass down.
" 'Sergeant, take your men to quarters. Lieutenant
Sentore, I return to you your sword; you can perhaps

sword, I proceeded straightway to disobey again.'
"I had a groat liking for General Trelawny. Knowing
how he fumed and raged at being thus heli helpless by an
apparently Impregnable fortress in the unimportant lov >\\
of Elsengore. I had myself studied the citadel from an
points, and had come to the conclusion that it might De

on the square of the town, nor by the inferior west gates,
but by scaling the seemingly unclimbable cliffs at tne
north side. The wall at the top of this precipice was low.
and owing to the height of the beetling cliff was inem
clently watched by one lone sentinel, who paced the battie
ments from corner tower to corner tower. I had maae
my plans, intending to ask the general's permission _to
risk this venture, but now I resolved to try it without ni3
knowledge or consent, and thus retrieve, if I COU Y?- m >
failure of the foregoing part of the night. Taking with me
a long, thin rope which I had in my room, anticipating
such a trial for It, 1 roused five of my picked meru and
silently we made our way to the foot of the northern
cliff. Here, with the rope around my waist, I worKed my
way diagonally up along a cleft in the reek, which, like
others parallel to it, marked the face of the precipice. A
Blip would be fatal. The loosening of a stone would give
warning to the sentinel, whose slow steps I heard on the
wall above me, but at last I reached a narrow ledge â with
out accident, and standing up in the darkness, my chin
was level with the top of the wall on which the sentry
paced. The shelf between the bottom of tne wall and the
top of the cliff was perhaps three feet in width, and gave
ample room for a man careful of his fsoting.
Aided by the rope, the others, less expert climbers than
myself, made their way to my side one by one, and the
six of us stood on the ledge under the low wall. We were
all in our, stockinged feet, some of the men, in fact, not
even having stockings on. As the sentinel passed, we
crouching in the darkness under the wall, the most stal
wart of our party sprang up behind him. The soldier had
taken off his jacket, and tiptoeing behind the sentinel, he
threw the garment over his head, tightening it with a
twist that nearly choked the man. Then seizing his gun
so that it would' not clatter on the stones, held him thus
helpless while we five climbed up beside him. Feeling
under the Jacket I put my right hand firmly on the senti
nel's throat, and nearly choking the breath out of him.
said:
" 'Your life depends on your actions now. Will you
utter a sound if I let go your throat? 1
"The man shook his head vehemently and I released
my clutch.
" 'Now,* I said to him, 'where is the powder stored?
Answer in a whisper and speak truly.'
" 'The bulk of the powder,' he answered, 'is in the
vault below the citadel."
" 'Where is the rest of it?' I whispered.
" 'In the lower room of the round tower by the gate.'
" 'Nonsense,' I said; 'they would never store It in a
place so liable to attack.'
" 'There was nowhere else to put it.' replied the senti
nel, 'unless they left it in the open courtyard.
" "Is the door to the lower room in the tower bolted?'
" 'There is no door, 1 replied the sentry, 'but a low arch
way. This archway has not been closed, because no
cannon balls ever come from the northern side.'
" 'How much powder is there in this room?'
" 'I do not know; nine or ten barrels, I think.'
"It was evident to me that the fellow, in his fear,
spoke the truth. Now the Question was. how to get down
from the wall into the courtyard, and across that to the
archway at the southern side. Cautioning the sentinel
again that if he made the slightest attempt to escape, or
give the alarm, instant death would be moted to him, I
told him to guide us to the archway, which he did. down
the stone steps that led from the northern wall into tho
courtyard. They seemed to keep loose watch inside, the
only sentinels in the place being those on the upper walls.
But the man we had captured not appearing at his corner
in time, his comrade of the western side became alarmed,
spoke to him, and obtaining no answer, shouted for him,
then discharged his gun.
"Instantly the place was in an uproar. Lights flashed,
and from different guardrooms soldiers poured out. I saw
across the courtyard the archway the sentinel had spoken
of, and calling my men made a dash for it. The besieged
garrison, not expecting an enemy within, had been rushing
up the stone steps at each side to the outer wall to man
the cannon they had so recently quitted, and it was some
minutes before a knowledge of the real state of thing 3
came to them. These few minutes were all we needed
but I saw there was no chance for a slow match, while
if we fired the mine we probably would die under the tot
tering tower.
"By the time we reached the archway and found the
powder barrels, the besieged, finding everything silent out
side, came to a realization of the true condition of affairs.
We faced them with bayonets fixed, while Sept, the man
who had captured the sentinel, took the hatchet he had
brought with him at his girdle, flung over one of the barrels
on its side, knocked in the head of it, allowing the dull
black powder to pour on the cobblestones. Then filling
his hat with the explosive ho came out toward us, leaving
a thick trail behind him. By this time we were sorely
beset, and one of our men had gone down under the fire
of the enemy, who shot wildly, being baffled by the dark
ness, otherwise all of us had been slaughtered. I seized
a musket from a comrade and shouted to the rest:
" 'Save yourselves.' and to the garrison in French t
gave the same warninp. then T fired the musket into the
train of powder, and next instant found myself half
stunned and bleeding at the further end of the "courtyard
The roar of the explosion and the crasn of the falling
tower was deafening. All Elsengore was aroused by the
earthquake shock. I called to my men when I could find
my voice, and Sept answered from one side, and two mora
from another. Together we tottered across the debris
strewn courtyard. Some woodwork inside the citadel had
taken fire and was burning tieroely, and this lit up the
ruins and made visible the great gap in the wall at the
fallen gate. Into the square below we saw the whole
town pouring, .soldiers and civilians alike, coming from
the narrow streets into the open quadrangle. I made my
way, leaning on Sept. over the broken gate and down the
causeway into the square, and there, foremost of all
met my general, with a cloak thrown round him, to make
up for his want of coat.
" 'There, general.' I gasped: 'there is your citadel and
through this gap can we march to meet Marlborough '
" 'Pray. sir. who the devil are you?" crted the general
for my face was like that of a blackamoor.
" 'I am the lieutenant who has once more disobeyed
your orders, general, in the hope of retrieving a former
mistake.'
" 'Sentore!' he cried, rapping out an oath. 'I shall have
you courtmartialed, sir.'
"'I think, general.' I said, 'that /I am courtmartialed
already,' for I thought then that the hand of death was
upon me, which shows the effect of imagination for mv
wounds were not serious, yet I sank down at the general's
feet. He raised me in his arms as if I had been his own,
son. and thus carried me to my rooms. Seven years later
when the war endod. I got leave of absence 'and came
back to Elsengore for Gretlich Seidelmier and the hour
glass."
As the lieutenant ceased speaking Eastford thought ha
heard again the explosion at the tower, and started to hi*
feet in nervous alarm, then looked at the lieutenant and
laughed, while he said:
"Lieutenant, I was startled by that noise Just now,
and thought for the moment that I was In Brabant You
have made good your claim to the hourglass, and you are
welcome to it."
But as he spoke he turned his eyes toward the chair in
which the lieutenant had been seated, and found it vacant

feet was the shattered hourglass, which Hart fallen from
his knees, its blood-red sand mingling with the colors on

cial officers were to be chosen and
then, as now, such important political
events caused no little excitement
among all classes. More especially was
the Interest felt by the political adven
turers from other States who had join
ed in the rush to the Pacific in an
ticipation of securing good hands in
the new deal in the pame of politics in
this then far-away region. There was
no lack of patriots anxious to serve
their country for the pood recompense
that promised.
Then again, many important meas
ures were to be considered, and some
of them promised rich pickings for the
lobby and for those who were more
directly concerned.
"Cinch" bills could not nvail, for the
country was too new for the founding
of any enterprises that could be af
fected by hostile legislation, but the
shrewder ones foresaw the advantage
that could be gained to them by the
passage of favorable measures, and
werp keen to anticipate the ease with
which a primitive body could be
handled.
The accommodations in San Jose
were inadequate for the sudden in
crease to its population, and naturally
such as could be afforded were held at
gilt-edge prices. The principal public
house was the City Hotel, and the
charges were fully commensurate with
the exigencies of the times â the rate
being $5 a day in gold coin. A dinner
cost %2, and an ordinary shake-down
bunk on the floor was $1 a night. The
Mansion House, that was constructed
during the year with adobe walls, at a
cost of $100,000, was later on in the ses
sion the hotel of the place. A large
portion of the throng was compelled to
lodge in a room denominated "the cor
ral." and it was a favorite pastime
with some of the occupants whose rest
waa disturbed b- the candle of some
party who indulged in the dangerous
and highly reprehensible practice of
reading in bed to put out his light with
a shot from a revolver, and even those
carrying a light to find their resting
place were sometimes taken aback by
finding their candles snuffed in a simi
larly unceremonious way. Those who
fired were marksmen; their aim waa
true and they knew it.
The accommodations and prices na
turally created considerable feeling of
Indignation among the members, and

George B. Tingley introduced in thÂ«
Assembly a bill to remove the seat of
government to Monterey. The bill im
mediately assed first reading, but it
produced the desired effect and waa al
lowed to die a natural death. The citi
zens of San Jose becoming alarmed at
the continued grumbling and the threat
to remove the Legislature, determined
that it was necessary to do something
to placate the members and accordingly
arranged for a grand ball to be given
in the Assembly chamber.
The "Legislature uf a thousand
drinks" perhaps justly earned its de
signation. But the code of laws It en
acted was singularly perfect, when
it is considered the disadvantages
under which the labor was performed.
They had but few statutes of other
States for guidance, and conditions
were such in the new State that de
manded laws of entirely original draft
ing and dissimilar with those of any
of the sister States.
WINFIELD J. DAVIS.OUR VOLUNTEERS
OFF TO THE PHILIPPINES
THE first vessel to transport Uni
ted States troops to Manila is the
well-known China mail steamer
the City of Peking. Captain
Smith, her commander, speaks with au
thority and with ti utmost confidence
of the prospects of the voyage.
â¢'There need be no fear abc-ut the
health of the troops en route," he said.
"We are taking every precaution. As
far as I know at present we will carry
about 1600 men, including a number of
marines. They will occupy the whole
of the steerage deck, with free ventila
tion fore and aft, not to mention any
number of ventilators and wind sails.
The men will not sleep in swinging
hammocks, a? on a man-of -war, but in
what are known as standee hammocks,
canvas cots slung between posts. Every
rare will be taken to insure cleanliness
and to maintain perfect sanitary con
ditions.
"My ship could with- ease carry 2000
men so that there will be no over
crow ling. The ship will be provisioned
by the military authorities. I have
nothing: to do with that, but doubtless
our soldiers will be fed as well as is
possible on a large troopship. We are
not carrying ordinary passengers, the
whole ship having been given over to
the Government. The cabin accommo
dations will be occupied by the officers,
and Lieutenant-" 'ommander Gibson is
going as naval representative of the
Government. He does not command
the vessel, but is simply there in an ad
visory capacity. I shall retain entire
control of my ship and will take her
wherever the authorities direct.

about the plague in Manila, but I do
not think the troops need fear any
thing on that score. Tho bubonic plague

"There is one very Important point to
which I have already drawn the atten

that is the necessity of providing light

to expect men to serve in the tropics

;o shield them from the sun. They can
not campaign in blue woolen cloth. If
there should be any sickness during
the voyage we are well prepared to
meet it. We carry two surgeons, and
iiave a fine hospital on board.
"The length of our voyage will de
pend upon whether we are to be es
orted by the Charleston. Probably we
will call at Honolulu for ccal, though
we can carry 2000 tonsâ enough to
take us to the Philippines and
leave a week's supply to spare.
But we want to get there with
all the coal we can, so as not to
reduce Admiral 'De â 's supply. It
is 7250 miles to Manila. If we go un
der the Charleston's convoy we will
only be able to steam ten or eleven
knots an hour, for the cruiser, with her
limited coal capacity, cannot make the
passage at a greater speed. Thus the
voyage would require thirty days.
"On the other hand, if we go alone
and unprotected we can easily make
fourteen knots, and thus accomplish
the trip in twenty-two days.
"My crew has behaved in a curious
manner. You know that in this trade
we usually carry Chinamen, but
the fellows heard that we were going
into the transport trade they mutinied
in a body. They remember the Japa
nese war and the sinking of a Chinese
transport with over a thousand men on
board. We offered them double pay,
but nothing would induce them to make
the voyage. So we will have to send
them back by another steamer and
ship a white crew.
"Though we are not supposed to
rarry any civilian passengers, I got a
telegram from Poulteney Bigelow ask
ing for a berth. He states that he has
the consent of the Government to ac
company us. Of course I have nothing
to do with it: the whole ship has been
chartered by the authorities, and it is
their business whom they take."

I SAW Admiral Dewey frequently
when at Hongkong," said Captain
Smith of the City of Peking. "Just
before we left I had a loner conver-
sation with him, when I remarked
jokingly: I suppose you are anxious to
be off and to have a brush with those
Spaniards.'
" 'I guess it will take us about half
an hour to finish them off,' replied
Dewey, confidently. He has been as
good as his word.
"The same spirit of confidence in the
ships and their commanders prevailed
throughout the entire fleet. I never
saw a finer or better disciplined body
of men in my life and the ships were
kept in magnificent fighting condition.
"All the foreign officers at Hongkong
were loud in their expressions of ad
miration for the American fleet, and

aad made common cause against the
foreigner who could not speak their
tongue. Dewey's splendid victory did ;
net surprise me a bit, for every one :
who has served in the East knows the
utterly rotten condition of the Spanish
ships and the inefficiency of their
crews.
"Hongkong expected the victory and
will be delighted with it. The mer- '
chants there would welcome the Amer- I

then there would be a chance to de- j
velop the resources of the group.
"The islands axe enormously wealthy
In natural produce, but the system of ;
Spanish squeeze has prevented any
great expansion of trade. These high
Spanish officials are quite as bad as
the Chinese mandarins, and their whole
system of administration is utterly
corrupt. Even as it is there are half
a dozen steamers constantly running
between Manila and Hongkong: there
is a large trade in sugar cane for the
Hongkong mills, and the business is
capable of gre.it expansion.
"The American cause is decidedly i
popular among all classes in the East.
Everybody wants to see the Philippines
brought under some proper system of
civilized government, and the down
fall of Spanish corruption will be uni
versally welcomed."
THE departure of our soldiers for
4he Philippines, besides marking
a new era in the political history
of the United States, will provide
a distinctly novel personal expe
rience for most of those engaged in the j
expedition. The nation has suddenly
realised that it cannot get along any >
more without a foreign policy, it can no
longer restrict its warlike operations to
Its own borders, its troops will have to ;
seek their fighting abroad. So that in ;
years to come, our soldiers are likely
to get plenty of tropical campaigning,
a thing which at present is a decided
novelty to the boys in blue who com
pose the army corps.
The tropical East has a decided fas
cination for all of us. It is difficult to
analyze this mysterious attraction, it is
made up of so many different features,
all blending into one fragrant, luxuri
ant whole. But the outcome of it is
that like Kipling's soldier, when we ,
have heard the East a-calling, we don t I
heed nothin 1 else. And if this is true of
India a land of many climes, it is still
more 'true of the Philippines, lying well
within the tropics, between latitudes 4
and 20 north. These isles possess all
the features necessary for the develop
ment uf the most luxuriant tropical
vegetation. Naturally the climate is
extremely moist. This is only to be ex
pected in a land situated in the neutral
zone between the monsoons and the
trade winds. But though the rainfall is
heavy, it is concentrated into one sea
son of three or four months. Practi
cally, there are three seasonsâ the cold,
the wet and the hot.
The cold season, which is decidedly
the pleasantest time of the year, lasts
from November to March. The winds
blow fresh and cool from the north, and
in Manila the average temperature is
only 72 degrees. But little rain falls
during this periodâ some eight or nine
inches. Following comes the hot season,
from March to Juneâ and Just at pres
ent this season is by far the must in
teresting period to Californians. Our
boys will land toward the close of this
time, and unfortunately will get their
first tropical experience at the most un
favorable period of ihe year. It would
have been far better if the expedition
could have reached Manila six months
earlier, for then the soldiers would
have had the cold season to become ac
climatized in. But war, cruel war.
takes no count of such trifles as human
health. The time for prompt action
has arrived, and the opportunity can
not be lost because of a few cases of
sickness.
Luckily, the climate of Manila has the
reputation of being a fairly healthy
one. and even in the hot season th^
temperature does not average more
than 8S degrees. The Spaniards, in
deed, say that the heat is not so trying
as in Madrid during the summer
days, and certainly it can be no worse \
than some parts of the interior of this
State. This oppressive condition of af
fairs, when all nature seems exhausted, j
and human energy is at its lowest ebb,
comes to an end in July. The welcome
monsoon wind arrives, black and thun
derous, from the southward, and breaks
Ayith terrible storms upon the island.
The rain falls in torrents, and the
germs of pestilence which have been ;
accumulating during the hot season are i
swept away. Nature washes herself j
clean, new tropical growths of amazing ;
luxuriance spring up almost in a day
and the land riots in the abundance of
life-giving moisture.
As much as sixty-six Inches of rain
have been known to fall in 113 days
during the monsoon time. But this is
exceptional, the average being about
thirty-six inches. The temperature is
still warm, only a few degrees lower
than the hot season, and perhaps our
unseasoned soldiers, accustomed all
their lives to a dry, equable clime, will
find this season the most trying of the
three. Fever and ague, rheumatism,
dysentery and various other disorders
incidental to the tropics will be most
apt to break out among men exposed
at this season of the year, and if the
troops are compelled to operate in the
open the utmost watchfulness on the
part of the medical staff will be neces
sary to preserve even a fair average of
health. However, it is to be trusted
that nothing more than garrison duty
will be required of our men during the
rainy days, in which case, well clad
and under gnod roofs, no serious sani-
Jtary trouble need be apprehended.
Our troops are likely to be on the best
of terms with the natives. There is a
common bond of sympathy between
them â enmity for the Spaniard. Even
the Chinese, of whom there are a large
number in the group, will welcome the
American heartily, for John, more than
any one else, has suffered from the au
sterity of Spanish rule. The native Ta
gals, who Inhabit the larger portion of
Luzon, are described as being of a sim
ple, honest, industrious character, eas
ily amenable to control. They have
been governed for centuries rather by
the priests than by the civil power. The
Catholic church by means of its mis
sionaries first conquered the natives,
and since then has always led them.
The people have been educated; they
can read and write; they are good na
tured and cheerful, happy, contented
and fairly prosperous, in spite of the
earthquakes, floods and other terrible
calamities which often desolate their
land.
With John Chinaman the case Is very
different. He carries on most of the
business of the Islands, and forms a
very Important factor in the popula
tion. This in spite of the fact that the
Spaniard, time and again, has done his
best to wipe him out. There is an
hereditary hatred between the races,
and the Americans may rely upon get
ting the warmest aid from the Chinese
in their task of driving the Spaniards
out of the Orient. In reality the Chinese
were the first comers. They occupied
the Philippines even before the Span
iards captured the isles, toward the
close of the sixteenth century. If they
had been left alone they would prob
ably have overrun the land, but the
Spaniards adopted a rough and ready
method of keeping them down by fre
quent massacres.
Six thousand was the maximum num
ber of Chinamen allowed to live in the
land. When this limit was exceeded a
massacre was decreed, and even so late
as 1819 we find the Spanish butchers
engaged in this barbarous work. In
17G2, when the British conquered and
held Manila, the Chinese gave the in
vaders every assistance, and for this,
when the islands were restored to the
Spanish, a decree of extermination was
issued. The Governor simply ordered
that all the Chinese in the Philippines
should be hanged, and it is believed
that this inhuman command was actu
ally put into effect.
Of course the good ladles of the Red
Cross League, who have been working
so busily during the last few weeks,
will see to it that our men do not go
away unprepared for the trials of a
tropical clime. Perhaps the first and
most important requisite for a soldier
in this country is the cholera belt, such
as is universally worn in the Indian
STRANGE TRIBE OF INDIANS
FOUND IN THE BERING SEA.
Three adventurers, just back from the far north report having run across a strange tribe of In
dians on an Island. The men are big and powerful; so are the women, for the latter think nothing, ac
cording to the story, of lifting boxes weighing three and four hundred pounds. They subsist on fish kept
in the frozen ground. They build a peculiar hut of their own make high up against the cliffs. Where
the tribe originally came from is a mystery to the sailors, as they claim there are no Indians like
them anywhere in that region.
FREDERICK WALKER, Joseph
Schomanoff and James Aiken
have just returned to San Fran
cisco via Seattle from a cruise
of adventure and discovery
among the waters of the north
ern territory. They tell of a remark
able tribe of Indians whom they found
inhabiting an inland near the sixty
fifth' parallel of latitude and south of
Bering Strait, railed Kings Island.
The Indians scorned to belong to the
Innuit or Eskimo family, as they pre
sented the same physical characteris
tics as these people, they being large,
the men generally over six feet, with
small black eyes, high cheek bones, yel
low skin, brown hair and full brown
beards half concealing thick lips. In
the corners of the lower lips of many
of the men holes had been punched, in
which pendant ornaments were worn.
The people appeared docile and agree
able, and when the strangers went
among them they offered them no
harm.
A surprising feature of the tribe was
the stature and strength of the women.
They were equally as tall, if not taller,
than the men. and fully as stout as
their lords. They did not display the
barbarous ornaments upon their faces
with which men increase the esteem
in which they hold one another, and
they were much better looking than the
males.
Their strength of body was wonder
ful. One of these women, It Is related,
carried off In her birch-bark canoe an
800-pound stone for use as an anchor
to the whaler's boat. When It reached
the vessel's deck it required two men
to lift it and they were strong men,
too, though the woman had not found
the moving of It beyond her powers.
One woman. It was stated, lifted a box
containing 280 pounds of lead and car
ried it upon her shoulders. When food
is scarce they will frequently travel
thirty or forty miles without eating,
going over the country on the main
land in search of wherewithal to sus
tain life. Both men and women ap
pear to be endowed with remarkable
vigor and power. They are highly
athletic and can outrun and outjump
any persons of any other race pitted
against them.
This physical vigor is extraordinary
to be produced by the kind of food they
consume. They live on carrion fish
and seal oil. The fish, generally the
salmon, are caught in the fall and bur
iod in the ground intact, without the
entrails being removed. They are so
kept throughout the winter while the
thermometer ranges from HO to 40 de
grees below zero, and they are dug
up as consumption requires. When thej
are brought to the air they have the
appearance of sound fish, but their
stench is unbearable to the civilized
nose.
The island is a great mass of black
rock, basaltic in texture, abuut a mile
long and two-thirds of a mile wide,
with perpendicular cliffs one thousand
feet high frowning upon the ocean on
three sides. On the south this wall has
fallen and a steep rift of a canyon,
filled with rocks and snow, cuts up
from the water's edge to the top of the
island. At the lower end of this ravine,
and in the tall side of the basalt, there
is a cave worn into the rock by the
restless action of the waves. The ocean
surf roars and splashes at its mouth,
and at high tide that mouth is nearly
closed by the sea. But in the rear of
the cave there is a great filling or bunk
of perpetual snow. How it gets there
is a question, unless there is a rift in the
rock to connect with the snow mass in
the ravine, which is probably the case.
In this cave snow the Indians have ex
cavated rooms in which they store
their walrus and seal meat and whale
blubber. There such provision quickly
freezes and is kept so congealed indefi
nitely, or until needed for use.
Where these people have come from
is the curious problem in the estima
tion of the three whalers; as a few
years ago the island was almost en
tirely depopulated of its inhabitants by
starvation.
Food in that region is no longer so
abundant as to be readily obtainable
with the primitive weapons end imple
ments used by Indians. The American
whalers from the south have nearly
rid the w r aters of the white whale, the
great food of these natives, and what
fish of this variety there is now seeks
the protection of the frozen ocean: or
if the fish venture south through the
strait they are so wild and timid that it
is rarely possible that an Indian vil
lager can catch one of them.
The walrus, too, such an important
animal in the Eskimo's scheme of rub
slstence, has so nearly disappeared
that the 'visit of one about the island is
now a rarity. The whalers have caught
and destroyed them for the ivory of
their tusks. The caribou on the main
land are all gone, and the Indian is
now forced to subsist mainly on small
fish and sea lions. Some of the salmon,
however, are enormously large, being
five feet long and weighing as much as
120 pounds. Their skins are heavy and
tough and when scaled and tanned
are used to cover blarkasâ the Eskimo
boat.
The Indians have lately turned to
fishing for deep water cod, the supply
of which is inconceivable, as the re
source is yet comparatively undis
turbed. They have to fish in about
forty fathoms of water, and, equipped
with only their si.iall boats, and with
no pulleys upon which to reel up the
lines, it is exceedingly difficult work.
They are well rewarded for their la
bors, however, as every line draws up
from three to five cod. according to the
number of their bone hooks used, each
fish weighing from twenty to thirty
pounds.
It would seem that with such facili
ties for cold storage these Kings Island
Indians could so preserve their food
that It would have a more agreeable
flavor to the sensitive palate. But the
service. It consists simply of a strip
of flannel about a foot wide, and long
enough to enolrcle the stomach. It can
be fastened either with tapes or but
tons. Each man should have at least
two of these invaluable articles, for
their constant use, both day and night,
will do more to check cholera and pn
teric diseases than any amount of med
icine.
Mosquito nets will also be a neces
sity in this clime, where every kind 01
flying and stinging pest abounds, and
a water-proof sheet, made of Btout In
dia rubber, will also be required. To
sleep on the ground during the wet sea
son without one of these sheets would
be almost certain to produce serious
results, and, in fact, in that warm at
mosphere, the rubber sheet will be
about all the bedding a soldier need
carry with him.
Each soldier should be provided with
"a housewife," a homely, old-fashion
ed, but very useful institution. In this
little roll you can carry needles and
thread, sticking plaster, scissors and a
Eskimo taste is a curious anomaly.
Mr. Walker says that while anchored
off the Island a party or the men came
aboard, and while his back was turned
they took up and drank a gallon of lin
seed oil, which was standing in a ves
sel upon the deck awaiting use in some
painting operation. And Mr. Aiken
states that men cast ashore among
them have starved to death, unable to
eat their food. Their cravings for food
would be voracious and they would
take the stuff into their stomachs, but

host of other useful articles. Every
one who has done any campaigning
knows how one's buttons go and
clothes give out at the most unexpected
moments, and every good soldier must
be prepared to repair his raiment at
any time.
Every soldier carries, or should carry,
a first aid bandage with him, and this,
if a few simple rules are only studied,
can be applied In dozens of different
ways.
It may seem trivial to refer to these
minor details when men are leaving full
of ardor for their country's service, and
willing to do and dare anything for the
cause. But a good soldier should al
ways remember that the first duty he
owes to his country is to preserve his
own health intact.
And If he neglects the very simple
precaution of soaping his socks before
a long march, he is very likely to be
come footsore, and so destroy his valuo
entirely, for a soldier's ability to serve
his country depends entirely on the
state of his feet.
this organ would revolt and refuse to
retain it. So they would die amid min
gled sufferings of nausea and pangs of
hunger.
But the most remarkable feature In
connection with these Indians is their
habitations. They are cave dwellers,
the only known people having caves for
dwellings now upon the North Ameri
can continent, and perhaps in the
world. And their residences are pe
culiar and far different from those of
the cliff dwellers of New Mexico, who
burrowed their holes in the sides of
the mesas. TheÃe houses are exca
vated In the sides of a hill, the cham
ber being pierced some feet into the
rise and walled up on three sides, in
blown off into the sea, It is strongly
front with stones. Across the top of
the stone walls are laid poles which
they gather from the drift wood of the
island. And upon these improvised
rafters are placed hides, grass, and
lastly a layer of dirt.
You do not enter this home direct
ly, but the ingress is from the end of
a long, low tunnel-like hall, covered
with the same kinds of rafters and
roof as is the house. This passage
way is from twelve to fifteen feet long
and it does not abut ag-ainst the apart
ment to which it leads, and upon a level
with it, but ends below it, and you rise
out of the hall into the house through
an elghteen-inch hole In the top of one
and in the floor of the other.
This is the only means of getting into
the house, and one must proceed upon
the hands and knees to accomplish
this. Why these people should adopt
this strange style of architecture is an
interesting problem, to the solution of
which no theories have been advanced
unless it be to protect the entrance
from the outer cold and snow; and yet,
aÂ« none of the other Alaskans have
any such ideas, and they all endure
the same cold, it seems curious that
such a notion should have sprung up
among this tribe.
In the summer these caves become
too damp to live in. and the residents
then build a summer house on the top
of the winter one. They raise a wooden
frame and stretch seal hides upon it
and so made a room from ten to fifteen
feet square. They abandon their long
passageway for the season and enter
their apartments by an oval hole cut
in the skin about two feet above the
ground. To prevent this structure
from being torn away by the wind and
guyed to the rocks of the hill with
rawhide ropes. A board walk leads
from the .front of the house around to
the hill against which it backs.
It is a strange and curious sight to
behold, these odd dwellings ranged
against the hills, setting one above an
other, the topmost perhaps overlook
ing forty of such houses. It is esti
mated that 200 people live in this vil
lage which is called Ouk-ivak, and
which is certainly one of the most ex
traordinarily constructed places in thÂ«
world.

At the home of Mr. and Mrs. â William
H. Mills, 2800 Jackson street, a reception
was tendered last Saturday afternoon to
Mrs. Herman Perry by her former pupils,
who attended the Perry Seminary in Sac
ramento, which was founded by Mr. and
Mrs. Herman Perry in 1863.
Mrs. Perry, who has been residing in
Chicago, came to this city a short time
ago as the guest of Mrs. Mills, who was
a member of the first graduating class
from the seminary.
It was not long before her pupils knew
of her visit, and they decided to have a
reunion of the young women who had re
ceived their education at the Sacramento
Young Ladies' Seminary, so a committee
of them took the matter In hand and
sent word by letter to a large -number re
siding throughout the State.
Those of the former pupils who could

sent telegrams and letters of congratula

Over seventy families attended the re
union, which was held between the hours
of 1 and 6 o'clock. Husbands and chil

happy, social time was had. as many of
the pupils hnd not seen each other since
their schooldays and remembrances of
those times were exchanged between
them.
On Saturday evening last Miss Marie

Where
To
Find Jhem.
THE PRETTIEST WILD FLOWERS
The originals of these poppies were found by Miss Alexander and party at Ocean View on April 14, 1890. The flowers
contained sixteen petals and looked more like a large rose than a poppy, but in every other way than size each one was
like a poppy. It was considered at this time to be one of the most marvelous "freak" flowers ever gathered.
A little later Miss Alexander was fortunate enough to find in the same field five of the largest popples ever heard of.
After being flattened out they measured eight inches in diameter and contained but iour petals. The petals of these were
very thick and as tough as leather.
WILD FLOWERS, once so
plentiful in the Immediate
vicinity of San Francisco, are
becoming rare. That is what
Miss E. C. Alexander says:
and she, of all people, should be able
to speak with authority on the sub
jeot.
For eleven years Miss Alexander has
devoted her time to the collection and
preservation of wild flowers. For flow
ers that once could be plucked at the
"back door" of San Francisco she finds
it necessary now to trsfvel miles and
mile? to obtain.
"Nine years ago," she said, " cream
caps grew in great profusion all around
San Francisco. The most beautiful
ones that I have ever seen were near
Holy Cross Cemetery. I have picked
dozens of them in former years as large
as a dollar. But now you can scarcely
find a plant, and the blossoms are
small and of an inferior quality. A
great many other varieties of flowers
that once were plentiful have disap-
peared entirely.
"I think the grldlronlnff of the ad-
paired to the dining-room, where a sump
tuous repast was served. The table dec
orations were red, white and blue flowers
and the walls were festooned in red,
white and blue bunting and flags, In
honor of our victory at Manila. After the
supper the mirth, music and dancing was
continued. The success of the affair was
due to Miss Emily Suter.
A very pleasant musical evening was
spent at the home of Miss Blanche
Barker on Castro Heights Thursday even
ing, May 5. The guests were all talented
and music-loving people. Some very beau
tiful vocal solos were rendered by C. L.
Long, G. H. Alden, W. Wilson, J. Egan
and Miss Juanita Coad while Messrs.
Cline, Wise and Gianini were perfect as
a trio. There was also some very enjoy
able music from a graphophone and some
piano solos by Mrs. G. C. Alden and
others. Among those present were: Mrs.

jacent fields by the electric cars is the
cause of the scarcity and disappearance
of the wild flowers. The people who go
off on little jaunts on the numerous
car lines that have lately sprung into
existence are to blame for the passing
away of the flowers. All the seques
tered spots and nooks around the city
are now reached by car lines, which
once only the pedestrian could enjoy.
"The people. Instead of picking the
flowers carefully, pluck them with
ruthless hands, often pulling up the en
tire plant by the roots. This wholesale
uprooting of the plants is responsible
for their disappearance. Such action
is criminal in the eyes of flower lovers.
Some effort should be made to stop this
vandalism or wild flowers around San
Francisco will be entirely a thing of the
past."
Miss Alexander has the finest collec
tion of wild flowers in the State. The
method by which she preserves them is
a carefully guarded secret. For eleven
years, with the aid of a skilled chemist.
Miss Alexander has experimented until
now she has a chemical process by
which the wild flowers can be preserved
so as to keep their natural color.

experimenting, she has not been able as
yet to find a process that will preserve
the poppy in its natural form and bril

lately been formed. A "walking club"
Is exactly what its name signifies. A
number of people with sedentary occu
pations form a club for the purpose of j
taking a long walk once a week. In the |
beginning of the season the walks
planned are limited to a comparatively
small number of miles. Each time the i
distance is increased, and before the ;
end of the summer the members find j
that they can put a professional sprin
ter on his mettle.
The number of these clubs this year
is surprisingly large. The doctors are
strongly in favor of them, but say
that if people begin to take the proper
amount and kind of exercise they will j
have to close their doors. It is held
that a purposeless ramble has not the
beneficial effect of one with an object
in view. So the supporters of this the
ory are going to "botanize" and collect
specimens of wild flowers. One member
of a "walking club" last year collected
''GO varieties of wild flowers within a
radius of thirty miles, with San Fran
cisco as the center.
Only thecommon name of the flowers
is given in the following list; they will
thus be more easily recognised than
by their polysyllabic botanical names: I
The marlpoea lily is found in greatest
profusion along the line of the <- ali-
FJrnfa and Nevada Railroad that runs
twentv-elght miles out of Berkeley.
The 'finest poppies are near ban Kru
no and the best months in the year
to gather them are October and No-
V Baby blue eyes grow almost the year
around and in a groat many localities,
but the choicest are near Menlo Park.
Orchids are most plentiful in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, and June is
the month for them. _ t
Wild pansies, one of the daintiest of
wild flowers, grow in great profusion
around Millbrae.
Fritillaria are found in early spring
on Mount Tamalpais. The blood-red
variety has always tear drops on the
petals" There is a curious legend told
in connection with this peculiarity.
This flower, so rufis the le'gen'l, grew
at the foot of the cross at the time of
the crucifixion. It was pure white and
held its cup up. During the crucifixion
It drooped, turned blood red and tear
drops appeared on the petals, which
have remained ever since.
The rock cress is a spring flower that
can be found in abundance everywhere.
The spider wort, an April flower that
Is rare, is found on the hills beyond
Mill Valley.
The yellow violet grows In profusion
during the month of February near
Felton.
The 1 anemones are found In th*
greatest variety in Mill Valley.
The spring beauty, our first spring
flower, is found in the white and lav
ender varieties In Ross Valley.
The euchardium, a native of thel
Swill Alps, grows in the neighbor
hood of Fairfax during the month of
June.
The cream <*ups come in April and
grow in equal profusion in all the
flower localities.
The columbine grows on Mount St.
Bruno all the year around.
The red larkspur blooms at San An-
Belmo in June. It is rare.
Indian pinks grow in great profusion
during June. They cap be found on
all the surrounding hills.
Bridal wreath blossoms in May.
Tamalpais has the greatest variety.
The wild forget-me-not blooms In
March along the San Bruno road.
The purple larkspur can be found
in all seasons and places.
The sea pink blooms during April
and beautiful varieties are found near
Ocean View.
The wild snap dragon is found wher
ever there is water.
The wild immortelle grows under the
cedar trees.
The wild marigold is common, but
most profuse during April.
The wild lilies of the valley grow on
the rocks during June.
Hare bells are plentiful during June j
near Glenwood.
Spotted primroses are rare in this
locality, Tamalpais being about the
only place to find them. Near San
Luis Obispo they are more plentiful.
The wild strawberry geraniums grow
on the rocks during February and
March.
The azalea is found during June on
Tamalpais and Boulder Creek.
English daisies grow in Sequoia Can
yon In March.
Shooting stars are most plentiful In
February near Fairfax.
Sun flowers bloom In profusion In
May along the San Mateo road.
The Spanish broom grows in and
around San Rafael. June is its month.
These are the most common varie
ties of wild flowers in this vicinity.
Often, though, one stumbles upon not
only rare varieties, but "floral freaks.'
The greatest varieties are found from
Marrh to June, but the rarest blossom
from December to Pebruarv.

A couple of Klondlkers now on their
way to St. Michael aboard the schooner
J. B. Leeds will long 1 remember their
trip to the frozen north. All the pas
sengers were told that the vessel would
Bail during the afternoon of last Fri
day, but two of them, Including the secre
tary of the Aurora Gold Mining Com
l>;my, decided in their own minds that it
â would be at least 5 p.m. before the vessel
would get away. Long before that hour
the launches belonging to the Wlnthrop
Gold Mining Company and the Aurora
Gold Mining Company had been hoisted
aboard and all the gold hunters, with the
exception of the two named, were in the
cabin and everything was ready for de
parture. After waiting an hour. Captain
Nielsen decided that patience had ceased
to be a virtue, and he told the captain
of the tug Liberty to make fast and
â¢' w him to sea.
When the Leeds was passing out over
the bar the belated passengers showed
up at the seawall and, much to their
disgust, found the vessel gone with their
outfits and, in fact, almost everything
they owned in the world. They rushed to
the Red Stack tug oflice, auJ aftt-r some
trouble set ured the tug Sea Witch and
started alter the Leeds. At Fort Poii*.
thÂ«'y met the Liberty returning, and
Captain Harvey told the captain of the
Witch that it was very thick out- j
tnd the p.hancea were against him
lindir.g the schooner. Captain Tonnesen
rdered to keep on, and when the bar
v, as reached the gold hunters succumbed.
They were so soa sick that when the
â  was finally overhauled they had
to be lowered into the skiff that was to '
t:ike them aboard and rope and tackle
had to be put into requisition to get
onto the vessel. Captain Nielsen i
would not heave to. as he said it served ,
the men right to be left, as they knew j
sailing hour and should have been
on time. In consequence the two men
thorough drenching besides their
seasickness as v. result oi' their trip up
town.
Lightship 70 does not seem to possess
many attractions for cooks, deckhands
ii.nil firemen. In fact, after spending v
few duy.s on her they seem to get tired of
the tumble and the tossing on the bar
and manifest a great desire to return to
anna. Even the fear of their
b not enough to keep them at
â nd they take every opportunity of
leavint that comes along.
After the lightship had La_j.-u in commis

body, and Captain Lowell had to
ashore for men to replace them. Nexl
the two :iremen deserted theft- posi

Bonlta took out two nv-n. and yes

The newly constructed reservoir on top
of the Southern Heights has been finished

water just &s soon as the Spring Valley
Water Company can get the pipes laid
through the streets of the Potrero sec
tiotk In this the company has met with
thÂ«- co-operation of the Potrero Land and
Improvement Company through the exer
tions of Contractor V.'hitley, who has
bad a KanÂ« of men steadily employed fur
the past month in grading the streets
leading to the reservoir and from there
to the thickly settled portion of the
heights, where the residents have in the
past suffered because of the non-supply
vf water, other than what they could oh
taln from a supply cart.
With an abundance of water the dis
trict will now be in a position to ask from
the Supervisors the necessary fire protec
tion in the distribution of hydrants. Here
tofore a fire in any portion of the South
ern Heights meant the total destruction
of the building attacked.
The Potrero Land and Development
Company, through Contractor Whitley,
h;:.s done considerable work on the
heights within the past year in grading,
sewering and macadamizing streets that
heretofore only existed on the official
map.
Henceforth the thousands of mechanics
and laboring men who work at the many
branches of industry in the busy Potrero

short distance of their places of employ
in which themselvew and their fam
ilies will have superior sanitary surround

THE SA:N T FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
HE PAID THE
DOCTOR'S BILL
Millionaire Nevills' Inter
est in Mrs. Elsie
Williams.
Azhdaerian Had a Desire to
"Pull the Old Man's Leg"
for a Large Sum.
Preliminary Examination on the
Charge of Extortion Commenced
Before Judge Joachimsen.
In the expectation of some racy de
velopments Judge Joachimsen's court
room was crowded yesterday morning
when the case of Myron H. Azhdaerian,
Mrs. Elsie Williams and Mrs. Grace
Loose, charged with extortion by the
Mrs. Mary Donoho, Re-elected
Secretary of the California
State Assembly of the Re
bekahs.
millionaire, W. A. Nevills, was called.
The crowd was sadly disappointed.
The prosecution was represented by
District Attorney Barnes, Assistant
I District Attorney Dunne and Prosecut-
I ing Attorney Graham. Attorney
George W. Baker and ex-Judge Ferral
appeared for the defendants. The
| charge aginst them was the alleged ex
j tortlon of $2000 from Nevills on Febru
i ary 25. while he was sick in bed in the
j Palace Hotel, by threatening to expose
I him for being false to his marriage
i vows.
Dr. Winslow Anderson was the first
! witness called, and he was examined
iby Dunne. He testified to treating a
â  lady patient at the McNutt Hospital
: who was known as Miss Nea). She went
to the hospital about March 1 and re
â  muined about a month. He identified
Mrs. Williams as the lady. He had
seen her a few days before in the room
! of Captain Neville at the Palace Hotel.
i At that time when he entered the room
I unannounced the captain was sitting
; up in bed propped by pillows and was
writing in a book like a check hook.
: A Mrs. Newcomb, the nurse and valet
were also in the room.
Cross-examined by Baker, the wit
ness said that when Mrs. Williams was
i in the hospital Nevills called to see her,
and every day inquired for her. He re
ceived a check for $217 from Mrs. Wil
liams for her treatment, which was
I signed by Nevills, who was certainly
: interested in her. She had flowers sent
to her, but he did not know who sent
\ them.
The result of the doctor's cross-exam
! Ination seemed to have a i leasant effect
! upon the defendants and their attor
i neys, as the payment of the check was
j some time after the alleged extortion.
Henry A. Brown, paying teller in
j Wells- Fargo's bank, H. C. Helen, a
| clerk in the bank, and John W. Ran
dolph, Nevills' valet, testified as to the
payment, identification and procure
â  ment, respectively, of the $2000 check
j by Mrs. Williams, which the defense
was willing to admit.
William Remington, a painter and
decorator at 115 Russ street, testified
to having done some work for Nevills
at his ranch near Fresno last summer.
He heard a violent dispute one day be

NO CALL FOR
THE RESERVE
California's Young Sea
men Not Yet Needed
for Duty.
Department Announces They
Will Not Be Sent to the
Philippines.
It Is Possible They May Bo Ordered
Into Service at a. Later
Date.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 14.
It was stated at the Navy Depart
ment to-day that while the California
Naval Reserves are anxious to go with
the Philippine expedition it would be
Impossible to send them at present, as
the first expedition was to leave on
Monday and the others would follow in
quick succession. It is possible that the
Naval Reserves may be ordered out at
a later date.
The news that the department was
considering the calling out of the naval
militia of California caused the greatest
enthusiasm in the organization. A dis
patch from Washington yesterday
morning said that the naval reserves of
this State might be ordered to duty at
Manila, and immediately the news
spread like wildfire, for the naval mili
tia had been waiting with a varying
amount of patience for just such tid
ings. Should the call come the response
will be prompt, and within seventy-two
hours the whole force could be as
sembled in this city on board the Ma
rion.
There are seven divisions In the re
serve of this State, six of which are
composed of seamen and one forming
an engineer corps. Twoâ the First and
Secondâ are located in this city; the
Third is at San Diego; the Fourth at
Santa Cruz; the Fifth at Eureka, and
the Sixth at Santa Barbara, The en
gineer division is divided between San
Francisco and San Diego, where the
Pinta is assigned for duty.
When war was declared Captain
Turner, the commanding officer, was in
Alaska on business, but as soon as he
returned he wired to the Navy Depart
ment an offer of the California reserves
for service anywhere and on any ship
the Government chose to assign them.
He asked that the organization be
kept intact as far as possible, but if
the Government did not care to take it
in that way to take it on any terms
agreeable to the department. An offer
was made to allow the Government to
draw on the organization for any num
ber of men and any number of
officers, they to be assigned col
lectively or Individually to any ship in
any part of the world.
As the offer was plain and simple in
its terms there was nothing further to
do or say, and since then word has
been anxiously awaited by men and
officers.
The reserve can put 500 men in serv
ice any time it is called upon, allowing
for those who may be rejected by the
medical examiners. They are all more
or less familiar with ship duty, and
the older members are well up in most
of the drills and duties of the navy.
The officers, too, have been working
hard on the theoretical part of their
duties, and a few weeks at sea will
put them in the way of becoming com
petent to put the theory into practice.
The navÃrf militia is peculiarly adapt
ed to sue* service as will be demand
ed of those who go to Manila, for they
have had practice on sea and on land,
and they have field guns which would
be most efficient in putting down any
disturbing element.
The artillery of the reserve consists
of five one-pounder rapid-fire Hotch
klss guns and three three-inch field
howitzers. They have in addition to
these three gatlingrs, one of which is of
the latest and deadliest pattern. There
is also a sixty-pounder Parrott breech
loading rifle on the forecastle on the
Marion which might be made to do
good service. In addition there are
rifles enough to arm nearly 500 men,
all late model Lee magazine navy
guns, and all the men will need in any
quantity will be clothing.

NEW EPOCH
Clancy Says the Local
government Bill Will
Be Passed.
Prospect That the Measure
Will Lead Up to Irish
Home Rule.
Graphic Pen Picture of the Men Who
Are Engineering Its Passage
in Parliament.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
LONDON, April 30.â For all interest
ed in Irish affairs the center of attrac
tion for the moment has shifted from
Ireland itself to Westminster. Last
Tuesday the discussion of the Unionist
local government bill in its details be
gan in the House of Commons, and it
was rather remarkable to witness the
flight that took place the evening be
fore from Dublin to Holyhead of mem
bers of Parliament, public officials and
others affected in one way ormnother
by the proposals of the Ministry. I
myself traveled over by the mail
steamer, and I never saw such a crowd
on board. The following day the pre
cincts of the House of Commons were
filled with Irish faces and resounded
with such a hum of Irish voices as I do
not recollect to have been heard in the
same place since the stirring times of
twelve years ago, when Mr. Gladstone's
first home rule bill was on the tapis.
Of course the reason for others than
members of Parliament attending in
such unusual numbers is plain enough.
Almost every class of local officials in
Ireland is to be transferred from the
old unrepresentative authorities to new
elected bodies, and they naturaJy de
sire to make their position in the fu
ture secure, especially in the matter of
! pensions. Accordingly "lobbying,
] which, I am told, is not unknown even
in \merica, is just now the order of tne
day and night at Westminster.
This Irish bill is in charge of two
members of the Governmentâ Gerald
Balfour, the Chief Secretary, and Mr.
Atkinson, the Attorney General for
Irelandâ and it certainly furnishes a
great opportunity for both. Mr. Bal
four is, of course, the brother of Arthur
Balfour, the leader of the Tory party
'in the House of Commons. Naturally
! the brothers resemble each other in
! many respects physically and intellect
; ually They are both tall and lanky,
with 'refined and intelligent features;
but the Irish Secretary, though the
younger man, looks the older. His
i clean shaven face is deeply lined and of
i unearthly paleness, and even his gait
and demeanor are more staid than
those of the First Lord of the Treasury.
In fact, he looks decidedly sad, and
when he smiles he does so m such a
sort to quote the words of Shakespeare.
i as if he scorned the spirit that made
I him smile at anything. In speech he is
equally serious. Rapier-like thrusts of
sarcasm and irony are a characteristic
of Arthur Balfour's oratory; that of
Gerald Balfour is entirely free from
them But he is admirably clear in ex
position, and. as might be , expected
very deliberate. He is also, it must be
added, very graciuus-exeept when he
gets out of temper, as he is rather apt
to do For the considerable task
which he has now on hand "must also
h* Â«sa.ld he is very well fitted incleea.
To master the details of the existing
system of local government in Ireland
Sense knowledge is absolutely re-
SSired! The details are positively mul
titudinous, and could not be masterea
by any one except after prolonged
Â°tudv But Gerald Balfour seems to be
a elutton for work, and now probably
knows more of his subject than any
Ir Ãst m ffi b superior knowledge of his
i subject can be accounted for otherwise
! Snby his capacity for work. He
has, in the first place, practically noth
i Ine else to do just now but to master
hi complexity of Irish local govern
ment; and, in the, second place, he h
first-class Irish asistants. Among the
latter the Irish Attorney-Genera
Snks first. Mr. Atkinson looks a. ye
Sman. but he is nearer 60 tha
50 years of age. For a long period b
fore he became Attorney-General h
52 one of the leaders of the Iris
bar and that position he attained b
by sheer merit. Like all Irish lawye
who hive attained to office, he wa
obliged to take to politics for prom
Sand it was fully expected that h
would follow the usual course of sei
in* the first judgeship that fell vacan
But strange to say, he has let n
fewer than four of them go
others He seems to like ParHamen
and, no doubt, as long as he can dra
Â£5000 a yearâ his present salaryâ h
will be more comfortable in the Hou
of Commons than on the bench. H
cannot, however, reckon on retaining
his present post forever, and accord
ingly it is pretty certain that event
ually he will become, like his predeces
sors a Judge. Meanwhile he keeps his
s-at in Parliament, sits by the side of
Mr Balfour every day for seven or
eight hours helping and instructing
him and occasionally, when purely le
gal ' points turn up in debate, takes
nart fn the discussion on the local gov
ernment bill himself. He is supposed,
and no doubt rightly, to be. in a large
degree, the real author of the bill, and
at any' rate he knows all about it.
The* three days' discussion of the bill
has already decided its fate. It was
thought before the discussion began,
that the Irish Unionist minority would
make an effort 'to mutilate the meas
ure by moving destructive amend
ments. But they have already given up
the fight. They have, indeed, moved
three or four amendments; but those
amendments were not only more or
le-=s harmless in themselves, but the
effort made to carry them was almost
avowedly half-hearted. This circum
stance which, at first sight, is rather
inexplicable in view of the fact that
the Irish Unionists in their hearts de
test the bill, is easily accounted for
when two other circumstances are
borne in mind. The landlords, in the
first place, are g-etting a considerable
bribe to induce them to accept the
measure, and then the Government are
making it quite plain that they are de
termined to carry the bill as it stands.
They have, in truth, treated their Irish
supporters with something like con
tempt in this matter. They have
shown once more that they care abso
lutely nothing for their "Irish garri
son" when their English party inter
ests are at stake, and that they ar
ready to abandon them rather tha
imperil their own political position i
Great Britain. The immediate conse
quence is that this Irish bill will hay
not only an easy, but a rapid passag
throuffh Parliament. The remoter con
sequences may be even more import
ant. My own idea â and it is the idea
of many Irish Unionists as well
that one of the inevitable results o
the passage of the measure will be th
establishment of home rule later on.
The House of Commons must wear
curious appearance to strangers who
view it when it is engaged in discuss
ing the details of a bill "in committee."
The Sneaker's chair is vacant on suck
occasions, and the first notion one gets
is that the assembly is without a presi
dent. The second is that it has three
presidents. Of the three persons, how
ever, who sit in a row at the table of
the House, immediately below the
Speaker's chair â one of whom is some
times in ordinary morning dress and
sometimes in evening dress, while the
other two are in wig and gown, like
English Queen's counselâ the first
mentioned is the deputy speaker, or
chairman of committees, who exercises
all the powers of the Speaker when the
House is sitting, not as a House, but
"in committee." Next, everybody on
such occasiqns who speaks at all Beems
to be allowed to speak as often as he
likes, contrary to the usual practice
when the Speaker is in the chair; and
there are always half a dozen mem
bers who exercise this right to an ex
tent that attracts general attention. A
third circumstance, which is particular
ly noticeable during the discussion of
an Irish bill, is that nearly every part
of the House is empty, except that oc
cupied by Irish members. The minis
terial benches are deserted by their oc
cupants who only troop into the House
when the division bell rings and then
vote as they are told by the Govern
ment "whips," and, of course, in en
tire ignorance of the question at issue.
The opposition benches in this case are
deserted almost entirely for the reason
that the Liberals do not bother about
the bill one way or the other. A few
stray Liberals, however, remain, and
they promise to develop into first-class
bores.- Among them is Lord Edmund
Fitzmaurice, brother of the Unionist,
Marquis of Langdorne. He apparently
thinks himself called upon to intervene J
In the discussion on almost every |
amendment. Why he thinks so is not ;
particularly clear. The probability is !
that, being an office-seeker and having 1 \
a somewhat high opinion of his own
powers, he wants to put himself "in ev
idence" as much as possible, in view
of the next distribution of offices in a |
Liberal Government. Another gentle- !
mnn who seems to think that the bill !s i
seriously defective and cannot b^ mend- !
ed, except by his aid, is Mr. Thomas j
Lough, an Irishman, who sits for a [
London constituency. There is at least
some excuse for Mr. Louerh's action in
the fact that he Is Irish and knows I
something of Ireland: but when It !
comes to his loading the notice paper j
with unimportant or useless amend- I
ments to every clause, and when one '
sees him popping up and down every
five minutes to utter words of wisdom
which might easily be dispensed with j
the ordinary man feels his patience i
sorely tried. Nevertheless, the Irish
local government bill if? forcing its way j
ahead, despite the "help" of Lord Ed- j
mund Fitzmauricp and Mr. Lough, an<3 j
when it passes into law a new epoch !
will have been opened in the history of
Ireland.
ELECTION SCANDAL AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
â 
Faculty Committee Appointed to In- i
vestigate Charges of
Fraud.
PALO ALTO. May 14.â Charges of il
legality in the student body election, j
which have been rumored about the Quad â¢
for a week, took definite form yesterday
in a mass meeting of "students called for !
an investigation. Evidence was brought
forward to show that a number who wore i
no longer in colh-yre cast ballots, and
Others who did not come to the polls !
were marked off as having voted. The
meeting resulted in a resolution to ap- I
point a committee of the faculty to look !
into the matter. Dr. Jordan to-night ap- â 
pointed Dr. Branner, Dr. Elliott and Pro- ;
fessors Green, Durand and Whittier as
the committee.
The close contest for treasurer of the 'â 
student body brought about the agitation.
A. B. Morgan won over Fickert and How
ard by a majority of six votes. If the
charges of fraud are proved a second bal- I
lot will be necessary for a choice of can- !
didates. The faculty committee will re- j
port t*he results of its investigation on j
Monday before the assembled students.
Missed by the Barbary Coast.

OCCUPATION
OF BAYAMO
One Story of a Victory by
Cubans Told by
Rowan.
The Lieutenant Gives the De
tails of the Capture of the
Fortified Town.
Says Garcia Wants American Sol
diers as Well as Rifles and.
Ammunition.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, May U.âM dispatch
from Key West says: The story of the
occupation of Bayamo by the victorious
Cubans was brought to Key West by
Lieutenant A. S. Rowan.
"We had expected to find Garcia en
camped somewhere in the fields or
mountains," said the lieutenant. "Im
agine our surprise to learn that his
headquarters were in Bayamo. That I
had always regarded as one of the
strongest Spanish fortified towns. Bay
amo had been in a state of partial
siege for months. Garcia simply wor
ried the Spaniards out on April 24, when
flags were hoisted over every Spanish
fort around Bayamo. General Garcia
was correct in his supposition that the
Spaniards did not intend an armistice,
but simply hoisted a flag of truce to
cover some treacherous military ma
neuver. That maneuver was the evac
uation of Bayamo.
"The Cubans answered the flags of
truce with a heavy artillery and rifle
fire. The Spaniards retreated in two
columns to a little town called Embar
cadero, on the Cauto River. For a dis
tance of 200 yards on the St. Augustine
road the Cubans planted dynamite tor
pedoes that were exploded by an elec
tric wire from the underbrush. From
what I have learned of the affair I be
lieve that three entire companies of
Spaniards and three pieces of artillery
were literally "blown to pieces.
"General Garcia's headquarters are
in one of the finest houses in Bayamo.
He received me most kindly and gave
me all the information that was in his
power. The obtaining of information
was my official errand, so that I am
not at liberty to tell you what It was.
But I believe that I shall be able to
tell the State Department all that it
desires to know about the eastern end
of Cuba.
"Garcia wants American soldiers, as
well as rifles and ammunition. He is
kindly disposed toward Americans per
sonally and his whole army is at the
disposal of the Government in Wash
ington. Cuban soldiers a.re not much
to look at, but they are the best guides
I have ever seen. Their endurance anct
resourcefulness are something wonder
ful. I -don't believe in sending them
Krag-Jorgensen rifles. The Remington
is better adapted to their use than any
other. It is simpler and is more easily
repaired."

Bphlcal edition of Thackeray's works,
olume of which is to be issued each

the edition will be complete.
"Vanity Fair" doesn't need the modern
luxuries of the art of making books to
play ambassador for it with the reading
world. But one accepts the excellence
of this edition, nevertheless, as an addi
tional inducement to read again the fine
old analysis of the incomparable Becky,
mother of literary adventuresses since
her time unnumbered. For It's all Becky
Sharp, as even the author admits in that
letter to the Duke of Devonehire, dated
March 1, 1848, which gives positively the
latest news of the heroine of "Vanity
Fair," that hero-less book.
"Mrs. Crawley now lives in a small but
very pretty little house in Belgravia; and
is conspicuous for her numerous charities
âwhich always get into the newspapersâ
and her unaffected piety. Many of the
most exalted and spotless of her own sex
visit her. and are of opinion that she is a
most injured woman. There is no sort of
truth in the stories regarding Mrs. Craw
ley and the late Lord Steyne. The licen
tious character of that nobleman gave
rise to reports from which, alas! the most
spotless life and reputation can not al
ways defend itself. The present
Sir Rawdon Crawley does not see his
mother; and his undutifulness is a cause
of the deepest grief to that admirable
lady. 'If it were not for higher things,"
she says, 'how could she have borne up
against the world's calumny, a wicked
husi'and's cruelty and falseness, and the
thankles.sness (sharper than a serpent's
tooth) of an adored child? But she has
been preserved, mercifully preserved, to
bear all these griefs, and awaits her re
ward elsewhere.'
"The late Joseph Sedley, Esq., of the
Bengal Civil Service, left her two lakhs
of rupees, on the interest of which the
widow lives, in the practices of piety and
benevolence before mentioned. She has
lost what little good looks she once pos
sessed and wears false hair and teeth
(the latter give her rather a ghastly look
when she smiles) andâ for a pious woman
âis the best crinolined lady in Knights
bridge district.

arrived announces the utter ruin of th
Union Bank of Calcutta, in which all Mrs
Crawiey's money was. Will Fate neve

One can almost hear the chuckle with
which the great humorist must hay
written these lines. His daughter. Mrs
Ritchie, who writes a sort of biographical
preface to each of these new old books
says: "I can remember hearing my fathe
say: 'Vanity Fair is undoubtedly the bes

LOYAL REBEKAH'S ANNIVERSARY.
A large number of the. friends accepted
the invitation of Loyal Rebekah Lodge to
attend the entertainment and dance
given last Monday night in celebration of
the second anniversary of the institution
of the lodge. While the affair was not as
elaborate as some that the lodge has
gfven it was a very pleasing one and was
much' enjoyed by all. The entertainment
committee consisted of Florence D. Line

D. A. N. Copsey, C. W. Smith, H. J.

programme included orchestral music by
the Aeolian Boys' Orchestra under the

the first appearance in public of the
youths and their execution was remark
ably good. Then followed a vocal solo
by Florence Gardner; recitation, Miss

THE HERMANN'S SONS.
The banquet that was given last Mon
day night in Norman's by the Order of
Hermann's Sons, at which there were
present the ladies of the auxiliary lodfees
and invited guests, was one of the most
enjoyable banquets that has been given
by a fraternal organization for a long
time. The harmony, jollity and sociabil
ity from beginning to end was one of the
mV.st convincing proofs that the Germans
know how to enjoy themselves when they
cast business and care aside. The dinner
that was served was an excellent one
and between courses there were toasts
and responses, and then the orchestra
played those airs that are so dear to the
German heart, and to show that while
Germans remember the Fatherland, they
are none the less imbued with American
patriotism, the entire company sang
Star-spangled Banner," "America,"
"Marching Through Georgia" and other
patriotic songs. L. Schardenberg was
toastmaster, and those who composed
the committee of arrangements were:C.
Leidecker, G. Guenther, F. Eggerling, P.
Gfell and W. Beckmann. "The Hermann's
Sons" was responded to By E. Brugge,

served, the author. Art is too elusive for
this, and the mind of a great writer is
something bigger and better than a camera.
j Besides, when one has once met disillusion
and realized the unheroic smallness of his
hero, he is apt to prefer to take his esti
mate of a man from his books rather
than from his biographer. And, after all,
t his work, whatever it may be, must be
i the truest expression of a man of genius.
It is the measure of his human activity,
i and it can't be great unless he has put
! himself into it; for nothing that is sujÂ»er
: flcial or Insincere has power to survive.
However, for those who are Interested
in the man, as well as the artist, there's
an admirably done drawing of the
benevolent, shrewd face and large, easy
pose of one of the greatest of England's
story tellers. And Mrs. Ritchie's notes
are as tasteful and unobtrusive a biog
raphy as one could wish, interspersed as
they are with frequent extracts of her
father's very human, very merry letters
and sketches.
I One can imagine how delightful It must ;
have been for Thackeray's mother to re
ceive these illustrated letters of his. But
one feels justified, nevertheless, in pro
testing- against the continuance of the i
Thackeray illustrations to Thackeray.
Thackeray can't do Thackeray justice.
Because the author was a genius, it
doesn't follow that the artist was one
too â or two In one, whichever you
please. When you were a child, do you
remember how quickly you used to turn
over the pages, fearing that your eye
i might light upon one of these sketches?
Sketches, that's all they are. These i
absurd hints of ideas, drawn when Cari- |
cature was king, give one the impression
of immaturity, incompleteness, as though
if he had had the power, Thackeray
would have finished, improved them.
It's impossible to take these things seri
ously. The buffoon sameness of expres
sion in the faces â like the illustrations In
a German comic paper, where all are j
j monstrositiesâ wrecks one's mental pic
tures of these famous people that the
great man created for the small artist to
belittle, apparently. I wonder if Thack
eray had taken to bookbinding, and ba.d ',
done that part of book producing as
faultily as the literary portion is ever
refreshing and admirable and unegualed,
would publishers have found that a rea
son for perpetuating his binding?
O, for a picture of Becky! Becky, whose
small, sharp, bright, clever face differs,
according to Thackeray the illustrator,
from the rest only in the well-known
Becky smirk. Here's a fioj.il for the iii'"!
ern illustrator of books, whose profession
tables were removed and there was danc
ing until a late hour.

THE NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
This afternoon the members of Minerva
Parlor No. 2 and those of La Estrella
Parlor No. 89 will hold joint memorial
service in Sierra Hall for the dead of the
order during the year preceding May 1.
On the altar there will be laid a wreath
of white roses, each rose representing one
of the members called from the Golden
State to the golden shore. Special service
will also be held in remembrance of the
men who lost their lives on the Maine.
Last Wednesday night the members of
Sans Souci Parlor No. 96 gave an enter
tainment and dance in Devisadero Hall,
which was one of the most enjoyable af
fairs of the kind that has thus far been
given by this very sociable parlor. The
hall was crowded, yet all were good na
tured and enjoyed the programme that
had been prepared for their entertainment
by the committee, consisting of Miss
Dora Eisner, Mrs. Grundell, Miss Munson,
Mrs. M. Kallock, Miss Klein, Miss Dag
enais, Mrs. Dobbin, Mrs. Annie Mocker,
Mrs. Gwlnn and Mrs. Hanamerschmidt.
This included an address of welcome by
the president, Mrs. Mocker; piano solo,
Mr. Caro; recitation, C. H. Johnston;
vocal duet. Mrs. Williams and Miss Dag
enais; fanny dance, Mattie Luyce; recita
tion. Miss Elsie Duncan; and a vocal solo
by Mrs. Burgess. The hall, which was
decorated with large and small American
flags and the lights shaded with red, pre
sented a pretty appearance, and the
daughters, to prove their fealty to the
flag, had Mrs. Williams lead in the "Star
spangled Banner," and they, together
with the entire audience, joined in the
chorus. After the programme there came
a dance, but as the hall was not large
enough for all who wanted to take part,
it became necessary to secure an adjoin
ing hall and have dantjjng in each. The
large attendance proves the popularity of
Bans Souci, although "Little Willie," the
colored mascot of the parlor, who was
there, said: "De big crowd's heah 'ka.se
dey knew I was goln' to be heah."
Piedmont Parlor No. 87 will give a grand
patriotic social in Chapman's Hall, Oak
land, on the evening of the 18th in aid
of its flag fund. This parlor has chosen

: -| â v U MAURIER'S little talk on
"Social Pictorial Satire" is light,
agreeable reading for the world at
large, but for the student of pen
and ink work it must br of deeper
interest. The delineator of those
long-limbed, beautiful-shouldered. Trilby
chinned English women, all of whom.lt is
easy to see by their striking family re
semblance, are sisters, chats pleasantly
about his predecessors and co-workers on
"Punch." He knew them Intimately and
loved them well, even to the point of be
ing able to detect wit in the John Bull
stolidity of some of their work. His men
tion of his own work is most pleasing.
"Of all my little piebald puppets, the
one I value the most is my pretty woman.
! I am as fond of her as Leech was of his,
of whom, by the way, she is the great
granddaughter! This is not artistic van
ity; it Is pure paternal affection, and by
I no means prevents me from seeing her
j faults; It only prevents me from seeing
j them as clearly as you do! â¢ â¢ â¢ " He
is "dissatisfied with the means at my
| command to do the living beauty justice â
! a little bit of paper, a steel pen and a
j bottle of ink, and, aJas! fingers and an
eye less skilled than they would have
been if I had gone straight to a school of
art instead of a laboratory of chemistry!"
Dv Maurier believes in the future of the
social pictorial artist. "It is a kind of
hybrid profession still in its Infancy
â¢ â¢ â¢ hardly recognized as a profession
|at all â¢ â¢ â¦ something half way be
tween literature and art. â¢ â¢ â¢ The
quality of black and white illustrations of
modern life is immeasurably higher than
it was thirty or forty years ago. The
number of youths who can draw beauti
fully is quite appalling. All we want for
jmy little dream to be realized is that
! among these precocious wielders of the
j pencil there should arise, here a Dickens,
I there a Thackeray, there a George Eliot
|or an Anthony Trollope. who, finding
quite early in life that he can draw as
easily as other men can spell, that he
can express himself, and all that he
hears and sees and feels, more easily,
more completely. In that way than in any
other, will devote himself heart and soul
to that form of expression â as I and
others have tried to doâ but with the ad
vantages of nature, circumstances and
education that have been denied to us!"

SIMON DALE
SIMON DALEâ By Antnony Hope. New
York: Frederick A. Stokes Company.
San Francisco: "William Doxey.
"Je viens, tv viens, il vient." An
' unpromising text, surely, for whlmsi
; cal romance; when the poet asked
I where was Fancy bred he never sug
i gested that her birthplace be found in
the regions of prosaic conjugations.
I But Mr. Anthony Hope, our modern,
; intellectual Lord of Misrule, once more
comes to overturn old-fashioned no
tions; he goes to dry grammar for his
fun, and starting with the innocent lit
tle lesson quoted above he leads us on
I a merry, madcap, riotous dance, among
Parlor, and Misses L. Meyer and F. yon
Btaden, alternates. Among the visit
ors were; Miss Mac B. Wilkins,
P. G. P.; Mrs: Georgie C. Ryan,
G. S., and Mrs. Genevieve Baker.
D. D. G. P. Upon the close of business
the members, who were nearly all pres
ent, devoted their time and talent to the
celebration of the anniversary. The guest
â >f honor at that assemblage was Mrs.
P. Day, mother of Miss Rose Day, the
grand marshal. The hall was tastefully
decorated with flags, hunting and flow
ers. Under the direction of Mrs. B. De
nahay, the president, there were present
ed the following numbers: Address by
Mrs. Baker, I>. D., who instituted the
parlor, and stated that since it had al
ways been successful and that the mem
bership had always been harmonious and
she expressed the hope that in the fu
ture It will continue as it has ';, the past.
She closed with an allusion to Old Glory
and the duty of the Native Daughters in
supporting the honor of that flag.
Mrs. Ryan and Miss Wilkins also had
a few words to say. This was followed
by a recitation by Miss Johanna Meyer,
the recording secretary, of an original
poem that carried the audience by storm;
a vocal soli., Miss I). Mencarini; zither
.siilo. Miss L. Fahrenkrug, and a farce,
"From Down East," in which Mrs. C.
Day, Miss J. St. Davis, Mrs. B. Denahay,
Miss J. I 'rucker and Miss M. Tietjen took
part, Mrs. Day and Miss Tietjen assum
ing maie characters, the last named be
ing one of the most perfect make-ups that
ever wore clothing that did not belong
to her sex. The celebration was, in the
language of one of the members, "a howl-
Ing success," and every one enjoyed her
self. There was served up a collation
and, then, when the American flag was
being removed from the altar, the audi
ence sang the "Star Spangled Banner"
with a will.
Fremont Parlor has so far advanced its
membership as to allow it two delegates
to the Grand Parlor this time. This par

ball for the 4th of June.
Golden State Parlor Is arranging for an
entertainment and dance to be given in
the near future in aid of the Red Cross
Society.
THE NATIVE SONS.
National Parlor's entertainment and
dance, given in Native Sons' Hall last
Wednesday night, was well attended and
it proved a delightful affair. The hall
was elaborately decorated with the na
tional colors in honor of the members'
patriotism. The programme included an
address of welcome by G. W. Barr, the
president; vocal selections by the Press
Club quartet, Henry Eichart and Miss
Etta Welsh; "The Confessional," a read-
Ing, Miss Pearl Ladd; negro lullaby, Miss
Dorathy Daunt; whistling solo, by that
enchanting artist, Miss Cordie Wetjen;
"Me and Mabel Brooks," an original song
by Lew Hufschmidt, and cornet duet by
Miss Alice Mitchell and Miss Pearl Noble.
The performers all came in for well-de
served applause. .The committee of ar
rangements was Past Presidents W. E.
McCreery, W. M. Brown, D. E. Murden,
Vice-Presidents F. P. Wehe and A. R.
Vaughn, Marshal D. F. Nunan and J. G.
Schmidt and G. W. Meyer. Mr. Vaughn
was the floor manager. The affair was
up to the high standard of the functions
or this parlor and very much enjoyed.
Since the publication in this depart
ment of the list of parlors assigned to
visiting officers of the Native Sons, the
parlors of San Mateo County, which had
been assigned to Grand Orator Frank L.
Coombs, have been assigned to Grand
Trustee L. F. Byington. Mount Tamapais,
Sea Point and Nicaslo Parlors have been
taken from the district of Grand Trustee
Morgan and assigned to Grand Orator
Coombs' district.
California Parlor has decided that all
its members doing duty under the flag of
the United States during the war with
Spain shall be exempt from all dues and
assessments which may occur during
such service.
President Conley will shortly name all
standing committees, probably during the
coming week.
COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST.
The Supreme Grand Circle of the Com
panions of the Forest, A. O. F., will meet
in this city to-morrow and will remain
crowned heads and princes, and fair
celebrities of blemished reputation, to
a tune which suggests old Alexandra
Dumas.
Simon Dale himself, the demure
young grammarian who starts the fid
dle strings, might best be described as
a male "ingenu" whose innocence is
sorely tested amid the lures of Charles
the Second's notorious court. But in
this instance innocence and simplicity
by no means go hand in hand. # "Simple
Simon" proves to be the longest-headed
Joseph that ever resisted temptation,
won royal favor, and retired gracefully
into safe seclusion. B"ut there is an
uncanny reason for Mr. Dale's sing
ular fortune; the witches favored him,
and a village crone, well known to be
in league with the devil, hailed his
birth with the prophecy that he should
"love where the King loved, know what
the King hid, and drink of the King's
cup."
To accomplish this prophecy Simon
must inevitably go to court; mean
while his youth is enlivened by two
quiet, country love affairs, which have
more bearing on the old crone's words
than at first appears. Barbara Quin.
ton, only child of the lord of the manor,
grows up with Dale, and despite some
disparity of station the two are un
conscious sweethearts from childhood.
But Just before Barbara's departure
for court as maid of honor to the Du
chess of York, a bewitching and un
scrupulous little person appears mys
teriously on the scene, laying siege in
bare-faced fashion to Simon's unsophis
ticated heart. Nothing is known of
the bewitching person save that she
halls from London and calls herself
Cydaria; but Barbara is convinced
that what remains unknown is by no
means creditable. Confirmed in this
view of the case by the sight of an ex
change of kisses in her own park, she
quits for London in high dudgeon, and
after a week more of philandering Cy
daria also goes, leaving country Simon
to dream of her sweetness.
Four years later Simon Dale la called
to court, having-, through some un
known agency, received a commission
in His Majesty's Life Guards. This is
the beginning of a prophecy. For, after
fighting a duel to defend his honor,
Simon discovers that his honor was
sorely in need of defense; his commis
sion had been procured by Mistress
Eleanor Gwynn, and that lady was no
other than his tenderly remembered
Cydaria. Straightway he throws up
the commission, receiving the natural
reward of virtue in the form of service
with the Duke of Monmouth; but the
people's Nelly is still dear to him and
we have one quaintly pretty scene in
which he offers the astounded King's
mistress honorable marriage and a
country life.
The guilt or innocence of Captain Drey
fus bids fair to become as insoluble a
mystery as the identity of the "Man in
the Iron Mask," and interest in the ques
tion deepens more and more as the facts
and circumstances, so graphically set
forth in the May Atlantic by John T.
Morse Jr., in his review of the Dreyfus
and Zola trials, are read and studied.
Paul Lawrence Dunbar and James
Whitcomb Riley are writing a negro
comic opera together; the cast, it is said,
to be composed entirely of colored people.
Who is to write the music has not yet
been divulged. The idea is certainly strik

ought to succeed.

FORESTERS OF AMERICA.
At tha meeting of Court Sutro Heights,
LUMMIS ANNOUNCES
THE AWAKENING OF MEXICO
IT'S the delightful, unaffected infor-
m ality of his style that is the chief
ingredient toward the success of
Lummis' "Mexico." It's an ideal
book of its kind; description
made fascinating; an account of
travels rendered fresh and interest
ing, and statistics actually made agreea
ble. Another ingredient, though, must be
the author's unbounded sympathy with
his subjectâ the Mexican has all our vir
tues and none of our vices, according to
Lummisâ and his impatience of "those
who have learned history by not studying
it."
"A course of travel." says Lummia, in
beginning his book, "should be compul
sory for all able-bodied adult citizens,
and no traveler should print anything
about a country whose language he shall
not speak."
As Lummis' friend, who would enforce
such laws, has not yet been declared
Czar, the next best thing one can do, so
far as Mexico is concerned, is to read this
"Awakening of a Nation."
The author will surprise you occasion
ally by the use of such expressions as
"No scrub could walk like this," and
"Just such legs do not grow upon the In
dian." which last gives one the impres
sion of legs as a parasite and not a legiti
mate part of the human anatomy. But
he'll surprise you infinitely more by the
amount of knowledge he possesses, and
so well knows how to make Interesting, of
the "American Cinderella." He'll delight
you with his vigorous, unhackneyed style,
with his original way of looking at things,
with the excellence of his arrangement of
facts and figures, with the tasteful blend
ing of important with trivial things, with
held lost Thursday night, on motion of J.
W. Gleadell the court resolved to main
tain in good standing any member of the
court who, being in good standing, en
lists in the service of the United States
during the war with Spain. This court has
added to its committee to make more ef
fective the grand entertainment and ball
to be given in Odd Fellows' Hall on the
night of the 25th inst. The entertainment
will be under the supervision of the well
known actor, Leo Cooper, and the pro
gramme will be one of the moat interest
ing ever presented by a court of Forest
ers.
The court Initiated one candidate and
received the applications of six candi
dates presented by Chief Ranger "W ol
ters. Court Defiance visited the court in
a body.
Court Defiance last Thursday night re
ceived information that two of its mem
bers, George Rosenberg and Herman
Cook, had enlisted in the California Vol
unteers. It was resolved to keep these
members and any others who may enlist
for the war with Spain in good standing.
There was a good attendance in Sher
man. Clay & Co.'s Hall last Tuesday to
enjoy the exquisite concert that was given
under the auspices of Junior Court Pride
of California No. 1 to its friends. From
an artistic point the concert was all that
could be desired.
The current number of the American
Forester is as fine a specimen of a fra
ternnl periodical as has ever been pub
lished. It is illustrated with many half
tone pictures of prominent Foresters,
and the California section, which is under
the direction of Jacob Label of Court Au
rora, one of the most energetic members
of the order, is a full record of the courts
and circles.
COMPANIONS OF THE F. OF A.
Last Monday night Grand Chief Com
panion Mrs. Emma Harrington paid an
official visit to Loyal C .rcle in Oakland.
She was accompanied by a number of the
grand officers and in addition to the vis
itors from across the bay there were a
large number from this side and the
meeting was one of the most enthusiastic
that have been hold for some time. The
hall was very tastefully decorated and the
welcome of the members to the visitors
was most cordial. After an exemplifica
tion of the work given in excellent style
the grand chief companion was presented
by Deputy Licht on behalf of the circle
with a beautiful vase and a profusion of
the finest flowers obtainable In Oakland.
The business of the evening was followed
by a banquet. The members of Oakland
Circle attended in a body.
Next Tuesday night there will be an
official visit to Pride of the Forest Circle
in South San Francisco, and on Wednes
day there will be an official visit to Robin
Hood Circle, which will be the last official
visitation prior to the meeting of the
Grand Circle.
The pinnic of the convent. on of 189$ will
be held at Plittsville Park on the other
side of the bay to-day. Arrangements
have been made for a good outing.
THE NATIONAL UNION.
Tosemite Council at its last held meet
ing initiated two candidates and to-mor
row will initiate two more. This, the
oldest council in the State, has become
quite energetic of late. It will keep in
good standing any of its members who
may enlist for the war.
Owing to hoarseness President Arter
was unable to preside at the meeting of
Golden Gate Council last Tuesday night.
Ex-President James E. Field did the
honors. Two applications were read and
one candidate was initiated. The council
decided to lay aside a stated sum every
month to be known as a reserve fund.
Under good and welfare there were ad
dresses by Deputy Bunting, ex-President
Field, ex-President Hastings of Califor
nia Council and W. A. 4. Nicholson. The
council's quartet rendered some fine vocal
selections.
The anniversary entertainment and ball
to be given in Odd Fellows' Hall next
Thursday night will be according to the
arranged programme a very grand affair.
THE AMERICAN GUILD.
At the meeting of San Francisco Chap
ter last Wednesday evening there was
the frank expression of his enthusiastic
admiration for President Diazâ an enthu
siasm, a certain integrity of manner in
his own writing bids you shareâ and
above all by the addition he makes to
your knowledge of our neighbor and the
charming- way in which he does it.
There Is no limit to the good Lummls \
sees in Mexico. There is no hanging
there, he tells us; no capital punishment ;
outside of the army, and that deemed
necessary for the suppression of brigand- '
age. The metric system is in active use, j
and the Mexicans are "tolerantly sorry j
for such nations as still cling to the su
perstition of a cruder scheme. Hospital- j
ity is Latin in fact as well as In name."
In all the modern scheme of things Mex
ico is in the front. She may build the
Nicaragua canal, if we defer that enter- i
prise too long. She pays her school- \
ma'ams more than she does the male
educator. She boasts of the glory of the
first book printed in America. She has
model schools and prisons and factories,
all set in a framework of exquisite archi
tectural beauty. She has even solved the
silver question. Lummls is characteris
tically happy in his chapter na ' Cheap
Money."
"Here at last, for the traveler, at least,"
he says, "is the dreamland, the kingdom
of Something for Nothing. Bargains in
dollars! Coin selling out at half cost:
Help yourself to what you want and the
cashier will give you your money back
and a few dollars to boot. You drop into
the estanquillo on the corner and buy
twenty-five honorable cigars for 75 cents.
The tobacconist rings your $5 gold piece
on the counter and without emotion he
hands you nine silver dollars and some
the initiation of a candidate. The elec
tion of a treasurer, vice the one occupj
ing the position, forced to resign on ac
count of inability to attend to the duties
of the office by reason of other engage
ments, was laid over for two weeks.
Last Tuesday evening W atsonville
Chapter gave a grand entertainment at
which there was a large attendance and
a fine programme of song, music and
games was presented. Supreme Deputy
Governor R. W. McGarvie delivered an
address on fraternal orders and the guild
in particular, which the local paper de
clares was "a clear, concise, convincing
address." After the programme there
was a banquet.
SOCIAL COUNCIL. O. C. F.
Mrs. Baecus, Mrs. Garbarino, Mrs.
Adams, Miss Hilton. Miss McDonald and
Miss Goodell, the committee on entertain
ment of Social Council, on last Thursday
evening presented an enjoyable pro
gramme to a large number of members of
the order and strangers who were present
by invitation. The programme included
vocalization by Mr. Mathias, Miss Mc-
Cormick, Miss Rosvear, Mr. Farnen and
Mr. Fisher and recitations by the Misses
Ella, Gertrude and Genevieve Hussey and
Miss Frances Buckland. Supreme Trustee
Gibson delivered a short address on the
SOME WHIST "WHYS."
WHY don't all whist clubs have a
whist qualification clause?
Why talk of calling for trumps be
fore you know the leads?
Why don't you let your partner do
the finessing In his own suit?
Why worry over tricks that are
gone? Did you ever get one back?
Why do so many others mix up the laws of
whist with whist rules?
Why do you sit down to play with a partner
who doesn't know the leads?
Why do you ever touch your adversaries'
cards without asking the privilege?
Why le it that beginners always ask the
question, "Did you see my call"?
Why do some whist players expect the ace of
trumps to be good for two tricks?
Why do you ever under any circumstances
call the original lead a "forced lead"?
Why do you turn down the trump slip with
out showing it to both your adversaries?
Why don't you always "show number" of
cards you hold In your partner's suit?
Why do you ever lead a suit that one ad
versary can ruff and the other get in a dis
card ?
Why Is it that the almighty dollar is such a
factor with certain "whist enthusiasts" I
Why do some whist players pass a doubtful
trick just because they hold four trumps?
Why do you touch your cards to put them
back In the tray before you agree on the
score ?
Why don't you leave the trump slip turned
face up until you take up the trump card?
Why don't the American Whist League for
mulate a system of whist play as a standard
of authority for the guidance of its whist chil
dren?
Why Is it so few whist players know that
all questions but one asked at a whist table
should be addressed to and answered by the
partner only?
Why do y- do such a thing as to discard to
show your strong or best protected suit, when
you are fourth player on an adverse winning
trump lead?
Why do you neglect to remind your partner
that it is his privilege and right to enforce a
penalty that Is due, and you can also tell
him what the penalty is? â
Why ever "call through an honor without
you are strong enough to lead from your best
p.ain suit to do so, and have the lead give
double information? . . ..
Why is it that so many players overlook the
great" advantage of showing number on part
ner's original lead? . , .
Why is it that the man who doesn t know the
leads is usually the one who poses as the whist
"*hy is the queen marked In the third hand
when the leader opens with ten from the king:
Jack ten combination and holds the trtok?
Why don't you always tM your partner how
small change. There are new Americana
and Americans. Some escape before he
shall discover his mistake. Others tarry
to set him right. But the Spanish Ameri
can is wonderfully poised. I never knew
him to laugh In the face even
of a tourist. â¢ â¢ â¢ It is like
the miracle of the loaves and fishes
brought down to date and American,
ideals. The philosopher's stone were mere
mud to this. To make a salary simply by
spending moneyâ that is precisely what
we are looking for. â¢ â¢ â¢ All one has to
do is to bring plenty of gold and swap
one dollar for two aa long as one can,
stand prosperity."
And the author believes that a further
degradation of silver in Mexico would
only again shrink importation and in
crease manufactures.
The chapter on Spanish words, called
"Borrowed from the Enemy," is good;
and that on "The Ladder," which de
scribes the} rise of Diaz, "the greatest
figure unquestionably the most romantic
in the world's politics this half century,
Is an excellent piece of work, full of
spirit, of keen, appreciative analysis, and
of rare descriptive powers to make vivid
battle scenes, skirmishes and the details
Â°The r 'book is most beautifully illus
trated. There's a profuseness of illus
tration which illumines every- third page,
and the taste and discrimination shown
in the selection would make one aware
without the note that the author had
had something to do with this part of his

effective these drawings from photo

TOUNG MEN'S INSTITUTE.
It is expected that on the Ist of June
the headquarters of the Young Men's In

most Identical with ; the same in Hoy ! * tto* 'PANTOMINE IS PRINCE
IT is a remarkable coincidence that
at one time there should be in
San Francisco three of the great
est exponents of the art of panto
mime.
Not pantomime in the sense of buf
foonery, of clownishness, of the Punch
and Judy kind, but the old classic
mode iff expression by gesture, the
deathless art of dumb acting, which is
at once the beginning and the end, the
lowest and highest form of dramatic
art.
Just when things are at their low
est ebb dramatically comes this trio of
artists to our rescue. To be sure,
Pilar-Morin, that bewitching combina
tion of grace and beauty, of comedy
and tragedy, will be with us only a
couple of weeks more. But her two
mighty rivals are, in a way, the prod
uct of our own theatrical soil, and
they'll continue, probably, to uplift
the stage and educate the people by
the exposition of their wonderful art,
just so long as the box-office shall
flourish and theater-goers be grateful
and appreciative.
It is true that Pilar-Morin has nat
ural advantages which make competi
tion with her hopeless. In the first
place, she is a woman. Better than
that, she is a Frenchwoman â thatmost
feminine, most irresistible of created
things. Neither of her great rivals is
female nor French â a bitter handicap.
Neither of them is beautiful, as is this
lovely brunette. Neither of them pos
sesses the fascinating combination of
traits which makes this exponent of
grief or joy equally delightful. Both
of them are a bit Inexperienced. Both
of them tread the boards with that
diffident uncertainty that marks the
amateur. Both of them seem more to
fear Thespia than to worship her. Yet
both of them are greeted by the plaud
its of the enraptured multitude.
How do you account for it?
A very simple matter. It's art â pure
art, that should be spelled in this in
stance, at least, with a capital A as
large as the type used to head war
extras.
When Tom-Sharkey appears upon
the stage at the California, at the close
of the second act of "The Ensign," the
whole house bursts into a roar of
laughter. What has he done? Noth
ing, apparently, but to flounder down
from the middle entrance In his sailor
togs and stand like a pugilistic Co
lossus of Rhodes, a long knife In his
hand, his face grim and paleâ as
though he could feel fear â stage fear,
at that!
Now, this is art. The gaining of ef
feet â effect so strong, so immediate by |
such simple means requires a high de- ;
gree of ability. It is the kind of art so
envied by those who do not possess it,
CAat works with the fewest possible j
tools. In whatever trade or profession |
it shows itself, it denotes genius. Re- ;
member what a celebrated French
painter said of Charles Keene, Punch's
great pictorial satirist.
"He is a great man, your Charles
Keene; he takes a pen and ink and a
bit of paper, and wiz half a dozen
strokes he know 'ow to frame a gust of
wind."
Now, that's just the way with Tom-
Bharkey. With half a dozen strides
he know 'ow to raise a perfect vhii I
wind of laughter. And a joyous, open
mouthed laughter that is truly Hom
eric.
That stern-set Mouth of his (if a pug
ilist's mouth doesn't deserve a capital,
what does?) trembles at length and
pours forth a hastily uttered, profane
sentence, ending with 'But we can flght
like hell."
You should see the effect of those !
half-dozen words. Keene's strokes are !
nowhere. The California is con- i
vulsed. It is a giggling harp now to be j
played upon by this master of comedy. |
The great pantomimist pretends to
be unconscious of his marvelous power.
He stands statue-like in all the un
couth awkwardness of a position so I
strained, so dead still, so impossible j
that only an artist could accomplish it. |
There's genius in those stiff, wide-apart j
legs, the sides of an artistic right-angle j
triangle. There's genius in that fixed !
eye, which seems to watch the curtain
with a hypnotic glare that finally pulls !
it down. There's genius in that noble I
right hand that clutches the long knife j
as though support and safety lay alone
in that.
The audience roars. It is helpless;
at the mercy of the great comedian.

j It remembers another tableau; that at
! the Baldwin, where Pilar-Morin by the
shuddering strength of her agonized
posture, by the exquisitely sympathetic
| horror in her beautiful, expressive face
brings home to the watcher the tragedy
jof the death of the Empress. If you
j looked but at Pilar-Morin, at her alone,
! you'd understand. She is the mirror
| of emotions, In which is focused all the
! rays of feeling. All that passes, all
I that takes place is reflected in that
' lovely, changing face, in that graceful,
i natural pose, in those eyes so like dark,
deep mountain lakes.
The people at the California remem
! ber this, and then they look at Tom
' Sharkey. And they howl!
And the curtain falls!
It is time. There are talents so great
' that human nature cannot bear the
: full exercise of them. The audience
can endure no more.
It Is whispered that the other great
; pantomimistâ he who crowds Moros
i co's with admirers, gallery upon gal
! lery of them, enough to fill all the
| other theaters in town combined â crlt
j iticizes his great rival who serves now
in Thespia's Temple for descending to
I speech. James-Jeffries, it is claimed,
\ disapproves of the use of words. Ac
! cording to his finer interpretation of
Dramatic Art, articulate speech is the
< resort of incapacity.
Now, it must be admitted that
i James-Jeffries makes his meaning per
j fectly clear. And not a word does he
! utter. Just once he smilesâ when his
i lesser brother shows evidence of his
own skill in pantomime. It is not a
Pllar-Molin smile exactly, which is
1 what the poets imagined when they
i used the old simile of the sun breaking
\ through clouds. It cannot candidly
ibe said that Morosco's pantomimist
| has a beautiful smile. It's too nearly
allir>d to that lifting of the snarling
upper lip one sees and admires â from
a safe distance â in the four-footed
I pugilists. No one can conscientiously
accuse James-Jeffries of relying upon
his physical charms for the great suc
i cess which is so deservedly his.
The methods of this great artist are
almost the reverse of those his rival
uses. His costume is the height of
simplicity. Clothed in black tights,
with the American flag for trunks, he
sits between rounds sheepishly eying
the audience, carelessly scratching his
nose with an unsatisfactory, wadded
finger of his swollen glove, his arms
like the legs of a piano, his black hair
simply, chastely "slicked down" over
his forehead. 'When time is called he
skips toward his unhappy partner in
this dumb duet in action. He dances
about him. He slides. He ducks. He
smashes. He clutches at his oppo
nent, and then inconsistently throws
him off, scornfully, easily, only to
make for him again savagely. And
da capo, da capo, until the thrilling
athletic drama is done.
The shouts, the shrieks, the pathetic
appeals for more that come from the
audience at the close of ten minutes
of this classic pantomime, are the
tributes the world pays to the favorite
ut the gods; he who, all untrained, all

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 15, 1898.
Miriam Michelson - Dramatic Editor
unaccustomed to the glory of the foot
lights, leaps, by sheer strength of his
genius over the obstacles lesser artists
have to overcome slowly and painfully.
The management at Morosco's has
omitted to give to the public the short
explanation with which Pllar-Morin
usually prefaces her programmes. This
Is only another proof of the genius of
James-Jeffries, whose work needs not
the lamp of written words any more
than that of spoken ones. It's story is
one act, of course, of the great trag
edy, the struggle for pugilistic exist
ence. In Tom-Sharkey's opinion, its
title should be "The Survival of the
Unflttest."
Experienced dramatic critics will
note an odd coincidence. That great
actor, James J. Corbett, asserted and
still maintains that Robert Fitzsim
mons won his laurels by starring in
the self-same play. And Dv Maurier
holds that one's fellow-craftsman is
one of the two critics whose verdict
means life or death to the artist. He
also intimates that the public is likely
to come 'round to the craftsman's
point of view in time.
But this is a question merely of the
ethics of criticism. The gTeat revival
in pantomimic art which has given bo
many great men to the American stage
may be relied upon to keep the drama
pure and unspotted, devoted ever to
lofty ideals.
But one thing is to be fearedâ and
that, happily, is improbable. Should the
Champion of the World (in New York)
challenge the Champion of the World
(in Denver) and the Champion of the
World (at present in Pennsylvania)
and the Champion of the World (now
"fighting like hell" at the California)
and the Champion of the World (the
idol of Morosco's) to engage in pugilis
tic pantomime for the World's Cham
pionship, the elimination of four of
these five great actors must follow.
In that event what, O what, would
become at the American stage?
BaldWirv
There will be a triple bill at the Bald
win next week, consisting of "In Old
Japan," "A Dresden Shepherdess" and
a Scheel symphony concert. In one
evening you will have the pleasure of
seeing Pilar-Morin in both tragedy and
comedy.
The story of "The Dresden Shepherd
ess" is a tale of the love of the Fairy
Queen for Pierrot. Pilar-Morin is
Pierrot. Pierrot is indifferent, but.
taught by Cupid, learns to love not Ti
tania but Sylvia, the shepherdess, who,
in turn loves â not Pierrot â but Colin,
the shepherd. Pierrot cajoles the Fairy
Queen with an affectation of love to
give him her scepter, and then he base
ly drives her forth. Then Sylvia steals
the scepter from him, and he, too, 1b
driven back to his home "in the moon,
whence little Pierrots should never
stray."
The comedy is written by Vance
Thompson, music by Aime Lachaume.
A ballet of Dresden shepherdesses is on

The representation of the "Passion
Play" at the Baldwin continues all next
i week, every afternoon, except Satur
day. On Monday, May 23. it will be
j produced in the evening, as there are
many who are unable to attend the
matinees.
Galifomia.
The event of next week at the Cali
j fornia Is the debut of two young Cali
i fomla girls. Miss Olive Snyder of
Berkeley and Miss Helen Young, who
:Is a San Franciscan. The stage names
' they have chosen are Charlotte Beck
â  with and Helen Dumars. The latter
will appear as Fuchsia Leach, the
American girl, in "Moths." Phosa Mc-
Allister plays her old role of Lady
I Dolly Vanderdecker and Fanny Gil
i lette is Vera, Iver daughter.
Columbia.
To-morrow begins Robert Mantell's
last week at the Columbia. He will
play a double role â the conspirator
Ferrand and Victor Ambrose, the hero
of "The Face in the Moonlight."
The Hopkins Trand-nceanic Vaude
ville Company follows Mantell, begin
ning May 23.
TiVoli.
The Iroquols Club will attend the
Tivoli to-night in a body to see "Ship
Ahoy," which will run all next week.
A week from to-morrow "The Poster,"
a comic opera composed by San Fran
ciscans, will be produced. L. G. Car
penter, dramatic critic of the Post, and
John P. Wilson are responsible for the
libretto. The music is by Chester S.
Packard.
The theme is Poster Art, and there's
a love story, boundless opportunity for
clever, novel costuming, ballets and
grotesque ilauces and a possibility that
"The Poster" may make a hit. At any
rate, San Francisco is interested in the
event, and the Tivoli managers believe
that but one hearing will be necessary
to set the whole town whistling "It's
All in the Poli.t of View" and "The Bee
and the Lightning Bug." The dresses
are made fro. well known poster de
signs by famous artists, the odd poster
effect being carried out with striking
fidelity. All the costumes will be new,
and the wigs are being manufactured
expressly for this big Tivoli production.
Morosco's.
Frank Llndon, who has been produc
ing his play at Morosco's to large audi
ences, will be seen during the coming
week in a character comedy role in
"The Corner Grocery." the play that

cipal characters of the cast are Daddy

â  boy Jamesey, whose mischievous
pranks are a notable feature of the
comedy element, played by Maud Edna
Hall. W. R. Dailey, a well known com
edian, will also have a good part in that
of Budweiser, a German grocer, whose
plotting for the heroine's fortune brings
disaster and sadness to the Nolan
household, for there is a pathetic side
to the plot in spite of the fact that it
is uproariously funny. Being a com
edy drama, it admits of the introduc
tion of several specialties, which will
be given by Comedian Stewart and
other members of the company. Lin
don is said to be very clever in this par
ticular play, and will have a strong
support for the last week of his engage
ment at the Grand.
Orpheum.
The Orpheum has engaged Edouard
Remenyi, the great violinist, who will
make his first appearance at this house
to-morrow evening. Everybody knows
Remenyi. Everybody has heard him
play and that is only an additional rea
son for wanting to hear him again and
again. To be able to hear so famous
an artist for the popular prices pre
vailing at the Orpheum is a test of the
great success of vaudeville in the
West. Other new features of the bill
are the Manhattan comedy four, who
rank among the very best quartets
| playing the vaudeville stage. Jerome
& Bell, comedy sketch artists, have a
clever skit. The holdovers include Isa
â  belle Urquhart, Mile. Bartho in new
'dances; Gruet, xSeers and Gruet, comedy
acrobats; Bogart and O'Brie, musical
â . comedians; George H. Fielding, comedy
juggling, and Kerner's Visions of Art
1 with several now subjects. Matinees
! Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.
Alcazar.
"Young Mrs. Winthrop" is next
week's bill at the Alcazar. "Niobe"â
though you wouldn't guess it from the
name â was written to evoke lauehter.
Its successor has just the opposite ef
fect. But all the trouble ends in a re
conciliation and Young Mrs. Winthrop
and young Mr. Winthrop live happy
ever after.
Oivjmpia.
The Olympia Music Hall retains the
biograph with new scenes, including
the Thirteenth United States Infantry
in heavy marching order, artillery re

monitor Amphitrite and several thrill
ing war scenes, including Spanish

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points, of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In the interior and low
along thÂ« coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali

In summer and colder weather in winter. The

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. . May , 14.â There was a very
obvious disposition to-day in ; speculative cir
cles to leave J the stock f market ' alone, pending
the development of the next move of the Span
ish and ': American ' squadrons. >â¢ The ' outside i In
terest in the market was â¢mall. The \ depres
â¢ion on de London stock market qmiimi Belong
here for London account, which caused a de
pression. London's gulet feeling was due to
the plain speaking of the British Secretary of.
State for the Colonies. Mr. Chamberlain, as to
the likelihood of a EuropeAn coalition against
Great Britain. Apparently bo account was
taken by dealers nl securities of the speaker's
assurance that intervention In favor of Spain
would not be assented to by England. All
turned on the expected news of Admiral Samp
son, and the depression in London would prob
ably not be valuable In a purely sympathetic
way, but American securities â¢ offer a particu
larly good market Just now, so that foreign
holders . were glad to realize on them. The
consequent losses In the International stocks
decided the tone of the market. Offerings for
London account were well absorbed in spite
of the prevailing dullness, and prices were
lifted above the London parity. â¢
The strength of sugar on the advance of
prices of the product and the favorable bank
statement and hardening prices in the sec
ond hour wrought a few net gains, frac
tional net losses were the rule at the close.
The latter part of the week has been a reac
tion in the stock market, but last prices are
still substantially above last Saturday, execpt
in some of the specialties. Net gains range
from a fraction up to 4 points.
This week the demand for money from the
interior has practically ceased, and some of the
bankers report that they have received ship
ments of currency from their out-of-town cor-
respondents.
Deposits have Increased over $7,000,000, and
the lean and cash reserve has expanded so
as to more than keep pace. Rates for time
money collapsed to S@6 per cent for periods
as long as three months; call .cans were made
at 1% per cent, and there is active bidding for
commercial paper at 6 to 6 per cent. It Is evi
dent that financial institutions all over the
country feel themselves amply provided for to
meet the demand of customers In subscribing
to the new Government bonds. If Issued.
Naturally gold has ceased to come from
abroad. Exchange has risen to $4 85% per
pound sterling, and is being held instead of
drawn, as the money commands a high rate
abroad. The country's money supply has been
vastly expanded, and with the return of con
fidence and extension of credit there is the
likelihood of great increase of Industrial and
speculative activity.
The bond market has moved In sympathy
with stocks, the latter part of the week show-
Ing some reaction from earlier strength and
activity. United States new 4s coupon ad
vanced % per cent; the 5s and the old 4s cou
pon % per cent, and the old 4s registered hi
per cent in the bid price.

gained their nerves and put out short lines
with more assurance than has been discerni
ble In the past fortnight. They reckoned with
out their host, however. Thrp u s, n various
brokers Leiter gradually absorbed offerings and
shortly before the clows the short sellers found
themselves pocketed. In their anxiety to even
un July was advanced steadily to $1 07. Half
an hour before the close a realizing movement
set in which could not be stemmed. July went
off half at a quotation touching $1 04 Just be
fore the gong sounded. A slight rally carried
It back to $1 04%, closing with sellers at thnt
price, a net gain of %c. May opened 20 cents
lower at $1 80. the price practically nominal,
the recession of 20c being found necessary on
a sale of 15.000 bushels. Leiter picked up the
offering, and on his evident willingness to sup
port the price it was advanced at the close to
$1 44%, showing, however, a net loss of oV*c.
The heavy receipts of Corn and the opening
weakness of Wheat made a heavy market for
the former at the opening. The rally in Wheat

cash demand caused a change in the tone and
the recovery of the early loss with an addi

WEEKLY BANK STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, May 14.â The Financier says:
The New York banks, according to their state
ment, hold a surplus of nearly $47,000,000, the
largest reported since last July. The down
ward tendency of the money market finds a
logical explanation in the statement, with Its
reported heavy gains of cash. The movement
to the interior, which has been a constant fac
tor in the situation for weeks past, is almost
if not quite wholly at an end, and the dimin
| lshing probability of an early bond issue has
| brought banks to the point where they prefer
to put their money to use rather than allow
It to lie Idle.
The Government continues Its heavy dis
bursements, and gold imports are also adding
to the stock of money in sight. The whole
I outlook, therefore, favors an easy market, not
> only here but elsewhere.
The expansion in loans is a favorable mdi!
! cation of better business conditions, and while
i some of the increase reported for the week is
| due to stock exchange activity, there is more
I doing in mercantile paper, so the banks have
| not been slow to increase their investment
in that line at rates considerably under those
quoted for some time past. The National
! bank reports now being made are expected to
; show unusually high reserves held by the in-
I terior banks, and this will be important in de
| termintng the course of money for the rest of
I the M&coa. In New York the banks have fal-
I len off heavily in principal Items, but in Chi
cago and other cities gains seem to be the
rule.
A reflex movement to this center, of course,
demoralizes the market, but once it is known
that a bond issue is not to be made for some
time to come, such a movement is bound to
follow. The business conditions throughout
the United States are more favorable, however,
for the use of a great deal of money that Is
otherwise idle capital here. The gains In de
posits for the week were made In great part
by four or five of the leading banks and the
large increase is also traceable to them, but
] the causes operating to procure them will soon
be reflected in other Institutions with results
not at all difficult to foresee.

NORTHERN WHEAT MARKET.
PORTLAND, May 14.â There watt a slight
lull in the wheat business to-day. Ninety-four
cents was the ruling quotation for Portland de
livery, although a round lot of Walla Walla
would probably bring slightly higher prices.
Valley commands but a very slight percentage
over Walla Walla. Bluestem is quoted at 9S@
99c.
Cleared: German steamer Tal Pu with 14,000
barrels flour; British steamer Alula Craig with
2,360,000 feet of lumber, both for Vladivostok.
The vessels left at the same hour and the mas
ters have laid a wager on the passage.

THE JOLLY LOB LOLLY
resently walking
up Market street,
Ban Francisco, I
met a queer little
old man. He had
on a sailor suit. His
eyes were sharp
and merry. He had
Iron-rimmed spec-
tacles which were tilted on his nose,
raking like a wooden' yard across the
mast of a fishing schooner. Hoisting
his trousers, sailor fashion, he said to
me:
'â¢Get a little boy and a little girl to
go along and I will tell the Lob-Lolly
to show you how to have some fun."
Sure enough, two San Francisco chil
dren, Charlie and Kaiy, happened to
be coming down the street and I hailed
them, as the pallors say, and the Lob-
Lolly joined us, and we went on to
gether, with the queer little old man
acting as a pilot or guide. Charlie and
Katy were the same age, about 11.
Where the Lob-Lolly came from I do
not know.
We came opposite the Lotta fountain
and there the queer old man nodded
his head and threw off his coat and
disclosed so much rope wrapped around
his body closely as wculd fill a win4
lass.
"Is this the place?" asked the Lob-
Lolly.
"Yes," said the queer old man, "and
just think what fun we will have. Do
you like to swing, my dears?"
"Yes, indeed." said both of the chil
dren at once.
"All right, Lob-Lolly," said the old
man, "pull away then." At the same
instaoit he presented the end of the
bight of rope to the Lob-Lolly and
steadied himself on a stout Malabar
cane, brought over seas, balancing him
self upon the cane as if it were a pivot.
The Lob-Lolly took hold of the rope
and ran away with it, exactly as if
he were on ship board. Headed in the
direction of the Twin Peaks the Lob-
Lolly tore along with great speed. The
queer old man did not move from his
post, but the steady Unrolling of the
rope, it being all in one tremendously
long piece, caused him to spin around
and around and around ten thousand
timesâ a human tee-to-turn or top.
Finally, all the rope was unwound.
A dense crowd of people had gathered
on Market street and the assemblage
gazed with curiosity at the spectacle.
Presently the queer old man, as soon
as he could recover his breath, seized
the rope and held one end of it up to
his mouth, like a telephone, and
shouted:
"Hello, Lob-Lolly."
"Hello, Sinbad."
"Where are you, Lob-Lolly?"
"Out on Twin Peaks, Sinbad, a-cool
ir.g off."
"Come in. Lob-Lolly."
"All right."
Shortly after the Lob-Lolly came
down Market street on a cable car and
Jumped off ami asked "What now?"
"Make a swing-."
Where from?"
"Hang- it from the top of the Spreck
s building and the Shot Tower."
Up the steep and tall wa.ll of the
ureckels building the Lob-Lolly
Mmbed, hanging on with the ease of a
Hy, and fastened one end of the rope
to the top of the dome. Then he slid
down the rope with great speed, and
we looked on, expecting to see him
dashed to pieces, but noâ he struck
and bounded up like a rubber ball,
twenty feet hiKh, fully, seized the end
of the rope and was off like a shot,
holding test to the rope.
He climbed the front of the Palace
Hotel building and then bounded from
house top to house top light as thistle
down, even leaping across streets from
one house to another, trailing the rope
behind him, like the drawn-out and
solidified tail of a very eccentric
comet, all the way. And then there

was a shout from the multitude; an
approving smile from the queer old
man as the Lob-Lolly, many blocks
away, balanced himself on the very
top of the Shot Tower and drew in the
rope until it swung above the tops of
scores' of buildings, blown freely back
and forth by the wind.
At once 500 boys saw the fine chance
offered and begged the queer old man,
"Gimme a swing, mister?"
The old man chuckled and whispered
to the Lob- Lolly, who had come back
along the rope, hand over hand, in true
man-of-war fashion, and was once
more beside his queer companion.
"Go to a hardware 6tore and get 500
hooks and chains and tell the store
keeper to charge them to Sinbad."
Five hundred boys heard and ap
plauded; 500 boys were soon swinging
at once, on this most royal of all
swings, filling the air with laughter
and Â«hrieks of fear; 500 boys cried when
Sinbad and the Lob-Lolly, one at either
end of the great swing, swayed the line
until it swung higher and higher and
higher, not only swung higher, but ac
tually went over and over, so that 500
boys, securely held by the chains and
hooks, the latter being fastened to their
waistbands, went hundreds of feet
high in air â as far above the top of
the Spreckels building as the swing
had depended below the top. Then
around and around, until they were
whirled so fast that they looked like
a string of black boys on a wire.
The boy in the middle of the rope,
who was swung the hardest and high
est, was Charlie.
"Great fun," were hi 3 first words
when he came down.
"Irn-mense," said 499 other boys.
"Ha, ha! Ho, ho! Hee, hee!" said
the crowd.
"Didn't I tell you we would have
fun?" asked the queer old man, as he
came along with the Lob-Lolly. "Oh!
but that's only a starter, and wp can
do better than that later on. You'll
fee."
Charlie's eyes glistened, and Katy
looked wonderingly at the two queer
ones.
"Say," remarked the Lob-Lolly, "you
children must be hungry. Let's see,"
feeling around in his pockets. "I've got
a peanut here somewhere. Yes, here
it is. Now I am very particular how
that is cracked, but when it has been
cracked I will divide it between you
and that will be a feast. It is not good
for children to overeat!"
"Oh," asked Katy, "do you think one
peanut would be too much lunch for
two of us?"
"Can't tell. Perhaps you are strong
enough to stand it, "specially since
Charlie has been exercising on the
swing a little. But come on, I can't
crack this peanut here. We'll go and
find a machine that will do the work
uj> brown."
We went down Market street to the
water front, and there found a pile
driver that towered high above the
highest building.
"Just the thing," said the Lob-Lolly,
'just the thing. Now we can crack
the peanut in fine style and you shall
lunch at once."
The Lob-Lolly laid the peanut, which
was not a very big one, on the top of
a pile, that was about to be driven.
Then he climbed up so high that Katy
was dizzy looking at him.
"Are you getting hungrier?" he
trumpeted down from the height.
"Yes, hurry up," said Charlie, who
was g-t-tting excited.
Crush: The big weight of the pile
driver fell whistling through the air
and struck with a shock that shook
buildings to their foundation andâ but
the peanut.
"Haul away!" shouted the Lob-Lolly,
and the pile-driver engrine puffed, out
of breath, while the weight went up

"But," asked the Lob-Lolly, when he

came down and hunted for the peanut,
"where is your lunch?"
The peanut had stuck to the bottom
of the weight,
"Never mind," said Sinbad. "I know
where they are cooking dinner and we
can stand in the door and smell the
stewed clams, but, say, isn't^ that a
great way to crack a peanut?"

DOTTY SMITH and her brother,
Willie, lived in a very pretty
country.
_ mm J Willie had many toys and a lit
tle bank where he saved his pen
nies, and silver. Dotty had four dolls.
Willie and Dotty lived near the river,
and they had fine times along the shore
throwing in sticks and stones and
little bits of bark which - they '. called
boats. Willie was 7 -years old and
Dotty was 9.
The river was not very deep and they
played near the shore all they chose.
They put lots of small sticks on a
bark boat and played they were boys
and girls going out for a sail. .
One day Dotty went to visit a play
mate and Willie played alone.
Willie got tired of playing, so he
thought he would have some fun.
He went slyly into the house and got
Dotty's four â the names are
Polly, Susy, Midge and Lauraâ set
them on a large board and started
them off for "Klondike." "; V ' '
. They sailed along in fine style. Willie
followed them along the river and was
pleased to see them sail. They got so
far away that he could, hardly see them.
Then he. went home. . . '.:â '.
Dotty had a playmate named Maud
who lived further down the river, and
Maud had a big black dog. Whenever
they threw sticks in the river the big
dog would bring the sticks back, in his
mouth. â¢â¢â â .;â .:â â¢ .-,.â â â  â¢â -â â¢â¢..â¢â .
. All at once Dotty noticed a boat com-:
ing along the river,, and she was sur
prised to see her own dolls sailing in
the boat. Maud said:
"P'raps Trip will get them."
Trip was the name of the dog. And
then Maud said:
"Trip, Trip."
. But the dog would not go into the
water unless something was thrown in
for him to go after. Maud threw a
stick and the dog swam out and got it,
but let the dolls sail away.
Maud ran home to tell her mamma.
Maybe' she could get them out. But
the board ran against a rock, all th?
dolls tipped out, and before Maud's
mamma arrived the empty board ha.l
floated far down the river.
Dotty went home very sad. When
she told her mamma what Willie had
done, Willies mamma said that he
must open his bank and give all his
pennies and silver he had saved to
Dotty to buy some new dolls. And
Willie never sent Dotty's dolls to
"Klondike" any mure.

Little ones must yo to rest;
Slet-ii, my babe, your bead reposes
Lovingly on mother's breast.
Close against the heart that loves you,

Happy thoughts come to thy brow.

Angels talk with baby now.
Sleep on there until the morrow
Dawns for thee so bright and fair;

May you always nestle there.

Baby's pressed to mother's breast;
Or the years will pass too quickly
When he'll leave the old home nest.

THE NAUGHTY SPIDERS
I* W* v*- n*w ~- . - ; ' Â»
â  *wi large family : of
jJe^Sk-P/A small spiders lived
raPg-g^ly Jr\ 'in " an old barn '
iÂ«B!r7^ Jr*\ They were very
â ^SK^I? * * lively little fellows,
and loved to play from the time the
sun rose until it set. ..
But their- busy mother never found
time for pleasure. She worked early,
and late to keep them fed and clothed.
One bright morning she decided that
they must learn something useful, so
she set them spinning. Then she went
away to her own work. â  .
Little Red Legs spun a long silky
thread, of which he was very, proud.
He ran up and down to show how
strong it was, crying, "See my ladder!
See my ladder!" '
"I can make a ladder, too, cried
Black Legs, kicking his spinning away.
"And so can I," "and I," "and I, ,
cried all the other little spiders to
gether. So they all made ladders and
climbed up and down, laughing merrily.
Just then a lively breeze came in at the
open door and every little spider was
swung to and fro at an alarming rate.
They clung desperately, to their lad
ders until the wind grew gentler. Then
they began to enjoy the stringing and
made ready for the next hard blow.
"Did you see me then?" cried Red
Legs, gasping for breath. "I swung
farther than anybody." '& -
But Black Legs was not to be out
done. He swung so far that he hit a
rafter, and nearly lost his hold. Then
every little spider swung. as hard as he
could." Two of the swings became
tangled together and could not be un
done, so their owners hti-.l to leave them
and make new. ; swings. Black Legs
again swung to the rafter, and suc
ceeded in fastening his swing there.:
"Now I have a bridge," he cried. And
every other little spider made a bridge
likewise. - â¢
When mother spider came to call her
children to lunch she was amazed to
find them running:, wildly back and
forth upon their bridges. â¢
She forgave them this time, for they
were very penitent. They meekly fol
lowed into the kitchen to have their
hands and faces scrubbed, and did not
murmur because the water was cold.
Even when the soap got in their eyes
they stood it like little majors.
Each one then had a slice of fly and
a drop of milk and was sent back to
spin again. For some time all went
well because the little spiders were try
ing-very hard to be good; But when
naughty Red Legs jumped up and be
gan whirling round and round, drag
ging his thread and tangling up every
one of his brothers' threads, and shout
ing, "A merry-go-round, a merry -.go
round," they could sit still no. longer,
but chased each other around in a
circle, till their heads spun,
r "Let's go outdoors and get some fresh
air," said Black Legs, holding his head.
So all his brothers trooped out after
him. Â . - . .
The first thing they spied upon the
road was a line locomotive, which Wil
lie had left there when Eddie Jones
called him to play ball.
"Let's have a ride." "A ride,"
echoed every little rogue. So they
quickly scrambled in. and left Fat Legs
to push. And poor, Fat Legs did push
with all his might and main. He lay
down on the ground and pushed with
all his eight legs at once, but he could
not make it budge.:. Then they all
helped, but still the locomotive .would
not go. â  ''/;;,:,, v
Meanwhile Red Legs had, a bright
idea. He saw that the engine contained
paper, wood and coal, ready to light.
All ' that was needed was something to
start the fire. â¢
"I know what we'll do," cried he.
BY NINA C. KYLE,
SACRAMENTO.
"Catch a firefly to light It with. Then
it will go."
So they made a trap and lay very
still waiting. Soon a pretty firefly
came slowly buzzing by. She did not
notice where she was going, and flew
right into the trap. Red Legs caught
the poor little thing and quickly shut
her in the dark tirebox of the engine.
At first she was very badly frightened,
but finding that she was not hurt, she
lit her bright light to see where she
was. When, lo! the paper caught fire,
the wood began to burn, the coal
lighted, and soon the water in the
boiler was steaming. Then the little
engine began to puff, puff, puff, and
moved slowly down the road, carrying
the delighted little spiders with it.
"Hurrah!" they cried, dancing on
each leg in turn. "Hurrah, for a ride!"
The engine went faster and faster,
rattling over stones and rushing over
sticks at such speed that it nearly
threw the frightened little spiders out
on the road; and all the bugs and
worms crossing Its path ran wildly
here and there to get out of the way.
But there was no one to put more coal
on the fire, and it soon burned down,
letting the water cool and the steam
grow less, so that the engine went more
slowly.
The spiders drew a long breath of re
lief, and let go their frantic hold of one
another. They were very glad, though,
when the engine stood still, and three
or four of them fell sprawling in their
haste to get out. They decided to walk
home andÂ»be good children the rest of
the day.
On the way they found a pile of little
round black seeds, which some busy
ants had stored away for winter.
"See the balls, the balls!" they shout
ed. Let's have a game of football."
Red Legs was captain of one team,
and Black Legs was captain of the
other. They chose sides and stood
facing one another ready to play. You
never saw better kickers. They had so
many legs, you see! And they could
run pretty well, too â that is, all of them
except poor clumsy Fat Legs, so he was
chosen umpire.
The game was fast and furious. First
one side had the ball and then the
other. When Red Legs caught the ball
he would not let it go, but wrapped his
many legs around it, making a ball of
himself. Black Legs tried to take it,
and soon there was a very dreadful
fight.
Just then mother spider appeared on
the scene. When she found her chil
dren gone, she hunted high and low for
them. She searched the yard and
peeped into all the holes and cracks in
the barn; but they were nowhere to be
seen. So she hurried to Granddaddy
Long Legs, an old gray spider, who
lived on the other side of the barn. He
was a very wise and good old man, and
was fairy godfather to most of the lit
tle spiders in his neighborhood. Mother
spider politely Inquired about his rheu
matism, and was glad to hear that it
was better. Then she said: "Grand
daddy Long Legs, please tell me which
way my children have gone." In an
swer he slowly straightened out one of
his long, slender legs and pointed down
the road. Mother spider thanked him,
and immediately set off in search of the
runaways.
She found tJfem jumping around in
great excitement, with Red Legs and
Black Legs rolling over and over in
their midst. Sad, indeed, she felt to pcÂ«
her children so naughty, hhe ranged
them in a line and walked behind to see
that they behaved.
When they reached home, she put
them right to bed without supper, and
without their usual good night kiss.
\s they lay snugly tucked in their
swinging cradles they felt very un
happy and longed for morning to come,
so that they might show what good lit
tle spiders they could be.
VERDICT OF JUDGES
THE county school superinten
tendents are still behind with
their opinions as story Judges.
That Is, some of them are. If
they were children we would be
compelled to put a tardy mark against
the names of at least six of them. If
these six will only get their opinions in
this week all will be well, but they do
not know how anxious thousands of
boys and girls are to hear from them
or they would make haste. The judges
who have reported have something in
teresting to say, and it is to the point.
Below are some of the expressions of
opinion â the judgments of those who
have made a study of children under
favorable circumstances.
Superintendent Hyatt of Riverside
County finds that "the girls' page Is
very much better than the boys'. It has
more variety, is more elastic, more
sympathetic in character."
George M. Robertson, president of the
Berkeley Board of Education, on the
other hand, says: "My judgment is
that the boys have written better than
the girls, and I feel that it is not
due to prejudice, for a young girl who
herself writes stories agrees with me,
and, in fact, expressed that opinion be
fore hearing my own."
Superintendent Howard of Sacramen
to County writes that "in freshness and
origiriality honors are even. But the
girls are champions if judgment be
based on the important point of liter
ary superiority. The girls' work sug
gested something beyond the work of
to-day â gives a promise of better ef
forts later, of broader sympathies. The
boys have set up limitations for them
selves in the shape of a narrowness of
scope, suggestive of one field of
sympathy, bounded by the machine
shop, the prairie, the fortress. There is
sex in taste more than in style."
Superintendent Finch of Glenn Coun
ty finds "as a whole, the girls' page of
stories the better."
Superintendent G. H. Stout of Butte
County holds the same opinion. "While
the boys' stories are pretty well writ
ten, yet I think that the girls have done
the best. I cannot help praising the
brave boys who wrote so well, but
shall have to cast my vote for the
girls."
Superintendent Linscott of Santa
Cruz differed with all the preceding. He
finds that the boys have excelled in va
riety, originality and strength, but that
the girls displayed better construction,
a better choice of words, and they have
a better style.
Superintendent Kate Ames of Napa
County does - *â¢ clearly rule for either
the boys or the girls, but her opinion
shows a sympathy for both that will
win her many strong friends among all
the young people. Here is the conclud
ing sentence of her opinion: "There is
a ruggedness, a whole-souledness about
the boys' stories, a boldness of imagi
nation, a vision of life as they see it.
The vision of the girls is as clear, and
as clearly eTessed, but it has been
narrowed and cramped by their en
vironment."
Superintendent Harriet L. Wilson of
Colusa County says that "of the stories
submitted for consideration and com
parison, those by the boys were the
A FAIRY TALE
Now how shall I tell you, my darlings?
Will you have it in story or song?
Shall I'sing in in five little verses,
Or is that too awfully long?
It is all about Jack o' the sunbeams,
A Prince of the fairies is he;
He came from the island of Roses
In a shell that blew over the sea.
And little Red Rover, the Princess,
Who lived in a hut on the hill,
Where the winds tossed the buds of the clover
And the buttercups never were still.
It was just on the edge of the meadow,
Near the shade of an old apple tree,
And nobody saw how it happened
Save only a squirrel and me.
Jack found her asleep in a poppy,
And she never awakened nor stirred.
So he carried her off to his island
On the back of a little brown bird!
BOYS and girls who have sent
stories or verses for publication
and who have not received them
back rtiiiy safely hold the idea
thtir work will appear in print.
But many questions are asked, the
summary of all of which is. "When?"
The answer is, as soon as possible.
Short stories have a better chance
than long stories to get in early, be
cause room on the page is limited.
All good stories are welcomed; not
better." Mrs. Wilson says al:o: "The
stories were, all in all, very creditable,
and exhibited literary talent."
Julia L. Jones, Superintendent of
Mariposa, finds "greater originality of
thought in the girls' page, but more of
the essential qu Mties of the best prose
style â more simplicity, clearness and
energyâ in the work of the boys,"
As a whole, I
consider the girls'
page of stories the
better. I think that
from the two pages
WILLIAM F. FINCH,
Supt. Glenn Co.
no satisiac to r y
conclusion can be drawn as to the lit
erary superiority in sex of children.
Though loth to
admit it I must
decide that of the
stories submitted

thoee by the boys were the best. This
does not imply, however, that there 13
superior literary ability in the male sex
in children. To determine this would ne
cessitate a knowledge of the ages, the
opportunities and the environments of
the boys and girls. The stories were, all
In all, very creditable and exhibited lit
erary talent.
With reference
to the competition
in story writing I
consider the boys*

JULIA L. JONES,
Supt. Mariposa Co.
â I find greater orig
inality of thought in the girls' page but
more of the essential qualities of the best
prose styleâ more simplicity, clearness
and energyâ in the work of the boys. Do
the two pages show that there is any lit
erary superiority in sex in children? No,
I think not. Other things may not have
been equal.
I have read with
a good deal of in
terest the â¢ boys'
and girl's' letters.
While the stories
are all pretty well
G. H. STOUT,
Supt. Butts Co.
written, yet I think the girls have done
the best. Boys of that age are hero-wor
shipers, and as a consequence they all
write of heroic deeds.
The girls look more upon the ethical
side of life, and write of the triumph of
the good and pure over the ugly and in
human.
But I think the girls have written more
connectedly and more smoothly.
Girls, as a rule, like language, and early
learn to express themselves more accu-
I cannot help praising the brave boys
who wrote so well, but shall have to cast
my vote for the girls.
Our boys and
girls are to be con
gratulated upon
the excellence of
the work submitted

April 17 and April 24. There is so much
in each page that merits praise that it
is somewhat difficult to judge which is
the better. The difference between boys
and girls in the selection of subjects and
the treatment of the same makes it very
bard to compare their work. Firstâ Which
pan is the more interesting? In my
judgment, greuter variety ot topics, orig
inality and stronger treatment makes the
boys' page more interesting. Secondâ
Which shows the greater amount of lit
erary ability? In the construction of sen
tences, in the choice of words and in the
smoothness of style the girls' page is su
perior.
only stories, but suggestions.
This page is for the amusement of
the boys and girls. If they do not get
â¢what they want it is because they do
not ask for it.
Boys and girls, do not hesitate to
make your wishes known. The field of
young story-tellers is widening.
They not only write better stories but
more of them. The competition Just
closed has shown that the Pacific Coast
children are very bright.

NEVADA BANK HAS
WON THE CASE
It Will Collect a Large Sum
as a Deficiency Judg
ment.
Creditors of Ltnfortri, KÂ«lloggf A Co.
Estopped From Disputing
the Claim.
After many years of litigation and lying
In the courts awaiting decisions, argu
ments, etc.. on technical propositions, the
matter of proceedings in the case of
James I/inforth, John Bensley and L. B.
Benchley, copartners under the firm name
of I.lnforth, Kellegg & Co.. was brought j
to an end yesterday by United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven in a decision ren
dered from the bench.
The proceeding was commenced by the
assignee in bankruptcy under section 5081,
Revised Statutes of the United States,
for the purpose of determining the valid
ity of the claim tiled by E. W. Chapman I
against the individual assets of John
Bensley, who was a copartner in the ;
firm. The facts of the case are these:
On November 24, 1875. John Bensley exe
cuted to the Nevada Bank of San Fran
cisco his promissory note for $80,000, pay
able one year after date with interest.
The bank assigned the note and mort- ;
ease to James Coffin for collection onlj ,
and" he began an action to foreclose the j
mortgage. The parties afterward came i
together, and the assignees and Benblej. !
induced the court to make an order pro
viding that in any judgment for fore- :
Closure the plaintiff should waive any
personal judgment against Bensley bank
rupt The action never proceeded to
judgment and was dismissed on March |
Previous to the dismissal Bensley and ;
his creditors and those of the firm had
agreed that the court should enter a de
cree of final discharge of Bensley in the
bankruptcy proceedings and direct the
assignees to reconvey to him his individ
ual property free from and discharged of
said proceedings In bankruptcy, with the
understanding that the rights of the in
dividual creditors of Bensley to any prop
erty or security that they might hold
or "be entitled to should not be preju- ;
diced or affected. Bensley agreeing to pay |
all claims in the same manner and to the
same extent as if said bankrupt proceed- ,
ings were never entered into.
In December, 1880, Coffin reassigned to
the Nevada Bank the note anJ mortgage, ]
and the bank began proceedings against ;
Bensley for foreclosure. On June 5, 1882,
judgment was entered in favor of the
bank against Bensley for $93,753 94 with
costs, and the sum of $57,152 92 was real
ized from the sale of the property, leav
ing a deficiency of $37,727 51, which was
docketed as judgment against Bensley.
An appeal from the deficiency judgment
was entered on the ground that Benwiey j
not having been personally served with
summons in the action, the court had no
jurisdiction to render a personal judg
ment against him for such deficiency.
The claim was then assigned to Chap
man on December 7. 1883, and a decree
was entered setting aside certain con
veyances of real property alleged to have
been made by Bensley for the purpose of
defrauding his creditors, vacating the
former judgment of discharge of Bensley
from bankruptcy and compelling the re
conveyance of all property conveyed to !
Bensley by the assignees in bankruptcy j
pursuant to said order.
In rendering the decision Judge de
Haven paid: "In my opinion the .firm
creditors are stopped by their agreement '
from disputing the claim now made by '
Chapman to be paid out of the individual J
estate of Bensley, and the effect of the i
decree was to bring again all of the In- !
dividual assets of Bensley under the jur
isdiction of this court for administration
In the bankruptcy proceedings, but it did
not affect the then existing right of Chap
man under the agreement to enforce pay
ment of his claim against Bensley out of j
such assets."
The prayer of the assignees was accord
ingly denied.
Sent to the County Jail.
Harry Shilto, convicted of petty larceny,
ami George Foy. who pleaded guilty to a
charge of simple assault, were sentenced
by Judge Cook yesterday to each serve
a term of three months" imprisonment in
the County Jail.

Cultured Members of the California
Club Honor the Red Cross.
That the vagrarips of mid-May weather
have no power to dampen the enthusiasm
or dull the interest of the members of the
California Club was proved by the large
attendance at their meeting in the Cen
tury Club rooms yesterday.
Mrs. John Ruse of Oakland, chairman of
the department of philanthropy, outlined
the proposed work of that division briefly
but clearly, and was followed by Mrs.
Mary Lake, chairman of the department
of education; Mrs. J. "W. Orr, acting
chairman, in the absence of Dr. Dorothea
Moore of the department of civics; Mrs.
I. Lowenberg, chairman of the depart
ment of arbitration; and Mrs. George H.
Ripley, acting for Mrs. Ramon E. Wilson
of the department of art, music and lit
erature, each of whom gave a compre
hensive sketch of the special lines upon
which these different branches intend
working.
Mrs. M. O. Bretherick accepted the
chairmanship of the sub-department of
music, Mrs. Ella M. Sexton was appointed
