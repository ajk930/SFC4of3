WAS CLARK IN
LOVE WITH HIS
BROTHER'S WIFE?
The Widow of the Dead Man Advances
a Possible Motive for the
Murder.
BITS FROM THE NAPA TRAGEDY.
BT. HELENA, Jan. 21.â The officers
are gradually linking the chain of evi
dence that may convict George Willard
Clark of t' c murder of his brother,
William, here yesterday morning. The
nee against the accused man is
accumulating rapidly, and the officers
are positive of his guilt.
After George Clark had been placed
in Jail the officers made a search of his
room and found, among other things, a
box of cartridges of the same caliber
us the ;!stol found at the feet of the
murdered man on the morning of the
tragedy, with only five shells mis-sing
from the box. There was also dis
closed a sheet of paper, carefully fold
ed. The officers examined it and found
It to be an alleged statement from W.
A. dark to his family, declaring that
he was about to commit suicide, that
he was tired of life, and that a pack
age of strychnine would be found
back of the clock in the sitting room
and a box of cartridges in the base
ment of his house. Written on the
margin of the paper were the words:
"George is innocent."
The officers took the statement and
went to the dead man's house, where
they found the package as directed.
They learned that George Clark had
been in the house on Wednesday, and
had been alone in that room for ten or
fifteen minutes. A trip Into the base
ment did not reveal anything except
fresh shoe tracks In the dust, which
correspond in size with the muddy
shoes of the accused. A trip was made
by the officers from Dr. Osborne's gate
up Kearney street to Madrone avenue,
and thence to the home of the Clarks
on Railroad avenue. Tracks were
found in the mud, into which the shoes
worn by George Clark were carefully
placed. They fitted perfectly.
The most telling evidence against the
prisoner is a statement by the widow
of his victim to the effect that he had
on several occasions asked her if she
would marry him if her husband were
dead. Mrs. Clark says, also, that her
brother-in-law made improper ad
vances to her.
George Clark was seen by The Call â 
correspondent shortly after his arrest
and made the fallowing statement:
"I am entirely inocent of any knowl- j
edge of the circumstances of my broth- j
er's death. On "Wednesday morning ',
until between 10 and 11 I spent the time
about town. When going up Iklaln j
ptreet about 11 o'clock I met Dr. Os
borne, and he asked when I was go
ing to pile Borne wood for him. I said
I would go up at once. This I did and
worked on the wood until noon, when I
â¢went Into my little cottage on the doc
tor's premises and prepared and ate j
my dinner. After that I went over to I
my brother's house and asked my sis- j
ter-ln-law to let me take the little boy. i
George, to the doctor's while I flnis'"^ i
The San Francisco Call
the work. George accompanied me and ;
I piled wood until about 3 o'clock, when
I took the boy home again. I then
spent the time about town until 5:30, i
when I grot my supper. About 7:30 j
o'clock I went to the Advent Church to
attend prayer meeting. When it was
over I went directly to my room and to
bed and did not leave until awakened j
by the doctor and Marshal Johnson !
about 7 o'clock Thursday morning."
George has been very unfriendly with :
his brother for some time. He boarded j
with William most of the time of late
years. Their father in the East, hear- \
ing of th** family troubles, sent for
George, who went back and lived with
his parents for a short time. He re- i
turned to St. Helena and again took
up his residence with his brother, and
remained there until a few weeks ago.
About this time William Clark found
a very strong dose of strychnine in his
coffee â enough to kill several men. He
directed suspicion to his brother George
and gave him strict orders to leave the
premises and not return.* George
begged to be permitted to remain, but
wag met with a firm refusal. He has
since been living on Dr. Osborne's
place.
Mrs. Clark, the widow of the mur
dered man, says George was always
cranky and disagreeable, and made
himself an enemy of his brother. He
was a religious fanatic, having joined
the Methodists, the Salvation Army,
the Methodists again and then the Ad
ventists. George says that his brother

YREKA, Jan. 21. â Morris Cronin, a mining man, shot and fa
tally wounded his brother this afternoon about four miles below
Sawyers Bar. The brothers had been on unfriendly terms for
some time, having had trouble over a mining claim.
About 3 o'clock this afternoon Morris Cronin met his brother
Patrick on the trail between Sawyers Bar and the latter's claim
and shot him three times â through the groin, in the neck and in
the leg.
The doctor who was summoned has pronounced the wounds
fatal, and the brother who did the shooting gave himself up this
evening. Sheriff Hobbs has sent a deputy over the mountain to

CLARK GROWS NERVOUS.
The Murder Suspect Passes a Sfeepfess
Night in Napa's Jail.
XAPA. Jan. 2Lâ George Willard
Clark, the suspected murderer of his
brother, William dark, passed a rest
less night in the County Jail. He tossed
upon his bed and slept but little. With
the passing of time the signs of guilt
noticeable In his manner seem to In
crease. This morning he was nervous
and seemed to be in great distress of
mind. He ate a light breakfast. Slowly
but surely is the chain of evidence
tightening about the man, and the
opinion seems general that the hang
man at San Quentin will have another
task to perform, with Clark as the sub
ject.
The reputation of George Clark will
count against him. He was not held
high in public estimation even before

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 21.â 'Like
a fabled monster in its death throes
the syndicated press, undoubtedly in
stigated by the Los Angeles City Wa
ter Company and its corporation al
lies, has been wildly and blindly
striking out in every direction, hoping
by some chance to inflict serious in
jury upon one or another of those
who have been engaged in the battle
against them and for the people.
The culmination of the vicious, ma
lignant and cowardly assaults came
this morning. It was in the shape of
an editorial directed ostensibly nt H.
W. Patton, who was the Democratic
candidate for Congress from the
Sixth District during the last cam
paign. Mr. Patton has held positions
under the Federal Government, is one
of the trustees of the Highlands In
sane Asylum, and only recently re
signed his position as trustee of the
Whittier Reform School. He has been
prominent politically for more than
ten years, and neither his official rec
ord nor his private character has
ever before been assailed in public or
private.
During all these years he has also
been engaged in newspaper work In
Southern California, and has always
been above reproach, whether acting
in the capacity of employe or pub
lisher. These facts make the attack
printed in the Herald this morning the
more dastardly. While, as already
stated, the editorial \\as apparently
aimed at Mr. Patton in his public
character, it was in reality designed
to injure, discredit and disparage
him in. revenge for his supposed part
in the exposures recently made in The
Call in reference to the water com
pany's proposed steal.
Mr. Patton, It may be stated. Is The
Pall's regular resident correspondent
in this city. The editorial in question
Is as follows:
For pome months it has been an open
secret that H. W. Patton is booked for
the appointment of State Bank Examin
er. t" fill the next vacancy that occurs.
Mr. Pat ton himself hns made this an
open secret by proclaiming on every con
venient ocasion that he has an Iron-bound
and brass-riveted pledee from Governor
Budd to that effect. Without presuming
to question the authenticity of Mr. Pat
ton's proclamation, and without any de
sire to butt its head against the inevit
able, the Herald wishes to observe that
such an appointment. If made, would he
en exceedingly bad one. It would be dis
creditable for the administration, disas
trous to the Democratic party In this end
of the State, and an injustice to the pub
lic, in whose interests a bank examiner
is supposed to be employed. A good and
sufficient reason may be assigned for
each one of these objections. In the first
place. Patton knows no more about the
banking business that a Hottentot knows
of heaven. He Is not an accountant: he
Is not a man of business training; he Is
rot one whose judgment could be relied
upon to decide Involved and Intricate mat
ters such as the bank examiners are fre
quently confronted with.
Secondly, if a man is to be selected
from the ranks of the Democratic party
in Southern California for an office of
honor and emolument. Patton is -not a
creditable nor ah acceptable representa
tive. It has been openly charged that
during the last campaign in this district
Patton, having received the Democratic
nomination for Congressman, sold out
his claim for coin and retired from the
canvass. He negotiated with the Silver
Republican Campaign Committee and
transferred all of his right, title and in
terest to Barlow. There Is a man who
says he can show a check with Patton's
indorsement as evidence of this transac
tion. If this be true Patton was jrillty
of an act of treachery to his party which,
ought to forever bar him from partici
pation in its councils or a share in the
honors which it has to bestow. If the
story be not true Patton has had abun
dant opportunity to deny it In the col
umns if his own paper, for it was pub
lished more than a week ago. Instead
of denying It in an open, manly and hon
est way, however, he met It like a buf
foon and tried to convert the whole mat
ter into a joke. The rank and file of th 9
Democratic party In this end of the State
are too much in earnest to have their at
tention diverted by any such procedure.
They want to know whether Patton jug
gled and bartered away the high honor
which they onca conferred upon him. It
Patton has any defense to make which
he cannot make In his own paper the2
columns of the Herald are open to him.
But objections sufficient to bar him
from honors to bo conferred by a Demo
cratic administration may be found In
more recent transactions of this man. It
â was he who made an alliance, presum
ably for coin or political intrigue, with
Walter Webb, a Republican boss and
boodlerâ a man under indictment for ex
tortion, under investigation for malfeas
ance in office, a man under the condem
nation of this community for blackmail
ing teachers and grossly abusing his
trust. Patton. in his paper, the Capital,
took up the cudgels for this Republican
boodler, and incidentally cast aspersions
upon the League for Better City Govern
ment and the best elements of Los An
geles. Democratic and Republican alike.
N<>r did hÂ»> stop here. Patton, as the
local representative of the San Francisco
Cali. enlisted that paper in a campaign
in defense of the same Republican
boodler. If a man is to be judped by the
company he kÂ°eps. then Patton must be
content with a very low place in public
estimation. Not only has he failed to be
true to the best traditions of his party,
but he has betrayed the party itself, and,
fo far ;is he has been able, has brought
It into disrepute.
It can hardly be possible that Governor
Budd will choose such a man as the ob
ject of his favorâ giving into his hands
one of the most responsible and honor
able offices In the State. If he does so he
will be placing a premium on party
treachery, honoring the known friend of
Republican boodlers and delivering a slap
in the face to the best elements of the
Democratic party in this end of the
Btate.
Mr. Patton's reply to the Herald will
be found on file in the Superior Court
in the shape of a complaint suing for
$50,000 for damages on a charge at libel.
His answer to the public will be found
in an interview which follows:
"I never did say that I had the iron
bound, brass-riveted pledge of Gover
nor Budd to name me as Bank Com
missioner. As to my competency to
serve as Bank Commissioner I will leave
others who know me to answer. As to
the allegation that I sold out the Dem
ocratic nomination for Congress in the
Sixth District in 1896 for coin or any
personal consideration of any kind or
character, I simply say that it is a lie.
As to the charge that I made any alli
ance at any time for coin or political
Intrigue with Walter L. Webb or any
other man it is simply a dastardly
falsehood.
"The paper that printed this mass of
falsehoods will be called upon to prove
them in the Superior Court of this
county. I was told before I started in
on this water fight that the syndicated
newspapers would be strong enough to
ruin me. The first effort to carry out
that prediction is now made, but I am
still here and I am going to stay here.
I am simply making the fight I was in
structed to make for the San Francisco
Call in the matter of the water steal.
"My instructions are to give all facts
without fear or favor, to uncover all
official traitors, without regard to par
ty, to he just by the corporation and its
allies, but to expose their unfair
methods, their corruption and the prac
tices whereby they propose to put
through the largest single steal that a
suffering community on the Pacific
Coast has ever been called upon to
bear.
"Thos? instructions I am going to
carry out to the letter. I don't fear
the result. My record is an open bonk
and I am perfectly willing to abide by
it. A jury will pass upon the truth or
falsity of the Heralds charges and by
its verdict I am perfectly willing that
the public should judge me."
The libel suit Mr. Patton has insti
tuted against the Herald will attract
the attention of the entire State for
some of he most prominent political
leaders will be called as witnesses.
Among the citizens of Los Angeles' th^
attack of the Herald upon Mr. Pat
ton is looked upon simply as the pun
ishment the water company is striving
to inflict upon him because, in his ca
pacity as correspondent, he has done
his duty.
This is what Mayor M. P. Snyder
Eays in reference to the matter:
"Mr. Patton has offended against the
water company and its tools, and the
Herald's attack is the result. H*is of
fense constitutes the faithful perform
ance of his duty by the San Francisco
Call in its work of exposing the com
bine's attempt to hold up the taxpay
ers and water rate payers of this city,
and this is the price he has to pay. I
have had the sarnie kind of treatment,
and I know how to take it. Mr. Pat
ton's friends, and they are here by the
thousands, know him, however, and
this lying attack of the Herald will
have no effect on him. He has lived
here for fifteen years. He has made
his record, and his character is estab
lished. It cannot be taken from him by
the assaults of the monopoly press nor
by the tool of a corporation which is
attempting to put through a deliberate
steal upon the people of this city. I am
glad Mr. Patton has decided to sue for
libel. That he will get judgment I have
not the slightest doubt."
Councilman L. M. Grider: "Mr. Patton
is now getting the same measure of jus
tice that has been meted out to me by
the Herald and its confederates for the
last year. This is the price every citi
zen who maJtes himself more or less
prominent in the water fight will have
to pay."
The water fight is livening up and
is now occupying more space in the
syndicated daily newspapers and at
tracting the attention and interest of
more people than any local topic that
has ever before been discussed in this
community. When The Call arrived
this morning one local newsdealer at
Second and Main streets placed the
paper upon his bulletin-board and
above it he wrote in large letters:
"Cit!ze.iÃ, attention! Read The Call.
It is battling to save you $2,000,000."
Within a few moments a crowd con
gregated around the bulletin-board
that completely blocked the sidewalk.
Passersby were compelled to go Into
the street. For an hour this continued.
Finally a policeman was called to clear
the sidewalk. He did so, but in a few
moments another crowd gathered
Again the policemen cleared the walk
But it was with the same result. The
people were determined to read the pa
per and its exposure of the contem
plated steal and job.
At an early hour all the copies on
hand were disposed of and the bulle
tin-board was the only place where
readers could see the papeis, so they
continued to flock abc-ut it during the
afternoon. LOUIS SEIDENBERG

than appears on the surface. The
election of the Californian comes as
the culmination of a climax of a heat
ed contest that has been going on in
Democratic Congressional circles for
control of the committee, and it is a
distinct victory for the friends of Joe
Bailey. There is bad blood between
the Democratic factions. This is no
new thing, but in reality dates back
to the contest for Democratic leader
ship at the extra session of Congress.
when Bailey put a damper on the am
bitions of Benton. McMillin and sev
eral others by capturing the young
element and getting a good majority
of the votes for the Sp'eakership nom
ination.
The bitterness of feeling that was
developed in the proceedings follow
ing this event made the Democratic
leadership of the House a subject for
newspaper paragraphs and criticisms.
The old numbers who were turned
down by Bailey have never forgiven
him. From the day of his nomination
by the Democratic caucus his ene
mies began planning to down him.
There has been ;i constant play with
in the Democratic ranks for position.
The men who are after Bailey set cut
early to make a determined effort to
capture the Congressional cam;
committee with an idea of using that
more, or less useful institution. This
committee would, they figured, be in a
position to control newly elected mem
bers of Congress, and the Democrats
fondly look for many gains. They
recognized that among the present
Democrats Bailey has a good major
ity, and they saw that their only
chance would therefore be in captur
ing the new men. Ifclfillin of Ten
nessee has been regarded as a certain
competitor of Bailey until he entered
the contest for the Senatorship now
on at Nashville.
Since then the two men who have
come to t,he front in that capacity are
Richarson ..f TnniUâ nr and De Ar
nmnd of Missouri. There is no clash
between these gentlemen or their
friends; they are together in a com
mon cause and they have been acting
together in their play for control of the
Congressional Committee. The real
reason Buck Hinrichsen was beaten for
place on the committee was because
he was regarded as a friend of Bailey.
Serene in the belief that +ie was to rep
resent Illinois on the committee. Buck
had gone quietly ah-_-a<l securing
pledges of support until he had a ma
jority. The Bailey men begun to do
some crowing about that time, but they
rejoiced too early in the game. They
were dealing with men who knew a
thing or two about politics. It was
this and the Bailey crowd that turned :
the trick that put old man Hunter on
thÂ»- committee in place of the redoubt
able Buck. Altgeld had nothing to do
with it. Hunter was promised a fat
committee place if things worked out
all right. Campbell was against Ruck
for personal reasons and his dÂ«*capita
tloa was neatly accomplished. The
eyes of the Bailey men were opened.
About this time came the announce
ment of the candidacy of Tom IfcÃae
of Arkansas for the chairmanship of
the committee, and tho fine Italian
har.d of Jones of Arkansas, chairman
of the National Committee, was dis
covered in the anti-Bailey manipula
tions. He assumed charge of the
campaign, whoso object was to land
some one of the anti-Bailey men in the
chairmanship.
McÃae was preferred because of his
bitter antagonism to Bailey, and be
cause Jones could rely on him at all
times. It was Jones who had those
gold Senators kept on the committee.
He knew he could rely on them to vote
against Bailey, who is unpleasantly ag
gressive on the silver question, and
who does not hesitate to criticize when
the notion takes him. Faulkner and
Smith, Murphy and Mitchell were all
against Bailey, so Jones kept them on
the committee over the protests of the
silver men. All this time the Bailey
men were at sea as to their candidate.
They talked of Osborne of Wyoming
and Meyers of Indiana, but the oppo
sition captured Meyers, by agreeing to
make him secretary of the committee.
The suggestion of Senator White came
from Maddox of Georgia, who whs
looking for a compromise man. White
was sounded and found to be all right
according to the Bailey standards. He
could not be used against Bailey, and
that was the desideratum. This was
but a day or two before the caucus.
White was so strong that the anti-
Bailey crowd decided at the last mo
ment to execute a coup and make Sen
ator Cockrell of Missouri the candidate
instead of McÃae, and that coup came
very near knocking the Bailey plan
in the head.
The Bailey men had an intimation
of the purposes of the other crowd to
spring Cockrell. but they were hardly
prepared for the turn things took in
the meeting of the committee. The
Cockrell men Jumped to the front at
once as soon as nominations were In
order and put the Senator from Dp
Armond's State in nomination. When,
a minute aft<-r Osborne had nominat
ed White, he and the other Bailey men
had their breath knocked out by the
declaration of their nominee that un
der no circumstances would he be a
candidate against Cockrell.
In glowing language he painted the
virtues of the Senator from Missouri
and capped the climax by declaring
that it would be impossible for him to
give the time to the work of the eom
mitte that it required. The Bailey men
were aghast. They did not "know
whether this was a gold-brick scheme
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1898.
or what had hit them. Some of them
hurried to White and told him that he
could not throw them down that W9Cf,
and then they demanded that White
be considered as one of the nominees
before- the meeting. After the vot^ had
been taken and White was found
elected by a vote of IS to 15. thp Cali
fornia Senator made an enthusiastic
speech of acceptance, in which he made
no reference whatever to the declara
tions he made just before the ballot.
Indeed he seemed to have forgotten
that he had made any such speech, but
ft was not until to-day that the Bailey
people were thoroughly convinced that
they were not the victims of some gold
brick scheme. The vote in detail shows
that the Southern members of the com
wrere largely for White.
It leaked out to-day that Jerry Simp
son sought to -illy himself with the
Denv.-crats Â«nd take a place on the
committee. He was at the meeting and
found sponsors among the Western
men, or pome of them, but such a kick
was made by some of the Southerners
that his sponsors advised him to leave.

ORANGE SUPPLY
NOW TOO LARGE
Prices Favor the Buyer in the
Markets of Eastern
Cities.
DemÂ«n>i for Prunes Is Fair end the
Tendency of Quotations
Upward.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MBW FORK, Jan. I!l.â The Journal
of Commerce says: Trade in oranges,
it is stated by large handlers of fruit,
has been revolutionized within the past
two or three seasons by the growing
prominence of the California product.
The increase in duty under the pn-s.-nt
tariff law has, it is claimed, curtailed
shipments from Mediterranean ports,
and especially in Sicily fruit. So far
this year there have been received but 1
1800 boxes of the new crop of Si-ily
oranges, against 4200 boxes for the
same time a year ago and 114,000 boxes
in 1896, while the quantity now on the
way is very small. Reports of Valen
cia receipts by comparison with far
mer years do not show such a decided
falling off. though they were consid
erably smaller than in previous years,
and, according to advices from Eng
land, will, during the balance of the
season, be light.
Arrivals at English ports, it is stated,
show a considerable proportion of poor
fruit, and the cost of sound stock,
which buyers here, when they come
into the market at all, want, is there
by proportionately increased. Accord
ing to statistics of receipts kept by
the Fruit Buyers' Union arrivals of
Valencia orange? at this port from the
beginning of the season to date have
amounted to about 4000 cases, against
MOO cases for the same period last
year and 5700 cases in 1*96. but the
stock afloat or to be shipped to this
port la said to show a much greater
deficit.
The better output from Florida this
year, in connection with liberal ship
ments of California fruit to Eastern
consuming markets, which latter are
understood to have bo far aggregated
2000 cars, has caused a diversion of
buying interest to the domestic prod
uct. At present these supplies of all
descriptions seem to be in excess of the
demand and the market favors the
buyer.
Rumors of large sales of prunes for
arrival from California are not accept
ed by the majority of people in trade
with confidence. There has been bet
ter business of late both on spot and
future delivery and the market is de
cidedly firmer, but with the possible
exception of some good sized purchases
by Chicago buyers for shipment from
the coast there have been, It 1h said
by well informed people here, no im
portant transactions. Santa Clara
fruit is scarce and seems to be wanted.
Northern prunes, it is understood, have
sold fairly, but In nothing like the
quantity mentioned in some reports.
The current situation In prunes Is
strong and tendency of prices upward.

SCHAEFER IN RARE FORM.
Establishes a World's Record at the New
Balk Line Came.
CHICAGO, J;m. 21.â "Wizard" Sehaefor j
in his frame this afternoon with Catton
in the U-lncb balk lino tournament ran
his 40) points in tÂ» n inningsâ an average
of fortyâ which is Urn world's record at
the new game. The balls suited him, the '
temperature was ail right, and from the '
start it was evident that be was ready
to make tilings Interesting for his oppo
nent.
The "wizard" started off In quarter
horse style, making II from the play off.
and following with clever runs of 34 and
67. At this point Catton had one point to
his credit. This did not suit the Rock
Islander, and in the next three inning*
he put together 77 points. "Jake" came
back with 23, 27 and 25, and at the end
of the seventh Inning the call was
â charter, 210: Catton, S3. In the eighth
Inning Schaefer made one and Catton
scored a goose epg. Evidently Schaefer
thought enough time had been wasted on
the game, and without hesitation went
to work to knock out Eves' average. It
was Bchaefer In his old-time form, and it
was not until the "wizard" had made 106
points that he fell down on a hard cush
ion draw by a hair's breadth.
Catton could make but four from the
leave, and then Jacob ran the game out,
achieving an average of forty. The spec
tators went almost wild. Catton was the
first to congratulate Schaefer. and did not
seem to worry over his defeat. This af
ternoon's game makes the outcome of to
morrow night's contest very dubious, and
lyes will have to play his best to de
feat his old master. The score: Schaefer,
33, 34. B. 0. 23, 27. 25. 1. 106. 53â 400; aver
age. 40. Cotton, 1, 0. 11, 24. 42, 1. 10, 0, 4â93;
average 10 1-3.
Frank [yes this evening defeated- Spinks
in the most unsatisfactory game of the
billiard tournament by a score of 400 to
154. The balls would not roll kindly for
either player, and though for eighteen
innings Splnks only made an average of
a fraction over six it took lyes that
number of innings to make up his handi
cap. Ives began his twentieth inning
with 136 to go. The ivories rolled hard
for him and he had to earn every count
until ho had gathered sixty-five, when
the balls lined up in the balk almost
frozen. By a daring masse he not only
counted, but apparently hypnotized the
balls. They began to come his way and
by skillful line nursing he quickly secured
the necessary points, his 136 being the
highest run of the tournament. Score:
Ivesâ Total, 400; average. 20.
Spinksâ Total, 154; average, 7 7-10.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC BUYS
LAND IN SAN JOSE.
Belief That the Company Mends to Erect
a Union Depot and a Machine
Shop.
BAN JOSE. Jan. 21.â Southern Pa
cific Company has purchased twenty
three acres of land In the Polhemus
tract, between Polhemus street and Len
zen avenue, and it is rumored that the
company will erect a union depot and
extensive machine-shops on the property.
The Southern Pacific formerly owned
thirteen acres in that tract, and this last
purchase, made two days ago, will give
it a piece of forty acres.
T. P. Montgomery, who sold the land
to the railroad, could give no definite in
formation an to the object of the railroad
in buying the tract. The prevailing opin
ion is that a union depot will be erected
at the site, and that the old depots of the
broad and narrow gauge trains in this
city will be moved there. If such is the
case the track on Fourth street will be
abandoned, and the trains on the coast
road will run over tracks leaving the
main line near Hlllsdale and come in by
the present narrow-gauge depot. A
change in the Niles route into the city
will also be made.
Rumor has it the machine-shops at
Newark will be moved to San. Jose, and
that as soon as the coast route is com
pleted large machine-shops will be run
ning in San Jose.

NO DOG SAFE
IN FRESNO NOW
Purloining of Canines by
Prospective Klondik

Two Prominent Young Men
Arrested for Stealing a
St. Bernard.
Numerous Valuable Animals Have
Disappeared and Their Owners
Are Enraged.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
FRESNO, Jan. 21.â Owing to the big
j demand for suitable dogs for the Klon
dike, larceny of the animals is becom
ing very common and any dog of suf
! ficient size to haul a sled is not safe
â¢in Fresno, whether he is a prized
household animal or valuable in the
1 field or the chase. The dog, once con
i sidered a howling nuisance in Fresno,
; is now looked upon in admiration and
covetousness by many people who dis
cuss his points as to strength and en
j durance. The demand for canines suit
1 able for team work in Alaska has
; caused owners of line dogs consider
able apprehension during the last two
weeks. A heavy, stocky, shaggy
haired youn^ animal will bring from
! $30 to $50, and as high as $100 has been
offered for a dog regarded as especially
good for work.
< 'anines containing the predominat
ing characteristics of the St. Bernard,
shepherd and Newfoundland, although
; of unrecorded ancestry, are the favor
' ites with the persons getting up teams.
Such animals weigh from 80 to 100
pounds, have long shaggy hair, and
possess strength and endurance.
Many persons have been making a
â¢business of stealin- valuaole dogs and
selling them ti> parties preparing to rp
to the Klondike, and in some cases the
i prospective Klondikers themselves
have bee . guilty of canine larceny.
To-day George W. McDonald, the
irate owner of a stolen dog. swore out
a warrant for the arrest of Wes Moore
J and Frank Wyatt for stealing his
prized St. Bernard, and the young men,
both of whom are well known in the
city, were taken to Madera. There they
were fined $14 which they paid. Moore
and Wyatt had gone to McDonald's
place and offered to buy a large dog
owned by him. McDonald was not at
ho.ne, and his wife refused to sell the
dog. She heard one of the men say
"Not to Be Improved Upon in Purity and

Garrison party. Many other valuable
canines are missing, and a search is
being made for them among the differ
ent dog training places, of which there
are several.
N. P. Justy lost a valuable St. Ber

for a dog last night and this morning
it was stolen. Another prized St. Ber

have concluded to vigorously prosecute
all dog thieves.

BOGUS COIN FOR
SLOT MACHINES
Counterfeit Nickels Fou^d in
Large Numbers in
Fresno.
Used Exclusively in Playing Gam
bling Devices In Saloons
and Cigar Stores.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Jan. 21.â Fresno is at present
flooded with a very crude counterfeit
nickel. It is believed that the counter
feiters have their plant a few miles from
this city, where they turn out by the
hundred bogus 5-cent pieces. The spuri
ous coin is evidently made for the pur
pose of defrauding the nickel-in-the-slot
machines which are to be found In nearly
every saloon and cigar stand in the city.
The nickels are too crudely made to be
passed successfully, although some of
them might be taken without notice If
the receiver happened to be in a hurry.
As those who have them use them al
most exclusively in playing these ma
chines, it is very difficult to catch those
who pass the cheating nickels on the
devices. Nearly every night when the
earnings of the machines are counted up
some of the counterfeit pieces are found
in the receptacle.
The local officers are working on the
case, and they have a strong suspicion as
to where the counterfeiting is done.
Secret Service Agent Harris was in town
st-veral days ago, and it is believed that
his mission was to assist the local offi
cers in ferreting out the counterfeiting
gang.SOMETHING

HAVANA, Jan. 21.â Judging from
outward appearances quiet has been
etely restored in Havana, the ex
tra guards have all been withdrawn
and the greater part of the troops have
been sent back to the country. The
palace authorities confidently assert
that all danger is past, but for some
reason the anxiety here has not yet
allayed.
Everybody expects that something
us is going to happen and regrets
that the troops have been sent back
to the country. In the streets to-day I
saw an unusual number of volunteers
alone or in groups of two and three.
They were in full uniform, which la not
customary after the morning parade
of the palace guards, and they osten- |
tatiously displayed cartridge belts well
911 ed and with flaps raised.
But as yet there is not the slightest
sign of ill feeling against Americans.

NEW YORK, Jan. 21.â The Sun's Ha

AN INQUIRY INTO
THE KILLING OF
COLONEL RUIZ.
House Committee on Foreign Affairs Agrees
to Make a Favorable Report on the
Williams Resolution.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21.â The House
Committee on Foreign Affairs to-day
agreed to make a favorable report on
the resolution of "Williams of Missouri,
asking the State Department for infor
mation on the Ruiz case. The resolution
Is as follows:
"Resolved, that the Secretary of
State be directed, if in his opinion com
patible with the public interest, to send
to the House the reports made to the
department by Consul-General Lee,
and other reports made to the depart
ment by Consuls or commercial agents
of the United States on the subject of
the execution of Colonel Ruiz by the
an military authorities." .
There was no division over the reso
lution, and the vote was unaninrus in
favor of reporting it. Beyond this
thf-re was no reference to the Cuban
question except in the reference to the
subcommittee of the various Cuban res
olutions Introduced recently.
The Ruiz ref< m '1 to in the resolution
tfl not Dr. Kuiz. killed at a suburb of
Havana, whose case has attracted
much attention, but is Colonel Ruiz, the
Spanish officer at Havana, who is said
to have gone under a flag of truce to
meet the insurgents and urge them to
accept autonomy. After entering the
insurgent lines his proffer of auton
omy was rejected and he was executed
by order of the insurgent commander.
This case has not been taken up
In Congress before, and it is said that
the* inquiry will put the transaction in
a new light. Although several of the
members insisted that the Cuban topic
had not be^-n touched upon, except in
this resolution, others attached consid
erable significance to inquiries by one
of the Republican members. Smith of
Michigan, as to what the Cuba sub
committee had done in the Morgan
Senate resolution recognizing Cuban
belligerency. Adams, chairman of the
Cuban committee, explained that in
quiries w.tc being made of the State
Department with a view of taking such
i action as was appropriate. The line
of inquiry by Smith led to the impres
sion that he and some other Republi
can members of the committee desired
action on the belligerency subject.
Williams, author of the Ruiz reso
tlon. says the inquiry is for the pur
! pose of correcting a public misappre
hension as to the facts in the execu
tion of Colonel Ruiz. The latter, Wil
liams says, never had the right to
claim immunity under a flag of truce,
as he had been warned by the insur
gent commander, Aranguren, that he
: would be amenable to the decrees of
! the insurgent government, one of which
was that any person entering the in
surgent camp and proposing autonomy
should be treated as a spy. Williams
says there is authority for stating that
Colonel Ruiz entered Aranguren's camp
with this understanding, and took his
! chances accordingly. He said also that
he urged autonomy and suggested that
i specific benefits would be conferred up
j on the insLirsrent leaders if they ac
j cepted the reposition. One of Aran
'â  guren's associates demanded that he do
his duty in accordance with the de
crees of the insurgent government,
whereupon Ruiz was shot.

Special Di?patoh to The Call.
CHICAGO. Jan. 21.â 8y agreement be
tween the attorneys, the injunction suit
of the Inter Ocean Publishing Comptmy
against the Associated Press to prevent
the latter from discontinuing its news
service to the Inter Ocean was continued
yesterday in Judge Dunne's court. The
argument for the injunction was set for
Wednesday. February 2. The complain
ant obtained leave and filed amendments
to its bill. One amendment is the inser
tion of a paragraph siting up t h at tnp
defendant association has telegraph and
telephone lines in Illinois and other States
for the dissemination of news to patrons.
Another amendment alleges that the pub
lishers of the Chicago Tribune and Chi
cago Times- Herald obtain news in the
shape of cables and special dispatches
from corporations and persons other than
the Associated Press. The amendment al
leges that the Chicago Tribune has con
tracts with the Tribune, Journal, Times
and World of New York for the publica
tion of cable dispatches, while the Chi
cago Times-Herald has an arrangement
with the New York Herald to do tho s-imo
thing. It Is alleged that these contracts
prevent the complainants from procuring
cable news and special dispatches, es
pecially from the New York Sun Com
pany. Tho complainant finally declares
that an illegal by-law of the defendant
iisoriation prevents the complainant
from receiving news from the Sun, and if
enforced will prevent the complainant
from receiving cable news and special dis

WEBSTER WILL NOT BE
PROMOTED AT PRESENT.
Showing of His Bad Record Has Caused
the President to Withdraw His
Nomination for Paymaster.
NEW YORK. Jan. 21.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President Mc-
Kinley, in withdrawing the nomination
of Passed Assistants Paymasters Edwin
B. Webster and G. W. Simpson, to be pay
masters In the navy, acted on the sug
gestion in the cablegram received a few
days ago from Captain C M. Chester,
commanding the South Atlantic station,
in which that officer announced, I was
told to-day, that Webster had been found
morally unfit for promotion. Mr. Simp
son has already qualified for promotion
by examination, but of course his promo
tion cannot take place until Mr. Web
ster's case has been disposed of.
Webster was court-martialed at the
Asiatic station a few years ago on
charges growing out of his failure to re.
port his acount, and was sentenced to
three months' confinement to his ship and
to be reprimanded. I'pon his return to
Mare Island he was charged with having
failed to return a bond amounting to $2500
given him by a clerk whom he employed.
The court which tried him on these
charges found him guilty and sentenced
him to dismissal, but the department in
examining the record found that a great
deal of hearsay evidence had been ad
mitted and consequently disapproved the
findings and directed that Webster be re
stored to duty.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1898.
JUDGE McKENNA
IS CONFIRMED
BY THE SENATE
Allen of Nebraska Stands Alone in
Opposition to the Advance
ment of the Californian to
the Supreme Bench.
Mr. Justice McKenna is to-night receiving the congratulations of
his friends all over the country upon his confirmation as Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He was confirmed by
the Senate to-day, with only one dissenting vote against him. That
came from Senator Allen, the Populist from Nebraska, whose hand
seems to be against all men who do not believe in his peculiar doc
trines. His opposition to any proposition brought forward in the Sen
ate is generally regarded as the highest recommendation a measure
can receive, and the result Is usually against the person or thing Allen
advocates.
It has been contended all along in these dispatches that Judge
McKenna would be confirmed, and the result of to-day's vote is very
gratifying to him and to those who have faithfully and loyally sup
ported him in this contest.
It was understood that a vote would be taken on Judge McKenna's
nomination to-day, consequently there was a large attendance of Sen
ators. Allen Insisted upon reading to the empty seats and the dozing
officers, who could not escape from their posts of duty, the A. P. A.
and other protests against Judge McKenna, so fully considered by the
Judiciary Committee. Several attempts were made to check the Ne
braskan, but he persisted in talking, so the Senators retired to the
cloak room until he quit, when they returned to the chamber and pro
ceeded to confirm Judge McKenna without the formality of a roll
call. It was practically a unanimous vote, for Senator Allen alone
said "Nay" when the presiding officer put the question.
Mr. Justice McKenna will receive his commission at once and take
his seat on the Supreme Bench without delay. He has already pro
cured a black silk gown, such as is worn in the Supreme Court, and
all the preliminaries have been arranged to facilitate his immediate
entry upon his new Judicial duties. According to th'> custom of the
court, he takes his seat on the extreme left of Chief Justice Fuller on
the bench and in the consultation room. It nary for the junior
Associate Justice to cast the first vote in reaching a decision by the
court. A number of important cases are now in the court
awaiting a full bench, hence the confirmation Judge McKenna will
expedite action on these cases.
"LITTLE BOB'S"
LAST ROBBERY
Bully of Bisbee Shot to
Death by a Deputy
Sheriff.
Had Entered a Saloon and
Taken a Monte- Dealer's
Sack of Coin.
Followed From the Place by the
Officer and Slain While Mount-*

Specie! Dispatch to The Call.
BISBEE. Ariz., Jan. 21.â Robert Spar
ring, a cowboy, better known in this
vicinity as "Little Hob," has rounded
up his last bunch of range stock and
committed his last crime. Incidentally
he will never again make a tenderfoot
dance by speeding bullets in the direc
tion of the stranger's pedal extremi
ties. "Little Bob" was the bully of
Bisbee. and a desperado of the real
Western sort. His career came to a
sudden ending at an early hour this
morning, and to Deputy Sheriff < Ira
ham is given the credit for ridding the
Territory of this undesirable char.
Bob walked into the Turf saloon at
this place at 1:30 o'clock this morning.
There were a few stragglers in the re
sort, trying their luck at the monte
game that was running in one corner.
Sparring, drawing a revolver, stepped
up to J. Davison, the dealer, and
pointed the weapon toward him.
"Pack up the coin and hand it over,"
he ordered.
Davison lost no time in complying.
"Little Bob" had the drop, and the few
gamblers still in the saloon did n<sf at
tempt to draw. Sparring took the
safk of cash, about $600 In all, backed
out of the place and then ran for his
horse, which stood about 100 feet dis
tant.
One of the inmates of the Turf was
Deputy Sheriff Graham. When "Little
Bob" left the place Graham started in
pursuit. He overtook the desperado
just as the latter was about to mount
hiÂ« horse.
"Halt!" shouted the officer.
By way of reply. Sparring reached fnr
his revolver. There wtm a report, but
it did not come from the robber's wen
pon. Graham had fired first, and the
desperado fell, shot through the heart.
The money was returned to the
monte dealer, and the game went on
undisturbed for the balance of the
night. "

Primnry Election Law One of the
Princ.pa! Topics to Heceivs
Attention.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VISALIA. Jan. 21.â Hon. William H.
Alford, chairman of the Democratic
PtatÂ»- Central Committee, was Inter
viewed to-day by The Call correspond
ent concerning the coming meeting of
the committee. When ask>d as to the
purpose* of md the business to be
transacted at the mooting of the com
mittee on January :.'!>. he said:
"There will be a number of things
to do. In the first place the new law
governing primary elections will be
considered. This law is somewhat
complex, and the machinery it pro
vides is very cumbersome. But if it is
upheld by the fc'upr. me Courtâ and the
probabilities are that it will beâ it must
be applied in every voting precinct in
this State. There are many things in
connection with its application that
must be considered by the committee.
For instance, the matter of preparing
and distributing circulars of instruc
tion and the manner of providing the
ballots required Rt th^ primaries, are
among the many problems presented by
the new lav.
"The time and place of holding the
next State convention will be consid
ered and probably decided. Some ques
tions of party policy preliminary to
the opening of the next campaign will
be presented.
"This is earlier thnn State commit
tees generally meet, bat the conditions
are peculiar and I consider early action
important, as we do not propose to
leave anything undone that can be
done by the committee to further the
interests of Democracy and the prin
ciples of the Chicago platform between
now and the assembling of the next
State convention.
"You ask if the members of the com
mittee who did not pay their assess
ments will be expelled. I have no idea
what the disposition of the committee
will be upon that subject, and, there
fore, will not presume to say. I will
say. however, that this question Is not
a serious one; that It can and will be
settled without causing the 'disturb
ance' in the party so much hoped for
by our opponents. There can be no
question, however, of the power of the
State Committee to expel a member
and to fill the vacancy caused by such
expulsion. That power is inherent from
a parliamentary standpoint in every
such body. To deprive it of this
power would be to deprive It of the
power to govern itself. I presume it
will not be disputed that the conven
tion which elected the State Central
Committee had the power to remove
any member at pleasure. It follows
upon the authority of an unbroken line
Of precedents that upon the adjourn
ment of the convention all power that it
possessed passed to the State Commit
tee, which is Its only representative.
"There is no disposition on the part
of the committee to Interfere in San
Francisco local politics. Individually
T should much regret the necessity of
such Interference. I have faith in the
Democratic principle of each commun
ity controlling its own affairs in party
management, as in all other matters.
I believe the new primary law will ob
viate the necessity for any interfer
ence."

CINCINNATI. Jan. 21.â The legisla
tive committee Investigating: the
charges of bribery In the recent elec
tion of a United States Senator at Co
lumbus held a session here to-night
and will continue Its sittings here to
morrow. All members of the committee
were present, together with quite a del
egation from Columbus and others
from different parts of the State. Three
members of the House committee on
the Otis investigation were present â
Rutan, Spellmyer and Kenny. Spell
myer and Kenny are Democrats, and
Rutan. chairman of the House commit
tee. Is one of the Republicans who
voted against Hanna. The other two
members of the House "onimittee. Box
well and Rankln, of Fayette, who voted
for Hanna were not present.
The committee was given quite a tel
ephone exhibition before it assembled.
The Great Southern Hotel at Colum
bus, which was the headquarters of the
anti-Hanna men during the recent con
test, was called up, and while the com
mittee was talking in the private office
of the Gibson House with parties in
Columbus, Jerry Bliss and his steno
grapher were at the telephone down
stairs in the hotel office, taking off all
that was said. This was done to show
how all of the conversations of Boyce
with certain parties in Columbus was
taken down while Boyce was here and
the Senatorial contest was going on at
the State capital. It is alleged that all
of the conversations were taken down
and are a matter of record without any
wire-tapping, as the different tele
phones in the Gibson House are all on
th.^ same circuit.
Horace B. Dunbar, proprietor and
manager of the Gibson House, was the
only witness examined to-night. The
rierkfl and others at the hotel will be
examined to-morrow. Mr. Dunbar pro
duced his hotel register, showing that
Henry H. Boyce of New York occupied
room 226 from January 6 to January 10.
Mr. Dunbar testified to having his sus
picions aroused and set the clerks to
watching Boyce.
Allen O. Meyers Jr., one of the day
clerks, arranged for a stenographer's
report of the conversations Boyce
hail over the telephone during the
fey. Russell Pryor, the night clerk,
tcÂ»>k down the conversations at night.
Hoy re was given the key to the pri
vate office on the second floor when
ever he wanted it, and the arrange
ments down stairs were always com
plete for reports of whatever went
over the telephone wires when Boyce
was using the private office. The
stenographer, who has a desk in the
office, was called Into requisition
whenever Boyce called any one up.
Mr. Dunbar recited many of these
conversations over the long distance
phone. In one" of them the major was
called up at Columbus and said:
"Shane and the President will ar
range things on Saturday." Boyce re
plied: "Have seen one of the party.
Wants money. How can I handle
him?"
The reply from Columbus was:
"Suppose O betrays you, what then?"
Mr. Dunbar said that Boyce repli
ed: "No danger. I would kill him.
Dead men tell no tales."
Mr. Dunbar testified that Allen O.
Ifeyen Jr., who was in Columbus as
one of the managers against Hanna,
was called upon Friday, January 7, by
Jerry Bliss, and told of the situation
here and what Boyce was doing. Mey
ers advised Bliss that a man named
Hollenbeek would leave Columbus for
Cincinnati that night with money and
to have him watched. The next morn
ing the Miller Detective Agency was
employed to watch Boyce and keep
track of Hollenbeck on his arrival. On
January 8. H. H. Hollenbeck of Char
don, Ohio, registered at the Gibson
first. He had a room assigned to
him, taut was seen to communicate with
Boyce. The next name on the regis
ter to that of Hollenbeck was E. H.
Archer. Columbus, Ohio, Deputy Rail
road Commissioner.
Mr. Dunhar showed the registers to
the committee with all those names
and stated that Mr. T. J. Mulvlhill,
one of the leading Democratic mana
gers of this city, pointed Hollenbeck
out to the detectives. They watched
all the movements of Hollenbeck and
traced him to the Union Trust and
Pavings Bank, of which J. G. Schmidt
lapp was president. He was then
traced to the different places of meet-
Ing: as charged by Representative
Otis.
While Hollenbeck did not remain In
Cincinnati. Boyce was here on Friday.
Saturday, Sunday and Monday. At the
suggestion of Jerry Bliss. Mr. Dunbar
had the housekeeper and chambermaids
watch the movements around room 226.
On Sunday night Boyce told Dunbar he
had been here representing the Presi
dent and complained about detectives
being put onto him and about others
watching him, and especially about the

LONDON. Jan. 21.â The St. James

saying that a fleet of nine Japanese

of a week for Chinese waters, says:
"Japan is prepared for war. That
in a nutshell is the news from Yoko
hama to-day, and it is really the first
news from Japan since the beginning
of the Chinese crisis. It was obvious
that the Japanese Government had
stopped telegraphic communication,
which it never does except when mo
bilizing the army or navy. That is
preceisely what it has been doing. It
is understood that the destination of
the fleet is Wei-Hai-Wei, and there
is no doubt the movement means that
the status quo in China, so far as Man
churia and Korea are concerned, shall
not be altered by Russia, nor any com
bination of Russia's allies in defiance
of Great Britain and Japan. So long
as the defenders' policy is equality of:

MR. SHORTRIDGE ON THE
ROAD TO RECOVERY.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 21.â Dr. J. R. Curnow,
the family physician of C M. Shortridge
and who has been attending the sick man
at Gllroy Hot Springs. Is In the city, and
gives the first intelligent statement com
ing from the bedside.
"I believe," said the doctor, "that Mr.
Shortridge will recover, unless there
should arise some unforeseen complica
tions. There have been many foolish re
ports in circulation. In the first place.
Mr. Shortrldpe has no Bright's disease
and no heart trouble. He is simply In a
condition of extreme nervous prostration,
with slight symptoms of typhoid fever.
"While he has been and is a very sick
man, there Is in my mind nothing to war
rant a belief that he will not fully re
cover. The prostration is so complete
that I can say Mr. Shortridge has been
very close to tl*e errave. but I am more
than hopeful of his recovery."
This report, coming from an official
source, must set at rest the flying rumors
of other nature.
Reports from Gilroy Hot Springs this
evening state that Charles M. Short
ridgr's condition is more favorable than
it ha? been for a week. There has been
a steady improvement for the past
thirty-six hours. His temperature Is
normal and his pulse is regular. His
physician now entertains strong hopes of
his recovery.

Washington. Jan. 21.
There was a preliminary struggle
in the House to-day over the bill t'<>r
the relief of the book publishing com
pany of the Methodist Episcopal
church South, which was before the
House last Friday. 'By shrewd ma
neuvering its opponents succeeded in
preventing action to-day. Previous to
the consideration of this bill the
House passed the bill to extend the
public land laws of the United States
to the Territory of Alaska and to
grant a general railroad right of way
through the Territory. The urgent
deficiency bill was sent to conference
after the stiver forces, with some out
side aid, had succeeded in concurring
In the Senate amendments striking
from the bill the provision requiring
the depositors of bullion at Govern
ment assay offices to pay the cost of
transportation to the mints.
At the opening of the session a bill was
put<s<>d to grant the Commissioners of
tale County. Ala., the right to construct
two bridges across the Choctaw-Hatchie
River. Under the rules this was "private
bill day," but Cannon, chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, antago
nized with a motion for the consideration
of the Senate amendment? to the urgent
deficiency appropriation bill. His motion
whb carriedâ l2s to SI.
The Senate Nicaragunn Canal Commis
sion amendment was non-concurred in.
One of the Senate amendments was rnn
curri'd In with an amendment to appro
priate $1.T,n00 for the repair of the Na
tional Cemetery at Fort Smith. Ark. This
â¢was offered by Little <D.) of Arkansas,
who explained the necessity for it. ow
ing to the devastation by the recent
st' Tin in that section.
The main fight came on the Senate
amendment striking out the provisions in
the bill requiring depositors of bullion
hereafter to pay the cost of transporta
tion from the assay omef to the mints.
The debate soon shifted into a dismis
sion of the silver question, as it did on
former occasions. Rhafroth (Pop.') of
Colorado, Newlands (Sil. R.) of Nevada.
Cannon (R.t of Illinois and Eland (D. > o/
Missouri participated. Cannon fl
submitted a modified proposition provid
ing that the depositor of bullion should
pay the cost of the transportation to the
"nearest mint." It was defeatedâ 9B to
130.
The Senate amendment to strike out
the whole provision was then agreed to
without division in the committee of the
whole. Cannon gave m tlee he would de
mand the aye an no vote In tho House.
The vote of the committee was confirmed
on an aye and no vote in the Hou^
to li:?. The bill was sent back to confer
ence.
The vote was considered significant, as
there was to n certain extent an align
ment of the silver forces in favor of the
motion to concur in the Senate amend
ment. The following Republicans Joined

to sit down.
"Uring me a warrant." said the judpe.
"I want this man rearrested as an acces
sary to the murder after the fact, and I
want him indicted by the Grand Jury to-
d:iy."
This had the effect of cooling Smith's
spirits, but be Boon recovered and looked
with pity on his fellow prisoner.
"Chris, old boy, I'm sorry for you." he
said as he held out his hand to Merry.
"Cheer up. Maybe things won't be so
bad after all. Congratulate me, anyway,
on my end of it."
But Merry was in a daze, and though
holding out his hand remained silent.
Merry was found guilty on the first bal
lot. In Smith's case the ballot stood six
for conviction and six against until to
day. Then, with the understanding, it is
thought, that there would be no legal dif
ficulties in the way of Smith's rearrest
and indictment as an accessory after the
fact, it was agreed to return a verdict of
not guilty as charged.
EMBASSADOR WHITE NOT
TREATED DISCOURTEOUSLY.
Reports Concerning His Reception by Em
peror William Due to the Publication
of a Belated Court Circular. â¢
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21.â Embassador
White cabled the following to the Secre
tary of State:
"The statement in the morning papers
that Mrs. White and myself have been
treated discourteously is absolutely and
entirely without foundation. The Em-,
peror and all others have been most kind
to us. I have never needed to call the
attention of any person to any slight
whatever. The notice regarding my re
ception was Identical with that always
i after the presentation of an Em-
Kissa.ior from any great power to the
Emperor."
The cablegram has reference to pub
lished reports that Bmbaasador and Mrs.
White had been Ignored and not given
tho attention and oourtesy due his rank
by high officials of the German court, and
that it had been necessary to admonish
the offending officials by a notice in the
court circular of Germany. It appears
from the cablegrams that the court
circular's notice which gave rise to the
published report is Pimply a belated no
tice, such as is always Issued after a pre
lion of an Embasador to the Em
peror.

Washington. Jan. 21.
An agreement was reached by the
Senate to-day that a final vote on the
Teller resolution providing that the
bonds of the United States may be
paid in silver dollars and all pending
amendments thereto would be taken
next Thursday before adjournment.
Vest of Missouri, in charge of the
resolution, first announced that an
agreement had been made for the final
vote on Wednesday at 4 p. m., but
readily agreed to a postponement un
til Thursday at the suggestion of Tur
pie of Indiana. Allison of lowa made
the significant statement that an
amendment to the resolution that
would cause some debate would be of
fered later in the discussion, but gave
no information of the nature, scope or
Intent of the amendment. During the
greater part of the afternoon the Se
nate was in executive session.
At the opening of the session Quay of
Pennsylvania said he had noticed in the
morning: paper* that he hail voted yes
terday for the consideration of the Teller
resolution because the Senator from Mis
souri (.Vest) had asked him to do bo.
This. Quay said, was not true in any
sense, as he had not conferred with the
Missouri Senator about it. He had voted
as he had. said he, because he thought
the present consideration of the resolu
tion would benefit the country and the
Republican party.
Allen? resolution, asking the Secretary
of the Interior for papers concerning the
dismissal from the Pension Office of Mrs.
M. E. Roberts, was laid before the Sen
ate, ami UnllinKer moved to refer the
resolution to the Committee on Civil
Service and Retrenchment.
Pending the vote on that motion Allen
said he desired to speak briefly upon the
matter. Mrs. Roberts, he had learned.
was a friend of the former Secretary,
Carlisle, from Covlngton, Ky. She was
for years a member of the family of
James B. Breck, once Senator from Ken
tucky, and her appointment was made
through Senator Breck's influence.
"I want to say," said Allen, "that no
self-respecting gentleman would treat a
woman as this woman has been treated
by the Secretary of the Interior and Com
missioner of Pensions. If this administra
tion is willing to Injure itself In this way
I am willing. If it desires to hurry itself
out of power I am desirous of hastening
its exit. But I hold, Mr. President, that
ft is not an inherent right of the Secre
tary of the Interior, or of the Commis
sioner of Pensions, to be brutal in their
treatment of clerks. If the Commissioner
desires the place of Mrs. Robers for some
hanger-on, why did he aim a poisoned
dart at her? He must be a coward, in
deed, who will make a covert charge
against a woman and refuse then to
state the charges."
Allen, having referred to the position
taken by Gallinger. the New Hampshire
Senator, said: "If the Senator from Ne
braska means seriously to impute to me
such motives as his language indicates
he is using unparliamentary and unwar
ranted language."
Gallinger further said he had learned
something about the Roberts case and he
was satisfied that the Senate was not
the place for the discussion of the detail*.
In the privacy of the committee-room
the statements of Mrs. Rober f s, tho S>c
retary of the Interior, the Commissioner
of Pensions and others could be iiea:d
upon the case. There It could be properly
discussed and Investigated. Such cases as
this have no place in the Senate cham
ber, and it may be possible that it will
be the part of gallantry to consider this
case in private, and in the end Gallinger
thought Mrs. Roberts would thank him
for the position he had taken in the mat
ter.
Allen contended that there was a hint
of something vitally wrong In the moral
character of Mrs. Roberts. He reviewed
tht- ease again and discussed at some
length its application to the present agi
tation nn the civil service question.
Assurance was given by Pritchard of
North Carolina, chairman of the Commit
tee on Civil Service and Retrenchment,
that the committee would carefully in
vestigate the case should it be referred
to his committee, and Allen agreed to
such reference. The question was then
so referred.
Lodge of Massachusetts, somewhat to
the surprise of the people In the galler
ies, who expected a discussion of the
Toller resolution, moved that the Senate
go into executive session.
"Before the motion is put. Mr. Presi
dent." said Vest of Missouri. "1 desire to
make a brief statement. I pave notice
yesterday that the resolution reported by
the Finance Committee would be further
considered t"-day. but several Senators
opposed to the resolution have said to me.
that their jx'rsonaJ preference requires
that the resolution shall not be pressed
at this time. They have suggested to me
that we permit It to fro over until next
Tuesday and that it be taken up at the
eonclusi of the morning business on
that day for discussion, and that a vote
upon it and upon any amendments that
may be offered thereto be taken after
next Wednesday. I wish to say this ar
rangement is agreeable to me. and so far
as 1 know, satisfactory to my colleagues
on this side of the chamber."
Stewart of Nevada said he would like to
make,some remarks on the pending reso
lution and would do so to-morrow if the
Senate %-hf in session.
Turpio of Indiana proposed that. In
stead of taking the final vote Wednesday
it be taken on Thursday before adjourn
ment, and this proposition WM agreed to.
Perkins of California anounced that, at
the conclusion of the morning business
Monday ho would call up the pension ap
propriation bill. *
T'pon Lodge's motion the Senate then
at 1Â» p. m.. went into executive session
The Senate agreed to vote on the Tel
ler resolution next Thursday before ad

At 4:45 the Senate adjourned.

ous Hillmon Insurance rase, which has
been fought through five trials, was
settled to-day en far as the claim
against the New York Life Insurance
Company Is concerned. Hillmon was
insured in thlH company for $10,000, but
upon what basis the compromise was
made cannot be ascertained as the at
torneys on both Bides absolutely refuse
to talk. One report has It that Mrs.
Hillmon receives the full amount of
her claim, $10,000, and interest amount
ing to $11,000.
When Insurance Commissioner Webb
McNall was apprised of the New York
Life's action in settling the Hillmon
claim this afternoon, he promptly
granted its attorneys a license for the
year almost past and ending Febru
ary, 1898, and also for the next license
year. This McXall said to-night ren
ders valid any business the company
might have done In the past year with
out a license. It was the refusal to
settle the Hillmon claims upon which
Insurance Commissioner McNall based
his action in revoking the licenses of
the interested companies last March.
The Mutual Life was one of these and
is at present barred from the State by
a Judgment cf ouster from the Supreme
Court The Connecticut Mutual is
abiding by McNall's action in revok
ing its license, and has made no fight.
The New York Life brought suit
against McNall for damages. Later
the suit was dropped suddenly. The
charge has been made that this com
pany has been soliciting: business in
this State without a license, and/a quo
warranto proceeding is pending in the
Supreme Court, brought by the Attor
ney-General, to compel the company to
â how why it Is transacting business
without a license. Attorney-General
Boyle refused tor say whether or not
this case will be dropped; indeed, the
action of the Insurance Commissioner
in granting a license for the year past
makes it uncertain whether or not the
case may property be tried.
John W. Hillrrion, who is supposed to
have been shot through the head at
Medietne Lodge March 17, 1579, had life
insurance as follows: NVw York Life,
$10,000; Mutual Life, $10.oon. and in the
Connecticut Mutual, $5000. It was
claimed that Hillmon was accidentally
shut by his traveling companion, John
H. Brown. The insurance companies
claimed that a conspiracy was formed,
consisting of Levi Baldwin, John \v.
Hillmon and John H. Brown, and that
Hillmon's life was insured, and that
Frederick Adolphus Walters was mur
dered by Hillmon and his body at
tempted to be palmed off on the com
panies as HiHmon's. The case has
been tried five times. The first trial
was at Leavenworth, June, 18S2. The
Jury failed t<". agree, seven being for
the plaintiff and five for the defendant.
The second trial was at Leavenworth
in June. is*s. The Jury again failed
to agree, the vote standing 6 to 6. The
third trial was at Topeka, resulting in
a verdict for th>> plaintiff. The cap.'
went to the Supreme Court, where the
Judgment of the lower court was re
versed. The next tfial was before
Judge Thomas of North Dakota, and
eleven Jurymen stood out for Mr 3.
Hillmon. A fifth trial was held before
Judge Williams, the jury standing 5
to 7 in favor of Mrs. Hillmon.
The sixth trial has lÂ»een set for Feb
ruary 14, 189 S. and will yet he tried un
loss the Mutual I,ife and Connecticut
Mutual follow the example set by the
X.\v York L ffe to-day, and compro
mise the claims.
The document filed at a late hour
to-nipht with Georpe F. Sharritt. clerk
of the Feder.il Court, by Mrs. Hlll
mon's attorney, C. F. Hutching, la not
a dismissal of the case, although the
lawyers declare that that is practically
what it amounts to. it simply trans
fers Mrs. Hillmon's right and title to
the claim to one James F. Lord, who. It
is understood, Is a director of the com
pany.
Judpe Foster is not i" the city and
the attorneys say that the papers filed
to-day put the case in proper form for
dismissal when hf> arrives.
ECUADOR THREATENED
WITH AN INVASION.
Copvrl<rht. IS9Â«. by J.invÂ»s Oor<3nn Bennett.
PANAMA, Jan. il.â received to-day
this dispatch from President Elroy Alfaro
Of Ecuador, under Quito date:
"To the Editor .of tho Herald: Our
enemies are endenvoiinp to Invade our
country from the south, but they fear the
Government of Pern, which has promised
this country to prevent any violation of
the neutrality law.
"ELROY ALFAPO, President."
Advices by wire from the Hcrald'B cor
respondent In Guayaquil state that
Ecuador Is seriously threatened with a
revolution acalnst President Alfaro. A
larp*Â» armed body, headed by exiled chiefs
of the clerical and conservative parties
now In Peru, have gathered at the fron
tier, and v.ill attempt to invade the Ecua
dorean province of I,oja. Both Ecuador
and Peru are putting forth every effort
to prevent the threatened invasion.
The Wasp This Week-
With each week's Issue The "Wasp
gives more evidence of the correctness of
Its claim of being "the leading illustrated
weekly Journal on the Pacific Coast." '
This week's issue of The Wasp is not I
only Inviting: typographically but Inter
esting and up to date in literary and pic
torial features. The personage addressed
in Plain Talks to Public Characters 1b
Attorney Phiibrook and that gentle
man's conduct Is breezily questioned.
The Salvation Army and other organ
ized religious bodies following in their
wake are written about In the "Under
the X Ray" column. The latest society
sensation and other things transpiring in
the smart set are entertainingly, treated j
in The Wasp's "Personalities." In the
Financial, the Books and Authors, the
Old Maid's Diary and the Round and
About column is handled many timely
topic?. The half-tones are numerous and !
are an attractive feature of The Wasp. ;
Of the cartoons the one suggesting a
"Happy Family" cage for the zoo, with
Supervisors Britt and Clinton for ; cen
tral figures-., is particularly clever. Presi
dent Dole's reception without the usual i
salute and Germany's acceptance of a I
useless Chinese port from the Mongolian I
"gold brick" operator are also well cxc- ;
cut-ed and laughable.
BRINGS MINERS

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 21.â The
steamer City of Seattle arrived to

miners of Dawson to Ottawa to inter
view Premier Laurier and other mem

CONTEST OF CREED ES WILL.
Evidence Concerning the Agreement of Sep-
aration Has All Been Taken.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 21.â A1l of the evi
dence on the first branch of the Creede
caseâ the question as to the validity of
the agreement of separation and settle
ment, often referred to as the $20,000 con
tract â was concluded to-day. The attor
neys will begin their arguments next
Tuesday.
It is quite probable that Judge Clark
will not render his decision on the branch
of the case just tried until after he has
heard the evidence in regard to the other
more important proposition, which, the
contestants will try to prove, is that the
will itself is a forged instrument.
FORTUNE FOR MRS. YOUNG.
Decree of Divorce Against a Dead Man Va-
cated by the Court.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 21.â Judge Van
Dyke has granted a motion to vacate a
decree of divorce in the now somewhat
celebrated Young case.
The plaintiff, William Young, sued for
a divorce. A decree was granted verl\\y.
but before the papers could be signed
Young died. However, Judge Van Dyke
signed the decree on stipulation of theat
torneys, although he declared the suit
abated by Young's death.
Shortly afterward Young's uncle. Jo
seph MeCullagh. the St. Louis editor,
died, leaving a very large estate. By
Judge Van Dyke's decision Young's
widow is now entitled to her share of
about $75,000.
Vacaville' & Macadamized Road.
VACAVILLE. Jan. 21.â The good road
movement is something more than talk
in Vacaville township. The project of
macadamizing the main highway is being
realized. The first section, about half a
mile in length, laid two years ago. has
just been completed across the valley for
two miles. N'.xt season it will be run
south to town and connect with a mac
adamized road built by the town of Vaca-
Vtlle.
Dinghy Tariff Felt Abroad.
ROME. Jan. 21.â The action of the Ding
ley tariff has caused a crisis in the orange
and lemon trade in the southern province
of the peninsula and in Sicily. In many
places prices are so low that fruit does
not pay for the plucking.

FOR THE BIG PARADE
OVER 1400 school children drilled on
the southern end of Van Ness
avenue yesterday morning- to pre
pare themselves for the big parade
on Monday.
There were twenty companies
present, six of which were formed of
girls, and all the line and field officers
of the regiment were chosen from the
school children themselves. The schools
represented were the Horace Mann,
James I. irk. Everett, Mission, Hamilton,
Franklin, Pacific Heights, Crocker, Lin
coln, "Washington and John Swett. Each
of the six schools first named sent a com
pany of girls as well as one of boys.
The regiment was under the command
of Professor George S. MJehllng, Instruc
tor In physical exercise in the schools
named. He formed his line at half-past
9 with the first companies to arrive, and
then, as the others came up, they were
added until the column grew to imposing
length. Evolutions in columns of fours
and of platoons, the wheels and the flank
marches, the dresses and regimental and
battalion formations were all gone
through with, and about 11 o'clock the
column was broken and the children were
Bent back to their schools.
The parade was mainly for the pur
pose of teaching the majors of the vari
ous battalions then J titles, and to teach
the children in thr tanks the' necessity
of listening for orders from their immedi
ate commanders and from no one else.
The companies had already become famil
iar with the details of the various evolu
tions through their drills at their own
schools, and so they readily learned what
was wanted of them yesterday. Before
the regiment dispersed Mlehling presented
to each company the banner which it will
carry in the parade.
The officers of the regiment are as fol

a House.
One Room Completely Wrecked
and the Occupants Badly
Frightened.
THE MOTIVE NOT KNOWN.
Police Hard at Work on the CasÂ« and
Hopeful of Apprehending the
Perpetrator-
The usual custom among the China
men of burying the hatchet at New
Tears' time and being at peace with all
men, was broken this year by an al
most successful attempt to blow up a
house located at 27 Washington al
ley yesterday morning. A little before
t o'clock officers Peters and Fred
Smith, who were on duty in China
town to prevent the shooting of fire
crackers, heard a lively fusilade in the
direction of Fisk alley, and this was
followed immediately by a loud explo
sion. The police hurried toward the
place where they had heard the noise,
but were unable to locate any trouble,
a.nd thought that some ardent wor
jhiper of his joss had exploded a bomb.
Later in the morning Sergeant Shea
Df the Chinatown squad was informed
by Chin Bin, the proprietor of the
house, that an attempt had been made
to blow up his place. Bhea went to
the house and found that some explo
sives had been placed under a door on
the first landing of the stairs and that
the second floor of the house had been
very badly wrecked. The stairway was
broken, the door torn from the wall,
one side of the partition badly shat
tered and the other completely blown
to pieces. Seven men were sleeping In
the room wrecked by the explosion and
were somewhat bruised by the falling
timbers. In the third story, which was
occupied by women, a bed was broken
and glass in the windows shattered.
Detectives Gibson, Wren and Cap
tain Bohen were put on the case to
help Sergeant Shea, but up to a late
hour had been unable to discover the
miscreant or the motive. A oareful ex
amination of the premises failed to re
veal any traces of a bomb, and the po
lice have come to the conclusion that
it must have been dynamite, but that
It must have been a rather small stick

CALL TO MINERS.
To the Miners of California :
The miners of California have
been assigned a separate division
in the grand parade of the Golden
JuHlee on Monday, January 24.
This division will be headed by
the Calaveras County Miners'
Jubilee band of twenrv-five pieces
and promises to be an important
feature of the patade.
To the miners of California isdne
the credit o c hiving added to the
wealth of the United States a pro
duction of gold amounting; to over
thirteen hundred millions of dol
lars, and they should show by their
numerical strength in the p.ir.icle
the importance of the industry they
represent.
I, theretor?, respectfully call
upon and urge all miner? and all
those interested In the mining In
dustry to join our ranks in the
pande on Monday next.
It is fmportant that ail report at
the California Miners' Association
headquarters, in the m.irbie room at
the Palace Hotel, Saturday or Sun
day, in order that they may be
properly assigned. Those unable
to report at headquarters will
kindly assemble at the Palace
Hotel Monday morning at 9:30.
Yours respectfully,
J. H. NEFF,
President California Miners's As
sociation.

or the building would have been blown
to pieces.
Quong Lee, the owner of the building,
and Chin TSin, the occupant, both deny
that they have any enemies nn<l claim
j they know no reason for the attempt to
Injure them. TJv-ir statement is to
be taken -with a grain of salt, however,
as in like cases Chinamen "no sahc
nothing." Chin Rin said he had pe.n
{ a man hanging around the door during
j the evening, and that the fellow had
| gone up the stairs a couple of times, but
!as the house was of 111 repute he
1 nought nothing of it. He could give
|no description of the man. ThÂ» police
| have two or three theories of the mo
tive; one is that some one in the house
owed the dynamiter money and failed
to square his accounts as all good Mon
golians do at the end of the year. Cap
tain Bohen believes that It was the
work of a highbinder who had wanted
money on which to celebrate and who,
upon being refused, took his revenge.
There are a number of Chinamen
from out of town here for the holidays.
The fact that dynamite or giant powder
was used leads to the belief that some
one from the powder works is the
guilty party, and the officers are hope
ful of his apprehension.
WON THE SPRECKELS CUP.
Trje Luriines Easily Defeat "the
port Masons at Water Polo.
The third match for the Spreekels
challenge cup between the Fort Mason
T'"lo Team and the L<urline Swimming
Club took place last evening- at the Lur
line baths, in the presence of a large
number of spectators. The L,urllne boys
found the soldiers e.asy victims, and they
won with hands down by the score of
S to 2.
But for overconftdence upon the part of |
Goalkeeper Wldeman the Fort Mason j
club would have been shut out. In the
first half he permitted Smith to catch j
him off his guard and an easy goal was
the result. In the second half Straus 1
throw for a goal was a scratch, pure and |
simple, as he hardly realized that he had :
the ball. It came to him on a long, j
chance throw when he was not expecting i
It, and before Wideman saw where. it was i

posts. The Lurlines clearly outclassed
the Fort Masons at every point of the
game, and in their team work they were
especially superior to their opponents.
Brewer and Geddea were the bright stars
of the Luriines, while for the Fort Ma
fi! n i? lv . b Smitn and Captain Bailey did
the best work.
The polo Kama was preceded by a 50- i
yard dash between Clyde .Hathorne and
h. .A. \\ideman, which was won by the
latter in the remarkably fast time of
24 4-5 seconds. This was followed by a re- !

FREEHOLDERS
WERE IN ERROR
Adopted a Misleading Section
Concerning Super
visors.
They Unintentionally De(Â»rÂ«aÂ«ed the
Boar*! Instead of Increas
ing It.
The freeholders who are to frame a
new code of laws for the government of
the municipality discovered last night
that they had made a bad mistake In
hurriedly passing the first portion of the
report of the legislative committee. The
legislative body of the city and county
under the charter being frumed will con
sist of a board of eighteen Supervisors,
who shall be elected by general ticketâ
or at least it was the Intention of the
lawmakers to make such provision. Af
ter providing that there shall be eighteen
Supervisors, to serve for two years, the
committee recommended that "the board
as first constituted by this charter shall
so divide Itself by lot that nine members
of said board shall go out of office at the
expiration of the first year and the other
nine members at the expiration of the
second year, and thereafter nine mem
ber .shall be elected annually to said
board."
The committee report was unanimously
adopted Wednesday nipht, and it was not
until last night that any of the freehold
ers discovered the mistake. Under the
section as adopted eighteen Supervisors
would be elected at firstâ nine to go out
at the end of the first year and the re
maining nine at the end of the second
year, and thereafter nine members would
be elected annually. While it was the in
tention of the committee to provide for a
board of eighteen Supervisors, the law
as suggested would only provide for a
board of eighteen members for the first
>t,ir after the adoption of the charter
and nine members from then on.
When the mistake was called to the
attention of t li >â¢ freeholders by Joseph
O'Connor the adoption of the section was
revoked and the provision referred back
to the legislative committee to amend.
The remainder of the session was de
voted to a general discussion of the
powers to be vested in the Supervisors
The j?r*at and troublesome point was
concerning the imposition of license taxes
Several of the members believed that
the charter should specify on what occu
pations, businesses or professions license
taxes should be Imposed. After a long and
tiresome argument it was finally decided
to vest in the Supervisors the power "to
lay, levy and impose and to provide for
the collection of license taxes."
It was also decided to incorporate a sec
tion in the proposed laws providing that
every ordinance for the granting of
franchises for the supply of light or
water, or for the purchase of lands for
municipal purposes at a cost to exceed
$10,000, must be first submitted to the vote
of the electors.
The board will meet again next Tues
day night.
The steam schooner North Fork, which left here last Sunday, had a hard time of it entering Humboldt
Bay. While on the bar she was pooped by three seas in succession and a considerable amount of
damage was done. Three doors were torn f rcrn staterooms and the passengers had to seek safety
in the social hall.

The steam schooner North Fork had '
a narrow escape on the Eureka bar last
Monday. She left here early Sunday
morning and had a rough time of It
all the way up the coast. Crossing
in at Eureka three heavy seas swept
her, one after the other, and several
of the passengers thought she was go
ing down. The railing was torn from
the upper deck, stairs carried away,
stateroom doors broken In, staterooms
flooded to a depth of two feet and the
smoking-room gutted. A private let
ter received yesterday says the doors
were torn off staterooms 6, 8 and 10
and the occupants drowned out. The
peas swept almost over the pilot-house
and the whole steamer was almost un
der water. She rose out of the trough
of the sea like a bird, only to be buried
again and again until the passengers
gave up hope and began to say their
prayers. It was all over In half an
hour, and when everybody was safely
on terra flrma they began to laugh at
their fears. The North Fork will be
due back here to-day.
There was another rush of Klondlk
ers by the Umatilla yesterday. They
were down to the steamer bright and
early and seemed on pins and needles
until the starting hour came. On ar
riving at Seattle they will be trans
ferred to the steamer City of Topeka
j and will go to Dyea and Skaguay on
that vessel. Hundreds of people were
down to see the adventurers off, and
many a man among the crowd on the
steamer's decks left a wife on the
wharf weeping over his departure.
Every gold-seeker is "burning with
high hope," but the chances are that
very many of them will be back before
the year is out with their hopes shat
tered. Among those who left an the
Fmatilla were J. B. Sprague, J. C. Da

be*Â»n 111 for several weeks, and is now
suffering from a relapfle. A few days ago
he showed marked improvement, and his

able to Join in the, celebration. When he
became convalescent he found many mat

and disregarding the injunctions of his
physicians he attempted to attend to
them. The result was that he overtaxed
his strength and will be again forced to

THOMPSON'S STRANGE TALE.
Thomas Thompson, secretary of the
Thompson Bridge Company, was not held
up, n.B he claimed, but lost his money
playing poker.
Last Thursday Thompson visited police
headquarters and told a sensational story
of being held up on Montgomery and Mar
ket streets and robbed of a gold watch
and chain and $5o in cash. The detective
who was detailed to make an investiga
tion last night reported that Thompson
lost his money playing poker in a saloon
on Montgomery street. He believes that
Thompson, in order to "square himself"
with his wife, concocted the story of be
ing held up and robbed.

ONLY fiNOTMER YELLOW TRICK-
AS shown on another page in this issue the Ex
aminer lias been caught at one of its character
istic tricks. It announced that for a special edi
tion it had secured certain pictures which had never
been published. For the purpose of convincing it that
its error is known The Call this morning presents
the pictures in question, crediting them duly to the
Placerville Mountain Democrat, from which they
were taken. When an interior paper has the enter
prise to collect pictures and at considerable expense
have them prepared for artistic presentation the busi
ness of stealing them is not of a high order. It is, in
fact, of just the order to tempt the Examiner. To be
tempted, with the .yellow journal, is to fall. It can
have the consolation of knowing that it is incapable
of falling far.
The Mountain Democrat is to be congratulated
both for its enterprise and the fact that it had the
boldness not to submit to being looted without pro
test. To assist this protest in reaching the readers of
papers is but a simple duty which is here undertaken,
not gladly, but without shrinking.
While the pictures as they appear this morning are
properly credited to the Placerville journal, owing
to the merest inadvertence the same cannot be said
of an article on James Marshall immediately following
the introduction. This was taken from the same
source as the pictures.
To the lesson here involved, to the improvement it
may possibly produce, to the implied advice, yellow
journalism is entirely welcome.
LESSONS OF THE LOS ANGELES FIRE.
IN the revelation made by the burning of a public
schoolhouse on Pico Heights, Los Angeles, the
question of the value of betterments to the city
water property by the private corporation lessee gets
a lurid illumination. The insut'ticiency of pressure in
small and worn pipes came near causing an appalling
loss of life and did cause a loss to the taxpayers of
a valuable piece of public property. The Mayor of the
city and the Chief of the Fire Department join in the
declaration that a garden hose attached to a proper
pipe and pressure system would have been more ef
fective than the best fire engines proved to be when
compelled to draw on the insufficient supply and weak
pressure of "betterments" to the city's water plant,
for which the private corporation demands several
millions of dollars. The Call only asks justice for the
people of Los Angeles. The life of iron pipe under
ground is a known quantity. Given the size of the
pipe, its thickness and the average pressure it has
sustained and its condition can be estimated without
digging it up for inspection. But the pipe is buried.
The people don't see it. The most of them don't stop
to think how much its value and usefulness are af
fected by lapse of time. But the water company knows
all this. They are inside and deal with the advantage
of ample knowledge of the condition of every inch of
their system, of the vicissitudes of their supply and of
the present value of it all.
This knowledge can be placed at the disposal of the
people by their city government if a majority of the
Council choose. The stolidity of that majority, how
ever, was left to be shaken by an accident which
came in the burning of a public schoolhouse and the
narrow but fortunate escape of several hundred chil
dren who were in its class rooms when the dreadful
alarm sounded. Accident has exposed what should
have been publicly known by means of official action,
and now there is no further excuse for official inat
tention. How long does the Council propose to
wait? How many public buildings and private homes
must be consumed as object lessons before officials
will be mindful of their oath and their duty?
Must the sacrifice be greater than the destruction
of property? Will the spectacle of a score of chil
dren burned to death in their schoolrooms, or that of
working people passing from the slumber of weariness
to that of death in a chariot of fire, be needed to sting
these men to action?
They have the chance now to act and they may be
even excused for pleading that the fire on Pico
Heights revealed conditions of which they were ig
norant, and for one we are willing that the people
should believe them. We have no vindictive ends to
Genre and no selfish interests to enhance in this mat
ter. We only want justice to the people of one of
California's brightest and best known cities.
Hicks-Beach has warned Canada that it is her duty
to do something to add to the naval strength of the
mother country. If the mother country can't get
along without aid of this sort it would seem time for
Canada to begin wondering what is the use of being
a colony and tied to an apron string.
In the disagreement of medical experts as to the
sanity of a woman now being judicially weighed at
Los Angeles it can hardly be said that the unexpected
has happened. Perfect agreement in such matters will
never be secured until one side or the other shall be
thoughtful enough to retain all the experts.
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JA\r AttY 22, 1898.
TfIKE A VOTE.
THE amendment to the annexation treaty of
fered by Senator Bacon is a trip hammer blow.
It follows precedent in the Texas case, in which
it was provided that admission as a State should be
voted on by the people, and the San Domingo case,
for the treaty to annex that country demanded sub
mission to the people.
The close corporation which the oligarchy has
maintained in Hawaii has from the beginning calmly
ignored the 14,000 voters who had the ballot before
the conquest of 1893. Of the 2800 voters permitted
to use the ballot by the oligarchy a very large num
ber are adventurers who have been domesticated in
the islands during the last four years.
The Georgian's amendment begins right. Before
discussing issues of expediency and constitutionality
it is necessary to find out whether the people want
annexation. That is the American way of proceed
ing and the method is based on fair play and a de
cent regard for human rights. When the native-born
Hawaiians of legal age and the lawfully naturalized
citizens have voted on the question it will be time to
discuss the other phases of the subject.
But it must be understood from the start that there
must be a free ballot and an honest count. When the
Dole Government formed its new constitution it ap
pointed a majority of the members of the constitu
tional convention. It then dictated fn that instru
ment a provision for annexation to the United States.
Its stove was already too hot to hold and it wanted
to let it drop. It provided also that no one should
vote without taking an oath to support this annex
ation constitution, so that any Hawaiian who was not
willing to confirm the oligarchy's power to sell the
country to the highest bidder could not vote at all.
This neat juggle has enabled the oligarchy's lobby
ists to deny that anybody is disenfranchised and to
declare that the electors of the islands are unanimous
for annexation.
The Bacon amendment smashes this scheme at one
blow. It steps outside the Hawaiian constitution and
refers annexation to a plebiscite of the whole people.
But there must be no further juggle. The amend
ment must not permit a proclamation either from the
President of the United States or the ruler of the
Hawaiian oligarchy to the effect that "duly consti
tuted electors upder the Hawaiian constitution" only
shall vote because that brings the matter right back
where it is now. inasmuch as under triat constitution
even,' elector will have to take an oath to vote for an
nexation before he can vote at all. This oath the na
tives will not take.
The Senate of the United States cannot afford to
defeat the Bacon amendment. It cannot afford to
make the open record of a republic refusing to sub
mit to a people a change in their sovereignty. Such
refusal puts this country at once in the catalogue of
autocracies. We go then further down in the class
than even the constitutional monarchies and take our
place alongside of the Asiatic absolutisms, where
Shahs, Ameers and Khans are the lords of life and
death.
We have heretofore counted ourselves much supe
rior to Thibet and have been classed higher by the
rest of the world.
The chief of the oligarchy is on his way to Wash
ington to talk about a Hawaiian "republic," and the
ease of assimilating the two governments which are
similar in form. Let us see if he will prove himselt
a republican by assenting to the Bacon amendment.
If he do it will become the duty of American citi
zens to see to it that no trick is played upon the
voters of the islands. People who thank God fer
vently that they have a country to sell are not to
be trusted. The islanders must be safeguarded gainst
the tricksters who have held themseives in power by
armed force, thus increasing a debt which they now
ask us to pay. That election must be guarded from
the casting of the first ballot to tallying the last one
out of the box.
(\ POPULIST AMENDMENT.
SENATOR BUTLER, a Populist bold of
North Carolina, has introduced into the Sen
ate a resolution calling for an amendment of
article 3 of the constitution so as to provide for
the election of Federal Judges by the people, and
to deprive Federal courts of jurisdiction over con
troversies between citizens of ditferent States.
The amendment proposes that the Supreme Court
shall be composed of not less than nine nor more
than thirteen Justices. These, as well as the Judges
of the inferior courts, are to hold office for eight
years. The Chief Justice is to be elected by the
nation at large. Each Associate Justice is to be
elected by the votets of the circuit over which he
presides, and each District Judge is to be elected by
the voters of his district.
The resolution will, of course, be taken up and
considered long enough to permit Mr. Butler to
rr.ake a speech on it, but it is not likely to live
longer. Nevertheless it will be interesting to hear
what Mr. Butler is going to say for it. The de
sire of the Populists to make a new heaven and a
new earth naturally includes a desire to make a new
constitution for the United States, but it is not clear
why they wish to begin with an alteration in the
methods of choosing Judges for Federal courts.
It is true that in most of the States Judges are
elected by the people, and hold office for a term of
years and not for life. It is equally true that in
many of the States this method of choosing Judges
has worked well and given satisfaction. It cannot
be said, however, that in any State has the standard
of the courts been higher than that of the Federal
judiciary, and surely even a Populist can hardly
advocate a change of this kind merely for the sake
ot change.
The judiciary system established by the founders
of the lepublic is one of the notable ir.iturcs of the
constitution. ' It has wen the admiration of every
Intelligent critic of our institutions. It "us stood
the test of time and been found one of the strongest
bulwarks of our Government. Under such cir
cumstances the manifestation of a desire to alter
that system, may be taken as an evidence of a de
sire to alter everything in sight and revolutionize
the nation.
Senator Butler aims high. Most statesmen of
his party content themselves with efforts to tinker
with the tariff, the currency, the railroads, or the
relations of capital and labor. Ther have dealt se
verely with statutes and general legislation, but they
have let the constitution alone. Their movements
have therefore been inferior in scope to that of the
new leader from North Carolina, and the country
will wait with some curiosity to hear what the re
former has to say for his resolution. It belongs to
him and he alone can tell what it means and what
he expects to gain either for his party or the peo
ple by his project.
Dr. Chalmers, the State quarantine officer, could ex
cite interest by an article setting forth what he is for,
omitting, of course, any reference to his ability to
draw a salary, no controversy having arisen oo this
point
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
SENATOR HOAR rendered a service to the
whole country by his resolution calling for an
inquiry concerning the recent order of the
Postmaster-Ueneral reducing the force of letter car
riers in several of the larger cities of the Union. Al
though ostensibly issued in the interests of economy,
the order tends to diminish the efficiency of the postal
service, and will prove far from being economical in
its results to the business of the country.
It is conceded that some reform in the direction of
economy is desirable in the management of our post
off.ee affairs. Every year shows in the revenues ob
tained from the mails a deficiency which has to be
made up by taxation. The evil is one of long stand
ing, has been fully discussed and is generally under
stood. This is the first time, however, that any one
in authority has proposed to remedy the defect by re
ducing the carrier force, and either imposing heavier
work on the remaining carriers or else making the
mail service in cities slower than at present
It has been pointed out by Congressman Loud that
the main cause of the deficit in the postal revenues is
the abuses which are practiced with regard to second
class mail matter. Advantage has been taken of the
clause in the law providing low rates of postage for
newspapers and other periodicals to ship through the
mails tons of papers, documents, advertising circulars
and cheap novels. The Government loses heavily on
every pound it carries of this kind of mail matter, and
while the letter rates pay a good profit it is not suffi
cient to counterbalance the drain.
There is also another point in which economy
might be practiced without weakening the service.
Evidence has been submitted time and again showing
that the rates paid to the railroads for carrying the
mails are much higher than they need be. This is
particularly true with respect to the carriage of first
class mail matter, and it is claimed that even second
class mail could be carried without loss if the rates
paid by the Government to the railroads were on any
thing like the basis of freight charges made by the
roads to private parties.
The one good result likely to follow the order of
the Postmaster-General is the investigation that will
result from the inquiry called for by Senator Hoar.
From the debate that took place on the resolution it
is clear that many Senators are eager to have the sub
ject opened up and thoroughly considered. Out of
the investigation we may expect to come some wisely
directed effort to put an end to the ever recurring de
ficiency in a service that ought to pay its own way.
In the meantime the first thing to be done is to bring
pressure to bear to have the order reducing the num
ber of letter carriers countermanded. That order was
not economy, but parsimony.
"IN THE NEAR FUTURE."
A NUMBER of citizens of Santa Barbara who
contributed to provide a right of way through
that county to the Southern Pacific Company
in order that it might close the gap in the coast line
and give to Santa Barbara the benefit of a through
line from San Francisco to Los Angeles, recently ad
dressed to Mr. Huntingdon a petition requesting that
the company fulfill its obligations and complete the
road without delay.
The petition with the reply have been published in
the Santa Barbara Press and make interesting read
ing. The petitioners stated: "Our citizens, taxpayers,
donors and purchasers of the right of way feel
aggrieved that after securing your company this val
uable franchise with all the advantages embraced in
this free gift, and after seven years of patient waiting,
no evidence exists as to the near approach of the time
when the road will be finished from Surf to Ellwood.
Therefore we respectfully ask you for a prompt re
cognition of our rights ?.nd a fulfillment of your hon
orable obligations by giving to the undersigned an
assurance that no further unnecessary delay occur in
'closing the gap.' "
On behalf of the company Mr. Huntington replied
in a letter of considerable length. In the first place
he said, "I am not surprised that you complain be
cause the road has not been filled, but I am quite
sure you would not complain of the builders of that
road if you knew just what they have had to en
counter in the last few years." He then went on to
say that the Southern Pacific has to be managed
economically in order to avoid bankruptcy; that he
has Southern Pacific shares, bought in the '70's, on
which he has never received any dividends; that "in
fact I have never made any money I could use out of
building roads in California"; that most of his money
has been made east of the Mississippi; that "I can
say, and I think truly, I have never received any
dividends other than from the Central Pacific shares
on any road I ever built or became interested in in
California, excepting some street roads in cities."
Thus discursively he proceeded to point out where
he has made his profits and where he has made
losses. Finally he returned to the subject of the peti
tion and said very kindly. "Your long list contains
many good names and I would do anything that
could be safely done to accommodate them." He
then adds, "Things are looking better now and we do
hope we will be able to complete the gap in the near
future."
"In the near future." After seven years of waiting
that is all the answer given by the Southern Pacific
Company to men who out of their slender property
gave money and rights of way in order that the road
might be completed at once. It is by just such in
difference to public needs, express promises and
solemn obligations as this, that the Southern Pa
cific Company has roused against it the indignation
not only of all whom it has injured, but of all who
love justice.
The contrast between this method and that pur
sued by the Valley Road in laying track almost as
fast as right of way can be secured is too striking to
need comment. Seven years Santa Barbara has waited
in vain. In less than half that time the Valley Road
has laid its track from Stockton to Bakersfield.
That is the difference between companies that fulfill
their obligations on time and those that postpone
fulfillment to the indefinite, uncertain date of "the
near future."
A Chicago lawyer pleaded for the life of an assas
sin on the ground that there was no other hope of re-
Reneration for the wretch. However, it is to be in
ferred from observation that this hope is hardly worth
mentioning.
Huntington tells the people of Southern California
that he has not made money out of railways in this
State. Still, Huntington is not unreasonable; he does
not expect anybody to believe him.
Once more it has been demonstrated that Fol
som is not an agreeable prison to escape from.
However, if a convict is bent upon suicide the
method is speedy enough.
Any murderer who chooses to scan the news from
San Mateo will come to the conclusion that an indi
vidual of his stripe is regarded there as persona non
grata.
SEEKING THE FAVOR OF MENELIK.
ABTBSTNIA has been more prominent-
Iv 1.. fore the world since the black
Emperor demonstrated his power by
crushing tho armies of Italy at Abba
Carlma mid Adigrat, and the personality
of Mcnrlik has become a very captivat
ing actuality. England and Franco have
both hastened to gain, at his hands, fav
orable recognition of their overtures for
amity and friendship, and even Russia
has made advances in that direction, the
object of which are not so apparent, how
ever, as In the case of the two other
nations. Their object is well understood.
It is the control of the vast and fertile
country of the Eastern Soudan and along
the upper Nile. To this end England has
already wasted over a hundred million
pounds sterling in futile attempts to force
her way up the Nile to Khartoum and
thence south to the lake region, whither
sho has already carried a railroad from
the Zanzibar coast. The French hare

them the yet fresh memories of Sir

made but little advance in the favor of
either the Negus or bis subjects. While
Has Makonnen was receiving, with the
ir.ost friendly demonstrations, the French
envoy, and conducting him with every
mark of consideration to the court of his
sovereign at Adis-Adaba, the English
mission was yet halted near the coast
almost unnoticed. '
If. Legarde was received at Harar
with a salute of twenty-one guns, and

was paid him.
A DELICATE
COMPLIMENT
TO DOLE.
Mr. Dole had just
finished his breakfast and was standing
In front of the hotel drinking In the love
liness of the morning and ruminating on
tho uncertainty of life, and other things,
when he was approached by an individ
ual of rather doubtful appearance. Mr.
Dole was positive that he did not know
the stranger, as the only persons that he
had, thus far, had the pleasure of meet
ing were Lieutenant Xoble of the army
and a few hackmen and railroad agents
who had gathered on the wharf the day
of his arrival to bid him welcome. How
ever, he of the peculiar appearance evi
dently had no doubt of the Identity of the
personage he saw standing In the hotel
entrance, for the moment his eye caught
sight of the distinguished stranger his
face became suffused with the warm
blush of pleasure and a smile of ecstatic
happiness overspread and softened the
somewhat hard lines of his cynical coun
tenance, and rushing up he extended the
glad hand to the Island President and
without giving that gentleman any op
portunity to say a word, commenced:
'â Judge, I've been looking for you all
over the town as I want to put you right
on that little matter of Mag's that is to
come up before you this morning. You
see â "
"You must have made a mistake,"
broke in Mr. Dole. "I am the President
of Hawaii and not a judge."
"Hully g^e!" exclaimed the stranger,
falling back. "I took you for Judge
Campbell, as I thought there was only
one bunch of whiskers like that In the
city."
J. M. McGee, a wealthy mining man of
to Fashoda. on the Nilo, there to meet
the Man-hand expedition coming from
the Congo, plant the standard of France
and actualize her possession of an un
broken connection from the Red Sea to
the Atlantic. These movements have
caused the greatest concern in England.
She sees the Nile country and Ethiopia
Flipping from her possible grasp, and is
powerless. All the expenditure in this
direction promises to be without fruit.
France has outgeneraled her and holds
the position of vantage, whose future
value cannot at this time be even esti
mated.
In the whole conduct of the matter the
French have evinced much shrewdness
and discretion. Instead of approaching
Menellk with an air of offensive conde
scension," as is the wont of their neigh
bors across the channel in dealing with
dusky potentates, they have not only
accorded the fullest recognition of his
imperial dignity, acknowledging his
right as a .sovereign and independent
monarch to sit in the hereditary ruler
ship of his people, but have done their
best to make .him appreciate their atti
tude of respect and enhance the splen
dor of the evidences of his power and
personality.
"With the sanction and at the expense
of the Government M. L,egarde had made
and carried with him on his late return
from Paris to the Abyssinian court many
presents of rich design and costly work
manship. Intended for the personal use
and adornment of the Emperor and his
consort. Taltou. The principal one con
sisted of a throne of very particular de
sign, which Is Intended to serve both as
a seat of justice and a couch of recep
tion.
On the days of audience the sovereign,
"The Uon of the Tribe of Judah." as he
styles himself, claiming descent from
King David, seats himself "a la Turque"
between the two cushions, while the dig
nitaries admitted to the reception pass
before him. This throne is of fine wood,
overlaid with gold, with the points
panels relieved with green ami red, the
colors of Abyssinia. The curtains are of
purple silk damask, ornamented with i
fringe and tassels of finely worked gold j
thread of the highest richness. The I
cushions and front piece are likewise of j
silk damask finely ornamented.
"With the throne went collars and
cross es of gold set with jewels for Men
elik and the members of his family,
those for himself and the Empress being
of particular richness and splendor, the
first being set with amethysts and gar
ni ti and the other embellished with satt
phires. tee pearls atid turquoises. This
collar is composed of three chains inter
bound, and w.iffhs over one and a quar
ter pounds. Each of tho four children
received a collar and cross, also of com
mensurate worth. M. L,egarde made
en reful study and left nothing undone to
further the success of his mission.

to attend a meet
ing of the Central Traffic Association
Western Traffic Association and Trans
continental lines which has for its object
the fixing of a permanent and satisfac
tory rate to all points in the Alaskan
mining district for the large travel that
is expected this spring. The meeting- wa*
called by F. C. Donald, president of the
Central Traffic Association, and D D
Caldwell, who is at the had of the West'
em Traffic Association. The steamship
lines running northward from Sun Fran
Cisco and connecting with the different
points of debarkation for the Klondike
country have so increased their rates that
a very- material difference is made In the
expense attending travel to that country
via San Francisco and via Sound points
The steamship companies have refused
to reduce the rate, as they argue that un
der any circumstances the number of pas
sengers who will go northward from this
city will be large enough to more than
fill the carrying capacity of their vessels
Consequently in order to bring the traffic
to this city the railroads will have to
mako rates low enough to compete with
those which will exist over ihe rp,.r.>
northern routes and as the steam-lrns
will have to be utilized to forward paÂ»
sengers to their ultimate destination, a
cut in railroad fares in proportion to the
increased rates by water will have to be
made, and in order to equalize the lorn
that will accrue to the various roads run
ning west of the Missouri this meeting
has been called.

which, as he remarked, Is too good .to
keep. The party were discussing swell
dinners and after-dinner speakers, when
the gentleman from the East said: "In
our section of the country General Por
ter enjoys a reputation as an after
dinner speaker that is second only to
that of Ohauncey Depew. On the particu
lar occasion that I have In mind General
Porter was in attendance upon the annual
banquet of the Sons of the American
Revolution, which was held In the Jeffer
son Hotel, In Richmond. Va., last year.
The U<m. William Wirt Henry was the
toastmaster. I'pon his right sat General
Porter and to his left was General FltS
huph I.cc, now representing this country
in c'iilva, while ex-Vice-Fresident Steven
son was also present. General Porter was
not down for one of the regular toasts,
but before the banquet was over Mr.
Henry called upon htm for some remarks.
He arose with his accustomed grace and
said: 'As you all know I had the honor of
being upon General Grant's staff at the
time that Richmond fell, I see many here
to-night with whom I was not upon
speaking terms at that time. When our
party left Washington the other day to
come here some one in the party asked
me how long it would take to reach Rich
mond. I replied that judging by my ex
perience of over thirty years ago i
the I.cc family interposed an objection "it
would take us about four years.' With
thla Genera] Porter turned and bowed to
General Lee and took his seat amid great
appUtuse. It was one of the most grace
ful things I have ever seen done."

them all, but the rule specially inquired
about, the one that applies to the last

ing been made, each player counts the
aces and tens which are in the tricks the
player has taken; these aces and tens
are called brisques. For each brisque the
holder scores ten points, which are added
to tli.- score made during the playing by
the combination. Brisques are not count
ed when any one of the players makes
the same by scorings made by combina
tions: that is to say. when neither of the
players has made the number of points
fixed to complete the game, then he,
who. with the brisques counts most over
the fixed number, wins; and. in case of
a tie the winner is the one taking the last
trick.
THE SUNâ A Reader. Dutch Flat. Cal.
If the earth were so poised in space that
the sun would be vertical at the equator
throughout the year it would certainly
rise exactly in the east and set in the
west during the entire year. This Is just
what it does on March 21 and September
23, when it shines vertically at the
equator. As the earth's inclination from
a perpendicular to the plane of its orbit
is the same throughout the year, thus
causing unequal day and night alter
nately north and south of the equator, it
shines more or less obliquely, according
to the latitude toward either pole, and
the moment it deviates from a perpen
dicular at the equator it shines beyond
the north pole in oar summer. "Wh^ii the
Bun's declination is 23 degrees 28 mimitea
north of, the equator, as at the summer
Bolstlce, it is. of course, 23 degrees 28
minutes north of an east direction, and
will so appear at sunrise and sunset.

To Charles S. Glvens. Ban Francisco:

to-morrow. JOHN F. SHEEHAN.
A. H. Washburne, one of the man
agers of the Yosemite Stage Company,
called at the office of the commission
yesterday to ascertain if an advance
payment of $350 which he recently
made for one quarter's lease of the
Sentinel Hotel had been credited on the
books. It was found that the amount
paid had been credited. Mr. Wash
borne is special administrator of the
Glascock estatf and the lease <>f the
hotel is the property of the estate.
The books of General Sheehan, which
were turned over to his successor. J. J.
Lerman, last Monday, reports that dis
bursements as follows, on the days
designated, were made to the Yosemite
Stage and Turnpike Company: Octo
ber 27, In&7, $152 70; November 25.
$145 20; September 2S, $248 22; Septem
ber 28, |50; September 26, $45; Septem
ber 28, $3y 65.
Mr. Washburne asserted to Commis
sioner Foote and Mr. Lerman that he
had not received these sums, which
amount in the aggiegate to $6SI. The
sums allowed by the commission to the
Yosemite Stage Company were in pay
ment of transportation, pasturing,
hauling: of lumber, â  I
"These items," said Commissioner
Foote, 'are taken from General Shee
han's books. The amounts were all
by the board and ordered paid. She.-
han's books say they were paid on
the dates mentioned. Wasburne
was here fn the office this morn
ing and asserted that the bills have not
been paid. Is it not time that General
Sheehan shouJd come forward and ex- :
plain these discrepancies? This is not
the first muddle. Two years ago, ac
cording to Washburne's statements, !
checks drawn by Sheehan on Yosemite
Commission account were dishonored.
The evening papers report Sheehan as
saying in Sacramento that politics fig
ure in this matter. There is no truth
in that statement. It is false. Sheehan
resigned, to take effect January 1. The
vote was unanimous and Sheehan cast
the ballot of the board. He was per
mitt-d at his own request to hold the
office from October until the Ist of Jan
uary. Clinch requested it and I con
sented. The Governor was opposed to
the plan, but he consented at my re
quest."
Commissioner Charles G. Clinch was
Et-en at his place cf business yesterday.
He expressed the opinion that Shee
han would explain everything to the
satisfaction of the board at the next
meeting. He remarked: "Baker &
Hamilton have been paid, Kahn & Co.
have been paid and there is the sum
of $500 in the bank. The dispatch
from Breyfogle may be explained in a
satisfactory manner hereafter. It Is
le that the check may have been
forwarded to Breyfogle's brother, who
1p up in the mountains. In my Judg
ment Sheehan will straighten every
thing out."
Commissioner Clinch .was asked if it
had not been a reproach to the State
at one time that the office of secretary
of the Yusemite Commission was an
adjunct of the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company, and if it would not be
equally unfortunate to have the office
of the commission an adjunct of Com
missioner Foote's law office.
Mr. Clinch replied that the office of
secretary would "not be an adjunct of
Mr. Foote's law office. He remarked:
"It is unfortunate that only $25 a
month is allowed for office rent, but I
am in favor of having an independent
office for the business of the board â a
place where tourists in o,u"t--t of infor
mation concerning the valley may con
veniently visit."
Commissioner Foote was asked con
cerning the probable payment of the
Breyfogle account to one of the Brey
fogle brnthf-rs without the knowledge
of the other. He replied by producing
a written copy of an assignment of
the claim from W. O. Breyfogle to W.
B. Breyfople. The telegram stating
that the bill had not been paid is from
the latter.
Commissioner Foote was asked If the
meeting of commissioners? called to con
vene this forenoon would be h^M with
open doors. "It will be open if I have
the say. Ther^ is nothing here that I
â¢would conceaj from the public. There

SHEEHAN INTERVIEWED.
The General Says He Has Noth-
ing to Hide From the
Commission.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 21.â General
Sheehan left this afternoon for San
Francisco. In an Interview published
in to-nlghfs Bee he is reported as say
ing:
"You may say that any matter relat
ing to the YoÃemite Commission with
which I had anything to do will be
fully paid, but I do not at this time
care to talk of the alleged shortage. I
have been sick for three or four weeks,
and have not had time to look over my
books. When 1 get time to look them |
over everything will be straightened
out and no one will lose anything."
\\ hen asked if it were true that he
had withheld his bank deposit book, he
replied:
" y es, I have the book, and I am re
spr isible for it. It is my book, and
why should I not keep it? I tell jrov
again this will come out all right."
Concluding. Sheohan said:
"I do not want to say anything fur
ther about this matter, but there is
politics in it, and it will come out all
right."
In a subsequent interview this after-
She^han said:
'â¢The reason I did not turn over the
bank book la that 1 am responsible for
.tdo in my name. All checks
â ims are issued, and when cashed
they must be returned to me, in order
th;Â»*t the canceled checks shall serve
as vouchers to me that I have paid all
claims. I have done just as my prede
cessor. Colonel John P. Irish, did. How
ever, I have nothing to hide from the
Commissi-m, as all checks will be paid
when presented."

Th^re promises to he a merry little

City and County Hospital, one that
threatens to involve not only the stu
dents, but the faculties of Cooper and
Toiand Medical colleges, with Dr. Suss
dorf as dodger in general of verbal mis
hurled by both contending forces.
Dr. \V. W. K<_rr, professor of clinical
medicine in Toiand College, who has
had charge of wards C, D and H at the
hospital for nearly twelve years, starts
the ball rolling with the statement that
the whole affair has been started by
| jealousy of Cooper College students and
that their actions and assertions so far
i 'have been contemptible."
"Three internes were suspended by
Dr. Sussdorf at the end of the year,"
he declared yesterday, 'on account of
â  ct of duty, and no final action has
yet been taken in their case. I asked
. the Board of Health to permit Mr.
Fine to assist the other internes in the

I was taken in the case of these suspend-
I ed men. It was granted, but I wish
|it to be understood clearly that Mr.
j Fino is not an interne, but only an as
[ sistant. No interne can be appointed
until the case of those three men is
acted upon finally.
'"He is not a doctor and if that term
has been applied to him it is merely
out of courtesy. The boy is a gradu

account of the fact that his eyes failed
him. He passed the final examination
for all hospital departments last April.
He has attended all his classes and
aeedfl to pass examination only in those
branches in which he failed to be ex

A water tower Js now being construct

THE UNION BOX
FACTORY FIRE
Fire Marshal Towe After an
Investigation Thinks It Was
Accidental.
Anonymous Letters Threatening to
Burn the Place Received About
Â» Year Ago.
Fire Marshal Towe made an investiga
tion yesterday into the fire which de
stroyed the Union Box Factory Thurs
day night, and he Is satisfied that it was
accidental.
He sent for Night Watchman Crowley,
and the nightwatchman told him that he
was going his rounds when he noticed
some shavings on fire between the boiler
and elevator shaft. In a moment the
whole place seemed to be on flre and then
he heard an explosion, which was the
bursting of a barrel of oil. He saw no
one around the premises before the flre
broke out.
The flre marshal explains the apparent
peculiarity of Crowley seeing the whole
interior in a blaze by the faÂ«--t that In
all such establishments the air is filled
with a sort of thin sawdust which would
immediately catch flre all over the tuild
inÂ»r
The superintendent of the factory made
a singular statement to the flre marshal.
He said that about a year ago two anony
mous letters were received at the fac
tcry in which threats iv.^re made that
th< place would be burned down if the
caused by the mtu-htnery was not
stopped. The letters were turned ov.-r t..
the postal authorities, but nothing more
w:<s heard of thorn. The police were not
notified as not much importance waa at
tached to the threats. In view of the
statement of Crowley. the flre marshal
does not connect the flre with the threat
ening letters, which had probably been
sent by some crank.
A. M. Simpson, the proprietor of the
factory, estimates his loss as follows:
(in building. J12.000; machinery. $25,000;
stock. $12,000; total, $49.000, none of which
was covered by insurance.

PROSECUTION OR
PERSECUTION?
Varying Opinions on the
Fining of a Christian
Scientist
Local Believers in the Faith
Cure Discuss the Action of
a Kansas City Judge.
According to Their Belief Thare Is
Little or Nothing to Be Feared
From Contagion.
The action of a Kansas City Judge In
sustaining the verdict of the Police
Court, fining a Christian Science prac
titioner $50 and costs for failing to Â«â¢â¢
port a case of diphtheria she had unsuc
cessfully treated to the proper authori
ties, has caused considerable comment
in this city, both among believers in
and those who are antagonistic to the
faith cure. Christian Scientists look
upon the conviction as being in the na
ture of piTst'eut:on, while regular phy
sicians applaud the course pursued by
the Judge even to the extent of in
dorsing the severe denunciation he
made of the faith treatment.
and tho outer tube cf steel, which can
be extended twenty-two feet high. This
does away with the old method of using
a cotton hose, which was always in dan
ger of bursting, and has done so on nu
merous occasions.
The tower is nrrang-ed In a segmental
by which it can t>e deflected at any
angle within 40 degrees of the perpendicu
lar, thus enabling the operator to cover
the whole front of the burning building
instead of only one f>r two windows as
heretofore. The nozzle at the top can be
Lted by positive action from below,
and does not depend upon the pressure
<>; water straightening out the cotton
hose. Although the tower is composed
in the main of metal, it weighs but 6800
pounds, the Hale tower weighing Ifr.OOO
pounds. The tower rests on the truck
between the back wheels, which, being
Dr. John F. Morse, of the Board of
Health, said yesterday that the woman
had good reason to congratulate her
self on having escaped so easily. "She
deserved to be fined $5000 and given life
imprisonment (or her conduct," said
the doctor. "When a class of people
defies the health laws as was done In
this case no punishment can be too Be
veM. Here was a child allowed to die
from one of thÂ» most dreaded of dis
eases without proper medical treat
ment and the case was not even re
ported to the authorities that proper
Ft* ps might be taken to prevent the
spread of the contagion. If such things
are permitted how can the people ex
pect to be protected?"
The followers and practitioners of the
faith-cure take a decidedly different
vl> w of the matter. Fi-veral of the
most pronounced Christian Scientists in
the city were seen and expressed the
opinion that the action of the Judge
was due in a great measure to preju
dice and ignorance.
Miss 8. E. Bradshaw, who Is looked
upon as the leader of the faith in San !
Francisco, said she was well aware of j
the hostility to Christian Science felt
by the medical profession and people !
generally who did not believe in it, and !
she presumed this hostility would con
tinue; but she asserted that the belief
in the faith-cure was constantly grow
ing.
"We are a law-abiding people," said
Miss Bradshaw, "but there are some
laws that are unjust; for instance, the
law that provides that none but regu- '
larly licensed practitioners shall minis- i
ter to the sick."
'Then you believe this Kansas City
woman was Justified in not reporting a
case of contagion to the authorities?"
"Well, that depends upon circum
stances, and we don't know all the cir
cumstances surrounding this case. It
would do no good to create needless
alarm in a community, although there
might be occasions when it would be
well to adopt some safeguards. Con
tagion, you know, is due in a great
measure to fear, as, for Instance, In
yellow fever epidemics, and if the fear
of the people is not aroused there Is
little danger. Moreover, we hold that
Christian Science prevents the spread
of disease as well as cures sickness it
self; in other words, that faith wards
off disease.
"Ab I said before, we are a law-abid
ing class and strive to observe the law
in every detail. Take vaccination, for
instance. We do not believe in it, but
the law compels it, and so when a per
son is vaccinated we allow it to work
Just enough to satisfy the requirements
of the law and then endeavor to check
further rpread of the innoculation. If
this were not done the person vaccinat
ed might suffer from a most painful
sore that perhaps would temporarily
disable the arm. The regujar doc
tors, however, let it run on and heal
itself. Sometimes we recognize a higher
law than that of man, and in obeying
the higher law we feel that we have
not violated any other."
â¢'What would yau do were a case of
contagion to come under your care;
would you feel in -duty bound to report
it to the health officers?"
"That is difficult to answer. Never
having had such a case I hardly Irtiow
what I would do. Of course some' peo
ple might regard a case as contagious
that I would not consider such."
Mrs. C. M. Howe, another prominent
healer by the faith-cure, went even fur
ther than Miss Bradshaw.
"We do not believe In contagion."
said she. "for the reason that we pre
vent it. As for this Kansas City af
fair It would be better to know all the
circumstoutces before passing judgment
upon it." - â *â  " ; r

A TEACHER'S CLAIMS.
Elizabeth P. Bradley Asks the
Court to Restore h|er to
* Her Position.
The application of Elizabeth P. Brad
ley for a writ of mandate to compel the
Board of Education tc restore her to her
position of instructor in freehand draw
ing in the Polytechnic High School was
considered by Judge Hunt yesterday. The
petitioner, by a resolution adopted by the
Board of Education, was removed from
the position on June L 1897. and she al
leges that her removal was contrary to
law. Yesterday she testified that no rea-
Bon for her removal was ever given, and
the Board of Education has no power to
remove an instructor without cause. In
answer the board refers to the resolution
by which the petitioner was removed,
which at the same time abolished the
freehand drawing class in the Polytechnic
School. The board claims that owing to
the fact that the class was abolished a
pufflclent cause for the removal of the
instructor presented itself. After the case
was argued it was submitted and whether
or not the writ of mandate will be or
dered to issue will be known in a few
days.
TROUBLE OVER (\ BAD COIN.
Arrest of a Fruit-Vender for Giving
a Customer Counterfeit
Money.
Amndeo Gianelli. a 16-year-old boy.
who assists his father in conducting a
fruit store at the corner of Bryant and
Harriet str^f-tF. was arrested yesterday
by Deputy United States Marshal
Monckton on a charge of having passed
a counterfeit dollar on Edward Curtin.
Curtin informed Mr. Harris that he
hoiiprht 10 cents" worth of fruit from
young Gianelli and received $4 90 in sil
ver as change. After he had left the
larger and stronger, give It more sta
bility. The extension of the tower can be
raised while it Is in action, and thus
there are no delays in Its working.
Wherever the old model could be im
proved upon it was done, and it is no Idle
boast to say that it will be the finest
â¢ water tower in the world. It will cost
$5000. every cent of which has been ex
pended in this city, and the profits that
would have accrued had it been built in
the East will all be absorbed in the good
work done by San Francisco artisans. The
reduction in friction which has been ef
fected throughout will give a better
stream with the same relative pressure,
and it is calculated that with 120 pounds
pressure in the receiver the tower will
throw a horizontal stream through a tip
two and a half Inches in diameter a dis
tance of 250 feet
I store he discovered that one of the dollar
: pieces given to him by Gianelli was a
! counterfeit. He returned to the store and
demanded a good dollar for the bad one.
Gianelli denied that he had given Curtln
' bad money and Curtin thereupon com
plained to the Federal authorities.
Young Gianelli was released in the aft
j ernoon on bonds.
MUST BE SENT
TO WASHINGTON
A Soldier Who Was Injured
Years Ago Goes Raving
Mad.
According to Army Rules and Regu
lations He Has Been Sent to '
the Capital.
A soldier on Angel Island has gone
crazy, and according to the â¢ rules and
regulations that govern the army, he has
to be sent to "Washington. D. C. Two
men went along to take care of him, and
on his arrival in the capital he will be
cared for by the Government until he
dies. This is about the only case of the
kind that has ever occurred on this coast.
Twelve years ago John Madox enlisted
and was assigned to the Fourth troop of
cavalry. While riding a bucking bronco
he was thrown and bo seriously injured
that he was laid up for several weeks.
He got better and served out his term.
He re-enlisted and asked to be assigned
to the hospital corps. His request was
granted, and he was sent to Angel Island.
He had really never got better of his in
juries, and over a month ago he began
to act very peculiarly. He refused to eat
anything because he said Borne of the
soldiers wanted to poison, him. Finally
things came to such a pass that some one
had to partake of every dish before he
would eat it. ..â Â»....â â 
A week ago he became so violent that
he had to be strapped down, and then
the instructions came to send him to
Washington. He was placed on the over
land train by a file of soldiers last night
and during the run to Â»he capital he will
be cared For by Hospital Steward Staley
and Private Garrett, who will act as a
guard. V". ,
CARRIER PIGEON RACE.
A Young Bird's Training Begins
With a F'ig nt Over the Sea.
On board the ship Henry B. Hyde, which
sailed from here for Honolulu yesterday
at 9 a. m.. was a carrier pigeon, the prop
erty of H. C. Worth, residing at 1310
Golden Gate avenue. The bird was
brought down here from Sacramento to
bo trained for the race between carrier
pigeons which will take place between
that city and San Francisco on next
Monday, the beginning of the jubilee
At 1 p. m. T. P. Colcord. master of the
ship, liberated the bird at a point C
minutes southwest by south from the
whistling buoy. It reached here at 3:5$
p m.â remarkably good time for a pigeon
In a strange region hitherto used only to
flights overland. Around the pigeon's leg
was a note, in which the captain fur
nished data concerning the liberation of
the bird, and sent love to his "dear ones."
The bird is young, but it is considered
a strong flyer, and is expected to win the
race from Sacramento here. It is a more
than ordinarily intelligent specimen, as
many have been nonplused for hours
when set free on the sea without any
previous experience.

RANSACKED A
RESIDENCE
Burglar Caught Leaving
the House of One of
His Victims.
A Portion of the Booty Found
Secreted Under His
Shirt.
Hi 3 Accomplice Successfully Man
ages to Elude the
Polioe.
One of the "vacant-house" burglars
who have been operating in the "West
ern Addition Is at last behind prison
bars. He was arrested last evening
by Police Officer John Dougherty while
in the act of a depleting an unoccupied
house at 212S California street. Re
cently a number of vacant houses have
been entered and several hundred dol
lars' worth of lead pipe and gas fix
tures taken. Chief Lees instructed his
men to keep a sharp lookout for the
thieves, as their operations became so
j 1Â»old that he was determined to catch
; them.
While patrolling his beat on Califor
nia street Dougherty saw a man emerg
ing from a vacant house. From t#?
description given of the "tall" man he
concluded that he was one of the
thieves and determined to place him
under trrest. He was taken to the
City Prison, where he gave his name
as Louis Schultz. A search of his
person revealed several pieces of lead
pipe and various gas fixtures, which
he had concealed under his shirt. On
being confronted with the evidence the
prisoner looked down and admitted his
guilt. He gave the name of his part
ner in crime, and told where he could
be found.
Last night Schultz was closely ques
tioned by the detective. He admitted
that he was one of the men for whom
the police have been searching for a
long time and told where he had dis
posed of his booty.
"You have caught me at last," he re
marked. "I knew I^vould fall."
"After sizing up the house," he con
tinued, "I could not resist the tempta
tion, and summoning my partner, we
concluded to enter. I got the key
from one of the neighbors and to
gether a|> entered the house. "We
stripped the gas Jets of their furnish
ings and took all the lead pipe wo
could find. Fearing detection I placed
the stolen property under my shirt,
hoping to evade the police. When we
left the house we separated, my part
ner going in an opposite direction. I
had gone only a short distance when
the policeman, evidently suspicious of
my actions, placed me under arrest. I
endeavored to throw away the evider#?
of my guilt, but he discovered the trick,
and handcuffed me."
To-day every effort will be made to
arrest the prisoner's pal.
NERVOIS BREAK DOWN.
IT COMES TO THE PEEACHER FROM
OVER STUDY AND BRAIN TIRE.
It Comes to Any Person. Too, Who
Worries and Frets.
From the Huron Tribune, Bad Axe, Mich.
A "breaking down of the nervous ays- I
tern" is a modern expression â a modern â¢
complaint. It is induced by a prolonged
â train and the overtaxing of the nervous ;
system, and is a product of over hurry
and hustle. It affects the preacher and '
the lawyerâ the direct result of brain .
tire. It affects people in any walk of j
life, too. who worry and fret. It means â 
a depleting of the nerve forces.
It Is curable by complete rest and I
change of scene, also by the use of nerv->
restorative* and nerve foods. As the first j
method is not within the reach of all, the |
latter offers the most universal and prac
tical method of treating the complaint.
When it is determined that medicine is j
to be used, select that one which con- i
tains the most nerve-nourishing proper
ties. Do not take nerve tonics. They only j
stimulate, and the reaction leaves you !
worse than you were before. Select the j
medicine that is to the nerves what meat !
Is to the bodyâ one that as it builds up
the nerves, also increases your weight.
The best thing for the purpose is Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, the !
reputation of which . is built up by solid '
and indisputable proof, and which is
known in every hamlet in the country.
A3 a proof of its merits in such cases,
read the following letter of a clergyman: i
DR. WILLIAMS' MED. CO..
Schenectady. N. Y.
Dear Sirs: In April, 18%. I was a hope
less case, owing to a complete breaking i
down of my nervous system and to a
persistent stomach trouble. I had been j
treated by a great many physicians, but
received no permanent benefit. I had
been down four times with nervous pros
tration and twice with gastritis. These
attacks would come with such violence
as to throw me into spasms. The time j
came when physicians said I must stop
preaching or die. I would be so exhaust
ed after the last service on Sunday that '\
I could scarcely get from the pulpit.
Many a time I have had to sit down and
rest before I could leave the church in j
order to gain a little strength. I could (
neither eat meat nor vegetables. I dared
not allow my bare feet to as much as
touch the cold carpet or floor, to say I
nothing of taking a cold foot bath. If I j
did I was immediately seized with
cramps. In this condition I commenced
to take Dr. Williams" Pink Pills for Pale
People. I took one box and felt no bet- |
ter, in fact worse. I said I would take no ,
more, but my wife urged the matter, j
feeling my life depended upon the result,
as everything else had failed, and I was
"used up." I therefore continued to take
them. Since then, and it has been several j
months. I have had but one slight attack i
and have enjoyed life. Have preached all â¢
summer and held revival meetings for !
fifteen weeks. During that time my wife
was sick seven weeks, so that my rest
was much broken. Some nights I did not
sleep at all. I have had no muscular ex
ercise for years until recently, when I
have done some work in my garden, and ]
my muscles stand the test remarkably i
well. I can eat anything I desire, and |
can now enjoy a cold bath daily. Every j
Babbath I preach three times, and now I
think I am good for another twenty !
years if the Lord wills. I am surprised ,
at myself, and sometimes think it cannot ;
be possible that I have accomplished j
what I have.

STREAKS OF YELLOW EXPOSED AGAIN.
Necessity for exposing the methods of
the Examiner once more arises. The
task is undertaken not from a hope of
reforming that sheet nor to inflict pain
upon it, but to further educate the
public to a knowledge of its true char
acter. The Examiner seems actuated
by a most unseemly prejudice against
honesty.
There was no surprise at tke an
nounced intention of the Mission street
sheet to issue a Golden Jubilee edi
tion. The Call had already made a
similar announcement, and the Incli
nation to feebly imitate The Call had
been manifest on former occasions.
California is a large State and its his
tory rich in incident. To collect
material for a special issue would not
teem to be an impossible undertaking,
end no paper but the Examiner would
have felt impelled to couple its ef
forts to methods such as prevail in
transactions like the sale of a gold
brick.
A letter reproduced on this page tells
the entire story. It shows how the Ex-
SUITER'S MILL
Drawn by A. Thurston Heydon from a photograph taken in
1851, now in possession of the State Mining Bureau,
San Francisco Made for and reproduced from an
advance copy of the Placerville Mountain Democrat's
Souvenir Edition.
KELSEY IN 1880.
The Old Hotel on the Left Was the
House in Which James W.
Marshall Lived and Died
The scene in the cabin where
Marshall lay dead was, like other
pictures, made for the Placerville
Mountain Democrat, but in some
manner got into possession of
the Examiner, and has been ad
vertised as exclusive.
aminer has used its display type to de
ceive its readers and make them think
that which was really a piece of trk-k
ery a stroke of enterprise. To take
pictures that had been collected and
prepared for publication by a country
paper and then claim to have some
thing exclusive was wholly character
istic. Fortunately the Placerville oui
tor is not the sort of man to tamely
submit to so gross an Imposition. The
indignation felt by himself and friends
is so righteous and thevase they make
out so clear that to refrain from giving
publicity to 'it would be an actual in
justice.
IN THE REALM
OF HIGH ART
Admirable New Creations in
Colors Evolved by Local
Genius.
It is now rather a quiet time with the
local artists in general, few of them being
rushed with orders for the products of
the brush of genius.
L. P. Latimer has lately finished a
beautiful picture in water colors, entitled
"The Brook." It is taken from one of
nature's pictures in Sonoma County, and
Th>e Exari)iner Steals Matter Secured for a
Placerville Paper.
The clipping which accompanied the
letter was an advertisement sotting
forth that the photographs of Marshall
and the picture of him as he lay dead
in his little cabin would appear in the
Golden Jubilee edition, and had never
been published. Perhaps the-Exam
iner may present a technical excuse
fpr this fabrication. The paper for
which the pictures were made and
from which they were taken by some
scheme of fraud has already come
from the press, but it will bear a date
.1 day later than the Examiner. Such
an excuse, however, would but make
JAMES W. MARSHALL as He Lay in Death on the
Morning of the 10th of January, 1885.
a mean act meaner, and haste is
made to direct the attention of the
editorial intelligence of Mission street
to this circumstance, thus saving it
from deeper sin and new rebuke.
With these few kindiy remarks as an
introduction the letter and other ex
hibits are presented.
In this relation it is only fitting that
an account should be given of James
Wilson Marshall, who was born at
Round Mountain Farm, near Marshall's
Corner, Hunterdon County, State of
New Jersey, on the 10th day of October,
1810. His father, a man of some note
in his church and State, was born in
It shows consummate skill in both draw
ing and color. It is to be sent to the
British Society of Water Colours of Lon
don, England, for exhibition. A similar
subject is "Solitude," representing a
scene in a lonely canyon, and showing
this artist at his best. An oil painting,
"Preparing Ground for the Summer Fal
low." shows a foreground of oak trees,
with workmen in the middle distance rak
ing up stubble and burning it.
Arthur F. Mathews has recently com
pleted several new panels in oil for in

pictures from which his reputation cannot
suffer. A s<ri-:-s of three landscapes,
called '"Nature," "Animal Life" and
"Spirit Life" will command the admira
tion <if the art connoisseur. The first Is
in subdued tones, showing an ideal sun
rise in a valley, with no trace of other
than vegetable life. The second Is a pas
toral scene, animated by cattle and sheep,
disposed in lifelike groups and attitudes.
A summer shower is depicted, with sun
shining through clouds, the whole effect
being moderately bright as to color. The
third picture is a very unique and origi
nal embodiment of the unknown and the
unknowable to mortal ken, representing
the figure of a woman in the foreground
in the attitude of gazing in all-absorbed
manner toward the dim horizon, black
clouds supplying a somber mantle for the
scene.

excepting a tendency to see visions, and
he learned his father's trade of wheel
wright.
Shortly after his fathers death Mar
shall moved to Crawfordsville, where
he worked as a carpenter for several
months. Then he went to Warsaw, Illi
nois, and next to Fort Leavenworth,
Mo., intending to take up land in the
Platte purchase. There, between farm
ing, carpentering and trading, he was
fairly prosperous until he came down
with the ague which reduced him to
a shadow. in May, 1844, he started
for California as one of the "bullpunch
ers" in a train of a hundred wagons.
He wintered at Fort Hall, thence
went to Oregon and finally drifted to
California, where he entered Captain
Sutter's employ at Sutter's Fort. For
poveral months he made plows and
spinning wheels and was the handy
man of the place.
Marshall enlisted in the Bear Flag
War and served through that and the
Mexican War in California. Although
not in a position of command, still, ac
cording to his own statements, he was
of great assistance to his superiors in
bringing the wars to a successful ter
mination. He received his discharge in
March, 1847, but on account of the tri
angular dispute between Kearny and
Fremont and Stockton as to who was
entitled to supreme command, he, as
well as the rest of volunteers, was not
paid at that time for his services, and
some, among whom was Marshall,
Claim that they were never paid. This
treatment did not meet with his un
qualified approval and nourished the be
lief, so dear to his heart, that he was a
much abused man. He went back to
the fort, and was a hard-looking object
as he came tramping in, barefoot and
clad in buckskin. He went to work
for Captain Sutter and afterward dis
covered gold at Coloma, as related pre
viously.
At first Marshall had a number of
white men working on "tribute" and
did considerable mining with the In
dians, but in the rush he lost the land
to which he only had a squatter's
right, which under either American or
Mexican law was null and void on min
eral land.
In equity and in accordance with the
mining usa^ps which have been in force
from that day to this, he was entitled
to two average sized claims and the
ground occupied by the mill and what
was necessary for its untrammeled op
eration. But he wanted everything and
ambitious undertaking of its kind ever
made by a California artist. The subject
in this case is a very animated one, con
sisting of a spring landscape in cool, deli
cate tones of grayish quality, enlivened
with beautiful female figures arrayed in
fete eostumt s of the Empire period.
C. D. Robinson has a number of new
marine picturesâ some just finishe and
oth.rs yet on the easel. "Seal Rocks,
from Cypress Point (Monterey)" is a
very admirable creation, with opalescent
bluish gray as a predominating tone. "A
Stormy Sunset" describes a scene looking
out to sea through the Golden Gate, just
beyond Alcatrai. It displays a deep rich
red and orange sunset, the coloriner being
superb. A long in-rolling swell of the
ocean covers all of the foreground and
middle distance. The sky coloring is such
as is only seen just prior to or immediate
ly after a heavy stormâ a fact which the
artist has emphasized by the representa
tion of a couple of fishing-boats scudding
rapidly for the protecting shelter of San
Pablo Bay. A distinct departure in
method from that usually employed by
this artist is to be seen in a picture of a
Instead of concentrating his attention
upon mining he spent his time post
ing notices and getting into trouble
with the newcomers, thus rendering
himself so unpopular that he was fin
ally unable to save even that to which
he was justly entitled, and so he ulti
mately lost everything without a cent
of remuneration.
For several years thereafter Marshall
was a wanderer, but finally returned
to Coloma and bought the ground
where his cabin and monument now
stand. He made quite a success with a
vineyard and in '82 his old cabin was
burned down and the present one was
erected in its place.
In '69 and '70 Marshall went on two
lecturing tours, which were unqualified
successes financially as long as he kept
sober, but his affinity for jags brought
both to an untimely end.
Marshall spent the greater portion of
his latter years at Kelsey, some six
miles distant from Coloma, swinging
back and forth until finally he moved
to Kelsey for good.
After his return from his second tour
the Legislature made the following ap
propriations for him:
February 2, 1572, $200 per month
for two years $4800
March 23, 1874, $100 per month for
two years 2400
April 1, 1876, $100 per month for
two years 2400
Total $9600
Naturally liberal, he scattered his
money indiscriminately among friends
and parasites, and he Boon became but
little better than a common sot. This
had the effect of terminating the ap
propriations and the remaining seven

Children's Society Organizes.
Tho directors of the California Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
have organized by the election of the fol
lowing officers for the ensuing year:
Charles Sonntag, president; W. R. Par
nell, secretary; George A. Newhall, treas
urer; L. A. Presco.t, assistant secretary;
Charles L. Patton. counsel, and Philip
C. Dibert, attorney. Colonel Sonn
tag gave a brief review of the work ac
complished in the past year and said he
looks for good results .in the present
year. John F. Merrill took his seat as a
member of the board. Sigmund Greene
years of his life were spent In poverty
as far as ready money was concerned.
He had property enough in Kelsey to
have kept himself comfortable all of his
life, but he would neither sell nor
work it. His poverty was the result
of his inability to take care of himself
under any conditions which could have
been devised and for that very reason
the State ought not to have cut him off
entirely, but should have given him
$25 per month until his death.
Marshall was a rank spiritualist and
claimed that he had always been aware
that there was a great work for him
to do. and that he had been guided and
caused to make the discovery by spir
itual influences. Be that as it may, he
certainly did make the first available
discovery of California's gold.
Although naturally worthy of better
things, he deteriorated until, in plain
English, he was unprepossessing in ap
pearance, untidy in person and filthy
in habits; his habitation was a den
reeking with tobacco juice, strewn and
plastered with antiquated quids and
redolent with creosote. His objection
able traits became so prominent that
the general impression concerning him
was decidedly uncharitable. He was
very hospitable and fond of children,
while the lasting regard which his
friends have for him shows that there
were elements of true worth in his
character. He was an unfortunate be
ing, misunderstanding and misunder
stood, born to unhappiness and sorrow,
and was one of those wrecks which nar
rowly escaped being a. genius.
Some have sought to rob him of this
credit because the padres mined for
gold In Southern California, although
no important results sprang from their
work. James "W. Marshall's discovery,
made on the 24th day of tlanuary, 1848,
was the first discovery of the great gold
deposits of the Sierra Nevada, and a3
he was the first one to bring them to
the notice of the world, he is justly en

IN HONOR OF LINCOLN.
Preparations flre Beiog Made to
Commemorate theflnijiversary
of Mis Birth.
Every effort is being made by the Lin.
coin Monument Association to make the
coming celebration in honor of the great
statesman and warrior a success through
out the country.
From present reports indications point
to a general observance of the day in all
the cities throughout the entire Union,
and this fact is due principally to the en
ergy of the members of the local league.
As â¢'Lincoln day." as it is called, falls
on Saturday, February 12, 0f this year, the
school exercises in honor of his memory
discovery of gold in commercially valu
able quantities in California.
The afternoon before his death, while
sitting upon his front porch talking to
some neighbors, he pointed to some dy
ing plum trees and said, "That's the
way I feel, part dead and part alive.
That's the way we will all go, one by
one."
As he was feeling poorly he took a
dose of physic before retiring. Mar
shall had a partner by the name of
Hill, and when he heard Marshall stir
ring the next morning, he asked him if
he had heard the noises in the upper
part of the house during the night.
Marshall replied that he had, but laid
it to the rats which infested the gar-,
ret. Hill went out rabbit hunting, and
returning after quite an absence set
about preparing the breakfast. Shortly
afterward he spoke to Marshall, who
was lying dressed upon the bed, his hat
pushed down over his eyes and his
right arm and leg hanging down by the
side of the bed with his right foot
touching the floor. Receiving no an
swer, he touched Marshall, and finding
him motionless, he became alarmedU
went to the door and called out to Mb.
Sipp and Tom Allen that something
was the matter with Marshall as he
seemed to be dead.
They ran over and Mr. Sipp immedi
ately put his hand on Marshall's breast,
but although the heart was still, there
was so much warmth that life had evi
dently been extinct only a few mo
ments. All of the indications showed
that he had arisen, dressed in haste,
as his shoes were unlaced, had gone to
the rear, returned, leaving the back
door open, felt weak, laid down and
died. He did not starve to death, as
has been claimed, for he had some
money and, for him, quite a supply of
provisions.
Although Marshall died at Kelsey he
was buried at Coloma, and Placer
ville Parlor No. 9, Native Sons of the
Golden West, had the honor of initiat
ing the movement which resulted in the
erection of the monument which marks
his resting-place and commemmorates
his discovery.
Marshall died upon the 10th of Au
gust, ISBS, aged 74 years and 10
months, but his monument was not un
veiled until the 3d day of May, 1890.
It is to be regretted that the correct
date of the discovery was not inscribed
.upon the monument, it bearing the
date of January 19, instead of January
24, 1848.

FAST HOUNDS
FROM
COLD COLORADO.
A large crowd will witness the coursing
meeting at Ingleside Park to-day, as It Is
expected that some close and exciting
courses will be run.
The meeting will end to-morrow. It
was rumored yesterday that Press Agent
McQuinne of the Ingleslde Park had left
this city for the gold fields of Alaska.
He has not been seen for some days in
the open.
The promoters of the new coursing park
have secured a five years' lease of tifty
two acres of land immediately across tfie
county line. Of this property forty acres
constitute what is known as Tnion Park,
and the remaining twelve have been se
cured from Mr. Wigmore.
On the new park a grand stand, betting
ring, clubhouse and kennels are to be
built. The work of inclosing the park
will be commenced on Tuesday and the
opening day will be February 22. The
gentlemen interested In the new venture
are E. V. Sullivan, I. F. Halton, P. C.

Petaluma Social Club was the scene of a merry feathering, when the los
ing team of the recent "varmint" hunt were the hosts to the winners of the
same occasion. The gathering was to have been at the clubhouse of the
sportsmen, but owing to the weather the locality was changed. But that
mattered not, for from the time E. E. Drees, as master of ceremonies, gave
the signal, all went merry as a marriage bell, and the only contest was one
of clearing the tables of the delicious foods thereon.
E. E. Drees was also toastmaster, an- toasts, songs, speeches and bons
mots followed quickly after one another. R. S. Brown, J. H. Frltch and
F. C. West were voted the champion story tellers. After a thoroughly
merry time the banqueters dispersed to the strains of "Auld L*ang Syne."
The members of the Sportsmen's Club were: R. S. Brown, Lyman

CRIPPLE CREEK. Colo., Jan. 17.
Sporting Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: One
of the strange sights of Colorado's gold min
ing camp these days, and one that creates
more comment than even the discovery of a
new vein of ore running several hundred dol
lars per ton. Is the spectacle of a half dozen
blanketed greyhounds trotting through UM
streets every afternoon taking their dally con
stitutional. These dogs are owned by Messrs.
Simmons and Donahue, two of Cripple Creek â¢
most popular young business men. The dogs
are being put In shape to run In California
next month, and If one of them does not win
the John Grace challenge cup there Will be, a
whole lot of disappointed people here.
When these gentlemen took five dogs to run
for the big purse at Merced last November
very few people here knew anything about
coursing. It In different . now, however. The
newspaper accounts of that big meeting spread
the Intelligence that Cripple Creek dogs did
well, and when Rusty Gold was beaten by
Mlalmo in the final there were many expres
sions of regret.
The Colorado coursers returned home loud
In their praise of that wonderful climate of
California, but more especially of coursing and
coursing men whom they had met on the
Coast. They did not waÃte much time in Ret
ting a new string of dogs on their return, as
they had left ail their Merced runners on the
Coast. They claim to have faster ones now
than even Rusty Gold, among the number be
ing a brother and the eire of the Merced
runner-up.
The â¢Cripple Creek coursers will leave here
for San Francisco on the 10th of February with
their dogs that are entered for the Grace cup.
the flirt round of which will be run at Ingle
side Park on February 21. !
With a thermometer here registering close to
zero at noon, dogs need heavy cover without
doubt. Still it does look as though they would
be handicapped In regard to training, com
pared with the California trained hounds. The
owners, however, cay that they have the best
dogs on earth and will convince their Cali
fornia friends that high altitude road work Is
better for a dog than sea level exercise. Yours
truly,* A CRIPPLE CREEKER. ;

UNEMPLOYED ORGANIZED.
They Will Make ar) Earnest Fight
for Recognition in the
Charter.
The unemployed of the city have made
a permanent organization for the pur
pose of demanding recognition on the
charter. Their headquarters are at 1028
Market street, where their petition la
constantly exhibited for signatures. Their
petition demands that there be a specific
levy of taxes for the purpose of giving
work to the unemployed, and that tti&
minimum wages paid shall be |2 a day.
Some of the leaders of the movement
say it is very popular with the merchants,
who will welcome It as a speedy way of
escaping from a hundred or more appeals
for aid each day.
CYCLING CLUBS
SHOULD
ENTERTAIN MORE.
San Francisco has fewer bicycle clubs
in proportion to Us sze than any other
city in the United Suites except Cincin
nati. The wheeling interest Is not dor
mant, however, for there are estimated to
be over 2T>.(hio riders In this city alone.
Of this number a scant thousand belong
to organized clubs, and over half of thÂ«?
total individual membership of the C. A.
C. Câ or over COOâ is made up of unat
tached riders.
In looking around for a reason Tor this
state of affaire, we are confronted with
the fact that the managers of the < yiâ lt
clubs here have not yet learned from our
Eastern brethren the art of making their
clubs sufficiently attractive to induce a
large membership. True, we find in the
Olympic. Imperial. Bay City, San Fran
cisco. California and similar institution?
rather attractive club quarters. But with
the obsolete club run and an occasional
unentertaining "smoker" me efforts stop,
and there is nothing to tempt a man to
Join a club or to patronize it after he has
done so.
Hut the club manager will answer and
say: "Ah, but we have only 100 mi-mln-rs,
and. at II a month, that is barely enough
money to run the club, without run

another, arid prosperity returns at
What th^ Sari Fr.
need is advertising in their own city
among the (lass of riders who would be
likely to become members. Many an un
attached rider would be a dab man to
day If ho saw where it would accrue to
hip advantage. He is probftbjy h.>t a
racing man. as Btatif>ti<-n shfldv that only
one wheelman in every 200 ev> r i
himself and that only 1 in every S I
riders ever attend a h.cycle rare. There-
Core, he is not attracted by any club that
caters to the racing element, and it Is a
false idea to think that the winning of
races, relays and the like is of particular
benefit to the dub. The winning club
may oe better known in the public mouth,
but a glance at its membership roll ;*::d
treasury will explain the rest.
There! re, our unattached frk-nd must
I tticed by some other nil ans th:m
cycle racing. Mayhap he lik-s muring
awheel, in which event a long list of
proposed tours for the season, prepared
months in advance of their occurreni Â« by
tli'- t-iub eai'tuin. will be a bait at which
he will likely nibble.
Kut the chances are he wants his bi
cycle club to also serve the purpoei
a aortal institution, where he may pa.-.;
frequent evenings during the week. '
a pretty 1 , well-located club house, with
piano, reading and c;ird rooms und bil
liard hall, will attract him for tl.
few visits but not after that. Probably
his own home is as good as the club
house, his sisters play the piano |
than any of the boys at the club, if he
desires to read his home is m^re quiet,
sin.] Mlliards are a pastime that one soon
tires of if it is the only one, particularly
when playing with chipped balls and un
tlpped cues.
KaMern bicycle clubs have been through
al! th:s, and many of them have suc
cumbed. Others, with stronger minds at
tbe helm, have met the situation an 1
coiKii.ered it. How? Hy providing means
of Indoor entertainment that make club
lif" enjoyable and attractive. Propor
tionate size duly considered, New York.
Philadelphia and Chicago have ten times
as many bicycle club? as has San Fran
cisco, and they are all flourishing. A
U rge membership of desirable young m.-n
who patronize and support the institution,
is ali that Is needed to make a clubs cri
dition "nourishing" and its treasury
plethoric.
1 think the trouble with the S () n Fran
cisco clubs has been that In many of
their forms of entertainment they were
not satisfied unless they made money out
of tfct-OL The club treasury required this.
but that wns not getting at the root of
the evil. With more members the treas
uiy would be fat and it would not b*>
necessary to make every entertainment
self-supporting, to charge an entrance fee
tor every littlo billiard or card tourna
ment, or a "hat-check" at the dance.
Among the social doings ot Eastern
clubs, we read of "the annual ball of
the Harlem Wheelmen. The decorations
will be especially tasteful, while th^ best
of music is promised for the dancers. Ad
mission Is by invitation only, procurable
from the members and limited to one card
to each member."
Again: "A new idet) has been evolved
l>y sntne of the bright members of th<
Koyal Arcanum Wheelmen's Club, and it
takes the shape of a free dancing cluss,
which will practice at the club house.
â¢ very Thursday evening from now until
the first of April. An athletic smoker is
on the tapis for January 22." This or
ganisation numbers over 4SO members of
both sexes.
From New York city we learn that "In
about ten days the big bowling tourna
ment of the Associated Cycling Clubs will
begin and will continue up to the first
week In March." Now fancy the C. A.
C C. giving a bowling tournument. The
first question somebody would ask would
be- "How much entry fee can we charge,
and how much can we make on the pro
gramme?" . , .
Such features as whist, euchre, crib
bnge and hearts tournament, over which
we make such a hullabaloo, are inter
spersed between these big events like rel
ishes at dinner. Inter-club games of
billiards pool, bowling, indoor baseball
jmd srmtnoboard help to make up the odd
time until a clubman has to have a date
book to keep track of his engagements,
and not to belong to at least one of the
local bicycle clubs is to be completely
"out of It" socially.
In Denver the Wheel Club has begun a
systematic saving of pennies in prepara
tion for a trip to Paris In 1900. Ninety
members of th!s club attended the Na
tional L. A. W. meet at Asbury Park
two years ago, and the same crowd will
| go to Indianapolis this year. Great inter
est Is attached by the. members to these
pilgrimageÃ.
In the New England State* much en
thuÂ«laÂ«m is manifested over certain
coasting contests, managed by the Asso
ciated Clubs. A man may not be a racer,
but any wheelman can be a coaster, and
for a prize hung up by the association or
by some prominent dealer these riders
assemble in hundreds to outcoast each
other on some gradual decline, one of the
n-H<nt exhilarating sports imaginable and
far more entrancing taan tobogganing or
"chutelng." Will the dealers offer th*
prizes? Ask any lucal tradesman in
cycling goods what he would pay for the
advertisement that his wheel had out
coasted every other in a contest of that
nature.
The- deductions to be drawn are these:
Experience has shown that a club that
caters to bicycling solely is not the moat
successful. True, all its members should
be wheelmen, but by nTaking the club at
tractive to their social life you build up
the bicycle interest. And the flrÃt club

and tries to sÂ« c, not how few entertain

THE FIELD TRIALS"
OPEN ON MONDAY.
Interest In the Pacific Coast field trials
which will be held at Bakersneld com
mencing on Monday la now intense, ow
ing to the short space of time that inter
venes before the first cast-off la made.
The setters will outnumber the point
ers greatly this year, and doubtless they
win carry "ff the heavy-weight prizes
and honors that are attached to a win.
The owners of the comparatively few
pointers that will he> entered are san
guine, however, that a surprise Is in store
for some of the setter fanciers, but time
will tell the tnle. It is to be hoped that
the pointer, although not as popular a
dog nowadays as the setter among Pacific
Coast f.u.iii is. will prove beyond cavil
that he Is still entitled to recognition
among the best of families.
It is said that the grounds, although
somewhat dry, are In tolerably good con
dition and that birds are fairly plentiful.
Doubtless they will be rather wild, owing
to the long spell of dry weather; runner*
may be fuund numerous. A number of
sportsmen from this city. Oakland and
Sacranu-nto will leave to-morrow for
BakersfUld. Mr. Dormer's place as judge
will be Sited by some gentleman at â 
meeting which will r>e held at Bakersfield.
Manager D. R. McNeill of Central Park
has arranged a three days' baseball car
nival in which the leading teams of the
city will meet.
To-day the Will & Fincks will be pitted
against the Bushnell Alerts. On Sunday
the California Markets will line up
against the Bushnell Alerts, and on Mon

WILL HOLD A
DOUBLES
TOURNAMENT.
Tennis 1b the proper thing among our
local society people at present. Every
day the California courts are occupied by
young lady members who devote hours to
the game. During the past week many
matches were played and were witnessed
by many visitors. Following are some of
the games played and their scores:
Robert "Whitney and* George Bradshaw,
the invlncibles, defeated Joe Dallf and
Walter Magee. Score, 6â2. 5â7, Bâ6.
George Whitney and William O'Connor
defeated Sheffield S. Sanborn and Walter
Magee by a score of 6â3,6 â 3, 5â7,5 â 7, 6â4.6 â 4.
Woerner Stauf is still the heavy-weight
champion of the club. He strengthened
his claim to that honor by defeating Will
lam O'Connor by a score of 7â5.7 â 5.
Joe Dally, the accommodating "keeper
of the courts, has not as yet reached his
true form, having been out of practice for
quite awhile. Within a short time, how
ever. Joe will be himself again, and he is
expected to give the leading players a
hard rub.
In a single-handed game Bob Whitney
defeated his brother George. Both play
ers put up a game that drew the applause
of the onlookers. Bob was in ifreat form
and took the first set. George turned the
tables on him in the next. The deciding
set was full of long rallies and brilliant
playing. Bob winning by a score of fiâ 4.
Dr. Root and Ralpli Bliven defeated Joe
Daily and James Bishop. Score, 7â5.
While East Walter Magee made a study
of the style of game piayed indoors. In
his matches this wec-k he has tried to put
into execution some of his observations,
but with little success.
George Whitney and S. Sanborn defeat-
Ed William O'Connor and Walter Magee.
Score, 6 â L
Although Joe Daily lowered Sherwood
Adams' olnrs during the week, it is no
sign that the latter player is not up to
form. On the contrary he la putting up
;in unusually slashing game, and Percy
Murdoch of the Belle Vue Club of Ala
meda will get the. benefit of it when they
meet on Saturday. This match is ex
pected to be the crowning one of the
week.
On the same day George Whitney and
J. Davis will try to down the invlnci
bles. Robert Whitney and George Brad
shaw.
On Sunday and Monday a doubles han
dicap tournament â will be held for prizes.
This is expected to eclipse the tourna
ment held on New Year's day, judging
from the great interest shown."
The young ladles have been receiving the
benefit of Joe Daily's experience during
the week and are showing improvement.
Miss Laura Denson and Miss Alice
Ponrman succumbed to the cleverness of
Miss Manning and Miss Bessie Bowman
Score. 6â3.
Miss Clark has been playing In great
form during the week.
On Jubilee day during the progress of
the tournament the ciub election will be
beld The indications are that there will
be an opposition ticket in the field.
A beautiful silver challenge cup has
been offered by the club which is to be
won three times before becoming the
property of the victor.
Thirteen young ladies and six gentle
man have offered their names for mem
bership since January 1. The club now
has over lift members and is increasing.
Miss Bessie Bowman and Miss Hunter
defated Miss Denson and Miss Poorman
by a score of 6âo,6 â 0, 6âl,6 â 1, 9â7.
COURSING MEN IN COURT
Judge Seawell Listens to Testi-
mony and TaÃes trje Matter

After hearing the evidence of the dis
satisfied members of the "Interstate

well took the case under advisement.
The testimony disclosed that some
of the members, among them Dominick
Shannon. M. J. Donovan and J. F. Grace,
liÂ«>ci>minsr dissatisfied with the way things
were bring run. seceded from the club,
and decided to incorporate under the
name of the old organization.
As soon as the news of this move be
came known to other members they ap
plied for a writ of Injunction restraining
them from using the original name.
In the meantime, the members opposed
to tne > Ingleslrie management leased
grounds across the county line for tivo
years with the intention of running in
opposition to the Inpleside Park, which

RUSSIAN RIVER
IS NOW
FULL OF FISH.
The president of the North Padflo
Railroad received the following dispatch
from the agent of the company at Dun
cans Mills yesterday: "Bar at mouth of
river is now open and lotÂ« of fish run
ning up." â¢
It was reported last Saturday that the
bar would positively be opened on Sunday
morning, but the barrier remained intact,
and, as a consequence, there has not been
any fishing worthy of mention during the
past week.
Messrs. Vogelsang and Babeock, the
Fish Commissioners, left this city for
Russian River station last Saturday, ex
pecting that the bar would be opened on
Saturday night. They were accompanied
by Air. Mansfield, the champion fiy
caster, and John Siebe. the champion
cottontail rabbit exterminator of tho
Tamaipais Sportsmen's Club. The an
glers had very poor luclc. Mansfield being
the only representative of the pleasure
family who landed a fish. He stated that
It was the first fish he had ever taken
on a spoon, but allowed that it was a
game fighter and had afforded him royal
sport.
The deputy who was dispatched from
this city by Chief Babcock to investigate
the reported killing of Bteelheads by tha
net fishermen of Tomales Bay remained
only one day at Point Reyes, during
which time he overlooked examining any
of the nets, but was satisfied that every
thing was "O X," judging from a short
conversation he had with one of the fisa
ermen near Inverness, which is a pleasure
resort near the bay. The deputy. It is
said, hud schemed to pounce down upon
the lawbreakers on the following; uuv.
when they least expected a visit from
him, but a notice from headquarters that
his presence was required at Russian
River station on Sunday upset his calcu
lations.
Instead of looking out for the trans
gressors of the law in Tomales Bay. the
deputy spent Sunday rowing- the friends
of the chief of patrol up and down the
deep pools of Russian River. But it hap
pened that while the deputy was obeying
the mandates of his superior, the fisher
men of Tomales Bay were seining steel
heads under the noses of some of the
anglers who had visited Point Reyes on
Saturday last.
Some of the fish taken in the net were
not more than twelve inches in length,
but the law says such an offense con
stitutes a misdemeanor, as a twelve-inch
trout can readily escape through a net
the meshes of which are seven and one
half inches in length, when drawn closely
together.
The Tomales Bay fishermen use nets of
very small dimension, and this fact is
well known at the office of the Fish Com
missioner
However, anglers need not expect to
enjoy any kind of sport next year In
Paper-mill Creek. But the Commissioners
say that they will stock it extensively
this year. Anglers will rejoice when they
will learn of the stream being stocked
for a fact.
Several thousand fry of the Loch Leven
trout found their way Into the Country
Club's waters this year. The anglers of
the club should certainly enjoy grand
sport when the fish will have reached a
size fit for a place in a creel.
Some months ago it was stated in these
columns that Professor David Starr Jor
dan of the Stanford University, who is
the acknowledged American authority on
fresh and salt water fishes, had said that
from the limited knowledge he possessed
in every particular of the steelheads ofthe
Pacific Coast he could not say whether
they were of the salmon or of the trout
family.
He believed, however, that they were a
trout of the anadromous variety, but
until he engaged in a more extensive re
search and had given the steelhead the
attention it must have for scientific clas
sification he refused to say which it was.
viz.: a salmon or a trout.
Professor Gilbert visited several of the
coast streams this season, and doubtless
he will lecture before the fly-casting
club at some near future date <>n the
mysterious steelhead. It is presumed that
the name "steelhead" will cling to the
fish whether it be a salmon or a trout
and that its game qualities will not suffer
in the least by a proper classification.
As matters stand at present, there is
nothing in the law to prevent an angler
from catching steelheads in fresh water
an.l above tide water with rod and line.
Professor Jordan or some ichthy
ologist â a standard authority as it
were, on matters piscatorial â must
classify the steelhead before an angler
can be punished for having killed one or
many of them above tide water, or, in
fact, any kind of water, with rod and
lino.
Quite a number of so-called hookbills
have put in an appearance in the pools
at the mouth of Paper-mill Creek. Last
Sunday "Andy" caught four. Tom Mar
shall two and Battu mic. George Walker
and AY. Kennedy Inmled two beautiful
steelheads. Latest accounts from the
point are that quite a number of fish are
being caught at "the White House" and
"Sandspit."
JUDGE WALLACE OBDURATE.
He Would Not Send Convicted
Boys to a Reforn) School.
Judge Wallace yesterday sentenced
George alias "Boots" Rowe and Charles
Kelly to seven and ten years' Imprison
ment respectively.
The prisoners pleaded guilty to assault
ing and robbing old Isidore Goulet, and
tried to mitigate their sentence by turn
ing State's evidence against "Bert" Gray,
who they allege was the man who put
up the job.
Gray was arrested, but after a short
trial the jury acquitted him. As both
prisoners were under the age of 21, an
effort was made to have them sent to a
reform school. Judge Wallace, however,
was obdurate, and said that a life in
prison would teach them the error of
their ways.
Gray Is now in jail awaiting trial for
a murderous attack on Goulet.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 21.â Substantial fractional
losses were the rule on the Stock Exchange
to-day. Sugar and Metropolitan Street Rail
way were notable exceptions, showing gains
of H and 2 points respectively. Sugar strength
was attributable to Washington advices that
Hawaiian annexation was Improbable, and
Metropolitan Street Railway advanced on talk
of further extension. A disturbing element in
speculation was the grave appearance of the
Chinese situation, with Japan mobilizing her
forces and France reinforcing her Pacific fleet.
Another . matter that attracted considerable
attention was the announcement from Wash
ington that a vote would be taken next Thurs
day on the Teller resolution. Commission
houses seemed the principal sellers during the
.'.ay, and there were large realizations In
Northern Pacific preferred, which receded 1
point. .
The bond market was quite active, with a
marked demand for the transcontinental Issues
apparent. The aggregate sales were â¦4,048,000.
Government bonds continued to sag, the new

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 21.â The Evening rost's
London financial cablegram says: The condi
tion of affairs In China and Cuba, the London
Timf-s' leaders thereon and the test vote on
â Uvcr <n thÂ» T'nlted States Senate dampened
the Ftock markets here to-day. The close, how
ever, war? Kbove the lowest. Americans were
dull and generally lower for the day. Ontartos
had an exceptionally sharp rise on the revival
of the rumor that Chauncey M. Depew would
go en the Board of Directors. Out of the way
companies having any coirsÂ«ctlon with the
Klondike were inquired for. On bull commit
ments Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific were
vower. CoDoer shares werÂ« extraordinarily
strong, Rio Tlntos being the highest on record
on the 1 axis Bourse.
Published details of the new Indian currency
scheme show that the rates at which the
council Is willing to sell telegraphic transfers
against gold deposited here axe so high that ,
practically the scheme will only be used by '
Eabtern bankers as a lat>t resort.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 21.â 1n wlieat speculators
were treated to a mild sensation at the open
ing by the action of the Liverpool market TIM
quotation* from there were up l^d per cental
for futures. No. 1 Northern spring on the
spot had been rained Id per cental, and even
the London cargo market showed an advance
of from 3d to 6d per quarter.
May opened here with a Jump to 92% c, with
some sales at the same time at 82T4c. The clos
ing price yesterday was 9U4c. July started at
from fi%c to 84 Ye, compared with 83?Â»c yester
day afternoon.
Outside markets -were also very strong, espe
cially New York and Minneapolis, and this
had It* effect. The reason for the strength
of the Liverpool market was said to be on ac
count of the growing scarcity of offerings from
Argentina. A cablegram from Rosarlo said,
however, that the farmers' deliveries In that
country were retarded by rain and that plenty
would be forthcoming later; that the area in
wheat had been large, the yield heavy,
and that no reduction in the estimated export
able surplus was being made. But another
reason for Liverpool strength was continuation
of drought in India. Notwithstanding the ca
blegram from Ronarlo, Liverpool reaffirmed
earlier statements of scarcity of Argentine of
ferings.
There was plenty of selling both of July and
of May. many holders taking advantage of the
sharp opening advance to realize, but declines
of only about VÂ»c resulted in each, and when
the realizing ceased prices went up again.
Primary' Western market receipts all told
VÂ«re 308,000 bushels, agalnet 271.000 bushels the
year be/ore. Minneapolis stocks for the week
were expected to show 200,000 bushels increase
and Duluth WO.OOO bushels increase, and on
t basts and estimate of week's exports, 600,
>URhels decrease In the visible is looked
last year the decrease for the similar week
1,164,000 bushels.
Liverpool closing prices showed net gains
for the day of %d for March, Id for May and
%d for July. Paris noted 25 centimes decline
in January flour and 5 centimes advance In
March-June. Antwerp advised 12Vs centimes rise
in both r*4 winter and Walla Walla wheat.
The clearances from Atlantic and Gulf ports
in wheat and flour were equal to 63n,000 buÂ»hÂ»ls.
The market here began to weaken after the
lasting of the weekly shipment from Argen
tina, >hlch rather confirmed the earlier Rosarlo
cable concerning the large surplus. The ship
ments were given at 318,000 bushels. Selling be
came quite free after that and it waa the
Impression that the Letter crowd liquidated
some of their July and May holdings. May
declined to Slfcc and was bringing 91Tic at the
close. July sold down to 84c and closed at

DUN* 8 REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Jan. 21.â Dun & Co.'s
â¢ Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
With a volume of business remarkable for the
time of year, 88 per cent larger than a year
i ago land 10.4 per cent larger than In 1892 In
payments through the clearing-houses. It Is not
i discouraging that one or two Industries are
j logging. The demand for most goods Is more
â¢ heavy for the season, manufacturing works
i are better employed and orders booked and In
prospect for the ' future are more encouraging
I than at this season In any other year of which
I equally definite records exist.
Exports of products continue surprisingly
heavy. In spite of some rise In. prices. Treas
ury receipts from customs were larger In
twenty days of January than In the entire
month of October or November, and appre
hension regarding the monetary future Is no
longer felt outside of speculative circles. Fail
ures are considerably smaller than were ever
known at this season, both banking and trad
ing less than half last year's. Railroad earn
ings In January thus far reported have been
10.6 per cent larger than last year and 10.4
per cent larger than In 1592.
The rise of wheat above a dollar In regular
sales was not accompanied by signs of specu
lative excitement. In fact, the continuance
of â¢ extraordinary ' exports, 2,945,705 bushels,
flour Included, for the week ,â¢ from Atlantic
ports, against 1,578.215 last year, and for three
weeks 9,022,493 bushels, against J.5G9.532 last
year, besides 4,086.940 â¢ from â¢ Pacific Coast ports
for three week*, would give an excuse for high
prices, even .If â¢ the corn exports . were not
enough to suggest foreign . need, . amounting to
9,270.189 bushels, against 10, 774, 298 for three
L weeks. The fact that cargoes of corn were
shipped during the week to Egypt and Russia,
the very ' countries upon which : Europe most
relies for breadstufTs next- to the United
States, affected trade, not unreasonably.
Just â  when the unprecedented - production of
plglron was â¢ causing weakness â an extraordi
nary demand for . finished products appears. ,
For this season jit least the general demand
Is beyond precedent, including 154,000 tons steel
rails for the week and 1.200,000. already this j
year, orders for plates so large : that Pitts- 1
burg works send away tons to other concerns, j
unable, to fill *v they receive, orders for bars !
â uÂ»h that many concerns are obliged to refuse,
most excellent demand for sheets and fair for
structural forms. Nor does this demand spring
from efforts to combine makers of wire and
Us products ana makers of tin plates. Prices
I of all finished products are sustained by the
demand, though Bessemer pig is 3c lower nt
Pittsburg. but pig at Chicago Is strong, with
some procuring of finished (.forms delayed by
Its scarcity.
FallurrÃ for the wÂ»*k have been 374 In the
United states, against 409 last year, and 63 In
Canada, against 60 last y*ar.
FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Jan. 21.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Irregular specu
lative conditions have prevailed during the
week. Realizing of profits and bear attacks
on prices have been seen, the latter being
based on the revival of the Cuban agitation In
the House* of Representatives at Washington
and of silver measures In the Senate.' On the
other hand, at declines there were evidences of
buying, and In one portion of the market a
normal decree of strength has been shown.
This group Included the stocks of the North
ern and Union Pacific and the companies
whose titles Include the name of Oregon. The
basis for their activity and strength was the
growing belief that the companies In question
will obtain an enormous amount of traffic In
the coming spring &nd from the transportation
I of the passengers 'and freight destined to the
Alaskan cold fields. The strength shown In
; this part of the market to some extent coun
j teracted the bearish demonstrations in other
' parts of the market. In the bond list, which
was very active, though not to such an extent
as last week, the features were also largely
furnished by this so-called "Klondike" group
lof companies. Another feature was the local
traction stocks, but Manhattan was subjected
to more or less realizing, and Metropolitan
Street Railway, which advanced to 143, suffered
a mid-week decline.
London Itself was not a factor In the mar
ket here, in fact the public there was Inclined
: to take an unfavorable view of the revival of
silver agitation In Congress. On the other
hand. Berlin and Amsterdam have been large
purchasers of Northern Pacific and Union Pa
cific securities. The Industrials, with the cx
i ception of Sugar, were neglected, and that
j stock was Irregular, and. generally speaking.
i weak, except when covering of the short Inter
1 est gave it temporary advances. The Vander
bllts were strong In spite of some speculative
realizing^ and grangers followed Instead of
leading the course of the general market.
Among the outside specialties the feature was
the rapid advance in Standard Oil liquidation
1 certificates, which touched 193, the highest
; price on record. _____
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Jan. 21â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: A large measure of activity
In business and industrial lines, with. In some
Instances, previous records surpassed, and very
generally Bteadlnesu In prices of staples, is per
haps the most notable feature of the trade
situation this week. Quotations of cereals show
the most aggressive strength, while those of
some makes of plglron betray rather a more
decided weakness than they did a week ago.
Mild weather Is frequently mentioned as an
influence tending to check retail distribution
of seasonable goods, chiefly because of the
effect on country roads. Spring trade opens
slowly, as usual at that time of the year, but
confidence is still unimpaired. As already In
timated, the Immense current production of
figiron. amounting to fully 1,000.000 tons per
month, has begun to exercise an Influence upon
the price at that staple, but decreases reported
are still only fractional. The outlook in the
steel rail trade is reported us a flattering 01m.
Large orders for railroad account already
booked have been increased within the weÂ»-l-..
sn example of this being furnished by sales
of l. r .,00n rons reported from Â«'hicago at full
prices. Higher prices for wool abroad, baseil
partly on !>hort yield reports, are rerteot^-1 in
the flrmnf-ss of .lomestic quotations, although
the demand, while comparing well with most
preceding years, is smaller than it was Â«t this
time In lv^T. when the tariff changes were be
ing anticipated. The Industrial situation, with
the single exception of the cotton industry,
is one of exceptional strength.
Business In active on the Pacific roast. Cali
fornia crop prospects have l>een Improved by
the recent rains and ship and b<wit building
are very active along Puget Sound and at
Portland.
Quite a shrinkage in cereal exports Is In
dicated by reports to Bradstreet this week.
Total shipments of wheat, flour Included, from
the United States and Canada, amounted to
only 3.926.000 bushels, against 5,229.000 bushels
last week 2.916.n00 bushels this week a year
*Â«â¢>. 3.819.t)00 bushels in 1896 and 2.5H).000 bush
els In the third week of January, US.",.
A further falling off In the number of busi
ness failures la reported in the United Slat**
this week, the total being only 3C9. as against
323 last week, 429 In this week a year ago and
314 In this week of UN, 312 In 1895 and 338 in
ISM.
Failures In the Dirninlon of Canada shuw
a further falllrc off. amounting this week to
only 4<S. asrainÂ«t ".Â« !aÂ«t wp-k 57 In IS<Â«7 52 111
IN9Â« and 4-. in 1894. but slightly exceeding those
of 1895, which numl>ered 38.

While the protracted cold weather has caused
a scarcity there Is no advance In prices, and
Indeed, dealers ray that they do not expect
any.
Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been two arrivals from British Co
lumbia, .with 3833 tons of coal: three from
Washington, 8142 tons: three from Oregon,
11S5 tons: total, 13.113 tons. As the writer pre
dicted several weeks ago, when our winter be
gan to declare Itself, the outlook then was that
our stocks on hand, and to be delivered, were
Inadequate for our requirements, principally
of those grades of fuel that are needed for do
mestic uses. Such has proved to be the case.
No coal famine is feared; If certain charac
ters of coal are not procurable, there are sub
stitutes, probably not so desirable, which can
readily be had. Of couise If most of our north
ern coal carriers should be diverted to other
business, thereby materially diminishing our
supplies from that source, then there would be
some grounds for alarm, but for the moment
this is premature. We shall feel the effects of
the diversion of our colliers to the Alaska
trade later on. .This Is an assurance. We have
six vessels due here within fifteen days from
Australia with about 16.000 tons of coal fairly
well suited for house purposes, if badly needed,
I repeat an extract from my annual reviewâ
"it Is a query how the local coal market will
shape itself In 1S?8" â as there are several dis
turbing elements, any one of which may lead
to singular results.

A JAPANESE SCHEME.
Trying to Get Around the School
Law Under Which They Have
Been Excluded.
ALAMEDA. Jan. 21.â For way* that are
dark f^rul tricks that are vain the Japanese
schoolboys In this city promise to outdo
Bret Harte's historical Chinee. When the
matter of prohibiting thorn from attend
ing the public schools first came up they
-ted that they were willing to pay
tuition fees, as other non-residents were
obliged to do. After making this offer,
however, they must have taken advice,
for now they have repented and propose
to break their way into the schools and
force a free education at the hands of
CARL N. G. HAGER, the Manager of the Floating Society.
the taxpayers. They know that th*y are
not legally residents of this city, since a
minor's It-pal residence Is with his parents
or guardian. Their parents are ;tll in
Japan, and now they are in search of
some one willing: to act as guardian for
them. They propose to Ret the courts to
appoint such guardian and by thus ac
quiring a residence be in a position to
present themselves as pupils and demand
free entrance into the schools.
The rule of the board of this city under
which these boys have be<>n excluded is
as follows: "Pupils whose parents or
guardians are not actual residents of this
city are non-resident pupils. Non-resident
pupils may be admitted to any school In
the city upon paying in advance to the
Superintendent the following rates of
tuition per term: Primary school $10,
grammar school $15. high school $20; pro
vided that no such pupil shall be admit
ted or retained in any school when from
overcrowding or from any other cause the
interests of pupils witOM parents or guar
dians are actual residents of the city
would thereby suffer."

from headquarters to-day to the members
of Company G, Fifth Regiment, to pa

SIX YEARS
WITH SAILORS
Successful Work That
Has Reached All
Countries.
Anniversary of the Floating
Society of Christian
Endeavor.
All the Comforts of Home Given to
Sailor Lads While In
Port.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 21.
Six years of active work among the
sailors coming to Oakland by the Float
ing Society of Christian Endeavor will
be completed next Monday, and the
record made by the society shows that
its work has been greatly appreciated
by sailor men and lads who are now in
all parts of the world.
The hall at West Oakland, where the
Floating Society carries on its work,
is open every evening, and Is a place of
healthful amusement for sailors. It has
been largely patronized from the start,
and a great many sailor boys far from
home have derived much benefit from
the influences brought to bear upon
them at the hall. Periodically enter
tainments are given at which the lead
ing numbers are taken by the nautical
talent in port. These entertainments
have been very successful and there
is never a spare seat in the hall dur
ing their progress.
Carl N. G. Hager, who is in charge
of the work, is much encouraged with
the result.
"Since the work commenced six years

TROUBLE OVER
REVENUE STAMPS
A Brewery at Haywards to Be
Sold To- Day by the
Sheriff.
Government Olficinla Are ExperUnjj
the Books in San Frsn
cieco.
Oakland Offloe San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 21.
To-morrow afternoon the New York
brewery at Haywards will be sold by the
Sheriff. Three weeks ago it was closed
down under an attachment by Sheriff
"White to satisfy a Judgment by H. F.
Nebas for a claim of $1019.
An internal revenue officer from San
Francisco called at the brewery yester
day and found that there was a disagree
ment between the number of revenue
stamps issued and those accounted for,
and so he took away the books to San
Francisco so that they could be experted.
This discrepancy and subsequent action
of the revenue officer may lead to com
plications tha # t may stop the sale, for the
result may have a bearlnsr on the title
that could be given with the brewery in
the event of the sale.
The brewery is not a very larg-e place,
but for some time it did a fair business.
Peter Butt, the proprietor, says the reve
nue stamps can all be accounted for. On
the first of the month they were duly in
spected and found correct, and, as he has
done no business since that time, he is
at a loss to account for the suspicion of
the officer who called yesterday.
One twenty-fifth part of the

November.
The Interior of the County Will Re
sent All the Piuma Going to
the Bay Shore.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 21.
Oakland is evidently not to have
everything her own way In county pol
itics this year, although there are in
this city about three candidates for
JUST A FEW OF THE AMBITIONS OF ALAMEDA.
every position on the county and State
ticket, there are many others In other
parts of the county.
Alameda has just been heard from
and there are enough ambitious poli
ticians in the Encinal city willing to
sacrifice their personal feelings in the
matter if they Ã¼baJl be forced by their
friends to take a salary from the
county for the next four years.
There are quite a few Democrats In
Alameda. During the past two years
they have been split into all kinds of
factions, hut now they are coming to
gether again in time to make a claim
to some of the offices that will be filled
next November. Eugene Woodin, an
ex-Chief of the Fire Department, would
like to go to the Legislature, and Cy
Brown, who was beaten by Supervisor
TaKott three years ago, and is now
on the Bourd of Education, will proba
bly be persuaded to run again.
City Attorney Taylor yearns to rep
resent his district in the State Senate,
and Fred St. Sure may be persuaded,
to run for a Superior Judgeship. Plum
ber Furey. who once won a big prize
in a lottery, may run for Supervisor, as
he has now great faith in his own good
luck. If Joe L,anktre<Â» thought he
could win a county office he would no
doubt take the fit Id.
Then come Alameda's Republicans.
Tax Collector Barber has no objection
to holding his office: Chief of Police
Rogers has already nominated himself
for the next Sheriff; Judge Ellsworth
is also an Alamedan, and other candi
dates are coming forward all the time.
Out in the county there is also a de
sire to have something from the county
pie-counter. Heretofore Oakland and
Alameda have gobbled up everything In
sight, and this greediness has often
helped to defeat the ticket. Now Ar
thur Feldler of I,lverniirp thinks he
should have something, Dan McCarty
a San Lieandro editor, belleTM some
thing should go lo his town, and Mis
sion San Jose is never without a can
didate.

NEW CHARTER
SUGGESTIONS
Councilman Rowe Has
Ideas Regarding
Streets.
He Believes There Are Too
Many Offices in the City
Government.
The Ordinance Calling for the Elec
tion of Freeholders to Coma
Up Next Week.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 21.
Next Monday night the Council will
pass to print the ordinance calling an
election of Freeholders to frame the
new city charter.
Councilman Rowe, who introduced
the resolution Into the Council, refer
ring to the new charter, believes that
above all things the city should make
Its own laws in regard to street Im
provements. At present Oakland is
governed by the Vrooman act, which
provides that a majority protest can
stop any improvements for blx months.
Mr. ltd wo believes that this gives ob
structionists too much power, and he
thinks that the people will vote for a
measure that will decrease this objec
tion.
Another suggestion made is that the
City Council consist of seven Council
men instead of eleven. There are
seven wards In this city and it has al
ways been a puzzle to the citizens why
after each ward has been given a rep
resentative on the board it should be
considered necessary to elect four
Councilmen "at large." Exactly the
same condition prevails with the
Board of Education. Mr. Rowe believes
that seven Councilmen should be elect
ed and should be paid a salary that
would enable them to give all their
time to the city.
They would have charge of the po
lice and fire departments and street
department, and do away with the
present peculiarly situated Board of
Public Works and police and fire com
missions.
City Engineer Clement favors the
plan, declaring it is nonsense to have
an engineer in a city where his office
is as busy as it Is in Oakland ham
pered with police and fire business.
He does not believe that an engineer
should have to pass upon the samples
of lead pencils used in the public
schools or be bothered with applicants
for places on the city departments.
There are many other intricacies that
have been crying for a new charter to
remedy them for years, but the first
business will be to select able Free
holders sufficiently conversant with the
present evils of city government to
frame a practical and honest charter.
BROWN ROASTS

BERKELEY, Jan. 21.â The University j

"The University of California Is not

What we want is men, and we must have
at least 150 candidates out on the track."
Track Manager Melville Dozier. Harry
B. Torrey. Trainer Al Lean and Professor
George C. Edwards also spoke. "We lost
the football game last Thanksgiving
day," said Professor Edwards, "because
our boys didn't know football. We won
on the track last year because we had
the proper system of training. 'Let us
keep up this tradition and we will win

WARRANT FOR DON COHEN.
Charged With Battery Upon a
Woodchopper Who Was Word
ing for the City.
ALAMEDA. Jan. 21.â A warrant was
sworn out this afternoon for the arrest of
Don Cohen, one of the sons of the late
A. A. Cohen, on a charge of assaulting
one Q. Andrada, a poor woodchopper em
ployed by the city. Some time ago the
city trustees directed that the eucalyptus
trees on Lincoln avenue in front of the
Cohen property be removed in conformity
with the general ordinance governing
such matters. The Cohens resisted the
order by legal proceedings, but were de
feated in the courts. Then the board no
tified the Cohens to remove the trees,
modifying the order, however, by saying
that if twenty feet were taken off the tops
it would be sufficient. No attention was
paid to the matter, and after due time
Street Superintendent Frodden was in
structed to remove them. He employed a
woodchopper named Q. Andrada to d"o the
work, Riving him in return therefor the
wood in the trees in lieu of coin wages.
Andrada cut the trees and corded up the
wood all ready for removal. Just then
Don Cohen came with a team and pro
ceeded to load up the wood and cart it off
to his own house. Andrada protested to
no avail and then sought advice from the
City Attorney. He then returned to the
wood and sat down on the pile. Cohen
continued to load it up in the wagon, and
when he reached Andrada the assault oc
curred for which the warrant for Cohen's
arrest was issued by Justice Morris.

May W Again Administered
Sound Drubbing to Tea
Rose JII.
Conley In Front With Our Climate at
Good Odds â Favorites First on
Three Occasions.
At last, It would seem, Buck Massle
is himself again and yesterday treated
racegoers at Oakland to an exhibition
of speed in the mile and sixteenth that
made him a dreaded one In thÂ© stake
division a year or so ago. The condi
tions allowed him in at 114 pounds and
the generous price of 9 to 10 was pro
curable about him. The Roman, asked
to carry equal weights with Murphy's
brown horse, was second choice In the
betting and again demonstrated that
105 pounds suits him much better. The
track was deep and slow, but it didn't
matter to Buck. "Skeets" Martin al
lowed him to step along out in front,
and he won with his tongue hanging
out in 1:48. Ostler Joe. considering the
fact that he carried 117 pounds, ran a
splendid race, leading The Roman out
fcrr the place. From this time on it
looks as though, barring accidents, the
Hanover horse would take a whole lot
of beating. Tom Cromwell, the only
other starter, was never a contender.
Aside from this event the sport was
very ordinary. Favorites divided hon
ors with longer-priced ones in the bet
ting, carrying off three purses.
It looks very much as though the
fleet Calgary mare May W had the "In
jun sign" on Tea Rose. They came to
gether again in the last race of the day.
a five and a half furlong dash, and
leading from the start May "W, with
Eddie Jrmes in the saddle, won with ap
parent ease. To be* sure. Tea Rose,
who_JH'as a slight favorite in the ring,
did not get away from the post as well
as usual and was unfortunate In get
ting pocketed, but from the general
complexion of the race she could
hardly have reversed the decision. I
Don't Know ran a clever race, finish
ing in the show.
Zamar seems to have regained all tf
his old-time speed' that a year ago, or
more, made him the iron-plated wonder
of the selling plater division. He was
one of eight starters in the opening .six
furlong sprint and was courted by
nearly all of the exclusive set, going
to the post equal choice with Official.
Conlpy got him away in the lead and
under restraint all the way, won easily
from Oaliente, the third choice. Official,
outfootÂ«Â»d fmm the jump, was third.
Aquinas was made a 3 to 2 favorite
for the seven-furlong run and failed to
finish among the first three. Spenr-^r

E. W. BUSHNELL WINS.
He Will Secure Payment Prom the
Rentor) Coal Company.
A decision rendered by the Supreme Court
yesterday will be of som.- fnterest to
people well known in this city and Ala
meda County. E. \V. Bushneil was for
eight years the president of the Renton
Coal Company, of which A. K. Simpson
was one of the largest sharehoHr-rs.
When he took that position he was to
have a salary of $150 per month. Evident
ly not being In straitened circum
stances Mr. Bushnell did not draw down
his salary regularly, and in this way a
large sum of money accumulated to his
credit. When the time came for the final
settlement there was a dispute between
him and Mr. Simpson, who claimed that
i.nrW a private arr.inprement between
hlm?e!f and the president the latter was
nnly to receive $100 per month and not
$15f>. as nt first np-reed.
Mr. Bushnell suod Mr. Simpson and
others for the sum of $4300. money which
he had left undr.twn in the hands of the
company, figuring at the rate of $150 per
month. He won in the, Superior Court
and the judgment was upheld by the
higher court, the justices claiming that
th<^ books do not show any record of the
$100 per mon'h proposition.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1898.
A NEW TRICK
OF FOOTPADS
How Thugs Ply Their
Nefarious Trade in
Dark Streets.
Gas Lamps Extinguished That
Their Purpose May Be
Accomplished.
Police Notified smd m Strict Watch
Will Bo Kept for LÂ»Â»te
Pedestrians.
For the past few nights it has been
noticed that the street gas lamps have
been extinguished during the hours
between 1 and 3 o'clock in the morn-
Ing by unknown parties. This has espe
cially been the case on Ellis street, be
tween Jones and Larkln, where many
holdups and robberies have lately
taken place. A milkman whose name
Is kept secret has complained of many
scares within the past few nights, and
he claimed to have witnessed a daring
attempt at burglary the night previous
to his report.
Complaints have also been heard
from Halght street. In the district near
Octavia, and the police are in a quan
dary to account for the lights going
out. although it is thought desperate
characters do the act, that their plun
dering and robbery may be made the
easier thereby.
It is reported that the past few hold
ups In those districts have been ac
complished where no street lamps
burned, and the reason for the fact Is
about becoming plain to the Chief of
Police and detectives at the City Hall.
Just where the criminals who are still
at large will ptop Is a question for the
police to determine, but the general
public will undoubtedly be kept In a
nervous strain during the determina
tion.
IS SOL BERLINER
A KLONDIKE MINER?
Many of His Friends Say That
He Was Never in the
Yukon Region.
A Current Rumor That Ho Dealt
Faro In tho City of
Seattle.
Solomon Berliner Is thinking very seri
ously Just at present whether there Is any
true felicity In this vale of tears.
Solomon returned from Seattle two
â¢weeks ago and claims he lias been so
jouminp in the region of the Klondike.
This his friends stoutly deny, making no
Meret of their suspicions and telling
them freely to Berliner, and averring that
he was never In the Klondike, and no
farther north than a faro table at Seat
tle. This expressed unkindness on the
part of his friends has caused Sol no
end of trouble and hard rumination In
tryin-r to devise a lucid and graphic story
of his trip to the Yukon. In order to per
suade them that they are in the wrong.
But his efforts In this direction seem
fruitless, as his friends refuse to give
them the least credence.
When So! arrived in the city from the
north (how far north it is at present
difficult to Mate, as so many conflicting
stories are told hy his friends) he went
to one of the largest hotels in the city
whore he welcomed his friends with ail
the lavishness and apparent wealth of a
second Croesus. Expense with Sol at this
time seemed to be but a secondary con
sideration, and his friends claim that he
throw his money around tÂ£Â» various col
ored bottles on the Baldwin sideboard
with a liberality seldom seen in this
quarter of the big hotel.
Since this night Solomon has found the
necessity of walking in the way of pru
and exercising strict economy and
consequently he has seldom been
around the lobby of the hotel since the
memorable night of free liquid refresh
ment.
Rumor has spread and reports have be
come current that Berliner, instead of be
ing the wealthy man that he posed, has
come down from Seattle with the- avowed
purpose of making money by selling
Klondike claims In tho interest "of others
thereby receiving a commission for his
services. This, however, he flatly denies
maintaining that he is down in the city
on a mission of love, and not on a matter
of business.
Sol Is a story teller, and no mean one
at that, and his glibness and eloquence in
telling an adventure are remarked upon
by his friends generally as being 1 truly
wonderful. But his enthusiasm In this
direction, so K. J. Wilbur says, seems to
have gained the mastery over his dis
cretion, as the story he tells in connec
tion- with a number of nuggets taken from
his claims In the Klondike falls wide of
the mark of carrying conviction with it
to the minds oT his friends, who claim
that he had these nuggets in h!s posses
sion before he left th.- city.
Through this little oversight regarding
the nuggets Mr. Berliner has been given
the laugh by his friends until life seems
almost a burden to him. Mr. Berliner has
found the immediate necessity of a return
to the north, and will leave the city early
next Tuesday morning.
COUNTERFEITER KENDALL.
His Preliminary Examination Con)
menced Before Judge
Conlan.
The preliminary examination of Gil
bert B. Kendall, alias Richard F. Kerby,
charged with having counterfeit tools
and counterfeit coin in his possession,
was commenced before Judge Conlan
yesterday morning.
Detective Dillon, one of the arresting
officers, was the first witness. He testi
fied to arresting the defendant in his
room, 434 Golden Gate avenue, and find
ing a number of counterfeit gold pieces,
molds, tools and other articles used in
the counterfeiting business in the room.
All the articles were produced in court
and identified by the witness.
Mrs. Kenny, the landlady of the house,
testified to renting the room to the de
fendant, who said his name was Kim
ball. When he took possession of the
room none of the articles produced in
court was in it. The defendant had pos
session of the room for about two weeks
and one time was absent for three or
four days.
Mrs. Anderson, 14 Turk street, testified
that the defendant engaged a room ut
her house and gave her a $5 gold piece in
payment and she gave him $4 in silver as
change. The gold piece was produced
and proved to be bogus. She positively
identified the defendant.
The further examination was then con
tinued till next Tuesday. Secret Agent
Harris was an Interested listener to the
proceedings.
The New Cold Fields.
In another column of the paper will
be found the notice of the expedition to
sail on April 25 to Kotzebue Sound
Captain B. Cogan of 44 East street wili
command in person the Al clipper bark
Alaska. The reports of the country
from the native Indians and the United
States Government officials show that
the country is full of gold. Two pros
pector* have Jupt arrived from this
new district with $30,000 in nuggets.

WORKS FOR
HIS COOLIES
Labor Commissioner
Struck by a Sin
gular Delusion.
Fancies He Can Fool the
Democratic Central
Committee.
Trying to Induce Its Members
to Resolve in Favor of
Annexation.
DEMOCRATS ARE ANGRY.
They Cite the Fact That Represent!
tlvea at Washington and at Homo
Oppose the Scheme.
LÂ»abor Commissioner Fitzgerald Is
particularly busy. Ever since he un
dertook the task of annexing- Hawaii,
â with its thousands of coolie workmen
little above slaves, he has kept himself
employed. Yesterday, however, he was
sprinting around the corridors of hotels
buttonholing gentlemen from interior
towns. Having secured a grip and for
cibly borrowed unwilling ears, !
he poured into them some fervid words.
For be it known the Commissioner had
been struck by a thought. In his mind
he could see his coolies annexed and
flooding the State.
The gentlemen he was chasing were
members of the Democratic Central
Committee. They are to meet next
Baturday, and are already drifting In
so as to be able to enjoy Jubilee week.
Fitzgerald has an idea he can induce
them to adopt a resolution indorsing
annexation and calling upon Califor
nia's Democratic members in Congress
to vote for it. Where Fitzgerald got
this remarkable notion has not been ex
plained, and that it will in all likeli
hood be rudely knocked out of him
does not need to be explained.
Senator White has not only declared
against the Dole-Morgan-Huntington
scheme, but is looked upon as a tower
of strength in opposing it. His voice
has been raised in no uncertain tone,
and even a proposition from so dis
tinguished a source as Fitzgerald might
fail to change his views all at once.
Congressman Maguire and Congress
man De Vrles take the same stand as
the Penaur. This being the attitude
of California Democrats at the capital,
the magnitude of the Fitzgerald con
tract can be appreciated and a sugges
tion of its ch^ekiness revealed.
Governor Budd is against annexa
tion and in this is upheld by a great
majority of the Democratic coast pa
pers. The position taken by the Ex
aminer is of no moment as that sheet
Is not recognized as Democratic and is
in no sense regarded as a leader nor a
safe adviser.
Personally the L.abor Commissioner,
it is said among politicians, can exer
cise no influence, as he is believed to
have used the cloak of office to cover
an expedition to the islands not taken
for the purpose of subserving the in
terests of labor, but exactly the con
trary. Much indignation is expressed
among Democrats over the misdirected
zeal which if not absurdly futile would,
they affirm, tend to put the chosen rep
resentatives of the party In an awk
ward predicament.
COAKLEY TURNS
STATE'S EVIDENCE
.Accuses Dr. Samuel Hall of
Having Caused the Death
of His Wife.
Chargo of Murder Against Him Was
Then Dismissed by the Dis
trict Attorney.
John Coakley, husband of Mrs. Ida
Coakley, whom. It Is alleged, was mur
dered by Dr. Samuel H. Hall, turned
State's evidence yesterday and accused
the defendant of having performed the
operation that caused the death of his
wife. The confession of Coakley dropped
like a thunderbolt on the head of the de
fendant, but he will fight the case to the
end. In the proceedings against Dr. Hall
lest Thursday Coakley was put on the
Btand, but nothing of importance could be
â wrung from his lips. When he left the
stand the prosecution stated that it had
closed Its case, end in consequence a con
tinuance was granted until yesterday
morning. Thursday evening, however.
Coakley signified a desire to turn State's
evidence, and when the case against Hall
was called yesterday morning Assistant
District Attorney Hinkle asked the court
to permit the reopening of the prosecu
tion that Coakley might be further ex
amined.
The defense objected, but Judge Dunne
overruled the objection and allowed
Coakley to be called to the stand. Coak
ley then nervously walked to the witness
chair and took a seat. The prosecuting
attorney questioned him regarding the
operation that caused his wife's death.
The witness answered that his wife went

EVERY HUMOR
CHINATOWN IN GAUDY ARRAY
The Great Event of Orientals, the Mongolian New Tear, Is Here in
All Its Glorious Color and Raiment.
A DAY AMONG THE CELESTIALS.
It'H only a step from the rnmor of TOamy and Play to the Orient these days. Turn to the north, walk a block, and
you'll find yourself spiritually as far away from this prosaic Western world as the bronzes and ivories In the shop windows
of Dupont street are out of keeping with the Klondike outfits Just a block below.
The uncertainty In the Chinese mind as to which day, the 21st or the 22d, is really the birthday of the new year has
had its usual effect. San Francisco's Chlnatowa will celebrate two days lnst<ad of one, and the visitor to Chinatown will
have the opportunity of seeing- his yellow brother in a new and very becoming light.
It is a fact that John Chinaman, like his paler neighbor, changes his role with his robe. The potent influence of
clothes, as well an the genial holiday spirit, is evidenced in the altered atmosphere of Chinatown. All the stores are closed
and from the Jutting- porches above hang great lanterns, globular and hexagonal, paper and silk and gauze, bright red and
brilliantly parti-colored, or a soft color medley of all delicate shades. When these are lighted at night time, Chinatown is
transformed. The light Is not s<> strong as to reveal the dirt and compact squalor of the place, but It is warm and subdued
and lends an air of enchantment to what we San Franciscans know well enough Is anything but beautiful.
Hut if you visit Chinatown nt night you'll miss the most Interesting spectacle of Chinese New Yonr. For the quaint
little Oriental bablea will be asleep, and they're the stars that light Chinatown by day and rival in attractiveness the glow
ing lanterns at night. â¢ "
li's ono of the prettiest sights Imaginable to stand on the crowded sidewalk of one of those dirty, dark streets, to
watch a dingy door burst open and suddenly, and one of these Celestial fireflies dart forth with all the activity that follows
release from a chrysalis. Such gorgeous young peacocks are these, so graceful and unashamed of their finery, with not a
particle of the American boy's dis<l:uti for i>r.tty things, half affected, half real. These Chinese boys wear thÂ«Â»ir brilliant
New Year robes as adornment should be wornâ with an unconscious ease and yet an added grace that forbids the ana
chronism of inappropriate bearing.
Here's a 4-year-old, probably. Tie wears a purple silk under-garment with a cherry-red loose vest above. His trous
ers are green, his embroidered cap is topped with a red button and a long red tassel depends from it, whose fringe mingles
with the red-fringed cord that lengthens his neatly braided queue and touches the heels of the link embroidered boxes of
slippers he wears. The joyous atmosphere of the time and thf (laming hues of his fine attire hay*> gone to his little round
head, and he dances about, flitting from place to place with the reasonless enjoyment of the but'ertly.
On the street corners peddlers with groat swaying strings of balloons are stationed. Papa John is generous and amia
ble these days. }fr- buys an opaque yellow globe for his Orst-born, that adds Just the tinge of color the baby's dress
lacked. This young Celestial prince wears black of the finest, the silkiest. His round cap. though, is gold-embroidered and
so are his shoes. He takes the string of the balloon between his small Ivory fingers as clumsily, as stupidly as any white
baby, and the great tragedy of babyhood comes to him as to mother's white-fared darling a block or so away. The string
Flips from him and the balloon, made golden now by the sun's light shining through, soars up and away. away. But New
Year's comes but once a yearâ that is, when one's superiors are considerate enough to leave the divine calendar unchangedâ
and affable Papa John buys another.
Here's an Italian organ grinder making the aJr hideous with "Marching Through Georgia," while from upstairs of the
Chinese theater conifs the rattle, the squeak and the crash that betoken great essays In the dramatic art. The organ
grinder has a monkey, an intelligent, eager-eyr-d little fellow with a bright cap upon his hea.l. And before him. gazing up.
all unconscious of thf? charming picture thoy present, are three little maids, each a symphony ( .' colors. Choy Sing to the
right is a poem in shades of lavender. Wong Fa in the middle is gorgeous in pink and blue, rtie blue appllqued over the
pink in zigzags, and the little pink troupers edped with blue again. Mademoiselle at this end Is a lovely thing, whose green,
gold-embroidered Mouse falls stiffly over the pink and blue trousers below. They all wear th>ir waxed hair in a chic
bunch on the side, just where one longs to let it straight, done up in a wonderful net, beaded and pearled; and each innocent,
expressionless, almond-eyed face Is framed in a sort of wide fillet flaming with color and covered with pearly beads,'
from which flirting, rose-colored ribbons hang and flaunt gayly out on the breeze. Shamelessly painted and rice-powdered!
with slender eyebrows traced and blackened, are these baby faces. Only there can be no shame where such perfect Innocence
abideth.
Through the slits where commonplace business letters ordinarily are passed by Uncle Sam's postmen, long-nailed
fingers are poking cherry-colored Flips of paperâ John's New Year's card. John himself, though he spends the fuilness of
his love for gaudy colors on his children, stands here smoking a cigar, that looks like a good dear, so enjoyingly does he
smoke It. He is clothed in an over-vest of f-mbossr-d blue wadded silk. His blouse, whose skirts sweep far below the ordi
nary length of blouses, is a vivid greenish gold, and his trousers are green as only Chintse truus rs and California's hills
dare to be.
A door opens and an old Chinese bows out two of his visitors. There's Oriental courtesy for you and Oriental grace,
too. One doesn't recognize John, he Is so noble, so fine a gentleman. He stops before a little stand on which are Chinese
candies, heaps of sugary white and molasses brown and soft-shelled nuts. And John, like the grand seigneur he Is, buys a
quantity to bestow with sundry dimes upon the children of the next house where he is to call. Further on he meets a fine
looklng young Chinaman, with a creamy pale tan face full of intelligence. He wears an upperg-arment of deep, heavy garnet
silk, richly embosso*!, and beneath the p.ik- lavender of his trousers fades away lntothe white of his stockings and the green
embroidered slippers. They shake hands with all cordiality, each with himself, the right hand of each pressing his own
left hand with a genial warmth there is no mistaking.
"Goon Hay â Congratulations! Fat Choi â Good luck!"
And they stand for a moment behind a telegraph pole .that lavender trousers may light his cigar at the glowing spark
behind which pea-green trousers placidly puffs. Then another warm handshake, a strictly limited affair as before, where
my right clasps not your right, but my own left, in hearty goodfellowship; and then a courteous bow and each of us sails
down street, his silken robes streaming gallantly in the soft wind.
They walk well, too, these gorgeous Eastern gentlemen, as men In knightly costume on the stage doâ no, aa they ought
and do not. Â»
In the restaurants quantities of tea are being consumed and pleasant things being said nnd the compliments of the
season exchanged. The balconies are cleaned and decorated and hung with heavy red tassels and tinseled flowers and
Chinese lanterns. From above a placid-faced Celestial looks down upon the crowded street; and from the street he ap
pears not the John we know, but the noble Oriental of some fairy tale.
John's lady Is a marvel of elegance, too. She totters across the cobble stones arrayed In blue embroidered in pink and
white. Her face is painted Into a doll-like placidity. She, too. wears her hair bunched iriitatingly on the side and the
tinsel ornaments quiver as she hobbles along, her slanting eye meekly cast down and her small taDerimr flnirers hidden in
the capacious sleeves of her blouse.
The great Joss houses are stiff and stately with gold, and the gloomy god crouches back In the dusk behind the altar
where perfumed tapers burn, smelling of sandalwood. All prayers have been said here early in the morning You'll buy
your little worthless package of punks for 25 cents, which Is a graceful Oriental way of charging an entrance fee and
you'll give it to the first soft-faced Chinese child you meet on your way down town and back to the West
Just before you cross the frontier.though, you'll stop a moment to watch three or four -mall Chinese gentlemen
none of whom has seen more than perhaps three New Years. They are gorgeously arrayed in orange and cold and oea
green and purple, and odd as it may seem, the combination of colors is no more offensive to the eve than it Is In a Deacocks

strutting and cooing about each other. First one bows and then another .and then they all bow lower and lower more

ity to those of the old regime. So with the quaintest, Eastern gravity they bow and bow. like little nodding mandarins out

But here's a white woman with more nickels than she knows what to do with. She comforts him with B cents and

to the office of Dr. Hall for the express
purpose of submitting to a criminal oper
ation. Coakley accompanied her, and he
said that jn answer to his question the
defendant told him that there would be
no danger in his wife submitting to the
operation. Mrs. Coakley, the witness
continued, then went Into the operating
room and returned in a few minutes, ac
companied by Dr. Hall, who said that she
would be well in a few days. In place of
recovering, however, Mrs. Coakley be
came worse and died in a few days.
Question after question had to be asked
the witness to get him to tell ail he knew
about the commission of the crime, and
his demeanor impressed all who listened
to his story that he was more interested
In his own welfare than in the fate of his
wife. When he left the stand a motion
was made by the assistant District At
torney that the charge of murder against
I'uaklpy be dismissed. Judge Dunne then
ordered the charge against him with
drawn from the calendar and the prisoner
discharged. This was done, and the man
whose words had opened to him the
gates of a prison looked greatly relieved.
Whether or not Coakley"s evidence will
have gTeat weight with the Jury remains
to be seen. His confession of yesterday
was hardly compatible with many state
ments ho has made one and off the stand,
and it may not have the weight with the
twelve men who now hold the fate of Dr.
Hall In their hands the prosecution would
like. Another weak point is that the wit
ness did not see the operation performed.

and his knowledge of it as merely hear
say.
After Coakley left the stand the de
fense made its opening statement. Dr.
Webster of Oakland was then put on the
stand as an expert. He testified to the
fact that the wound that is said to have
caused Mrs. Coakley's death might have
been administered a week or more prior
to her taking off. According to the
statement of Coakley on the stand the
operation was performed but two days
prior to the death of his wife, and the
suddenness of her death, in the opinion
of the physician, might have been brought
about by some constitutional difficulty
augmented by the effects of such an oper
ation as it is claimed was performed on
Mrs. Coakley. Death in such cases sel
dom results as quickly as Coakley claims,
the physician testified, unless some other
cause or disease existed. The defense
still is confident that the case is not lost,
and believes that matters will look much
brighter for Dr. Hall when their side of
the case is ready for the deliberation of
the Jury.

J. G. Maloney Makes
Some Very Seri
ous Charges.
The County Official Will
Appear Before the
Grand Jury.
Ex- Employes of the Opinion
That All Is Not Well in
the Rotunda.
WHAT WILL IT RESULT IN?
City Officials Will Anxiously Watch
the Case for Startling Devel
opments.
"â¢Tie Grand Jury has a case on hand
based on flection 2 of the statutes,
1871-2, act 951. which will without doubt
cause them an amount of worry even
though the case presented results only
In the reprimanding of one Individual.
For weeks past there has been a dis
turbance In the air and questions have
been asked as to what was the trou
ble, but no Information was forthcom
ing. Now it is learned that John G.
Maloney, living at 4105 California street,
has preferred charges against County
Recorder Glynn. and he bases his
charges on the above sections.
For the past few months Maloney has
worked In the Recorder's office and
claims that he knows what he is about
and his statement is believed by his
brother workers. Although Maloney
was dismissed from the local police
force for having bitten off an ear be-
longing to an officer by the name of
Field, his statement is not weakened
thereby. At any_rate the charges have
been sent to the Grand Jury and ac
tion will be taken at the next meet
ing.
Mr. Maloney said last evening: "I
first preferred charges against the Re
corder in a written statement to the
Mayor. James D. Phelan, but receiving
no satisfaet<.ry reply I concluded that
I would speak in a place where I would
at least be heard. Accordingly I no
tified the Grand Jury of many actions
of Mr. Glynn. and I think an action will
he taken which will not result favorably
to the man I believe is guilty of mis
conduct.
"I went to the Recorder's office
three years ago and have seen many
things which have made me suspicious
regarding the honesty of the Recorder.
Each month our warrants are put in
and many times we have discovered
that an amount over what we have
called for has been placed before us.
After a time we discovered that our
warrants had been overdrawn and that
the amounts went into the hande of the
Recorder. \
'â¢It was also seen that there were a
few pets in the office who received
much more than should have been
given. For instance, Clark got $54 for
four days' work, as did Harrison $56,
Zimmerman $57, and Silvey $57, for four
days' work. lam under the impres
sion that the employes did not receive
the whole amount which they had
drawn. I ampositively aware of the
fact that the Recorder has signed war
rants which he knew were not correct,
and I will give him a chance to pnve
that I am wrong.
"He has also taken money from us.
presumably for his own use, by asking
us for a donation toward the making
of the boulevard. The amount re
ceived would figure up about $400, but
we see nothing of it. nor even an ac
knowledgment that we have given the
money. When our warrants are raised
we get the sum due us and some one
who is in the office gets the rest
through the broker. Kampe, who is
connected with the Grand Jury. I am
under the impression that that is one
reason why we cannot procure Justice
in this matter.
"Cooney. who is related to the Re
corder, has a finger in the pie, accord-
Ing to my information, and I am anx
ious to see where it will all end. The
employes gave un about $400 to help
fight the election in behalf of Glynn.
but after it was declared no contest by
the Supreme Court we never received
a cent of our money. Some interesting
facts will pop at the next meeting of
the Grand Jury, and T believe Glynn
is awaro of the fact. T base my chargos
on the code which states that 'Every of
ficer of the State or arty county. ci*y
or township therein who keeps or re
tains any part or portion of the salary
or fee allowed by law to his deputy
clerk, or subordinate officer, is guilty
of a felony,' and I claim that raising
warrants and otherwise keeping what
by law belongs to his subordinates is a
violation of the code."
PIONEER AND MINER.
SKetch of the Successful Career
of Isaac L. Requa.
Chief among the men who have aided
materially In the development of the
great mining resources of California
none Is more conspicuously prominent
than Isaac L. Requa. This gentleman
has been identified with all the prin
cipal mining companies in the State,
and on questions pertaining to this
subject he is a recognized authority.
Mr. Requa is a man of great force of
character and a shrewd business man,
qualities which* have enabled him to
amass a very considerable fortune.
Mr. Requa is 65 year* of age, but he
is as active as many men of 30. He
arrived in San Francisco in ISSO and at
once engaged In mining. He was at
various times superintendent of the
Union Mill and Minin< Company of
Virginia City, Chollar, Potosi. Norcross
and Savage mines. He succeeded in sink
ing a vertical shaft 3250 feet in the Sav
age mine, which was in many respects
a wonderful feat. He remained in Vir
ginia City until 18^3, when he removed
to his present home in Oakland. At the
present time, besides holding large in- j
terests in many valuable mining prop
erties, Mr. Requa is president of the
Central Pacific Railway and of the
Oakland Bank of Savings. He owns
one of the handsomest residences
across the bay and is known socially
as a most hospitable entertainer.
Among the builders of this great com
monwealth Mr. Requa holds a high
place.

Burglary at Franklin
and Washington
Streets.
The Residence'of William
Burke Thoroughly
Ransacked.
Two Ex-Convicts Enter the
House Unknown to the
Servant Girl.
STEAL VALUABLE JEWELS
A Portion of Their Booty Is Found
in a Mission Street Pawn
shop.
Detectives Sllvey andÃyram are look
ing for a brace of clever burglars who
entered the residence of William Burke
at Washington and Franklin streets,
and stole Jewelry and silverware valued
at $1000. An entrance was effected by
opening the front door with a skeleton
key. Mr. Burke and his family were
absent, having gone to the theater. In
the house at the time were the servant
and a sick woman, who was a friend of
Mrs. Burke. The former was sitting
in the kitchen when the burglars en
tered. After opening the front door, un
known to the servant, they quietly
walked upstairs to the bedroom occu
pied by Mrs. Burke. With the aid of a
"jimmy" they broke open the bureau
drawera, taking a miscellaneous assort
ment of jewelry and silverware, belong
ing to the family. The burglars, after
securing the booty, walked downstairs
and emerged from the house without
disturbing the occupants.
It was not until Mr. Burke and his
wife returned to their home that they
discovered that the house had been en
tered by burglars. They at once re
ported the burglary to the police, and
Silvey and Byram were detailed to ar
rest the house-breakers.
Last night the detectives found some
of the stolen silverware in a pawnshop
on Mission street, where it had been dis
pqsed of by the burglars. They took
It to police headquarters and turned it
over to Captain 80-hen.
From the description given of the
men who disposed of the stolen prop
erty the detectives are convinced that
they are two ex-convicts, who were re
cently released from San Quentin after
serving a short sentence for burglary
committed in this city.
Last evening the description of the
burglars was read off to the officers of
both stations with instructions to ar
rest them if found. They are regarded
as desperate characters, and likely to
resort to murder if cornered while com
mitting a crime.

cruiser Chitose will have nrrwine dripping
from its prow when it takes its first dip
in the waters of the bay this morning.
According to Japanese custom, as the
wine bottle breaks on the iron front two
doves will be released. The ladies think
the freeing of the birds will constitute
enough ceremony. They would have no
wine spilled, but would desire the office
for which Miss Budd has been selected
purely honorary. They have formulated
a protest, signed on behalf of the union
by B. Sturtevant Peet (president), Dorcas
J. Spencer (corresponding secretary) and
Rose M. French. This has been sent to
Irving M. Scott of the Union Iron Works.
It is as follows:
"The California Women's Christian
Temperance Union, ' speaking for
thousands of mothers of this State,
esteem it an honor to protest against
a long-established usage, and would
respectfully call your attention to the
Japanese custom of freeing a dove aa
a feature in the ceremony of launch
ing a ship. Wine is dangerous, too,
while the dove Is a world-recognized
emblem of peace. To free the dove
Instead of breaking a bottle of wine,
as is our custom -upon similar occa
sions, would be a happy innovation,
and at the same time complimentary
to the custom of the nation for whom
the ship to be launched January 22
1898, is constructed."
Letters, with copies of the protest, have
been sent to Miss L. Budd, niece of the
Governor, who is to christen the cruiser
to her mother, and also to Mrs. Irving
M. SCbtt; and It is pointed out that at
the christening of the Japanese cruiser
Kasagi at the Cramps' shipbuilding
yards rec.ently the breaking of wine was
dispensed with.
It Is not believed that any change in the
original programme will result from this
protest, as wine has always been used
on similar occasions at the Iron Works
without evil effect, so far as noticed. The
wine was observed to mingle with such
an expanse of water that it was hopeless
ly dilutedâ the water saline at that
A DESPERATE CHARACTER.
William Devine, an Ex-Corjvict
Held for Burglary.
William Devine, an ex-convict, was yes
terday held to answer before the Supe
rior Court by Judge Conlan on a charge
of burglary in $2000 bonds. He broke into
the Webb House on Second street and
stole a number of articles. There is an
other charge of burglary against him, to
be heard next week.
Devine's real name is Tom Desmond,
and he is looked upon by the police as a
desperate character. About ten y.ars
ago he broke into a jewelry store on
Market street and a few days later De
tective Bee discovered him In a pawn
shop on Fourth street trying to sell a
revolver. Bee placed him under arrest,
but he showed fight, and a desperate
struggle followed for possession of the
revolver. Desmond got Bee's right
thumb between his teeth and bit it to
the bone, and Bee carries the mark to
this day. Bee finally laid him out and
handcuffed him.
