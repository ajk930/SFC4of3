is to be linuled down at Santiago
at 9 o'clock to-morrow, the

down their arms and march out

Th<Â°se facts were made known to
the President to-night in a dis

It is understood from the dispatch
that Major General Shafter has at last
succeeded in obtaining the uncondi
tional surrender of General Toral and
all the Spanish troops in the eastern
part of Cuba.
The dlsp: eh was very gratifying to
the officials of the administration, who
had feared, because of an earlier '".'.s

had made conditions and held out hopes
to the Spanish commander not strictly
in accord with his explicit instructions
from Washington to agree to nothing
but an unconditional surrender with the

The "War Department posted the fol
lowing this afternoon:
"Playa, July 16, 1898.â Adjutant Gen
eral United States Army. Washington:
Headquarters, near Santiago, July 16â
The conditions of capitulation Include
all the forces and war material in the
described territory. The United States
agrees, with as little delay as possible,
to transport all .Spanish troops In the
district to the kingdom of Spain, the
troops, as far as possible, to embark
at the port nearest the garrisons they
now occupy. Officers to retain their
side arms and officers and men to re
tain their personal property. Spanish

who wish to remain in Cuba may do so,
under parole, during the present war,
giving up their arms. Spanish forces
to march out of Santiago with the
honors of war, depositing the arms by
mutual agreement to await the disposi
tion of the United States Government,
it being understood that the United
States Commissioners will recommend
that the Spanish soldiers return to
Spain with the arms they so bravely
defended. This leaves the question of
the return of the arms entirely In the
hands of the Government. I invite at
tention to the fact that against several
thousand of the surrendered (Gen
eral Toral says about 12,000), not a shot
has been fired. The return to Spain of
the troops in this district will amount
to about 24,000, according to General
Toral. W. R. SHAFTER,
"United States Volunteers."
The effect of this dispatch was rather
disappointing to the authorities here,
aa It was recognized that if General
Toral was to march out with the honors
of warâ a salute to the Spanish flag,
bands playing and colors flyingâ it
would not be. strictly speaking, an un
conditional surrender. There was also
some criticism of the statement that it
was understood that the American com
missioners would recommend that the
Spanish soldiers be allowed to carry
their arms back to Spain with them.
General Shafter's latest dispatch say-
Ing that the Spanish soldiers are to
give up their arms and march out of
Santiago as prisoners of war can only
be reconciled - lth these statements on
the assumption that he had another
conference with the Spanish officers
after writing his first dispatch and was
able to make more satisfactory terms
than at first.
It is possible the last dispatch still
contemplates the recommendation by
General Shafter that the Spanish troops
be allowed to take their arms back to
Spah. with them after they have ac
tually turned them over to the Ameri
can forces. If this is true, however, It
is probable that the administration will
concur in General Bhafter's recommen
dation. A member of the cabinet told
me to night that under no circum
stances would the Spanish troops be al
lowed to carry back to Spain a single
rifle, but no official announcement will
be made on this subject until the Span
ish arms are actually in the possession
of General Shaftor and It is known
whether or not he is to make a recom
mendation that they be returned.
It Is understood here that the reason
that General ToraJ was so anxious to
be permitted to carry his arms back to
Spain was that a large number of the
troops to be surrendered by him had
not been In the conflict with arms, and

Special Cable to The Call and tlie New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, July 16. â In view of the surrender of Santiago, which is known to have been
made use of by political agitators to stir up ill feeling, the Government wisely declared the
constitutional guarantees in abeyance. In other words, we are under martial law. The cen
sorship on all press matter has been doubly severe, and everywhere the military and civil
forces have been immensely strengthened. Doubtless much sensationalism will be manufac
tured out of this for exportation to the guileless editors of American and other newspapers,
but the cold truth is the Government has put into execution what it long contemplated and
what the abnormal condition of public spirit renders absolutely necessary.
There is no doubt to-night that the war is at an end, as I foretold days ago it would
be when Santiago fell. Whether internal troubles will result is a matter which time alone
can show, but the Government must be given credit for having loyally done its best to cope
with extraordinary difficulties. The Government has received notice from General Blanco
that the regular army under his command will submit to the desires of the Government. This
is a great point gained. The volunteers, he says, are resolutely opposed to peace,, but I
have reason to suppose it is more discreet not to give details, and that arrangements have
been made to overcome this difficulty.
Spain to-day, to the relief of all her most serious men, is in a position to seek terms
of peace from the United States. Whether the latter makes such terms as are possible of ac
ceptance by a chivalrous country remains to be seen. Upon the result much of the immedi
ate record of Spanish history depends. Events to-day have helped the Government to a
peaceful resolution. To-night the town is quiet and prepared for all emergencies.
that if these men should give up their
weapons without having used them at
all in battle with the American forces
their officers would be in danger of
severe punishment.
When the Spanish flag is hauled
down from Morro Castle at the en
trance to Santiago harbor the American
flag that will be raised in its place will
be one which was presented to Secre
tary Alger for that purpose by Michi
gan veterans of the civil war, and it is
expected there will be great rejoicing
amo-T the soldiers and sailors as well
as the firing of a salute by the ships
and shore batteries.
SCENES AND INCIDENTS
OF THE SURRENDER
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Rennett.
PLATA DEL. ESTE, Cuba, July 15,
via Hayti cable. -Negotiations for the
capitulation of Santiago were con
ducted under the protecting shade of
a great tree between the lines. At the
first conference it was understood thnt
the Spanish officers si. .aid retain their
side arms only and that the soldiers
should surrender everything. On Fri
day, however, General Toral professed
Ignorance of such an understanding.
Rising and facing General Wheeler, he
made a dramatic appeal.
"You are an old soldier," he said,
"and have known the bitterness of be
ing compelled to yield to superior
forces. Show a soldier's generosity and
permit me to carry my honor with me
when I return. Except under such cir-
cumstances, I would inlinltel;- prefer to
inhabit a grave in yonder trenches."
General Wheeler seemed to be moved,
but he replied that the United States
felt already that great concessions had
been made In the Interest of humanity.
The policy of the war, he stated, was
to rid Cuba of the Spanish. The only
deviation from the usual terms which
obtain in an unconditifmal surrender
was the permitting of the Spanish army
to return to Spain. In this the com
missioners had pone against the senti
ment of the army. The terms, he de
clared, were honorable to General
Toral, who must bow gracefully to the
Inevitable.
Upon Toral Insisting, new articles
were drawn by General Wheeler's sec
retary. These somewhat modified cer
tain conditions and minor points. The
Spanish troops are to march to the
transports, carrying their arms and
piling them before embarking. A de
tail of American troops will be present
to receive them. General Toral regards
this as maintaining the outward form
of an honorable evacuation.
The details of the transportation of
the Spanish troops were discussed at
length. The outlying troops in General
Toral's division are to embark from
ports now occupied by them under the
same terms as the garrison of Santi
ago.
At dawn on Friday the refugees be
gan to pour out of Caney along the
road to Santiago. They had been in
formed they were at liberty to re
turn, bo gathered their few effects and
joyfully began the tramp through the
sticky, clinging mud.
General Wheeler, who was under the
impression that they were to be per
mitted to enter, stopped his conversa
tion with Toral long enough to Instruct
the orderly to telephone to General
Shafter Informing him that the
French Consul had entered Santiago
and inquiring as to the disposition of
the great mass of refugees. To
Wheeler's surprise Shafter ordered the
refugees detained. By the time I ar
rived at Caney a detail of Rough
Riders had established a picket line
and checked the stream of rag-ged, for
lorn humanity. Several thousand con
gregated at the rear of our line and
stood helplessly about in the mud and
wet gra,ss, not knowing' whither to
turn. Behind was Caney with fever
and famine, before Santiago with at
least shelter.
All day the crowd sweltered. Some
turned back, but the majority sank at
the roadside In a sort of pitiable uncer
tainty â miserable shuttlecocks of the
war since Wednesday.
The arrest of a number of commis
sary officers for improper disposition of
rations confirms the criticism of the
service afforded that branch. This ac
tion was taken by General Shafter last
night ponding an Investigation. It is
charged that supplies destined for the
sick and wounded have been sold with
out warrant. There are many com
plaints among the troops of lack of
food.
ARMS SURRENDERED
WILL BE RETAINED
WASHINGTON, July 16.â The arms
surrendered by the Spaniards at San
tiago to General Shafter will be kept
by the United States Government. This
conclusion, reached late this afternoon
by the President and Secretary Alger,
was made public by the latter as he
left his office after 6 o'clock to-night
for hiÃ home.
"All those who have arms will turn
them over to this Government. This
is final."
These were the Secretary's words
when asked for Information.
"And," he added, in response to fur
ther inquiry and to dear any doubt
that might exist on the subject, "tha
rifles will not be returned to Spain."
" This decision, no doubt, already has
been communicated to General Shafter.
Up to the time when Secretary Alger's
emphatic statement disposed of all
doubt on the rr-tter, it was thought In
some quarters that consideration might

CAROLINES
Monitor Monterey to Hoist
t!}e Stars and Stripes
Over tfye Islands.
NEW YORK, July 16.â A Washington special to the
Herald says: It is practically admitted in naval circles that the
report that the monitor Monterey will take possession of the
Caroline Islands is correct. It is believed in naval circles that
she will have the same experience in taking possession of the
Caroline Islands as did the Charleston in the case of the La
drones. Captain Glass of the Charleston was thanked by the
Governor of Gnahan, it will be remembered, for saluting the
Spanish flag, and he stated that he was unable to return the
salute because he had no powder. The Carolines are believed
to be in practically the same condition.
The Monterey will take to Manila as prisoners of war the
Governor and such other officials of the Spanish Government as
may be deemed advisable.
be Klven to the appeal made by General
Toral in behalf of his men that they be
allowed to keep their arms. In fact, It
was said by a high department official
that the President would await the
recommendation of the United States
Commissioners to the surrender on the
subject before disposing 1 of the ques
tion, especially as General Shafter had
tejegraphed the department that it was
understood the United States Commis
sion would recommend that the Spanish
soldiers return to Spain with the arms
they so bravely defended. This decis
ion of the President applies alike to
those Spanish soldiers who have not
been engaged with the United States
troops, as well as to those who have
been participants in the recent battles.

CHANGE OF
SENTIMENT
IN GERMANY
Berlin Journals Becoming
Friendly Toward This
Country.
CopyrlpMed, 189S, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, July 16.â The recent speech
c.f United States Embassador White is
gradually having a srood effect. The
tone of the German press, with the ex
ception of the rabid anti-Americans,
has distinctly changed. Many of the
newspapers which have hitherto been
unfriendly are now just the opposite.
Mr. White's Fourth of July oration has
also strengthened his position here. It
is understood that the withdrawal of
some of the German warships from
Manila was due to his pointing out
that the feeling of the Americans over
such a formidable array of German
ships in the harbor was one of sus
picion as to the intention of Germany.
An official of the Foreign Office, ex
plaining the attitude of the German
Government, said: "The presence there
of our warships was solely due to our
desire to protect German interests in
the Philippine Islands, which are too
large for one or two ships to protect
in the event of things going wrong, as
the presence oi ships at various points
at the same time might be necessary.
When they first appeared Admiral
Dewey was unable to land a force suf
ficiently strong to protect the foreign
ers from the semi-savage hordes of in
surgents, who were also a source of
danger to the Germans. In view of
the repeated assurance of neutrality on
the part of Germany and the friendly
returns existing between the two coun
tries the American suspicions are un
founded."
The correspondent here of the As
sociated Press is informed that General
Azcarragu, the former Spanish Minis
ter of War, is reported to be on a mis
sion, the object of which is to sound
the Cabinets of the Continental pow
ers on the subject of peace negotia
tions. He is not expected in Berlin.
The newspapers are discussing the
questions of the future of Samoa and

KAISER'S STRICT
INSTRUCTIONS TO
VON DEIDRICHS
Germao Admiral Is Not to Inter
fere in flny Way With
Dewey.
NEW YORK, July 16.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Emperor William's in
structions to Admiral Yon Deiderichs,
commanding the German fleet in the
Philippines, are strict and explicit. He
is prohibited from interfering in any
way with the operations Of the Ameri
can forces, but is simply to have his
ships available to provide German in
terests with adequate protection.
I am able to make this statement "m
the authority of a diplomat here who
enjoys the confidence of the German
Embassador and who is familiar with
the attitude of Germany respecting
American operations in the Philippines.
It is not going too far to say that the
administration has official knowledge
of the position of the Berlin Govern
ment and is satisfied of its correctness.
It is the claim of Germans here that
there is a general misunderstanding
in the United States of the position of
their Government, and they express
deep regret at the change of sentiment
among people, a great many of whom
are allied to Germany by ties of blood.
From the diplomat with whom I
talked I learned a great many impor
tant facts concerning Germany's policy
in relation to the Philippines and the
operations of the Americans against
them. This gentleman had seen con
siderable service in the far east and
he told me the most friendly relations
had always existed between the Ameri
can and German naval officers.
"You may be sure that Admiral yon
Diederichs will do nothing offensive to
the American people," he continued.
Five men-of-war were ordered to the
Philippines because Germany has large
Interests scattered throughout the
Islands and away from the protection
which would be afforded them by
American ships.
"JTh? insurgents have revolted
throughout the island of Luzon and the
neighboring islands, and Admiral yon
Dtederichs has naturally given direc
tion to some of the vessels under his
command to cruise along the coast,
putting in at various points where the
Germans have plantations, thus giving
them the assurance that their Govern
ment is looking out for their safety.
"The insurgents are a mixture of
Spanish and Malay, than which there
is nothing worse in the world, and are
apt to wreak vengeance upon any for
eigner whom they may run across.
"In the case of the cruiser Iren Â», her
commander prevented the insurgents
continuing their operations because he
was satisfied they would commit acts
of barbarity unless restrained by a for
eign warship. As soon as the cruiser
Raleigh and the gunboat Concord ap
peared the Irene, recognizing their
right to operate against the Spaniards
and appreciating that they would pro
tect foreign interests, withdrew.
"Thia action gave the Americans a
! newspapers accuse the Emperor of ex
: ceeding his powers in the appointment

Heavy rains have prevailed through
out Germany all the week and have
greatly damaged the crops in the flood

| severe in the Brunswick district, where

The Governor of the German colony
at Kiaochau Bay has asked the German
j merchants if they desire the introduc
tion there of the German customs tariff.
Some of the newspapers complain of
the favors shown American preserved
meats in the army and navy, to the
detriment of German meats.
Mr. White, our Embassador. was run
j over and somewhat injured by a bi
| cyclist near Brandenburg Gate on
I Tuesday. The officials of the embassy
have rented new offices at the corner
of ITnter den Linden and Schadow
streets, and will move in October. The
new quarters are larger and better
i adapted for the purpose.
In spite of Admiral Dewey's dispatch
I confirming the exclusive news of the
! Associated Press as to the conduct of
i the German warship at Subig Bay, a
! section of the German press still pro
fesses to disbelieve the Irene Incident.
The Cologne Gazette says: "The story
was got up by the Associated Press
with the deliberate purpose of produc
j ing enmity between .Germany and
America."
The Prussian frontier officials have
been ordered to prevent the importation
of American pork lacking the American

owing to the instructions of the Gov
j eminent at Washington to omit the

A statement having appeared in the

VOLUNTEERS COMPLAIN
OF THEIR RATIONS
Because of Their Protests a Battalion
Is to Be Removed From
Tacoma.
TACOMA, July 16.â Four hundred
men comprising the First Battalion of
the Second Washington Regiment are
to be moved from Tacoma next week,
probabl-" to Fort Walla Walla or Fort
Sheridan, in Eastern Washington.
Serious trouble has arisen over the
food served to the battalion, which for
two weeks has beezi encamped in the
Tacoma Exposition building. Many
volunteers have been making vigorous
complaints about the quality of the
food served them and the manner of its
serving. They allege that worm-eaten
meal, rancid meat and soggy potatoes
were given them after their arrival un
til their protests caused an investiga
tion.
Adjutant General Canton came over
from Olympia before the battalion was
mustered in and investigated the food
situation, finding that the facilities for
feeding the men had been improved
after they got settled. He examined
their food and pronounced It all right.
YeÃterday complaints broke out
anew, the soldiers declaring that poor
potatoes and soup containing numer
ous bugs and flies were served them.
Captain Taylor, the mustering officer,
who has had twenty-five years' exper
ience in the quartermaster's depart
ment, declares the food is of good qual
ity. He is acting with Adjutant Gen
eral Cantdn to have the battalion
moved from Tacoma next week. Ex
tended complaints made by the nen
have been printed in one of the local
papers, intensifying the officers' feel
ing that there would be trouble as
long as the battalion remained here.
The food complained of is furnished
by a local restaurateur, who receives
17 cents a meal. The merchants re
gret having the soldiers moved, because
thousands of dollars are distributed
here monthly while they remain.
The New Whatcom Company re
ceived two boxes of delicacies from
home and to-night is regaling itself

SHOT AND SHELLS
BEING HURRIED TO
WATSON'S SQUADRON
Magazines of Every Ship Will Be
Filled in Anticipation of Long
Absence.
WASHINGTON, July 16.â Secretary
Long has decided that Admiral Cer
vera may secure a parole if certain
details can be arranged, and he wishes
to do so. The admiral is expected with
his fellow officers and prisoners at An
napolis to-night.
Commander Brownson of the auxili
ary cruiser Yankee was in conference
with Secretary Long to-day, arranging
for the trip of his ship with a large
cargo of ammunition for Commodore
Watson's squadron in its attack on the
coast of Spain. The Yankee is at
Norfolk, and will sail to-morrow for
Santiago. She will reach there about
next Tuesday and the big stock of am
munition will then be placed upon the
battle-ships and cruisers. This trans
fer of powder and shells is a delicate
operation, requiring time, and it is prob
able that the week will be well along
before this and the recalling of the
Yankee will permit the squadron to
actually get under way for Spain.
Owing to the important mission of
Commodore Watson's squadron and its
possibility of long absence from an
American port, every magazine on the
ships w!ll be full when the ships sail.
Admiral Sampson recently made the
requisition for the ammunition sup
plies, as these had run low as a result
of the engagement with the Cervera
squadron and the frequent shelling of
Santiago. One load already has been
taken down on a supply ship, and the
Yankee now fills up the quota. Each
battle-ship will have about 200 tons of
powder, with fifty to seventy of the
largest 12-inch or 13-inch shells, ac
cording to the size of the big guns,
seventy to eighty 8-inch shells, 200 to
300 of the shells for six-pounders and
other medium sized guns, and 500 to
800 rounds for the small rapid fire guns.
The cruisers carry approximately the
same allowance, without the shells for
the 12 and 13 inch guns. Aside from
this equipment of shells, the squadron
ie well provided with solid armor-pierc
ing steel shot. There has been no call
for an additional supply of the armor
piercers, as Admiral Sampson's fleet
seems to have used very few of them
thus far, confining their work to the
big explosive Bhells. The latter, al
though not made for armir piercing,
are tested by the Navy Department to
pass through four inches of solid steel,
not exploding until through the steel.
They have done such execution that
Admiral Sampson had reserved almost
his entire stock of armor-piercing
shells.
The Navy Department will not set a
time for the departure of Commodore
Watson's squadron, but with the de
livery of the Yankee's supply of am
munition very few days will be lost
PRELIMINARY
MEETINGS OF THE
COMMISSIONERS
While Final Word Was Awaited
From Madrid Troops Remained
in the Trenches.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by tha Associated Press.
AT GENERAL WHEELER'S HEAD
QUARTERS, BEFORE SANTIAGO
DE CUBA, July 15, 10 a. m., via King
ston, Jamaica, July 16, 7:25 a. m.â The
preliminary basis of the capitulation of
the Spanish forces in Eastern Cuba was
agreed to and signed under a pictur
esque cieba tree half way between the
lines shortly after midnight. Our com
missioners were invited to enter the
city by those representing General
Toral, but the invitation was declined
and the conference was held under the
spreading cieba, just such a tree as
that under which Columbus assisted at
the celebration of mass on his first
landing in Cuba.
At the very outset a hitch occurred,
owing to a misunderstanding of what
was said at the personal interview be
tween General Shafter and General
Toral at noon. At that time our inter
preter, translating the language of
General Toral, had given Generals
Shafter, Miles and Wheeler distinctly
to understand that Captain-General
Blanco had consented that the Com
missioners should have plenary power
to negotiate the terms of surrender,
Buch terms as they agreed upon to be
binding upon both parties. Something
was said about a notification to the
Madrid Government, but General Shat
ter insisted that the capitulation had
been actually agreed to, and that no
further consent of the Madrid Govern
ment was required.
When the commissioners met shortly
after 2 o'clock in the afternoon those
in behalf of General Toral (General Es
cario, Lieutenant Colonel Fortan and
Robert Mason, the British Vice-Consul)
combated at once the idea that a cap
itulation had actually taken place. The
consent of Madrid, they insisted, was
still necessary, but, at the same time,
they claimed strongly that it would be
forthcoming as Captain - General
Blanco had advised it and the home
Government would agree. General
Toral, who was present, and who, in
fact, directed the negotiations on his
own behalf, said he had never been
overruled by the Captain-General. Still,
he added, until Madrid had sanctioned
it Santiago had not capitulated.
All this was extremely unsatisfactory
to our commissioners, who clung tena
ciously to the understanding General
Shafter had received earlier in the day.
Finally, with the question of whether
or not the Spanish forces had actually
surrendered still open, the commission
ers proceeded to the consideration of
the preliminaries.
Captain Miley had drawn up thirteen
articles of a general nature and these
were submitted to General Toral per
sonally. He made a strong appeal that
the word "capitulation" be used instead
of the harsher term "surrender," and
that his army be allowed to march out.
before this formidable squadron will be
headed for Spain.
ALL OUR BATTLE-SHIPS
MAY BE SENT TO SPAIN
Important Instructions Sent to Com-
modore Watson by Secre
tary Long.
NEW YORK, July 16.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Important instructions rela
tive to the organization of the eastern
squadron and its plan of operations
against Spain were intrusted this after
noon to Commander W. H. Brownson,
commander of the auxiliary cruiser
Yankee, for delivery to Commodore
Watson his commander-in-chief. These
instructions were considered and ap
proved this afternoon by Secretary
Long during a conference he had with
the Naval War Board.
The question of increasing the eastern
squadron was definitely determined. I
was told positively by an official in a
position to know that orders will be
issued within the next few days as
signing all the battleships to the east
ern squardon, provided Rear Admiral
Sampson ' makes no objection. Should
orders be Issued in accordance with the
information of the official who talked
with me. Commodore Watson will have
at his disposal these men-of-war: Bat
tleships Oregon, Massachusetts, lowa,
Indiana and Texas; protected cruisers
Newark and probably New Orleans,
Minneapolis and Columbia; auxiliary
cruisers Yankee, Yosemite and Dixie.
This will leave enough armored and
protected cruisers to conduct operations
against Porto Rico and defend the
American coast.
Secretary Long thoroughly appreci
ates the fact that no great amount of
damage can be done to Spanish cities
by American warships and that the
only result of a bombardment will be
of a moral character, designed to in
fluence the Madrid Government to sue
for peace. But the bombardment of
fortifications will result In a return fire
"from the Spanish guns, and it is deemed
desirable to have well-protected ships
participate in the attack. Therefore,
my informant stated, it is the desire
of the board to attach additional battle
ships to Commodore Watson's squad
ron.
There can be no question of the effect
of the appearance of such a force on
the Spanish coast. Admiral Camara,
with only one second-class battleship,
the Pelayo, and one first-class battle
ship, besides four torpedo-boat de
stroyers, a dozen torpedo-boats and
half a dozen auxiliary cruisers, will be
in a much worse plight than waa Ad
miral Cervera. His force is so vastly
inferior to Commodore Watson's com
mand that its annihlliation would be
complete even Jf it fought under the
guns of the Cadiz fortifications, from
which every effort will be made by
Commodore Watson to draw it.
the officers with their Bide arm 3 and
the men with their small arms. He
said the arms could afterward be sent
to Spain either on the ships with the
troops or on other ships. General Toral
further remarked that he expected our
commanders, as representatives of a
brave and chivalrous people, would not
seek to humiliate his army or make it
appear that he was vanquished. As
brave men his soldiers desired to go
home with honor. They had simply
yielded to superior force and they
would prefer dying to going home with
out their honor. Our commissioners
could not resist this appeal, but they
said it lay beyond the terms laid down
by our Government and they could only
recommend it to Washington.
At 4 o'clock General Toral returned
to the city to consult with General Li
nares. General Toral and the Spanish
commissioners returned at 6:30 o'clock
saying they desired a still further
change in the phraseology of the arti
cles and suggested a postponement un
til morning. This General Wheeler
firmly declined. Thereupon a recess
was taken until 9:30. The commission
ers returned at that hour and the ar
ticles were again gone over in detail.
Various changes of verbiage, which
tended only to soften the sound of the
terms without affecting the sense, were
proposed by the Spanish and our com
missioners accepted practically all of
them.
Shortly after midnight General
Wheeler suggested that the good faith
of the Spaniards be tested. All the ar
ticles were re-read and each commis
sioner in turn was asked If they were
satisfactory. When they replied in the
affirmative General Wheeler asked
them to affix their signatures. This
they appeared reluctant to do, but
could not well refuse. When all had
signed the commissioners separated to
meet again at 9;SO In the morning.
The principal municipal authorities
are to continue in control of the city
until the Spanish troops are em
barked. The Spanish troops from other
parts are to be embarked at the near
est ports. Refugees are to return to
their homes, but not until the sanction
of Madrid is received, and the same ap
plies to the removal of the obstruc
tions at the mouth of the harbor. Pend
ing this, however, Miss Clara Barton
and the Red Cross agents, with sup
plies, are to be allowed to enter the
city over the line of the Juragua Rail
road.
The water main, which was cut, is
to be repaired to-day. No Cubans are
to be allowed to enter the city. All
the artillery and the batteries at the
entrance of the harbor are to be left
intact and we are to obtain possession
of the gunboat in the harbor.
Pending the sanction of Madrid
everything is at a standstill, and, as a
result, the troops on both sides are in
the trenches. While there is only a re
mote chance of the Government at Ma
drid upsetting everything, at the last
moment, such an event Is still recog
nized as a possibility. However, our
plans are being prepared as though the
campaign were over. General Shafter's
headquarters are to be moved, proba
bly to-day, to the high ground north
of the city, where the whole army will
be encamped after Santiago is evacu
ated, pending the possibility of its em
barkation for the island of Porto
Rico.
The troops who were landed at Si
boney, but not brought up, are to be
sent back on board the transports im
mediately. What American troops
will remain here as a garrison, and the
number, has not been decided on.
There Is some talk of garrisoning. San
tiago with several regiments from the
Southern States which are understood
to be at sea at present.
The condition of the city of Santi
ago seems to be dreadful â filth and
stench everywhere. There is much
sickness among the Spanish soldiers,
due to bad and insufficient food.
Our commissioners have again gone
in to meet the Spanish commissioners.

THIRTY THOUSAND MEN
ORDERED TO PORTO RICO
General Brooke to Command and the
Expedition to Sail Within
Ten Days.
NEW YORK, July 16.â A Washing
ton special ?ays: Major General J. R.
Brooke, who under General Miles will
command the expedition to Porto Rico,
arrived in Washington last nisht, and
spent to-day in making preparations
for the approaching campaign. Thirty
thousand is the number of troops that
is expected to go with General Brooke,
and they are expected to leave these
shores within the next ten days. In
addition to two regiments of regular
infantry, four regiments of cavalry and
eight or ten batteries of artillery now
at Tampa, the Fifth Infantry has also
been ordered there. All these regulars
will be included in the expedition. The
plans have gone a step further, and it
is hinted that even some of the troops
from Santiago will go if they prove to
be perfectly free from infection, but
this is far frpm being decided upon. It
is not known when General Brooke will
go from Washington, but it is expected
he will make his headquarters near
Newport News for the assembling of
an army to follow without delay the
blockading fleet, part of which left San
tiago last night for Porto Rico.
PAVING THE WAY FOR
THE INVADING ARMY
Navy Department Takes Steps for
Blockading All the Ports of
Porto Bico.
NEW YORK, July 16.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Pav
ing the way for the army of invasion,
the Navy Department has initiated
measures for blockading all the ports
of Porto Rico. In accordance with in
structions sent by Secretary Long
three monitors have left Key West for
Porto Rican waters, where they will
take station in front of San Juan,
whose fortifications they will attack.
The monitors, I understand, are the
Puritan, Amphitrite and Miantonomoh,
while the Terror remains on guard off
Havana, The arrival of these three
vessels will increase the blockading
force In front of San Juan to six ves
sels. It is not intended to keep all
these ships at that point, however, but
on the arrival of the monitors the other
ships will go to other Porto Rican
ports.
SIXTY THOUSAND MEN
HAVE BEEN RECRUITED
President's Second Call for Volun-

WASHINGTON, July 16. â Nearly
60,000 of the 70,000 volunteers asked for
by the President in his second call for
troops have been recruited, and most
of them have been mustered into the
service. Of the number already re
cruited under the second call 30,000
have been assigned to regiments now
In the field and have been sent to join
the organisations to which they are as
signed. A few less than 20,000 have
been recruited for new organizations.
Some of these organizations have been
mustered into service, but a few of
them yet lack the required number of
men. Adjutant General Corbin hopes
to have the details of the second call
entirely cleared up by August 1.

SEEK CLOSER
FRIENDSHIP
Object of the Formation of
the Anglo-American
League.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, July 16.â The idea of draw
ing closer the friendship between Eng
land and America has resulted in the
formation of an Anglo-American
League which already numbers many
of the foremost names in Great Brit
ain, including two archbishops and
twenty-three bishops. Among its mem
bers is the Earl of Jersey, who at last
Wednesday's meeting at the Stafford
House moved a resolution to found an
Anglo-American League. The Earl
kindly granted me an interview and
expressed himself as follows:
"I have always sympathized with the
people of the United States and could
never see how the fact that the United
States are a republican and we a
monarchical country should ever be a
bar to a mutual friendly understanding.
Difference of state form by no means
implies difficulty in the way of friendly
good will and mutual regard. I be
lieve every individual effort to show
that good will is felt toward a great
and kindred people means influence
exerted for the good of both. I do not
lean so much to formal influence as I
do to the strengthening conviction that
two free peoples, each pursuing its own
way in the world, should at the same
time feel that they are working for the
greatest object for which a nation can
exist and statesmen toil, namely, the
spread of freedom and justice and
peaceful development."
In further course of conversation
with his lordship, who takes a keen in
terest in events happening in Cuban
waters, he expressed himself in the
highest terms of admiration concerning
Lieutenant Hobson's daring exploit,
while also paying a Just tribute to the
gallantry of Admiarl Cervera.
Lord Farrer assured me that he, in
conjunction with his old friend. Lord
Thring, had been imbued with the im
portance of a friendly understanding
with the United States as far back as
fifty years ago. He has never swerved
in this conviction, but even to-day he
thinks It prudent not to go too fast.
"It is," he said, "but recently that
we have witnessed instances of antag
onism in the United States toward
Great Britain, and it would be defeat
ing the laudable object in view to lose
sight of these things. England's pol
icy has long been an open door, and it
is to be hoped the United States may
one day see its way to meet England
on this platform of community of com
mercial interests, which is, after all,
sound foundation for community of
policy and sentiment."
Lord Thring, K. C. 8., received me
very cordially at his London residence,
5 Queen's Gate Gardens, and expressed
himself as follows: "Some fifty years
ago I was asked to write a pamphlet
on American law. It was to be written
to further a scheme of coloniaj federa
tion for a colonial society to which I
belonged In my younger years, and its
programme necessarily included the
necessity of a friendly understanding
with the United States. The society in
question included among its members
men who differed as much in polUics
as the late Spencer Walpole, Sir Wil
liam Molesworth, Cobden, Bright and
Rintone, then editor of the Spectator.
Ever since those days I have taken the
greatest interest in American institu
tions and have made personal friends
of those distinguished Americans with
whom I have from time to time come
in contact. I think the present moment
is extremely favorable for drawing the
ties of friendship and good will closer
between the two countries. Perhaps the
less we exact as terms of mutual un
derstanding the better, but the main
object is to have associations in both

countries for the purpose of promoting
that good understanding which cannot
fail to have great effect in political af
fairs as well as in social life."
H. Kider Haggard, the eminent nov
elist, belongs equally with the noble
men already quoted to the committee
of the Anglo-American League. He
leads the life of a country gentleman
in Norfolk, but takes a keen interest
in imperial politics and thus is decid
edly a representative man. He has
traveled far and wide in the United
States, and in compliance with my re
quest for his views he has favored me
with the following expose:
"I have a long-cherished idea of the
United States and the mother country-,
and have always felt grieved when un
friendly feelings have temporarily
risen on either side, for I consider a
misunderstanding an enormous calam
ity for both countries. Thus lam in
clined to believe that the present dis
play of mutual good will is one of the
most fortunate things that has hap
pened during the present generation,
for I hold that the future of the two
countries is largely bound up one with
the other. If our enemies get the bet
ter of the United States, America ig
bound to suffer, probably to a large
extent. If, on the other hand, we join
forces, I believe that after one great
struggle, which is bound to come, we
shall be able to dictate peace to the
world for the benefit of the world. I
do not agree with a political school
which holds that there can be no union
because of diversity of interests aris
ing from the fact that America is pro
tectionist and we free traders. Our
colonies favor protection, and yet we
have here the warmest and closest
union. These are minor matters. In
my humble opinion. The first practical
step would be for the United States
Legislature to pass an arbitration,
treaty, after which the treaty of an
offensive and defensive alliance would
probably follow as a natural sequence."
NO REASON WHY THERE
SHOULD BE A PANIC
Surgeon General Sternberg Discusses
the Yellow Fever Situation
at Santiago.
NEW YORK, July 16.â A Washing
ton special says: Surgeon General
Sternberg, while he does not talk light
ly of the yellow fever situation in San
tiago, is by no means willing to join
in the extreme fears felt by some
others, expression from him is
calm and reassuring. General Stern
berg said to me that he was depending
upon official dispatches for his esti
mate of the situation, and they did nut
indicate a situation over which, with
proper precaution, there should be a
panic. He was distinctly relieved when
he felt certain that no more fightinj;
would be required of the soldiers. It
was lying in soggy trenches near ref
ugees who came infected from Santi
ago that made the problem complex
and uncertain, he said. The medical
authorities were then comparatively
helpless against the spread of the dis
ease. Now, he said, the case was dif
ferent; men could be organized, not on
a basis of early action against the en
emy, but on basis of requirements
necesstry against the spread of the
fever.
SHOCK TOO MUCH FOR

BALTIMORE, July 16. â Lieutenant

DAWSON WITH
TONS OF GOLD
Four Million Dollars in
Dust Carried by Three
River Vessels.

DAWSOX. N. W. T., Jane 28, by
Bteamer Cottage City to Seattle, July
I*>- â The great ileet of small bt>ats from
Linderman, Bennett and along the up
per river has for the most part arrived,
although the slower craft are still com
ing hour by hour. The Bella of the
Alaska Commercial Company, with her
barge, got up from the lower river last
wet-k, as did t!.e Seattle No. 1, with her
crowd of passengers looking much the
Worse fur their long winter below the
Tanana. The Hamilton, the Weare and
the Bella hav<-> returned down the river,
departing in the order named within a
day or so of each other. The Bella was
the last to gro, swinging out into the
stream last Sunday afternoon in the
presence of a great crowd of people.
Each of these steamers carried away
a share of the winter accumulation of
gol& dust, the Weare taking much the
larger part of that of the National
Alaska Trading and Transportation
Company and the Bella that af the
Alaska < ommercial Company.
The officers of neither company will
give out or authorize the â iving out of
Information as to the amount of the
shipments, but conservative estimates
place the whole at about $4,000,000. The
treasure was put aboard the vessels
during the night preceding their sailing
or rather during those hours of so
called nitrht, when th re wore fewest
c upon the street; for there is no
nigh: at this season and no hour when
the streets are not well tilled, so that
the transfers of the goM sacks from the
safes and chests of the big st^re to
those in the pursurs' rooms were not
without their observers. The treasure
was placed on ' the TVeare about 2
k in the morning of Saturd ty, the
25th, and the vessels sailed that after
noon. The gold was placed aboard the
i on Saturday nipht and she sailed
on Sunday afternoon, the l'6th.
It was a curious little sc^ne, that of
carrying the treasure aboard ship. It
was laid '~>n a sort of stretcher with a
d.iii oioth over it. Eight men, four
de, holding to the stout poles,
Btaggered under the weight fnr six trips
back and forth. United States Marshal
Canton, who came up from Circle City
for the purpose, walked with the;n,
clearing the way and keeping an eye
on the crowd. The gold bearers,
stooping and staggering, said never a
word. The Marshal issued hK orders
v.ith a sharp gesture of the hund. They
passed through the wide avenue of by
standers, down the bank, up the gang
plank and disappeared.
This was repeated six times In the
case of the AVeare, the crowd all the
while making its comments in that sub
dued tone that obtains at funerals. Had
it been the body of a Prince they car
rii-il no greater respect could ha^e been
shown to it.
When the vessels departed, however,
th^ <mn high and radiant, flaps flying,
the decks crowded with outgoing pas
sengers, the banks of the river crowded
by people, the scene was very different.
The i heers of the peop'.^ on shore were
answered by those on the decks over
and over again. The people aboard the
boats were of great variety, but all
were plad of that moment of movement
and activity. Some of them were suc
cessful miners going out with their
homestake; others were simply carry-
Ing their plans with them, with hopes
<.f realization on the outside; others
were going rait to their old life, the life
they had left, carrying with them the
memory of a wasted winter and the
mark? of trial and privation. They were
piad because it was at an end. Ptill
others were not bound out at all, but
were merely peeking new fields on the
American side.

Weare. The following is a full list of

The Seattle No. 1, the unifortunate
steamer of the Seattle-Yukon Trans
portation Company, of which ex-Mayor
Wood is at the head, arrived here on
the 22d, with her passengers, who
spent the winter unwillingly below the
Tanana. The Seattle No. 1 looks as
if she had had a hard winter. Com
ing up she stuck on a bar sixteen miles
above Circle City. Ex-Marshal Dunn,
an experienced steamboat man, was
called up from Circle City and suc
ceeded in getting her off after she had
lain there two weeks. The passen

Several of these passengers did pros
: pecting in Manook and speak well of
i the possibilities of the creek. Four
claims are reporteu to be paying well.
' They are Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9, above Dis
; covery, on Little Manook. Langford
, and Johnson, who made Discovery on
! the creek, sold that claim and went
| to 6, one above, where they will take
I out from $50,000 to $100,000. No. 7is
â  owned by a man named Stevens, who
| has been working sixteen men during
I the winter, and who probably wih take
out $100,000. No. Bis owned by ex-
Governor McOraw and General Carr of
Seattle. They paid $11,000 for the
! claim and will take out about $.30,000.
I No. 9 is owned by Al Mayo, Mitchell,
j Hawley and Koffenberg. They paid
j $10,u00 for it and will take out $50,000
| from 500 feet.
Idaho Bar, discovered by Charley
I Range in April, near Manook, is caus-
I ing some excitement there. From $2
to $5 per pan was taken out within
five feet of the surface.
A camp of about 500 people is estab
: llshed at Manook and the place boasts
I two saloons, a bakery and a restau
j rant.
Two other small steamboats built at
I the lakes have succeeded in running
i the rapids successfully and arrived here
: this week. They are the Ora, built by
: the Bennett Lake and Klondike Navi
! gation Company, and the Willie Irving,
I built by Captain John Irving of the
I Central Pacific Railroad.
The manager of the Bennett Lake
and Klondike Company is F. M. Bat
tonberg. The company has three boats,
the others being the Nora and Flora.
They will run regularly during the open
season between here and Bf.nnett. the
â¢ Ora going to Five Fingers the Nora
j from Five Fngers to the White Horse,
i and the Flora from above the canyon
|to Bennett. The Ora on her return
: trip carried thirty passengers. S. A.
: Raney.of San Francisco, one of the Ex
| celsior's passengers of last year, is
among them and carries this dispatch.
The Irving has been sold to a com
i pany which proposes to prospect the
i Stewart River. The price paid for the
i little boat was ?50,000.
A big party from lowa, known as tlr
lowa and Alaska Gold Mining Com
pany, arrived on the 22d in a steam
boat named, the lowa, rigged up out of
a sawmill plant. There were thirty
; eight in th^ party. They will go down
i the river and probably locate at Ea^le
City, where the boat will become the
sawmill. Those on the lowa were:
Captain Abbott, Charter Oak; Bon
hnm, Ottumwa; T. T. Barber, Charter
â  Oak; Charles Bridgei an. John Emerson,
I Ottumwa; T. N. Foster, Ontario: W. Mc
i Sherlock, Marshalltown; C F. Haf.-lman,

I Michaels, E. M. Vail, Marshalltown; Con
' Dora. Ottumwa; John Keables, Pella;
'Joseph Twogood, Tacoma, Wash.; M. T.
Burnett, Luverne, la.
Ten of the party, including C. A.
Walsh of Ottumwa, prominent as a
lawyer and Democratic politician in
lowa, stopped at the Hootalinqua
River for a short time. In this party
were:
C. A. Stuart, Mason City- Arthur Dim
mick. Mason City; B. D. Millan, Muller
County, South Dakota; O. F. Felton,
: Mason City; M. M. McKeever, San born;
i M. R. Boyd. Sanborn; M. S. Marsh. R^n

Charter Oak.
J. M. Starbuck, Browslow, Heith,
Parks, McCord and Keiser an ahead of
the others, having passed down several
days ago in a little screw propeller.
The situation at Dawson is extraor
dinary. Ten thousand people are
camped about the townsite. They are
forbidden to cam-> on the townsite and
their tents cover every available spot
on the Government land in the little
basin in which the town is located. The
sand bars that are rapidly appearing
,in front of the town as the water falls
'are covered and the late comers are
being forced to the very to-s of the
surrounding hills and even across the
river. Thus the whole heart of the basin
Is a comparatively unoccupied swamp
with the people crowded for room to
ca,Â«t their tents about it. The town-
Pite people â Harper. Ladue and Kirk
patrick â although unable to trive deeds,
not having received their patent from
the government, are askincr from $250
to $25,000 a lot. Except for business
purposes few are buying. The Govern
ment, on the other hand, has surveyed
the land surrounding, and it too is
asking at the rate of $250 a lot. It has
leased to Alexander McDonald all the
water side of First street at the rate
of $30,000 a year and McDonald sublets
at the rate of $6 to $12 a front foot. As
the space is over a half-mile in length
McDonald's venture will be very proflt
j able.
The problem of housing this great
throng of people is a serious one. FÂ«'w
had the foresight to bring cabin logs J
clown the river with them. It is a
very difficult matter to go up the river
againrt the strong current, especially
with the heavy boats in which they
came down. It is a more difficult mat
ter to bring the logs up from below.
The hills Immediately about Dawson
are stripped. Lumber costs $200 a
thousand.
Very many of this great crowd
doubtless will find themselves unfitted
to combat the severe conditions of this
country, and will go out. It is a ques
tion if they will act promptly enough
to enable them to get out in time. The
strong grip of the winter is just three
monthe distant. Ido not think that
next winter will see that terrible strug
gle for bread that last winter wit
nessed, but, rather, it will be a strug
gle for work. There is scarcely work
to be had at wages for a material frac
tion of this crowd, and for those who
will not, or cannot, go out in the hills
for themselves there must be lively
competition for the work that is of
fered. This is not a good land for the
helpless or incompetent, and it is al
ready apparent there axe many such in
this 'throng.
OUT FROM DAWSON
IN EIGHT DAYS
JUNEAU, Alaska, July 13, by steam- j
ship Cottage City to Port Townsend, |
July 16. â Forty men, comprising the
second up-river party, left Dawson on
June 30, and after seven days' actual
traveling time have since been waiting
here, at Dyea and at Skaguay for a
steamboat to take them south to San
Francisco and Seattle. This beats all
previous records out from Dawson so
badly as to indicate that the extreme
northern route by %vay of St. Michael
is no longer in it. Summarizing the
trip a little more closely they were
eight days from Dawson to Lake Ben
nett. Small steamboats with plenty of
power at their sterns made this fast
time possible.
Two boats came vp â the Ora and the
Goddardâ and the outcoming party was
about equally divided between them.
These steamers on the Lewis and Yu
kon, from Dawson to White Horse
Rapids, thence over a portage of two
miles, and then by another steamer to
Lake Bennett, determines the question
of the quickest way to get out of Daw
son to the south. This time would have
been beaten but for the fact that all
hands were forced to cut wood Bio
the river banks in order to keep
steam up.
The boat from time to time left
parties along the shore to cut wood, so
that after this it is possible to make
Dawson from Puget Sound, empty
handed or traveling with an outfit, in
ten days. The fare up the river was on
this trip $200; down it is $100.
To-night as the party leaves the yel
low dust and the heavy nuggets have
been dragged out of the safes of the
hotels and the banks. Perhaps no man
brought out more dust than "Jack"
Haulay. who has been sitting around
Jurieau hotels for five dasÂ in the first
white shirt he has worn in two years.
Mr. Huulay's gold was so much in bulk
that it had to b divided into salt sacks,
j the salt being bought and emptied into
the Htreet In order to place the gold In
the pafe. His dust is from Eldorado.
In all about $350,000 was brought out by
the forty men. I have seen gold piled
up here' on the counter of a hotel in
the same bulk that it is removed for
the day's business in trays from the
vaults of the German-American Sav
inpp Hank on California street.
William Minter of Tacoma, Wash.,
was one of the party who came out
with Haulay. He has a few heavy
sacks himself. Both say that a few
days before they left Dawson the water
in the river had subsided again and
that there was so little depth in the
channel as to still make it doubtful
ae:ain that the steamers would get up
the river. HAL HOFFMAN.
EXPRESS COMPANIES

United States Commissioner Hunter
Decides in Favor of the
Shippers.
OTTFMWA. lowa, July 16.â T5n!ted
States Commissioner Hunter decided that
express companies, not shippers, must
pay the 1-cent revenue-tax stamp to be
attached to an express receipt. He holds

Adams Express Company, arrested on a
charge of violating the revenue law. to
the Grand Jury. Assistant United States
District Attorney Miles represented the
Government. Attorneys for the express
companies will apply for a writ of habeas

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A woman's attractiveness in the eyes of
man depends largely on her physical ap-
pearance. Nature, in order to preserve the
race, guides mankind by the instinctive
preference for a mate who is physically
Bound and wholesome.
If intellect alone were chiefly sought, the
offspring might be a generation of Solo-
mons for wisdom, but they would perish
in infancy for want of physical stamina. -
A weak or unhealthy woman is unfitted to
fulfil her part in perpetuating the race; she
is unequal to the demands of motherhood
and wifehood, she is robbed of her natural
womanly attractiveness. .

AGNEWS ASYLUM "RING"
HOLDS SECRET CONCLAVE
ENDEAVORING TO
WIN OVER PRIVATE
DETECTIVE FROST
Gould Cooducts Negotiates in
tf)e Office of SpoQogle's
Accuser.
SAN JOSE, July 17.â Several mysteri
ous and closely guarded conferences
were held in this city last night, In
â which James R. Curnow, Frank H.
Gould, O. A. Hale. Dr. R. M. Sponogle
and Erwin Frost participated. The
Bubject under discussion was the recent
sensational exposures made in reference
to the condition of affairs at the Ag
news State Hospital.
More than ordinary significance is at
tached to the secret councils held by
these men. Curnow is chairman of the
board of managers of the asylum. Hale
Is a member of the board and Gould is
credited with being the dominating
spirit of a ring to control the patron
age of the institution, of which ring
Curnow and Hale are component parts.
Dr. Sponogle is the medical superin
tendent of the institution. At the last
cession of the board, held on Wednes
day, from which Gould was absent, Dr.
Fponogle was indirectly charged by
Frost, a private detective, with having
murdered his first wife to obtain the
Insurance on her life and with having
ruined a young girl in Fresno and paid
$4000 to compromise the matter. Spo
nogle is one of Curnow's appointees.
Gould arrived here shortly after 6
oclock in the evening, and soon after 8
o'clock he was in conference with Cur
now, Hale and Sponogle in the private
SICK AND WOUNDED FROM
THE SCENE OF WAR
Transport Olivette Reaches Quaran-
tine, New York, Under Favor-
able Conditions.
NEW YORK, July 16.â The United
States transport Olivette has arrived
at Quarantine, bringing 271 sick and
wounded soldiers from the scene of
war. Of this number fifty-eight are
convalescent and ready to join their
regiments. When the Olivette an
chored in Quarantine she was boarded
by Health Officer Doty, Surgeon Gen
eral George Sternberg, U. S. A., and
Majors Bushnell and Hall, U. S. A.
Major Apple, surgeon in charge of the
Olivette, reported the condition of the
Biek and wounded convalescent as be
ing excellent, and the ship's company
much improved in every way. The ship
was given pratique by the health offi
cer.
The Olivette will remain at anchor
until to-morrow, when she will pro
ceed to Brooklyn, where the sick and
wounded will be removed to the Long
Island College Hospital and St. Peter's
Hospital.
Shortly after the an-chor dropped the
Btaten Island ferry-boat Westfield
went alongside and took off about 100
of those most seriously sick and
wounded, landing them at Stapleton,
where ambulances removed them to
the United States Marine Hospital.
There was no evidence on board of
contagious disease. Edward Marshal,
the reporter who was shot in the spine,
was improving.
INFECTED REGIMENTS
WILL BE REMOVED
Chief Surgeon Greenleaf Is Keeping
Yellow Fever Under Con
trol.
SIEONEY, via Playa del Este and
Hayti, July 16.â Colonel Greenleaf,
chief surgeon of the army, says he will
remove the infected regiments to a
healthful locality, eliminating fever pa
tients each day and marching the regi
ment outward till free of disease. The
cases are so far mild, and the medical
corps hopes to be able to keep them un
dfr control. Brewer, the postmaster, is
dead of fever, and buried.
The Twenty-fourth Infantry, colored,
has been detached from the army and
sent to a camp in the mountains near
here. These men are the best fighters
here. The remainder of the army is ex
pected to leave for home as soon as the
Spanish troops embark for Spain. The
colored troops carried off the honors in
the San Juan fight, and all are eager
for the fray. There is no sickness
among them.
BRINGS AMERICAN AND
SPANISH WOUNDED
The Hospital Ship Solace Arrives at
Old Point, Va., From
Siboney.
OLD POINT, Va., July 16.â The hos
pital ship Solace arrived here to-day
from Siboney, Cuba, bringing forty
four wounded Americans and forty-nine
wounded Spaniards, who took part in |
the engagement of Santiago July 3. The
Americans were transferred from the
Solace to Fort Monroe. The Solace left
Old Point about noon and proceeded to
Norfolk, where the Spaniards were put
ashore at the naval hospital. The work
of debarking the wounded required
but a short time. The tug Alice brought
them from the ship to the dock, where
those seriously wounded were placed
on litters and carried to the hospital.
Many of the soldiers are shot in the
legs, some of them in the feet, while
others have Mauser bullet holes in their
bodies.
HOW A SPANISH SHIP
ESCAPED DESTRUCTION
Precautions of the Governor of Arch-
angel to Prevent Hostilities
in the Arctic.
VARDOE, July 15 (delayed in trans
mission).âThe steam whaler Fridtjof,
having on board Walter Wellman and
the members of his expedition to Green
land, arrived here to-day for coal, hav
ing left Solombola, a town near Arch
angel, on July 5. The party sail north
east to-morrow.
On July 11, in latitude 77 north, sev
enteen miles south of Franz Josef Land,
heavy pack ice was found. While at
office of O. A. Hale at Second and San
Fernando streets. At about 10 o'clock
this conference came to an end, and
Sponogle left the three trustees.
Gould, Curnow and Hale proceeded to
a well-known restaurant, just above
which is the office of Frost. Here they
were met by Frost. A few minutes
later Gould and Frost left the restau
rant and went upstairs to Frost's of
fice, while Curnow and Hale remained
in the restaurant, presumably awaiting
the return of their colleague.
Frost claims to have in his possession
much damaging evidence against Dr.
Sponogle and also against the appoint
ees of the members of the board who
have refused to put on the Gould collar.
After Frost got through with his sen
sational charges against Dr. Sponogle
he ostentatiously passed his business
card around among all the members
and insisted upon Dr. Sponogle also
taking one, remarking that he was
ready and willing to work for any or
all of them.
At 1 o'clock this morning Gould and
Frost were still closeted In the latter's
office, while Hale and Curnow were im
patiently awaiting Gould's return. The
presumption is that Gould and Frost
could not come to terms m reference to
the detective's employment.
i Archangel the Governor of that place
'â  refused to allow the Fridtjof and a
Spanish ship to sail on the same day,
saying it was feared the hostilities be-
I tween the United States and Spa+n
; would cause an outbreak between the
I crews of the two ships, although the
j Spanish ship was a trader and the
1 armament of Mr. Wellman's steamer
only consisted of a harpoon gun.

NEW YORK, July 16.â A special to

the provinces of Catalonia, Valencia,
' Aragon, Navarra, Biscay, Gaipuzcoa
and Asturias, in Northern Spain, par

KILLED, WOUNDED AND
MISSING AMERICANS
Report of Casualties in Our Army
Since It Landed in Cuba Sent
to Washington.
GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS, July 15, via Kingston,
Jamaica, July 16. â The final report of
casualties in the army since it landed
in Cuba three weeks ago has been for
warded to Washington. It shows an
aggregate of 1914 officers and men
killed, wounded and missing. The
killed number 246, of which number
twenty-one were officers; wounded, 1584,
of whom ninety-eight were officers, and
missing eighty-four, of whom none
wore officers. Of the wounded only
eighty-eight have died.
Colonel Pope, the Burgeon-in-chief,
says this is a remarkably small number
of considering the large num
ber of wounded. In the field hospitals
there have been a remarkably small
number of septic wounds and but two
cases of gangrene have developed, one
of which resulted fatally.
FRENCH CONSUL
GETS A SURPRISE

of the Destruction of Cer
vera's Fleet.
PLATA DEL ESTI^, Guantanamo Bay,
July 16.â A steam launch from the Span- j
lsh gunboat Sandoval came down the hay '>
this afternoon flying the French flag. The
French Consul at Guantanamo was on
board, as was also the Spanish Bishop of
the Catholic church at Guantanamo. They
held a conference with Commander Me- ;
Calla relative to the removal of indigent
French subjects from Guantanamo to the
French cruiser now in the harbor. Thalr
request was refused until the number of
persona to be removed was definitely
known.
The French Con^il said that there had
been absolutely no communication at
Guantanamo with tue. outside world since !
June 7. He was greatly surprised to hear
of the destruction of Admiral Cervera's i
fleet and the surrender of Santiago. The \
later news and the terms of thn surren- ;
der. involving the Guantanamo forces, j
will be communicated to the Spaniards at
once.
A launch fiÂ«om the cruiser Marblehead.
while scouting along the west shore of
the bay this afternoon, near the mouth of J
Guantanamo River, was fired upon by a
squad of Spanish pickets guarding the
road in that vicinity. The launch replied
with her one-pounder, and a lively fight
resulted. The Marblehead threw three
ehoels from a six-pounder into the woods,
and the fire of the Spaniards ceased sud
denly. The launch was not hit.

DETECTIVE EMPLOYED
.. WITHOUT AUTHORITY
SAN JOSE, July 16.â For the private
political purposes of Frank H. Gould,
but at the expense of the State, a pri
vate detective was employed at the
Agnews State Hospital for thirty-four
days. Gould had evidently hoped to
get evidence that would give him the
whip hand of the two members of the
board who had persistently refused to
programme with him. The two mem
bers who maintained their indepen
dence are Isaac Upham of San * ran
cisco and Edward White of Watson
ville. Mr. Gould's cunning proved
fruitless.

AMOUNTS BROUGHT
BY THE DAWSONITES
SEATTLE, July 16.â 0f the seven
teen miners from Davvson City who ar
rived here to-day on the steamer City
of Seattle, bringing with them gold
dust and drafts estimated at $600,000,
the one bringing the largest amount of
dust was E. M. Sullivan of Los Ange
les, who is credited with $50,000. The
largest individual amount of dust and
drafts was carried by E. Lewin of Se
attle, whose sack is estimated at $100,
000. Other individual amounts range
from $2000 to $10,000. There were a few
who had barely enough to reach home.
The Klondike Nugget, the first news
paper publiehed* at Dawson, under
date of June 28, says:
Washing up is still In progress, and
probably will not be completed until the
latter part of July, owing to a scarcity
of water. Opinions as to the amount of
the total yield differ. Estimates run all
the way from fifteen to twenty million
dollars. The most conservative place It

worked on lays did not make wages and
some even did not make expenses.
Accused of Swindling.
LOS ANGELES, July 16.â Frank A.
Marcher, â¢ a manufacturing Jewe^r on
South Broadway, has been 'arrested on
a charge of swindling. J. W. Jackson,
who is now supposed to be in San Fran
cisco, is charged jointly with Marcher.
Henry Loomis put up $1100 on a lot of
watches which Jackson told him â were
solid gold. Marcher, who is supposed to
have been a party to the swindle from the
first, was consulted at the suggestion of
Jackson and said the watches were worth
at least $1400 for old gold. The watches
are washed brass.
employed. He made dally reports to
the San Francisco agency to which he
is attached, and these reports were in
turn transmitted ' to Mr. Gould. They
covered the period from November 5,
1897, to December 8 of the same year.
Mr. Gould employed this man without
the knowledge and without the author
ity of the board of managers. The
first the members knew of his action
was when he caused a bill to be pre
sented for the services of the detective.
This amounted to $207 60. It waa al
lowed only after considerable con
troversy.
While the detective's report was un
duobtedly_influenced_by the interests
of the man who was responsible for his
employment at the asylum, and while
he failed to get the kind of evidence
that Gould particularly desired, he yet
discovered many things that make in
teresting reading. He arrived at the
asylum on the morning of November
5, 1897. Part of his report oi his ex
periences on that day is as follows:
"I immediately reported to Dr. Spon
ogle and handed him a letter from
Frank H. Gould, one of the directors
of the hospital. He informed me he did
not know when or where he could place
me, but he would communicate with
Mr. Gould by phone, anu in the mean
time I proceeded to view the hospital
in company with an attendant, who
took me about the place and showed
me through the building.. When I re
turned Dr. Sponogle informed me he
had concluded to place me in the store
room temporarily, and called up the
regular storekeeper, Ben Schartzer,
who was detailed as acting steward,
and instructed him to place me in
charge of the storeroom and also to
impart to me the duties connected
therewith. I thereupon assumed the
duties of storekeeper and ascertained
the routine of the business connected
with the same, relative to the issuance

Mr. Bailey, the steward's bookkeeper,
he informed me that some of the em
ployes about the place had called upon
him. and stated they feared I was a
spotter."
Under date of November 9 there Is
this:
"During the day I met many ol the
employes and they an seemed to regard
me with some suspicion, and were extra
careful in their dealings with the store
room."
The report of November 11 says:
"During the day I met the matron,
Miss Royce, and in her conversation
she informed me she was glad to see me
in such a nice Job, etc. She afterward
Informed me that when she first saw me
she was under the impression that I
was at the hospital for some purpose.
She informed me that she understoond
that I had been sent there by Mr.
Gould, and altogether she questioned
me to such an extent that I presume
she expected me to answer her in such
a manner as to commit myself. I was
somewhat suspicious of her and gave
her but little satisfaction. I am of the
opinion that she came to pump me un
der instructions from other persons."
This was part of the report of No
vember 12:
"This day I met Mr. Edgar, the gar
dener, and had a conversation with
him. He informed me it was a hard
place to get along at and there was a
constant strike among the employes
and considerable jealousy among them
selves, and in order to get along one
had to be very careful what they said
and done."
Under date of November 22 the report
was as follows:
"During the day I learned from the
conversations indulged in between the
employes that they' were very much
perturbed over the civil service ex
aminations that were to take place the
following day. I learned that the
clique composed of Adams, Barry, Far
rell, Underwood and Matron Royce had
a slate all prepared and had been using
their endeavors to secure the promo
tions of certain persons whose names
were upon the list as prepared by them.
They advised that Mr. Schartzer be ad
vanced to the position of steward,

Adams to be storekeeper and Lowe to
be advanced to Adams' place in the
laundry, together with some minor
changes. The employes in general dis
cussed the examinations and attached
but small importance to the order re
quiring that employes hereafter have
to pass a civil service examination for
promotion, and they stated the persons
having the greatest pull would be first
advanced and the examination would
not amount to much."
On November 24 part of the report
comprised the following:
"During the day I had a conversation
with the matron. Miss Royce. She said
to me in the conversation that some of
the employes were jealous of her. be
cause she had a job and would tell all
kinds of lies about her. She also stated
that Mr, Gould had said things about
her. She supposed he had some friend
he wanted to put in her place. She
said she had pull enough to stay as
long as she wanted to. She also asked
me to speak to Mr. Gould in her be
half, as she understood it was Mr.
Gould who sent me here. She said that
it was the worst place to talk about
each other she ever saw, and that some
were talking about me, but would not
state who or what they were saying."
Under date of November 26 a criti
cism of the manner in which the farm
was conducted is made. The report in
part says:
"I noticed that the farm was carried
on very poorly. There seems to be no
system to the work. Every one does as
he pleases. I think the foreman, Mr.
Farrell, is to blame in a measure for
the neglect and he would rather talk
religion or politics than attend to his
business."
This occurs under date of Decem
ber 1:
"Mr. Bailey and myself commenced
taking an inventory of the goods in the
storeroom. There was one coarse comb
and a sack of apricots that could not
be accounted for. Mr. Bailey said it
was very good compared with other
months."
For December 2 the report reads:
"During the day I walked around the
building and farm and observed the
farm men doing very little work them
selves, but putting: in most of their
time compelling- the patients to per
form the work and laughing at them
while they were at work."
A few days later the reports tell of a
lot of pictures being distributed among
the inmates and of Miss Royce's at
tempt to appropriate one of them, but
being dissuaded from doing so by Dr.
Sponogle. There was nothing addition
al of an unusual character up to the
day (December 8) the detective got his
discharge from Dr. Sponogle.CALIFORNIA'S
SUBSCRIPTION
IS RECEIVED
Dublin Men Aiding '9B
Centenary Fund.
FOREMOST IN THE MOVEMENT
IRISHMEN AT HOME AND
ABROAD DISPLAY LOYALTY.
Matters of Importance on Both Sides
of the Atlantic Are Reviewed
by J. J. Clancy, The
Call's Correspondent. â¢
BY J. J. CLANCY.
DUBLIN. July 2.â Th<Â» Irishmen and
especially the Dublin men in San Fran
cisco will be interested to hear that at
the last weekly meeting of the execu
tive council of the 'i^ Centenary Com
mittee a communication from "the City
of Dublin Social Club" of San Francisco
Inclosing a subscription toward the
fund for the erection of "the '9S centen
ary monument" was read, to the in
tense satisfaction of all present, and
was deemed worthy of special notice in
the Nationalist press the following day.
The letter was signed by Henry P. Fil
grate and stated that the resolution or
dering the subscription to be sent to
Dublin .was proposed by J. W. Reilly
and seconded by James Brock, M. H.
Lawlor being in the chair. I may men
tion here that Dublin men in many
parts of the world are foremost among
those who are assisting by material aid
the '98 centenary movement, and the
fact is nut surprising, seeing that Dub
lin has always been the headquarters
of every Irish Nationalist movement,
has been the theater of most of the
trials and executions for treason both
daring the period of '98 and the other
troublous times, and contains the re
mains of the most famous of the mar
tyred dead. Another reason why it la
natural that Irishmen belonging to
Dublin in foreign countries should be
foremost in every movement in which
Irishmen at home are concerned, is that
the population of Dublin is constantly
being recruited from the best and the
most active elements in the provinces,
and that, therefore, the Dublin people,
on the whole, are likely to be the most
quick-witted and keenest of the whole
race. At any rate the fact remains that
the men of Dublin at home and abroad
are foremost in this '98 centenary move
mien t.
Talking of Dublin, I am reminded
thai the question which just now is ex
citing' most interest in this city is as
to who is to be Lord Mayor for 1899.
If the question were to be decided on
purely political lines any candidate
nominated by the united Nationalist
section of the corporation would, of
tot be elected, for there are only
ten or eleven Unionists or anti-Nation
alist members in that body out of sixty,
and so it has happened that since 1882,
when the Tory Lord Mayor of that day
refused by his casting vote the freedom
of the city to Charles Stewart Parnell,
no Tory or Unionist Lord Mayor has
been allowed to occupy the position of
chief citizen of the Irish capital. Not
that thc-re has been any objection to a
Protestant or a Tory, as such, but that
It has been felt that to elect an op
ponent of the Irish national ciaims
would be regarded as an abandonment
on the part of Dublin of those claims
Altogether. Of late, however, a section
of the Nationalist party has begun to
think that a change of tactics in this
matter is desirable and have favored
the ciaims of Sir Robert Sexton, an
old and respected Tory and English
man to boot, and a day or two ago. at
a private "caucus" meeting of the Na
tionalist corporators, the voting for
Sir Robert Sexton was equal. On a
subsequent division, however, on the
question whether the selection of a
Lord Mayor for next year should be
postponed till after the next elections,
the casting vote of the chairman de
cided the question in the affirmative.
It now remains to be seen whether the
Nationalist party, as a whole, will sup
port this decision at the n.eeting of the
corporation on Monday next. If it does
of. course no nomination will take place,
but, even if it does not. any nomination
that may be made will be subject to
revision in January next when the elec
tions under the new and extended fran
chise will take place. As far as I can
find out the treneral feelln*" seems to be
that no effort should bo made by the
present corporation, which is elected on
a limited franchke and is to cease to
exist on the passing of the local govern
mf 1 bill, to bind in this matter its suc
cessor, which will be elected on a wide
franchise and will come into existence
next January.
A somewhat romantic case has come
on for trial this week In one of our
Chancery courts here â a case, too.
In which Irish-Americans will feel
an interest. It was an action in the
Court of the Master of the Rolls by one
Thomas Hervey Lynch to have himself
declared entitled to a pretty consider
able estate on the borders of the coun
ties of Gal way and Mayo, near the fa
mous Abbey of Conly and on the shore
of the picturesque waters of Lough
Mask. The history of the case may be
briefly told. Henry Charles Lynch in
the year 1800 disposed of the estate In
question by a deed, the. exact meaning
of which is now the question In dispute.
All went well until the last owner died.
a few years ago. He was a married
man, but he left no lawful issue, and,
dying, he devised the estate to a
woman who had been his housekeeper,
and who had married an ex-ser
r^nnt in the Irish constabulary. The
validity of the will was disputed some
time npn, but the suit was abandoned
aid th* ox-policeman and his wife have
pinro been In th<* enjoyment of "the
rents and profits" of the estate of Bal
ly^urran. Bui their title is now disputed
by Thomas Hervey Lynch, who asserts
that the last owner had no power to
will the estate away at all. and claims
that, under thf settlement of 180 C. he is
the next heir living to the maker of
that deed. Thf question win naturally
ariÃe to rh* mind of th" reader why the
p.alntlff waited so Inn-- to assort his
rlphts. The !>n?n-.. r is thru hÂ° has b*-Â»>n
for the last fifty-four years or so In the
i nlted States, to whu-h his father, a
nephew of tho Lynch of 1800. emigrated
with hi? family in the year 1844, and
only heard of th<=- whole affair after the
Will case had her> n settled. There is no
doubt that, genealogically, he is what
he profrpses to he, and certainlyâ for I
have FP^n him haunting the precincts
of the Form Courts for some weeks
pastâ he looks more like the rightful
owner of Unllycurran Castle and lands
than the ex-polic^man and his wife
The only question Is whether under the
deed of 1800 the last owner had or had
not power to make a will. Among the
documents rend in court within the last
two days to establish the pedigree of
the plaintiff in the present suit were
several from other members of the fam
ily In America, one of whom, writing
from San Francisco in 1870, related how
he had been captured by a tribe of In
dians from Patagonia and escaped by
enticing the "king" of the tribe (with
whom he had become a favorite) out
side bounds. The king bore the sus
picioush- Irish name of "Fabricius Pat
ricius O'Connor." Judgment has not
yet been given by the Master of the
Rolls, but most persons hope that it will
be in favor of the returned American.
A very curious prosecution has just
taken place in Westport, in the county
of Mayo. That town is the headquar
ters of an association recently estab
lished there under the title of "The
United Irish League." The president
of the league is Mr. John McHale. and
he instituted the prosecution in ques
tion against a sergeant in the Irish
constabulary for forging his name to a
letter inciting to the commission of
crime in the interest of the league. The
evidence against the police constable
consisted of that of an expert from
London, who gave it as his deliberate
opinLon that the handwriting in the let
ter was the same as that in certain
letters admitted to be those of the po
liceman, and it was also proven that
the policeman in question was, with
some of the men under his command,
in ambush on a certain night at the
place at which the outrage suggested
was to have taken place. On this evi
dence the magistrate before whom the
preliminary investigation took place
refused to return the accused fpr trial;
but the prosecution is to be renewed,
and, unquestionably, there is something
very curious about the whole affair.
The Plgott forgeries, which were de
vised to ruin Parnell and the movement
which he led, at once arise to the mind,
and, while it would not be right to as
sume that the Westport policeman has
been guilty of anything of the kindâ
and I do not desire even to suggest it
âit is equally right to say that, if he
is guilty, it would not be the first time
that agents of the kind were induced
to betray Irish organizations Into crime
or, rather, to furnish bogus evidence of
their complicity in outrages.
Galway, the capital of Connaught
and the center of a district in which
an Irish speaking population still sur
vives, is to be the scene of a great
Gaelic festival about the end of August.
The Catholic Bishop of Galway, Dr.
McCormack, is giving it his support and
so is a former Catholic Bishop of Gal
way and native of the. town, Dr. Carr,
the present Bishop of Melbourne. The
programme will consist of Irish prose
and poetical recitations, hornpipe and
jig dancing, performances by Irish pip
ers and choruses of school children.
The Gaelic League in Dublin is deter
mined to make this festival a success,
and have appointed a committee to
prepare for it. The effect, of course,
of the whole affair is to promote and
encourage the study and use of the
national tonjrue of Ireland. It is hoped
and expected that some Irish-Ameri
cans, especially those connected with
Connaught, will be present; . but, if I
may judge from the number of Irish-
Americans whe have come to Ireland
this summer so far, T am doubtful
whether that hope will be realized. I
suppose the war accounts for the com
parative paucity of American visitors
to Ireland generally this year. If the
war shoukl continue to operate in this
way during the rest of the summer
season, it will be a pity, for never be
fore has it been possible to see all the
parts of Ireland worth seeing so easily
and so cheaply as now. On this point
I mean to write & special letter or two
very soon for the benefit of the readers
of The Call.

PLATTSBURG, N. T., July 16.âGov
ernment engineers and surveyors have ar- '
rived at Champlain, Clinton County for j
the preliminary survey of the proposed j
great ship waterway between the lakes j
S and the Hudson, via the St. Lawrence !
River and Lake Champlain. Appropria- j
I tions for this survey have been made by i
i Congress, and it is thought the report of |
the engineers will be favorable to the con
1 struction of the canal.
The work now being done by the sur
veyors consists of estimates on excava

plain route is recommended by most of !
the leading engineers of the country. It â¢

Buffalo to New York can be reduced to 25 i
cents per ton by this route.

ThjE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.
COLONEL GP:ORGE STONE'S election to
the presidency of the national organization of
Republican League Clubs is a matter over
which there can he a good deal of congratulation.
It is gratifying to the Republicans of California to
have one of their number chosen to this high honor,
and it must Be gratifying also to the Republicans of
the nation at large that the direction of one of the
most potent and influential of the organizations of
the party is in the hands of a man so competent to use
it effectively in the coming campaign.
There is always a satisfaction in seeing a Califor
nian attain national recognition. We are so far from
the center of the population of the country that the
work of Californians is not often duly noted or known
in the East. When our delegates go beyond the

rare that they are recognized as men who are en

another evidence of the growing prestige of Califor

THE YOUTHS' DIRECTORY.
BY the stately parade and formal ceremonies at
tending the laying of the cornerstone of the
Youths' Directory, Nineteenth and Guerrero
streets, to-day, public attention will be again directed
to that institution and the good work to which it is
devoted.
It is altogether ripht and fitting that this should be
so. The Youths' Directory i* one of the most bene
ficent of the genuine charities of the city, and the oc
casion of laying the cornerstone of the building which
is to be its home and the theater of its activities de
serves to be made one of more than ordinary dignity
and solemnity.
To many men and many women honor is due for
the work they have qYme for the institution, and the
potent aid they have given in supporting it in the
past and in providing tlie means to erect a permanent
home for it. That honor will be given wherever the
good effects of the work have been felt and the names
of the workers are known. To one among them,
however. Father Crowley, special honor will be
given, for the upbuilding of the institution has been
with him an absorbing labor; he has given not a
part of his time and energy to it. but all; he has
identified himself ,vith it so completely that his name
and his memory will be forever associated with it.
So well known is the scope of the work of the
Youths' Directory that it hardly needs explanation to
any class of our people. Its beneficence is not con
fined to the youth of any particular class or portion
of our mixed and cosmopolitan population. To all
of the youth who need its help the help is given to
the extent of its power. It harbors homeless chil
dren irrespective of creed or nationality, and by rea
son of that liberality of good work it has been fa
vored with the sympathy and good will of all who
have any sympathy at all with self-sacrificing labors
for the welfare of humanity.
The powers are advising Spain to cede to this coun
try one or two unimportant islands in the Philippines
and then convert the rest into republics to be under
Spanish suzerainty. The powers might as well with
hold their counsel. Spain is not in a position to cede
the islands her title being shaky, and is not calcu
lated to engineer republics. Perhaps Europe may yet
awaken to the fact that Uncle Sam will be a factor in
the final adjustment.
The array of gentlemen who are announcing a lack
of desire to accept a Senatorship is becoming of im
posing length. Still, some of the individuals are put
ting themselves to unnecessary trouble, because the
public does not care whether they want to be sent to
Washington or not. having not the least intention
of thrusting the honor upon them.
While the Southern Pacific in providing cars run
ning from the water front to the ocean has done an
act that will be appreciated, the service is woefully
inadequate. It is not fair to ask patrons to ride mile
after mile standing, jammed, trodden on and hurtled
by the swaying throng hanging painfully to straps.
" The fact that the Irene prevented Aguinaldo from
landing was none of Dewey's business" declares a
German paper. All right. Then the fact that Dewey
considered the course of Aguinaldo none of the
Irene's business just makes honors easy.
America is paying a pretty stiff figure for war, yet,
considering the quality, cannot complain. But Spain
hasn't struck a bargain sale.
ThjE MONROE HEMISPHERE-
WHILE there may be differences of opinion in
regard to the position of the United States in
hegemony of the Monroe hemisphere, these are
confined to us and the nations within that hemis
phere. Necessary acts of war outside of that hemis
phere, in military conflict with a nation outside of it,
do not work any abandonment of the Monroe doc
trine provided they are defensive and not for con
quest. Such an act was the battle of Manila Bay, and
as its result we may hold the territory it put into our
hands until its people pay us for their enfranchise
ment, or by other means we are recouped the cost of
that campaign. To this policy no nation in the
European hemisphere may reasonably object.
To hold the Philippines as a permanent conquest
raises graver issues, which can be discussed as they
appear.
The West Indies and Hawaii lie within the Monroe
hemisphere, and what we do there is not of European
concern. If we hold Porto Rico, or take Cuba away
from the mongrel bandits who have mortgaged it to
American speculators and agitators, such action is to
be governed by our own interests solely, and Euro
pean interference would be an unfriendly act, sure to
rouse resentment.
So far, then, it is apparent that we have not pro
\oked any intrusion by Europe upon a field in which
â¢ our primacy is established by both policy and arms.
This view of it increases our responsibility. We
can, perhaps, settle issues easier with Europe, where
a rivalry of national interests sets up a system of
checks and balances which follows the flags of that
hemisphere into Asia and Africa, than with our Latin-
American neighbors. They are jealous of their
autonomy, resourceful and defiant.
If in our terms of peace with Spain we are hard,
and if we take Cuba away from the insurgents or dic
tate to them too much their future action, with the
example of Hawaii before them these neighbors in our
hemisphere will be roused to a watchfulness which
will harden into hatred.
In our present enterprise we have not a friend
among them. They are passive, but the coldness of
their negative position is unmistakable. The friend
ship generated in the Venezuela incident has evap
orated. The ties of a common ancestry ally their
sympathies with Spain. The traits of the Spanish
character and the heat of the Spanish blood are vital
from the Rio Grande to the Straits of Magellan.
Their aggregate population equals ours. If it
come to pass that they see in the fata of Hawaii a
settled policy of the United States toward its weaker
neighbors, if they are convinced that we desire ter
ritorial aggrandizement and seek it by inciting re
bellion and accepting sovereignty from its leaders
whom we first put in power, our own hemisphere
will offer a volume of problems which will occupy
our diplomacy and test maybe our capacity for a pro
longed military adventure far beyond our own
borders.
Perhaps our people are too sentimental. We may
think we deserve gratitude from these nations. We
may learn that gratitude is an elusive element in na
tional affairs. When do you find it toward England
as a survival of the leadership of William 111 against
Louis XIV, or the deliver)' of the Continent from
Napoleon at Waterloo?
It will appear that in the present situation we may
be little troubled about the attitude of Europe and
that our perplexities generate in the attitude of
America.
REVOLUTION IN THE COTTON TRADE.
A REVOLUTION in the cotton trade is threat
ened by the new process of putting the cotton
into shipping shape in round bales instead
of the old method of square ones. The Philadelphia
Public Ledger states that one of the largest capital
ists in Boston, together with a well-known sugar
trust man of New York, are actively interested in the
enterprise. This indicates that very effective efforts
may be made to introduce tire round baling system
which is claimed to be superior.
Nearly all improvements in industrial art work ul
timately for the general good, but most of them bring
about a very large amount of temporary loss during
the transition stage from the old order to the new,
and in this effect the change from the square to the
round bales seems likely to be unusually severe and
far reaching.
There are two ways in which such evil will be
risked in this purposed innovation. One is the com
monly experienced disasters that result from many
men being thrown out of employment and of much
capital invested in existing plants being practically
destroyed. The other is the possibility of the for
mation of a gigantic trust for the control of the cot
ton trade which would exceed in extent any other of
the big trusts of the country.
The magnitude of the first evil may be gathered
from the fact that there are scattered through the
South 40.000 ginning plants with the old outfit for
making square bales. These are worth about $50,000,
000, and are mostly held by small owners. They fur
nish work to about 160,000 day laborers and bring in
an income to them and the owners of some $10,000,
000 a year. Added to this must be the value of the
large compress plants used for concentrating the
square bales. There are 300 of these, worth on an
average $30,000 each, which makes $9,000,000 to be
destroyed by the new baling that throws them out of
date. The income of these presses is $4,000,000. Al
together it is estimated that by the present method
there is $25,000,000 yearly earned by the laborers and
small owners in the South.
It is supposed that by th*e new process only 4250
gins would be required to handle the entire cotton
crop. These would be located, as oil mills now are,
along the railway, and the presses would not be sold,
but be worked on a royalty.
This concentration of the ginning and baling under
the control of a few large capitalists would naturally
be followed by a control of the buying, and compe
tition in buying would be greatly restricted and per
haps altogether prevented and the price regulated
arbitrarily by a board of the combine. This state of
affairs might come about just as other great trusts
have grown to power, and just as the cattle trade
came under the domination of a few men in Chicago.
Cotton, moreover. wouhd afford a much larger field
for a trust than either sugar, or oil. or cattle. Not
only the immense value of the lint, but the oil and
the meal made from the cotton seed would likely be
controlled by the round bale ginneries.
However great these threatened evils may be, if
the round bale is really a decided improvement on the
square hale the innovation will come and it ought to
come. Though it may be difficult to do away with the
evils of trusts, it is against the trusts, and not against
the round bale, that opposition should be roused. As
for the loss of capital and employment, this seems
inevitable in all forward industrial movement.
Powder mill explosions have a queer habit of hap
pening in pairs. This fact has a tendency to make
th*m look less like strokes of Providence than evi
dence that not all of Spain's friends have gone to the
front to do their fighting.
There will be no fatted calves sacrificed when Toral
and Linares get back to Spain.
THE SAX FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULT 17, 1398.
UNPATRIOTIC CORPORATIONS.
Q TTENTION was yesterday directed to perni
/ \ cious evasion of the war tax by the Wells-
Fargo Express Company. While that concern
is guilty of defying the statute, of withholding sup
port from the Government which protects it, and of
imposing upon the patrons from whom it draws divi
dends, it is not alone in its lack of patriotism. There
are other corporations pursuing a course equally un
grateful and despicable.
The management of the Telephone Company an
nounces with an air of virtue that it will pay the
war tax; actually pay the war tax specifically im
posed upon it by Congress. Here's an instance ot
gfacious condescension, to be jure. There was
nothing else for it to do. It has struck the pose as
of a philanthropist, but it is merely obeying the law.
To demonstrate this, the part of the act governing is
given in full:
"It shall be the duty of every person, firm or cor
poration owning or operating any telephone line or
lii.es to make, within the first fifteen days of each
month, a sworn statement to the collector of in
ternal revenue in each of their respective districts,
stating the number of messages or conversations
transmitted over their respective lines during the pre
ceding month, for which a charge of 15 cents or more
was imposed, and for each of such messages or con
versations the said person, firm or corporation shall
pay a tax of 1 cent."
Of course there is a mild triumph in forcing a cor
poration to obey the law, but that it does so after it
has endeavored to play a Wells-Fargo confidence
game, and found that it couldn't, gives it no excuse
lor beuig puffed with pride. There is absolutely no
warrant for the scheme the (fcmpany devised of mak
ing customers pay the tax on all messages bearing
tolls of less than 50 cents, itself to pay the rest. * The
message costing more than half a dollar to transmit
is a comparative rarity. The corporation was en
deavoring to let its treasury down easy, and the reso
lution to lead a better life came very late. The Call
has bills from the Telephone Company, bearing date
of July 16, 1898, wherein charges are made for the
war revenue taxes for messages sent from this of
nce. There seems to be a conflict between this fact
and the talk of the management. Frankly, the com
pany has been making its patrons pay that which it
should have paid, and finding that the patrons would
not submit, that the law meant what It said, has de
cided, so it declares with a conscious air of good
ness, that it will conduct its affairs in a lawful way.
Its bills do not yet substantiate this. Let the com
pany refund what it has illegally exacted. If it shall
not do so, the cloud of suspicion now over its char
acter will remain.
The Western Union Telegraph Company is worse.
It pretends to believe the law exempts it, that it
stands on a different plane from another company
engaged in the transmission of messages. It docs
not pay the tax, and declares it will not pay. The
Western Union has been the gainer by the war to the
extent of thorsands of dollars daily; It enjoys pro
tection and special privileges under the Government
to whose support it now meanly declines to con
tribute. It has secured a construction of the law
by which it is declared not bound to pay the tax.
That Congress intended to bind it, and that it is
morally bound, there can be no question. In all
probability it will find itself legally bound also.
Meantime it will filch from the people who patronize
it, and force these people to pay the tax out of pay
ment of which it sneaks- in a fashion most contempti
ble. It should be brought to its-senses with a sud
denness, and made to refund, as well as conduct its
business as Congress has instructed. And when this
has happened, the Western Union need not go to
the trouble of posing as the essence of patriotism,
either.
A United States Commissioner in lowa has ruled
that express companies must pay a war tax. The
telephone people say they will, although they haven't;
but the Western Union, richest of all, profiting most
of all from the war, asserts that it doesn't have to,
and won't. We confess to a lack of admiration for
such greed.
ASSESSOR DALTON'S AMBITION.
T"HE Third Street Boodler, of $30,000 Southern
Pacific contract fame, announces the candidacy
of Assessor Dalton of Alameda for member of
the State Board of Equalization by charging The Call
with a desire to thwart his ambition. This is a
roundabout way of putting a man forward for an
office, but it is customary for boodle newspapers to
approach the sack with great caution. In their cases
conscience seems always to be working, and their
indirection is undoubtedly the result of a desire to
conceal their motives from the observation of an often
not very observing public.
But the Boodler is mistaken in thinking that we
object to Assessor Dalton being a candidate for the
State Board of Equalization. In fact, we greatly pre
fer him to Mr. Morehouse, the railroad's friend,
whose aspirations the Boodler says he intends
fo antagonize. The latter's theory of equali
zation is very objectionable to us. For six
teen years he has expended his energies in
cutting down railroad assessments and increasing
those of the real and personal property taxpayers of
the city. We regard this as a false theory, notwith
standing the Boodler has frequently supported it as
openly as, it dared. During the twenty two months
in which our contemporary drew $1000 a month from
the Southern Pacific Corrtpany it was a silent ad
mirer of Mr. Morehouse's propensity for equalizing
assessments in favor of the monopoly.
There are, however, insuperable objections to As
sessor Dalton as a member of the State Board of
Equalization. His talent for assessing the property
of others is ton highly developed. True, he has so
far exercised this talent upon the railroad, but what
guarantee have we that immediately upon being
elected State Equalizer he will not begin to exercise
it at the expense of the people of this city? More
house was also a "reform" Assessor of Alameda
County. His tendency to cut down railroad assess
ments and increase those of other people was never
developed until he began his work at Sacramento.
Notwithstanding the vigorous attempts made by the
unanimous press of this city to change this system
(except during the twenty-two months the Examiner
was on the railroad payroll) Morehouse has never
been able to see why he and the railroad should pay
any taxes at all.
Doubtless Assessor Dalton would, for the purposes
iof the Boodler, be a good State Equalizer. He might
! decline to imitate Morehouse and at Sacramento re
! siime his quest for railroad gore. In that event a
| situation might be created which would enable the
Boodler to regain its old place at the Southern Pa
cific crib. It is well known that one of the favorite
; methods of this sheet for bringing corporations to
! time is to create a crisis in their financial affairs.
; What could be more profitable than the Dalton
. theory of equalization, apnlied to the railroad, with
j the Boodler in control and aWe at any time to put a
stop to proceedings? The figure could easi!v be mnde
I $2000 instead of $1000 a month under such circum
â¢ stances.

With the characteristic bravery of
the anonymous, some unknown critic
writes to crush me for having "at
tacked" Hubbard T. Smith. The ex
tent of my offending was that I re
buked Mr. Smith for having claimed to
have written a song which had been
written by Eugene Field. Even un
der the light of a correction coming
from a source which chooses not to
reveal itself, I fail to see wherein I
erred save perhaps in the direction of
mildness. It is true, as the critic af
firms with evident feeling, that my re
marks did not appear until after Smith
had disappeared, but Smith must share
the burden of this fault. Probably it
was inconvenient for him to wait over
for the next ship, so as to see what I
would have to say about him, while the
impracticability of my saying anything
before his pretense had been published
can be grasped even by the intelligence
of the person who writes stuff to which
he is afraid to append his name. It
matters nothing that on occasions
Smith may have said that he only com
posed the music of the song. On the
particular occasion to which reference
was had he asserted unqualifiedly that
the song was his, and as the song is
not his I think the justification for
calling attention to the fact complete.
Furthermore, the next anonymous as
sailant who projects himself into my
notice will wish he hadn't if the type
writer can stand the strain.
There is some satisfaction in noting
that the flock to which Edwards Davis
formerly ministered is being scattered.
No better use could be thought of for
a flock which would deliberately listen

than to the pulpit. Now, if Davis him
self will scatter, the sense of gratifica
tion will be promoted to an actual joy.
A Call subscriber sends me a clip
ping from the Washington Star to
show that In disagreeing with the
treasonable sentiments ascribed to Sen
ator Wellington of Maryland I "over
shot the mark." My expressions were
based on a direct accusation made in
the Baltimore American news columns
and discussed at length editorially in
the same and the following issues.
Whether or not I overshot the mark
depends upon a decision aa to which
paper lied. There is no way available
by which to ascertain. I certainly
have no desire to misrepresent the
sentiments of Senator Wellington nor
anybody else. lam puzzled, however,
to understand how in overshooting so
lofty a mark as Wellington I happened
to hit the sort of a person who divorces
himself from his name every time he

Having received a word of commend
ation, the Post in its pleased surprise
prints it as "Praise from St. Hubert."
The gentleman upon whose approba

However, it is not to be wondered at
that the Post should have acted on the

By the latest steamer from Australia
came a story about a tiger trainer who
has suffered the discomfort of being
eaten by a feline in whose education
there had evidently been some defect.
The spectacle, of course, was not a
pleasing one, yet I can imagine no use
for a tiger trainer save to furnish his
pupil with a meal. As between trainer
and tiger my sympathy is always with
the captive beast. He is kept in a
cage, to which he may grow accus
tomed and cease to pine, but he never
becomes inured to the red hot iron, the
lash and the utility of being prodded
with a pitchfork until induced to jump
through a hoop must be beyond his
grasp. He belongs to a family en
dowed by the Creator with a bad tem
per and a taste for meat. When man
meat invades his cage he feels resent
ful, and when, by hostile demonstra
tion, the man-meat invites disaster, I
do not see where the ground for pity
ing him appears, if the invitation be
accepted. There are methods by which
one may avoid contributing to the gus
tatory delight of a tiger, and the best
of all is to keep away from there.
In the name of a tortured humanity
I wish to enter protest against the
abominable form of unnatural crime
known as the "coon song." As a rule
this song is absolutely without merit of
melody and the words are worse than
idiotic, for they indicate that the writer
must have sense enough to know that
he is making a fool of himself. I have
in mind particularly a recently pub
lished outrage, entitled "Honey, You're
the Warmest Gal in Town." The title
is in Itself an indecency, according to a
late decision by Judge Morrow, who had
to pass upon a similar breach of good
manners concerning the proprietorship
of wjilch two persons had had the
nerve to quarrel. Ido not know the
tune written for the words, but if it
were a refrain stolen from the celestial
choir it would be inadequate to the
raising of the song to a plane of re
spectability. It may be noticed that
chronic offenders have a mania for us
ing "baby" and "lady," as though the
result resembled rhyme. These terms
rhyme in the mellifluous perfection of
"crocodile" and "alligator." I cannot
understand why such things can be
published, but as they are published
at intervals painfully short there must
be a demand for them. In this cir
cumstance is a powerful argument in
support of Nordau's theory of degener
ation, and it is strange the investiga
tor should have overlooked it. If the
songs were really tough, of course they
would appeal to a certain class, but
they are not this. They aro simply
silly, and marked by the crudest form
Of vulgarity, unrelieved by a flash of
wit or a touch of pretty sentiment.

For a time most of the papers of the

cupled acres admirably adapted to the
use of soldiers. Why are they not
utilized? Ido not know, but in the
present arrangement there is a shame
less job. Â£ut of the Kansas regiment
alone six men have died. The colonel
begged to be allowed to go to the Pre
sidio, and the request was refused. The
New York men arrived, smelled the
situation over, and demanded to be
given a place on the reservation. They
got it. The New Yorkers have more
money than the Kansans. They came
here with a pull so strong that the rep
utation of it preceded them. But in
patriotism the Kansan is the equal of
the New Yorker, to his country his life
is as valuable. The distinction made
between them is nothing but an exhi
bition of red tape. Technically, the
New Yorker belongs to the Department
of California, and the Kansan to the
Philippine expeditionary forces. In
reality they are both soldiers who have
volunteered to serve their country, and
it is not fair that either should be
obliged to take up quarters on the
reeking sands of Camp Merrltt. Their
lives are their country's, but this gives
the country no excuse for throwing
them away. Camp Merritt should bo
abolished, not when the last fleet has
sailed for the islands, but to-day.
According to a Chicago paper, a Bos
ton minister recently advertised that
he would speak in the morning on j
"Reasons for Resting in the Loving j
Arms of God," and In the evening on
"To Hell With Spain." It is the priv- :
ilege of any man to look on the Chi- j
cago paper with suspicion, yet the |
name of the minister Is given, and his
address. I refrain from mentioning
them here, for the reason that the ad
vertising rates are not so arranged as
to cover matter appearing in this col- j
umn. If there is such a preacher, he ;
is a blackguard.
"Publlcola" has written another let
ter to this paper. Like the first, it
was an able production within narrow
lines. It is plausible reading, but can
not bear the test of analysis. It sim
ply argues that the United States hav
ing been successful should not pre
sume to reach out to greater- things.
I cannot acquiesce, but being only an
Individual, this makes no material dif
ference. If the rules laid down by
"Publlcola" were to be followed, there
would be an end to progress. Apply
them to personal effort, and their fal
lacy at once becomes apparent. He
would have the nation do now as it did
when an infant. According to his idea
logically worked out, we should still
be carrying grist to mill with a stone
in one end of the sack. I do not see
how he reconciles himself to advance
ment as displayed in private life, w hile
so strenuously objecting to anything
akin to advancement in national life.
He would build a wall, across which
the liberty and civilization we some
times seem to enjoy could not pass.
This strikes me as being at once self
ish and suicidal. It Is all very well
to say we have sufficient territory for
three hundred million people, but I
notice that with something like
seventy-five million there are strong
men begging vainly for work, women
hungry and girls crowding boys out of
a chance to earn bread. The common
people cannot develop the country, be
cause it does not belong to them. It be
longs to corporations and money loan
ers, who in turn are to a great extent
the property of the devil. The
people cannot develop its indus
tries, because monopoly has seized
these, and perhaps does not want
them developed. "Publicola" is
misled by the notion that the United
States is a place of sweet content. It
is far from it. There are threatening
murmurs. There is an energy that
finds no outlet. Therefore, I believe
in enlargement. Perhaps in distant
lands there may be a chance for the
poor man. If our civilization is better
than the savagery of the Philippines
let it expand. If It is not, let It re
main at home and accustom itself to
half rations, and the reign of Rocke
fellers, Hannas, Huntingtons and
Sages. But I believe it is better.

that General Miles has not been spar

the burden and heat and awful respon

and that the feeling throughout the
army ought to be similar to that en

DIRECT FROM NORTHERN PORT -
The proposal to ship troops direct from
Fort Monroe or other available points on
the Northern Atlantic coast, In place of
sending the men down to Southern Flor
ida, seems a timely departure. Much has
been said about seasoning our men by
having them camp on the Florida sand
patches, but there is a big doubt whether
there is not more exhaustion than valu
able seasoning in the process. Southern
Florida at this time of the year is not a
whit less uncomfortable than Cuba. The
heat is just as intense on the sandy soil,
while the mosquitoes bite almost, if not
alT' ther, as fiercely. In as few days as
it taAes to go to Tampa or Miami by the
hot and tiresome railroad cars, swift and
commodious vessels of the St. Louis and
Harvard and Yale type would take our
-soldiers direct to Santiago.
This method of sea transportation will
not, of course, be relished by the rail
roads, which .have already amassed big
bills against the War Department â rumor
puts them at $15.000 .i.iOOâ but If it conduces
to the swifter passage and great ?r com
fort of our troops, the Idea deserves to he
encouraged. The. sea trip has to be male,
after all even from Tampa or Key West,
With the better class of boats it coull le
made at once from the Atlantic ports at
no loss of time, while eliminating the ilis
comforts of Southern ramps and South
ern railroads.â Pittsburg Dispatch.

715 Market Street.A BUILDING THAT HYPNOTIZES.
Secret of Dilatory Tactics of Hall of Justice
Contractors Revealed by the Strange Ad
venture of John Garcia.
The long hoped for but hardly expected Hall of Justice Is fascinating.
This is what has delayed the construction so long, but the fact was not
evolved until yesterday, and it accounts for a multitude of things. The
subtle influence has captivated the contractorâ he can't get away from it;
it e.xrrts Itself over the laborers and they move around like men under a
hypnotic spell awaiting the words of a conjuror who is slow of speech; the
Fame influence has attracted hundreds of spiders which have deftly shackled
chamber, corridor and doorway with gossamer threads.
The Influence has never been known to extend to those not immediately
connected with the building, save, perhaps, to a stray Grand Jury or two,
until last Friday night. About 9 o'clock a stranger sauntered up toward
the monumental pile of building materials. He was tall, gaunt and unshaven,
and his eyes had the glassy stare of a man crazed from hunger. He turned
from Kearny into Merchant street, with his eyes fixed on the site for the
building, and those who saw tell in awesome whispers that his eyes glared
wilder and his breath came in short gasps. Twice he attempted to tear him
self away and twice failed. He was drawn to the fatal spot like a chip to
the vortex of a whirlpool. By a superhuman effort he avoided one of the
stones which hns been placed in position, but landed flat against the board
fence on Dunbar alley and stuck there as though he were a part of It.
People came ami went, but like the workmen on the building, he seemed
as though he would stay forever. At first his presence was hardly com
mented upon, those who noticed him thinking he was but one of the work
men stooping for a shovel who had forgotten it was quitting time. "When
day broke, however, he was still there and both the workmen were en
gaged In argument as to the Increase of cobwebs at another end of the
building.
At 9 o'clock Deputy Coroner McCormack telephoned to the California
Police Station and the man was taken away In the patrol wagon, after hav
ing stood in one spot for fully twelve hours without having moved a mus
cle. He was locked up on a charge of drunk, but had the affair happened
anywhere but in front of the hoodooed building he would probably have
been sent to the hospital to be examined as to his sanity. He gave the
name of John Garcia and his nativity as France, and then crouched sullenly
in his ceil, refusing to talk.

The Bummer meeting of the P. C. T. H.

Ketchum. the- odds-on favorite at 4 to 5,
was beaten on the stretch in a hurricane
finish by both Butcher Boy and William
P.uker. The heat was 2:17, and Mizner
rated the winner well, never lifting his
hand, while Sullivan, behind Baker,
teamed for life to get place, bets cashed.
The field was even up with Ketchum in
the auctions, and the followers of Ma

that its recipient need have no fear of

Ned Thorn was even money a place, and
even better early in the selling. The "Ter
rible Swede"â Hellmanâ knows a trick or
two about strong arm work as his drive
with May li later disclosed.
Toggles again won the open trot, and
went two splendid heatsâ 2:l24 and 2:13*4
âdriven out by Zombro and Ethel Downs
In turn. Prices wore: Zombro 4 to 5
throughout; Toggles opened at even
money, but it was 7 to 10 for the second
heat. They raced to suit him. as the first
half in I:OSVi and I:O6Vs left him to finish,
as Aster and Ethel did the carrying.
Clark evidently has the Strathvay horse
at concert pitch, and with helpers can go
quite- a race. Were he to bo driven away
fast it might be different at the place
where they pay off. Zombro is sore and
had too many, fast workouts. He should
be let up for a while, then in the fall
races should cut quite a fi-ure. The fin
ishes were close enough to arouse enthu
siasm, but Zombro's breaks cost dearly
Hellman let Oslto win the 2:15 special
behind May B, as he didn't want a mark
out of the 2:20 class. She could have
made Oslto take quite a record more ear
nestly driven. Mojave was unsteady and
Silver Ring broke at the far turn "when
going fast toward the front. Osito was a
hot tip, and opening at 3 to 2 soon went
to 3 to 5. Our Lucky was a frost, and the
best man 1n Americaâ Geersâ couldn't
have got the money, he being sore from
excessive trlaling. Thomnson was rank
and barely beat the fence. The time
2:IS I A. looks easy for Osito. but May B
could have taken three seconds out of
him with a drive.
The closing race of the day was Pilot
McClellan's handily in 2:22%. quite a drop
from 2:29 V*. his old mark. "Billy" John
son had Melvar where he looked to win
but fatal breaks ended his chances of
victory in the second quarter. Mo.Clellan
was well supported at 3 to 5. and Dona
than took care to be well In front at the
finish, driving it out to the wire.
The so-called match race. Campaigner
vs. Illustrious, was declared off, the as
sociation refusing to stand for a repeti
tion of Friday's farce.
From here 'most trainers will ship to
home tracks. Napa has a meeting: Au
gust 15 to 13 Inclusive, with good purses
and horsemen will do well to make en
tries at once. The old system of 3 in 5
heat races will be resumed, as the meet
ing just closed showed conclusively that
it would take a Philadelphia lawyer to
decipher the moves of some of the drivers
when they know the rules do not quite
cover this style of race procedure.
The association came out ahead, de
spite all drawbacks, and undoubtedly a
return to Eastern methods, together with
better work with the bell rope and a gen
eral hustling to get the events off on
schedule time, would p-iv- It is likely
that a fall meeting will be hold with
goodly purses and a few drawing attrac

GILT EDGES
OUTPLAYED
Athletics Do the Trick
Easily.
HUCHINSON PLAYS BALL
FITZPATRICK'S PITCHING WAS
BEALLY EXCELLENT.
The Game the Best Seen at Recrea
tion Park This Season and
Its Result a Big
Surprise.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Exquisitely attired and manifesting an
Inconceivable amount of vivacity, the
Gilt Edges of Sacramento yesterday
made their first appearance at Recrea
tion Park since the consolidation, and
were defeated by the Athletics to the tune
of 5 to 1.
Owing to their enviable reputation and ]
the fact that they generally give an ex
cellent account of themselves, the banner
Saturday crowd of the season turned out
and gave them a most flattering recep
tion. It was one of those erood-natured,
enthusiastic audiences, the members of
which could almost exist on a ball game
and feel that their errand in this trouble
some world was properly completed.
But what was most surprising, consid
ering that the majority of them were San
Franciscans, was the indescribable man
ner in which they rooted for those Gilt
.bilges. It was aggravating in the ex
treme to those who expected that the
brunt of the applause, if not all of it,
would be given to the team representing
this city. This failure to properly cheer
the home team must be attributable to
the extensive popularity of those Gilt
Edges. It certainly was due to no other |
cause, for they were outplayed at every
point of the game In a manner so con
vincing that to realize the fact encoun
ters no opposition even in an unpreju
diced mind.
To those who were deprived of the
pleasure of seeing the game the statement
that the "great Gilt Edges" were out
played at every point may appear er
roneous. It is, nevertheless, true, and,
furthermore, they were fortunate even in
scoring at all. Not until tue seventh in
ning did they manage to get a man across
the plate, and this man was none other
than that old California favorite, Ed
Hutchinson.
His appearance once again on a Cali
fornia diamond was hailed with delight !
by those who were able to recognize him, I
and they were numerous. The reception j
accorded him was fluttering indeed, and
it goes without saying that if those lev
ers of the game who were so conspicu
ous at the old Halght-street grounds but
a few years ago were advised of his reap
pearance the reception accorded him I
would no doubt have contained more than ]
applauses. Considering that his appear
ance was a complete surprise, for it was
in every respect, the welcome extended !
him could not have been better.
The "old favorite" did not play as well
as is possible for him, yet under the cir
cumstances it was really good. He made
one error, which resembled the kind so
often visible when the Friscos or Oak
lands play, and struck out once the first
time up, which, no doubt, was the result
of stage fright. He, however, covered
himself with glory by throwing a man
out at first on a single to right field, and
scoring the only run for his cohorts.
This came about through his two-base
hit, followed by a single by Doyle.
Next to Hutchinson in regard to re
ceptions came "Spike" Hennesey, the pre
mier first baseman of the league. His re
appearance was the cue for very violent
demonstrations, and for a moment I
imagined 1 saw the Peking in company
with our noble Dewey returning. It was
only "Spike," however, and may the "dear
boy" live to make a million hits in one
season. His playing at the Initial bag was
of the National League order, and his
team's defeat was no fault of his. He
took it very much to heart, however, yet
still entertains the opinion that November
will find his team the champions of the
Pacific Coast League. Yesterday's game
â  sort of puts a damper on "Spike's"
opinion.
To beat the Gilt Edges occasionally is
I baseball pure ana simple; but to outplay
i them in every position and in every part
I of the game at both bat and in the field
is a different proposition. This, as I said
before Is what the Athletics accom
plished yesterday. They defeated the Gilt
Edges, and did not leave even the shadow
: of a doubt.
The game was by far the best seen at
Recreation Park this season.
The Athletics, realizing the difficult task
before thorn, entered the contest with
unusual alacrity, despite the fact. They
played a careful, steady and noble game,
accepting hard and easy chances in a
manner that would have woÂ« the ap
probation of a National League audience.
Stultz at short and Sully at second
! played like demons, never faltering, and
nothing even resembling an error was
visible in their play.
Fitzpatrick was never in better form
and his fondest hopes were realized at
the expiration of the game. He made
the statement that he longed for a chance
at those "leaders," and when the chance
presented Itself he did not weaken. To
his superb twirling is due a big portion
of that, victory, for all through the long
nine Innings he kept at his work and
was found safely but seldom.
His opponent, Doyle, displayed his usual
cunning but was hit opportunely, and
coupled with his rather ragged support
had a hard road to travel. He was per
sistent, however, to the end. The leader*
did not play the game they are capable
of. Stanley was way oft in his throwing,
and to his inability is due the fact thai
the Athletics stole so many bases. He
caught, if I remember correctly, but one
man In the game, while there were op
portunities galore. Hughes at second was
also a trifle to the bad, making three
errors. Your work yesterday is not In
line with your brother's, Mr. fjughes, and
you must keep up the reputation. He !Â»
doing wonderful tilings back East, and
we naturally expect the same of you out
here. Strange, but true.
Yesterday's contest is but another as
surance that the teams are playing ex
cellent ball. If they can keep up thÂ«
Sace, which is now all that could bÂ«
eslred, the success of the league is as
sured. The public will patronize good
ball and now that the teams are playlnj,
thrlr best and putting up excellent ball
it is time to turn out and whooÂ£ it up.

SPECULATORS TURN
FROM WHEAT TO CORN
THE LOCAL MARKET SHOWS
A FIRM UNDERTONE.
Conditions on the Pacific Coast,
While Good, Are Not So Favor
able as They Were Ten
Days Ago.
Nothing special has come Into wheat
speculation during the week Just closed.
The visible supply decreased 2.185,00 c
bushels, making the total visible supply
12.516,000 bushels, against 14.702,000 bushels
the previous week and 16,609.000 the same
week In 1897. World's shipments, 6,051.000
bushels, against 4,206,000 the same period
last year. The movement of new wheat
has been heaviest In the Southwestern
States. Farmers" deliveries of wheat to
market throughout the Middle West are
very small, showing farmers are disposed
to store their wheat and await develop
merits. The Government report for July
makes the spring and winter wheat crops
515,000,000 bushels. Spring wheat condi
tions have suffered materially since the
compiling of the Government report.
Winter wheat thrashing returns con
tinue disappointing, many sections report
ing very light yield with quality poor.
In order that spring wheat conditions
may not deteriorate, the most favorable
weather must prevail, which is hardly to
be expected. The next thirty days will
shape conditions so that a reasonable idea
may be had of the future of wheat prices.
Speculation has been somewhat stunneu
so far as the scalping crowd are con
cerned on account of the war tax, whlcn
cuts more of a figure than would appear
at first thought. Many prominent wheat
operators have turned their attention
from wheat to corn.
There seems a growing sentiment that
the corn crop this year will bo a small
one. The small stocks now in sight maxe
manipulation very easy. The Govern
ment report would indicate a 2.000.000,1)00
crop. The trade disregards the report, as
there seems no good ground upon which
to base such a large crop. A strong corn
market would influence wheat prices to
some extent.
Conditions of wheat abroad during the
week wero leas favorable than tho pre
vious week, England reporting unfavor
able weather. Some complaint was re
ported from Russia. Chicago stocks ol
wheat in store are less than 25,000 bushels,
the smallest ever known. New wheat ar
riving is being taken by millers. Grading
is reported fair.
Conditions on the Pacific Coast while
good are not as favorable as they were
ten days ago. Hot, strong north winds
have done no little damage. During the
past week Washington and Oregon re
ported more or less damage. The local
wheat market has maintained a firm
undertone of late. At times spot wheat
was in poor request, but futures dis
played considerable strength. The market
is kept in an overrated condition, which
accounts for the firmness. Small receipts
appear, warding off bear attacks.
Barley was bulled at Jl 21V4 for Decem
ber by local manipulation. The talent arÂ»
beginning to get bullish. It would seem
the top has about been reached. Deliv
eries should soon increase. Consumption
is rapidly growing less. The good barley
crops abroad will sooner or later depress
American prices from an export baais.

Death of Mrs. John Morton.
Mrs. Lucetta Morton, wife of J-ohn Mor
ton, the pioneer warehouse proprietor
and drayman, passed away last Friday at
the age of 78 years. The deceased was one
of the founders of the San Francisco La
dies' Protection and Relief Society, and
has been a constant friend and advisor
of its management, having been one of
the board of directors from its inception.
To her and a few other charitable ladies
this society owes its useful existence, as
It was principally her financial aid that
not only_ gave it its start, but, in fact,
maintained it through its many struggles
for an existence.
Her husband and two sons survive her.
The funeral will take place to-day at 2

A CLASH OF AUTHORITY
AMONG THE GENERALS
THE following orderâ short, concise
and apparently fraught with un
weicome significance â caused a
w;i!!ing and a gnashing of teeth
at Camp Merritt yesterday after
noon In the ranks of the troops which.
up to that hour, had confidently ex
pected to sail in the next few days for
Manila:
Headquarters Independent Division,
Eighth. Army Corps, Camp Mer
ritt, San Francisco, Cal., July 16,
1898.
Special Orders No. 6.
6. Special orders issued from
these headquarters July 15, 1898, di
recting the preparation in packing of
all goods and effects for transfer to
steamer Pennsylvania and Rio de Ja
nerio, are hereby revoked.
By command of Brigadier General
Miller. S. W. BELFORD,
Assistant Adjutant General, U. S.
Volunteers.
The orders revoked In so few words
were Issued on Friday by Brigadier
General Miller. They directed the com
manding officers of the different troops
already announced to nail to immedi
ately place their camp equipment
aboard ship.
The revoking order was accompanied
by no explanation. To the. officers to
whom H -\; j .s directed it meant only one
thingrâ the fifth expedition was off;
had been declared or something
[ual Importance had transpired to
render more troops not necessary.
ilation of the wildest sort was rife.
They were looking to the wrong quar
ter for reasons, however, and as it
transpires were exasperating the im
port of the order. It was San Fran
not Washington, from which the
â  !. It was not i prema
ture â¢â >â :!''â¢. it was simply Major General
Merriam Insisting upon exercising the
prerogatives of his rank.
And thereby hangs a tale of no small
interest.
When Major General Otis set sail for
the uncertain front he left specific in
structions with Brip"ulier General Mil
ler in regard to moving the next expedi
tion. He instructed his successor in
command to Issue orders to have the
troops ready to sail as soon as practi
cable. Pursuant to these instructions
from his chief Brigudier General Miller
on Friday caused to be issued the or
ders before mentioned. General Miller
understood that he was to occupy the
same relative position to General Mer
riani as that held by Major General
(_>t;s to Major General Merritt.
He was disabused of this idea just
as Boon a* his orders caught the eye of
ral Merriaxn.
Tho general demanded an explana
tion and it was given alonp the lines
Btated above. It \va3 not satisfactory.
nml General Miller was pointedly told
that thereafter all orders would issue
from General Merriam's headouarters,
or by his orders, and he was further
ordered to rev* ko all orders issued yes
terday and to reissue them from the
new fountain head of authority.
In consequence General Miller's or
der â  is revoked and in its place the
following addressed to the commanding
officer of the First Montana and First
Calif' >rnia recruits was issued:
Headquarters Independent Division,
Eighth Army Corps, Camp Mer
ritt, San Francisco, Cal., July 16,
1898.
Special Orders No. 6.
9. Pursuant to instructions from
major general commanding the De
partment of California, the com
manding officer First Montana
United States Volunteers will with
out delay place his regiment in
condition to embark on the steam
er Pennsylvania, designated to pro
ceed to the Philippine Islands.
All heavy baggage of every kind,
except such as is absolutely neces
sary for the maintenance of his
camp, will be packed and sent
to the steamer Pennsylvania, now at
Pier No. 7. Oceanic dock, to be placed
aboard said steamer not later than 3
o'clock p. m. Sunday, July 17, 1898.
He will break camp and march his
troops to the steamer Pennsylvania
with the balance of the baggage be
longing to his command, arriving at
the dock of said steamer for embark
ation not later than 10 o'clock a. m.
Monday, July 18. 1898.
By command of Brigadier General
Miller. S. W. BELFORD,
Assistant Adjutant General, IT. S.
Volunteers.
No orders are issued as yet for the
Rio de Janeiro but it is officially stated
that it will sail on Wednesday at 10
o'clock in the morning. The two bat
talions from South Dakota, under
Colonel Frost, will break camp on that
day.
Brigadier General Otis f ally decided

Regimental Chaplain.
CAMP BARRETT. Sather Station,' July
16.â The selection of a chaplain for the
Eighth California United States Volun
teer Infantry was made to- day by Colonel
Turk Henshnw. There were over forty

the Church of the Holy Spirit In that city.
The new chaplain is a Lutheran and a
very spiritual man. The Christian men of

the regimental staff. He will- rank as a
captain, drawing the same pay.

Health of the New York
Troopsâ New Guns for the
Alger Battery.
The Presidio has again i n some degree
assumed the proportions and appearances
of its former glory, as far as the en
campment of the volunteer forcee is con
cerned. The advent of the First New York
on Friday and the troop of Utah cavalry
yesterday has added materially to the
strength of the forces now upon the res
ervation. The removal of these two com
mands from Camp Merritt to the Presidio
means an increase of nearly 1500 men in
the troops now at the latter place. There
was a large crowd out yesterday to in
spect the camp of the New York boys
! is pitched with beautiful alignment
on the ground formerly occupied by the
two battalions of the Sixth California
Regiment and Fourteenth United States
Infantry. The officers' tents are opposite
the company streets while just across the
main roadway of the Presidie and upon
tile slope that rises from it. are the
quarters of Colonel Barber and his field
and staff. vÂ«Â»Â«*
Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole was in
charge of the camp yesterday. Colonel
Barber remaining in town at the Palace
Hotel. He was feeling somewhat indis
posed, so remained in the city to recuDnr
ate Nearly all of the men were given
their liberty yesterday, and they took ad
vantage of the opportunity to visit the
h'natown. To-day the lines of discipline
will be drawn very closely, and to-mor
row the dally drills with dress parade will
be inaugurated. The health or the rp E l
ment is excellent. There 1b not a single
man in the hospital. The only soldier in
capacitated is Private Warner of Com
pany A. who is in the Frenoh Hospital
wit , h ,? fractured kneecap as the result of
a fall from the baggage car after the
regiment reached Oakland. One very no

the high regard that they have for their

They swear by their chief, and they are
loud in singing hla pral B es for having the

All the officers of the New York regi

at the Presidio have been put up at the
Officers' Club. Lieutenant Colonel Stac
pole and twelve other officers were enter
tained last night at the club at dinner by
Colonel Morris and the members of the
Presidio Club.
The Utah Cavalry, under the command
of Lieutenant Smith, moved their camp
from Camp Merritt to the Presidio yester
day. The troop arrived at the Presidio
about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and went

The Wyoming, "Alger," Light Battery
Is to exchange its four 3-inch muzzle

be sent over this week.
The Sutro Baths will bo turned over to

DESERVED PROMOTION.
Honors Gained by Officers Who
Were Recently Stationed in
This City.
Many officers of the United States army
recently stationed In San Francisco have
gained recognition and promotion since
the beginning of the present war. Gen
eral Shafter, who was ordered from the
command of the Department of Califor
nia to the front, is now a major general,
and has Just received through the Presi
dent the profound thanks of the Ameri
can people for his brilliant achievements
at Santiago. Day before yesterday the
announcement came by wire from Wash
ington that Samuel B. M. Young, for
merly of the Fourth Cavalry at the Pre
sidio, had be>en promoted from brigadier
to major general. Accounts from the
front report that General Sam Young was
in the thickest of the fight at El Caaey.
A rich widow of San Francisco, who at
one time thought of allowing a friend to
indicate to Colonel Young that an army
career would not be contrary to her in
clinations, may now regTet that she did
not authorize the negotiations.
William M. Graham, who was formerly
colonel of the Fifth United States Artil
lery and post commander at the Presidio,
now holds the rank of major general, and
is on the list to take a prominent part in
the next campaign against the enemy.
John D. ...liley, formerly lieutenant of
the Fifth United States Artillery, has
been promoted to major and adjutant
general in the staff corps. Major Miley
is also one of the Commissioners ap
pointed to fix the terms for the capitula
tion of the Spanish army at Santiago.

obtaining from the officials at Washington such favors and concessions as O
its members believed would be for the general public good. The natural In- O
ference is that it never makes a frivolous or unjust demand upon the O
heads of the many departments. The last matter presented for consider- o
ation by the Washington officials was addressed to the President by the o
head of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday relative to the unsanitary O
condition of Camp Merritt. The telegram to Presldont McKlnley is as fol
lows: Â« O
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., July 16, 1898. O
"The President, Washington, D. C. : Camp Merritt in San Francisco O
has been condemned by our Board of Supervisors because of its unsanitary o
condition, protested against by the neighbors; is a blot upon the admlnls- o
tration. The ladies of the Red Cross are heartbroken at the increasing O
mortality, entirely unnecessary. The New York Regiment, just arrived, O
would not accept quarters there and is now camped at the Presidio, where O
there are fifteen hundred and forty acres available instead of forty acres O
at Camp Merritt, upon which over six thousand men have been continuous- O
ly encamped for eight weeks. The sand is thoroughly saturated with sew- O
age and drainage from this large number of United States volunteers. Will o
you in the cause of humanity compel the removal of this disgraceful con- O
ditlon of affairs? If you will authorize the expenditure and give us author- o
lty this Chamber will undertake within seven days to sewer and supply o
with fresh water the Presidio grounds. HUGH CRAIG, O
"President Chamber of Commerce, San Francisco." o

DEPUTIES ARREST GUIDES
NEGLECT TO TAKE THE UNLI
CENSED INTO CUSTODY.
The Head of the Department Bespon
sible for the Neglect, as He
Declares the Ordinance
Unconstitutional.
The old clash between the venerable
head of the police department and the Li
cense Collector's office was renewed last
night by Collector Bonnet sending two of
his deputies up into Chinatown to make
arrests of guides who were violating the
license law under the eyes of the police,
who, acting under instructions from their
superior, refuse to take Into custody the
bunko steerers who palm themselves off
on the unsuspecting tourists and rob them
of their shekels.
Deputy Collectors R. P. Barton and E.
G. Faulkner made a trip to Dupont
street early In the evening and before
they had been in Chinatown long had suc
ceeded in arresting Hugo Huebner, Irving
May and Thomas Langan for violating
the license order and Louis Xathan for
peddling without a license. The collectors
will continue in the work which rightly
belongs to the police until they succeed in
ridding Chinatown of the bogus guides.
The ordinance levying a small license on
all Chinatown gulo>s was declared uncon
stitutional by the eminent jurist and clev
er thief catcher and leader of parades I.
"VV. Lees, and he has steadily refused to
make any arrests under the order. Re
quests, pleas and prayers from Collector
Bonnet addressed to Judge Lees have
been without avail. With but few excep
tions the regular police officers have
made no arrests, although the violation
of the ordinance is flagrant. Mr. Bonnet
has finally become disgusted with the ac
tions of the senile chief and being deter
mined that the city shall receive -the It
acquainted with Major Miley are de
lighted to hear of his advancement, toe
cause he is a courteous gentleman and
a worthy soldier. While he was on duty
as adjutant at the Presidio and aid at
u<"-artment headquarters in this city he
did not put on insufferable airs of ex
clusive high mightiness.
TENNESSEE MIX-UP.
A Hatchet Used on the Head
of Private Nealâ A Short
age of Sugar.
A good bit of excitement was occasioned
last evening by exaggerated accounts of
a mix-up that occurred between two men
of Company G of the First Tennessee
"Volunteers. A scarcity of sugar occa
sioned the quarrel which, fortunately,
was attended by no serious consequences.
Sugar ran short in Company G yesterday
and at supper time a number of the men
went to Quartermaster's Sergeant R. C.
Wortham and demanded it of him.
Wortham replied that the supply was
exhausted. Private James Neal insisted
that there should be sugar and a quarrel
was on in a minute. After a short ex
change of epitl.ets Sergeant Wortham
seized a hatchet and struck Neal on the
right side of the head, knocking him
down.
Wortham ran to his quarters and his
tent was surrounded by a guard armed to
repel a threatened attack by Neal's
friends.
Neal was carried to the hospital in a
semi-conscious condition. A hasty exam
ination disclosed no greater injury than
a bruised head and he was returned to
his quarters.
Sergeant Wortham was ordered to his
quarters.
Catholic Truth Society.
The following report was submitted to
the executive council of the Catholic
Truth Society at its, regular meeting and
unanimously approved:
I have examined the books kept at the Cath
olic Truth Society tent at Camp Merritt and
find that while Mrs. Susan M. Theall was in
charge of the ladles' department, that is up
to July 3, the total receipts were $647 50. Of thta
amount $371 was expended for stamps and
$115 55 for various things necessary for the
work, such as badges, rubber stamps, milk,
bread, stationery, lamp chimneys and the like.
The balance, $160, was turned over to me at the
office at various times, as the vouchers attest.
I take this opportunity of congratulatnig Mrs.
Theall on the accuracy with which her ac
counts were kept and on the prudence and
economy she showed In managing the limited
funds at her disposal and in making a little
go such a long way.
I hereby tender her my personal thanks and
the thanks of the executive council of the
Catholic Truth Society for the great zeal, the
wonderful energy and the supreme disinterest
edness with which she worked for the good of
the soldiers and the honor of the cause.
I regret exceedingly that she has resigned
from the position In which she was placed and
In which she did so much.

censes due from the guides has placed his
deputies at work which the nollce depart
ment is paid to do. If the Grand Jury in
looking into the expenses of the Collect
or's office complain that they ari too
large, Mr. Bonnet will explain how in or
der to collect the license he is compelled
to employ deputies to do the labor which
should be done by Chief Lees' underlings.
Every arrest the license collector and his
deputies have made for violation of the
license order has resulted in a conviction.
According to his Honor, Chief Lees, the
ordinance is unconstitutional. If the
opinion of this self-degreed doctor of laws
is correct every judge who has convicted
an unlicensed guide is in errorâ but the
convictions still go on

Mortgage Ordered Foreclosed.
Judge Seawell yesterday ordered that
a mortgage of $56,165 15 on the Young
Men's Christian Association building bo
foreclosed. The mortgage is held by tho
German Savings and Loan Society, and In
addition a judgment against the associa
tion for $41,000 is held by the contractors
who erected the building. The savings
society was asked to bring a frlendlv suit
to foreclose the mortgage, as there is a
clause in the articles of incorporation or
the institution- which prohibits a mort
gage being placed -on the property In tho
name of the association. It is the pur
pose of the association to procure a new
mortgage in the name of a member of the
association at a lower rate of interest
than is now being paid.

Russia has 373 vessels and 40,532 men.
REVENUE STAMPâ R. of C, Berke

not designate the color of the revenue
stamp you write about It Is impossible
to give its value. There. were several is
sues of 5-cent revenue stamps during the
Civil War period.
RELIGIOUS BELIEFâ A. S., Stockton,
Cal. The biographies that have been
published are silent as to the religion of
each of the parties named in your com
munication, consequently at this time the

near future this department can obtain
the information asked for, it will be fur

ADOPTED CHILDâ R. of C. Berke
ley, Cal. A child that Is adopted accord
ing to the laws of the State of California
occupies toward the adopting party pre
cisely the same relation that a natural
child does. In, the matter of allowing
such a child to inherit or the matter of
disinheriting Such a child, the same rules
govern as do in the case of a natural
child.
AN ANCHORâ A. O. S., City. When
an anchor is let go from the ship's side
the crown first strikes the ground; it then
falls over in such a manner that one end
of the stock rests upon the ground, and
the subsequent movements of the ship
and the cable cause one or the other of
the flukesâ matters not whichâ dig
vertically into the ground and maintain
a firm hold. On the firmness of this
grip depends the safe anchorage of the
ship. If the anchor should break its hold
in the ground and not take a fresh hold,
the. ship would go adrift.

are any number of cures that are recom
mended lor cholera. C. F. Coehran of
St. Joseph, Mo., Representative from the

In the treatment of cholera and that he
found the following a sure cure, and rec- I
ommended its use to the Missouri regi- I
ments if they went to Cuba or the Phil- I
ippines: Two parts of tincture of rhu- !
barb, two parts of spirits of camphor, one
part tincture of opium. Dose, teaspoonful. '

and Perry on The Alaska
Station.
The German four-mapted bark The
odor came very near being added to
the list of transports a few days ago.
Sin- was wanted to carry horses to
Manila, but alter she had been in-
Bpected and passed by the Government
all negotiations were stopped by the
adjournment of Congress. The cavalry
officers new ! . like to have
the bis ship, but as it is impossible to
give her an American registry .until
Congress meets again they will have to
secure some otl â  ssel.
The Theodor was formerly the Cu
nard liner China, and carried passen
gers between Liverpool ami New York.
In her time she was tho best fitted and
fastest strain'!- on the route. When
sels were re
quired by the nt of the pas-
Chlna was sold to
a Spanish firm and her name was
changed to Magallanes, and for some
time Bhe carried passengers to Manila.
The Spaniards did not keep her very
long, but returned her to the British,
and in 1889 Bhe was sold to J. D. Bis
choff of Bremen. At Antwerp her ma
ch::.*-ry and };>:-sengtjr accommodations
were taken uiit, and the steamer was
transposed Into a four-masted bark.
The last time the Theodor was here
Captain Hamer brought her from Yo
kohama in twenty-eight days. On the
homeward trip the vessel nearly went
down with all hands. While rounding
thr> Horn she ran into an iceberg and
had she not been an unusually stout
;=hip Phi would have been numbered
among the missing.
"The Theodor was to the eastward
of the Falklands at the time," said
Captain Hamer yesterday. "It was
about 3 a. m., with a clear sky, but
hazy horizon. We were on the port
tai k with all sail set and the ship was
making about five knots an hour. Sud
denly a big iceberg loomed up in front
of us, and before anything could \>e
done the Theodor struck bow on. Our
b'uvri were stove in. but the water
tight bulkhead saved us. The foremast
went by the board and the yards broke
into Bplinters. Of the mainmast noth
ing was left but the maintop and main
yard. As soon as we struck the vessel
went broadside on, and then a current
of wind filled her sails and she backed
off. We then rigged jury masts and in
time reached Montevideo, where the
ship was repaired.
"The iceberg was about three mil-?s
long ;iivl had an overhanging cliff

COLLIDED WITH AN ICEBERG.
While rounding Cape Horn the German four-masted bark Theodor ran into an iceberg and was badly
wrecked forward. . It took the crew a day to throw overboard all the ice that fell on deck, and the vessel had
barely got away from her dangerous neighbor when thousands of tons of an overhanging cliff fell away from the
berg and nearly swamped the ship. The Theodor was to have been purchased by the Government for a cattle
transport, but the deal feel through, owing to the adjournment of Congress.
which towered above our masts. We
struck under the cliff and hundreds of
tons fell on our decks. In fact, it
took the men a whole day with sledges
and crowbars to break up our unwel
come deckload and pet It overboard.
Then, as we backed away from the
berg, the whole of the overhanging cliff
fell into the ocean and nearly swamped
us. Had that mass of ice fallen on
the Theodor not a soul aboard wuuld
have lived to tell the tale."
The Theodor is under charter to load
a general cargo for London direct. She
is 2311 tons net burden, 326 feet 2 inches
long, 40 feet 4 inches broad and 27 feet
6 inches deep. She has three decks
and four water-tight compartments,
and would have made a splendid cattle
transport.
The gunboat Bennington and the
patrol steamer Grant are on their way
to Puget Sound, and Engineer Emory
Winship is on his way post haste to
Port Townsend to intercept them. Mr.
Winship came from Honolulu on the
Bennington, but on his arrival here
was transfered to the Alert. When
the Alert went out of commission he
was ordered to the Yorktown. but had
barely time to make his lunch on that
vessel before he was told to report for
duty on the Bennington again. He
came down from Mare Island in a
hurry, only to find that the gunboat
had gone. He then got his orders to
proceed to Port Townsend to rejoin the
Bennington there. It therefore looks
as though the Bennington is to relieve
the Wheeling, and that the latter will
come to San Francisco for an over
hauling. The Grant will relieve the
Perry and that vessel will probably be
overhauled at Seattle.
The Chinese who came here on the
steamer Gaelic from China were re
leased from quarantine yesterday and
were taken to the Mail dock by the
tugs Sea King and sea Queen. They
will remain upon the steamer until
passed upon by the customs authori
ties.
The Yukon River steamer Mary El
len Galvin had a very successful trial
trip yesterday. She is splendidly
fitted throughout and will be one of the
best vessels of her class on the Daw
son route. The Galvin will be towed
north by the steamer Cleveland.
The American ship Roanoke, which
sails to-day for New York, will take
away an unusually valuable cargo.
Among it there are 655,351 gallons of
wine, 795S gallons brandy and 1,200,120
pounds of borax.
The tug Annie met with a mishap
yesterday. She started up river with
two barges in tow. One had a load of
coal for Darby Leydon & Co.'s works
near Stockton, and the other was
empty. ..hen off Red Rock the sea
became very rough and the load of coal
was washed off the barge and it
swamped. After a great deal of trou
ble Captain Titchworth got the two
barges back to the Mission mud fiats,
where he left them.
Captain William Hughes, for many
years master of the ferry steamer Oak
land, died at his home, 330 Lexington
avenue, last Friday after a lingering
illnes?. Captain Hughes was 68 years
of age, and was a native of Wales.
In leoÃ he was captain of the tug Sal
Thomas, and later was master of the
ferry steamer Vallejo. He entered the
service of the Central Pacific in 1870,
and at different times was master of
the ferry-boats El Capitan, Capitol, Al
ameda, Newark and Oakland. He
leaves a large family of sons and
daughters. One of the daughters named
Stella was drowned near the Cliff
House some years ago, it is believed.
No trace of her was ever found after
she disappeared from her home.
FENDEBS ON CAES.
The Case of A. Lawrence Against
H. X Huntingtou Dismissed
by Judge Conlan.
A. Lawrence of the Examiner, who in
his craving for notoriety made a bluff in
January last of having H. E. Huntington
of the Market-street Railroad Company
charged with violating an ordinance in
not having proper fenders on cars, well
knowing that the ordinance had been re
pealed, got the conceit taken out of him
yesterday by Judge Conlan.
It was not till March 14 that the defend
ant was arrested, 'as he was out of the
city at the time Lawrence swore to tfee
complaint, and a long and tedious ex
amination followed. Finally, after .the
evidence for the prosecution was a.l In,
Attorney Kelly, for the defendant, moved
for a dismissal on the ground that the
court had no jurisdiction to proceed fur
ther against the defendant. Inasmuch as
the order upon which he was prosecuted
was inoperative and void because a sub
sequent order relating to the came subject
matter had been passed by the Board of
Supervisors, which abrogated and re
cct ce d Ju hh d ee gg f o O^n e de?S e h. 8 decision yester
day and. after going fully into the merits
of the case, considered the . point Â raised
by Mr. Kelly well taken, and dismissed

Repudiated the Contract.
Bult was filed yesterday by the Joshua
Hendy Machine Works against the Beat

alleges that it agreed to eroct a twenty

onvTn CaJaveras County for which $10.000
w-is to be paid. An installment of $3000
was paid after which time the defendant

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 17, 1898.
COURSING ON
FOGGY FIELDS
Dogs Ran Out of View
of the Spectators.
THE HARES FAST AND STRONG
FAVORITES REIGN SUPREME AT
BOTH PARKS.
Large Crowds and Lively Betting at
Union and Ingleside Grounds,
Strong Cards for To-
Day's Running.
An attractive card drew a large number
of coursing lovers to Union Park and de
spite the cold wind they remained inter
ested spectators until the lust run-down
was decided. The last five races were
partially hidden from those in the grand
stand, but the interest was so keen that
the Judge's flag- was eagerly scanned to
discover whether the favorite or short
ender was victor.
A strong lot of hares were turned loose
during the day, frequently leading
the dogs a merry chase to the slips and
oftentimes making their escape.
Two Ktitkes were run off, giving every
one present an excellent chance to wager.
The open stake was run off very quickly.
Master Mat, the puppy descendant of
Skyball and Valley Queen, made her mi
tial appearance and created an excellent
impression by his splendid showing
against the great Eastern dog, Minneap
olis. Although defeated by the latter
Master Mat proved that good * blood
courstd through him. The only notable
performance of the day was the defeat
of Terrona by Miller's Maid. The course
was long and exciting and the Maid bare
ly won out. Terrona being a BVi to 1 fa
vorite, the shortenders were made happy.
Vanity Fair ran a great race, although
opposed to an inferior dog. She will
probably make a good showing to-day.
The dogs beaten in the open stake com
peted in a consolation round, which will
Be concluded to-day.
It looks as if False Flatterer had a
strong hold on the open stake, but Min
neapolis and Vanity Fair will surely give
him a close finish.
Sylvanus, Douglas, Chile Pepper, Minne
apolis, Lady Blanche, Lissak, Qlenstone,
Royal Buck, Right Bower and Mira Mon
te should win in the second round.
Wayfarer is being played by the talent
as the winner of the consolation, but
some of the knowing ones are quietly ac
cepting Grasshopper as their choice. The
talent will tlnd it difficult to pick winners
In the Veteran stake, which will- run to
day. Master Glenkirk and Skyrocket are
fancied, but owing to the uncertain form
of the dogs very little can be said as to
who will be the winner.
Following 1b the way the dogs ran:

SWIFT HARES LEAD
DOGS A MERRY CHASE
Spirited Coursing at Ingleside
Park in the Run-Down of
Non-Winner Stake.
The sport at Ingleside Park yesterday
provided by the dogs in the run-down of
the non-winner stake was of the highest
class. The hares were unusually strong,
and gave the dogs a number of gruelling
courses. Late in the afternoon the fog
rolled In from the ocean, and at times cut
off the view of the spectators.
There were a number of upsets in the
betting. Martha Washington was a 2 to 1
favorite over Little Cripple. The first time
they left the Blips resulted in an unde
cided. On the second trial the "Cripple"
was installed favorite, and -won. A num
ber of hares proved too fast for the dogs,
reaching the escapes in safety. The sport
will commence at 10 o'clock this morning.

State convention at Sacramento. Aeolus
had his four winds well under hand, and
tl~ ! gentle zephyrs of the valley did not
play havoc with the hirsute appendages
of the great. Deprived of all excitement
from struggle with the unruly elements,
the sober and staid were forced to dis
cover some means of gentle excitation to
satisfy themselves of the fact of their
existence. Representative Hosier of San
Diego and C. D. Cleveland of this city
were standing in front of the c apitol and
lamenting the want of spirit among the
whiskered darlings of the State. Cleve
land suggested a hundred means of shak
ing off the oppressive quietness and stag
nation that seemed to pervade the very
atmosphere, but received no encourage
ment, and was just about to say some
thing not printable when some one sug
gested a footrace. There is nothing in
dicted against footraces in tne decalogue,
so the proposition was well received. The
first race was between Mosler and Cleve
land. The finish was markr-d by an elec
tric light. Both men toed the scratch,
and at the given signal were off like ice
wagons. Mosier spied an electric light
before he had gone very far, and thinking
this was the end of the course came to a
stop that was the quickest thing in the
race. Cleveland continued, for he had
overlooked this first beacon light, and
made straight for another electric light
some little distance down the road. The
spectators shouted for him to stop, but
Cleveland went on unheeding. Cries of
"Stop thief," "Stop the thief," and "Hold
him," rang out In the still night air of
Sacramento and awoke two lethargic po
licemen Just ahead of the ambitious
sprinter. He waa coming their way, and
they simply waited. Right into their
arms he rushed like an unwise mouse
eager for the cheese in the trap. Cleve
land was put under arrest and was about
to be removed to a darker place, when
his friends relented and explained the
state of affairs to the Sacramento guard

THIEVING BARTENDER.
William Hoveler Accused of Robbing
a Visitor.
William Hoveler, bartender in a saloon
at 801 Kearny street, was arrested yester
day morning by Sergeant Helms and
Policeman Cavanaugh and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of grand larceny.
The complaining witness is P. A. Cullen,
a visitor from Philadelphia, who arrived
in the city two days ago. On Friday
night he started out to see the sights on
the Barbary Coast, and visited the saloon
at 801 Kearny street. He and Hoveler had
several drinks together, and, becoming
friendly, Cullen ordered a hack, and they
drove around and had a good time at
Cullen'a expense.
Cullen had taken the precaution to tie
JI3G in greenbacks in a handkerchief and
put it in his hip pocket. While driving
round in the hack he had several times to
request Hoveler to take his hand away
from his hip pocket. Finally thoy pulled
up in front of a saloon on Kearny and
Xuerchant streets, and Hoveler gave Cul
len the slip. Cullen fell asleep in the
hack, and when the driver, who became
impatient, woke him up about an hour
after Hoveler had disappeared, Cullen
found that his wad was gone. He went
to Hoveler's saloon and asked him for the
money, but Hoveler denied knowing any
thing about it. Then Cullen notified the
police. _-. , ,
Policeman Cavanaugh got irom Hoveler s
wife a $100 greenback, which he had given
her after he left Cullen. It was booked as
evidence against him.

Been Cleaned Since Her
Arrest.
Helen Scherr was declared sane by the
Insanity Commissioners yesterday. Her
conduct since she was taken from the
filthy home of her parents at 822 Cali
fornia street has been quite rational. Yes
terday when she was examined the at
tendants in the Receiving Hospital stated
that she has been calm and quiet and
acted, as far as they had observed, like
a sane person. Sh,e was, therefore, dis
charged by the commission.
The young woman's brothers called at
the hospital yesterday morning, and when
they were Informed that their siste*
would be given her freedom they made
preparations to remove her to her home.
The clothing worn by the young woman
was destroyed on account of its filthy
condition and her brothers immediately
set out to procure new garments for her.
As soon as the brothers return she will
be removed. Slnco the arrest of Helen
and her sister. Caroline, who was sent
to Ukiah asylum for the Insane, the
Scherr household has been thoroughly
cleaned and renovated by the Board ot
Health. In future, measures will be taken
to see that it is kept in that condition.

milking cows, slopping hogs, picketing horses, making garden and so on, X'
was far from my relatives and didn't like the country. I didn't know nobody '
bo I stayed at home and worried. We had a hard time of it. No fruit, no
vegetables, no nothing. Such living was enough to ruin anybody's msidea. j
After a while my stomach got out of order, and grew worse and worse. I lost â¢ .
toy appetite. Nothing tasted good. I was troubled with sourness and gulp- [
Ings. Then I got to be cross as a bear. I was downhearted too. I felt kind;
of drowsy most of the time, and had no courage for anything. I dreamt thÂ© j
ewfulect dreams. But I didn't think I was bad sick, and doctors cost too
much and may bo don't do any good. At last, my brother in Philadelphia ;
Bent me some Kipara Tabules. Ho said they were good for my case. I usod i

TORPEDO-BOAT DESTROYER FARRAGUT
IS READY TO DEFEND "OLD GLORY"
MISS ELIZABETH ASHE, Niece of the Grand Old Naval Hero, Christens the
Latest Addition to the American Navu at a Successful Launching.
WITH the historic words of Admi
ral Farragut at New Orleans,
"Damn the torpedoes! Go
ahead!" Miss Elizabeth Ashe, a
niece of the grand old naval hero,
chris<fened the torpedo boat destroyer
Farragui at the Union Iron Works
last night.
The matter of the appropriate words
to be used was discussed on the way
; i the Union Iron Works by General
Merriam, representing the army, and
Admiral Miller, representing the navy.
They agreed that the formal, "I chris
ten thee Farragut," wad not in keep
ing with the times and intimated to
Miss Ashe that the words of the hero
of New Orleans would be most appro
priate. She entered heartily Into the
spirit of the occasion and fulfilled her
part to the letter.
The launching was, to all intents and
purposes, private. This in deference
to the i xpressed wishes of the Secre
tary of the Navy, wiic.i has desired no
display ut the launching of snips for
American navy during wartime.
The hour chosen was 9:30 p. m., at

FEDERAL JUDGE'S DECISION
EXPRESS COMPANIES MUST FUR
NISH STAMPED RECEIPTS.
.Telegraph Corporations Continue to
Collect War Tolls From Their
Customers ilegardless
of Law.
When Mar.ager Rowell of Wells, Fargo
& Co. Bald yesterday that bla company
"would continue to make his patrons fur
nish wiir tax Btampa in spite of the fact
that the law said that the company must
â¢ pay for them, he had not heard of the de
cision of United States Commissioner
â¢Hunter of Ottumwa to the effect that ex
press companies must pay. He had heard
of a similar opinion by t i i o United States
Attorney f<>r the Northern District of Cal
ifornia, but he probably considered that
a rich corporation could afford to disre
gard an opinion that might interfere with
its favorite pursuit of nickel grabbing.
Mr. Rowel 1 has mistaken his vocation.
InsUt.-ad of being manager for a bluated
corporation, he should hiuig out his shin
gle as a sea-lawyer on the fore front of a
mud scow. Said he. "The law says That a
eta nip must be affixed to each bill of lad
ing, manifest or receipt, but does not
say who is to pay for that stamp."
Mr. Rowell's law will be below par when
he reads the follow;::?-; dispatch:
OTTUMWA, la., July United States
Commissioner Hunter has decided that express
companies, not shippers, must pay the 1-cent
Revenue tax necessary on an express receipt.
â He holds the cashier of the local office of the
Adams Express Company, arrested on a charge
of violating the revenue law, to the Grand
.Jury. Assistant United* States District Attor
iney Miles represented the Government. At
torneys for the express companies will apply
for ;â - writ â¢>â  i.ai.-a- ..â¢_..- before United
â States Judce Wilson, who will be asked to
pass on the commissioner':! action early next
"Week.
ThÂ» express company, however, has
Bhowft itself po defiant of the law in this
KVgarl, so unpatriotic, so regardless of
the rights of the public that it has an
nounced through Hs agents its intention
to make its patrons, the general public,
pay tho whole of the war tax imposed
upon tho company until the Federal
courts tKke it by the throat.
The United Stages Attorney at' Los An
geles has notified the company's superin
tendent there that proceedings will be in
stituted to enforce the law.
Louis Glass, assistant general manager
of the Pacific and Sunset Telephone Com
panies, siud that Mr. Sabin, president of
the companies, had decided to obey the
law and pay the tax. It Is well under
stood, however, tiuit the Intention was to
make th-Mr patrons pay it. The company
has even sent bills to Its customers in
cluding a ' harge for stamps on messages.
This is obtaining money under false pre
tenses, and tho money so added to the
swindling fund derived from the nickel in
the slot telephones should be refunded to
the victims of both frauds.
The fact is, and Mr. Glass and Mr. Sabin
know it, that the law does not require any
stamps in the telephone business at all.
It reads that every person, tlrm or cor
poration, engaged In the telephone busi
ness shall make, within the last fifteen
days of each month, a sworn statement
to the Int< ' enue Collector of the
district stating the number of messages
transmitted over their respective linos
during the preceding month for which a
charge of lo cents or more was imposed,
and for each of such messages the said
person, firm, or corporation shall pay a
tax of 1 cent.
Thus it will be seen that no stamps ara
required and that tlje Jaw expressly de-
which time the tide attained its high
est point. This condition was neces
sary owing to the peculiar build of
the Farragut, she requiring more
water than a battle-ship.
The Millen Griffith conveyed Invited
guests to the scene of the launching.
The majority of those in attendance
were representatives of the army and
naval attaches. Major General Mer
riam, Brigadier General Charles King,
Major J. L. Rathbone and others rep
resented the land forces, while Admi
ral Miller and Naval Constructor El
liott Snow were present to act for the
men who go down to the sea in ships
In the name of Uncle Sam.
The Japanese navy was represented
by Captain K. Sakural of the Chitose,
Captain S. Sakural, naval construc
tor; Lieutenant Commander I'shida,
and Inspectors of Machinery Hirabe
and Wadaki.
Immediately upon the arrival of the
guests at the wotks they disembarked
and proceeded to the ways upon whu-h
rested the new fighting machine of the
United States Government. The boat
Clares that the companies must pay the
tax. As there Is no way of putting a
stamp on a telephone message. Congress
decreed that the companies should con
tribute to the expenses of the war ac
cording to the quantity of business done,
as shown by the monthly statements.
"It was our intention," said Mr.
Glass, "to charge the stamp to the pub
lic on all low-priced messages and bear
it on all above 50 cents." - :--':-'' ?- v -~- : Â»?
It is well known that at least ninety
five out of every 100 messages are for
amounts less than 50 .cents, hence the
generosity of Mr. Glass and his company
is on a par with the self denial of the
fox who didn't like sour grapes.
The telegraph companies are equally aÂ»
unpatriotic as the others and are mak
ing the public suffer.- .Superintendent
Jaynes said:
"We are not trying to evade the law.
That is not our intention. ' The law states
distinctly that the maker of the enumer
ated documents must fix' the stamps or
stand the penalty of a $100 fine. Moreover,
if we accept a message without such
stamp we are liable to a fine of $10.
"Of course, in the matter of express
companies, the latter are the makers of
the receipt, and.. therefore, must pay for
the stamp; but with us it is different. The
person writing and signing a message is
the maker thereof, and such telegram is a
document in the interpretation of the law.
"In order that there may be no doubt as
to our position and responsibility, I sub
mitted the matter to the only proper au
thority, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, receiving the following reply:
Upon the question as to whose duty It is to
affix a stamp required by the act of June 13.
IMS, to each telegraphic message offered for
transmission, you are advised that this office
rules that the duty devolves upon the person
who makes, signs or Issues the message. Sec
tion 7 of the act provides that if any person
or persons shall make, sign or Issue any in
strument, document or paper of any descrip
tion whatsoever, without the same being duly
stamped for denoting: the tax thereon, the said
person or persons shall be deemed- guilty of
a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall
pay a fine of not more than $100. Telegraphic
dispatches and messages are enumerated In the
act as requiring the documentary- 1-cent stamp.
Section IS of the act Imposes upon the tele
graph company a penalty of $10 for transmit
ting any dispatch or message that has not
been stamped in accordance with section 7.
"Thus, you see, there Is no doubt in our
case At any rate, we pay stamps on
almost everything we do, and truly bear
our proportion of the tax in that manner."
Superintendent Jaynes does not take
the legal view of the matter. It was not
and could not have been the intention to
have exempted the telegraph companies
from paying their just pro rata of the
tax. They are making enormous profits
out of the" war. and it cannot be believed
that Congress Intended that they should
be exempted from paying their share of
an obligation to which every poor work
lnKmun in the United States Is contribut
ing cheerfully and with a loyal heart.
SPORTSMEN AFIELD
IN QUEST OF GAME
The Opeo Scgsoo Sends Shooters
to the haunts of Deer
and Doves.
The shooting season will be in full
swing this afternoon, when deer and
dove 3 will replace the inanimate targets,
at which the shotgun brigade have been
peppering these many months.
The gunstores were thronged with
sportsmen yesterday, purchasing ammu
nition in anticipation of a pilgrimage to
the haunts of game to-day. The majority
will shoot over the territory within easy
access of this city. Some will press on to
the hunting grounds to the north in Men
docino County, and to the east in Sierra
Nevada mountains. From the glowing ac
counts received here this State can well
lay claim to the title "Sportsmen's Para
dise." The fishing and shooting are all
that the most ardent could desire.
The officials of the Tuba and Sutter
Gun Club, of Marysville. are actively en
gaged preparing for their annual dove
stew held in conjunction with their pigeon
I shoot. Otto Feudner won both the live
' bird and blue rock medals last year,
emblematic of the championship of North
ern California.
The Napa Gun Club live-bird tourna
ment will be held on the 24th and 25th
inst. Four events are scheduled for each
day. A large attendance of shooters is
expected.
The events in this district to-day In
clude a live-bird shoot of the California
| Wing: Club at Ingleside, and the Lincoln
! Gun Club meeting at Alameda Ponit. Thu
I latter will be a blue rock tournament.

glance the appliances for the launch

With the arrival of the -vests work
men commenced knocking the braces
away from the boat. When all was in
readiness General Merriam gave the
word and the last support was re
moved. Slowly the yacht-like hull
commenced to move and Miss Eliza
beth Ashe spoke the words naming
the new marine wonder. Ihe boat
gained momentum rapidly, and amid
the shouts of spectators and the shrill
whistles of the works she glided rap
idly from the view of those in attend
ance and was swallowed up In the
blackness of night. â¢
President Henry T. Sco*t congratu
lated Miss Ashe on the manner in
which she had performed her duties,
adding: "Unis is a California boat,
christened by a California girl with

pride, the Oregon." The guests then
returned to the Millen Griffith.
OPINION ON MINING
STOCK WAR TAXES
COMMISSIONER SCOTT EX
PLAINS THE LAW.
Manner in Which the Certificates
Are Subjected to the Operation
of the War Revenue Act.
Commissioner Scott of the Internal
Revenue Department at Washington has
rendered the following opinion as to the
I tax on mining stock:
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
Office of Commissioner, of Internal Revenue,
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 29. 1593.
! Sir: On the question of the construction of
that part of schedule A of the act. of June 35.
IS9S, imposing stamp tax "on each orlg-;i.U
i issue, whether on organization or reorganiza
! tion, of certificates of mock," it is held that
â â  the meaning of the words "original issue," as
herein used, is limited and controlled by the
i words "whether on organization or reorganiza
; tion," and that, therefore, the only certificated
of stock on which the tax of 5 cents "on each
$100 of face value or fraction thereof" Is im
posed by this act are those certificates issued
on or after July 1, 1898, on the organization or
! reorganization of a company. . â 
In the case of a corporation having, for in
stance, an authorized capital stock of 000, 000,
I of which It has Issued only $500,000 prior to July
I 1. IS9B, and on and after that date finds It
i necessary to make one or more additional is
sues, under the authority possessed by It, each
; additional issue thus made is an "original
: issue" within the terms and meaning of the
; statute here under consideration, and the cer-
I tificates of such issue are subject to the stamp
' tax.
Where any original certificate issued is pre
| sented by the holder to the company or cor
poration for the Issuance of another certificate
or certificate in lieu thereof, the certificate or
certificates thereupon issued to take the place
: of the original certificate could not, under the
I language and limitation of the statute above
j cited, require any stamp as long as there is no
I sale, nor agreement to sell, nor memorandum
I of sale, nor transfer of any of these certifi
cates issued In lieu of the original.
In case of sale where the evidence of trans
fer Is shown only by the books of the com
! pany, a tax of 2 cents , is required to be paid
l on each hundred dollars of face value, or frac-
I tion thereof; and the stamp representing this
, is required to be placed upon such books.
Where the change of ownership is by trans
j fer certificate â is to say, the executed au
i thority to transfer is contained on the back of
I the stock certificate which is to be transferredâ
! the stamp must be placed on the transfer cer
i tificate â that is to say, upon the surrendered
I certificate containing the transfer.
j In cases of agreements' to sell, or where the
I transfer Is by delivery .of ! the certificate as
signed in blank, there must be executed a
memorandum thereof, to which the stamp la
required to be affixed.
Under the ruling herein stated, In a case
(that may be supposed) of a man who Is the
owner of a certificate for 100 shares of stock,
and wishes to sell ten of these to another per
son, the result being that one certificate would
be Issued for the 10 shares sold, and also an ad
ditional certificate for the 90 shares â  still re
maining In him. the certificate for 90 shares.
Issued (with the certificate for 10 shares sold)
In lieu therof, does not. require any stamp; and
the certificate for the 10 shares , does > not ; re
quire a stamp representing the tax of 5 cents
on each hundred dollars of face value or frac
tion thereof, as it is not an original Issue. The
only stamp required with reference to these
certificates Is a stamp on the transfer of the
10 shares sold representing "nvment of the tax
of 2 cents on each hundred dollars of face value
or fraction thereof. ;
In another case (stated for illustration) where
a m.in holds several certificates for shares of
stock aggregating 100 shares, and. for his con
venience, calls upon the. company to issue to
him in lieu thereof one certificate for : 100
shares, there being no sale, nor agreement to

INTEREST LfIGS
AMONG TENNIS MEN
Tl}e Whitncys' Withdrawal From
1 Competition Deprives the Game
of Strorjg Support.
The outlook on this coast for tennis as
a sport Is not bright. George Whitney
has withdrawn from the field of competi
tion and now his brother, Robert X. V> hit -
ney, threatens to do the same. The with
drawal of the Whitneys from tournaments
will leave the California. Ohio without a
first-class player and will materially
weaken the list of first-class players of
the coast. Tennis has never been at such
a low ebb so far as championship material
goes. There are a number of second and
third class players Interested 'n th<* gan<e,
but they are practically beginners and do
not figure in a consideration of the yams
as a brand: of athletics.
Throe months ago a lethargic spirit
among the lady players gave way to a
genuine interest In the game and a sur
prising activity in tournaments. The
school vacation has been instrumental
however, in postponing all contemplated
match tournaments among the fair enthu
siasts.
The championship singles tournament at
ban Rafael exhausted the Interest in the
game for a time. The courts of th>Â» va
rious clubs are deserted, which state is
chiefly due to the exodus of players to
the country and the reaction that occurs
after a tournament.
The championship doubles tournament
in the early part of September is provok
ng some discussion as to the place where
it will be held. Some want it at Monterev
others at San Rafael and there are a num
ber of players who would like to Â«cc the
tournament played on either the Oakland
or the California Club courts

THEY ARE
STILL MAN
AND WIFE
Troubles of the Ruh
lings in Court.
BOTH ARE DENIED A DIVORCE
AN INTERESTING EPISODE IS
EECALLED.
How J". W. Hinkel Lost His Position
Through a Little Escapade*
With the Plain-
The marital woes of Frederick W. E.
Ruhling, necessarily involving those of
his wife. Mary E. Ruhling, were aired
yesterday in Judge Belcher's court.
Contrary to the most ardent expecta
tions of the unhappy couple, however,
the court refused to grant the litigants
a decree of divorce, and they left the
courtroom disappointed in themselves,
each other and in the ways of the
law.
Mrs. Ruhling's tale of trouble was
first considered. In her complaint for
divorce she alleged that ever since her
marriage her husband has treated her
in a cruel manner, accused her of un
chastlty and referred to her as a
"schemer and a robber."
Mrs. Ruhling was first put on the
stand. She testified as to the allega
tions In the complaint and was cor
roborated by her daughter, Miss Duffy,
and her brother, Herbert Judge. The
case of the plaintiff then rested and
the answer of the defendant and his
cross complaint were taken up by the
court. He in turn accused his wife
of unbecoming conduct and then re
ferred to an interesting little epiaode
in the life of his wife since their mar
riage, which occurred in February of
the present year. Through the episode
referred to J. W. Hinkel, collector for
a well-known real estate firm, lost his
position, and he and Mrs. Ruhling
spent a few unhappy hours behind
prison bars.
Hinkel became smitten with the
charms of Mrs. Ruhling, who was re
ferred to in articles published at that
time as a "dashing grass widow." She
was not a grass widow, however, hav
ing been married to Ruhling some
three months. In an evil moment
Hinkel, who is the son of a prominent
contractor, met Mrs. Ruhling, and on
May 18 invited her to the Cliff House.
They had several bottles of wine and
were in a spirit of abandon when they
started to drive back to the city.
While passing through the park their
horse became unmanageable and ran
away. Park Officer Arellaes gave
chase, and with the aid of a lariat suc

the policeman to arrest her gay com
panion.
"You shall not take him away," she
declared. "Touch him at your peril."
Arellaes blew his whistle, which was
answered by two of his fellow officers,
and, after a short struggle, the police
man succeeded in arresting the couple.
They were driven to the O'Farrell
street station, where they were charged
with being drunk.
Hinkel had $175 80 on him, and he of
fered to put up the amount to secure
his release. The desk sergeant, how
ever, refused to discharge him until
he had become sober.
After being placed In a cell Hinkel
sent for his employer, and, explaining
his predicament, begged his assistance.
His employer offered to furnish the
necessary amount of bail for Hinkel,
but positively refused to assist Mrs.
Ruhllng in gaining her freedom. But
Hinkel would not accept his offer, de
claring that he would rather die than
desert his fair companion. Several
hours latÂ£r the couple were released on
$10 bail, which was taken from the
amount found in the collector's pockets.
Through the efforts of several friends
Hinkel, on the following day, had the
cases against him and Mrs. Ruhling
dismissed. After learning the facts of
the disagreeable episode, Hinkel's em
ployer sent him a note, informing him
that his services were no longer re
quired.
Judge Belcher, on consideration of
all the facts introduced, refused to
grant either party a decree of divorce
and they were sent away unhappy.
Judge Groezinger, -who represented
Ruhling, stated that shortly his client
would file an original complaint for di
vorce, as he wished to have nothing
more to do with his wife.
Ruhling is 66 years of age, and his
wife is still on the sunny side of 36.
The incompatibility of age is respon
sible for all the trouble. Ruhling is
not gay enough for his wife, and in
consequence she burdens his life with
cares and troubles.
IDENTITY OF A MAN
MURDERED AT PIMA
Proves to Be N. F. Allen, the Son of
a Banker, and Recently of
Riverside.
RIVERSIDE, July 16.â Through the co
operation of the officers of Plma, Ariz.,
and this city the identity of the man who
was robbed and killed in that town a
few days ago has been established. The
murdered man was N. F. Allen, and ho
formerly resided in this city. He was
engaged in business up to about four
months ago, when he went to Arizona to
work for tho Boston Steel Range Com
pany. Allen was formerly wealthy. His
father is a banker at Rockville, irid.
Nothing is known here regarding the
j killing of Allen beyond the fact, which
was conveyed to J. P. Little of this place
in a letter from the officials at Pima. Lit
tle had been in correspondence with Allen
and the officials at Pima found his letters
in Allen's rockets. He waÂ« aboiu 45 yeals
of age. The intelligence receded here
conveyed no particulars of the manner of
his death beyond that he was killed and
robbed.
Gray horses are the longest-lived and
cream-colored ones are the most dplicate,
being unable to stand very warm weather.CADETS IN CAMP

oration, band concert and singing, and
there was served a ration of stewed apri-

The fruit Is very gu<>dâ peaches 15 cents

than you can gret them at retail In San

Secretary Bliss Taking Vigorous
Measures to Protect the Na

WASHINGTON, July 16.-The Secretary
of the Interior has received information
that special forest agents have ejected
more than $5,000 sheep from the Yosemite
Park. California, and will in a short time
! probably succeed In removing the' others
! now on that reserve. Secretary Bliss has
heretofore requested the detail of troops
to the several national parks in Califor
nia, but the soldiers so assigned were re
i moved in order to accompany the Phillp
1 pine expedition. Many complaints were
received concerning the invasion of sheep
, men, und a special inspector was sent to
take charge of the parks, and were sub
sequently designated acting superintend
ents, with directions to employ from ten
to twenty-four men as assistant forest
, agents. These men have succeeded In
j ejecting the sheep. The Secretary of War
! has also detailed an officer and ten men
! of tho Utah Volunteer Cavalry to patrol
! Yosemite, Sequoia and General Grant
! national parks. These men have been
! told to report to the acting superlntond-
I ent for instructions, and it is hoped that
i by their assistance the destruction of the
forests by fire may be prevented. The In
terior Department has used every effort

COLONEL AIKEN DEAD.
Was Awarded a Medal by Congress
for Bravery in the Sixties.
VISALIA, July 16.â A prominent mem
ber of the Grand Army of the Republic
has Just passed away in this city in the
death of Colonel John J. Aiken. a native
of Vermont. He was 64 years of age and
lived for years in San Francisco and
Stockton.
Colonel Aiken participated in some of
the most important battles of the Civil
War, notably that of Gettysburg. Be
cause of his complete knowledge of this
great battle he was employed as lecturer
for the cyclorama of the Battle of Get
tysburg while it was at San Francisco.
The colonel was one of eleven surviv
ors in a desperate struggle against the
Confederates in the Civil War and on ac
count of the signal bravery of the eleven
each was presented with a medal by spe
cial vote of Congress. He was a man of
more than ordinary refinement and had
written several poems and popular songs.
Colonel Aiken had made his home here
for the past two years. He left no rela
tives on this coast. His funeral was con
ducted to-day according to the ritual of
the Grand Army.
AT THE HARE
ISLAND YARD
Philadelphia Is Taking
on Supplies.
ALMOST READY TO SAIL
WILL START FOR HONOLULU ON
WEDNESDAY.
Tug Iroquois Has Taken on Coal and
Is Prepared to Start on a
Cruise on a Day's
Notice.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, July 16.â The Philadelphia
has been taking on ammunition for a
couple of days and other stores are
being rushed aboard as rapidly as pos
sible. A small amount of coal for aux
iliary purposes has been placed on
board and the work of filling her bunk
ers will begin on Monday. There is a
rumor that just sufficient coal will be
put on board here to take her to San
Francisco, where the coaling will be
completed. There is a probability that
she will be ready to sail with Admiral
Miller on the 20th inst., but it may
take a day or two longer to get ready.
The tugs Active, Vigilant and Iro
quois are still lying at the quay wall,
though the officers and crews from the
naval reserve are anxious to receive
sailing orders. Captain Turner has had
the Iroquois alongside the coal wharf
and she has 200 tons of coal in her
bunkers. Her water tanks are full and
she is ready for a cruise on a day's no
tice. She is splendidly adapted for dis
patch boat service between San Fran
cisco and Honolulu as she can steam
sixteen knots and has a working radius
!of 5000 miles. She carries seven guns
i and would be a good auxiliary vessel
I for use with AdmiraJ Dewey's fleet,
i having powerful pumps and wrecking
| appurtenances.
The board to select a site for a new
dork has completed its work and the re
port is now in process of preparation.
| The plans for the dock will accompany
the recommendations of the board,
which will not be known until they
reach the Secretary of the Navy. It is
known that borings have been made
south of the -Tf sent stone dock and the
new dock probably will be located very
near the place recommended by Naval
Constructor Baxter in his report to the
chief constructor a year ago.
With the sailing of the Philadelphia
the rush on Mare Island will have end
ed, as there is only the Yorktown to
prepare for immediate service, and that
can be done without night work. A
number of men have been let oft, as
there has been no demand for men in
! their callings since the Philadelphia
j was practically completed. The force
I will still be kept at a high figure, es-
I peeially in the construction department,
which has large appropriations and
much work on the Yorktown. Ranger
and Adams, as well as the Alert and
Hnrtford. It is now understood that
those vesrsels'wlM bo completed without
any delay, probably by the end of the
By that time, it is expected, the war
with Spain will have ended and a num
ber of Admiral Dewey's ships will come
here for repairs. The flagship Olympia
had received orders to come to Mare
Island, but the breaking out of the war
caused the orders to be countermanded.
The Baltimore has accommodations for
the flag office and will probably become
the flagship of the Asiatic squadron and
the Olympia will return to Mare Island
as soon as peace is established and the
disposition of the Philippines settled.
Work on the Yorktown is going
ahead rapidly and the results are be
ginning to show. When tbf battery Is
placed on board the Yorktown will be
the best vessel of her class, as the
6-inch guns which will form her main
battery have been converted Into
rapid-fire guns. They were originally
a portion of the Philadelphia's battery,
but the hurry order for that vessel
would not admit of waiting, so the
Yorktown's guns were used and the lat
ter vessel will get improved guns.
LINTON BEATS MICHAEL
AND BREAKS RECORDS
NEW YORK. July 16.â For the second
time this year Jimmy Michael, theoncein
vlncible paced bicyclist, wasforced todrlnk
the bitter cup of defeat. His old school
mate in Wales, Tom Linton, was the one
to lower Michael's record, and at the
same time he broke the world's record for
the distance. Linton accomplished the
feat in a twenty-mile pneed race at Man
hattan Beach, in the presence of 15,000
people. For four miles It was a pretty
race, Michael leading by a few yards.
Suddenly Michael's tire collapsed. Nat
urally, Linton passed him, and, after rid
ing two laps of the fifth mile, 'Michael
stopped and pedaled slowly to his "cor
ner," where he changed his damaged
wheel for a new one. In the meantime
Linton kept going liko the wind and be
fore Michael came back on the track he
was one mile ahead.
When Michael left the track he was
greeted with a storm of hisses. It cer
tainly appeared like a case of quit, aa
Michael could have changed his wheel
and resumed his place behind his pace
makers with scarcely the lobs of half a
lap had he tried to do bo.
Michael met with another slight draw
back on entering his tenth mile, when
his pacing team broke a chain. After
Michael let up there was little Interest in
the race outside of Llnton's efforts to
reduce the record. Although he tried hara
he could add no new figures until the flr
teenth mile, when he started In by clip
ping 5 Irs seconds off the record.
He continued ahead of the record every
mile until the finish, breaking the twenty
mile record by exactly seven seconds. Ho
could have made better time had he not
lost his pacemakers while rounding for
the last lap.
Not content with the result, Michael at
once challenged Linfon for another race
at twenty-five miles. Linton accepted
and the race will be run at Manhattan
Beach track on Saturday next.
Taylore of France established a new
kilometer record during the afternoon.

DR. PIERCES REMEDIES | DR. PIERCES REMEDIES
GIVE FULL HONOR WHERE DUE
"Remember the Merrimac I"
INTO THE THICK OF THE
FIRE.
"Into a narrow channel
"Beneath the Spanish guns,
"Went the heroes of the Merrimac,
"America's own brave sons."
Admiral Gherardi recently voiced
public opinion when he said: "There is
Just as much grit, just as much brains
A
and just as much ability to-day in the
American navy as ever, and I would
not hesitate to say that there are bet-
ter men to-day in the navy than ever."
Lieutenant Hobson has proved himself
the greatest hero of modern times;
none the less so were the six brave fel-
lows who volunteered and went with
him, as well as the seventh man â the
coxswain who disobeyed orders and
slipped on board to help in the desper-
ate undertaking! Almost every officer
and man in the entire fleet begged to
be allowed a place on the Merrimac â
a forlorn hopo for their country's glory
â for none who went expected to get
out alive through the hell that would
surely pour from the cannon mouths
of Morro and Zocapa. It was a scene
of heroism and heroes which will do
more to convince the world that Ameri-
cans are not "a nation of shopkeepers,"
but that they are built of the material
from which heroes are made.
It takes a man with good blood,
strong nerves and a healthy condition
of heart, brains and stomach to be a
hero. A nervous man who does not
sleep at night and gets up shaky in the
morning is not the sort to take
up the battle of life with confidence
and fortitude. If the nerves are fed on
good rich blood, and the liver active, so
that all waste products are eliminated
â such a man has a clear head and a
firm will, for his nerves are strong, his
heart active and his brain is fed on
pure blood. So it happens that Dr.
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery 1b
one of the best of all health-keepers,
for it makes pure, rich blood.
It forces out all Impurities and dis-
ease germs. It does not make any dif-
ference what the disease may be called,
so long as it has its inception in im-
proper or insufficient nourishment â this
great medicine will cure it. It may be
called dyspepsia, kidney disease, "liver
complaint," skin or blood disease, or
nervous prostration â all these have the
same starting point. The "Golden Med-
ical Discovery" reaches that point. It
will cure these diseases absolutely.
None of them can retain their hold c-n
the system when the arteries are filled
with rich, pure blood. It replaces worn-
out tissue with hard, muscular flesh,
and changes weakness and debility iato
active power and nerve force.
No alcohol being used in the manu-
facture of "Golden Medical Discovery"
it does not inebriate or create an ap-
petite or longing for stimulants, as is
so often the case with the protracted
use of other advertised tonics and al-
teratives, which are very generally
made up largely of that injurious in-
gredient.
The originator of this great "Discov-
ery." R. V. Pierce, M. D., is chief con-
sulting physician to the great Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute of Buffalo,
N. V., at the Read of a staff of nearly a
score of eminent associate physicians
and surgeons. He has acquired, in his
over thirty years of active practice, a
reputation second to no living physician
in the treatment of obstinate, chronic
diseases. His prescriptions must not be
confounded with the numerous "boom"
remedies, "extracts," "compounds,"
and "sarsaparillas." which a profit-
seeking druggist is often ready
to urge as a substitute. Dr. Pierces
medicines are the product of wide ex-
perience and deep study. Any one may
consult him by letter free of charge.
"The reason I delayed writing was
because I wanted to wait one year
after I had taken the medicine before
giving my statement, and now I can
send a good, conscientious testimonial,"
writes Charles H. Sargent of Plain City,
Madison County, Ohio. "During the
summer and fall of 1896 I became all
'run-down.' nerves were out of order
and stomach out of order. I wrote to
Dr. Pierce for advice. He said I had
general debility, and advised Dr.
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery, and,
thanks to you for your advice, I used
six bottles; and since I stopped taking
It about one year ago, T have not taken
any medicine of any kind, and have
been able to work every day. My appe-
tite is good. I can oat three square
meals a day. and I do not feel that
miserable burning in the stomach after
eating. My blood and nerves are in
good shape, and well â in fact, I think I
am in pretty good running order."
"My health had been failing for sev-
eral years," writes Mrs. Sophia A.
Slemp of Sugargrovo, Smith County,
Va. "I had hot flashes and at times a
dreadful hurting in my ba^k abovo the
loins; could not rest r.t nierht on ac-
count of hot spells. Last spring I be-
gan to feel so weak I could scarcely do
my work and in April I broke down
completely. I had Indigestion and kid-
ney trouble. No desire to urinate, and
when I did would pass only a very lit-
tle and of dark color. The back of my
head and neck would be so tired I
could not rest. The left side of my face
ached, but the pains and aches yielded
under the influence of Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery and 'Pleas-
ant Pellets.' I had also severe pains in
my left limb. I tried different lini-
ments but received no relief. I could
not be still on account of the suffering
in my body. My limbs and feet were
cold, although I was in a perspiration
nearly all the time. Some nights I
would have to be propped up in bed
all night, and even then could sleep but
little. I sent for the doctor and asked
if he could cure me. He said he had
never failed but a time or two. I took
his treatment about three weeks and
was no better, but worse if anything,
so I decided to try Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery. I bought six bot-
ties but I had only to take four bottles
of the 'Golden Medical Discovery' and
two vials of the 'Pleasant Pellets' and I
was able to do my work again. I have
thus far had no return of the disease.
I feel better this spring than I have felt
for several seasons. I have no hot spells
like I had for several years. If I had
taken your treatment sooner, no doubt
I could have kept that bad spell off, but
I am truly thankful that I took your
medicine and found a cure. I shall
ever praise the medicine that cured me
and will recommend it to all suffering
as I was."
While all diseases may not be directly
inherited, the constitutional tendency
to acquire them is inherited. If a man
is a consumptive the chances are that
his children will have weak, under-
sized lungs and a predisposition to ac-
quire the same disease.
The young man who suffers from
bronchitis, weak lungs, spitting of
blood or any disease of the air passages
which, if neglected, leads up to con-
sumption, may take Dr. Pierces Gold-
en Medical Discovery with almost ab-
solute assurance of recovery. It curea
98 per cent of all cases when taken in
time. It soothes and heals the deli-
cate and sensitive tissues of the air-
passages and lungs, checks the cough,
facilitates expectoration, drives out all
impurities and disease germs from the
tainted' blood and builds new and
healthy tissues.
Mr. John G. Born of 4020 Liberty
aye., Pittsburg, Pa., writes: "Some
thirty months ago I said to my wife, 'I
don'fr want to keep anything from you,
I must tell you I am in the last stage of
consumption.' In December, 1896, I
commenced taking Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery. I could then only
speak in whispers. I have taken thir-
teen bottles, and can say with truth
I am greatly benefited. People are sur-
prised to hear me speak. I can halloo,
and my voice has not been as good in
eight years. My stomach was never
in better condition. Formerly I could
not eat without suffering very much
immediately after, but now I can eat
anything."
"I will write you what Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery has done for
me," says George H. Belcher Esq. of
Dorton, Pike County, Ky. "Thirteen
years ago I was wounded by a ball
passing through my lung. I have had a
bad cough almost ever since with
shortness of breath, and it was very
easy to take cold; the slightest change
of weather would cause the cough to
be so bad I would have to sit up in bed
all night. Could not eat or sleep at
times: was all run-down; could not
work at all. A few months ago I be-
gan using Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery- Have not used more than
two bottles and now can eat, sleep
and work, and I feel like a new man.
I cannot find words to sufficiently rec-
ommend Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery, or tell the good it has done
me."
"Last spring I was taken with severe
I pains in my chest, and was so weak I
| could hardly walk about the house,"
i says Mrs. G. E. Kerr of Fort Dodge,
' Webster County, lowa. "I tried several
physicians and they told me I had con-
sumption, but that I might 'brush It
over' and perhaps live a good many
years. I heard of Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery and I thought I
would try same of it. Before I had
! taken the first bottle I was very much
i better; I took five bottles of it and
| have not yet had any return of the
trouble. I have also taken Dr. Pierc^'B
Favorite Prescription and 'Pleasant
I Pellets' with good results."
"I had long been a sufferer from
! chronic catarrh of the head," says
i Charles T. Stone Esq. of "Whitford,
' Chester County, Pa. "About last May
I it developed into a very disagreeable
! and hacking cough with soreness and
i fullness of the chest. Doctors here
: pronounced it bronchitis. I tried sev-
eral doctors and took different remedies
! without receiving any benefit whatever.
i I then consulted Dr. R. V. Pierce In
reference to my case. The first bottle
of his 'Golden Medical Discovery*
| stopped the cough. I used several bot-
I ties, with Dr. Sago's Catarrh Remedy,
i and have since had no symptoms of a
| return of the cough."

two Sabbath services, at 2 and 6, by Rev.
Francis Warnon, at Mills Tabernacle,
Twelfth and Webster, Oakland. This work
of God has continued daily for three weeks,
with over-increasing displays of divine grace
and power In saving and sanctifying, as well
as healing the sick. Many totally deaf and
blind Instantly began to hear and see; tumors
and goitres disappeared: the lame ran and
leaped: eczema, neuralgia, rheumatism, etc.,
yielded: even the sick miles away restored
at the time special prayer was being made
by Mr. W. at tabernacle. This gospel work
being now on a "permanent" basis, branches
will be opened all over the Coast, to the
glory of "Jesus only." The Revs. Mess, Vir-
tue. Holm. Coplln (officer of the "Christian
Alliance"), Garvin and other ministers have
assisted at the meetings and declared the
man and his work to be surely of God. Base
and baseless calumnies (bo proven) need no
reply from Brother Warnon or his friends;
the work speaks for Itself, and the man Is
loved and honored by us who "know" him.
To-day at 2 and 6, healing, etc., and testi-
monies of marvelous healings are promised by
Oakland and "Los Angeles" friends; testi-
monies of broken bones set. cancers and
tumors removed, and of a "dying" person In-

COLLEGE OF COMMERCE.
Valuable Information Now Being
Collected by F. W. Dohrmann.
F. Dohrmann, president of the Mer
chants' Association, has been absent in
Europe for several months, but he is ex
pected home some time In September. His
hon was one of the first to respond to the
cull of his country and Is now in Manila,
having gone on the first expedition from i
hero.
During his absence. Mr. Dohrmann the
elder has been paying much attention to
a matter of no Ftnall importance here. He
:;<_â  of. the most enthusiastic of those
who worked to have the college of com
merce !Â»ature added to the branches in
the State University. He and Regent Ar
thur Rodgers having devoted much tiny
to the mutter, Mr. Rodgers here and Mr.
Dohrmann In Europe. At the last session
of the State Legislature the act to create
anil maintain such a course in the univer
sity where students could learn to be
come merchants was passed.
According to the statement of one of
the supporters of the measure, when a
young man linishes his education now and
determines to become a merchant he has
only enough education to tit him for be
ing an uralnury peddler, rlis knowledge
of commerce should lie such that he couid
fill the- position of consul in any country
in the world. Tho assertion was made
that but few of the gentlemen who now
till surh offices have any knowledge of
what constitutes their duties. Foreign
Is should be business mÂ»-n and mer
chants in every sense of the word. Soon
aftc-r the bill mentioned was passed Mr.
Dohrmann and Mr. Kodgers came to the
conclusion that there an- not very many
teachers in this country competent to give
the required Instruction, and so whyi the
former went to Europe h>- was asked to
look Into tho several methods of teaching
In the blÂ« colleges of this kind on the Con
tinent. Several letters from him show
that he has visited Institutions in Leipsic
and Venice and his report will be of very
Interest From Italy he has sent a
comprehensive work in the Italian lan
guage, which the regents are having
translated. It is believed that the infor
mation Mr. Dohrmann will be able to fur
nish will be of material assistance to the
Instructors at Berkeley when the college
is opened.
Alameda Cricketers in the Lead.
The cricket match begun last Sunday
between the Alameda and Pacific clubs
will b>- continued to-day. Thr Pacifies
made only 70 runs in their first Inning,
while Alameda made 301 runs for the loss
of four wickets.
The Alameda team consists of R B
Hogue (captain i, Q. J. Baugh. J. J. Morl
arty, F. Croll, I. H. Spiro, J. H. Saunders
B. Bird, J. J. R. peel, V. Seebeck, C.
Banner and G. Croll. Of these. I. H.
Bpiro and J. H. Saunders were not out
and the five la.-v named did not bat last
Sunday. The Pacifies played two m.-n
short, their full team being as follows:
A. Dlcken.son, J. Mr-Lean. Pane Sewell
George Theobald. E. F. Masson, T. "W. G.
Wallace, w. Mot rae, 11. P. Gordon C*
B. Hill, J. H. Harbour and C. Townsley.
If tho Alamedas win this match, the third
for the cup, they will have won two and
drawn one. Consequently, another drawn
match would suffice to put them in tho
lead and make them the winners of the
cup for 1898.
The Seventh Will Drill.
A drill will be given at Mechanic.-;' Pa

Thursday evening, July 21. The affair

same offense.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
Life at Low Waterâ A
Great Discovery of
Fuller's Earth.
The Problem of the Rich Base
Ores of Northern Counties.
A Sample of Progress
From El Dorado.
During: a season when hundreds of
stumps are hung up and scores of giants
are idle because of the unprecedented
lack of water, It is gratifying to find so
much busy mining development going on
all over the State. The lack of water will
lessen this year's gold production by mil
lions. Not only are operating mines shut
down or working on part time, but at
many new mines where development work
was going on development operations have
been suspended. So serious Is the lack
of water In many mining communities in
the mountains that water companies here
and there are publishing In the local pa
pers appeals, sometimes pathetic and
sometimes peremptory, to "stop this
waste of water," to squirt none on the
dust on the road and to carefully and
economically water the garden truck with
buckets.
But this Is all temporary. Every stamp
that Is hung up will go to' dropping live
lier than before when water comes, and
all these development operations will pro
ceed again with more vigor for the prep
arations made during the rest. This lack
of water Is not universal, however, and
the buying, bonding and exploiting of new
properties goes on at a lively rate. Owing
to the low stage of water In the streams,
river-bed mining was never so lively as
this season.
Fuller's earth will bo added to the long
H^t of California's commercial mineral
i products, If a recent discovery in San.
j Bernardino County is correctly reported
jby the San Bernardino Sun. In reporting
| the discovery that paper says: "It was
i made by S. S. Simon, a well
known prospector, who claims he haa
found an immense bed. apparently inex
haustible, of Puller's earth. Samples ot
this valuable article have been found in
the county before, but they were more
of a clay than an earth, and so far In
ferior to the imported Fuller's earth a>
to be valueless.
"The new discovery when tried along
side of that from England Is not only
fully equal in quality, but by some is
pronounced superior. Fuller's earth in
used very freely In packing houses and
so pleased is the management of thu
Cudahy Packing Company of Los An
gtlt-s that they havp made a contract to
take twenty-four tons per month of th:Â»
n<-w discovery. The Armour Packing
Company u:-e from ?00 to 600 tons per
month, all of which is imported from
Engrland. As the article sells readily at
$20 per ton the financial status of tho
case is easily discernible. There are im
ported a million tons per annum into this
country.
"The location of this discovery Is not
to be made public Just at present, but
it is but seven miles from the Santa Fe
road in this county, on the oth^r side of
the range. Work of development wllj
commence instde of three weeks, when the
article, will be ready for upc, and will
be shipped all over the United States.
Samples have been testexl by scientists
at Sf.n Francisco, who pronounce It the
genuine article.
"There Is on top of the bed of Fuller's
earth vast beds of valuable silica, with
out a trace o iron in its composition,
making it very useful for making glans.
Further developments will be awaited and
if they confirm the tirst investigations it
Is evident the new discovery will prove a.
valuable adjunct to the wealth of tho
county."
The mining industry of Shasta and in
part that of Trinity and Sisklyou coun
ties awaits processes and facilities for
working base ores economicall}'. While
good minea and occasionally gToat ones
| in which free milling processes can be
used have been and are being rapidly de
veloped, there are a groat many ore
bodies being uncovered that must await
smelters and other plants. The value of
the Keswick smelters in creating a de
mand for quartz ores for flux in the sur
rounding region and making profitable
I many mines was illustrated last week.
Such news as the promised resuscitation
of Charlea Butters' chlorinatlon plant at
Kennet is hailed with joy. Not a week
goes by without developments which
point to the great need of a great re
gion.
One comes this week from Coffee Creek,
Trinity County through the columns of
the Redding Searchlight- During that
still remembered Coffee Creek rush of a
year ago Willinm "i.uax. an old Cripple
Creek miner, and Matt Dillon, a tender
foot miner from the Tivoli Opera-house
hero, came in with the tide. Truax ran
j across some rock blasted out of an old
ditch r.nil passed by prospectors for fif
teen years. His Colorado experience en
abled him to recognize it as sylvanite ore
and location notices went up, as did the
I assay reports. Truax has stayed with
Coffee Creek and is now driving a 200
fo.it tunnel. He has Just shipprd two
tons of ore to the Shasta Sampling Works
I to find the b<jst method of treatment.
Tests show that the ore will yield $6C a
: ton, besides the rich sulp'hurets. To ship
this ore even to Redding would cost $4U
! a ton, and Selby's might as well be at
! Swansea.
Mr. Truax states that individually he
! knows of a dozen claims in the Coffee
i Creek section, with base ore, which will
| run as high as $4<\ but oven at that figure
they cannot at present be worked success
fully, and are lying idle. When facilities
for handling ba^e proposition* are intro
duced in that section claims such as the
above will be worth thousands of dol
lars to the owners. In fact the posslblH
ttt-s offered in old Trinity are just being
1 thoroughly brought to the notice of the
! world.
In the same issue of the Searchlight ap
pears the following:
"J. W. Parmaiee. owner of the Minne
sota mine on the headwaters of Spring
Creek, ia working both day and night
shifts at the mine now driving a drift to
' tap the ledge. The ore through which,
they aro passing runs about $11 a ton. and
a pocket formation which they strike fre
quently runs as hi*-" as $340 to $3CO. The
ore is not freo milling, however, and it is
j not being worked, although it is being
saved. If the same formation continues
I Mr. Parmaiee will put in a cyanide
plant."
EH Dorado County enjoys nothing that
may be called a boom, and the industry
is not forging ahead, as it is in its neigh
bor, old Tutilumtie, but Its mining de
velopment is proceeding with a steady
i flow toward the greatness which it will
: share with all the mother lode counties
when quartz minine In the greatest gold
region of the world reaches its destiny.
How this mining development is going on
'â  is illustrated this week in a little corre
1 spondence from Nashville, in that coun
j ty. It is typical of what Is going on In
scores of out-of-the-way localities all
through the mining region. The corre
spondent reports in part:
"The mining industry here has taken
i quite a start lately. A number of new
: companies are preparing to begin opera

The Oroville Mercury says that 40,000

A Mariposa correspondent of the Min
ing and Scientific Press thus reports the !
reopening of another long abandoned
mine: "Work was resurhed on July 5 oh
the McAlpine mine, on the line between
Mariposa and Tuolumne counties. The
property, which has a record of produc
ing over $300,000 above the 300-foot level,
ha-a been closed for many years, and-,
though many efforts were made to ar
range for Its reopening, they all failed for
one reason or another. The pay ore In
the old workings was In two shoots about
400 feet apart and consisted of from a

FILED A FRIENDLY ACTION.
A Member Sues the Y. M. C. A. for
the Purpose of Bringing About
a Desired End.
A friendly suit was brought against the
Young Men's Christian Association yes
terday by one 01 its members for the pur
pose of cutting down the interest account
on mortgages on the present lot and build
ing. Should the proceeding be successful,
some friend of the institution will buy in
the property, remortgagc it and hold it in
trust until the Suttcr-Ptreet property is
sold and the entire indebtedness canceled.
One of the executive board, In speaking
about the matter yesterday, explained the
present action.
"The articles of incorporation under
which the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion exists." he said, "contain a clause pro
hibiting the mortgaging of property
owned by the association. When the
present site at the northeast corner of
Mason and Ellis streets vaa purchased
there was a mortgage of $50,000 on the lot,
which was transferred with the lot to the
corporation. There was also a Judgment
of $41,000 due Mahony Bros., builders, on
completion of the building. The associa
tion, being unable to dispose of its Sut
ter-street property at any reasonable
figure, has withdrawn the property from
the market, with the hope that it may
increase in value in the next few years.
In order to cut down the Interest account,
after consultation with the bank, Mahony
Bros, and the directors of the association,
it was unanimously decided to bring a
friendly suit of foreclosure, the property
to be bought in by a friend of the insti
tution, who will remortgago it and hold
it in trust for the institution until the
Sutter-street property is sold and the
entire indebtedness canceled. The suit is
entirely friendly, and brought at the re
quest of the management of the associa
tion. All parties concerned have donated
their legal fees.
"The two properties of the association
are valuable, and being wholly unable to
rely upon assets depended upon has re
tarded the financial condition of the as
sociation. Notwithstanding this fact,
within the past two years we have raised
and paid off $100,000, and have made the
work lit the new building entirely self
suataining; that is, rents and member
ships from that building pay all current
expanses, so when the new building Is en
tirely free of lncumbrance the Institution
will be in splendid shape. The movement
regarding tho mortgaging of the property
as above outlined will save hundreds of
dollars a year interest.
"The work of the association Is very
popular and exceedingly successful, and it
1b unfortunate that a work so valuable in
this community should be embarrassed
by the need of a few thousand dollars.
It needs friends, and now is a most op
portune time- for some of our wealthy citi
zens to come forward and free the build
ing from all Ineumbrances. This could
easily be done If our wealthy citizens
would manifest an interest to this end.
"Considering the financial depression
which has continued almost since the as
sociation building enterprise was started,
and the fact that we have not been able
to dispose of our Sutter-street property
I think we are to be congratulated that
we saved the building 1 . It was only done
by rood management and financiering."

POLICEMAN
MARSHALL'S
BAD ERROR
He Vainly Attempts to
Swell His Record.
ARRESTS AN INNOCENT BOY
"COLD FEET" WITTMAN ADDS
INSULT TO INJURY.
Acting Police Judge Barry, When
Informed of the Outrage Per
petrated, Released the
Child.
Policeman John Marshall is likely to
find himself In serious trouble. Last Fri
day night he arrested a 6-year-old boy
named Walter Cushman, the son of a
letter carrier, who lives at the corner of
I street and Sixteenth avenue, and booked
him for some public institution. Marshall
claimed that he met the boy on Ilaight
street, and as he declared that he had
been ill-treated by his father, he decided
to lock him up. The boy was then sent
to the City Prison in the patrol wagon
and given in charge of the matron.
Realizing that Marshall had made a
serious mistake in arresting: the boy,
"â¢'old Feet" YVlttman, who was in charge
of the Central Station, attempted to ex
plain the outrage by saying thaT young
Cushman might have committed some
theft and was detected in the act by the
officer. Two citizens, on learning that the
boy was in the City Prison, immediately
hunted up Justice Barry, who is acting
for Judge Ix>tv. and induced him to re
lease the youthful prisoner on his own
recognizance. Maddened at th>lr action
\\ittman proceeded to "call them down"
when he was promptly told to mind his
own business.
A fpw minutes later the parents of the
boy visited police headquarters and en
tered a vigorous kick against the arrest
of their offspring. They bitterly rpppnted
the imputation that the boy was a thief
and threatened to make it very interest
ing for the arresting officer arid Captain
Wittman.
Evldenty scenting trouble the latter
presumably concluding that Marshall was
in the wrong, did not compel the boy to
appear before a police magistrate yes
terclHj- morning, as is customary in such
cases.
To a Call reporter Cushmari Sr. said
that the arrest of the boy was a high
handed outrage.
"Why this policeman arrested him," he
remarked, "is beyr.nd my comprehension.
Before the boy was released by order of
Justice Barry I went to Wittman and
asked him to release him. He not only
insulted me, but ordered me out of his
office. If a 6-year-old boy can be thrown
In prison simply because he happens to
stray away from home it is about time
that the Police Commissioners should call
a halt."
Marshall in his report of Wittman says
that aft<>r ho had taken the boy Into
custody his mother appeared and start
ed to explain why he had run away from
home. She claimed, according to his
story, that the father had been rather se
vere with him and that ho decided to
abandon the paternal roof.
Mrs. diflhman emphatically denied that
she had told tli** officious policeman any
thing of the kind and threatens to make
him prove it at the next meeting of the
Police Commissioners.

RED CROSS NURSES
WILL BE IN CHARGE
AN EVENING PAPER TELEGRAM
AROUSES RIDICULE.
Funds for the Hospital Ship Still
Pouring In â What the Work
ers Are Doing.
A "special" telegram printed In an even-
Ing paper yesterday aroused the ridicule
of every member of the Red Cross So
ciety who was fortunate enough to read
It. It was to the effect that three ladles,
who have been organizing a National
"White" Cross League for work among
the soldiers at the Philippines, had re
ceived assurances from the Secretary of
War that when the hospital Bhlp sailed
for Manila, in a few weeks, thirty-three
r.urses of the opposition would be sent
along.
While many of the ladies engraved in
work of relief in this city laugh at the re
port, still they are indignant that the
Secretary of War should make a promise,
If he did make it, that other than mem
bers of their organization be sent in such
capacity.
Mrs. W. B. Harrington, president of the
State society, who has advocated the
sending of a hospital ship, when shown
the dispatch wrinkled her brow and said,
"Nonsense!" General Wesley Merrltt had
assured her before sailing that if the Red
Cross Society succeeded in raising the
money necessary none but local nurses
would be allowed on board the vessel.
Judge Sheldon, the lately arrived national
representative of the socit-ty, told Mrs.
Harrington that the Government would
not recognize any society but that of the
Red Cross. The absurdity of the story
caused Mrs. Harrington to smile at rtrst,
but when she thought of the injury it
might do in collecting fund* for the ship
she said she regretted Its publication.
At the special meeting of the executive
committee of the San Francisco Red
Cross Society yesterday It was resolved
that $5(>00 be appropriated and made avail
able for the formation and maintenance
of the hospital in Manila. to<be paid here
to the State Society. Six nurses have al
ready been sent, and more are to go on
the next transports with hospital equip
ments. It was also suggested that the
State society communicate with all other
States having regiments In Manila asking
their assistance in the hospital work
there.

HAS MADE
DUE APOLOGY
Captain Barnes Calls on
Miss Connors.
WHY HE DID NOT APPEAR
HIS SECRETARY FAILED TO
SEND A LETTER,
Fourth of July Incident Settled With
Perfect Satisfaction to
All Parties Con
cerned.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 16.
Captain William S. Barnes of the Peta
luma Regulars and District Attorney of
San Francisco, has been restored to the
pedestal of gallantry upon which he stood
prior to the Fourth of July. He has made
the amend honorable and has anoioglzed
for his apparent slight to Oakland and
especially to the lady on the committee
whom he promised that he would appear
and make a speech.
It was not Captain Barnes" fault at all.
As a soldier and a gentleman he promised
to speak, and had prepared one of his
usual able speeches. He did not fall
asleep and forget to wake up in time to
appear at the Macdonough Theater. He
did not intend to disappoint Alameda
County, although two or three day's prior
| to the Fourth he did change his mind
| about making a speech and decided that
he had better keep silent on such an oc
casion as the Fourth of July.
It was all the fault of a Mr. Dunne.
So says Captain Barnes. Mr. Dunne is the
"Petaluma captain's private secretary, and
when Captain Barnes changed his mind
about the speech that he was to deliver
in the Macdonough Theater he told Mr.
Dunne to notify the lady of his intention
not to speak in plenty of time to permit
the committee to procure another orator.
This is the letter that never camt and
which caused Captain Barnes to be cen
sured by the committee and which in
duced it to send him a very tart letter de
manding either an explanation or apology
or both.
Miss Mollie Connors, the petite chair
man of the entertainment committee, was
visited by the portly captain of the Peta
luma company in response to the com
mittee's letter. He informed Miss Con
nors that ne meant no disrespect to the
city of Oakland, and most uecidedlv did
he mean no disrespect to a laay. He re
gretted the incident and impressed Miss
Connors with his sincerity, so the captain
was pardoned and the aggrieved lady was
molllned, and the incident closed, Mr.
Dunne not having yet been heard from.
Captain Barnes is now shy of Oakland
platforms. An effort was made to obtain
his presence for the purpose of a speech
at the meeting of the Younp Men's Re
publican League last night. William Nat
Friend, the treasurer of the league, went
out to the camp at 9 o'clock in thf morn
ing, and last night he told the league of
his non-success. "I went out to the
camp," said Secretary Friend, "and asked
u> Bee Captain Barnes. This was 9 o'clock
in the morning. I sent in my card with a
little notification of what I desired, r. nd
the reply came back that the lines would
be opened for the reception of visitors at
4 p. m. I looked among the tents and
saw a large person that resembled a tor
pedo busy around the Petaluma company.
N'"t being: able to approach any nearer
the orator-soldier because of a few bayo
nets that were between us. I decided not
to wait the seven hours, and consequently
Captain Barnes Is not addressing you to
night."
MAY REMOVE THE
BOARD'S SECRETARY
CITY ENGINEER CLEMENT IS
SEEKING SATISFACTION.
Dow Is Ready and the Mayor's Son
May Soon Be Decapitated
After the Vacation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 16.
City Attorney Dow is away on his vaca
tion, and when he returns it is probable
lhat the political wheel at the City Hall
may take another turn. A few months
ago, when changes were made in the po
lice and fire departments it was under
stood that the programme was not fully
carried out. In the distribution of the pa
tronage City Engineer Clement, the Dem
ocratic member of the board, was to have
been given the privilege of naming a nÂ«*w
Superintendent of Streets.
This change was not made, and, conse
quently, altiiough Clement voted with the
Mayor to pit in two Republicans and put
out two Populists, the City Engineer has
as yet not teen able to place nls friend
Melvin Holmes, a Democrat, at the head
of the street department. Mayor Thomas
has never shown a willingness to Join
Clement in making a change of street su
perintendents. Just when the programme
was about to be carried out, the Mer
chants' Exchange and the Board of
Trade made a very pronounced kick
against changing the head of the street
department for purely political motives.
They issued a statement Betting forth that
Street Superintendent Miller is a very
capable officer and is doing good work oh
the streets of this city, and protesting
against his removal. As Mayor Thomas
at that time had troubles enough of his
own, the protest of the commercial bodies
had groat weight and Mr. Clement's man
wan shelved.
Recently Mr. Clement has been chafing
under his Inability to have his way and
he has now thrown out a hint that when
Mr. Dow returns the combination will be
Clement and Dow and not Clement and
Thomas. The new combination, however,
will not produce much material improve
ment in Mr. Holmes' position, for it in not
likely that Mr. Dow will vote to dismiss
Mr. Miller. Clement, however, will derive
satisfaction, so it is stated, by voting
with Mr. Dow to dismiss the Mayor's son,
Harry Thomas, from his position as soc
retaray of the Board of Works. He will
have no difficulty In doing this, for Mr.
Dow has never voted for Harry Thomas
and has frequently intimated that he
would be pleased to vote for his successor.
Mr. Dow is expected back some time
next week, and his arrival is being await
ed with great interest by the politicians.
Lady Solicitors in Trouble.
OAKLAND, July 16.â Reports have
reached the Chief of Police that two
young women from Oakland were solicit
ing funds for the Home of Love for Chil
dren In this city and were misbehaving
themselves.
Mrs. W. W. Aver, who is at the head
of the home, said to-day that the ladies
who were soliciting funds for the home
are certainly not those referred to, and
she is certain there has been a mistake
made in connecting them with the home.
The Home of Love ladies returned to
Oakland to-day and positively deny that
they are the women of whom complaint
hae been made.
Pension for Mrs. Flaherty.
OAKLAND, July 16.â Mrs. Mary Fla
herty, who is prosecuting Conrad Thaler
for assault and battery, announces that
she has received word that her claim for
$2000 and $24 per month pension has been
allowed. She says her husband, who died
six years ago, was an officer In the reg
ular army and was wounded in an Indian
campaign in 1860. He recovered, but was
never nis former self afterward. The
wound was inflicted by a squaw.
Trying to Save Kelly.
OAKLAND, July 16.â An effort Is being
made by the friends of James Kelly to
get him off on the charge of assault with
a deadly weapon. He attacked Captain
J. F. Anderson on a local train recently,
threatening to kill him. Afterward he
admitted having lost all of his money in
the poolrooms in Sausallto and drank
heavily. The case will be finished In the
Police Court Monday.
I SAX Â±KAJN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 17, 1898.
BIG FORTUNE
IN RECIPES
Judge Greene's Decision
Against the Sanborns.
USES STRONG LANGUAGE
HINTS AT PERJURY AND SAYS
THINGS ARE CROOKED.
Sanborn, Who Is Superintendent of a
Sunday-School, Takes Issue
With the Court and
Will Appeal.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 16.
Judge Greene decided this afternoon
against the Sanborns in the contest over
the possession of recipes between di
rectors of the California Pure Food Com
pany. Four years ago Mr. Sanborn and
his son claimed to own recipes for the
manufacture of pure food, valued at $50,
000. They had no capital but organized
a company with themselves and Messrs.
Hayne, Spencer and Griffiths of San
Francisco on the board of directors. The
Sanborns declined to give their recipes
to the company, and according to the
contract between them and the company
the papers were to be held in escrow and
used solely for the company's benefit.
The younger Sanborn was put in charge
of the manufactory, but the other three
directors gradually acquired control of
the stock and put one of their friends in
charge of the works. At the same time
the three directors attempted to secure
possession of the recipes, which were in
escrow in San Francisco. As soon as the
Sanborns heard of this they raced across
the bay and succeeded in getting the
recipes and brought them to Oakland,
placing them in the care of Mayor
Thomas.
Suit was begun by the other directors,
and after a lengthy trial was decided thi3
afternoon. Judge Greene scored the San
borns and stated that they had been guil
ty of perjury and underhanded conduct,
and further said he did not believe their
story that they had lost the duplicate
copies of the recipes, but that they were
hiding them for their own benefit. He or
dered the papers turned over to the three
directors at once.
The younger Mr. Sanborn Is highly in
censed at Judge Greene's remarks.
"I have been superintendent of a Sun
day-school for several years in this city
and have always stood very high in the
community," said Mr. Sanborn. "Judge
Greene had no right to draw such infer
ences from the testimony. He called us
perjurers and said we were trying to de
ceive the directors, when, as a matter of
fact, we really t have lost the book con
taining duplicate copies of the valuable
recipes. We shall appeal this case and I
have no doubt we shall be able to prove
that Judge Greene's ideas are altogether
wrong."
LAKE MERRITT TO BE PURGED.
Its Unsanitary Condition Brought
Forcibly to the Council's
Attention.
OAKLAND, July M.â The Lake Merritt
Sanitary Improvement Club made its first
public appearance last evening at the
committee of the whole of the City Coun
cil. Captain Edwin Goodall, its presi
dent, explained the club's existence with
a few words, saying that "until recently
we supposed no one sewered into Lake
Merritt." Continuing he said:
"When we found that between 600 and
700 people had sewers pmptying into Cem
etery Creek we became very much
alarmed and decided to organize to put a
stop to It. I think it is generally admitted
that the sewering into Lake Merritt
should be discontinued. We are very
anxious that you give us the support to
alarmed and decided to organize to put a
â¢ stop to it. I think it is generally admitted
j that the sewering into Lake Merritt
' should be discontinued. We are very
j anxious that you give us the support to
stop this. In addition we want to dredge
the lake. It Is an open cesspool as it is
i at present. The water has been analyzed
I and found to be in a filthy, condition. I
understand the enforcement of the law
will stop the sewage that is coming Into
! the lake. We especially ask you to make
! some appropriation for the dredging of
I the lake, for, as I said, it is a cosspool
. and a mudhole. We come to you for re
lief on sanitary lines and that alone. Wo
have gathered data that will give you full
i information in regard to the sewage
which goes Into Lake Merritt."
Ira Bishop followed with an enuncia
i tion of all the tributaries leading into
; the main pipe, which empties into Lake
i Merritt.
"These aggregate 14.7 miles," declared
the speaker, "and the refuse and filth
from all this line empties right out of
one box within a block of Lake Merritt
I proper. After the tide recedes one or
] two feet the ground is left bare, and
â  from this time to the time the water
| returns the deposit forced from this fif
i teen miles of sewer Is left upon the fnud
! and the incoming tide carries it out with
| It. Indeed, when I heard Captain Goodall
call that lake a cesspool I could hardly
think that any other name was proper."
The committee recommended that the
'â  Council take the matter up at once. They
i appointed Councilmen Heitman, Broana
i han and Cuvelller to confer with the City
Engineer and City Attorney regarding
J plans, etc.

Alameda People in a Quandary as to
What Is .Best to Be Done.
ALAMEDA, July 16.â Notwithstanding
the fact that the City Trustees last even-
Ing passed a resolution expressing their
willingness to pay the expense of con-
Btructing the approaches to the Alice-
Btreet bridge so that structure can be
used for traffic while the Welister-street
bridge is being rebuilt, there is little prob
ability that the work will be done at fie
public expense. The difficulty is that fully
three-fourths of the expense will have to
be incurred on the Alameda side of tho
estuary, while the cost of putting the ap
proaches into shape on the Oakland side
will be merely nominal. The benefit of
the bridge is in inverse ratio, Oakland
profiting by it to a far greater extent than
Alameda. It is expected to cost some
$13)0 or $1800 to put in the approach on this
side, and this amount the trustees do not
feel authorized to expend. The opinion
prevails that Oakland ought at least to
pay half the cost, and if the city cannot
legally do so, then the merchants most
benefited ought to contribute.
But it can be depended upon that this
city will not stand the full expense.
Rather will it got along without any
bridge and send its traffic around by
TWenty-third avenue and East Oakland.
Saved From Drowning.
ALAMEDA, July 16.â Two lads, Louis
Wehmuth and Carleton Moulthrop, saved
a man from drowning in the estuary last
evening. They were out rowing when
they saw a skiff adrift with two fright
ened children in it, while some distance
off was a man swimming toward the
boat and apparently nearly exhausted.
They went to his aid, and with a rope
managed to get him out of the water just
as he was sinking. He was taken to
shore with the skiff and the children, but
refused to give his name, and nls identity
was not learned.
Library Report.
ALAMEDA, July 16.â The annual report
of Librarian Weller has been prepared. It
shows a prosperous condition of the insti
tution. The expenses for the year were
SGSIB 80 and the receipts $924S S9. leaving a
balance of $2730 19. There is a discrep
ancy in the accounts of $255 08, being
money drawn on forged warrants by the
former librarian. There were added 1913
books to the library while 12.156 more
books were taken out by patrons than in
the preceding year. The total number of
books withdrawn was 138,150. of which

lfi.2 per cent and miscellaneous 27.4 per
cent.

STAMP TAX DECISIONS.
Patent Medicines Must Be Stamped
at the Price Advertised by-
Manufacturers.
A number of very Interesting decisions
on the new stamp tax law were received
at the Custom House from the Treasury-
Department Friday. One of the most
Important, Is that relating to the so-called
"cut rate" drug stores, which cell an ar
ticle slightly below the price advertised
by the manufacturer. All the articles
taxable under schedule B, which wera
within the hands of the retailer on July 1,
must, when sold, be stamped according
to the retail price fixed by the manufac
turer. All artificial mineral waters, If ad
vertised as having medicinal qualities,
must be stamped. Hop ale is also liable
to tax as a fermented liquor, while gin
ger ale is free. The stamping of outsid*
cases in lieu of separate packets is not
allowed, although stamps may be affixed
In this way before the shipment of arti
cles abroad. Tobacco and snuff held In
stock by the manufacturer on and after
June 14. whether stamped or unstamped,
if intended for sale, is subject to tax at
the rate of 12 cents per pound.
Where a check drawn subsequent to
July 1 is presented at a bank without the
requisite etamp, the bank, if it pays, be
comes liable to the penalty. It may, how
ever, affix the stamp and charge tho
amount to the drawer or drawee. No
stamp Is required for the withdrawal of
money from savings banks by depositors
on pass-books, and the 3 per cent loan is
also exempt from taxation. Stamps issued
under the Internal Revenue laws now re
pealed, cannot, be used for the new tax,
and no discount will be allowed on im
printed stamps or chocks.
ONE MORE SCHOOL WANTED.
West of Castro Street Has Troubles
of Its Own on Hand.
Families residing west of Castro street
demand a twelve-class school building for
the accommodation of the hundreds of
children who, during the past two years,
have been deprived of the privilege of
attending regularly to their studies. Par
ents in this valley have been compelled
to send some of their children to school
during the forenoon and some during thw
afternoon in order that notwithstanding
the lack of accommodation their children
might at least receive a limited educa
tion rather than none at all. For all tho
children in Noe Valley there are but tw<Â»
schools; the James Lick on Twenty-flftn
and Noo, and the Noe Primary on Noa
and Jersey, both of which are east of
Castro, and have children sufficient from
that side of the line to fill all the seats
without any of those from the west' or
Castro. Some few months ago a census
of the children of school age was taken
in the valley when it was found that
there were over 500 who had but limited
accommodation in the school buildings.
As a result, the parents were forced to
engage private teachers to give their
children lessons rather than have then,
grow up in ignorance.
Now they ask that a sufficient appro-
Sriation be made to erect a twelve-class
ulldlng on the west side of Castro street.
Before this, however, they would send a.
gilt edged vote of thanks to the Super
visors if that distinguished body woula
give that part of the city four electric
lights. Egyptian darkness prevails aftei
sunset in that region.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noormn. 1017-1023 Mission.

IMPROVEMENTS FOR
CALIFORNIA RIVERS
WING DAMS TO BE PLACED AT
NEWTON SHOALS.
Commerce Greatly Benefited by
Work Done by the Commission
of Public Works.
The auditing board of the Commission
of Public Works held a meeting yester
day afternoon at the Lick House to con
sider the claims that have come in dur
ing the month. There were present in at
tendance Ed E. Leake, the Commissioner
on Public Works: M. A. Nurse, chief en-
gineer; Major Heuer, Government engi
neer; Chairman H. J. Corcoran of Stock
ton; Captain T. B. Hall of Sacramento,
and John Markley of San Francisco.
The usual month's claims were audited
and allowed. When the contract was let
for the construction of wing dams at
Newton Shoals the specifications called
for sand In sacks to be used as ballast.
The Government engineers recommended
rock to be substituted for sand. One of
the conditions of the permission granted
by the Secretary of War to do this work
provides that rock shall be used instead
of sand. The Commission of Public
Works, Captain Hall and Engineer Nurse
were appointed a committee to modify
the contracts and make all necessary ar
rangements for the substitution.
The approximate estimate of work done
on cut-off 6 on the San Joaquin River by
J. C. Smith amounted to $5343 75.
Samuel Henerey sent In a claim for ease
ment work at Elkhorn weir amounting
to $3519 38. The work on the cut-offs will
greatly facilitate the navigation on the
river. The improvements made will make
it possible for steamers to lessen the time
of their trip by a half-hour.
The steamer H. J. Corcoran will make
Jts first trip from Stockton to this city
in the early part of next week.

LIVES OF MANY
SCHOOL CHILDREN
WERE EXPOSED
Grand Jury Unearths a Fresh
Scandal in the School
Department.
Still another scandal In the Board of I
Education has been unearthed by the
Grand Jury, which promises to involve
that unhonored body in more trouble than
all its other misdeeds that have been pa- '
raded before public view.
This latest expose will prove of especial
st to parents, as showing how
lightly the lives of school children are i
valued, for 200 of them were quartered in
a half-finished building for & week, with
naught to shield them from the chilling
blasts but pieces of muslin stretched over
the unglazed windows. It also shows how
the school tax levy was skillfully padded,
and finally brings to light the fact that
the city has a white elephant on Its hands
in the shape of a building out in the Mis
sion costing thousands of dollars, that In
its present stale is unfit for the purpose
for which It was intendedâ that of a high
schoolâ and still is too good to be rented
for stable purposes.
Here Is the case as it ha.s been presented
to the Grand Jury, and which its partial
investigation shows to be correct:
To meet the demands of the large and
populous district known as the Mission
f.-r better educational facilities, the Board
of Education awarded a contract to the
Rea Contracting Company something over !
a year ago for the i rection of a high
school building at the corner of Eight
eenth and Dolores streets. The Rea Com- !
pany was composed of prominent con
tractors engaged in various branches per- â¢
tafhlng to the construction of buildings, i
and was supposed to be financially sound.
It also had the contract for the construe- j
tion of the Affiliated Colleges, and this is
what caused all the trouble. The com
pany sublet all the work to Individual
contractors. As the work advanced pro

ITCHING
Eczema All Over Head and Faoe.
Two Doctors, No Benefit. .
Tried CUTICURA REMEDIES
with Rapid Cure.
I was troubled several years with cutaneous
diseases which developed into chronic Ec-
zema, which spread all over my head, and
down on my face. I took medical treatment
from two doctors and received but little re-
lief. Then I tried several lotions, etc., which
we had in the store, but only received little
relief from them. At times, tho dreadful
itching became almost intolerable. When I
â was heated, the Eczema became painful, and
almost distracted me. I was advised to try
Coticura Remedies and did so, and found
them all that is claimed for them. The Ecze-
ma rapidly disappeared, and ] am well, with
no trace of any cutaneous disease. Shall
always recommend Citicira to all.

gresslve payments were made to the Rea
Company until nearly $100,000 had been
received' from the Board of Education by
that concern.
But Instead of paying the sub-contract
ers, who had advanced the funds for ma
terials and labor, their proportion of the
progressive payments, the company put
all the money It received from the city
into the construction of the Affiliated Col
leges.
There came a time when the sub-con
tractors refused to go on with the work
until they received some money. The mat
ter was presented to the Board of Educa
tion and after a lons period, during
which the work was brought to a stand
still the bondsmen of the Rea Company
were Induced to linlsh the contract. They
in turn BUblet the work to James F. Lo
gan who held the original sub-contract
For the carpenter work, and who then had
several thousand dollars tied up in the
building.
With this tangle straightened out and
the outlook favorable for the completion
of the building some time during the ap
proaching school year, the board took up
the consideration of the school tax levy.
In this connection the question of prin
cipal and teachers for the Mission High
School was brought up. To be sure there
was no immediate prospect of the school
being ready for use, but it might bo some
time, and 'it offered a splendid opportun
ity to "uoost" the estimates for the ex
penses of the department a little.
That was sufficient, and in the scramble
for the fat. juicy plum of the principal
shin Joseph O'Connor came out victorious.
O'Connor was then principal of the Ilor
. i c Mann school at a salary of $2100 a
year, but his new position would pay him
$3000. His appointment was made May
15, last, to date from August 1, when the
new school year would begin.
But in the meantime the new tax levy
bad to be made up and to insure pro*
vision for O'Connor's increased salary It
was deemed advisable to make some dem
onstration that the new principal would
FORCED THE
DOOR WITH
A "JIMMY"
Bold Burglary on Lom
bard Street.
VALUABLE PROPERTY TAKEN
THE BESIDENCE OF MRS. KANE
IS ENTERED.
Captain Seymour and His Men Are
Searching for Two Peddlers,
Who Were Seen Near
the House.
While the family was absent burglars
yesterday afternoon entered the residence
of Mrs. Kane, at 513 Lombard street, and
got away with jewelry o. n <s clothing val
ued at $500.
Shortly after 2 o'clock Mrs. Kane left
her home to visit a friend whn lives in tho
adjoining block. When she returned
about an hour later she was surprised to
find that the house had been entered dur
ing her absence.
The housebreakers gained an entrance
by forcing the rear door with a jimmy.
After getting inside they broke open sev
eral trunks and appropriated the most ex
pensive articles. In a bureau drawer they
found three gold watches, one of which
belonged to S. Isaacs, a brother of Mrs.
Kane. The timepiece was inscribed "A.
O. U. "W. to S. Isaacs," and was presented
to him by the members of that organiza
tion. Isaacs keenly feels the loss of th^
watch and has offered a reward for its
rocovrry.
The burglara also secured half a dozen
valuable silver spoons and considerable
wearing apparel.
As two peddlers were seen ringing tho
front-door bell a short time after Mrs.
Kane had left the place, the police arÂ«
convinced that fhey are the culprits. One
of them had several potatoes in his hand,
and after ringing several door bells In the
same block lie approached the residence
of Mrs. Kane.

have a chance to earn his salary. To do
this four classes were transferred from
the temporary school at the corner of
Twenty-third and Sanchez streets, rented
by the board, and quartered In the unfin
ished building at Eighteenth and Dolores
streets for a week before the 6ummer va
cation began. There they held their clos
ing exercises, and there they were ex
posed to all the rigors of San Francisco's
climate. That there were no deaths or no
serious illness from this exposure Is due
to the interference of Providence, for in
stead of the high winds that almost con
stantly sweep over the peninsula, that
week the climate happened to be soft and
balmy.
The plastering on the walls of the
building was hardly dry; not a window
was glazed, but instead they were cov
ered with thin white muslin, tacked to
the casings. The old furniture from the
Sanchez-street building was hastily
dumped into the unfurnished rooms, and
there during the closing week of the term
nearly 200 pupils were in attendance,
climbing over and through the heaps of
rubbish to reach their class rooms. But
Principal O'Connor had his school organ
ized, and the board had made good their
raid on the taxpayers.
There was no way whatever of heating
the rooms, for the board has been en
joined from putting in the apparatus con
tracted for, and the injunction is still In
force.
But while O'Connor gets his $3000 a year,
the very means adopted to flinch it bids
fair to shut off the completion of the
school buildingâ at least, under the exist
ing terms, and it is this turn of affairs
that Is proving of particular interest to
the Grand Jury just now.
Contractor Logan and the bondsmen of
the Rea Contracting Company manifest
little or no inclination to finish the work,
and have set up the claim that they can
not be compelled to, for the reason that
the occupancy of the building by the four
classes during the last week of the term
was, in effect, an aceptance of the
building by the Board of Education
In Its present state, and that they are
entitled to the balance due on the con
tract without doing another stroke of
work.
At all events, the work Is dragging
along at the pleasure of the contractor,
and there is not the remotest possibility
of the building being anywhere near com
pleted by the Ist of August, when the
new school year begins. Possibly the
Board of Education will attempt to use
the unfinished building again, unmindful
of the consequent dangers to the lives
of the pupils, though it does not seem
likely that the members will dare at
tempt Buch a thins, now that the Grand
Jury has begun an investigation into the
whole affair, which promises to be most
thorough.
Superintendent Webster has already
been called before that body, but denied
having any knowledge of the matter. lie
did not even know that four classes had
been quartered in the Mission High
School fi>r a week. â¢
Such ignorance of the affairs of the de
partment on the part of the Superintend
ent is painful.
not getting a response the thieving ped
dler signaled his partner, and together
they went around to the rear of the
house. Evidently realizing that the family
was absent the house-breakers lost no
time in effecting an entrance. In one of
tffe bedrooms the burglars ripped open
a mattress, so determined were they not
to overlook anything of vaiue.
During the past few weeks a number
of houses In the same vicinity have been
entered and valuable property taken. In
nearly every case the family was absent
at the time, and the crooks experienced
no difficulty in forcing an entrance and
getting away with everything they de
sired to.
The police have a description of the
men. and every effort is being made to
run them down.

FRANK- GOULD
MADE FIGURES
FOR A FRIEND
He Changed the Official Report
of a State Com
mission-
Among the many monuments to the
potency of the political pull of Frank
H. Gould of Stockton, which has suc
cessfully grafted him upon the political
tree, there to blossom and bear fruit,
is the office of president of the State
Board of Building and Loan Associa
tion Commissioners. This office, while
not so lucrative and important as Is
an insane asylum directorship, is a
pleasant path on which to walk to as
sist a friend or two. It has got him,
however, into some little trouble, as
FRANK H. GOULD, President of the State Building
and Loan Association Commission,
well as notoriety, with national under
writers, who make a grave charge
against him.
He is accused of unlawfully altering
an official report of his board by dis
torting the facts, the said distortion be
ing of great benefit in an advertising
way to his friend \V. C. Murdock of
the Pacific Coast Savings Society,
whose office is in the Flood building.
Gould and Murdock admit that the
report of the board was changed after
it had been made, but they say that the
alteration was for the purpose of cor
recting an error made by the secretary'
of the board, James L. Fields.
A short time ago the National Under
writer, a periodical published In New
York and Baltimore, contained a cais
tic article on the subject, from which
the following extracts are taken:
When the report of the Building and Loan
Commissioners was printed and came from the
press some time af-> It stirred up a good sized
sensation In building- and loan circles. The
figures, as they had first beÂ«n given out by
the Commissioners, and as they finally left the
Commissioners' hands, were two vastly differ
ent things. The results as displayed by the
first Information given out from the Commis
sioners' office and the results as displayed In
the final report are entirely different. The
first report of the Commissioners, the correct
one, showed that those associations classed rÂ«
nationals earned 11.12 per csnt of net profits
for the year, and that those classed as co
operative banks earned 6.57 per cent for the
same time. Cut some one was hurt, and when
the final production of the office of the Board
of Building and Loan ('ommissloners came
forth It decreased the showing of the nationals
iby over lMi per cent and Increased on the
j figures of co-operative banks by over 3 per
i cent. A like transformation took place In the
I figures of expense which are made by the Com
i rr.lssloners. The expense per share of the
i nationals was first given out correctly at .914,
! and the co-operative banks at 1.485. But sec-
I ond thought seemed a better thought to some
one who was In a position to alter the figures,
and the expenses of the nationals were In
creased by .122. while the expenses of the co
; operative banks were reduced to 1.036, being
i a reduction of just one-thlrtl. The figures of
the associations classed as locals remain un
: changed. It takes but a very simple proposi
! tlon In logic to demonstrate that one of these
; two sets of figures is false. â¢ * â¢ The figures
themselves have not been falsified: It is simply
I a case of "bookkeeping." The nationals show
by far the better record, and the locals suf
fered by comparison with them. The co-oper
ative banks show comparatively a very bad
report. Hence If the ligures of the co-opera
tive banks and the nationals be combined, it
will reduce the nationals to a level something
nearer the others, will very considerably raise
the showing of the co-operative banks and en
able the locals to compare much more favor
ably with the natlonalÃ-and the general pub
lic would not realize the manipulation.
It Is thus clear who instigated the manipu
lation. The report as It appears has been
approved by the office of the Commissioners,
and that office has attempted to explain away
the source of the manipulation. Hence the re
sponsibility for these perversions of truth must
rest upon that offlce.either collectively or upon
one or more of the members individually, with
or without the acquiescence of the others In
power at that place. It is evident that a com
bination of the locals and the co-operative
banks or at least one of them, has brought
political Influence or other "Influence" to bear
to the end that the report might be doctored
to serve their political purposes without regard
to the justice or honpsty of the figure* as they
finally appear, and as they are finally given
out by the Commissioners for general circu
lation.
At the time that the report of the
Commissioners was ready to be made
public the State Printing Office was
closed and it was necessary to have the
report printed by private subscription.
The national associations contributed
liberally to the fund, for the good
which the publication would do them
if truthfully made. The printing was
done by George W. Blum of the Journal
of Investment of this city. It is alleged
by Mr. Blum that the first and correct
report was sent to Governor Budd and
that a revised edition of the report was
printed afterward by order of Presi
dent Gould for general circulation.
Therefore the report published by
Gould's order for general circulation is
not the official report as filed with the
Governor.
Mr. Gould was asked yesterday to
give a statement regarding his action
SAYS HE WAS DRUGGED.
John Perry Robbed In a Howard-
Street Lodg-lng-House.
John Perry, a recent arrival from the
Interior, claims he was drugged and rob
bed last Friday night in a lodging house
on Howard street. According to his story
he met a stranger, who, after Ingratiat
ing himself into his confidence, invlteu
him to share his room. Perry accepted
In the matter. He said that Blum was
trying: to blackmail him.
"It is true that the report was
changed," said Mr. Gould, "and the
reason why was that Murdock's Pa
cific Coast Building and Loan Associa
tion had been improperly classified.
In all the reports prior to this the Pa
cific Coast Savings Society has been
properly classified as a co-operative
bank because they had been doing a
banking business in connection with
their building and loan business, but
more than a year prior to the publica
tion of this report they had gone out
Of the banking business as a building
and loan association entirely, and had
established what is known as the Bank
of Commerce in the same building, and
in that bank they had taken up all of
the banking business that was done by
the association, which left it simply a
building and loan society, and not a
co-operative bank in any sense what
ever. They objected to the classifica
tion by the secretary of the Building
and Loan Commission as a co-opera
tive bank, Inasmuch as one other co
operative bank in the State was going
into something like liquidation, and the
profits showed up, when the two were
averaged, in a very' unsatisfactory way
to those people Mr. Field, the former
and present secretary of the commis
sion, had prepared the report, and, not
knowing of the change In the Pacific
Coast Association, in his average had
included the Pacific Coast Savings and
Loan with this other co-operative bank
as a co-operative business.
"I had been but a sheet time ap
pointed as commissioner when the re
port was prepared and I had not had
an opportunity to familiarize myself
with the different institutions. How
ever, when the matter was called to my
attention I immediately saw that an in
justice had been done the Pacific Coast
Building: and Loan, not In its individual
report, as published, but in placing it
in the wronar place in its averages with
other institutions. I therefore, and for
that reason, directed the averages
simply to be changed and nothing else.
That is the ideaâ the Pacific Coast As
sociation changed from being associat
ed with the co-operative banks and put
it with the building and loan associa
tions where it properly belonged.
"I regretted very much the necessity
of making the change in the report as
it stood at that time, but I was com
pelled either to do that or to inflict seri
ous injustice on one of the building and
loan associations. Had I been in office
longer at that time and had I been as
familiar with the various institutions
as I am now the report would never
have been made with the averages as
they were made up in the report. I
simply did an act of justice and Blum
is tryln~ to blackmail me in the mat
ter."
Mr. Murdock was s^en In his office in
the Flood building. He said:
"At the time the report was rrade we
were a national building and loan asso
ciation and always had been and I in
sisted that we should be placed In the
category in which we belonged, and
when I showed it to Mr. Gould and
when he found that it was wrong he
had it corrected. We were doing a
banking business the year before, and
during that year the Bank of Com
merce was started and we went in
under the heal of National Building
and Loan. That eliminated all of
our banking business from the Pa
cific Coast Savings Society. We had
a banking department in the savings
society. When the Bank of Commerce
was started the banking business was
transferred to that concern. It is a
separate institution."
Mr. Murdock went on to say that on
last Friday two men called on him, one
of them representing himself to be the
attorney for Mr. ilium, and offered to
Sfive him all the printed matter in
Blum's possession relating to the al
tered report of the commission if he
would give them $150 for Blum. He
ordered them out of his office.
his offer, and as he reached the apart
ments he was surprised to find anothei
man in bed. The stranger explained that
he was his friend, and after awakening
the lattÂ«r, ordered him to get a bottle
of beer.
After drinking a glass of the foaming
beverage Perry fell asleep and did not
awaken until some time afterwaru.
Picking up his vest he searched it with
the result that he found that he had
been robbed of $32. Perry subsequently
visited police headquarters, where he re
ported the matter to Captain Spillane.

that have fallen by the wayside, un- i
to stand the strain of the terrible
trip, reach this city, and the story of
their aces go to make up the '
y of one of the maddest gold
rushes on record.
Tin-., days ago an athletic-looking
young Englishman, whose fine figure
was clothed in a garb that the poorest
clam gatherer on the coast would not
have envied, reached here from up the
line. His hands and face were blistered
by the sun and tanned to a nut brown
hue, and, combined with his striking
appearance and an indescribable air of
icholy he wore, he attracted gen
eral attention as he sauntered aim
lessly through the busy streets. This
gentleman was Ki.ger Pocock. intimate
friend of Sir Arthur Curtis, who
brought out the first authentic news o-f
that 111-fated baronet's search for gold
In the inhospitable north.
Pocock is a highly educated young
Englishman, whose yearning for an ad
venturous life led him at the beginning
of the present year to leave a home or
comfort and join Sir Arthur's expedi
tion to the Klondike.
The party decided to take the un
known Ashcroft route to the northern
gold fields and started out on its long
trip in April, the worst month they
<ould have chosen. The party was com
posed of Sir Arthur, Pocock, another
young Englishman and three hardy
miners, who had experienced roughing
it in the north.
In addition to the necessaries wine
and #ther delicacies were packed over
the rough trail for the use of Sir Ar
thur. The party obtained their pack
horses at Ashcroft The animals were
as wild as sea Berpents and the troubles
of the party commenced early. At
the time .Sir Arthur started out the
thermometer registered 10 degrees be
low zero. Of course there was no gTass
for the animals. As Pocock expressed
it, they did Dot expect to have their
horses starving <m hay at $50 a ton, or
all their rt^<r\a money would be
swallow.cd up in forage and pasture.
The horses, worked on insufficient
became discouraged, caught the
mper and died. Traveling through
quagmires and marshes the party
finally managed to reach Quesnelle
After a brief rest they pushed forl
ward, striking through an almost un
traveled country. Sir Arthur seemed
to enjoy the trip. He had no active
part in the rough camp work and
throughout lived up to the prevailing
idea of an English baronet. Pocock of
course, was <Â»n familiar terms with him
but the other members of the party
were kept at a discreet distance the

Arthur.
Shortly after tho start was made
from Quesnelle, the horses were turned

LONDON, July 11.â The recent
change In American sentiment
toward England is startling.
Moreover, it is universal and it
is sincere. When I was here less
than three years ago the popular
jest was on this wise: "May I ask,"
said the Eagle, "why you carry that
corkscrew?" "It hisn't a corkscrew,"
replied the Lion, "hit's my bloomin'
tail." To-day Puck's cartoon repre
sents John Bull and Uncle Sam side by
side, bayonet in hand, with the motto:
"United we stand for Liberty and
Peace."
The other night at Tampa, when
' every one was at dinner in the large
hottl which serves as the arm" head
, quarters, the band played a selection
of European national airs, finishing
with "God Save the Queen." The
British military attache, being in uni
| form, stood at the salute, whereupon
the senior American general present
rose and said: "Gentlemen, fill your
glasses! To Britain, our only friend!"
i And the toast was drunk with enthu
j siasm. Good will follows the private
individual in unexpected ways. I was
; writing a dispatch in the telegraph of
; fice at Washington when a stranger
j came up and said: "You are an Eng
lishman, are you not?" And on my
aiarmative reply he added: "Well, our
country wants an alliance with yours.
1 Come and take a drink."
European action since the outbreak
' of war has opened American eyes to
the fact that from only one nation in
the Old World is the United States cer
tain of receiving treatment inspired by
direct friendship. All informed Ameri
i cans know that if England had not
flatly refused her co-operation there
i would have been a joint demand at
'> Washington that the war be localized,
' and of this they are duly appreciative.
â  From press ai.d pulpit has come a
unanimous voice in support of closer
relations. - '
The President does not fail, when oc
casion offers, to express most cordial
sentiment and warm recognition of
England's friendly attitude. Senator
Lodge, one of our bitterest critics not
so long ago, now moves the immediate
payment of the Bering Sea indemnity.
Mr. Coudert, who was of opinion, not
three years ago, that Great Britain was
about to bi made to pay the penalty
of her misdeeds all over the world, now
declares that "the same general scheme
of laws, based upon many common
ideas and traditions, naturally draws
a man would arouse the whole camp in
the throes of a nightmare, hunting
ghost horses through the woods of
dreamland. One of the party he found
one night towing his blanket around in
circles, thinking that he had the bell
mare.
To add to the plight of the party dis-
us closely together," and that America
"should cultivate .England's friendship
and by every honorable means secure
her countenance and good will."
There is, lin. lly a more striking piece
of evidence than any of the above. In
the past, whenever any question of
Anglo-American relations has come up
there has been an outburst of opposi
tion and ill will from the Irish in this
country. On the present occasion no
Irish voice has been heard. Even Mr.
Davitt's letter has only been noticed in
order to refute its statistics or to ex
press surprise that the Times should
publish it. I could not understand this
and I asked the best informed pubac
man in Washington for the explana
tion. "Exactly the same thing puzzled
me," he replied, "and I asked a promi
nent Irish agitator why they had
passed none of the usual resolutions.
'We have passed them Just the same,'
was his answer, 'but we can't get them
published.' " That is the explanation;
the people will not listen to denuncia
tions of England.
Two practical proofs of good will
have also been given. First, the Bering
Sea indemnity has been paid, with oniy
an unpleasant comment or two in the
House. Second, .an international com
mission has been provided to settle all
disputes between the United States and
Canada, including a modus vivendi for
the Alaskan boundary question, which
has become acute.
In view of all these evidences of sym
pathy and willingness to bury the
troublesome and perilous past it seems
natural enough to take one step
further. Suspicion is dead, friendship
Is proved, common views have become
evident, actual co-operation should fol
low. The moment is ripe for an Anglo-
American treaty of alliance. That is
what many well meaning people are
saying on both sides of the Atlantic.
Unhappily it would be difficult to fall
into a greater error.
This is a matter which calls for the
utmost frankness. Innumerable and
grave dangers lurk in any misunder
standing upon such a vital point.
Therefore the only wise and safe course
is to say straight out that there is no
more chance of a treaty of alliance be
tween England and America than of an
invasion from Mars. It is pleasant to
talk of such a thing, or to express
amiable and mutually complimentary
opinions about it, but between this and
a formal, signed, sealed and delivered
compact there yawns a gulf not to be
bridged. It is certain that if either
nation wore in imminent peril the other
would come to its rescue. This is a cer
tainty for which both nations may be

sen -ion broke out, and the argonauts
with the exception of Sir Arthur quar
reled fiercely among themselves, call
ing: each other names on the trails and
fighting over the washing up of dishes
and other camp duties.
As the party went north they left
behind them the alluring uplands of
dry, full pine and sweet, dry grass, and
the forest became more dense upon
them with every drive. The bright
desert rllmate of the south gave place
to deluge after deluge and long-drawn
clays of steady rain. The mosquitoes,
black flies and horse files piled torment
on misery; the trail had become a
series of muck holes, walled in by im
penetrable bush: packs were bucked off
in the jungle, provisions were saturat
ed and ruined, bedding and clothes
soaked, until at last even Sir Arthur's
profoundly thankful.
Moreover, there need be no doubt
that if hostile action were taken by
any Continental nation against Amer
ica â by no means an unlikely contin
gency, both in view of the Philippine
problem and the recent utterances of
the German and Austrian Foreign Min
istersâthe effect would be to draw
tight the potential bonds of union be
tween the two countries. But to
imagine that at the present time, or In
the immediate future, there can be an
actual, formal treaty between us is to
show oneself ignorant of the controll
ing facts of the situation. For my
own part I am convinced that the peo
ple who speak English will some day
be bound together by the closest ties
against the peoples speaking other
tongues, and that he who strikes one
will have to be prepared for the blows
of both; but short of unforeseen and
unlikely events, this desired consum
mation will remain for many a year
upon tho knees of the gods.
The only ground for surprise Is that
such an obvious fact is not more gen
erally recognized. It has been the pol
icy of England to avoid an alliance; in
America the mere possibility of such a
course has never even been considered.
The American people, again, have not
yet learned the elementary conditions
upon which great nations pool their is
sues. It was actually thought in this
country that Mr. Chamberlain's speech
about the desirability of an alliance
with the United States meant that he
wanted the United States army and
navy to help England to fight France
over West Africa! Nobody pointed out
that either country might fight a score
of wars, even though the most formal
alliance existed, without the other be
ing involved. Nobody seemed to know
that alliances are made only for specific
objects or to ward off definite dangers,
and that a nation takes good care that
such objects are in the line of its own
interests and such dangers those that
may well threaten itself. This mis
conception, however, goes to show how
far opinion here is from readiness for
any tie more formal than mere good
will.
Again, just now the administration
has to bear in mind the possibility of
strained relations, if not actual rup
ture, with one or another of the Con
tinental powers. Is it likely that under
such circumstances American states
men would take a course which would
instantly precipitate the hostility -of
every power In Europe except Eng

pro.verb.lal good nature gave way under
thfe strain. . 1 . . , . . '.
Seventy miles north of Quesnelle, and
still hundreds of miles from the golden
Klondike, the party encountered the
forest which provedÂ«Â«o fatal. to poor Sir
Arthur. This forest is unbroken from
the Canadian settlements to the barren
grounds, fully a thousand miles; from
Bering Sea to the Atlantic nearly 5000.
It is a forest as big as Europe, half of
it unexplored, mainly dense jungle over
monotonous rolling ground, without
landmarks and nearly devoid of
natural food. Its depths cannot be
penetrated except on foot.
Camp was struck at the edge of this
land?
Finally, has the fate of the arbitra
tion treaty been so quickly forgotten?
That was infinitely easier to accom
plish than an alliance, and much great
er forces were arrayed on its side than
an alliance could command, but it was
hopelessly defeated. Where the little
coul"d not be accomplished, what chance
is there for the great? No, the sooner
everybody interested realizes that an
Anglo-American alliance is not to-day
within the sphere of practical politics
the better for us all.
This is not a counsel of despair â far
from it. The astounding change of
American sentiment toward England,
the development of sympathetic under
standing, the removal of obstacles to
cordial co-operation, these constitute
in themselves a magnificent triumph.
Surely we should rejoice that never be
fore have the two people stood so close
together, so united in aim, so allied by
affection. Moreover, the Canadian
commission marks an enormous ad
vance. Ninety-nine hundredths of our
disputes have had reference to Canada.
These are now all to be settled, and
probably some scheme of arbitration
will be devised to deal promptly and
amicably with any others that may
arise. This is a long step toward alli
ance, for it is the removal of many and
great obstacles from the path.
Lastly, now that America Is distinct
ly committed to a world policy, her
sphere will overlap our own, and thus
the necessity of combined action fre
quently arise. With her flag on the
Philippines, and the open door in
China, as important for her as for us, a
joint line of action will be inevitable.
She will not close her hew possessions
by a prohibitive tariff, for that would
be to stultify herself In her demand
that other countries shall not close
China against herself. In every direc
tion, in fact, the two people must per
force tend to move toward identical
ends. But the possible and the desir
able will only be postponed by any sen
timental and ill advised attempts to
bring about the impossible.
One word of warning cannot be
avoided at this point. The American
people believe that the British people
are eagerly seeking an alliance with
them. I take it this is not so, and the
impression is unfortunate. We are in
deed-ready to welcome such an alliance
when they are ready to form it. But
the greatest power in the world, iso
lated by her own free will and because
of her very strength, wooed in vain for
forest by the party -and the pack ani
mals were turned loose. In the morn
ing it was discovered that several of
the animals had strayed away, and
several of the men started out to
search for them.
The rest of the story is b</st told in
Pocock's own words:
"Sir Arthur was still in camp after
the rest had Wt. Indeed, I did not ex
pect him to take part in the search, be
cause he ha.d always shown a curious
inaptitude for brush work,' getting puz
zled and lost very easily. \ Isature In
tended him for the sea and his tastes
always led him afloat or "shooting or
mining, in which he was keenly inter
generations by every nation in Europe,
that can give more.than she gets, is not
suing for an alliance with any
body, not even with those ot her own
blood and speech.
The mind of England, I believe, is
made up; she can afford to await the
time when America sees her own inter
est, too, in closer union, and holds out
her hand. Till that time comes Eng
land would lose and not gain by stand
ing with outstretched arms on the verge
of the Atlantic. To make herself strong
on land and sea is her best course to
secure at least that guarantee of peace
and liberty and Anglo-Saxon civiliza
tion forever which would come from
the union of the might of those who
speak the sacred mother tongue and in
herit the great traditions of the sea.
I have profound pleasure in being
able to give to the world, in this con
nection, an unpublished document of
unique interest in the shape of a letter
written by Mr. Gladstone at the mo
ment of the greatest triumph of his
career, one phrase of which at least
deserves immortality. The place and
date speak for themselves. It was ad
dressed to his American publishers,
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, to
whose courtesy I am indebted for it. It
deals with Anglo-American relations,
and runs as follows:
Dalmeny Park, Edinburgh,
March 17, 1880.
Bear Sirs: I beg leave to acknowl
edge the receipt of your obliging
draft for sixty-seven pounds 18-2.
Such lucre as proceeds from''labor
of the brain I always esteem the
least filthy of that which conies into
my hands.
And again I have a further pleas
ure in becoming, in however humble
a degree, a vehicle of English
thought to the American mind.
The union between the countries
is close, and is likely to grow still
closer. Honor to all those who seek
to corroborate the bond! I am, deai
sirs, faithfully yours,
W. E. GLADSTONE.
The dictionary gives such a use of i
"corroborate" as "obsolescent," but It
is, of course, etymologically precise,
and what a splendid phrase! That !
should be in future the motto of the
Anglo-American people â "Corroborate
the bond!"

I ested. This mortiing, however, after
he had arranged his saddle and gear
for the day's march he lit his pipe and
talked briskly out of camp, before
even taking breakfast, evidently in
tending to join in the horse hunting,
as he had remarked earlier that nobody
had looked up the valley.
"He was never afterward seen. A
search party was organized that even
ing, great fires were lighted on the
hills, and guns were fired to if possible
attract the attention of the lost noble
man. All day the woods rang for miles
with gunshots and calls, and night
after night the searchers returned dis
pirited and hopeless to the camp. On
the sixth day after Sir Arthur's disap
pearance a band of w-andering Indians
was engaged to trace him, if possible.
"That day they found his tracks,
here a rotten log crushed in, there a
branch torn down to keep off the flies,
marks of a bewildered man wandering
in circles. Then the tracks struck off
guided by the sun northeast, about in
the one direction which would lead to
neither trail nor river, the one possible
course which could lead to no earthly
succor. A strong man. he had been
walking steadily, showing no signs of
madness on that first day of his
straying.
"Then at the end of fifteen miles or
so was the trampled place where he
had slept against a tree, heel marks
sunk in the moss.and without a fire. We
knew already that he had neither
weapon ncr compass. Now we know
that he was without matches and
could make no smoke to drive away
the terrible flies. -A man may fight
them through the long hot night, and
all the blazing day, but the hands
must grow weary at last, and the
swarms will settle. Then comes blind
ness.
"On the eighth morning of the search
the Indians returned discouraged and
would search no more. They had seen
the marks of coyotes following the
lost man's tracks. They had heard a
black bear and smelt a grizzly, but
there were no signs of the digging up
of herbs or scraping of bark for food.
But the signs led over vast reaches of
deadfall to a creek, and beyond there
was nothing.
"On the ninth morning I had to pro
nounce sentence of death; to say the
words which brought the search to an
end.
"We could only suppose that blinded
by the flies and mad, the dying man
hid himself away from any rescue."
Sir Arthur Curtis was 41 years of
age, a strong and healthy man. He
leaves a widow and a son aged 9. His
baronetcy descended from a distin
guished naval officer knighted for his
valor in saving the lives of drowning
Spaniards after the great bombard
ment of Gibraltar.
Roger Pocock left to-day for the
coast. He will return to England to
give the relatives of the deceased bar
onet the particulars of his tragic death.

A Frenchman went to an American,
says the Bachelor of Arts, and said to
him, "What does a polar bear do?"
The American answered, "What does
a polar bear do? I don't know. Why,
he sits on the ice." "Sits on zee ice?"
"Yes," said the American, "there is
nothing else to sit on." "Veil, vat he
do, too?" "What does he also do?
Why, he eats fish." "Eats fish; sits on
zee ice and eats fish? Then I not ac

LIKE A SLEEPING BEAUTY SY\E LIES DAY AFTER DAY, MONTH AFTER MONTH, GIVING NO SIGNS OF AWAKENING.
The strongest shock cf electricity has apparently no more effect upon her than the gentle touch of a kindly hand. Part of the time her eyes stare into vacancy, unseeing,
unknowing. Only during a short interval in the night does this persistent staring at nothing, into nothing, cease; the eyelashes then rest on the cheeks, until suddenly, without any
customary signs of awakening, they rise again and the eyes once more stare into nothing. "Her limbs remain in any position in which they are placed; once she moved just a little and
once she opened and shut her mouth. Her friends regarded this as hopeful, but the favorable signs did not continue. She is as incapable of motion as she is of action. When liquids
are placed in her mouth she swallows them. Doctors and scientists have exhausted every remedy and plan to awaken her from this strange sleep. A professional nurse watches beside
her waiting for some sign of consciousness.

phy hurried to the house, a doctor was
gent for and everybody who learned of
the disaster to this young girl waited
anxiously to hear of her resuscitation.
The doctor, a well-known physician
in the neighborhood, worked over her
for hours without the slightest resuit
and at last a consultation was decided
upon. Every remedy known to have
availed in similar cases was tried, but
tried in vain. In the days that followed
other prominent doctors examined this
unusual case and gave their best ef
forts for her relief. But there was not
the slightest improvement. Blistering,
electricity, white heat, ice bandages on
the spine, everything known to science
was tried in turn, and still the patient
lay like one of the' seven sleepers of
Ephesus, oblivious and inert.
The strongest shock of electricity had
no more effect than the gentlest touch
of her lover's hand. Her eyes stared
into vacancy, unseeing, unknowing. It

that her eyes remained wide open dur

the night did this persistent staring at
nothing, into nothing, cease; the eye- ;
lashes then rented on the cheeks until
suddenly, without movement, sigh,
yawn, or any of the customary signs |
of awakening they were raised once i
again and the eyes resumed their ab
sent, unthinking gaze.
Her legs and arms remained in any
position in which they were placed;
once or twice she moved her legs just
a little, and once she opened and shut
her mouth, as though thirsty, and they ;
gave her water. All this was considered
hopeful, but these favorable signs did
not continue.
She was incapable of motion as she
was of all action, even the mechanical
performance of chewing and swallow
ing food; yet when a spoonful of ice
cream was put in her mouth she swal
lowed it us though the cold was grate
ful. A professional nurse watched her
by day and another waited anxlously
for favorable sign or symptom by
night.
But still the patient lay supine and

and more serious. Almost as suddenly
as that other lovely maiden known to
us all from childhood she had dropped
into slumber uut this was a slumber
from which the prince could not arouse
her, although many times a day he
came to strive in every way for her re
lease.
Hypnotism produced no effect; it
â¢ could not make her sleep any the
deeper; it could not induce tin; tireless

was powerless. "Christian Science gave
all the force of its intangible aid. but

She grew a little thinner, they cut off

And the doctors declared that she
was now suffering from that most baf
fling of all diseases â hysteria. An
agreement as to the cause did not mean
a remedy in effect, however, and the
sleeping beauty softly slumbered her
life away and could not be made happy
by the constant visits of her lover, nor
sorrowful at the distress centerea about
her.
And at last it was determined to try

considered one of the handsomest
among all her companions; l^ter when
she made her debut she received much
attention. Her photograph appeared
in Vogue's series of fair women of
America, and as her beauty was that
of regular features as well as exquisite
coloring her San Francisco friends and
admirers took much pride in this port
rait of California's daughter.
Some four years ago her engagement
was announced to Mr. James Dunphy,
a wealthy young fellow, about whom
hovered an atmosphere of mystery and
pathos, calculated to inspire interest in
many a girlish heart. Mr. Dunphy

was divorced and there were rumors
of an unhappy experience which added
an element of interest to his good
looks, and often proved an incentive to
make him forget the sorrows of his
life.
Congratulations were showered upon
the young couple and many a remark
was heard regarding their adaptability
when they were seen together, for they
were a handsome pair. Miss Wilbur's
blonde hair, blue eyes and fair skin
were a decided contrast to her dark
fiance, and as the young man was rich
besides, and both were blessed with
youth and health, the prospective un-
I ion was smiled upon and considered a
! good match.
After a few months the wedding day
was decided upon and the Invitations
' were issued. The prospective bride was
popular and well known; she had been
a pupil at a fashionable private school
âfor it was not until lately that re
verses of fortune had overtaken her
mother â and she had many friends
among the society girls. The gro#m
was also widely known and much in
terest was felt in the welfare of the
young couple.
But shortly before the wedding day
arrived notices of postponement were
sent to the invited guests and the cause
of the delay was soon made known to
all. Mr. Dunphy was a Catholic, and
being a divorced man, he could not
marry without a dispensation from the
Pope, particularly as his former wife
had been of the same faith.
The expected papal exemption, it was
stated, had failed to come. This re
port vms widely circulated and much
sympathy was expressed for this case
of true love that was carrying out the
old adage. Then there were rumors
of disinheritance for the groom in case
of his marriage, because of parental
religious scruples alone, and the wed
ding was again postponed; and still
again. And the years passed.
And then, one morning, it was too
late for the Pope's dispensation, too
late to snap one's fingers at parental
scruples, too late to weigh love against
calculation, with Prudence to hold the
scales:

CUBAN MEMENTOES.
KEY WEST, Fla.. July 2. 1898.â
Major Lauriano Prado. just back from
an adventurous trip in Cuba, was
showing his silver-handled machete to
a reporter in a Cuban shop in this city
the other day. The reporter asked him
if it had ever killed anybody, and he
answered: "No." Thereupon the pro
prietor of the shop said: "I'll show you
a machete that has killed a man." He
went into a rear room and reappeared
directly with a machete evidently made
at the same factory as Prado's. He
held the blade up to the light. There
was a dark stain on the steel for some
twelve inches about the middle of the
machete. "That is the blood of a Span
ish captain," the proprietor said,
proudly.
Cuban war relics are in great demand
just now, and if the Cubans were less
conscientious they could do a big busi
ness in selling machetes used by Maceo,
buttons from the uniforms of Gomez,
spurs worn by Garcia, and so on. The
Cubans have been shown the way how

TOUR FINGER PRINTS
DID you ever examine the palm
of your hand or the bulbs of
your fingers through a magnify
ing glass? If so, you must have
been impressed by the rough
ness of the skin caused by the
great number of little ridges running
from side to side of the fingers and
curving here and there so as to cover
the entire surface. These small ridges
cover the entire surface of the palm
and run transversely across the palm
ar surface of the fingers, except on the
bulb of the finger. Here the ridges
arch over the linger tip, leaving a
space which is filled by other ridges,
occurring in patterns of such complex
ity that, as Mark Twain makes Pud
d'nhead say, there are no two in the
world alike.
It is commonly believed that the Chi

these patterns some 2000 years ago as
a means of establishing personal
identity, but there is no evidence to
support this tradition. The earliest
known "finger prints" are marks of
finger nails on Assyrian pottery. In
the British Museum is an Assyrian
brick bearing the inscription, "Nail
mark of Habu-sum-usur, the seller of
the field (used), like his seal."
Finger prints were employed in an
other and ingenious way by an officer
of the United States Geological Sur
vey in 1882. The men were paid by
orders on the camp sutler, and to
guard against forgery the officer
wrote the amount of the order across
a print made by his own finger, the
print in this case serving much the
same purpose as the line work so of
ten seen on bank checks and drafts on
which the figures representing the
amount of the draft are written.
The first extensive study of the pat

bulbs of the fingers appears to have
been made in 1823 by De Purkinje at
the University of Breslau, and in IS6S

they were first used extensively as a
means of identification by Sir W. Her
schel, who was at that time "collector"
in the Hooghly district of India. Sir
William experienced great difficulty in
distinguishing one brown skinned from
another, the color of hair, eyes and
complexion being very uniform in this
race, and he found them to be most ac
complished liars. Much of the litiga
tion brought before him involved the
title to land, and the litigants, being
unable to write, personal identification
was important. He adopted the plan
of having the finger prints of the con
tracting parties impressed on all
deeds, conveyances, etc. This was done
at first merely to impress the minds jf
the parties with the solemnity of thÂ°
proceeding, but it was noticed that no
two of the prints were alike, and this
individuality proved a reliable and cer
tain means of identification.
These minute ridges owe their chief
significance to the persistent individu
ality of the patterns which they form.
Observation has demonstrated that,
though these ridges make their appear
ance some time before birth, and per
sist long after the death of the individ
uals, their numbers and relative posi
tion remain unchanged. Of course, the
general outline of the pattern they
form is altered by the growth of the
finger, but no new ridges are formed,
and none are destroyed, except by acci
dental injuries, and in these cases scars
are left to tell the story.
The evidence of the unchangeability
of the pattern of the finger prints haa
been collected by Sir Francis Galton.
In 1892 he reported comparisons of fif
teen persons, taken at intervals aa
great as thirty years â and from these
cases he was led to conclude that the
pattern never varied on the same fin
ger. Since then Sir W. Herschel had
eight of the Hindoos, whose prints he
had taken in IS7B, looked up, and the
prints from the same fingers again
taken. There was found to be an ex
act correspondence in every instance of
prints taken from the same fltoger.
When it is remembered that these
prints were made on cheap native pa
per, by native officials, and with an
ink not entirely suited for the purpose,
and that the identity of the prints was
easily established, it is readily seen

gave them shot for shot, doggedly determined to prevent their escape.
The caurtt&s ot her commander in the face of such tremendous odds was
finally rewarded. The terrible fire of the destroyers slackened, and a cheer
went up from the Gloucester as it was seen that they were on fire.
Both turned their noses to the shore and crowded on steam. They had

It is true that I am the oldest man in

I never saw trouble that I felt I had to

times by night, from one backwoods
town to another, with a colored man

When a young man asks how he can
start, all I can say is, begin in a small
way. Experience and reputation, in your
line, are absolutely necessary to secure
employment by a good house at good
money. Until you have these try for
them, as a retail salesman, anywhere.
Unknown quantities are not wanted In

There are certain kinds of trade, such
as the shoe, the hat and the clothing,
which do nearly all their business by
means of traveling salesmen. And they
do nearly all of it in four or five months

der way. Mr. J. Beaver-Webb of New
York designed her and superintended
her construction and in a general way
he always hud her in charge. She was
launched in April, IS9I, from the yard
of Messrs. Xeafie & Levy of Philadel
phia, her builders. On the Sound and
and Eastern waters she reeled off thou
sands of knots without mishap or In
convenient detention to owner or
guests. That was the mark intended
in her construction and it was easily
reached. Her hull is stanchness itself
and her engines and boilers are of the
most approved styles.
One order went with her contract.
From her keel up she should be of the
b"st, and care was taken that there
should be no departure from that man
datory requirement. And during his
ownership Commodore Morgan let it be
understood that the yacht should al
ways be in the best of condition, and
this wish was never lost sight of. Twice
a year she was overhauled in hull and
machinery â at her laying u^> in the fall
and going into commission every
spring:. Thus she was n^ver a disap
pointment, but a craft that was always
satisfactory, always a pleasure to use
and always a pleasure to see. Her
graceful model was known in ,all our
yachting waters. Her spick and span
appearance was a subject of pleasant
comment by yachtsmen, and landlub
bers, too, grew enthusiastic when the
Corsair was pointed out.
The Corsair is 241 feet 6 Inches over
all. 204 feet on water line, 27 feet 2
inches beam. 16 feet "> Inches deep and
13 feet draught. Her engines are of
the triple expansion type, with cylin
ders 21 inches, 33 inches and r>4 inches
in diameter, by 30 inches stroke of pis
ton, and her boilers are of the old re
liable Scotch return tubular descrip
tion.
The dimensions given allow plenty of
deck room and ample accommodations
below. It was the delight of visitors
to stand well forward and look aft. The
graceful sweep of her broad deck re
sembled that of an up-to-date liner. At
night, with hundreds of electric lights
alow and aloft, this view was partic
ularly charming. From forecastle to
on here to buy for the fall.
While It is true that it is the advance
business that pays, it is also true that
there isn't any man who can make
what I call a salary unless he sells
goods in New York as well as on the
road. While merchants came to New
York twenty years ago more than
they do now, it is still true that they
continue to come on now at certain
times. It is New York, '.hen, that the
traveling salesman who has been in
their stores, and mixed with them,
knows what they want and how to sell
to them. And it is here above all that
the value of the traveling salesman to
his parent house is proven, above all
mercantile agency reports.
The best customer last year may not
be so good this year; discounts may
have fallen off. ill health hurt his busi
ness; he may have quarreled by letter
with the home house. Now. the home
house not only wants to weed out un-
desirable customers, but to replace
them with good ones. It is the expe
rienced traveling salesman who alone
can know not only when but where to
go. 'If I tell a Southwestern merchant
In July, in New York, that I will be in
his place on December 1, .and I have al
ways "toted fair" with him. he'll wait
to buy my line of goods until he sees
my samples. I have traveled 2000 miles
in one week, and 600 miles in another
week and made from five to seven
towns in each. On the 26th day of last
November I was in Dallas, on the 2Sth
in Waco, on the 29th in Oalveston, on
December 1 in Houston, and on Decem
ber 2 in Fort Worth. That would meas
ure only about 700 miles over the State,
but it was 1500 the way I went.
Expenses? Expenses don't cut any
figure. You must get the business, no
matter what it costs. Your expenses
may be $60 one week and $160 the next.
To meet them you draw drafts on the
parent house â not on a bank. I never
knew a reputable house to refuse to
pay a draft drawn by a reputable
traveling man. And for integrity,
traveling men are away above the
average.
The old timer who drank hard and
told stories is no longer "in it." The
merchant of to-day knows when he is
"getting a run for his money." It
doesn't do any harm to "joll;-" 'him a
bit; naturally, you wouldn't take your
troubles to him. Tact and truthfulness
generally win. And sometimes you tell
him a story you have heard.
Experienced men, who have their
health, are never out of a Job. Such a
one, who travels with a special line of
goods for a big house, may mtike $12,000
or $15,000 a year in commissions. Many
make from $GOOO to $8000. A good house
salesman in a big house may sell in the
market (that is, in uew York City, of
course) a million dollars' worth of gen
eral dry goods in a year. But he
couldn't possibly go out on the road
with-general samples and sell half that
amount in a year. Yet a good traveling
I salesman with a special line of dry
: goods might sell on the road a million
: dollars' worth of his specialty. So the
cost to general houses is less than to
special lines to sell their goods, and the
| general salesmen get paid less.
Concentration is what pays the house
|as well as its travelers. Know ;-our
; market, know your customers and
â  know your special line of goods. Every
! successful road salesman has offers to
take out side lines. But I have always
refused; and it's better to have one
thing to sell and to sell that and noth
ing else. In all my twenty years on the
road I have never been insulted, never
had a personal altercation.

The New Nicaragua Canal.
Mr. Flint is one of the most influential merchants engaged in the South American trade. His busi
ness ventures roll up into the millions annually. For years he has made a careful study of the needs of the
southern republics and the benefits to be obtained from the proposed canal.
THIS war is going to open up trade
opportunities for the United
States in the southern half of this
hemisphere. I believe it will result
in a quickening of business all
through this country, in the building
of the Nicaragua canal and in the de
velopment of the American merchant
marineâ all desirable things from a
meeantile viewpoint.
I have never found any feeling there
against this country. At least not
among the Spanish-Americans. There
are, of course, some Spaniards in those
countries, recently from Spain, who
have a natural feeling of affection for
the mother country. In Spanish colo
nies like those in the Argentine Repub
lic, there is of course a feeling against
us; but even that does not prevent us
doing business with them. We have
orders all the time from Spanish corre
spondents. But the Spanish-American
people are with us in this conflict. I
know that from the letters of advice
which I receive all the time. When this
war is over we are going to be in a
better condition to do business with
the Latin-American republics, because
the war is going to teach them to have
a greater respect for us.
I believe this will be the last war we
will fight for perhaps a half century,
for the reason v that we shall teach the
world to hold us in greater respect and
not meddle with us.
The new business boom with the
South Americans will probably come in
all lines. I cannot think of anything
which we could sell to them that we do
not send there now. Every means has
been used to quicken our trade with
South America. We have sent a cata
logue containing pictures of all kinds
of machinery to every engineer in the
Latin-American countries. Every one
of them kr.ows just what machinery is
made in America and its cost. We are
getting out now a new edition of this
book. There are only a few things
which can be done to increase our trade
in the south. One of them is to estab
lish an international American bank.
That project is now in the hands of
Congress. I suggested it when I was
a delegate to the Pan-American Con
after staterooms there were comfort,
ample accommodations and luxury,
which thousands of guests may attest.
And among the latter have been many
prominent people, a few now recalled
being Lord Russell of Killowen; Joseph
Chamberlain, Secretary of the Colo
nies; John G. Carlisle, former Secre
tary of the United States Treasury;
Benjamin F. Tracy and William C.
Whitney, former Secretaries of the
Navy; the Bishops of New York, Al
bany, Connecticut, Rhode Island and
Minnesota; Admiral F. M. Bunce, U.
S. N.; William Rockefeller, August
Belmont and Charles Lanler.
Commodore Morgan regarded the
Corsair as a model cruiser. He was
so well pleased with her that his new
yacht, now under construction, will
simply be another Corsair, somewhat
enlarged, in fact, as well as in name,
and is from the hands of the same de
signer.
It has been said that since the story
of the Corsair's (Gloucester's) achieve
ment off Santiago Commodore Morgan
has been asked to say something about
his late yacht. "The yacht has spoken
for herself," he answered, "and I can
not add anything." That is and al
ways was true. Whether on the Round,
far to the eastward, down the bay or
up the quiet Hudson, the Corsair as
a pleasure vessel always spoke for her
self, and recently in the Caribbean, do
ing Uncle Sam's bidding, she has in
deed spoken for herself in a way that
the echoes have rolled around the globe.
Commodore Morgan knows that. Since

The bank proposes to give the people
of South and Central America a chance
to do their financial business through
this country. Just now it is all done in
London. This bank would have a Lon
don branch, but its head would be here
and its tail in England instead of its
tail being in New York, as is now the
case.
Such a bank could handle a business
with a volume of about $250,000,000 a
year. That is the amount of our busi
ness with those countries now. London
now handles this and about $300,000,000
more. We are the largest buyers of
South American goods in the world.
In addition to this international bank
we need reciprocity with the countries
of South and Central America, and we
need encouragement for our shipping
interests. But about tho letter we need
not say anything until the war is over.
Just now our lack of a merchant ma
rine is one of our great safeguards. We
have so little that Spain can seise. My
firm is running mopt of its ships under
a foreign flag, and we are making more
British charters all the time.
I share the confidence of most public
men that one outcome of the war will
be the building of the Nicaragua canal.
I have always been in favor of the
canal. I was the representative of the
president of Nicaragua when the con
cession was made. But I have never
taken an interest in the companies or
ganized for the building of the canal
because they were not of the right kind.
Where they should have been composed
of substantial men throughout, they
contained a few substantial men and a
great many who were not.
I think the present company will not
be able to complete the canal. What
ought to be done is to get the bigi^st
contractors in this country to examine
the work and say for what they will
undertake to complete it. When you
have this substantial foundation, a
company should be organized, composed
of responsible men throughout, which
will undertake to furnish the money
for the work. The development of
South American trade offers plenty of
opportunities for investment. I put
$100,000 into a business enterprise in one
of those countries last year. I have
received $170,000 In cash from that in
vestment and I have $50,000 coming to
me yet in deferred payments. There
are splendid opportunities for capital

Lieutenant Commander Wainwright
did his part in laying low the Pluton
and Furor there have been sweeping
under the sea and over the land to the
commodore scores of messages congrat
ulating him upon the efficiency of the
yacht he turned over to the Govern
ment.
When Mr. A. F. Yarrow, the eminent
English engineer, was in New York
last fall he inspected the Corsair and
other of Mr. Beaver-Webb's boats, and
remarked that for the service intended
they could easily be made 30 per cent
less in weight and be thoroughly effi
cient, and then, if the weight thus
saved were added in power, the yacht
would be the faster for the change.
Mr. Webb's reply was that in his opin
ion they were best as constructed, and
the work of the Corsair since she has
been owned by the Government has
shown that he is correct.
The last survey of the Corsair was
made in April, 1594. by the New York
Standard Association, when she was
classed "Al, sixteen years," and no
doubt she is good for every day of the
time with any kind of luck attending
her. That she may hold her own for
this period and much longer, all sail
ors, soldiers, yachtsmen and other good
citizens of the republic will heartily
wish.

at Cornell is valued at $475,000; at "Wil

It is perfectly safe to deal with these
i Governments. In my long experience
I have known only one case where a
Government deliberately went back on
its agreement and I would not care
to be quoted as to that.
You can deal directly in a, business
like way with the Governments them-
BelvfeS. There are opportunities now
for street railway building, gas com
panies, electric light companies, water
works.
A young man without capital has not
much chance anywhere. But I should
pay that a young man without money
who wanted to succeed would have to
associate himself with men who have
capital. As to starting: out without a
specialty in South and Central Ameri
ca without capital, I should say that
a young man's chances were no better
there than they would be if he landed
in any city of the United States with
out money. If he has a mechanical
trade, though, the chances in his favor
of success are good. A young man who
has a knowledge of engineering will
i succeed down there. I should say it
I was a good place for a young man too,
because the people welcome the Anglo-
Saxon. I have known many cases of
young Americans who have marred
into very rich families there. They
encourage these alliances because they
see that It brings good resultsâ it im
proves the breed.
The United States will never exerds*
a form of sovereignty over the Latia-
American countries.
I should think it very foolish to con
sider such a thing. 'We want close re
lations with the Spanish-American peo
ple, but they are quite capable of gorÂ«
erring themselves.
Their revolutions have been very
much exaggerated. There is not a dis
turbance of any kind south of the Rio
Oirande to-day. The belief that the
southern people are in a constant state
of insurrection is due to ignorance.
Ohiie had no revolution for fifty years;
neither did Brazil. Our own record is
no better than that. And in our Civil
War we shed more blood than has been
spilled in all the revolutions in Central
and South America. We forget the rev
olution at home. A South American
revolution is a very easy thing to man
ufacture. When some of the newspa
pers lack a sensation the first thing
they think of is a South American rev
olution. As a fact, many of the revo
lutions you read about never occurred.

OF all the questions which are being put forward
by. advanced thinkers for general consideration
and discussion that which embodies severe crit
icism of the methods of civilization in regard
to the treatment of the incurably sick is most
vitally interesting.
At present the highest skill of physicians and
trained nurses, and the most self-abnegatory care of
kindred and friends are exerted to prolong life, how
ever little of blessing the life so prolonged may be to
the sufferer himself, to his family, or to the world at
large. There are not a few persons, however, who
stand ready to pioneer a movement in a different di
rection and these are by no means sensationalists or
seekers after personal notoriety, but individuals who
have arrived at their present convictions after long
and earnest study of the subject and the different
principles involved.
It Is their claim that mere life is not desirable, and
that when the body becomes simply a torture-chamber
the truest kindness would be to painlessly and speedily
Bet . the spirit free.
It is a curious manifestation of the tolerant spirit
of the age that such a theory should be boldly ad
vanced and seriously debated.
The following opinions on the subject were given
by men and women of different professions and beliefs
here In San Francisco.

Each year of scientific medical investigation is re
ducing the limit of the term incurable, so that the
question curable or incur
able is a very difficult one

M. D., st Luke's Hospital. readily afford just grounds
I for misunderstanding and
~ uncertainty, not only in
the minds of the laity, but in the conclusions of the
profession.
Further, the consent of the victim of the disease,
even his urgent prayer for relief from his sufferings,
could not be morally or legally considered as a reliable .
argument or a rational conclusion.
A diseased body would most certainly prohibit that
healthy and normal mentality which would admit of
the patient's being considered in a right mind, whether
his statement as to his wishes was the outcome of
devil-may-care indifference or the tremulous prostra
tion of invalidism.
But these apparently indisputable objections pre
sent comparatively little difficulty when contrasted
with a nobler and greater, namely, man's humanity
Not the bombastic pseudonym "humanitarianism " a
word so lovingly handled by a class of auto-inflated
misfits whose relationship to man and his wants bring
no more solace than does a hangman's rope and no
more cheer than the chilling beams of a December sun.
We are our. brother's keeper, not our brother's de
stroyer, and our duty is, at all stages of the tragedy
of life, to support, not to destroy; to maintain, not to
annihilate. â¢
To grant to any one the professional right to re
move life would be a grave error and a direct violation
of all laws divine and human so far given to us It

to alleviate the pangs of disease, to cover up its loath-

NEW YORK, July 9.-More coined
gold, by millions and millions of
dollars' worth, is packed away
tor safekeeping in New York
this summer than has ever been
gathered here before, probably more
than is at this time stored in any other
city on earth, excepting St. Petersburg
and Paris; certainly as much as the to
tal output of all the mines in the world
last year.
This may seem an exaggerated state
ment, in view of the fact that the gold
output of 1597 was the largest in his
tory, being equal to at least $203,000,000,
yet it is well within the truth, since the
gold coin holdings here now amount to
between $200,000,000 and $210,000,000, and
are probably nearer the larger than the
smaller figure. Moreoverâ and this
-nent is still more surprisingâ the
world's visible supply of gold, estimat
es by the officials of the New York as
say office, though now larger than ever
re, amounts only to a little more
tha " I ,000, both coined and un
i, BO that, accepting $200,000,000 as
the measure of New York's present
Kohl n.in storage, it is quite equal to
one-twenty-fifth part of all the precious
yellow metal in existence.
In addition to ihu vast sums repre
sented by the figures quoted there was
stored In tln> assay office on this day
about $55,000,000 worth of bar gold and
this added to the coin holding of $227 -
000,000 in the clearing house and the
pub-treasury swells the grossâ aside
from bank and private holdings â to
$282,000,000. Unquestionably there is
enough more gold in New York at this
time to raise the grand total to $300,
000,000, or one-third more than the
world's output in the year of greatest
production.
The presence at the nation's commer
cial center of so vast an accumula
tion of the world's standard money
metal, due to no government's efforts
at concentration, is unprecedented, and,
while it Is in one sense a source of
gratification, the situation Is not with

Cripples who look upon their misfortunes as Btock

themselves to the gaze of strangers while their sensi
tive natures shrink from the thought of pitying com
ment should have a pleasant home provided for them
out of the public moneys, where they could live se
cluded from all except those friends whom they wished
to meet.
While few men would care to express themselves
in favor of a law authorizing, even after rigid in
vestigation by a commission specially appointed, the
removal of a hopelessly ill human being, there are
very few men who would not prefer to have their own
sufferings shortened under such circumstances. It is
well to have the subject discussed, for In time we
shall become accustomed to the thought, and our
minds, through successive generations, will be pre
pared for the inevitable, for the time will surely come
when the secret wish of the individual will become
the law of the whole.

I cannot understand how any one can seriously put
forward such an idea in the present age of the world.
. To even suggest the de
sirability of legalizing
ROBERT A. McLEAN, M.D. murder seems to me dia-
metrically opposed to the
spirit of the time; it is
taking a great many steps backward from civilization
into savagery.
There are savages who kill their deformed or un
wished for children, desert their sick, and leave their
useless old men and women to perish from starvation,
but their example is not to be emulated.
Speaking from a strictly professional standpoint,
without regard to the religious, the ethical, or the
social aspect of the question, I will say briefly this:
The whole theory and practice of medicine are opposed
to any such idea. It is the aim of medical men to save
and prolong life under all circumstances. It is neither
our mission nor our privilege to separate the soul from
the body. It is not our business to decide whether or
ii" a patient would be "better off" if he were dead;
nor is it our business to listen to a patient's own de
sires or to consider whether or no his relatives and
friends would be happier relieved from the burden of
caring for him.
Our simple duty is the preservation of life and to
that end we are bound to direct all our energies. Once
the life Is in the human body it is our one aim to keep
it there, and no outside considerations could have the
slightest effect upon a physician worthy of the name.
To in any way lessen the sentiment as to the sacred
ness of human life would be productive of much evil.
If murder, under certain restrictions, were to be con
sidered right and necessary those restrictions would in
many cases be ignored and a haunting fear of enforced
dissolution would add to the sufferings of many a
sick bed.
While it is possible that the time may come when
the earth will be so thickly populated that some plan
to decrease its inhabitants may become necessary, that
time is so far in the future that it is not worth while
to discuss it. Our duty now is to care for the lame, the
halt, the blind and the suffering, and not to shirk our
responsibility in that direction by taking upon our
selves the far heavier responsibility of sending them
out of this world.
â¢ â¢ â¢
This question Is by no means a new one to me for
I have often debated in my mind concerning what
_ ought to be done in cases
| where a human being is so
JUDGE WILLIAM CRAIG- ill or so helpless as to be
a burden to himself and to
all around him.
My conclusion is that it is almost impossible to
decide as to the positive incurability of any disease,
since almost miraculous recoveries, after all hope
seemed gone, have been known to most of us. Phy
sicians of the highest standing are often astonished
at the recuperative powers of the human body, and
patients given over to death very frequently have a
new lease of life given them, to the surprise of their
medical attendants and hopeless relatives and friends.
Such being the case it would be quite impossible for
any commission, no matter how able and conscientious,
to judge always correctly of the physical condition
of sick or infirm persons. There would always be
room for a doubt as to their conclusions, and that
doubt would pave the way for serious complications.
Even if a sick person expresses the wish to die that
wish can be looked upon as nothing more than nature's
rebellion against pain. A man who has been thoroughly
healthy during his entire life often feels so dlscoura^-d
and alarmed by a transitory illness that he is lost to
reason. Should such a man, because he foolishly prays
for speedy death to end his sufferings of the moment,
be removed from the world because his "consent" has
been gained and his rc.atives would be "better off"
in the enjoyment of his life insurance than they are
while sitting up nights caring for himr

Instead of shrinking from the sight of the afflicted we
should do our best to help them bear their burdens
and should do all in our power to make them forget
their sorrows. It is the knowledge of and sympathy
with the sufferings of others that make us rise above
the natural plane of selfishness. Super-sensitiveness
is super-selfishness almost always, and if the sight of
a distorted or suffering body is repugnant to us we
should think how much worse it must be to be the
owner of it and endeavor in every way to help the
unfortunate person to bear his or her burden patiently.

I am a soldier and I have been in more than one
battle, but deliberate murder is something which I
could not countenance. The aim of an army is rather
to wound and thus remove from the field of battle,
than to kill outright. It is only under the most ag
gravated circumstances that a soldier will deliberately
shoot at a man to kill, and no one but a most cowardly
murderer would attempt to injure a man who was
unarmed and defenseless.
Supposing that a law were passed legalizing the

where is the respectable father or mother, or husband
or wife who would give their consent to such a pro
ceeding? Of course there are mercenary and hard
hearted persons .who would be only too glad to avail
themselves of the right to send troublesome charges
out of this life, but surely the small minority of such
individuals should have no weight in the discussion of
questions which affect the whole wona.
Even on the field of battle I should not consider a
man justified who would end a comrade's life to save
him from suffering. It Is hard to resist the frenzied
pleadings of an apparently mortally wounded man
when he begs you to shoot or bayonet him to end his
misery, but there is always a chance that he may be
picked up and carried to a hospital and made able to
hold his own in the battle of life even !f he can no
longer be a soldier, and that chance should be taken
every time.
The very idea of a "lethal chamber" must be re

No, I do not think that because a person is in

Thaosophiit our materialistic scientists
| may declare to the con
~ trary. Therefore any one
suffering from an incurable disease is experiencing the
effect of cause which he himself set in action either
in this or some former â probably the latter.
The effects of a cause cannot be avoided by either
man or God; but they may hi delayed or transmuted
to some other plane of action. Thus the Christian
Scientists and their congeners do . really . cure physical
ailments by transferring the field of enects to the
mental plane, and such cases are always followed by
mental disease, either in this or some future life. '
; Similarly the person who commits suicide to escape
suffering, or who ; is murdered by his doctor or his
friends by; the permission of the community, will not
escape one single pang; because the effects of the'
causes have not been permitted to wear out. He will
return to this earth, and nature, who never forgets
nor forgives, will: place him under such conditions
that the old unsatisfied causes will begin to run and
he will be, obliged to pay his debt to the last farthing.
This is a universe of order and justice,, not of
chaos and . injustice. Merited suffering cannot be
escaped- in any way, neither by vicarious atonement
nor by putting the sufferer "out of his misery," as the
Westerners often express it. Mercy demands, how
ever, that all unnecessary suffering be alleviated, and
this means all suffering except that whose cessation
can only be accomplished by the death of the body.
I would smooth the path to the grave by every means
known to medical . science, but I would not cut life
short by one single hour. Murder is unjustifiable upon
any hypothesis whether philosophic or sentimental.

judgment is poor. They think they are merciful in
making this suggestion, but they are mistaken. There

These are furnished by solid masonry

Manhattan Island's foundation. These
piers raise the great chest six feet six
inches from the main floor to the level
of a narrow platform reaching quite
round the apartment, but separated by
quite a space from the box Itself. By
this arrangement it is possible for the
watchmen who guard the treasure
night and day actually to walk under

nishes an absolute safeguard against
burglars working from the bottom by
means of a tunnel, and It would, of
course, be impossible under the circum

circumstances it Is impossible to touch

Valuable Rules for Professionals and Jlmateurs in Search
of Records or .Health.
BY CHAMPION "JIMMY" MICHAEL, the Welsh Wonder.
IX regard to training, the first thing
a man neeyds is a thorough, search
ing examination by a competent,
practical, up-to-date doctor. If he
says you're all right, then go ahead.
If you're under weight you must
build up. and the doctor will tell you
how to do it.
If you're an average man you'll be
carrying a little too much fat, your
muscles will be unequally developed,
your lungs won't have nearly the ca
pacity that they should have, and your
nerves will be unsteady as a result of
some sort of improper indulgence or
excess. The thing to do is to get on a
meat diet; cut off the sweets; cut down
the fruit and vegetablesâ l don't use
them at all, hut it may not be well for
you to change your diet too suddenly.
Then knock off coffee and tobacco, and
liquor, of course. A little good beer or
ale may not hurt you if you've been ac
customed to it and If you use it with
your meals.
For exercise don't confine yourself to
the bicycle, but take a varietyârun
ning, rope-skipping and the ordinary
llp-vit work for chert development.
While you're getting yourself into
Bhape do the same thing for your wheel.
It must run right, and it must fit the
rider. In the first matter, it Is surpris
ing haw little mo?t riders really know
about the right running <>f a wheel.
In regard to position on the wheel,
you must study your own physique. I
couldn't descrfbe my own position to
you as absolutely the right one. It
might not suit your build at all. A
good many young riders undoubtedly
in lure t!v?i'r development by copying
style from somebody whose physical
make-up and necessities are totally
different from theirs.

BiGGEST BICYCLE IN THE WORLD.
Probably the biggest bicycle ever built was first exhibited to the public
May 1, at the Sport Park Friedenau, near Berlin, Germany, by the in
ventor. Karl Jatho of Hanover. The roar wheel stands over nine feet high
and two Beats are provided, one at each side of the large wheel. The front
wheel Is of the ordinary bicycle pattern and by comparison the immense
size of the larger wheel becomes evident. The inventor, Jatho, has quite
a refutation as a wheelman and is probably the best amateur fancy rider
of Germany. Riding on his large wheel is not as difficult as it might ap
pear at a first glance, however. The center of gravity is placed some
what below the axle of the large wheel and therefore it is an easy matter
to keep the whe.-l going steadily. The wheel was brought into public view
for the first time in a rather Interesting manner. The inventor had JÂ»een
requested t" attend the cycle corso arranged for a special occasion and prom
ised to come with a startling feature. - When he did come with his sister
mounted on the novel wheel there was a general :urprise; even his most
intimate friends had no idea of the existence of the new conveyance, which
he bad built quietly in a shed at the rear of his dwelling. The wheel has
since been produced a few times at cycle festivals. It is not possible for
â upants of the bicycle to approach too near each other, for the big
wheel is constantly between them, and it is certainly more reliable than any
other chaperon in keeping the proper distance while riding.
kick them r-ff the cranks or to wear
holes In th-? soles of your shoes. In
other words, every 'â unre of power that
you use ought to go against the pedal
in the direction of its motion. In get
ting th<- power <m to your pedals there
nri> two elements â your weight and
your strength.
Tlk> first Is important, principally be
cause if you are putting your weight on
the pedals in the right way you are
probably in a proper position to exert
your strength.
The test is this: The true and correct
notion of bicycle riding is perfectly
natural. If you feel as if you were de
veloping a new kind of motion it means
that you are not a good rider. In
of what ill-informed writers
the subject and some care
less physicians have said. the
bicycle will not develop a new
human being. Watch a really
expert rider and see how natural his
leg action is. There is nothing cramp
ed or strained about it. When his
knees come up there is no awkward
ness or Jerking, and when the leg is
straight it doe? not seem to be strain
ing after the pedal.
I have said that the action of riding
a bicycle i? r.ot unnatural. That is
truf-. The only novelty is in the com
bination of different muscular exer
tions. Below the waist a bicycle rider
is running nnd climbing; that is, his
action is different from running on a
level. With the muscles of the groin
and abdomen he is dancing. With the
back and arms ho is lifting. When I
F-iy dancing, of course I refer to the
fiction of balancing. But this does not
mean, as some people very foolishly
have said, that a rider has to exert
any force to keep himself from falling
nvlr. The laws of nature attend to
that. A man on a moving bicycle will
no more fall over than a hoop will if
jou roll it across the room. The bal
ancing which he does is the balancing
of force and the maintenance of equi
librium between the upper part of his
body and the legs that are active on a
moving support. The work for the
muscles I have indicated is that of
maintaining a proper pose. It should
be done with small expenditure of
force, but well and carefully done.
An to the lifting, it is a hard matter
to speak of without an individual ex
ample. A man must make the best
use of his physique. But some points
are obvious. A rider can't get any
more power out of his grip on the bar
if it is to far out in front of him. You
can experiment In that matter by put
ting a chair on the floor in front of you
and lifting It at various distances. If
the distance is great it is a back-break
ing exercise. I see a good many riders
who are trying to break their backs by
reaching out too far. The distance
from the saddle to the grips is too
great for the rider's size.
There is another point. A good many
bars made for supposedly fast road rid
ers are too narrow. Pulling up on
them brings the shoulders together and
contracts the chest. It interferes with
breathing 1 .
If some of the scorchers who break
the law on the boulevard on their way
â  out of town or back again should see
: me come along on my wheel adjusted
, exactly as it is when I race, they would
| say that I was "not so warm." I don't
wear any skin off my nose by getting
it mixed up with the tire of my forward
j wheel. I sit fairly erect, though not
rigid, my body Inclined forward and my
back slightly bent but not humped. The
position, as I have said, would not look
"racy" to one of those fellows who
wants to burn dust with the casual
wayfarer on a public street when eight
miles an hour is the limit of the law,
and who thinks that that is racing.
: Yet I am sure that I get every pound
out of myself that is in me.
Many a man who never does breathe
properly could do so if he only would.
It is not necessary to open your mouth
! every time you feel like doing it â either
! for breath or conversation. Perhaps
the reader might find some help or com
fort in the toothpick habit, which I
have acquired.
To return to the subject, if you can't
: get air enough without opening your
mouth there may be something the
matter with your air passages. One of
the great benefits of the bicycle is that
it calls attention to such matters, and
leads to their remedy by proper medical
, attention. This at least is certain. No
! person can ride well who breathes un
evenly, gaspingly, or in any other way
than naturally, regularly and with the
: full depth of the lungs. By this I do
not mean that one should strain to fill
the lungs. I have known injury to re
sult from that kind of breathing.
Another thing that must be regular
and steady is the rider's nerve. Of
course, on the racing track every one
; would admit the importance of steady
nerves. They are no less important to
the rider who isn't on the track. In
every long run where a greater or less
j percentage of the wheelmen drop out,
I it is perfectly safe to say that half of
; them could have gone through all right
| if they hadn't got nervous.
Perhaps a man is afraid of the pace
maker, or he is dreading a certain long
up-hill stretch of road; or he's afraid
| that his wheel is not going to run just
: right, or that there'll be a strong head
wind. Now, persistently fearing any
one of those things is probably worse
than the thing itself. Don't worry; it
doesn't do any good, and it does a lot
of harm.
In the beginning I spoke of overexer
â  Won and tried to show that it is not
, what a person dees, but what he is,
! that counts. It is hardly necessary to
advise against overexertion. Every
j body knows that it Is bad. Some peo
! Pie, however, don't know when they are
overexerting themselves. They are
. afraid of what is unimportant, and not
j afraid of serious symptoms. There are
| a few general rules.
When your heart seems to be knock
ing against your ribs, stop.
When there is a faintnees and a
; crampy pain in the lower part of your
1 body rest.
j When there is a pain on each side of
: the small of your back, see the doctor.
When there are pains in your arms
I and legs every time you move them,
, and you're as stiff as a frozen cc-rpse,
take a good rub-down, a long night's
; rest and a nie* ride on your bicycle
i the next day.
In the matter of rubbing down, bl
j ryei c riders are more than careless.
I That very agreeable and necessary
treatment should not be enjoyed only
by professional riders; it ia good for
everybody.
Don't do the rubbing yourself If you
can get anybody else.
Don't have a companion of your late
; exertions rub you down in exchange
j for a similar service by you. You're
(both tired, and a tired" person is "no
good" in that capacity. There is a mag
netism in it that needs a fresh, vigor
ous person for Its proper development.
Always be rubbed down before your
skin gets dry and your muscles begin
to stiffen. Never expos*- your flesh
naked to the air after exercise and be
fore a good hard rub. It's a sure way
to get stiff, and though the stiffness
may seem to pass off once, twice a
hundred times, perhaps, it will finally
result in a condition that can't be got
rid of so easily.
There are two important matters in
; riding that I have been asked to crm
i siderâ hfll climbing and riding against
the wind. I don't pretend to be an ex
pert on either subject, but a few things
1 that I know about them may be worth
telling.
You cannot adjust a bicycle so that
It is jU3t right for riding on a level
road and for climbing a steep hill. If the
hill Is moderate, get a little more over

air, be extra steady and cool, avoid
spurts or any sort of hurried and vio
lent action, and so pedal away to the
top. On very steep hills your bar will
seem too high, you won't sit well <-n
your saddle, your arms will bend too
much and you'll get a strained feeling
in the small of your back and across
your breastbone. Get right off and
walk, or, if you must ride, adjust your
machine for it. Hard hill climbing is
bad business. I don't believe in It. It
is when a rider Is facing the wind that
he needs to be careful of his bellows.
Nothing Is easier than to strain and in
jure the lungs in bucking a high wind.
As soon as the rider finds that he can't
keep his mouth shut, that he is gasping
and has a convulsive and painful feel
ing in the region of the solar plexus,
he ought to stop, or at least cut down
the pace.
Of course, it is easier to bore through
a high wind with the top of your head
than to push your face through it, but
I have seelr^ many a rider lose more
than he gained by hanging his head.
Such a posture obstructs the throat and
brings a strain on the back of the neck
that is injurious.
In conclusion, I want to urge every
rider to acquire "form" on the wheel.
Don't be satisfied simply because you
can keep your seat most of the time
and look well enough to escape being
openly guyed.
Compare your riding with that of
others; imitate the good points, but
don't copy the faults of an expert sim
ply because he has merit.
Above all, get Into condition; I don't
mean hard training, but sound health.
It always pays. JAMES MICHAEL.

ABOUT two miles from Sausalito
there runs north and south to
the sea a welj-wooded and pic
turesque little canyon, which ia
known as Tennessee Valley. It
Is so called because over thirty years
ago the big ship Tennessee went ashore
In the breakers at the foot of the val
ley. Some fragments of the wreck may
still be Been imbedded In the sands.
The valley is distinguished for the rich
clusters of buckeye trees which extend
along the banks of a little stream much
favored by picnic parties in summer
and mushroom hunters after the first
winter raina.
Until a few weeks ago there stood
on the western side of the canyon, close
to the beach, a little cabin; its last tim
bers were blown down in the gale less
than a fortnight ago.
The man who built the cabin and
lived in it for nearly twenty years was
an eccentric character, a hermit. No
one saw him go and no one
knew when he deserted the cabin
or whether he was alive or dead. Un
like most solitaries, this mysterious in
dividual did not let his hair and beard
grow to unusual length. On the con
trary, whenever he was seen by his
neighbors he always appeared cleanly
and well groomed. Nor was his manner
gruff and forbidding, but he was al
ways polite and had the air of a person
of breeding and refinement.
How he lived was a mystery, for he
had no occupation, and with the ex
ception of monthly visits to Sausallto
to purchase provisions he was never
seen more than a few hundred yards
from his cabin. Strangers who In
quired about the tides, the trails or the
fishing he always answered civilly.

PICTURE OF YE MOST fINCIENT BICYCLE.
CHURCH WINDOW CONTAINING IN AN UPPER PANEL A BICYCLE IT
WAS MADE 120 YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST BICYCLE KNOWN
TO HISTORY. IT IS A GREAT MYSTERY.
From a Photograph. -â -,--- â¢-â"4 -â 
FROM the ancient chancel of a
country church near London there
has just come evidence that up
sets the idea of the bicycle being
a modern idea. In the village of
Stoke Poges, there stands one of those
Ivy-covered places of worship that,
viewed from the outside, carries one
back centuries, and viewed from the
interior, while the rector is droning
out the service, seems to be the acme
of religious solemnity.
This is hardly the kind of place to
look for evidence concerning the origin
of that modern article of speedy frivol
ity, the bicycle. And yet it has just
been discovered that here. In a stained
glass window in the ancient church of
Stoke Poges, made famous as the place
where the poet. Grey, obtained the lo
cal coloring for his Elegy, is a repre
sentation of the original of all the
great family of wheelmen and wheel -
curiosity, was promptly checked with
firmness.
Less than a month ago his nearest
neighbors were surprised to discover
that the cabin of the recluse had been
abandoned and abandoned so suddenly
that most of the personal effects of the
hermit were still in the cabin. It looked
as if he had simply gathered up a few
articles and had walked out the door.
Inquiry was at once set on foot to dis
caver the whereabouts of the herniit.
It was cut short by the arrival of a
gentleman from England who cleared
up the whole mystery.
The visitor took a team and asked to
be driven to Tennessee Valley. On the
road he told the driver that he was in
terested in the man who onro lived on
the beach. The driver replied that he
had often seen and spoken to the her
mit.
The stranger visited the ruins of the
cabin and when he returned took a
room in the Maison de Mergue. There
he made still further inquiries and
frankly said that the hermit was his
brother and that his mission to the
Pacific Coast was to find out what had
become of certain valuable papers
which in the hurry of departure his
brother had left behind with his books
and other property.
No one could tell him who had suc
ceeded to the hermit'? possessions, but
it was barely possible that some of the
Portuguese dairymen in the neighbor
hood might enlighten him.
Bit by bit the following story 'was
gleaned from the visitor: "My broth
er," he said, "was self-exiled from Eng
land. Through no fault of his own he
became involved in an affair of so dis
graceful a nature and the circum
stantial evidence was so strong against
him that had he remained he would
hnve undoubtedly been punished for a
crime of which he was innocent.
"My brother was a lieutenant in a
cavalry regiment stationed at Alder
shot when this affair occurred. His
regiment was the Tenth Hussars,
Prince Albert's Own, which was then,
and is now, one of the crack regiments
of the country. The adjutant of the
regiment was a Welshman and possi
bly the most unpopular man In the
service. He had a pretty wife of whom
he was insanely Jealous. She was
giddy, fond of admiration and liked to
have all the young swells of the regi
ment at her feet. My brother among
the rest used to pay her some Innocent
attentions, not any more than others,
but for some reason the adjutant con
sidered that he was the special favorite
and consequently took an intense dis.
like to him. â¢
"Hinton, the chum of my brother,
and also one of the lady's list, was the
richest young man in the regiment. He
was an open-hmanded fellow whose
purse was at the disposal of all his
friends.
"One evening just after mess Hinton
said to my brother. 'Sam, I cannot give
you that check to-morrow because I've
been utterly drained out.'
" "Oh, it doesn't matter,' was the re
ply 'don't bother yourself about it, I
can easily get the money elsewhere.
I'm going up to London to-morrow to
attend to some business, anyhow.'
" 'Why, you lucky rascal, Mrs. Ad
jutant will be on the same train. I
heard her say so last evening.'
"My brother laughed. 'Then the
! Beauty must do without Beast for a
i-time.'
"It happened that tne adjutant over
heard all this conversation, as he was
standing behind the portiere.
'"My brother did not see Hinton again
that night, but when he went to his
quarters he found a check with Hin
ton's signature for Â£250 lying on the
table. He thought this rather odd. as
he had only asked Hinton for half that
amount. He put the check in his pocket
and thought no more about the matter.
He took the morning train for London,
but the adjutant's wife was not on
board.
"After parade that day the adjutant
sauntered up to Hinton and said:
" 'Hinton, could you let me have Â£100
for a month?'
" 'I'm sorry I can't,' replied Hinton,
women who possess our highways to
day.
It is truly startling this sudden dis
covery of the original wheelman, for
since the bicycle became popular many
so-called authentic stories have been
written, giving the exact date when the
progenitor of the modern safety came
into existence, but none of the authors
of these contributions to wheeling lit
erature mention the bicycle window in
the church of Stoke Poges. Here,
then, is the first information the wheel
ing world will have of the existence of
this remarkable window, a picture of
which Is shown in the accompanying
photograph. What artist made the
window that shows the figure of a
primitive man astride a wheel of curi
ous construction is not known. The
only thing actually certain about the
record of the Window is that the panel
bears the date of 1642, which ante
dates the time when the first bicycle
was supposed to have come into exist
ence by 120 years.
'I had to refuse a chum of mine last
evening. I haven't been in condition to
sign a check for a week.'
" 'Indeed,' said the adjutant, 'Sorry
for you,' and walked away.
"My brother presented Hinton's
check at the bank, put the cash in his
pocket and was leaving th<= place when
he was arrested by a man.
" 'I am a detective officer and I re
quest, sir, that you will accompany me
without any trouble to the private of
fice of the bank.'
"Much surprised and puzzled my
brother did so. The check was pro
duced, carefully examined and the sig
nature pronounced a forgery. To make
the evidence complete a telegram was
sent to Hinton at Aldershot:
Did you sign a check upon us yf ster
daj? BANK.
The reply came:
No. Have not drawn upon you for a
week. HINTON.
" 'Under the circumstances,' saJd the
detective to my brother, 'it is my pain
ful duty to arrest you for forgery.'
"Nov.-, while both Hinton and my
brother firmly believed that this dia
bolical scheme was the work of their
villainous comrade, the adjutant, who
was notoriously skilled with the pen,
realized that the evidence was so
overwhelming that a trial meant con
viction.
"Through the efforts of a few devoted
friends my brother made his escape.
The general impression left in the regi
ment was that he had committed sui
cide. He drif d out to this coast, a
ruined and heart-broken man. He
spent the best years of his life on. that
shore yonder. I alone knew he was
alive for I kept up a constant com
munication with him.
"The adjutant's wife ran away with
a young subsaltern.
. "Within the year the adjutant shot
himself. But before his suicide he
wrote a document confessing he was
the forger and that, he took that meth
od to ruin my brother because he be
lieved he had betrayed his wife."

COLLEGE BORNEO FOR SPITE BY ONE OF ITS PROFESSORS
STRANGE MENTAL AND MORAL BIAS OF GEORGE HERBERT STEVENS OF LAFAYETTE COLLEGE AND THE REVENGE HE PLANNED
AGAINST ITS PRESIDENT.
â "â "^ TEPIIEXS, the Incendiary col-
lege professor who burned the
magnificent Pardee Hall at La
v/^Cayettev /^Cayette College last December, at
Easton, lies in a prison cell in
rew York City. He was only last week
iscoVered to be the incendiary and
laced under arrest.
Already psychological experts are In
a sea of speculation as to the probable
cfiupe leading to the professor's acts of
degeneracy. Is it hereditary taint, tem
porary Insanity or the work of an in
tellectual crook, as assorted by District
Attorney Fox. himself a college man of
experience and reading along the line
of metaphysical investigation? ,
Detective* have found at Stephens'
h< me, near Montrose, Pa.. 227 volumes
of classical literature, stolen from the
yette building at different times.
The books have been returned by order
of the District Attorney.
Lafayette College, chartered in 1*26.
embraces seventeen imposing buildings
north of Easton. on the heights, com
manding an inspiring view of the val
leys of the Lehigh and Delaware rivers.
It is a Presbyterian institution, with
an attendance of about four hundred
students annually, and cost about
51.000,000.
The facts in this strange case, con
densed, arc: In the summer of 1^93
ent Warfleld engaged George
iert Stephens as assistant profes
sor of moral philosophy. The young
man was a Princeton graduate, taking
special studies In the Theological Sem
inary. After a year's trial young
Stephens was appointed associate pro
fess* r for two years longer, at $:>OO a
year.
They were close friends a year or
two; then bitter enemies. Stephens
critciaed th â â¢ president's theological
views â did not (â¢â¢nsider his college
methods sound. Warfleld refused to re
appoint him. He appealed to the trus
tees with an Ingenious fifteen thousand
word statement. They listened, were
charmed, but sustained the president â
s.-rd Stephens must g>>.
Caspar Wistar Hodge, also of Prince
ton, succeeded him. Stephens retired
tn his home, near Montrose, in Sus
quohanna County, and planned revenge
â to burn the college buildings one by
one. that the students might be ac
cused. They would resent it. In the
uproar the president would be forced
to resign as unfit to manage a great in
stitution.
Stephens reached Fhillipsburg. just
across the river from Easton, Decem
ber 17 1897. Some time alter midnight
on the 18th, disguised, he entered Par
dee Hall v.ith his key, abstracted val
uable books from th.' library for fu
ture reading, made a pyramid of fur
niture, surmounted by Professor Da
vidson's favorite motto, "Study Nature,
and Not Books." The letters were of
bones, and handsomely framed.
Stephens thought it a great joke on
his friend Davidson, with whose philo
sophical views he did not agree. He
shoved a light-d gaspipe into the pile,
locked the door and fled to his hotel.
The lack of oxygen smothered the con
flagration. No fire was visible from
Philllppburg. Stephens thought his
mission had failed, but was awakened
Â°t the break of day by the glare of the
burning building.
He went to New York, returned in a
week, visited the ruins, chuckling over
the desolation. His deviltry had proved
a success.
Then he began a series of desecra
tions unparalleled in the history of col
leges. Being well known and having
a key he was able to go about unre
strained. One day he entered the
chapel. Improvised a nocturne on the
big organ, then proceeded to business.
He threw the chapel Bible and hymn
books into a well near the door, not to
spite the Almighty, but to create trou
ble between the president and the stu
dents. He disarranged the organ ma
chinery and destroyed the historic big
vine at the door.
Four months later he returned, play
ed a heavenly symphony on the organ,
then poured tar Into Its machinery,
smeared hymn books, Bible and pews
with pitch, and otherwise desecrated
the chapel.
It should be explained that District
Attorney Fox already had detectives on
the case. Laborer Messinger guarded
the chapel at night. So a few nights
ago, in the darkness, Stephens was
heard in the building. The watchman
slipped up and clubbed him with a
piece of hosepipe.
In his flight the professor left his key
behind in the door. That little imple
ment of brass proved Stephens' undo
ing. The janitor recognized it as his
key. In a room where he had been tem
porarily sleeping they found his valise
and a lot of telltale articles. Later,
when he was arrested, near Harris
burg, at Duncannon, where he was
about to accept the principalship of the
schools of that town, he collapsed.
He was taken to Easton. In the pres
ence of trustees and a few friends,
Stephens confessed. Never in the his
tory of State institutions has there
been a case having its startling feat
ures. Viewed from any standpoint, it
is extraordinary. While friends and
foes denounce the burning of the build
ing, good men seek excuses for the
young professor.
And other facts are coming to light.
It is alleged that barns have been
burned under suspicious circumstances
in his home district. A Mr. Hammet at
Hammetsford, Pa., loaned Stephens
DEADLY CONTENTS OF WAR PROJECTILES FIXED TO BURST AMONG THE ENEMY.
MODERN guns were much used
even as recently as our civil war,
pays an army officer in the New
York Herald. The improvement
has embraced all calibers, from
that of the small arm firing a projectile
only one-third of an Inch in diameter to
the monster which sends a solid piece of
steel 12 inches through and weighing over
half a ton. Not only have the guns im
proved, but also all their accessories, es
pecially powder and projectiles. The
smokeless pcwder of the present has
changed the conditions of war almost as
much as modern armament. In fact, it
was absolutely necessary to improve the
powder along with the gun.
Keeping step with these advances havo
been thoee made in the various classes of
projectiles. Even the smallosf of these
with its case-hardened bullet Is far ahead
of the old-fashioned lead bullet used in
the small arms of thirty years ago.
One of the most effective of modern pro
jectiles is the shrapnel. It is one of the
forms of case shot. The others were the
old-fashioned grape and canister. A case

$3000. When pressed for payment the
young man did not produce the money
and disappeared. Suddenly, two barns
on his father's farm mysteriously
burned. Stephens collected the insur
ance money, deposited it in an Easton
bank. Hammet got the money by at
tachment. Again Stephens disappeared
and then Hammet's own barn went up
in flame. No one could swear who
did it.
The loss, however, did not prevent
Hammet getting the balance due on
the note. He had the Stephens home
stead sold at Sheriff's sale, bought it
in, and, to get even with his young
Presbyterian friend, deeded it to the
First I'niversalist Church of Towanda.
Another allegation said to be at the
bottom of all his troubles is that
Stephens originally desired to enter the
Presbyterian ministry. Rich men vol
unteered to educate him providing
their money be returned if he failed to
enter the pulpit. Stephens agreed, went
through Princeton, took a supplemen
tary course at the Theological Semi
nary, then was engaged as professor
by President Warfield of Lafayette Col
lege.
As soon as the Montrose Presbyteri
ans learned that Stephens had aban
doned the pulpit for a professorship
t}>ey raised a storm. Stephens ex
plained that he was too younar, but
would preach later. This was accepted
by pc me of his backers.
But Dr. Patton of Princeton wrote
President Warfield about the matter.
Stephens seemed so indifferent and
evasive in his explanations that for the
first time the president began to doubt
his integrity.
Stephens is an imposing, athletic
man, perfectly self-possessed, muscu
lar and of great strength. He is near
ly six feet tall and weighs about one
hundred and ninety pounds. His face
is round, his hair a sandy red and his
eyes something of a fishy blue. He
had been described as having a weak
face and a massive, intellectual brow
â a sort of degenerate Webster. His
chin is certainly not that of a strontr,
well balanced man, born to command,
and there is a suggestion of sensual
ity â almost brutality â about the mouth
which tells a story and explains how
shot may he said to be a collection of
missiles in a case, which breaks up either
in the sun or at some point in flight, thus
setting free its death-dealing particles.
As soon as the case is broken each of
these particles goes on a separate path,
anu it's a sorry day for the man struck
by one of them. All of these falling upon
a piece of level ground would mark out
an irregular oval, whose area varies -with
differing conditions. It has been found
that the best point to burst the shrapnel
is about six yards above and fifty In front
of the enemy.
Colonel Shrapnel of the British service
first invented shrapnel in ISO 3. This early
form consisted simply of a spherical shell
tilled with bullets and a bursting charge
of powder in the spaces between. This
was a crude invention, which scattered
the fragments too much, and was liable
to go on" when not expected, and not to
do su when desired. This form was Im
proved upon during our great war. and
the modern shrapnel can be considered
the most dangerous of all life destroying
projectiles. It consists of three partsâ
the tube, the base and the head. The
powder charge is in the base, which is
firmly attached to the body either by i
electric welding or by screwing. Leading '
from the base through the center of the I
he came to commit acts not of a high
minded scholar, but of a degenerate.
Yet, when the man begins to talk,
to argue, to reason, to compare, to
make fine distinctions, to draw conclu
sions, the play of his intellect on his
features works a miracle. Sensuality
disappears. The brutality of the jaw
is forgotten; the high Websterian brow
and inspired countenance, the flashing
eyes and appealing declamation amaze
and charm the listener. Suspicion van
ishes and doubt gives way to admira
tion for the persecuted genius.
Alas! Another change comes when
you try to pin him down to a definite
statement of his grievances, to define
some of the charges against the presi
dent. liv reply, there is only evasive,
vaporous explanation, with an idiotic
smile, a cunning, flippant sparring for
time, succeeded by elaborate, indefinite
speech, requiring an hour for one to
hear it to the finish.
"At the trial," said the professor in
jail, "the sad story will be told and the
community surprised when they hear
all the facts."
"But you have already confessed.
What excuse can be made for burning
a great college building; belonging to
body is a tube which is also filled with
powder, which is ignited by the fuse at
the point of the shrapnel, and carries the
lire to the main charge. Between 200 and
300 bullets rest upon a diaphragm just
over the powder charge. These are held
in place by a matrix of rosin w r hlch is
melted and poured upon the bullets when
in place. A skeleton case of cast-iron,
containing receptacles for each bullet, is
sometimes used, instead of the rosin.
The head is put on in the same manner
as the base, and when the fuse is inserted
the projectile is ready for use.
It can readily be seen that one great ob
jection to the shrapnel is its high cost.
The fuse alone costs about $2 50.
Sharpnels fired from a gun a mile away
in one instance, and a mile and two
thirds in the other, were made to strike
a board target one inch thick. The fuses
were set off by the contact and burst
the projectile into 200 or 300 parts, each of
which was capable of dealing death to
any living thing in its path.
Besides with the shrapnel type shot
improvements have also been made in all
kinds that can be fired from a gun. In
this respect they have kept pace with
the gun.
In the solid shot the improvement has
been principally in the way of size and
the public, simply to be revenged on
the president?" . J . '/;.-.Â»">;.
â¢ With eyes Hashing and coumenunce
dark with indignation Stephens ox
c!;\ini"d: '"This college president is a
hypocrite. I have proof that he is a
dangerous man, unfit to control a great
institution. I shall present a plain
statement of facts that will condemn
him before the country."
"But what are these facts? Mention
a single act committed by him that can
justify your burning the college build
ing."
Here a cold, foolish smile played in
and out of the milky blue of the pro
fessor's eyes. It was an imbecile exhi
bition after the eloquence, the blazing 1
rhetoric of his introductory remarks.
"I am satisfied," he said blandly, "to
let my case rest until the day of trial.
Then it will be my turn, and the public
â¢will hear my side of the story, how this
man has humbugged pupils and profes
sors. I shall unmask himâ show ex
actly what he is, his shallowness, his
trickery, his incapacity and his dishon
esty toward the young men he is sup
posed to instruct and guide."
"How did you come to make his ac
quaintance?"
, some modification of shape to meet the
; requirements of air resistance and so
i cause accuracy. The old round shot is
, little used these days on account of the
[ impossibility of firing it straight. The
I conical shot has increased in size until
a few guns now throw pieces of metal
weighing over half a ton. The force with
which these awful engines of destruction
tear through brick walls and stone forti
fications is almost inconceivable. At a
distance of over three miles an ordinary
wall offers no more resistance than a
piece of paper.
The most terrible projectile of modern
times is that used in the dynamite cruiser
Vesuvius. The shell proper is about fif
teen inches in diameter and five feet long.
On the after end of It is a trailer about
ten feet long for the purpose of keeping
it in a straight course through the air.
The shell carries several hundred pounds
of guneotton, that bursts on contact with
any hard substance. This shell is fired
from a pneumatic gun. and at a distance
of two miles can be used with accuracy.
The explosive deals death over a surface
of a thousand yards, and at Santiago
where it has been used recently, the peo
ple say it shakes the ground like an earth
quake.
In the way of shells the old round pat
"He sought me at Princeton, where I
was an assistant professor. He had
heard of me, knew what I had been do
ing, became my warmest friend until we
were intimate. I liked him, too, until
I discovered his intellectual weaknesses
and the humbug of his methods. I
mildly protested and by gentle argu
ment attempted to show him the fal
lacy of some of his teachings. He did
not relish it, and seemed envious of me.
I had many friends both in college and
in the city. I joined the Pomfret Club,
of which he was a member. When his
popularity began to wane he withdrew,
intimating that I was to follow.
"As it was a select club of the best
men in town. I saw no reason for re
signing. I remained. From that mo
ment President Warfield became my
enemy. Whether it was jealousy or
because of his shallow nature I can
not say.
""Warfleld is a Kentuckian, proud of
his blood," continued the professor, in
response to a question, with a long,
funny, thin smile playing over his fea
tures. "Yes, he is a Kentuckian, the
grandson of a once famous clergyman,
and the nephew of Congressman
Breckinridge, whose name figured in a
tern is still used for purposes of bom
bardment, 'ihis is simply a hollow sphere
filled with powder that is discharged at
the proper moment hy a time fuse. At
moderate range this explosive is as ef
fective as the larger and heavier shells.
Conical shells are made to explode oy
concussion and time fusses. At long range
the conical shell is a most deadly pro
jectile. It is capable of tearing though
walls of enormous thickness and then
bursting after it gets on the inside. The
Palliser shell is conical in shape, made of
hardened steel at the point and soft iron
at the chamber. It is used principally
for piercing armor at close range and ex
ploding by force of concussion at the same
instant. This tears an awful hole in the
side of a ship.
Although almost obsolete, the chain
shot and bar shot are still found in some
magazines. Both work on the principal
of turning around rapidly at the end of
a connecting piece and are capable of
cutting a wide swath through an advanc
ing army of men. They are mostly used
in land engagements at close range and
are particularly useful and valuable
where it is desirable or necessary to save
ammunition. No other shot at the same
cost is capable of doing so much damage
great scandal a few years ago. As I
stated, I was his favorite at the begin
ning. I was not only kept a year on
trial, but re-engaged for the following
year, and the year succeeding that.
But when Warfield found that I would
not yield to his views and be wholly
dominated by him, obey his whims and
fancies, he no longer wanted me in the
institution; my services were of no fur
ther use in the classes."
The subject being now opened, the
prisoner proceeded to denounce the
president with relentless bitterness. He
was almost furious in his condemna
tion of the president's management of
the college. It was a strange exhibi
tion, a strange picture of conflicting
and contradictory emotions, the rea
sons for his hate and vengeance, illog
ical and unsatisfactory â almost trivial
so far as he explained his actions to
ward the president. Stephens wished,
however, to correct a published state
ment. He had never accused the pres
ident of writing letters to other col
leges, warning them not to engage him,
but he knew that the president had
worked against him in other directions
and had driven him out of the Lafay
ette College without justification
Up on the big hill one of the officers
of the college, holding close relations
with the president, in substance said:
The statements Stephens made long
ago led us to fear there was a. screw
iooFe in his head. In regard to his story
about Princeton, here are thy facts:
There was a vacancy here. President
TVarfleld visited Dr. Patton In Prince
ton in search of a competent man to
take the professorship of moral philoso
phy. Dr. Patton invited him into his
j-ivate office and closed the door for
consultation. The young man who
happened to be his private secretary
at that time was of an inquiring turn,
with an abnormal development of curi
osity. He saw no way of overhearing
the conversation except putting his ear
to the keyhole. This he did. Among
other things Dr. Patton said that there
was a young professor named Caspar
Wister Hodge, who was then traveling
in Europe, and would not return per
haps for a year. However, he would
write to him and see how soon he could,
take the position were it offered him.
On the following day this secretary,
who by the way was Stephens, arrived
at Lafayette College, bearing he said
the compliments of Dr. Patton, his
many good wishes and the suggestion
that perhaps he (Stephens), a highly
educated and gifted professor In ethics
and other branches of moral philoso-*
phy, could temporarily fill the vacancy
in the professor's chair pending the re
turn of Professor Hodge from Europe.
So smooth was the tale told by young
Stephens, so graceful was his bearing,
so picturesque and eloquent was his
language, that President Warfield
melted under the charm, especially
when the young man assured him that
he was independent and was moved
only by a desire to do the institution
a service. He was beyond mercenary
motives, for he had property and an
income, removing him entirely from the
poverty so common to young college
professors. If the president cared to
engage him on trial, for a year, for the
nominal sum of $100, he would accept.
They shook hands in Christian fellow
ship, and after a whiff of friendly theo
logical discussion young Stephens was
installed as assistant professor.
At the end of the year he was en
gaged for double that period at $SOO per
annum. But the third year President
Warfield began to hear strange whis
perings, and investigating he discov
ered, he said, that Stephens was not
competent for the position. Though he
was something of a social favorite with
the students, they did not progress in
knowledge beyond a certain point, and
the young professor was found inade
quate to the task of cramming meta
physics, ethics and other crumbs of
moral philosophy into their young
heads.WHAT THE FOREIGN CARTOONISTS

PRESENTIMENTS OF DEATH IN WAR.
THE Associated Press dispatches,
in telling of the death of Hamil
ton Fish Jr., sergeant "f a com
pany of Roosevelt's Rough
Riders in the advance on San
tiago de Cuba, say:
"Fish had a presentiment of his
death In battle before he left San An
tonio for the front. While chatting
with a party of friends at the San An-
Club a few days before he de
parted he expressed the belief that he
would be killed in the first light." .
There -are ;< number of such instances
cord when men have received in
tuitivr- forewarning of their death in an
Impending battle, and such forebodings
were quite common an<l pretty gener
ally believed In by l><>th Mincers and
men during the War of the Rebellion.
Bacb Instances form one of tin- stock
In trade stories at the (;. A. R. gather
ings.
One. of the most remarkable instances
of this kind, remarkable because of the
lete details and their fulnllrn m,
".-is the foreboding of impending death
that came over .Lord Nelson <>n the eve
of his famous victory at Trafalgar. If
ever a man deliberately planned to die
"mid ,-.â  of glory" it was Nelson.
On i\)-- morning of the battle he ap
peared on deck dressed in the showy
rm nnd insignia of his rank.
Borne ' liis (ify.rt-rs remonstrated with
h!m, !n that his attractive uniform
tnat]c liim a conspicuous target for the
fe â¢ ' of thi enemy if engaged at close
Quarters. Nelson replied:
"in honor 1 have won them, in honor
Z will di< in them."
In .support of the theory that this re
ni.-irk was not mere bravado, but the
n suit i,f a genuine presentiment of
. there are the following well
established fi.r'ts: First, .\elson had on
the night before arranged all his
private papers; second, he had pre
pared all the documents relative to his
fleet in a way that would indicate that
he exported them to fall into the hands
of a successor; third, that night he
added a codicil to his will; fourth.

his fleet shortly before the battle he

made out of the wood of a mast of the
ahip L'Orient; fifth, his bearing -toward
his officers ; sixth, his unusual pro
cedure in dressing in his showy uniform
and his manifest desire to die in the
insignia of his rank.
Another death which aroused no end
of discussion among those who firmly
believe in premonitions of death was
that of General Custer at the massacre
on Little Big Horn. Not only is th< re
evidence to show that ('uster felt some
thing of the kind on the eve of his
death, but it is related that his little
daughter, though miles and miles
auay, on that eventful afternoon ran
screaming to the house from the gar
den, where she had '>een at play, saying
she heard her papa calling for help as
the Indians were killing him. When
the death of Custer later became
known and this incident was recalled,
as near as it could be estimated the
hour of Ouster's death and the alarm
of the child coincided to a minute.
George L. Kilmer, in writing of Cus

says:
"Up to that time Custer had shown
himself a man of extreme, not to say
morbid, reticence. He never unbos
omed himself to his officers, but made
his own plans and exacted obedience
from all about him. But upon this cam
paigi^ when his doomed command
reached the borders of the territory
where the hostiles were known to be,
his self-confidence lied and he suddi r.ly
fell back for reliance upon somebody
else. Officers who were with him at the
time declared that he was no longer
Custer. iiis brusque and aggressive,
even rasping, manner and tone disap
peared and he became subdued and
conciliatory. He even went farther
than that. He showed himself depressed
and seemed to want to appeal to those
about him. When the council broke up
Ouster requested all the officers to
make to him then, or at any future
time, any suggestions they saw fit. The
unusual bearing of their leader made a
great impression upon the officers, and
as they walked away from the general's
bivouac one of them exclaimed: 'I be
lieve that Custer is going to be killed,
because I never heard him talk that
way before.' "
General Fitz-John Porter relates a
triple case of presentment which
came under his observation during the
Mexican War.
"It was at the siege of the City of
Mexico. On September 12, 1847, Battery
G. Fourth Artillery, of which I was sec
ond lieutenant, with heavy guns, had
flr<Â»d all day at the Castle of Chapul
tepec. defended by Mexican artillery

and infantry, preparatory to its being
stormed by our infantry the next day.
After sundown the storming party of
infantry (regular troops) passed our
battery to take their positions for the
Dight so as to be ready for an attack in
the morning. Captain Drum and First
Lieutenant Benjamin of my battery
and myself spoke to and encouraged
I heir friends and their gallant com
rades as they marched by us. All were
confident of victory and all were cheer
ful except my friend Lieutenant Gantt.
He was particularly despo-ndent and in
reply to my salutation exclaimed, with
a farewell wave of his hand 'Good by,
Porte?', 1 shall never- *â¢â >â¢ you again.'
"His words were prophetic Among
tho very first of the brave fellows who
led the storming: party was Lieutenant
Gantt, fearlessly facing the fate he had
predicted. He was one of the first of
our men to be killed.
"That night Captain Drum, Lieu
tenant Benjamin and myself were sit
ting In Captain Drum's tent. Captain
Drum was quite dependent, and his
appearance and features denoted that
he had experienced a premonition of
death. Finally he said to me:
" 'Porter, I wish you would go out for
a moment I don't expect to live
through the fight to-morrow and I
want to arrange with Benjamin, who
will be my successor, my private af
fairs, and I want to be alone with him.'
"Benjamin shared ] (rum's premoni
tion and he answered, 'Oh, Drum, let
i Porter remain. I too, expect to be
killed in the battle to-morrow.'
"I had no such feeling and I re
sponded in as cheerful a tone as pos
sible. 'Captain, don't borrow trouble.
As 1 do not anticipate any Injury, I
think you had better tell ub both your
wishes.' He was persistent, however,
and I left the tent and never knew
what his last wishes were.
"The next morning and after the tak
ing of Chapultepec we moved along the
narrow road leading into the City of
Mexico at the fortified gate named
Carita do Belin. in the middle of -which
was the arched aqueduct that supplied
the city with water. It afforded us
gomo protection from the sweeping
direct and alÃo flank artillery and in
fantry fire of the enemy. On the way
I was struck by a spent cannon shot
and knocked from my horse, being ren
dered temporarily unfit for duty. Drum
at once rushed to me and picked me up
exclaiming:
" 'Hello, Porter, you said nothing
would happen to you; don't be too
sure.' , - -
" 'Don't fear for me,' I answered. 'I
hope you won't meet with any worse
accident.'
"But he was still certain that he
would be killed, for he replied, 'Good
by, I shall not see you again.' And he
bravely rushed on to help gain the vic
tory we sought, despite the conviction
that he would be a victim.
"Though delayed but a short time by
my fall when I had remounted and
joined my battery I found the Carita de
Belin in our possession and our bat
tery in advance battering the citadel
held by the Mexican Infantry and ar
tillery, whose fire; but 200 yards away,
was concentrated upon the guns in
charge of Drum and Benjamin. Al
most immediately our battery was
crippled! Drum and Benjamin and
First Sergeant Baldwin were mortally
wounded and twenty-seven out of the
thirty men were killed or wounded.
On the eve of the battle of Marengo
General Dessaix had a "presentiment
that he would fall next day. It proved
true, for he was shot through the heart
during the thick of the fight. It can
not be charged that this presentiment
on the part of General Dessaix was born
of an undue fear, for all the honors
showered upon him by Napoleon wore
won by bravery in battle. He had
fought with great bravery and honor,
particularly in Egypt, but for the two
previous years had not been in nny of
Napoleon's European battles. The
night before the battle of Marengo he
remarked to several of his staff who
had gathered about him, "Something
will happen to me to-morrow. It is a
long time since I fought in Europe and
the bullets here don't know me nny
more." He then arranged hi.s affairs
with the same care as though on his
death bed. Next morning he in
structed a member of his staff not to
leave his side, as he wanted his body
cared for. It was only a few hours
when the officer was called upon to as
sume that duty, for General Dessaix
was shot through the heart.
A parallel rase to this occurred dur
ing the rebellion. The gallant soldier
poet, General Lytle, predicted his own
death at Chickamauga, and like Gen
eral Desaix requested a member of his
staff to remain by his side during the
battle so that his body might be cared
for. When General Lytle's brigade
came up Into position he called to his
side his favorite aide-de-camp. Lieu
tenant J. N. Truir.bull of Company E,
Thirty-sixth Illinois, and told him that
a. great battle was about to be fought,
but that he, himself, would be killed.
After giving other Instructions he said:
"Trumbull, I want you to stay by my
side to-day, for I feel that this is my
last battle. I will surely be killed. Stay
by me every moment." His words were
prophetic
INFLUENCES OF LEITER'S W HEAT DEAL.
THESE closing years of the nine
teenth century are "markedly
many striking and curious so
cial phenomena, but without
doubt the most remarkable
|of them all is that of the all-potent
! power and far-reaching influence which
â  has been imparted to so commonplace
| a commodity as wheat. More than the
'â  decrees of Kings and Emperors and the
| will of mighty self-governing peoples
is the humble grain of our fields a fac
tor in influencing the general condition
j of mankind, and in a measure shaping
! the destiny of nations. In the rise and
i fall of young Leiter. and the part that
wheat played in his meteoric career, we
have a startling exemplification of this
I truth.
At first glance the story of Leiter re
solves itself into nothing more than a
passing incident common to everyday
! commercial life â the incident of a man
I making millions in a few hours by
j shrewd dealing, and losing them again
i just as quickly. But in following causes
!to effects we find that the general
j shortage of wheat consequent on the
I "corner" manipulated by Leiter was
j the direct cause of bread riots in many
; parts of Europe: of a dreadful slaugh
! ter of human beings in hungry Italy;
! the overthrow of two Ministries, and
the indirect cause of the approaching
' collapse of a groat international alli
ance. Thus dpes the proverbial "staff
i of life," in the hands of unscrupulous
i speculators operating under laws pecu
, liar only to the commercial system of
i our age, become an instrument of dis
| aster and death.
Leiter made his money In conse
j quence of the foreign demand. The
scarcity of wheat in France, for in
! stance â and Italy may be taken as be
| ing similarly affectedâ is shown by a
statement made by George French,
Leiter's manager. He says that a syn
| dicate in France cabled to him for as
j much wheat as he could offer. Leiter
' offered 2,000,000 bushels at 28 francs,
! which they considered a prohibitive
! price. The syndicate, however, snapped
j at it and asked for more which was
| withheld, for speculative purposes.
The subsequent bread riots all over
are now a matter of history. An
official list of the persons killed by the
military during the uprising at Milan
alone gives 75 killed outright and seven
more who died in hospitals, making the
total number 82. The wounded num
bered 63, the majority of whom will die
of their injuries owing to the unusually
disastrous effect of the bullei used.
These projectiles by the way, were the
now famous Mauser bullets, the same
as were used by the Spanish In the re
cent skirmish with our marines at
Guantanamo, and which gave riÂ«e to
the belief that our dead had been bar
barously mutilated with machetes. The
murderous execution of this projectile
and the frightful tortures undergone
by its victim â in many instances re
sulting in raving insanity â has aroused
a protest against its use in mllitary
circles all over Europe, with the prob
able consequence that It will be dp
barred by all civilized nations. The
charge on the mob at Milan constituted
the first occasion on which this bullet
has been used in actual hostilities, and
the effect was so horrifying as to sicken
the most callous-hearted soldier.
Experience showed that when struck
at a distance of from 500 to 600 yards a
skull and its contents would fly off in
small pieces in various directions. The
explanation of this effect is found in
the tremendous speed at which the new
bullets travel. When opposed by a
strong object the bullet imparts its
movements, converted now into mole
cular movements, to the opposing sub
stance, so that in the case of a skull
the brain matter seeks to escape in all
directions, and consequently bursts its
casing. In the case of all rioters shot
through the head almost the same ef
fect was noticed, the skull stood open
like the lid of a box, and the brain mat
ter had escaped through the opening it
had made. When the bullet struck a
muscle it passed straight through, but
when it was resisted by bone substance
the latter was shattered and the frag
ments sent in all directions. The con
sequence Is that all those who were
shot in the arms or legs had to submit
to the amputation of the wounded
limb, while wounds to the hip invaria
bly prove fatal.
The bread riots in Italy and their
consequent disasters were the primary
cause of the resignation of the Ministry
and the formation of a new Govern
ment on May 31 last. Now we hear
that the new Ministry has formally re
signed office, and that in Italy it is gen
erally conceded that the resignation
foreshadows grave events.
So much for the direct effect on Italjc
f> ERMAN sentiment we are apt to
b think unanimous in favor of Spain.
But the lesser press, which we do
not often see here, reveals a different
side. The drawing from Simplissimus,
which we reproduce, is from a distinct
ly radical point of view, but it is a
keen comment on the attitude Ger
many is likely to take. To the victor
belong German laurels, and to him
alone. â 
of Leiter's wheat deal.
But graver contingencies threatenâ
Involving all the nations of Europe. In
diplomatic circles it has been felt for
some time that the collapse of the
Triple Alliance was approaching, and
the recent events in Italy have dealt
the final blow. Italy's prestige abroad
is so shattered, and she is torn with
internal dissensions to such an extent
that her value as an ally to Germany
and Austria is practically nil. The
Triple Alliance has ceased to be the
most important factor in the European
situation. Just how the European
powers will be grouped In the future is,
of course, not known, but from present
indications it is possible that an alli
ance of the three empires of Russia,
Germany and Austria may take the
place of the Triple Alliance. France,
whose tie to Russia is rapidly beoom
{ ing looser, will probably combine .with
those countries whose peoples are more
akin to hersâ viz., Italy, Spain and
Portugal â and these two groups of
powers would have a bond in their
common hatred of Great Britain.
Thus are the policies and destinies of
great nations affected by â what was
originall-" â so Insignificant a circum
stance as a corner on wheat.
In England the direct effect has been
nothing more pernicious than an ad
vance in flour, while in the United
States we have happily escaped with
the comparatively slight harm of the
closing down of four of Milwaukee's
big flour mills.
In view of the dire effects of the mod
ern practice of making the exchange
of the essentials of life a gambling in
dustry, it is interesting to revert back
to the old days when there were no
corn exchanges â when the farmers of
Old England used to bring into London
their wagon loads of wheat by road,
and personally expose it for sale on
Cornhill. A shortage in those days was
met with prompt and efficient meas
ures, and no thrifty farmer or broker
was permitted to take advantage of a
public misfortune. If the country mag
istrates did not stop them beforehand
and make them sell, whether they
would or not, as was one of the com
mendable little ways the country
magistrates had in those days, they
were sure to be mobbed a-t Stratford;
and so furious was the struggle to get
the wheat that it often got spilled v; <>n
the ground, trodden under foot and sat
urated with the blood of those â¢ who
were fighting for it. Things are not
so picturesque or honest nowadays. A
modern shortage in wheat is more gen
erally a ruse to exact higher prices.

The morning sun picked out little, bright. Jewel-like
spots on the instrument he hud leveled across the top of
the big stump. He seemed to be a surveyor taking levels.
â¢ aa three men riding broncos came in sight at a
sudden turn in the trail, he bowed his head to the level of

there was a nervous tightening of the right
hand grasping the instrument; a sharp click cluse to it; a
puff of smoke, followed by a sharp (.rack, and the man
riding the Becond bronco tumbled from the saddle, shot
through the heart. He rolled ov^r as he fell, and the
fright blots of blood splashed over the rose leaves by the
tide of the trail.
The first cayuse, startled out of his sleepy lope by the
red and plunged madly forward. As
. â¢; â¢ first bound in the air a bullet glanced from

r< w way through the leather flaps of the big Mcxl-
The rider yelled and dug the spurs In the trembling
flanks of t! la he felt the hot had scorching its

"D bad shot!" the man behind the stump jerked
:; his square jaws, as he pumped the lever of

Evidently he had meant well, but the cayuse rearing
had diverted the bullet from its intended way.
The third bronco and Us rider were making good time
In the other direction. The shot he sent after them d'd
not ln< eir speed any, for they were doing their

The animal the dend man had ridden did not move. He
stood : fallen figurt , waiting witn dumb patience
for liis n-, aii'i mount again.
Throwing th <-mi>ty shell from the breech of his rifle,
the man who had fired the shuts walked leisurely over to
the figure lying on the ground.
"Well, Jack, old man." he said, addressing the horse.
"you're a d d sight honester than your master. If
to his pals as close as you're doing he'd be
ready for grub pile at noon, instead of bleaching out here.
"An he cached the 'stuff' in this big aparrejo,
too." he added, shoving his hand down in the ample, bag
like affair.
Yea, It was there, right enough; a whole bag fun of It.
Forty-four hundred dollars, as was. found out afterward.
Then he turned his attention to the man lying on his
back, with the great ragged red gash in his chest where
Ircling bullet had plunged through.
'â¢Well, pard, you've thrown down your mate for the
last time. Whisky drinkin' is bad business, but whisky
tradln' Is away up In *(Â»,' to jedge by this wad." And he
ed the bag of money lovingly.
"You mi^ht a-known better than to throw me down,"
Ided, reproachfully, as though he -were trying to
throw the blame of the murder upon the man himself.
"Come on, now. Jack. I'll use you for a little," and he
leisurely threw his leg over the cayuse and disappeared
down the Mlssoula ena of the trail.
He had not Rune far before he turned short to the left
up a dry water course. Mere he stopped, and, dismounting,
ded to wrap some old bags he pulled out from be
hind a rock about the feet of the cayuse.
"You're a tenderfoot, Jack; you've hit the trail so of
ten that you're a bit sore in the toes," he remarked, in a
dry monotone, as he worked at the bags.
Then he mounted again, and went across country for
about three miles, until he struck the big cedar swamp
which runs for miles and miles from Golden.
As he rode along he let his thoughts work themselves
oiÂ»t In words, firing them at Jack, and punctuating them
with swinging digs from the big spurs which hung rather
loosely on his rather hlgh-heelea boots.
"They'll think that the prospector who laid your old
man out has hit the trail for Mlssoula anfl lit out.
"They'll pick up tracks there, all right enough, but
they ain't yourn. Jack.
"Let me see,' he added, pulling a watch from his
pocket; "Whisky Saunders took that bad spell about 10
o'clock. The jay on the cayuse will strike Golden about
noon. Old Steel and his Jim-Dandles will pull out in half
an hour, and pick up your tracks headln' for Missoula
nbout 3. There'll be a terrible row, and they'll run in
s ime p< or devil before night. They'll cop almost any one
but me."
Then he mounted Blazer and rode In a big circuit,
skirting th< cedar swamp, and upon the mountain side on
his way lark to Golden. It was dark when he got to the
ford on Kicking Horse River. Just opposite the town.
Hallway a. toss lie took a careful pull to one side, letting
Blazer feel his way carefully. Stopping the horse he took
his Winchester and threw it far out on the upper side of
the ford; that is. he took a big swing at It, but the loose
end of his hackle line caught In the breech and the rifle
came splashing down at Blazer's boots.
"A d bad throw." he said, grimly; then he
clnii kleil softly to himself. "I guess this outnt'll cut loose
better!" and he commenced tiring ?s.x, cartridges far out
Into the stream with vigorous swings of his long arm.
"That's a cinch," he granted, complacently. "I wish the
gun laid as deep, but it's bad fishing now an' I guess they
won't find It, anyway."
When Blaser*s hoofs lost the muffled sound of the
water and Btruck with a sharp ring on trie smooth-worn
stones on the Golden side of the Kicking Horse, the rider

broke into a lope.
It was tho night before (ho day that the whisky smug

Santley was astonished and said so, which was quite
right, for he had not seen Grace â Grace Altonâ since he

had left England. â
"I'm glad to see you, Grace, he said, "but you should
not come here, all the same. You always had sense, but
this is fairly foolish."
"That doesn't matter In the slightest, and, besides
(with a fine touch of womanly inconsistency), no one saw
me coming here except the friend who Is waiting outside;
It's none of their affairs if they did."
"Well, what's expected of me?" he asked, resignedly.
"You're wanted at home, your mother wants you."
"I suppose I ought to go, but I'm not going all the
same," he added, taking a long breath, as though the
words scorched his throat a little.
"Yes, you must go, Arvil, I want you to po. This life
Is not the life for you. Your mother sent tins money to
you to take you back to her. so you must go now."
"You need not come back with me to the hotel. I have
a Rood guide with me, the friend who got her to come with
m- called her Mammy Nolas. 1 know that you will go
back, for you've paomised me, and you never broke a
promise to me yet, ' she said, as she slipped quietly out of
the door.
A little roll of bills was lying on the table where she
had left it.
It lacked half an hour of 12 o'clock when a French half
breed, Baptiste Gabrielle, galloped into the square of tho
police barracks at Golden on a cayuse reeking with the
wei which ts from the inside. The constable on guard,,
pacing solemnly up and down in front of the major's quar
ters, thought the fanatical looking rider was drunk or
running amuck, and swore that he would put a hole in
him unless he stopped.
Baptiste was a weird looking object as he slid from the
back of the jaded beast, standing there with all four legs
braced like the posts of a sawhorse in sheer weakness,
and flanks pumping in half spasmodic strokes an the wide
open nostrils clutched at the air the lungs were clamoring
for.
"By Goss! that fell' Whisk' Sand'son, he get keel,"
panted RaptiPte. with a face the color of a lemon in a
bottle of alcohol.
"By tarn! a fell* wit' long neck he keep him behint

stump, an' he soot him soor."
"Is he dead, Batiste?" queried Sergeant Hetherington,
in a voice with a full flavor of peat bog about It. "Is he
dead, or on'y hur-r-rt?"
"Bet you life, that Whisk' fell' he dead." replied Bap
tiste. "That fell' he soot tree, fo' time; an' Sand'son he
kill for soor, he dead w'atever. He try soot me, but I
stan" him off, an' come quick tell police fell."
"March him in to the major,' said Hetnerington to a
constable.
Before the major, Baptiste's harangue boiled down
read: "Shot at 10 o'clock on the Missoula trail, about
eighteen miles from Golden."
"What was the man like who did the shooting?" asked
the major.
"Tall fell' wit' long neck." was the graphic description
this query brought lorth.
"Indian, breed, or white man?" asked the major.
"Don't know; me t'ink he white. Tall fell'; tarn long
neck. That fell' he got "Whisk Sand'son stuff, too, you bet.
Fo', five t'ousand' he in appar'o."
That was all. Baptiste'fl face was the face of a man
whose soul is in other gardens; his language that of a man
too badly frightened t" be anything but natural. The re-
Bpect for the head of the force \v;is even as a grain of
mustard seed in the avalanche- of fear which had swept
him from that red-splashed spot on the Missoula trail to
Golden. â¢
There was no doubt he was telling the truth.
"Who's tall, with a long neck?" asked the major short
ly, turning to the sergeant major, who was standing in
front of his desk.
"I will find out, sir," replied the latter, saluting as he
passed out.
"That long Knglishman, Arvil Santley, has a m-ck like
an eagle; an' Constable Grady says that he's been workln'
the racket to beat two of a kind lately, sir," was the ser
geant major's graphic report when he lined up in front of
the desk again.
"Let Sergeant Hetherington take two constables and
rations for two days and get after this devil before his
tracks get cold. Commence at the body. Send It back to
Golden. Tell Corporal Ball to look up this Santley outfit
in town. If he's got the stuff he'll have It cached some
where about."
Sergeant Hetherington and his merry men picked up
the tracks the tall man told Blazer they would find, and
followed them for many a goodly mile, which time thereof
the tall man with t he long neck was working his way
along the mountain side to the ford. Many miles beyond
Dan Short's place the tracks vanished. Perhaps some one
else had put bags on his horse's feet and led him across
country.
"Corporal" Ball was the official recognition of Mr.
BaM'B efficiency, but "Lanky" Ball was the godless form
of expression his lathlike superstructure provoKed among
the fellows.
"Lanky" Ball was more fortunate than the sergeant;
he discovered something.
Twenty-four hours after he started out he discovered
that lie could not llnd the. man with the neck like an eagle
â Arvil San t leyâ therefore ho had disappearedâ had lit nut
- bad hit the trailâ had packed bis outfit and dusted; these
were the bite <'f local colored knowledge he picked up.
It was from Mammy Nolan, who kept a restaurant in
a big tent and sold whisky on the side, that he found out
about Santley. 'He lit out south yesterday," she said.
"He got steered up agen a skin game at Dan Sort's, an'
they corraled his last remittance from home. It's about
time bo did get out, for they had him stone broke. But ho
was a gent'eman, all the same," said Mammy, as she stood
with her hands on her fat hips and looked up and down
the corporal's ungainly figure.
"What did you want him for? Has he been cracking
some of the constables' heads? He'd do it quick enough
for them if they bothered him."
"1 guess he's done worse than that," said the corporal,
as he mounted his horse and rode away.
"Looks as though he'd done the trick," said the major
when Corpora] Ball made his report.
"He's got a good start and will likely head for the sec
ond crossing on the Columbia and work his way down into
Montana. There's a rough town at the crossing and he's
dead sure to head for that."
And then because the sergeant was away with two
men, and because the whisky men and the gamblers and
those who were cussed simply because they m^J^
it needed much guidance in their daily life, and bec ause
the post was always short of men anyway the major had
to put a special constable on with Lanky Ball to go after
San " You'll 'need a good man. a rustler, to help you take
this ! Englishman .for he's a husky chap." said the major,
'^BuHdâ¢ Barney's the man. sir," replied Corporal Ball.
"Get him," commanded the officer. mU ch tr^ou.
"Lanky" Ball found Carney after, much tribulous
search- found him at Mammy Nolan's, found him amidst
the clamor of many tin lamps, the smoke from which min
gled with the odoriferous steam of frying pork, and filled
the hie tent with a soft, summer-like haze.
When "Lar.kv" Ball explained to him what he was
wanted for. and "that there was a reward of $500. half of
which he would tret if they captured the man who did the
lob he replied r^'Cert, I'll go. for I'm getting stale here
and I need a stake to start in again." .
They rode out ten miles that night BO that they would

was throwing its full glare upon them, and they were
looking into the dark depths of two murderous looking re

"Oh, that's you, Lanky, is it?" he said, cheerfully.
"Glad to see you. Come to pay that fifty, I suppose. Just
put it on the table there. I don't feel like getting up.
That's right, you can take one hand down," he said.
"Just lay your gun down on the table first, though.
Quick, now, cough up that fifty, for you see you re burg

you it will be all right, you know."
Then Lanky put up fifty cases of the good Government

An illustration <>f how neatly the Se

to me to-day by Chief Wilkie himself
during a conversation in his private of

that it was all up with him. We

took him to the military prison and
there, after a severe attack of melan
cholia, he committed suicide by hang

Chief Wilkie is a young man, under
40 years of age. He is the son of
the late distinguished journalist. Franc
Wilkie, whose articles in the Chicago
| Times when Wilbur F. Story was
alive were largely Instrumental in the
success of that newspaper. John Wil
kie followed in the profession of his
father. For a number of years he
was city editor of the Chicago Tribune.
He left Journalism to become mana
ger of Low's Exchange in London and
went from there to the Secret Service.
Not long ago Secretary Gage asked
Wilkie to do a bit of special work for
him. The work required much shrewd
ness and nerve. Wilkie performed the
task so quickly and satisfactorily that
Gage almost took Wilkie's breath
away from him by offering him the
high position he now holds. Wilkie
had had no thought of the place and
was skeptical of his ability to fill it.
But Gage was confident; and that the
selection was good has been abundant
ly demonstrated by the short time it
has taken the young Chicagoan to
practically break up the Spanish spy
system here by capturing its chief op
eratives and exposing, so completely,
the identity of its chief that the latter,
according to the present outlook, will
have to leave his snug harbor in Can
ada and quit this hemisphere.
During times of peace the secret ser
| vice is engaged in looking after crim
inals who take to counterfeiting for a
living. That pursuit in itself is spicy
enough in variety. But the demands of
[ war lend additional bite to the spicy
quality of the service. Shortly after
the Spanish legation left Washington
the War Department received numer
ous reports concerning Spanish spies
and asked Chief Wilkie to look after
them. President McKinley placed five
thousand dollars to Wilkie's credit and
later fifty thousand dollars more to his
credit to carry on his operations. He
was thus enabled to secure a large and
competent force to cover the country
thoroughly; and with the knowledge
that there is plenty more money where
the last came from.
A week or so ago "Billy" Pinkerton,
the famous Chicago detective, was
seen to come from Chief Wilkie's room
and straightway the report went forth
that Pinkerton had been engaged to
assist Wilkie in running down Spanish
spies. The report is wholly incorrect.
In the first place the Government is
prohibited by statute passed by Con
gress just after the Homestead riots
from employing the Pinkertons. In the
second place, instead of going to
help Wilkie with advice. Pinkerton
went to clear his skirts of all suspicion
of being in any way connected with
the Spanish spy system. Prior to the
war Pinkertnn was in the employ of
the Spanish legation, and by his detec
tive ability many filibustering expedi
tions were foiled. It was therefore not
unnatural to think that he might still
be retained by Spain. It is but just
to Pinkerton to say that he demon
strated to Wilkie's complete satisfac
tion that he is a loyal citizen and has
now no connection whatever with
Spain.

SOMETHING NEW IN SCULPTURE THAT IS EXCITING P^RIS.

the society its first payment of 10,000 francs and will finish the figure in marble for his new patron.
whither the very sick are moved.
A tall soldier, a slouch hat pulled
down over a face unnaturally white,
stood next to her.
She raised herself on her tiptoes and
patted his arm lovingly. "One of my
boys," she said, "who came near leav
ing us, but he pulled through and is
going back to camp to-day."
"I didn't pull through; you pulled
me through, and the big fellow awk
wardly put his arms around her and
kissed her forehead.
"Mother told me to," he said, shoving
a crumpled letter into her hands and
beating a hasty retreat.
We sat down and read the letter to
gether. Not a long letter, not one that
would find a place in the "Complete
Letter Writer." Just a few broken,
disjointed sentences that came from
the mother's heart when she heard her
boy had passed the crisis and was ral
lying.
"I get dozens of letters every day
from people I have never even seen.
You can read them while I go in and
attend to my boys."
I read them all. From mothers,
wives and sweethearts, each in a dif
ferent handwriting,' each couched in
different terms, from cities and vil
lages scattered over lowa, but with a
common sentiment running through
them all. Each one asking that should
her loved one be in need Nurse Weeks
would attend to him. Every one send-
ing up a prayer for the safety and well
being of Nurse Weeks.
She cannot answer them. They do
not expect it. But they find comfort
in writing to her.
"I have never seen them," she said
as she gathered up the letters, "but
we are not strangers. We know each
other through the boys.
"There is one now," pointing to a sol
dier sitting in the sun, "whose mother
tucks in a little note for me with every
one of his letters. He ought to be
in now. It's his first day up and he's
been sitting up long enough. Would
you mind calling him?"
I walked over and gave him the
nurse's message. We made our way
slowly toward the cottage, for he was
still painfully weak. Some of the lit
tle children from the hospital were in
the yard on reclining chairs, enjoying
the sun.
One of thf>m sat up as we passed and
in sweet, childish treble, said:
"Ou sick, soldier?"
"Yes, my little lady."
"Me so sorry," and she puckered her
little brow, then, with sudden, sweet
Inspiration, held up a battered looking
doll.
"Ou kiss dolly; she make ou better."
He bent gravely and kissed the doll.
Then, with uncovered head, left a kiss
and a tear that glistened beside it, on
the wan face of the little child.
Inside the cottage I found Miss
Weeks making broth. For, in addi
tion to nursing, she cooks the little ne
cessities that help to coax back life.
Two soldiers who are detailed to help
her stood by. They obey her lightest
word with a military decision that is
prompted by something more than fear
and respect.
And it is this something that is Nurse
Weeks' reward for her days and nights
of toil. For it is toil, ceaseless toil
that would make stone-breaking seem
light in comparison. Back and frtrth
from the cottage to the hospital tent
at the camp, days and nights of stand
ing with a few hours grudgingly
snatched for sleep, constantly caring
and attending to the wants of the
sick.
This something? Gratitude rooted
deep in affection. Every man in the
regiment, from the officers down, would
lay down his life for Nurse Weeks.
She gets no remuneration for her
services. She wears the Red Cross on
her sleeve, but it is the Red Cross that
is the insignia of all in the Hospital
Corps. She is not connected with any-
Red Cross Society.
When the boys. lowa over, were
gathering in Dcs Moines ready to start
for San Francisco, Delia Weeks deter
mined to go with them and help take
care of them.
She had had ten years' experience as
a trained nurse, she was of the right
age, almost 35; she knew many of the
boys personally and had nursed under
Major Matthews, the chief surgeon of
the regiment.
Signed by the Governor of lowa and
the leading citizens and physicians of
Dcs Moines her application to go as a
nurse meandered through a sea of red
tape to Washington, whenco it Slowly
meandered back again, unsigned by the
"powers that be." It came on the
very day that the boys were leaving for
San Francisco.
Then the city of Dcs Moines rose
up. In twelve hours JSOO were
collected. The next day Miss Weeks
left for San Francisco. The lowa boys
gave her a welcome that startled the
seals at the Cliff House.
Her beinp there may not be official.
But she has saved many lives, and the
"quality of mercy is not strained." No
one has questioned her right.
Other regiments would like to have
such a nurse among them. The edict
went forth against women nurses at
the camp when the Red Cross ladles
proposed such a thing. Perhaps it
was just as well, for In the hurry
kurry of its first days the Red Cross
might not have had the opportunity to
choose wisely.
"A woman of the right sort of stuff
is needed in every regiment. If we
could all get women like Miss Weeks
to assist us we could accomplish ten
times as much." And the South Da
kota surgeon looked longingly at the
lowa camp, where Nurse Weeks was
reading the riot act to some boys who
had celebrated pay day by eating of
pies not wisely but too well.
"You should have been here on
Thursday," said the lowan doctor, a
little later. "You could have seen
what the boys think of Nurse." And
though I had not seen it I had been
MISS DELLO WEEKS, SPECIAL VOLUNTEER NURSE, IOWA VOLUNTEERS.
Miss "Weeks is the only woman volunteer nurse that will accompany the Manila expedition. She has been a
trained nurse for ten years and has lived all her life in Dcs Moines, lowa. She knows every one of the soldier lads in,
the lowa regiment. When they were ordered to the front she applied to the Government for an appointment as nurse to
accompany them. Official red tape kept the application on file till the regiment left home. Then the citizens of Dcs
Moines arose as one man to take a hand in the matter. A purse of $500 was raised in one day to equip Miss Weeks
for the journey, and the next day the citizens escorted her to the overland train and sent her flying after the regiment
on its way to San Francisco. She was ordered by them not to leave the boys till they returned from the war. All her
expenses are paid, and all she has to do is to care for the sick and the thousand and one little duties a good woman
can find to do In a soldiers' camp. To the lowans there Is only one woman in the army, and that's Nurse Delia Week*.
She will be sent to the Philippines via Hongkong and will be the first to greet her boys when they reach Manila.
PARIS AGITATED
OVER RODIN'S "LATEST"
His Strange Statue of Balzac Has Divided
the Art WorldâSome Declare It Is a
Masterpiece, Others Call It a Gargoyle.
Special Paris Letter to The Sunday Call.
IN Paris every one prates of art.
The word rolls off fro-m the lips of
a Parisian with a frequency incon
ceivable to the practical, thrifty
American. We who have ceased to
burn candles in our best front rooms
and have progressed beyond the omni
bus for city transportation have never
theless very vague ideas of this exact
ing Parisian divinity.
From the French point of view genius
is of no avail without art, while art is
of much avail without genius. Israfel
would sing in vain for a Parisian au
dience, unless indeed his celestial edu
cation had comprised Parisian meth
ods; and Gabriel, well, I tremble for
him and his trumpet! He will surely
not have a single Parisian at his day
of judgment gathering should he no-t
study a while in Paris and learn the
artistic method of awakening the dead.
The American newly arrived in Paris
is apt to be somewhat mystified by the
frequency of this little word "art," but
will probably set out to discover its
signification without revealing how
much he knows or does not know. He
goes, for example, to a high-class con
cert. In the course of the programme
a lady appears very decollete and very
charming, but who sings in a voice
that he can hardly hear. Deep in his
big American heart he pities her. He
feels sure that she is making herself
ridiculous and wonders why some
friend does not tell her that she cannot
sing. He is making up his mind to ap
plaud for her just to smooth things
over, when 10, a thunder of applause
and yells of "bravo!" The lady is a
success.
"She has no voice," he ventures to re
mark to the individual beside him.
" 'Tis true,*' replies the enthusiastic
Parisian, but she is "tres artistique."
And so our American wanders forth,
still uncertain about the meaning of
"art." However, he need not belittle
his intelligence in the least on that
account.
At present Paris itself is agitated
over the very same thing, and "Quest- j
ce-que l'art?" is the question of the |
hour. The hiruse is divided against it- i
self. The thing that has brought about
this state of affairs stands big and I
white and shapeless at the Exposition
dcs Beaux Arts â it is Rodin's statue of i
Balzac. This pile of plaster, for it is j
not yet done into marble, was ordered
by a certain society of litterateurs, but j
scornfully refused when submitted by j
the sculptor.
Immediately an Intense controversy |
ensued, the result being a wholesale j
advertising of the statue and the sculp
tor.
All through the exposition the statue !
has been the main attraction, and it is
interesting to watch the crowds that :
gather about it. Certain artists and \
their followers are wild in their praise.-?, j
declaring it a work of genius and the
Inauguration of a new idea in art, :
while others are equally ardent in their
denunciation. The uninitiated will In
told of it. Three boys belonging re
spectively to Companies H, D and N
had been given up by the doctors.
Nurso Weeks said that while there was
life therb v p hope. The doctors said
they could to nothing, but good nurs
ing might be of some avail. She saved
the boys, and on Thursday the three
companies, H, D and M, drew up in
military order and saluted Miss Weeks.
Then Chaplain Williams drew forth a
pair of soft tan kid boots, extending to
the knee, and a cap and collar with
the regimental insignia. He present
ed them to her with the compliments
of the boys, and they gave her three
cheers and a tiger, too, that might have
echoed back to lowa.
Nurse Weeks' title Is "Volunteer
Nurse." She was the first "volunteer
nurse" to come forward in this war.
All the other nurses are under the R*d
Cross or Hospital Corps. But during
the last war all the women nurses were
volunteer nurses. "Aunt" Becky
Young was the first of these, and
though she is now a woman long past
the four score years, she has written
a letter to Nurse Weeks, whom she
calls her successor.
Nurse Weeks prefers to do her work
independently. She can go wherever
duty calls and not get entangled in red
tape. The city of Dcs Moines sent her
for the welfare of the lowa boys and
she will stay with them as long as the
war lasts.
When they go to Manila she will go,
too. How, she does not know. She
has the passage money to go to Hong
kong and thence across seas. Per
haps that way, perhaps another. Aunt
Becky Young crossed the Potomac.
every case agree with the society that
refused it. They see in it only a head
emerging from a sack, a snowman or a
specter.
"We have seen pictures of Balzac and
he was not like that," say the realists,
who are, nevertheless, howled down by
the assertion that a sculptor is not a
photographer.
"Let photography depict a man as
he appears to be," say the artists. "It
is our business to depict him as he is â
to represent his character, his genius,
his soul." And so what constitutes
the privileges and the limitations of art
is a nevÂ£r ending discussion about the
pedestal of the Balzac.
Certain it is that the thing conveys
only a suggestion of a human figure.
It is as weird as a Notre Dame gar
goyle, and if artistic at all is surely
wonderfully so and beyond the com
prehension of the ordinary intelligence.
It should either be smashed to pieces
at once or set up and adored. It is
either one thing or the other, the warn
ing of the most abject degeneration in
art or a heaven-born inspiration.
Those who see in it the latter do
not forget that Wagner's operas were
hissed from the Paris stage, that the
pictures of Eugene Delacroix were
laughed at for the "pink" horses that
he painted, or that Puvis de Chavan
nes was at first the jest of the Pari
sians. In these recollections they take
their consolation.
It has been stated that Balzac Is
made to appear as though he were
wrapped in a bath robe. This costume
is explained, however, by the fact that
the novelist always wore while at work
a loose, monkish gown.
Rodin, the sculptor of this unique
affair, has long occupied a leading
place among the artists of France.
This, it seems, is not his first eccentric
ity. At last year's Salon he exhibited
a statue of Victor Hugo, represented as
a heroic figure, sitting in a boat sur
rounded by angels and rowing the boat
himself with one long oar. Even then,
I am told, were heard the prophetio
whisperings of this year's revolution.
The Parisians did not understand the
Victor Hugo, but they adored Rodin
and were not yet prepared to crucify
their divinity.
* * â¢
Even In the artistic world one hears
I complaints of the anti-American feel
| ing. The American artists have re
ceived less recognition than ever at this
i year's Salon, but that the Spanish-
I American war has had anything to do
! with this state of affairs is rather hard
ito believe. 'Tis true that some promi
l nent American artists were quite un
| mercifully "skyed" or relegated to ob
j scure side rooms, but let us rather ac
cuse the Salon committee of poor ar
tistic judgment than of Indulging
I themselves in such petty acts of pre- ;
' judice. Our revenge will be all the
greater, for the former accusation will
! hurt the Frenchman far more serious
: ly than the latter.
But after all we have the "biggest"
â  thing in all the exposition. This is the
'; bronze quadriga by Macmonnies, des
tined for Prospect Park. Brooklyn.
GENEVIEVE GREEN.
, THE WAITER'S WAY OF PUTTING IT.
To a waiter belongs the proud dis
tinction of uttering what is probably
the most ungrammatical sentence ever
evolved from the brain of illiterate
man. One afternoon an old man took
his seat at the table and gave his usual
order to a new and rather case-har
dened knight of the napkin.
"Waiter!" he piped, as the dishes
were slammed down before him, "this
beef isn't sufficiently underdone."
With a smile of contempt the waiter
bore the viands back to the kitchen
window and returned a moment later
without having changed them, and the
contemptuous smile was more notice
able.
"I'm sorry, sir," he said, "we ain't got
no beef what's underdoner."
FOUND Tr|E ENDS.
An Irishman who was out of worlc
went on board a vessel that was In the
harbor and asked the captain if he
could find him work on the ship.
"Well," said the captain, at the same
time handling the Irishman a piece of
rope, "if you can find three ends to.
that rope you shall have some work."
The Irishman got hold of the end of
the rope, and, showing it to the cap
tain, said, "That's one end, your honor."
Then he took hold of the other end, and
showing it to the captain as before,,
said, "And that's two ends, your,
honor." Then, taking hold of both ends
of the rope, he threw it overboard, say
ing, "And, faith, there's another end tq,
it. your honor."
He was immediately engaged.

SOCIETY
SOCIETY still lingers at the sea
side and gives not even a
thought to city life and pleas
ures. The out-of-town season i
gives every promise of being tin- '
usually prolonged this year, and
the indications are that the season of
town festivities will not be Inaugurated |
till late in the fall.
The devotees of fashion are living in the
joys of to-day, giving never a thought of
the days to come, and so the outlook for
the coming autumn days is delightfully
indefinite.

AND HER DROP SKIRT
Bpedal to the Sunday CalL
c-7 oEW YORK, July 15.-The even
'^nJ Ing Plrl of the summer v,-ears a
drop skirt!
jj, ii This sounds a little startling to
the uninitiated, but those who
nrÂ« up on the fashions understand that
flrop" skirt Is a very handsome
skirt lining which Is made free from
â  -s. It hangs plain all around and
is of walking length. It is made of as
r:oe a piece of material as the summer
g!r! can afford.
Tn handsome summer trousseaus every
<â¢:â .;--Â« ha.* a drop skirt. Tt may be a cloth
s or a silk one. or even a velvet skirt,
â  nderneath there will be a handsome
lir.'P sk'rt.
The philosophy of the drop skirt, when
Invented, was that when thin materials
wore worn the underskirt showed
tgh, and therefore a nice lining was
~ary. Finally this Dice lining came
called a drop skirt. It was so pret
ty and so feminine in every respect that
tied great vogue and so. now. w.!i< n
< v.-r you se< a pretty dress you may look
â  r i he drop skirt.
And t". la has given rise to a new fash
hat of lifting the dresa with both
s. Sfearcely .my modish summer wor
nâ  â  â¢: the skirt with
c walks. This raises the
dress material and shows the drop skirt
exposing a beautiful lining.
The effect of these linings is that of
an irregular band of bright trimming
around her dress, so gaily does the drop
skirt show forth beneath.
It looks odd at a hop or on evening oc
casions to see a woman holding up her
handsome thin dress, showing the drop
Bkirt below, yet such is the style.
I saw one in a Bar Harbor ballroom.
It was made of corn flower blue voile
.i saffron colored taffeta silk lining.
Voile, by the way, is a new material
which is, if I may invent the term, a
medley of chiffon and liberty silk. While
thicker than Chiffon it is not quite as
closely woven as liberty silk, and is war
i to hold its lightness and fluffiness
r constant wear longer than any
Bpidery materials now so
much in vogue.
The skirt of this ballroom gown had
two rows of delicate green leaves em
broidered in it a.t intervals of about four
teen Inches. On either side of the em-
Leavee were rows of thickly
red ribbon, which had a dainty
en on both edg< b. The drop
fkirt was faced with crinoline almost half
way the skirt, which made the dress bob
y from side to side as the wearer
walked.
waist was made tight fitting in the
and the front was made into two
box plaits', which bloused slightly
â¢he belt line. The neck was only
v decollete, and was finished
the same ribbon used in the skirt
â¢;,â .. Below the ribbon were three
i. These lapels were cut on the bias
[named with plain satin ribbon, thin
ly gathered, so that they had the appear
f frills. They widened out over the
Iders and almost completely covered
mall puff. The long gloves were of
in kid. stitched with a beautiful
of blue. Two largo, yellow, arti
3juithemums were pinned on the
right Bide of the waist, and around the
throat was a g<>ld chain, with little chains
hanging from it.
i ;â¢ stood against a decorated
i for a moment, looking across the
Bi k of her were bright chrysan
tSi-rruinis upon their paper setting. Her
Â«â¢â¢â¢ââ < s were across the room and there was
â¢â¢ near her, but in each hand she

so lining it that her drop skirt was re-
U is a simple matter to arrange the
surhmer trousseau so that every dress
shall have its drop skirt, without terrible
liture, Th<Â» nicest dresses are made
With the two skirts plaited or gathered
upon the same band, so that they hang
:e, and are to be put on together.
Hut where economy Is desiredâ and dur
lis war summer nearly everybody
doi s desire economyâ the drop skirt may
be put on separately and the dress skirt
â  r it. The result is just as good,
although a multiplicity of bands around a
woman's waist has a tendency to make
i little stouter; but slender women
not take this into acount.
A word must be said for the little neck
trimmings which women wear this sum

mer. They are absolutely primitive in
their simplicity. Bands of plain black
velvet fastened with an old square gold
cUiap, gold chains with little chains hang
ing from them, strings of beads and even
bands of ribbon are worn around the
nock. Trimmings destroy the contour of
the throat and shorten the beautiful long
line between a woman's ears and her
shoulders; but it must be confessed that
those little neok ornaments are very be
coming. They seem to soften the face
ami set it off, as a frame softens, sets off
and brings out a picture.
There is the greatest fancy for artificial
flowers for afternoon and evening. These
como in silk, highly scented, and are as
beautiful as the most perfect originals.
They are. by the extreme of the nowcr
makor's art. shaped and shaded until you
cannot tell them from the natural article.
In many respects they are superior, for
they do not wilt. Natural flowers, on the

you that she much prefers them to the
bare hands. Gloves have a certain ab
sorbent property which is very comfort
able when dancing. They keep the hands
delicate and tender and protect them
from rubbing upon the rough sleeves of
the men's coats. Besides these little per
sonal points, gloves are a matter of eti
quette.
There come this year very nice shoul
der gloves that reach just above the el
bows. These protect the arm and give
it a clothed look which is often more be
coming than the bare arm. With very
short sleeves the shoulder gloves are
highly desirable, and without them no
woman can hope to be a belle in the ball
room.
By the same token a man should wear
gloves in the summer ballroom, and he
who does not do so lays himself open to
criticism. To be sure, he may carry a
handkerchief in his hand to protect the
ladies' dresses, but gloves are more in
taste.
The materials for summer evening
dresses are very numerous. In fact, you
cannot enter a store without being shown
a number of new ones, but aH will be
found to have the same quality, namely,
that of transparency. The gauze goods
continue to lead the evening styles. Any
thin goods, no matter how cheap it may
be, can be made up into a beautiful aft

for nice evening occasions.
A 5-cent mull can be trimmed with
frilled bands of baby ribbon, each frill
edged with narrow lace and with a belt

the nicest and most expensive evening

good lining. The popular linings are
those that are in the new colors and of
these you have a wide and newildering

SHOE-HEEL
STUDIES
DOWN at the heels" is an expression
generally signifying adversity.
Sometimes It is contradictory in
its application. This is proved by
the number of disfigured, dilapidated
heels seen glancing in and out from under
silken petticoats, and petticoats with lace
on them, and I often wonder if their own
ers realize the value, in every sense of
the word, of "a pair of clean heels"â tidy
heels to match their trim ankles and chic
costumes.
"Disfigured heels" are those which re
sult from the heel of the individual bear-
Ing heavily Inward, thus throwing the
heel of the shoe actually outward and
causing it to rest on its inner side, instead
of the, under surface intended. As will be
seen the effect of a rear view is that of
a malformation. Some, observers would

' characterize it as slovenliness. Said an
Intelligent salesman in a prominent shoe
store, in answer to my inquiry as to what
is the reason some women turn their heels
| over and outward when walking:
"Because they are wearing or have
worn shoes that are too short and too
flat for them. The short shoe crowds the
foot back into a curved position, and the
flat sole offers no support for the arch;
1 consequently the ligaments become
' strained and relaxed, that part of the
i foot loses strength and cannot uphold it-
I self, and it naturally turns over and in,
i thus throwing the neel out as you de-
I scribe. I have at least twenty surh cases
i among my customers. They have come
to me in that condition, and I am 'treat
i ing' them by fitting their shoes properly,
' and in some instances I am also obliged
! to reinforce the shoes along the inner side
| of the instep to give the support they
| need when their feet have 'broken down'
"It is a delicate task to remedy the
difficulty, for women are sensitive and do
not like to be told that they have been
wearing shoes too short for them and
have broken down their foot. They do
not bo much mind bolng told their shoes
have been too flat for them, for every
woman likes to believe she has a pretty
Instep. I conveTt and cure them after
a while, though, and their heels are
straight ever afterâ that is. if they con
tinue to wear properly fitted shoes. If
women only would believe how much
prettier a long shoe with a straight heel
looks to 'him' than a short one with a
twisted heel, short shoes would soon be a
drug on the market and we would have
no more cases of lnturned heels to treat.
"A foot will also break down, even if a !
shoe is long enough, if it is too flat. A j
flat or 'common-sense' shoe will break

All fruit should be used without sugar,

PIGTAILS
POPULAR
TWENTY-FIVE and thirty will mas
querade as "sweet sixteen" and
"bread and butter fourteen" this
summer. Tou will hardly credit
this, but It is nevertheless the fact. In
"pigtails," "Gretchen braids," whatever
you please to call them, but sure enough
braidsâ two of them, falling down the
backâ the modern girl is to appear from
now on in the country, in the mornings.
Of course after lunch she will put up
he.r hair in the most proper and precise
coiffure.
What is accomplished by wearing the
hair in long braids is that it is given
what is known as a "rest." Hair experts
have now developed the theory that a
good rest about once a year is what a
head of hair needs.
INDIA LINEN
DESIGNS
SNDIA linen, while not cheap, comes In
such delicate colors this summer that
one is tempted to pay the price and to
economize if necessary on the trim
ming.
At one of the dances given for young
Mrs. Clarence Mackay, a beautiful blonde
wore a dress of almond leaf India linen
with straight cut skirt and a waist that
was a model in severe treatment. It con
sisteti of double box plaits laid front ana
back with embroidery set In between.
The embroidery in this case was black
and was set over this almond leaf green
linen so as to show the design in the lace
to perfection. The embroidery was not
cut out underneath, but was fastened on
Ut'htly to the gown as though it were
woven in it.
Around the foot of the skirt was a Span
ish ruffle in green linen with garlands of
green leaves at the head.
PATRIOTIC
SUNSHADES
THE summer girl of 1898 wears red
jackets, blue skirts and white
stockings when she plays golf or
tennis, or climbs or rows. Red,
white and blue scarfs trim her sailor hats.
Red, white and blue streamers decorate
her bicycles. The national colors appear
tipping her walking sticks. Pinsâ hat pins,
lace pins, every kind and description ot
pinsâ are patriotic, or there Is no excuse
for their being.
The latest patriotic mode put upon the
market has appeared on the counters and
in the shop windows in the form of small
white taffeta parasols stamped all over
with diminutive American flags. Some or
these sunshades have only a border of
flags, while others are composed of red,
white and blue stripes, and others have a
striped border of the national colors.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
CALL SUBSCRIBER, NEVADA CITY.
â The "no" in last Sunday's paper was in
answer to a question asked me by another
"Call Subscriber." Your letter came too
late to receive attention last week. The
preparation you refer to can be analyzed,
of course. Any competent chemist can do
this for you, and the cost will be about
$25. Nearly all face bleaches contain cor
rosive Biiblimate which is, in itself a
deadly poison. It is extremely risky put
ting anything upon the face that could
not be taken into the stomach, for poisons
are absorbed into the system, through the
pores of the skin, just as thoroughly as
through the stomach.
READER OF THE CALL.â Here is a
freckle lotion: Sal ammoniac (powdered)
I~dram; distilled water 1 pint; eau do
cologne 2 fluid drams. You might try
this, but as you say yours are the "all
year round" kind I doubt If it will remove
them. Nothing but an application of
some good beauty paste, kept on for sev
eral clays to fade them out. will do for
them. I have given directions several
times for treatment for blackheads. To
increase the growth of the eyebrows trim
once in a while just the least tiny bit,
and use this wash: Get one ounce of al
cohol and in it dissolve five grains of qui
nine. Apply this every "other night and
on the other nights massage very gently
with the fingers dipped In pure olive oil,
slightly warmed.
LENA A.â There is nothing that will
remove superfluous hairs satisfac
torily unless it is the electric needle, and,
as 'I have said before, even that some
times fails. If the growth is fine and not
too abundant apply prepared chalk and
pluck it out in bunches with the fingers,
which have also been dipped in the chalk.
N.â l can't make out the first name that
you signed In your letter. You must have
seen in previous issues of the Sunday Call
full directions for treatment of pimple*
and blackheads. If you have not. write
to me, inclose stamp, and I will write it
out once more. For the chapped lips
and rough skin use cold cream, formula
for which has been given several times.
For information as to thin brows and
lashes, read answers to Reader of The
Call and Mona " Earl. Rub the brittle
' nails 'each night before going to bed â with
I a good cold cream, rubbing it well into
j the nails, so that it is absorbed. Extreme
i brittleness sometimes comes from wasn
ing the hands too often.
MISS MONA EARL.â Corn flower water
: is the only thing I know of that will make
I the eye lashes grow. Steep sixty-five
grains of the corn flowers (bruised) in ono
quart of water for twenty-four hours.
Strain and distill. Bathe the lashes in the
liquid thus obtained. I can tell you of <
, nothing that will make the eyes appear i
I larger than they are, or that will darken
i their color. I cannot recommend adver- I
i tised remedies, or an\ thing that I do not
', know the ingredients of.
| AURORA FLOYDâ Here is the formula
for a pure face powder.
One-quarter pound of pure rice
powder (Lubin's preferred)
Six drops oil of rose
Three grains of carmine.
Mix by sifting over and over again.
Don't, I beg of you, use a .pencil to
darken the eyebrows. There is something
indescribably common in such a practice,
and it gives one a most uncleanly appear
ance.
Try suggestion given to Reader of the I
Call.
Jf this does not do. then use the least
harmful hair dye that you can find. How
ever, dont apply anything to the eye
lashes, as there is danger of its getting I
into the eyes. â¢

Just nne emblem is to be. the -fashionâ the

your skin, no doubt, is the result of you:

little can be done for the scar and broke;

advise you to bathe the side of the nosi
frequently in witch hazel to reduce tin

As for the coarse pores, they are very ob

mula for a sulphur wash that is said t(
be excellent. It clears the skin and slow
ly draws the pores closer together:
Precipitated sulphur, 1 dram.
Ether, 4 drams.
Alcohol, 3-2 ounces.
Rub this into the skin at night, jus
beii ire going to bed.
Where there is a tendency to coarsi
pores, the face should- never be washec
in hot water. I would try these hom<
remedies first if I were you, and then
if special treatment seems necessary. ',

MR. SPENCER TRASK is the author of a little
book, which Messrs. Putnam will publish next
w>ek, of real value, not only to New Yorkers, but
to racial philosophers who take an interest In ob
serving how small things prow into great.
The subject and title of this book Is the fam
aup "Bowling Green," which, humble in its beginnings,
formed the nucleus of what, without undue or blatant
pride, New Yorkers may recognize us the urban master
t the â¢ itant universe. To paraphrase Walton's Dr.
Ã¼btless God might have made a better city than
New Fork, hut doubtless he never did. Consequently
Dowling Green, as the gi rm i C this splendid metropolitan
phenomenon, acquires a special historical, biological and
political supremacy among all th. holy places of the earth.
Mr. Trask has gone into the subject with the enthusi
asm of a true patriot. Ho lias enlisted the services of Mr.
E. W. Kemble and oT Helios himself in the form of the
camera, which is Helios' recognised representative in
â¢:, art. He has produced a booklet that Is full of
. artistic and statistical charm.
He begins by reminding us that there is no piece of
land on Manhattan Island which has retained for a longer
I its distinctive name and at the same time fulfilled
more thoroughly the purposes of Its creation than the
small park at the extreme southern end of Broadway
known as Bowling Green. It is the one historic spot which
bas never lost Its Identity or been diverted from public n*e
the foundation of the city.
The history of the city from the time when the good
ship Pea Mew sailer', into the bay. May 6, IC>26, bearing the
doughty Dutch Governor, Peter Minuetâ with no city and
is yet to governâ might almost be written from
what has been seen and heard from this, small plat of land.
The West India Company was chartered by the States
ral of Holland in 1621. In 1625 enough capital had been
I and enough colonists had been obtained to warrant
the company in beginning to avail itself of the privileges
grantedâ of exclusive trade along the whole Atlantic coast
: iverejgn power. The first act of the honest
Dutchman on that May morning was to call together the
Manhattan tribe of Indians, probably on the very site of

There he exchanged for the whole. island, named after
the trii.. (estimated at that time to contain "11.000 Dutch
mnr;:- i 22,000 acres), a ijuantlty of beads, trinkets,
I at 60 guilders, or about $24â a sum far less than
square I" >ot of any portion of that land would now
it worth. From this sharp bargain was to grow the city
ned to be the commercial metropolis of the
new continent and the second largest city of the world.
In order to h sure peaceable possession a fort was built,
B( emlngly under the direction of one Kryn Frederycke.
and In 1635 a larger one was erected at the contract "price
. It was 300 feet long and 250 wide. This inclosed
vernor's house, barracks, and later the church. The
contract for the building of the church required it to be of
"rock stone," 12 feet long, f>2 feet broad, and 16 feet high.
Th.- pri< c was Sl'Tki. This fort occupied the space between
â  ailed Whitehall, Bridge. State and Bowl
ing Green. The sally port was at the north.
The large open space opposite the sally port was set
apart first under the name of "The Plaine," and after
ward under the more famous and permanent one of Bowl
ing Green. It held a place of great importance in the
annals of the ci^y In times of peace and times of war.

companye (except* one boye) to come to their forte, where
they staide about twoehoures and the Governor com
matide his gunner to made ready three pieces of ordnance
and shott them off for the Prince of Orange, and sprede
the Prince's coloures. Whereupon Jacob Elekins, the mer
chant's factor of the Shippe, the William. commanGe Will
iam Fforde of Lymehouse (the gunner) to go abord the
Shippe and sprede her coloures and shoote off three peeces
of ordnance for the Kinge of England."
Then Jacob Elekins coolly sailed up the river In defi
ance of the guns of the fort. Thunderstruck at such an
act of temerity, Van Twiller summoned all the people to
"The Plaine." where he ordered a cask of wine and an
other of beer to be rolled out. Filling a glass, he called on
all good citizens to drink a health to the Prince of Orange
and confusion to the English.
Here, after two years of a bloody and savage war with
the surrounding Indians, during which the island was al
most depopulated, the farms destroyed and many adjacent
settlements obliterated, the sachems of all the hostile
tribes assembled August 30. IG-45. smoked the calumet of
peace and buried the tomahawk, pledging eternal friend
ship to the whites.
In 1641 Governor Kieft established two annual fairs for
the encouragement of agriculture, the first for cattle, to
begin October 15, and the second for hogs, to begin Novem
ber 1. These were ordered to be held "att the markett
house and plaine afore the forte." They
wen- the (Treat annual events of the city,
forerunners of the Hors" Fair and the
Dog Show. One inducement held out to
attract strnngors was that no one should
be liable to imprisonment for debt during
the continuance of the fair.
In a map of 1763 we find Greenwich street
has been opened, the Bowling Green being
then laid down in the shape of a triangle.
The land beside the fort, on the oast ami
west sides, was anciently called "T"
Marckvelt." or "The Market-field." from
Its vicinity to the markets then held on
the "Plaine," or Bowling Green. The por
tion on the east is now Whitehall street.
The name "Market-field." however, re
mains in connection with the small street
originally running from Whitehall to
Broad, formerly called "Petticoat lane,"
a part of wheh has since been obliterated
to make room for the present Produce
Exchange. The name "Whitehall" orig
inated in a large storehouse on the corner
of White-hall and State streets, built by
Peter Stuyvesant: afterward falling into
the hands of Governor Dongan. he named
It the "White Hall." This subsequently,
for a little while, became the Custom
House of the city, which later was moved
to No. 1 Broadway.
This plat of land. No. 1 Broadway, was
originally owned by a widow. Annetje
Keeks, who for years kept a tavern here.
In 1759 Captain Kennedy, afterward Earl
of Cassttlfs, built on this corner a man
sion, which was destined to be famous for
many years. The garden in its rear ex
tended to the Hudson River. Captain
Kennedy, returning to England prior to
the Revolution, left the property to his
son Robert, from whom it passed to Na
thaniel Prime, a leading banker of the eitr. In the spring
of 1776 General Lee. and afterward General Putnam, oc
cupied this house as ttfeir headquarters, and, for a time,
Washington. During the occupancy ot *ne city by the
English. Sir Guy Carleton and other British officers" lived
here. Mr. Isaac Sears, one of the prominent "Liberty
Boys," lived in it subsequent to the Revolution. He was
commonly called "King Sears," and his daughters "the
Princesses." Afterward it was taken by Mrs. Graham for
a girls' school, and later it was known as the best board
ing house in the city. For many years It was called the
Washington Inn. In 1881 it was torn down, and the pres
ent structure, known as the Washington building, was
erected by Cyrus Field. After the land at the rear of
these houses was extended a house was built tn what had
been the garden of the Kennedy house, in which Robert
Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat, lived and died. At
No. 3 Broadway Jnhn Watts, one of the Governor's Coun
cil, lived. His daughter was the wife of Archibald Ken
nedy.
Next to this was a famous tavern known originally as
the King's Arms Tavern, which changed its name to
Burns' Coffee House during the Revolution. As late as
1860 the same building was still standing, bearing the title
of "The Atlantic Gardens."
On August 26, 1776. New York city was captured by the
EngHsh. Shortly after the occupancy of the British a
great fire occurred, destroying 492 houses, nearly one
eighth of the entire city. The houses at the lower end of

pleasant one.
Last Monday night the district deputy
and her grand officers installed the offi
cers of Loyal Rebekah Lodge in public.
The hall was profusely decorated with
flowers and evergreens, and above the
station of the noble grand there was a
white dove with outstretched wings, bear
ing in its talons an olive branch, indica
tive of the peace that prevails in the
lodge. The noble grand for the current
term is Miss Flora D. Linehan; vice
grand. Miss Tillie Brower, and recording

the ceremony Mrs. Warren, the retiring
past noble grand, was presented a beau

saved.
The Green again welcomed the joyous and exultant
crowds who were gathered to see the final evacuation of
the city by the British on November 25, 1783. Before leav
ing, the English had nailed their defeated colors to the
flagpole which stood near, and In the hope of preventing
the immediate raising of the Stars and Stripes, had thor
oughly greased the pole. Captain John Van Arsdale, how
ever, quickly managed to climb the pole, and in sight of
the departing troops flung our flag to the breeze. Even
since then it has been the custom for one of his descend
ants, on the morning of Evacuation day, to raise the flag
on the present liberty pole in the park.
In a map of 1797 the Bowling Green has assumed its
present shape, the fort has disappeared, the Government
house, above referred to, occupying its site, and the Bat
tery has been extended, but even yet the "order" given
seventy years before for the laying out of additional
streets had not been complied with except as to Greenwich
street, showing that municipal progress was not much
more rapid at that time than now. The destruction of the
fort seems to have been determined upon in 1789. when, by
act of the Legislature, "The ground at the fort and the
Battery was reserved for the public use and for continuing
the Broad Way through to the river." This last was never
done.
In 1790 It was "Ordered, That Messrs, Torbos, Van Zant
and George Janeway be appointed commissioners to su
perintend the taking down the stone and removing the
earth of the fort." The earth thus removed was used to
enlarge the area of the Battery "from Eli's corner to the
Flat Rock."
Mr. Trask reminds us that from the earlist New Am
sterdam days Bowling Green and its immediate neighbor
hood had been the most select and fashionable parts of
the city. "As the natural growth of the city and the en-

croachment of business drove private residences farther
and farther northward, this particular row of houses fac
ing the Green preserved its individual characteristics, and
was used as dwellings. They still retain their exterior ap
pearance, though they have ceased to be so used. They
are now occupied by the offices of the large foreign steam
ship companies, which has given them the name of 'Steam
ship Row.' Some years ago it was ordered by Congress
that this land should be bought and the United States
Custom House be built here. Opposition and litigation
have until now prevented, but at last it seems likely that
this project will be accomplished, and this land, which had
always been public property until 1815. and upon which the
old Custom House had been for a time located, will again
become the property of the public, and in place of a fort
emblem of strife and distrust among nationsâ a custom
house, suggestive of peaceful intercourse and friendly
commerce, will be built, worthy of the nation and of the
city."

ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONS OF MONEY.
By Senator William M. $tewart.
SENATOR STEWART has written a book about
money and In doing so takes, incidentally, rather a
forlorn view of the prospects for the rising genera
tion.
In his introduction to his book, which he calls
"The Analysis of the Functions of Money," Senator Stew
art says: "This little volume is dedicated to the young
men and women of the United States who are contem
plating matrimony, with its inevitable responsibilities. The
comforts of life with which the young w^men of this
country have been surrounded in the homes of their fa
thers built in the better days of the Republic, cannot be
provided by the young men of the present day on account
of the hard conditions which environ them. The ramiliea
and friends of young women oppose their marriage with
young men otherwise worthy on account of the fear that
it will be impossible for the united efforts of both to save
them from poverty and want. The author believes that a
careful study of this book will enable the people, through
the intelligent exercise of the elective franchise, to restore
the conditions enjoyed by former generations when happy
homes were established throughout our
vast domains. If this can be accomplished
the barrier which fear of poverty has
erected between the young men and
women of the country will be removed
and the sacrament of marriage will again
promise happiness, prosperity and prog-
The vital statistics of Nevada are not
at hand, if, indeed, there are any, so we
cannot say whether there have been any
sacraments of marriage there or not since
the crime of 73, but we think that there
have been a few weddings in other States.
Humorists always have inclined to the
belief that the barrier between the young
men and women of this country has been
perfected by the father's gun or the fam
ily bulldog. It Is noteworthy to find that
Senator Stewart, himself a notorious hu
morist, takes another view of this serious
matter. . -
As to another point raised by him there
can be no dispute. It is well known that
there are no happy homes in our vaF* do
mains. Therefore, it was high time that
a wise and great man should arise, in our
midst, so to speak, and write a book
which will restore the better days of the
republic. Fortunately this is easy enough.
As he says himself, all that is necessary
is to read his book and then to exercise
the franchise intelligentlyâ that . is, of
course, vote his way.
As to the. book itself, while it does not
cast the direct and fierce white light that
might have been expected from the intro
duction on the. subject".of happier homes
and better days it is v replete with great
â  truths, thus: ."No human happier homes
and better days It Is replete with great
truths, thus: "No human being was ever
able to prolong his existence for any con
siderable time without the use. of , what others produce.
Men must live in society or perish. If ever a tribe of sav
ages existed without using sticks, shells or some. kind of
token as money, the fact has. not been recorded and the
possibility of such existence Is denied."
While these and similar statements leave the ; barrier
between the young men and the young women of the coun
try unbroken, not to mention the serious trouble with the
marriage sacrament in Nevada, it will be plain to all
thinking persons that free silver is the only remedy.

NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
On the night of the 9th tnst. the officers
of La Estrella Parlor were installed by
Deputy Mrs. T. Lunstedt, assisted by Mrs.
Lena B. Mills, the grand marshal, and
Mrs. L. Carlie, acting as grand past pres
ident. After the ceremony the deputy
was, in appreciation of the effective man
ner in which she discharged her duties,
presented with a large bouquet of choice
red, white and blue flowers, after which
there was an adjournment to an adjoin
ing hall, where there was spread a splen
did collation. There were addresses by
the district deputy, a song by Mrs. Carlie
and a short talk by the Friend of the Na
tive Daughters.
The same evening the officers of Oro
Fino Parlor were installed by Deputy
Mrs. J. Steinbach, assisted by Mrs. Dillie
Bradley as marshal and Mrs. French as
past president.
On the night of the 6th Deputy Mrs. G.
Baker, assisted by Mrs. H. M. Green as
P. G. P., Mrs. G. C. Ryan, G. S., and Mrs.
Barton marshal, installed the officers of
Golden State Parlor in that precise and
dramatic style for which she is noted. At
the close of the installation Mrs Baker
on behalf of the parlor presented- to Mrs.
B. Denahey, the retiring president, half a
dozen solid silver fablespoons and a like
number of teaspoons. The affair, which
was private, was followed by .a collation.
Besides the grand officers named, there
was present Miss Montague of Fremont
Parlor.
On the Fourth Mrs. Maria Day, hon
orary member of Golden State Parlor, was
visited by the following named members:
Miss L. and J. Meyer, F. yon Staden, Mrs.
C. Day, Mrs. D. de La.no, Mrs. M. Bur
dick, Miss J. Denis and Miss R. Day, to
congratulate her on her seventieth birth
day and also to make her a number of
presents. After this there was an ad
journment to the lawn where under the
graceful folds of the American flag re
freshments were servjed.
Last Thursday night the officers of
Orinda Parlor were installed in public in
Shasta Hall in the presence of a large
number of invited guests. The hall was
artistically decorated with flowers and
bunting and this was heightened by the
aggregation of pretty- faces and attrac
tive costumes of the officers who were be
ing installed. Mrs. Thedore Lunstedt waÂ»
the installing officer and she performed
her work in a manner that far exceeded
any previous effort in that line, and won
for her many warni words of commenda
tion. It appears to be the ambition of
this very energetic Native Daughter to
excell in this work, and it looks very
much as if her ambition will be gratified.
She was assisted by Mrs. Mocker as P.
glad when the climax of their villainy is reached and they
are borne away to slaughter.
The dominating rascal, however, is the hypocritical
Calisto, the fellow who killed his master and stole his
property, and is now trying to get possession of the little
Comtesse d'Ambrun. Indeed, he does get possession of
her, and how she gets safely away from him is a good
story, as good as any told of those dreadful times by
Alexandre Dumas or Victor Hugo.
Gras conducts his narrative of hairbreadth escapes and
carnage in a bold, free, but sincere way, and with a lov
ingly lingering touch on the incidental domestic scenes.
He is not the finest kind of an artist, and his needless
dwelling on painful details of bloodshed seems to indicate
the simplicity and crudity of his nature. But stories of
the French Revolution are never nice, and surely these
savage, treacherous brutes Gras brings before* us are not
worse than the Spanish soldiers who fired on our wounded
men and their surgeons and nurses in the field hospitals
before Santiago. Truth !s still stranger than fiction. The
portrayal of Marat in this story is particularly horribleâ a
thing to dream aboutâ and the gross savagery of the scene
of the execution of Louis XVI is set forth in bold primary
colors. In the translation there are one or two curious
slips, such as the use of 'without" for "unless' 'and the
employment as an equivalent for Provencal patois of such
a hopelessly inharmonious phrase as "a dead giveaway."

with numerous typical characters and unfolds incidents

purpose of rendering the picture true to nature. William

AFTER reading a half-column In the
Chicago Time&Heraldi In which in
glowing anil enthusiastic language
the fact is heralded that the lake
city is not .to be left "entirely in the
doldrums 11 by reason of the forthcoming
appearance of .:.o "genuine Buffalo Bill
Wild West show," we can regard the Bit
uation in San Francisco with a greater
degree of satisfaction. It is hard to con
ceive that the big Windy City could be
thus shaken up from center to circum
ference like a country town by the an
nouncement of a. coming circus. How
ever, such is the strange condition, as
witness the following from the journal
refertjed to:
"II our war plays are glvin-* way to the
various contingencies of the season there
is an alluring note of comfort in the an
nouncement that Buffalo Bill and the fa
mous Wild West will Boon bo in our sum
nur-heutcd midst. This is something
more than a sop to Cerberus, -i is not a
makeshift, but a genuine bundle of ex
citement for the nerves, than which there
is nothing else, except battle, so stirring.
It was in the Wild West that the title of
mush riders, now famed through â¢ that
first baptism of lire in Cuba, was coined,
ami in this famous show may be seen in
eac-simile selected men from ail the rough
riders of the world."
Evidently Chicago is easily amused if
acowboy show is awaited w. . real anx
iety and regarded as a "genuine bundle
of excitement for the nerves, than which
. there is nothing else except battle so
stirring." A glance at the class and va
riety of entertainment offered in that city
at ihe Bent time may account for the
above described excitement. The attrac
tions are: Hopkins' "Old Glory" and
vaudeville; Chicago Opera House, vaude
ville- Coliseum Garden, Pain's fireworks;
The ' l\,-rrls Wheel, variety and music;
The Water ..i.-.s, specialties; Masonic
Roof theater, vaudeville; Thielmann'9
Garden, Bendix orchestra; Bismarck
Garden. Bunge orchestra; Sam T. Jack's.
"ns other words they are confined to
vaudeville, music and fireworks, while we
have three regular theaters, opera, vaude
ville, several palatial music halls and the
Chutes. Furthermore the Baldwin is to
reopen soon with a number of high class
plays to present; the New Comedy
Theaterâ formerly the Bushâ is to throw
open its doors next month, promising a
lung list of standard attractions, and the
New Alhambra Theater, at Jones and
Eddy streets, is expected to have its
grand opening about August 15. A long
list of star vaudeville artists has been
secured and the best of this branch ot
entertainment is promised, with vulgar
ity and other objectionable features elim
inated.
With these facts in view and the com
ing of the presentation of such plays as
'The Prisoner of Zenda," "Secret Ser
vice," "Charity Ball" and the new war
drama, "A Gallant Surrender, the out
look is encouraging.
In discussing the situation in the theat
rical world the leading dramatic journal
of New York makes the following en
tertaining observations: "There was for
a time â ..â¢! absolute stagnation of enter
prise,. and,- therefore, no promise of
dramatic novelties, and the assurance
that under such a condition the public
would suffer a curtailment of its enter
tainment strrred the newspapers to com-;
ment that was by no means complimen
tary to those responsible for the condi
tion.. The past month, however, has wit
tress'ed a change in theatrical matters
that argues for an approach to a pros
perous state of amusements next season.
Individual enterprise â¢ is. making itself
manifest again, and independence in busi
ness policy is evident in most of 'lie new
ventures ' that have been announced â  re
cently."

are left In doubt as to the quality of the

is announced for production by the.Fraw
ley Company at the Columbia Theater on
the 25th butt The play has been in course
of preparation for some time past and
the management promises one of the
most elaborate of war play productions
staged in many days. The play was es
pecially written for the Frawley Company
by Edward B. Kidder, the celebrated au
thor, best know n by his success. "A Poor
Relation. ''Peaceful Valley" and "Tom,
Dick and Harry."
The. local attractions for the coming
week include: "Liberty Hall" at the
Columbia: "The Bella of Corneville " at
tha rivoli; "Captain Impudence" at the
Grand Opera House; "Faust, 1 ' at the Al
iizar. and new acts at the Orpheum,
Olympla and Chutes.
The Golumbia.
The Columbia Theater management
and the Frawley company have reason to
congratulate themselves upon the suc
cess of the laughable comedy, "Lostâ
Twenty-four Hours." It has' not only
produced an overflowing measure of
laughter, but has made substantial re
turns that account for the genial smiles
that play over the features of the treas
urer these days. However, this produc
tion will hold the boards for this week
only and will be followed on Monday
night next by the Empire Theater suc
cess, "Liberty Hall," from the pen of R.
C. Carton. It la a clever comedy that
had a run of a hundred nights at the
above named theater In New York. The
story follows:
Sir Norman Chllwnrth has died, leav
ing his two daughters, Blanche and Amy,
penniless, the estate passing to a cousin
whom the girls have never seen, and who
is understood to be traveling abroad.
Presently, as the dispossessed young la
dies are on the point of going" out into
the world, a letter is brought to them
frum the new baronet by a Mr. Owen
begging them to stay at the old place un
til the writer's return. The terms of the
communication are not unkindly, but the
Chil worths are proud, and since old Mr
Todman. who had "had the presumption"
as a very young man to marry a connec-
; tlon of the family, offers them a home,
; the girls resolve to accept the hospitality
! of the "Bloomsbury" abode rather than
! live upon the bounty of a stranger.
In the second act all the parties con
cerned are transferred forthwith to old
Mr. Todman's bac* parlor, scene of the
last three acts. The mysterious Mr.
i Owen is none other than the new baro
net himself, who has come over in dis
guise to sco how matters stand. He falls
lin love with the high-spirited Blanche
and resolveÃ, like the Lord of Burlelgh,
to win her without the aid of wealth or
station. To this end he also takes up his
quarters under the bookseller's roof as a
simple employe. By so doing the young
squire handicaps himself heavily in his
endeavors to win the affections of his
| haughty cousin, but his manliness and
I devotion prevail, and the progress of the
j contest is followed with Interest and
sympathy. Mr. Owen will be played by
Bdward M. Brll, while the haughty
Blanche will be intrusted to Madeleine
Hmiton. who. no doubt, will give a very
i intelligent and attractive portrayal of the
role. The sister. Amy, and her lover, the
Hon. Gerald Harringay, will be -resented
by Fanchon <"amt>bell and T. l>anlel
Frawley. respectively, while old Todman
> will doubtless bo made quite an attractive
1 and clear out character portrayal by
Theodore Roberts. The maid of all work
Crafer, whose every effort is to make life
unpleasant for those- around her, will be
i interpreted by Eleanor Carey. Other
rolea will be -layed by John T. Burke
| Robert O. Wilson, Louis Payne, Maude
Winter. Clarence Livingston, David Con
ger and Edward G. Conway. The play
calls for and will be accorded a particu
, laxly attractive stage setting, showing
the second-ha-nd book store or old fod
man in Bloomsbury.

"The Romany Rye," with James Brophy |
In the leading role, has drawn large audi- j
ences during the past week, but it will be j
withdrawn after to-night's performance. |
On Monday night will be given the first j
presentation at popular prices of F. Mil- i
ton Royle's comedy war drama, "Captain I
Impudence," which received a cordial in- I
dorsement during its former presentation j
at the California Theater. The play deals |
with a very pretty love story, embracing j
many comic details, the scene of action j
being in Mexico during the time that
Uncle Sam was Invading the "land of !
Manana." The advance of an attacking
force of Mexicans and the subsequent
storming of C'hapultepec by the American !
forces constitute the most stirring scenes .
of the play.
The action begins just before the bat- j
tie of Buena Vista. Jovlta Talamanca, j
a Mexican girl. Is held prisoner on parole
in the American camp. She has fallen in
love with Captain Shields of the Ameri
can army, who she thinks Is in lovo j
with her. but who really loves Lucretla
Bugg, the daughter of the major of his |
regiment. A number of complicationa
cause Jovita to discover that the captain
does not love her, and also leaxl her to
believe that he has spoken lightly of her
to his fellow soldiers. Jealousy, assisted
by a Mexican named Major Genara Mcn
doza, prompts her to seek revenge. Shu
is discovered In an attempt to play tha
spy, but Shields permits her to escape.
He is about to be court martialed wheu
she returns and makes amends for her
wrong doing, bringing the play to t*
happy ending.
Comedy is more in evidence than seri
ousness throughout the play, and theru
are many amusing scenes. The produc
tion will be made under the direction of
the author.
The y\lcazar.
It is with appropriate pride that the
Alcazar management call attention to thÂ»
fact that the reproduction of "Fauat" has
not only filled the house nightly, but has
made it necessary to turn people away.
In these times of dullness this is some
thing phenomenal and goes to show tha
high appreciation in which the present
company is held. "Faust," where pre
sented by incapable players, is a fear
fully and wonderfully bad thing to wit
ness, but the play as adapted and mod
ernized by Lewis Morrison is a work of
art, deeply impressive and highly enter
taining. His conception of the charac
ter of Satan runs the gamut of human
emotions and while an engrossing object
lesson is at the same time suffioinntly
amusing. The character of Marguerite
as delineated by Miss Florence Roberts
is conceded to he among the best. The
picture she gives of the young and In
nocent maiden, whose beauty Is her ruin,
is one long to bo remembered by thoss
whose fortune it is to see it. Other mem
bers of the company are doing Justice
to their respective roles, and with per
fection In settings, mechanism and elec
trical effects, "Faust" is being mosi
handsomely presented.
Our old, -well beloved but lachrymose
friend "East Lynne" will succeed
"Faust."
Jhe Orpheum.
For the coming week the new bill will
Include Wilton and Stack, said to be the
world's greatest horizontal bar perform- i
ers, and who have been brought direct
from the Empire Theater, London, for
the Orpheum circuit. Not 30 very long !
ago these men were well known in San j
Francisco as among the cleverest ath
letes of the Olympic Club. Since they
have begun their professional career they
have attained fame and are now classed
among the very best acrobats , in their
line In the world. Valmore is said to be i
a great European novelty and his line j
of work is certainly unique. He has de
veloped his vocal organs to such a degree
that he imitates all. sorts of musical in- !
struments and does it cleverly. He is !
credited with giving a very artistic and ;
interesting performance. Gilbert and
Goldie is another pair of San Francisco
boys who have gathered fame and laurels \
during the past year. Recently they |
have played the best vaudeville houses i
throughout the East and they come to j
the Orpheum with an entirely new line j
of songs, jokes, gags and grotesque com- j
edy. During this week Joseph Hart will
Introduce his famous song of songs, i
which was such a hit with him In his
Gay Old Boy company. Bert Coote and
Julie Kingsley will appear in their clever i
one-act comedy entitled "Supper for i
Two." Some new dances are promised
by Fleurette, the charming little Terp- j
sichorean artiste, and Mrs. Alice J. Shaw !
and daughters, the whistling prima don
nas, begin the last week of their engage- !
ment and will appear in an entirely new
repertoire. Lorcnze and Allen, grotesque j
dancers and comedians, are also new, and
are said to be exceptionally clever. They
complete what would appear to be a most
attractive bill.
Jhe Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall offers what Is
claimed to be "a great new bill" for this
week. Among the new features are Gib
son and Allen, a clever acrobatic song
and-dance team; Flossie Mashe. songs,
dances, high klcKing, etc.; Ordway and
Rand, tht: tramp and the bicyclist; Maud
Rockwell; the Royce Sisters; Quasina,
the male La Loie Fuller, and others.
Matinee to-day.
Ghutes and Zoo.
The programme at the Chutes is con
stantly Increasing in merit, and the bill
of next week is one of the strongest ever
offered at the Haight-street grounds. It
will Include Joe Hall, a female Imper
sonator and terpslchorean wonder, who
does an extraordinarily clever act; the
Mazuno Tokio troupe of Japanese juÂ»
glers; May Lannlng, a singing soubrette;
]>ora Mervyn. soprano, and Colby and
Way, the "ventriloquist and the dancing
doll, who have- been mnking such a nil
on the Orpheum circuit. Sam Friedlandei,
musical comedian, will be retained and a
new set of moving war and humorous
pictures will be shown. Henri Maurice
Cannon, the big Swiss, has been re-en
gaged for a limited season and will re
ceive visitors every afternoon and even

ally, and Wallace, the largest lion in

Many of these artists are new to vau
deville, and all stand highest in their re
spective lines. It is the determination
of the management that nothing coarsely
sensational or in the line of mediocre
shall be seen or heard at the Alhambra,
To Dr. Kannet is due the credit of be
ing the first vaudeville manager to make
a contract with the charming Cofinne.
The salary he agrees to pay the great
favorite is said to be the largest ever
given a single artistâ sl2so per week being
the cool figure at which she values her
appearance for about fifteen minutes
every evening. The six famous Les Ar
bras, European marvels, that are aston
ishing all Europe at present with their
wonderful equilibristic feats, are coming
our way, direct from Chinizelli's Impe
rial Circus of St. Petersburg, Russia, and
at an enormous figure, transportation
alone amounting to more than $2000.
Work on the Alhambra Theater is now
progressing rapidly. New lceas and sug
gestions are being carried out every day
regardless of labor or expense, as it is
the declared determination of the board
of directors to make this playhouse not
only more beautiful and comfortable than
any in San Francisco, but the safest.
The ventilation will be the best, owing
to the fact that the edifice stands by it
self on a corner of the street, and has all
modern mechanical devices for keeping
the place full of pure air.
In the way of protection to human life,
no theater in the West is its counterpart,
there being on vie ground floor alone ten
exits opening into the street, besides two
exits direct from the balcony to the j
street. The house will accommodate more
than 2800 people, and can be emptied in
less than two minutes.
The management is paying particular
attention to new and varied electrical ef
fects, to which the Moorish architecture
or the edifice lends itself most gracefully.
The newest in European and American
theatrical improvements is being adopted,
as shown by the pleasing arrangement of
the so-called "Belle Etage" boxes situ
ated on the first row of the balcony.
While these boxes command the best
view of the stage and house, three and
four of them can be thrown together for
the convenience of partiesâ a most wel

READING
FINGER
PRINTS
(Continued from Page Eighteen).
that this method of identification may
be of great use when it becomes exten
sively adopted by the police depart
ments of our large cities.
The study of finger prints is so fas
cinating a pastime and is in addition
so inexpensive that it is surprising
that it has not been more extensively
carried on. It is not so long ago that
the collection of autographs was such
a popular craze that one or more auto
graph albums were to be found in ev
ery household. Although some individ
uals profess to be able to read a man's
character by examining his signature,
yet the autograph is a product of edu
cation and training, and an artificial
style may be cultivated, while a finger
print is an autograph which is pos
sessed at birth and remains unaltered
throughout lifeâ it is the signature of
the man himself, stripped of all the re
sults of education and training, and
which cannot be artificially altered. It
is not improbable that during the com
ing century albums of finger prints will
become as fashionable as were auto
graph albums a couple of decades ago.
There are many methods of obtaining
prints. The one used by "Pudd'nhead
Wilson" in Mr. Twain's story was to
take the print on glass by pressing the
finger (just slightly oiled, as by passing
through the hair) on a clean strip of
glass. This method gives a very satis
factory impression, especially where, as
did Mr. Wilson, one studies only the
thumb prints. But the prints from the
fingers are equally Interesting and
equally worthy of study. Sir W. Her
schel's collection of Indian prints con
sisted of the prints of the index and
middle fingers only of each individual.
The chief objection to the method of
printing on glass lies in the fact that
the impressions are easily destroyed
and the glass plates are heavy and
bulky and liable to breakage.
Very satisfactory prints can be se
cured by pressing the fingers on an or
dinary ink pad, such as is found in
every office for the inking of rubber
stamps, and then pressing them on a
card or sheet of paper. The best prints,
however, can be secured by using a
good grade of thin printer's ink spread
very thinly on a slab of planished cop
per or plate glass. On this the fingers
are rolled on a stiff, smooth surfaced
card; the rolling is necessary in order
to print from the entire palmar sur
face of the finger. A London firm has
even put up a special ink in collapsible
tubes, labeled "Finger Print Ink," and
designed especially for this use; so it
would seem that our English cousins
are anticipating us in the collection of
these interesting autographs.
Any one commencing the study of
finger prints is first impressed by the
great variety of the patterns formed by
the ridges. It soon becomes clear that
these various patterns may be grouped
into three principal classes, and such
classification is a necessity for pur
poses of study or cataloguing. The
simplest patterns are those In which
the ridges run continuously from side
to side, sending off branches which run
parallel to the original ridges and fill
up the space within the arch on the
bulb of the finger. These patterns are
known as arches (see figure 3), and are
not uncommon, though more common
in monkeys than in men. The arch pat
tern is much more common on th^ in
dex finger than on any other digit,
though there is no apparent reason for
thisâ it is simply a fact deduced from
the examination of a large number of
finger prints. The arch pattern is, how
ever, relatively infrequent, and in the
100 fingers and thumbs of ten individ
uals it will occur on an average only
about 6^ times, while 3 2-5 of these
occurrences will be on the index fin
gers, 1 2-6 on the middle fingers, and
the remainder about equally distrib
uted between the thumb, ring and little
fingers.
The second great class of patterns
are the loops. In these cases one ridge
runs nearly straight across the fingers,
while a ridge only a few ridges above
it at the sides of the finger arches
toward the finger tip, thus leaving a
space in the center which is filled by
a system of ridges starting from ope
side and returning to the same side,
thereby forming loops, as in figure 4.
The loop is by far the most common
of all the patterns. In the 100 fingers

of ten Individuals the loop will oc
cur not far from sixty-seven times, and
of these about eighteen will be on the
little finger, fifteen will be on the mid
dle finger, and the rest will be about
evenly divided between the thumb, in- .
dcx and ring fingers.
The third characteristic group of pat
terns are the whorls. In these cases
the space left by the separation of two
ridges which were adjacent at the sides
of the finger is filled by ridges coming
from one or both sides of the finger and
coiling around in circles or spirals to
fill the vacant space. The ridges may
run in spirals or the space may be filled
by circular ridges which do not origin
ate on either side of the finger. Figure
5 gives an example of the first class
of whorls, and figure 6 of the second.
Whorls are/ more common than
arches, but less common than loops. In
the 100 digits of our ten persons about
twenty-seven will have whorled pat
terns.
One great difficulty in the classifica
tion of finger prints lies in the fact that
there are many patterns which are
transitional. Arches lean to one side
until it is impossible to say whether
they are really arches or loops. There
are also complex patterns formed by
two loops, one coming from each side,
as in figure 7.
The "A. L. W." classiffcation Is, how
ever, the best that has been thus far
proposed. Inasmuch as each Individ
ual is possessed of a well defined set of
finger prints at birth which he must
carry throughout his life, it would
seem probable that some relation could
be traced between the patterns on the
fingers of parents and child. The ma
terial which is available at the present
time is much too limited to warrant
definite conclusions, but from such in
vestigations as have been made it ap
pears that when a certain pattern oc
curs on corresponding fingers <>t both
parfr.ts it has a decided tendency to
reappear ir. the corresponding- fnijrtr c.f
their < ft'spring.
An irte'estlng question arising in the
study of finger prints lt> tht crfpct vi
nicf> on the varying patterns. It might
b<> supposed that the decree of lrÂ»vo'i>p
nisnuas evidenced by th-? civilization
o* tho various races, would materially
affect the complexity of *h<? o'gani/.H
tion of individuals. The fin fr -pr prints
of a man are more complex ihan those
o? a monkey, so that we might expect
in Cud the finger prints of a citizen of
Greater New York more complex than
thnso of an Australian bushrran.
A thorough investigation of this
question has yet to be made, but the re
searches of Sir Francis Galton show an
inappreciable difference between the
prints of Englishmen, Welshmen, Bas
ques, negroes and Hebrews, with one
exception. The exception is the Hebrew
race; their finger patterns show a larg
er percentage of whorls than the pat
terns of any other race. Loops were
slightly more frequent in the Hebrew
prints, while arches were rare.
As the whorl is obviously a more
complex pattern than the arch or loop,
the question is suggested whether the
greater complexity of the patterns of
Hebrew fingers has anything to do
with their well known mental charac
teristics. They are known to be an ex
ceedingly subtle and shrewd people,
and it seems plausible to suppose that,
as the arrangement of the ridges on the
skin of their fingers is more complex
than in other races, so the arrangement
of the convolutions of their brain is
likewise more complex than Is the case
among gentiles.
It Is certain that the brain of the
monkey is simpler in the arrangement
of its convolutions than the brain of
a man, and it is also certain that the
simian finger print is much less com
plex in pattern than the human finger
print, so that It seems probable that the
two organs are in some way related.
It will, however, require a vastly more
extended series of observations than
has yet been made before this relation,
if It exists, can be demonstrated.
Investigations are now being carried
on to determine what relations the
complexity of the finger patterns bears
to the other signs of degeneration as
observed in the insane, but it will re
quire a very long time and the exami
nation of many thousand prints before
any definite conclusions can be drawn.
One of the greatest obstacles to be
overcome is the lack of large collec
tions of the finger prints of normal
individuals with which the finger prints
of abnormal individuals may be com
pared. Such collections are well under
way in England, and it is to be hoped
that some enthusiast will take up the
subject In this country.
The utility of such investigations is
far more obvious than was the utility
of Faraday's discoveries to which we
owe our arc lights.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July -Wall street appar
ently remained unconvinced to-day that values
of securities had been Increased by the capit
ulation of Santiago and the prices stubbornly
refused to advance In face of that event. The
upward tendency of Americana In London was
viewed with apathy, and the few advances at
thÂ» opening hour were not un to the London
parity. The accumulated orders In commis
sion houses were of very small volume, the
outside public being apparently taken up with
other Interests than speculation In stocks. The
bears were confident and aggressive, and were
prompt to take advantage of the absence of
buying demand to attack the market. Sugar
mi the first point of attack, and the price
yielded quite readily, but only small quantities
of stock were dislodged by the decline. The
weakness of the coalers, which had persisted
all week, continued a marked feature. There
is no doubt there has been liquidation of long
stocks In these companies on account of ac
cumulated troubles of trade. There is but
sluggish demand for even the curtailed out
put, and the companies ftnd themselves at odds
over the maintenance of prices and division of
territory. Trie hears were also busy with Man
hattan. There was an obvious Increase In the
short account and no apparent effort to cover
It over Sunday.
The Government crop report caused some
depression, owing to declines in condition com
pared with the previous month. In spite of a
high average compared with former years and
an estimated crop exceeding 600.000.000 bushels
of wheat. The hesitation -'of the stock market
Is due In no small part to the enormous ex
ports and the high prices of last year with
which comparisons for this year will have to
be made.

ASSOCIATED BANKS STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. July 16.â The Financier says:
The bank statement for the current week re
flects the operations Incident to the financing
of the new Government loan and the totals do
not differ materially from what had been an
ticipated. The banks lost heavily to the Treas
ury, although they gained something like
$2,000,000 from the Interior. The result Is shown
In a net decrease of $4,049,800 In cash, and as
I deposits remain nearly stationary the reserve
decreased almost In the same proportion, or
I t5,97Â».47r> to be exact. ,
Loans are still expanding, the Increase for
I the week having been $6,178,200. In the light
of facts as to slow commercial paper It Is need
less to say that this gain has no connection
with mercantile affairs. It can be traced al
most without exception to the banks which
are acting or are preparing to act as Govern
ment depositories. Of course other banks are
doing their usual share of business, but the
rapid fluctuation In the principal Items Is due
almost entirely to the causes mentioned. Now
that the bond subscription has closed the real
effect on the money market will become ap
parent. It Is known that $90,000,000 or more
has been paid into the Treasury for small
bonds. This money has In reality been with
drawn or Is now In course of collection, but
! the Treasury disbursements art* so heavy that
; the effect has not been perceptible, especially
! a* a large portion of It remains In depository
banks. During the next ten days the I per
i cent checks on the successful bids for the re
mainder of the loan will go through the banks j
and then will begin the payments on the prin
cipal. TheÂ«Â«. In all probability, will be ex- |
tended in such a manner as to prevent a heavy
accumulation of cash In the Treasury, and ;
as the dally deficit In that brunch of the Oov
emment Ib between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 It
I will be seen that the completion of the loan
I will not disturb the money market. The re- .
turn of the unsuccessful bids on the other i
hand, will throw on the market for Invest
ment a large Bum of money. This Is one of
the features disclosed by the enormous over
subscription, which is attracting no little at
tention It becomes patent that the country |
has more money willing to accept lower re- ,
turns than at any previous period. This Is ,
I being shown In the West us well as In the |
! East and It is complicating the banking sys- i
tern In New York because the outlet which
could always be depended upon Is now closed
j through the. accumulation of capital, which 19
being used to meet the needs of local commu
nities. In brief, the country must have ex- j
pansion of some kind or money will continue a ,
drug on the market.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 16.â Increasing receipts of
the new crop and excellent weather for har
vesting and threshing together with disap
pointing cables started Wheat quiet. The de
cline was checked by the strength developed In
Corn during the first fifteen minutes. Every
time the Wheat market attempted to start
downward on Its own account somehlng would
happen In Corn to make it forget Its troubles
ar..l Join the improving fortune* of Its now
llvÂ»Iy neighbor. September Wheat had worked
down to 67c about thirty minutes before the
close, but Just then Corn made Its most tell
ing advance, and WhÂ»at responded by a He a
bushel recovery. The demand for car lots of
cash Wheat was slow and prices were shaded.
Chicago. received 79 carloads, of which 77 were
new. The day's clearances of wheat and flour
from Atlantic ports were enual to 400.000 bush
els. July left off 14c higher and September

Bull sentiment In Corn was stimulated by
the continued dry weather. Prices started
rather easier than at the close yesterday. There
were plenty of buyers, however, the demand
was unsatisfied and prices began to advance.
September gained H'ffS^ on the day.
Oats followed Corn, but" did not display near
ly as much strength as Its leader. TWere was
good buying early, but the price reacted later
on realizing, closing 4QÂ«ic lower.
Higher prices for hogs at the yards and a
fair cash demand over night started Provis
ions strong. Realizing caused a loss of the
early gain. Pork closed :4iSsc lower and ribs
2Hc. Lard closed I4c higher.

STUDY OF LATIN AND GREEK.
Jules Lemaitre. a most accomplished
classical scholar, of exceptional attain
ments In his knowledge of Latin, has
recently written two articles In the
Paris Figaro setting forth at length
his view that the study of Latin is a
waste of time. Lemaitre. who stands
in the front rank of Frenchmen of su
perior literary power, says that he
owes the formation of his heart and
mind to the Bible, to Montaigne, Pas
cal, Rousseau. Chateaubriand, Lamar
tine, Michelet, Sainte Beuve, Tame and
Renan. He confesses that he is igno
rant of the English language, spoken
by one-half the world, and his Ger
man Is simply pitiable. Lemaitre
grants that the study of dead lan
guages is useful as an exercise of the
mind, but holds that the study of liv
ing is Just as valuable; that the intel
lectual and moral substance of antique
literature reaches the minds of our
children vastly enriched by the Eng
lish, the German, the Italian and the
Spanish writers. If the benefit of Latin
and Greek, then, is so small to a man
who knows it very well like himself,
what profit, Lemaitre asks, can it be
to nine-tenths of collegians, who ap
pear to learn Jt. but who do not know
it. never can know it.
The mass of your- men of the mid
dle classes, when they reach the age of
nineteen or twent" are, notwithstand
ing the time they devote to the classics,
not only so ignorant that they cannot
read fluently a page of Virgil, but are
also ignorant of Enellsh and German,
geography and natural science; so that
the average French bachelor of arts
is a prodiey of substantial ignorance
and empty acquirements.
These views are not peculiar to this
eminent Frenchman. They are set
j forth at length by the late Professor
j Blackie. who for flftâ years occupied
I the Greek chair in the great Scotch
I university of Glasgow. Professor
| Blackie agreed with Lemaitre that the
j study of the classics was useful only
to those who love them, but hurtful to
others. The ephemeral study of the
| classics which gives every college boy
! a mere smattering of Latin and Greek,
Professor Blackie denounces as a waste
of time, and a great English teacher of
classics. Professor Farrar. heartily
agreed with him. â Portland Oregonian.

STANLEY'S COAST.
WHEN Stanley was 6 years old
he had never seen any snow â
v although he had .seen many
things that boys who see
snow every winter know noth
ing about. He had seen roses blooming
in the garden at Christmas, and had
had strawberries and green peas for
"thanksgiving dinner many times,- and
Just before the time I am go^ng to tell
you of he had felt a very, very hard
earthquake. The ground trembled arid
I can tell you, Stanley was a badly
frightened small boyâ for you see he
had lived near San Francisco all his
life and many things are very different
there than in the Eastern States. 1
When his mamma-decided that she
would spend the winter in Idaho with
her daughter, who lived in -Silver City,
Stanley was very much excited and de
lighted, for he would have a long, long
ride in the stage coach, and he nad
heard a great deal about the. lndians *>t
Idaho, and although I don't suppose
he really wanted to meet any wild In
dians, still it was interesting to know
he was going where they were. Be
sides all that, his sister had a 'little boy
two years older .and a little girl one
year younger than himself, which -was
a funny thing, too, for, you see, Stanley
was an uncle when he was born! Per
haps that made him such a grave, sol
emn little fellow. You can imagine how
pleased he was to go shopping with his
mamma, buying warm clothing, woolen
scarfs and mittens and nice 'presents
And at last the day came for them
to start. It was a long journey, a
night and a day on the cars and then a
night and day and until midnight the
next night in the stage coach; for I had
almost forgotten to tell you that this
was a "rent many years ago, and there
were not many railroads In this West
ern country then. Stanley, sat on the
box with the driver some of the time
and the driver told him Indian stories
and sbijwed. him- the place - : whÂ£re_4 r b.%
ptae. had boon attacked by the Indians
and the driver killedâ all Of -which
made Stanley feel very grown-up in
deed! But he wasn't on the box- when
they reached Silver City at -midnight.
No. indeed! he was rolled up in furs
and blankets inside the stage, and very
fast asleep, so it was some time before
they could get him awaWe enough to
know<shat his lourney was over.
He didn't realize much that night
what a steep and snowy path he was
carried up. He only knew he had a
warm supper before a bright fire
and was soon [ tucked in a â¢ nice
soft bed. When morning came
and he had been joyously welcomed
by Howard and Alice, Stanley found
time to look out of the window. For a
minute he thought he was looking into
Fairyland. All around rose high moun
tains covered with snow, which the
bri~M sunlight caused to shine ' and
glisten like crystal, and looking down
he could see the houses thai were built
along the one street that followed the
creek, and on the mountain sidesâ and
they were all festooned with grea{ Iclt
cles that looked like immense .dia
monds. . â  â  v
He could hear sleighbells and . see"
men coming down the steep hillsides on
Ion? snowshoes, oh! so fast, that it
almost took his breath away, to set.
them. But what little boy- could be
content to just look at such things?
So it wasn't long before he and How
ard were equipped- in -their warm over
coats and caps, scarfs tied over their
ears and around their necks, and,
greatly to Stanley's surprise and de
light, their little boots were wrapped
in pieces of gunnysacks, so that Jack
Frost couldn't nip their toes. I mustn't
forget that little Aliceâ blue-eyed,
golden-haired maiden of five years, was
to be of the party. She was gorgeously
arrayed In a "Red Hiding Hood" cloak
and hood, with scarlet mittens on her
hands and woolen socks over her shoes.
All this preparation was to the end
that Stanley was to have his first les
son In r coasting, -c had never seen a
sled, but Howard was very sure that he
could soon teach him all the mysteries
of "steering and "stopping," and Stan
ley was firm in his faith in his nephew's
knowledge and his own ability: so out
they went, into..the bright sunlight and
sharp air and on the hard-beaten
snow path. After a few trials .on a low
bank near the house Howard took the
eled to his favorite coasting place, a
steep hillside, leading from the house,
PUZZLEâ FIND THE FARMER.
From the Baltimore American.
BY AUNT HELEN.
down which he had made a path that
went about half-way down, diverged
and led by a less steep incline to the
street below,. He went down himselfâ
two or three times â to show how the
thing was doi.e and then with great
care and ceremony Stanley was in
stalled and all ready for a fine ride.
Howard told him just how to steer the
sled in the path and how to stop
Now, just at the foot of the moun
tain, in a direct line with the sled's
starting point, was a miner's cabin,
THE SPRUCE STREET BRIGADE AND THE DARK STRANGER.
A TRAVELED man of martial mien
trod Spruce street's dusty way,
And sat him down to pee the mimic
soldiers there at play.
At play, said I? In earnest marched
these warriors small and trim
And over thorn "Old Glory" waved, whose
stars hot Time shall dim.
Now twe and two they onward go. Hark
to the jarring drum.
Full many a parent proud is there to sco
the phalanx come.
Mark well the traveled stranger man.
See how he "eyes each boy,
And. at the brave and stirring Bight his
features, .lÂ«m with joy.
Now gallant Lee is captain bold and his
command is heard,
"March," all his comrades proudly step.
"Halt," not a foot is stirred.
Eddie and Artie, Davy, Will, Clarence,
and Robbie, too,
Philip and Milton, Qrton, Roscoeâ all
these soldiers view.
There's but one musket in the line, but
pistols are galore;
Of sharpened laths, resembling pikes,
with a window toward the hillside, and
a great snow drift that came up to the
window's sill. In this cabin a miner
who had been at work nearly all night
was leisurely cooking his late break
fast, all unconscious of the great prep
arations going on upon the hill above
him. And new Master Stanley is ready.
Howard shouts, "Let her go," and Stan
ley lets her go. But alas, he
can't stop her, and in spite of
Howard's frantic shouts of "Steer her."
"Steer her," he goes madly on in a
straight line, and like a large-sized
woolen cannon ball crashes through the
window and lands at the feet of the
astonished miner. Whether the man
thought it a visit from some new kind
of Santa Claus, or an original way of
paying a morning call, I have never
heard, but his only remark was
"Hello," and Stanley, dazed, but equal
to the occasion, replied, "Hello."
Howard soon came running in, not
knowing but what he would find his
uncle in fragments, and much relieved
when he found that the window was
the only damaged article. After assur
ing the miner that his papa would pay
for the window, he led his very much
subdued small uncle home. How
ever, this unfortunate beginning did
not discourage the young Californian,
and before many days he became an
accomplished coaster, and more than
that â a snowshoe rider as well â but
that "is another story."
MARY'S TREE HOUSE.
I MUST tell you a short story about
Mary Little's cute little playhouse
in the woods. She lives in Shasta
County and there is a creek near
the house. On the south bank of
the creek there is a huge sugar pine
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 17, 1898.
tree, and in the trunk of this tree,
near the ground, is an opening like a
door, through which Mary passes into
the trunk, which is almost entirely hol
low. Near by stands another very
large tree, also hollow.
Now, when Mary discovered the sec
ond hollow tree she asked her mother
how she could make a covered passage
way between the two trees. Her moth
er sent the hired man out to cut the
hole entirely through the first tree.
Then she told them to make two low
fences, not far apart, extending from
the first to the second tree. Mary went
on her vacation trip to San Francisco
just then. While she was away the
hired man planted ivies by both fences
and laid a roof of wire upon the fences.
The ivies grew very fast, and when
Mary arrived home again she found
that she had a covered way between
her "parlor" and her "nursery," as she
calls the interiors of the two trees.
Aunt Kitty gave Mary last Christmas
there is a goodly store.
And. hark! What dreadful noise is that,
resounding far and wide?
See. The artillery, drawn by hand, it is
the soldiers' nride.
A water pipe astride on wheels with
"giant 1 crackers" fed.
Sends, cannon like, to Spaniards all, a
warning grim and dread.
See now the traveled stranger at this
sign of horrid war-
Fierce flash his eyes: in his swart lips
a machete drips with gore.
Far, far afield his thoughts are now; ho
sees the squadrons reel
Before the withering "rapid fires"; before
the sharpened steel.
And not the flowering wayside hedge
beperfumed by the rose,
Nor babbling children in the street can
bring his brain repose.
Oh, wait, tiiou traveled wayfarer, let not
thy vision range;
For here are girlies fair and sweet, thy
savage mood to change;
Each with her Red Cross emblem proud,
is ready for the fray;
Nor halts, nor shrinks one curly head at
the fierce cannon's bray.
Sweet Marguerita, Catherine, Nellie,
Rosie. Maggie, Ruth,
And Claraâ oh a goodly company they are
in truth;
And ready are thpir tender hearts and
hands to lend their aid
When fall their soldiers on the field, tWs
sweet Red Cross brigade.
Above them float our country's flag.
There Cuba's emblem, see .â >â¢â¢â â¢
Proudly those allied colors ilyâ tokens of
liberty.
Ah, envious are the smaller ones who
from the sidewalks gaze
And see their older playmates shine in
Glory's dazzling blaze.
The stripes upon the overalls that uni
form the boys;
The crosses red on field of white, that
are the girlies' joys;
The fluttering tlags that kiss the breeze
fresh from the Golden Gate
Make the babes all wish to be big. How
hard it is to wait!
The troops have gone. They've marched
a little stove and a set of iron pans,
kettles and saucepans, small in size,
but large enough for a little girl to
play house with. She can make a fire
in the stove and it will cook tiny loaves
of bread and cake. Sometimes she has
a party of her little girl friends and
they all bring their dolls and the hol
low trees and the covered passage â
"reception room" Mary calls it â send
forth such sounds of mirth and jollity
that the wild deer and the squirrels
and the birds in the forest stop to lis-
ten.
Mary often uses broad leaves of the
lily for plates and she has the cutest
little cups to drink fromâ the little
bowls of the acorns. Climbing vines
that fold the trunks of her two old
trees gently in their loving embrace,
grow gay with colored leaves in the au
tumn, when the frost comes. The ap
proach to her "house" is over a carpet
of soft, green moss â as fine as velvet to
the touch. The birds have learned not
to be afraid of Mary and her friends.
One day her papa found a bee tree and
he gave Mary all the honey she and her
friends could eat at an "all day party."
For music, as the children dine upon
viands cooked upon Mary's little stove,
they have the sound of the sighing for
est and the singing of the creek that
hurries by, all sparkling and foaming.
The air is always perfumed with the
sweet odor of the pine needles and with
the breath of oh, so many wild flowers.
When the wind blows hard the "house"
rocks; but the children are not afraid,
for the roots of the trees are deep in
the ground and they are so strong and
trusty that there can be no reason for
fear.
One day when the children were
feasting there was a pattering sound
of little feet at the "front" door." The
children listened and waited, just as
still as mice, or "mouses," as Mary
said. Soon a soft little nose and two
very bright eyes were in sight. Soon
after the smell of the good things in
the house caused a lovely little baby
deer to Join the doll party which the
girls were having. The deer did not
show any fear when once in "the
house." On the contrary, it was coaxed
easily through the "reception room"
into the second room and there it was
given a nice lump of sugar. Now the
little deer often joins the little girls
in their play and seems to enjoy their
sports almost as much as they do. Has
any other little girl a nicer playhouse
than Mary Little has?
THE LETTERED FARMER.
BY EDWARD WIDINER,.
PORTLAND, OR.
There is a farmer who Is yy
Enough to take his cc,
And study nature with his if
And think of what he cc.
He hears the chatter of the jj
As they each other tt,
And that when a tree dekk
It makes a home for bb.
A yoke of oxen he will uu
With many haws and g-g,
And their mistakes he will e'xqq
When plowing for his pp.
He little buys, but much he sella,
And, therefore, little 00,
And when he hoes his soil by apella
He also soils his hnao.
HIS BAD MISTAKE.
BY HOMER F. KEYES, Stockton.
#***.******* ******** i
THE Centerville school term \yas
speedily drawing to a close. Al
ready Professor' Graham had
started making out the yearly re
ports, upon which so many of the
pupils depended for their promotion
into the next higher grade. . .
Burt Bowmen especially . showed
signs of impatience *~ regard to his
school work. As the finals were coming
in he was preparing nightly for. the
next day's examination. With con-
away. Are they in distant lands?
Have they ta'en ship and sailed to where
the foam chafes coral strands?
Doth some grim fort, with frowning
walls, the lurking Spaniard hide? ,
And willhis guns sink J neath the main,
our Sprure street's joy and pridÂ« â
Sink th'->m with, sounds that smite thÂ«
sky and hills of granite : rockâ
Dear Lord be praised: our babes are here;
they've just marched 'round the block!
They, led by Lee,, scaled the steep hill
named for the clinging Vine.
And saw below Francisco's bay in regal
splendor shino.
And where the sun ensilvered all the sea
with glorious sheen
The waves like white hands pointed farâ
"go seek the Philippines."
Ah, no. dear little hands and feet, your
trials come not yet. j
Beneath "Old Glory's" folds you live; you
yet may pay the debt.
Swift to respond 'when strikes the hour,
dear ones, to freedom's call;
To sail the seas, to ford the stream, to
scale the guarded wall;
To hear the shout of victory that reaches
stant study he had pursued the year's
work, and now his mind was filled
With the one thought, "promotion or
not -promotion."
"To think," he said, "if I am passed I
receive my diploma, which entitles me
to the privilege of entering any high
school of the country at the opening of
the spring term."
Joe Hawley, a young society man of
the village, who expected to graduate
that year, was Hurt's only opponent in
scholarship, and the feelings between
them, especially on Hawley's part,
were anything but friendly.
On the next to the last day of the
THE BUMPKINS PRACTISING A PHILIPPINE WAR DANCE.
school term Professor Graham an
nounced to the class that he would not
be with them on the last day, as he was
sick and felt that he was growing
worse. He said that he would send a
substitute to take the class, and ex
pressed regret at not being able to be
present on th,e graduation day.
A murmur arose from the class, but
it was suppressed by a few words from
the master.
The class adjourned half an hour be-
to the skies;
To sleep! Thfe sun filled daisies kiss tha
hero where he lies!
Or yet, dear little girls of mine, to toil
upon the field
Reaped by the scythe of bloody war, with
death and wounds for yield;
To hold the cup to fevered lips; to catch
th"- parting breath;
To take the message of his love; make
soft the path to death!
Not yet, not yet, your cheerful drum
again sounds on the street;
Once more we know the cadence of the
myriad littfe feet.
Once more the pay procession passes by
in proud review;
Oh, sun-browned wanderer of the years,
pray tell me where are you?
Still he is here, that traveler strange,
and now a pageant see;
The ranks are broken and the scene is
war's great, tragedy.
Bwift â¢ Xroin his belt where "red heads"
cartridge like are firmly placed
Each little lad his pistol draws and hostile
ranks are faced.
Snap! Snap! The time at last has come
for serious work perhaps;
For now the air resounds with a fierce
fusillade of caps.
The solitary musket next upon the chorus
breaks
And v ith its warlike solo some yet slum
bering pclk>p>s wakes.
Not gr- ;a the carnage. Quick prepare the
cannon for the fray!
For they who hold that deadly piece will
victory win to*day. â¢ â¢
Without a pause the cannoneers spring
to their wonted place.
But not a tint of paleness mars the tan
on any face.
Boom! Boom!- Now doth the â¢ welkin
ring and powder taints the air-
Prone in the dust some heroes fall, the
pictures of despair.
What ho! Kid Cross, come to the front;
your duties now begin;
The sufferers from the deadly fray have
need of medicine.
The curly heads are prompt to hear, but
somewhat system lack-
Contrary pulls have thrown a gasping
fore the regular hour for dismissal and
little knots of scholars collected about
the yard discussing the situation.
"I wonder who the substitute will
be?" asked Burt. "Surely it will he
some one^ with whom we are ac
quainted. J I suppose she will distribute
the diplomas?"
"What is that to you?' 'asked Joe
Hawley, stepping up. "You will not
get one."
"I may," replied Burt, and then he
continued: "Why, are you not going
up?"
"I expect to," was the stiff response.
"I inherit my brightness and do not
even need to study to carry me
through."
The boys smiled and Joe turned on
his heel and walked swiftly away.
The thoughts that passed through
young Hawley's brain as he turned his
back upon the boys -were of an evil na-Â»
ture, and I will only say that before
he had reached his home he had decid
ed to "square accounts," as he ex
pressed it, with his rival, Burt Bow
men.
The next day wlien school was call
ed every punil was present and the
teacher, Miss Robins, stood at the desk,
surveying the scholars as they entered.
"I see by your actions," she said, after
they were seated "that you are anxious
to receive your diplomas. Mr. Graham
made them out and I will' distribute
them after recess. But for the present
we will grapple with those cube root
examples left over from yesterday"
and she smiled.
The hour and a half before recess
dragged slowly by and when at last
the bell rang the teacher collected the
arithmetic papers and the pupils were
dismissed for the intermission.
After working a few moments at her
desk- the teacher stepped into the yard
to watch the scholars at their play.
Joo'Hawley watched this movement
with intense satisfaction and at last,
unperceived, he slipped into the school
house from the rear entrance and stole
up to Miss Robins' desk.
The diplomas had been rolled and
neatly tied with the class colors, laven
der and green, and the names "Were
written lightly In lead pencil on the
end *Â«i enable the teacher to determine
to whom the diploma belonged
Joe looked over the pile of diplomas
on the desk and at last took one from
the pile. It had Burt Bowmen's name
written acrosÃ the end. He looked at
it a moment and then taking a match
from his pocket he struck it and
touched It to the precious paper. It
caught the flame readllv and when Joe
left the room there was nothing left of
the certificate except the ashes which
lay on the bottom of the waste basket
where young Hawley placed them.
Tn a few moments the bell ranpr and
the seats were again filled with the pu
pils wearing anxlouw and hopeful faces.
"The diplomas," began the teacher,
"have been rolled and tied, and for
the convenience of the teacher the
names were written lightly across the
end, on the outside, but through some
carelessness a mistake has been made,
and the names are, in a good many
cases, written on the -wrong diplomas.,"
Joe started and turned pale.
"And so," continued the teacher, '"we
will have to open the diplomas to find to
whom they belong, and I will appoint
Mac Robins and Jack Mallory to as-
hero on his back!
And there he waits a better plan; and
gazes on the sky;
'Till girls pull all one way that he In
shade at last may lie;
Some chaff and laughter follow as the
doses are prepared.
And many heroes had poor chance the
medicine to have shared.
For, when the hero first from field the
medicine did taste.
"More, more," he cried, "I'm very 111; I
must be dosed in haste!"
No wonder for that medicine in sugar
bowl was found,
And every hero hearing this at once pro
claimed a wound.
And not a hero was there left on the
ensanguined field
Who die! not wish to be shot down and
with white sugar healed.
Lo, now, my traveled stranger man, how
movoth this thy mood?
Close by the myriad wounded ones the
sun-browned stranger stood;
And at the awful carnageâ the worst
Spruce street ever knewâ
The tears in copious overflow dripped
from his eyes of blue.
D. H. W.
sist me."
The named pupils stepped forward,
and the distributing began at once.
Name after name was read, and Joe
Hawley listened with eager interest.
Ben Hammond, Frank Rice, Grace
Fowler, and so they went on until at
last clearly and distinctly came the
name Burt Bowmen! And then the
teacher announced that all the diplo
mas were distributed, and Joe Hawley
gasped in realization of the fact that
the mistakes in the names on the out
side of the papers had caused the fail
ure of his plan. His name had not
been called. He had burned his own
diploma.
LITTLE HOMER'S SLATE
BY EUGENE FIELD.
AFTER dear old grandma died,
Hunting through an oaken
chest
In the attic, we espied
What repaid our childish quest;
'Twns a homely little slate,
Seemingly of ancient date.
On its quaint and battered face
Was the picture of a cart.
Drawn with. all that awkward Â«racÂ«
Which betokens childish art.
But what meant this legend, prajrt
"Homer drew this yesterday?"
Mother recollected thenâ
What the years were fain to hide-
She was but a baby when
Little Homer lived and died:
Forty years, so mother said.
Little Homer had' been dead.
So the homely little slate
Grandma's baby fingers pressed,
To the memory consecrate,
Lieth in the oaken chest,
Where, unwilling we should
know.
Grandma put it, years ago.
HOW REX WAS SAVED.
HERE is a true story about a
wonderful dog who saved the life
of little Rex Allinghnm of Fly
Creek, Or., aged 4 years. One
Saturday afternoon at the end of
March, after little Rex had- been seen
by his aunt playing in the yard with
his dog', trying to drive the animal
â with a string, he and the dog were
missed. Miss Allingham, the aunt,
went out in search of the child, and
followed his track for nearly two miles.
Then it was. lost, and she was com
pelled to return home. It was now
dark, and the weather cold.
A search party of men with lanterns
was at once organized. They followed
the tracks of the boy and dog along the
trail which leads from the Fly Creek
ranch over the Matoles for some dis
tance. Then the tracks left the trail,
wandering* in the woods in every direc
tion, at one time returning to within
a mile of the home ranch, and then
wandering off again.
Until 2 o'clock in the morning this
was kept up, and then the track was
lost so that no one could find it by. the
aid of the lanterns. It was now so
cold that the searchers had to build a
fire and remain by it till daybreak.
They had lost all hope of finding the
child alive. The exposure, they felt
sure, must have ended his life.
With daylight they resumed their
melancholy search, and after a time
the trail of the boy and the dog was
again found. They followed it now
very carefully, and it was not lost
again.
At 8. o'clock In the morning the men
saw the dog at a little distance ahead,
and soon they caught sight of a child's
motionless and prostrate body curled
beside it. They hardly dared approach,
but presently they did so. and were
overjoyed to find that the child was lit
tle Rex, and that he was not dead, but
was sleeping profoundly, well en
veloped in the dog's warm fur.
The little boy must have walked
twelve or fifteen miles, and was thor
oughly exhausted. But for the dog he
must have perished in the cold-
Two facts are remarkable about the
dog's conduct. He stuck by the child
nnd did not start for home, as most
dogs would have done, when the child
in his wanderings approached nearest
to it; and he had intelligence enough to
cuddle close to the boy to keep him
warm, and not circle about, as many
dogs, even of the most devoted kind,
would have done.
Rex was taken home, and with rest
and care recovered from his exposure
and exhaustion.
LITTLE ALICE'S STRATAGEM.
THERE is a bright little girl over
in Oakland; in fact, all the little
girls ever there are bright. Her
father thinks that his Alice is
very nice. He has told her sev
eral times that she was sweet. Last
Saturday she went out to a candy store
with her mother and she was treated
to ice cream soda, which was so nice
that she determined to scheme for
some more. Sly little puss! She knew
that she could get anything she want
ed from her father. Perhaps her
mother is a mind reader. At any rate
she told Alice that she could not ask
her father to take her to the candy
store that day. "One drink of soda
water was enough."
Now Alice has a mind nf her own
and she made up her mind to get the
soda water that very night at all haz
ards. So, when it came supper time
and her father was at the table she
waited her chance.
"You are so sweet, Alice, I could eat
you up," said papa.
"Speaking of sweet things," an
swered sly little Alice, "they have a
nice new soda water fountain in the
candy store around the corner."
Alice's mother had to laugh and Alice
had the soda and her mother made No.
3 in the soda water party.

WITCHING THE
RESTAURANTS
The Stamp Tax Law Is
Being Violated.
TRICKS WITH THE BOTTLES
ONE STAMP FORCED TO DUTY
UNTIL WORN OUT.
Evidence Is Being Collected Daily,
But No Arrests Will Be
Made Until Au
gust.
In accordance with the new Btamp
tax law it is necessary to place a stamp
on each bottle of wine "bottled for
sale." The keepers of French restau
rants in this city hold that they should
be exempt from this rule as, according :
to their way of thinking, it was in- j
tended only to apply to what is known ;
in the trade as case goods and have
Mat a petition to Washington asking \
for a favorable ruling.
While the answer Is pending, how- j
ever, many restaurant and saloon men i
are flagrantly violating the law. AÂ» a
rule all wines served iyi the common
dining-rooms are properly stamped, but
when a meal is served in the side room
the little precaution of putting a stamp
on the bottle is frequently forgotten, j
It is also found convenient by restau- 'â 
rant keepers in many cases to put a
tstamp on the top of the cork in such a
manner that it will not be injured by
the removal of the cork and is per- i
mined to stay there as long as it keeps
clean enough to pass muster.
Revenue Agents Thomas and Towne
have been busy collecting evidence ;
against violators of the law for the past ]
few days although no arrests have been
made as yet. Mr. Thomas says that j
he has found that the law is being vio
lated freely in many Instances and has !
already secured some evidence against
the offenders, although he has not
deemed it proper to make any arrests,
as the law is still new and the chances
are that many persons are violating it
through ignorance; in fact many of its
provisions are not fully understood by
the revenue agents themselves.
While unwilling to commit himself by
a direct statement Mr. Thomas broadly
hinted that he would give until the Ist
of August for all persons to become
fully acquainted with the law, and any
person violating- it after that date will
be arrested and punished accordingly.
So far the work of watching has been !
done wholly by Messrs. Thomas and
Towne, but it is more than probable
that it will be found necessary- to. eri
gae-p a force of special denuties. whose
business it will be to go from one res- i
taurant and saloon to another as cus
tomers and look out for the stamps. A j
tl watch can be kept by keeping '
account of the liquor sales and com- I
raring them with the number of stamps '
sold, but owing to the custom of re
filling partially emptied bottles this
would be rather unsatisfactory.
Alice Rix has gone to Honolulu
for the Sunday Call. She will send
back letters describing the ceremo
nies that make Hawaii part of the
United States, and other notable
features of interest.
