BOGUS MONEY
IS MADE RIGHT
IN FOLSOM PRISON
Guards Surprise Convicts Busily En
gaged in Coining Nickels in
the Engine-Room.
CONVICT HARRY L. COYNE
PACRAMENTO, March 10.â A coun
terfeiter's layout has been discovered
at Folsom within the State prison
walla, the last spot on earth where one
would look for the illegal minting of
t'ncle Sam's coin. If there is a place
in the broad universe where neither
- and for the BM of
money arises it is within the walls of
the State prison; at least such is the
general impression of people who are
without experience with criminals. To
those who have had dealings with men
.i-ntenced to long terms of imprison
ment for the commission of crime it is
known that there is no passion or de
sire stronger than the predilection of a
prisoner to carry upon his person some
small amount of money. On the part of
many it becomes a mania, and they
will resort to all sorts of devices and
any kind of a subterfuge to withhold a
few pieces of coin from the Warden
upon entering the prison. Secretary
Smith, in speaking of this peculiarity
on the part of prisoners, once said to
The Call correspondent:
"You would be surprised to know
what difficulty we have in securing
money from the prisoners who are
brought here. No second termer ever
comes without an endeavor to conceal
upon his person some bit of money. I
have known them to have five-dollar
pieces covered with cloth and sewed
upon their vests as buttons. They con
ceal money in their hair and in their
ears, and we are not always successful
in obtaining possession of it. Not long
ago I brought $75 worth of books for
our library with money found around
the prison grounds â money that had
been hidden by convicts or carried in,
notwithstanding the precaution we
take to relieve all the prisoners of
every cent they have upon their per
son when entering for registration ."
But while it may not be astonish
ing to find this overwhelming desire on
the part of convicts to conceal their
Bpare change, there is probably no
prison in the United States where the
criminals successfully operated and
circulated bogus coin, manufactured
within the prison walls under the very
eyes of the officers.
For some time past Officer Charles
Jally. whose station is at the rock
crushing plant, has had his suspicions
aroused by the peculiar conduct of
some at the prisoners under his con
trol At first he thought these whisper
ings and signals were carried on in the
planning of some scheme to smuggle in
opium. This is a very common mat
ter at the prison, and only last week
Ouard Lamphry burned ten pounds of
the drug which had been surreptitious
ly brought within the confines.
After three or fc-ur days of watching
Jally informed Superintendent Taylor,
and both became convinced that some
deeper plot was being laid, and they
became more determined than ever to
ascertain the cause of so much sup
pressed excitement among the convicts.
Yesterday they were rewarded. Some
time during the morning Jally in
formed Taylcrr that there was some
thing wrong in the engine room. Tay
lor gathered about him Guards Jally
and Sllak. and the three made a rush
for the engine room. Convicts Cayne
and Brown were encountered, and a 9

leaped through a window in the engine
room and ran to the tank of the ca
nal, which was within a short distance
of the engine house. One of the guards
followed them, while the others pro
ceeded to Inspect the engine room.
As the convicts reached the edge of

water. The crucible and dies they had
used were forever beyond the posses
sion erf those in pursuit. The quick

sands and murky waters of the Ameri
can River were safe custodians of their
guilt.
There were other evidences, how
ever, and they consisted of a pile of
nickels which were captured by the
guard who entered the engine room.
These nickels were splendid specimens
cf wnrkirr'ti.Rhip. The out ol
which they were mad* consisted of
babbiting, which is .a white soft metal
which forms the inside rim of the axle
box found on a locomotive. This sub
stance was taken from the engine
which runs through the prison grounds
and hauls the trains of crushed rock
which are shipped from the prison
rock crusher.
The nickels are seemingly as perfect
and complete as any ever made by
Uncle Sam. Many of them have been
given circulation and The Call corres
pondent found no difficulty in procur
ing one of them in the town of Folsom.
How the dies and crucibles were ever
made will perhaps remain a mystery.
Plaster of parts molds lere used, and
In the engine room were found many
fragments of this material.
Captain Murphy was rather reticent
when asked about the affair.
"It amounts to nothing," the captain
said, "and if it did I would not talk
about it in the absence of the warden.
I do not deem it to be best for the
prison discipline to take such matters
up and give them undue publicity in
the papers."
When shown one of the spurious
I coins the captain admitted that he had
' seen them, but beyond the admission
I he preferred to say nothing.
It is not supposed that Cayne and
â  Brown are the prisoners who made the
molds, but as there are several coun
j terfeiters doing time in Folsom, it is
j probable that the devices used were
i made by some of them, and the coining
of the counterfeit left to Cayne and
Brown.
A very extensive traffic has for a
long time been going on among the
! prisoners, and the officers have been at
j a loss to know where the convicts ob

tamed the money which had been so
freely circulated. The cigarette paper
among the convicts is a very choice
article, and they will give almost any
thing: to obtain a package of it. On
the other hand, there has been a great
quantity of opium smuggled in lately, i
and there is no duvbt that these coins ;
were being made for the purpose of ;
paying those who sent it in from the |
outside, as well as exchanging them for
cigarette papers.
It is a matter of some regret that the
entire layout was not captured, as it
no doubt would have given the officers
some clew as to the means employed
in obtaining it. Some of the officers
think that the dies were smuggled in
from the outside, while others hold that
the entire apparatus was made within
the prison walls. As there are many
tools and furnaces available around the ;
quarries, it is very probable that the
latter theory is the correct one.
The ladle used appeared similar to
those used around assaying establish
ments, while the crucible was crude in
form, and appeared as though it
had been melted into shape from rail
road couplings.
There are many cars arriving every
day in the yard, and it is from these
that the prisoners are supplied with
opium from the outside. The most won
derful devices are employed in this
prohibited traffic. Opium has been
found in the axle boxes of the cars, or
fastened to the inside of a brake beam;
in fact there is no place about a flat car
that has not been used in concealing
the drug.
The impression prevails among the
officers that it was the Intention of the
convicts to coin a great quantity of
nickels and then ship them out on the
freight cars, where their friends on the
outside could receive them in exchange
for opium.
It is probable that nothing but nick
els were attempted to be made for the
reason that the convicts could not ob
tain the metal necessary to manufac
ture silver coins.

MADRID, March 10.â The tor

altered, will start to-morrow for

destroyers leave England direct
for Cuba.
A strong sentiment is growing_
that peace of war should come
without delay. People are ask
ing here how the Reuter Agency
could have given circulation to
the statement that Senor Gullon

poverty-stricken Spain must yield to
any just demand made by the United
States. This will certainly include a
demand for indemnity, and it is be
lieved such indemnity will be paid
by European capitalists, but now that
the President is strongly fortified in
his position, with Congress unani
mously at his back and the powerful
European nations in sympathy, he
will not be content with a mere de
mand for indemnity, but will take
steps to intervene in Cuban affairs.
The report that President McKin
ley has prepared a rough draft of his
message to Congress recommending
intervention is premature. The Presi
dent is advising with men in Con
gress, in whose disinterested judg
ment he has most faith, on the ques
tion whether he sEould write in one
message his remarks on the verdict
of the Board of Inquiry of the Maine
disaster and his commentary on the
reports of our Consuls in Cuba, re
viewing the situation on the island
and urging the desirability of peace
ful intervention, or whether he
should make separate presentations
of the two subjects.
In case he decided upon the latter
course, it is possible that he might
put off the presentation of the Con
sular reports until after the effect ot

whatever it might be, should have

AN ULTIMATUM
MAY BE SENT
TO THE SPANISH
While the President Hopes for
Peace. He Would Take That
Course in Certain Con
tingencies.
NEW YORK, March 10.â The '
Herald's Washington correspond
ent telegraphs: At the White
House and the State Department,
where they are getting ready to
make representations to Spain in
connection with the Maine disas
ter ami- the general Cuban ques
tion, they are talking peace.
In the Military and Naval De
partment, where they are prepar
ing for war, they are talking
peace.
The average Senator and Repre
sentative is talking war. With
them war is inevitable.
Administration officials, while
talking peace, admit that war is
possible, if not probable. This
briefly sums up the state of opinion
here to-night.
Peace or war, President McKinlev :
has a fixed purpose in view. He will i
treat the Maine disaster and the real
Cuban question as kindred subjects, and
he purposes making representations to
Spain for the purpose of obtaining
reparation for the blowing up of the
Maine and for the speedy restoration of
peace in the island of Cuba. All of this
is with the understanding that the re
port of the court of inquiry will show
that the Maine was blown up by an out
side explosion, which is now accepted
by everybody here as definitely deter- j
mined.
It is going too far to say. as some
papers have said, that the President has
determined upon forcible intervention
and that he proposes to send a special
message to Congress at an early date
on the subject. If forcible intervention
comes it will be caused by Spain refus
ing to consider intermediary proposi
tions looking to the independence of
the island through peaceful means.
When the report of the court of in
quiry has been received showing, as it
undoubtedly will, that the vessel was
blown up by some exterior cause, the
President will proceed to make out a
case against Spain in a deliberate, judi
cial way. In the presentation of the
case to Spain he will be careful not to
use unnecessarily harsh words. He will
assume at the start that the Spanish
Government could not possibly be sus
pected of being participant in such a
dastardly act as the destruction of the
Maine and the slaughter of her men.

FLEET SAILS
FOR MANILA.
LONDON, March 11.â A dis
patch to the Daily Mail from
Singapore says it is reported â¢
from Hongkong that the Amer
ican squadron has sailed far Ma
nila.
The Hongkong correspondent
of the Daily Mail says it is re
ported that the Philippine rebels
have captured Bolini, near Ma
nila. The land telegraph lines
connecting Manila with the ca
ble at Bolini have been cut.
According to the same corres- .
pondent, the British cruiser Ed
gar will sail for Manila this
(Friday) morning.
The New York correspondent
of the Daily Telegraph says:
"I have it on the highest author
ity that a triple alliance between
Great Britain, the United States
and Japan is pending."
MADRID, March 10.â The re
port of a rising at Bolini, near
Manila, Philippine Islands, is
confirmed officially. A portion
of the garrison has been besieged,
but there has been no one killed.
heavy indemnity. This will be demand
ed in language kept well within the
bounds of diplomacy, and the represen
tation will be at the same time made
that the United States now insists that
the condition of affairs in Cuba which
makes such catastrophes possible must
be speedily brought to a close. There
will be a concise review of all that has
occurred in Cuba since the war began,
of our commercial interests with the
island and existing conditions which
show that autonomy is a failure and
there is no end in sight to the intense
suffering of the people.
Then will come the proposition that
Spain shall accept the good offices of
the United States to procure peace and
the independence of Cuba through the
medium of purchase. It will be shown
that the United States has no desire to
annex the island. Its chief concern is
the restoration of peace, and this
through peaceful means if possible.
As a means of settlement it will be
proposed that independence be given
the Cubans on condition that they share
a portion of the war debt â probably2
$200,000.000 â payment of which will be
guaranteed by the United States. No
one, of course, can tell how Spain will
entertain this proposition. The rejec
tion may mean war, but it will be of
Spain'-s own making. Perhaps the next
step will be to recognize the indepen
dence of Cuba. This of itself would not
be a declaration of war on the part of
the United States, but Spain would
doubtless so consider it, and, as an ex
cuse for* relinquishing the island hon
orably, might declare war herself.
This is the general policy of the Presi
dent as far as now outlined. There is
always a likelihood of some. new con
dition arising, so that any general pol
icy must be more or less speculative.
It may be that Spain, acting upon the
demand for indemnity for the Maine,
independently of the proposition for the
purchase of Cuban independence, will
refuse to pay such indemnity. In such
an event the President will put his de
mand in the form of an ultimatum,
giving Spain probably twenty-four
hours to comply.

SUPPLIES FREE
Joint Resolution intro
duced by Senator
Chandler.
Does Away With the Duty on
Munitions Purchased
Abroad.
Its Object to Decrease the Cost of
Preparing the Navy for an
Emergency.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 10.â Senator
Chandler of New Hampshire of the
Senate Naval Affairs Committee to-day
introduced a joint resolution providing
for the temporary admission free of
duty of naval supplies procured abroad.
Following is the text of the resolu
tion:
That such gruns, ammunition and other
naval supplies as may be purchased
abroad by this Government for the na
tional defense prior to January 1, 1899,
shall be admitted at any port of the
United States free of duty.
The resolution was introduced at the
request of the Secretary of the Navy
who, in a letter to Senator Hale, says:
"t/nder the existing law a varying
but considerable ad valorem duty on
articles falling within the category of
naval supplies is imposed. The effect
of the resolution, if adopted, will be to
remit all duties upon guns, ammuni
tion and other naval supplies which it
may be found necessary to purchase
abroad. The temporary remission of
duty on these supplies is deemed im
portant, inasmuch ai without some
special enactment of this nature such
portion of the appropriation made by
Congress for the purpose as may be
expended abroad would be very ma
terially reduced by the deduction there
from of duty amounting In some cases
to nearly one-half of the purchase
price."
Mr. Allison of lowa called Mr. Chand
ler's attention to the fact that resolu
tions and bills of the character of the
one presented ordinarily originated in
the House. Mr. Chandler admitted
that that was true, but said that he
had introduced it with the idea of hav
ing it referred to the Finance Commit
tee. He was willing, he said, to trust
to the wisdom of that committee to
make proper disposition of the resolu
tion. At this suggestion the resolution
was referred to the Committee on Fi
nance. ____

! worn away. Some very conservative
I advisers, who have been loth to ad
i mit that we should or could consist
ently intervene, are now telling the
President that a long-continued agi
tation and irritation is more perilous
to international peace and more dam
aging to the business interests of the
country than the raising of one plain,
comprehensive issue which must be
met and settled at once, and for good.
As long as the President has pretty
I well made up his mind that interven
tion is inevitable, their idea is that to
waive all consideration of money
damages in the case of the Maine and
simply say to Spain that the war in
Cuba must be brought to a close
would put the United States before
the world in a more unselfish attitude
tnan if we were first to settle up the
Maine incident and then come back
to the plan of humane intervention.
But this is far from saying that
the President has prepared a mes
sage, even in the rough. That he has
made notes of current events and
their bearing, preparatory to any
thing he may wish to write later, is
probably true. That is his habit in
dealing with all public questions. The
probability is that he would go no
further than this until he has seen
Senator Proctor and obtained his im
pressions of the Cuban situation, and
certain specific information which
can be better reported face to face
than by correspondence. The plan
the President will propose to Con
gress when he does recommend
peaceful intervention is evidently not
yet definitely shaped in his own
mind. The idea of offering to guar
antee a one hundred million dollar
purchase fund raised on bonds of the
Cuban Republic is still uppermost,
but indications hardly encourage the
hope that a guarantee bill could be
got through the Senate as now con
stituted.
There is not much danger in the
House. If it bore the label of an ad-
ministration party measure it would
have a good-sized majority behind it.
But in the Senate there are signs that
some of the Populists and Democrats
would object to the purchase of Cuba,
when, in their opinion, her freedom
could be equally well secured by a
threat of war. That element has to
be reckoned with, especially if it was
given a chance to assail the adminis
tration on the score of playing into
the hands of bondholders and money
lenders. If the guarantee plan is dis
carded it will undoubtedly be due to
the fear of a hitch.

EVERY SEAPORT
Urgent Military Orders
Go Into Effect
To-Day.
Hitherto Unprotected Forts
Will Be Manned and
Armed.
Troops to Be Distributed Along the
Coast From Boston to Gal
veston.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Mili
tary orders that will become operative
to-morrow will cause the manning of
hitherto unprotected forts from Boston
down the Atlantic coast and along the
gulf to Galveston. Baltimore will then
be the only unprotected city in the de
partment of the East, and steps will
be taken at once to garrison North
Point and Hawkins Point on the sea
ward side of the city. These orders call
for the utmost promptness in their ex
ecution, and as all the troops affected
by them have been expecting to be
moved at any moment it is likely that
all of General Miles' plans for defense
will be in operation within forty-eight
hours. War conditions will at least be
suggested in this distribution of troops,
because all assignments are made to
stations where there are neither quar
ters nor barracks, and the details will
go into camp and live just as they
would were they actually participants
in a campaign. Artillery troops and
signal corps are affected by the orders.
Boston's modern fortifications on
Long Island Head, at the entrance of
the harbor, form splendid protection
for the city. By to-morrow night they
will be garrisoned by a battery of the
Second Artillery, which will be moved
up from Fort Adams, Rhode Island.
Sandy Hook's big guns, which are
relied upon to keep an enemy's ship
from approaching New York, are to
have a large complement before Friday
night. Two batteries will be sent there
from Fort Slocurn, from Fort Hamilton
and a third from Fort Wadsworth.
Fort Monroe is one of the strongest
and best equipped stations on the
coast, and is able to part with some of j
its defenders. One battery of the First
Artillery will be sent from there to
Fort Morgan, Alabama, which, in con
junction with Fort Gailes, controls the
entrance to Mobile Bay. Another bat- i
tery of the First Artillery, which is
also at Fort Monroe, will be hurried to
Tybee Island, Georgia, which gives pro
tection to the mouth of the Savannah
River. St. Francis Barracks at St. Au
gustine, Fla., will be abandoned in or
der that men may be had for more
commanding positions.
The garrison headquarters band and
a battery of the First Artillery will be
transferred to-morrow to Sullivans Isl
and in Charleston harbor, South Caro-
Battery I of the Second Artillery,
which is commanded by Captain Cas
eire, will go to Fort Coswell, which is
on the mainland opposite Smiths Isl
and, at the entrance of the bay of
Wilmington, North Carolina.
To strengthen the defenses of the na
tional capital one battery from the
fort's artillery has been ordered to go
from Fort Monroe to the defensive
works at Sheridan's Point, Va. This
fort is opposite Fort Washington, Md.,
and both of them control the Potomac
River several miles below Washington.
From the division of the Fourth Ar
tillery, stationed at Fort McHenry, Bal
timore, one battery will go to Fort Del
aware, Del., and Battery I, Fourth Ar
tillery, will be sent to Fort Mott, N. J.
These two movements of troops are for
the protection of Philadelphia, Trenton,
Camden and other populous cities of
that section. The forts that will safe
guard them are at the entrance of the
; upper Delaware River.
One battery of the First Artillery,
which is at Jackson Barracks, New Or
leans, will be sent to the bank of Mis

WAR' SEEMS CERTAIN
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
If Honduras Helps Nicaragua, Salva
dor Will Support Costa
Rica.
Copyrighted. 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA. March 10.â Advices received
from the Herald's correspondents at vari
ous- points in Central America state that
war clouds are still hovering over those
turbulent countries. The correspondent
in La Libertad, Salvador, says the situ
ation between Costa Rica and Nicaragua
is very serious, and that it is reported
that troops have already gone to the
field. It is thought that Honduras will
aid Nicaragua in a war against Costa
Rica, and it is reported that Honduras
has already sent 5000 armed men to Nic
aragua to combine with the latter coun
try's forces.
Salvador, meanwhile, is exerting all her
efforts to avert war, but the government
is resolved not to take any part where
Nicaragua is concerned. A well-known
diplomat in Salvador says that in case
of the intervention of Honduras. Salva
dor will neutralize her action. The only
interpretation is that should Honduras
h*lp Nicaragua, Salvador will support
Costa Rica In the struggle.
Guatemala's envoy has left Nicaragua
for Costa Rica, carrying important docu
ments which will decide whether the Cen
tral American countries will plunge into
war or not.
It is the general belief that there will
be war in which three or more Central
American countries will be involved.

BLAINE TO MARRY
KUHNE BEVERIDGE
The Announcement of the En
gagement Is Made at
New York.
It Was Not Very Much of a Surprise
to Their " Friends at the
â Â - East.
Bpecfal Dispatch to The, Call.
NEW YORK, March 10.â It is unofficial
ly announced that James G. Blame, eon
of the dead statesman, and Miss Kuhne
Beveridge, the sculptor, are to be mar
ried; Miss Beverldge is now in Paris
visiting her mother, and the wedding will
take place, It Is said, When she returns
to this country next month. The news
of the coming wedding is not entirely a
surprise to the friends of either Mr
Blame or Miss Beverldge, as they have
often been seen together of late, and Mr.
Blame's attentions extend over a period
of more than two years.
Both Mr. Blame and Miss Beveridge
have been married and both are sepa
rated by divorce from their former part
ners. For some time Miss Beveridge has
lived and had her studio in a remodeled
stable building on East Seventeenth
street, where a card in her own large
handwriting did duty for a doorplate.
Mr. Blame Is employed as a reporter on
a local morning paper. He married in
September, 18S6, Miss Marie Nevins of
Columbus, Ohio, who was at that time an
actress with Modjeska. The Blame fam
ily objected strenuously to the match and
a" separation was nearly effected, but
young Blame and his wife moved to
Pittsburg, whore h-* worked as a reporter.
Marital troubles beg Sin soon aftÂ«r that,
and on February 20, 1889, Judge Thomas
at Deadwo'd, S. D., granted Mrs. Blame
a decree of divorce and custody of their
child. She had alleged great cruelty on
the part of her husband. Afterward Mrs.
Blame married Dr. W. T. Bull of this
city, who had attended her during a crit
ical illness.
Miss Beveridge was at one time wife of
Charles Coghlan, the actor. They were
divorced on September 27, 1894. Much of
Miss Beveridge's life has been spent in
California.
DESERTED HIS
WIFE AND BABE
Arrest of Pearl R. Brown,
Formerly a Bicycle Mer
chant of Salinas.
He Abducts the Child While the
Mother Is Temporarily Ab
sent From HornÂ©.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, March 10.â A cruel case of
desertion by a husband and abduction of
a child has come to light by the arrest
last night of Pearl R. Brown, a bicycle
merchant of this city. The charge pre
ferred against the man has been pending
for several months, but has never been
pressed, owing to the delicacy of Mrs.
Brown.
Brown left nis wife five months ago in
destitute circumstances and with an in
fant. He would have been brought back
on a charge of desertion, but he agreed
to deliver his wife all the property he
possessed, provided she would not press
the charge. The matter was therefore
dropped, but not dismissed.
About two months ago Brown returned
to the county anu took up his residence
in Castroville, while his wife and baDy
lived in this city. Yesterday, while Mrs.
Brown was absent from home, her hus
band came to this city, and, going to her
house, abducted the child and took it to
Castroville. On Mrs. trown's return she
found that the child was gone, but sur
mised what had ecome of it. She pre
sented tne new facts in the cane to the
authorities, and the officers went in pur
suit of Brown, and at once found him in
Castroville. .
Brown was arraigned in the Justice
Court to-day, pleaded not guilty, and was
admitted to bail, which was furnished by
J. C. Brown, father of the defendant, and
C. E. Brown, brother of the accused man.
The charge of abduction will in all Proba
bility be placed against Brown in addi
tion to the present charge. La .te tnis
evening Deputy Sheriff Nesbitt left for
Castroville to get possession of the child.

Owners of Vessels Con
fer With the Naval
Officials.
Mapping Out Plans for the

of Merchantmen.
Work on Warships in the Several
Navy Yards Progressing Fa
vorably.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. March 10.â The
United States Government has not yet
acquired a single additional ship for
the navy. This is true not because of
a lack of offers of warships, but simply
for the reason that the Navy Depart
ment is proceeding with all the circum
spection consistent with the needs of
the case in looking after the qualities
and prices of the craft. There is a j
strong disposition to refrain from being ;
drawn into bad bargains and to insist
upon getting good vessels at prices not
extortionate.
Secretary Long was in receipt of a
large number of cablegrams to-day, al
most all relating to offers of ships.
Lieutenant Nibleck, the United States
naval attache at Berlin, St. Peters- i
burg and Vienna, is particularly active i
in the quef t of vessels. There was a !
good deal of talk during the day about I
assignment of officers to the command !
of the auxiliary cruisers, the St. Paul
and St. Louis being especially men
tioned, but Secretary Long set these
stories at rest by the statement that he
had not made any such assignments,
and had only proceeded to the point of j
informing himself of the facilities for j
getting the ships officered and manned
quickly.
While looking after new ships the
officials of the Navy Department are '
not neglecting the old vessels, and ar
rangements have been made to make
quick repairs on several ships that in
ordinary course would not be treated
in that fashion, but would receive a j
thorough and time-consuming over- I
hauling. Thus in the case of the Phila- j
delphia, which has had five years 1 hard i
work and has never yet been gone over, i
as is the custom, orders have gone to
Mare Island to put her into shape for
sea within forty days. The Yorktown
ll not to be touched at the present, not â 
only because she is in fair condition, ,
but also because she is not so formid
able a craft as to make it desirable to
divert to her repair attention required
elsewhere.
At Norfolk the Newark is set down
for thirty days' repairs, and as a good
deal of work has already been done on
her she will be almost a new ship when
she comes out of the yard. The big
monitor Puritan has practically com
pleted her repairs.
The monitor Camanche at Mare
Island has been examined and found in
tolerable condition.
At League Island the monitor Mian
tonomoh and the ram Katahdin went
into commission to-day, although they
have not yet had their orders. They ;
probably will remain in the Delaware i
River or drop down into the bay. The
torpedo-boat Dupont sailed to-day from
Mobile to attach herself again to the
flotilla at Key West.
A conference was held at 3 o'clock in
the office of Assistant Secretary Roose
velt to map out plans for arming and
equipping merchant vessels as auxili- ;
ary cruisers. Mr. Roosevelt presided
and others present were Captain
Crowninshield of the Bureau of Navi- j
gation, Captain O'Neil of the Bureau of
Ordnance, Chief Hlchborne of the Bu
reau of Construction, and Commander
Bradford of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks. This meeting had been pre
ceded by a call from President Gris
com of the International Navigation
Company, which owns the St. Louis,
St. Paul, Paris and New York. The
board meeting brought out a general
discussion of the work the various bu
reaus would be called upon to perform ,
in making these and other vessels
ready as auxiliary cruisers. About S)o
per cent of this work would fall to the
lot of the Bureau of Construction,
which would have charge of installing
magazines, gun mounts, light protec
tive armor for the guns and magazines
and the circles on which the guns
swing This work, it is said, could be
accomplished readily within two weeks'
time, as all materials, except the guns,
are in hand. The Bureau of Ordnance
could not supply all the guns required
within that short time, although some
seventy or more are now available. The
supply would be adequate, however, for
the most effective auxiliary cruisers
and the complete armament of the
merchant ships could proceed as rap
idly as possible thereafter.
On the question of manning the aux
iliary fleet, the Navy Department feels
that the most effective step would be
to enlist into the United States naval
service the present merchant crews of
the several ships. These crews are
thoroughly familiar with the vessels
and could handle them with far greater
effect than green crews of blue jackets.
The ships would be officered from the
line of the regular navy. In the case
of enlisting a merchant crew the pay
and allowances would be about equiv
alent to the rates paid ordinary sailors
and the time of enlistment would
doubtless be limited to short periods.
The proposed batteries for the aux
iliary cruisers consist, in the case of
the steamships St. Louis and St. Paul,
of eight 6-inch guns, four 6-pounders
and four machine guns; the Paris and
New York, twelve 6-lnch guns, six 6
pounders and six machine guns. It is
designed to give vessels of the Caracas
and Seneca type a main battery of
eight 4-inch guns and from six to eight
rapid-fire machine guns. Those of the
Vigilancia class are designed to have a
main battery 'of six 5-inch and four
4-inch guns, four 1-pounders and three
machine guns. The batteries of the
auxiliary cruisers on the Pacific Coast,
if those should be called into use, are
substantially similar, 6-inch guns be
ing the largest designed for use in that
service.
The Navy Department finds itself In
comparatively good condition as to the
supply of automobile torpedoes, which
constitute one of the most deadly en
gines of naval destruction. The White
head torpedo is now in general use, al
though a few of the Powell class are
still on hand. Fifty of the Whitehead
torpedoes were procured a short time
ago. and with these there is* total of
about' 350 on hand. This gives not
only n.full outfit for vessels now in
commission, but also the necessary re
serve supply.
SAYS McCOY IS A FAKER.
PITTSBURG. March 10.â M. J. Connel
ly. Peter Maher's manager, says:
"Kid McCoy's claim to the heavyweight
championship is a farce. He told me In
a personal interview that he was afraid
.of Maher. He said: '1 am challenging
champions, but fighting suckers.' Our
$6000 forfeit is still in the hands of Sam
Austin for any man in the world to cover,
and until McCoy fights a top-notcher his
claim is ridiculous. Maher has whipped
both men McCoy is after now.'
HAVANA WILL
BUY A CRUISER
Spanish Residents Plan
to Raise Necessary-
Funds.
Intend to Present a Modern
Warship to the Mother
Country.
Public Subscription Will Be Opened
in Support of the Desired
Project.
Copyrighted. 18S8, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, March 10.â Loyal Havana
is planning to build or purchase for
Spain a man-of-war of the improved
type. By prearrangement El Diario,
La Union, El Commercio and other
newspapers, in editorials to-day, appeal
to the patriotism of the residents of
Havana to raise the necessary funds
for the purchase of the best war ves
sel in the market, to be presented to the
mother country as a demonstration of
Cuba's loyalty. There is also announced
in these newspapers that a grand en
tertainment will be held in Lacon The
ater, the proceeds to go toward the
fund. Boxes and seats will be sold at
auction, and it is expected that the
prices in the aggregate will reach far
into the thousands. A public subscrip
tion will be promptly opened.
The name of the cruiser is already
chosen. It will be Isla de Cuba.
The papers editorially announce that
Spain must be in a position to- stand
for her honor in case of trouble with
any nation, and that the residents of
Havana will not expend their money in
purchasing ships to challenge any oth
er nation, but for the reason that they
love peace and so must be prepared for
war.
La Lucha's editorial says that the
Lord only knows what the sensational
Journals of the United States will in
vent next to lead their country into war
with Spain. It says Americans are a
great people, and in the last few years
have progressed wonderfully in every
direction. Tt adds that they appear to
have sound judgment, but lack cool
ness, and are hysterical and fond of
dreaming. They are giante, the edito
rial asserts, with the heart and the un
derstanding of children, and it is in
critical moments that their weaknesses
are betrayed. __
OFFICIALS WERE
TOO DILIGENT
Why the Fees of an Antioch
Justice of the Peace Were
, Enormous.
Special Dispatch Jo The Can.
ANTIOCH, March 10.â There has been
considerable talk on the streets about the
large number of men who have been ar
rested for vagrancy and who, as soon as
tuey were put on trial, were dismissed,
as there was clearly no reason to send
them to the County Jail. The bills of va
rious Justices of the Peace have been
enormous and there have been very few,
if any, convictions.
On Monday nig - D. M. Pitts and C E.
Sweeney gathered in ten men and locked
them up as usual on a charge of vagran
cy. Some of the cmzens, hearing of the
haul, determined to visit Justice Gribble's
court, where the men were to be tried,
and investigate, x-ccordlngly, just aner
the prisoners had been brought into court
the citizens filed quietly in. They listened
careiully to each case. As each man was
questioned he pleaded guilty to vagrancy,
and then proceeded to tell a story that
contradicted his plea. Each made
the same plea of guilty, and the
similarity of their pleas made it appear
as though they had been coached before
hand as to what to say. â¢
After the court had finished with the
prisoners the citizens asked permt sion to
ask some questions and to make gome re
marks. The prisoners were carefully ex
amined, and it was found that some of
them had been up before Judge Gnuble
the day before on the same identical
charge, and that their cases had been
dismissed. It was also found ihat some
of the prisoners had been before Judge
Tyler two days before. None of them had
been in town before Sunday, and in the
three days they had been here most of
them had been arrested twice, and each
time it had cost >.- c county $3.
After the citizens had clearly shown
that the men were not guilty of vag
rancy and should not have been arrested,
they proceeued to question the court and
constable on their mode of issuing war
rants and of making arrests. The Justice
admitted that he thought it was his duty
to issue a warrant to the constable when
ever he made a demand for one. He was
instructed that this was not the case, and
that he should investigate the case by
questioning the constable and find out
whether there was a reasonable amount
of evidence against the man before is
suing the warrant. Some very caustic
and pointed questions were -ut to the
court and its officers by the citizens.

PROMOTION FOR
GENERAL MILES
The Grade o? Lieutenant-
General May Be
Revived.
By Virtue of His Rank He
Would Receive the Ap
pointment.
Proposed Change Would Malta No
Difference in His Official
Status.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Should
the Senate and House act favorably on
the joint resolution presented to-day
from the Senate Committee on Mili
tary Affairs to revive the grade of
Lieutenant-General of the army, Ma
jor-General Miles will be promoted to
that rank. The grade of Lieutenant-
Oeneral which was revived for General
Schofield a few months before his re
tirement lapsed with that retirement.
The purpose of the resolution is to
permanently establish the grade. It
would be in the power of the President
to promote any one of three major
generals to fill it. but it is well under
stood that Major-General Miles, senior
major-general, now in command of
the army by virtue of that rank, # will
receive the appointment.
His promotion will make no differ
ence in the official status of General
Miles in relation to the army. Under
the President he is now commander-in
chief of the army, and he will continue
to exercise the same duties upon hia
promotion to the higher grade. As
major-general he receives $7500 and al
lowances. As lieutenant-general ha
will receive $11,000 and increased al
lowances.
He will also, be entitled to a largfl
official staff, composed of officers -of
higher grade than the staff of major
general.
In the event of war, whether given
the highest or not, General Miles
will have command of all the land
forces of the United States, including
the regular army and any volunteer
forces or State militia that may b*
called into the service of the United
States. Whether he takes the field in
person or not will depend largely upon
his own wishes or the wishes of the
President. Should the operations of
the army be extended over a wide ter
ritory, the President might deem it
better to have the general in com
mand stationed at Washington, from
which point he could maintain general
supervision over all separated com
mands, but should the operations be
confined to a limited area it is highly
probable that he would take the fieid
in person and conduct the campaign
against the enemy.

HAVANA. March 10.â Believing that
its proceedings may be reviewed by an
international court of inquiry and ar
bitration, the present court of inquiry
is proceeding with such care and delib
eration as to give many the false im
pression that it is killing time. This
came to me to-day from a distinguished
officer of the navy, whose sources of
information are scarcely inferior to
those of the court itself. After admit
ting that the pressure of secrecy had
been somewhat relieved and that the
administration will soon be ready to
take the people into its confidence, this
gentleman said:
"Those who believe that the Court
of Inquiry is unnecessarily prolonging
the inquest simply for the purpose of
giving the authorities in Washington
an opportunity to gain time so that
popular indignation over the destruc
tion of the Maine may be allayed, or to
accomplish other results are in error.
"It was not desired that the court
should make its report before last Sat
urday, but President McKlnley has in
formed Captain Sampson that he is
pirrafsi now ') receive it as soon as
Che co\irt is ready to make it.
"It must nut be understood, either,
that the delay is an indication of in
decision. I can assure you that the
court has come to a final decision in
the matter. All further delay is the
result of great caution and a realization
that the investigation is unique in the
naval history of the world, and every
possible precaution against blunder
must be taken. What the result of its
findings will be the court does not pre
tend to know. Its report may be fol
lowed by prompt action one way or
another by the administration' or may
result in "the convening of a court of
â¢inquiry and arbitration composed of
representatives of all the great na
tions of the world.
"In either event it is the intention of
the court that the evidence which it
has accumulated shall be in shape and
order and so plain that it can be un
derstood by any intelligent mind. This
is the real explanation of the prolonga
tion of the work of the court. This
is why every detail is being gone over
with tiresome care. For this reason
facts and figures concerning the wreck
are being noted and placed in compari
son with the original plans of the
Maine. Measurements are still being
taken and will continue to be taken,
and the results will be preserved until
there remains absolutely nothing more
to be done. Then the findings of the
court will practically be a mathemati
cal conclusion, the logic of which can
not be evaded.
"It is not to be understood that the
Court of Inquiry is preparing its re
port with the idea that it is to be
placed before a higher tribunal, or that
the members consider the convening of
an international court of inquiry and
arbitration as possible. They are sim
ply preparing for all emergencies, and
by so doing demonstrating' that the
trust and confidence placed in them
are merited. Evidence which has been
readily understood by them, acquainted
as they are with the architectural con
struction of the Maine, and having
practically given personal inspection to
every twisted beam in the wreck, may
appear complicated and obscure to
others. Light is being shed upon every
detail and explanatory material is still
being gathered at a time when less
thorough and conscientious men
would already have made their report.
"They will continue" along this line
ns long as there Is a new thing to be
learned. Then, and not till then, will they
leave Havana. The conclusion wilWbe
reached immediately after the last evi
dence? has been taken. Last night the
Court of Inquiry did not know when it
would be ready to stop Investigation.
It may soon come to a conclusion, and
Its work may be continued another
fortnight. But one thing you may as
sure the readers of the Herald: The
Court of Inquiry is not in the busi
ness of killing time."
This interview and the facts therein
stated may be received by the public
with as absolute confidence as though
they bore the stamp of the Court of
Inquiry official sanction. The Herald
has been made the vehicle for the con
vey%nceÂ«of this Information to the
American people and the world at large.
For several reasons the Court of In
quiry has been somewhat sensitive un
der the charge, 1 openly made In some
quarters, and frequently Implied in
others, that Its present operations are
only for time-killing purposes. The
court's members also resent, the dispo
sition on the part of certain 111-ad- j
vised jingoistic war organs jto ! make It
appear that the court's real conclu- |
sions were reached long ago and with
out such careful deliberation as should
characterize a body eharced with â¢ a
task of the most grave magnitude. Ap
preciating that the Herald's course has
been far different, that it has at no
time endeavored to force conclusions on
the public unwarranted by facts and
has not attributed to the court; or to j
witnesses statements warped and dis- ;
torted or wholly Imaginative. It' is nat
ural that through the- Herald persons
very close to the court' itself should I
seek to set at rest innuendos alike in
jurious to the dignity of the court and
harmful of public Interests.
With the cobwebs brushed aside and I
| a clear insight obtained into the court's
I preparations, it is possible to under-
I stand many things hitherto obscure to
i the public.
Some comment was caused when Mr.
; Bissell, official stenographer, was per-
I mitted to return to Washington, Mr.
I Hulse. his colleague having gunr north
some days before him. The simple
, fact is that the actual taking of new
: testimony was practically finished
i some days acÂ». The work now being
j done is mainly statistical, structural
and confirmatory in character. It con
sists largely in careful measurements
with photographs of the details of the
j wreck, verification by divers of the
1 condition of certain portions of the hull
under water, the position of armor
plates and scores of other details ln
: volvlng expert knowledge.
This is why the court's work of late
has been almost exclusively with such
persons as Naval Constructor Hoover.
Carpenter Helms. Mr. Powelson, Chief
Engineer Howell and most of all with
I the divers. This is why members of
: the court have actually spent hours on
the diver's floats personally directing
i thp submarine work.
This kind of work is necessarily slow.
1 What might be gained In speed would
jbe at the sacrifice of thoroughness. Much
lof it also is disappointing. Mr. Helms.
I know, had repeatedly directed the
divers to descend at a point which
should be directly over some particular
part of the ship from which Special in
; formation was desired. 'The divers
'â  spent perhaps an hour under water
without being able to accomplish the
! desired purpose, but thl6 does not indi
cate that they were working blindly.
It is only further proof of how com
pletely the structure was blown to
fragments.
Whole sections of the ship's Interior,
sections with which Mr. Helms was so
familiar that he could once have laid
j hands on them in the dark, seem to
â  have disappeared out of this chaotic
: mass. From a veritable submarine
; labyrinth must be extracted hard
i mathematical truths, truths that will
i carry conviction, not only in Washing-
I ton and Madrid, but, if necessary, to
j the minds of wholly disinterested ex
! perts, who might ultimately be sum
. moned to act as an international court
jof arbitration. This problem is now
i confronting: the Court of Inquiry. Its
I members are meeting it coolly, intelli
1 gently and discreetly and as expedi
tiously as its magnitude warrants.
Whatever their findings may be, they
are anxious that they shall be such as
! will stand the severest tests to which
they may be subjected, either at home
â¢ or abroad.
WHALEBACK FLEET
FOR WAR VESSELS.
1 Thirty-five Monster Lake Steamships
Which Could Be Added to
the Navy.
NEW YORK, March 10.â Thirty-five
I great naval fighting machines would
| be added to Uncle Sam's outfit in case
jof war with Spain. Cleveland would
contribute these fighting machines.
Men who know say that the Cleveland
i contribution would strengthen the navy
lat least 50 per cent. Government offi
! cials are already considering plans.
Their idea is to turn the whaleback
! fleet of the great lakes into war ves
i sels. It is asserted that this could be
i done at slight cost and that the whale
i backs would be formidable vessels.
j They would be especially valuable for
coast defense purposes. One great fea
ture of the whalebacks as war boats is
that they can be almost entirely sub
merged. When they are thus sub
merged only about one foot of de.-k
shows above the water. Marine men
and Government officials agree that
! with the addition of a couple of turrets
and with a ram forward these boats
would be serviceable in case of war.
1 There are thirty-five of the whaleback
i steamers. They are owned by the
| American Steam Barge Company, with
â  headquarters in Cleveland.
TRIED TO BEACH
THE MONTGOMERY.
Perhaps That Ship Is Not Safer Than
the Maine Was in the Harbor
of Havana.
BOSTON, March 10.â James Healy of
this city is an electrician on board the
cruiser Mo-ntgomery. The following let
ter, dated Key West, was received from
him to-day by Philip Connell:
"We had orders to take a pilot going
into every Spanish port. Now, out of
these four ports that we entered the pi
lot ran us hJgh and dry, and the last time
we never would have got off but for a
Ward Line steamer. At first we
thought it was only an accident, but
events have set us thinking in a differ
ent way now. We know beyond a
doubt that the Maine was blown up
from the outside, and we will have
war."
TRAINING SHIP MOHICAN

be Dusbed as rapidly *b possible.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 11, 1898.
MR. PROCTOR
IS NOT DOING
MUCH TALKING
Received Nothing but Cour
tesy at the Hands of
Spanish Officials.
Admits That the Condition of the
People of Cuba Is as De
plorable as It Can Be.
Copyrighted. IS9*. by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST. Fla., March 10.âSena
tor Proctor and his companion, M. M.
Parker of Washington, both of whom
returned yesterday from an extended
trip in Cuba, leave Key West, for
Washington to-night. Senator Proctor
said he had a good time and a good
opportunity to see the condition of
affairs in the island. He visited the
provinces of Pinar del Rio, Matanzas
and Santa Clara.
Of the condition of the people Mr.
Proctor said he could add nothing to
what was already known of their suf
fering and starvation. He had been
gratified to find relief supplies being
distributed in a way to do the most
good and at a very small cost. He
spoke in high terms of the energy and
ability of Mr. Elwell. the agent of the
Cuban Relief Commission, and of the
work of Miss Clara Barton. Mr. Proc
tor added that while not himself a
specialist in charitable work, he had
been much interested in the way the
supplies sent from America are being
distributed, and that he had been im
pressed with the efficient manner in
which the work is being conducted.
He said many courtesies had been
shown him by the Spanish officials,
and among them he had not observed
any marked anti-American feeling.
Mr. Parker was more outspoken in
referring to the condition of the starv
ing Cubans. Not half the horrors of
that land, he said, had ever been told.
In JUatanzas he had been officially in
formed that 6700 had died of starva
tion during the last three months. Vis
iting the place where some reconcen
trados were herded ftie saw three die
during the few minutes he was there.
He found the same condition exist
ing in other parts of the island. No
whatever he said were made by
the Spanish Government to feed the
reconcentrados. The Government had
herded them in cities and towns and
left them to subsist on charity or
.starve. Hosj ital wards are over
crowded, he says, 'with these wretched
people, while houses, parks and boule
vards swarm with others in equally
desperate straits. The dead, who are
too numerous to receive prompt and
proper burial, are strewn everywhere.
The whole picture of ghastliness is be
yond the imagination, and renders the
crime of concentration the crowning
shame of the nineteenth century.
Referring to the resignation of Con
sul Barker of Sagua. Mr. Parkor said
he thought it was the outcome of an
apparent lack of appreciation and sup
port of Mr. Barkers representations
and appeals by the authorities at
Washington in behalf of the starving
Cubans. No conception of its enormity
was possible except by being constant
ly besieged by these people, begging
for sustenance for themselves and their
destitute children. His health, too, was
being gradually undermined by'the dis
tress that surrounded him.
Both Senator Proctor and Mr. Par
ker paid the highest tribute to the
patriotism and abnegation of Consul
Barker, who. they declared, was a most
excellent representative of the Ameri
can Government. They said they had
best of reason? to believe his resigna
tion had been withdrawn.
They gave a most graphic and amus
ing description of the skirmish between
a company of Spanish cavalry and a
handful of insurgents which took place
while they were on a train near Matan
zas, and which was undoubtedly pre
pared for their especial benefit. Before
reaching the station they noticed that
the telegraph wires had been cut and
some slight obstructions placed on the
track to impede their progress. On a
hill in the distance they could see the
silhouettes of a dozen Cuban insur
gents outlined against the sky. In the
valley the Spanish cavalry had started
toward them, but they were brought to
a sudden halt by bullets from the
enemy.
The distance was too great to h^ar
the shots, but the smoke from the Cu
bans' rifles gave warning of what wap
taking place. The Spaniards halted
and formed ;. hollow square, while the
officers sought safety behind some con
venient trees. Meanwhile the insur
gents called for a truce and withdrew
into the dense woods, and the Span
iards returned to the station in time to
meet the train and receive the con
gratulations of the commander of the
district. All this byplay struck Sena
tor Proctor as most amusing war tac
tics.
An old Confederate war veteran who
accompanied the party asked the
Spanish officer in command why he had
not given chase to the insurgents, as
there were not more than a dozen of
them. His' reply was characteristic.
He sold there were more than a thou
sand behind the hills. The story is told
that each member of that cavalry troop
has already received a medal in com
memoration of his bravery in the bat
tle.
SUCCESSFUL TEST OF
RAPID-FIRE GUNS.
Remarkable Velocity Attained by
Bullets From the Automatic
Colt.
NEW YORK, March 10. â Several
hundred extra mechanics are employed
at the Brooklyn Navy-yard. The dis
patch boat Dolphin has a swarm , of
painters and about a hundred mechan
ics rushing work upon her. It is said
at the yard that the' orders are that
the Dolphin must be ready In two
weeks. Much work is being done on
the cruisers Chicago and . Atlanta.
Work on the torpedo : boat Stiletto will
be completed. by the end of the week,
when she will be ready for sea. - '
â  A test was made to-day of one of a
consignment of rapid fire guns Just re
ceived from the Colt factory at Hart
ford. It is known as the six-millimeter
rapid fire automatic Colt and is capa
ble of firing 200 shots a minute with a
range of 2000 yards; The test: proved
that the bullet i would ' pass through a
steel plate %; of an inch thick, two
sides of & cell of -pipe, twenty inrb.nÂ« o*
wood backing and another steel plate
% of an Inch in thickness. These guns,
of which three have arrived, will be
used along the rails of vessels against
torpedo boats and also in the fighting
tops.
A large Quantity of ammunition for
use in the rapid fire guns arrived at
the yard to-day. Supplies and ammu
nition detained for Key West and
league Island navy-yard are being
placed on barges. A barge laden with
5-inch ritV-s. shells and powder was
towed to the Jersey City docks for
shipment. pxHumably for the cruisers
Minneapolis and Columbia at Philadel
phia.
NAVAL APPROPRIATION
NEARLY COMPLETED.
Few Changes From the Estimates,
and Then Only In the Line
of Increases.
WASHINGTON, March 10.â The na
val appropriation bill has been practi
cally completed by the House Commit
tee on Naval Affairs, save as to the
questions of increases in the navy, dry
docks and armor plute. Chairman Bou
telle said to-night he might report the
bill to the House on Saturday, and if
not it will go in early next week.
There have been few changes from
the estimates, and the bill will involve
in the neighborhood of 530,000,000 -aside
from new vessels, drydocks and armor.
The lncreas< s allowed are such as to
meet the gradual development of the
service. The general item for construc
tion and repair, just passed on, aggre
gates $2,500,000, identical with the esti
mate?. Thia includes about $370,000, a
material Increase, for improved ma
chinery at the shops. The amount in
exclusive cf the specific appropriations
to the various construction plants, etc.
There is a horizontal appropriation
proposed of $50,000 to each of the yards,
except the Puget Sound station, in lieu
of the general estimate of $300,000. The
appropriation- for the naval academy
at Annapolis go through practically
untouched.
There was a long discussion in com
mittee to-day over the additional land
wanted for tt*e V it Royal, S. C. sta
tion, hut an a ppr- p rifhion of $20,300 for
the purposes was tinally allowed.
ORDERED TO ENGAGE
TWO THOUSAND SEAMEN.
Mission of a Board Created by Direc-
tion of the Navy De
partment.
NEW YORK. March 10â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: In ad
dition to buying shell, ihe Navy De
partment is determined to make a large
increase in the navy and marine corps,
which will be available for service on
board vessels which it is proposed to
purchase and auxiliary cruisers
should they be placed In commission. A
board was appointed to-day, consist
ing of Lieutenant-Commander J. M.
Hfiwley, Chief Engineer Harry Web
ster, Surgeon R. C. Persons and Car
penter, which will leave to-morrow for
New Orleans, Galveston, Mississippi
j River ports, including Memphis, Nash
! ville. St. Louis, Savannah and Mobile,
i Ala.
The board has been directed to en
gage 2000 seamen and machinists, and
not to return to Washington until this
number has been obtained. For ma
chinists, the board desires skilled me
chanics who have been at sea, and for
seamen men who have been on salt
water in large vessels. The depart
ment is considering the advisability of
instructing naval officers on duty

JAPAN'S
WARNING
TO RUSSIA
Last Protest Against
the Seizure of Port
Arthur.
Will Retain Wei-Hai-
Wei if the Czar Does
Not Desist.
Admiralty Orders Haste in the
Building of New Men
of-War.
WILL NOT SELL CRUISERS.
Those Being Built at American Ship
yards Are Not on the
Market.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 11.â The Morning
says it learns that Japan has warned
Russia that if the latter retains Port
Arthur, Japan will retain "Wei-Hai-Wei
and the islands adjacent. The same
paper says the Japanese admiralty has
ordered the men-of-war bulldingabroad
to be hurried, and it denies the reoprt
that Japan will sell the cruisers now
building at Philadelphia and San Fran
cisco.
The Yokohama correspondent of the
Times says: "Japan is calm, and the
Government does not expect war."
BERLIN, March 10.â News of the
naval credit was received here with
equanimity as justifying the German
naval' bill. The Bourse even rose on
the expectations of the German iron
trade.
The Kiaochau treaty, it is said, con
tains concessions for the construction
of railways and the working of mines
In* the Shantung Peninsula, together
with grants to Germany of a prefer
ence in all public enterprises involving
by co-operation of foreigners in that
province.
SHANGHAI, March 10.â An English
steamer has successfully ascended the
Yung Tse Rapids as far as Chung King,
province of Sze Chwen, at the junction
of the Kia Lin Kiang with the Yang
Tse, thus opening to navigation the
most fertile tract of the Yang Tse Val
ley. The Chinese authorities have an
nounced their intention to remove all
obstacles with dynamite.
ENGLAND'S OUTLAY
IN NAVAL WORKS.
Official Estimates Amount to More
Than Twenty-Five Million
Pounds.
LONDON, March 10.â The First Lord
of the Admiralty, the Hon. George J.
Goschen, In presenting the naval esti
mates to the House of Commons to
day, pointed out that, with the outlay-
In naval works, the .expenditure
amounted to the colossal sum Â£25.550,
000 ($127,750,000), which, he explained,
was even considered inadequate In
come quarters.
Continuing, Mr. Goschen explained
that the navy was in a transitional
state, to which many of the admitted
deficiencies were due. Moreover, he
added, the Government was introduc
ing a series of improvements. The Ju
bilee display had been great, but the
navy had not reached the ideal stand
ard.
Referring to the channel squa/lron,
Mr. Goschen said it was the most pow
erful ever gathered together, its du
ties being not only to parade the chan
nel, but to engage in offensive opera
tions in time of war. Continuing, he
dilated upon the quiet and unostenta
tious increase of the British fleet in
Chinese waters by four vessels from
other foreign stations, as beine an in
stance of the naval preparedness.
Later, Mr. Goschen said he hoped the
Admiralty would not be too hard press
ed to communicate its plans, but he as
sured the House that in the distribution
of cruisers, for instance, the Admiralty
had considered carefully the protection
of every trade and every food supply
route, and he trusted that, "if times
darkened," the Admiralty would have
the confidence of the House, and the
Admiralty would be found doing its
duty.
Touching upon the increase in the
personnel of the navy, he said there
was no lack of recruits for the service.
In fact, only one in eight buys were
accepted, and the supply of stokers
was also improving. He denied that
the navy was under-manned, declaripg
that every vessel which took part in
the Jubilee review was as fully manned
as it would be in war time. He admit
ted there was a paucity of officers, but
he explained that that would be easily
remedied.
The discussion was then dropped.

MISS HEFFRON
TO SUE HARRY
CORSON CLARKE
Has Been Discharged by the
Comedian and Says Sh)e
Was Insulted.
PORTLAND, Or., March 10.â Comedian Harry Corson Clarke is in
more trouble. He has discharged Miss Heffron, who played Mar
gery, the interesting daughter of Professor Goodly, in "What Hap
pened to Jones." Miss Heffron intends to bring suit for part of her
salary, which is unpaid, and for personal damages, which she alleges
she sustained in Marysville on account of brutal treatment at the
hands of Clarke.
Miss Heffron is a cousin of B. A. Worthington, private secretary of
H. E. Huntington, the railroad magnate of San Francisco, and a sis
ter of Thomas H. Heffron, private secretary of the Southern Pacific
master mechanic at Sacramento. Her home is In San Francisco. She
received her dismissal last night at the close of the Portland engage
ment, and the company went to Vancouver to-day without her. She
left this evening for San Francisco, where she intends to bring suit.
Speaking to The Call correspondent, Miss Heffron said that ever
since the company closed the first week's engagement at the Colum
bia Theater in San Francisco Mr. Clarke had acted toward every
member as If he had lost his reason. Even his mother, who played
the pact of Professor Goodly's wife, has not been spared insult and hu
miiiatron at his hands.
"Two weeks ago at Marysville," she said, "without tfte least cause
or provocation he called me up in the pfesenec of the company and
began such a torrent of abuse, mingled with the foulest oaths, that I
fainted, and in the fall struck my head, and have not yet fully re
covered from the injuries received. He sent for a physician for me,
but refused to pay the bill. I was dismissed without the least com
plaint ever having been offered of iry work upon the stage. It seems
to have been a case of caprice on the part of Mr. Clarke that would
lead one to believe that his well-known nervousness amounts now al
most to insanity. He has been at all times quarrelsome, showing the
most vicious anger when any member of the company besides himself
received applause, and he has made it as uncomfortable as possible
for every one with him, without exception. His mother has fared
little better than the rest of us. The story told by Miss Effie Warner,
who was discharged, is absolutely true and can be vouched for by every
member of the company. As sx>n as I reach San Francisco, and
have an opportunity to consult with my friends, I will begin a damage
suit against Mr. Clarke."
Miss Warner is engaged to be married to Bert Dasher, manager
for Hoyt's "A Stranger in New York" company, whfch comes to Seat
tle next week on the same date as Mr. Clarke's company. Mr. Dasher
ia highly incensed at the treatment his fiance has received and when
he meets Clarke some one will be able to write a play about "What
Happened to Clarke."
VANCOUVER, March 10.â Mr. Clarke says the lady was discharged
by Mr. Broadhurst, author of the play, shortly after the company was or
ganized, but was taken back out of compassion. He declares that she
breeded' discord among the company, paying she was getting $50 a
week, when, in fact, she received $20; that he tried to expostulate with
her to no avail, and finally, in the presence of the company, he stated
what her salary really was, and then she fainted. He holds and
showed her receipts in full for salary and fare to San Francisco.
NO ACTION ON
THE TREATY
Hawaiian Question Put
Off for Another
Week.
Senate in No Hurry to Take
Up the Already Dead
Issue.
South Dakotan Loses a Postoffice
Because He Attacked Mr.
Pettigrew.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 10.â The Sen
ate to-day in executive session reject
ed the nomination of Henry S. Williams
to be postmaster at Aberdeen, S. D.
Williams was opposed by friends of
Senator Pettigrew, on the ground that
j he made a personal attack in a paper
i of which he was owner on the Senator,
i and refused to explain or retract. Sen
| ator Kyle supported the nomination,
saying Mr. Williams' partner was re
sponsible for the attack. Senator Gear
also made a brief speech in his support.
i Speeches on the other side were made
by Senators Pettigrew, Chandler and
others. The vote in opposition to con-
I flrmation was almost unanimous.
Senator Cannon read the newspaper
attack upon Senator Pettigrew, and the
latter stated that he would not ask the
Senate to reject the nomination if he
did not feel that if the attack was
made on any ether Senator, no matter
what his personal relations to him
were, he would feel impelled to sustain
him. Affidavits were read to the ef
fect that Williams had refused to re
tract the article because, he said, he
wanted the postofflce. After this a
number of speeches were made, all
against confirmation, some of the
speakers being Senators Davis, Teller,
Allison and Cannon.
At this juncture Senator Davis made
an effort to have the Hawaiian treaty
considered, but Senator Bacon, who
had been expected to speak, asked for
further time. He said that his thoughts
had recently been directed in entirely
different channels, and that he felt that
he was entitled to some days for prep
aration. No other Senator appearing
prepared to go on, Senator Davis con
sented that the matter should be post
poned until next week, which was done.
Other nominations were then taken
up, including some of those of non-resi
dents who were opposed on the ground
that they violated the home rule prin-
ciple.
There was a roll call upon the nomi
nation of Charles Dekays of Texas to
be agent at the Fort Apache agency in
Arizona, which resulted in a vote of 17
for and 23 against. The result of this
vote developed the want of a quorum,
and the roll was called to secure the
necessary number. These appearing, a
viva voce vote was taken, which also
resulted against Dekays.
In the same way J. J. Power of Penn
sylvania was defeated for receiver of
public moneys at Perry, O. T.
Senator Hanna suggested that the
matter should go over until - another
day, and a motion was made to con
sider the votes of rejection, which was
pending when the Senate adjo-urned.
There are several other non-resident
nominations, and it was intimated after
the adjournment that there might be
an effort to have them withdrawn.

missed by the Bulgarian

A REMARKABLE ADDRESS
Decision in the Maximum Freight
Rate Case Most Bitterly
Denounced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOPEKA, March 10.â The Populist
administration of the State of Kansas
save out a startling public address to
day, one bristling with severe criti
cism of the recent decision df the
United States Supreme Court in the
Nebraska maximum freight rate caKe.
The address is particularly significant
in that Governor Leedy has already
taken steps preliminary to the calling
of the State Legislature in special ses
sion with the especial purpose of en
acting a maximum freight rate law.
While the address is given out over
the signature of Governor Leedy, it
had first been approved by Chief Jus
tice Doster of the Supreme Court and
other prominent Populists. In giving
the address to the reporters Governor
Leedy said:
"How long do you suppose a man can
write treason like .this without getting
into Jail? You may put my signature
to it and make it a signed statement,
so that if anybody goes to jail it will
be me."
The Governor begins his address
with the statement that for a year the
press dispatches have said that the
opinion in the Nebraska case would be
adverse to the State. Then he says:
"The opinion has been handed down,
and the press dispatches say that it is
a clean victory for the railroad. On the
contrary, it is an unclean victory in
every aspect of the case, showing that,
no matter how carefully the robes of
Justice are folded about the personnel
of the Supreme Court, the robes can no
longer conceal the cloven hoof of offi
cial malfeasance and usurpation. As
this decision was dv? a year ago, and
as there was no known reason for the
delay, and as the dt; ision as rendered
confirms the stau-i. nt* made in the
press dispatches frorib time to time,
strong color te given to the suspicion
that the press dispatches emanated
from some person in touch with the
court and were for the purpose of feel
ing the pulse "f the public and prepar
ing it for the decision, which goes much
further in the direction of usurping
power than any that has yet bet-n
made."
The Governor then declares that the
constitution of Nebraska gives the Leg
islature power to establish maximum
charges for transportation and declares
that the Supreme Court has tried to
abrogate it. He challenges Justice Har
lan's declaration that a corporation is
a person under the fourteenth amend
ment to the Federal constitution and
says:
"I deny it, and so will everybody but
a corporation lawyer or a- subservient
Judicial tool of corporate interests."
Governor Leedy then quotes the four
teenth amendment and says:
"How In the name of God can this
apply to corporations? Corporations
are not born; they are created â made
by law. They cannot be naturalized;
they can take no oath of allegiance.
Only human beings born elsewhere can
do that."
After more in the same strain the
Governor, still referring to the four
teenth amendment, says:
"Who are the persons who shall not,
according t' the provisions, be de
prived of lite, liberty or property, nor
be denied equal legal protection?
Everybody outside the asylum and off
the Federal judicial bench knows them
to be â and to only be â natural persons.
They are those who, besides the capa
city to hold property and enjoy legal
protection, also have life and can enjoy
liberty, and that means human be-
ings."
Continuing, the Governor quotes
"Hare on American Constitutional
Law" and a decision by Justice "Woods
of the United States Circuit Court, aft
erward a Supreme Court Justice, to
prove that the fourteenth amendment
does not refer to corporations, and de
clares that the Woods decision had
been followed in Rhode Island and
other States from 1870 to 1882, "when
Justice Field and another 'Federal Jus
tice of the Peace' named Sawyer decid
ed the other way, and since then,
whenever a corporation starts out to
commit highway robbery, pick a man's
pocket, or loot a public treasury, it dis
guises itself as a 'person' and goes out
on its mission of plunder. Nobody but
a slave or a knave will yield assent to
the hideous distortion of meaning
which Judge Harlan gives to the word
'person,' as used in the fourteenth
amendment, and upon which he bot
toms his infamous decision, and which
shows to what depths of iniquity the
Supreme Court of the United States
has descended."
"I desire," the Governor said, "to
quote some of the decisions of the Su
preme Court of the United States be
fore it went into partnership with Mor
gan, Vanderbilt, Gould & Co., in op
position to the opinion It holds In the
Nebraska case."
Long decisions by Justice John Mar
shall In 1830 are quoted.
In conclusion Governor Leedy states
that his maximum rate bill will be
presented to the Kansas Legislature in
such shape that to decide against it
the court must reverse its decision in
the Nebraska case, and he states that
"if the court still pursues the corrupt
and rotten practice that it has hereto
fore by changing its decisions to suit
the shifting interests of the railroad
corporations" the remedy will be with
the people in their dealings with the
courts or in building railroads of their
own.

PETER SHERIDAN
SEEKS ALIMONY
FROM HIS WIFE
An Aged Resident of Stockton
Who Failed to Beware of
the Widows.
STOCKTON, March 10.â Peter Sheridan began an action to-day in
the Superior Court against Ellen Sheridan, his wife, for separate main
tenance and a monthly allowance of $50. Plaintiff is 75 years of age,
and asserts that he is weak and unable to support himself. He was
married to the defendant in the expiring month of IS9O. On the 6th
inst., as he alleges, his spouse made a cruel and inhuman assault upon
him while he was seated in a chair. She grabbed him by the hair with
force and violence, and struck and beat his face and head, producing
bruises from which he suffered great anguish. She also drove him
out upon the street, and applied threats and epithets to him.
Plaintiff is now living apart from his wife, and contends that this
separate existence is not desertion, but the natural result of the cruel
treatment aforesaid. Defendant is alleged to have separate property
valued at $9000, while the plaintiff has no separate property, and noth
ing except equity rights in a quarter section of land. There is no
community property whatsoever. â¢
Sheridan alleges that he has been injured by Mrs. Ellen Sheridan;
that he is too feeble to provide for his own support, and has nothing on
which to maintain himself; that Ellen Sheridan has property with
which to support him, and he therefore asks the court to intervene
and make him an allowance of $50 a month out of her property.
Mrs. Sheridan was a widow (Ellen Ryne) when Sheridan married
her. Shortly after they were wed, It is claimed, the wife got the hus
band to deed over to her all his property, consisting of a big ranch near
the "Brick Church," between Lockeford and Lodi. The provision of the
agreement was that she should pay a relative, McClellan, and his wife
and three children $500 each. After that she repudiated theagreement,
and a year ago the old man commenced suit to have the deed set aside,
and that case is yet in court. Ellen Sheridan also commenced action
to clear the property of any claim of the McClellans, so that she might
be able to sell it.
BANDIT CLOUGH
IS A PRISONER
Found on a Cot in the
Fresno County ,
Hospital.
Suffering From a Wound Ac
cidentally Inflicted by
Cliff Regan.
Taken to Merced to Answer to Grand
Larceny and Robbery
Charges.
Special Dispatch to The Call-.
FRESNO, March 10.â J. B. Clough, a
partner of Cliff Ragan, the notorious
outlaw, was arrested at the County
Hospital by Deputy Sheriff L. P. Tim
mins this afternoon at about 1 o'clock.
Clough is wanted in Merced County for
grand larceny and robbery. In com
pany with Cliff Ragan he "committed
several crimes in that county. Deputy
Sheriff Dickinson of Snelling came to
Fresno to identify Clough and returned
to Merced with the prisoner this after
noon.
Last fall Clough and Ragan stole a
horse and Winchester rifle from a man
at Snelling. They also attempted to
rob three Chinamen. Clough was ad
mitted to the Fresno County Hospital
in December. He had a severe wound
in the thigh, and claimed that his pistol
had been accidentally discharged.
Deputy Sheriff Dickinson says that
Clough was wounded by the accidental
discharge of Cliff Ragan's pistol while
the two were attempting to rob the
three Chinamen last December. The
Chinamen resisted the outlaws, and
Ragan's weapon was discharged dur
ing the scuffle. The wounded man was
followed for several days by the offi
cers, but evaded them and came down
into Fresno County.
Ragan and Clough are accused of
having held up a stage in Placer Coun
ty last fall and murdered the driver.
A reward of several hundred dollars is
offered for Ragan's arrest, as he was
the principal in the affair.
Cliff Ragan is well known in this
county, as he was sent to prison from
here several years ago for grand lar
ceny. He was in prison for a short
term, and upon obtaining his liberty
returned to this valley. Since then Ra
gan has lived the life of an outlaw.
Since summer he was seen several
times in the foothills of Madera, Marl
posa, Tuolumne and Placer counties.
FIGHTING OVER
A DRAWBRIDGE
Vigorous Protest Entered at a
Meeting of the Sonoma
Supervisors.
Stony Point Capitalist Complains of
the Encroachments of the
Tubbs Heirs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, March 10.â Harrison
Meacham, the Stony Point capitalist, ap
peared before the Board of Supervisors
here to-day and filed a vehement protest
against the heirs of the late J. C. Tubbs
being allowed to erect a drawbridge over
Midshipman's Slouch across from Tubbs
Island, below Petaluma.
The case involved is a peculiar one.
The law provides that permission must
be given by the Supervisors, in conform
ity with the bi.a.te law, before a bridge or
ot-Â»er obstruction can be erected on a
navigable stream, but the heirs of the
late Millionaire Tubbs of San Francisco
did not wait for the permission before
going ahea~ with the work, but erected
the bridge first and asked for permission
afterward.
Owing to the prominence of the parties
involved the case has created consider
able interest throughout the county. Jus
tice Henshaw of the Supreme Court is
attorney for the Tubbs estate, one ot the
richest in the county.
Harrison Meacham. who objects to the
bridge being erected, is one of the
wealthiest men in ti.e county, and he
claims that the bridge occupies a site he
intended using for a landing. He claims
that the land on his side from which the
bridge projects w:.s about to be sold to a
rich brick manufacturing company or San
Francisco, and that without the landing
place the ground will be useless for their
purpose.
Legally the bridge does not exist, but
it Is there nevertheless, and promises to
make somebody no end of trouble before
the affair is ended.
BOUNDARY OF
ALASKA FIXED
England and the United
States Settle Their
Dispute.
British Government Concedes
the Claim Made by
America.
Lino of Demarcation Fixed at Three
Marine Leagues From
the Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 11.â A dispatch
to the Press from Ottawa says: Sir
Julian Pauncefote, the British ambas
sador, has informed the Canadian
Ministry officially that he has arranged
a convention with the United States
whereby the Alaska boundary dispute
has been settled.
Under the terms of the convention
the British Government has conceded
the claim of the United States that the
three marine leagues should be meas
ured from the shore of the mainland
and should proceed along the shores of
the inlets, which are thus recognized
as arms of the oceans and not as rivers.
The contention of the British and of
the Canadian governments was that
the three-league limit should begin on
the ocean side of the Island, and that
the delimiting line should be run across
the inlets and not follow the shores.
These inlets are numerous and ex
tend into the mainland a great dis
tance, and the decision, therefore, is of
much Importance to the United States.
The United States has agreed to the
British retaining the boundary on the
limit of the Chilcoot Pass and the
White Pass, because in the Russian-
British agreement of 1825 the line of
demarcation was fixed as one running
along the tops of the mountains.
The decision, while not entirely un
expected by the Cabinet, is regarded
with disfavor. It is understood that
the British Government was irritated
at the forwardness of the Canadian
Ministry, but it was not thought that
the surrender would be so sweeping as
it is.
WHITELAW A TOTAL WRECK.
SEATTLE, March 10.â The steamer
Victorian arrived this afternoon from
Skaguay. Her officers report that the
steamship Whitelaw is a total wreck,
a second blaze burning her to the wa
ter's edge. Captain Patterson thus
speaks of the catastrophe:
"The old San Francisco wrecking
steamer Whitelaw lies on the beach
near Skaguay, burned to the water's j
edge. Decks, upper works and every- |
thing went up in flames. The wreck |
appeared to be complete, and I don't j
believe anything can be done with the
small portion .unburned below water. 1
The fire broke out in the forward hold |
Friday morning last, and after getting [
his passengers ashcre Captain Dollard 1
beached his boat. The big pumps with j
which she is provided began to pour
streams of water into the hold, and at
the time the Humboldt left it looked as
if the fire was under control, and that j
nothing but the cargo would be lost.
"The wind which was blowing in
creased into a gale, and the flames re
fused to down. They gained rapidly, |
and soon reached the engines and I
stopped the pumps. Her officers and
crew were finally compelled to leave j
her, and all got off safely. Consider
able of the personal effects of the sixty
passengers and the crew were saved.
The rest of the cargo went up with the
ship. We passed quite near her charred
hulk on the way out of the harbor, and
very little appeared to be left of it."
FROM MXJNOOK CREEK.
SEATTLE, March 10.â The first news,
somewhat meager but authentic, has been
received from Munook Creek, an American
tributary of the Yukon. " It comes in a
letter dated November 28, written by Gen
eral E. M. Carr to his brother in Daw
son, and by the latter forwarded to Mrs.
Carr In Seattle. The letter was brought
from Munook to Circle City by "Windy
Jim" Dobson. At the time of writing hfs
letter General Carr states that Munook
Hoosler and Hunter creeks were promis
ing well, and that he expected his inter
ests in claims on those streams would net
handsome returns. He adds that Little
Munook Is turning out rich, and that
several very heavy nuggets had been
found there. The health of the several
hundred prospectors in his vicinity is re
ported good. The general further states
that Dobson will attempt to make one
more round trip to Circle City during the
winter and that he will then send out
additional news.

CHICO, Cal.. March 10.â Shortly be.
fo-re 7 o'clock this morning a messen
ger came hurriedly into town with news
that a tragedy had occurred on the
Bidwell ranch, two miles from this city.
Marshal Mansfield, Constables Woods
and Chubbuck and Deputy Peck, to
gether with several others, hurried to
the scene. Before they had reached the
ranch, however, they met Hale and
Waltz, proprietors of the sheep ranch
and employers of the two principals,
bringing with them William Davidson,
alias Williamson, who had shot and in
stantly killed William McGinley, his
working companion.
Davidson and McGinley had spent the
night in Chico drinking, and had unly
returned in time for breakfast, after
which both men went to their cabin, a
short distance from the main house.
They had barely entered the cabin be
fore three shots were heard. Waltz,
Hale and their foreman hurried to the
cabin, at the door of which they saw
Davidson standing over the body of Mc-
Ginley, -teloading a pistol. Davidson
ordered the men away, saying he
would shoot the first one wha ap
proached. Hale went to the house for
a rifle, but before he returned David
son came out from the cabin and sur
rendered.
On entering the cabin McGinley was
found With two bullet holes through
him, one through his head, the other
through his stomach. In his hand was
clasped a large-sized pocket knife.
Davidson claims that his victim as
saulted him, and he shot in ?elf-defense.
It is believed, however, that the knif^
was placed in the dead man's hand
after he was shot by Davidson.
McGinley was well known in this sec
tion as a peaceable man, whlle^Daridj
son has been regarded as a tough char
acter. It was only a few weeks ago
that Davidson engaged in a saloon row
and bit a piece out of his adversary's
lip. He has always carried a gun. and
when drunk is ready to use it. Feeling
here is very much against him.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC

now get them through the Senate. Mr.
Stout, author of the bill, was consulted
to-day before this decision was made.
He conferred with the attorneys for the
Southern Pacific Company, and they
agreed to pay the franchise tax assess

AND WRECKS
IN A STORM
Vessels Driven Ashore, a
Schooner Capsized and
One Steamer Foun=
dered.
The Bark Martha Davis and the Coast
Survey Steamer Patterson Badly
Damagedâ Fishing Smacks
Wrecked.
The storm on the water front, an ac
count of which was given exclusively
In yesterday's Call, did even more dam
age than was first reported. There was
hardly a section of the front from the
Fulton Iron Works to Hunters Foint
' ::>dock but showed some traces of the
" ury of the storm. Fishing boats were
smashed int.) kindling wood, scow
schooners were dismasted, capsized and
driven ashore; schooners, barkentines
and ships drifted all over the bay; iron
wssels were considerably damaged
--side the wharves; the revenue
cutter Rush and the coast survey
" ler Patterson were in collision
with other vessels; wharves were badly
damaged, and all in all there was a
very lively time of it for about five
hours along the front early yesterday
morning.
The storm began coming up about
midnight, but the barometer gave
warning Wednesday afternoon. Some
of the deep water captains prepared
for a blow by getting out extra moor
ing lines and making everything snug,
but others did not heed the warning,
ami in consequence their vessels suf
f< red.
The collision which caused the most
excitement was that of the bark Mar
tha Davis and the coast survey steam
er Patterson. The bark arrived from
Honolulu "Wednesday afternoon, and
anchored off Folsom-street wharf,
about two ships' lengths from the Pat
terson. -About the latter vessel there
were conflicting reports, some of the
tug captains asserting that none of the
officers were on board of her, while
Captain Soule of the Martha Davis says
he asked one of The men on the deck
of the Patterson if he was the captain
of the vessel, and the man answered
"yes." Whichever story is correct
makes very little difference because one
thing is certain, that is that the man
who did all the ordering on the survey
boat was one of the sailors. ;?,â  j^.
Early in the blow the Patterson be
gan to drag her anchor. ' First the
strong ebb tide would drive her in one
Sfrection and then .the wind would take
f.ntrol and drive her back again. Fi
ally she crashed into the bark.and the
yards of; both vessels became locked.
' Then both crafts dragged their anchors
and the trouble began.
The Martha Davis' jibboom went
, first and her bowsprit followed. Then
her lower maintopsail yard. : The Pat
terson lost her jibboom, her foretop
mast and foretopgallant mast. Cap
tain Soule told the' men on the survey
boat to send up some sky rockets, but
they said they had none, so half a
dozen were taken out of the bark's
locker and passed over to them. The
first one fired was seen by Captain
Brokaw of the tug Reliance, and he at
once started for the scene. When the
second one was fired he was well out
of the slip, and . when the fourth one
was sent off he was just getting along
side of the entangled vessels.
' In the meantime Captain Marshall of
the tug Active had seen the signals and
ho also went to the scene. Captain
Brokaw took command of the situation
and the .two tugs were soon fastened
to the disabled vessels. . As the survey
bfat had steam on her boilers she was
told to heave away on her anchor,. but
whoever was in charge said the engine
was disabled and they could not help
themselves. Steam was then got on
the donkey boiler of (he Martha Davis
and her anchor was hove up. It then
took the two tugs over two hours to get
the vessels apart, and that done the
Reliance at once started for the mud
flats, as Captain Soule reported, that
she was -leaking. The Patterson had
cut her alpoost to the water's edge, and
fifteen of. sixteen new planks will have
to be put in before she can go. to sea

>|\Vhennear the Union Iron Works it
ivas found, that the bark was: making
very little water, so the anchor was
dropped and nothing will be done with
her until a survey, has been held. < U
Down- at the Presidio the breakers
rolled in almost as heavily as they- did
at Ocean Beach. -The schooner. Sacra
mento went ashore, but was not very
much damaged. When the gale subsid-
Ed the tug Sea Queen went to her as
sistance and towed her off. At the
Fulton Iron Works the steamer Dirigo.
which was being made ready for the
Klondike trade, was considerably dam
aged, and she will not get away from
here before the 20th inst. The steamer
Fulton, which is also being fitted out
at the iron works, dragged her anchor
and ranged up alongside of the Dirigo.
The Fulton is the smaller vessel of the
two, and when she rose on the crest of
the first wave that came along she got
under the guard of the Dirigo and car
ried it away for the entire length of the
ship.

THE WORST COLLISION OF THE STORM.
The Coast Survey steamer Patterson drifted down on the sugar-laden bark Martha Davis and nearly cut her in two. Signal rockets were
fired and the tugs Reliance and Active were soon on the scene. After two hours' hard work the tugs succeeded in separating the
vessels, but not until the Martha Divis had lost her bowsprit and some of her yards, while the Coast Survey boat lost her fore
topgallant mast and jibboom and some of her railing.
law's wrecking scow Catalina was
driven hard and fast on the beach. She
did not sustain much damage, and will
probably be towed off at high tide to
day. The schooner yacht Josie also
went ashore near to the Catalina, but
was kedged off at high water. The
sloop Carl went on the rocks, and it will
take a great deal of time and patience
to get her back into the water again.
A man known as "Liverpool Teddy"
was sleeping aboard the sloop, and the
first intimation he had of danger was
when the boat began to bump. He im
mediately got into a skiff and pulled
ashore, leaving the sloop to her fate.
The ship Columbia dragged her anchor,
and as the tide fell she settled on the
beach, but was not damaged to any ex
tent, and was towed off at high water.
Off Meiggs wharf the barkentine Ad
denda, which arrived Wednesday after
noon and anchored there, picked up her
mud hook and ran amuck. She first
of all drifted down upon the pilot boat
Lady Mine. The barkentine escaped
with a fe%v scratches, but the pilot boat
lost nearly all of her starboard rail
ing, and in order to escape from her
dangerous neighbor had to slip her ca
ble, losing an anchor and sixty fathoms
of chain.
Next the Addenda drifted down upon
the revenue cutter Rush. The latter's
Jibboom escaped by a miracle and then
the barkentine ranged up alongside and
carried away th revenue cutter's
gangway and damaged one of her
boats. The Rush got under way and
escaped from the barkentine, while the
latter only brought up when less than
fifty yards from the rocks at the end
of the seawall. Yesterday morning the
tug Reliance went to her assistance
and towed her to a safe anchorage.
In order to get away from the Ad
denda Captain Alex Swahson had to
anchor the Lady Mine in a very ex
posed position. After the Addenda was
moved out of the way he got sail on
the pilot boat and after some skillful
maneuvering he got the Lady Mine out
into the open water and then sailed her
back to her old anchorage off Meiggs
wharf.
At section A of the seawall the scow
schooner Dora was tied up. When it
began blowing hard the captain tried
to get her away from the wharf, but
failed. She had all her railing carried
THE SAX FR AX CISCO CALL, FEIDAY, MARCH 11, 1898.
away, her standing rigging ruined and
her main boom smashed. She was
towed to the Mission flats by the
tug Annie. At the same section of the
seawall the schooner Edward Parke
lost sixty feet of railing and bulwarks
on the port side. She got partly under
the wharf and each swell that came in
did more or less damage to her. She
was leaking badly when the tug Sea
Witch took hold of her and towed her
to Mission Creek.
At section B the schooner Gotama
had her starboard side badly chafed,
her starboard rigging carried away and
one of her boats smashed. She was
towed clear by the tug Ida W.
At section 3 of the seawall the
schooner Amethyst came to grief. She
got in late Wednesday night, and an
chored away up the bay. The men had
had a hard time of it on the trip down
the coast, and as soon as the anchor
was down they at once turned in and
went to sleep. When the wind was at
its height the schooner began to drag,
and drifted rapidly in the direction of
the H. C. Wright. The captain of the
latter and his men were on deck get
ting fenders out to prevent the vessel
from chafing against the seawall, and
when he saw the Amethyst earning he
guessed what was the matter, and sent
a man in the boat to wake up the crew.
The warning was in time to save the
Amethyst from crashing into the
Wright, but not in time to prevent her
from banging up against the seawall,
where she broke her main boom and
had her starboard side badly chewed
up. She was taken in tow by the tug
Active and tied up alongside Fremont
street wharf.
At section 4 of the spawall the schoon
er Helen Gunderson, loaded with brick,
was lying alongside of the bark R. P.
Rithet when the gale came down; the
schooner's lines parted, and she drifted
down on Fishermen's wharf. Her star
board bulwarks and railing were carried
away, and when the storm was at its
height she capsized and went down.
All of yesterday a crowd of curious
people was on Fishermen's wharf gaz
ing at ttte submerged vessel.
Great damage was done to the fishing
fleet. Not a single boat escaped, and
six of them were smashed into kindling
wood. Pome of them were so badly
damaged that they will probably never
go outside the heads again, and nearly
all the others will require more or less
repairing. In every dock from Fisher
men's wharf to Fremont-street wharf
there were more or less fishing craft
which had sought shelter in the south
i crn portions of the water front.
Both Fishermen's wharf and Lom
bard-street wharf suffered from the
; storm, and will require considerable re
pairing.
The British ships Dunnerdale and
; Cambuekenneth, at Union street wharf.
and the American ship Eclipse, at
Green street wharf, suffered considera
bly during the storm. The Dunr.er
dale had two of the plates on her port
side badly dented, her hawse pipe was
pulled out, a hundred and twenty feet
of her railing was carried away and
at one time she lay over on the wharf
to such an extent that the crew thought
she was going to capsize and deserted
her in a body. The rest of the night
the men spent >n the British ship Hut
ton Hall. The Dunnerdale is badly
strained and will have to go on the
dry dock for repairs. She had been
taking on a general cargo for Europe,
but during the storm everything broke
loose and yesterday morning it was
hard to tell one item in the consign
ments from another. Everything was
mixed up, cases were broken open,
grain scattered over the lower hold and
everything will have to be taken out of
her again.
On the south side of the wharf the
Cambuskenneth caught it. The prin
cipal thing her crew had to do was to
keep her from going adrift and crash
ing into the ship Eclipse on the other
side of the dock. ' During the night
three of her cables snapped one after
the other, she pulled two mooring piles
out of the wharf, snapped three moor
ing bits like pipestems and was only
kept in her place by passing the an
chor chains across the wharf. At preen
street wharf the Eclipse had her fore
and main channels and her mooring
bits torn out and was also badly chafed
by contact with the wall.
The British ship Tamax was lying at
anchor off Vallejo street wharf, ready
to go to sea. She dragged her anchor
and drifted down below Jackson street
wharf. She was very cfose in shore
and was making direct for the Govern
ment steamer McDowell. Captain Stof
fin of the steamer saw her coming and
had steam up and everything ready to
get out of her way, when the Tamar'*
anchors held.
The bark Willie R. Hume made the
star drift of the night. She was an
chored off Powell street, but the storm
took command of her and carried her
through all the shipping in the north
ern portion of the bay, passed the ferry
slips, ran her close to the battle-ship
Oregon, and finally landed her in a safe
anchorage under the lee of the Mail
dock. The vessel was not damaged in
the slightest, and the crew slept the
sleep of the just throughout the whole
proceeding. No one was more sur
prised than the mate and his men when
they awoke in the morning and found
where their ship was.
At Vallejo street wharf the brig Lur
line was considerably damaged and her
yards tore away a portion of the shed
before the tug Sea King could get her
away from her dangerous position and
out into the stream.
At Broadway wharf the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's Eureka sank in
her berth. She was put on the retired
list" some time ago, but when the rush
to Klondike began the company
thought of putting her into commission
again. Some planks were taken out of
her sides just above the copper in order
to examine the timbers, and they were
not put back again, as the examination
had not been completed, owing to the
rush to get the Valencia and Cottage
City ready for sea. When the storm
came down and the sea rose every
wave sent more or less water into the
vessel's hold. She sank lower and
lower and finally went down alto
gether. An attempt was made to get
her out of the dock, but it was too late,
and in order to raise her divers will
have to be put to work.
At Washington street wharf the stern
wheel steamer Alviso lost her star
board railing and her smokestack went
by the board. At Howard street wharf
the scow schooner Tartar had her
masts carried away at the deck and
also lost her bowsprit, while the
schooner Fortuna had her bulwarks
and rail carried away, her bowsprit
knocked off and sustained considerable
other damage. The British ship Ec
clefechan tore a dolphin out ofFremont
street wharf, and the schooner Prosper
went ashore near the Union Iron
Works. Neither vessel sustained any
damage.
The Stockton river steamer Mary
Garratt got the full force of the storm
before she reached Mare Island; in
consequence her captain tied her up at
South Vallejo and she did not reach
San Francisco until noon yesterday. A
fleet of the drifting vessels got down
south of the Mail dock and completely
blocked up the slip of the freight
steamer Transit, and in consequence
that vessel did not make any trip yes
terday morning.
Chief Wharfinger Root and Assistant
Wharfinger Scott were on the water
front from 1 a. m. to 4 p. m. yesterday.
They had not a moment's rest during
the entire sixteen hours and it was due
to their energy and levelheadedness
that things were straightened out as
quickly as they were along the front.
Old timers on the beach say that noth
ing to equal yesterday morning's
norther has happened in the harbor
since the big blow of five years ago.
The vessels lying south of Mission
Channel suffered no damage from the
storm. The wind being north that por
tion of the shipping district was pro
tected.
The steamer Zealandia of the Spreck
els line was lying along side of the
sugar refinery wharf, discharging her
cargo of sugar from Honolulu. In her
position she was exposed to the full
force of the storm and she rocked and
rolled against the wharf until First
Officer Deering, who was in charge at
the time, got his crew on deck and kept
the vessel from striking the piles.
It took Stanton and Henry G. Clancy,
the combined weight of both being 500
pounds, on the weather veranda to
keep the building from being blown
away. The effort proved a success and
the city is a gainer thereby.
The Wind Storm in Berkeley.
BERKELEY, March 10.â The heavy
wind storm that stirred things up
around the bay last night did consid-
erable damage in Berkeley. A barn on
University avenue, near San Pablo ave
nue, belonging to George Schmidt, was
leveled to the ground. The upper half
of a big smokestack on Cavan & Day's
planing mill was blown down, and
trees, fences and signs all over the
town suffered.
SEAMEN'S WAGES.
*~ Decision of Wide Importance on
That Subject by the Court of
Appeals.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals for the Ninth Circuit has just ren
dered an opinion that is of great interest
to seamen and owners of vessels. In the case
of William Grossett vs. H. C. Townsend,
the court holds in cases of shipment of
seamen before a United States Shipping
Commissioner allotments of wages in the
coasting trade and in trade between tne
United States and the Dominion of Can
ada, or Newfoundland, or the West Indies
or Mexico, are illegal and should not be
allowed. In rendering the decision the
court said, among other things:
"In declaring that in shipping before a
shipping commissioner for a coastwise
voyage the agreement shall not include
a stipulation for allotment, we think it
was the intention to deprive the parties
in such a case of the power of contract
ing for allotment. When a law declares
that an allotment may be made only by
written agreement, and subsequently it is
enacted that in certain cases the contract
nf shipment shall not contain that stipu
lation, it seems clear that as to those
cases the latter law was intendeu to take
away the power, conferred by the former.
The conclusion at which we arrive is in
harmony with the purpose of the legisla
tion upon this subject. The statutes pro
hibiting allotment are directed against
evils which have often been allude- to
ir. the decisions of Admiralty courts. The
intention has been to protect the sailor
against imposit.on and fraud. It was evi
dently believed by Congress that for a
coastwise voyage of brief duration tnere
was no necessity for an allotment for the
wife, mother or creditor of the sailor.
That was the construction placed upon
the law by the oulcers of the Treasury
Department at the time when it went
into effect."
A circular calling attention of shipping
commissioners ana others to the decision
has lust been issued by Eugene T. Cham
berlain, Commissioner of Navigation.

A Burglar Pays a Friendly Visit to
the Potrero Section and Gets Away
With His Booty.
Householders as well as the police in
the Potrero district are anxious to make
the personal acquaintance of a festive
burglar who pays afternoon visits to
their houses. This man generally calls at
the people's residences while they are
engaged at dinner, and enters through
the windows and proceeds to the bed
rooms and there helps himself to v .iat
ever jewelry he finds in the rooms. His
last visit was to the residence of M.
Cousner on Railroad avenue, between
Tenth and Eleventh avenues, a few aays
ago. Here he was well repaid, as he got
four valuable watches and a lot of choice
trinkets belonring to the members of the
family. The household was at dinnner at
the time of the burglar's visit. He suc
ceeded in gaining an entrance through a
side window, and without disturbing any
of the family visited every room in the
house, touching nothing but such jewelry
as he could find.

BARELY AVOIDED
The Tug Governor Mark

Oilskins in Her Cargo Stop the
Ship Sin^ram From
Leaving.
Sixty-Eight Sailing Vessels Enter the
Golden Gate in Twenty-
Four Hours.
From some unknown cause the South
End boathouse at the foot of Third
street caught fire yesterday and for
a while it looked as if that region of
the city would suffer from the effects
of a disastrous conflagration, for the
fire was in the midst of many old
wooden structures that would have
burned like tinder. As luck would
have it the Governor Markham lay at
the foot of Market street with steam
up, and a telephone message from the
wharfinger reached her in time for the
tug to arrive at the boathouse and ex
tinguish the blaze even before the Fire
Department had reached the spot. The
roof of the boathouse has been newly
shingled and the fire spread more slow
ly than it would otherwise have done,
else even the tug would not have cov
ered the distance in time to prevent a
damaging blaze.
The ship Sintram did not leave for
Dutch Harbor yesterday as was ex
pected, because her owners had reck
oned without the customs authorities.
The Sintram has been loading barges
and stern- wheel steamers in sections at
Spear street wharf, which were to be
put together at Dutch Harbor for the
Alaska Exploration Company. In the
cargo were a number of oilskins. When
the customs authorities learned of this
they insisted that the vessel should be
unloaded and the oilskins placed where
they could be got at readily in case of
fire, as it is now believed that the
Whitelaw suffered from fire on account
of spontaneous combustion, the blaze
originating among a number of oil
skins. About five hundred tons of the
Sintram's cargo had to be left over on
account of space, and the ship George
Skolfield has been chartered to take the
surplus to Dutch Harbor.
For the twenty-four hours ending at
midnight Wednesday sixty-eight sail
ing vessels entered the Golden Gate,
exclusive of fishing schooners. This
is said to break the record since the
days of '49.
James Ring, a miner from Butte,
Montana, looked too often on the wine
when it was ruby in the cup Wednes
day and fell off Steuart street wharf
into the unsympathetic waters of the
bay. He was picked up by Henry
Peterson, and was taken to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital. During the
night James sobered up sufficiently to
wish himself in a more congenial clime
and departed without saying to those
who had ministered unto him good
by. His room would have suited as
well as his company, were it not for
the fact that he failed to find his own
clothing and appropriated that of an
other. James was promptly arrested
and brought back, to be released yes
terday.
The schooner Winchester arrived
here yesterday, seventeen days from
Sanak, Alaska. On December 16 last
the schooner Mary and Ida was sent
to Sanak with provisions for the Win
chester. The latter reports that when
she sailed the Mary and Ida had not
arrived at Sanak. This news had
caused some excitement, the natural in
ference being that the schooner has
met with some mishap.
The bark Theobald. which was

were in a quandary as to whether to
sell the bark or convert her into a
coal hulk, when the Klondike excite

Named Fred Gummow.
Fred Gummow. a pattern-maker em
ployed in the Union Iron Works, received
serious injuries yesterday afternoon
while at work at the bench in the yard.
Gummow was In the act of turning a
wheel before a lathe when the frame
gave way and permitted a section of the
wheel to escape, l'his struck Gummow
on the right temple and knocked him
down rendering him unconscious. Dr.
de Witt was summoned and did what he
could for his suffering's. Lieutenant of
Police Bennett placed the Potrero patrol
wagon at the service of the injured man
and had him conveyed to his residence at
315 Walnut street.
From fellow-workmen in the yard It
was said the blame was owing to Gum

THE MEN WHO

General Demand for the
Reorganization of the
Infantry.
Long Range Rapid-Fire Guns
Suggest a Change in Line
of Battle.
Work on the Fortifications â ThÂ«
Norther Blew Down Trees at
the Presidio.
Officers of the army stationed at the
Presidio now express the hope that
Congress will at once take up the sub
ject of infantry reorganization. The
infantry consists of twenty-flve regi
ments, each composed on a war foot
ing of ten companies of 100 men and
each regiment is organized as one bat
talion. On a peace footing two com
panies of each regiment have been
skeletonized, making the regiment con
sist of eight companies of thirty-five
officers and 525 men organized as one
battalion.
There is an earnest demand in the
army for the establishment of the three
battalion plan. This was recommend
ed by Generals Grant and Sherman,
and is now recommended by General
Miles. Under modern conditions con
forming to the use of long range, mag
azine ritles, the battle unit is the com
pany, and the company should consist
of 200 men. Four companies should
compose a battalion and three battal
ions should make the regiment of 2400
men. The leading argument in sup
port of the three battalion plan is the
economy of officers, for it only requires
one regimental staff for every 2400 men
as organized in one regiment, as
against three regimental staffs for thu
same number of men organized as three
regiments.
In a recent speech delivered in the
House of Representatives Mr. McClel
lan of New York remarked that our
present infantry organization had been
taken from that of Wellington in the
Peninsula, and Wellington's was taken
from Oliver Cromwell's new model. Tho
organization was excellent for the sev
enteenth century, but now at the be
ginning of the twentieth century is out
of date.
The President, with $50,000,000 at his
disposal for the national defense, can
not change the system of organization.
Congress alone can provide for the new
organization, and since the modern for
mation has been adopted by the leading
nations of Europe and recommended
by veteran army officers of the United
States it is now urged that Congress
in taking steps for the national de
fense should not neglect this most im
portant duty.
Commendable progress is noted in
the work of fortifying the harbor of
San Francisco. Some inconvenience
is caused by the distance from the Pre
sidio barracks to the line of works near
Fort Point. In daily drilis the troops
must go out to the guns and return to
the barracks twice a day. Money may
be available now to provide artillery
quarters at some point near the forts
commanding the harbor.
The norther which swept across the
bay and peninsula early yesterday
morning caused a little damage at the
Presidio. The trees were prostrated,
but as the forest of the reservation is
already too dense the loss of the trees
is not regretted. In fact there has been
a good deal of talk about asking per
mission from the authorities to thin
out the groves.
Colonel E. B. Williston is packing his
traps preparatory to his departure for
New York. It is his intention now to
leave for the East to-morrow evening.
The squadron of the Fourth United
States Cavalry stationed at the Pre
sidio, under the command of Lieuten
ant Colonel Louis T. Morris, is ready
to "mobilize" at Atlanta or any other
convenient place. As the chances of
war diminish the chances for another
tour of duty in the Sierra increase.

LEASING PUBLIC UTILITIES.
A MORNING contemporary expresses the hope
that if the Freeholders retain in their charter
the provision already adopted relating to the
acquisition of "public utilities" by the people they
will consider the propriety of amending it so that in
case the people rind it unprofitable to manage thei-
"utilities." afterward they may lease them. Concern
ing the abstract sense of this hope it is unnecessary
to speak. Ordinarily a business man who owns
property which he cannot make profitable esteems
the privilege of leasing to some one be'.ter qualified
to handle it than himself as of consMcrabl* value,
and we know of no sound reason why this privilege
would not be valuable if conferred upon the people in
their aggregate capacity.
But the chief objection to making proviron for
leasing the 'public utilities" which are to be acquired
under the proposed charter is that any such arrange
ment will be entirely useless. Is our contemporary
so silly as to believe that the politicians of this city
would ever relinquish the management of a "public
utility"? Did it ever hear of a good thing which
these gentlemen turned over to anybody else?
Doubtless the County Clerk's office, the Street De
partment, or. in fact, any other purely administrative
bureau of the city government, could be managed
for half what it now costs to conduct them were they
leased to an individual or a corporation. What would
the politicians say, however, were our contemporary
to propose in cold blood that these departments
should be leased?
So long as the "public utilities" of this city con
tinue profitable there is little likelihood that the peo
ple will care to purchase them. Elections may be
called for the purpose of acquiring them, but the
propositions submitted will be rejected while divi
dends continue in sight. But if the charter is adopted
the moment the street car lines, the gas and water
plants and the telephone system cease to pay,
a great agitation will be set on foot to sell them to
the people. The people do not always understand,
or try to understand, the schemes of the politicians to
fleece them, and therefore it is not at all improbable
that when this time arrives a "utility" or two will
be packed off upon the municipality.
The fact that it is a poor "utility" indeed which
â will not yield a lot of patronage renders any further
bother about managing it entirely irrelevant. The
leasing of the Philadelphia gas plant, and to which
our contemporary refers, was an unusual occurrence.
Evidently some one stole a march on the politicians
in that case, or perhaps they were asleep. At all
events, the howl of "fraud" which has followed the
action of the Council indicates that an unfair advan
tage was taken of the bosses.
It is always easy to imagine the history of "public
utilities" in the hands of the politicians. The first
thing to be done after one of them is acquired is to
increase salaries all around. Then it is in order to
divide up the work. Two men under the Govern
ment cannot render as much service as one in private
employment. Finally, to get the utility in such a
shape as to constitute it a potent force in elections
is highly desirable. Such a thing as making it pay
never occurs to anybody, for are not the taxpayers
rich and able to have their business conducted as it
should be conducted?
We are of opinion that our contemporary's sugges
tion is out of order. Leasing a public utility in this
citj' would be impossible, and therefore no such pro
vision need be placed in the charter. Our bosses
cannot be fooled as those in Philadelphia have been.
Chicago's â¢ energetic Mayor announces that if the
street railway companies there succeed in electing a
City Council subservient to their interests he will eat
his hat. It is not altogether clear what, beyond the
destruction of the hat, would be accomplished by
this, and yet the spectacle would be worth witnessing
and the occasion ought to be made a gala day. The
prospects that the Mayor will have an opportunity to
adopt the peculiar diet he" suggests are excellent. It
is not known that the Yerkes gang is weaker than it
has been during all the years it has owned the town.
It therefore behooves the Mayor to choose a hat
which will the least interfere with his digestive pro
cesses.
Â«
San Jose has a practical joker who should be iso
lated as rigorously as a case of smallpox. His latest
burst of humor was to pour gasoline in the shoe of a
friend and set it on fire, the foot being in the shoe
at the same time. It is not too much to say that this
form of merriment is reprehensible. When the friend
has recovered he ought to get a new shoe, a
heavy one, and apply it to the jester.
Captain Eulate has vindicated his right to be called
a gentleman. The neat and effective way in which
he kicked from his ship a Spaniard whom he had
heard insult the United States commends him to fa
vor. Spain with more Eulates and fewer Weylers
would escape the trying experience of being always
in hot water and the danger of being blown even out
of that.
The Redlands Citrograph says a graceful word of
praise for the Mission zoo, thus living up to the
kindly rule of saying naught but good of the dead.
THE FfIKED RfMPOLLA INTERVIEW.
THE public docs not always discriminate be
tween what a daily paper may publish as news
and what it manufactures out of whole cloth.
A morning paper, connected by wire with every con
siderable city on the planet, as it is, is warranted in
publishing what the world has talked about, the
talking about it making it news, in the twenty-four
hours that pass between each issue. All events
talked about by the people of every nation may not
turn out to have been true, but they are al
ways matters of public interest because they
were talked about. The fact that they were
passed from mouth to mouth is true, and
the press has, in a majority of instances, no time nor
opportunity to trace the talk to its source and verify
it. These conditions are always present in a time of
high excitement and potent passion like the blowing
up of the warship Maine. The press gathered from
the talk of men what they were saying about it. The
intensity and interest of what they said was in pro
portion to their nearness to the scene, and the reader
is expected to appreciate this and discount it to the
percentage justified by his own coolness of judg
ment.
But all these conditions disappear as we approach
the newspaper interview. An interview is the result
of deliberation. The paper desires an interview with
an individual upon a subject of passing or of perma
nent interest. It sends its representative to seek the
interview. It is to be published, to influence opinion
and thought in proportion to the importance and po
sition of the person interviewed. The paper's share
in the transaction is what it gains by its enterprise
in inducing the person interviewed to enlarge his
opinions in its columns.
The readers do not always, however, discriminate
between the kinds of responsibility assumed by the
paper in publishing what people are saying publicly
and generally about events and what an individual
says in a deliberately sought interview. This failure
to discriminate has promoted the vice of the faked or
false interview which has become a specialty in
Hearst's two papers, the New York Journal and the
Examiner.
He procured the forging of the letter from Mme.
Dreyfus and of many other faked and forged per
sonal communications. His latest performance was
the faking of an interview with Rampolla, the Papal
Secretary of State at Rome, on Spanish and Ameri
can affairs. This interview was printed with the
usual froth and flourish of yellow journalism and
boasts of enterprise in getting what amounted to an
expression of the Pope's personal views upon an in
ternational question of the highest interest. It was
accepted by the few who believe in Hearst as a stroke
of stupendous enterprise.
But now. ten days later, comes Rampolla, in a let
ter to Prime Minister Sagasta at Madrid, denying
that such interview was ever given or sought, de
nying that Hearst's representative ever entered the
Vatican on such an errand and denouncing the in
terview as a lie from end to end.
To a person of any sensibility, with a fraction of
the qualities that make up a gentleman, such an ex
posure in the arts of a liar and sneak would be a
blow followed by excuse, confession and apology.
Not so with Hearst. He is proud to have been
proved a liar by the Pope. His perverted instincts
accept it as an honor to have been proved a black
guard by the Vatican. It is the only advertisement
he could get from that quarter, and the disgrace of it
is quite lost in perverted pride at his achievement
of any notice.
Nevertheless his offense is most indecent. Leo
XIII holds a position in the world's affairs that is
not all due to his headship of the world's most ven
erable and enduring institution. His Christian cour
tesy and politeness, which have been saluted alike by
Czar and Sultan, are personal qualities among those
that mark him as a man of genius and a primate
among the world's intellectual factors. Surely it is
an insult to all fair-minded men when Hearst invades
the distinguished seclusion of such a Pope to parade
a faked interview with his chief confidential officer
and publish falsely views that were never uttered in
a conference that was never held.
Such a thing is not journalism. It is crime and of
a nature that might lead to the saddest of conse
quences. But in Hearst's view such considerations
do not weigh against the chance to sell a few papers
by lying and to boast of an enterprise that exists only
in faking falsehoods.
After these exhibitions of hardened vice what con
fidence can be put in his dealings with lesser subjects
affecting a smaller circle of interests and individuals
of less note in the world but with the same right to
protection against a lying publication that belongs
to the Pope?
THE OMAHA EXPOSITION.
OMAHA will open on June i an exposition
which will serve the double purpose of show
ing what the Mississippi and Missouri valley
States have accomplished and of stimulating the
Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast States to make a
similar exposition of their resources and industries.
The prospects are that each of these purposes will be
fully achieved. The valley States will make a splen
did demonstration of the work of their people, and
the Western section of the Union will receive an ob
ject lesson in the value of such enterprises which will
prompt its people to imitate the energy of the
Nebraskans and eclipse their accomplishment.
In one sense the Omaha exposition, like all others
of its class, is designed to afford an opportunity for
an exhibit of the products of all nations, and this
design will of course be carried out to a greater or
less extent, Certainly all the States of the Union
will have considerable exhibitions there, and most
of the nations of Europe will be represented in some
forms of their industry. Nevertheless it will be vir
tually a Mississippi Valley exposition. Nebraska
and the surrounding States will have the attention of
investors and home-seekers while the exposition is
going on. Visitors will see what opportunities are
offered in Omaha and the region round about it for
trp.de and industry, and these opportunities will con
stitute the most important exhibit of the fair.
The States of the West can show many of their
products and specimens of their resources at Omaha,
and from them considerable profit will be derived;
but the only way by which to show the West as a
whole, or even an important section of it, is to hold
an exposition in the West and bring home-seekers
and investors out to see the country itself. What we
could send East, if we exerted all our energies to that
end. would be but a fraction of what we can show to
those who would come to San Francisco. We can
not take the West to the people of the East; we
must bring them to the West.
What Omaha can accomplish San Francisco can
eclipse if she exerts herself. What the States around
Nebraska can do the States allied with California by
geography and history can surpass. The coming ex
position of the Golden West ought to far exceed in
rvery way what will be achieved by the trans-
Mississippi exposition. It will, therefore, be worth
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAKCH XI, 1898.
our while to study the Omaha exposition 'closely so
as to be able to profit by every lesson it teaches.
It promises to be one of the most notable expositions
ever held in a city of the class of Omaha in any por
tion of the world. The model will be an excellent
one and can hardly fail to rouse Western emulation
to active efforts at achieving greater things in the
proposed exhibit of 1900.
f?N EARLY CAMPAIGN.
ALL signs point to the conclusion that the po
litical campaign is to begin much earlier this year
than is customary when there is no Presiden
tial election to engage the attention of the people.
In the Eastern States evidences of activity are notable
among the leaders of all parties, and the activity is
not of a factitious character, for popular interest in
the approaching contest is much greater than is
usual so far in advance of the time for holding con
ventions and nominating candidates.
Among the events likely to hasten the opening of
the campaign is the expected early adjournment of
Congress. The business of both the House and the
Senate is so well advanced that the prospects are this
will be one of the shortest on record of what are
known as the "long sessions" of Congress. As soon
as the Congressmen get Lack to their constituents
and set about repairing their fences the struggle will
commence in earnest.
The people seem to be as eager for the contest as
the most ardent politician. In all sections of the
Union political discussions are beginning to be
heard. Men are announcing their choice of candi
dates for various offices, and not a few aspirants
frankly announce themselves as candidates. All these
things point to the conclusion that the opposing
parties are desirous of hastening the issue as much
as possible, and the leaders will not have much to
do to start the campaign and set it rolling rapidly
almost as early this year as if a Presidential election
were in sight.
In this condition of the popular mind and with
such prospects before them the leaders and organ
izers of the Republican party in California should at
once set about the task of forming clubs and bring
ing the full membership of the party into close rela
tionship with its organization. This Is to be a peo
ple's year in this State. Any attempt to run machine
politics or to carry a slate made up by bosses to suc
cess at the polls will be defeated almost to a cer
tainty. It is therefore a matter of great importance
to get the rank and file of the Republican party or
ganized so that the members can act with effective
ness in determining the course to be pursued in all
nominating conventions. If this is not done the
campaign will be one of hazard, but if carried out
victory will be virtually assured.
This, then, is the situation that confronts Repub
licanism in California. An early organization and a
free and fair field for all candidates with an untram
meled expression of the choice of the rank and file
will mean victory for all that Republicanism stands
for. It will redeem several Congressional districts
in the State now represented by Democrats or
Populists. It will assure California for sound money
and protection. Any delay in organization, any at
tempt at boss dictation or at any sort of a cut and
dried programme arranged by a clique will endanger
everything and may lose the State and even some of
the Congressional districts now in the hands of Re
publicans. The duty of the hour therefore is or
ganization. Let the party leaders see to it.
THE LESSON OF THE CRISIS.
r\ MERICANS of all parties arc Justly gratified
/\ with the swift action of Congress in passing
* * the bill appropriating $50,000,000 to provide
for national defense, and are also well pleased in the
consciousness that President McKinley deserves the
confidence reposed in him and will make prompt and
effective use of the money in preparing the nation to
meet the emergency of war if it should arise.
There is one aspect of the vote, however, which is
by no means pleasing, and that aspect discloses itself
the moment the people begin to consider why the
vote was necessary. It is generally understood that
in case war breaks out a very large portion of the
amount will be expended in purchasing warships. In
fact the reports are that Commander Brownson has
gone to Europe for the express purpose of making ar
rangements for the purchase of ships in case such
action should be necessary, and the estimates are
that upward of $20,000,000 may be expended in that
way.
If we have to make this hasty vote of $50,000,000
and hurry an official abroad to negotiate for war
ships because of a possible war with a nation so weak
as Spain, it is easy to see what would have happened
had we been involved in a war with England over the
Venezuelan question when Cleveland sent forth his
startling ultimatum on the subject. To have pre
pared ourselves in a sudden emergency to withstand
the matchless navy of that ruler of the seas we would
have had to buy half the warships on the globe.
The moral of the situation is plain. The United
States should have a navy sufficient to meet any pos
sible emergency without having to rush in hot haste
to buy ships from foreign countries after the emer
gency arises. It is gratifying that Congress has
shown a willingness to vote $50,000,000 for national
defense, but it would have been more gratifying if
the money had been voted long ago and had been ex
pended in building ships in our own navy yards.
The United States has faithfully cherished the
memory of Washington and the people have made a
household proverb of his words, "To be prepared for
war is the most effectual means to preserve peace,"
but for all the wisdom that Congress has learned
from them they might as well have been forgotten.
We have not prepared for war. We have built some
ships, but not enough to guard our wide, extended
coasts and protect our numerous ports. The result
is that in a moment of crisis we have to vote $50,
000,000 without debate and be proud of it.
The lesson has been impressively given and ought
to be profitably employed. The amount voted for
national defense should be made absolutely devoted
to that purpose whether we have a war with Spain or
not. We should no longer leave ourselves in a con
dition that compels us to buy foreign ships when a
third-rate power that cannot whip Cuba threatens us
with immediate battle.
The engagement of a theatrical manager having
been announced, that gentleman hastens to the front
with a denial. The journalists who have selected a
wife for him and all but married them off may justly
feel aggrieved at this. Still, to have informed him
of the identity of his bride would have been a piece
of thoughtfulness on their part. A man naturally
feels jarred by first learning from the public prints
whom he is to be led with to the altar.

awhile I muffle,
And I moan and mourn the dead.

RANK IN THE NAVYâ A. L,. 8.. Mar

rank in the United States navy at this
time is rear admiral, created by the act
of Congress, July 16, 1562. Then the rank
is in the following order: Commodore,
captain, commander, lieutenant-comman
der, lieutenant, lieutenant junior grado
and ensign. The office of vice-admiral
and then admiral were specially created
for David G. Farragut in recognition of
his services to the country during the Re
bellion. In 1862 he was commissioned rear
admiral and was the first to hold that
rank in the navy. The same rank was
conferred on Goldsburough, Dupont,
Foote and others to the namtet of .eleven,
and on the 12th of August of that year
Farragut as senior rear-admiral hoisted
the square blue Hag at the mainmast
head of the Hartford, then at New Or
leans. Subsequently the law was amend
ed and Farragut as rear-admiral retro
graded his flag to the mizzen. On De
cember 21, 1864, he was advanced to vice
admiral, and he placed his flag at tJio
foremast, and when on the 25th of J| ,
1866, he was created admiral, he asufi.i
raised his flag to the mainmast-head.
"When Farragut was made admiral David
D. Porter was advanced to vice-admiral,
and upon the death of Farragut in 1870
he succeeded Farragut as admiral. These
were the only two men in the navy that
the Government desired to honor, and in
later years there was passed a law which
says that "vacancies occurring in the
grades of admiral and vice-admiral shall
not be filled in promotion nor in any
other manner, and when the offices of
said grade shall become vacant the
grades shall cease to exist." The office
of admiral ceased to exist with the death
of Porter, February 13, IS9I.

Stanton Writes He Is Growing Desperate, He Has Spent
His Last Dollar and Knows Not
What He Can Do.
Kennedy Assaults Kilpatrick During the Session of the Grand Jury and
Blows Seem Imminent Until Friends Interfere.
Ragan's Answer Filed.
March 8, 1898.
Mr. Kilpatrick: I am given to understand, though I can hardly realize it,
that you. having secured my affidavit, have no further use for me.
I have consulted legal adviceâ spending my last dollarâ and I am informed
that the rascals are too strong for me and already have me in a hole.
I sacrificed myself for you and placed reliance on your support.
The old trouble is back in my head and I am desperate. I don t know
what I am doing or shall do.
1 hope to-morrow you will profit by the truth. My conscience is clear.
The school scandal Is growing like a
Ftorm cloud, and there may be more
than shattered reputations and a
basketful of official heads before the
end arrives.
Stanton has written a letter to Kil
ratrick in which he says some thing:
that carry a world of bitterness a
well as a note of desperation. Ken
nedy has came near to striking Kilpat
rick whom he met in the corridor o
the City Hall just after the Grant
Jurors had goaded and probed and
cross questioned until his head buzzed
and Ragan has invoked the machtnerv
of the law and threatens to file al
kinds of charges and every sort of lega
paper until there is either no more la\
el DO more Kilpatrick left. In th
meantime the Grand Jury is calling v
every one who knows anything abou
school matters or is suspected o
knowing of place buying, and when th
inquisitorial tree will blossom into a
crop of indictments no one knows.
"The old trouble is back in my head
and I am desperate." wrote Stanton,
and Kilpatrick carries the letter about
with him and thinks over it. It only
rt-fers to the statement published a few
days ago, he says, and he supposes
that Slant' in is repenting of having
made it. But Stanton is becoming em
bittered, and he will make a sensa
tional witness when called upon.
Kilpatrick was before the Grand
Jury yesterday, and N. Kennedy of the
Lincoln school waited with him in the
ante-room. Kennedy went in first,
and as the minutes slipped by and only
a confused murmur came through the
jury-room doors. Kilpatrick paced up
and down the ante-room and out into
the hall. It was during one of these
walks out into the hall that Kennedy
emerged from the ordeal, hot, flurried,
agitated, and with his temper on edge.
He strode through the ante-room
and as he reached the hall he ran into
Kiipatrick. Immediately "his angÂ»-r
blazed, and approaching Kilpatrick he
commenced to heap abuse upon his
head.
"Liar," "thief," "cur," were some of
the choice epithets he used, and he
would have gone farther than words if
Kilpatrick had not kept his temper and
merely remarked: "You are too old a
man to use such names to me."
"You had no right to say such things.
You had no right to say such things,"
shouted the irate Kennedy as he shook
his fist in Kilpatrick's face. "What
things," demanded the eager bystand
ers, hungry for some inside involun
tary information; but the question re
called the fleeting faculties of the en
raged Kennedy and he contented him
self with significantly repeating,
â¢ Those things," and then said "Those
charges."
There was no fight after all, but it
had come close to it, and there will
be more before the scandal shall have
closed.
Kennedy was employed in Monterey i
County as a teacher. He sent his wife
to San Francisco for the purpose of
receiving medical treatment. While she ;
was here she met Dr. Ragan, the school
director, and endeavored to obtain his
Influence to get a position for her hus- j
MARTEAU AND
THE SYMPHONY.
Just ns the members, patrons and crit
ics of the Symphony Society are getting
used to the luxury of- two concerts to
the month, with good music, good band
and first-rate leader, what must the en
terprising directors do but throw in a
high-class soloist. The concerts were
paying handsomely without soloists; the
subscriptions ran high In the thousands
before the season had commenced; the
ladies â God bless 'emâ took it into their
heads that It would be the real cultured
thing to go to the symphonies, and the
cvory-other Thursday at the Tlvoll was
made to be the swellest thing in town.
And all without the first sign or promise
of a soloist. Perhaps it was too wonder
ful to have lasted; but now we never
shall know. Marteau, the first soloist, has
played. He is an artist, and his success
with the audience was so swift and
unanimous that already I tremble for the
concerts to come. The symphony au
diences here are, as a whole, handsome,
modishly robed, elegantly hatted and
nicely mannered; but they are not, as a
whole or as a half, musical in that higher
degree which absolutely craves such con
certs as Scheel has given us.

She afterward met Mrs. Sol Kampe, the
wife of the money lender, and then ef
fected a loan of $300 from Kampe. Im
mediately after securing this money
she telegraphed to her husband to como
immediately to San Francisco. This
telegram was delivered to Kennedy by
a special messenger at his home, four
miles from the telegraph office, and Im
mediately on its receipt he started for
San Francisco, and on his arrival In
this city met Dr. Ragan and was im
mediately afterward appointed as sub
stitute teacher.
He reported every day at the school
to which he had been assigned, and for
this service drew $1 each day from the
city treasury. He was soon promoted
to the position of regular teacher, and
assigned under Principal E. C. Kilpat
rlck. Owing to differences between
Kennedy and Kilpatrick, the former
was transferred by Director Ragan to
a more congenial school.
Before the Grand Jury yesterday
Kennedy stated positively that he nev
er paid to Ragan or anyone else 1 cent
i for his position.
George Atherton was called, and tes
tified that it was common rumor that
certain teachers had paid for their po
sitions. He will appear before the jury
at its next meeting and give names,
dates and amounts of money paid. He
! paid that it was common rumor that G.
E. Stanton had paid money to Dr. Ra
gan for his place.
E. C. Kilpatrick was called, and pre
1 sented his affidavit and statement which
has already been published, and which
! declares that Stanton had paitl Ragan
for his position. He said that it was
common talk that Kennedy had paid
Ragan for his place with money that he
had borrowed from Kampe. His testi
mony was confined to the Stanton case
alone.
An effort was made to have a sub
f pena served on Mrs. Kampe. in order
that she may tell what she knows about
[ the borrowing: of money from her hus
band by Mrs. Kennedy, but Mrs. Kampo
: is said to be in the East, and could not
be found.
The Grand Jury adjourned until next
Monday, when the investigation will be
continued. Notwithstanding the asser
tions of Kennedy that he paid no mon
ey for his position, a number of the
Grand Jurors are of the opinion that
he secured the place by the payment
of cash.
Ragan Filed His Answer.
School Director Ragan filed his answer
to the Kllpatrick complaint yesterday
morning in Judge Cook's department of
the Superior Court. He was accompanied
by his attorneys, W. W. Foote and A. J.
Clunie. who Informed the court that Ra
gan had waived the statutory ten days'
time in which to answer and asked the
court to pet the case for hearing without
delay. Attorneys Aldrich and Deuprey
protested against an early hearing of the
case, but ass the defendant's attorneys re
newed the demand Judge Cook placed the
case on the calendar for next Monday
evening.

that I do not appreciate the advantage
both to him and to us that lay In effect

the co-operation of Scheel and his or
chestraâbut I fear a new appetite In the
fashionable crowd which by Its support
has made those symphonies possible; I
tremble at the prospect of a whole season
of soloists. If they could all be Marteaus
it would be different; but San Francisco
is so situated on the map that of
necessity good soloists must be few
and far between. There would al
ways be that horrible alternative
of the resident artist. And, laying aside
all foolishness of local pride, there Is not
one instrumentalist in the townships of
San Francisco, Oakland and Alameda
who could appear as soloist with the
present Scheel orchestra without dis
grace. I have melancholy souvenirs of
the Hinrlchs and other symphony seasons
that were disfigured by the Interpolation
of local virtuosi.
As luck would have It at yesterday's
concert the symphonyâ Hermann Goetz's
first and onlyâ was a dull one. It was
now to me, and I frankly confess that I
am not anxious for a more extended ac
quaintance with its difficult charms. The
only composer who ever lured me to seek
the poetry in his prose was Brahms. I
grew hollow-chested and long-oared hunt
ing humanness under his glacial formal
ity. I respect but do not envy the per
sons who can call Goetz great. In the
first movementâ allegro moderatoâ where
the subtle profundity is said to He, I
heard nothing but superficial dullness.
The intermezzo and the adagio are
sprightlier, warmer and much more
imaginative; the finale, "which, of itself,"
says one annotator, "is a sufficient indi
cation of the success this brilliant com
poser might have achieved as a sym
phony writer had not death cut him down
in the very threshold of his career,"
sounded to me to be clumsy and trite, the
climax banally lacking in invention and
emphasis. And 1 do not think that any
of my unappreciation was due to Scheel,
who played the symphony with every
possible care. The best Wagner playing
Scheel has done In many a day was In
the Wagner "Faust" overture; the strings
were a bit muddy in the roaring pass
ages at the close, but otherwise the band
behaved splendidly, and for once Scheel
seemed to go in less for Richard's huge
stride and sway and more for his human
analysis. Tschaikowsky's Italian caprice
came last on a programme so long that
even the god of modern Russia in one
of his most rhythmical and popular moods
could not keep more than two-thirds of the
audience in their chairs. Scheel must
have been affected by the restless atmos
phere, for he gave the piece about one
half the usual color and smash.
Marteau's success Is unquestionable. He
playÃ with the freshness and piquancy of
youth without any of its usual extrava
gance or bumptiousness; in fact, at times
there is in his work an almost austerity
that seems incongruous with his lithe,
young presence. He is not a passionato

fiddler, nor a notably powerful one; his
charm, I think, lies most especially in
delicacy and certainty of enunciation. He
played the first two movements of the
Bruch G miner concerto with phenomenal
delicacy; his technique was easy, even
and Irreproachable; and in the liquid pas
sages of the adagio he played with a feel
ing that was none the less poetic and
beautiful for the characteristic restraint
laid upon it.
In the first bars of the finale his tone
was miniature compared with the full
crash called for by the music, but he met
the other various difficulties of the move
ment with unerring leap and poise; and
in an encore, Wagner's 'â¢Albumblatt," he
brought out a tone that was cordial and
round.
But best of all was the first of the Bach
sonatas for violin alone, of which Mar
teau gave a truly faultless performance.
He elucidated what for me had always
been the incomprehensible adagio; he
erystalized the fugue until I could all but
see it; and he took the presto at a suicide
pace without blurring a single note.

Dines Nelson, Contemplating Suicide
by Drowning and Hanging,
Blows Out His Brains.
Dines Nelson, a laundryman, who work
ed at the San Francisco Laundry, 1519
Eddy street, shot himself last evening at
the foot of Filbert street, near the sea
wall. The bullet entered the right tem
ple and passed clear through the head.
In his pocket was a note which stated
that he was poor and had no place to go.
The man had evidently been contem
plating' suicide by a different means, as
he had a piece of window cord in his
pocket. His close proximity to the water
leads to the belief that it might also have
been his intention to drown himself. The
pistol was a new one and he had a full
box of cartridges in his pocket. Nelson
was a Swede and about 40 years old.

Miss Gertrude Elaine Wolfe and Dr. Frederick G. Canney were married yes

Taber, 3360 Twenty-third street.
Palms, violets, deep purple and white, and white ribbons made a most effect

elegant gown of white brocaded satin. The jupe was made en train and the
corsage elaborately trimmed with point lace and chiffon. The bridal veil was
fastened to the coiffure with r. wreath of orange blossoms and lilies oi the
valley. The bridal bouquet was composed of lilies of the valley.
Miss Blanche Taber, sister of the bride, officiated as bridesmaid, and Edwin
Wiloox of San Jose was best man.

critic. To be sure the wording was
vague, but she discerned in it a promise
of something suited to her talents. Per
haps some rich man with a hankering
after pictures and only Sundays to devote
to the hobby wanted a mentor and guide.
Possibly his soul yearned after the art
treasures of Mllpitas and Rodeo, and he
wished to be guarded against amateurish
errors of Judgment. Certainly there were
no recognized art centers to be visited
near San Francisco. Yet the subject
seemed worth pursuing, and the lady an

"I suppose I deserve It for paying any

husband did not seem to entertain a very

preciated the joke. Publication is made

SHOT AND SHELL
FOR THE OREGON
Four Hundred Tons of
Ammunition for the
Battleship.
Full Complement for the Forty-
Two Magazines of the
Vessel.
Urgent Demand for Better Docking
Facilities at the Navy-
Yard.
The battle-ship Oregon is to receive
at once 400 tons of ammunition. This
quantity will provide a full complement
for the forty-two magazines of the
ship. To-day the powder, shot and
shell will be brought from Mare Is
land to the Oregon's anchorage in Mis
sion bay.
Officers of the navy comment on the
fact that the ammunition must be
brought to the ship, because the ship
cannot go to the naval station at Mare
Island to receive supplies.
Of the fifty million dollars voted by
Congress for national defense there is
an urgent necessity for the expendi
ture of $250,000 for dredging at Mare
Island ami enlarging the dock at Mare
statiun. That amount of money, prop
erly expended, would provide docking
facilities for a battle-ship. Should a
vessel drift against the Oregon in a <
"norther, " such as swept the bay yes
terday morning, and smash the pro- i
pellers of the battle-ship, the results
would be serious. Without propellers
the ship could not go to Puget Sound
for docking facilities. On account of
low water Mare Island is not acces- |
sible for a ship of this size. In order ;
to use Hunters Point dock the battle
ship must be lightened by the removal j
of even her guns.
Estimates are on file in the Navy De
partment showing that the sum of
$250,000 would enlarge the dock at Mare
Island and deepen the channel.
It is believed by naval officers that
the Oregon will remain for a considera
ble length of time near San Francisco.
The report that the ship will go to
China is not credited.

Mrs. Tuttle alleges that on Wednesday
night Mrs. Rahn met her and after abus

FORD EXPLAINS
HIS POSITION
F. S. Stratton Was Em
ployed When He Re
fused to Act.
He Declined to Defend Suits
Brought Against the Har
bor Commission.
The Attorney Would Not Appear
Actions in Which He Believed
the Commission Wrong,
The proceedings at the trial of the
injunction suit brought by the Paraf
! fine Paint Company against the State
! Board of Harbor Commissioners were
! dull and uninteresting yesterday. Tha
| witnesses called were examined on
technical points and there was noth-
I ing to relieve the monotony.
Attorney Tlrey L. Ford was recalled
and examined relative to the employ
; ment of Attorney F. S. Stratton by the
! Harbor Commissioners as special coun-
I sel. The testimony of Ford, although
i rather reluctantly given, showed that
! Stratton had been specially employed
when Ford declined to defend the board
i in suits where he believed the law was
against the Commissioners' side of the
; case.
Ford testified that the only case in
which he had requested the employ
i ment of other counsel was in the case
lof Healy, Tibbetts & Co., against the
: board, in which it was sought to en
i join the board from receiving bids on a
i patented process for creosotlng piles,
i When asked his reasons for desiring
! the board to employ other counsel In
' that case. Ford said that he had come
! to the conclusion, after an examination
j of the case, that the specifications ac
' cepted by the board did not admit of
j fair competition as to the ere-
I osoting process of preserving piles.
IHe said he had consulted the
chief engineer as to the facts
upon which he had based his conclu
sions. He further testified that he toUl
| the board he did not feel he ought to
; present a defense to the court which
he did not believe in himself. The
board thereupon employed Stratton and
Ford turned the case over to him, cx
i plaining to Stratton why he, Ford, "did
| not care to try the case. Ford said
I he was not subsequently consulted as
; to specifications for the preservation of
' piles.
He said he had examined the claims
!of the S. E. Slade Lumber Company
j that were contested in the Pacific Pine
; Lumber Company cases, and had
I reached the conclusion that they were
! all valid except a small portion, about
i which there was some doubt.
W. G. Curtis, superintendent of the
I maintenance of way department of the
j Southern Pacific Company, was next
! examined concerning his idea of the
j proper manner of creosotlng piles. He
testified that the method known as the
Isaacs & Curtis process, of which he
Is one of the patentees, was in his opin
i ion the best method for timber pre
! serving. He admitted having had sev
1 eral conversations with Commissioner
I Colnon, in which he advised Colnon
that the Isaacs & Curtis process was
better than any in use.
Chief Engineer Holmes and James
Godfrey were questioned at considera
ble length concerning the condition of
the piles used in wharf repair. They
j were of the opinion that all of the piles
delivered by the several constructing
I companies had been properly treated to
; prevent the ravages of teredos.
The further trial of the case will be
{ resumed Monday morning.
Drank Champagne Cider.
John Johnson, an unsophisticated sail
or, went Into the Monte Carlo dive on
; Jackson and Kearny streets Wednesday
I night and or"JÂ»:ed a bottle of beer. One
I of the women brought him a bottle of
i champagne cider and he gave her a $20
gold piece to pay for it. When he asked
i for the change he was thrown out, and
j yesterday applied to Assistant Prosecut
i ing Attorney Hogan of Judge Conlan's
! court for a warrant. Hogan told him
| he would inquire into the case and ad
vised him to call to-day.

"Right Jurors now occupy the box to

secured out of twenty-one talesmen who
were examined yesterday. Shortly after
' 3 o'clock the panel was exhausted and the
case went over until this morning. It is
thought that the jury will be completed
to-day.

KESLER TELLS
OF HIS LOAN
TO THE MAYOR
He Flatly Contradicts
One of Mr. Thomas'
Statements.
Says He Well Knew From
Whom His Son Bor
rowed Money.
Edward Noblett Said to Have
Acted as the Go-
Between.
DENIAL OF THE CHARGE.
The People of Oakland Anxious for
the Grand Jury to Make a Thor
ough Investigation.
Oakland's boodle Councllmpn are en-
Joying brief immunity from censure
â while the citizens are engrossed with
the newer scandal involving Mayor
Thomas and his son, Harry, who are
alleged to have used their influence to
secure the appointment of J. \V. Kesler
to a position on the police force for a
consideration.
This exposure, following on the heels
of the water job, has worked the. peo
ple across the bay into an exceedingly
ugly frame of mind, and among all
classes there is a unanimity of senti
ment that official corruption must be
stopped â and at once. However, the
people have every confidence in the in
tegrity of the Grand Jury and they are
willing to trust the ferreting out of
â¢wrong-doing to that body, believing
that the guilty will be brought to jus
tice in due time.
Mayor Thomas and his son, who is
also his Secretary, make light of Kes
ler's charges and say they court the
fullest investigation, but the "Dear
Jim" letter, written by Harry Thomas
to Kesler. which the would-be police
man has made public, is a source of no
little annoyance to them. In fact, the
Mayor has stated that it was "indis
creet" on his son's part to indite such
a letter.
Kesler made a detailed statement
yesterday, in which he emphatically
denies Mayor Thomas' assertion that
Thomas did not know whom his son was
to borrow the money from because the
note wr.s blank when he indorsed it.
Kesler says he had the note drawn up
by his daughter, and that it was reg
ularly filled out when it was presented
to Thomas for his indorsement.
Kesler's statement is as follows:
I sent in my application for appoint
ment on the police force on June 22. of
last year. Mayor Thomas had known me
for years and when I spoke to him about
the appointment he promised to do every
thing in his power to assist me. He told
me to undergo the medical examination
right away, BO I went \o Dr. Dunn, the
Health Officer, and said I wanted to be
examined. Dr. Dunn said he would ex
amine me with the other applicants, but
when I said the Mayor had told me to be
examined at once. Dr. Dunn granted my
request.
On July 10 Ed Noblett came to me at
the exposition, where I was employed,
and told me that if I wanted to get onto
the police force it would be a good plan
to loan the Thomases a little money. Nob
lett said they wanted $200 immediately.
I told him I did not have that amount,
but I would see what I could do.
During the noon hour I went to the City
Hall #.nd saw Harry Thomas. I asked him
What the trouble was and he replied that
they were in a hole, and that the Cali
fornia Hank would sue them unless they
met a claim at once. He said they needed
$200. I asked if it would not do if I went
to the bank and went security for them.
Thomas replied that such a course would
not do, but that if 1 would let him have
$100 at once it would save him. I asked to
Bee his father, but he said the Mayor was
All I fear for is that Sharkey will not j
fight according to our agreement which '
says that there shall be no hitting in
the clinches. If he stands off and
makes a clean, open fight I shall be j
the first to congratulate him if he j
whips me; that's all I have to say."
Last evening Eddie Graney, in be
half of Choynski, met Tom Sharkey
and the managers of the National |
Club, according to appointment, at 8 I
o'clock at the Baldwin Hotel, with the |
away attending to some Christian En
deavor business. I then told Harry
would do the best I could for him and
went away.
July 13 I had $100, which I took to the
City Hall. I had the note for that amount
already drawn up and gave it to Harry
Thomas to sign and to get his father's
indorsement. He took the note and said
he would get his father to sign it. A little
j later he came to the exposition with the
| note properly signed, and I gave him the
; $100.
About two weeks ago I loaned Harry
Thomas $100 more on a note similarly ex
j ecuted. If the Mayor says he merely
I signed a note to accommodate his son,
i and did not know from whom he was
j borrowing, he is not telling the truth, for
my daughter wrote out the notes and my
1 name was on them before they were
I signed by the Mayor.
Soon after loaning him the second $100
I received a letter from Harry Thomas,
which 1 still have, and which reads:
Dear Jim: A thousand
thanks for your kindness, and
you can depend on us when the
time presents itself. It will
come in the near future and
you can be sure you will be
one of the first. Sincerely,
HARRY THOMAS.
The sixty clays for which the notes were
drsTvn passed, but they were not paid.
The morning of the Saturday on which
the new officers were to be appointed Ed
Noblett came to me again and said
Thomas had assured him I could be ap
pointed and asked that when I was
chosen I would tear up the notes. I said
I would do nothing rash, but would wait
a while, and I made no promises.
I was not appointed, and the following
Monday I went to the Mayor's office and
demanded immediate payment of the two
notes. He said he did not have the money,
but would have it by 1 o'clock. I told him
I could not return for it and gave my
opinion of him In very positive language.
A little later Harry Thomas was in Fos
ter's saloon and told those who were,
there that I had given "his old man" a
raking down, and that It was very tunny.
I told the Mayor I would he at the cor
ner of Eleventh and Broadway at. 1
o'clock, and that if the money was not
forthcoming then It would be unfortu
nate. The Mayor said he hoped 1 did
not intend to shoot, and I replied that I
preferred to kill him by inches.
I was at the appointed place at the
hour named and Harry Thomas gave me
$200 in the presence of witnesses. I had
the notes photographed for various rea
sons.
I did not loan the money for a position
on the police force, and I would have col
lected it whether I secured the appoint
ment or not. Xo effort was made to sell
me a position and I made no effort to
purchase one. I have no fight against
the Thomases, but Harry has been doing
some talking and I think it Is time to
set myself straight in the matter.
Ed Noblett, who is said by Kesler to
have acted as a sort of go-between,
gave his version of the affair to a Call
reporter yesterday. He said:
I have known Mayor Thomas and his
son Harry for a long time, and some time
ago Harry asked me where he could bor
row some money. I named over a num
ber of people I knew of who made a busi
ness of loaning money, among them was
Kesler. This man Kesler has been shav
ing warrants for a long time, and Harry
thought ho would bo a good man to go to.
He asked me where Kesler could be
found and I told him he was employed
at the exposition. I was going In that
direction and Harry asked me to see Kes
ler and tell him to go up to the City Hall
and sec Harry. I did so, telling him that
Thomas wanted to borrow some money.
That is all the connection I had with the
affair. Kesler's assertion that I went to
him the day the appointments were made
and advised him to destroy the notes is
absurd. 1 only saw him that once about It.
The McKenzie Musicale.
: The friends, of ' the McKerizie Musical
Society filled Odd Fellows' Hall last
evening: to its utmost capacity. The occa
sion was the tenth. invitation musical and
hop of the society. The musical pro
gramme was wonderfully elasticâ that is
to say. It embraced both the classical and
the topical, ranging as it did from the
"Intermezzo" from the "Cavalleria" to
"My Coal -Black Lady." Sheriff R. I.
Whelah with his comic selections made
the hit of the evening. P. J. Grodjens, C.
Jacklin and Miss Minnie Powell also came
in for a generous share of the applause.
The musicale was followed by the hop
and many enjoyed the dancing. -

Man, Booked on Several
Charges of Burglary.
WANTS TO PLEAD GUILTY.
All the Stolen Property Recovered
by Detectives Ryan and

Another member of Jesus Christ's
Army has gone wrong.
His name is Frank Anderson, aged
22 years. Last night he was arrested
by Detectives Ryan and ODea and was
locked up in the tanks in the City
Prison. To-day he will be formally
charged with burglary.
Several days ago Anderson, who was
dressed in the uniform of the army,
visited a lodging-house at 118 Sixth
street and rented a room. Soon after
his advent in the house the landlady
missed several articles which she had

M. Murphy, the racing judge.
Graney had hardly finished naming
his men when Sharkey interrupted him
with the statement that his selections
were very poor and that they would
not go with him, etc.
â Who are your men, Tom?" asked
Grar.ey.
"Well, they are all good people," re
plied Sharkey, "and you can pick any
one of them you like. Here they are:
There's Billy Harrison, a dead honest
in her room. While she was making
investigation Anderson was busy en
tering a room in the upper floor and
stealing everything portable. Alto
gether hÂ»' visited nine rooms and stole
clothing and jewelry valued at $400.
The stolen valuables were placed in
two valises, and awaiting a favorable
opportunity Anderson quietly left the
house. He sold part of the property
to a second-hand dealer on Howard
street, and the remainder to a pawn
broker in Oakland.
Immediately after the crime was dis
covered the landlady *of the house not
ified Captain Spillane, who detailed
Ryan and ODea to find the thief.
With only a faint description of him
the detectives located him last night
and placed him under arrest. Subse
quently they recovered nearly all of the
stolen property.
When taken in ftitstbdy ! Anderson
wore a suit of clothes which he had
stolen from the house.
"I guess I'm up against it," coolly re
marked the prisoner when questioned
by the detective. "All I want is a
chance to plead guilty."
Anderson said he had joined Jesus
Christ's Army several weeks ago, as he
was hungry, and knew that the mem
bers would not let him starve.
"After being initiated," he laugh
ingly remarked, "I struck the main guy
for a handout and he gave me a single
meal ticket. I th.-n donned the uniform
of the army, and made a big hit by
telling the guys on the streets that I
had accepted salvation and intended to
lead a better life. The officers of the
army got stuck on my ability as a
gpieler, and they just threw bouquets ;
at my feet. That simply* knocked me 1
silly, and I thought I was Swiftwater
Bill or some other speedy guy.
"When I rented the room in the house
on Sixth street I meant to be dead
straight, and would have been so if the
landlady hadn't left the doors wide
open. I couldn't resist the temptation,
and, shedding my uniform, I entered
the one nearest me.
"Oh, such a pickup! Nothing but
swell shoes and hats and a cane that
would have knocked the king of dudes
silly. I just copped 'em off, and went
to the next room. The same easy graft

thought. After getting all the stuff in

while the landlady was looking for
some things she had lost I quietly
ducked my nut.

Graney objected to every person
named, especially Harrison, who,
Graney said, was altogether too good to
act as a boxing judge.
Several names were mentioned, but
Sharkey was obdurate. He wanted to
go home and have a good sleep and as
a parting salute said that he would
dream over the matter.

Wenker refused the request, and
backing into an alcove, where he keeps

opened fire.
The robber answered with his revolv

seize the robber by the arm, when he
turned around and shot at the new
comer, the bullet passing through his
coat.
Backing out of the saloon, the daring
robber ran up Fifteenth street, and
turned into Dolores, where he was
joined by his pal. The two men then
turned down a side street and made
their escape.
Officers from the Seventeenth-street
station in citizen clothes have been out

he expects to land them before morn

TO BE NO CUT IN
OVERLAND RATES
Mr. Stubbs Says the Southern
Pacific Cannot Stand
One.
Local Eusiness Men Request the
Railroad Company to Give
R = lief.
About 100 commercial persons and busi
ness men assembled in the Chamber of
Commerce yesterday in a special meet-
Ing called by Vlce-President Nelson of
the Chamber of Commerce; those present
were members of the Chamber, Mer
chants' Association and the local Board
of Trade. The object was to have a con
ference with J. C. Stubbs of the Southern
Pacific Company to see if something could
be done to regain some of the trade that
Is now being lost in consequence of the
rate war among the northern railroads
and the Southern Pacific's determination
to maintain the old rates.
Mr. Stubbs was present, and. for some
reason, best known to those who wanted
to ask something of the representative
of the railroad, members of the press
were excluded.
Later it was learned Mr. Nelson stated
that in consequence of the cheapness of
the fares on the northern lines and the
high rates on the Southern Pacific the
"I will meet you here at 2 o'clock to
morrow and will have another list of
names to present," said Sharkey, "and
I think we will agree upon some good
man; all I want is a fair shake."
Sharkey and his trainer, Tim Mc-
Grath, made their escape from the par
ty and Graney, who felt rather put out
because a referee was not selected, said
he was satisfied that Sharkey had not
the least intention of selecting any per
son until to-day.
"You see, the fellow is suspicious,"
bulk of the Alaska travel that should
come to this coast by way of San Fran
cisco has been diverted to the northern
ports, and this city is getting the "go-by"
to its great detriment. As a consequence
the local merchants are suffering severe
ly, where they should be reaping a golden
harvest by outlitting many thousands of
people going to the gold fields. It was
desirable that something should be done
to give the San Francisco merchants a
chance, and bring some of the travel from
the East this way.
Mr. Stubbs listened, and then explained
that the rate war was all on account of
troubles between the Canadian Pacific
and the Great Northwestern, which had
been cutting rates until now first and
second-class rates from St. Paul to Seat
tle are $20 and $10, with the prospects of
another cut of one-half by the 11th lnst.
He said his company could not meet this
kind of cutting, as it could not recover
$1 for $1 expended. The company is in
business for profit, the same as a mer
chant, and cannot afford to run at a
loss. Another reason given was that such
a cut as was wanted would ruin the
Southern California and Mexican travel.
People would come over the cut-rate line
and take steamers to the southern parts
of the country, and any increase in
Alaska travel would not compensate for
this loss. He maintained that the Alaska
travel has already begun to decrease, and
furtheremore, Seattle is the natural route
to the gold fields.
Mr. Johnson, of one of the transporta
tion companies, thought that the natural j
route was from this city to St. Michael i
by steamer. He held that the trails are j
dangerous to travel. He took issue with j
Mr. Stubbs on the point that the travel
is nearly over, for according to his esti
mate at least 50,000 people are booked for
the valley of the Yukon, and he believes
that if the Southern Pacific should make I
a fight for this travel the majority of
these would go north by the way of this j
city. It would mean much to the local j
merchants, for these people would have j
to take in with them about 75,000 tons of ]
provisions.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. March 10.â At the open
ag of the New (Charter Club to
riipht the campaign for the election of
April 11 was informally opened. All
regular business was dispensed with
and the evening devoted to short ad
dresses by some of the representative
men of San Jose. The remarks were
rharacterized by earnestness, dignity
and determination. There was no abuse
of individuals,, but strong condemna
tion was pronounced on the corrupt
methods that have been ingrafted on I
the local government through the I
machinations of boodlers, corruption- ]
ists, bosses and ringsters.
In the course of the proceedings the
chairman announced that the club now
had a membership of more than four
hundred, and the list was being mate
rially increased each day.
Judge J. R. Lewis was the first speak
er. He began as follows: "I think the
time for talking is not now. I think
the time this evening is for action. The
quicker we act the better." Continu
ing he said: "We have presented a
ticket to the citizens of San Jose in the
Interests of good government. This
ticket was selected only after a very
careful canvass. I am confident that
the greater mass of the people will in
dorse and vote for it. The appointing
board is, in my opinion, the most im
portant thing to look after."
He paid a tribute to S. E. Smith, the
new Charter Club's candidate for
Mayor, and also in a general way Fet
forth the qualifications of the other
candidates of the Charter Club.
'This club," he added, "should come
out now, and let the people know what
it is doing. We want to take the ag
gressive. We know the gang is fright
ened. Wo don't hear anything of par
ties. The .point I wish to suggest is
that we hold a grand public meeting
soon in the future. We know that
every newspape in San Jose is op- ;
posed to us. We must hold these meet
ings in order to educate the people, for i
our local papers cannot be depended j
upon to help us. At this meeting we j
|hould place the issues squarely before
rhe people. They are sick of the pres
ent government and certainly want a
change."
S. G. Tompkins said the most
thoughtful and prominent writers on
good government in the best magazines
of the country attributed prevalent cor
ruption in politics to the present sys
tem of boss rule, and urged the import
ance of freeing San Jose from this ne
farious influence. The New Charter
club, he said, was organized for this
purpose. He continued:
The way to accomplish this is
for every individual who has good
povernment at heart to do his share
and vote for the Charter Club ticket from
trip to bottom. [Applause.] If this Is
done we will win: if not I fear for the re
sult. I know every man on the ticket and
( very one in worthy of your support. I
have* learned that the other side is dili
gently at work casting slurs on the Char
ter < lub and its nominees. We should be
equally diligent in furthering our cause.
Let every member constitute himself a
committee of one to secure the success
of this movement.
M. O'Brien, the candidate for Coun
cilman from the Third Ward, said:
This Ifl a movement that we have been
waiting for for ten of fifteen years. This
Is the first opportunity the people have
had of electing the right kind of men to
office.
"W. G. Alexander urged united action.
"If the election were to be held to
day," he said, "we would be successful,
I have no doubt. But unless we stand
together between now and April 11 we
cannot be sure what the result will be."
He suggested that friends and neigh
bors be talked to in the proper way.
In conclusion he remarked: "I recog
nize that this is an important crisis In
the history of San Jose."
F. Brown, in the course of his re
marks, said:
I know that in the past the people of
San Jose had only a choice between the
devil and the deep sea, because the same
hand manipulated all the conventions. It
may be true that the other side has put
up "good men. but if it has we may
rightly claim the credit due for this But
I shall vote for every man on our ticket
and take no chances. Tne men whom our
opponents put Up may be good men. but
they must suffer as did old dog Tray
from the association he kept.
O. O. Felkner spoke. as follows:
We have reached a time when the law
abiding, decent people are called upon to
decide who Is to run the government of
the cityâ whether the people or the
Dosses. For years it has been run by we
gang by vie ..oodlers and the corrup
f.onlsts Whenever a municipality be
comes corrupt from top to bottom as of
has done it signalizes the downfall of
our government. This condition Is not
local. It exists in other cities. That. is
but the initiative of * movement that
will, I believe, .sweep. all : over- the S ate
and all over the country. It will lead, x
hope, to the restoration of pure govern-
m we* cannot have a schoolteacher ap

J. R. Patton. who entered the hall
with a number of friends at this junc
ture, on being called upon, addresseo
the gathering as follows:
I have just come from * : a 'meeting to
night and the expression there made by
the'men composing that meeting gave |
me a new heart and new courage and
a new thought respecting the momentous
work before us in the coming campaign.
There were men' in that meeting repre
senting other organizations. Sojme or
them I have met night after night in the
last three or four weeks considering, ad- |
vising, planning. . suggesting ' ways and .
means in order that this campaign may be ,
carried on in a proper spirit and to a j
proper end. SIS I wish particularly to urge.:
One thing I wish particularly to urge.
It is that every: man must interview
every man of his acquaintance In his. pre
cinct. Every member of our various or- j
ganizations must feel that he is consti
tuted a special committee to see that we
all stand together for good government
and economical administration. This is a
matter *fiat affects our homes. If this is
done all we will have to do on the day
of the election is to cast our votes and
the entire ticket will be elected from top
to bottom. In these various organizations
we have not xmly planned to go Into this
fight, but intend to keep up the move
ment for good government and the fight
against the spoilsmen. This is not a
temporary affair, for what we ought to
have in this cityâ the fairest city in the
State of California, what we must have
is honest, upright and pure government.
(Hearty applause.)
Guy H. Salisbury had this to say:
The task before us is to wrest the power
from those who have abused it. and to
put it in the hands of the friends of the
new charter and good government. The
organization of which I am a member
has been and is working in co-operation
with the New Charter Club. We have
no candidate to put forward. We repre
sent a principle and gladly join hands
with you in the fight for good govern
ment. Our object in the coming election
is to make the people realize their op
portunity. If they vote right, we are
bound to win. There are only two classes
of people engaged in this fight. On, one
side are the people who want good gov
ernment, on the other are the spoils seek
ers.
P. G. Gosbey closed the list of speak
ers. He particularly urged the neces
sity of united action, and the voting of
the New Cffarter Club ticket as awhole.
Arrangements will be made for a
grand, ratification meeting next week,
at which Mayor Phelan of San Fran
cisco and President Jordan of Stanford
University will be asked to speak.
There will also be several other able
and eloquent speakers.
NO FREE ENTRY
OF INDIAN LANDS
House Non - Concurs in the
Amendment Adopted by
the Senate.
Proposed Ratification of the Seminole
Treaty Also Given Its Death
Blow.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 10.â After a de
bate in the House which lasted more
than five hours the Senate amendment to
the Indian appropriation bill providing
for the free entry of ceded Indian lands
was to-day non-concurred in by a vote
of 99 to 136. The friends of the free home
clause made a gallant struggle, but they
met the opposition of some of the prom
inent leaders on the Republican side-r
Dingley, Grosvenor, Dalzell and Payneâ
and they were further weakened by the
fact that many of the friends of the prop
! osition were alienated by the belief that,
; as drawn, the amendment would work In
jury to the agricultural colleges of the
' country. The Senate amendment for the
; ratification of the Seminole treaty was
1 also non-concurred in after the substitute
; proposition offered by the conferees to
ratify the Kiowa. Comanche and Apache
1 treaty had fallen under a point of order.
: The action of the House to-day sends the
I bill back to conference with non-concur
! rence on all the Senate amendments.
Quiet Day In the Senate.
WASHINGTON, March 10.â No business
of real importance was transacted by the
Senate in open session to-day. The ses
sion lasted only an hour, the time being
largely consumed in disposing- of routine
morning business. A few bills of minor
importance were passed.
WING TUNG DIES TO-DAY.
The Condemned Celestial Refuses to
Utter a Word.
SAN Qt T ENTIN PRISON, March 9.â Up
In the death chamber Wing Tung, the
Chinaman who is to be executed to-mor
row morning, is rocking away the few
hours that he has left to live. He refuses
to enter into a conversation with tne
death watch, and only occasionally is his
voice heard. The Celestial sits in the
rocking chair in the death chamber and
rocks back and forth all day long. He is
under the constant surveillance of
Guards Jones and Abrogast, who
constitute the death watch, but there is
not the slightest danger of him attempt
ing suicide, and the watch has little to
do. ___________
NEATLY JOBBED
THE POOLROOMS
Fresno Men Place Bets on
Races After They Have
Been Decided.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO.MarchlO.â The poolrooms of
E. C. Sachs in the Fteke building, where
bookmaking was done on the races at
Ingleside and Oakland, will be closed
temporarily. The bookmakers were forced
to do this because during the last two
weeks they have been unable to get direct
bulletins from the tracks, and several
who have made it a business to play the
races have been getting "tips" after the
races were over, and betting accordingly.
The poolroom had a man at the track
who supplied it with private bulletins,
but he waited to send the betting on the
next race. In the meantime betting was
being done here after the event was over.
This afternoon the concern was beaten
out of several hundred dollars on Bal
lister. Then the same men offered to
back Mocorito in the second race, but
Sachs refused to accept their money, de
claring that he was being jobbed.
The proprietor of the poolroom an
nounced that he would close his business
for the present; but it is believed that
an attempt to reopen the bookmaking es
tablishment after it is once closed will
be opposed by the citizens, who have been
trying to abolish the place for some time.

SAN JOSE, March 10.â A bud and
blossom carnival will be held in this
city and county during the first week

there are miles and miles of delightful
drives. Lunches will be spread at
different points for the guests, while
other modes of entertainment will be
provided In the city. The carnival will
last two or three days.

BIRDSALL AGAINST PENDERGAST.
Promising Young Gladiators Who Will Match Their Science at
Sacramento To- Night.
SACRAMENTO, March 10.â Wells Birdsall of the Sacramento Athletic
Club and Tom Pendergast of the Manhattan Club of San Francisco will
meet to-morrow night in a twenty-round contest In the Assembly Hall of
the Athletic Club. Both are young men, but not without experience in the
ring, each having fought in the neighborhood of six battles and split about
even in the honors of their contests. Birdsall has trained at his home on
Sixteenth and T streets, in Sacramento, and Pendergast prepared for the
fray at a farmhouse in Alameda County. Considerable speculation Is in
dulged in concerning the result of the combat, and the odds that are offered
place the Sacramento boy on the long side. Pendergast men are found,
however, and before the event comes off there will no doubt be some spir
ited betting.
IN THE HANDS
OF THE JURY
Thomas Flanneily's Fate
a Matter of Specu
lation.
Either Disagreement or a Life-
Imprisonment Sentence
Expected.
Unable to Arrive at a Verdict, the
Jurors Are Locked Up for
the Night.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 10.â The Flannelly
case was given to the jury this after
noon at 6 o'clock. At 10 o'clock this
evening they had not agreed upon a
verdict and were locked up for the
right. It could not be learned how they
stood, but the fact that they did not
arrive at a verdict within a couple of
hours indicates that there will be
either a disagreement or that some of
them are holding out for life imprison
ment.
Attorney Straus finished his argu
ment about 11 o'clock this morning. He
said the defense did not try to prove
that Flannelly was crazy. On the con
trary his act was that of a sane man,
and in shooting his father he had
acted in self-defense. John Kerr he
denounced as a perjurer, who desired
to send Flannelly to the gallows so
that he could, through his wife, enjoy
the property that rightly belonged to
the defendant. In conclusion he asked
the Jury to give the defendant the ben
efit of any doubt that existed and ac
quit him.
District Attorney Herrington fol
lowed in the closing argument for the
people. As against the theory of self
defense counsel referred to the defend
ant's action after the murder, when he
went to the ranch, procured a Winches
ter rilie, barricaded the door of his
room and piled up blankets to protect
himself from the officers' bullets and
opened fire when ordered to surrender.
According to counsel Flannelly went
to his father's h>Â«use in a drunken con
dition, with his hr-art filled with anger,
and deliberately shot the old man with
out cause or pm vocation. His own
testimony in regard to the shooting
was unworthy of belief. It had been
contradicted by his aged mother, who
would not tell a lie even to save her
son from the gallows, and she had
been in a position to see all that oc
curred in the room of blood. He said
the defendant, not content with damn
ing the memory of his father, had at
tempted to blacken the name of his
mother by intimating that she had
committed perjury. Tne defendant
was referred to as one with a debased
and demoralized mindâ one without the
first instincts of manhood, who had
repaid years of generous treatment by
a most abhorrent murder.
District Attorney Herrington con
cluded his argument at 4:30, when
Judge Lorigan delivered his charge to
the jury and at 5 p. m. they retired to
deliberate.
BARTHELMAN XTJST HANG.
Taken From Folson to Los Angeles
to Be Besentenced.
SACRAMENTO. March 10. â Deputy
Sheriff H. C. McClure of Los Angeles
County left Folsom this morning with
John Barthelman. uÂ»e murderer, who will
be taken to Los Angeles and resentenced
for tie killing of his wife a little over a
year ago. Barthelman was convicted and
sentenced to be -anged March 11, 1898. An
appeal was taken, resulting in a confir
mation of the judgment of the lower
court which now renders it necessary
for the Judge of the Superior Court of
Los Angeles County to again pronounce
sentence and set a day for the execution.
The Folsom prison officials declare that
Barthelman has been a model prisoner,
and his conduct on aU occasions most ex
emplary.
DESMOND TO BE FREED.
SACRAMENTO, March 10.â Oovernor
Budd to-day commuted the sentence of
John Desmond, sentenced on October 16,
1895, to serve a term of fourteen years for
perjury. The commutation is based on
the recommendation of Dr. I^awler, the
prison physician, who declares that Des
mond is suffering from an incurable dis
ease, and his relatives desire that he
should die outside the prison walls.
WIND AND RAIN
ON THE COAST
Razed Buildings and Gen
eral Havoc in Many
Places.
i
San Jose Reports a Hurricane
That Does Considerable
Damage.
Farther South the Fier ce Gale Is
Accompanied toy a Heavy
Rainfall.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 10.â A severe
windstorm visited this city, this fore
noon and played havoc with church
steeples, old barns and trees. It began
blowing about 4 o'clock this morning
and continued with more or less sever
ity until noon. No one was seriously
injured. The two steeples on the Bap
tist Church were twisted and wrenched
and the thoroughfares in that vicinity
closed The steeple on St. Patrick's
Church was also bent. The wires of
the electric railway became badly tan
gled, and traffic was delayed for awhile.
Tupper & Co.'s large warehouse at
Fourth and VirginiE^streets was razed
to the ground and is one mass of de
bris. It was feared that the roof of
the Hensley House, which has been
raised up to allow a couple of stories
to be added, would be blown to the
streets. As soon as the storm arose
the contractors put men to work lash
ing the heavy roof to the rafters of the
I building, and thus probably saved the
structure from being wrecked. The elec
tric tower swayed considerably, but
stood the storm better than had been
expected. Signs and trees were blown
down all over town and old and dilapi
dated shanties wrecked. The damage
done will reach several thousand dol
lars.
SACRAMENTO, March 10.â James A.
Barwick, Weather Bureau Observer in
this city, said tw-day that the dry
northerly wind now blowing through
this section of the valley will do untold
damage to grain if it lasts any great
length of time. It was blowing this
morning at the rate of from thirty to
thirty-eight miles per hour, reaching at
times a maximum velocity of forty-two
miles per hour, which is the highest ve
locity for a northern wind in March ;
] during the past twenty years. The i
; highest velocity for March on record is i
forty-eight miles per hour, but it was
with a south wind, which rather im
proved the cro-p conditions by its in
! creased amount of moisture, brought
) rapidly inland from the ocean.
ST. HELENA, March 10.â The heavy
I windstorm which prevailed here dur
i ing the past twenty-four hours did con-
I siderable damage. The Odd Fellows'
j and Turner halls were partially un
roofed. The partial demolition of Tur
ner Hall will cause particular inconve
nience because it is alstr used as a
high-school building. In the business
section several large plate-glass win
dows were broken, signs and fences
laid low, and several big chimneys were
also blown down, damaging the dwell
ings of which they were a part.
MILTON, March 10.â Showers, ac
companied by thunder and lightning,
prevailed throughout this section last
night. To-day there was a high north
wind, which, coming scr soon after the
moisture, is doing serious damage to
growing crops. More rain is apparent
ly needed here. â¢
SANTA CRUZ, March 10. â An unusu
ally strong wind blew to-day. The bay
â was very rough. No damage was done
beyond the blowing down of a fence on
the carnival grounds.
BUISUN, March 10.â A strong north
wind began to blow throughout Solano
County last evening, and as night ap
proached it increased in fury. The
hurricane was the most severe one ex
perieced here for many years.
Considerable damage has been reported
from various sections. Several wind
mills and barns were blown down and
considerable damage was done to fences
and trees. Many persons in this city
left their residences and sought shelter
In safer places.
FRESNO, March 10.â A heavy rain
fell here last night, which settles the
question of the wheat crop. Wheat is
in excellent condition and has not ac
tually suffered for want of rain this
season. The rain of last night will tide
It over for ten days or a fortnight. The

| indications are that it will rain here
i again by Saturday, which will put to
rest the cry made about a poor yield
this year. The rain of last night was
general all over the valley. Fruit trees
are beginning to bloom and a frost at
! this time would do considerable dam

frost for Friday night.
SAN DIEGO. March 10.â Light show
ers commenced falling last night at 8
o'clock and continued at intervals
through the night. This morning the
wind veered from southwest to south
east and heavy rains followed at 9:30.
which continued with variable winds.
The storm from 5 o'clock last
nierht to S this morning was 1.90 inches
at Ouyamaca Lake in the mountains,
and still raining. In the city it is much
lighter.
LOS ANGELES. March 10.â Showers
which are general all over Southern
California have been falling since early
last night, and up to 12 o'clock noon to
day .4 of an inch has fallen in this
city. This makes the rainfall for the
season 4.7, which falls 7% inches below
the average. The March average is
2.98. The weather is still threatening
and gentle showers are of frequent oc
currence. The indications are that thp
storm will pass eastward to-night and
the weather to-morrow turn clear and
cold. Deciduous fruit buds are out and
a heavy frost, which is likely, will in
jure them.
SAN BERNARDINO. March 10.â
About half an inch of badly needed
rain fell to-day. Only six inches has
fallen so far this season, while 17 is the
average. The weather continues
threatening.

THE WEATHER.
The conditions which have prevailed over
the State thus far this year were reversed yes
terday. While a drvlng north wind blew over
the northern half there was a rain of .03 to
.43 inchps in the San Joaquin, .10 to .18 along
the southern coast and .50 In Southern Cali
fornia. This confused operators on 'Change,
but the tendency in values of cereals was up
ward and Hay recovered the ground lost two or
three days ago.

THE WOOL TRADE.
PROSPECTS ARE GOOD FOR SOME TIME
YET TO COME.
From the annual Wool circular of Jacob
Wollner the following Is taxen:
"Fall Wool â Frll wools began to arrive
freely in September and found a ready market.
A pood many mountain wools were bought up
in the country at from 9 to 12 cents, or on a
scoured basis, from 40 to 45 cents. The market
whs very lively until about the Ist of Novem
ber, but since then 'VÂ« â  little wool has been
selling, except what local woolen mills have
bought, who are all actively employed on Klon
dike goods, which requires a great deal of
wool as mostly heavy weight goods and blank
ets are made for that trade. All the woolen
mills on the coast are actively employed and
have orders which will keep them busy for
five or six months to come.
"Eastern and European marketsâ ln the
East, with the exception of a week in Decem
ber, the market since the Ist of November last,
lias been very quiet. The sales from January
1 to February 28 show a falling off of an aggre
gate of 4'" per cent of the sales for the same
period last year, although the mills are con
suming twice as much as they did last year for
the same two months. In January and Feb
ruary. 1>:Â»7. the sales amounted to 52.141.700
pounds, this year to 32.459.t80 pounds. It is
accounted for by the fact that the mills are
using the purchases they made in the early
part of last year. The mills are all working
on orders from three to six months ahead, and
at a good profit, even at the prices wool sold
at in October last, when the highest prices
were palfi for wool since May 1. 1593. At pres
ent the Eastern markets are all reported
stronp. with very little selling, but with pros
; >t a lively business in the near future.
Europe :s reported very strong for all fine long
staple wools, with good demand and advanc
ing prit ea.
"Prospects â By personal observation in Eu
rope and in this country, and from reliable
information from the principal wool markets
and manufacturing centers, 1 adduce that the
supply ol wool, especially the fine long staple
grades, is very scarce. That class of wool
will fee wanted In Europe to such an ex
tent that America will not be able to Import
it except at a very great cost.
"In this country the stock of foreign and
domestic wool in the hands of mills and deal
ers was estimated at three hundred million
pounds on January 1. 189 S. Rut with all the
mills runnlnK, as they are now, and using
over twelve million pounds of wool per week,
it cannot lake long to use up the wool. And
â with the diminishing clips in Australia owing
to the drought and the loss of sheep and re
duced production in South America and the
ther- is every prospect that wool will
command a pood market at fair prices, espec
ially the lone staple fine wools.
"There will be more difference in the prices
of long staple and short staple, defective and
free wools, than there has ever been, owing
to the fashion and style of goods wanted.
â With all the vicissitudes that sheep men have
ntend with, wool raising In the United
will be a most profitable business for
â¢ome time to come."

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal

by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on th* Washington coast. . When
the pressure is high In the interior and low
'along thÂ« coast, and. the isobars extend north

but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im- 1
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 10.â To-day's stock mar
ket showed a further contraction in the vol
ume of dealings and an apathetic tone to the
trading, which Indicated the prevailing dispo
sition to refrain from speculative activity un
til conditions become more settled. There Is
continued uneasiness regarding the Cuban situ
ation, which finds its reflection In the large
offerings of securities on any substantial ad
vance. It Is the evident belief also that the
present conditions, so far as they are known,
do not warrant a further violent decline in
prices. There was a strenuous attempt In the
early (tenting* to-day to mark up prices, with
the purpose of pinching small bear traders,
and also for the purpose of realizing at the
higher level. This maneuver, which proved so
successful yesterday and Tuesday. brought
euch abundant offerings that it was soon aban
doned, and the bears retained control of the
field for the rest of the day. A small amount
of arbitrage buying for London account aided
In the early resistance to the decline and the
strength of special stocks tended to the same
end. The unsettled and uneasy tone. on foreign
exchanges, especially the weakness of Spanish
4's In London and Paris, helped materially to
defeat the efforts to advance prices. The con
tinued influx of gold failed to have any effect
in sustaining the market. Neither did it save
the foreign exchange market from falling an
additional fraction. There was a perceptlbly
easler tone In the rates for call money and
Inane at the close were made at IVi per cent.
Lenders are still loath to make time loans.. A
large part of to-day's selling was attributed to
Washington. There Is no doubt that the bears
employed the usual channels for Washington
selling for the sake of effect, and they accom
panied It to-day by the circulation of sensa
tional rumors regarding developments in the
Cuban situation. Because of last week's Wash
ington selling, previous to the publication of
the news of General Lee's requested recall, the
market Is extremely sensitive to any demon
stration from that quarter. To-day's net de
clines are about a point or over all through the
list and effectually wipe out the disturbance
of yesterday and the day before.
Bonds were weak throughout the day in sym
pathy with stocks, the speculative Issues lend

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 10.â The Evening Post's
Tendon financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here remained quiet to-day during
the progress of the settlement. There were
no fresh political scares, but the markets were
weakened by the fears of the settlement to
morrow. Large losses have been made In
Grand Trunk! Americans, mines and Brazils.
The latter concern. Paris as well. Several
iiriiis are In difficulties, but I learn that the
largest will be helped over, and probably one
or wo small failures will be announced.
Americans were lifelessly dull for the rea
sons stated-
Gold Is In strong demand for New York at
77s 16Hd. Eagles will probably leave the
Bank of England to-morrow. Details of the
grold movement for the week show the ship
ment of 215,000 pounds to South America, the
sale of 50,000 pounds in American gold coins,
the receipts of 114,000 pounds from Australia,
and the purchase of 10,000 pounds In French
coins and of 92,000 pounds in Japanese coins.
Spanish and Brazilian stocks were sold
heavily from Parle at the close here.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
I CHICAGO*, March 10.â Dullness as marked as
at any tlma during the holiday seasons marked
j the opening In wheat. There was a. good deal
' of uncertainty regarding , the figures on farm
i reserves in the forthcoming Government crop
' report and traders as a consequence were un
' willing to go deeper either way than they were
I already. This feeling. in I fact, was marked
! throughout the session, and the market at no
time exhibited any real degree of activity. The
start was easier. Liverpool cables were disap
' pointing, showing about %d decline. News from
â  Washington regarding the Spanish complica
tions were also of a more disturbing character
and another big addition to the stocks of con
' tract wheat at Chicago was reported. July
opened at 90%<i?90%c and May %c lower at
$1 04%. For nearly half an nour prices, kept
within a %c radius. Then, helped by an Im
: provement in corn which took place about that
time an.l also by the predictions of freezing
â  weather over the West and Southwest, prices
i Improved a trifle. It was but temporary, how
i ever. Though no â  selling pressure of conse
1 quence developed there was for the rest of the
I session almost an entire absence of buying or
! ders for July, and that delivery slowly but
surely, gravitated toward a lower level. May
\ for some time held fairly firm, traders being
i apparently afraid to sell that delivery, but the |
1 weakness In July finally encouraged them and I
I offerings became free enough to cause a drop
to $1 04. July declined to 90Vs<* and closed at i
; 90VÂ»2?90%c May wound up at $1 01.
j Corn was under the Influence of the Govern
, ment crop report. Wet weather probably af- I
fected early buying a little. May closed â¢%c
: higher. .'."--.â 
There was only a small scalping trade In
oats, ' with prices keeping within %c range.
! The dullness was due. to the Government re
' port. May closed %c lower.

MAY DEPEND
ON PRIMARIES
One Set of Delegates Is
Wanted by Some
Politicians.
Others Desirs That the County
Fight Be Kept Apart From
That of the State.
W. W. Knickerbocker Says He Has
Not Expressed Anything
Official.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 10.
Alameda County politicians having
discovered that the only hope of send
ing a solid delegation to the State Con
vention consists in holding but one pri
mary are now waiting for the Supreme
Court to pass upon the Stratton pri
mary law. By this decision it will be
known whether the county central com
mittee or the Board of Supervisors
shall call the primaries.
Anticipating the defeat of the new
primary law, and in order to be pre
pared for any emergency, those who
â would like but one primary are already
at work on the county committee. It
la apparent that if there be only one
primary and the delegates to the State
Convention be elected at the county
convention, that if either of the guber
natorial candidates can secure a ma
jority, even of one, in the county con
vention, he would be able to secure a
solid delegation to the State Conven
tion. It is clearly the desire of some
of the county office-seekers who are lin
ing up behind Pardee to try and se
cure but one primary, but there is
great opposition to that scheme.
In this connection the following letter
was received here to-day from a mem
ber of the Republican State Central
Committee for this county:
Modesto. Cal., March S, 189 S.
In the Examiner of March C I find the
following statement: "A Bhort time ago
AY. W. Knickerbocker, who is one of the
executive committee of William R. Davis,
issued a statement in the Tribune in
which he advocated one primary election
for the selection of the county ticket and
suggested that the county convention
â¢which selected the county officers should
select the delegates to the State conven
tion and the Congressional convention.
This plan would give the candidate who
controlled the county convention the
privilege of naming all his own delegates
to the State convention as well as nam
ing the county nominees."
I desire to say that 1 have never made
any such statement in the Tribune or
elsewhere. On the contrary. I am per
sonally in favor of two separate conven
tions and that the contest for Governor
end Congressman should be kept entirely
separate from that for county officers.
By so doing I beliieve that we will get
better county officers, the people will be
hetter satisfied, and that the Republican
party in Alameda County will be greatly
Ftrerifirth.-viecl. I wish it distinctly under
stood that I am not speaking for Mr. Da
vis, nor for the executive committee. Re
spectfully,
W. W. KNICKERBOCKER.
The managers of Mr. Davis declare
that they are not attempting to capture
the machinery of the party, and will be
quite willing to abide by the decision in
I the matter of primaries, of either the
" county cc-mmittee or the Board of Su
pervisors. They disavow any desire to
combine with any candidates on the
county ticket, and declare that their
issue is clear-cut and as solely to try
and nominate the Governor. A meet
ing of the executive committee of the
Davis faction was held Saturday night,
and the members declare they are well
pleased with the outlook.
Candidates for county offices are
springing up daily from all over the
county, and combinations are being at
tempted in every direction. Almost as
much politics is being done as though
the election were only a week ahead.
PIONEER WOMAN DEAD.
Starting With the 111-Fated Dormer
Party, She Reached Here
in 1846.
OAKLAND, March 10.â Mrs. Mary E.
Calmes, the widow of the late WtUler
Calmes, died last evening at her resi
dence, 254 Twelfth street, after an ex- i
tended Illness from heart trouble. Her
health broke down a year or so ago. while
caring for two sons who died in this >
city.
Mrs. Calmes was one of # the earliest
woman pioneers in the State, having come
to California In 1848 with her father.
Major Stephen Cooper, who was the lead
er of a party, formerly a part of the â 
Dormer party.
Dr. H. B. Calmes of Portland. Or., ar
rived yesterday in time to be recognized I
by his mother, who had been anxious to â 
grepf him before her death. The other
members of the family are S. O. Calmes,
of the Tribune reportorial staff, Mrs. W. [
D. Wiley of Fresno and Miss C. V. '
Calmes. The deceased was a sister of !
Mrs. Amos Roberts of this city. She was
a native of Missouri, aged 63 years.
A Husband Sues for Support.
OAKLAND, March 10.â The suit of Fred
Klf-upfer Sr. against his wife, which was
given out yesterday as a divorce proceed
ings, was to-day made public and proves
to be a suit for maintenance. The plain
tiff avers that he and the defendant were
married April 10, ISG2. and have lived to
gether ever since. He claims that his
wife owns real estate In Merced County
valued at $3000, a promissory note of $10,
000, cash on hand $10,000, and personal
propert-- valued at $1500. He is 60 years of
age and is unable to support himself and
has no community property. He there
fore asks judgment for support or $o0 per
month and costs of this suit.
Alameda Board of Health Sued.
OAKLAND. March 10.â A suit was filed
this afternon by Antone Gonzalves of
Alameda against the Board of Health,
Health Officer and City Veterinarian of
that city. He alleges that in the fall
of ISM he owned three cows, the milk
from which ho sold, realizing an income
of $45 a month. On November 4 of that
year he claims Dr. Carpenter, at the re
quest of the hoard, "negligently inocu
lated the cows with a certain noxious
drug" as a test for consumption, and af
terward killed two of the cows, each of
which he believes to have been worth
$60. He asks JSOO damages for the loss
of his business and $160 for the cows.
Single Tax Advocate.
OAKLAND, March 10.â George Fowlds
of Auckland, New Zealand, a prominent
single taxer. is in the city en route to
London. Saturday evening he will deliver
an address at Hamilton Hall. This will
be an opportunity for all interested to
learn of the existing Industrial conditions
in New Zealand without cost.
Bench Warrant for a Debtor.
ALAMEDA, March 10.â Recorder St.
Sure ordered a bench warrant issued this
morning for the apprehension of one
Stever. a soapmaker, who had failed to |
obey an order of the court. Some time |
ago A. C Toye obtained a judgment ]
against Stever for $105 50 for house rent, i
which was not satisfied. He was sum
moned to appear and give testimony as to
the whereabouts of his property, but
failed to do so this morning, which was
the date set for his examination. Hence
the Issuance of the warrant.
FIGURES THAT
WERE WRONG
Auditor Snow Refers to
Assessments and
Taxes.
Why Oakland Suffers When
Compared With San
Francisco.
All the County to Be Heard in Re
gard to the Proposed Con
solidation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 10.
Last night's discussion of the city
and county consolidation matter has
led to the expression of general inter
est in the question throughout the :
county. For the first time the eastern
end of the county has been heard from,
and to-day Auditor Snow corrected a
few false impressions that have gone
out.
"If the division line as proposed by
the Board of Trade be accepted," said i
Mr. Snow, "it will leave an assessed j
value on this side of about $75,000,000, ;
and the county which would be on the
other side of the line would start out
with an assessed value of about $15,
000,000. The population of the city and
county of Oakland would be about 95,
000, and of the new county about 35,000.
The legitimate increase of the assess- :
merit of the city and county should be
about two millions a year for ten
years, and there should not be any in
crease over the present expenses. The
increase in value of the new county
should be very fast, as it would nat
urally grow on account of governing it
self.
"A great deal has been said about the
difference of taxation between Oakland
and San Francisco. At present the dif
ference is 42 cents, not'6o cents, as stat
ed last night. This is natural. It does
not show that government is more ex
pensive on this side of the bay, but it
is simply the result of the difference
in size and value of the two places. If
it costs nearly a million a year to run
the Oakland government on an assess
ment of forty-five millions it would net
two millions should Oakland's value in
crease 100 per cent. San Francisco is
assessed for about 350 millions, and its
total rate of $1 70 is really large as
compared with $2 12 in Oakland. I do
not think a consolidated" government
would prove a very great saving until
its assessed value is 100 millions or up
ward. The figures I prepared last week
'' are, I believe, comparatively correct.
There is a great deal of work to be
done before the proposed changes can
â  be brought about, but the subject is an
important one and cannot be too care
fully considered."
The amount of territory that will be
! left out of the consolidation is more
than twelve times the area of the pro
posed city and county, and is very rich
country. It includes the towns of Hay
wards, Niles. Livermore, Sunol, Alva
radp, Newark, Mission San Jose and
the fast-developing district around
Corral Hollow. Niles is about the cen
ter of the county, but there is no doubt
that Livermore will make a hot fight
to be the county seat. One of the most
forcible arguments on behalf of con
solidation in the interior of the county
is that Oakland is at the extreme bor
der, and every one having business in
the courts is compelled to come here,
thus greatly increasing the expense of
litigation. Should a prisoner be ar
rested on a charge of felony at Tesla,
which is forty miles from Oakland, a
prosecuting attorney has to go up from
here to the Justice's Court, and when
the case comes up in the Superior
Court all the witnesses have to travel
to Oakland.
Before the next county conference, a
month hence, there will be much data
both for and against the movement
prepared for debate.
WOODWARD'S BROKER.
Tells of a Chattel Mortgage to the
Grand Jury.
OAKLAND, March 10.â The Grand Jury
continued Its investigation into the water
rate scandal to-day, and Mr. Woodward
was again before it. He was not detained
long, and was followed by Irving C.
Lewis, a money-lender.
Lewis told of loaning money to Wood
ward on his furniture in 1896. The furni
ture was stored in a warehouse, and on
February 19 it was released and the note
redeemed. This was the day after Wood
ward was appointed a Councilman.
A few other witnesses were examined,
but nothing was learned, and the Grand
Jury adjourned until next Tuesday after
Issuing subpenas for several more wit
nesses.
Three Fires in the Wind.
OAKLAND, March 10.â Throe times to
day during the heavy wind the fire de
partment was called out by fire. At 12:30
this morning Special Officer C. T. Hemley
discovered a blaze in the residence of
Michael White. IS2S Grove street. Mr.
White lives alone and was considerably
surprised when awakened by the depart
ment: $200 will pay the damage. About 4
o'clock an alarm was Founded for a fire
in the residence of P. Daly. 511 Twenty
fourth street. The roof was burned off,
despite the excellent work of the firemen.
At 11:20 a. m. the residence of J. R. F.
Webber. 124 Eleventh street, was found
to be burning through the roof. A chem
ical extinguished it after spoiling consid
erable new paint which had just been put
on and tearing a hole In the roof. About
$150 will refit it.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 11, 1898.
SOME HOPE
FOR OAKLAND
Work on the Harbor to
Be Resumed at
Once.
Largest of Ships Will Soon Be
Able to Reach the
Docks.
Bids Opened and Contracts to Be
Awarded as Soon as
Possible.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, \
908 Broadway, March 10.
The bids for the work in Oakland
harbor were opened to-day by Major
W. H. Heuer, United States engineer,
and the bid of the San Francisco
Bridge Company will probably be ac- ;
cepted, it being the lowest.
The specifications called for two kinds
of work, the dredging of the jetty chan
nel and the dredging of the city front. ,
The bids upon these several kinds of !
work was as follows:
Pacific Coast Dredging and Reclama- j
ticm Companyâ Jetty channel, 18 cents
per cubic yard, $108,000; city front, 41
cents per cubic yard, $20,500. Total,
$128,500.
San Francisco Bridge CompanyâJet
ty channel, 13 cents per cubic yard,
$78,000; city front, 41 cents per cubic j
yard, $23,500. Total, $101,500.
W. L. Prather Jr., Oaklandâ Jetty
channel^ 24.74 cents per cubic yard,
$148,440; city front, 24.74 cents per cubic
yard, $12,370. Total, $160,810.
Bowers California Dredging Company j
âJetty channel, 22 2-3 cents per cubic !
yard, $132,400; city front, 58.57 cents per
cubic yard, $19,285. Total, $151,685.
A. C. Hamiltonâ Jetty channel, 18.45
cents per cubic yard, $110,700; city
front, 12 cents per cubic yard, $5000. To- j
tal. $116,700.
Major Heuer will send the bids to
Washington with his recommendation.
The work, when completed, will deep
en Oakland harbor from San Francisco
Bay up to Webster street bridge, and
will increase the depth of the channel
between the jetties to 20 feet. This im
provement will permit vessels that are
now forced to discharge part of their
cargo in San Francisco to come to Oak
land when loaded and bring their entire
cargoes here. The contract provides
that unless $12,000 worth of work is
done monthly the contract may be can
celed.
The value of the improvement to
Oakland may be judged from the fol
lowing extract from a report of a spe
cial committee ol the Board of Trade
filed last night:
"Heretofore many of our people have
looked upon the larger portion of the
estuary as a good place for canoe-rac
ingr, duck-shooting, yacht sailing, etc.,
and failed to appreciate the fact that
it is about to become one of the best
and most desirable commercial harbors
on the Pacific Coast.
"The completion of the contract for
work to the extent of $133,000, nowabou*
to be let, will, within this year, give
twenty feet of water at low tide from
; the mouth of the harbor as far up as
the Webster-street bridge. This is suf
ficient to permit any clipper or steam
ship which enters the Golden Gate to
come in with full cargo.
"Here, in our estimation, lies the
source to which Oakland and Alameda
will look in the near future for their
greatest and most important commer
cial and industrial development."
COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES.
A Tent to Accommodate 2509 People
to Be Erected on the Berke
ley Campus.
BERKELEY, March 10.â The Alumni
Association and the faculty of the Uni
versity of California are making arrange
ments to hold the annual commencement j
exercises this year In an immense tent, to [
be erected temporarily on the college !
campus, instead of In .the gymnasium,
which for the past several years ha 3
proveÃ inadequate to accommodate the
friends of the graduating class.
A conference has been called to make
the necessary arrangements. The repre
sentatives of the Associated Alumni on j
this conference are "W. R. Davis, C. S.
Greene, E. O'Neill, J. Sutton, Dr. L. Van
Orden and Professor W, E. Ritter; Pro
fessors Howison, Setchell and Bradley
represent the faculty.
The big tent, which will be erected on
the Blope of the campus, will seat about
2500 persons. The gymnasium, where the
exercises have heretofore always been

THE FUTURE OF JAPAN.
Professor Mose3 Questions Her Claim
to a Position Among Great
Military Powers.
BERKELEY. March 10.â Professor Ber
nard Moses, who recently returned from a
visit to Japan, In a lecture at the uni-.
versity, gave an interesting account of
recent economic and political changes In
the Mikado's realm. "In spite of a cer
tain tendency toward old ideas," he said,
"in the matter of dress, for example,
there is a stronger tendency toward west
ern ideas. The recent war with China
has had the effect of sweeping away the
old provincial spirit In Japan, and a
broader patriotism has appeared. The
Chinese influence upon Japan has been
greatly weakened, and It is probable that
the tendency toward western thought and
civilization will continue. Economic con
ditions in Japan show a tendency toward
western methods of production, yet there
is no indication that, wages in Japan will
ever rise to what they are in the United
States.
"Still it is difficult to discover just what
Japan relies on to make her a great mili
tary power. Japan at present has a de
ficit, and even with the Chinese indemnity
there is no prospect of her income com
ing up to her expenses. And Japan has
not the industrial resources to be able to
stand a deficit. The Japanese have a
lack of mechanical thoroughness, and
they seem to aim at artistic rather than
mechanical excellence. Japan in the last
few years has experienced, as it were, her
industrial honeymoon. She has not yet
encountered difficulties, and she may
think they do not exist. But with the ex
tension o"f the system of credit, crises
and financial difficulties will show them
selves The effort of Japan to keep a
Dlace in the first rank of civilized nations
reminds one strongly of the sorry history
of Italy since the union, which is the
history of a third-rate power that aspired
to take a position beside great nations."
Berkeley News Notes.

YOUNG MEN'S
ANNIVERSARY
An Interesting Lecture Deliv
ered by Hon. Irving M.
Scott.
He Told the "Story of a Boy"â An
En ertaining Programme
Rendered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 10.
One of the largest audiences ever gath
ered in a church In this city greeted Ir
ving M. Scott, president of the Union
Iron Works of San Francisco, to-night,
when he spoke upon "The Story of a
Boy" at the nineteenth anniversary of
the organization of the Young Men's
Christian Association.
The gathering was assembled in the
First Congregational Church and was
entertained most delightfully by a musi
cal programme of the highest character
in addition to the address. Mr. Scott
told the story of a farmer lad, whom he
pleased to name Hebron Mills, but whom
the majority of his audience believed to
have been Irving M. Scott. He sketched
his early tare, his picking at knowledge
of all kinds on the farm or at play, his
removal to the city, his meeting of rela
tives with smutty face, the keen sting as
the pride of those who looked down upon
labor dawned upon him, of his lonesome
evenings, how he btgan to study, then
sought larger fields, went West, more
study, thence his travels abroad, meet
ing great men of all nations.
This boy then settled down, realizing
he had just begun to learn. He said that
in that boy's day no such organization
as the one whose annivet sary was being
celebrated was known, but it was the re
sult of just such needs as that boy fur
nished himself that caused the organiza
tion of this institution. He closed by say
ing: "Work. Do something. The man
that works for nothing is forming a habit
that is superior to walking around idle."
D. Edward Collins, president of the lo
cal organization, greeted the audience.
He said for nearly nineteen years this
association had been a factor for good in
this city. It was organized with twelve
members and at first had on^ room in the.
Wilson House. In ISBO it moved to Medi
cal Hall and then to Masonic Hall and
to Shattuck and later to the present
building.
A programme of music ended the even
ing's entertainment.
Could Not Agree.
OAKLAND, March 10.-The trial of
John McGinnis, charged with being an
accomplice of James Bryan, in causing
the death of Deputy Constable Cronin
last June, was completed to-night at 5
o'clock and given to the jury. At 11:30
p. m. the jury had failed to agree, and
were locked up for the night. They were
only asked to give a verdict of man
slaughter by the prosecution, and at the
close of the trial they were given ten
minutes by the onlookers to acquit Mc-
Ginnis.
The Teachers' Club.
ALAMEDA, March 10.â The Teachers'
Club, an organization recently formed for
the purpose of securing good lecturers to
address audiences in this city, is meeting
with great success. A large number of
prominent ladies and gentlemen have
joined and an effort is being made to se
cure the best talent now in the field. To
morrow evening Professor Hudson of
Stanford will lecture at the Unitarian
Church on "The Poetry of Tennyson. '"
while other distinguished speakers are
being arranged for.
A Tool riiief.
ALAiÂ»IEDA. March 10.â Some unknown
thief last night visited a house which is
in course of construction on the corner of
Walnut street and Clinton avenue and
stole a lot of carpenter tools. The house
is nearly finished and the windows and
doors are all boarned up. The carpenters
thought their tools would be saio on this
account, but the thief, who must have
known of the practice of leaving the im
plements there, tore the boarding from
one of the windows and stole about all
the tools ho couid conveniently carry.

BERKELEY, March 10â Marshal Lloyd

DEPUTIES MAY
BE REMOVED
Consternation in the Inter
nal Revenue Collect
or's Office.
Far-Reaching Decision by Two
Judges of United States
Courts.
Civil Service Rules Ara Not the Law
of the Land, but Mere Execu
tive Orders.
Civil service employes in the Inter
nal Revenue Department and elsewhere
are much exercised over a circular re
ceived yesterday from the Commission
er of Internal Revenue at Washington
calling attention to a decision just
made by Judge Lurton of the United
States Circuit Court for the middle dis
trict of Tennessee. The decision upsets
all the notions at present held with ref
erence to the tenure of office under
civil service regulations. The decision
says that the civil service act pre
scribes no tenure of office, and does not
deny the power of removal except in
the particular mentioned. Under the
rule promulgated by President Cleve
land November 2, 1896, it was provided
that no person should be dismissed nor
have his official rank changed because
of his political or religious affiliations.
This rule was amended on July 27,
1897, by President McKinley, who added
paragraph 8 in these words:
"No removal shall be made from any
position subject to competitive exam
ination except tor just cause and upon
written charges filed with the head of
the department or other appointing of
ficer, and of which the accused shall
have full notice and an opportunity to
make defense."
The court assents to the statement
that the civil service rules, so far as
they deny the unrestrained power of
removal, are not the law of the land,
but are merely executive orders, de
pendent for their force upon the vigi
lance and earnestness of the chief ex
ecutive in compelling his appointees to
regard and obey regulations volun
tarily imposed by him as a voluntary
regulation by the appointing power of
its otherwise restrained liberty of re
moval. These civil service rules, so far
as they deal with the executive right of
removalâ a right which is but an inci
dent of the power of appointment â are
but expressions of the will of the Presi
dent, and are regulations imposed by
him upon his own action or that of
heads of departments appointed by
him. He can enforce them by requir
ing, obedience to them on penalty of re
moval; but they do not give to the em
ployes within the classified civil serv
ice any such tenure of office as to con
fer upon them a property right in the
office or place.
Judge Kirkpatrick of the United
States Circuit Court of New Jersey has
decided that the power of removal of
Deputy Collectors of Internal Revenue
rests with the appointing power, the
Collector, subjext to such requirements
as to notice as the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue may prescribe, and can
not be reviewed by an appeal to the
courts.
The law expressly says that Collec
tors of Internal Revenue have power
to appoint their deputies and to re
voke said appointments, giving only
such notice of changes as the Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue may require.
It holds such Collectors responsible for '
every act done or neglected to be done
by their deputies; it gives a deputy in :
his particular district all the powers
vested in the Collector himself; and it ;
further provides that in case of disa
bility, absence or death of the Collec- j
tor the deputy senior in service shall |
act as Collector, and of two or more
deputies appointed on the same day the
one residing nearest the Collector at
the time the vacancy occurred shall
discharge the duties of the Collector;
and it further provides that the Secre
tary of the Treasury may designate
any one deputy to act in the absence of
such Collector, and that for the acts
and default of the deputy acting as
Collector remedy shall be had on the
official bond of the Collector as in other
cases.
The law regarding the appointment
of deputies in the customs service is
very different. It authorizes the Collec
tor of Customs, with the approval of
the Secretary of the Treasury, to em
ploy persons as deputies, and provides
that he shall appoint, also with the ap
proval of the Secretary of the Treas
ury one deputy (known as special dep
uty), for whose acts he shall be respon
sible. â,
The Secretary of the Treasury says
in the customs regulations that the
powers and duties vested by law in a
Collector are also by law as fully vest
ed in his special deputy, duly appointed
and discharging the functions of his
principal, and in the event of death,
dHfibilty or absence of a Collector the
special deputy is authorized and re
quired to perform the duties of Col
lector; and should there be no special
deDUty the duties of Collector devolve
upon the Naval Officer or upon the
Purveyor, if there be no Naval Officer;
and if no Surveyor, then upon the Sur
veyor at the nearest port.
The customs regulations further say
that every Collector, Naval Officer and
Surveyor is required by law immedi
ately after hifl entry into office to con
stitute and appoint, to be approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury, a special
deputy, to act in the name and full au
thority of his principal during his ab
scene or disability. The law does not
hold the Collector or the other chief of
ficer of customs responsible for the
acts of his deputies other than the one
Specially designated, whereas it does
hold Collectors of Internal Revenue re
sponsible for acts of all their deput es.
The law authorizes collectors of cus
toms to pmplcy deputies with the ap
proval of the Secretary of the Treasury
whereas it permits collectors of internal
revenue to appoint and remove deputies
without the approval of any one.
On May 31. 1888. the Treasury De
partment" promulgated a synopsis of a
decision by the United States Supreme
Court which court decided that collect
ors of customs are not responsible for
the misfeasances, positive wrongs, neg
ligences or omissions of duty of subor
dinates properly employed in the dis
charge of official duties.
Private information has been received i
from Washington that the law regard- j
ing internal revenue deputies has been ;
read to the President, and he has been j
convinced that such deputies should be
taken out of the civil service rules, and
that he has almost been persuaded that
all deputies under all officials come un
der similar provisions of law, and that
chief efneers are responsible for the j
acts of their deputies, notwithstanding j
the fact that the customs regulations
not only make no provision for any dep
uty (except a special deputy) to dis
charge the duties of the principal, dur-
Ing his absence or disability, but abso
lutely prohibit any deputy, except the
special deputy, from acting in that ca- i
pacity.
Private information has been received
also- that the Washington politicians
are endeavoring to have the President
sinp a new song entitled "All Deputies
Look Alike to Me"; but before he sings
it in public they want him to incorpo
rate a little more to it, so it will in
clude chief clerks and other heads of di
visions in the departments at Washing
ton, the customs service, mints, land
offices, sub-treasuries and all other
offices that the new rule can be made
to apply to, making in all about 5000
positions that can then be bestowed up
on the faithful party leaders without
competitive examinations.
It is further said in advices from
Washington that these intimated modi
fications to the present civil service
rules will be made in the near futureâ
probably during the next few weeks.
ATTEMPTED INCENDIARISM.
Daytime Effort to Set Fire to a House
in Which Men Were Working.
ALAMEDA, March 10.â A peculiarly
bold effort was made .yesterda" to burn
an unoccupied dwelling on Willow street,
between Pacific and Willow avenues. The
house is being re~ aced and some paint
ers were at work. Yesterday the- went
there a.s usual, and left their outerclothes
in a closet on the ground floor while they
went upstairs to ->aint the rooms mere.
When they went for their clothes late in
the afternoon they found that some one
had sneaked into the closet, saturated
the floor and wall with kerosene,
crumpled up a newspaper and soakeu it in
oil. then applied a lighted match to it and
left, alter shutting the closet door care
fully behind him.
This was all mat prevented a fire. The
door fitted tightly and allowed no air to
enter, and as a resuit the fire smoldered
and finally went out. after burning the
wall and floor a little. The painters
heard no one on the lower floor while they
were at work, and the incendiar^ must
have used extraordinary caution in his
movements. There *s no clew as to ms
identity, nor Js there any known reason
why any one should seek to burn the
house.
Alameda News jtfotes.
ALAMEDA, March 10.â Cornelius Foss,
an old-time carpenter and contractor of
this city, will leave for the Klondike on
Saturday. He says all the stories of sick
ness and death on the trails do nor fright-
en him.
The final game of the Recreation Club
whist tournament has been played, leav
ing R. A. Meserole and L. A. Hagy the
winners.
Fred S. Kleupfer Sr. has filed a suit for
divorce against his wife. His son recent
ly obtained a divorce.
There is a balance of JIS99 41 in the re
lief fund of the fire department.
It is now proposed to run electric cars
on the High street and San Jose avenue
lines on twenty-minute instead of ten
minute headway. The travel on those
branches is very light.

THERE CAME A
DAY FOR LOBOS
The Fast Colt Cut Loose
and Played for a
â¢ "Killing."
Spreadeagled His Field, Cover
ing the Four Furlongs
in :47 1-2.
All of the Favorites Bowled Over.
Clawson in F>-ont on Three
Winners.
The two-year-old event at Oakland
track yesterday was the medium of a
grand uncorking. The last time Lobos,
a racy looking son of imp. Goiden Gar
ter and Temblor, started he was a 60 to
1 chance in the betting .and finished
"absolutely." In his race yesterday he
was afflicted with all sorts and varie
ties of speed, and backed down from 15
to 2Vj to 1 skinned out in the lead,
reaching the wire five lengths ahead of
the favorite, E. Come. The winner,
carrying 98 pounds, covered the four
furlongs in :47*6 seconds, within a
quarter of a second of the coast rec
ord. The speedy youngster races in the
colors of Mason & Co., and for his
startling reversal, if such it may be
termed, the stable was ordered sus
pended by the officials in the stand.
Followers <>f the first choices suffered
many reverses, every favorite in the
betting being tumbled over. Clawson
rode in rare good form, piloting three
winners over the line. *
M. J. Daly's Ballister, with Conley
up, carried the coin of the wise ones In
the opening five furlong scramble for
three-year-old maidens. He got away
In front and won all the way, leading
Loumu.it past the stand a length in
1:02*4. Octuruck, the mild favorite,
was unplaced.
Town Topics, ridden by Conley, cut
a wide swath in the betting on
the six furlong selling affair
next decided, but Thorpe on the
15 to 1 chance, Mocorito, upset
all calculations. He raced Abina otf.
her feet with the outsider, and at the
end beat the favorite. Town Topics,
out three lengths. The latter was
away from the post badly or he would
undoubtedly have won.
By Holly's gelding Montallade ruled
favorite in the betting for the mile and
a sixteenth run, decided under selling
conditions. Tod Sloan made his run
too late, and was beaten out handily
by the second choice, Fonsovannah.
with Clawson in the saddle, which colt
made all the running. Flashlight,
backed from 15 down to 7, finished in
the show.
Atkin & Lottridge's colt Gotobed was
plunged on to win the mile selling run,
but, getting away from the post poorly,
was never prominent until nearing the
wire, when he made a good run, finish
ing third. In a long hard drive Spencer
on the 15 to 1 shot Amelia Fonso gained
the verdict by a nose from Lost Girl,
another outsider.
Tod Sloan sat astride the favorite,
Caliente. in the final six and a half fur
long run, and failed to get inside the
money. Fortunate, with Thorpe up,
broke -away in front when the barrier
was released and led to within a few
yards of the wire, when he was over
taken and downed a scant head by Mc-
Light, ridden by Dick Clawson. The
winner went to the post at odds of 5
to 1.

Fair start.

stated to an acquaintance that he left for
home about $12,000 behind the game.
When E. Come, the favorite for the two-year
old event, issued from the paddock he was a
trifle frisky, and while parading before the
stand reared up on his hind legs. Sloan be
came scared and slid from his back. Tod
claimed that the colt'p mouth was sore and he
refused to ride him. Thorpe was proffered and
accepted the mount, finishing second. Sloan
was fined $100 hy the judges and was warned
that hereafter he must ride to his contract or
not at all.

ACCIDENTAL POISONING.
Clarence T. Jones, a Grove-Street
Druggist, Took an Overdose of
Laudanum.
Clarence F. Jones, a druggist residing
at 817 Grove street, came to his death
hist Wednesday evening by accldentally
taking an overdose of laudanum. He had
been sick for some days as the effect of
drinking to excess, and his attending
physician. Dr. L O. Rogers, a relative,
residing in the same house, prescribed
laudanum in certain doses. Jones' mother
gave him the first dose, and when the
time came around for the second dose
Jones helped himself in her absence, but
unfortunately took 100 much. The case
was not reported to the Coroner until
yesterday morning.
The deceased was a native of San Fran
cisco, 36 years old.
Sold for Debt.
The steamer Mount Eden was sold by
auction yesterday in front of the Mer
chants' Exchange by order of the United
States District Court to satisfy the de
mands of the creditors. Mrs. Rosa S.
Barron was the purchaser, and the price
paid was $1730.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 11, 1898.
A HOUSEWIFE'S
READY TONGS
Mrs. Amelia Smallman
Viciously Attacks Her
Landlord.
Warrant Sworn Out for Her
Arrest on the Charge of
Battery.
Mrs. Smallman and Her Husband
Came Into Prominence in the
Courts Eignteeri Years Ago.
J. H. Scott is an owner of property
on Ashbury Heights, and one of hia
houses is occupied by W. H. M. Small
man, a manufacturers' agent. Small
man was in arrears with his rent, and
Wednesday night Scott, accompanied
by his attorney, W. J. Tuska, went out
to the house to see what could be done,
as the lease of the Srnallmans does not
expire until August.
As a result of the visit Scott and Tus
ka called upon Judge Campbell yester
day morning, and Scott swore to a com
plaint charging Mr. Smallman's wife
Amelia with battery.
Scott said he went out to the house
with the most pacific intentions. They
talked over the matter of the arrears
of rent, and the Smallmans got mad.
Words not usually heard in polite so
ciety were used, and finally Scott rose,
and firmly told the Smallmans that un
less they paid the arrears of rent they
would have to get out.
Scott was walking toward the door,
followed by his attorney, when Mrs.
Smallman, who was wild with rage,
seized the tongs from the fireplace and
made a rush at Scott, striking him a
resounding whack on the back with
that homely, but necessary, instrument.
Tuska rushed between Scott and the in
furiated woman, who just then aimed
another blow at Scott, wtiich Tuska re
ceived upon his hand, which he had
thrown up to protect his client. The
force of the blow skinned his knuckles.
Scott and Tuska got out of the house
before any further personal damage
could be inflicted.
Smallman and his wife came into
prominence about eighteen years ago.
They were arrested an a charge of
swindling William Cooper and his wife,
Margery, out of $2000, which had been
given them to invest in stocks in New
York. The case attracted considerable
attention at the time, as the defend
ants were charged with grand larceny
by trick and device. It was the first
case of the kind brought before the
courts in California. The defendants
were convicted by a jury in the Supe
rior Court, and appealed to the Su
preme Court. The higher court con
firmed the judgment of the lower court,
holding that the money was received by
the Smallmans from the Coopers with
the avowed intention to defraud them,
and therefore they were to all intents
and purposes guilty of grand larceny.
They were each sentenced to four years
in San Quentin.
NEW BLOOD WILL
BE INFUSED SOON
Commercial Bodies to Help
in the Alaska Trade
Movement.
A Meeting of Business Men to Put
the Project on Its
Feet.
The State Board of Trade In taking tip
the work of the defunct AlasKa commit
tee has evidently found that it has any
thing but smooth sailing ahead. The ob
ject of the comrrllttee and the aims of
the new management was and Is to show
to the world at large that San Francisco
Is the best outfitting port on the Pacific
Coast for those who are going Into the
Yukon Valley or to any of the gold fields
of Alaska. That such is the case has been
demonstrated by facts and figures. Still
obstacles have been thrown in the way
until the lucal merchants have almost
come to the conclusion that fate is
against them in the way of their getting
a fair share of the trade in Question.
Northern cities have the advantage of
cheap railroad rates from the East, but
they are still obliged to come to San
Francisco for their goods to sell to
patrons who are going north.
The manner in which some of ihe rep
resentatives of the Alaska Trade Com
mittee gave the movement a black eye
by their conduct in the East has also had
its ellect. However, the Board ot Trade
has determined to make the bt?st of ai
fairs as it finds them and carry the pro
ject on to success. To accomplish this
outside influence and supportâ that is,
outside of the board â is necessary. In or
der to carefully survey the situation the
directors of the board met on Wednesday
and decided to ask for the co-operation
of the leading business and commercial
bodies of the cities. To this end the fol
lowing letter was sent out yesterday ami
speedy answers are expected from the
parties to whom they are addressed:
The California State Board of Trade having
assumed the responsibilities of continuing tin.
work originated by the Alaska Trade Commit
tee desires that one person be nominated by
each of the following organizations, to wit.
the San i ranelsco Chamber of Commerce, San
Francisco Hoard or Trade, Merchants' Asso
ciation, Producers' Exchange and the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association, who
shall constitute a ways and means and finance
committee, and whose duty it shall be to se
cure the necessary funds to carry on the work
contemplated originally In organizing the
Alaska Trade Committee, and to pay out of
such funds upon orders and vouchers of this,
board. I am directed to request you to fur
nish the name of some person in compliance
with the foregoing. It is the wish of the State
Hoard of Trade to keep this work entirely dis
tinct from its general work, and the disburse
ment of the funds raised fur this special ob
ject will be made through this proposed com
mittee. We have on hand, turned over by the
Alaska Trade Committee, the sum of ?50(i,
which will be handed to you as soon as your
committee is constituted. We trust you will
appreciate the propriety of this step taken by
our board and will send us the name as re
quested. I remain very respectfully yours,
N. P. CHIPMAN. President.
J. A. FII-CHER. Secretary and Manager.
It is believed that the bodies addressed
will respond as requested as soon as they
can be called together and steps made to
form a lively, rustling committee. The
advantages of the movement are so well
understood that no time will be lost in
useless discussion, but the delegates will
get down to business and devise ways
and means to keep the ball rolling. Ev
ery day information reaches this city of
large parties about to start for the
Klondike and of their intentions to make
the start from San Francisco. To not be
ready for this trade is not business-like
in the least. To-day or to-morrow a ship
load of miners are due here from Aus
tralia, ana more are expected from the
East almost any time.
Exhibition by the Boys' Club.
An Invitation has been extended by the
board of managers of the San Francisco
Boys' Club Association to all those inter
ested in the work of the club to visit the
club house at 8 o'clock this evening to see
what has been accomplished in manual
training since the opening of the present
term. All of the occupations now taught
will be illustrated by boys at work, both
in the house and out in the workshops.
These occupations consist of sloyd
whittling, printing, mechanical drawing,
rope-mat making, chair caning, metal
work, charcoal drawing, shcpplns bags,
basket work, hammock making, drawing,
and brush making There is also a chem
ical laboratory and gymnasium at the
disposal of members of the club. Dunns
the course of the exhibition this evening
there will be a drill by the "DrHl Corps"
of the club.
SCHOOLS IN THE RICHMOND.
Point Lobos Improvement Club En
ters a Protest Against City-
Officials.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club at
its meeting Wednesday niKht spoke in no
uncertain language of the mismanage
ment of the school funds in so far as the
Board of Education has been neglectful
in not providing school accommodation
for the children of that district. It is also
true that a certain amount of blame Is
attached to the Supervisors for not pro
viding sufficient funds out of which
school buildings should be erected for the
housing of all children entitled to a pub
lic education, but it is held by the mem
bers of this club that other seeming ex
travagances in the distribution of the
school funds should in a measure be
stopped when the great necessity is con
fronted of providing buildings for the
hundreds of children now compelled to
roam about the streets of the city, when
by right they should bÂ« attending school.
It was stated by some of the speakers
that there were upward of 200 children in
the Richmond District for whom no school
accommodation was to he had.
This condition of affairs was charac
terized as "a burning shume" to the city
of San Francisco, where taxpayers are
so willing to contribute for the mainten
ance of the public school?, yet the chil
dren for whose benefit tnls money is be
ing collected get the least benefit from
The members of the club did not quite
charge wrongdoing to any of those in
authority, but they hinted very strongly
at bad management somewhere where it
should not be. There are certain streets
the improvement of which could and
should be cut down when such a thing as
education for the children is at stake.
"The cry," as one speaker said, of
giving to every child in the land an edu
cation in the public schools, where the
spirit of patriotism may be instilled into
their young minds, may be all well
enough to read about in Fourth of July
orations, but if the entire country does
ns Ran Francisco is now doing this boast
ed patriotism will soon be a thing of the
past."
The committee appointed at a previous
meeting of the club to "stay with the
question of getting from the Supervisors
at the next annual levy a sufficient ap
propriation to provide acnoolfl for the
Richmond District was urged to use all
the proper means at its disposal for that
end.
There was a good attendance or ladies
present at the meeting, the object of
which was to show how deeply interested
the whole community is in this one ques
tion of having school accommodation
provided for the children.

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.
WHAT'S THAT' _..__*, YOU ARE?
GOING TO BUY A PIANO?
WELL NOW. WHAT DO YOU WANT?
A piano made in 1898, with every dollar ex-
pended on the Instrument, modern in every
respect with all the late attachments, or the
same old piano made from 1849 scales?
I have a piano to sell that I will guarantee
from top to bottom and will back .it with
every dollar I have. As I own my own build-
ing and store, and as the manufacturers also
back this instrument with- $2,000,000. this, I
think, a good guarantee.
The piano is the Klngsbury.
The price is $225.
The address is 526 Hayes St.
The firm is .1. HARRY SCOTT.
ANY person having use for a piano need not
do without when good instruments can . be
purchased from us at cash prices upon
monthly payments of $3. $4, $5, 6. $7, $8. $9,
$10- handsome scarf and wood seat stool in-
cluded ; no charge for cartage. Purchase your
medium and low price pianos where they can
be exchanged for a Steinway without sacri-

TO WREST POOR PEOPLE'S MONEY
FROM A GRASPING MONOPOLY
Suit Brought to Recover a Meter Deposit Illegally Held by
the Gas Company and Retained Without
Consideration to the Owner.
A Small Beginning That May Mean the Release of an Eighth of a
Million of Dollars Belonging to Sixty
Thousand Patrons.
Suit wae filed against the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company yester
day for the sum of $5. As trivial as
this action may seem in itself, the real
amount involved is great enough to
concern even a rich corporation.
The suit directs attention to an im
position from which most householders
of this city have suffered. Those who
have escaped have done so by under
standing their rights artd asserting
them. The gas companies arbitrarily
demand a deposit of $5 from any per
son who wishes to become a customer.
They do this with such assurance that
the fact that there is not the slightest
warrant for it In law nr equity is not
apt to dawn on the applicant. If, how
ever, he is shrewd enough to let the
company know he objects to advanc
ing it a loan, the company will not
Insist. Comparatively few realize the
truth that the company is working a
confidence game, or, realizing it, would
rather submit to the exaction than
combat it. Thus the companies have
piled up a large aggregate of these
driblets to which they have no claim,
and upon which they pay no interest.
Taking the population of the city as
300.000, which is an underestimate, the
ordinary method of computation would
divide these into 60,000 families. Sup
posing that one-half these families uso
pas. another palpable underestimate,
the $5 they have each deposited reaches
to $150,000, a comfortable fortune- now

TO FILL WILDER'S PLACE.
The Man Who Will Take Charge of the Southern
Pacific's Great Western Division.
SUPERINTENDENT JAMES AGLER.
The speculation as to who would be the man to succeed to the super
lntendency of the western division of the Southern Pacific was yesterday
Bet at rest by the following circular issued by General Manager Krutt
schnitt:
"The following appointments are announced to take effect March 20,
1898:
"Mr. James Agler appointed superintendent of the western division,
vice Mr. A. D. Wilder, deceased.
"Mr. John S. Noble appointed superintendent of Jthe Salt Lake division,
vice Mr. James Agler, transferred.
"The office of superintendent of the Shasta division is abolished; that
portion of the line from Dunsmuir to Red Bluff, including Dunsmuir yard,
will form a part of the Sacramento division, Mr. J. B. Wright superintend
ent. That portion of the line from Dunsmuir to Ashland will be added
to lines in Oregon."
The circular is self-explanatory and gives the entire changes resulting
from the death of Mr. Wilder and the promotion of Mr. Agler.
Mr. Agler, the new head of the western division, is one of the ablest and
best-known men in the railroad business, with which he has been connect
ed since 1863, when ho was on the lowa division of the Chicago and North
western.
He remained in that capacity until 1869, when he became a brakeman
on the lowa division of the Rock Island road: from there he went to the
Union Pacific as operator and train dispatcher at Rawlins, Wyoming,
where he remained until '72, when he accepted a position with the Central

the purpose of linding out.

easily forget about it or lose his re

That consumers are oppressed in
other ways does not tend to create any
sympathy for the corporation in the
suit under consideration. That poor
light is furnished, that meters either
do not record fairly or are not fairly
read, that people who protest against
bills they know to be outrageous are
met with the arrogant statement that
they can pay up or have the gas shut
off, are mere incidents to be recalled
now that action has been brought in
resentment of a general injury long
patiently endured.
The statutes in the matter are clear
enough. The law under which the com
panies require a deposit is one of their
own making. They can enforce it only
by Intimidation. Section 629 of the
Civil Code, adopted as long ago as 1872,
covers the matter. It is as follows:
Upon the application in writing of the
owner or occupant of any dwelling or
premises not distant more than 100 feet
from any main of the corporation and
payment by the applicant of all moneys
due from him the corporation must sup
ply gas as required for such building or
premises, and cannot refuse on the
ground of any indebtedness of any for
mer occupant or owner thereof, "unless
the applicant has undertaken to pay the
same, If, for the space of ten days after
such application, the corporation refuses

gas companies. It gives them author- |

to giving up perpetually that
amount of money under pretense
of exacting a security and is
really taking and keeping a
man's money without considera
tion. I think Mr. James will win
his suit because there is no con
sideration whatever for the $5
which he is suing for. They are
giving him absolutely nothing
for the amount. He pays for all
he gets, and if he continued in
definitely to take and pay for
gas, still they keep his money. I

rent of meters or any fittings used in
furnishing the supply. This would seem
to put the companies in a position to
collect anything which might be due.
Indeed it gives them a manifest advan
tage over others engaged in selling that
which the public is forced to buy.
From time to time efforts have been
made to mitigate the extortion prac
ticed by the gas companies, but their
emissaries have gone to Sacramento
and defeated every measure tending to
restrict their absolute sway. On Janu
ary 13, IS9I. Mr. Hamill .introduced in
the Senate a bill providing that any gas
company having In its possession
money deposited as security should re- i
fund it on demand, and in case of re
fusal forfeit to the aggrieved party
?500. This was referred to the Commit
tee on Corporations and never got any
further. On same date the same gentle
man introduced a bill providing that
gas companies on demand must supply
applicants with gas, placing in readi
ness all necessary appliances without
cost to the applicant, and naming a
heavy penalty for violation. This fol
lowed the course of the first measure,
and there was never a chance of voting
on it. A week later duplicates of these
measures were introduced in i^e House,
went to committee and so died.
The present suit was brought by Hen
ry James. "I regretted the necessity,"
he said, when asked concerning it.
"Aside from charging me for easily
double the amount of gas ever con
sumed in my house, the company, by
its representatives, has always treat
ed me with the utmost courtesy. Prob
ably my experience has been similar to
that of others, it occasionally happen

Ex-Senator Tirey L. Ford is
of the opinion that the statutes
enacted governing the powers of
the gas corporations cover the
point upon which the suit of
Henry E. James is based and
that a strict interpretation of
section 629 of the Civil Code
leaves a balance in his favor.
"The language of the statute
cannot be mistaken," said Mr.
Ford last evening. "It was un-
Joubtedly enacted to govern the
powers of the gas corporations
in such cases as the one which
has been carried to the courts
'or adjudication. As to its con
stitutionality I am unable at
present to give an opinion, as I
lave given the matter but little
consideration and am not con
versant with opinions which
iiave been handed down when
his or a similar question was in
volved. On brief consideration
>f the question, however, I am
)f the opinion that the statute
vill stand when it is brought up
n the case soon to be tried. The
:ustom of the gas companies in
lemanding a deposit of $5 car
ies with it a double advantage
o the companies. It insures
hem from all loss that might
esult were the regular course
f business as carried on by bus
ness men and most business
orporations adopted and places
n their coffers that they may
cap the benefit therefrom a vast
urn of money, of the use of

wner is deprived."
I dered at a time inconvenient for Imme

have named the day the account would
be settled, and the company has await

mention it to show that the suit is not
Inspired by personal feeling. A princi

ration which has had for several years
$5 belonging to me. The corporation

No doubt there are many men who are
I perfectly willing and competent to meet
their gas bills to whom the absence of
the $5 loaned indefinitely to the compa
ny is a hardship. I had these- in mind
If the company had returned my mon

"Learning that there is no law re

but ask for it. The official interviewed
refused to comply, was somewhat curt

Gowen & Squires and asked them to
bring suit. The- did not lose any
time. I think there will be a sort of
run on the gas companies if this little
case breaks the grip with which my
fiver is clutched, and it certainly will.
"There's no particular reason why a
corporation which has been presented
with a franchise permitting it to tear
up streets and measure its rotten gas
in a lot of quick consumption meters
should, by a gift from every customer,
be enabled to garner an unearned for
tune in addition to that which it gets
in a legitimate way, supposing, of
course, that its ordinary methods are
legitimate. The patron is at the mercy
of the corporation. It can overcharge
him shamefully, and does so. He has
no recourse. For the gas company
which, in the lapse of a year, absorbs
from each customer for gas he does
not burn more than the $5 he has put
up to make the plea that it needs se
curity is childish. It protects itself as
it goes along, it can always stop sell
ing when the patron defaults and there
is no chance of its losing as much as
it has made the patron lose. Besides,
it does not stand on the footing of the
merchant nor landlord. These pay for
their commodities and rights, and can
not be monopolists, while the most val
uable possession of a gas company is
a free gift which virtually carries with
it the privilege of being a monoply.
It s about time anyhow for the public
to have an accounting of the numerous
Jo pieces the gas people hold in trust."
A. F. Morrison of Morrison, Foerster
& Cope expressed the opinion last
evening that the language of the stat
ute would admit of but one construc
tion, and that construction was in
favor of the consumer and against the
corporation in event it endeavored to
transgress the laws governing its
powers. "Whether or not any subse
quent legislation has diminished the
effect of the statute I am unable to
say," he said last evening, "but if it
has not the language of the statute
cannot be misconstrued."
City and County Attorney H. T. Cres
well â I have never given the statute
regulating gas companies any particu
lar attention, and am not familiar with
its provisions. I should say, though oft
hand that the companies have no right
to demand a deposit from consumers,
and if this deposit is held illegally 1 do
not see why suit cannot be instituted
for its recovery.
Ex-Attorney General A. L. Hartâ
Without looking into the matter
closely but from a casual reading of
the statute I should say that gas com
panies are required to furnish gas to
any applicant upon his performance of
the conditions named in the statute.
The arbitrary demand of a uniform de
posit of $5 from every consumer to be
retained as long as they are patrons
of the company is not one of the condi
tions named and therefore connot be
enforced.
I think, though, the company could
require the payment in advance each
month of a sum approximating the
amount of the bill, any surplus to be
credited to the next month's charge.
In this case, I am inclined to think
that the plaintiff having deposited the
$5 demanded cannot recover it, as it
would be regarded as a voluntary pay
ment. His course, it would seem to
me, would have been to surrender his
meter and after receiving his deposit
and paying all charges for gas that
might be due the company, demand
service again, and proceed according to
the statute to enforce it."
President Crockett, when seen in re
lation to the matter, stated that the
term deposit is a misnomer, the money
exacted from persons using gas being
solely for the purpose of securing the
company from any loss through irre
sponsible parties where it would be
impossible for the mnpany to recover.
When parties are â¢eeommended as be
ing responsible he said no money is
exacted from them.
"The system w s inaugurated by the
advice of S. M. Wilson, our attorney at
that time," Mr. Crockett, "and is
a rule of the company which we con
sider to be only a reasonable protec
tion of our Imprest."
A DAM CASE.
Residents on Taylor Slough Are Very
Much Agitated Over an Al
leged Obstruction.
James McAravy, who was arrested last
evening on a warrant Issued by I'nited
States Court Commissioner Heacock. was
taken before a Justice of the Peace at
Antloch and released on giving bonds in
the sum of JT/iO.
McAravy Is foreman for Wright Bros..
: prominent property owners in Contra
: Coeta County. Above their property is
a dam on Taylor Slough which runs into
; Suisun Bay, and which was constructed
twenty-five years ago for the purpose of
, assisting In the reclamation of the lands
below It. In 1890 Congress passed an act
I making it unlawful to build or to main
, tain any dam In navigable waters. The
j arrest of McAravy Is for violation of this
act.
A few days ago certain unknown per
*ns "lew up the dam with dynamite, and
when McAravy began to repair the dam
age his arrest followed. Property owners
above the dam contend that Taylor
Slough Is navigable: that the dam fa an
obstruction to navigation, and that but
for its presence they would be able to
go to their property in boats. Owners of
property situated below the dam contend
that the removal of the dam would undo
all the work of reclamation that has been
done for many years past, and that their
property would be ruined.

DR. C. H. WESTPHAL INCREASES HIS
BANK ROLL AT THE CITY'S EXPENSE
His Bills Aggregate $500 per Month for Stabling a Few Horses
Belonging to the Central Station Wagon and
the Hospital Ambulance,
His Heavy Demands on the Treasury Likely to Result in an Investigation
by the Grand Jury-Receives Pay for Taking Care of
Captain Wittman's Charger.
There is one man in this city who
has no desire to go to the Klondike.
His name is C. H. Westphal. Mr. West
phal is a veterinary surgeon, doing
business at 121 and 123 City Hall avenue.
According to the bills which he pre
sents to the Board of Supervisors every
month, and which are duly audited, he
has a small Klondike in this city.
For some time past Westphal has en
joyed the friendship of the heads of the
Police Department, and as the result
he has materially added to his bank
account. Not content with allowing
him to draw over $400 a month from
the city for "feeding and caring" for
a few horses attached to the patrol
wagon of the Central station and the
Receiving Hospital ambulance the Po
lice Commissioners some time ago ap
pointed him veterinary surgeon of the
department.
Westphal's bills for the month of
January, according to the records of
the Board of Supervisors, were as fol-
Feeding and caring for the horses at
tached to the Receiving Hospital ambu
lance, $111.
Caring for the horses belonging to the
mounted police, $152.
Stabling and feeding the horses at
tached to the Central Police Station
wagon. $200.
Salary as veterinary surgeon', $100.
Total, $563.
This does not include the frequent
sums Westphal receives for "caring for
stray horses and dogs." Whew a run
away horse is caught by the police it
is at once turned over to Westphal. He
cares for the animal until the owner
appears,, and he is then taxed at the
rate of $1 per day. It matters not
whether the horse has been in the sta
ble only five minutes, the owner Is com
pelled to pay the usual rate.
Just why Westphal should enjoy a
monopoly of the stabling and care of
the horses attached to the Central sta
tion patrol wagon and the Receiving
Hospital ambulance is a source of con
siderable worriment for tlie various
other stable keepers. They openly de
clare that he is a friend of Captain
Wittman, and that he induced ex-Chief
of Police Crowley to appoint him a
member of the department.
Frequently Wittman ant! Westphai
can be seen driving through Golden
Gate Park behind a spirited team.
Whether the city is charged for their
"pleasant drives" the records of the
Supervisors do not state.
Westphal also enjoys the privilege of
purchasing horses for the department.
Whenever a horse attached to the pa
trol wagons roes lame or is pro
nounced unfit to travel over the coble
stones of Market street, he is at once
condemned and Westphal is instructed
to "buy another." After purchasing
an animal he turns the bill over to the
head of the department and it is mark-
Westphal receives additional pay for
taking care of the Chief's horse and
also the one belonging to Captain
Wittman. Just why Wittman should
be allowed a horse at the city's expense
is puzzling the other captains in the
department. Captains Spillane and
Dunleavy manage to cover their re
spective districts without the aid of
horses, and Captain Gillen stables his
charger at his own expense.
Westphal's monthly "draw down"
from the city has caused considerable
comment about the City Hall, and it is
not unlikely that the Grand Jury will
be asked to find out where he gets his
"pull." .
SUICIDE OF
ESTHER WILSON
Young Woman Takes Her Life
as the Result of a
Quarrel.
After Receiving a Scolding She
Takes a ' Dose of Carbolic
Acid.
As the result of a trivial quarrel Esther
Wilson, a young woman 19 years of age.
committed suicide yesterday morning at
her home at 143 Erie street. She had
taken this desperate means as a last re
source to escape the scoldings which her
sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Sully, found neces
sary occasionally to administer to her.
Early yesterday afternoon, after a
heated quarrel between the sisters, Mrs.
Sully left the house and went to her home
at 2314 Seventeenth street, and when she
returned two hours later she discovered
the dead body of Esther lying prostrate
in the doorway leading from the kitchen
to the dining-room and a half-emptied
wine glass of carbolic acid on the kitchen
table.
She notified her brother-in-law, J. W.
Hooker, who did all in his power to re
suscitate the body by administering
arii.aotes to counteract the effects of the
poison, but without avail, as the girl had
been dead fully two hours, and must have
taken the poison soon after her sister left
the house. The glass containing the poison
was fully examined, and the fluid -proved
to be pure carbolic acid. Where the
poison was procured by the unfortunate
girl is a mystery, but it is presumed by
her relatives that she bought it at a
nearoy drugstore.
After fruitless attempts to bring the
girl Dack to ie the deputy Coroner was
sent for, and who at the request of
Hooker allowed the body to remain in the
house instead of conveying it to the
Morgue.
It was lifted from the kitchen where it
had fallen and placed at the suggestion of
Deputy Coroner O'Brien in the girl's for
mer bedroom, where it now lies.
Police Officer Matthew Wilson, the
girl's father, was sent for immediately
after the discovery of the body, but did
not arrive until late in the afternoon.
He is completely prostrated over the
death of his daughter.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Pauline E. Townes has commenced suit
against John F. Townes for divorce on
the ground of desertion.
Emma M. White has applied for a di
vorce from Daniel J. White on the ground
of cruelty.
Laura C. Brott has applied for a divorce
