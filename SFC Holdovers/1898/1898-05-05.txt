NEW YORK, May 4.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: Anticipating
early communication with Commo
dore Dewey, commander-in-chief of
the Asiatic squadron, Secretary Long
sent to Hon^-.-iong to-day a long
cablegram containing instructions
for the future guidance of the Ameri
can naval officer.
This message, it is believed, related
to the plans made by this Government
for the immediate dispatching of
troops to Dewey's assistance should
he deem such action necessary. Ap
preciating that a considerable amount
of the ammunition of the American
vessels has been expended, Secretary
Long has directed that a large quan
tity of shot and powder be sent to
Manila in n steamer which will at
once be chartered by the Government.
Furthermore, the department entered
into arrangements for chartering the
Peking, which will be placed under
the command of n naval officer, and
with surgeons and medical supplies
on board will be sent to Manila,
where the wounded and sick will be
taken on board and transported back
to Mare Island, where they will re
ceive treatment.
It was to inform Commodore Dewey
of these arrangements it is under
stood that the cablegram was pre
pared and sent to Hongkong. At that
point it is expected it will be de
livered to the Consular representa
tive of this Government, who will
hand it to the commanding officer of
dispatch-boat bringing to Hongkong
dispatches from the scene of the late
action.
The department is very anxious to j
iearn the number of troops Commo- :
dore Dewey will need at once, that :
they may be sent to him without de- |
lay.
Information which the authorities
The San Francisco Call
! have received from Admiral F. V.
j McNair, Commodore Dewey's imme
diate predecessor in command of the
Asiatic squadron, shows that he will
be able to secure plenty of coal from
Chinese merchants, or even from
English dealers, who reside at Man
! ila. The department has also re
â  ceived offers, I understand, from
; Singapore merchants, to supply 6000
1 tons of coal to Commodore Dewey's
I squadron. Singapore is a crown col
j ony of Great Britain. Its Governor
has issued a decree of neutrality, but
there is considerable trade between
! the Straits Settlement and English
I merchants in Manila, and an order
'â  placed by the latter will result in the
delivery of coal without objection by
Great Britain. The Manila dealers
will then turn the fuel over to Com
modore Dewey.
Major-General Miles, commanding
! the army, told me to-day that plans
had been practically perfected for the
j formation of a large body of troops,
' which can be sent to Manila as soon
ns Commodore Dewey is heard from.
: According to information at the de
i partment Admiral McNair's plans,
I which were transferred to Commo
j dore Dewey, contemplated the dis
patch of 5000 troops to his aid in the
event that the squadron, while under
his command, took Manilla, but, as the
| Herald stated this morning, the ad
| ministration's plans contemplate the
dispatch of about 10,000 officers and
men to the Philippines.
Considerable apprehension is felt
in naval circles at the probability of
the massacre of Spaniards in Manila
by the insurgents, who, it is be
lieved, aided Commodore Dewey in
the capture of the city. Oppressed as
they have been by the Spaniards, of
ficers with whom I have talked said
they had no doubt as soon as they
had the chance they would attempt
retaliation.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, MAY 5, 1898.
"Commodore Dewey," said one of
i these gentlemen, "will undoubtedly
i request the commanding officers of
j the British, German and French men
j of -war to land marines to protect the
property of their respective citizens.
So far as Manila is concerned I have
j not the slightest doubt it is in the
j possession of the American force.
Manila proper was protected by a
wall erected 300 years ago, and this
I wall was fortified by some antiquated
\ guns. Having placed Cavite under
j his guns, the rest of the workâ l
j mean by this capture of the city
j will be a comparatively easy task
i and without doubt it was success
fully performed by the courageous
American flag officer."
The advice of Senator Perkins was
first sought by the Secretary of War
in considering the matter of charter
ing a troop and supply vessel to be
sent from San Francisco to Manila.
Senator Perkins submitted the fol
lowing list: The Australia, Zealan
dia, Mariposa and Alameda of the
Oceanic line, the City of Peking,
China nnd San Jose of the Pacific Mail
Company, and the Ohio, Indiana and
Pennsylvania of the Bed Star Line.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
and the Oregon Navigation Company
had vessels that might have ans
wered the purpose, but as the City
of Peking was the lowest bidder she
was chartered. The Queen and Sena
tor of the Pacific Coast were not con
sidered, as they are too small for
such service. In chartering the City
of Peking for transformation into a
hospital ship the department was in
fluenced oy its desire to remove the
American wounded from the enervat
ing climate of the Philippines. Sur
geon-General Van Beypen was in
consultation on several occasions to
day with Secretary Long, and orders
were telegraphed to Surgeon W. H.
Bush and Passed Assistant Surgeon
SPANISH SHIPS
VERY CLOSE TO

PHILADELPHIA, May 4.â
Captain White of the Allan
steamship Turin, which arrived
to-day from Glasgow via St.
Johns and Halifax, states that
on Sunday, when off the banks
after sundown, he sighted in thje
distance a warship with a cruiser
ahead, followed by two boats,
thought to be torpedo boats.
Captain White signaled the mys
terious craft, but they made no
reply.

Instructions were sent to the Naval

KDr. Decker was instructed to se
a large quantity of medical sup
plies at Mare Island, which will be

her arrival at Manila will be trans
ferred to the American warships.
Kiere is some talk of sending

Captain O'Neil sent telegraphic in

to ship powder and projectiles to

be placed aboard the freighter which
will be secured by the Government.
CATHOLICS RESENT
UNJUST CRITICISM.
BALTIMORE. May 4.â Catholics here
are indignant at what they rail an ef
fort on the part of the London Daily
Mail to place the Catholics in this
country in a false light. Cardinal Gib
bons said to-night:
"These statements of the Daily Mail
are entirely misleading. I receive the
leading Catholic paper of England, the
Tablet, in which expressions from
bishops and prominent clergy constant
ly appear. Such expressions show gen
eral sympathy with the United States.
The Irish Catholics are almost entirely
in accord with this sentiment, notwith
standing the statements contained in
the Daily Mail as cabled to this coun
try last night.
"Catholics in the I T nited States have
but one sentiment," concluded his Em
inence. "Whatever may have been
their opinions as to the expediency of
the war, now that it is on. they are
united in upholding the Government."
Camp George Dewey Formed.
SIOUX FALLS, S. D.. May 4.â Upon
taking possession of the State troops
to-day Colonel Frost immediately or
dered that the camp should be known
as George Dewey camp. Tents were
struck amid the rain and the camp
moved to a more favorable locality.
Rain has fallen every day for a week
and many of the volunteers have gone
to tH Â» hospital as the result of ex
posure and measles. The mustering in
of the recruits will commence tO-mOr-
THE MARBLEHEAD
CREATES A PANIC
IN A CUBAN TOWN
BOSTON, May 5.â A Washington special to the Post
dated this morning says:
Commodore Dewey's report is in Washington, is a
statement made by a naval officer of high standing, who
claims to have seen the report as it was being transcribed
from cipher into straight English.
It is dated at Manila Sunday night and cabled from
Hongkong.
It is said to show a death loss of about fifty men, with;
twice as many more or less seriously wounded.
The Concord and the Petrel, both of them small gun-,
boats, were badly damaged, particularly in their upper works,
but not so much so but that they can be repaired.
Dewey is said to have asked for a hospital ship, 2000.
men and supplies for three months.
The report, says the officer, does not go into elaborate
details. On the contrary he says that in one respect it re
sembles Grant's famous dispatches from the field, it being
very brief.
Aside from those actually wounded the Commodore re
ports that all of his officers and men suffered more or less
severely from damage to their ears from the fearful concus-.
sion of the big guns, and despite the fact they are believed ]
to have followed the usual practice of protecting the earj
drums with pads of cotton wool.
There is nothing in the report, however, to indicate that
any one was permanently damaged in this way, as was poon
McGiffin in the battle of the Yalu.
Commodore Dewey, in his report, is said to be loud in
his praise of the bravery and coolness of his men, whom hej
is quoted as saying showed as much daring as did the men:
under Farragut in Mobile Bay.
It is believed that the report has occasioned the sending of or
ders to Admiral Kirkland, commanding the Mare Island yard, to send
whatever relief may be necessary at once.
It is believed here Vnat this report is authentic, Secretary Long's,
relations with the Post being of the most intimate character.
CIENFUEGOS IS SHELLED BY A CRUISER.
NEW YORK, May 4.â A special to the press from Key
West says: Cienfuegos has been bombarded. Not only did
the Marblehead silence the batteries of the town on the aft
ernoon of April 29, but shelled the town itself, playing havoc
with the buildings and driving thousands of the inhabitants
to the interior.
The shooting at the forts was at 4000 yards. As soon
as the forts were disabled Captain McCalla ordered that the
5-inch guns be given an elevation to reach 8000 yards.

MOBILIZING WESTERN TROOPS IN SAN FRANCISCO
SIX THOUSAND MEN
TO ASSEMBLE HERE
War Operations on the Pacific to Have a
Base in This Cits, Whence Soldiers
and Munitions Can Readily Be
Sent to the Front.
It is obvious now, in the
light of Commodore Dewey's
superb triumph at Manila, that
San Francisco will at once be
come the base of important
military and naval operations.
Before many days six thousand
armed men will be encamped
on the Presidio reservation.
It transpires that orders were
issued yesterday directing the
Fourteenth United States In
fantry, now stationed in the
Department of the Columbia,
to take station immediately at
San Francisco. It is believed
that further orders will be pro
mulgated to assemble all the
organizations of the Fourth
United States Cavalry at the
Presidio.
Orders were received yester
day from Major General H. C.
Merriam, commanding the De
partments of California and
the Columbia, instructing
Colonel Louis T. Morris, com
manding the post at the Pre
sidio, to select locations for the
encampment of six thousand
volunteer troops from the
States of Oregon, Washington
and California.
Colonel Morris will go over
the available gTound on the
reservation to-day and have all
camp locations properly staked
so that there may be no con
fusion when the troops arrive
upon the ground. So far the
most suitable places pointed
out are located on the more
elevated portions of the reser
vation, to which, however,
water will have to be brought,
either by piping or by water
carts. The fiat on which the
target range is located has also
been suggested as being de
sirable on account of the supply
of water furnished by a flow
ing artesian well conveniently
at hand. About five hundred
men, it is said, can be cared for
on Angel Island.
It is the opinion of Colonel
Morris that some of the men
manning ths batteries of heavy
artillery here will be sent to
Manila to man light batteries
and that their places will be
filled from among the Califor
nia volunteers recently enlisted
and about to be mustered into
the service of the United
States.
General orders from the War Depart
ment received by Colonel Morris indi
cate that Captain James Parker of the
Fourth Cavalry, at present instructor
of cavalry at West Point, has been de
tailed for duty in connection with the
mustering in of the volunteers fur

nished by the State of New York, called
out by the President's proclamation.
Major Edward Field, acting adjutant
general of the Department of Califor
nia, and Captain Carrington, U. S. A.,
mustering officer, exchanged views last
evening concerning the encampment
and equipment of the newly mustered
in volunteers from this State. The
difficulty of supplying the camp of the
volunteers on the Presidio reservation
with water may be overcome by an ex
tension of the pipes of the Spring Val
ley "Water Works. A temporary con
tract for the subsistence of the volun
teers In the armory of the First In
*Â«-ntry was made yesterday. The troops
may go to the reservation next Satur
day.
There was quite a correspondence
over the wires yesterday between
Major-General Merriam and Major
Field respecting the equipment of the
volunteers with rifles of approved pat
tern and the issue of ammunition to
the troops. An inventory of all the
clothing and military supplies availa
ble in the San Francisco depot was
taken.
Major-General Merrlam, accompan
ied by Major Thomas H. Barry, adju
tant-general of the Department of the
Columbia, may leave Vancouver Bar
racks to-day en route to this city. No
doubt the headquarters of the major
general will be transferred to this city,
in view of the important work to be
done here in the way of organizing the
volunteer forces recently called into
the field. It was said at army head
quarters yesterday that the appoint
ment of Merriam to the rank of major
general indicated that there would be
at least three brigades mobilized here,
and consequently there would be com
mands for three brigadier-generals. In
the regular army it is the impression
that the first column for Manila will
consist of regular troops and that the
volunteers will remain here to garrison
the harbor farts.
Three companies of the Fourteenth
United States Infantry are stationed
in Alaska and may remain there until
relieved by volunteers. Seven compan
ies at Vancouver Barracks will doubt
less leave there immediately for the
Presidio of San Francisco. These or
ganizations are: Company B, Captain
Richard T. Yeatman; Company C, Cap
tain William B. Reynolds; Company
D, Captain William W. McCammon;
CVmpany E, Captain Frank Taylor;
Company F, Captain John Murphy;
Company I, Captain John C. F. Tilson,
and Company X, Captain Leon A.
Matile.
Colonel Thomas M. Anderson of the
Fourteenth has been promoted briga
dier-general. Field officers of the
Fourteenth Infantry are: Lieutenant-
Colonel George B. Russell, Major
Charles F. Robe; First Lieutenant
Henry P. McCain, adjutant; First
Lieutenant Charles H. Martin, quar
termaster, and Major John Van R.
Hoff, surgeon.
Lieutenant Boyd, recruiting officer at
the Presidio, received thirty applica
tions for enlistment in the several
branches of the army yesterday. A ma
jority of the applicants are men who
have served in the past and express a
desire to re-enlist in their old regiments
now stationed in the East. Immedi
ately after having passed a medical ex
amination their names will be forward
ed to the War Department at Washing
ton, and upon instructions from the
Secretary of War transportation will oe
furnished and the men forwarded to
the different regiments in which they
desire to serve.
Captain Thomas Maclay, First Lieu
tenant A. H. Cassidy, Second Lieuten

Eight Companies to Be
Taken From the Third
Brigade, N. G. C.
The celerity of movement at headquar
ters of the State troops yesterday was
gratifying. The National Guard machin
ery, now in motion, is working all right.
The Governor has had many anxious
days and nights In getting affairs in
shape. Adjutant-General Barrett was
also delighted with the progress made
BRIGADIER-GENERAL THOMAS M. ANDERSON.
The Man Who Will Lead the California Troops to Aid
Commodore Dewey in Manila.
Brigadier General Thomas M. Anrt^rsnr. who rvom .nnpnintod nr>d
confirmed to that rank from coloi el yesterday, will be placed In com
mand of the troops that are now uMbciiionu â â¢â  vi b^u r luneisiu, axid
it is believed he will lead the forces that will be sent to Manila from this
port to assist Commodore Dewey in preserving order in the Philip
pines.
Brigadier General Anderson is now in Alaska in command of the
United States troops that were sent there last fall to prevent threat
ened riots along the trails that led to the Klondike gold fields. His
headquarters are at Skaguay.
General Anderson is in his sixty-third year. He started in a sol
dier's life as a private during the Civil War with the Ohio Volunteer
Infantry. Before the year was half out he was promoted to. a cap
taincy. He served with distinction during the Civil War and was
breveted for gallant service in the battle of the Wilderness and also in
the battle of Spottsylvania. He was mado lieutenant colonel of the
Ninth Infantry in 1879, and in ISB6 he was placed in command of the
Fourteenth Infantry, with rank of colonel. The headquarters of his
regiment is at present at Vancouver barracks, Wash.
during the last forty-eight hours. Order
and system have been evolved out of
what appeared for several days to be a
mass of confusion. Mustering in of the j
First Volunteer Regiment of Infantry ,
went forward in good style yesterday.
Simultaneously the work at headquarters
in bringing forward the Seventh Infantry
Regiment from Southern California went j
along smoothly. The adjutant-general
conducted the "negotiations for the trans
portation without delay. The troops will
leave Los Angeles and other points to- j
morrow and arrive here Saturday morn- |
ing. The train, consisting of thirty-six
passenger coaches, one Pullman coach and
three freight cars, will be moved over the
road in four sections. The Southern Pa
cific charges the regular price for trans
porting Government troops. The State
bears the expense, but will be reimbursed
for the outlay by the United States.
Governor Budd has now a difficult task
to deal with. Under the call of the Pres
ident he cannot give all the guardsmen
who want to go to the front an opportu
nity to enter the service of the United
States as volunteers from California.
Speaking on this topic yesterday he said:
"I have taken from the Second Brigade
one regiment and pre*<.-rvi-Â«l the regimen
tal organization, t cannot well take any
other troop* from this brigade. I have !
taken the Seventh Infantry Regiment,
Whioh constitutes the First Brigade, thus '
keeping that regiment intact as an organi
zation. The President will not authorize I
me to organize the remaining two battal- !
ions under the call into another regiment
of infantry, therefore I can only order
out eight more companies to be mustered
m as volunteers. It seems fair to take
these companies from the Second and
Sixth Regiments of ,the Third Brigade.
Two companies might be taken from the
Fifth Infantry, the organizations which
are located at San Jose, Oakland, Peta
luraa, Santa Rosa, San Rafael and Ala
meda, but it must be considered that
twelve companies have already been
taken from the brigade to which the Fifth
Infantry belongs. In my Judgment the
Fifth should be kept as a compact regi
mental organization to meet another call
for volunteers, and I believe that Colonel
Fairbanks does not desire that the regi
mental organization should be broken by
r taking from it two companies and leav- !
Ing the others out. I would like to take
a regiment from the Third Brigade and
give all the ortranieations of the San
Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys an op
portunity to enter the United States serv
ice, but under the call I am restricted to
eight companies or two battalions. Two
companies of infantry' may be taken from
Sacramento, two from Stockton, one com
pany from Grass Valley, one company
from Visalia, one from Bakersfield and
one from Fresno. Sacramento will also
supply one battery of heavy artillery "
Concerning the equipment of troops the
Governor said: "The uniforms now in the
possession of the troops will be taken by
the United States at the appraised value
of the clothing and the money received
will be expended in clothing the men re
cruited to fill the vacancies in the Nation
al Guard caused by the transfer of regi
ments from the State to the United States
service. The guard will then be In condi
tion to respond to another call from the
Government."
In exercising his prerogative of com
missioning regimental officers Governor
Budd said that he would commission j
James F. Smith colonel of the First Call- I
fornia Regiment of United States Volun- j
teer Infantry, and that John R. Berry
would be commissioned colonel of the
other infantry regiment of volunteers. It
was further announced that Frank Rice,
U. S. A., retired, would be commissioned !
major to command the four batteries of i
heavy artillery volunteers from this State,
Lieutenant Colonel Geary. N. G. C, re
tired, has been ordered to report to Major
Rice for duty as battalion adjutant of
the artillery.
Yesterday Captain Carrington received
the following telegram from the adjutant
general of the United States army.
"WASHINGTON, May 4, 1898.
"Captain F. de L. Carrington, U. S. A., j
San Francisco: Under the law regiments !
must have not less than ten nor more j
than twelve companies; maximum, 84 offl- 1
cers and men; minimum, 80. Under this
you cannot accept 100 men per company.
"H. C. CORBIN. Adjutant General."
Lieutenant Babbitt, U. S. A., who is in
charge of the ordnance at the Presidio,
has notified the Governor that ho has
been seriously interfered with in his tar
get practice off Fort Point by fishermen,
who will insist on getting within range
of the guns. The firing is in the direction
of One Mile Rock, and a red flag has been
placed upon the rock to warn the fisher
men, but they have paid no attention to
it. A signal of warning has been shown
from Fort Point, and no attention has
been paid to it. The lieutenant does not
intend to give those who Insist upon tres
passing further notice, so that if fisher
men get in range of the guns they will
have to take the consequences.
Mayor Land of Sacramento, accompa
nied by State Senator Doty, Assembly
man Simms and President Lindley of the
Chamber of Commerce, called upon the
Governor at headquarters yesterday as a
delegation to request that the Third
Brigade lie called into service at once.
The Governor promised that the Third
j should be remembered, and that some of
| the companies composing it should be
1 utilized to form the heavy artillery bat
teries that are now being formed.
Judge H. D. Talcott of Oakland, who.

READY FOR
DUTY'S CALL.
Mustering in of the Men
of the First Infantry
Regiment.
The First Infantry Regiment is under
going the transition from State troops to
regulars, and the work is slow and un
interesting and surrounded by none of
the pomp and circumstance of a regiment
going to the front fully organized and
equipped.
It was essentially doctors' day, for upon
the say so of the corps of surgeons before
which the recruits, Btripped naked,
pranced and capered, depended the mili
tary future of the citizen soldiers. Major
McCarthy, Captain Farrel, Captain Reth
ers and Captain Rottanzi were the exam
ining officers, and they spent the hours
from half-past 11 to late at night testing
brawn and sinew and taking physical
measurements.
The order was that the troops be in
readiness for muster at 8 o'clock, and at
that time most of the men were ready,
but there were no scales upon which to
weigh them, and there had been no suit
able place fitted up as an examination
room. Three hours passed before the
necessary instruments were ready, and in
the meantime a nice point of military
regulations was argued and settled. Cap
tain Carrington deiMed that the surgeons
assigned to the regiment should be mus
tered in with the rank of first lieutenant,
for the rules of the army provide that no
surgeon can hold rank above that of first
lieutenant until he shall have served five
years. Captain Carrington maintained
that to muster the surgeons as captains
(and in the case of Dr. McCarthy as a
major) would be to jump them over five
years in a day; but he and Governor Budd
argued the point, and by the time the
scales were ready it was decided to
muster in the surgeons with the rank they
hold in the guard. As the surgeons had
declined to be mustered except under
those conditions, the final decision solved
what might have turned out a vexing
problem.
The surgeons mustered in with the First
I Regiment are: Major McCarthy, Captain
Farrel, Captain Rethers and Captain
O'Brien. Dr. Rottanzi has been on duty
with the Fifth Regiment, and was on the
examining board under detail frum head
quarters.
The first news of importance came to
the headquarters of the regiment in the
Bbape of a telegram from Washington in
forming the mustering officer that each
regiment must have twelve companies,
and each company no more than eighty
four men and officers nor les3 than eighty.
This being settled, it was decided to mus
ter in first four companies, then a major;
then four more companies and another
major, forming two battalions; and then
to muster in a lieutenant-colonel; then to
muster the remaining four companies and
over all, and lust of all, the colonel and
such staff as the regulations will allow
him. As a preliminary, however, and by
direction from "Washington, the regi
mental adjutant. Captain Alfred J. Kel
leher, and the regimental quartermaster.
Captain A. B. C. Dohrmann, were detailed
to duty on the work of muster, and so it
came to pass that those two were the
first ordered to duty as volunteers.
Then the cheery call of the bugle as
sembled the men of Company A, which
was first to pass under the medical eye.
It lined up in the big drill hall over a
hundred strong, and then in squads the
men were sent to the company room,
where they stripped, and then they
entered the presence of the examining
surgeons.
Name and age came first, married or
single, occupation and address, and then
up on the scales to be weighed by one
doctor while another took the man's
height. Some did not even get as far a.s
this, for the little men were spotted at
once, and the lame and halt as well as
the partially blind were weeded out as
soon as their defects were made apparent
by the first general glance which each
surgeon took of his subject. Then the
others were put through a rigid inspec
tion, which included the free use of a
tape line, a stethoscope, the scales and a
table of weights, a card bearing different
sized letters for testing the sight, and a
sprint and a sort of ocean beach horn
pipe to show the activity and suppleness
of each recruit.
In all there were ninety-five to go
through the ordeal, and of these all but
twenty-one were passed by the surgeons
as fitted for an active campaign.
The examination of the first company
was not finished until late in the after
noon and when it was over the company
was assembled in the drill hall and the
names of several were called, the men
stepping to the front when they heard
their names. At first the word went
round that the lucky one 3 were being
separated from those less fortunate, and
the first candidates for the line in front
came up with smiling faces; but soon it
was seen that the ones coming forth
made up the sallow, sickly element of the
ranks, and the truth began to dawn upon
tbe boyg, and they were not surprised
when they were told they were not to
serve the flag.
It came hard to some of them, and
others seemed not to mind it much, but
it was hard enough to bear the mark of
physical ,unfitness, and it was harder still
to hear their comrades in the ranks
cheering and slapping each other on the
back and gleefully planning for the
campaign. There were some good look
ing men in the line of "rejects," and per
haps there were hearts as brave as any
that will ever wear the blue; but it was
announced that in case of constitutional
infirmity the Government would be given
the benefit of the doubt, and it was some
of those "doubts" who were most anxious
to go.
There was some question as to just
what should be done with the men after
they had been mustered in, as the Gover
nment was not quite ready to care for j
them at the Presidio, and so it was de
cided to feed them in the armory in the
evening, let thc-m go home and sleep and
return to a half-past 7 breakfast in the j
armory in the morning. After this break
fast the mustering officer will be in a po
sition to know what can bo done with
them.
The mustering will be done to-day.
There were three long tables laid out
on the armory floor, and the boys sat j
down to an excellent dinner altogether
and all In high spirits, and then they

were allowed to go homeâ for they will
have little enough of home-going if they
get into serious trouble, and the Govern
ment can afford to be lenient for a day
a Aftefcompany A had been disposed of
the imrgeonfl wont through Company B
and then P. and they had nearly finished
Comply E when the work was atoned
for the night. Company B had Â» men
accepted out of 109 examined and Com
pany D had 15 rejected out of 107 exam
ined. Company E had 61 accepted out of
89 examined and there are 50 more on the
roll of the company yet to come.
Eyesight was what wrecked the hopes
of tho greater portion of those rejected.
Other ailments cut but a small l'gure
beside the defective sight, although
weight was a good second. One man was
rejected because he was short half an
inch on chest expansion and another be
cause he was a few pounds over the aver
age weight for his size, although he
weighed over 200 pounds and was a mag
nificent specimen of manhood. He begged
for time to get down to weight by any
process which the doctors might suggest,
but his ph-adings were in vain.
Major McCarthy, the senior surgeon of
the board, said the men as a whole were
a remarkably fine lot; they were first
picked over by their captains and even
after that the board rejected one in
every six.
Lieutenant Cloman, who is assisting
Captain Carrington in the work of mus
tering, says the men selected are as line
a body of militia as can be found any
where in the country.
The officers of the companies have so
far passed only the militia examination,
and tiny will have to pass another be
fore they can go with their commands.

PRAISE FOR
AMERICA'S HERO.
Representative
Meet and Eulogize Com
modore Dewey.
A special meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce was called yesterday afternoon
to take action expressive of the sense of
the people upon the occasion of the first
victory of the war with Spain.' It wa*
a representative body of men that re
sponded to the call, and the spacious
council chamber was crowded when Presi
dent Hugh Craig called for order. Mayor
Phelan, as chief magistrate of the city,
was called to the platform, and Stewart
Menzies was detailed by the chairman to
escort him to a chair beside the president.
Hugh Craig, in explaining the objects of.
the meeting, made a feeling speech eulo
gistic of Commodore Dewey ar.d his com
panions of the Asiatic fleet. He referred
to the splendid achievements of John
Paul Jones and the naval leaders. Perry,
Porter, Hull. LSainbridge, Blakeley, Bur
rows Biddle, Stewart, Warrington and
McDougal, who have made themselves
famous in American history, and declared
that posterity would place the name or
Dewey un the glorious roster.
Horace Davis folowed in glowing words
of pr.iise for the gallant commander in
the Orient, and he was followed by G. W-
McNear, who completed his address by
offering the following resolution:
Whereas, The American navy, in
tne persons of Commodore George
D3wey, his officers and men, has
again signaled itself and notified the
world that the fighting blood of 1778,
1801 and 1812 has not deteriorated
in skill and daring, as proved by the
destruction of the Spanish fleet in
Manila harbor, protected as it was by
forts and modern torpedoes, thus es
tablishing Commodore Dewey as a
naval commander of exceptional mer
it, and fitted to rank with the naval
heroes of the past; therefore, be it
Besolved, That the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco respect

United States to present the congrat
ulations and thanks of this chamber
to Commodore George Dewey in rec
ognition of his prompt and glorious
achievement in destroying the
enemy's fleet at Manila, thereby
keeping open to American commerce
the great Pacific Ocean, with all its
coasts and harbors. \ .
The resolution was carried by a unani

Mayor Phelan then offered tha following
resolution:

dent and Congress be respectfully called to Uia

commercial value of an isthmian canal mate

by Spies. ~
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, May 4.â The Coron- j
er's inquest over the remains of the
powder explosion victims began to
day. No additional facts that could
give a clew to the Identity <>f the three
unidentified men were gleaned. Wit
nesses testified that they had never
seen boys smoking cigarettes at the !
works. Smoking and the carrying of
matches were strictly prohibited.
.Mr. Carter said that although th*
works were guarded it would require a
thousand men to completely guard the ;
plant. Men could gain entrance de
spite the watchfulness of the guards,
who were on duty on the day of the j
explosion. Every precaution was taken ;
to prevent an accident.
J. W. Nelson, a carpenter, who was
among the injured, testified to having j
seen three rough looking men at the j
works before the explosion. They j
were near the plant that was '
destroyed. They looked so sus- '
picious that he called the at- |
tention of M. Noon to them. He was
unable to say if they were Spaniards, j
He did not see them leave. The gun
cotton plant was a place near which
the strangers never went. Nelson said i
he was satisfied mat the plant whs
fired.
Arthur Pejrton explained the process
of making gun-cotton, which will
stand 100 degrees of heat. He could
not give an explanation for the explo
sion, saying that it was a mystery.
The detonation could have been caused
by a rifle or pistol shot. Other wit
i; Bses told of the precautions taken to
prevent accidents. They could not
offer a reason for the explosion.
The inquest will close to-morrow.
COMMODORE DEWEY'S
ORDERS TO HIS MEN.
v *"Keep Perfectly Cool and Pay Atten
tion to Nothing but Orders."
ATCHISON, Kan., May 4.â ln a letter
received here to-day dated Hongkong,
April 3, Louis Ostertag, a sailor on
board Commodore Dewey's flagship the
Olympia, tells his parents of the in
structions given by Commodore Dewey
to his men after the orders had been
â¢ received from Washington to be in
readiness to move at any time. The
commodore assembled his men on the
flagship and told them, in case of an
engagement, to "keep perfectly cool
and pay attention to nothing but or
ders."
The sailor wrote that all the vessels
of the fleet were kept loaded to their
fullest capacity with coal and that a
transport was "loaded with an imense
amount of coal."
to-day while the Herald-Call dispatch
boat was beside the Wilmington.
"I think, captain," said Executive-
Thomas Collins, "that the Spaniards
are at work on a fortification on the
hillside just to the west of the bay."
Glasses were trained and the gunboat
stood in shore. Back from the bay
of Bacuranao on the slope could be seen !
what appeared to be a yellow scimeter
of earth. Apparently the Spaniards
thought the constant patrol of this
part of the coast denoted a landing in
that vicinity and were fortifying.
Through the clear atmosphere perhaps
tweaty men could be seen collected
amund this hillside bank.
"Give them a shrapnel shot from
the aft grun on the port side," said
( 'ommander Todd. "'That may draw
their fire."
The four-im-h gun was trained and
fired. The shell flew true. While the
smoke drifted away from the Wilming
ton in waves the shell exploded right
over the supposed fortifications, and
the men collected around were seen to
scatter. Other gunners stood ready,
the Wilmington being prepared to
bombard the works until they were de
stroyed. But no reply came from the
yellow scimeter of earth. Concluding
that what he had seen was merely a
strung picket which had been thrown
up as small breastworks for protection,
the Wilmington steamed on, but I be
lieve the Spanish soldiers will still be
running when the Herald-Call boat
roaches Key West. Several other sup
posed ff-rtifications have been fired on
fur the purpose of locating the enemy's
batteries, but so far the Wilmington
has not been able to discover that
much fortifying is in progress immedi
ately east of Havana, There have been
no captures and no chases. The fast
Spanish gunboat still remains bottled
up in Havana, and she will not venture
out to give battle even to a torpedo
boat. All are well on all our ships.

Special Dls>r>atch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, May 4.â A Mcx
; ican named Pablo Palasco created a
sensation this morning through his bel
ligerency toward Americans, which he
in no wise attempted to conceal. His
anger finally led to assaults on two
men. The fellow had been noticed the
night before on account of his violent
expressions against Americans and his
"Vivas" for Spain. This morning he
became abusive in front of Scheuer's
meat market on Main street, and the
i proprietor ordered him to move on.
When Soheuer came within reach Pa
: lasco whipped out a butcher knife
eighteen inches long and made a lunge
< at him. The American was unarmed
'and retreated into the shop. Just then
| a dog barked at the Mexican, who
struck at it, explaining: "Gringo perro"
j (American dog). He missed the dog.
Schouer had by this time telephoned
j to police headquarters, and an officer
camp down. The Mexican did not see
; him and was caught from behind, while
; a bystander took his knife away. On
; the way to jail Palasco was particu
larly abusive, reiterating the explana
tion:
"I will kill American pigs."
The policeman noticed that the fel
| low kept fingering at his belt, so he
searched him and found another small
knife, which had slipped out of its own
er's reach in the struggle. Had ihe
fellow obtained the knife without the
officer's knowledge he would surely
have stabbed some one.
On reaching the jail he was turned
into a room in which were another
Mexican and an American. Palasco
now being thoroughly angered, jerk3d
off his coat and sprang at the Ameri
can. Fortunately the other Mexican
sided with the American and the two
finally succeeded in forcing the bellig
erent into a closed cell. A charge cf
assault has been lodged against him
and will be vigorously prosecuted.

GENERAL WEYLER
A NEW BOULANGER
Once More There is Talk of Asking
the Powers to Intervene in the
Interest of Peace.
LONDON, May s.â lt is the
absence of actual news as to the
war operations which is causing
great anxiety, especially at Ma
drid, where Senor Sagasta, in the
course of an interview, has de
clared that absence the "most dis
quieting feature of the situation."
Attention is again riveted upon
Spain. The special dispatches
from Madrid indicate thatthe ques
tion of the future government of
the country is being discussed, as
if the figures of the Queen Regent
and King Alfonso had already dis
appeared from the stage of Span
ish politics.
General Weyler is dubbed "the
Spanish Boulanger," and in some
quarters military dictatorship in
his hands is regarded as probable.
But the wider opinion is that he
will not succeed any better than
Boulanger did.
The continental press notices a
broadening political ambition of
the United States, coupled with
the increasing friendship between
Great Britain and the United
States, with ill-concealed aversion.
Intervention rumors are again in
the air. It is absolutely certain
that Spain has taken no steps in
HE BELIEVES A
MINE DESTROYED
THE MAINE
The Report of Captain Kent, Torpedo
Expert of the British Halifax
Squadron, Has Been Made.
TORONTO, Ontario. May 4. â Almost immediately after the Maine disaster Captain Kent, torpedo expert
for the British Halifax squadron, was hurriedly sent to Washington, whence he proceeded to Key West, Fla. His de
parture caused considerable comment at the time, and the Government was asked a question relative to the trip, but
simply answered that it was a purely departmental affair.
Captain Kent has now returned to Halifax, and from some remarks he has made it evident that, whatever other
business he had in hand, he was making inquiries about the Maine disaster.
He expresses the opinion that the vessel was blown up by external means, and probably by a mine put in posi
tion not long before the explosion took place. He saw Captain Sigsbee and went carefully over the evidence taken
during the inquiry, and this, with his own accurate knowledge of explosives, their effect when exploded in certain
conditions, and the certainty that in such a case as that of the Maine disaster all traces of how the mine or torpedo
was laid would disappear, made it plain to Captain Kent that an external agency had been applied.
Such a thing, he asserts, could be done without the knowledge and against the will of the Spanish officers, so
that his opinion means no reflection whatever on the Governor-General of Cuba.
Captain Kent has made a most elaborate report to the British Admiralty.
THAT SPY ON
THE ST. PAUL
Pretty Good Evidence
That He Meant to
Do Mischief.
Rough Draft of the Interior of
the Auxiliary Cruiser Found
in His Possession.
Howard Hannan, the Culprit's Name,
and. Ho Will Be Put Ashore
ior a Federal Trial.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, May 4.â The re
port that a supposed Spanish spy had
been captured aboard the auxiliary
cruiser St. Paul at Cramp's yard last
night was confirmed to-day. Who the
man is Captain Sigsbee refused to
state, and all that is known of him is
that his father is a Spaniard and that
his mother was born on Cuban soil.
The suspect enlisted some days ago
as an oiler, and almost from the time
of his enlistment was under suspicion
on account of his peculiar actions. Late
last night a marine who was on watch
below decks near the powder magazine
discovered the man acting in a sus
picious way around the magazine.
The marine lost no time in bringing
the man to ground, and a short and se
vere fight followed. The guard over
powered him, but not before the sus
pect had received a great gash on the
right side of his face. _Â_.__
He was taken before Captain Sigsbee
for examination, and the captain com
mitted him to the "brig" for the night.
A thorough investigation is being made
to-day.
The St. Paul is expected to leave
Cramp's to-morrow. Op her way to sea
she will stop at either League Island
navy yard or Fort Mifflin to take on
her ammunition. Her crew is practi
cally complete.
It was learned to-night that the name
this direction, nor is she likely to
do so until she has suffered a re
verse on the Atlantic.
It is believed that there have
been some exchanges of views be
tween the powers on the subject
of the Philippines, as to which all
kin,ds of speculation are afloat.
None of the powers like the idea
of the United States becoming a
near neighbor of Japan and the
fear of further American victories
is likely to give a cohesion in
which the powers hitherto have
been sadly lacking.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph says: "Those
who are best informed as to the
Government's view allege that if
the Spanish arms suffer another
reverse like that at Cavite the
Government would informally re
quest the great powers to tender
their services to arrange the best
possible terms of peace. Many
Liberals consider that Spain, hav

to yield to superior force, but it is
doubtful if the public would ap
prove of this line of action.

MILES IN FAVOR
OF THE CREATION
OF SEVEN CORPS
Plans fop the Subdivision of
the Army Under Consider
ation at Washington.
â¦ WASHINGTON, May 4.â Now that the formation of the volunteer
4- army and the recruiting of the regular army to its full war strength
â f is fairly under way, the President and Secretary Alger are giving some
â f attention to the question of the subdivision into corps, divisions, bri
â¦ gades, etc. Several plans already have been mapped out, but so far, it
+ is said, none have been finally determined upon. The nomination of a
+ number of major and brigadier generals to-day, however, will hasten
â¦ the completion of this work.,
>â¢ The law for the formation of the volunteer army leaves it discre
+ tiona.ry with the President as to whether three or more regiments shall
-â¦â  constitute a brigade, and also whether two- or three divisions shall
+ constitute a corps. Those questions determined upon finally, the as
+ signment of the major and brigadier generals will be fixed readily.
+ General Miles favors the formation of seven corps in all â two In
-f the regular army and five in the volunteer army. In other quarters
â f it has been suggested that the volunteers be divided into three corps.
â¦ A ma jo-r- general commands either a corps or a division, so that the
+ plan determined upon will provide for a sufficient number of these to
+ give assignments to the officers of the higher grades.
+ The volunteer army act also makes provision for a complete staff
â â¦â  for the commanders of corps, divisions and brigades, who are to be
+ appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
V+ â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦
of the suspect is Howard Hannan. He
is about 30 years of age. He claimed
that he was an Austrian and came to
this country in 1881. Hannan also stiid
that he was a painter and had given up
his job to enlist on the St. Paul.
At the examination to-day Hannan
strenuously denied that his intentions
had been hostile to the ship, but not
withstanding his denials, a rough draft
of the interior of the vessel showing
the location of her magazines and en
gines was found in his possession. He
has not been placed in irons, but a
strict watch is maintained over him.
He will be put ashore at League Island
when the St. Paul passes there, prob
ably to-morrow, on her way to sea. The
prisoner will then be dealt with as the
Cuba to the United States, but
could not pay indemnity, because
unable. Well informed politicians
here regard the war as practically
terminated, and that toward the
end of May it will become history.
What will follow, however, it is
difficult to foresee. All the ele
ments of a long civil war in Spain
are unfortunately becoming visi
ble. The Government and the
Liberal party are popularly hated
as. being responsible for the war.
The Republicans possess no dur
able chances of success. The Con
servatives and Carlists are the real
authorities of the future and some
of the Conservative groups are
gravitating toward Carlism. The
economic question, however, will
come to the front first, for hunger
cannot wait."
The Standard says this morning:
" There is a growing impression in
official circles that the Queen Re
gent and the Spanish Government
favor some arrangement that will
lead to the early termination of
the war. It is believed that Aus
tria is anxious to intervene, while
Germany has especial reasons to
desire some arrangement which
will not compromise the future of
the Philippines."
Government authorities jnay deem
proper.
Compelled to Return.
NEW YORK, May 4.â The British
steamer Ardanmohr, Captain Dunn,
which sailed from Guiana, Venezuela,
April 22 for Havana with a cargo of
cattle, arrived in this port to-night,
having been unable to reach her desti
nation, owing to the blockade of ' C
uban ports by the United States war
ships. The ship, when off Matanzas,
on April 27 at 8:30 p. m., was boarded
by a boat's crew from the United States
cruiser Cincinnati and her captain was
told that owin? to the blockade his
vessel could not enter Havana. _ _
URGES AN
INVASION
AT ONCE
Navy Department Anxious
to Reduce the Havana
Batteries.
Before the Slow=Going Fleet of
Spain Arrives Troops Can Be
Landed on the Coast of
Cuba.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 4.
At a 1 ?vÂ« hour to-night the Bureau
of Navigation was in ignorance as to
the whereabouts of the Spanish fleet,
â¢which, according to a press dispatch
dated Lisbon, had Joined that at Cadiz.
It is considered possible that the seven
vessels might have steamed from St.
Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, to Cadiz,
a distance of nearly 1600 miles, in five
days, but this would require an aver
age speed of over twelve knots an
hour. The Navy Department people
are inclined to regard the Lisbon tele
gram with suspicion; at any rate they
are not goingr to rely upon its correct
ness. But should it appear that the
Cape Verde fleet has really sailed for
Cadiz, or is at the Canaries, the Navy
Department will act immediately. It
would take the combined Spanish fleet
with its slow-moving battle-ship Pe
layo and the transports at least twelve
days to cross the Atlantic, and by that
time it is believed the batteries of Ha
vana can be reduced, and a landing of
troops effected at Matanzas, or some
other point in that vicinity.
It is understood that the naval offi
cers are urging that this be done, if it
shall appear that the Spaniards are still
on the other side. Whatever the plan
of the department may be, or whether
they have yet decided upon any ope
rations in Cuban waters, it is their
confident expectation that in a very
short time, perhaps within a few weeks,
Cuba will have been wrested from
Spanish cqntrol.
So certain is the administration that
the island will soon be free that steps
have been taken by the Postoffice De
partment to provide a United States
postal service in Cuba. This took the
form of an order promulgated to-day
by the new Postmaster - General,
Charles Emery Smith, directing that a
mail agency be established "either at
Havana or Matanzas, or at such other
point in Cuba as a United States mail
steamer may be directed to touch."
The order is to take effect when such
steamer shall first land at the desig
nated port. Eben Brewer is appointed
postal agent at an annual â¢ compensa
tion of $2000.
Postmaster-General Smith's audacity
in providing for a United States mail
service in Cuba was admired by Secre
tary Long, who, when shown the or
der to-night, said to The Call corre
spondent: "It may seem like antici
pating events, but the Postmaster-Gen
eral is quite right in taking time by
the forelock, and having everything
ready, so that our soldiers and sailors
when they have landed in r'uba may
have prompt communication by mail
with relatives and friends at home. The
order was made on the assumption that
Havana and Matanzas will soon be cap
tured."
The movements of several vessels of
Captain Sampron's fleet to-day created
the belief that offensive operations
were about to begin either against
Havana or Porto Rico, or else that
pevera l o f the vessels are to be sent im
mediately to the relief of the Oregon
and Marietta. Nothing definite is
known to-night, however, about the or
ders issued to Sampson.
The delay in hearing from Commo
dore Dewey is not exciting any appre
hension at the department, but the re
port is very anxiously awaited. Sec
retary Long said at 10:30 to-night he
hardly expected it before to-morrow.
He hoped it would come and relieve the
suspense. Officers of the Bureau of
Navigation will remain on duty at the
ADVERTISEMENTS. '

The Spanish Gun Vessel Temjorarlo

Port La Plata.
BUENOS ATRES, May 4.â The Her.
aid correspondent in Rio Janeiro, Bra
zil, sends word that the United States
battle-ship Oregon and the gunboat
Marietta sailed from that port this
morning. Both ships have their bunk,
ers well filled with coal and have larg'a
stores of provisions. The cruiser Nic
theroy remained at Rio Janeiro, but
she had steam up in her boilers and it
was expected she would sail before
morning.
Members of the Merchants* Commis

Government a plan to improve the gen
eral business situation. Measures
have been taken by the police in Rio

onstrations against either Spain or the
United States.

SIR JULIAN PAUNCEFOTE
NOT TO RETIRE AT ONCE.
Embassador Certain to Continue at
His Post Until Next September.
NEW YORK, May 4. â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The report
cabled here from London that Sir Ju
lian Pauncefote, British Embassador at
Washington, was to retire at once ia
happily incorrect. Sir Julian will con
tinue in the high post he has filled with
such distinction until next September.
He will then reach the age at which,
under the rules of the service, he and
all others in his position are relieved
from active duty.
Whether when September arrives cir
cumstances are likely to be such as to
make his withdrawal for the interest ol
the British diplomatic service is a
question not to be answered in th<* af
firmative if Washington opposition be
a safeguard. The rule, however, is
supposed to be compulsory. It was re
cently applied to another Embnssador
of highest reputation, I,ord Dufferln,
who quitted the Paris Embassy while
still as competent as ever to fulfill lta
duties.

CONTINENT
There Is a Big Surprise in
Store for the Atlantic
Fleet of Spain.
Rear-Admiral Sampson Has Com
pleted Plans for Meeting and
Defeating the Enemy
on the Seas.
NEW YORK, May 4.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Spain's Atlantic fleet is not to be al
lowed to reach Porto Rico or to ap
proach the coast of the United States.
Rear Admiral Sampson has perfected
plans for meeting the enemy on the
high seas and giving battle at a time
and place of his own choosing. The
successful Issue of this battle may de
pend in a large measure upon the Span
ish admiral being kept in profound ig
norance of the intention of the Ameri-
can commander, and being given the
least possible time in which to escape
or to prepare for battle. Consequent- j
ly the Secretary of the Navy and Rear
Admiral Sampson have kept the details
of the plan of operations a profound
secret and as the time for the move- \
ment against the Spanish ships draws
closer a censorship of telegrams from !
Key West has been established. This
makes it impossible to obtain direct
news of the movement of the armored
ships under the immediate command of
Admiral Sampson. All that is definite
ly known here is that the four most
powerful ships in Rear Admiral Samp
son's command, the New York, the In
diana, the lowa and the Puritan, were |
.ready for a prolonged sea voyage yes- i
terday afternoon. Their coal bunkers j
were filled to their capacity and addi- j
tional supplies of coal were carried in j
bags on deck. Two colliers carrying
8000 tons of coal were ready to accom
pany them to sea. The reports that
these vessels sailed eastward to meet
the Spanish ships last night have not
been confirmed.
At the same time Commodore Schley's j
squadron at Hampton Roads, compris- \
ing the Brooklyn, the Massachusetts j
and the Texas, with two colliers carry- i
ing 6000 tons of coal, is ready to sail at
a moment's notice.
Swift auxiliary cruisers are scouring !
the ocean in search of the Spanish j
fleet These tacts all point to the
theory that there is to be a union of
the armored ships under Rear Admiral
Sampson with those under Commodore !
Schley at a point in the ocean previ- I
ously agreed upon, and that the scouts j
are to report to them there the location
and direction of the Spanish ships. It i
is not believed to be possible that the
Spanish ships will be able to avoid all
of the scouting vessels.
As soon as Kf.-tr Admiral Sampson
learns the whereabouts of the Spanish
fleet and the direction in which it is
sailing:, he can get under way to inter
cept it, throwing his scouts out in front
BO as to cover a wide expanse of sea
and following with his armored vessels
in line of battle and ready to give fight
as soon as they come in contact with
the enemy.

Speaks of the Living and

the World.
Continental Politicians Now
Recognize That America
Will Be a Naval Power.
Possibility of a British Protectorate
the Philippines Gives Europe
Additional Umbrage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 4.â There can be no
doubt that the unexpected success of
the United States at Manila gives little
pleasure to continental politicians, who
recognize that America is now certain
to become a first-class naval power and
will have to be reckoned with in the
world's affairs. The fact that the
American papers are looking kindly
upon the possibility of a British pro
tectorate in the Philippines gives addi
tional umbrage, as indicating a con
vergence of America and England to
ward an entente.
Lord Salisbury's speech before the
Primrose League to-day appeared to
show that he has a presentiment of
the change now working in his vague
prophetic foreboding of coming trouble.
The Premier spoke of the "living and
dying countries of the world," and of
how the former were generally en
croaching upon the latter. He spoke
also of the "corruption of dying coun
tries, a corruption so deep-seated as to
give the smallest scope for reform,"
and he referred to the partition of these
countries as likely to lead nations into
war.
"Dying countries," said Lord Salis
bury, "are mostly unchristian, but I
regret to say, not exclusively so."
The Right Hon. James Bryce, Radical
member of Parliament from South
Aberdeen, writes the Daily Chronicle
this morning as follows: "The war is
a great misfortune and may in the long
run raise grave difficulties for the
United States. All my wishes gc^Kof
course, with the United States, and the
general sympathy with their kindred
across the sea which our people have
spontaneously displayed, and which
was evident from the first, has shown
how close is the tie which unites the
two nations/*
To Send a Stand of Colors.
CAMBRIDGE, May 4.â At one of the
Spanlsh fleet, although the Herald's
special telegram from St. Vincent
showed that the Spaniards steered a
westerly course until darkness fell on
the first night after they left port.
Many naval officers can scarcely con
ceive it to be possible that the Spanish
admiral would be so rash as to bring
his vessels within reach of such an
overwhelming force as that which Rear
Admiral Sampson could bring against
him. They believe that if he has held
his westerly course he counts on bein~
able to reach Porto Rico and get his ;
vessels safely into the harbor of San |
Juan before he can be attacked by an
overwhelming American force. When
he left St. Vincent the American force !
was divided. Rear Admiral Sampson
apparently was fully occupied with the ;
blockade of Cuban ports, and the only j
vessels available to be sent against
him were those under Commodore
Bchley. If he believed he could reach
San Juan in safety he will probably 'â 
discover his mistake when it is too late
for him to escape or to avoid giving \
battle to forces so far superior to his :
own as to leave little doubt as to the
result.
-Some of the officers with whom I
have talked inclined to the opinion that
the Spanish admiral saw the smoke of
the Herald's steamer after he left St.
I Vincent, and, sui...isiri~ that he was
j being followed, sailed a westerly course
â  until dark and then swerved off and
j either returned to Cadiz to form a
junction with the Spanish or to inter
cept the battle-ship Oregon and gun
boat Marietta. If this is his plan naval
officers believe he will be disappointed.
The Oregon had not reached Rio
Janiero when the Spanish admiral left
St. Vincent, and she was generally be
lieved to be much further south than
she really was at that time. Not even
the officials of the Navy Department
had any idea that she would make such
a splendid run from Valparaiso to Rio.
The Oregon is again at sea, accom
panied by the Marietta and the Nich
teroy, which was purchased from the
Brazilian Government. As the Ore
gon's commander is aware of the de
parture of the Spanish fleet he will
maintain a careful watch for hostile
vessels until he is out of danger. It is
believed that he will go much to the
Itward of the usual track in round-
Cape Rogue.
Iven if she should fail to avoid the
mish fleet no one here doubts that
Oregon would give a good account
herself: She and her small com
lions would probably be defeated.
sy might be sunk, but there is no
ibt that the Spanish admiral would
le out of such a contest, unequal
ugh it Avould be, minus at leapt two
or three of his vessels, and that Spain's
naval power in the Atlantic would be
so broken as to make a complete anni
hilation of her fleet a matter of little

pilots that the pilot boats on the south

tion boat off Sandy Hook lightship
shall put into Sandy Hook Bay every
night at dark and remain anchored un

would take possession of the pilots and
compel them to navigate the hostile

Owing to the Government stopping the

exact number of the killed in the riots,
but it is believed the number already

Pennsylvania's Enrollment.
MOUNT GRETNA, Pa., May 4.â The
formal enrollment of the Pennsylvania
militiamen for the volunteer service of
the United States was completed to
day. As near as can be approximated
at present over 90 per cent of the en
tire National Guard of the State volun
teered. In the three brigades 8546 offi
cers and men faced the inspector-gen
eral and Governor Hastings and staff,
and 7779 of these volunteered. The Na
tional Guard was formed upon the field
by regiments and each officer and man
was asked individually whether he
would enlist.
Enlistment of Volunteers.
WASHINGTON, May 4.â The enlist
ments in the volunteer army the first
two days during which this was in
progress amounted only to something
over 700. More than one hundred of
these were officers and the greater part
of them surgeons, which accounts
for the limited number mustered in.
Six hundred privates have so far been
enlisted. With the surgeons qualified
to examine the soldiers, rapid progress
with the regular enlistment work is
looked for.

Guarding Against Spies.
ALBANY, N. V., May 4.â Governor

Croton Aqueduct, so as to prevent any
attempts that might be made by Span

thereby cripple the water supply of

TRANSFER OF
THE ISLANDS
Nothing Known Officially
of Dole's Alleged
Offer.
Minister Hatch Declares That
Hawaii Is Ready to Cast Its
Lot With Uncle Sam.
But It Is Vet to Be Seen Whether the
Offer Would Be Accepted Even
as a "War Measure."
Special DisDatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 4.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent, telegraphs:
Dispatches from Honolulu, published
this afternoon, stating that President
Dole has offered to transfer the Ha
waiian Islands to the United States
have caused considerable speculation
among members of Congress and dip
lomatic correspondents. Up to a late
hour to-night no official confirmation of
the news had been received by the
State Department or Minister Hatch.
When I saw Minister Hatch this even
ing he said:
"I have received no dispatches from
my Government relating to President
Dole's offer to raise the stars and
stripes over Hawaii, but I have no
doubt that the news is true. All of
ficial communications to me come
through the hands of the Hawaiian
Consul-General in San Francisco. They
are enclosed in his mail pouch and are
opened by him and forwarded by tele
graph. Under these circumstances It
is hardly probable that I would receive
any official news before to-morrow, at
the earliest. Although I have no of
ficial information I can say that Pres
ident Dole's reported action is certain-,
ly in line with the policy of my Gov
ernment and goes to show that should
it come to a question of declaring neu
trality or assisting this country in the
war with Spain, Hawaii is willing and
anxious to cast its lot with Uncle
Sam."
Mr. Hatch also said that there was
a large supply of c>Â°i at Honolulu
\vhich could at once be put at the dis
posal of American warships should this
Government accept President Dole's of
fer and annex the islands.
Upon the question concerning the
probable procedure which would follow
the receipt of an offer from the Ha
waiian Government to transfer the isl
ands to the United States, an official
of the State Deparrment said to-night:
"Should the news from Honolulu prove
correct the matter will at once be re
ferred to Congress. The President has
no authority to conclude the treaty or
to accept President Dole's offer with
out the consent of the Senate ana
House. Should the offer come in the
form of a treaty it is hardly probable
that it would pass the Senate, as even
under the present conditions and realiz
ing the necessity of a coaling station
in the Pacific, there is considerable op
position among those Senators who op
posed the action lust fall."
Senator Hawley, chairman of the
Committee on Military Affairs, said
when I saw him to-night that he was
highly in favor of accepting the isl
ands.
"Just at present," said Senator Haw
ley, "I am up to my eyes in military
! matters and have not given much at
j tention to Hawaiian matters, but I can
say that I am in favor of getting Ha
waii any way we can, and should ths
news publishod this afternoon provn
correct and the matter come before tha
Senate, I shrill certainly vote to accept
President Dole's offer. If President
Dole has made a definite offer to trans
fer the islands to the United States as
a war measure the subject when placed
before Congress will require but a ma
jority vote, which is easily attainable."
JOINT RESOLUTION
TO ANNEX HAWAII.
How Representative Newlands Would
Have Uncle Sam Take and Kan
age the Islands.
WASHINGTON, May 4.âRepresenta
tive Newlands of Nevada hnp intro
duced a joint resolution for t he annex
i. of Hawaii. It provides for the
confirmation of the cession by the Ha
waiian requblic of all rights of sover
eignty over the islands, their depen
dencies an -agsion and '-"-ifer to
the United States of all public property
and of its rights and appurtenances,
assuming the Hawaiian public debt to
not exce-d $4,000,000; prohibits further
i- nigration of Chinese and appoints
five commissioners, at least two of
whom shall be r< 'ents of Hawaii, to
recommend necessary legislation.
The resolution declares the islands
and th 'r dependencies "hereby an
nexed as a part of the territory of the
United Statt-s and subject to the bov
erei n dominion thereof."
Special laws are to be enacted
by Congress for the disposition of
public lands and all revenues or
proceeds thfrefrom, except lands
used or occupied for civil military or
naval purposes o f t ne United States,
or local "iiveniiTient use, are to be used
solely for the . enefit of Hawaiian in
habitants for .jucational or other pur
poses. Pending Congressional pro
v' *ion frr the government of the isl
ands, the present Government officers
of Hawaii are to continue under the
direction of the President of the United
States, subject Â»Â« removal by him.
Existing Hawaiian treaties with
other countries are to terminate im
mediate 1 - being replaced by those be
tween the Unite '. States and foreign
nations. Mv cj al legislation of the
islands unless enacted for the fulfill
ment of the treaties extinguished or
contrary to our constitution remain in
force until otherwise determined. Pend
ing legislation extending our customs
laws, the existing customs relations of
the islands remain unchanged. The
assumption of Ã¼blic debt lawfully ex
isting at the date of the passage of the
resolution includ r Â» mounts due to de
positors in the Hawaiian postal sav
ings bank, the Hawaiian Government,
however, continuing to -ay the interest
on the debt while the existing Govern
ment and its commercial relations are
continued. The Chinese exclusion para
graph prohibits the admission of Chi
nese into .he United States from Ha
waii. To carry out the resolution
$100,000 is appropriated.

URGES LOYALTY
TO THE KING
Striking Speech by the
Weylerite Leader at
Madrid.
Says All Classes Should Join
in the Defense of the
Fatherland.
Autonomy for Cuba Decided to Be a
Farce and Erroneous From
the Start
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, May 4.â ln a striking
speech in Parliament to-day Romero
Robledo, leader of the Weylerites, said
Cuban autonomy was a farce, and
called on all classes of Spaniards to de
fend King and fatherland against
Spain's international enemy.
Public attention centered again to
day in the Congress (lower house of
Parliament). There was a repetition
of the great crowds of yesterday, the
police and civil guards, besides the se
cret police, mingling with the people.
The galleries of the house were packed
and many ladies were present. Several
prominent Senators occupied seats be
side Deputies on the floor of the cham
ber.
Senor Reverter, Minister of Finance
in the Canovas Ministry, and the hero
of the excommunication incident last
autumn, defended the memory and pol
icy of Senor Canovas.
Senor Canalejas. editor of El Heraldo,
replying, dwelt upon the "weakness and
vacillatlo nof the Government of Cano
vas, which fostered Yankee boldness."
The principal speech was delivered by
Senor Romero y Robledo, former Min
ister of Justice and leader of the Wey
lerite party, who maintained that
America fostered the Cuban rebellion
and "meant war from the commence
ment." Senor Moret's policy of auton
omy he characterized as a farce and as
absolutely erroneous. As for the Cu
bans, he declared they did not desire
autonomy, and as for the rebels, that
they never intended to accept It.
"The present conflict," he continued,
"proves the real intentions of the Yan
kees. Spain must now face her Inter
national enemy, and she should not
waste a single peseta to give the Cu
bans autonomy, which would be a step
toward independence. It requires the
energy of all classes to defend the King
and the fatherland."
In the course of the debate a formal
promise was made on behalf of the old
Conservatives to support the Govern
ment while the present situation con
tinues.
DEMOCRATS OPPOSE
THE BOND ISSUE.
One Feature of the War Revenue Bill
That Causes Considerable Trouble
in Committee.
WASHINGTON, May 4.â The Senate
Committee on Finance, which was in
session the greater part of the day, de
voted itself principally to a discussion
of the bond provision of the war reve
nue bill.
The Democrats contended that the
feature could and - hould be dispensed
with, while the Republicans held that
a bond issue was necessary to cary an
the war. The Den. -crats will formally
suggest some substitute proposition
within a day or two. Whether their
plan will meet success in committee will
depend upon .he vote of Senator Jones
of Nevada, who holds the balance of
power. The Democrats feel confident
that they will have his vote, but the
Republicans do not concede this. They
say, however, that if the bond provis
ion is stricken out in committee it will
be restored in the Senate, and they ap
peal to the Democrats to allow the bill
to be reported without its elimination
on the grmind that it affords the only
feasible means of raising immediate
funds for the prosecution of the war.
The members of the committee do not
expect to conclude their work before
the end of the week.
PRISONERS TAKEN
TO FORT MPHERSON.
Spanish Captives to Be Held There
Until Exchanged or the War
Ends.
WASHINGTON, May 4.â Secretary
Alger has directed that the ten Span
ish officers and the ten privates and
non-commissioned officers taken from
the Spanish steamer Argonauta, and
now at Key West, be taken to Fort
McPherson, Just outside of Atlanta,
Ga., for confinement until they are
either exchanged for any American of
ficers and soldiers who may be taken
by the Spaniards, or until some other
method for their disposition is reached.
The Spaniards will be placed under the
guard of a detachment of soldiers de
tailed for that purpose.
The civilians taken from the Spanish
steamer Panama are held at Key West
and are under the charge of the De
partment of Justice. It is expected
that most of them will be held as wit
nesses before the prize court which is
to determine the disposition of the
Panama.
GUILTY OF DRUNKENNESS
AND NEGLECT OF DUTY.
Passed Assistant Surgeon Olcott of
the Mohican Disgraced.
WASHINGTON, May 4.â Passed As
sistant Surgeon Frederick W. Olcott,
attached to the United States steam
ship Mohican, at Honolulu, was con
victed by a general courtmartial of
drunkenness, neglect rf duty and viola
tion of naval regulations regarding the
ship's medical journal, and sentenced
to lose six numbers in his grade and be
suspended from duty for one year on
one-half shore duty pay.
Rear Admiral Miller, commanding the
Pacific station, by whom the court
martial was appointed, approved the
sentence of the court, with the remark
that it was inadequate to the offenses
of which the officer had been found
guilty, but that the exigencies of the
service prevented the return of the
record to the court for a revision of the
sentence. The trial of this officer took
place at Honolulu, and several members
of the court were attached to the
cruiser Baltimore when she was ordered
to join Commodore Dewey on the
Asiatic station.
Bernabe to Return Home.
TORONTO, Ont., May 4.â Senor Polo

Senor Anguilo is in constant communi

way of Toronto and the Spanish, lega
tion here, and denies also the statement
that he furnishes the home Government
with information of movements of Am
erican warships and troops.
SAMPSON
GETS NEWS
OF HAVANA
Return of Agent Thrall,
Who Escapes From the
Beleaguered City.
At First the Spaniards Were Panic-
Stricken by the Fleet's Ap
pearance, but Now Think
They Are Safe.
Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL
DISPATCH BOAT SOMERS N.
SMITH, off Havana, via Key West,
May 4.â Admiral Sampson to-day re
ceived detailed news from inside the
beleaguered city of Havana, when at
noon Charles Thrall was transferred
from the Wilmington to the flagship off
the Cuban coast. Thrall, acting as
agent for the United States Govern
ment, went to Havana on the bark
Matanzas the day after General Lee ar
rived in Key West. He was manager
for the electric light works at Regla,
opposite Havana, and long had been
a resident of the Cuban capital^ well
known as an American and cuban'sym
pathizer.
That he escaped and is now safe on
the flagship is due to his Yankee wit.
He was picked up at 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon by the Wilmington at
Bacuranao, seven miles east of Ha
vana. He told Admiral Sampson some
important news relative to changes in
the guns at the Cojimar and Reina bat
teries, which increased their strength
as well as widening the fighting radius
of the guns. I talked at length with
Thrall on the Wilmington this morning
when she lay ten miles east of Havana
and five miles off the coast. He gave
me the first news from Havana and its
anxious people since the Herald-Call
dispatch boat Dewey spoke the English
steamer and obtained news of the situ
ation from Mr. Rolfe, manager of the
dry dock there.
The uneasiness of the people, which
becomes more serious daily, is being
kept below a popular outbreak by the
presence of a large force of troops.
The Spanish say they have 100,000 men,
counting volunteers and those who man
batteries, but Thrall, whom I know well
and whose Judgment is good, says he
believes there are no more than 50,000
in the city available at an hour's no
tice.
"Havana," Thrall said to me when
I congratulated him on his escape, '"is
eager for war. The opinion of the com
mon people there now is that the Amer
icans are afraid to engage the shore
batteries. The truth about the Matan
zas affair is not generally known, and
the papers that would have printed the
REGULARS
AVAILABLE.
Troops Ready to Be Sent
to Assist Dewey If
They Are Needed.
However, If Soldiers Are Dis
patched the Force Will Be
Largely of Volunteers.
Question of Furnishing Arms and
Supplies to Cubans Is Now Being
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 4.
Should it be decided finally by the
President to send troops to assist Com
modore Dewey to hold Manila, the War
Department officials say that the small
number of regular soldiers available
are ready to move. It is thought, how
ever, that if troops are sent they will
be made up largely from the volunteer
forces that already could be concen
trated at San Francisco from various
States west of the Rocky Mountains.
Such regular troops as might be avail
able are several. companies of the Four
teenth Regiment of Infantry, stationed
at Vancouver Barracks (the larger por
tion of this regiment being in Alaska),
the Eighth Cavalry at Fort Meade, S.
D., the Fourth Cavalry, some of which
are at Vancouver Barracks and others
in California, and the Third Artillery,
also located on the coast. It is be
lieved, however, that the officials would
be disinclined to part with the artillery,
as it may be needed for the defense
of the Pacific Coast and they do not
think it likely that cavalry would be
sent, because of the great expense en
tailed in the shipment of the horses
and the lack of transportation facili
ties.
The Senate Committee on Military
Affairs gave some attention to-day to
the Question of furnishing arms and
other supplies to the Cubans. This is
a matter that involves delicate points,
and is giving the committee some con
cern, but the probability is that action
will be taken soon, as no distribution
would be legal unless authorized by
Congress. The bill before the commit
tee authorizes American officers in
eomrmyid to make the distribution pro
posed. A conference with the House
Committee has been arranged on the
bill providing for engineers and yellow
fever immunes to go to Cuba, Ths
Senate conferees will insist on a con-
Bad Pay and Hard Work.
ThÂ« bad pay and hard work of trained
nurses has often been made the subject of be
nevolent remonstrance by eminent medical
men and non-professional philanthropists. It
is well for an invalid, before he gets so bad as
to need a nurse or doctor, to use Hoetetter's

ousness. Use It regularly.
facts, notably La Lucha, have been
closely watched by the censor and per
mitted to publish only such a story of
the bombardment as would give the im
pression the ships were beaten off by
the batteries.
"When the fleet first arrived off Ha
vana the city was panic stricken, and
the people, hurrying hither and thither,
told >ne another with white faces that
the hated Yankees had lined up for ac
tion and shells would be exploding in
the Prado before sunset. The failure to
bombard at once had the effect of re
storing confidence to some extent, and
was accepted as evidence of the whole
some fear of the shore batteries, and
after the squadron had moved up and
down for forty-eight hours without fir
ing a gun the tide of popular feeling be
gan to set strongly for war. When I
left Havana yesterday at noon the city
was sick with suspense due to the men
ace of Sampson's guns and praying for
a finish of some kind. There is no dis
guising the fact that the popular feel
ing in Havana is that Spain will win.
"You ask me what the people are do
ing. If I were to tell you the first
answer to that question which sug
gests itself I should say 'Cursing the
Yankees.' Havana life is one long
vigil. The piers looking seaward are
thronged by thousands, who strain
their eyes to follow the mysterious evo
lutions of our ships in the offing, and
who believe a bombardment is about
to begin every time two of the war
vessels are visible broadside on. Fifty
times a day there are some rumors
about the American ships, that travel
through the city, and the anxious pop
ulation start from their houses to gaze
seaward, only to learn that the bom
bardment is still a menace and not a
fact. They work all day on the bat
teries, and in one instance on the Reina
battery they worked all night."
Mr. Thrall added that, in spite of the
incessant work on the batteries, no
more big high-power modern rifles had
been added, and apparently none would
be, unless Spain succeeded in carrying
eastward those from Cienfuegos. The
work of mounting those will necessar
ily be long and difficult. Many small
guns have bt-en mounted, however,
especially to the westward of Santa
Clara battery, upon Vedado, the idea
being apparently to make every effort
to prepare the city to oppose any land

the total number 16,000, and to leave

TO BE CAPTURED
OFF BARBADOES
Several of Sampson's Vessels Are
Sent to Take the Trans
port Ship Alfonso XIII.
NEW YORK, May 4.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Spain's transport ship, the Alfonso XIII, conveying to Havana 1100 sol
diers, a large quantity of supplies and nearly a half-million dollars,
will soon be a prize of United States men-of-war. This is the con
fident prediction of officials of the Navy Department, and is based upon
instructions given to-day to Rear-Admiral Sampson, commander-in
chief of the North Atlantic squadron, informing him of the arrival of
the enemy's transport at Barbadoes and directing him to take imme
diate steps to effect her capture.
In pursuance of these instructions, it is believed, Rear-Admiral
Sampson has dispatched several vessels to Barbadoes to lie outside the
three-mile limit and await the departure of the Spanish steamer. The
British Government, whose flag flies over Barbadoes, will limit the
length of stay of the Alfonso XIII in the harbor to forty-eight hours,
it is expected, by which time American men-of-war will be cruising
in the vicinity of those islands.
Besides communicating with Rear-Admiral Sampson in regard to
the capture of the Alfonso XIII, instructions were given to the Amer
ican Consul in Barbadoes to report to the Department of State the
time of the departure of the Spanish vessel, and it is expected that he
wUI make every effort to obtain information as to whither she is
bound.
In naval circles it is believed the AlfoMso XIII has gone Into Bar
badoes for coal. Great Britain will permit the vessel to take on board
sufficient coal to enable her to reach her nearest home port, which, in
this case, is San Juan, Porto Rico.
The Alfonso XIII is an auxiliary cruiser and Is armed with five
6-inch Honoria guns. Naval officers say, however, they have no doubt
that, when under the guns of an American protected cruiser, she un
doubtedly could be made to surrender without much difficulty.

WARLIKE MOOD
Sewell Would Seod Troops to
Cuba at Or)ce and Destroy
Spaio's Navy In)n)ediately.
NEW YORK, May 4.â The Washington correspor '.ent of the Herald
says: In electing his major-generals of volunteers President McKin
ley has taken one i xn from each house of Congress. Senator V'illiam
J. Sewell of New Jersey was a gallant officer of volunteers on the
Northern side during the Civil War. Representative Joseph Wheeler
of Alabama, -who resigned from the regular army to enter tho Confed
erate service, became a distinguished cavalry leader of the South. Both
are now ready to fight for the reunited countr- in any position to
which th<-y may be assigned.
"I think the way t end the war and end it speedily,' General
Sewell said to me, "is to send at once some 15,000 or 20,000 troops to
Cuba. They could be landed and could carry arms for the insurgents.
They could be protected by the ships until they had fortified their
base of operations; then I am certain they would be able to, protect
themselves with the assistance of insurgents from Spanish assaults. I
think the troops ought to go at once because a month from new the
health conditions will be more serious than they r_re at present, but if
our troops should be entrenched unon a hill there would be little danger
from yellow fever. If they were sent immediate^ also they would
have time to become acclimated."
"Would ou have 10.000 immunes and 5000 regulars?" I asked.
"No," was the positive reply. "I would have them all regulars. The
Immunes cannot be mustered In, organized, clothed and equipped for
some time. They are in no way available for the present service,
and it is immediate action that in my judgment Is required. The regu
lars are ready to move at a moment's notice."
"And Adr. fral Sampson's fleet?"
"The fleet could go out and meet the Spanish squadron. The de
struction of Spain's navy Is absolutely necessary. We ought to wipe
her flag off the seas. After that peace will be in sight."
General Wheeler was very busy to-day accepting congratulations
of his Congressional and other friends upon his appointment to be/
major-general of volunteers. When he entered the room of the Com
mittee on Ways and Means, which committee was in session this morn
ing, he was greeted with hearty applause.
"Are you all ready to go to the Philippines, general?" asked Chair
man Dingley.
"Yes," replied General Wheeler, "but I would much rather go to
Cuba. I could get there quicker."

Being on tho Flagship Olympia tht?
Consul May Soon Send Informa
tion to State Department.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House.
Washington, May 4.
The understands .. at the State De
partment is that CYusul Oscar F. Wil
liams, our representative at Manila
until the recent war be^an. is now
aboard the flagship Olympia in Manila
harbor, having accompanied Dewey
from Hongkong, so that advices may
come from him to the State Depart
ment as well as from Commodore
Dewey to the Navy Department.
A mail report from Consul Williams
reached the State Department recently
under the date of Manila; February 28
last. It gives a full description of the
Philippine Islands, their resources,
growth of American trade, etc., and
will be incorporated > the next volume
issued by the bureau of statistics of
the State Department.
In this report Mr. Williams states
that twenty-two consulates, represent-,
ing the leading commercial countries
of the world, are established at Manila.
He adds the surprising statement,
"The volume of the export trade com
ing under my official supervision
equals that of my twenty-one consular
colleagues combined." He the- shows
In detail how the trade of the Philip
pines with the United States exceeds
that of all other countries combined
and Is growing at a rapid rate. as
indicating the extent of this trade he
says:
"To-day I have authenticated In
voices for export to the United States
amounting to $138,065." He says the
exports of this country a- erage $1,000,
000 a month. The report states that
Â£16,000 bales -of hemp were exported
during the last three months. Of
these 138,782 went to the United States
and 77,000 to Great Britain and other
countries. Mr. Williams shows from
this that the United States " d 64 per
cent of the trade from the Philippines
as against 36 per cent for Great Britain
and other countries. He said that last
year the increase of shipments to the
United States was 133.000 bales and the
decrease of Great Britain 22,000 bales.
He adds: "Of the increase of ship
ments from the Philippines those to the
United States were 54 er cent greater
than to all other countries combined."
He also gives details of the large
shipmenjs of sugar, cigc:-s. tobacco,
hides, shells, indisro and coffee. In the
item of sugar, which is second In im
portance, the Fb ->ments to the United
States were 55 pl?r cent of the total to
all points. ___________^

GIBRALTAR, May 4.â 1 drew atten
tion two days ago to the anti-English
sentiment shown in Spain. The British
yacht Lady of Clemiel, owner Mr. Wilk
inson, arrived here this morning, hav
ing received outrageous treatment in
the harbor of Malaga, the same place
whence Mr. Batleman, United States
Consul, wrote a few weeks ago to Gen
eral "Wood ford in Madrid: "I am writ
ing to you in my private house, be
cause there is too much ventilation in
the Consular office." The reason was
that the people had broken all the win
dows of the Consulate.
When I stepped aboard the yacht the
first thing I noticed was a lot of stones,
such as are used in mending roads,
and bits of tiles, lying on the after
deck. The plate glass window in the
captain's deck cabin was smashed,
leaving a big round hole, through
which a stone had been hurled. There
were also innumerable indentations in
the deck and wood work aft, showing
the force with which the stones were
hurled. Here is an account of the inci
dent as related by one aboard:
'â¢It was half-past 10 last evening
when nearly every one turned in. We
had not intended leaving port till early
this morning, when we heard a great
noise on the wharf to which we were
fastened with a line, having an anchor
out forward. Then came a volley of
stones rattling on the deck. The engin
eer, coming to the head of the Btern
companion way, was wounded on the
hand by a stone, and in less than no
time the crowd, which must have num
bered some 200, cut the stern line. â¢
"We rang the bell and sounded the
siren in the hope of attracting the at
tention of the authorities, but no one
came. Seeing no help for us, we
steamed straight out of port. The
crowd then made its way to an English
merchantman, one of the Wilson line,
I think, and began to attack it.
"It is impossible that we could have
been mistaken for Americans, because
we had both the ensign an-i burgee fly
ing. We had done absolutely nothing
which could have given offense to the
people."
Mr. Wilkinson was highly Indignant
at the insult and made complaint in the
proper quarter.

BLANCO IS ON
THE POINT OF
LEAVING HAVANA
Begins to Realize That the Span
iards Cannot Hold the City
Against the Americans.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, May 4.â The Spanish mall found on the captured
steamer Argonauta has, after Inspection by the military authorities,
been forwarded to Washington. Captain-General Blanco is in desper
ate straits. He Is already thinking of abandoning Havana and the
entire eastern part of Cuba, apparently realizing that it will soon be
come untenable. When he appears on the streets Blanco wears his
most brilliant uniform and maintains a bold front, but he knows the
ground is crumbling beneath his feet.
The rich people In Havana are leaving the city whenever they can,
but they are compelled to pay a heavy indemnity for the privilege.
This preference makes the common people angry and riots are sup
pressed with difficulty.
One captured letter from a high official in the autonomist Gov
ernment says the ports of Matanzas and Cardenas have been closed
and mined.
Governor Vasello of Puerto Principe province is constructing has
tily a telegraph line between Havana and Puerto Principe, to be used
for military purposes.
General Marcos Garcia of Santa Clara and the Cuban traitor,
Masso Pana, are organizing guerrilla bands to be utilized against the
United States troops. These bands are to be recruited from the pris
ons of Havana. General Blanco is pardoning all offenders who will
enlist in this semi-barbaric warfare.
The insurgents are unusually active. Last week they attacked the
town of Alfonso, drove in the Spanish garrison and burned several
houses. All the stores In the town were sacked and their contents
carried into the mountains.

in the last eighteen months for war
purposes, by giving S7OOU to the Red
Cross institution and the remainder for
provisions for the army.
The sugar crop was finished In Ma
tanzas provinces on . oril 28. Three
hundred and eighty-eight bags and
forty-eight hogsheads were received in
Matanzas to-day, the total re
ceived being 503.460 bags. In Cardenas
658 bags were received on April 27 and
128 bags on April 28, and thirty-five
bags were received on the following
day. Up to date the total amount re
ceived in the latter city is 500,351 bags.
El Diario de la Marina this morning
printed abstracts from articles pub
lished in El Pais. subscribed by L. V.
Abad, about annexation to the United
States of the islands of Hawaii, be-
cause the newspaper understands this
case is analogous to the process that
Americans will prosecute with Cuban
affairs in order to snatch this island
from Spain. VA Diario de la Marina
states that since Captain Cook found
the islands in a savage condition Eng
land made her humanitarian and civil
ized influence felt without trying to
take possession of them, by placing the
islands in condition to keep their inde
pendence by means of liberal instruc
tions, with all advantages of self-gov
ernment. The American colony, on the
other hand, since the moment that
trade in those islands was established,
did not cease working to take posses
sion of them. The United States wants
the islands for their ships touching
there as a coaling station.

CALIFORNIAN
TO COMMAND
A BRIGADE
Maoy Candidates for a Position
to Be Given to a Mao F ror 0
This State.
"WASHINGTON May 44 r â Senator Perkins said to-night that the
appointment of Colonel Thomas M. Anderson of the Fourteenth Infan
try to be a brigadier-general did not preclude the appointment of some
Californian to a brigadiership, as there were yet to be appointed about
eighteen or. twenty brigadiers from civil life. It is understood, how
ever, that political considerations will not influence the President In
making his selections, but they will be appointed upon merit.
Senator Perkins has submitted for the President's consideration the
following: list of Californlans who are candidates: J. S. Gage, San
Jose; Evan Davis, Orange; Theo Reichert, San Francisco; Brigadier-
General Muller. Fresno; Colonel George Stone, San Francisco; Major H.
T. Matthews, Santa Ana; General S. W. Backus, San Francisco: Gen
eral Lionel A. Sheldon. Los Angeles; Hon. Lyman Bridges, Sao Fran
cisco; Captain J. C. Currier, San Francisco; Colonel A. D. Cutler, San
Francisco; Julian L. Waller, San Francisco; General James Coey, San
Francisco; General J. H. Dickinson, San Francisco; Colonel Pa: ;
Henshaw, Chlco; General W. H. H. Hart, San Francisco; General E.
S. Salomon. These names were presented to Senator Perkins by friends
of the various aspirants.
The President is understood to have intimated to Senator Perkins
to-day that it was essential that the California delegation should unite
on some one of the candidates.
This seems to be difficult, however, for as usual the members of
the California delegation, are at loggerheads.
GETTING READY
FOR INVASION
Plans Being Completed at
Tampa for Field
Service.
Arrangements Also Made for
Landing a Large Force
of Native Cubans.
The First Infantry Regiment la Put
Through, the Emergency En
trenchment Drill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TAMPA, Fla., May 4.â lt p-pears to
be an almost settled belief among
army officers here that no movement of
United States troops toward Cuba will
take place until after the meeting of
the Spanish fleet with Rear Admiral
Sampson's squadron, whicH is now be
lieved to be inevitable. Nevertheless,
everything possible is being done to put
the United States troops in readiness
for immediate shipment.
Plans for division hospitals and the
allotment of surgeons were practically
completed to-day. The First Infantry,
one of the regi. ;ents which will be
landed in Cuba was put through the
emergency entrenchment drill, throw
ing up entrenchments with tin cups,
| skillets, tin pa\s or whatever was con
venient, and long practice marches in
i heaw marchinâ¢ order were given other
| regiments.
Preparations for the landing of a
large force of native Cubans at some
j point in Cuba within reach of General
| Gomez' army are beinc pushed as fast
!as possible. How large a force it will
ibe is uncertain. The Cuban recruiting
! offices that have been opened here are
j fairly overwhelmed with applicants for
i enlistment, and it is very probable that
close to 1500 men will be armed and
ready for service under the banners of
I Gomez before the end of the week.
Most of the Cubans who are now in the
West Tampa camp have already had
considerable military training. Their
! number is being constantly increased
' by arrivals from New York, Jackson
ville and other recruiting points.
Two or three United States naval
officers thoroughly familiar with the
| Cuban coast are now in Tampa for the
purpose of escorting the Cuban expedi
tion to Cuba and will remain with it
until the junction with Gomez is ef
fected.
Fell Dead at a Fire.
SACRAMENTO, May 4.â The barn of
James A. Clark, a dairyman whose place
is a short distance from the city, caught
fire to-night. While Clark was assisting
in getting out his horses he was over
come by excitement and fell dead. He was
nearly 70 years of age.

COURTESIES ACKNOWLEDGED.
IT is with more than ordinary gratification The
Call acknowledges the courtesies shown by the
Chronicle and Examiner in holding back their
editions of yesterday morning so that The Call, de
spite the burning of the building in which its press
rooms are located, was able to appear as early as any
of them.
As was stated yesterday, all of our contemporaries
offered the use of their presses, and that of the Chron
icle was accepted. Such acts are amonj the amen
ities that dignify the calling of journalism and set an
example of mutual helpfulness which business rivals
in other professions and trades might do well to
emulate.
The Call presses are now in working order and no
further trouble in the issue of the paper is expected.
In a time comparatively short the press-rooms will be
located in the fire-proof apartments provided in the
Claus Spreckels building, and with the new press
now on the way from New York the printing equip
ment of the paper will be unsurpassed and almost be
yond the reach of accident.
CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE.
WHILE in many of th- larger States of the
East the call for the National Guard to enlist
in the Volunteer Army for the war with Spain
has been met by more or less wrangling, the response
of California was prompt, direct and patriotic. Ar
rangements for enlistment were made at once, and
yesterday a considerable portion of our guard passed
formally into the service of the nation.
By this action California has won a new distinction
in the sisterhood of States. Her star in this crisis
shines among the brightest in the brilliant galaxy
that illumines the Hag of the republic. She has given
the most striking proof of the ardent patriotism of
her people and has shown that when the call to arms
is heard her volunteers wait not to decide little ques
tions of minor moment, but rally at once to the stan
dard and hasten among the foremost to the front, no
matter in what part of the globe the sound of battle
is heard.
In times gone by there has been much jesting at the
expense of the National Guard. The men who com
pose it have been called "holiday soldiers," and hab
itual satirists have made them the target of whatever
shafts their flagging wit or unflagging mockery could
fashion for use. This raillery is now a thing of the
past. The conduct of the members of the guard re
vealed in the fierce light of war has proven them to
be men of the true heroic breed â worthy descendants
of the generations who won the freedom of the land
from Great Britain and maintained it through the
perilous years of Civil War.
It is time now for Californians who are to remain
at home to manifest their honor for the boys of the
guard who are going to the front. It is no holiday
task for which they have volunteered. They have up
held the credit of the State by the alacrity with which
they have responded to the call of war, and they will
gallantly uphold the nation's honor and cause in the
field. The voices of the old-time satirists will now
be changed to voices of praise or silenced amid the
general acclamations of the people. A grateful na
tion and a proud State will speed the volunteers of
the guard on their march to battle and victory.
It is pleasant to read in a contemporary that its
dispatch boat, the McCulloch, has reached Hong
kong. Here Uncle Sam has been acting just as
though he owned that boat! With all respect for
Uncle, he must be rebuked for such presumption.
Doubtless the contemporary will soon permit us to
know whom it will send on its transport, the Peking,
and how fared its flagship, the Olympia, which its
Special Commissioner Dewey is understood to have
taken recently into a place of danger.
An intelligent jury at Sacramento has exonerated
one Griflfo from blame for the death of another pugil
ist in the ring. Probably the fact that the man died
immediately after having been beaten by GrifTo was
a mere coincidence. GrifTo is hereby congratulated
and counseled to abvet Providence in the killing off
of a few more of his kind.
It is strange that Greeks should want to volunteer
to fight Spain. They must have an idea that war is
always a sprinting match. The old Greek who
caught the Turk at midnight in a guarded tent made
the situation warm for the Turk, but the present
Greek is different.
It is very considerate of Turkey to declare neu
trality, and yet in case of necessity we might have
â¢yuzglcd along, anyway,
THE POWERFUL MAYOR.
HPHE history of the world proves that whenever
political power is lodged in the hands of an in
* dividual without check or restraint it is gene
rally abused. For ages the people have been strug
gling to wrest from individual potentates power that
has been used to oppress and plunder them. The
Bill of Rights, Magna Charta, the writ of habeas
corpus, trial by jury, an independent judiciary and
the separation of the legislative, judicial and execu
tive functions of government, all signalize triumphs
of the common people over individual tyranny and
what is known in these times as "personal responsi
bility." The work of centuries in behalf of human
liberty is condensed in the American constitution.
The fathers of the great republic justly feared the
power of an unrestrained executive, for they had felt
it and known what it was.
The American President is the British King strip
ped of some of his prerogatives and hedged in by
a popular Legislature. In these days we are accus
tomed to point to the long line of great men who have
ruled over the people for justification of our belief
that it is now safe to trust to the executive arm of the
government powers which were wrested from it only
after years of bloody struggle. The "thinkers" who
in their ignorance do this never stop to ask them
selves why the Presidents and Governors of these
days are mostly honorable men anxious to faithfully
serve their fellows. Were they to do so perhaps they
might change their opinions. Are not the executives
of the nineteenth century the product of restraint? Are
not their moderation and unselfishness due to the
circumstance that they have been unable to abuse
the powers conferred upon them? Is the record they
have made attributable to a change in human nature?
We propound these inquiries, not for the purpose
of making a point against the charter, which is to be
submitted to the people of this city on the 26th of
this month, but for the purpose of precipitating a
thoughtful controversy. Victor Hugo remarked that
the chief safety of communities consisted in their
disposition to pause, scratch their heads and think.
The proposed charter creates a powerful official
called Mayor. He is invested with authority to ap
point a Police and Fire Commission, a Board of
Health, a Board of Education, a Board of Public
Works, a Civil Service Commission and an Election
Commission, and remove them at pleasure. These
boards and commissions will expend two-thirds of
all the money that will be appropriated for conduct
ing the government of this city. No check has been
provided either upon the abuse of this appointing
power or upon the wasteful expenditure of this
money, except the conscience of the man who may be
elected Mayor. Not only may the Mayor remove his
own appointees, but he may suspend elected officials
at his pleasure. In fact, in his hands have been placed
without possible restraint practically all the functions
of government.
The question we desire to see discussed is this:
Are we prepared at this juncture to cast aside the
experience of centuries and create this uncrowned
king to rule over us? Is it possible that the people
of San Francisco have reached a state of political de
crepitude which justifies tliem in abdicating self
government? If they have it ought to be somebody's
duty to lay the facts before them for consideration.
The proposed charter marks a complete swing of the
pendulum of political power. It is a return to the
age of despots and tyrants. It is a confession of re
publican weakness, and if the people adopt it they
will declare their trust in conscience as a substitute
for restraints and checks, without which every gov
ernment on earth has proved a failure.
We say all this because there is a disposition in the
charter discussion so far to ignore the theory upon
which the instrument is framed. Undoubtedly the
charter contains many good things. It would be dif
ficult to frame a municipal organic law which did not
contemplate many necessary reforms. But what
about the theory of individual responsibility which
runs through it from end to end? Is that to be ig
nored while a spirited debate is conducted upon im
material issues?
We are occasionally pointed to the example of New
York. But the charter of that city may be repealed
by the Legislature any day, and the Legislature
meets annually to consider its abuses. Moreover.
Tammany captured New York's Mayor at the first
election, and the vast revenues of that city are now
being expended under the personal direction of Boss
Croker. With them he is rapidly building up a
political oligarchy more powerful than any that has
ever been seen in this country. It seems to us that
it would be well to discuss the "Lord Mayor" of the
charter from the standpoint of experience.
THE CAPTURED COLONIES.
1 N an address delivered on the presentation of a
I battle flag to a company of Indiana volunteers on
* Tuesday ex-President Harrison said: "We may
justly, I think, in the West Indies and in the Far East
ern seas, where our gallant navy has won so splendid
a victory, hold some little unpeopled harbors where
our cruising warships may coal and find a refuge
when in stress."
Mr. Harrison, while not in office, holds so high a
position in the politics of the country that this state
ment may be regarded as a tentative expression de
signed to feel the pulse of the people on the important
and far-reaching question as to what is to be done by
the United States with the Spanish colonies in the
West Indies and in the Orient. Cuba will of course
pass into the hands of the Cubans themselves as soon
as they can organize a government capable of main
taining itself and establishing law, but what shall be
done with Porto Rico and the Philippines?
The latter group involves the more serious ques
tion of the two. In the Philippine archipelago there
are upward of 1200 islands, of which about 400 are
large enough to sustain permanent populations. The
total number of inhabitants of the group is in round
numbers 7,000,000. Of these the greater number are
Malays. There are a few Spanish, hardly more in
dustrious or enterprising than the natives, and the in
dustry and commerce of the group is mainly in the
hands of Chinese.
In 1894 the total imports of the group amounted in
value to $28,530,000, and the exports to $33,250,000/
both measured in Mexican coin, which is the prevail
ing standard of the country. The real wealth of the
islands has, however, never been developed. It is
known that gold and coal exist in the mountains of
some of the larger islands, but they have not been
mined or extensively exploited by reason of a lack of
transportation. In the hands of an energetic race
the group could be made one of the richest colonial
possessions on the globe.
The occupation of a port of refuge and coaling
station in the archipelago by our Government would
inevitably imply an American protectorate over the
whole. Our responsibilities would increase from
year to year, and our exercise of power would have to
increase with them. In colonial affairs as well as in
all other matters in this world the law of evolution
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 5, 1898.
prevails. When once a thing has been started it
either advances or retires â dies or grows. Spain's
colonial power is dying; that of the United States
stands waiting the decision of the people in this
crisis.
What shall we do with the Philippines? is a ques
tion whose answer involves not only present condi
tions and American interests, but the whole course of
our future history and the affairs of the world. It is
an issue not to be settled lightly, and it is even pos
sible that the settlement may not be left to our un
trammeled will. It not infrequently happens that
even the greatest and strongest nations are sometimes
compelled by circumstances to go forward when they
would prefer to stand still.
ENCOURAGING HUNTINGTON'S EVA
SION.
rOR three days C. P. Huntington, president of
the Southern Pacific, has been testifying before
the Board of Railroad Commissioners. The
] three days have been wasted. The witness has not
revealed a fact. The questions asked him have been
for the most part wholly irrelevant or concerning
matters already of record and ascertainable by the
i opening of a book.
If some query bordered on practical investigation
Huntington has professed the greatest willingness to
j answer it, has used it as a text to illustrate the gen
j erosity which he frankly acknowledges to have been
j his lifelong inspiration, has taken excursions into the
realm of his own boyhood, and ended by ignoring the
question altogether. He -has simply told the Commis
sioners nothing, has played with them and made their
session a spectacle suggesting comedy. The officials
J have listened patiently to Huntington's assertion, oft
repeated, that he never made money out of California
roads, that he built the transcontinental line at a loss
i never yet made good, that he and his associates are
poor men, continually growing poorer. With all
| reasonable pity for Mr. Huntington's poverty, the
subject has been exhausted.
The public wants to know how much money the
Southern Pacific has expended in the corruption of
legislatures, courts, individuals, newspapers; particu
larly newspapers. There is a burning desire to find
out why for a period of months the Examiner was on
the payroll of the corporation for $iooo monthly. It
is no idle feeling of curiosity which makes the public
yearn for details as to a running account with that
paper amounting to $36,000 and never closed. Was
the sum charged up to loss? Who bore the loss?
The public suspects itself of being the victim. Mr.
Huntington should be asked if the Examiner was
paid by his philanthropic band a trifle of $7000 for the
printing of a speech delivered by Creed Haymond,
and if when the Pattison committee was here the dis
creet silence of Hearst's journal was not purchased
for $5000?
Such are a few of the things Huntington can tell
about fully, and he has expressed a wish to tell all he
knows. Surely the commission does not intend to
deny him the opportunity he craves. Surely it must
be tired of asking him questions which he declines
to answer and to which the answer would be of no
value. So far he has handled them with the ease he
handles his walking-stick. It is their duty, as it
should be their joy, to put to him interrogatories
which cannot be evaded, to bar quibbling, anecdote,
reminiscence, prophecy, and get down to business.
THE OPPOSITION IN CONGRESS.
SEVERAL silver Senators have requested the
President to appoint Mr. William J. Bryan to
a major-generalcy. The President had already
decided to appoint Lee, a Cleveland Democrat and
gold standard man, and General Wheeler, a Bryan
and silver man, to two of the four major-generalcies,
because they arc both men of thorough military train
ing and experience. Only trained soldiers should be
put in such commands, for they have the issue of bat
tles and the fate of thousands in their hands, and no
man inexperienced in tactics should be put in such a
place. It is probable that the application was made
in Bryan's behalf to create a grievance for use as
water on his political wheel. If such is its purpose, it
will fail. The President's perfect impartiality and
non-partisanship in these four appointments will grat
ify the country, and Mr. Bryan's effort to pose as the
Neglected One will fail.
If he burn with ardor to serve his country the ranks
are. open to him. President McKinley enlisted in the
Civil War as a private and fought his way to the post
of major. He supplemented this military service be
ginning in the ranks with thirty years of public serv
ice to his country in civil life before he achieved the
Presidency. The American people are very conserva
tive. They try a man thoroughly before they make
him President. That has been Mr* Bryan's mistake.
He thought that one speech repeated many times
gave him title to the. Presidency. Neither that nor a
major-general's conimission will translate him to that
high seat. If he burn with military zeal let him start
as a private as McKinley did, and if in thirty years
from his enlistment he show qualities deserving such
reward, his countrymen may consider his claims.
While Mr. Bryan is trying to keep up with the
band-wagon and make himself an object of interest,
it is evident that his party in Congress is getting
ready to abandon him. It proposes to seek issues
arising in the preparations for war and the means for
carrying it on.
Mr. J. Hamilton Lewis, who parts his name in the
middle to make up for not parting his hair at all, and
who divides with Bailey, McMillin, Champ Clark
and Bland the preposterous leadership of the House
minority, has made his share of the issue. He pro
poses to read out of the party the six Democrats who
voted for the war revenue bill,* because that bill per
mits the issue of bonds as a popular loan if the ne
cessities of the war require it. The six men who pre
ferred to stand by their country rather than by Mr.
Lewis have calmly requested that gentleman to
go to!
It is evident that these five leaders of the House
minority will each submit an issue. Of course Mc-
Millin's will be free trade, except in such staples as
Tennessee produces. Bland will offer free coinage of
silver at 16 to I, and Champ Clark will simply pro
pose that denunciation of Mr. Cleveland is the way
to bring the Democratic party into power, while Mr.
Bailey will antagonize dress suits.
The new platform will read: "Resolved, That we
support the war, but oppose all means for carrying it
on. Resolved, That under the present administration
the country is going to the devil in a dress suit. Re
solved, That free trade in everything that is not pro
duced by our deestrick is the true American policy.
Resolved, That free coinage of silver at 16 to i will
bring peace by leaving us nothing to fight with,
"D n Cleveland."
On this the five-headed party can go into battle,
butâ . .. .

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS
The people of Madrid are a theater- !
going race, and when money was wanted j
recently to buy a new warship, with all j
the modern appliances, for war against
tho United States, it was unanimously re
solved to raise the sum by a big musical i
and dramatic performance at the Theater j
Royal. The continental papers have j
since announced that the receipts of this ,
performance surpassed the record even
of Patti or Melba's big receipts. People
vied with one another in giving high
prices for the seats. The Queen Regent
set the pace by giving $10,000 for her box i
and each of her Ministers gave $1000 for
hla seat, while the banker Larois paid j
$30,000 for one chair in the orchestra stalls, j
Wealthy Countess Cornos paid $20,000 for j
her seat, the Marquis Laguna $5000 and j
the Bank of Spain bought a box for I
THE QUEEN REGENT OF SPAIN.
â â¢. : â¢
I 5100,000. A number of army officers
I clubbed together for a box and so did a
similar number of navy officers, and In
each case the price paid was $1000. The
Madrid Cycling Club and the Bourse each
paid the price of $1000 a stall. The Oa-
I sino of Madrid took two seats at $200' l
| each. The Marquis of Vlllamcjor and Don
j Esteban each gave $50,000 for their seats
â¢â  and other spectators paid in the same
j manner. The total receipts were more
i than a million and a half francs. The an
nihilation of Spain's fleet in the Philip
pines, however, has shown the Madrid
public that musical performances, how-
I ever enthusiastically conducted, are not
j sufficient to provide a country with a
navy.
General Lord Wolseley, the hero of Tel
el-Kebir, follows the gentle art of music
in his leisure moments. It appears that
this illustrious warrior, whom some of his
compatriots regard as a fin-de-siecle Wel
lington, has an extremely sensitive ear.
and flinches before inharmonious sounds
as he haa never flinched before the ene
mies' bullets. It is a well-known fact
that the English Boldiers have a habit of
singing when on the march, and it now
transpires that the vanquisher of Aral>i
has suffered unknown tortures from the
fact that these amateur vocalists are in
the habit of Binging out of tune in the
most lamentable fashion. Often on the
burning sands of the Soudan have the
brave generalissimo's ears ached with the
discords thrust upon them, and often has
he meditated over a remedy. Not for the
world would Lord Wolseley have deprived
his soldiers of the joy of lifting up their
\oices in song. At last he hit upon a rem
edy, which he has just carried Into ef
fect. Singing classes are being organized
in connection with the British army
â cfaOOlS. and so much interest has been
shown in them by the soldiers that Lord
Wolseley's friends have now no tear that
when some of his men are singing a
chorus in G major the others will bo
warbling in A flat minor. For the future
all will be harmonious.
There is something 1 very touching In a
letter by the late A. Ponchielli, which has
just been published for the first time.
The letter, which was dated "Milan. ISS3,"
was written to the mother of Glacomo
Puccini, now the successful composer of
a number of operas, but at that time a
young student, just graduated from the
Milan Conservatory ( where the- great
Ponchielli had been his master, as he was
the master of Mascagni, Leoncavallo and
most of the composers of "Young Italy."
After congratulating Signora Puccini on
the talent possessed by her Giacomo and
saying, modestly. "I have done little or
almost nothing for your son, for I be
lieve that he owes and will owe every
thing to his own genius," the composer of
"La Gioconda" continues: "When I myself
left the conservatory with medals, dip
lomas, applause and honors I had to ap
ply to friends at Cremona In order to
obtain a. few pupils for the piano. And
one of my chief resources in that town
was to hold the position of organist at
Sant' Imero at a salary of a hundred Aus
trian francs a year (S2O). It was not till
later that I obtained the post of director
of the municipal music at Piacenzla and
finally at Cremona; I exercised this
trade (for I could not call it otherwise)
for about eight or nine years. Then, when
the Eternal Father willed, I was able,
after all those years, to give 'I Promessi
Sposi" at the Dal Verme Theater, Milan,
and from that time my career commenced.
It is necessary, then, to have patience and
hope. When true merit exists sooner or
later it is recompensed. As your Giacomo
has talent and merit, I live in the confi
dence that the way will be opened for
him." The letter concludes with expres
sions of good will. Poor Ponchielli did not
live to see all his predictions fulfilled,
but the letter partly explains the influence
which this noble-hearted man exercised
over all his pupils.
Pierre L.otl attended the Opera Comlque
and occupied the box of Queen Natalie of
Servia at a performance recently of 'Tile
dv Revo," the opera which is based on
his novel, "Lotl's Marriage." He has been
persuaded to write his impressions of the
performance for the Revue de Paris. The
following are 6ome fragments of what he
says: "It beginsâ in the dying away of
the noise of the crowdâ the orchestral
prelude. Something sweet and strange
escapes from the bows, music of 'else
where,' one would say, enveloped in mists,
in the past and in the faraway. â¢ â¢ â¢
But the curtain is risingâ the banal red
curtain â and suddenly for me a charm,
which seemed to be increasing, faints and
dies away. Still the scenery is fine: it is
even the best that could be done with the
miserable appliances of a theater; a little
canvas, a little painting and lamps to
represent the sun and the moon. Now
I smile on seeing the people of Tahiti, who
at the first glance gave me the Impression
of a chance masquerade. But here is tho
young girl who represents Rarahu. She
trains her light robÂ© and wears In her
ha^r a flower of tho red hibiscus, stuck
above her ear, in the- fashion of yonder.
Suddenly I take her seriously. What pro
found artist, then, is this young girl, who
la not yet 20. to have composed for her
self this Indescribable exotic atmosphere,
this veil of mystery and languor! â¢ â¢ â¢
And the orchestra continues her faraway
incantation, which, little by little and
more by more, transforms theso painted
canvases into the visions of a dream."
Salnt-Saens, the Wandering Jew of
musicians, is coming to America. It is
not the United States, however, that the
composer of "Samson and Delila" is
about to visit, but the Argentine Republic.
Professors Gomi and Marchal and Pro
fessor Williams, director of the Buenos
Ayres Conservatory, have Invited the
composer to visit their city, and Saint-
Saens has accepted the invitation. He
will remain for some months at Buenos
Ayres, where he will occupy himself with
reorganizing- the Conservatory of Music.
He will also conduct the coming peason of
Italian opera, which includes his "Sam
son." Tamagno will be the Samson.
Faint-Saens has just sought safety from
war's alarms by hurrying home from the
Canary Isl.^s, where he has winterol for
several years. He was met at Marseilles
by a large crowd of admiring friends.
Without any delay he hurried on to
Boziers.ln thearena of which town the first

Don Lorenzo Perosi. the priest-compos
er whose oratorio. "The Transfiguration,"
met with such success :it Venice, is not
going to rest satisfied with his one tri
umph. He Is now busy writing another
work of the same kind, "The Raising of
I.azarus," the words for which he has
taken from the Scriptures. The work Is
already well advanced and the composer
hopes to have it ready for production by
July.
Another South American composer Is
signalized, this time at Pernambuco. His
name is 1.. Smido, and for some years he
has been the chef d'orchestre of the Santa
Isabella Theater. Smido's taste runs to
ward sacred music, and he lias just had
a mass for four voices, with orchestral
accompaniment, executed. The mass has
covered the composer with glory, and the
Brazilian papers hall Smido as a great,
composer.
The Ysaye concerts in Brussels go on
merrily without a murmur that the con

by phonograph to his Brussels admirers.
Ossip Loaw, a young- Russian composer,

UNRECORDED
SEA FIGHT.
dent Mariners were sitting, as he toyed
with his spoon and watched the lump of
augar in his glass slowly dissolve. "I
have seen a little scrapping myself down In
that part of the world as well as around
Mobile Bay. It is nearly forty-five years
since I was one of the crew on a little brig
that took the contract of cleaning up a
few pirates down around the Malay
Peninsula, and you bet we finished thenij
oft in great shape- when we once
started. The hottest fight, however, t
ever did see was one that history has
never recorded nor bards sung about. It
was one of the revenue cutters coming
down from the Arctic with a wreck, i
crew, and while it lasted it made hell
fairly pop In a little space.
"On board the cutter there was a dog
by the name of Ta.ska and a thr- â 
quarter grown black bear. The . :
reigned supreme from the break of the
poop aft. while the bear consider |
everything on the main deck as his par
ticular property. As long as each anlm.il
did not encroach on the territory of the
other everything would go along ;
antly. but aa soon as the border v -
passed then the trouble would comment
"The dog was accustomed to sleep under
the cabtn table, while along the transoms
on each side four men sleptâ the i
of the wrecked whaler, the pilQt, the cap
tain of the cutter, who had given up I 3
own private stateroom to a minister m
was aboard, and myself. One night as t a
little vessel was plunging and tossing ;
a heavy sea way, I, lying on the tr;
half awake, heard the dog under the table
uttering low growls and moving aroui I
in an uneasy manner. At the same tim.-s
something came softly pattering down the
brass shod steps of the companion way
btoppfng at every few steps. I wu
dering what could be the matter. wh> :i
suddenly something black, emitting a hor
rible growl, shot up on top of the tabl< .
smashing the swinging lamp to atoms and
immediately afterward pandemonium
seemed to have broken loose In the cabir:.
The other gentlemen of the transoms
sprang out in their naked feet and rushed
around in the darkness, falling over each
other and being continually trodden upon
by the heavy sea boots of the watch on
deck, who, hearing the row, had come
down below. The minister stuck his head
out of the door and asked what the matt- r
was. The chorus of sulphurous answers he
red sent him back strangling to tha
privacy of his chamber.
"Finally a light was procured ar.d
there, amidst the wreckage of what was
once the cabin furniture, the bear and
dog were discovered fighting like a coupio
of things possessed of the devil. The dog
was a monster and game, but the beiir
was proving a little too much for him,
though the blood and hair scattered over
everything showed that neither was hav
ing any walkover. They were finally
separated with the help of a red hot
poker brought from the galley. The dog
retired to lick his wounds, while the
bear, making a rush, in the course of
which he managed to take about five
inches of skin off the cutter captain's leg,
got into the pantry, where he started to
demolish the crockery. Various plans
were suggested for his dislodgment, but
finally it was decided to lasso him and
drag him out. The rope was thrown -over
his neck and an Irishman by the namu
of Duffy, mounting to the top of the com
panion way, tried to pull the beast up
after him. The bear however would not
move until the pik>t drove the point of a
cutlass into him, when he moved so
quickly that Duffy v^-a.s unable to get out
of his way, and consequently passed the
next three weeks under the care of th-j
ship's surgeon.
"When everything had quieted down the
minister, emerging from his stateroom,
said in the calmest manner possible: 'Was
there not something unusual going on?"
He received such an explicit answer from
the cutter captain, whose leg was being
f^ed, that he never asked another
finest ion until tho vessel reached port, and
he wanted to know what street car would
take him to his destination.".

Karl met his master to-day. He low

horse, for Plaudit, like the aristocrat of
the turf that ha is, vron the honors of
the classic event by nobly responding
to a call for speed in a way that will
long be remembered by the 15,000 peo
ple who saw it.
Derby day dawned dark and gloomy,
and by 10 o'clock rain came and con
tinued at intervals until 2 o'clock. The
sandy soil of the track absorbed it,
however, and the going was not over
a second and a half slow when the bell
sounded.
The field was sent away In the first
break with Lleber Karl In front, Isa
bey second, Plaudit third and Han dOr
last. These positions were maintained
as they went around the lower turn
and when they were straightened out
in the backstretch Lleber Karl was a
length and a half In front, while Sims
had brought Plaudit up to second place.
Down the home stretch they went and
as the horses passed for the final time
Sims went to work on Plaudit and no
thoroughbred ever responded better.
Kach stride enabled him to cut down
the distance and when they faced the
fire in the stretch Libber Karl had but
a half-length the advantage, with Plau
dit still lessening the distance. They
were <>n even terms at the eighth pole
and then, amid the lusty shouts of the
thousands that packed the stands, the

track and to the wire, winner of the

SHIELDS WAS
TOO CONFIDENT
Judge Denny Defeated
Satsuma Through His
Carelessness.
; The Black Horsa Was Superbly
Ridden by Dick
Clawson.
Four Winning Choice* at Oakland.
San Matso Finished in Front of
a Band of Sprinters.
By a piece of very botchy work In the
saddle that would reflect no credit on
a cobbler Henry Shields managed to
got Satsuma, the Burns handicap win
ner, beaten in a three-horse race at
Oakland yesterday. It was a mile and
a furlong run, the fourth event on the
card, and the contenders were Judge
Denny and Ostler Joe. With the Judsre
carrying 116 pounds and meeting the
black Montana horse at equal weights
it looked a good thing for Dr. Rowell's
blaze-faced chestnut, and he was heav
ily plunged on at odds of 4 to 6. Ostler
Joe receded in the betting, and 5 to 1
was always obtainable about Denny.
Clawson on the latter was allowed
to go out and make the running.
When the far turn was reached Ostler
Joe had shot his bolt, falling back
beaten. Shields on the favorite appar
ently indulged himself In the Illusion
that he could "go and get" the leader
whenever he chose. Soon finding out
his mistake In the stretch he began
riding hard, and at the trainer's stand
had the favorite a head in frunt. Then
he began a very pretty club-swinging
turn with his "bat," and Clawson, tak
ing advantage of his good nature,
kicked the Judge hard in the ribs, and
in a furious drive got the verdict by a
head. The talent were extremely light
after the race and hope Shields will re
frain from drawing finÂ© finishes In fu
ture.
In the other races decided favorites
had it pretty much their own way.
scoring on four out of the six occa
siur.y. The fields were large and the
betting better than for some days.
Of the cheap lot lining up in the
opening five furlong scramble for
three-year-old maidens Emma Rev,
with Cltf.v.suii In the saddle, proved the
best, winning easily from Lona Marie,
going to the post a 2 to 1 choice.
The four furlong run for maiden two
year-olds was a mere cake walk for
the 3 to 6 choice, Excursion. The brown
colt showed first from the start and
won galloping from Key Hooker, a 25
to 1 shot. Piggott got Mallakwa home
in the show.
Obsidian, the $2500 purchase of the
Burns & Waterhouse string, is evi
dently a false alarm. Made a stout
choice for the four and a half furlong
scramble for two-year-olds, he showed
little speed and was unplaced at the
wire. In a drive E Come with Piggott
in the saddle hit the wire first, a length
before Malay, a 12 to 1 outsider piloted
by Gouin. Ojtti, after cutting out the
pace, finished third.
In the seven furlong run the 7 to 5
favorite, San Antonio, outbroke his
field, and, leading all the way, won
ridden out from Watomba.
A big bunch of fourteen started in
the final six furlong sprint. San Ma
teo outclassed the field and with some
thing to spare 'Â£|t the finish downed
Sport McAllister two lengths. Mamie
Scott. Becond t.> the saddling paddock,
took the show.

GOSSIP OF
THE DIAMOND.
By JOE CORBETT.
Dave I,evy has been released on account
of his "hard hitting."
Pitchor Harvey, familiarly known as the
"Silent Man," came out of hia trance last
Sunday and demonstrated in an unmistak
able manner that he can be "real noisy"
if circumstances warrant it.
Held of the Fresno team endeavored to
punch Umpire L<ong's head off after the
I game last Sunday, because he was called
I out at the plate on a close play. Presi
| dent Bert should take immediate action
j and make an example of Mr. Held. It is
I to be regretted that players should so far
I forget themselves. These "rowdy tactics"
] should be stopped immediately, as a :
â  scarcity of good umpires will bÂ« the in
: evitable result.
At Monday night's* meeting of the now
'â  league it was decided to take 2Vs per cent
| of the receipts of all games played, to be
, divided among the clubs finishing first,
i second and third. This will be an ad
i ditional object for the teams to put re
i newed energy into .their work, for when
j the end comes a nice sum of money will
\ be in waiting for those clubs fortunate
; enough* to be among the first three.
Bill Hammond, the clever catcher of the
1 San Franciscos, is one of the best throw
| ers now playing on the coast. He does
; not throw as fast a ball as pome of the
catchers, but more than makes up for this
' deficiency by his rapid movements in get
. ting the ball away. Last Sunday at
1 Fresno he caught three men napping: at
I third base, and had Murphy been watch
: ing the game, it is said, he would have
! caught two or three more at first. Great
'â  work. Bill; keep it up.
Carl Krug made quite a record in Sun
| day's game at Fresno, throwing four men
out at the plate. Altogether there were
six men thrown out endeavoring to score
on infield hits.
Sykes, the new first baseman of the re
! organized Oaklands, la the tallest player
in the league, and should make a "great
1 hit" playing the initial bag. He is a trille
weak on "Hcoops," possibly on account of
his height, yet with practice should easily
overcome this fault.
Claud Smeer is a great little shortstop
no one will dispute that factâ but "Claud
le*s" throwing to first base at times I*.
i very poor. With "Big" Sykes playing the
bag it would be a good idea for Claud to
I throw all the balls high, It will have to
! be thrown over the grand stand or Sykes
will reach it; so remember that, Claud,
and always throw high.
j Hardies drive over the clubhouse in
Sunday's game was a "peacherine."
"Youngers" Johnson departed for the
East Monday night.
Harvey complains* of, a sore arm. The
great fault with all pitchers out here is
the same. They do not take proper care
of their arm during a game. After finish
ing an inning a pitcher should lose no
time in covering his arm, and keep it
covered until It is time to again resume
hostilities. It is during the rest between
innings, when a pitcher's arm is
warm, and very often p' 'â¢spiring, that
a cold sets in. Therefore, pitchers, good
and bad, cover up the "wing," or some
day in the near future you will be rele
gated to that class known as has been or
"never wasers." __ _
Easterners call Hughes the "California
wonder." He defeated New York Mon
day, and boat a great team. Meekln, one
of the oldest and best pitchers now In
the league, opposed him in the box, which
adds additional glory to his victory. I
think New York the hardest team in the
league for a right-handed pitcher to beat,
as they have eight left-handed batters,
and consider this latest victory of Hughes
as great as any. No use talkingâ they
"can't" stop these Native Sons.
There Is an immense amount of discus
sion among: the managers regarding the
selection of Recreation Park as tho
league grounds. It is a mighty hard mat
ter to satisfy everybody in this "blooming
world," and thero is no use arguing, for
as a ball ground, Recreation Park la as
far above Central Park as the Call build
ing is above the Examiner. It is utterly
impossible to play a good game of ball at
Central Park, unless it bo with a dead
ball, and the people are tired of this
stuffed ball proposition. The new league
propose having their teams play good
fast ball. To do this a live ball must bo
used, and it's like throwing money away
to put a live ball in play at Central Park.
To bo sure, It Is more centrally located
and In consequence will attract those peo
ple whose fondness for the game is such
that if it were not being played right In
their path they would not otherwise come
to see : it. The league, however, would
starve if it catered to that class of peo
ple. Their idea is to give the public good
baseball. To do this they must play on a
ground where the outfield will have a
chance to catch a ball without climbing
up a fence or Into the stands, and where
the batter will have to hit the ball if he,
expects to be credited with a basehit. If
the people want to see baseball a five or
six block walk is not going to stop them
by . any, means. ;In Chicago and many
other league, cities people are compelled
to go three, four and live miles to see a
game, and while San Francisco is not
Chicago, still baseball "fans" are the
prime the world over. A few blocks is
certainly not going to prevent those in
San Francisco from .seeing the game/
especially so when they know the change
was made, that the teams might give
them their best efforts. v
Owing to the scarcity of good umpires
it would be a good plan for the league to
abandon the double umpire system and
give each game In the different towns a
"good umpire."

BLOWS THAT WILL STING.
New Punches Which May Be Used hu Jeffries and
Sharkey Friday Evening.
JAMES JEFFRIES.
Jim Jeffries, th<? 230-pound heavy-weight champion of Southern Califor
nia, according to latest Intelligence from his training quarters In Oakland,
has Invented a new Mow which is called the "Manila punch."
Billy Delaney says that there is no such thing as getting away from it.
It comes from the right battery and carries death wherever it lands.
"Oh. if he evc-r hits the sailor's breastworks or ris hea/igear Jt will be
all over but the .shoutinjc," said Billy in undertones.
Bharkey has six new blows, but his favorites are the left swing, which
he calls the "Sampson brain-disturber,* 1 and the right hook, which he has
named the "Dewey life-destroyer,"
The sailor expects to end the war when he lands either of those dread
ful punches; consequently the patrons of the great game of hit-and-duck
may anticipate a hot and spirited engagement when Greek meets Greek on
Friday evening.
The sports who are gambling on the result are very much divided in their
opinions. All tilings considered the consensus of opinion among those who
are playing Jeffries to win is that Bharkey will meet an opponent who
has. from a physical point of view, the better of the argument, and that
scientifically speaking the pugilists are about equally matched.
Bharkey will have large numbers of followers nevertheless. Believers in
the sailor's prowess say that he is too lucky to lose a fight and that if
the contest shall lust ten or more rounds Jeffries will be compelled to
show the white feather.
The betting is particularly lively and large sums of money are being 1
placed in the pool rooms to be wagarsd on both men at tho prevailing
odds of $10 to $8, With Sharkey on the short end.
The managers of the National Club have been imposed upon by somÂ«
sleight of hand performers, who have bogus tickets of admission to the
Sharkey and Jeffries fight on Friday evening. Messrs. Groom and Gibbs are
desirous that the sporting, public shall bo on guard and not purchase any
tickets from outsiders; otherwise they will suiter the consequences. Tick
ets can be purchased at 900 Market street, at Gunst's cigar store and at the
entrance to the Pavilion on thÂ« .evening of the entertainment.

DROPPED DEAD
WITH BAD NEWS
Mrs. Louisa Kampos Left the
Bedside of Her Dying
Child.
Expired on Her Way to Her Husband
and Must Be Buried by the
City.
MrÃ. Louisa Kampos, a young married
woman, fell dead yesterday on Langton
street, between Howard and Folsom,
whilo running to tell her husband that
one of their children was dying.
lliiÃband and wife lived in two rooms
in *he reur of 12S Langton street. They
are Â»cry poor, and tho husband has been
eking out a bare living for his wife and
two children by working in a second
hand bottle yard at 122>j Howard street.
The three-year-old baby took sick with
diphtheria a tew days ago and Dr. Levin
was called in. He reported the caae to the
Board of Health, and tho usual warning
notice against diphtheria was posted on
the door.
Yesterday afternoon the child was re
ported In a dying condition, and the
mother ran out to notify her husband,
who was working about throe blocks
away. She had gone about one I*l* ck
when she suddenly sank to the side- walk
and expired.
It being evident that death wag due to
natural causes Deputy Coroner McCor
mick wan willing to leave the poor
woman's body at her home, but he found
that there would be no room there, the
family occupying only two rooms, and
that 'he presence of diphtheria in the
place rendered it unsafe for visitors. Tho
husband was without means and unable
to pay for the burial of his wife, so ihe
body was tnkon^to the Morgue and will
be interred In the potter's field unless
charitable, persons make other arrange
ments.
Mrs. Kampos was a fiatlve of Switzer
land, 25 years old. _

Clever Eastern Forger
Now in Hiding in
This City.
Arthur H. Klein Betrayed
by the Woman Who
Had Loved Him.
Detectives Have Been Detailed
on the Case and an Arrest
Will Soon Follow.
HIS PARENTS WEALTHY
The Accused Man Is Disowned by
His Father and. Once Attempted
to Take His Own Lite.
According to reports madÂ© to the head j
of the Police Department last evening
one of the cleverest formers who ever op
erated in Eastern or local fields Is In this j
city. For months past he has been, llv- |
ARTHUR H. KLEIN, WHO IS ACCUSED OF BEING A CLEVER EASTERN
FORGER.
tng on the fat of the land and besides has
lived openly and given his correot name,
although he was much wanted by the
Chief of Police of Pittsburg.
Arthur H. Klein, who was at one time
prominently connected with the Taren
tum Mirror and Art Glass Works at 4U9
Fifth avenue, Pittsburg, Pa., and a son
of the wealthy liquor dealer, Max Klein,
of Allegheny, Is the man sought for. The
police, however, are not the only ones
anxious to have him brought for trial and
returned to his home, as Beatrice Wal
lace, who has been made a victim of the
cleverness of Klein, made the report to
the police and also stated that she was
loser to the extent of several hundred
dollars through the wiles and promises
of love made by the accused party. Ac
cording to the story told by the woman
who has lost the affections of Klein, he
came to the city some years ago, but has
not endeavored to get employment. She
.met him about eight months ago, and he
soon became a regular visitor to her
apartments.
The case seems to be the well-worn
Story of a young man who preferred fast
living to home surroundings and an en
deavor to make for himself what he was
so willing to spend in riotous living. The
case seems to be all the more regretta
ble, as his family is well known and high
ly respected by all who know them.
According to the report made by Miss
Wallace, Klein was acquainted with a
young man who had for years kept com
pany with one of her dearest friends. In
consequence she was often thrown In
company with him, and after a few
. weeks they became fast friends. Klein
frequently borrowed money from her and
always said that he would repay It and
showed a card of the glass works where
he said lie was employÂ«=>d .and also stated
that his father, Max Klein, was the
wealthiest liquor dealer in Allegheny.
After a time the man became brutal and
frequently beat her, but she had become
attched to him .and took the abuse
without a complaint. This went on from
time to time, until the young- man re
ceived a letter from home disowning him,
and he then became even more brutal In
his treatment toward her, and a quarrel
which resulted in their separation took
place. Then her sealskin sack was taken
and pawned by her former lover, ana the
trouble seemed to grow darker. Klein
caroe back on two occasions, but merely
to beat the woman, and becoming desper
ate Miss Wallace reported the matter to
the police.
"He nan often told me," she said, "that
he was wanted in the East for forging his
father's name and that he was almost
afraid to give his right name in this city,
but he again stated that he thought a
bold move was the safest way, and in
consequence went about the streets in a
careless manner and soon recovered from
his fright.
"On one occasion he attempted to cut
his throat with a razor which he kept in
the room, and but for my intervention he
would now be a corpse. At times he was
exceedingly jolly, again brutal and then
a fit of remorse would come over him and
he would try to end his life and mine as
well. I became frightened and had the
doors locked so that he could not get
Into my apartments, and also told the
proprietor of the house not to let him in.
The detective is working hard on the
case and hopes to soon have proof which
will lead to the arrest of the much want
ed man.

WAS AFRAID TO
COME INTO PORT
Captain Aspe Feared That
San Francisco Had
Been Captured.
The Peruvians Told Him All
United States Ports Were
Blockaded.
The Woman In the BgumÂ«nn Case
is the Wife of William P.
Hermann.
Captain Aspe of the schooner Bangor \
approached port In fear and trembling j
last week. He left SaJaverry fifty-three !
days ago, and the news In that out-of-the
way corner of the globe was that San
Francisco had been captured and that all j
the other American ports were blockaded
by a Spanish fleet. According to the vera
cious report, New York was expected to
surrender at any moment, and Captain |
Aspe was advised very strongly to remain j
in port and save his vessel. When the
Bangor arrived in the vicinity of the
Farallones, therefore, the captain was ex
pecting every minute to sight a Spanish
cruiser. A man was on the lookout day
and night, but as nothing hove In sight
the anxiety of the crew abated somewhat.
After beating about for a day or so, the
Bangnr was headed Inshore, and when
a pilot-boat was met the true state of af
fairs was learned.
"The Peruvians were sure that the
United States was a Spanish province ,
I when I left," said Captain Aspe yester
! day, "and thought I was foolhardy to
| start for San Francisco. I told them that
their telegrams were all lies and that I I
I was going straight home. In spite of I
Spanish cruisers. Of course, we kept a !
! bright lookout when we were nearing the i
coast, but, 1 tell you, we were glaxl to hear ',
i of Admiral Dewey'a victory at Manila."
! The Bangor brought up a cargo of nitrate
from Salaverry.
The boat washed off the deck of the
pilot-boat America during the recent
i nor" wester was picked up about eight
miles below the Cliff House a couple of
days ago. Two young men found it on the
beach and brought it to Mei^rgs wharf. !
< Captain Jordan of the America gave them
a $20 gold piece for their trouble.
The sternwheeler City of Dawson, in
tended for the Yukon River trade, met j
I with an accident while being launched at I
; Meiggs wharf yesterday. The ways broke :
and the vessel's stern dropped Into the ]
water, while the bow fell on the rocks i
) and was stove In. It will take some time !
and cost considerable money to repair the i
damage.
Wong Hop was treated for a number of
lacerated wounds on the head by Drs.
Hill and Zabala at the Harbor Receiving;
Hospital yesterday. He went out of a j
house in Chinatown to get a cup of
toffee, and on his return a man came up
from behind the door and beat him over
the head with a piece of gaspipe. No
arrest.
C. F. Smith of engine 12 lost the tops
of two of his fingers after returning from
the fire on Commercial street yesterday
looming. He was reeling up the hose,
when his hand got caught. Dr. Zabala, at
the Harbor Receiving Hospital, wanted to
amputate the fingers at the first joint
but Smith would not have the operation
performed until he consulted his friends.
John J. Moriarty. chief engineer of the
steam schooner Jeanie, caught In the ice
near Point Barrow, writes that the vessel
will "probably get out in the spring." He
s.iys that provisions are scarce and that
the men are very much in need of skin
clothing. The crew of the Jeanie were

AN EASY
WAY TO
GET IN
Door Opened to Ille
gal Admission of
Chinese.
Certificates of Registra
tion Taken From the
Collector's Office.
No Way by Which the Missing
Documents May Bo Identi
fied When Produced.
SENSATIONAL DISCOVERY.
Traffic In Immigrants Carried on for
Years by a Gang of Unknown but
Suspected Boodlere.
Federal officiate have Just made a
sensational discovery in the office of
the revenue collector for this district.
A few weeks ago the United States
Treasury Department authorized Inter-
I nal Revenue Collector Lynch to employ
I two persons to make an index of the
40,000 Chinese registration certificates
which are kept in the big steel vault
in the office. After they had been at
work about two weeks they discovered
that several of the certificates were
missing.
As the cash value of each certificate
Is equal to that of a Chinese female
slave It is evident that the missing pa
pers were not "lost" for nothing, and
that somebody has been lining his
pockets with the proceeds. But the
theft and sale of the missing docu
ments are the least of the loss. Here
after when a Chinese person loses his
or her certificate and the original can
not be found in the vault in the col
lector's office the attorney for the ap
plicant will establish the alleged fact
of the loss by Chinese testimony, and
the collector will be obliged to issue a
new duplicate certificate to the appli
cant and to file a new original in the
vault-
This will open the door to great
fraud. All that will be necessary for a
Chinese to do who has gained admis
sion to this country by sneaking in over
the Mexican border will be to claim
that he was in San Francisco at the
time of the registration of the Chinese
and that he received a certificate of
registration which was afterward de
stroyed by fire or lost in some other
way. If an index had been made at the
time the registration took place such
frauds would not be possible, but in the
absence of such index there is no means
of ascertaining the identity of the miss
ing documents so that the way is clear
for all applicants.
All the evidence secured thus far by
the Federal authorities tends to show
that the important and valuable pa
pers were abstracted during the term
of O. M. Welburn, Mr. Lynch's prede
cessor, and that they were sold at good
prices to Chinese men and women who
have been surreptitiously landed In Cal
ifornia.
In order to understand the full sig
nificance of the discovery made by the
Federal authorities it Is necessary to
refer to the manner in which the cer
tificates were brought into existence.
The validity of the act of Congress re
quiring the registration of all Chinese
In the United States at the time of the
passage of the act was attacked by the
Chinese Six Companies, who instructed
their people not to register. The courts
decided that the act was constitutional
and not in contravention of the treaty
between China and the United States,
and the time was extended in order to
give Chinese residents an opportunity
of complying with the law.
The registration was taken very has
tily and no index was made of the
names of the Chinese, so that In the
case of a Mongolian losing his papers
It was the work of many tedious hours
to find the original among the 40,000 on
file in the office of the Collector of In
ternal Revenue. It is made the duty
of the Collector to furnish a duplicate
certificate in case of loss of the dupli
cate originally issued and this dupli
cate is made a copy of the original on
file in the office. But If the original
is not found on file, then it is incum
bent upon the applicant to establish
the fact that he has registered and that
the original should be in the possession
of the Collector.
Chinese who have lost their certi
ficates have employed attorneys and
customs brokers to procure the dupli
cates, the search being made by clerka
of the Collector after office hours.
Clerk Dillard has been employed in this
work on a number of occasions, but he
strenuously denied to a Call reporter
that he had been paid any tips by law
yers or brokers for exercising diligence
in the search, no allowance being made
by the Government for the extra hours
spent in this labor.
Other clerks have shared with Dil
lard the labor of these after-hour
searches, and they, too, have denied
that they have received any pay for
their services. It Is, however, an ad
mitted fact that the attorneys and
brokers employed by the Chinese to
obtain these duplicates have received
an average fee of $20 from their clients
for each, and it Is reported that part
of this fee has been paid to clerks who
made the search.
Malvern M. Foote, who has an exten
sive Chinese practice, was asked
whether he had paid Dillard or any
of the other clerks of the Collector any
fees or tips for the search, and he re
plied that he had not, but he added
this significant explanation: "I have
never paid anything to Dillard and I do
not know whether any others have
done so or not, but it Is not natural
that men should work after office hours
and receive no compensation for it. I
suppose that sometimes a lawyer meet
ing one of the clerks on the street
would hand him $5 and say, 'For 's
sake, go buy yourself a new hat'; but
I don't know that such a thing has
been done.
"If any of the certificates are miss
ing: it is a damnable thing," added the
lawyer. "It is a sign of atrocious fraud
and rottenness. What is the value of
one of these duplicates? Well, you can
tell that as well as I. One of them
would be of great value to a Chinaman
to pack around with him, so as to en
able him to remain In this country
without being really entitled to do so.
They would be well worth $500 apiece."
Not only the clerks, but custom
brokers and attorneys have had access
to the original certificates on file, and
the responsibility for their loss being
divided among so many it will be a
difficult matter to fix the blame upon
any particular individual.

THE SIMINOFF
FAMILY WAR
Three Brothers and a Brother
in - Law in the
Fight.
Aaron and Louis HÂ«vÂ» to Answer
to Two Charge* of
Battery.
Aaron Slmlnoff and Louis Slminoff,
brothers, appeared in Judge Low's court
yesterday to answer a charge of battery.
Another charge against them had been,
called a few days before and it was
continued until Friday. Both charges
will be heard on the same day.
The complaining witnesses are Morris
Siminoff, a brother of Aaron and Louis,
who has a cloak factory at 122S Market
street, and Toby Roberts, a brother-in
law.
In connection with the charpes there is
a story full of interest and not devoid of
its humorous features. Aaron is a manu
facturer of cloaks at 211 Sutter street,
and when seen yesterday he spoke frank
ly of the troubles of the family.
"I used to work for my brother Mor
ris," he said, "but left him recently, as
he did not carry out his pledges to me.
He blamed me for taking cloth from his
factory and selling it to get money for
drink, which was untrue. My brother
Louis met him on Golden Gate avenue
Sunday, April 24, and they had a mix
up over what he had said about me. I
happened to pass on my bicycle at the
time and jumped off and separated them.
Then Morris struck me and I punched
him.
"I have to wear a wig, as I lost my
hair through sickness and Morris em
ployed three men to do me up. He offered
to give them $20 if they stole my wig and |
blackened my eyes; $30 if they also broke j
my nose, and $100 if they broke my neck, i
Morris deposited $30 with the bartender I
in Kapp & Street's saloon, which was to )
be paid to the three men on carrying out
their contract.
"The three men came to me and told
me what Morris had done. I gave them
an old wig of mine and it was arranged
that I should paint my eyes black and
streak my face with red ink and go where j
Morris could see me. Then the three men j
went to him with the old wig and told ,
him how they had done me up. He tore i
the wig to pieces and was so delighted !
that he took them to Kapp & Street's :
and handed them the $30. They will ap- i
pear as witnesses for me when the cases
come on.
"Last Sunday Roberts met my brother j
and me on Golden Gate avenue and he b*Â»- I
gan to abuse me. I had a badge of tfie I
national colors in my button hole and
Roberts said that I was a nice American '
to wear that rag in my buttonhole, think- i
Ing it would make me all right. H>j had I
a large pair of pliers in his hand and he j
raised them up as if* he was going to |
strike me. My brother jumped in and ]
they rolled onto the street. I separated j
them and he again made for me with the !
pliers and I punc-hed him."
Aaron intends fo take action against his I
brother, Morris, for employing the three '
men to assault him, and a lively time is
expected before the whole affair is settled
In court.
Sentence Suspended.
When Clay M. Powell, the pharmacy
student, appeared before Judge Campbell
yesterday for sentence for falling: to pro
vide for his young child, his father asked
the Judge to defer sentence till Saturday,
ac he was endeavoring to effect a recon
ciliation between the young man and nU
wife. Tbo request was granted.
HUNTINGTON
FLIRTS WITH
THE FACTS
Spends Another Day
Dodging Pertinent
Questions.
Frequently Troubled With
Remarkable JLapses
of Memory.
Says He Enjoys the Associa
tion With the Railroad
Commission.
POSES AS A BENEFACTOR.
OnÂ« More Day Spent In Trying to As
certain the Cost of Southern
Pacifio Lines.
Collis P. Hunttnpton was In a communi
cative mood yesterday. He told the Rail
road Commission almost everything it did
not want to know, and just to show that
he was a good fellow he promised to try
and refresh his memory about a few
things concerning which the commission
has spent three days in trying to get some
information.
The railroad magnate's memory seems
to be wonderfully retentive in some spots
and sadly deficient in others. For in
stance, ho remembered that before the
lines of the Southern Pacific Company
were built the stage fare from Lob An
geles to Tucson was J6O, but he could not
tell within $40,000,000 the amount of the
capital stock of the cor-oration of which
he Is the head and front. When correct
ed on the latter point he begged the par
don of the commission by saying that the
figures had slipped his mind. He was
very positive, however, about the amount
of the stage fare, and he even volunteered
to go Into particulars concerning other
matters ante-dating the dawn of civiliza
tion In the far West for the purpose of
showing, he said, that had It not been for
his guiding hand the inhabitants of the
Golden State would still be wallowing in
the muck of semi-barbarism.
lhe Commissioners wanted to know the
cost and present value of the Southern
Pacific lines, so they renewed their ap
peal to Uncle Collis to enlighten them on
the subject. This he was quite willing to
do, and he said so. He accordingly told
them what it cost per mile to build rail
ways in Englasd, France, Germany,
Russia and Australia, and added a
few interesting figures concerning the
bonded Indebtedness of all foreign
lines. This was highly entertaining,
but not exactly to the point. When
reminded of this the witness got
down to business and told the Commis
sioners all about the difficulties to be
encountered in building a railroad
through the State of New York, to which
account he added a chapter for each of
the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky.
"But how much money was spent In
building the lines of the Southern Pacific
Company in this State?" persisted Chair
man L.a Rue.
"Now that Is a difficult question to an
swer off hand," replied the magnate, "but
I will do all that I can to assist you in
finding out. You must understand that
the Contract and Finance Company un
dertook to build and equip the lines for
all of the bonds and stock of the roads.
You know the amount of the bonds and
stock, so there you have the cost ol the
roads."
"We don't care about uÂ«e bonds and
stock. What we want you to tell us is
how much cash was actually expended
in the construction of these roads. Will
you do this?"
"To be sure I will. At least I will do all
that I can to aid you In determining the
facts. There are so many things that en
ter into the Item of cost that you can well
understand that the matter is adlfflcult one.
These roads were built a great many years
ago, and I presume that the original con
tracts have been destroyed. If I had
thought they would ever have been need
ed I would gladly have preserved them,
for It is my dsire to conceal nothing from
this commission or from the public. I
would like to say. if the commission will
permit me. that these roads have been
a great thing for California. The Gov
ernment was also very anxions that we
should build the Southern Pacific line. It
has been a great thing for the Govern
ment."
"But what did the road cost?"
"I don't think I could tell at this mo
ment within a million dollarsâ even sev
eral million dollars. You will understand,
of course, that wt> were entitled at least
to a fair days wares for our work. I am '
sure that I put in many days of hard '
work."
"That is all very well." said T,a Rue.
"but I don't see that we are making much
progress with this inquiry-"
"But we are having a good time," re
plied Huntington, as he leaned back In his
chair and complacently stroked his beard.
Huntington was asked if he was willing
that the cost of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley road should be taken
as a basis upon which to figure the cost
of the Southern Pacific lines.
"Not at all. Not at all." was the quick
response. "It is my belief that that road
was built for fun. I don't do business for j
fun a.s a regular thing."
"What was realized by the Southern
Pacific Company for the sale of outstand
ing bonds?"
r'lr 'I am sure I don't know. If I can bÂ© of

TAKEN FOB SPIES.
Two Visitors From the Country Get
Themselves Arrested.
Through a foolish desire to wear false
mutton-chop whiskers Joseph V. Dav
ner, a saloon keeper at Sunol, got himself
and friend, M. de Vecas, a beet planter at
Pleasanton. arrested at the ferry yester
day morning on suspicion of being Span
ish spies.
They first aroused the suspicion of the
conductor on the train from Pleasanton
and some of the passengers, and when
they left the train to board the ferry
boat the conductor telephoned to the
harbor police. When they reached tho
city Sergeant A van and Policeman Smith
placed them under arrest and they were
taken to police headquarters. Chief Uef>s
heard their story and upon having it con
firmed he released them from custody.
Davner said: "I wore the whiskers that
I might look like a sport, but I guess J
won't play sport any more." His whis
kers were confiscated.

WANT THE MEN
TO COME IN
Social Activities Are Discussed
at the Woman's Con
gress.
Congress to Clos* To-Morrow in a
Blaze of Intellectual
Glory.
Badinage went back and forth on the
floor of the Woman's Congress yesterday
afternoon. There were mirth and merri
ment, and man. whom all heretofore
believe to be the bete noir of the assem
blage, was the gratifying source of It all.
The maiority of the ladies want to in
vite man In, to make him an active mem
ber of their clubs and practically, as well
as theoretically, show him their respect,
affection and regard and incidentally tneir
equality.
They don't want any more women s
clubs and men's clubs. They want men
and women clubs, that is with one ex
ception. Miss Manning, and she is proba
bly the exception that proves the rule.
Miss Manning feels there are already
too many men identified with the fair
fame of the congress, altogether too
many men on the programme and equally
too many accorded seats of honor on the
platform.
"We have succeeded in establishing suc
cessful woman's clubs," proclaimed Miss
Manning. "At first man sneered at us
and now that we ride on the top wave
why should we call man In to run it?"
Afiss Manning's question was taken up
and the "floor" was soon in the midst of
a merry debate. A representative of a
St. Louis woman's club made a witty
plea for man's admission, and she based
her belief of man's particular utility on
the fact that the Creator probably in
tended him for some use. An Indiana
lady, a visiting club woman from New
Orleans and many others took up the
question, and if a majority always wins
man will soon be coaxed to join woman's
clubs. Mrs. J. W. Orr's paper, "The In
fluence of Women's Clubs on Social Life."
was the first paper of the afternoon.
Mrs. Orr traced the work of woman's
clubs from the beginning to the present
day, pointing out graphically their growth
and benefits.
The lady said In part: "Women have
found encouragement, strength and
power in association with one another.
The club is the preparatory- school for
women horn, too soon for college life.
Clubs are only strong as they are a unit
in action. Clubs have given an impetus
to the minds of women. There is no more
beneficial social force than the club
movement among women. In them they
are learning the significance of that
phrase, "The solidarity of human inter
ests and the lessons of tolerance.' They
are learning to be less personal and more
Individual.
"Busy, bracing and brilliant are the
three cnaracterlstlca of the modern club
woman. Club women want to come into
closer touce with her husband's inter
ests. The woman who has no interest out
side her home is' not a well woman.
Knowledge gained in club life makes her
a more enlightened mother, a more com
panionable wife."
Prefessor G. Kriehn closed the after
noon session with his paper on "Ameri
can Amusement?."
Professor Kriehn divided his paper fnto
first the enjoyment of little things in life,
second the enjoyment of the beauties of
nature and third the enjoyment of the
beauties of art. The professor deplored
the fact that the rapid life of the aver
age American prevented him having any
amusement. He contended that the
proper use of pleasure made the glory of
Athens and Florence. "America can do
likewise," he said. "She has enough
money to do ft and she must foster it be
fore it is too late."

SOMETHING
YOU NEED
The usual form of life insur-
ance policy provides for pay-
ment at the death of the in-
sured to those who have been
named as beneficiaries. An
endowment policy is also so
â¢ payable, with the further pro-
vision that it shall be paid
the insured himself if he sur-
vive some specified fixed
term of years. The Life Op-
tion Endowment Policy sold
by The Mutual Life of New
York presents further advan-
tages of a scope not reached
by any contract offered by
other companies. j
Endowments usually cease
at maturity; the endowment
in question does not. Of
course it may so be treated,
and the face of the policy
with all accumulated surplus
be converted into immediate 1
cash. But the peculiar merit
of this policy is that at its
maturity the holder is entitled
to any one of the following
valuable options:
(i) He may draw at once*
the full cash value of policy
plus surplus; or
(2) He may take the face of)
his policy in cash, allowing
the accumulated surplus to
stand as an annuity, yielding
him a steady income ; or
(3) He may draw this sur-
plus in cash, and convert the
face value of his original
policy into an equal amount
of fully paid-up insurance,
participating in the Com-
pany's dividends, and draw-
ing an annuity of z /t% x ; '
(4) Or he may so convert
both the face of the policy
and the surplus, receiving his
pro rata share of the annual
dividends and also the %}&s
annuity.

Mills Introduces Amend
ment in the Senate
Without Success.
m
Adoption of a Joint Resolution
in Relation to.Succession
to the Presidency.
Pettigrow Accuse* the Northwestern
of Falsifying the Returns of
the Sioux City Railroad.
Call Office, Rlggrs House,
Washington, May 4.
Quite unexpectedly a brief but sharp i
debate was precipitated in the Senate
to-day in the income tax proposition.
The resolution proposing an amend- ,
ment to the constitution of the United ,
! States in relation to the succession to
the Presidency was under discussion.
Mills of Texas proposed an amendment i
in the form of a new section
Intended to authorize Congress
to lay a tax on incomes in such j
form as to meet the requirements of j
the decision of the Supreme Court. He j
was sharply criticized for endeavoring ,
to place such a rider on a resolution
which practically all Senators fovored,
! but stood his ground and insisted upon
I a vote on his amendment. The amend
i ment was defeated (32 to 29). all the
Republicans voting against the amend
: ment and all the Democrats, except
Caffery of Louisiana, together with
the Populists and Silver Republicans,
! voting in favor of it. The joint reso
: lution which was adopted reads as fol
lows:
In all cases not provided for by article 2,
clause 5 of the constitution .where there
I is no person entitled to discharge the
I duties of the office of President the same
shall devolve upon the Yice-Presldent.
i The Congress may by law provide for the
1 ease where there is no person entitled to
hold the office of President or Vice-Presi
dent declaring what officer shall act as
'< President and such officer shall act ac
cordingly until the disability shall be re
moved or a President shall be elected.
The conference report cm the fortifi
cations appropriation bill was agreed
to.
Gear of lowa, chairman of the Pacific
Railroads Committee, called up and ob
tained consideration for a bill authorizing
â  a committee,' consisting of the Secretary
of the Treasury, the Secretary of the In
terior and the Attorney-General to effect
an adjustment between the United States
and the Sioux City and Pacific Railway
Company in relation to certain bonds
issued by the United States in aid of the
j construction of the railroad. An amend
! ment to the bill offered by Harris of
j Kansas provides that the commission may
not accept less in settlement of the Gov
! ei.iment's claim than the principal of the
I bonds issued in aid of the construction of
the railroad. J
Morgan of Alabama delivered an ex
tended speech upon the measure, in the
course of which he indicated the great
importance of the measure as a prece
! dent. .' ''.^
At the conclusion of Morgan s speech
Cockrell of Missouri secured the passage
of the following resolution:
"That the Secretary of the Treasury is
hereby directed to make a report showing
I the coining value of the silver bullion in
I the treasury and the amount of the
! seigniorage and the amount of the exist
ing treasury notes Issued in its purchase,
and the amount of standard sflver dollars
j coined under the act of July 14, 1870, and
I the amount of the seigniorage and the
j amount of treasury notes redeemed in
such dollars and retired."
Harris, continuing the debate upon the
pending railroad bill, ur^ed the adoption
of his amendment as the very least that
Congress could do in protecting the in
terests of the country-
Pettigrew of South Dakota said that the
Sioux City Railroad was a link so Im
portant to the Northwestern system that
I if the Government should Insist upon the
payment of its principal claim in full,
! about $1,600,000. the Northwestern would
pay it. He declared that the Northwest
ern officials had for years falsified the re
turns from the Sioux City Railroad with
the plan in view of securing the road at
a nominal price. He said he proposed
to offer an amendment to the amendment
providing that not less than $3,000,000
should be accepted by the commission in
settlement of the Government's claim.
At 3:35 p. m. the Senate went Into exec
utive session, and when the doors were
reopened Hawley presented the report of
the conferees of ine'bill suspending the
! law relating to the purchase of supplies
jby the Quartermaster's Department of
: the army.
Hawley, after the reading of the report,
moved that it be agreed to.
Morgan thought the proposed law was
j unwise, imprudent and unnecessary. He
i said that it was most extraordinary that
j bureau officers should be authorized to go
: into the open market and purchase un
i limited supplies. After a brief discus
! sion of the report it was laid over until
i to-morrow. Then at 5 o'clock the Senate
1 adjourned. _^_^_________

PROFESSOR GRIGGS GIVES
HIS IDEA OF PATRIOTISM.
Not Only Love of Country, but Con
sideration for All Man
kind.
SAN RAFAEL, May 4.â The educational
heavy-weights had another inning to-day
at the Teachers' Institute. Among those
who addressed .ne large number present
at both the morning and afternoon ses
sion were Professor Griggs of Stanford,
Professor Edwards of Berkeley, City Su
perintendent of Schools J. W. McCly
monds of Oakland and E. W. Davis, sec
retary of the Board of Regents of the
State University.
Professor F. W. Wright, the first lec
turer, gave an interesting address on the
subject, '"Arithmetic in the Elementary
Schools." Professor G. C. Edwards eluci
dated how arithmetic should be taught,
and Professor MeClymonds followed with
the theme, "Practical Number Work."
All these topics were discussed by the
institute.
After recess Miss Etta Shaver rendered
a vocal solo, followed by a brief speech
on "Direct and Indirect Ethical Instruc
tion" by Professsor Griggs. Professor
Edwards spoke of "Algebra ana Geometry
in the High Schools. He was in favor
of their introduction even if the names
had to be changed to overcome existing
prejudice.
Professor Davis spoke on "I Told You
So"â a very broad theme. Professor
Griggs excited great interest by his" clear
and incisive treatment of the subject,
"The Training in American Citizenship."
In his opinion this training should be on
broad lines, and it is wrong for anybody
to favor his own country in am- affair in
which that country's course would mili
tate against the best interests of the rest
of the civilized world or humanity gen
erally. This delineation of patriotism
seemed to meet with considerable com
mendation.
HONOR A LEADER
OF THEIR CHURCH
Catholic Dignitaries Participate
in a Celebration at New-
York.
Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of Aroh
taisshop Corrigan's Elevation to
the Episcopate.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, May 4.â Not since the
laying of the cornerstone of St. Pat
rick's Cathedral in 1869 has there been
a celebration among Roman Catholics
of this country equal in ceremony and
magnificence to that begun to-day to
celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the elevation to the episcopate of the
Most Reverend Michael Augustine Cor
rigan. There was a pontifical high
mass at 10 o'clock this morning at the
cathedral, the silver chimes were rung
for the first time, and there waa a pro
cession of notable Catholic clergymen,
with a guard of honor of 500 cadets.
Every clergyman taking part in the
mass was a dignitary of the church.
The Papal delegate, Archbishop Mar
tinelli was present. A grand orches
tra, selected singers and enlarged
chorus supplied the music.
A certificate of cancellation for the
debt of $300,000 on the Dunwoodie Sem
inary, conceived and begun by the
Archbishop, was handed to him, it
having been raised by popular sub
scription in a few months.
The clergymen for the mass were
chosen to represent every year of the
Bishop's episcopate. T4je vestments
were made of cloth of silver and em
broidery of gold, surpassing in magni
ficence the remarkable vestments al
ready in St. Patrick's vestry, some of
which cost $5000 apiece. A grand ban
quet followed the pontifical mass, at
tended by 500 priests. To-morrow there
will be a service at the Cathedral by
6000 children to end the two days' cele
bration.
The Cathedral was superbly deco
rated. One feature attracting attention
was an electric illumination immediate
ly over the grand altar. It consisted of
the words "Ecce Saceresdes Magnus"
(Behold the Great Priest), with an il
luminated mitre over it. Shields in her
aldic colors of the dioceses of Brook
lyn, Newark, Albany, Rochester, Buf
falo and Syracuse were placed at either
side of the grand altar.
ROUTINE BUSINESS
BEFORE THE HOUSE.
Several Features in the Alaska Land
Bill Eliminated by the
Conferees.
WASHINGTON, May 4.â The House to
day adopted the conference report upon
the fortifications bill. The remainder of
the session was consumed with the con
sideration of the Alaskan land bill and
a resolution for the repeal of an act pro
hibiting the passage of importations in
bond through the territory of the United
States into the "free zone" of Mexico.
The latter was passed, but the Alaskan
measure went over.
The conference report upon the act ex
tending the Homestead laws and provid
ing for the right of way for railroads in
Alaska was called up by Lacey of lowa.
The conference eliminated the features
formerly in the bill providing for the ap
pointment of a commission to consider the
North Atlantic fishing and other trade re
lations controversies with Canada, upon
which the House on Monday rejected the
report upon a point of order.
Lacey explained the bill as reported
from conference. He then moved the
previous question, but Pitney, who had
opposed the passage of the bill without
extended debate, raised the point of no
quorum.
Lacey immediately moved to adjourn
and an adjournment was taken at 4:20
o'clock.
Beindeer Dying Rapidly.
6EATTL.E, May 4.â Captains D. L. Bral

Government Alaskan relief expedition, re
turned to-day and immediately left for
Washington. They state that the Govern
ment herd of reindeer is rapidly dying
on the Chilcoot Mountains and not more
than one-half of the original herd sur
vives. The expedition has proven a com
plete failure, owing to lack of natural
food for the animals to subsist on.

NEW YORK SUN
LOSES A POINT
Is Denied an Injunction
Against the Associ
ated Press.
Conflict of Evidence the Ground
of Judge Lacombe's
Ruling.
News Corporation May Prevent Its
Members Patronizing Outside
Agenaiea.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 4.â Judge La
combe, in the United States Circuit
Court, has denied the motion of the
New York Sun for a temporary injunc
tion pendente lite, restraining the As
sociated Press from prohibiting its
i newspapers from buying or using the
Sun service. Judge Lacombe, in his
opinion, says:
ThÂ« mbb at bar is evidently not one
arising under the anti-trust act of 1890.
Complainant has brouerht a suit in equity
for an injunction, but by the terms of the
anti-trust act that form of relief is con-
the act of 1890
(as such act is construed by the Supreme
I Court), created a wholly new offense, un
' known to the law as it was then admin
i istered in the courts, and which had been
committed, probably daily, ever since this
country began to have any trade at all.
It was quite to be expected that Con
gress would provide special remedies for
the violations of the terms of this stat-
I ute and to such remedies all persons
claiming to be aggrieved by acts which
are offfnses only because this statute
makes them so should be restricted.
For a similar reason complainant cannot
maintain this suit in equity under the
New York statute concerning agreements
or combinations in restraint of trade.
That statute empowers the Attorney
General to enforce it by suit in equity.
There are averments in the complaint
that the acts of defendant and its officers
by which complainant is aggrieved are
the result of a malicious combination to
injure complainant without just cause or
excuse, inspired by i.l will and a deliber
ate intention to harm the complainant
without reference to any lawful exorcise
of defendant's rights. But there is a
conflict of evidence as to the facts as
serted, defendants vigorously denying in
their affidavits the averment of the com
plainant; and it is not the practice in this
circuit to grant preliminary injunctions
when there is such conflict as to the es
sential facts. Such relief must be sought
at final hearing, when the testimony of
conflicting affidavits may be submitted to
the test of cross-examination.
CRAZED SPANIARD RUNS
LOOSE AT STOCKTON.
Threatens to Murder a Woman and
Has a Hard Tussle With an
Officer.
STOCKTON, May 4.â A message came
late this afternoon to the police office
from Weber avenue and East streets,
stating that a Spaniard had tried to kill
a whole family. The patrol wagon was
driven thither post haste, with Officer
Craig aboard. He found the supposed
murderer at the corner of Main street,
and that he had threatened to kill Mrs.
Christ at the next corner. The fellow went
to the house and asked fur something to
eat. When refused he made a rush for
the woman, exclaiming. "I'm a Spaniard,
and I'll kill the whole family."
Mrs. Christ shut the door in his face.
Officer Craig had a hard tussle with the
fellow in the patrol wagon. The Span
iard called the officer a Republican, and
started in to choke him. The policeman
got a deadly grip on the murderous Span
iard, however, and settled his case in
short order, laying him out on the bottom
of the vehicle. The belligerent bit one of
the officer's fingernail's on! in the en
counter.
It was found that the man had been in
an atvlum once and had gone daft again
over his country's troubles. He was re
turned to the madhouse.

TWO MURDERS AS THE
RESULT OF A QUARREL
Employes on a Kansas Ranch Shot
and Fatally Wounded by a
Former Companion.
TOPEKA, Kans., May 4.â A special
to the Capitol from Maple Hill states
that Edwin Franzcon and Gus Carbon,
employes at F wler's ranch, two miles
west of that place, -were fatally shot
this evening by John Thomas, a former
employe at the ranch. Thomas is said
to have shot the men as a result of
some trouble about a woman.
Thomas went to Fowler's ranch at
about 9 o'clock and shot Franzcon with
a Winchester rifle. He then returned
to the hotel at Maple Hill, borrowed an
overcoat and rented a horse from a liv
er- stable. He then went to the ranch
and shot Carbon. Still later he can.c to
the ranch a third time and took a shot
at the crowd which had gathered in
the vicinity.
Thomas has not returned the horse
nor the overcoat. Descriptions have
been telegraphed all over the State and
the trains are being watched. It is
supposed, however, that he made his
escape on horseback. A posse has been
organized and is scouring the country.

ing of ten professional nurses, were hela
at the Sorosis Club last evening, under
thÂ« direction of Mrs. W. Harrington, the
Presklent of the hospital. The little hall
in the rear of the club rooms, where the
exercises were held, was one blaze of
lltrht and artistic decoration. In honor of
the occasion, and pleasant smiles and
sympathetic words were tendered the new
messengers of mercy on every hand
Many eloquent addresses were delivered
in eulogium of the noble career of the
nurse her duties, her cares and the abso
fme necessity of her ministrations to. Mlf
i fC AmonK U t"i'e n pro'minent speakers were Dr.
Henry Iherman and Dr. G. C. Adams.
Who outlines the nurse's profession which
has for its foundation and basis self
sacrifice In the caro and welfare of
Ot The S 'young ladies were dressed Ib pure
white wearing the nurse's cap. and Inci
dentally the good-natured and pleasing
smile which does more to characterize her
nrotVssion than any uniform that custom
might dictate to single her out as a mes
senger of love and mercy among the gen
eral horde of mankind.
Before the farewell prayer was deliv
ered by Dr Adams Mrs. Harrington, who
seemed and in fact was, the leading
â¢^Dtrit <>f the occasion, as a defense against
the so-called impropriety of woman tak
intf up her position on the battlefield oe
side the injured and the dying, claimed
that the present generation, although in
clined to lean toward this opinion, would
Inf. ire long discard it as a sophistry and
clamor through urgent necessity for the
young nurse to care and minister to the
i iniured. sick and dying soldiers of the na
tion who have gone forth to seek their
i rlpfith in the yellow fever stricken dis
< trk-ts of Cuba.
As the diplomas were distributed a
magnificent floral donation was presented
with them to each graduate. Those who
received the sheep, skins were: Miss
Romie W. Caldweil, Miss Ethel Sherman,
Miss Margaret Chappell. Miss Annie Fox,
Mlsa \delaide Lundborg, Miss Ada Rust,
Miss Nellie M. Ker. Miss Daisy Steves,
Miss Mary Leonard and Miss Evelyn

THE WAR AND MONEY.
ATTITUDE OF NEW YORK BAXKS RE
GARDING THE PROPOSED BOND ISSUE.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"Naturally, under existing conditions, atten
tion is being attracted to the money market.
The presence here of the Secretary of the
Treasury has suggested the probable early In- j
troduction of a loan on the market. Although
there Is no probability of any large amount of
money being immediately needed by the Gov
ernment, yet the Secretary is evidently Im
pressed with the desirableness of ample appro
priations being made as early as possible. Be
tween now and August is usually a period of
ease In the loan market. Three to four months j
hence, however, money will be wanted for the
interior in large amounts, and important Treas
ury negotiations coming concurrently with that
movement might cause a conflict between the
two currents of demand detrimental to each.
F"r that reason the banks are in accord with
,ry Gage as to the importance of effect-
Ing the negotiation of the new loans with the
least possible delay. This is among the fac
tors of the future already discounted. The
banks are putting themselves in a posiuon for
contracting lor larte amounts of the new
This is having some influence upon
j'-ount market an - on time loans; but I
s.-e no reason to apprehend that such effects
will t>e at all serious In their bearing on the
general business of the country. Within the
â¢l weeks the loans and discounts of the
local banks have been reduced $67,000,000, which
how much the banks have already done
in anticipation of the special financial demands
that have now arisen. It Is not to be con
cluded, however, that this contraction of credit
has fallen principal. - upon commercial borrow
ers, for as a matter of fact a large portion of
[Uidation has arisen from the settlement
of various syndicate operations to which the !
bank- very large advances. 1 have |
i.i believe that the banks have entire
confidence in the financial situation and are
prepared to give all consideration to the wants
of their customers.
The absorption of money by the Government
In the immediate future can only be through a
war loan, in some shape to be designated here
after by Congress, and money can be made j
tin nt only temporarily in connection therewith, i
that Is to say during the period required for
drawing It in and paying it over to the Gov
ernmeni depositories. The Government's need
of money will be such as to cause it to be
paid out almost as fast as received for sup
piles for the army and navy and for the pay
ment of salaries of officers and men. Besides,
a good deal of the money already In the
ireasufY will also be disbursed, so that as a
matter "of fact inst. .1.1 ot money being taken i
out of circulation It will he increased. During
the war (iovernment securities are likely t<> be
illy Increased, but railroad securities will !
There will be no time, however, that a j
Government bond will go below the basis of j
I 'â¢- it cent interest, in my opinion, even in ;
the event of a naval reverse, which, though
possible, is not likely. The use of money for j
business purposes will be curtailed more or !
less during the war. as no new enterprises will i
be entered into. Business, therefore, for s..me
little timÂ» will be apt to settle down to a stere
otyped condition conducted on conservative!
lln^s. The demand for money will diminish i
instead of Increase for some time to come. It j
in only wnen people undertake big schemes
that money is In demand In large blocks and
not when people contract their operations.
The war will be entirely an external one â not
Internal. It will not stop railroads from run
ning nor mills from manufacturing. Our 75,
of people wl have to be clothed and
fed. and that alone insures legitimate husi- j
ness dealings all over the country. Our cotton
Will be exported, and so will all other of our I
products that have a foreign market in neutral !
ships assigned -er to neutral owners, thereby '
sf.-iifing the property from risk of seizure and â 
confiscation by the enemy.
Honeyed Institutions will be unwise In
contracting tim" loans: as such a policy would
tend to make money tight; and that might too |
easily b* L used as an argument In CongreFs ;
that there Is not money enough; in which case :
the tendency would be for Congress to legis
late for an Increase In greenback issues in ;
place of a bond Issue. Should this be done
tt would be a very serious matter.
EXPLANATION.
The arrow fifes with the wind. The top fig

amount of rainfall or of melted snow In Inches
and hundredths during the- past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms,' or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" â¢ means . high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers .to low pressure
and is usually preceded and accompanied by
cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south alone the cast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With â  a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Califor
nia coast, warmer weather may be expected in
summer and colder weather In winter. The re
verse of these conditions will produce an oppo
site result.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May Liverpool cables started
the wheat market here on the upgrade at to
j day's opening. The English market was up
4%d on near by futures, while the Paris market
was reported 31 centimes lower. The latter re
port proved to be 20 centimes out of the way,
however, and caused plenty of selling he.c.
But the fact remained that France had only
enough wheat in .sight to iJLJt two weeks. The
country's consumption Is 5,000,000 bushels per
week and their own crop will dot be available
j until August- Rumors were current that Ger
many and Austria would also abolish their
Import duty. Letter reported foreign bid at 5
cents advance over yesterday's offers. July
started l%c higher at 96Â®-96%c. The market
eased off immediately to 9614 C. Scalpers were
in a bearish mood and put out short lines with
out hesitation. Closing cables showed Liver
pool up for the day from 3d for Ma/ to 4%d
tor July and spot wheat up from Id C it No. 1
northern to Sd for California^. Rumors of
large cash sales to France kept the pit In a
very nervous state, but up to 13:38 p. m. the
market was in a comparatively normal condi
tion with July selling around 96 and May at
$1 24. Shorts made occasional efforts to cover
and each time they found offerings growing
scarcer. Half an hour before the close Leiier
calmly announced that he had just sold 500,
0000 bushels of cash wheat for export, presum
! ably to France, at an advance of 5 cents over
yesterday's figures. He accompanied the news
with heavy buying orders through his brokers.
They bid May up from 124 to 131. Leiter's ef
forts to secure more May wheat which is
equivalent to the cash article threw the b^ars
Into a panic. July Jumped by eighths and quar
ters from 96 to 98%. The close was at 89%, a
net rain of. 4 c<:iits. May closed at 130, a net
I gain of 9c. Leiter's tactics to-day apparently
show him to be In complete mastery, over May
wheat at least, and If. as is greatly believed,
there is still a large short interest in May, the
bears may have fancy losses to-morrow. May
corn opeied higher, but ruled heavy until near
| the end. Shorts bought eagerly when wheat
I got excited, closing the market at the top.
1 July gained %c.
Oats were dull but firm, July closing %o
higher.
Provisions crened strong but dull. The ad
vance in grain caused prices to recover and
closed with udvances of 16c in pork, 10c in

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. May 4.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
I wool market: There is a decidedly better feel
ing in the market. With most dealers there
has been next to no improvement in the amount
of business actually transacted, but inquiries
have been more numerous and the bids for
wool have been at figures . nearer the sellers
quotations. A week ago offers were made ror
wool as much as 1 cent below the price, Dut
to-day bids are made up to within % cent of
the price. War news has Imparted a semblance
at least of activity to the market. It Is surn
cient to say of prices that they are still more
or lees nominal, though considerably nearer a
fixed basis than a week ago.
The sales of the week amount to 695.000
pounds domestic and 435,000. pounds foreign.
1 making a total of 1.126.000 pounds, against a
total of 632.000 pounds for the previous week.

A most enthusiastic meeting of the
woman's executive committee of the
California Red Cross Society was held
at the residence of Mrs. John F. Mer
rill, 1732 Washington street, yesterday
afternoon. The rooms were adorned
with beautiful roses and flowering al
monds, sent by McClellan Bros., in com
pliment to the Red Cross Society.
There was a short but very animated
discussion as to the purposes of the so
ciety, and its connection with, the Na
tional Red Cross Association was defi
nitely announced. Secretary Hanson
having forwarded to Washington noti
fication of the establishment of the
California branch.
The following sub-committees were \

berg.

tee and Mrs. Florence Moore and Mrs.
James S. V.'ethered were appointed re
cording and corresponding secretaries.
Mrs. I. L.->\vr;herg accompanied her
signature with a donation of $20.
The following communication from
Dr. J. B. D. Middl^ton was read.
Surgeon-General's Office,
San Francisco, May 3, 1898.
The petition being referred to me
for an expression of opinion by sev
eral ladies of the Red Cro3s Society,
I will say that the movement is an
excellent one and meets with my ap
proval.
J. B. D. MIDDLETON,
Deputy Surgeon-General, 0". S. A.
"This disposes," said Mrs. Harring
ton, "of the objection raised by some
that the National Government is pre
pared to fully equip our soldiers who
Jiave been mustered in this morning.
The Government provides but th.;
barest necessities. It is our duty, and
I think the mater should receive our
attention at once, to see that the boys
\yho go to fight for us, while we re
main at home in comfort and safety,
should be provided for to the best of
our ability."
"In the East," said Mrs. Dimond,
"they're far to advance of us. New
York has given a million, Pennsylva- ;
nia has given a million, and other j
States are giving smaller amounts, but !
In proportion. Our men ought to be as
well taken care of as those of any
State in the Union. In my opinion, we ,
should become auxiliary to the Na- j
tional Red Cross Association, but until ;
we hear that we are accepted at Wash- ;
ington, let us provide for our own."
"I grow weary," said Mrs. J. G. |
Clark, "of the conservative opinions of ;
the business man, who is too old to go
to fight, and too indifferent to care
whether those who go to fight for him j
ar.d for us are properly equipped. Ex- j
perience has taught me the wisdom, !
the necessity of the Red Cross. This j
latest information that our men have i
1 n called out brings the thing home
quickly to us."
"We've got to get to work, and im
mediately," sai.l Mrs. Smedberg. "We
have Dr. Hopkins' word for it that j
mon^y is urgently needed. We have
Dr. Middle-ton's confirmation. As I un
dÂ» -stand it, the National Government
is not prepared to provide the list of
necessities Dr. Hopkins has made pub
lic. The people of California, then,
through the Red Cross Society, will
take this upon themselves."
Among the thirty or forty ladles
present there was a charming willing- j
rup? to serve on committees and in any 'â 
way be of use to the Red Cross So
ciety. Each of the chairmen of the
committees is alread-- busy formulat- '
ing plans, bo that the v. ork may - o on
with all possible celerity.
The Orpheum has been notified that
the Red Cross Society of California ac
cepts gratefully its generous offer to '
give a matinee for the benefit of the i
fund, and asked that it take place as i
soon as possible. It iB the intention of j
the society to raise funds at once so
that should emergency orders come
for the immediate sending off of our
men their most pressing wants shall
be provided for.
Headquarters will be opened within
a day or two at the Claus Spreckels
building, second floor. Secretaries and
officials will be on hand to receive sub- !
scrlptioas, to give information and to j
attend to all other business.
The gentlemen composing the other
half of the executive committee meet
to-day. If they accomplish as much as
the better half did yesterday the Red
Cross Society will start on its merciful
errand &lad of heart, sound of purpose,
sure of success.
ON TO BAKERSFIELD.
Work on the Valley Boad Nearing
Completion at the Southern
End.
Chief Engineer Story of the Valley Road
gives most encouraging reports of the
progress that is being made on the work
all along the line. On the link from the
lake down to Visalia the grading is be
ing pushed right ahead, and already
nearly five miles of the roadbed has been
completed. The same activity is mani
festing itself on the Stockton branch of
the road, and tne long snake-like evidence
of industry is rapidly taking shape and
stretching itself out toward the city.
The approaches to the great Franklin
tunnel are about finished, and it is ex
pected that the beginning of the week will
see the work commenced on the supports
of the tunnel itself, though it may be an
other week or ten days before the actual
boring on the tunnel is commenced. The
contractors have about seventeen months
to finish the job, and while the length of
the work when comp'.eu-d will be nearly
a mile, it is thought that by progressing
at the rate of about six feet a day the
time allowed in the contract will be ample
to finish, not only the big piece of work,
but to complete two smaller tunnels on
the road at either end.
Soon the station at Bakersfield will be
sufficiently complete to transact business
In it. and as the work on the bridge over
Kern River is practically finished with the
exception of laying the tracks over the
structure, it will not be long before pas
sengers will be traveling over the river on
a trestle to disembark at the handsom
est station in that portion of the coun-
In a few days Vice President "Watt will
make a tour of inspection over the entire
line, arriving at Hakersfield in time to
take part in the formalities attending the
completion of his road to that point. He
will be accompanied by other officials con
nected with the Valley Road's offices In
this city.
LIVELY DAY IN WHEAT.
An Advance of More Than Eleven
Cents in Two Days.
The wheat pit was the scene of intense
excitement yesterday. Early Liverpool
advices quoted wheat prices equal to 10
cents advance, as compared with the final
figures of the night before. Paris wbeat
and flour opened at nominal quotations
of the day before. The strong advance
in Liverpool was soon reflected in the
Paris market, which soon showed an ad
vance of fifty centimes. Adued to this
bullishness rumors found their way into
the trade to the effect that Germany and
Italy would follow France in reducing the
duty on wheat. Another report said Rus
sia had officially stopped the export of
wheat from that country- There was bull
news enough in the atmosphere to scare
the most hardened short. On Tuesday
December wheat sold at $1 SV'i. and con
tinued buying by Harry Wise had ad
vanced the price to $1 73. At the close
yesterday his purchases were very large,
running "into many thousanu tons of
wheat. The market opened at $1 65-vs for
December and advanced to $1 69 by noon.
At the afternoon session Wise went into
the pit and took everything offered. The
shorts tried to stand him off. but the more
they sold, the more he wanted. At the
close of the s^-s^ion $^ 71 was the ruling
price, with May at $1 78. Immedtately
after the session closed curb trading be
gan. Bidding by shorts advanced the
price to $1 73 for December, where it held
for the <i - , making a total advance of
11% cents :rom the onening on Tuesday
until the close Wednesday. The extreme
high price quoted for Chicago May wheat
<J1 ",D excited much comment among the
trada These figures have not been
renched since I^BB, when "Hutch"
trimmed the shorts, making them settle
mber wheat at $2 per bushel. The
demand for cargoes afloat is surprisingly
brisk, every day. nouns higher prices.
Spot wheat at Liverpool was quoted at
$2 46 per cental yesterday. The trade an
ticipates strong foreign markets this
morning. Higher prices are looked for.
Barley sympathized with the strength
in wheat early, selliner at $1 32*4 for De
cember. Later an easier feeling overtook
the market, resulting In a reaction to
$1 Sl^. The market acts heavy, the ten
dency seeming downward.

AN IMPOSTOR EXPOSED.
Edward Kelly Is in No Way Con-
nected Witli or Related To the
Kelly Brothers.
Phil C. Kelly and John F. Kelly, who
represented the firm of Kelly Brothers,
dry goods merchants on Sixth street,
some time ago, emphatically deny that
Edward Kelly, sentenced on Monday by
Judge Joachimsen to one year in the
County Jail, is in any way connected with
or related to them. As a matter of fact
investigation shows that he is not.
Edward Kelly has for over a year been
victimizing dry goods and other houses
by representing that he was one of the
above-mentioned Kelly Brothers, and
when he was sentenced Monday for again
working his old game the police unwit
tingly gave out the information that he
was one of the members of the former dry
goods firm. His real name is Osmond E.
Kelly.

Mrs. Gertrude Jones Tells
of Many Unfaithful
Acts.
Four Years Ago She Became
the Bride of a Wealthy
Young Man.
Allegations Mad* That Bring Up
tho Names oT Several
Women.
Oakland Office Sail Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 4.
Gertrude Kellogg Jones has asked that
she be separated legally from the husband
whom she married just four years ago.
In April, 18&4, Ernest N. Jones and Gert
rude Kellogg, both of whom occupied
places in local society as well as across
the bay, were married in San Francisco,
the occasion being one of the swell events
of the season.
After the bridal tour the youns folks
took up their residence in a handsome
home at Twentieth and Franklin streets,
and here two children were born, one of
whom is now llftecn months old and the
oth-jr less than that number of weeks.
Soon after the marriage suggestions
that all was not as it should be in the
Jones household were whispered about,
and as the months passed by it was
known that these rumors had some
foundation. However, according to the
wife's story, at the end of the first year
her husband began to show a desire to
avoid his home and to seek other com
pany.
For three years domestic harmony has
gradually given place to discord and un
pleasantness, and for some time their
relations have been productive of so much
unhappiness that the young wife decided
to sue for a divorce. Her complaint con
tains many serious allegations, and the
names of several women are freely used.
In one instance Mrs. Jones makes men
tion of a little courting carried on by her
husband with a lady of this city, and the
complaint states that to further his ends
he used the name of H. M. Forester of
San Francisco.
Both husband and wife have property
and Mrs. Jones alleges that her nusband
has a valuable estate in this city as well
as in Berkeley and she seeks substantial
alimony, absolute separation and the cus
tody of the two children. Her personal
property guarantees her an income of $30
per month. It is understood that the case
will be bitterly contested by the husband,
Ernest N. Jones.

COURTS TO DETERMINE.
City Auditor Snow Refuses to Draw
a Warrant for Owen Rooney.
OAKLAND, May City Auditor Snow
has refused to draw a warrant to reim
burse Owen Rooney for taxes paid the
city. His claim of $1000 passed Monday
night by the City Council was declared
lllegral by City Attorney Dow, and the
Auditor will allow him to defend the case
in the courts if Rooney wants his money
bad enough to sue for it. ..
Mr. Dow, in discussing the matter,
said: "It was clearly the Intention of the
charter-framers that the western boun
dary should be at the three-fathom l line,
and under that interpretation the moie
would be Inside the city. If the line of
the ship channel, as laid down by the
Supreme Court, should be held to be the
western boundary of the city, it would bo
impossible for the western and southern
lines of the cit- to meet, as the northern
line is in deep water in the middle of the
estuary and the western line would have
to terminate at the line of low tide. This
would leave the city in an absurd position
as far as boundaries were concerned."

A Breach of Etiquette That May Lead
to Unpleasantness for a Few

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 4.
Colonel Fairbanks would not have felt
very highly honored had he walked into
the recreation room of Company F this
morning. Some members of this company
are not satisfied that they are not already
blazing away at the Spaniards or among
this nation's honored dead. 'j.ney en
rolled themselves for the purpose of going
to war, and to war they want to go.
For nearly two weeks they have been
expecting daily a call to the front, but it
has not yet come, and their early enthusi
asm is being succeeded by impatience and
a touch of disappointment. In some man
ner or other these aggressive members of
the company believe that the colonel of
the Fifth Regiment is responsible for the
delay. They argue that had he properly
represented the anxiety of his men to
rush into war that they would have been
by this time regulars in the Lnited States
After the announcement made yesterday
that the National Guard of San Francisco
would muster at once and would to-day
proceed to the Presidio en route to Ma
nila it was fully expected that orders
would arrive this morning ordering the
Oakland companies to do likewise. Sev
eral officers and men gathered at the ar
mory, but only to be disappointed. The
idea that Colonel Fairbanks is responsi
ble for the delay prevailed so strongly
with a few of the members that they
turned the colonel's large portrait toward
the wall and wrote on the back in large
letters, "Mustered out." ,
This was not all of the humiliation
heaped upon the colonel, however, for in
the hall is an official document in a frame
setting forth Colonel Fairbanks' authority
ity and this decoration was covered over
with a pair of old overalls.
"When it was suggested that such ac
tions might be a breach of etiquette. If

A majority of the members of the com

are acts of Ignorance and not the senti

of criticism from any but these soreheads,
and they would never be given a chance

extinguished after $.iO worth of damage
had been done. Mnnager J. R. Dean of
the wood yard believes that the fire was
started by a man with whom he has had
trouble. Several people have furnished

believed that the would-be incendiary
will be apprehended.

PREPARED FOR
AN ACCIDENT
Suggestive Notes Left
by Philias H. Lam
eroux.
No Intimation of Insanity Is
Given Before the Coro
ner's Jury.
His Death Resulted From a Bullet
Wound While Laboring Under
a Fit of Despondency.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 4.
"If anything should happen to me
by accident or otherwise"
"If anything should happen"
These words on the back of two blank
checks of the Remillard Brick Company
was the only evidence Introduced at the
Coroner's inquest to-night to show that
Phllias H. Lameroux intended to commit
suicide last night. They were found in a
cuspidor in the family residence this
morning.
The jury found that the "deceased com
mitted suicide while laboring under a fit
of despondency." No evidence was intro
duced to show who or how he was found
and any question looking toward the mat
ter of his business relations or domestic
affairs was invariably answered with "I
don't know" or "the books have not been
examined." . â 
P. H. Remillard testified that he knew
no reason why the deceased should com
mit suicide. He knew of no financial or
domestic difficulties. He was under the
Impression that Lameroux was despond
ent. He knew his health had been a cause
of concern to him for some time. He
knew by hearing that deceased dined at
home and left about 8 o'clock. His wife
was not at home when he left, and he
told the maid to "be good to the chil
dren."
Testimony of employes was taken cov
ering the time from 2 p. m. yesterday un
til 8 o'clock last night. He failed to count
the money turned over to him at 6 clock
in the office, nor did he put it down in
the cash book. When asked why he did
not count it he asked. "Is it all right."
Being answered in the affirmative, he said,
c Well, If it Is right, it's right." He was
driven home as usual, but did not speak
to his driver, sitting with his head down
all the way as if thinking.
D. W. Swain, night patrol-wagon driver,
was the next to see him that appeared
before the Coroner. This was at 9:10, and
he found him with a bulldog revolver
with five chambers, grasped tightly In his
hand. It required hard work to release
it. Three chambers were empty.
No testimony was introduced to show
whether shots were heard in the vicinity,
nor was the individual who was supposed
to have notified the police called as a
witness. None of the witnesses suggested
anything in the nature of insanity and
the Jury refused to entertain any thought
of the kind. -

JEFFRIES' FORM
WAS AT ITS BEST
Appears Before the Reliance
Club in Oakland as a
Show.
Two Contests In Which the Light
weights Fight and the Heav
ies Pose.
OAKLAND, May 4.â James J. Jeffries
surprised the big audience at the Reliance
Club to-night. Nothing can be said about
his boxing, for he did not box, but his
form was simply perfect. Although a
natural giant, his muscles and flesh are
so well proportioned that he did not look
the big man he is ejcept when ordinary
sited men were near him. When his long
robe was removed the crowd cheered for
several minutes, and certainly no such
specimen of a perfect fighter has ever
been before cheered in an Oakland ring.
Jeffries is at his best and one-half of the
throng attended the entertainment for the
purpose of seeing him stripped.
Billy Jordan, the ancient Bupplicant for
freedom from smoking during a contest,
was present and filled his position of mas
ter of ceremonies with all due aplomb
and hupkiness of voice.
Jeffries was announced to ngnt three
rounds with Jack Stelzner, but as Stele
ner is suffering from a boll Jeffries'
brother was substituted. It was under
stood that there would be no hitting, as
anything in the nature of a fight would
be a breach of Jeffries' contract for Fri
day night. For three rounds the two
brothers sparred and danced around like
kittens. Their exhibition was much ap
plauded.
Kid McFadden and William Murnane
boxed eight rounds, and the contest was
a fight from start to finish. The two
lightweights are both clever and game,
and came up in such good condition that
the limited number of rounds was barely
enough to enable the judges to give a de
cision, which went to McFadden.
Phil Green, the acrobatic lighter, and
Billy Lewis of Vallejo met for eight
rounds, and the contest was aa much of a
pantomime as a fight. Lewis affected to
show so much self-confidence as to make
himself ridiculous, and occasionally he
suffered for it. Green is improving, and
did most of the work, but when Lewis did
land he produced as much effect with one
blow as Green did with four. The affair
was declared a draw, but Green had a
majority of the audience in his favor.
Verdict Expected This Week.
OAKLAND. May 4.â The trial of J. I.
Leg-ault, charged with arson in setting
fire to his stock of goods at Thirty-fourth
and Adeline streets, is about completed
and a verdict will be rendered this week.
It has occupied the court eight days al
ready, and a determined fight is being
made. The witnesses of the prosecution
included Deputy Surveyor P. A. Haver
lin. Officer Charles F. "Layton, Sergeant
John Morrison, ex-Fire Warden Murdoch,
Sergeant Hodgkins, Charles E. Boman,
Officer L. E. Andrews. George W. Austin,

FIFTY YEARS AS A STATE.
California to Be Honored by the
Business Men of the City.
The proposed celebration In honor of the
fiftieth anniversary of the admission of
California as a State into the Union has
emerged from the embryonic state and
bids fair to become an accom
plished fact. The principal originators of
the idea of honoring the semi-centennial
statehood of California with an appro
priate and fitting demonstration met yes
terday afternoon in Attorney Reinstein's
office for the purpose of effecting a tem
porary organization. This was carried
successfully. Mr.Reinstein being appointed
temporary chairman and 11. P. Doolan
secretary.
A motion was made and carried which
provides for the calling of a meeting at 3
o'clock next Wednesday afternoon in the
Chamber of Commerce, where all the rep
resentative business men of the city are
invited to attend.
In addition to this it was decided to In
vite the proprietors or acting proprietors
of the six principal daily papers of the
city to also attend and enroll as active
members In furthering the object of the
organization. The request of Supervisor
Lackmann to have the foreign papers in
cluded in this invitation was denied on
the ground that as the organization is
still in its infancy it would be better to
commence by inviting the principal dailies
and later on including with their member
ship the other papers willing to Join.
Those present at the meeting yesterday
were: General R. H. Warfleld. W. H.
Mills, A. B. Spreckels, F. L. Brown. S. H.
Friedlander, J. B. Reinsteln. Supervisor
Lackmann, Dr. C. A. Clinton and R. P.
Doolan.

STATE POLITICS
AND THE WAR
MAGUIRE AS
A TALKING
PATRIOT
Says the American
Sailors Are
Pirates,
Colonel Otis Not in Fa
vor With the Mili
tia.
Termed Them Callow Youths
and Now Wants to Com
mand Them.
FAT BAIT FOR FRANK COOMBS
Some Inside Facts That May Prove
to Be of Interest to Some
Local Politicians.
"War and its attributes are playing: sad
havoc with the plans of some of the
aspiring politicians of California. To
be a talking politician In times of
peace is one thing, .but for a iolitician
to talk in war times, when the passions
of the people are inflamed and every
thing is made subservient to the spirit
of patriotism, is quite another.
The latest victim of his own tongue
is Congressman Maguire. That worthy
and voluble statesman has been
"talking out loud," and, unfortunately
for him and his political aspirations,
his words have not been such ls to
merit the commendation of good Ame
ricans. He has called the American
seamen pirates and has, by inference,
said that the brothers in arms with the
brave fellows who folio-wed Commo
dore Dewey to victory in the bay of
Manila should one and all be strung up
to the yardarms of their shi >s for acts
that found approval in the hearts of
every American worthy of the name.
Here is what the man who aspires to
be the war Governor of California has
to say on the subject.
The question before the House was
a declaration of war against Spain, to
date from April 21, when that mon
archy unceremoniously dismissed from
her shores General Woodford, the
American Minister, and refused to
communicate with the United States.
"I consider the seizure of the Buena
Ventura and other seizures on the part
of the United States as nothing more
than piracy."
If it be piracy to inflict injury on an
enemy that has already declared war,
then there are some hundreds of thou
sands of California freebooters who are
ready and willing to sail under the
black flag with Captain Sampson and
Commodore Dewey and the other
brave defenders of the national honor.
At any rate, when the talkative Con
gressman comes hume to make his can
vass for the office of Governor of the
State that is sending some thousands
of her sons to fight for honor and lib
erty on the pestilential shores of strick
en Cuba, he will have to do the tallest
kind of talking to make the people be
lieve that he is the brand of statesman
that is needed to administer the affairs
of state.
There is still another gentleman who
believes himself to be high in the politi
cal counsels of the State who is at this
moment suffering the pricks of his own
nimble tongue. He is Colonel Harrison
Gray Otis, warrior, editor and states
man. A few days ago, from his supe
rior position as veteran of the Civil
War, he poked fun at the National
Guard of California. He called them
"callow youths," and in his superior
wisdom ridiculed the idea of relying
upon them in the inevitable conflict
with the valorous warrior of Spain.
Now, Colonel utia aspires to- the title
of brigadier-general and the command
of these same "callow youths" who are
to represent California in the coming
struggle. The appointment has not yet
been made, and is not likely to be, but
this fact does not prevent conjecture
as to what effect such a misfortune
would have on our soldier boys. If the
colonel were to make half as many mis
takes in war as he has in politics, the
chances are about even that before the
second week of the campaign some
Spanish general vo-uld sell him a gold
brick or would bunko him into turning
his own guns against his friends. Be
that as it may, the National Guard will
have none of him, and he will probably
be permitted to continue in his present
peaceful occupation of being the cats
paw tor every Tom, Dick and Harry in
the Held of State politics. \
Fortunately for c honor of the State
the Maguirea and Otises are few and
far between. There are others who are
patriots first and politicians afterward.
For illustration there is \V. R. Guy of
San Diego, who would like to be the
next Attorney General. Some time since
he quietly and unostentatiously ten
dered his services to Governor Budd
when it became apparent that Califor
nia would be called on to do her share
in the national defense. And there are
others, many others.
Some very pretty political leg-pulling
Is going on just now in conneciio/i with
the appointment of a successor to
United States District Attorney Foote.
Frank L. Coombs of Napa, who was
speaker of the last Assembly, has been
promised the place and will probably
get it unless he consents to be side
tracked as per the plans of others who
want the job. These plans took definite
shape about a mo..th ago when Coombs
was tendered the appointme . of State
Librarian. Before accepting the ap
pointment Coombs consulted with his
friends and finally inform-d the party
leaders that he would decline the honor
unless it was definitely understood that
in case he accepted it he would not
thereby resign any of his claims for the
appointment of United States District
Attorney or release any one from the
promises they had made in that con
â^tion. This ultimatum was corn
munlcated to Senator Perkins in Wash
ing-ton, with the result that he wrote
to Major McLaughlin to the effect that
I as long as Coombs laid claim to the
Federal appointment no one else would
get it. With this understanding Coombs
accepted the office of State Librarian
with its salary of $3000 a year. This
part of the plan having proved success
ful the matter was allowed to rest for
awhile. It is now proposed to appoint
Mrs. Coombs to the position in the
State Library made vacant by the
resignation of Miss Green. This posi
tion is worth $2400 a year. This ap
pointment is to be made if Coombs will
resign all claims to appointment as
United States District Attorney. It
has been pointed out to him that the
Federal position is worth but $4000 a
year and involves a very considerable ]
amount of hard work, while on the |
other hand the position of Librarian is j
a sinecure which, with the position to
be given to Mrs. Coombs, would be j
worth $54QP a year. The bait is a tempt- I
ing one and It may have the desired [
effect. Should Coombs elect to remain |
an officer of the State then the rival j
claims of Eugene F. Bert and R. T. '
Devlin for the Federal appointment
would become a matter of public in
terest. Bert's friends claim that he has
the inside track and they more than
intimate that he is responsible for all
of the fine work that has been done in
this connection during the past two
months.
In connection with the appointment of
Will S. Green to the position of State
Treasurer, vice Levi Rackliffe, de
ceased, much talk has been indulged in
regarding the distribution of the pat
ronage of the office. Treasurer Green
has set malicious tongues at rest by |
announcing that he will make ample j
provision for *he family of his prede- j
cessor. It is needless to say that such
generous action meets with vie ap
proval and commendation of Republi
cans and Democrats alike.
The Republicans of the Second Con
gressional District have practically and
properly given the marble heart to Dis
trict Attorney Frank Ryan's aspiration
to be the successor of Marion de Vrles. j
It became evident some time ago that
Ryan could not get the support of his !
own county delegation and his strength j
in the other counties in the district is [
even less than it is in his own county, j
P. A. Buell of Stockton has a strong j
following and all signs point to the
conclusion that h will succeed in get
ting the nomination. Judge J. M. Wal
ling of Nevada City is his most dan
gerous opponent, it being conceded that
Ryan is out of the running.
In the First Congressional District
John A. Barham still holds first place j
in the minds of his constituents, a con- |
dition that may be due to the fact that j
as yet no one has come forward with a j
bid for the nomination. T. H. Selvage â¢
is tallied of as a possibility, as is also
State Senator Gillette. As he has
served but half his term as Senator
there is small possibility that Gillette !
will oppose himself to Barham. He is
extremely popular in the district and
would probably succeed in getting tTie
nomination - he so desired.
HAVE DECLARED
A BITTER FEUD
Julius Caesar Saulman and
Samuel Braunhart on
the Warpath.
A Refarencs to Isinglass Tickets Pro
vokes fÂ«n Application for a
Vagrancy Warrant.
A feud has been declared between Julius
Caesar Saulman, diplomat and politician,
and Samuel Braunhart, politician and
diplomat.
No blood has been shed as yet, but
there are rumors of war in the air, and
mutual promises of exposure and social
disgrace not at all in keeping with the
established code of ethics made and pro
vided for the use and guidance of lower
strata politicians.
It all came about in this way: Saulman
is a valiant soldier in the ranks of the !
Rainey Democrats; Braunhart is an hon- J
ored member of the strategic board of the i
Sullivan Democrats. The general com
mittee is the executive body of the Rainey j
forces, and it therefore follows that Saul
man has a vote in its councils. At the
last meeting of the committee, Saulman j
Introduced a resolution providing that the |
tickets for the primary elections should i
be printed on paper of uniform color and
texture, with the exception of those In- j
tended for use in the Twenty-ninth As- |
sembly District. These, the resolution j
provided, were to be printed on isinglass, j
so that the name of Braunhart could not j
be scratched or another name substituted.
<The student of local political history will
remember that tickets of this description
were adopted by Braunhart at the prim
ary election in 1892, a scheme that facili
tated the counting of the vote and pre- I
vented any deception on the part of the
voter. The inventor of this novel scheme
hai since declared that any mention of i
the matter can only be made at the peril '
of his extreme displeasure.
Saulman, having cast down the gage
of battle, It remained for Braunhart to i
devise some effective retaliatory measure. !
After much deliberation, he decided upon '
a course of action, which he proceeded to
carry into effect by going to the City
Hall yesterday and applying to Warrant j
Clerk McGovern for the arrest of Saulman j
on a charge of vagrancy. In support of '<
his complaint he set forth the act that !
Saulman depended for hb; political and I
physical existence upon ihe strengtn of
the Rainey Democracy, and that he
therefore, had no visible means of sup
port.
McGovern took the matter under advise- j
ment, with the result that he ascertained
that Saulman has, besides his political '
affinities, some invisiule connection with a !
downtown insurance concern. Believing !
that this might be alleged as a defense !
against the charge of vagrancy, he de- !
cided not to issue the warrant.
As the matter stands at present, both i
sides are on the defensive and both are
collecting arms and ammunition for use in
the immediate future.
More Trouble Ahead.
A suit was filed yesterday with the Rail
road Commissioners by John Robinson
against the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and all affiliated lines known as
the Southern Pacific system.
The complainant goes into a history of
the Southern Pacific Company, the issu
ance of its franchises and the issuance of
franchises to roads which have been ab
sorbed by this company. He then states
on general belief that these roads were"
leased by the Southern Pacific in a man
ner contrary to law. If they were ille
gally leased they are at present being
illegally operated or practically not
being operated at all. He then prays that
as the roads have not been in operation
for a period exceeding one year, the
franchises be declared void and that the
respondents be summoned before the
commission and ordered to bring all
books, papers, etc., relating to the con
solidated roads, that thorough investiga
tion may be made.
The whole bill of complaint bristles with
allegations of fraud and deception of al
most every kind in which a corporation
may be implicated. The Commissioners
are in â  doubt as to whether they have
Jurisdiction to hear the case, and the
opinion of the : Attorney-General will be
asked before summonses are issued At
torney George W.Moateltli represents the
complainant _â¢

WEAK POINTS
IN THE CHARTER
The New Lord Mayor's Funda
mental Law Laid Bare
by Those Opposed.
Continental League Leads the Way
to Defeat the Lopsided
Document
There was a large meeting of rep
resentative citizens In Saratoga Hall
last night. The object of so many per
sons being present was to hear the rea
sons given by the speakers why the pro
posed "Lord Mayor's" new charter should
not be adopted.
Dr. J. H. Stallard, on being introduced
by Chairman Worth of the league to give
' his reasons why this proposed law should
: be retired to the archives of the defunct,
; said in brief:
Its obscure and conflicting provisions will
i give rlsg to innumerable disputes, to be settled
i only by the courts. The brevity and simplicity
i of a charter Is the truest test of Us home rule
It distrusts the people and their representa
| tlves, the Board oi Supervisors, and surrounds
them with checks, baJances and Ironclad re-
I strictions which Imply corruption and dis
â¢ honesty and are repugnant to honorable men.
i The creation of a free and honest government,
i capable of promptly and successfully dealing
1 with the changing conditions and requirements
i of the city's growth, is thus prevented.
It does not provide for a government wntcn.
can be trusted to spend the public moneys
with wisdom and economy. The imposition of
the dollar limit affords no protection against
corruption, extravagance and waste; particu
larly when the limit can be set aside under
conditions which may be created by the govern
ment ltstlf.
The power to tax and to appropriate is given
to the Board of Supervisors, while the power
to appoint, to fix salaries and control ex
penditures Is taken from them and given to
appointed "bosses"â the Auditor, Assessor, Tax
Collector, Treasurer. County Clerk, District
Attorney, City Attorney. Recorder. Sheriff,
Coroner, and to the Mayor and his appointeesâ
whereby power Is divided and responsibility
Is lost. The curse of patronage by individuals
and cliques Is confirmed and extended in every
l department of administration.
The "Lord" Mayor and his appointees, over
j whom he has discretionary power to remove,
will conduct the elections and will be put in j
charge of all the city property. Including |
parks and public buildings, and will control
eisrhty-three per cent of the entire expendi
tures of the city government. Of this, more
than $2,000,000 is patronage, with a certainty of
increase in the Board of Works.
Experience In American cities has shown
that a similar distribution of power is sub
versive of sound economy, political purity and
an honest administration of affairs.
He concluded:
Fellow citizens, let me Implore you to pro
j ceed slowly. If you have not read the new
charter, do not vote; If you understand it,
! you will vote against it. It does not provide
| the city with an honest, efficient and eco
| nomical government. It does not expect to
i provide an incorruptible Board of Supervisors.
I It does not reduce the power of the elected
"bosses." The Assessor, Tax Collector and
! County Clerk will still enjoy enormous patron
age, with which to maintain the army of
henchmen who hold possession of the City
Hall.
James E. Field, B. I. Solomon, A. E.
Friedlander and Oscar Lewis followed In
able and teling arguments against the
adoption of the charter. Dorsen Nichols,
a member of the league, offered a reso
lution pledging opposition to the charter
on the following grounds:
It -would confer on the Mayor greater power
than Is wielded by any other executive officer
in the United States, a power wholly Inconsist
ent with the spirit, if not the actual letter of
the constitution of our country; he would, with
the concurrence of the Board of Supervisors,
have the power to annul the people's verdict
as expressed at the ballot box, by the removal
of any or ail of the elected officers of the city
government, and he alone would have the ap
pointing: of their successors; his authority in
the matter of the removal of appointed officers
would be absolute; he could invade any de
partment of the city government at will and
remove any appointee therein, and the person
removed would be without redress. The Board
of Klection Commissioners, the Registrar and
more than 8000 city employees would be either
directly or indirectly dependent on the Mayor
for the positions they occupied; a power which
If placed in the hands of a designing or am
bitious Mayor, would enable him to defy pub
lic opinion, and to continue himself in office
indefinitely. He would be the autocrat of our
muncipality.
It would impose on our people the monarch
ical and Impractical scheme of government
known as civil service. A scheme intended to
perpetuate in position a horde o/ city employes,
a so-called reform, which would create an
office-holding: oligarchy. A reform which
would exempt from its operation all Mch
salaried and responsible employes, while rigor
ously enforced against those of small salaries
anil little or no responsibility.
It would deny to the employer of laborers
for the city the common sfnse privilege of
selecting them according to merit, but would
compel him to accept them in the order of
their application, thus providing a means of
favoritism whereby the "uncles, the cousins
and aunts" of those in authority would be pro
vided for at the puiilfr- to the exclu
sion of the more deserving laborer.
It would enlarge and perpetuate at public
expense a system of civil pensions whereby
tlit- high-salaried officers are carefully pro
vided for, while those in more humble posl
ti'irm are totally ignored.
!t would force upon the people the Populistic
hobby known as "the initiative and referen
dum." thereby keeping our citizens in a con
stant ferment over elections by petition. And
finally, instead of the promised retrenchment
and economy, we find that it would largely In
crease the burdens of the taxpayer.
Therefore, we believe it better to bear those
ills we have than fly to others we know not of.
MEMORIAL DAY.
Action Taken to Observe the Day of
the Soldier Dead.
The general committee for the observ
ance of Memorial day met last evening
with Commander C. J. Handley in the
chair. The latter was elected permanent
chairman, Comrades J. J. Lyon and J.
Karminsky, secretary and treasurer re
spectively. Sub-committees were elected
to consist of the following comrades:
Financeâ Jacob Wollner. J. C. Bolles, J.
Karminsky, Harry Brown, R. R. Kill
gore; programme and printing â C. Mason
Kinne, J. H. Hilton, C. N. Harris, Sam
W. Carpenter, J. C. Innes; music and
paradeâ E. S. Salomon, T. C. Mastellar,
Peter Maas. J. EL Rlley, J. H. Banneld,
decorations â George H. Robinson, L. D.
Olin, Frank Elliott Myers, W. H. Wharff,
James Stuart. Q. Alberti; transporta
tionâA. E. Leavitt, John Massey, J. S.
French, William Hatch, George T. John-
son.
An invitation was extended to the Mex
ican War Veterans. Sons of Veterans and
the Woman's Relief Corps to participate
in decorating the soldiers' graves at Odd
Fellows' Cemetery. It was decided to in
vite also the Mayor and the Boards of Su
pervisors and Education to take part in
the parade and to furnish carriages for
their use.
This year, in addition to placing flow
ers on the graves of deceased comrades
each grave will be marked by a miniature
flag of the Union.
Colonel M. Schlaudecker was unani
mously elected grand marshal of the
parade.
As yet no invitation has been received
from any church in which to hold the
usual memorial services on the Sunday
preceding Memorial day, and it is hoped
by the general committee that the secre
tary may be informed at an early o.ay
what may be the wishes of the San "Fran
cisco clergy In this matter.

OSCAR LUNING
SUES WHITTELL
FOR A MILLION
Grave Charges Against the
Late fiillionaire's Exec=
utor and son=in=Law.
Superior Court Asked to Make De
fendant Restore the Property of
Plaintiff and Render a True
Account of All He Did.
There Is a yreat scandal in the Jjan
lng estate. Oscar T. Luning, one of the
sons of the late millionaire, Nicholas
Luning, has sued Execut. r George
Whittell for an accounting, charging
him with crimes enough to make a Dick
Turpln blush-
Whittell Is plaintiff's brother-in-law.
He Is also one of the executors of the
Luning estate, valued at nearly eight
millions, and president of the corpora
tion that now manages the Luning es
tate.
The suit was filed yesterday in the
Superior Court. It practically alleges
that George Whittell has defrauded
plaintiff out of about a million dollars
by schemes, trickery and devices equiv
alent to the methods of a bunko swind
ler. That the story told in the plead
ings may be intelligible to the public
a few preliminary facts should be borne
In mind.
Nicholas Luning died on August 1,
1890, leaving a will which disposed of
an estate valued at nearly seven and a
half million dollars. Six and a quarter
of those millions were invested in Gov
ernment bonds and cash notes on such
men as the Crockers and Huntington,
all of which were soon converted into
cash. He left five children, two sons
and three daughters, to wit: John and
< >?car Luning and Ellen Fife, Anna
Whittell, wife of defendant, and Clara
Cunninr'iam. George Whittell, who is
president of the Pacific Union Club,
and Marion B. Langhorne were execu
tors of the c.state. The estate was to
be divided equally among the heirs.
Whittell is now president and Lang
h^rii^ is secretary <>f the corporation
that manages the Luning estate.
Throe of the heirs were married wo
men, unaccustomed to business, while
John Luning was equally averse to
business matters, and Oscar, the plain
tiff, was frightfully addicted to liquor
until two years ago, at which time he
reformed and opened his eyes, as he
claims, to the fact that he had been
living in a sort of pink dream, during
whi^h time, he pays, Whittell operated
on him by ways that were dark and
tricks that were vain, luring him into
contracts, into signing papers and do
ing other things that have resulted in
stripping him of everything he has ex
cept the income on 5500,000.
Immediately after Luning's death
Whittell advised all the heirs that the
safest thing f<>r them to rl<> would be to
form a corporation to handle the busi
ness of the estate. He proposed to look
out for them as executor of the estate
and president of the company. The
three married women, one of whom was
his wife, and the two sons of the dead
millionaire, one who now alleges that
he was until two years ago a drunkard
and the other wholly unacquainted with
business matters at once consented
and the corporation was formed. The
nominal capital was ten millions, but
the real value was that of the estate,
three-quarters of the ten millions.
There were one hundred shares, twenty
for each heir. A dividend of $100,000
was paid to each heir within a year.
John Luning remained away nearly all
the time, taking no part in the business
of the estate, while Oscar was incapa
citated from drink.
One day, so runs the story, Whittell
Baid to Oscar Luning: "You are drink
ing so much that you will he foolish
enough some day to assign your whole

fortune away. You had better gflve It
to me In trust."
Oscar Luning agTeed without further
discussion. Whittell gave him a decla
ration of trust wherein he acknowl
edged that he (Whittell) held $500,000
in trust for plaintiff In this suit, and
whereby he agreed to pay half of the
income thereof to Oscar Luning^ and
half to his wife. This agreement has
been fulfilled, and so far as Oscar Loin
ing can discover the Income of the half
million thus described is all that is left
to him out of what should be one-fifth
of nearly eight millions. The suit filed
yesterday asks Whittell what has be
come of the balance of a million dollars.
Incidentally It appears that plaintiff
recently demanded an accounting for
the missing million, whereupon Whit
tell denied that there was anything due,
asserting that the $500,000 payment was
for all of plaintiff's right, title and in
terest-
According to statements of the
plaintiff Whittell seems to have taken
a fatherly interest in Oscar in another
way. It is said that once when Oscar
was very ill at San Joee, Whittell drew
a will for the sick man to sign. It made
the president of the Luning Company
sole executor of the will, without bonds,
and provided that Whittell was also to
be guardian of Oscar's children. A
year afterward Whittell seems to have
detected an error In the will. He came
back and had Oscar sign it again. He
made it read guardian "of all lawful
children," whereas it had before read
"guardian of my children."
The suit filed yesterday follows in the
wake of a settlement which John Lun
ing forced some time ago. He discov
ered that he was in the same predica
ment that confronts Oscar to-day. He
hired lawyers, and after a number of
conferences he was paid $950,000 to let
go.
If the pleadings and the story of
Oscar Laming are true George Whittell
has not only had sole control of the
Luning finances and estate ever since
the death of the well-known million
aire, but he has emulated Warren
Hastings in the darkest pages of the
history that chronicles the hard luck
of the Begums and other princes of
India, The details of the story are
like the pages from a buccaneer's Jour
nal.
The pleadings assert that Whittell
and Langhorne represented that It i
would be necessary, in order to carry :
out the provisions of the last will and \
testament, to sell considerable of the \
property at a sacrifice, and to establish
thÂ« corporation before referred to, mak
ing the executors the principal officers
thereof. In pursuance of this recom
mendation the heirs transferred their
Interests to the corporation. It is
averred that Whittell has had almost
sole control of the estate ever since the !
formation of the corporation in August, !
1891.
It was in April of this year that Os
rar made a demand for an accounting,
which Whittell refused. Andrew D.
Parker, a well-known member of the
New York bar, came to this city about
that time. Joining E. F. Preston and
J. W. Bourdette as attorneys for Lun
ing in the matters that have now
reached the court. The three are the
attorneys of record in the case.
The prayer of the petition filed yes.
terday asks that "Whittell be required
to account to plaintiff for all property
held in trust, together with all the
rents and incomes on all property other
than the $500,000 held in trust.
It is requested that the trust be de
termined and ended without delay, and
that Whittell be required to deliver to
Luning all property alleged to be held
in trust and all other property said to
be that of plaintiff.
One of the concluding allegations of
the complaint is as follows: "After the
trust of five hundred thousand dollars
there remained in the hands . the de
fendant, in trust for plaintiff, property
of the value of at least one million dol
lars, of which no account has at any
time been rend red or made by the de
fendant, and the defendant has never
at any time p -d over or accounted for
any part or portion of said last-men
tioned property, or of the income,
rents, issues or profits thereof."
It is then set forth in detail that de
fendant failed and wholly refused,
when asked to make an account, to
render any statement whatever, the de
mand being made c.i the 9th of last
month.
It is expected that the case will be
urged to trial without delay and that
there will be some strong efforts to
have Whittell explain in detail all he
has done in the estate, why he has dona
it; also that he will detail how much
he has earned as executor and man
ager of the estate and as president of
the Luning Company.
Counselor Parker is here with the
intention of remaining and devoting all
his energies to the case until it is fin
ally determined. Messrs. Preston and
Bourdette will also do all in their power
to see that the matters at issue arÂ»
determined without delay. Several sen
sations are expected during the hear
ing.

Lively Scrimmaga on Haight Street
Which Awakened the Neigh

Policemen Peter Whalen and William
Irvine had a mix up near the Chutes at
an early hour yesterday morning, and as
the result the latter's head is swathed in
bandages. Last night they were both sus
pended by Captain Wlttman, pending an
investigation by the Police Commission.
According to Whalen's story he was
patrolling his beat when he saw Irvine
and another officer named George Silver.
They were some distance away, and as
they approached Whalen, Irvine re
marked: "Whalen was never any good.
I think he Is a dirty ."
He repeated the remark several times,
sundasWhalen walked up to him. intending
to ask him what he meant, Irvine drew
his revolver, and placing it against his
fellow officer's head, threatened to shoot.
Whalen quickly pulled out his club and
brought it down on Irvine's head, cutting
a deep gash, and felling him to the
ground. Silver then took a hand in the
scrap, and separated the combatants after
considerable trouble.
Irvine afterward went to a drug store in
the vicinity, where the wound in his head
was dressed.
Captain Wittman in some way learned
of the trouble between the officers and
he sent for them. Irvine, when ques
tioned, denied that he used the remark
attributed to him by Whalfn, but admit
teu that he had drawn his revolver on
him. He explained his action by saying
that he thought Whalen intenued to do
him up, and he concluded not to take any
chances.
Silver, however, corroborated Whalen's
statement that Irvine referred to him in
vile terms.
r ormal charges of unofflcerlike conduct
were filed against the three policemen
last night. They will be given an oppor
tunity to explain their conduct at the
meeting of the Board of Police Commis
sioners next Monday night.
IN A BOWER OF
SPRING BLOSSOMS
Wedding of Miss Meiita
Robinson and George
T. Tallant.
'iue wedding of Miss Meiita Robinson,
daughter of the late Dr. Luke Robinson,
and George T. Tallant of the Tallant
Banking Company of this city, was quiet-
ly celebrated yesterday afternoon at half
past 3 at the residence of the bride's
mother on Steiner street. Archbishop
Riordan, assisted by Father Mulligan,
performed the ceremony in the presence
of only the immediate friends of the
family.
It was a typical spring wedding. White
was the prevailing color tone of the dec
orations, which were unusuaÂ«ly pretty
and artistic. In the drawing room a
bower of dainty spring blossoms and
clinging smilax was erected, and it was
here the happy couple stood while they
exchanged vows and plighted their troth.
The bride was attended by her sister.
Miss Bernardette Robinson, who officiated
as maid of honor, and Alfred Wilcox of
Lofl Angeles was best man. Dr. Frank
Robinson, brother of the bride, gave her
into the safekeeping of the groom.
Miss Robinson made a remarkably beau
tiful bride and looked extremely pretty
in her white satin gown, all covered with
point lace, the same which adorned % the
bridal dress of her mother.
Miss Rernardette Robinson wore a white
mousseline de sole over white silk and
carried bridemaid's roses.
The presents were elegant, numerous
and costly. Mr. and Mrs. Tallant left last
evening for Tahoe, where they will spend
their honeymoon, and on their return they
will reside with Mrs. Robinson at her
residence on Steiner street.

JUSTICE COOK
S AYS HE WAS
THREATENED
Deputy Clerk Harry Barron
Charged With Trying
to Influence Him.
Writ of Prohibition Was Served
on the Justice of the Peace
During the Progress of
a Trial.
One of the most barefaced attempts
to coerce a judicial officer Into render
ing a judgment In favor of a certain
litigant has come within the experience
of Justice of the Peace G. W. F. Cook,
according to the statement made by
that gentleman yesterday in the pres
ence of four witnesses.
The man charged with the offense Is
Harry Barron, a deputy In the office
of the County Clerk, who came into no
toriety two days ago as a manipulator
of warrants on the Piper plan of multi
plex hypothecation. When his advances
were rejected with indignation by
Judge Cook Barron threatened to take
the case in question out of Cook's court
if he had to resort to a writ of prohi
bition. The writ of prohibition was
served on Judge Cook yesterday.
Some weeks ago suit was nstituted
in the case of A. yon Bargen against
the Demaray Provision Company et al.
The defendants were Mrs. Demaray, I.
W. T. Unfug and Francis J. Barry. The
amount sought to be recovered was
$213 for goods sold and delivered. The
attorneys for the plaintiff are William
Tomsky and Moses G. Cobb. The plain
tiff's attorney Is P. L. Benjamin. The
case was assigned to Judge Cook.
Judge Cook thus relates the remarka
ble incident which occurred before the
case came up for a hearing:
"Harry Barron. a deputy In the Coun
ty Clerk's office, came to me and said:
'I want to ask a favor of you. You have
got the case of Yon Bargen against the
Demaray Provision Company before
you.' I told him that I had.
" 'I wish you would see if you can't
give judgment for the defendant, 1 he
said.
"I replied In anger: 'What do you
mean by talking to me that way? You
TWO GIRLS WHO
WENT ASTRAY
Their Trouble Caused Through
a Charitable De
sire.
Collected Funds for * Deceased
Friend and Then Enjoyed Them
selves Until Arrested.
The fact that Jim Keating died from a
gunshot wound but a short time ago and
that his friends were anxious to raise a
Bum of money with which to pay expenses
for the last sad rites has resulted in two
or three arrests, many threats of war
rants being issued for grand larceny, ac
cusations of drunkenness and a loss of
money collected, besides the report that
jewelry had been lost, strayed or stolen.
Flora Abbott and Ollie Connors are the
stars in the lttle drama which was but
recently enacted. When It was thought
a burial fund should be collected they
sallied forth among the saloon men wÂ«o
had known the deceased in his life time,
and in a few minutes had gathered to
gether about $50. Then an idea struck
them and in consequence It was a red-let
ter night for those who sell liquors on the
Barbary Coast.
That the idea sould be carried out to
the fine point the. self-appointed collectors
went forth and in a few short hours were
behind the bars of the California-street
Station charged with drunk. Then tha
complications cropped forth. Jim Abbott
and James Connors went to the rescue
of the girls and removed them from the
disgraceful cell which they were occupy-
The money which had been collected
could not be found. A ring with a dia
mond setting valued at $100 was reported
missing by Flora, and Ollie had pawned
a pair of $200 earrings for $10 in a nearby
saloon. Flora accused Ollie of having
taken the ring from her finger, and
threats were made to swear out warrants
for her arrest. Ollie retorted that she
would swear out a warrant for her co
collector for having "gone through" the
money gatherprl together through the
kindness of the saloonmen.
Then the men mixed things and a fight
looked inevitable. But the trouble was
stopped and Abbott visited all the sa
loons in the district for the purpose of find
ing the ring and earrings, but the search
was in vain, with the exception that each
bartender wa.s willing to "stand the
drinks." Now each and every one is won
dering what happened, but it is well
known that flowers were rather scarce
at one funeral on account of a hot time
on the notorious Barbary Coast.
TREASURY DECISIONS.
Dealers in Tobacco and Liquor Will
Find Much in Them That Is
Interesting.
Collector of Customs Jackson was noti
fied yesterday of the following decisions
made by the Treasury Department at
"Washington:
Manufactured tobacco cannot be fur
nished free of tax as supplies to American
vessels otherwise than under the provi
sions of section 18, act of July 24, 1897.
There is no other arrangement than with
drawal from a bonded warehouse or a
manufacturing warehouse for supplies as
provided in section 16.
Cargoes brought in as war prizes are
not subject to duty, and go immediately
into the hands of the United States Mar
shal for prize court.
An importer of alcoholic liquors or com
pounds thereof who holds a special tax
stamp as a wholesale liquor-dealer at his
place of business" In one city and sells and
delivers packages of those liquors at a
place of storage in another city without
prior constructive delivery to the pur
chasers at the place where such stamp is
held is required to pas' additional special
tax and to take out the requisite stamp
for that storage place.
The question whether a liquor-dealer or
malt liquor dealer is required to pay
special tax as a retail or a wholesale
dealer depends upon the actual quantity
of liquor disposed of by him at any one
sale.
"Spain As It Is."
Neal Davis, who has traveled exten
sively in Spain, will deliver his lecture on
the customs and features of that country
at Metropolitan Temple this evening.
are asking me to do an act of Injustice?'
" 'Well, they will stop you with a
writ of prohibition,' was his answer.
"To this I retorted: 'I am going to
try this case on its merits. Don't you
come near me again.' He then left me
and the matter was forgotten by me
until this morning when they served a
writ of prohibition on me to prevent me
trying the case."
Judge Cook then went on to tell how
he had been, as he viewed it, shame
fully treated in this cape.
"When the case came up last wsek
the attorney for the defendant made
a motion to have the case transferred
to another court on the ground of
prejudice. The motion was overruled,
as the cause of the alleged prejudice
was not set forth. The defendants
then asked for a jury trial, which I
granted, feeling glad to be relieved of
the duties which fall upon a Jury.
"The case was pet for trial to-day,
and while I was engaged in empaneling
a jury Barron came in and presented
a notice to the effect that Judge Groe
zinper had transferred the case to
Judge Barry's court. I paid no atten
tion to the notice as the trial of the
ca?e was in progress and besides there
is a rule of the Justices' Courts that no
case shall be reassigned without the
knowledge and consent of all parties.
"It was not more than three minutes
afterward when I was served with a
writ of prohibition, issued by Judge
Seawell of the Superior Court, prohibit
ing me from trying the case and order
ing me to appear before Judge Seawell
on Friday, May 13."
When the matter is heard before
Judge Seawell there are likely to be
some further sensational developments.
Since the suit was brought the com
plaint has been withdrawn as to Mrs.
Demaray and Berry, so that Unfug is
now the sole defendant.
