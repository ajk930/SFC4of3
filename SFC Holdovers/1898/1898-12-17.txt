VOLUME LXXXV.-XO. 17.
MRS. BOTKIN HAS MET HER
WORST ACCUSER IN MRS. RUOFF
Mrs. Harris Was
an Important
Witness.
The prosecutors of Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kln introduced yesterday most damag
ing testimony against the accused wo
man. The evidence given excited the
audience and disconcerted the attorneys
for the defense. Mrs. Botkln was visi
bly affected and her face and eyes lost
the evidences of unconcern which had
thus far marked them at the trial. The
situation was a serious one for her and
even a casual observer could see the
rapidly changing emotions that played
over hfi features.
Something of terrible solemnity was
given to the scone by Judge Cook him
self. The audience had been fliDDant
and boisterous during the morning ses
sion. Men and women laughed when
they pleased and audibly discussed the
situation. Judge Cook threatened to
clear the courtroom, but his warning
passed unheeded. There was a repetition
of the offense, and then the Judge
spoke a reprimand that will not soon
be forgotten. Judge Cook begged the
audience to remember that they were
not in a vaudeville theater, but in a
court of justice. "This proceeding." he
declared, "is to consider the death of
two human beings and the life of an
other."
The first sensation of the day was
: Mrs. Grace Harris, who
proved to bo one of the most important
witnesses of the case. Her testimony
directly upon the vital issue of
th- trial, and before her startliner cvi
â â â¢ as i â¢'iiciuded there was a mur
mur of astonishment throughout the
thronp: in the courtroom. The prose
cution had sprung its first surprise, and
with Mis. Harris had filled another gaD
in the line of startling circumstantial
evidence against Mrs. Botkin.
The public knew the police could
prove that the handkerchief found in
the box of poisoned candy had been
purchased at the City of Paris. The
fact that the saleswoman who sold the
handkerchief could also identify the
purchaser had been kept a profound se
cret. Whin Mrs. Harris took the wit
tand few expected the course the
testimony would take. Mrs. Harris de
clared that late in May or early in June â 
< f this year she had sold two handker
chiefs, lust like that in the candy box.
to a woman who gave her address as
the Victoria Hotel.
This statement seemed to disconcert
nnd confuse Mrs. Botkin to the last
degree. Her face flushed and she fan
ned herself with ' nervous, restless en
ergy. Her attorneys sat silently watch
ins the witness on the stand. The tes
timony had come 'like a thunderbolt.
But Mrs. Harris had not as yet con
cluded. She declared that she was
pure that the woman who bought the
handkerchiefs was Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kin.
Qeotse Knight tried in every way to
break the force of this testimony, but
he simply added to its effect* Under
criTÃ-examinatlon Mrs. Harris was
alert, sharp, quiet-spoken and confi
dent. She told Knight that she was
sure she was not mistaken in her iden
tification, as Mrs. Botkin's face re
minded her strongly of her own
mother's. She recalled the incident of
th^ sale because in selling as she had
d< ne she violated the rules of the
house. Knight did succeed, however, in
drawing frem the witness the fact that
ehe knew of no record of the sale or of
the delivery. Beyond this the cross
r-xaminer could do nothing, and for the
first time during the trial he abandoned
the attempt and notified Mrs. Harris
thnt he would recall her for further
( r"ss-examination.
It was left to Mrs. Elmira Ruoff, the I
firmer friend, confidante mid adviser of
Mrs. Botkin, to become the prisoner's
worst accuser. Mrs. Ptuoff was next
upon the Witness ptand and gave the i
most sensational testimony of the trial.
Her manner was such that even the
Assistant District Attorney urged her i
not to shw 111 feeling upon the witness
Btand. She replied that what was con-
Ptrued to be ill feeling was simply the
emphatic assertion of positive facts.
Mrs. Ruoff outlined the whole dis
praceful story of the relation between
Dunning and Mrs. Botkin. She told of
the first assignation, of clandestine
meetings, .of midnight suppers and
carousals. She sketched scenes after
ward at the races and trips to the park
and the Cliff House. She left nothing
untold that might lay the foundation
upon which the prosecution is building
a proof of the motive for the crime of
which Mrs. Botkin is accused.

The San Francisco Call
Remarkable Recital at the Trial.
STERN ACCUSERS OF MRS. BOTKIN.
The witness digressed to say that she
also had seen in the possession of Mrs.
Botkin a handkerchief similar to that
found in the box of poisoned sweets.
ICcs. Ruoff was armed with pertinent
and incriminating facts. She identified
the anonymous letters as written by
Mrs. Botkin. She swore that the ad
dress on the package of candy was
written by Mrs. Botkin. And then the
witness told how Mrs. Botkin begged
Governor Budd to appoint her a Red
Cross nurse that she might go to Cuba
and the war with her lover.
The great courtroom with its throng
of people was In absolute stillness while
the woman related this story. Her
â  sharp, shrill voice rang out in accus
ing accents, and Mrs. Botkin tried not
to appear concerned. Many eyes were
upon her, and she bent over a book.
But she was not reading, and now and
again her eyes turned in fascination
toward the witness-stand.
This remarkable story related upon
the witness-stand created a profound
impression. Ge rge Knight conducted
a brief cross-examination and did not
succeed in shaking the woman in any
of her assertions. His first question
was characteristic of him. "How long
were you in the Stockton Insane Asy
lum?" he asked. It is not necessary to
say more than that Knight knew the
i witness had been a nurse and not a pa
; tiont in the institution.
There was a storm of objections, and
a recess was taken until the afternoon.
During the recess Mrs. Ruoff was coun
seled not to show ill feeling on the
witness-stand. She changed her man
ner, and so did Knight. Both were
suave, quiet-spoken, courteous. But
Knight could glean nothing directly to
contradict or entrap the witness. After
a brief examination he released her.
The proceedings, which during the day
developed so much of dramatic interest,
opened quietly. B. K. Keklund, a candy
maker employed by George Haas, was the
first witness called. He had put no ar
senic in chocolate. A juror drew from him
that arsenic could be inserted in candy
and the aperture closed, but the witness
thought it would show.
He was followed by Mrs. Grace Harris,
one of the strongest witnesses for the
prosecution. Like many of those who
preceded her. she seemed touchy on
her past, declining to state her residence.
She had apparently read the papers, as
she alluded to the employes of the City
of Paris as "sales persons" and "Bales
people," not the recurrent "sales ladles"
of the candy counter. She was shown the
handkerchief which accompanied the poi
soned sweets to Delaware and identified
it as one sold by hc-r. It still contained
the prico mark which she had placed upon
it with a red rubber stamp. She sold it
to a woman who asked that it be sent to

the Victoria Hotel. She had seen Mrs. .
Botkin in court and recognized her as re- !
sembling the woman who had made the ;
purchase. . . : - â¢â¢;-â¢-â¢
â¢ To Mr. Knight she refused to give her '
present address, but finally said It was j
11041 1 04 Market street, a lodging house. She !
â was sure the purchaser- of the handker- i
chief was Mrs. Botkin, for several rea
sons. The witness knew a man who was
employed at the Victoria Hotel, and
when Mrs. Botkin gave that address the
saleswoman looked up quickly and saw
In the woman before her one who bore '
a striking resemblance to her mother. The
circumstances of the sale all came back
to her. She had no doubt that Mrs. Bot- I
kin was the purchaser of the two hand- :
kerchiefs. . !
Mrs. Klmira Ruoff, one time nurse and
friend of Mrs. Botkin. next took the stand
and. told what she . knew of the defend
ant's movements for an extended period.
To Mr. Hosmcr she said: "My home is ;
in Stockton. I am a widow, and have j
known Mrs. Botkin for seven or eight
years. For the last two years I have
known her very well. " I know John P.
Di nning, having seen him in both San
Francisco and Oakland. I have seen them
in each â¢ other's company four or five
times, perhaps six.. The -first time was at
the home of Mrs. Botkin's sister, Mrs. |
McClure, at Oakland. This was two 1
years ago last April. At that time a mes- <
senger boy brought Mrs. Botkin a note.
After reading It she told me she expected
a visit from a friend and asked me to let j
him in without his ringing the bell and ;
at racting any attention. She did not |
want any. one to know of his visit. Mr. |
Dunning came and I admitted him as re- j
quested. He stayed about a half hour.
A week later he came again under ex- j
actlv the same circumstances.
"The next time I met him was in Gold
en Gate Park. Mrs. Botkin and myself j
were on our way to the Cliff House and
passed through the park. Mrs. Botkin
expected to meet him at the 1 Cliff, but he j
did not come. This was in July, 1896. The
next time I saw him was at the home of :
'Mrs. Botkin at P27 Geary street, between i
Polk and Van Ness avenue. He came in i
and stayed a few minutes. Some days j
later I went to stay all night and knocked !
at the door of Mrs. Botkin's room. She
asked me to go downstairs and wait for i
her. Shortly afterward she called me and
I went up and found Mr. Dunning in the
room -with her. â¢; :
The witness was shown the handker
chief sent to Delaware and said: "Mrs.
Botkin and myself were in the City of j
Paris one day and she pointed out a
handkerchief like that and said, 'Ain't
they pretty?' The handkerchiefs had !
been marked down and were being sold at
an unusually low price."
The witness identified a card as being
in Mrs. Botkin's handwriting. The latter
acknowledged it. and the letter was ad- j
mitted in evidence. The witness identified |
the following letter as being in Mrs. Bot- I
kin's handwriting: ; ;â¢/ <
San Francisco, Apr. 18|98
Governor Bud: Most Dear Sir: Will you
kintily prant my sincere request which to be
placed on the nurse staff. It will be my heart
felt wish to render all the care ami sympathy
that such a position would demand. My ref
erence in this City is Dr. Thorne. Trusting
my request will receive an early response, I
am most respectfully.
Mrs. W. A. Botkine, 1105 Hyde Street.
This was written shortly after Dunning
went to Cuba as a war correspondent.
The witness Identified the anonymous
letters, saying they were not In Mrs. Bot
kin's usual handwriting, but that there
were many points .if similarity. The
writing on the wrapper, she thought,
was the same as that of the anonymous
letters an 1 thai, one and txe same person
wrote them all and ttiat that person wad
Mrs. Botkin.
"I saw Mrs. Botkin," continued the wit
ness." on the 27th or 28th of July, 1S!Â«.
She came up on the boat and I was not
overjoyed to see her. She noticed this
and I explained that I had expected to see
her in the city. I made coffee for her and
then she entered upon a discussion as to
various poisons. I told her that in poison-
Ing rats I would use strychnine. She
asked if ] ever used arsenic and I said I
had, but found the rats thrived on it. She
asked particularly as to what would be
a dose that would kill and T inld her that
it varied in size. She then asked how she
could purchase the drug and 1 told her at
any drugstore, but would have to explain
for what purpose she required it. She
then asked particularly as to the rates of
postage on various kinds of matter. I
advised her if she desired to make sure
of safe transmission she should register
anything she sent. She asked if she
would not then have to sign her name."
"She then asked me If a person was In
trouble and hired a lawyer would they
have to tell him everything. I answered
by reminding her of the old saying that
it is best to employ a good doctor or
lawyer if one needs such services as they
can render.
"She then explained to me- that she came
up to see the 'governor,' as she alwa-ys
called Mr. Botkin. She had some dla- :
monds in pawn and wanted money from
him with which to redeem them. She
went out, but returned shortly and said
she had seen the 'governor' and that
he was displeased to find her there, but
had invited her to dine Vith him. She
complained of feeling HI and said that if
she had not promised Mr. Botkin she
would not dine with him.
"Mrs. Botkin went out and returned late
in the afternoon and said: 'I have dined
with the "governor"' and have been
to his room. That cuts him off from a '
divorce for one year.' That night she
complained of being 111. saying it was
acute pneumonia. She was very excited
and nervous, and said she had taken poi- i
son. I said. 'I don't believe you have; you !
are too hip a coward." The doctor cailed
and found her in a high fever and said
she had the grip.
"While the doctor was in the house she
plied him continuously with questions re
garding poisons. 1 told the doctor not
to answer her, as she would be taking
poison. The doctor did tell her that i
strychnine was too harsh: arsenic was
quieter in effect, but that the morphine
route was better than either. . Mrs. Bot
kin referred again to arsenic, and had the
doctor tell her the symptoms of arsenic i
poisoning and all particulars about the I
lethal poison. The doctor recommended !
her to remain quiet several days, but she
decided to go the next day.
"She told me that something indicated
to her that her association with Dunning
would be stronger than it hnd been. She
did not think he would get a divorce, on
account of his child. At this time she
told me I might be summoned as a wit
ness, but that I would get my fee. I told
her I knew the law allowed a fee In a
civil case. She said, 'How about a crimi
nal case?" This all happened before the
Dover tragedy.
Dramatic Warn
ing of Judge
Cook.
"She next came to my house on Au
gust 18, and was accompanied by Miss
Livernash. The story of the murders
had then been published. I looked at her
ami said: 'For God's suke, who sent you
here? Have you read the stories printed
in the papers?'
"She said, 'Do you believe it? Why
should you?'
"Miss Livernash went out and Mrs. Bot
kin laid down on a couch. I asked her if
she remembered the conversation she, had
had with the doctor. She said, 'You put
all those thoughts in my head.' She then
went into hysterics and fell over on the
floor. I went for the doctor, who came
and attended her."
"The first time I heard of the anony
mous letters in this case she mentioned
them. She said there were three, and
that they referred to acts at 927 Geary
Btreet. I asked whom she thought did
the writing, and she said she could not
tell, unless it was 'that singed cat Mrs.
Forcade.' She -said. 'If ever you saw a
scrawl in all your life they are the worst.'
She said Mr. Dunning sent them to her
and she had returned them. 1 told her
Bhe was a fool for doing so. She denied
a lot of things attributed to her in the
paper, but finally said she had made the
statements, but not for publication. She
talked a great deal about Dunning, but I
can't remember all.
"In May at the Victoria Hotel she asked
me what I used for bleaching hats. I
recommended sulphur. She asked if 1
had used arsenic. She had been told it
was good for bleaching purposes."
Mr. Knight took the witness for cross
examination and had proceeded but a
short distance when some of the specta
tors laughed at a tart answer he received
to one of his questions. Although the
regular hour for adjournment had not ar
rived. Judge Cook declared the noon re
cess and instructed the Sheriff not to ad
mit more spectators at the afternoon ses
sion than could find seats.
Upon the opening of court for the after
noon session Attorney Hosmer. for the
prosecution, addressed Judge Cook. He
said that during the examination of Mrs.
Ruoff he had objected to a question ad
dressed to her by Mr. Knight. He thought
that he might be misunderstood and de
sired to withdraw it. The question was,
"How long were you in Stockton Insane
Asylum?" Mr. Knight did not avail him
self of the opportunity of asking the ques
tion again . but it was afterward brought
out by Mr. Hosmer that Mrs. Ruoff had
been employed in the asylum for three
years as an attendant. Mr. Knight con
veyed the impression that she had been
committed there.
She was then asked as to the whisky
sne drank at Mrs. Botkin's house oh
Geary street, and said that Mrs. Botkin
handed it to her and insisted upon her
drinking it. against her wishes. She was
asked if she was put to bed that night
flrunk. and said Bhe was not ttjipliap Bhe
â ft.is never h. a condition where she could'

of the publication of f>e story of the
poisoning of Mrs. Dunning. Mrs. Botkin
called on Mrs. Ruoff and the latter ad
mitted that she thought the "Old Harry"
had sent the woman to the house The
witness said that by that time she had
put two and two together and thought in
her heart that Mrs. Botkin was the
guilty woman.
Mr. Knight asked her if, having found
Airs. Botkin. a married woman, enter
taining Mr. Dunning, a married man, she
had formed a favorable opinion of her
The witness said she had not formed a
favorable opinion. She was asked if she
recalled letting Mr. Dunning clandestinely
into her own house In Oakland, and said
she did not at that time. She also said
she found Mrs. Botkin an unwelcome visi
tor. Mr. Knight showed her a letter writ
ten by the witness to Mrs. McClure Mrs
Botkin's sister, In which she spoke of the
latter'? safe arrival at her house and of
being tenderly eared for. She explained
this difference of feeling by saying that
she liked Mrs. McClure and did not want
to hurt her feelings by letting her know
her opinion of Mrs. Botkin.
She acknowledged having examined the
pencil letter "over an hour, or long
enough to satisfy Chief Lees."
"Oh! that's easy, sometimes," said the
accommodating Knight.
Mrs. Botkin appealed to her sympathy
and as a Christian woman she gave it to
her, although many times since then she
has wished that she had never met her.
Regarding the two anonymous letters she
was sure one was written by Mrs. Botkin
the words "Bohemian life," being, she
said, a "dead give away." Asked as
to the meaning of the latter expression
she said it was a slang phrase applied
to something one has heard Defore from
any person.
Mrs. Ruoff dissected the letter, picking
out all the earmarks of Mrs. Botkin's
writing and going into detail as to arm
movement, linger movement and muscu
lar recoil, as though a writing teacher.
She said her expenses were paid here
when she appeared before the Grand Jury
and once when she went to Stockton, but
she had been promised no compensation
for her testimony. Asked as to the rea
son she went to Stockton looking for
letters to aid the prosecution she said she
did so for her own "pleasure." Appar
ently she did not mean she was hounding
Mrs. Botkin for the pleasure it gave her,
but that one expression was all the satis
faction the defenders of Mrs. Botkin
could extract from the unshaken testi
mony of the woman. The jurymen will
hear of it again when the case Is argued.
Captain of Police John Seymour and De
tective Edward Gibson testified that
neither of them had placed the bit of a
seal in the room formerly occupied by
Mrs. Botkin in the Victoria Hotel. At
torney Hosmer then asked for an ad
journment until Monday, as Miss Liver
nash, the next witness he desired, was
out of town. The prosecution had six
more witnesses and would conclude the
presentation of Its case on Monday. The
court adjourned until that time.

The Skyrocket Cattle Operator Has Plenty of Money and
Is Followed by Detectives, Who Have No
Power to Arrest Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CITY OF MEXICO, Dec. 16.â Grant G. Gillett, the
cattle plunger of Woodbine, and his attorney, C. R. Troxel,
who disappeared with him, left here this morning for Vera
Cruz, where they will take the steamer for South America.
Their ultimate destination is Argentine Republic, where
Gillett says he will go into the cattle business. Gillett and
Troxel have been here three days, being registered at the Ho
tel Coliseo under the names of Willis F. Wilder and George
E. Fisher of Fruita, Colo., but both admitted their identity.
Gillett had intended to remain in Mexico indefinitely,
but President Diaz's action in applying for a renewal of the
extradition treaty, which expires next month, and his propo
sition to make it retroactive, decided Gillett that he would be
safe in South America. He had been counting on being
able to resist extradition until January 13, when he would be
absolutely safe.
Gillett and Troxel have a considerable sum of money
with them, and they have been spending it lavishly, but it is
not thought they have $300,000, which they are credited
with having brought from the United States.
Detectives are still following them, but have no power to
make arrests, and can do absolutely nothing to prevent them
from loaving Vera Cruz.
FIRE IN FRESNO'S
BUSINESS CENTER
Voorman and flllen Blocks De
stroyed and a fireman pa
tally Injured.
FRESNO, Dec. 16. â One of the largest fires since the destruction of the
packing houses occurred to-night. Radin & Kamp's large department stores
on I street, in the heart of the city, were totally destroyed. The fire start
ed in the rear of the store in some unaccountable manner and smoke soon
filled the building. When the alarm was turned in the department drove
all over town in the fog, and when the fire was located by the firemen
it was too late to save the structure. The flames soon broke through the
roof, and for a time the entire block seem doomed.
\ The people in the Hughes lodging house were awakened, and there was
much scurrying in getting out trunks. The fire was finally got under con
trol, so that there was no danger to the Hughes block.
Two buildings, adjoining one another, were destroyed. They were the
Voorman block and the Allen block. They extended a third of the block.
The downstairs portions of both were occupied by Radin & Kamp, who had
one of the largest department stores in the valley.
The loss of the stock was total, and it is conservatively estimated at
$125,000. Max Radin said that at this time of the year he carried a stock
valued at between $130,000 and $140,000. He refused to say how much in
surance he carried, but it is understood that the stock was fartrly well in
sured.
The loss to the building will be almost total. The walls are still stand
ing, but they probably will have to be torn down. The entire loss is placed
at about $150,000.
Fireman Cochran fell from the Voorman building and received injuries
which will prove fatal.

COULD HOLD
OUT AGAINST
THE EARTH
Dewey Ready for Any
Trouble.
CONFIDENCE IN HIS FLEET
FEARS NO FORCE THAT MIGHT
ATTACK HIM.
Rear Admiral in Favor of Liberal
Measures in the Direction of
Autonomy for the
Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA. Dec. 16.â Rear Admiral
Dewey , when ;i correspondent called
upon him to-day, courteously, pleas
antly but absolutely declined to dis
cuss xh" i"iliticaJ situation in the
Philippine Islands, on the ground that
his sphere was purely naval. Regard
ing the possibility of international coni
pltcations, however, the admiral said:
"Prior to the arrival of the monitors
1 feit uneasy, but now I am ready to
hold this position against the whoie
earth."
The admiral seldom goes ashore.. and
he insisted that his interviewer was in
a better position to acquire informa
tion than himself. He then proceeded
to cross-examine the correspondent
about everything on land. He was glad
to learn that the insurgents were re
leasing the" sick Spanish soldiers they
held prisoners, notwithstanding Aguin
aldo's grandiloquent refusal to do so.
This proves . 'at the insurgents are
very conciliatory, in spite of their de
fiant talk. :^V:i ... ÂÂ .
Admiral Dewey always believed that
the Insurgents <rÂ«re friendly, and s
pecially since the warships of our fleet
have visited the Afferent ports ' those
islands, and since some of our officers
have made tours inland, carefully in
vestigating popular sentiment and judi
-iy preaching the gospel of peaceful
settlement everywhere with highly sat*
isia< tory results. A few Influential Fili
pinoÃ, in an ambitious attempt at self
advancement, are clamoring for inde
pendence, though unable, to realize its
true meaning. They are utterly igno
rant ut the difference between the name
and the reality.
'lhe agitatois here invariably admit
that they wuuid be unable to stand
without American protection. But in
spite uÂ£ this, they continue their mean
ingless outcry for Independence and
may possibly create trouble. The ad
miral, however, believes this to be im
probable at the present juncture,
though every trifling incident counts.
However, every day that passes with
out a conflict means so much gain, be
cause the friendly leeling is steadily in
creasing, the incipient roughness is dis
appearing and the agitators are weak
ening.
The newspapers of Manila are doing
particularly valuable work in the simul
taneous publication of conciliatory ar
ticles printed in Spanish and in English.
This course is looked upon as being cer
tain to eliminate the friction which has
existed here.
The admiral is greatly interested in
the movement among the American
â volunteers to obtain their discharges
here and engage in pioneering enter
prises. He believes there is practically
an unlimited field for planters, farmers
and miners here. To thy suggestion
that if the natives prove to be obstrep
erous perhaps they might be handed
over to the Germans or other ungentle
iand-grabbers, the admiral said he be
lieved the Germans now had entirely
abandoned their designs on the Philip
pine Islands, though, formerly, he said,
the German attitude here had caused
him anxiety.
According to recent information re
ceived here the Filipino insurgents are
endeavoring to maintain a brave show
for the purpose of securing the best
terms possible from the Americans. It
is the opinion of our admiral that it
would be advisable for the United
States to pay insurgent troops their
arrears of wages. The whole amount,
would be a comparatively trifling sum
and the payment of the troops would
have a valuable effect and may save
incalculable trouble.
Admiral Dewey was strongly con
vinced that the Filipino insurgents de
serve acknowledgment. He is a be
liever in the practicability of liocral
measures in the direction of local au
tonomy.

AGUINALDO'S POWER

No Security to Property in Provinces and

MANILA. Dec. 16.â Naval and military authorities say that
Ws shington should decide upon a Philippine policy at once. They
think the so-called Philippine republic will soon lose the support of
the country owing to the excessive taxation now imposed upon the
rich natives. In addition, there is no security to property in the
provinces. In my opinion, the popularity of Aguinaldo is wanine:.
lie tried to float a loan of $20,000,000, but the natives refuse to sub
scribe to it. His constant demands will inevitably cause the downfall
of the republic.
An American officer, whose name T am not at liberty to disclose.
is strongly in favor of a decisive blow being struck and American
rule established. He differs from some of his fe.'o officers with re
gard to the formation of mixed regiments of natives and Americans.
In his opinion the military force here ought to be entirely composed
of United States troops.
cials of the United States Embassy, a
representative of the French Foreign
Office and the members of the Ameri
can colony of this city, bade farewell
to the American Peace Commissioners
at the railway station this evening, as
they started on their homeward jour
ney. A special salon car had been pro
vi. 1. d by the railroad company for the
use of the members of the commission.
The friends of the departing commis
sioners gave three cheers and waved
their hats and handkerchiefs as the
train starred.
AGONCILLO'S LATEST PROTEST.
PARIS, Dec. 16.â 1t is learned that
Agoncillo, the representative of Agr.i
naldo, the Philippine leader, has lodged
a strongly worded protest with the
American Peace Commission, which
thus becomes part of the records. It
begins with saying th: t "The very
noble and gallant General Aguinaldo,
President of the Philippine republic,"
has honored him with the post of "offi
cial representative to the very honor
able President of the United States."
Asroncillo then reviews the case at
length, saying that at the time of "im
ploring the armed co-operation of
Aguinaldo and the other Philippine
chiefs. 'both the commander of the Pe
trel, Captain Wood, in Hongkong, be
fore the declaration of war, and the
American Consuls-General Pratt in
Singapore, Wildman at Hongkong and
Williams at Cavite, acting as the in
ternational agents of the great nation,
in the moment of anxiety, offered to
recognize the independence of the Fili
pino nation."
The protests then recite how Admiral
Dewey "by numerous acts" is alleged
to have "recognized the autonomist
sovereignty of .he Filipinos." and in
picturesque language calls forth the
promises and a fulfillment "of the sol
emn declarations made by the illustri
ous William McKlnley that on going to
war he was not guided by the inten
tion of an extension of territory, but
only by the principles of humanity, by
the" duty of liberating tyrannized peo
ples, and by the desire to proclaim the
unalienable rights with their sover
eignty of countries released from the
yoke of Spain."
REGULARS FOR PHILIPPINES.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â Orders
were to-day issued for the immediate
preparation of the following named
regiments of regular infantry for ser
vice in the Philippines. Twelfth, at
Jefferson barracks; Twenty-second, at
Fort Crook, Nebr.; Third, at Fort Snell
ing, Minn.; Seventeenth, at Columbus
Barracks, Ohio, and Fourth, at Fort
Sheridan, 111. In each case the order
states that the date of embarkation and
point of sailing have not yet been de
cided upon, and depend upon the trans
portation facilities, which may become
available.
"It is impossible," the order reads,
"to state the duration of the time of
service of this character at this time,
but preparations should be made with
a view to at least two or three years'
service before returning to the United
States."
TRIP OF TRANSPORT MOBILE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.-The War
Department has received the following
satisfactory report of the first trip of
the new transport ship Mobile, which
made her initial voyage from Savannah
to Havana, arriving there early yester
day morning:

TO IMPROVE THE
MARE ISLAND CHANNEL
WASHINGTON", Dec. 16.â Commodore
Endicott, chief of the bureau of yards
and docks, when visited to-day by The
Call correspondent, said: "In my an
nual report, the full text of which will
be published shortly, I recommend the
improvement of the Mare Island chan
nel. This improvement should be com
menced at the earliest possible day. I
cannot learn that the coast survey or
the War Department has this work in
contemplation, or has even recommend
ed its being done. If the improvement
of the channel should be undertaken
by the War Department it would be
at least two years and a half before
operations would begin, legislative au
thority, preliminary surveys and neces
sary appropriations first having to be
secured. I have therefore recommended
! that the improvement be made by the
Navy Department. If Congress shall
agree at the present session to make
the requisite appropriation the work
! could begin next summer. 1 have
I recommended an appropriation of $350,
j 000 for a channel i>oo feet wide ajid 30
j feet deep at low tide. Without this en
larged channel it would be useless to
j construct a dry dock at Mare Island,
j where the law provides it shall be built,
for our largest warships could not ap
] proach the dock, except at the hour of
! the highest tide. The dock should be
! accessible to the largest battleships at
uny stage of tide. But if it is to be
1 very expensive to maintain this depth
â  of channel I think some other point on
San Francisco Bay would be better. If
j the channel can be maintained without I
; great expense it certainly should be
located at the point named by Con
gress, viz.: Mare Island, where many
millions have already been invested in
the navy yard.
â¢I have also recommended the con
struction of still another dry dock on
the Pacific Coast and that a board of
competent officers be appointed to select
a Bile. I have not suggested a location,
but I think an additional dock should
be chosei) op the Southern California
coast. OUr 'new possessions will neces
sitate keeping a larger naval force in
Pacific wat tb. This, in itself, is an
additional reason, not only for increased
docking facilities on the lower Cali
fornia coast, but also a good reason
why the dock in San Francisco Bay
should be at all times accessible to our
, largest ships of war."

ATTENTION TO
VOLUNTEERS
Shatter's Chief Com
missary Testifies.
AN ABSENCE OF RED TAPE
HOW THE GRAVES OF FALLEN
SOLDIERS WERE MARKED.
Slight Difference of Opinion Between
General Weston and Quarter- -
master General Lud
ington.;
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.â Brigadier-
General Weston, chief commissary of
the Shafter expedition, testified to-day
before the war investigating commis
sion that there was an absence of red
tape methods in feeding the volunteers
at Sibonpy. He said he never heard a
complaint of the condition of the com
missary supplies at the front. Special
efforts had been made in behalf of the
volunteers, whose officers he recognized
sometimes did not quite understand
how to get what was due the men. Sur
geons were given articles from hos
pitals on memorandum, and they were
paid out of the funds at Washington.
Colonel Roosevelt once came to San
tiago and wanted to be buy tomatoes
and extra supplies for his men, and he
refused to let him pay for them, as
there was no need for it. Witness said
he took $5000 with him when he went
to Florida and still has "a lot of it
left."
"Well, you are the only man then,"
interrupted Captain Howell, "who ever
went to Florida and brought any
money back."
Referring to difficulties caused by
the subsistence department depending
on the quartermaster's department for
transportation he said it was a ridicu
lous idea, and the transportation was a
matter he would not like to speak of
without thinking it over," and he had
"thought a heap about it, too."
So far as the food was concerned Gen
eral Weston characterized the Santiago
campaign as a mere bagatelle, the
hardships being trivial compared to his
own experience in frontier Indian cam
paigns, when he and his men were
forced to use the wagon mules for
food.
The Rev. Dr. Henry C. McCook of
Philadelphia, chaplain of the Second
Pennsylvania, and commissioner of
the National Relief Association, said
that on his return from Cuba he had
called on President McKinley, August
6, and added: "If there was anything
I did know and he did not get it out
of me, I am unaware of it. He has
wonderful powers of cross-examina
tion."
The President at that time commis
sioned him to find and permanently
mark the graves of the soldiers and
he did so. He pictured the desolated
conditions of the graves, but said
the names were nearly all marked
Some wounded men had wandered off
and died and their graves remained un
marked. In Santiago when he landed
July 25, there was a dearth of every
thing needed. The medical department
opposed the work of his relief associa
tion, but changed their views later
Quartermaster General Ludineton
testified as to the operations of his de
partment prior to and during the war
In answer to Governor Beaver Gen
eral Ludington said it might be well
to provide against future emergencies
by keeping on hand equipment for at
least two years in advance. This could
be done with many classes of supplies
without danger of deterioration.
General Ludington did not agr^o with
the suggestion of Commissary General
Egan that the commissary department
ought to furnish conking and eating
utensils, and their transportation as
well as provide for food.
Concerning the shipment of medical
supplies, General Ludington said they
were rushed forward as promptly or
more so, than any other supplies, and
he knew of no inp+ance where there had
been delays of weeks in shipping medi
cines from New York to Camn Alg.-r or
from St. Louis to Camp Thomas. This
had been the testimony of numerous
other witnesses. Dr. Connor cited onÂ«
instance where a 200 bed hospital outfit
had been lost between New York and
Fernandina.
Chief Engineer John W. Wilson, a
member of the commission, then testi
fied in detail as to the preparation for
coast defense, including torpedoes. f ( , r
whtoh he had been allotted from the
national fund something less than
J6.000.000.

McKinley Addresses One Thousand

School.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Dec. 16.â The
President and his party were given a
magnificent welcome in the Confeder
acy's first capital to-day. The Presi
dents train was escorted from Atlanta
to Tuskegee, thence here, by the State
Assembly, Governor Johnston, Chief
Justice McClellan and a party of ladies.
The Assembly's train came in ahead of
the President's. At the Union station
the Presidential party was met by the
Governor, committees from the Assem
bly, the Mayor and City Council and
the Commercial and Industrial Associa
tion.
The whole party was taken in car
riages through the large business and
residence streets to the old Confederate
Capitol. The entire route was ablaze
with the national colors, while tremen
dous crowds lined the streets as far as
the eye could reach. No such gathering
has been seen here since Mr. Cleve
land's visit during his first term. Capi
tol Hill was one mass of humanity
when the lines of carriages, escorted by
the local military companies, reached
it at 3 o'clock. When Governor John
ston escorted President McKinley into
the hall there was a tremendous dem
onstration.
Governor Johnston made a brief '
speech in which he took occasion to say i
that Alabama had nothing to take back !
for what she did in 1861, but that she I
was back in the Union to stay, and that j
she welcomed the President of the re
united country to the historic spot
around the assemblage.
In the course of his reply President
McKinley said:
To be welcomed here in the city of!
Montgomery, the lirsc capital of the Con- |
federate Stales, warmly and enthusiastic- |
ally welcomed as the President of a com- I
mon country, has rilled and thrilled me j
with emotion.
The Governor says he has nothing to |
take back. We have nothing to take back I
for having kept you in the i.'nion; we are
glad you did not go out and you are glad j
you stayed in.
Alabama, like all the States of the
Union, and the South, has been loyal to
the flag and steadfastly devoted to the
American nation and American harmony. :
There never has been in the histon- of the
United States such a demonstration of pa
triotism from one end of this country to
the other as in the year just passing; and
never has American valor been more bril- !
liantly illustrated in the bai.ie line on i
shore and on battle ship at sea than by i
tue soldiers and sailors of the United I
States. Everybody is talking of Hobson, '
and justly bo, but I want to thank Mother
nobson in this presence. Everybody is
talking about General Wheeler, one of the
bravest of the brave, but speak 1 want to
of that sweet little daughter that fol
lowed him to Santiago, and ministered to
the sick at Montauk. 1 have spoken in
many places and at many times of the
heroism of the American army and navy,
but in our. recent conflict the whole peo
ple were patriots. Two hundred thousand
men were called for, and a million rushed
to get a place in the ranks, and millions
more stood ready if need be.
I like the feeling of the American people
that we ought not to have a large stand
ing army; hut it has been demonstrated in
the last few months that we need a stanu
ing army large enough to do all the work
required while we are at peace, and only
rely <>n tho great body of the, people in an
emergency to help us fight our battles.
We love peace. We are not a military
nation, but whenever the time of peril
comes the bulwark of this neople rests in
the patriotism of its citizens, and this na
tion will be safe for all time because sev
enty-five millions of people love if and will
give up their lives to sustain and uphold
it.
As soon as he had finished the Gover
nor-started to escort the President
away for a reception at his own home,
hut the audience ; would not have it.
They called for General Wheeler. Gen
eral Shatter, General Lawton. Secre
taries Alger and Long and Postmaster
General Smith. . t
Secretary Long was especially well
received, as he called attention to the
fact that in addition to Wheeler and
i Hobson there was another , Alabama
man who contributed a vast deal in the
success to the war in his important
work in helping fashion the navyâ his
predecessor, Hilary A. Herbert of
Montgomery. â  â¢ . â ;â â ';
After the speech the Presidential
party went to the Governor's office
where a public reception was held for
a half hour.
He next went to meet the colored peo
ple of the city at Old Ship Church,
where 4 great throng received him en
thusiastically. He made a short but
forcible speech there. This ended the
ceremonies here. The party was con
veyed to the train, and at 6:30 o'clock
amid the roar of cannon the President
left for Savannah. The President and
members of his paTty spoke in the
warmest terms of their enthusiastic
reception here.
â¢ TUBKEGEE, Ala.. Dec. 16.â The
Presidential party arrived here at 8
o'clock this morning and was met by
the Mayor and Town Council. The
trip from Atlanta was without incident.
The members of the party entered car
riages and were driven to Boker T.
Washington's school for colored pupils.
On reaching the institution the Pres
ident was ushered into the lecture hall,
his appearance calling forth the heart
iest cheering.' â  ' , Â â¢

UNION PACIFIC TO
GET ALTON ROAD
Requisition of the Property Will
Practically (jive the Vanderbilts
an Ocean to Ocean Line.
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â The Chic -70 and Alton has been or will be
sold to the Union Pacific. This comes from the highest authority.
The official announcement is not made, and there may be tedious
denials, but the statement that thr road will pass to the interests in
dicated is authoritative. The acquisition of this property Rives the
Union Pacific a splendid Chicago. St. Louis and Kansas City outlet
and gives the Vanderbilts practically an ocean to ocean line. The Chi
cago and Alton road earns at tiresent something like an average of
$2,500,000 annually as the minimum, and has other incomes of say
$233,000. The road, therefore, represents to the purchaser a net earn
ing capacity, after paying fixed charges, of approximately $1,700,000.
Furthermore, the bulk of the company's present funded debt bears
a high rate of interest, none of it less than 6 per cent, and practical
ly all of it matures between now and 1903. There is, therefore, a very
important possible savins: by refunding the bonds at lower interest
rate. At 3VÂ£ per cent the saving would be about <270,000 annually.
Adding this to the earning capacity stated, the purchaser of the
Chicago and Alton can figure apparently on an average annual net
income of $200,000. At a price of $175 for the company's common and
$200 for preferred stock, which were the figures given out to-day, the
money required to buy the Alton road is about $40,000,000. The as
sumed net earning capacity is equivalent to 5 per cent on this pur
chase price.
ment, a symmetrical scholastic unify
which has been well called a model for
the colored schools of the South. Cer
tain it is that a pupil bent on fitting him
self or herself for mechanical work can
here have the widest choice of useful and
domestic occupations.
In common with the Hampton Institute
in Virginia, the Tuskegee. Institute has
been and is to-day of inestimable value
in sowing the seeds of good citizenship.
Institutions of their standing and worthy
patronage form a steadier and more pow
erful agency for the good of all good con
cerned than any yet proposed or suggested.
The practical is here associated with the
academic, which encourages both learn
ing and industry. No country, epoch or
race has a monopoly upon knowledge.
Some have easier and necessarily better
opportunties for self-development. What
we can obtain here free most have to pay
for perhaps by hardships, labor, mental
struggles and difficulties. In this coun
try all can have the opportunity for bet
tering themselves, provided they exercise
intelligence and perseverance and their
motives and conduct are worthy. No
where are such facilities for universal
education found as in the United States.
They are accessible to every boy and girl,
white or black.
To the pupils here assembled I extend
my especial congratulations that the fa
cilities for advancement afforded to them
are so numerous and so inviting. Those
who are here for the time being have the
reputation of the institution in charge, and
should, therefore, be all the more careful
to guard it worthily. Others who have
gone before you have made great sacri
fices to reach the present results. What
you do will affect not only those who
come after you here, but many men and
women whom you may never meet.
The result of your training and work here
will eventually be felt either directly or
indirectly in nearly every part of the
country.
In comparing the past with the present
you should be especially grateful that it
has been your good fortune to come with
in the good influences of such an in
stitution as this ut Tuskegee, and that
you are under the guidance of such a j
strong leadejr. I thank him most cor- j
dially for the pleasure of visiting this in- j
stitution, and I bring to all here asso
ciated my good-will and the best wishes
of your countrymen, wishing you the re
alization of success in whatever under
taking may hereafter engage you.
The train left a few minutes after 1
o'clock for Montgomery.

passes will derive so much benefit. The
contract between the railroad company
and the California Construction Com
pany of San Francisco, associated with
C. M. Wooster and A. K. Whitten of
San Jose, under which work was com
menced yesterday, requires the comple
tion, equipment and delivery ready for
operation to the railroad company of
the first two divisions of the roadâ that
portion between Monterey and Hollis
terâas well ag an 1800-foot wharf at
Monterey, by the 15th of June, 1899. The
people now feel that the long and un
tiring efforts of the promoters of the
project have at last reached a success
ful culmination.
Colonel A. W. Jones, president of the
railroad company, in speaking of the
enterprise to The Call correspondent
to-day, said that Senator John T. Mor
gan of Alabama was really the first
projector of the Monterey and Fresno
Railroad. During his visit to this
coast in 1891 he was so imbued with
the advantages of opening the country
between deep water at the bay of
Monterey and the San Joaquin Valley
that he journeyed across country from
Monterey to Fresno and made a pub
lic speech in the latter city, setting
forth the advantages which, in his
opinion, were to be derived from a
railroad connection between the two
cities.
In 1892 correspondence was opened
between prominent business men of
Fresno, Hollister and Monterey and a
moneyed institution of the East, as a
result of which Colonel Jones was sent
to California to look into and report
upon the proposition. He, like Senator
Morgan, was thoroughly imbued with
the importance and necessity of the
project, and so reported. As a conse
quence a company was organized in
January, 1893, with the following di
rectory: A. W. Jones, AlaKander Gor
don ar>d William L.. Walter of Fresno,
Dr. Thomas Flint, and William Palmtag
of Hollister, W. J. Hill of Salinas and
H. A. Greene of Monterey.
Owing to the monetary stringency !
from that period up to the present
year nothing has been accomplished,
except to survey and locate the road
from Monterey to Fresno, obtain rights
of way and terminal facilities and a
very valuable water-front concession
from the Trustees of the city of Mon
terey. About eleven miles of the road
out of Monterey has been graded.
At the last meeting of the stock
holders it was determined to extend the
line of the road from Fresno east, in
order to tap the timber and mineral
belt of the Sierra Nevada, making the
entire length of the road about 260
miles. The line as located runs from
Monterey to Salinas, San Juan, Hol
lister, through Little Panoche Pass in
the Coast Range, crossing the San
Joaquin River at Firebaugh, thence
direct to Fresno and Minaret Pass in
the Sierra Nevada.
"The bonds of the company," said
Colonel Jones, "have been underwritten
by a syndicate of New England capi
talists and the road will be built and
equipped by American capital. The en
tire remaining line will be put under
contract by the time the present con
tractors complete it to HoJ'ister, and
we expect it to be finished to Fresno
within the ensuing year."

money, and returned to peaceful pur

Yumantse received an opaque blue but
ton, an official hat having peacock
feathers and a commission as captain
in the *'hin- -se army. In consideration of
those Yumantse turned over Missionary
Fleury and other hostages to the au
thorities at Lungshui, upon the assem

I IÂ«s, who had fled to Chungking
during the rebellion. The Szechuen au

1 2Â±J^Â£Â± ' C^ NJ If many modern
3 women are much
less active and more given to idleness than
the stately dimies of yore, it is because they
enjoy a smaller measure of good health.
A woman who suffers from weakness and
disease of the distinctly feminine organs,
who is racked with painf and tortured with
headaches and nervousness, cannot be ac-
tive and helpful. Idleness and invalidism
are the natural results of suffering of this
description: The poor invalid woman is
not at fault, save in her ignorance of her
own physical make-up or neglect of her
womanly hr?Uh.
Thousand* of women are neglectful in
this way because they shrink from the em-
barrasMng examinations and local _ treat-
ment insisted upon by the majority of
ob-cure physicians. Dr. R. V. Pierce, for
thirty years chief consulting physician to
the Invalid^' Hotel and Surgical Institute,
at Buffalo, N. V.. has discovered a wonder-
ful medicine that cures all diseases peculiar
to women, in the privacy of the home, with-
out the necessity of these embarrassing
ordeals. This great medicine is known as
Dr. Piercc's Favorite Prescription. It acts
directly on the delicate and important or-
gans that bear the burdens of wifehood
and motherhood. It makes them strong,
healthy and vigorous. It- heals internal
ulceration and inflammation and stops
debilitating drains. It transforms weak,
nervous invalids into healthy worffen.

CARLOAD OF WINE
SEIZED IN MEXICO
Authorities Confiscate a Shipn)er)t
From tt}e California WiQe
Association.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 16.â The statement of the Two Republics
that a confiscation had been made of California wine consigned to
Frederick Navarro is evidently correct, but it would seem from
statements made by persons who evidently are responsible for the
shipment that H. J. Woollacott is in no way to blame. A thorough
investigation at this end conclusively shows that Mr. Woollacott,
though the order was given to him. was in no way interested in the
shipment. Cosmo Morgan, the Southern California representative pt
the California Wine Association of San Francisco, is the person
through whom Mr. Woollacott gave the order for the carload of wine,
which was sent to the City of Mexico. Mr. Morgan was seen to-day
and made this statement with regard to the order:
"I have only to say that I received the order from Mr. Woolla
cott as the representative of the California Wine Association. I tele
graphed instructions to San Francisco to ship the wine. It was a car
load lot and it was consigned to Mr. Woollacott's agents in the City
of Mexico. The wine was shipped direct from San Francisco and Mr.
Woollacott never saw it. If there was any fault that fault lies with
the California Wine Association in not analyzing the wine prior to
shipment. My Judgment tells me, though, that the wine was right. If
it was not Mr. Woollacott is absolutely without fault."
In addition to this statement Mr. Morgan addressed the following
communication directly to the editor:
To the Editor of The Call: My attention has been called to an article
appearing in a Mexican paper, in which it is stated some wines shipped to
the City of Mexico by H. J. Woollacott of Los Angeles had been seized
by the Governmental authorities on the ground that they were adulter
ated. This statement is false. The wines seized were shipped by the Cali
fornia Wine Association of San Francisco, which association Is solely re
sponsible for the shipment.
COSMO MORGAN, Agent California Wine Association
Winemakers and dealers in this section of the State are very much
aroused over the charge that has been made and resent It.
GRIEVANCES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE REFORMERS.
BALTIMORE, Dec. 16.â The National Civil Service Reform Association,
In conventicm here at its second day's session, devoted almost the en
tire morning to a discussion of the report of the committee on reso
lutions, which charged the present administration with a violation of the
spirit of the civil service rules. The resolutions, as finally adopted, congratu
late the lovers of good government on the failure of the recent attack in
Congress upon the merit system: assert that the con% - ention has heard with
grave concern the report that the President of the United States intends
tc withdraw from civil service rules a large number of positions under the
Government, and express the belief that such action is contrary to the in
terests of the public service; cite instances of alleged departure from the
civil service rules during the past year; charge that the administration has
failed to redeem its promise to "extend the rule wherever possible," and, In
conclusion, say that the rule of the newly acquired dependencies will result
In disaster and disgrace if conducted on the plans of the spoils politician.
The following officers were elected: President, Carl Schurz; vice presi
dents, Charles Francis Adams of Boston, Henry Hitchcock of St. Louis,
Augustus McDoncrugh of New York, H. C. Lea of Philadelphia, Franklin
MacVeagh of Chicago, Bishop H. C. Potter of New York, Bishop H. P.
Ryan of Philadelphia and W. A. Potts of New York.
The convention closed with a banquet at the Hotel Rennert. The speak
ers were Carl Schurz, Congressman J. H. Gillette of Massachusetts. Presi
dent. Proctor of the Civil Service Commission, D. D. Fouke of Buffalo and
Dr. Fabian Franklin of the Baltimore News.
CUSTOMS TARIFF FOR THE ISLAND OF CUBA.
WASHINGTON. Pec. 16.â President McKinley before leaving for the
South last Tuesday signed an executive order establishing a customs
tariff for the island of Cuba, to go into effect January 1 next. This
tariff is based upon the report and recommendations made by Hon. Ro-bert
P. Porter, Special Commissioner of the United States, who was sent to Cuba
some months ago for the special purpose of making an investigation of the
subjects of revenue and customs of the island.
The list of articles which may be imported into Cuba free of duty in
cludes trees and plants in the natural state; trained animals, carriages,
theatrical properties and similar objects imported temporarily for public
entertainment; used furniture of persons going to settle in the island; wear
ing apparel, jewels, portable tools and instruments, etc., for personal use of
travelers entering the island; stone for paving purposes; plows, hoes, hatch
ets, machetes and other agricultural implement* not machinery; quinine and
all alkaloids of salts of cinchona bark; hemp, flax and ramie: spun jute for
the manufacture of sugar hags; bonks, maps. etc.. for use of schools; coal
and coke; mineral, carbonated or seltzer waters, root beer, ginger ale, etc.;
also samples of felt, wall paper and tissues, and of trimming, when in small
pieces and of no commercial value.
HALF THE POPULATION KILLED OR STARVED.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.â The terrible state of affairs existing in the
western province of Cuba is shown in this report to the War De
partment from General Davis:
PINAR DEL RIO. Dec. 14. 1898.â Adjutant General. Washington: Arrived hore
last night. Troops comfortably encamped; have all required supplies; have been
received with greatest enthusiasm and rejoicing. Civil Governor left province
when Spanish troops retired. The Alcalde called, tendered his services. A
small Cuban force Is in town as police. Good order prevails everywhere. Shall
raise flag to-morrow In presenece of troops and citizens. Treasury empty, and
only means of replenishing it is a system of taxation almost to verge of confisca
tion. No custom-houses in this province. Country of great fertility and beauty,
but ravaged almost to destruction. Assured by responsible citizens and foreign
ers that one-half the former population has been killed or starved to doath.
Colonel Seyburn, with two battalions, at Guanajay. He is ordered to occupy
Mariel with a detachment. No sickness. DAVIS.
WITCHCRAFT AMONG ALASKA INDIANS.
TACOMA, Dec. 16.â The latest case of witchcraft among Alaska Indiana
Is reported from Ritka, where a young Indian became sick with con
sumption and commenced spitting blood. His relatives sought the ad
vice of an Indian doctor at Klllisnoo, who was SO years old and blind. This
was done, notwithstanding that there was a white physician in attendance.
The witch doctor informed them that the young man had been bewitched
by a boy under the influence of a woman. The whole party returned to
Sitka in their canoes. A meeting was held and twb women were notified
that they were witches and that they, influenced two boys in the village.
The boys were sent for and admitted that they were under the Influence
of the two women, who put thorn in a trance and made them do whatever
they were told. These boys are not bright and one of them is said to be
an idiot. In the meantime the sick Indian has died.
TUNNEL FOR RAPID TRANSIT ON MANHATTAN ISLAND
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â Interest In the subject of a tunnel to give rapid
transit throughout the length of Manhattan Island is revived by the
publication to-day of an interview with Richard Croker, in which It Is
asserted that work on such a tunnel will be begun within a year.
Croker is further quoted as saying that the enterprise will be undertaken by
private capital, "which will meet with every proper encouragement from
the present city government and from Tammany Hall." Croker says that
the city has neither the money nor the credit, under the law, to build the
tunnel, which he estimates will cost $50,000,000.
ISLAND CATHOLICS TO ENJOY AMPLE LIBERTY
LONDON, Dec. 17. â The Rome correspondent of the Daily Chronicle says:
In response to the Vatican's inquiry on the subject, President Mc-
Klnley has sent an assurance that the Catholics in Cuba and the Phil
ippines will enjoy the same ample liberty as the Catholics in
America.
The Washington Government has also promised the Pope that measures
will be taken to prevent provisional governments despoiling convents or
seizing ecclesiastical property. The Pope has sent his warmest thanks to
President McKinley.

PLANS FOR
FERRY DEPOT
NEVER SIGNED
Budd's Name Was
Not Attached.
STATE ARCHIVES RANSACKED
NO INDORSED PRINTS ARE TO BE
FOUND.
It Is Claimed That This Really Mat- j
ters Little, Inasmuch as the
Contractors Have All
Been Paid. ,
Sr>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 16.â There has
been a raking over of documents at the I
Capitol in search of something bearing
the Governor's signature in connection j
with the plans for the union ferry de
pot at San Francisco.
It is asserted here that the plans and
specifications of the building have
never been signed by oGvernor Budd j
or the State Board of Examiners, as ;
the general building law of 1876 re- â 
quires. This law also requires that j
the plans and specifications must be |
filed with the State Controller, but |
the discovery was made to-day that j
neither the copy nor the original of
such plans is on file with that official, j
or with the Governor, Secretary of j
State or anybody else. The only thing
that the State Capitol can show in the I
way of depot plans and specifications j
is a set of blue prints without signa- j
tures, which has been treasured in the j
vault where the State archives are pre
served. It is declared here that unless
the regular plans bear the proper signa- j
tures the contracts let upon them for ,
the construction of the depot were in
valid.
The building act of 1876 requires that
plans and specifications for public
Governor, Treasurer and Secretary of
State. This act. was amended in 1891
and again in 1895. The last amendment
enabled the Harbor Commissioners to
segregate bids so that they would not
be compelled to award the entire work
to one contractor.
F. S. Stratton, attorney Of the board,
rendered an opinion to the commis
sion that the act of 1876 did not apply
to the State Board of Harbor Commis
sion* rs. A similar opinion was ren
dered by Tip y L. Ford, who succeeded
Mr. Stratfon as attorney of the com
mission. The question raised was taken
t<i the Superior Court and Judge San
derson decided in effe< t that ihe Harbor
Commissioners were not bound to pro
ceed under the act of ISTtJ. The com
missioners, therefore, contended that
the approval of the plans and specifica
tions by the Governor, Treasurer and
Se< tary of State was not required.
The controversy would excite wider
public interest if the fact was not es
tablished that all the contractors have
btren paid tor the work performed in
the construction of the depot.
ENGLAND IS NOT
READY FOR WAR YET
Significant Remark of Premier Salis-
bury at a Dinner Given in
His Honor.
LONDON, Dec. 16.â The Marquis of
Salisbury, at a banquet given this
evening in bis honor at the Constitu
tional club, devoted his speech in reply
to a toast to his health to home affairs
and to the general principles for the
conduct of his foreign policy, without
direct reference to my particular ques
tion.
"The Government," he said, "should
â  be judged not on individual items, but
j on the Buccesa of a policy as a whole.
I If a Minister Roes to war on a trivial
I matter he may find himself without
j the support of the peopl*. This should
I be considered when people ask why we
nave not pushed to the point of war
j some secondary differences. Before
condemning us for not going to war
they should be sure there are no other
complications in view compelling us to
economize the force at the Govern
ment's disposal.
"This is a matter of businesslike cal
culation. The more the empire ex
tends the more necessary to judge mat
t'-rs from this standpoint. It is dan
geroua to let rhapsody take the place
of calculation. Our strength must be
used unfailingly, but prudently."
Referring to the "difficulty of taking
the people into a Government's confl-
I dence in matters of foreign policy" he
I said:
"I have often felt the want of such
an institution ;;s the United States
Foreign Relations Commitee. It is im
possible here, but it must be a great
j advantage for a Minister to be able
! to meet persons not of bis own political
opinion and to explain to them the rea
sons for bis action."

ers to-day were Hill of Connecticut, in
its support and Bell (Pop.) of Colorado,
Sulzer (D.) of New York, Maxwell

HONOLULU, Dec. 9.â Harold M. Se
"â¢â all, who is President McKinley's rep
resentative at this place, is making a
fight for the position of Governor. His
strength at Washington consists of
Mark Hanna and Senator Frye of
Maine. His strength at Honolulu con-
slsts of the indorsement of the central
committee of the American Union par
ty, an organization which was original
ly formed for the purpose of aiding the
annexation cause. Many prominent
men feel confident that President Dole
will be appointed, or some other man
who has been a resident of this coun
try for years. Sewall's friends are
hopeful. It is claimed that an effort is
being made to secure the indorsement
of a large number of native Hawaiians.
A petition is now being circulated for
that purpose. While Sewall's name is
not mentioned, the document reads to
the effect that the native Hawaiians
desire President McKinley not to ap
point to the office of Governor any per
son connected with the recent revolu
tion on the islands. At the same time
the Hawaiians are about to petition
France to interfere and restore the
monarchy.
President Dole will leave for Wash
ington on the 20th, to be present when
the Hawaiian commission presents its
report to Congress.
W. A. Kinney wilL sail on the 27th for
Washington, to represent the Hawaiian
Planters' Association during the debate
upon territorial matters in Congress.
At a meeting of the Planters' Asso
ciation held yesterday, an interesting
and important labor proposition was
read and discussed. It came from a
society in England, an<l the laborers
offered compose a colony of a religious
sect resembling Quakers, natives of
Russia.
The colony of which 7000 men. women
and children are available for service
in Hawaii, has been practically hunted
to earth by the Russian authorities for
years. An important clause in their re
ligious ireed forbids taking of life for
any reason whatsoever. This unfits
then for duty as soldiers, and the Rus
sian Government has been unable to in
duce any of them to bear arms. Nat
urally, they were, in consequence, sus
pected as opponents of the Government
and have been persecuted.
The society which addresses the local
people was formed in England for the
express purpose of taking the Quakers
away from Russia and giving them a
start in some other country. It is stat
ed that there is now $23,000 on hand to
aid the colony of 7000 souls in reaching:
a desirable haven.
While no action was taken, the propo
sition was thought well of.
Major Charles E. Davis, sureeon of
tho First New York Volunteers, has
been relieved from duty and has been
ordered to join his regiment, now at
San Francisco. His place will be taken
by Major Marshall W. Wood, surgeon
of the United States army.
LEPROSY IS DYING
OUT IN THE ISLANDS
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Dec. 9.â From official
figures It is shown that since January,
1866, the date of the beginning of segre
gation, there have been about 5200 per
sons listed in the books of the Board
of Health as lepers. Out of this num
ber the total of all foreigners is but
142. There are no Japanese on the list,
as their national representative invari
ably has his countrymen sent home to
be treated in Japan instead of allowing
them to go to Molokai.
There have undoubtedly been a few
foreigners not recorded, having been

obstacle placed to their departure is
the willingness of the transportation
companies to- take them. It is a fact
that not only is leprosy diminishing,
but that it would be extremely difficult
to meet with one person who is afflicted
in a fortnight's search. This is through
the admirable manner in which segre
gation at the settlement on Molokai has
been carried out during the past thirty
three years. The number of sick at the
settlement does not materially de
crease, but the reason for this is the
more thorough enforcement of the law
of segregation and the more complete
removal from outside places of all per
sons afflicted with the disease in the
earliest stages. Formerly a much
larger proportion of those sent to Molo
kai were in the more advanced stage
of the malady and death overtook them
quicker. The mortality rate is rapidly
becoming smaller and up to last month
there had only been ninety-eight
deaths for the year and the shipments
to the settlement for the year num
bered sixty-seven. In 1873 there were
shipped to the settlement 457; in ISBB,
T. 79; in 1839, 308, and 1883, 301. The
largest number of deaths in a year
were 209 in 1879 and 212 in 1888 and 1893.
From November, 1865, to the end of
the present year -he cost of maintain
ing the leper colony has been over $2.
000.000. The appropriations gradually
increased from $15,900 to $141,962 for the
biennial term of 1882-4. to $225,226 in
1888-90. The appropriation for 1896-98

BIG SMASH UP
ON THE FERRY
BOAT BAY CITY
Walking Beam Caxne
Down With a Crash.
NO PASSENGERS WERE HURT
A WILD STAMPEDE WHEN THE
ACCIDENT HAPPENED.
The Steamer Was Close to Her Slip
at the Time, So She Easily
Docked to Let the Pas
sengers Land.
There was a. scene of wild excitement
on the narrow gauge ferry boat Bay City
at 9:25 a. m. yesterday. As the steamer
'â was approaching the slip on this side the
â walking beam broke in two places and
fell with a crash into the cabin. Splinters
and broken glass flew in all directions, but
by a miracle no one was hurt. The pas
sengers wore badly scared and there were
cries of "Run for your life!" "Where are
the life preservers?" "The boiler has ex
ploded!" "Save me!" "We're sinking!"
etc."; but none of them got worse than a
scare.
The Bay City was close to her landing
fit the time so the tide carried her against
the end of the slip. A few minutes later
the tug Reliance came along ,md pushed
her into the dock and the passengers were
landed. The steamer Newark was at once
put into commission and went out in
charge of the Bay City's crew on the regu
lar time.
The Bay City left the narrow gauge slip
on the Alameda side at 9 a. m. Owing to
the heavy fog Bhe came across thÂ« bay
slowly and it was 9:25 a. m. before she
reached this side. Captain Bradley had
runK tip to '"stop her" and the engii
bud his hand on the lever ready to execute
the order when the crash came.
The walking beam is supported on what
is known as the gallows frame. On one
end of the beam is the piston rod which
drives it. On the other end is the con
necting rod, joining the working end of
the beam to the crank on the paddle
wheel shaft, which drives the boat. Luck
ily the walking beam broke when the
bottom of the connecting rod was swung
inward, and in consequence when thÂ«
crash came the broken portion fell out
ward and into the cabin. Had the hot-"
torn been swung outward at the time,
connecting rod and everything else would
have gone into the engine room and then
what would have happed can only be sur
mised. One thing is certain, there would
have been considerable loss of life.
The connecting rod fell across one of
the iron braces that runs across the up
per deck. This brace was bent almost
double but it prevented the rod from con
tinuing its downward course into the low
er deck.
Carl F. Lebners, United States inspectoi
of steam vessels for Alaska, was on the
Bay City at the time of the accident. ' "IV
that accident had been planned the en
gines couldn't have been in a safer po
sition," said he. yesterday. "When the
walking beam broke the connecting rod
and the broken portion of beam were
thrown outward Instead of into the engine
room. The connecting rod is bent from
striking the iron brace and the smash-up
was general. It was a most remarkable
accident and a very lucky one (if an acci
dent can be called lucky,) for everybody
concerned." . . - . .
Travelers by the ferry steamers will re
member that" at each end of. the ongine
room Inclosure there are small round set
tees. On the one near the connecting rod
end yesterday morning were Joseph L.
"Wlllcutt. secretary of the Southern Pa
cific Railway and Market street cable sys
tem; Henry McPike. the attorney, and C.
D. Bell. Broken triads and pieces of tim
ber fell In sh<iw<-rs around them, while a.
piece of the walking-beam fell right be
tween tlir-m. yet all three escaped unin
jured. Mi i 'ike rushed along the deck
yelling: "The boiler has not exploded. It
is only the walking-beam. There's no
danger. "
Mr. Bell's description of the affair is
short and graphic: "When the crash
came 1 didn't wait to find out what had'
happened, but I ran like hâ 1 for the lowir
deck. When I got there I found out what
was the matter."
Joseph L. Willcutt got away from the
dangetous spot leisurely. At a safe dis
tance he surveyed the wreck, brushed the
chips from his overcoat and murmured,
"Pretty close call." He was one of the
last to leave the steamer.
Captain Bradley was as cool as an Ice
berg. He g-ot out of the pilot house, and
addressing the passengers fn a slow and
distinct voice said: "Don't get frightened,
ladies and gentlemen. There is absolutely
no danger. Just have patience and you
will all be landed In a few minutes."
Strange to say. the women were cooler
headed than the mpn. Some of the latter
lost their wits completely, and six young
fellows took a break-neck jump from the
forward part of the vessel to the apron.
Another climbed on to the upper deck of
the Bay City and from thrre got on to
the lender piles alongside which the ff-rry
wai lying and made his escape in that
manner. Others secure.! nf,. preservers
and put them on. while a few stood ready
to help the women and do whatever was
necessary.
The place where the walking-beam first
gave way had been cracked for a lone
time, as the rust stains showed plainly on
the facÂ«\ The wonder Is that the acci
dent did not happen years ago.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1898.
ONE of the best known person
ages in the diplomatic service
at Washington, D. C, is Mun-
Yew Chung, the official inter
preter to "Wu Ting-fung, the
Chinese Minister to this country. Chung
arrived in this city yesterday with his
family on the Gaelic and will shortly
leave for the national capital. It was
his intention to remain here a week as
the guest of the Consul of his country,
but on his arrival at the Grand he
found a dispatch from the Minister at
Washington instructing him to report
at once.
Chung went to China last July on a
vacation. He has the reputation in the
diplomatic circles at Washington of
speaking the most perfect English of
any interpreter in the diplomatic ser
vice. He is a gentleman of charming
manners and very highly educated. He
is a great devotee of music, and last
winter, when the grand opera was in
Washington, he was seen in his private
bbx at each performance. He frequent
ly gives theater parties, which are at
tended by the most prominent society
women.
Yung states that his Government has
accredited to Wu Tins-fang the coun
tries of Spain and Peru, as well as that
of the United States, and that the Min
ister will make a visit to Spain In the
spring.
Before entering the diplomatic service
Chung was connected with the railway
noon on a bench warrant issued by Judge
Mogan and is held <>n $2tXK) bonds. He was
arrested s^n>' months ago on a warrant
charging him with obtaining money by
false pretenses cm tho complaint of John
Macdonald of the Pacific Investment and
Loan Company. The case was continued
from time to time, but yesterday it was
set for a hearing. AY hen it was called
Robinson was not present, although he
had been around the courtroom all morn-
Ing, and the Judge issued the bench war
rant and continued the case till Monday.
Whisky and Gas Did It.
Thomas McGreevy, a clerk lately em
ployed in the powder works at Santa Cruz,
arrived in this city a few weeks ago from
Watsonville and took a room at 25 Ninth
street,' where he "was found dead at 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon. An open gas
jet told the story of how he came to his
death. He had been indulging in stron"
drink during the past week and it is bup
posed that in turning off the light in his
room he accidentally turned on the r-is
jet. permitting the deadly fluid to escape
Among his effects were papers showing
that his home was in Ban Rafael and that
he has a brother living in San Leandro
Alameda County. '

THE DECISION
ON A FOUL

Was Disqualified.
JOCKEY BULLMAN SUSPENDED
RUBICON CANTERED IN AN EASY
WINNER,
Dr. Bernays Proved a Surprise â Los
Medanos Struck Easy Game.
Three First Choices
in Front.
The handicap at Inglcside yesterday in
which Miss Rowena, Novia, Valcno|f>nne
and Midlight were starters, developed in
to one of the nolsest sessions of the whole
meeting at the local track. Of course,
popular feeling: nnd the public's dollars
were all with Miss Rowena and her 114
pounds, the mare going to the post a 6 to
5 favorite. Of the other three. Novia
caught the general fancy and was heavily
supported with her light impost of S7
pounds. Valencionne,' a "lobster" the day
previous, was also well played. From the
very outset the race was a graphic dis
play of rough riding. The favorite was
away none too well, and Piggott hustled
her hard to get to the front. Bullman,
on Midlight. sought, the rail, and in his
effort to get there, caused Devln. astride
Novia, to pull Up. At the far turn Powell,
with the leg up on Valencienne, was lift
ed high in the air. Turning into the
stretch, Piggott tried to carry- Midlight
on the outside into the phubbery on a
neighboring hillside, and Bullman, on the
latter mare, objected. In the shuffle
Novia got another bumping. Finally
straightened away, Midlight got through
and beat Novia nearly three lengths. Af
ter a consultation, in which all but Presi
dent Crocker bad a word, the judges dis
qualified Midlight and suspended Bullman
for thirty days. Plggotfs rough tactics
were entirely overlooked, though equally
palpable.
The track was a sea of sticky mud, but
the talent had perused the "dope" book
with unusal care, and were in good form.
Three favorites were thrown down, but
the books laid aside little coin
Los Medanos had nothing to beat and
made a gallop of the opening event for
2-year-olds, at six furlongs. Tirade, the
new-comer in the business, got the place
from Glengaber.
The play on Rubicon to win the mile
run that followed began at supper time
the night before, when the overnight
books laid 5 to 2 against the big horse.
He went to the post a 7 to 5 favorite, and
won by himself. Topmast took the place
from Cromwell. The judges stood for the
race and all winning tickets were cashed.
The mile and a sixteenth selling run
was awarded to Major Hooker, the Corrl
gan entry. He had nothing to boat, ac
cording to the conditions, and won at
leisure. Hohenlohe downed the other
canines for the place.
Barney Schreiber's Imperious looked
far and "away the best for the seven fur
long run that followed, and was exten
sivtly backed at odds of 4 to 5. In a drive
the last sixteenth, he was beaten a short
head by Dr. Bernays, a 12 to 1 chance, ex
cellently ridden by Charley Gray. Lady
Britannic was third.
Prince Tyrant was sent to the post a
4 to 5 chance for the final six furlong spin,
but was beaten out by Dick Behan, at
one time as good as 6 to 1 in the betting.

ROSSER HAS
ESCAPED THE
PENITENTIARY
The Jury Acquits Him
of Murder.
MORALLY IRRESPONSIBLE
SUCH WAS THE OPINION OF
THOSE WHO FREED HIM.
Tears Flow From the Eyes of Father
and Counsel When the Verdict
Is Announced â He Will
Soon Start Home.
Walter RoMeT, the youthful soldier who
shot and killed Henry Hildebrand, has
been acquitted. The jury that for many
days listened to the evidence accumulated
for and against the prisoner has set him
free, and within the next few days, with
his aged father, he will start on his jour
ney to the State of his birth.
Wednesday afternoon and all day
Thursday counsel for the prosecution and
defense argued the case. When it was
called yesterday morning It was not he
fore Judge Wallace but before Judge
Dunne, who presided in the absence of
Judge Wallace, who is confined to his
home with fever. Judge Dunne read the
instructions to the jury previously pre
pared by Judg-e Wallace. The instruc
tions were the same as those given at the
first trial, going into details regarding the
responsibility for a crime committed when
under the influence of liquor voluntarily
taken, and crime committed through the
effects of a drug secretly adminstered in
liquor which the perpetrator of the crime
haii a legal right to drink.
The jury retired to deliberate shortly bo
fore noon. At noon it was taken to lunch
and about 1 o'clock returned to the jury
room. It is understood that on the first
ballot three voted for conviction of mur

der In the second degree, while nine voted
for acquittal. The jury then argued the
matter for almost three hours; another
ballot was taken and all agreed upon a
verdict of acquittal. Three rings of the
bell announced to defendant, counsel and
court frequenters that a verdict had been
reached and Judge Dunne was summoned.
The jury was liroiiKht into court and in
answer to the question of the clerk stated
that a verdict of "not guilty" had been,
found. â¦
There was no demonstration. The pris
oner sat quiet as a graven image, while
the aged father let his head fall on his
son's shoulder and General Barnes, too,
was overcome with emotion and could not
restrain his tears.-
In a short time the father of the young 1
man recovered and hurried from the
courtroom to telegraph the news to the
anxious ones at homo. Judge Dunne or
dered the jury and prtsone? discharged,
and Ropser. a deputy sherijf on either

courtroom and joined his father down

CLAMOR FOR THEIR PAY.
Workmen at the Charity Bazaar Will
Sue for Wag-es.
The laborers employed at the Charity
Bazaar at the Mechanics' Pavilion have
come to the conclusion that if they get
any pay for their work they will have to
make a fight for it. The first movement
in this direction was made by placing
their claims against the management in
the hands of Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald. Thirteen claims in all, amount
ing to about $300, have been presented In
the hope that the State officers will be
able to induce the managers of the
bazaar, by a lawsuit or otherwise, to
pay the men what is due them. Nearly
all of the debts for labor were contracted
by Captain St. Hubert, and although he
has ostensibly turned the management of
the fair over to H. Barling and the latter
has given the business over into the care
of T. P. Robinson and S. Leverloh, still
the claims will be pressed against St.
Hubert.
Held for Assault to Murder.
John Mahoney. who stabbed Charles
Callolds so seriously at the Salvation
Army shelter, New Montgomery Etreet,
November 12. that it was feared he would
die, was yesterday held by Judge Mogan
to answer before the Superior Court on,
a charge of assault to murder in $2000
bonds. Calloids was able to appear in
court and give his testimony.
Prominent Preacher Here.
The Rev. J. Colquohoun Christie and

Great Art Features.
Its illustrations will continue to be one of the magazine's
special point: of distinction. The best artists, no less than the
best writers, will be contributors through the coming year. As
pictures in McClure's are published primarily to illustrate some-
thing, and not simply because they are pictures, the announce-
ments of articles are, in some measure, an announcement also of
the pictures. For instance, the new Kipling serialâ th 3 fact in-
cidentally mentioned that these connected stories are all illus-
trated by L. Raven-Hill is scarcely less of a distinction for the
magazine than that the text is by Kipling. We have in prepara-
tion, however, a number of articles in which the interest and dis-
tinction is primarily artistic.
C. D. GIBSON'S EXPERIENCES IN EGYPT.
Last spring Mr. Gibson visited Egypt in the Interest of Mc-
Clure's Magazine. He studied the country not only from the
point of view of the artist, but from the point of view of a keen
American observer who could not fail to remark the present con-
dition of the Egyptians and the influence and effects of the Eng-
lish control in Egypt. The fall of Khartoum, which seals the
destiny of Egypt as an English colony, adds a peculiar timely
Interest to Mr. Gibson's work. The illustrations will be most
elaborate, and the articles will show Mr. Gibson as a writer of
very unusual qualities.
LIFE MASKS OF GREAT AMERICANS.
A New Series of Unpublished Browere Casts From Life.
When we published last year the series of Browere's Life
Masks of Great Americana with Mr. Charles Henry Hart's ro-
mantic story of how the masks were made, then lost, and then
recovered, it was remarked on every side that we had made a
most interesting and valuable contribution to the pictorial his-
tory of the country. A second series of these marvelous masks
is in preparation, giving the living images of Dolly Madison, De
Witt Clinton, Gilbert Stuart, Martin Van Buren, Commodore Da-
vid Porter, Attorney General Rush, Charles Francis Adams and
John Quincy Adams. It will be found quite equal in human and
historical Importance to the earlier series.

TRUE STORIES OF THE EAST AND THE
WEST.
By W. A. Fraser.
Mr. Fraser is a civil engineer, and his profes-
sional work has taken him into many parts of India
and about all parts of Canada. And wherever he
has gone he has had an eager interest in whatever
was rare and picturesque in the locality and in the
lives of the people. Thus he has gathered material
for no end of good stories â stories that in their sub-
stance are always true and often are true to the
very letter a* well. And th<-~? stories he tells, as
cur readers already have proof, with no ordinary art.
MeLane, Electa; Isabella Mehrtens, war

The music was rendered by the Knick

officers duly installed there were nd

LIFE IN THE DEEPEST MINES.
The deepest mines in the world are the tin mines of Corn-

JUSTICE CRUELLY MOCKED.
ONCE more has Justice been made a mockery in
California and new disgrace added to a long
list. The courts have again been brought into
h. and twelve jurymen, sodden with tears ol

murderei â have placed themselves on record as unfit

duty.

her, in whom was her hope, ail the promise of her
future; the man on whonn she loaned, whose strong
arm wrought for her. and whose hand was laid upon
her in gentle caress; who took her to his bosom, his
joy in life to have her there, was legitimate prey lor

had been stirred by the vile liquor of the dives.

It is a privilege and a duty to remember these as
a precious dozen who should forever be barred from
the jury-box. They will carry to their graves the
knowledge that upon them rests a load of guilt.
There is nobody to be congratulated. It in such a
victory over right an attorney find glory, to such as
it is he is welcome. Barnes wept copiously, but
whether for joy or for shame is a matter of doubt. The
feelings of the aped father any and all must respect,
but regard for then* should not have led awry the
sense and decency of men supposed to be sane and
law-abiding.
Genuine sympathy will be with the young widow.
It is as though these twelve men had stood at Hilde
brands tomb with her and there gibed at the bitter
ness which has made for her all the world a place of
tribulation.
California must punish murder. Too long has it
protected the bloody-handed; too little has it been
' concerned for the rights of the victim, and those
stricken by his taking off.- The course of murder
trials has become a stench, a by-word, recognized as
a pretense and a travesty. When shall the shame be
at an end. * â . ,

NO SENfITORSHIP FOR SALE.
WHILE we do not admit that there is any cause
fur the fear, that is inspired by the method of
Mr. Grant's Senatorial candidacy, we concede
tli.it it justifies all the disgust which it causes. That
candidacy confessedly originated in the East It was
decided upon in a council of politicians who have the
reputation of growing no poorer in the public ser
vice, and whose health docs not require the use of
office as a sanitarium. Its first appearance in Califor
nia was Mr. Grant's request for the support Of the
Southern Pacific Railroad. Upon being refused, be
cause that corporation had other Senatorial suckers
to fry, he publicly admitted that he had applied, and
consoled himself for the denial of his application by
pointing with pride to the support of the Santa Fe
Railroad. These guileless admissions demonstrate
that Mr. Grant was of the opinion that California has
SO little voice in her own affairs that her seats in the
Senate are disposed of by one or both of two foreign
railroad corporations, upon request of some Eastern
politicians who can render an equivalent to the cor
porations in the shape of favorable railroad legisla
tion in Congress.
This is a naked analysis of Mr. Grant's method. It
consisted in an Eastern bargain, and the presentation
lof a grant, bargain and sale deed to the office, for
j which an equivalent had been promised.
There was no local nor personal nor party reason
! why Mr. Grant should be Senator. If the selection
had bren left to the voluntary action of the people,
who is bold enough to say that Mr. Grant would
ever have been thought of? He was not in the Sen
atorial class. No act of party loyalty or State ser
vice had put his name on the eligible list. The first
trace of his attempt to influence politics is found in a
feeble infidelity to Republican principles and disloy
alty to the national ticket in 1896.
In the hot fight of that year, while the right of the
party to live at all was on trial, and while it identified
itself with certain great principles of finance so as to
ca\\ to its side allies out of the Democratic ranks,
j where was Mr. Grant? When his brother was pro
! claiming from the lnuwtops, and boasting from po
: litical Gath to Askelou. that if their father were living
i he would be a supporter of Bryan, did this aspirant
,to a Republican scat in the Senate deny it? Did he
I vindicate the great name that was being degraded by
I that uurilial zeal? Did he declare that General Grant
\\.i> a sincere believer in the sound money and re
sumption measures which were the glory of his terms
111 the Presidency? Did he declare a son's faith that
General Grant w..s not a pretender and a hypocrite
when lie said in his fourth annual message to Con
gress: "The preservation of our national credit is of
the highest importance; next in importance comes
the solemn duty to provide a national currency, of
fixea, unvarying value, as compared with gold, and
convertible into gold at par"? In his first message
General Grant had said: "I earnestly recommend to
you such legislation as will insure a gradual return to
specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctua
tions in the value of currency"; in his fifth message:
"We can never have permanent prosperity until a
specie basis is reached": in his sixth message: "It
â¢.- easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative
< lasses may think it of value to them to make so
called money abundant until they can throw a por
tion of their burdens upon others": in his seventh
message: 'That additional power be given the Sec
retary oi the Treasury to accumulate gold for final
redemption." When his good faith in these sound
money texts and the arguments by which he en
forced them was impeached by the declaration that he
would support Bryan if alive, the Republican party j
â vindicated his memory by sustaining the principles !
for which he stood. It did that duty unaided by the
sympathy of the man who now conjures in his name
for the party's greatest honor in California.
Heredity and family, and the support of an Eastern
junta and the. opposition of one and support of an
other foreign railroad corporation, make up the
pleadings of Mr. Grant, upon which he asks judgment
in his favor. Heredity is repugnant to republican in
stitutions. No American has any right to great
things because his father did great things. Ancc
gives no claim upon those rewards which each genera
tion bestows upon its own exalted characters. In
England there has been presented repeatedly the
spectacle of a blackguard bearing the hereditary
honors of the house of Mariborough because its
founder. John Churchill, glorified the arms of his
country at Blenheim and Malplaquet. The same is
tine of the noble houses founded by great men in the
high and mighty times from the crusades to the ac
cession of the Brunsvvickcrs. Oitcner than other
wise their descendants have discredited the names
they bear.
We do not say of Mr. Grant that he tarnishes the
name of his family, but that he does not and will not
add to its luster. What this living generation de
mands is that the recipients of its honors must come
in their own right and title, with their escutcheon em
blazoned with tiieir own deeds, and not quartered with
the acts of their forebears.
The Senate i< not a kindergarten in which to train
statesmen in the rudiments of their craft. It is not
a museum in which to put on exhibition the de
scendants of past greatness. It is not a directory in
which to print historical names. It is not a body to
which a small junta in one section of the country and
a foreign corporation in another delegate their rep
resentatives. It is the greatest parliamentary body on
the planet, and seats in it are not inherited, nor arc
they to be bought.
The people of California have too much State
pride and personal self-respect to submit the common
wealth to the base uses oi strangers.
ThjE PRESIDENT'S TOURS.
ONE of the attractive features of the personality
of President McKinley is his comprehensive
sympathy with all the aims of his countrymen
and his willingness to actively participate as far as
possible in all enterprises of a public character. Not
withstanding the burdens and duties of his office.
made more oppressive and difficult by the war, he has
found time to attend various 5 expositions and cele
brations in different parts of the country, and at this
time is making â  tour through the South, which is to
include visits not only to the jubilee at Atlanta, but
to the industrial institute at Tuskegee, Alabama.
When this tour shall be completed the President
within the last three months will have made visits as
far West as Omaha, as far North as Chicago, and as
far South as Savannah. None of these tours have
been made in a hurried and perfunctory manner. â¢ The
President has not seemed bored, as if he were going
through a ceremony tedious and tiresome. On the
contrary, he has shown a hearty enjoyment of his op
portunities to meet the people, and has made friends
at even stopping-place.
Out of this willingness on the part of the President
to visit the various portions of the Union instead of
going rishing. the people of California and the West
generally ought to profit. We have no exposition or
jubilee to which to invite him during the coming
summer, more's the pity, but then in a certain sense
California is always an exposition in itself. It is al
THE SAN riiANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1898.
ways worth while for any Eastern man to visit it, and
there are particular reasons why the President should
do so.
We invited Mr. McKinley to visit us last summer,
but he was unable to do so. Perhaps if another in
vitation is given early, before his programme for the
coming summer is arranged, he may visit the State in
the coming year. It would certainly be worth while
for our delegation in Congress to present the request
to him this winter. The President has now seen the
Eastern section of the country, from the Atlantic to
the Missouri, from the lakes to the gulf States, and
it is but right the Pacific Coast should have the
honor of entertaining him next summer.
ThjE DANGERS OF EXPANSION.
THE devotees of the doctrine of territorial ex
pansion, now that the excitement of war is
passed, have been met by the cold reason of a
class of men headed by Senator Hoar, who believe
that in the doctrine of territorial expansion, so freely
advocated, lurks a danger to these United States of
America, in that no principle upon which this Gov
ernment is founded, no power granted to Congress
nor any line existing in the constitution, can be
found to authorize the maintenance of a condition
which the expansionist claims will soon exist in the
Philippine Islands.
The cardinal principles of human liberty enunciated
ir the Declaration of Independence should be care
fully read by that class of our citizens who believe we
have a right to maintain by the strong arm and the
bayonet a colonial authority over foreign races of
human beings without their consent and against their
protest. The right of representation in the Legisla
ture which frames the laws was recognized as one of
the grounds for the severance of this country from
England, and is spoken of as "a right inestimable to
them (meaning the United States) and formidable to
tyrants only." Another ground was that the King
of England had kept among us standing armies,
without the consent of our Legislatures, and, again,
"for imposing taxes without the consent of the gov
erned."
It was in the same relation to her colonies as that
which the expansionists claim the United States shall
occupy toward the Philippines that the War of Inde
pendence originated and ended in the final separation
of this country from Great Britain.
But, say the expansionists, we do not propose to
treat the Philippine Islands as a colony; we do not
propose to give them a colonial government, and it
is denounced as a false issue of imperialism, and it
is contended that the application of our navigation
laws to Porto Rico, and the treatment of Hawaii,
means that the government shall be territorial, and
that these countries may grow from territories to full
Statehood under the laws and constitution of the
United States.
Passing the question of the questionable policy and
danger of a State existing in the Oriental' tropics,
10.500 miles away from the Capitol at Washington,
we are confronted by the reiterated statement of the
administration that the "open door policy" shall pre
vail at the Philippines, and that all nations shall be
entitled to the benefit of the business of the islands.
How can that policy be maintained In the face of the
constitutional requirement that all duties, imposts
and excises shall be uniform throughout the United
States? If territorial government is proposed, if
statehood is the end to be attained, whj is the "open
door policy" mentioned?
The truth is that in this question of our newly ac
quired territory is involved one of the gravest and
deepest questions that has agitated this country since
the days of reconstruction, a question which must be
solved calmly and deliberately, not only for the pub
lic good, but with regard to that great hypothesis
which a philosophical writer has stated, that all na
tions have their birth, life and death, and that in the
adopting into the body politic of elements so dis
cordant and degenerate we may be planting the seed
of our future destruction as a nation.

Bennett and Dr. Woolsey removed this damaging evi
dence. Why?
There is no disposition now to make charges that
the theft was done with foul intent of defeating jus
tice, and yet that it was made for honorable purposes
the public will he slow to believe. A lawyer who would
resort to so ghoulish a method must not be surprised
to note signs of disapproval. There is no doubt that
the membranes could be so manipulated as to destroy
their character as revealed by the autopsy, render
them valueless to the prosecution and mutely dispute
the assertions of the experts. Nobody can say that
this will be done, or an attempt made to do it, but the
ground for withholding faith in an attorney who
would resort to such a plan as purloining the skull of
murder's supposed victim does not inspire faith in the
purity of his motives.

BURNS' RECORD AS
A BONANZA KING
Shadow of a Mexican Prison
Cell Hangs Over Him. ;
.â. â i
Was Tried and Convicted of Appropriating
the Property of Another.
Colonel Daniel M. Burns is an ex
office holder of the State of California,
present candidate for United States
Senator and reputed owner of the fam
ous bonanza known as the Candelaria
mines in Mexico.
A majority of the people of this State
are aware of the manner in which
Burns discharged his duties as an of
fice holder; all are aware of his present
Senatorial aspirations; but only a few
have a knowledge of the facts concern
ing the manner in which he obtained
control of the mines in the State of
Durango, Mexico, and which are esti
mated to be worth anywhere from $20.
000,000 to $50,000,000.- Here and there
may be found a man who has an in
distinct remembrance of hearine that
Burns occupied a cell In a Mexican iail
at some time in the past, and that his
imprisonment had something to do with
his connection with the Candelaria
mines.
Neither these men nor any one of the
120 legislators who will be asked to
cast their votes for Burns within the
next month know that the shadow of
a Mexican prison cell still hangs over
this Senatorial candidate, and that only
the doubtful termination of a civil suit
stands between him and the re-enact
ment of criminal proceedings that once
before branded him a felon.
There are on file In the office of the
Secretary of State at Washington. D.
C, documents that tell the official story
of Burns' connection with the Can
delaria mines, his arrest and imprison
ment for the fraudulent appropriation
of another's property, and the proceed
ings by which one court after another
reaffirmed the justice of his conviction
and confirmed the sentence of Impris
onment. Such portions of these docu
ments as have to do with Burns' im
mediate participation in this alleged
fraud by which the title to this vast
mining property passed to him. as well
as the history of his arrest and impris
onment, will be quoted here in full.
A perusal of the following rocord will
give the reader an insight into the na
ture of the fraud charged against
Burns. It should be understood that
at the time the events referred to oc
curred Burns vis employed by the
owners of the mines in the capacity of
superintendent. From the record:
In ISOO I learned thnt Daniel. M.
Burns hnd sank a prospecting shaft
300 feet deep from the 1000-foot
level (which wan then the bottom
level of the old workings of the
Candelaria Mines). The shaft was
sunk Immediately Tinder the divis
ion of the main Cnndelaria Mine and
its addition, the Chenery Mine.
Drifts were run from the shaft,
every fifty feet deep, each -way on
the vein. The ore taken from the
shaft and drifts vims so rich that 900
ponnds of quicksilver wan used to
each charge of 2<>OO pounds of ore
to take up the precious metal. This
"ore wan so rich that It could not
he worked at the mill to advantage,
so a portion was sacked and sent to
Maaatlan. Mexico, and from there
shipped in hnlk to Europe, instead
of to California, as was usual.
>'o ore was taken from the stopes,
bat the hoisting; works and stamps
â¢were taken ont of the shaft, and it
was filled np with waste rock, and
information given ont that the ex
ploration for ore -was a failure, and
that the rich upper ore bodies were
nt. ..nt worked out, and the upper
'works wonld be abandoned when a
new tunnel was run to reach the
mine at a loner level. Then Horn*,
in securing the approval of the
Loral Federal Mining Ascent to n
plan for a now tunnel, which wan
stated, to run ilinmuU tue Cande
laria Mines, conspired with the Fed
eral Local Agent to give him (Burns)
a r<cw title and possession of the
mine. Subsequently, when the fraud
ulent proceeding!* were brought to
the knowled.ee of the hiuh federal
administrative authorities of Mex->
ico. they declared the act of their
agrnt irrrtnlnr and illegal.
Burns had. at the time, for under
ground foremnn and assistant, two
American miners. They were in
structed to keep the extent of the
rich find secret, and he Brave it out
that the rich ore taken from the
shaft and drifts came from pockets;
but a detective, in IStK), learned
from the assayer at the mill and
from the assistant underground
foreman and other miners the real
fnetv in regard to the richness and
extent of the ore find, the estimated
value of was so enormous
that I refrained from making: It j
pnbllc. feariOK it might not be trne.
At this taac time Burns was de
preciating; the mine .and giving oat
that the old mine bad been worked
out. The facts, as learned by the
detectives, â were given in a casual
â way, nnd neither the foreman nor
his assistant supposed they were be
traying any confidence.
In 1803 the underground foreman
became ill. He then left the mine
and returned to the I nited States.
Karly in 1594 a detective was en-
BiiKffl to fret whatever information
he conld from this foreman. The
latter was at first secretive, but
eventually disclosed the fact that
he. when climbing up through the
old works, had discovered the chim
ney, where the millions had been
taken ont by the former owners.
and that, at his suggestion, the :uhi
foot shaft was located and snnk. and
the drifts rnn. disclosing over five
million of valne In sight. Then the
development was abandoned and
the shaft filled In -with waste rork.
and the new tunnel planned to cnt
this same chute of ore 1400 feet be
low. One aide of this vein, cnt by
the .drifts, tSree feet wide, ran over
ten dollars a pound, or ?20.000 pep
tun i while the other portion, six
feet wide, carried rich ore.
At the time Burns declared the mines
abandoned they were producing from
$75,000 to $100,000 monthly under his
superintendency. Then came the un
covering of the great mass of rich ore.
From the record:
It was then that the lessees* of the
Candelaria became ambitious to
hold the complete title aiid owner
ship in the bonanza which they
were working 1 , and being: unable to
buy it up, in their desire to obtain a
title, pretended the mine aban
doned. They intended then to take
complete ownership of the property,
which it was decided should be done
in the name of D. M. Burns, their
Superintendent.
To this end the mine for a dis
tance of 0000 feet along: the vein
was "denounced." or declared to be
â without an owner, by this Superin
tendent, lint It is a peculiar Inci
dence that the record of the au
thorities of Dnrango niton's that the
Candelaria in January of that same
year had produced 575.000, that in
February, the month of the de-
nouncement, the output was s:>u.Â«hki.
Notwithstanding; these little lrreÃD
laritlen, however, the mine was
placed in the hands of Mr. Burns by
the local mining- a sent in June of
inks, under a pretended title of
abandonment.
As soon as the owners of the mine be
came aware of what had been done the
facts were laid before the Mexican Fed
eral authorities, and an investigation
was ordered by them. As a result of
this investigation the Federal Mining
Agent who had assisted Burns in mak
ing the "denouncement" was dismissed
in disgrace. He was later arrested and
tried on a criminal charge, but escaped
conviction because the State court be
fore which the trial was had lacked
jurisdiction to try a Federal official for
a fraudulent act connected with the ad
ministration of the Federal laws.
Burns Mas also arrested and haled
into court on a charge of fraud. His
conviction and a sentence of imprison
ment speedily followed. From the
record :
In i'.xliiiiit Book \o. 2, pasres :* and

Conrt of the City of Mexico advised
the Conrt npon the termination of
the Trlnl to Condemn I>. M. Barns,
and Instructed the Court to Convict
the Criminal to Imprisonment.
When D. M. Burn* was arrested in
the City â¬>f Mexico, he appealed to

State, through his political friends,
the Hon. C. K. Felton and ex-Gover

Charges it to be trne. that the Amer

the Mexican Minister of Foreign
Relations at Mexico, in behalf of the
said Prisoner, D. M. Bnrns. and that
the Mexican Administration there
; upon appointed a Special Represen
tative of the Minister of Justice to
j see that the Prisoner should have n
j fair and proper Trial: Rut although
1 after a fair trial, the Defendant was
convicted and Sentenced by the 1

securing: an Order from the .lv.i . !

On his securing Bail, the Prisoner

His conviction and sentence of im
prisonment having: been approved by
the highest court in the land. Burns
launched a forlorn hope in the shape
of an "Amparo" appeal â that is. an ap
peal to the court for relief from the
sentence. From the record:
The Court by a bare majority (rave
I). M. Burns liberty on the technical
point thsit he held a Federal title
(obtained through his act of declar
ing: the mines deserted) to the Can
delaria mines, and -whether It wn â Â«
Kood or bad, the Supreme Court In
the Ampnro appeal, had no right to
investigate, and that the prisoner
could not be held for crime until
civil proceedings were had in the
proper court, and the Federal Act
and the title given him under it had
been declared illegal.
The civil suit has been instituted and
is now pending in the, Mexican courts.
What the result will be should it be
decided against Burns is apparent.

PASSED CLAIMS,
BUT THEY MADE
NO TEACHERS
Riotous Meeting of
School Directors.
STOPPED BY INJUNCTIONS
BAN THROUGH BANTEL'S LONG
LIST OF BILLS.
Billingsgate Marked the Speeches
and Disgraceful Filibustering
the Tactics Em
ployed.
The two latest crooked schemes con
ceived by the ready wit of the Board of
Education have died a-bornin'. At the
meeting last night the ready hand of the
law. with Judge Belcher iseulnd it, man
ifested itself in the form of an injunction
served upon each Director in the bunch,
restraining them from consummating the
two jobs that yesterday morning's Call an
nounced that they would attempt at last
evening's meeting. The thirty new teach
ers with whii h it was intended to swell
the depleted substitute list did not trans
pire, and with the fear of a Christmas
spent in the durance that would neces
sarily result from open contempt of the
court's order, the board refrained from
abolishing the busin< ss evening school
that it might sidetrack Professor E. C.
Kilpatrick.
The injunction that did such good work
was sworn to by Mervin Mark Lane, and
there was no limit placed upon the term
of its operation. Its intent is to prevent
for the balance of the term of the pres
ent board every crooked scheme that is in
prospect, and the list is one of no mean j
proportions.
Judge Belcher's injunction did not issue i
until late in the afternoon. It was de- I
sired that the board know nothing of It j
until it had gathered at the meeting- :
room, but despite every precaution the
word was passed and every Director was
ready for the service when it came.
No attempt, however, was made to fore
stall it. It was roundly sneered at. and
each brave Director boasted that he would
ignore it if he shw tit. The only remark
able fact was that none of them saw fit, j
and the meeting, as a meeting, resolved |
itself into one of the most disgraceful i
of the many broils that have been fought
to a finish since the board first met.
Robbed by tne injunction of the power j
to pubh through their last grist of crook- j
edness. they one and all foil to fighting
among themselves, ami it was after mid- j
night before the game was finished. The
star performers were Hpad. Waller and
Gallagher, and on a half dozen occasions
it seemed that a general fist tight was im
minent.
The lie was passed without reserve or
consideration for the teachers who had I
gathered to see if Justice was ur be done I
them. The < nl.. - business consummatc-1
was the filing of a 7000-word opinion from
Assistant District Attorney Dunne upon
the resolution presented for his considera
tion by the merchants at last Wednes
day's meeting.
Mr. Dunne announced that in his opin
ion the board had the right to audit
claims presented to it and order their
payment without the signature of either
Superintendent Webster or President Bar
rington. In other words, Mr. Dunne's
opinion gives the board powers of prefi i
ence in the payment of claims that make it
possible to mulct the teachers for tue ben
efit of the merchants whenever the com
missions offered shall be commensurate
with the risk incurred.
It gives the board the arbitrary power |
to prefer any claim or any creditor, for |
robbed of the balancing power exercised
by the Superintendent, Auditor Broderick |
is compelled to pass for payment any ;
claim that comes to him so long as it j
shall come within the- provisions of the i
one-twelfth act.
Directors Head and Derham made a
vain attempt to force the payment of the
teachers* salaries, but by the filibustering !
measures of Waller and Gallagher they |
were prevented from making the neces
sary motion. There was a batch of sup
ply bills that were to be ordered paid
under the new ruling of Mr. Dunne, and
the pedagogues were effectually shut out.
In all, claims aggregating 163.953. all of
them for supplies, were passed to the Au
ditor, and among them were the claims
that Director Bantoh has been so long j
and so chary about bringing in.
The row of the evening started when
Head charged that all of the alleged mis
takes, out of which has resulted the
deficit that haunts the board, were "crim
inal, malicious and knowinglyflKvrong."
Waller jumped to his feet with" an objec
tion to such language and Gallagher fol
lowed, and they kept it up until called
down by the president. Head got the
floor again but was once more interrupt
ed, and final!? Gallagher called for the I
reading of the minutes of every meeting
since July 1, "just to prove that Head
Is a deliberate liar and that he voted for
every resolution that cost money that has
come up."
<;allagher added that Head was playing
to the gallery full of teachers and Waller
backed him up In a speech three-quar
ters of an hour long and twice as wide.
Waller said he would take it out of Head's
hide if he could not get satisfaction any I
other way. and then accused him of de- |
manding compensation for every vote he I
made. He stated flatly that he had to buy
Head's vote on the elementary committee
report passed at last meeting by giving
him one of the appointments on the list
Head did not deny it and Waller finished
with a chunk or so of supposedly good
advice to the teachers on how not to col
lect a salary.
Head made an attempt to get a reso
lution before the board providing for the
payment of the November salaries, but
he was again frozen out and after the i
passage of a block of claims without more '
consideration than the necessary motion
the meeting was adajourned.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. DECEMBER 17, 1898.
WILL SUCCEED THE LATE
JUDGE RHODES BORDEN
YESTERDAY Governor Budd appointed William P. Lawlor Judge of
the Superior Court of San Francisco to fill the vacancy caused by
the death of the late Judge Rhodes Borden. The appointment meets
with general approval, not only because of the high personal esteem
in which Judge Lawlor is held by his many friends, but because of
his recognized fitness to perform in a meritorious manner the duties of a
Superior Court Judge.
William P. Lawlor was born in New York city about forty years ago.
He came to California in 1577 and assumed the superintendency of a num
ber of valuable quicksilver mines in Napa county. Later he came to San
Francisco and entered upon the study of law in the office of Rhodes &
Barstow, at the same time taking the lectures at the Hastings College of
Law. After his admission to practice by the Supreme Court he was asso
ciated with the late Dennis Spencer at 508 California street, where Judge
Lawlor has since been engaged in the practice of his profession.
He has been intimately associated with Democratic politics since 1892,
and in IWM .he was appointed a member of Governor Budd's advisory com
mittee and' personally conducted the campaign in this city. He organized
the campaign for free silver in this city in 189fi and at the beginning of the

charming manners. He does not speak

Indictments Against McGlade.
Two indictments, containing four
counts, have been found by the Grand
Jury against Peter McGl&de, late of the
Street Department. They were filed with
presiding Judge Belcher yesterday after
noon. In the first indictment McGlade
is charged with having forged the name
of B. M*cGinnis; the second count is that
he uttered a forged document against the
City and County of San Francisco. The
second indictment, as a first count,
charges the prisoner with having forged
the name of H. Swords; the second count,
as in the first indictment, charges the ut
tering of a forged document against the
city and county. Judge Belcher fixed the
ball at $10,000 for each indictment or $5000
on each count, stating that he purposely
fixed the bail high as the accused was a
public official and the nature of his crime
called for but little consideration on the
part of the court.

Do You Want Strength ?
To men who feel that their vital power is wastingâ who are not as
strong as they wish to beâ Electricity acts as a great aid. When it is
poured into the nervous system for hours at a time every night, it ex-
pands ail the vital forces of the body. This develops new tissues,
muscle and power. It makes a man feel like a giant.
" THREE CLASSES OF MEN," is a little book which I have
written for weak, puny men. It is for men who want to be strong. It
explains why most men have lost their power and how my Electric Belt
restores it. Call or write for itâ FREE.

THE POLICE INTERFERED.
The Opening Bout Before the Prince-
ton Athletic Club Was Brought
to a Sudden Conclusion.
The Princeton Athletic Club gave its
first boxing entertainment last evening
at 1322 Howard street. The first event,
which was to have been a six-round con
test between Henry Lewis and Frank
Ely, was stopped in the third round by
Sergeant Donahue, who, seeing that Ely,
who was as fat as a prize hog. was apt
to be killed at any moment, wisely
stepped into the ring and ordered the
boxers to their dressing rooms.
The managers of the club were cau
tioned that if they permitted untrained
boxers to enter the ring again they would
be debarred from giving future exhibi
tions.
"Kid" Everett got a decision over Budd
Terry in a six-round contest, and Eugene
Mulligan and Joe Sullivan boxed eight
rounds. The mill was declared a draw
by Referee Joe Reay.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â The trading to-day
resulted in only trifling changes in prominent
Mocks. The speculative public of England was
active on both sides of the market, with pur
chases of the balance slightly In excess of
pales. Trading: locally was less active than
of late, but a very strong undertone was In
evidence. The traders seemed largely on the
shorts' stde, while there was buying by com
mission houses and pool support. Speculation
â¢during the forenoon was very irregular, but
variations generally were not significant, ex
cept in a few cases. The market became dull
with the cancellation of orders in commission
houses. In the afternoon a number of hitherto
neglected stocks were taken up and advanced
sharply. The revamping of the old story of
Chicago and Alton passing into new hands was
to-day connected with Union Pacific instead
of Missouri Pacific or Michigan Central, as
the former rumors had it. To this tale, per
haps, was due a rise in Union Pacific. In the
last hours the bears by concerted action
reached stop-loss orders a-Â«l carried prices oft
from 1 to 2 points generally. By delivery hour
the movement petered nut and in a period of
dullness prices picked up a-, around. News
paper articles treating the sugar trade war as
farcical resulted in a sharp rise in that stock
at the opening, which was soon lost, the clos
ing being at last night's figures. Rubber con
tinued its weakness of yesterday, losing 2
points. The Grangers were very strong most
of the day, but reacted with the rest of the
list on the bear rise.
In the bond market to-day the general tone
was very unsettled, with the semi-speculative
issues trending lower. Total sales, $8,355,000.
United States new fours and the fives cou
pon advanced V*. and the threes and the old
fours and fives registered Vg in the bid price.

FINANCIAL, REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: An enormous ag
gregate of transaction in both bonds and
stocks, with an unusually wide range In the
variety of securities traded In, have been ac
companied this week by advances which car
ried prices for a majority of the Stock Ex
change lists to the highest level of the year.
While large speculative Interests have been
active and manipulation has not been lacking,
the most conspicuous developments were the
large influx of public purchasing and the
equally marked buying for European account,
accompanied by great activity and advances
in the American department of the London
market. In many respects the movement was
calculated to brine to mind the so-called
"boom" of 1579-80. the more so because in both
cases a series of exceptionally large credit bal
ances in the foreign trade of the United States,
accompanied by an expansion of general busi
ness and decidedly favorable results as regards
railroad earnings and dividends, furnish the
basil for speculative confidence. In the present
ra=e, however, the conditions, both in thes-?
respects and in regard to the accumulated cap
ital of the country, are deemed so superior to
those upon which previous demonstrations of
confidence were based that some of the most
prominent Individual interests In Wall street
are emphatic in declaring that prices will be
carried to a much higher level. Such views,
in fact, find general credence in financial cir
cles, but at the same time the market, after a
remarkable exhibition of its bullish temper in
the early part of the week, presented the symp
toms of a heavy realizing of profits by profes
sional interests, which to a considerable extent
checked the advance in parts of the list In
which the upward movement had been most
pronounced and diminished the volume of
trading to a considerable extent.

BRADSTREET 1 REVIEW.
NTTW YORK, Dec. 16.â Bradrtreef s to-mor- |
row will say: Likening the general business j
of the country to that of a watercourse It j
may be authoritatively stated that nearly all
the channels of seasonable trade are at i
the present running full and in some lines of I
business the stream in virtually overflowing. !
Thle is particularly the case in iron and steel, ]
where production and consumptive demand are
alike going on at an unprecedented rate, at a
time, too, when It Is usual to look for quietness J
In this industry. Nothing like the present ac
tivity in this branch of trade has been seen
for years past, if indeed it has ever been
equaled. Advices from all the leading center* |
of iron production are of an exceptionally good i
demand for the crude and manufactured prod- j
ucts and of advancing prices, the unly anxiety |
expressed being that by buyers desiring early i
delivery- Probably never before In the couti- i
try's history has It been possible for an Amer
ican steel company to refuse a profitable order
for rails for foreign account on the plea that
ite mills were already fully occupied so far I
ahead as to preclude Its trying for the busi
ness. Higher prices for plgiron, steel billets, i
soft steel and all sorts of car material are I
reported, while the production of raw material ;
is at its maximum. Shipbuilding, too, con
tributes Its, portion of activity to the Iron trade '
by its urgent calls for material. In other lines .
of business the situation as regards prices is a !
favorable one. notable among the advances re
ported being nearly all the cereals, cotton,
coffee, lumber, copper, lead and a variety of
other less prominent staples. Following the

slight recession shown in wheat values of last
week an improved demand for export has again
developed, which is evidence of the fact that
stories of keen competition from Argentina
and Russian have been more or less discounted,
the United States remaining, as for some time
past, the principal source of supply of the
world. Increased interest Is being taken In
cotton at the advanced price. Seasonable quiet
ness Is reported In the lumber trade, but prices
retain all their old strength and an active de
mand is looked for with the turn of the year.
Holiday trade is reported extremely active at
I most markets. The country's export trade is
of the largest volume ever known, that for
November surpassing the total for December
a year ago. with the indications favoring a
total trade for the calendar year at least one
sixth larger than a year ago and our sales
abroad aggregating two dollars for every dol
lars worth we buy.
Wheat (including flour) shipments for the
week aggregate 8,067,625 bushels. Portland. Me.,

DUN'S RKVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Deo. 16.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will Bay:
December Is adding a surprising close to the
most, surprising year of American history. No
vember surpassed all other months of the cen
tury In volume of business and production, and
thus far December is doing even better In pay
ments through clearing houses, In railroad
earnings, In foreign trade, in output of plglron,
In activity and strength of securities.
But that Is saying a great deal, for In all
these and other tests November was far the
best month In American financial history. De
cember began with a pigiron output of 235,
tons weekly, against 225.935 November 1. and
with stocks of unsold iron diminished 18,988
tons In November, which Indicates a consump
tion of 1.024,313 tons during the month. Not
only Is the output the greatest ever known, but
It has increased 22 1 per cent since 1892. which
developed the greatest monthly record then
ever knownâ Bessemer pig was then selling for
$14 75 at Pittsburgh, but until the middle of
November sold at $10 10 this year. It has since
risen with enormous demand and sales to $10 no
there, with gray forge $9 35, but the Chicago
market Is also strong with sales of 100,000 tons,
besides 25,000 tons of billets, which had risen
at Plttsburg with big transactions to $16. With
scarcity of plglron feared, both East and West,
there is as yet no rise whatever In finished
product, although the demand Is far beyond all
production. Steel rails are quoted at $17 per
ton at the East, although the Lackawanna
Company has taken orders for 100.000 tons at
the West, both the Plttsburg and Chicago
works being sold far ahead, and bids for 32.000
tons for Australia are to be opened to-day,
while Chicago has pending a bid for 200.
tons deliverable in two years in Asiatic Russia.
In other lines the demand for finished products
is of surprising magnitude, especially in plates
and In sheets." ".!-->.
The woolen industry also comes to the front
with very extensive purchases of woo! by large
houses and small, helped by material con
cessions nt Boston, so that sales at the three
chief markets have been 17,!>65,700 pounds, of
which 13.860,200 were domestic, against 15.307,
100 pounds last year, of which 7.443,000 were do
mestic, and 16.504,100 in the same weeks of
1892, of which 12.399.60 i) were domestic.
The transactions show a demand fairly up to
that of the most prosperous years heretofore.
Philadelphia has good business, but seems in
clined to ask 2 cents more than Boston prices
for fine fleece. Ohio XX being offered at Boston
for 26% cents. A much Improved demand for
goods has started many mills long Idle, and
the prospect for the next season, with wool
at more reasonable prices, has decidedly im
proved.
The exports of wheat continued heavy, from
Atlantic ports, flour included, 5,492,692 bushels,
against 2,588,805 bushels last year, and from
Pacific ports 741,991 bushels, against 1.520,612
bushels last year, so that for two weeks the
outgo has been 11,871,640 bushels, against 9,401.
'.:. last year. As the wheat output In December
of last year was close to the largest on record,
the returns this year show a really surprising
gain. While prices have been 3 cents stronger
for cash, the Western receipts for two weeks
of December have been about 6,000,000 bushels
greater than last year. â  â¢.
The corn movement is the most astonishing
feature of the business, the exports for three
weeks have been 7,187.302 bushels, against
6,326,894 bushels last year, and the price has
advanced 1 cent for the week. Should such a
demand for American corn continue it would
be of enormous value to Western farmers.
Failures for the week have been 261 in the
United States, against 329 last year, and 31 In
Canada, against 28 last year.

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET.
CHICAGO. Dec. 16.â Wheat opened very
lively and buoyant. Buyers and sellers were
both very numerous, but the confidence of the
buyers was the more evident. Prices started
HiH.'ic o\-er yesterday's closing:, with May at
67% c. One or two sales were made at C7c,
and then, under lar^e purcnoses. May ad
vanced to 67% c. All the English markets
showed sharp advances, Liverpool being up
%(qIA, and London Id. Hail was reported to
have badly damaged the Argentine crop in
Fome sections. On the other hand Northwest
advices were rather bearish. The Northwest
sold quite heavily In this market all day and
sent predictions of continued large receipts.
California reported continued rains of inestim
able value to the crop. Buying halted to some
extent after May had reached 67% c. and realiz
ing became quite heavy, prices reacting for a
short time to 674 c. But before 11 o'clock, the
market was booming again, and this time the
demand did not let up until near the close.
Late cables showed still further advances In
foreign markets. The great strength of the
Liverpool market was the big factor. Trade
broadened out materially as the session ad
vanced, and this in itself alarmed the shorts
end caused heavy buying by that class of
traders. Before 12:30 o'clock, the price of May
hnd risen to 6S%c. Previous to that time realiz
ing had again set in. Longs with wheat show
ing good profits took advantage of the strength
of the market. This selling finally became too
heavy for prices to stand up under, nml In
the last half hour quotations broke sharply.
May finally sold down to C7%c, closing fairly
steady at that figure.
Corn was strong early, with much buying
by outside shorts and local longs. The boom
in wheat was the principal influence. "U'hfn
wheat broke late in the day, corn became
weak, longs being heavy sellers, and n<-w short
lines were also put out. The market closed
rather nervous, with about all the advance
lost.
Oats were rather dull, relatively, and price
changes narrow. May closed unchanged.
Provisions were moderately active. Pack
ers were free sellers all day and there was
another large run on hogs. As a result, the
market. In spite of the strengtn of grain, was
j rather weak. There was good deal of pro
! fit-taking by longs on all the hard spots. At
the close May pork was 24c lower; lard, 2UÂ®
I 5c lower; ribs. 24c lower.

EASTERN ORANGE MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Deo. 18.â The Journal of Com
merce pays: The situation In oranges is some
what unsettled. Recent liberal arrivals of
Jamaica?, offering at comparatively low prices,
have filled up most of the largo buyers and
the movement at present is moderate In view
of the fact that a considerable part of the
receipts of Jnmnlcas of late have shown poor
quality the market for repacked fruit at pres
ent Is firm on all sound shipping stock, but
buyers are making purchases sparingly, In
view of the prospect of lower nrices next week
on the arrival of considerable quantities now
afloat or loading.
Arrivals of Sicily fruit so far have been
small, but are about the same as a year ago.
Hardly enough luis come forward as yet to
have had an Appreciable influence on the or
ange market. Florida oranges have been com
ing forward quite freely of late, but have
found a fairly ready outlet Into consumption at
satisfactory prices. Advices Just received from
Florida indicate that the crop will be much
smaller than was expected. thÂ» dry weather
and high winds prevailing of [ate, particularly
In the southern growing districts of the penin
sula, having caused a heavy drop. Buyers
here, however, take at present only what Is
needed for Immediate use, and In view of the
competition of other varieties holders find it
difficult to get better prices than tho?e hereto
fore prevailing. The movement In California
oranges has so far been very satisfactory, and
though there lin.Â«i been a good deal of com
plaint of immature fruit the prices obtained
have been about up to the average for a cor
responding period of a year ago. Shipments
to date from the coast have been only about
one-half of those for the same period last
year, and notwithstanding the objections made
that the fruit has been light colored and lack-
Ing in sweetness most receivers claim that the
average quality of the stock received here has
been better than that sent forward to a cor
rsponding time In 1597.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been four deliveries of coal from
Oregon, with 1615 tons; three from Washing
ton. 10.500 tons; three from British Columbia, j
9493 tons: two from Swansea. 4041 tons; total, I
25.649 tons. This is a very light week's receipt '
of coal at this season, as the quantity con- ;
sumed will greatly exceed this amount, and !
the late storms â¢ will materially Increase the I
'usual amount burnt. The result will be the
engagement of all vessels suitable for the !
transportation of fuel from all our Coast mines. I
For the present sailers are not plentiful, as '
they . are nearly all off the Coast on foreign I
business. Still there should be sufficient steam i
tonnage to meet our Immediate wants. Since j
my last we have had a most propitious rain
fall, lacking somewhat in quantity, yet cover- !
ing a large area of country where most needed, |
and the prospects are most encouraging for a !
repetition very shortly. Three inches more of !
rain within the next twenty days will be fol- j
lowed by ship owners offering to carry coal :
from Australia and Europe at a decline from
present asking figures. If we can only demon
strate to â¢ them that their property will find
profitable employment after arrival here, they :
will gladly come. / It Is many years since that
so small an amount of foreign coal will be de- |
livered here in December, as it is more than I
probable that not over five foreign cargoes |
will arrive here before New Years."

RESULT of GOULD'S
VISIT TO
TRUCKEE RIVER.
In August last Fish Commissioner C. B.
Gould made a personal inspection of the
Tru< river, extending from Lake Ta
hoa to Pyramid Lake in Nevada. The
trip occupied two weeks. Photographs
were made of all the dams and artificial
obstructions in the river In both States.
The dams in California were found to be
in condition for the free passage of fish,
save one or two near the State line. The
obstructions I:: the river In Nevada aro
numerous, but Mr. Gould visited Carson
City and consulted with Governor Sadler
and other State officials as well, also
with well-known sportsmen there and in
Keno regarding necessary legislation for
the better protection of the fish in the
Truckee river in Nevada, and satisfactory
plans wore made that seemingly insure
favorable action, the only hitch being the
!.r*ush dam located in the river live miles
above its mouth on the Pyramid Lake In
dian reservation. This dam is the worst
obstruction in the river, is built of brush
beld in place with rock. No fish can pass
ever it at any stage of the water, and be
ing located near the mouth 'of the river
it is of vital importance. The dam is not
only an obstruction, but it is also a trap.
The Indians congregate at this dam every
spring and spear thousands of trout that
have run into the river from the lake to
spawn. They sell tons of these fish every
year.
The dam is used to divert water to the
irrigating system of the reservation and
was constructed and Is controlled by the
Interior Department.
Upon Mr. Gould's return the subject was
presented to the Interior Department at
v\ as hi on and the correspondence
which ensued was terminated on Wednes
day last when the following letter was
received at the office of the Fish Commis
sion from the Secretary of the Interior:
Department of the Interior,
WASHINGTON, DÂ«c. 7. IS!*.
Hon. A. T. Vccelsang, President Board of
Fith Commissioners. State of California, San
Francisco, Cal.â Sir: I have the honor to ac
knowledge the receipt of your letter of the
2Sth ultimo, erring further to the dam in
the Truckre River on the Pyramid Lake In
dian reservation, Nevada.
In my letter of the sth ultimo, it was stated
that the recommendations of Inspector Graves,
who had recently investigated the subject of
irrigation on that reservation, were then un
<!er consideration and would doubtless be
adopted, in which case the dam referred to
would be abandoned.
Since that letter was written, the recom
mendations of the Inspector have been ap
proved, and the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs directed to Immediately carry them into
effect.
Your latest letter <Â« to-day referred to the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs and directions
given him not to permit the work to be
neglected or delayed, and to cause the dam
to be removed at the earliest practicable date,
and that if this cannot be done before the
next spawning season, that he cause to be

GOLF AT THE PRESIDIO.
Oakland Team Will Try Conclusions
on the Links of the San Fran
cisco Club To-Day.
Last Saturday afternoon the first team
match between representatives of the San
Francisco and Oakland golf clubs was
begun at the Oakland links. This after
noon the. Oakland players will be the
guests of the San Francisco club, and the
second half of the game will be played
on the Presidio links. The results of both
days' play will be added together, and the
team with the highest aggregate score
will be declared the winner of the first
home-and-home match ever played in
the neighborhood of San Francisco, and
probably the first ever played in. Cali
fornia. The teams consist of eight men
from each club, the Oakland representa
tives being- G. D. Greenwood, F. S. Strat
ton, W. P. Johnson, A. Folger, J. McKee,
C. P. Hubbard, E. R. Folger and C. P.
AVingate; and the San Francisco players
being Dr. Hibbetts J. W. Byrne, H. D.
Pillsbury. C. Page, H. Babcock, E. J. Mc-
Cutchen, S. L. Abbott Jr. and T. G.
Roberts.
The second game will be played on the
Oakland links on April S, and on the Pre
sidio links on April 15.
â¢As all the links have certain peculiari
ties of their own, what are called ground
rules are made to meet the special con
ditions. The following are the ground
rules of the Presidio links:
1. â If a ball has fallen within the course
and bo lies that an iris interferes with play
inc the same such iris may be removed by the
player. This rule does not apply to a ball
fallen outside the course.
2.â ball lying In rainwater (but not In a
hazard) may be removed without penalty, if
rain shall have fallen within 24 hours before
the match.
3.â ball may under a penalty of two
strokes be lifted out of a difficulty of any
doscription and teed behind the same.
4.â The bunkers in font of the first teeing
ground and the fourth hole must be played
out of. A ball lying on the new greens or
teeing grounds must be lifted and .placed be
hind them without penalty.
The men's competitions in driving and
in approaching set down on the pro
gramme of the San Francisco Golf Club
for this afternoon have been deferred.
No date has been set for them.
On ihe Oakland links this afternoon
there will be a competition for the ladies'
rup, which has already been competed
for twiceâ June and September. Miss
A. Duff was the first competitor and Miss
Dunham proved successful in the second.
The original Intention was that the cup
must be on three times by the same lady
before becoming her property, but it has
been settled that after a fourth competi
tion the winners on the four occasions
shall play together and the one who
makes the best score ./Shall become the
owner of the cup. .

BOXING CLUBS
SHOULD
FOLLOW RULES.
With the exception of Professor Walter
Watson there is possibly not another man
on this coast who has such a good knowl
edge of boxing as De Witt Van Court,
who is the. present boxing instructor of
the Olympic Club. Mr. Van Court, in the
following communication to The Call, of
fers many valuable suggestions to boxing
cLub managers, which they will certainly
profit by if they are desirous of keeping
the sport from taint and corruption. The
writer says:
OLYMPIC CLUB. Dec. 13.
Sporting Editor Callâ Sir: As every
one knows, the Marquis of yueensberry
Kules were written in England by an
Englishman, and In my opinion they can
iiul be improved upon, but the trouble
Americans have with them Is, I think, in
the fact that our referees, fighters and
tight managers have an Incorrect interpre
tation of them.
It is seldom an unsatisfactory decision
is given in the National Sporting Club or
London. Not that 1 think the English
referees are more honest or more compe
tent, but irom the fact that they enforce
each and every rule to the letter, being
fearless enough to do so, regardless or the
betting fraternity.
To ally cover all the points in dispute
in our boxing contests. it will be better,
perhaps, to commence from the time arti
cles are signed unnl a decision is given, as
we cau an see mistakes irom the begin-
ning to the end. In the selection or men
to nght the first mistake is made by the
managers of lighting clubs who nine times
in ten match a hard slugger against a
clever and shifty fellow. hen the light
is over the people who paid their money &rÂ«
dis*atlsried with both the tight and the de
cision, because the clever leilow ran away
and the slugger was not fast enough to
cat him. To overcome all this, let the
size of the ring be cut down, as the rules
call tor a ring of any size from sixteen to
twenty-four :eet, or better yet, match a.
â¢"slugger" with a slugger, and a clever
man with one of the same style of flght-
ing.
he next trouble Is generally the weight
proposition. A boxer will insist that he
can right at ISO pounds at 3 o'clock the
day of the contest, when as a matter of
tact he cannot make lÂ£o pounds without
leaving all his speed and vitality at the
training quarters. After the weight propo
sition is settled the selection of a referee
cornea (.a very important matter in a
light.), and the fighters generally insist
that a referee be selected at least twenty
four or forty-eight hours before a con->
test. This matter, 1 contend, should be
taken entirely out of the hands of the
fighters. What right has a lighter who is
being paid to ngtit to say who shall be
the referee? I think a better proposition
for the direct benefit of the fighters and
the sporting public would be for the man
agers of dubs or the sporting editors of
the daily pa] era to make the srlection, and
keep the same a secret until the men are
In the ring.
Next comes a squabble over a division of
the purse. Under no consideration should a
purse be split other than TO and 25 per
cent. It is only fair that a loser should re
ceive enough tor training expenses, and 25
per cent Will always cover that. There are
any number of fighters with fairly good
reputations who would consent to a decision
against them or a draw for an equal di
vision. I have not yet met a fighter who
will say that a good punch on the end of
the nose is a pleasant sensation, but I have
met quite a number who would willingly
take any number of punches on the nose or
anywhere else provided there was a good,
fat purse in Bight. We now have the
fighters In the ring:, and the farce begins
by the referee absurdly calling the men to
the center of the ring for Instructions. He
asks: "Well, boys, what are you going
to do, break away clean or hit In the
clinches?" The rules distinctly Bay: "No
clinching or wrestling allowed." It Is then
Just as much of a foul to bold or clinch a
man as It is to hit below the belt.
Referees should Insist un men hitting In
clinches, and give a contest against a man
who clinches without any warning what
ever. Some people ridicule the idea of a
referee standing outside a ring. There-Is no
occasion of a referee being within a ring
if the fighters be given to understand the
rules will be rigidly enforced.
The rules also call for a timekeeper, whose
duty it shall be to keep correct time of the
rounds and also to count the seconds for a
contestant who Is down, but under no con
sideration shall a referee act as both ref
eree and timekeeper. How many times
have we seen a man knocked down and a
referee waste several seconds trying to get
his opponent a safe distance away, so that
no fouls will be committed, and then com
mence to count off the seconds? Often the
Interval between the count la of several
seconds' duration instead of one, and. fin
ishing- the count, the referee calls. "Eight,
nine, tenâ out," Instead of "eight, nine
out." The rule on this point says: "A man
who falls or is knocked dwn shall be given
ten seconds in which to get up. unassisted;
meanwhile his opponent shall return to his
corner until the fallen man Is on his feet."
I have never had the pleasure of seeing a
man walk to his corner when he knocked
an opponent down, except John L. Sulli
van, and who will say that Sullivan was not
a fair fighter?
According to the system of fighting now
in vogue the general Impression is that the
aggressor should always be given the pref
erence, when us a matter of fact there is
nothing in the Marquis of Queensberry or
London prize-ring rules that gives a ref
eree power to decide a contest on points.
Tet every referee and fighter I have talked
to on that subject has agreed that a con
test that goes the limit should be decided
on points. The question then remains, what
constitute the points of boxing?
You will find that answer only In the
amateur rules. It includes leading, counter-
Ing, feinting, slipping, ducking, sidestep
ping and general style and finish, the blows
to be delivered with thÂ» knuckles of the
hand, and any boxer flicking, slapping or
hitting with the wrist or elbow shall be
disqualified, and only when all points are
equal shall the aggressor be given the pref
erence. The rules further state that the
scoring of points shall be for every clean
blow landed â glancing, pushing or blows
blocked with the shoulder or glove cannot
be counted as clean hitsâ the contestant
scoring the most number of clean hits to be
declared the winner.
When points are scored In this manner It
must be plain to any sensible man that a
limited contest must be fast If it Is to be
decided on points. The fastest boxing ever
Been In this city has taken place at the
Olympic Club's amateur tournaments, where
all contests are decided in this manner.
I have always been in favor of honest box
ing, but can see the game going from bad
to worse, and the only remedy I see now Is
to Instruct all referees on entering the ring:
to declare all bets off. Cut down the Blze
of the ring and I will venture thÂ» opinion
that your "fake" fighters will disappear.
Last of all Rive the people a referee who un
derstands â¢ the rules and is fearless enough
to enforce them.

The accompanying table of the standing
of the clubs is that issued by the Pacific
Coast League, and is positively correct.
To Mr. Stapleton, the official scorer, did
the task of computing the average of each
team full, and to him patrons of the
game are indebted for the information.
Mr. Stapleton's task was far more diffi
cult than most people imagine. I had no
conception of the extent of his troubles
until last Sunday, when he showed me
where ten games had been protested and
nothing had been done with them by the
emergency board. He then had to write
the country managers for certain scores
that were missing and could not be found
even among the city dailies. At least
twenty of these scores had to be- obtained,
and when they were finally received it
required a special meeting of the league s
director* to determine what should be
done regarding the protested games. For
tunately for once in their lives the mem
bers comprising the league board worked
rapidly and disposed of the protests in
marveiously quick order. This enabled
Mr. Stapleton to complete the task in
trusted to him and which is now pub
lished. Pretty soon he hopes to have the
batting, fielding and other averages of
the different players in proper shape to
publish, and then the fans and perform
wso will have an opportunity to see
just what was really accomplished dur
ing this season's work.
The fact that the Gilt Edges have won
the pennant beyond all possible doubt is
no great surprise. It was thought by
many, myself included, that owing to the
number ol' pretests registered against this
culb for employing the services of mure
Eastern men than the new rules allowed
their chances for the chumpionship,
which looked so bright, would be lost.
Mr. Stapleton's percentage table, how
ever, dispels all such ideas and proves
conclusively that, protests or no protests,
the Gilt Edges are . the real and only
champions. From the very beginning of
the season this great aggregation was
hailed as the pennant winner. Their fast,
steady playing, combined with the team
w..rk; their heavy batters and superb
pitchers, to say nothing of the other ac
complishments held by them, were
traits recognized by all lovers of tha
game as the kind that win the majority
of contests. No club seemed able to cope
with them successfully and follow it up.
True, they lost games, but that is base
ball. I would not give a cent for a team
that did not lose occasionally, nor would
I give the .same amount for a player who
could not make an error. The Gilt Edges
ore an ideal collection of players for such
a league and deserve to win. Throughout
the entire season they practiced, and sel
dom played anything but good baseball.
The people who went to see them re
ceived their moneys worth, and this can
: 1 ol but few teams in the league.
How different things would have bet n if
all the clubs represented in the league
paid a.s much attention to their work as
did the Gilt Edges. What glorious times
there would have been throughout the
season had things gone along as smoothly
with the other clubs as they did with
this same collection. The team was man
aged properly; it must have been, or the
men could not have given such a good ac
count of themeselves. Can this be said
of the other clubs? I think not, save pos
sibly the Sand Crabs. No fault worthy of
mention can be found with the Gilt Edges.
They won the pennant, and won it easily
nnd fairly, and they deserve to be termed
the "greatest team In the State."

Fell From a Scaffold.
From the Herald. Watertown. N. T.
John Young of Le Roy, N. V., is 72 years
old, and is well known In that and neigh-
boring towns. While putting some weath-
er boards on a barn, standing on a scaf-
fold twenty-two feet from the ground, he
felt dizzy, lost his balance and fell to tfte
ground. The* side of his face, arm and
one entire side of his body, on which he
struck, were badly bruised. Picked up
and carried to the house, he was under
a doctor's care for several weeks. The
doctor finally came to the conclusion that
hib patient had received a stroke of par-
alysis and
was beyond
medical aid.
H e could
not use one
arm, or turn
over In bed.
One day,
while lying
on the bed,
he read of a
case some-
thing like
his having
been cured
with Dr.
Wiilams'
Pink Pills
for Palo
People. He
coaxed his
a
by the Fall.
granddaughter to get him a box of the-
pills. After that box had been used he
secured another. In three weeks he be-
gan to feel a little life In his arm: at the
end of four he could move his fingers; at
the end of two months he could walk,
and in three months he could shave him-
self with the injured hand.
As he told his story in the Herald office
he looked the perfect picture of health.
He carries a box of the pills in his pocket,
and whenever he does not feel Just right
he takes them. They cured him after doc-
tors had given him up and his death was
daily expected.
All the elements necessary to give new
life and richness to the blood and restore

MATCH RACE
BETWEEN
TWO FAST HOUNDS
Coursing men and all those interested
in the sport are wondering at the weekly
increase of attendance at the Ingleside j
Coursing Park. In speaking of the good
times the park Is now enjoying one of the
directors said yesterday that the attend
ance during the past five or six weeks has
been something entirely unexpected; in
fact, the crowd has been so great on Sun
days that the club must enlarge its seat
ing compartments so as to give the spec
tators an opportunity to rest their tired
limbs occasionally. It has also been no
ticed that quite a sprinkling of ladies and
their escorts in carriages witness the â 
meetings held on Saturdays and Sundays.
The reason for the great popularity of
Ingleside Park is one that is easy of solu- j
tion. In the first place the patrons of the |
sport have implicit confidence in the i
honesty and excellent judgment of Judge
Grace, whose services as a coursing judge
are In demand in all parts of the coun
try where coursing is enjoyed. The leash
meo are now so well educated to the
game that the least trick advanced by a
1 r slipper with the object of "catch
the money of the unsuspecting
sports is quickiy detected and condemned j
in the presence of the spectators. In the
second place the patrons of Ingleside Park
are aware of the fact that Judge Grace ]
keeps close up to the contesting dogs from i
start to finish and is not afraid to answer |
questions and give the score of points '
made in every course to any person who ;
seeks information.
The judge of a coursing park can kill !
the game by giving wrong decisions, i
whether they be intentional or on tuc
count of poor judgment because of a lim- i
ited knowledge of the rules which govern i
the sport. Good decisions always mean j
prosperous sport, and that is why Ingle- |
side Park is flourishing to-day and will
continue to flourish as long as Judge !
Grace will remain in the pigs...n.
There will not be any coursing at in- j
fleslde on Saturday and Sunday, the 24th 1
and 25th inst.. as Judge Grace is booked ;
to judge the big open meeting which will i
be held in Los Angeles Coursing Park
on those days.
The San Jose Coursing Club will hold !
an open mee..ng at Agricultural Park,
Ssin Jose, on Christmas day. The dub
will add $150 to the purse. The entries
for the 32-dog stake will close on Friday,
the 2"( i inst. It is said that the railroad
company will give a reduction of rates
to those who will leave on the 7 a. m.
train leaving Third and Townsend streets
on the 25th.
The Stockton Coursing Club will also
hold an open meeting on Christmas day.
Among the proniinent local coursing
men who have signified their Intention
of visiting Los Angiles are John and
James Grace, P. Reilly, J. Sheehan, D.
Hooper, Messrs. Massey, Thompson, DicK
son and Mellugh.
Betting on tiie great match between
Moondyne and Patria is quite spirited,
with Moondyne still a favorite. If strong
running hares are met Patria stands an
excellent chanoe of winning, but as the
late rain has started the young rrass, the
hares may not prove so good as hereto
fore.
Tim Cronin has Wild Tralee. a stake
winner, and Rose of Tralee down with
distemper. McComb <>f Santa Clara is also
nursing Royal Flush and Flush, both of
which are on the distemper list.
"Prince" Jerome expects some gTeat
"flyers" from Australia on the new
steamer. Reports say that they are
Bcorchers.
A Case Settled Out of Court.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday dismissed the suit of P. J. Van
Loben Sels against Lester D. Greene and
others to recover 150,000 damages for in
juries inflicted on his lands near Walnut
Grove, Sacramento County, by the over
flow from the irrigation ditches of the
plaintiff. The dismissal was made on the
motion of Warren Olney, one of tho at
torneys, who explained that the suit had
been settled out of court.
Railroad Trains to Run Slo-wer.
Railroad officials claim that It Is very ex
pensive to run their lightning express trains,
and are talking about reducing the speed. It
Is likewise expensive to the health to rush
and struggle and compete In business affairs
as mon do nowadays. The brain, the nerves,
the muscles, the whole system gives out. For
restoring strength after business worries, i
Hostett'.-r's Stomach Hitters is the proper I
remedy. It Is an ideal tonic for the tired, the j
run-down and the weak.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
MRS. MENTEL
DESCRIBES
THE MURDER
Sticks to Her Plea of
Self-Defense.
REMANDED WITHOUT BAIL
EXPECTS TO SECURE FREEDOM
ON HABEAS CORPUS.
fays She Shot at Her Husband as
\. Fast as She Could Work the
i Trigger of Her
./â  Weapon.
ALAJMEDA, Dec. 16.â The preliminary
examination of Mrs. Anna Mentel,
charged with the murder of her husband,
'â was clo.sed to-day, and Justice Morris
MRS. MENTEL Swearing to Tell
the Truth About the Murder of
Her Husband.
held her to answer before the Supsrior
Court. Despite the strenuous efforts of
the defendant a attorneys, the Judg
fused l" admit her to bail. As Boon as |
the shorthand reporter's notes of thÂ»> tes- i
timony ran be transcribed her attorneys
.â¢will attempt to secure lier release on a
Writ of hab< as corpus.
Mr?. Mentel wenl on the witness stand
in her own behalf. She told the story of
. th<-> shooting and related the circum-
j stances leading up to the quarrel which
terminated in her husband's death. 11 it
attorneys confined their questions to her
jacts in the immediate vicinity of the j
ttragedy, and when the prosecution un
. dertook to cross-examine ht-r on occur-
J renews remote from the scene of the '
shooting the court sustained the objtfc- 1
itlons of the defense, which prevented the
District Attornej from drawing any testi
mony from Mrs. Mentel except that fa
vorable to her plea of self-defense.
; Mrs. Mentel'i demeanor was a study in
JBtolcimn. Lhe did 1101 evince the least
â emotion, and told the story of the shoot-
Ing' as though it was a commonplace aÂ£
ifalr. There, was the least evidence of
braggadocio about it all when she de
jecribed without a falter how she drew

She stuck to her original story that her

; curses he had thrown her to the ground,
'and then, in self-defense and in fear of
her life, she had shot him to death. She
'answered the questions of her attorneys
â  without hesitation and readily gave the
'.most minute details of the tragedy. Jn
marked contrast were her replies to the
â  queries of the prosecution. Her memory
I failed her. To almost every, question she
dropped her f;yes, tapped her forehead
I nervously, as though trying to recall to

"We had been quarreling for some mm!

It was admitted in evidence that the
couple had been married at 39G South

iby City Justice Gass. It was also ad-
Jmitted that the license was issued in the
name of Wiliiam Fred Menten and Anna
Beth, but that the deceased had sub-
Bcribed his correct name to the affidavit.
> Dr. S. H. Buteau. who assisted at the
autopsy, and Constable Georg* Gray, who
assisted In taking the defendant to the
Receiving Hospital the night of the trag
edy, corroborated witnesses who had pre
viously testified for the prosecution.
Attorney W. W. Foote pleaded with the
court to admit his client to bail. He
based his argument on the ground that
there had been no evidence to prove the
crime of murder in the lirst degree and
that. In fact, all the testimony went to
show that the woman had shot her hus
band In self-defense, fearing for her life.
Justice Morris did not agree with the
attorney, axid remanded the defendant to
the custody of th>> Sheriff without bail.

DENIES THE
STEALING OF
TWO GIRLS
Rev. Henderson Has a
Clean Record.
CHARGES ARE INVESTIGATED
A SACRAMENTO OFFICIAL VISITS
OAKLAND.
He Calls on the Girls and Commends
the Course Taken by the
Home - Finding
Society.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Dec. 16.
Rev. J. E. Henderson, accused of steal
ing: two children from Sacramento, has
returned to Oakland ami has made an
explanation of his conduct which places
him in a very different light.
He is the coast superintendent of the
American Home-Finding Association,
with headquarters in this city. This so
ciety is now being incorporated, and
among its most prominent supporters are:
Rev. R. S. Coyle, D. D.. Rev. iÂ£. S. Chap
man. Mrs. G. W. Halght. Rev. H. M. Mc-
Knlghi, Dr. M. V. Klmball, Mrs. S. C.
Sanford and President Craigie Sharp.
â¢'Two days ago," said Mr. Henderson,
"the fall published a story crediting me
on tli<r- authority of an officer of another
association with doing things that were
Illegal and dishonest. This is not true.
The two children 1 brought to Oakland
were two little girls whom one of our
agentn found in Sacramento requiring as
sistance. We had failed to find a home
for them there, so he turned them over to
me. 1 went to Sacramento and found the
girls, one ! ( J years old. who is about to
become a mother, and the other 16 years
old. The elder one claimed be the guar
dian of the younger. 1 learned that the
mother of these girls lived in Nevada and
that in urd.-r to avoid sharing in her
daughter's disgrace, she had given them
both money with which they had traveled
t<> Sacramento, and when we found them
they had only 12 left. I brought them to
(>;ikiand and they are now well provided
lor.
"This action was investigated by the
Sacramento Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, and yesterday Dan
iel Uealy. special officer of that society,
came to Oakland. Hi- was taken by Presi
dent Sharp to see the girls and after
questioning them he indorsed my action,
Having that I was right and that theÂ»eom
plainta made in Sacramento are entirely
groundless.
"The statements made by Rnbbl Simon,
Rev. J. W . Daniels and others in Sacra
mento are without foundation. I have
never been expelled from a ministerial so
il.-tv and am not under a cloud of any
kind. I have done nothing which would
show mv unfitnoss for active service in
the Christian ministry. 1 have been In
the ministry at Soquel. ' Angels Camp,
Golden Gate. Howard Lake and Minneap
olis, and the ministers at these, confer
ences will show that my record is clear
and that I have left these several charges
with the kindliest relations between the
congregations and myself."
President Sharp of the Oakland Society
fully indorsed Mr. Henderson's statement.
STILL WARRING OVER
J. W. SMITH'S ESTATE
ENDEAVORING TO BEMOVE AD
MINISTRATOR KING.
The Queer Instructions of a Dying
Capitalist Carried Out and
Made Puhlic.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 16.
There were some very interesting fea
tures at to-day's hearing of the petition
of I>ena I. Snodgrass and Sadie E.
Thompson for the removal of C. K. King
as administrator of the $500,000 estate of
John W. Smith.
According to Administrator King, who
again w^ent on the stand, the- late Mr.
Smith was decidedly eccentric. The late
railway magnate was a stanch believer
In Christian science and was being treated
by its apostles until one month prior to
his death, when relatives succeeded in
persuading him to engage the services
of Dr. Ackerlv.
Mr. Smith had also instructed witness
regarding his funeral arrangements.
These matters were all contained in the
handwriting of Smith and were produced
on the stand by King. In this instru
ment, which Judge Ogden was inclined to
regard almost in the same category as
a will. Smith had requested that in the
event of his death his "remains he dressed
in his night robe and socks," and be
placed in v plain redwood coffin; that
there be but two hacks and a hearse.

A MONARCH OF A
GROUP OF ISLANDS
AMONG the passengers who arrived on the Gaelic yesterday was G.
Clunles-Ross, a Scotchman who has passed the last forty years of
his life as ruler of the Christmas and Cocoas-Keeling islands, a
group of the Indian archipelago, off the coast of Batavia. He is now
en route to England in order to present a report to the Colonial Sec
retary on the condition of affairs in the Christmas insular group. Clunles-
Ross left Scotland in the forties as the colonizing agent of Great Britain, and
- this is his first return to the home
"The Islands, seven in number, and
populated with about as many hun
dred people, were in their original
uncivilized state when I arrived
there many years ago," he said, yes
terday. "The inhabitants are of the
Malayan type, docile to training and
the beneficial operations of a clvil
izer. We have established schools
which aim at a practical education,
teaching the natives the use of t"<>ls
as well as the rudiments of the Kn
glish language. You would be sur
prised to see how well the men have
learned the. first lessons of carpentry
and agriculture. In the matter of n-
ligion I have never Interfered with their gods or their beliefs, allowing
each man freedom In religious worship. No missionary work has beta
done there yet the natives seem satisfied. For eighteen years I ril<l not
use the FngliÂ«h language The tongue of the natives was a difficult one
to learn but f mastered it after arduous and severe labor and now I am
quite a linguist In all the dialects of the Christmas group. The only white
people who lived with m^ are my brothers and my family, who joined me
Home time after my arrival there. The natives are morally good. They
were ardent gamblers and drinkers when I reached the Islands, but thla
has been suppressed almost entirely."
The Christmas Islands are not In the possession of Great Britain, al
though the British flag flies there. Once a year an English sailing vessel
touches the sole port in the group, supplying the coionizor with all the
little luxuries and gastronomic amenities of life. The natural food produce
of the islands, consisting oi rice and breadfruit, is sufficient for the needs
of the native population.
tral Bank." continued the instructions,
"and on my death I wish this box and my
trunk, also my desk, to be placed in
my room and the room locked. >.o
one is to be allowed in the room until my
son arrives from Denver, who shall be
immediately advised of my death by tele
graph."
Administrator King testified that all
these requests had been executed, but
that he never knew what the tin box con
tained, since no one but the son, Charles
H. Smith, was permitted to open it. It
Is supposed that it held the deeds convey
ing valuable properties to this son.
F. W. Sawyer was next called by the
defense to show that King had brought
suits to recover certain property belong
ing to the estate. He said that he had
commenced suits to recover lands in Te
hama County; also a suit against the
Shenandoah Mining Company, and that
he afterward advised King to sue the
heirs for other properties, but that King
refused .md subsequently engaged Wil
liam R. Davis hjs his attorney.
Kefore court adjourned a small surprise
wHis sprung to the effect that Charles H.
Smith will probably be called to testify
next Monday or Tuesday.
"We would like to ascertain C. 11.
Smith's address," said Attorney de Golia
on behalf of the contestants, "because we
wish to subpena him."
â¢'You need not bother fibout a subpena."
replied Attorney Davis. "We admit that
Mr. Smith is now in San Francisco, and
he will be hf-ro when wanted."

HARBOURNE
IS ANXIOUS TO
MAKE AMENDS
Defaulting Librarian
Heard From.
WRITES FROM THE KLONDIKE
TELLS THE STORY OF HIS WAN
DERINGS AND TROUBLES.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 16.â John "W. Har
bourne. the defaulting librarian of the
Alameda Public Library, Is no longer in
hiding. He has written to a close friend
in this city, divulging his whereabouts
and imparting the information that he is
doing well. He writes that he is filled
With remorse at his shortcomings and
says his one object in life will be to re
pay the losses of all who suffered by his
defalcation. In mitigation of his offense
he asserts that the financial assistance
he rendered certain friends led him into
wrongdoing.
Harbourne has still many warm friends
in Alameda, and they have frequently
announced that had he\ when his troubles
came down upon him, stayed here and
faced the music they would unhesitatingly
have made good his shortage.
The missing librarian is in the Klon
dike, ami has an interest in a claim fif
teen miles from Dawson City. The pro
ceeds from this, he writes, will enable
him to pay back within a year every dol
lar he owes the city of Alameda or his
friends.
There have been frequent rumors that
Harbourne had fled to the gold fields of
the frozen north, but this Is the first
Information received directly from him.
When he left Alameda under a cloud, he
says, he did not have with him the money
he was reported to have carried away,
lie states, In fact, that he had barely
enough to pay his expenses for a couple
of days, and had to seek employment
within a week after leaving this city in
order to keep from starving. He llrst
took the train to Pleasanton, Alameda
County, from whore he walked through
the Tassajara country and over the
Muiint Diablo range to Antioch, where
he boarded a steamer bound for Stockton.
He worked for a few days in a Stockton
hotel and then made his way to Saera
menta He secured employment at the
capital city, remaining there three weeks.
From the proceeds he saved enough to
pay his fare to Seattle.
He worked around Seattle for several
weeks doing odd Jobs and then fell in with
a party bound for Klondike. Harbourne
was an expert chef and was Invited to
join the party to take charge of the culin
ary department. After experiencing many
hardships he and his new found friends
reached the gold fields. His companions
Btaked out claims near Dawson. but Har
bourno went farther on. and finally, ac
cording to his letter, "struck it rich."
He evidently heard of his indictment by
the Grand Jury before he left Seattle, for
he suggests to his friend to inquire if the
charges against him cannot be quashed if
he repays the amounts for which he de
faulted.
"You will probably think it strange,"
writes Harbourne, "that I could stop in
Sacramento where I have m9ny acquaint
ances without having my identity discov
ered, but after I got out of Pleasanton
and took to the road I cut my mustache
off with a pair of scissors and after that
allowed my beard to grow. In a week I
hardly knew myself, and I believe I could
walk up Park street. Alameda, without
any of my friends recognizing me.
"I wish'l had my life to live over again.
I have always been good to people I
thought were my friends and it never
dawned on me until I was deep In the hole
that they had been pushing along a good
thing. In another year, unless all indica
tions fall, I will be able to square myself.
I wonder If I paid back all the money I
was short if the people of Alameda would
still want to prosecute me."

SAY THEY HAD
A RIGHT TO
ROB THE DEAD
CLAIM MADE BY THE
DBFENSE.
Attorney Bennett Declares the
Father of Lillian Brandes
Was Privileged to Muti
late Her Corpse.
The sensation yesterday was the re
markable turn given to the Brandes mur
der trial by the publication In yesterday's
Call â !' the fact that the murdered girl
â was buried Without ber skull, which was
taken from her coffin by representatives
of the defense just a f<-w minutes before
the funeral services commenced.
But for a trifling incident no one would
have known except Dr. Woolsey and At
torney iicnn<>ti that Lillian's skull had
been removed and would be used a3 evi
dence in the trial of the case. Deputy
Coroner Streightif left the morgue at
Berkeley just a? Dn Woolsey and Attor
ney Bennett arrived. He extracted a
promise irnni them that they would leave
every thi up us they found it. When he re
turned half an hour later the friends wore
arriving to follow the murdered girl's re
ni;>ins to the grave.
In placing the lid on the coffin Streigh
tif happened to place his hand on the top
of the girl's head to straighten out the
disheveled hair. This exhibition of ten
dernessâfor it could have been nothing
fine, under the circumstancesâ brought to
light the fact that there was nothing un
der the hair. Those who had taken the
Fkull tad arranged the hair so as to cover
up their work, and had done it so well as
t" deceive any one who looked at the gin'a
face.
Strelehtif's fingers as he ran them
through the long hair at once revealed
the absence of the skull. The minister
was present and friends were standing
around the coffin. =n Streightlf's profes
sionalism came to his aid, and he decided
not to precipitate any unpleasantness at
the last moment, bo he strewed on the lid
and allowed the body to be buried.
As soon as possible streightif com
municated with Attorney Bennett and the
latH r told him that he had takc-a the
and that there need be no Bensatlon
made about it, a? he had acted within
liis right. This did not satisfy Ptreightif.
who demanded from Attorney Bennett a
receipt for the skull. The attorney gave
him the unique document, which In Itself
will be part of the evidence to be used at
the trial in proving that the skull, which
will h>- produced in court, is in reality
that taken from the head of the dead girl.
The receipt was very carefully worded
and r'-a'ls:

Brandes, deceased, to be used as cvi

Gram-o phonp
dence in the case of the people vs.
Brandes. JOHN E. BENNETT,
Of Counsel for Defense.
! This Is all the substitute that Streigh
: tif has for Lillian Brandes' skull. When
i asked for a statement regarding this re
1 markable case, Attorney Bennett said:
"1 did go to the Coroner's office at
Berkeley, accompanied by Dr. Woolsey,
to niak>> an examination of the body of
Lillian Brandes. We arrived then- just
before the funeral was held. Mr. Streigh
! lif went away and left the body for us
I to make whatever examination we de
| sired. He asked us to leave everything
! as we found it, and we agreed to do so.
, His remark meant that he did not wish
I us to leave the body disarranged or to do
anything that would give him work.
In* this respect we kept our word. We
found the body In a low coffin, ready for
I the funeral, and Mr. Strelghtif objected
very much to having us make an exami
nation at that time. When we saw the
condition of the skull we decided to take
it with us to be used as evidence in the
1 case and at the proper time to be used as
an exhibit. We did not mutilate the dead
i girl for the skull had been detached at
' the autopsy. When the Coroner returned.
Dr. Woolsey Was ready to leave in his
buggy, which had been standing outside.
But I remained several minutes later.
"The head was stuffed with excelsior
| and neatly sewed over, and presented in
no way a disarranged appearance. I re
i malned with Mr. Streiprhtif after his re
turn, hut said nothing to him about the
removal of the skull, because It was
within half an hour of the time set for
the funeral. People were already begln
i ning to rap on the door for admittance.
There was also another man in the room
j with us. and I did not care to talk of the
matter at the time, because it might ap
pear a little grewsome; that is to say, It
might be so regarded by the popular mind
and cause whisperings during the funeral.
Then again. Deputy Coroner Streightlf is
of a somewhat excitable disposition, and
could not perhaps appreciate the rights
of attorneys in such matters. So 1 thought
it best to ke-'p the information from him
until after the funeral. Had he not dis
covered it we should not have said any
thing about the skull until we produced It
at the trial.
"I believe that we are perfectly justified
by law in taking: the skull. If there be
any property :n a girl's dead body it cer
tainly belongs to her father, and we were
acting for him and with his authority.
We contend that it is a great deal easier
to show to a jury the condition of the j
skull by presenting it to the jurors and !
letting them see it for themselves than
by permitting a half dozen physicians to
describe in scientific and ambiguous terms
that which the skull itself can show at a
glance.
"As a matter of fact, the skull does not
show any evidence of being beaten. In
examining the witnesses for the prosecu
tion they were all very careful. Knowing
we had the skull, to account for the fact
that there were no injuries visible on the
outside of the skull. They all explained
that a young girl's skull could be heavily
beaten and that the evidence would be ln-
Bide and not outside.
"Another point of great importance is
the testimony of the experts regarding
hanging. One afternoon 1 asked Dr. Bu
teau if it were not possible for all the
symptoms of hanging to be absent and
yet for death to nave been caused by
hanging. Dr. Huteau ridiculed the idea,
hut next morning, after he nad looked the
matter up. h<- found that such Is some
times the case, and we contend that it
was in this case."
Although holdln 1 - the receipt for the
skull of Lillian Brandes, the prosecution
declares that it will be a very hard mat
ter to prove that the skull is really that
Â«it' the dead girl. It has already been ad
â  mittt-d by thr> defense that the skull was
I r>,)t r'-eÂ»'inted for until after It was taken
i from Lillian's coffin and that it has been
|in their possession ever since. Should the
skull not compare with the testimony of
the experts for the prosecution, the State
: will no doubt deny that the skull pro
duced In evidence is the skull of Lillian,
and will force the defense to prove that
it is. Even *he exhuming of the body at
, that time might not prove that the skull
held by the defense was really a portion
of the muruered girl's head. When asked
about this matter Dr. Buteau said:
"When the skull is produced in court I
hope, if It differ at all from the testimony,
that it will differ very materially. I d"o
not knew whose hands the skull may pass
i through before it gets before a jury, and
I shall make no criticisms. I have! how
i ever, a very positive knowledge of the
i exact condition of the skull and raera
! branes at the autopsy, and if they are not
; the same when 1 a^ain see them I shall
I instantly recognizp any change, and so, I
am sure, will the other physicans in high
standing who were present with me at the
J an: >psy."
Judge J. J. Allen. District Attornpy
elect. who has been conducting the pros
ecution of Hrandes. thinks it hard
ly probable that any charges will be pre
ferred against Attorney Bennett and Dr.
Woolsey on account of their having re
moved the skull cap from the girl's head.
â¢â Of course, not having as yet assumed
the office of District Attorney." he said
I "it is not for me to make any move in
i the matter. That is a question for Mr.
Snook to deride I have read the see-
I tlon of the penal code providing for the
. punishment of body snatchers, and while
I have not studied it closely, it Is my be
lief that the statute is so loosely drawn
that it would be very difficult to obtain
a ennviction should Mr. Bennett ami I>r
Woolsoy be charged with desecrating the
body (if the dead rirl. I think it very
doubtful if it would be advisable to pro
ceed against them.
"As far as the prosecution is concerned
the fact that the defense has possession
r.f the skull makes little difference. We
have made our entire case on the ground
that, the skull shows death was Sue to
violent blows on the head. Our expert
witnesses, who examined tho skull short
ly after It was first discovered that the
girl had been murdered, have all testified
to this fact. They base their belief on
the discoloration* of th* blood vesspls be
tween the plates of the skull and the
adhesion Oi tu* membranes of the brain
to the bone. The doctors are all reputa
ble physicians r^qun] in skill to Dr. Wool
sey. They found the skull in such a
condition that they believed the girl had
been killed by a blow on the head. They
arrived at their com-lnsion from an ex
amination nf the skull snnn after death
Whether the discolorations noticed by
them are still evident T do not know
The time which has plafesed may have
effaced them, or they mny have been re
moved by other means, but the fact that
they were there we can clearly prove by
the physicians who have nlreadv testified
In the preliminary hearing which resulted
In Prandes beinc held to answer for the
murder of rifs daughter.
"The question of th" legality of the
action of the defense laid aside." they de
serve public condemnation for their' des
ecration of th<Â» body of Miss Brandes. I
believe that the sentiment of the people
Is penlnst them. They went in an un
derhanded way to the Coroner's office and
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1898.
eurreptitously removed the skull of the
dead girl, hoping by thus robbing the dead
to acquit of the charge of murder the
man believed to be responsible for the
death.
"The first I knew of the fact that they
had taken the skull was last Thursday.
Dr. Buteau, the autopsy surgeon, testi
fied in court that day, and after leaving
the stand I overheard a remark he made
to Mr. Bennett that led me to believe
that the attorney had possession of the
skull. The day Bennett and Dr. Wool
sey visited the Morgue, Deputy Coroner
Streightlf telephoned of the fact, but I
thought nothing of the matter, and at
that time was not aware that the skull
had been taken."
Dr. E. H. Woolsey, the physician who,
at the request of Attorney Bennett, re
moved the skull cap from the head of the
dead girl, refused to speak of the part he
took in the affair. "When the proper time
arrives," he said. "I 'will tell in an offi
cial way what I know of the transaction.
This will probably be when the case
comes to trial in the Superior Court and
I am subpenaed as a witness. Until then
it would hardly be professional for me to
say anything.
On being asked as to the legality of the
action of himself and Attorney Bennett
in taking the skull the doctor smiled, and
leading the way to a closet in which he
keeps his grewsome anatomical specimens
he produced a dozen or more skull
caps which he stated he had removed
from the heads of persons who
had died by violence. "Whether It is
legal or not." he said. "I do not know and
have never inquired, but I have been
'pinching' skull caps for the last quarter
of a century, and at present am of the
opinion that I will continue to do so for
some years to come. I have always taken
them in the interest of science, and I be
lieve I have a right to secure as many
specimens as I am fortunate enough to
come within re;|ching distance of. The
oldest skull cap I have belonged to a man
who came to an untimely end in 1874."
The doctor continued by giving a volu
ble and interesting history of his uncanny
treasures of years gone tÂ»y, and fondled
them as a miser would his gold. As to
the last treasure added to his hoard he
was silent. He would not exhibit nor ad
mit that he had in his possession the
skull cap he secured from the head of
Lillian Brandes a few moments before
the funeral services of the murdered girl
began.
In Justice Cliffs court yesterday morn
ing the preliminary hearing of Brandes
was speedily concluded, and he was held
to answer in the Superior Court for the
murder of Lillian Brandes and was re
fused bail.
THE PABST CAFE.
It Is Now One of the Most Elegant
Refreshment Resorts in San
Francisco.
Among the more elegant refreshment
resorts of San Francisco which It is a
delight to visit is the Pabst Cafe at the
corner of Ellis and Powell streets. Messrs.
Leonhardt & Hagerty, its enterprising
proprietors, have from time to time Im
proved the Interior of the cafe at great
expense, so that to-day it Is one of the
most richly appointed and finished institu
tions of Its kind on the Pacific Coast.
The most recent Improvement which is
worthy of extended notice is the addition
of twelve handsomely furnished private
dining rooms on the main floor In what
was formerly the principal dining room.
This spacious apartment, furnished at an
expense of $35,000 and decorated in a high
ly artistic manner, has long been a source
of admiration to every visitor. With the
addition of the private rooms the general
effect is greatly enhanced. The apart
ments are constructed of birdseye ma
ple, finished with silver trimmings of the
richest patterns. Over eacu chamber
hang a number of electric sunbursts,
sheading a brilliant but soft radiance
upon the interior of every room. The ta
bles and chairs are of the richest pat
terns and elegantly finished. The mech
anism of the walls Is such that two rooms
may lie thrown into one and thus provide
accommodation for large private dining
parties.
Each chamber is named after some
State. These are California, Texas, Mon
tana. Oregon, Louisiana. Washington,
Colorado. Illinois, New York, Kentucky
and Tennessee. Another chamber has
been called Honolulu.
Another important feature of the es
tablishment is the superb grJJI and cafe,
which Is now open all night. This was
found necessary In order to accommodate
a large and steadily increasing patronage.
The private entrance from Powell street
affords privacy to all patrons of the cafe.
Messrs. Leonhnrdt & Hagerty are very
popular caterers, and the success they
nave met with Is a popular manifestation
of public approval. *

blow from a street car "through the care
lessness of the railway company."
In the case of Mrs. Georgie Meadows,
who committed suicide by swallowing
carbolic acid on December 3, the jury ren

HIS TRUNK LOOTED.
Boutros Helwie Has Emil Havis
Sehemeil Arrested for Burglary.
Emil Havis Sehemeil, who says he Is a
correspondent for a leading newspaper
in Egypt, was arrested yesterday by Po
liceman Aiken and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of burglary.
The complaining witness Is Boutros
Helwie, 4 Boyce street, who alleges that
Sehemeil last Sunday, during his ab
sence, broke open, his trunk and stole a
number of medals he had obtained from
the Cnited States Government and from
agricultural fairs, and also several pri
vate letters and promissory notes of the
value of $300. Helwie is a professor of
mosaic work, and the medals were pre
sented to him for that class of work.

THERE WILL BE NO MONEY
TO RUN THE TAX OFFICE
AT the recent election the people decided that they had had enough of James
N. Block as Tax Collector of the city and county of San Francisco. They
were displeased with his manipulations of the military roll, in which the
names of dead men and non-residents were enrolled at 5 cents per name,
and for which the people had to pay.
It now transpires that the voters made a grave mistake In not retir
ing Mr. Block two years ago. before he had an opportunity to deliberately place
the municipality in a scandalous position, the means for the escape from which
has not been discovered.
The office of Tax Collector is not governed in its expenditures by the one
twelfth act, as are the other departments, and the Tax Collector, therefore, has
no check upon his acts in the way of drawing upon the treasury even to the
amount of the whole apportionment at one time.
To this fact Is due the anxiety at the Mayor's office as to what is to be done
to keep the Tax Collector's office in operation during the remainder of the fiscal
year.
The apportionment to this department for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1899, was $30,000. Heretofore there has been no material difficulty in conducting
the office with the allowance, but for reasons best known to himself Mr. Block
has withdrawn from the treasury since July 1. this year, the sum of $25,622 20.
The items by the month were: July, $4500: August, $2300; September $2300; Oc
tober, $6798 90; November, $9223 30. This only includes November expenses, and as
the December salaries will be very heavy the $4377 remaining in the fund will not
only be exhausted but it is probable that the incoming Collector, Mr. Sheehan,
will find a deficit with which to begin his administration.
Tlie serious part of the situation is the fact that there is no money at present
available to keep the tax collecting machinery moving.
Edward I. Sheehan. Tax Collector-elect, is at present suffering great mental
distress oyer the condition of affairs. On Monday his attention was called to the
nearly complete utilization of the fiscal appropriation for the running of his of
fice, and since then he has been laboring strenuously to induce the Supervisors
to increase the appropriation.
"On Monday I received word from Auditor Broderlck," he said hist night,
"that there was no money for me to begin my work. I saw several of the Su
pervisors, and they informed me that it was too late for them to come to my
assistance. That lamln a quandary of no mean proportions I appreciate too
truly. A solution of the difficult problem may be reached, but in what manner
I cannot foretell."
Mr. Block has the distinction, according to the authorities at the City Hall,
of. being the first man to placo the office in such a dire position.
PHELAN CLAIMS
SIX MEMBERS OF
THE NEW BOARD
Said to Have Assured
Him Support.
The scramble for office amonff those
who think they are entitled to recognition
at the hands of the successful candidates
In the recent election is growing more
eager and persistent each day, and those
who have appointments to make are be
sieged on every side by hordes of hungry
politicians. The probable alignment of
the newly elected members of the Board
of Supervisors has been almost lost sight
of temporarily by the clamor made by >
the office-seekers, but the indications are
that unless new combinations are effected i
the gang will not be able to run things â 
with a high hand, as heretofore, during
the administration of Mayor Phelan.
The Mayor is credited with claiming i
that he will have the support of six mem
bers of the now Hoard of Supervisors, i
and thus be able to prevent the passage of
obnoxious measures over his veto. If he
oaa control the votes of four he will be ,
master of the situation, and it is not be- |
lieved by those who are familiar with the
make-up of the new board that he can i
count positively on more than that num
ber.
Those who are said to have assured the !
Mayor of their support are John Lack- j
mann, Albert Heyer, Dr. Perrault, Arthur
Attridge, Jeremiah Deasy and LÂ«. F. By
ington. Dr. Perrault is said to have stated
that he would stand by Phelan, and the
others, with (he exception of Attridge,
are known to be friendly to him. At
tridge, however, is regarded as an exceed
ingly doubtful customer.
Speculation as to the make-up of the !
various committees is already rife. Ac- !
cording to tho latest information Dr. Per
rault is slated for the chairmanship of the
Hospital Committee, Howard Black will
head the Committee on Printing, Ed
ward Holland that on finance, while Ed- I
ward Aigeltinger will be chairman of the I
Committee on Streets. Clerk Russell and
Assistant Clerk Farquharson will re
main.
Coroner-elect Hill has dec.ued upon the
following appointments: Pete J. McCor
mick, chief deputy; Joe Mogan, John
Gately and George Lacalnbe, deputies;
Steve Potter, stenographer, and Dr.
Frank Fitzgibbon, autopsy physician.
These appointments are said to have been
made without consulting ihe nominating !
committee of one hundred, and it is said |
to be the intention of Dr. Hill to ignore
entirely the agreement entered into with
that body when he was nominated for the
office.
Dr. Dodge, Assessor-elect, is also cred- j
ited with having broken away from the â¢
committee and to have declared that he :
will dish out the patronage at his disposal i
regardless of its wishes or suggestions.
He is at present confined to his house
with a slight illness and has given out
that he has not yet decided on any of his !
appointees.
Sheriff Martin has not made up his slate,
but Dave Martin will be Under Sheriff and
W. 1. Manner will be chief outside depu
ty. John M. Chretien and Edgar D. Peix
otto are after the appointment of Sher
iff's attorney, with the chances slightly in
favor of C nretien.
County Clerk Deane will retain some of
Curry's courtroom clerks, together with
Marriage License Clerk Danforth and
Probate Clerk Northruu. George McComb
also expects a place in the office.
Charles Corey will be chief deputy in
the Recorder's office, and E. B. Perkins
expects a similar position in the Treas
urer's office. Deputy District Attorney
Hinkle and Clerks Tungate and Blair will
probably remain in the District Attorney's
office.
Auditor Wells will retain Dan Leary,
but will orobably make his son chief dep
uty. In the Tax Collector's office the
chief deputy will probably be James Mc-
Cabe, with J. J. Sullivan as cashier and
Thomas Dwyer clerk.
Pat Prendergast will be taken care of In
the Street Department or oTic of the Po
lice Courts.
The medical profession is deeply inter
ested in the appointment of the local
Board of Health by Governor Gage.
Among those prominently mentioned for
the honor are Dr. Bazet. Dr. Williamson.
Dr. Winslow Anderson. Dr. W. S. Thorne,
Dr. M. 11. Woolsey, Dr. Ford, Dr. Regens
burgcr and Dr. Carpenter.
FBANCE AND THE JEW.
Dr. Voorsanger's Lecture at the Tem
ple Emanu-El Last Evening.
"Sold Out to the Jews" was the sub
ject of Dr. Voorsanger's eloquent address
I at Temple Emanu-El last evening. It was
a discussion of popular prejudice existing,
I especially In France, against the son of
Israel, the text of which was the prose
cution of Dreyfus, accused of divulging
official secrets to the enemies of France.
The rabbi dwelt on the fact that the de
cree which sent the condemned Jew to
such a dreadful punishment had never
I been signed by any higher authority than
! the French Secretary of War, who is an
i army officer. This was an act hatched by
I the military oligarchy of the republic
I against the Jewish prisoner.
Another point was that the sending of
i Dreyfus to such a far spot as Devils Is
land was to remove him and all possible
! dangerous disclosures from Paris and re
i vision.
"Vendus aux Juifs"â sold out to the
' Jewsâ the cry of the antl-semitic mob of
| Paris. Is an attempt, he said, to make the
i people believe that the Dreyfus matter Is
j a Jewish affair and an endeavor to move
hr-aven and earth against the accused man
and his race generally.
France has a population of 39,000.000, of
which 75,000 are Jews, but the. percentage
of Jews who take an important part in
the public affairs of that country is far
greater. The French Jew has made for
himself an honored place on the pages
of the republic's history, and his name Is
forever woven with that of France.

IRVING BARS
DUNNE FROM
THE JURY ROOM
Accused of Partiality
for School Board.
The School Directors are out for the
scalplock of E. D. Stanton, former
teacher in the Business Evening School,
and if he takes advantage of the quash
ing of the Indictment that has stood
against him and returns here to tell the
Grand Jury what he knows of the School
Board, that body will make his sojourn
no pleasant one, no matter how short It
may be.
Yesterday the Directors called in the
services of a special attorney and got an
opinion from him that the quashing of
the indictment was not legal, as the pro
vision in the criminal code which provides
for such an action is only applicable to
a co-defendant who desires to turn State's
evidence. Upon this assumption thÂ«
board will probably appear by its repre
sentative before Judge Cook to-day and
a-sk that the indictment be restored. This
failing it is the intention of Dr. Ragan.
who nrst preferred the charge of extor
tion against Stanton, to have him rear
rested upon the same charge, or that of
conspiracy.
He will be again arrested, not upon an
indictment, but upon a warrant sworn
out in the Police Court, and Director Ra
gan proposes to force the charge to a
hearing, as he claims that he has every
necessary proof to convince the jury that
Stanton tried to blackmail him to tne
tune of three hundred and odd dollars.
The Grand Jury, however, is taking no
chances of a further hindrance to its in
vestigation. It learned yesterday that
Stanton will probably arrive in this city
to-day or to-morrow and will go before
them on Monday afternoon to make his
promised startling revelations. The meet
ing of the jury yesterday, though out
wardly held only for the purpose of form
ally bringing in its Indictments against
McGlade, was the occasion <jf another
red-hot roast by Chairman Irving of the
schools committee of Assistant District
Attorney Dunne.
Mr. Irving repeated to his fellow jury
men the charges that that official was
doing everything' in his power to obstruct
the investigation into School Board
crookedness. He told them that unless
Mr. Dunne were barred from the jury
room when the investigation was resumed
he would have nothing further to do with
it.
"I propose to conduct the balance of this
investigation without his help," said Mr.
Irving, "and if I need legal opinions to
assist me 1 shall get them at my own ex
pense. Mr. Dunne has thrown every ob
stacle in my way and I ask the permis
sion of this jury to conduct this proceed
ing myself hereafter. I shall examine all
of the witnesses that may come and go
without his assistance in the future."
After a good bit of parley consent was
given and Mr. Dunne will not again be
asked to subpena witnesses who do not
turn up nor ask questions that bring no
results.
After some further discussion along the
same line, Chairman McKee agTeed to
the plan, and the body went before Judge
Belcher to renounce its intention of ad
journing, and notified him that it would
meet again on Monday afternoon; to all
of which the Judge gave his ready con
sent.
