THE BATTLE-SHIP OREGON AND HER CONSORT, THE MARIETTA, PASSING THROUGH STRAITS OF MAGELLAN.
MAY CHANGE TO
A DECLARATION
OF WAR TO-DAY
It Is Not Believed by Anybody at
Washington Now That the
Peace Can Be Kept.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â There was much quiet talk
on both sides of the Senate chamber to-night in favor of
substituting a declaration of war for both the majority and
minority reports. It is thought by some that this would
unite 'he different factions.
NEW YORK. April 15.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: Another day's delay in Con
gress, but one day nearer war.
Peace is no longer regarded as
a possibility.
The entire army is under marching
orders to-night. The navy is only
waiting for the final word to move.
Congress is expected to-morrow to take
the first steps to provide for calling out
from 60,000 to 100,000 volunteers. Chair
man Dingley is preparing a bill for war
taxes. In the face of all these warlike
preparations everybody has ceased to
talk about the possibility of peace.
The question of the hour is, When
will war begin and how long will it
lastP
Congress is still a factor in the mat
ter. Final action is expected by the
Senate to-morrow. This does not ne
cessarily mean that the intervention
resolution will go to the President for
his signature to-morrow. Everything
depends upon the vote which will be
taken on the pending House resolution.
If this should prevail the President will
have the authority for forcible interven
tion which he requested in his message
to-morrow night.
It is the opinion of Senator Spooner,
who made a masterly speech in the
Senate to-day in support of the House
resolution, that the Senate will adopt
the resolution reported by the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations,
either in its present original form or
with an amendment declaring directly
in favor of the recognition of the pres
ent so-called republic of Cuba, and that
this will cause a deadlock between the
two houses which may last for several
days.
Senator Foraker also insists that the
final vote of the Senate will show a
safe majority in favor of the recogni
tion of independence. A canvaÃS of the
Senate late this afternoon bears out this
prediction of Senator Foraker, but an
other day's debate may result in a \ ic
tory for the Senate Committee on For
eign Relations.
All the leaders agree that Congres
sional action cannot be staved off many
days longer. The effort* of the Demo
crats to make a purely party question
of the Cuban matter by favoring the
recognition of the present government
complicated the situation somewhat, but
the Republican leaders in both houses
of Congress are exerting every effort
to keep their party in line with the
President's recommendations.
I learned definitely to-night that
if a resolution is sent to the Presi
dent containing a declaration for the
recognition of the present so-called
republic of Cuba he will not veto it.
He will hold, however, that the re
cognition of the republic is an execu
tive function and that he must exer
cise his own judgment as to when
and under what circumstances it is
to be accorded.
Administration authorities are very
sanguine to-night that the House reso
lution will finally prevail. If it does the
President will be prepared to act

GEN. MILES
TALKING
BUSINESS.
NEW YORK, April 15.â The
Washington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: Major Gen
eral Miles, liscusslng the situa
tion, said to me to-night: "The
orders Issued to-day do not con
template a mere military demon
stration or stage play for the
benefit of Spain. We are engaged
In grave and serious business.
The army will be efficiently or
ganized that it may acquit itself
â with honor in the carrying out of
the administration plans for In
tervention In Cuba as they may
be expressed by the formal action
of Congress and by the approval
of the President.
"Our plans of campaign are, for
obvious reasons, not subjects for
discussion. I "have no hesitation
in eaylng, however, that we shall
be prepared to cross the gulf for
active military operations In
Cuba in conjunction with the In
surgents' army when the navy
shall have cleared the way for
the effective landing of United
States troops on Cuban shores."
preparation has been made in anticipa
tion of this result.
It was formally announced at the
Spanish legation this afternoon that
the American public was being
grievously fooled by the assumption
that Spain would under any circum
stances voluntarily relinquish sov
ereignty over the island of Cuba.
This statement, coupled with the
early assembling of the Spanish Cortes
for the purpose of preparing for war,
has convinced everybody here that the
real crisis is now at hand.
A naval demonstration by the
United States is certain to come, and in
all probability within the next ten days.
What will happen after this demonstra
tion is made no living man can tell.
The representatives of the great
European powers agree that nothing
further can be done to prevent the
United States carrying out its plan
of intervention.
Archbishop Ireland, who has been
here for some time past carrying out
the instructions of the Pope in the in
terests of peace, left Washington to
night thoroughly convinced that media
tion is now out of the question, at least
until after the United States has made a
demonstration in Havana harbor.
Will Meet This Morning.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â The House
Committee on Foreign Affairs will meet
at 10:30 o'clock to-morrow morning to
determine the action on the Senate
resolutions when sent over from the
Senate.

QUEEN REGENT
PREFERS WAR TO
HUMILIATION
While Don Carlos Threatens Re
volt if Spain Does Not Reply
With Arms to America.
MADRID, April 15. â The action taken by the Spanish Cabinet to-day has
confirmed the general belief which has been prevalent here since yesterday,
that war is now inevitable. The warlike tone of the official note issued by
the Spanish Government finds general approval here and creates much ex
citement. t
Contrary to the general opinion that the Queen Regent has been nego
tiating for peace at any price, her attitude to-day had much to do with the
firm action of the Cabinet. It is learned on unquestionable authority that the
Queen Regent recently mado the following statement:
" I prefer even the horrors of war rather than tarnish on the prestige
of the army or to impair the rights of the crown."
Another factor, undoubtedly, is Don Carlos' manifesto of yesterday, of
which the following is an extract, which was not risked submitting to the
censor:
"The Governors of Madrid may make a call to arms inevitable, and
I may if they continue to permit the Spanish standard to be dragged in
the mud. Twenty years of patriotic retirement have proved that lam
neither ambitious nor a conspirator. The greater and better part of my
life as a man has been spent in the difficult task of restraining my
natural impulses and those of my enthusiastic Carlists, whose eagerness
I was the first to appreciate, but which, nevertheless, I curbed, although
it rent my heart to do so. To-day national honor speaks louder than
anything, and the same patriotic duty which formerly bade me say,
'Wait yet a while,' may leave me to cry, commanding the Carlists, 'Car
lists, forward,' and not only the Carlists, but all Spaniards, especially to
the two national forces who still bravely withstand the enervating femini
nities of the regency, the people and the army.
"If the glove which Washington has flung in the face of Spain is
picked up by Madrid I will continue the same example of abnegation as
before, with the exception that I cannot partake in the slightest, other
than by prayers and by the influence of my name."
Continuing, Don Carlos, in his manifesto, says: "I will applaud from
my soul those who have the good fortune to face the fire, and I shall
consider those Carlists as serving my cause who embark in war with the
United States. But if everything leads me to fear that the polioy of
humiliation will again prevail we will snatch the reins of Government
from those who are unworthy to hold them and we will occupy their places."
The report that Spain had purchased the Hamburg-American liners
Normannia and Columbia was confirmed to-night. It is said that the
Minister for the Colonies, Senor Moret, bought them without consulting
Admiral Bermejo, the Minister of Marine.
As indicated to-night in the Hera/do, Spain is figuring on yellow
fever being an important factor of the Cuban situation. It says: "We
have 200,000 troops on the is/and, perfectly acclimatized, and any Ameri
cans who are landed there will die like flies."
FLYING SQUADRON HAD
A SUCCESSFUL DRILL
Beturns to Fort Monroe After Prac
tice Maneuvers That Were
Very Satisfactory.
FORT MONROE, Va., April 15.â The
flying squadron, the departure of which
caused so much excitement on Wednes
day, returned to-day to anchorage at
Fort Monroe, after having completed
two days and two nights of arduous
labor with satisfaction to its com
manding officer. Commodore Schley
wanted the captains of the fleet to
know each other in the movement of
their vessels and to be able to answer
quickly to all signals for movements
liable to be made in an engagement.
Running down to Cape Henry on
Wednesday afternoon the squadron
was taken fifteen miles out to sea, at
the same time maneuvering in response
to the signals from the flagship.
All of the big vessels responded
quickly, the heavy battleships Massa
chusetts and Texas being especially
quick. Line of battle was formed, with
the Brooklyn on the right, the Massa
chusetts to the left of the Brooklyn,
the Minneapolis io the left of the Mas
sachusetts, the Columbia next and the
Texas on the extreme left.
The signal to anchor in line was
obeyed so well that an almost perfect
alignment was obtained. Anchorage
was made on Wednesday night fifteen
miles east of Cape Charles light, near
the Southern drill grounds.
FOLGER IN COMMAND
OF THE_NEW ORLEANS.
New Cruiser Will Be Assigned to
the Flying Squadron at
Once.
NEW YORK, Aprn 15.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: No time has
been lost by the Navy Department in
preparing to use the new cruiser New
Orleans, which arrived in New York har
bor last night. Orders were issued to-day
detailing officers to command her. Ar
rangements are being made to complete
the complement of men for both her and
the San Francisco. Captain \V. M. Folger
who is now in charge of the Third Light
house District, has been assigned to the
command of the new cruiser, with Lieu
tenant-Commander Osborn as executive
officer. f
Both the New Orleans and the San
Francisco will be assigned to the flying
squadron. No determination has been
reached as to Commodore Howell's duty,
but he probably will come to Washington
to discuss the matter with the depart
ment.

Hostile Tone Taken at Madrid Has Caused the
Administration to Reveal Its Position in
Open Preparation for the War
Now Inevitable,
NEW YORK, April 15.â The concentration of regular forces, says the
Herald's Washington correspondent, will be followed immediately by a
call of the President for volunteer troops for foreign service. The first
call will be for from 50,000 to 100,000 volunteers.
In order to obviate all possible causes of delay in response to calls
on account of differences of legal opinion with regard to the powers of
the President to enlist the National Guard for such service, it is expected
that a bill will be introduced in the House to-morrow by Representative
Howell authorizing the President to accept the enlistment of at least
100,000 volunteers, and that this bill will be pushed to a speedy passage
through the House and Senate.
As soon as the President has received from Congress this authority
to call for volunteers, he will make the requisitions upon the Governors
of every State in the Union to furnish their quota of volunteers in propor
tion to their population.
Everything goes â General Shaf
ter and his staff. Colonel Evan
Miles and the First Infantry, the
band, the two light batteries of
the Third Artillery, the battery
horses, the mules, escort wagons,
ambulances and the complete outfit
for field service.
At the Presidio and department
headquarters yesterday morning
there was premonition of a change.
No orders were received by wire
until late in the afternoon, but
there was something in the at
mosphere that made the troops
feel that the time for activity had
arrived. The newspaper bulletins
gave the men the first intelligence
that the War Department had or
dered a concentration of the troops
at New Orleans, Chattanooga,
Mobile and Tampa. Presently the
official intelligence was communi
cated to department headquarters.
Telegrams followed thick and fast.
The haste manifested at head
quarters to impart the news to
others and make ready to start
was soon announced at the Pre
sidio. Officers went at once to
post headquarters and the Pre
sidio Club to obtain official con
firmation of the news.
Great surprise was expressed
when it was learned that the
official orders commanded the light
artillery as well as the First In
fantry to take the field. Troopers
of the Fourth Cavalry were dis
appointed. Hearing that others
were going to the front they
wanted orders themselves to join
the advancing column.
The news soon extended to the
Post Exchange and the brick bar
racks. The command to move
had not then been given to the
enlisted, but they began to pack
up the few remaining traps up
packed, and within an hour the
soldiers were ready to fall in and
march to the boat.
General Shafter left on the 4:30
MOBILIZING THE ARMY
ON THE GULF COAST
WASHINGTON, April 15. â Decidedly the most warlike step in
preparing for the possibility of an encounter wiih Spain was taken
to-day when orders were issued for the concentration at four points
in the South of six regiments of cavalry, twenty-two regiments of
infantry and the light batteries of five regiments of artillery. At
Chickamauga there will be six regiments of cavalry and the light
batteries of five regiments of artillery; at New Orleans eight regi
ments of infantry; at lampa seven regiments of infantry, and at
Mobile seven regiments of infantry.
Since the civil war no such proportion of the army has been
mobilized and the movement itself is the best evidence of the grav
ity of the situation as looked upon by the President and his ad
visers. The determination to rendezvous the troops in the South,
where they can be acclimatized to the conditions of a more tropical
climate, has been under consideration by the President and his cab
inet for some time. It was not until to-day, however, that the Pres
ident, in view of the enormous expense which will be entailed, felt
justified in taking this step.
When Secretary Alger returned from the cabinet meeting he
at once called into conference General Miles and Adjutant-General
Corbin and acquainted them with the result of the cabinet's delib
erations. There were hurried consultations in which the quarter
master-general, who has charge of the transportation of the troops,
the commissary-general, who looks after their subsistence, and rep
resentatives in Washington of various railroads running to the
South, participated. The orders as finally given contemplate the
movement of troops to the places indicated as follows:
To Chickamauga battlefield â The First, Second, Third, Sixth,
Ninth and Tenth Regiments of Cavalry and the light batteries of
five regiments of artillery.
To New Orleansâ The First, Seventh, Eighth, Twelfth, Six
teenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Regiments of
Infantry.
To Mobile â The Second, Third, Tenth, Eleventh, Nineteenth,
Twentieth and Twenty-second Regiments of Infantry.
To Tampa â The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Thirteenth, Seven
teenth and Twenty-first Regiments of Infantry.
The heavy batteries of artillery in each of the five regiments
mentioned will remain at their present posts.

AT JAMAICA
England Notifies Its Colonies to
Observe Strict Neutrality in
the Event of War.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, April 15. â In order to learn just what the Uni
ted States might expect from Great Britain in the matter of coaling her
w .;rships hero. Consul Dent, under orders from Washington, recently
put the question to the Colonial Government.
1 am informed by a high official here that the local government re
fused t" give a definite answer as to its neutrality in the event of war
n United States and Spain until it had been advised from Lon
don. Mr. Dent pressed the point strongly and obtained assurance that
the matter would be submitted to the Home Foreign Office.
This was done, and to-day the Colonial Government was instructed
by Mr. J"H''ph Chamberlain, Secretary erf State for the Colonies, to
strictly observe neutrality in case of of war. Coal is declared contra
band of war. No combatant ship, lam informed, will be allowed to
leave Jamaican ports within twenty-four hours of the departure of a
warship of the enemy. Further, the instructions to the Colcmlal Gov
ernment are to the effect that the strictest neutrality be enforced.
The Cuban Junta here recently made an offer looking to a charter
for the steamship Delta of Halifax. It was the intention of the Junta
to send the steamer to Santiago de Cuba to take off Cubans, who de
clare they are in great peril. At the last moment it was femnd that the
Delta was not large enough to accomodate all those who wished to
leave, and the Junta here cabled to the Junta in New York to see if ar
rangements could be made there.
the bids are considered and a con
tract awarded what route the First
Infantry will take to New Orleans,
or by what line the artillerymen
will go to Chattanooga.
As the 3.2-inch breech-loading
field guns, caissons, ammunition,
horses and complete equipment of
wagons go with the artillery, and
as the infantry takes along every
thing required for active field
service several special trains will
be required to transport the troops
and baggage to the respective
points of destination.

Major Smith's battalion of two com
panies of the First 5 Infantry, stationed
at Benicia Barracks, will be taken to
the Presidio Sunday so they can leave
Fan Francisco for New Orleans next
Monday evening with the regiment to
which they belong. The Government
Steamer General McDowell will go to
Benitia Sunday to bring the troops
down. At least, that was the arrange
ment made by General Shafter and
Colonel Miles a few minutes before
the general left the city for Bakers
field yesterday.
In the light of subsequent events the
troops may be ordered to remain at
Benicia Barracks until the main col
umn reaches Port Costa.
Immediately after the news came
from Washington yesterday that the
First Infantry had been ordered to New
Orleans, Colonel Miles relieved several
officers from special duty at the Pre
sidio to enable them to go with their
respective organizations. Lieutenant
: Roudiez was relieved of his duty as
post commissary, librarian and officer
:in charge of the Post Exchange. Lieu
tenant Boyd was appointed recruiting
I officer. Dr. Ireland post librarian and
! treasurer, and Lieutenant J. D. Nolan
, as officer in charge of the Post Ex

; relieved of duty as recruitire: officer.
Desertions uf Charles H. Crutch
field, Company G, and Edward F. Cal
lahan and Jacob Cupp, of Company C,.
were announced on the bulletin at post
headquarters yesterday.
Colonel James M. Moore, assistant
; quartermaster-general, U. S. A., has re- !
ceived telegraphic instructions from
Washington to arrange for the ship
ment of 40,000 pounds of po-wder from
Santa Cruz to the East. The powder
will leave for Eastern points to-day.
The board appointed to formulate a
'. system of fire control for San Fran
: Cisco harbor was in session all day at
department headquarters, in the office
'of the inspector of artillery. To-day
the board will go over to Lime Point
(Fort Baker) for the purpose of mak
ing an Inspection at that place and ob- '
; taining information necessary for fu
! ture work.
The First Infantry was organized un- ;
; der an act of Congress dated March 3,
ISI6, and assigned to duty in the di
vision of the South. Brevet Brigadier
i General Daniel Bissell was its first
colonel; Lieutenant-Colonel George t
Croghan, who afterward became the !
inspector general of the army, was '
made the lieutenant-colonel, and Brevet
Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas K. Jessup,
who was afterward quartermaster-gen
era! of the army, was the major.
The headquarters of the First were
established at Baton Rouge. La., and
i remained in Louisiana until 1828, when
| the regiment relieved the Fifth at Fort i
i Crawford, Fort Snelling and Fort
Armstrong, in Minnestota and Illinois, i
Some of the companies participated in
1 the Black Hawk War of 1X32, under
Colonel Zachary Taylor, who was then
colonel of the regiment.
The First moved to Florida in 1837,
and with the exception of Company C
was present at the battle of Okeechobee
with Seminole Indians, Christmas day,
1837. On this occasion Colonel Taylor
commanded the entire force engaged
and was brevetted brigadier-general for :
distinguished services in the battle. On
the 15th of May, 1838, Colonel Taylor
was put in command of the army of i
I Florida.
Early in the summer of 1841 the First
returned to Its old station in the
Northwest. Headquarters were moved
to Jefferson Barracks. Mo., in 1845. and
the regiment garrisoned that station
and Fort Scott, lie.
During the Mexican "War a part of
the First joined their old commander.
General Zachary Taylor, in Northern
Mexico, and did gallant service at the
capture of Monterey and siege of Vera
Cruz, and afterward garrisoned the
City of Castle, where it remained until
the end of the war.
In 1850 the First was stationed along
the line of the Rio Grande, where it re
mained for many years protecting the
settlers from the invasion of Indians,
protecting their property and stock.
When the Civil War came part of the
First were in Texas and part in the In
dian Territory. The Texas companies,
with the exception of Company G,
which went to Washington and formed
a part of the city guard of that city,
and was afterward attached to the Sec
ond Infantry in the Army of the Poto
mac until after January 31, 1863, joined
the other companies of the regiment at
Fort Leavenworth. These latter com
panies participated in the battle of Wil
son Creek, Mo., sieges of New Madrid.
Corinth and Vicksburg. In the summer
of 1863 the First went to New Orleans,
where it became the provost guard.
. At the close of the war the First went
to Jackson Barracks, where it remain
ed till 1869, actively engaged In the stir
ring events of early reconstruction, in
which it rendered efficient service.
In the early spring of 1869 it was
transferred to the Department of the
Lakes, and In July, 1874, the regiment
was transferred to the Department of
the Dakota, where it remained till June,
1880, when it was sent to the Depart
ment of Texas. Lieutenant Colonel
William R. Shafter was promoted col
onel of the First Infantry March 4,
1879, and served as its colonel for over
eighteen years, to May 3, 1897, when he
was promoted brigadier general.
The Indian outbreak in Arizona in
the spring of 1882 caused the regiment
to be sent to the Department of Arizo
na, where it remained until July, ISB6,
when the regiment was transferred to
the Department of California, In which
department the regiment has been sta
tioned for the past twelve years.
In order to fill the vacancies in the
artillery branch of the army occasion
i Â«d by the creation of the new artillery
regiments, thirteen additional second
lieutenants of Infantry and cavalry who
were graduated from last year's" class
at West Point have been transferred
to the artillery. This transfer â¢will cre

been detailed to arrest them. 'As soon as
war seemed imminent, 1 paid one of the
soldiery, *a lot of men disappeared. They

The soldiers at the Presidio are indig

In the imagination of a sensational nuws

The statement that "during; thp past i

thirty men have deserted from the Pre- :
sidio in the last three and a half months.
! 'i he percentage of desertions at the Pre- j
i sidio is very small, considering that al
most 1000 enlisted men garrison the post
: and the recent gold excitement in Alaska.
Up to the Sth inst. we had no idea that ,
â  we would be called into active service in j
| the East; consequently a motive of cow- j
; axdice can only be applied to the two de- j
, scrtions that have taken place since that |
: date; and it is believed that one of the ;
â¢ deserters will turn up in a day or two. j
All we ask is that we soldiers be given
our just dues. KM.[.ST_J MAN.
I Presidio. Cal., April 15. IS9B.
The first pronounced outward display
1 of patriotic spirit made Itself manifest '
lon the streets yesterday afternoon, ;
shortly after it had been announced ;
that the-regular army had been ordered
to the front. It was in the shape of
two small American silk flags worn on I
the lapel of the coat, and was seen on
hundreds of lapels.
The officers are permitted to leave
their families at the Presidio, retaining*
the houses which they row occupy.
There is no change of station in the
sense that dtlv r troops will come in to
; occupy the quarters. National Guards
men will in all probability be assigned
to duty at the garrison, but the officers
of the State organizations will not oc- I
eupy the dwelling houses at the post. I
The United States troops under orders j
to leave are simply going to the field |
for active service. Household goods !
and furniture need not be disturbed, j
Many of the families will remain here
eagerly awaiting the tidings from the
front.
The departure of the light batteries
and the infantry will not leave the
city without defenders. There still re
main Colonel Morris' superb squadron
of four troops of the Fourth Cavalry,
and no better riders and no abler

HAWAII NOT
TO BE SEIZED
Denial of a Report That
Is Being Designedly
Circulated.
No Strategic Advantages Could
Be Derived by Possession
of the Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 15,
The report co industriously circulated
by designing persons that this country
would seize the Hawaiian Islands in
case of war and hoist the flag regard
less of Congress is utterly without
foundation. It can be positively stated
that the administration has no such
design, and if it should attempt to do
this pending ratification of the treaty
of annexation now before the Senate
it would be strongly resented by Con
gress.
The administration would be injured
if it dared to take advantage of the
present emergency to override the
wishes of the American people who are
bitterly opposed to annexation.
Besides no strategic advantages
would accure from the seizure, since all
our ships which would threaten the Phil
ippine Islands are in Chinese waters,
and could not be aided by our posses
sion of the Hawaiian Islands. It is a
canard issued to subserve somÂ£ sinister
purposes.
Further, the arbitrary seizure of these
â¢islands would prejudice the United
States Government in the eyes of the
world and is not to be thought of at
this time. The administration is too
wise to do such a foolish and lawless
thing.
WAITING FOR A
CALL TO ARMS
Guardsmen Preparing to
Promptly Report for
Active Duty.
The First Infantry May Not Be
the One to Go to the
Presidio.
Oeneral Barrett Expects a Call by
Mondayâ Warfield Says His
Men Are Ready.
When will it come? How will it
come' Where will we go? '
There is more speculation over those
three questions among the rank and
file of the National Guard just now
than over anything that has happened
since '61. it seems to be an accepted
proposition that there will be war, and,
the only doubtful part of it is, "When
will the order come?"
None, even the highest officers, seem
to know just what the Government will
do; it is only known that the guard
has been ordered to be in readiness, but
for what and for when no one can
fathom. The men of the guard are no
longer play soldiers, even in the eyes of
those who loved the term; they are
drilling conscientiously and with a view
to immediate preparation for action,
and when the call comes full ranks and
well-equipped companies will be on
hund at once.
It is the general impression that the
first militia organization to take up
arms in this jtate will be the naval
reserves. It was reported at th*e drill
on board the Marion last night that ~~.
New York reserves had already been
ordered out and the expectation that
the California organization will follow
almost immedia,tely is gaining in
strength. The California reserves, when
recruited up to the full number, can
put 750 men on board the Government
vessels, many of them well trained and
all properly equipped for service at sea
or service on shore. It is one of the
largest and finest organizations of its
kind in this country, and the enthu
siasm of its ranks is shown by the let
ters that come in from all over the
coast from ex-members, asking to be
taken back under any circumstances as
soon as war shall be declared.
The suspicion is growing that it will
not be the First Infantry of this city
which will be ordered to the Presidio.
The going of the First United States
Infantry will necessitate the garrison
ing of the Presidio with some National
Guard Kegiment, and indications now
point to the fact that it will be the
Fifth Infantry. The Fifth is a regiment
of fight companies anfl includes com
panies in towns and counties about the
bay and outside of San Francisco, Col
onel Fairbanks, its commander, is
senior colonel of the Second Brigade,
and as such he is entitled to first call
for service. Even if this were not the
case, however, it is probable that the
orders would be the same, as there is
a theory, yearly growing stronger, that
militia is of greater use in proportion
to the distance it is taken from home.
Should the Fifth and not the First go
to the Presidio, there is plenty of work
left for the reglmont remaining. It
will be assigned to duty at the Santa
Cruz powder works, which just now is
a thing to be taken care of, and there
is also the arsenal at Benicia wnich
must be garrisoned strongly, for the
companies of regulars which have been
there will be moved out by Monday and
there must be some troops to take and
hold the place.
Word has also come from Marysville
that some one has definite and relia
ble information that the Second Infan
try, located in Chico, Colusa, Nevada
City, Marysville, Redding, Woodland,
Grass Valley and Sacramento, had been
nmined to expect a call for service as
coast guards or as a reserve force
within three days. This is no more
than the local regiment has learned,
however, and the other regiments may
hear the same thing before the three
days are up.
Adjutant-General Barrett arrived in
this city from Sacramento last evening,
and is registered at the California. To
a Call reporter, General Barrett admit
ted that while the object of his visit
was to attend to personal business, he
expected to have a conference with
General Shafter this morning in regard
to the summoning of the National
Guard for active service.
"Up to the time I left Sacramento,"
said General Barrett, "no orders had
been received calling on the State
troops, and I do not look for any before
Monday, but they may come at any
moment.
"If they do they will be responded to
immediately by the entire National
Guard, including the naval battalion,
for orders were issued several days ago
to all the commands to hold themselves
in readiness and the members will ans
wer the first call in short order.
"If any call came from Washington
it would be sent to the Governor, who
would immediately transmit it to my
office, but nothing of the kind had been
received up to 2 o'clock to-day."
General Barrett had not heard any
thing about the troops at the Presidio
having received marching orders, but
said that even if they were ordered
East at once, the probabilities are that
the State troops would not be called
upon until Congress had taken definite
action, and he did not see how that
could be done much before Monday.
"If anybody has a doubt that the
American people are terribly in earn
est in this matter," said General Bar
rett, "he should visit my office and see
tl\e hundreds of tenders of services
that are received daily from all classes
of people. Only yesterday a man about
38 years old, a graduate of West Point,
came to Sacramento from Woodland
and offered himself for enlistment in
I the event of war. He said he was ready
to serve in any capacity from carrying
a musket up. His father was a brig
adier general in the regular service.
This is only a specimen of the men who
are daily seeking to enlist."
General Warfield felt last night as if
war must come. He said he was sim
ply awaiting orders, and that the feel
ing of the militiamen was that they
were ready to obey orders and would be
glad to serve the ccountry when it
calls.
Speaking of equipments and general
chances to get ready to go on short no
tice, he said: "So far as I understand
I the situation, we could have the maxi
< mum number of men ready to go, under
i emergency orders, in from twenty
four to thirty-six hours. We are a lit
tle short on some minor equipments,
\ but that matter would soon be supplied
by the United States. As soon as we
; report to the regular army quartermas
ter he would be able to supply at least
15,000 men with all they need. I have
not yet received any orders from head
! quarters, though I expect to be no
j tified any moment to be in readiness."
Wade Must Serve Time.
SAN JOSE, April 15.â Steve Wade, who
wronped Zelpha Scott and was sentenced
to pay a fine of $3000 or serve 750 days in
tne State prison, will have to serve the
term m San Quentin, as he Is unable to
pay his fine. He w+tt be taken to that
prison to-morrow morning.
WAR FUND TO
BE RAISED BY
POPULAR LOAN
Every American Citizer) Will Have
an Opportunity to Buy Gov
ernment Bonds at Par.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â The number of bondholders in the
United States is likely to be increased very soon. In case a war loan
becomes necessary the people will be given the widest opportunity to
subscribe. While Congress has not yet placed upon the statute books
any act authorizing an issue of bonds in any form, it is known that the
plans are to make the proposed bond issue a "popular loan' in the
widest and fullest sense of the term.
"Congress has, of course, given us no authority in the matter of
a war loan," said Assistant Secretary Vander, talking upon this sub
ject, "but you can safely say that the intention everywhere is, in case
a loan becomes necessary, to give the greatest possible facility for the
masses to become holders of these bonds. The bonds will presumably be
in sums of fifty dollars and multiples, and will be available to any
and all who may choose to send checks, drafts, money orders or any
other device for transmitting money, or who may prefer to deposit the
money with their banker or a sub-treasurer in their vicinity. The
bonds undoubtedly will be offered at par in sizes and quantities to suit
all bidders, and every citizen who desires to assist the Government in
raising money or who desires to invest his money and become a bond
holder will have full opportunity."
"But suppose the subscriptions exceed the amount of bonds of
fered?"
"Then the small bidders will have the first preference. Our desire
â and in this I am sure that everybody in authority joins â Is that bids
of $1000 and under shall be given the preference in the distribution of
the bonds, and that if it is necessary to scale down the bids that pro
cess will be resorted to only in the larger bids. We desire to give
every citizen the greatest possible opportunity to subscribe to any bonds
which it may become necessary to issue, and especially to those who
desire to subscribe in small sums, thus making the issue in the broad
est sense a popular loan."
BAILEY GOES
AFTER REED
The Arraignment of the
Speaker by the Demo
cratic Leader.
The Texan Accuses the Chair of
Being Unfair and Unjust
to the Minority.
The Presiding Officer of the House
Replies Qu.ie:ly and Creates
Considerable Laughter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 15.
Only a single incident in the session
of the House to-day was worthy of
public notice. Bailey, the Democratic
leader, arose to a question of privilege
to reply to a Philadelphia newspaper
criticism charging him with responsi
bility for the disorderly scene in the
House on Wednesday. Bailey said that
a public man v seldom justified in re
plying to criticism, but in this case he
could not, in justice to himself, allow
such a statement to pass without re
ply. He affirmed that if there was any
individual responsible for the scene it
must rest upon the Speaker himself.
He read from the Congressional Record
the report of the colloquy to sustain
his position. As he proceeded with his
arraignment of the Speaker there were
manifestations of suppressed excite
ment on the floor. The Speaker listened
with imperturbable count lance. Bai
ley said:
"Constrained by what I considered
the unfair and unjust treatment of the
chair, I objected and upon that objec
tion arose the scene of the disorder
that is regretted by every member of
this House. But for the results which
followed it the responsibility is upon
the Speaker of this House who sought
a mean, partisan advantage by forcing
his political opponents into a false po
sition. (Applause on the Democratic
side.) And the country ought to know
it. I understand the Speaker of the
House â "
"Is this an arraignment of the Speak
er, or a question of personal privilege?"
interposed Steele (R.) of Indiana.
"The chair does not know, but will
probably soon learn," observed the
Speaker, blandly.
"It is the daily airing the gentleman
gives himself," ejaculated Dalzell (R.)
of Pennsylvania.
"I did not understand the oracular
statement of the gentleman," observed
Bailey.
"Well, then, I will repeat it,", said
Dalzell. "It is the daily airing the gen
tleman gives hii self."
"And that is only the daily falsehood
that men on that side are guilty of,"
retorted Bailey.
"The gentleman has demonstrated
what the papers alleged, that he has
lost his head," Dalzell replied.
"The gentleman from Pennsylvania
says, because I class h!s ungentlemanly
interruption as it ought to be charac
terized, that I have lost my head," said
Bailey. "The truth of it is that he and
his associates imagine that men can be
assailed and called liars and that if
they resent they have lost their heads.
(Cries of "Ah" on the Republican side.)
I have not lost mine now and I did not
lose it then. That a man may lose his
temper under provocation, and under
very great provocation, is a very nat
ural thing; but men may still lose their
tempers and not lose their heads. But
if in order foT a man to preserve his
equanimity and appear cool he must
allow the insults to pass unanswered,
then I prefer to be classed with those
who lose their heads. I would infinitely
rather lose my head in resenting an in
sult than to lose my self-respect by
submitting to one. (Applause on the
Democratic side.) I did not expect a
man belonging to either party to cease
to be a partisan when he became
Speaker of this House, and the Speak
er, whenever occasion offers, exercises
his office for the advantage of his par
ty. I expect the present Speaker to do
it as certainly as any man who ever
occupied the chair, but until a short
while ago I believed that the present
Speaker of this House was as parti
san as an honest man could be and as
honest as a partisan could be; but after
the performances of last Wednesday I
would not be willing to father that
sentiment any longer. I have never
known on a great occasion any more
unfair advantage attempted, and even
if it had succeeded what little advan
tage there was would have passed from
my memory long before the recollection
of the Speaker's partisan action."
(Loud applause on the Democratic
side.)
When Bailey took his scat the Speak
er leaned forw ird slightly and jplied,
speaking slowly and distinctly:
"The chair desires to say that what
ever he has done, the other day, or any
day since the commencement of this
session, has been done in the presence
of the House and of a thousand wit
nesses. He does not feel that it is
necessary for him to discuss his con
duct. (Loud applause on the Repub
lican side.) The gentleman from Texas,
after two days of deliberation, has felt
that his situation demanded discus
sion and explan ition. (Laughter on the
Republican side.) With that idea the
chair entirely agrees. (Laughter.) It
is not the first time that the gentle
man from Texas has assailed me. To
it I have no reply except simply what
the House knew, that the gentleman
from New Yorl. (Qui. g) did mean
an objection really or technically, and
everybody in this House knows it. I
therefore, with reference to this whole
matter, appeal to the witnesses of the
transaction and upon their judgment
the chair rests his justification."
(Laughter an applause on the Repub
lican side.)
Bailey attempted to- reply, but the
regular order was demanded and the
incident closed.
READY WITH
MEN AND GOLD
Washington State Will
Meet All Demands of
the Nation.
Special Dispatch to The Call. '
SEATTLE, April 15.â Governor John
R. Rogers was interviewed to-night re
garding the attitude of Washington
State in the event of war. He said:
"The policy of the State administra
tion will be to go slowly, meeting all
the requirements of the law, and, if
the General Government calls for
troops, the State will gladly and cheer
fully furnish its full quota and will
assuredly bear its full share and part
in the conflict. The administration
will endeavor to uphold the proud
name borne by this young State
among the sister States of the repub
lic.
"The National Guard is in very good
shape â remarkably so considering the
limited appropriation* made for Its
maintenance by the last Legislature.
In all probability the General Govern
ment will designate a rendezvous at
Seattle and one at Spokane, where the
militia and volunteers could be as
sembled and mustered in wherever offi
cers were detailed for that purpose. I
am in receipt daily of applications for
enlistment by officers ana privates,
and judging from the tenders of ser
vice made there will be no difficulty in
supplying two or three times the num
ber for which we may be called upon.
"I have been requested to call an ex
tra session of the Legislature to appro
priate $200,000 for war purposes, fol
lowing the example of other States;
but these States are wealthy, while we
are poor and in debt, so you can see
the necessity of making the expendi
tures as small as possible. By this I
do not mean our efficiency will be im
paired, for all demands upon us will
be complied with to the utmost limit
War is expensive, but we will pay our
portion of the general expense in the
general way, and no extra session will
be necessary for that purpose. I will
not sanction loading a large amount
of taxes upon our taxpayers, but with
most efficient service will endeavor to
make the cost as light a 6 possible on
our already overburdened taxpayers "
A REGIMENT OF

They Will Fight Under the Stars and

The League of the Cross, 760 strong,

Colonel W. P. Sullivan, commander of

ernment, they will be fit to range up

PRESSURE OF
THE POWERS
It May Be Brought to
Bear Upon President
McKinley.
Europe Will Try to Prevent
Him Signing Intervention
Resolutions.
Spain Is Also Preparing Plans by
Which the Dons Hope to Secure
Sympathy Abroad.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 15.â A Washing
ton special to the Heralf 1 says: Eu
ropean intervention in the Cubar ques
tion will be largely determined by the
character of the action taken by Con
gress. This much is certain. Repre
sentatives of powers here are equally
certain that no further pressure will
be exerted upon Spain to secure addi
tional concessions. If pressure should
be determined upon by the powers It
will be brought to bear upon President
McKinley, and it will be employed with
a view to preventing him from approv
ing any resolution which contains a
recognition of independei.ee of Insur
gents, who, he declared in his message
to Congress, possessed none of the at
tributes of a sovereign people.
On the other hand, it is doubtful If
the great powers of Europe will unite
in another note to the President in case
a resolution such as suggested by Mr.
McKinley in his message or even that
passed by the House should be pre
sented to him for action. It is felt by
the members of the diplomatic corps
that the He use resolution while direct
ing interven.ion would not necessarily
precipitate war, because it mereiy "au
thorizes and empowers" the President
to employ the land and naval forces to
execute the purpose of the resolution.
The representatives of France, Aus
tria and Italy, the powers taking thÂ«
most interest in the matter, believe that
the President in urging Congress to
authorize the. taking of measures to
"secure in the island the establishment
of a stable government," thereby ex
pressed his willingness to permit Spain
to retain her flag in Cuba, and had no
Intention of annexing Cuba or of driv
ing a European power out of the Amer
ican continent.
In addition to the address which will
be delivered when the Cortes meets in
extraordinary session on Wednesday
next, Spain, it is expected in official
diplomatic circles here, will instruct her
Embassadors at the courts of Europe
to call attention to what she will term
the unjust imputation cast upon her by
the American Court of Inquiry and by
the President of the United States in
his message, and finally the terrible
accusation made by the Senate Com
mittee on Foreign Relations that she is
criminally responsible for the destruc
tion of the battle-ship Maine.
The result of such a note it is not diffi
cult to foresee. The representatives
of the gTeat powers believe that it will
more than ever arouse the sympathy
of Europe, to be followed or to be, per
haps, anticipated by prompt action
should the Congress of the United
States pass a resolution to grant the
insurgents a recognition of their inde
pendence.
Each of the European representatives
to-day transmitted to his Government
a copy of the report of the Senate
Committee on FoTeign Relations. While
there was no undue activity displayed
by any of the representatives to-day it
is known that they have been in com
munication, but nothing can be done
until instructions are received from
their respective Governments, upon the
advice transmitted as a result of the
conference yesterday, and which will
be sent as soon as the resolution of in
tervention passes Congress.

The Senate of the United States is
still In the throes of discussion of the
Hlspano-American crisis. While the
Senate talks the people of the country
â of the civilized worldâ await its ver
dict. That verdict will be returned in
accordance with an agreement reached
late to-night some time during the j
legislative day of to-morrow. That
legislative day may extend Into Sun- i
day.
â¢ After the debate had continued for !
eight hours to-day an effort was made |
to reach an agreement to begin the vote
upon all of the pending resolutions at
7 o'clock to-morrow evening and in the
confused colloquy among Senators
there was made manifest for the first
time a disposition to filibuster. Caf
fery of Louisiana, although disclaiming
any intention to delay action unduly, '
objected to any agreement to the fixing
of a time to vote.
The debate then proceeded, but in
a few minutes Wellington of Mary- ,
land entered a motion to adjourn. This ;
was defeated by the decisive vote of 61
to 10. The emphatic manner in which
the decision was reached indicated a I
determination on the part of those Sen
ators who desired immediate action to
endeavor to force the Senate to re
main in continuous session either until
the question was finally disposed of or
until an agreement had been reached
for a vote to be taken at some specific
time in the future to be measured by
hours.
At 8 o'clock to-night another effort
was made to reach an agreement to
adjourn, but, it. too, was unavailing.
The scene in the Senate this afternoon
as to the war of words that was being 1
waged was a memorable one. This
will pass into history as one of the :
great days of the Senate. Thronged ;
galleries looked down upon the half
circular chamber below.
There were assembled scores of men
who had written pages of American
history. With one exception . every
member of the Senate was there and
the exception, Walthall of Mississippi,
was confined to his bed, ill. Among the
distinguished audience were a hundred
cr more of the members of the House
of Representatives, Justices of the
Supreme Court, members of the Presi
dent's Cabinet and others prominent
in the life of the country.
It was an inspiringâ a historic scene,
and one rarely witnessed even in this ;
country of great and notable assem- j
blages The speeches were brilliant.
The debate, beginning at the unusually !

B *Despite the lowering clouds, which
threatened rain at any moment, and de-
BDite too, the unusually early hour of
convening, the Senate galleries were
thronged this morning when the \ ice-
Prenldent's gavel fell precisely at 10
o'clock. Indications before the Senate
convened were that the debate would be
prolonged, perhaps far into the night, as
It was the expressed intention of Chair
man Davis to enforce a continuous ses
sion until the pending resolutions were
disposed of. , ,
When the Senate adjourned last night
the Vice-President had before him a list
of twenty-three Senators who had ex
pressed their Intention to address the
Senate upon the momentous question be
fore it. Whether all of them will avail
themselves of the opportunity to talk
Is somewhat problematical, as a dozen or j
more have announced that they will not
stand In the way of an early vote.
At the suggestion of Davis the morning I
business was laid aside and the Senate
resolutions on Cuba were laid before the
B< ate. . Â
Cull' m of Illinois delivered a carefully
prepared speech covering the general Cu
ban question. After directing attention |
to his own record in the Senate upon the
Cuban matter, cullom declared that the
hour for action by this country was about
to strike. Step by step Spain had been
pushed away from the Western Hemi
sphere, and now she was about to lose
another, and the chief, gem of her co
lonial possessions. If Spain should be
permitted to pursue her course In Cuba
she would go on without remorse and
destroy, if possible, the patriots to the
last man. Her black crimes call aloud
for vengeance, and that vengeance will
be taken by the American people in the
Interests of humanity.
Cullom reviewed the circumstances of
the Maine disaster, and declared that it
was an act of "deliberate and atrocious
murder." The people throughout the
country were demanding that that crime
should be resented and that the avenging
blow should be struck without delay.
"And if Spain should resent our action,"
said the Senator, "we shall not hesitate
to take up the gantlet and to appeal to
the god of battles and to mankind to jus
tify our action. We now propose to do
our duty to God and man and to force
Spain to withdraw her forces and flag
from, the island." After making an ex
tended argument for immediate action, in
the course of which he paid a high tri
bute to President McKinley, Cullom con
cluded as follows:
"Thanks to the unwavering sense of
Justice of the people of the United States
the murderers and outlaws who now
make a brief show of authority will soon
become Incommunicado until justice shall
be satisfied and the avenging angel shall
write the verdict and sentence; and if the
people of this country shall do nothing
more in this century than drive these
barbarians Into the Caribbean Sea. we
shall earn the praises of every lover of
freedom and humanity the world over."
Berry of Arkansas was recognized im
mediately after the conclusion of Culom's
speech. He prefaced his remarks by stat
ing â  ! at as a Senator of the United States
he was present in his seat on the upper
floor of Congress to uphold .and support
the President of the United States in
his efforts to bring peace out of the chaos
now existing. He wanted to -vote for the
resolution offered by Turple, which prom
ises to recognise the Independence of the
present republic of Cuba. He thought
this was absolutely essential to place the
country on an honorable footing before
the nations of the world.
"You can vote the resolution down.
You may pass the resolution offered by
the majority of the Committee on For
eign Relations, or you may adopt the
House resolution, but whatever resolution
is adopted I will be found supporting the
hands of the President."
He spoke of the nearness of the war,
and said to bring victory to the American
arms it was absolutely necessary to give
the President aid and comfort, which was
needed In this hour of greatest trial, .ne
then, with an impassioned outburst,
pledged the South to loyalty to the flag.
While he would reserve his judgment until
the record had been made up of the valor
of the Southern soldiers, he believed that
record would be imperishable in the hla-
Tory of modern civilization, and at the
close of some glorious day, with the stare
and stripes (lying over the J ' lln ?, of
desolated Cuba, thÂ« valor of the Southern
soldier would stand side by sldo with the
valor of his Northern comrades.
There was applause In the pUleriea
upon the conclusion of Berry s speech,
which brought Cockerell of Missouri to
his feet with a protest against such a dis
play of commendation and v request tlmt
the Vice-President announce to the gal
leries that the Senate could not be turned
into a beer garden. Accordingly, tho pre
siding- officer Impressively informed the
Immense concourse of people present that
they would have to observe the dignity
of the Senate or the galleries would be
cleared.
Daniel of Virginia was next recognized.
His fame as an orator Is known, and
there was craning of necks on tho part
of the people in the galleries to listen to
the opening sentences which fell from the
lips of the distinguished Virginian. "We
stand upon the edge of war. This nation
Is one, with the sword in its hand, and
if tne word that now hesitates upon the
lips be spoken and the command 'For
ward!' be given, upon some proud day the
stars and stripes will be waving over
Morro Castle and Cabanas Prison.
He Bald he had been for peace, bur
that time appeared to have gone by. and
he wanted to do everything possible to
support the President In the "needs of the
hour.
"I wish," said Daniel, "to cast my vote
in my good time without pressure behind
me. "War will wait a day. Possess your
selves in peace, gentlemen, while the aw
ful issue of war or peace Is decided. The
men who declare this war are the men
who will prosecute it in the field. They
are not the men who will sustain the
gory and bullet-torn tatters of a flag.
They are not the men who will pay the
taxes imposed to carry on the war. Let
the Senate go on in its own measured
tread, amid no rancorous scenes. Wo
speak not as a party of men. but as men
who are to arm the executive of this
Government strongly and well to per
form a great duty as we see it."
Daniel said that he was content neither
with the House resolution nor with tho
Senate committee's resolution. "In my
judgment," said he, "oui first step
should be to write on the statute book
of the country a recognition of the Cuban
republic, which won a place among th
independent nations by its own valiant
sword."
Daniel went on to say that the inter
pretation he placed upon the recom
mendation of the President was that th
United States should lay hostile hand
both on Spaniards and Cubans to stop
the rebellion, instead of upholding the
insurgents In. their grand fight for 111)
ertv.
"I would hang my head in shame. . do
clared Gray. Impressively, "if I believed
to be true the susofcion which the Sena
tor from Virginia. harbors. I believe him
to be absolutely and eternally wrong."
"When the Senator Informs me." re
sponded Daniel, "that the President of
the United States does not have the de
sire to crush the Cubans under the gal
lant Gomez, I will say to him that it is
more than a suspicion.'
"I am not glad to hear this," replied
Gray, "because I do not believe there Is
a single man within the confines of this
broad country, except the Senator from
Virginia, who harbors in his heart BO
Lase a suspicion against the President of
the United States."
Daniel said that we were not speaking
Spanish in this body; that everybody had
to come out in the pure air and the sun
shine, and he made the direct charge
that the President had invoked the power
of Congress, the use of the army and
navy, to compel Gomez and his gallant
band of insurgents to lay down their
arms instead of driving Spain from the
i island.
"I believe," said he, "that the recogni
tion of the Cuban republic is necessary
at this juncture as a peace measure and
as a war measure."
Following the colloquy between Gray
| and Daniel concerning terms in the lat
ter's speech and concerning the meaning
of the; President's f message. Gray said:
"There Is one # ;truce â one armistice â
that I want, and that is a truce between
the present parties of this country until
we can settle our account with Spain."
(Prolonged applause.)
As Tillman of South Carolina arose to
address the Senate, there was a commo
tion in the galleries, and a wheeling about
of chairs of Senators on the floor. Till
man said he simply desired to express
hi.-; views upon the momentous question
now before the Senate, in his own way
and in his own time. Haste in such a
crisis he did not deem advisable.
"There is to be war in any event," he
declared, "unless Spain ignominiously
backs down: but the exigencies of the
situation are not so pressing but we may
have opportunity to say to the world
what we mean and to make clear our
position.
"Populists, L/emocrats and Republicans
are we".
'Bui we are all Americans to make
Cuba free.
"At least I hope we are," he continued,
i amid laughter. He said that the senti
ment for Cuban freedom pulsated in the
heart of every true American,' He dis-
I claimed any purpose to discuss the ques
tion from a partisan standpoint, but de
clared his intention to present the facts
as he viewed them to the people.
"I regret," he said, "that I cannot rise
to the high and pure plane which the
j Senator from Delaware (Gray) claims to
have' attained. I have suspicion in my
nature, and have learned that angels on
earth are few and far between. I am
satisfied that we seldom hear the flutter
of their wings In this chamber." (Laugh
ter.)
Discussing the criticisms which have
been made of the delay .in action by the
Senate.-. Tilman maintained that inas
much as the President had taken hist' own
good time to pass upon the question of
the hour, the responsibility . for delay
could not lie against the Senate, and he
appealed to his colleagues to proceed In
dignity and honor.
With a sharp voice Tillman said It was
the suspicion of double dealing that sur
rounded the message of the President,
and which needed the Senate to make the
cause of the war as clear as sunshine.
He said he wished to God he had no sus
| picion of dark dealings and midnight pioc-
I ting. He inquired why the President
wanted the House resolution passed In
stead of the Senate.
"We arc ev^n threatened with a ye
if we dare proclaim on the independ
ence of the island of Cuba," he declared
He made the direct charge that the
House and Senate had practically agreed
upon the form of a resolution to be pre
sented simultaneously to both bodies
pending the reception of the message,
and he called upon the members of the
Committee on Foreign Relations to deny
the truthfulness of that statement.
The Senator waited a moment for an
interruption, but It did not come.
"If the resolution as reported by a ma
jority of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations was adopted it would give the
President the right to determine who the
Cuban people were and thÂ« manner of
their government. â â¢â  â¢â -â _.
"Who is going to constitute the re
turning board? Who are going to count
the votes?" said the Senator in one of his
crescendo periods. He spoke feelingly of
the person of the President. He said he
believed -him to' be a good manâ a con
scientious citizenâ but he was surrounded
by men whom he; (Tillman) suspected to

THE SAN FBA^CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APKIL 16, 1898.
STRATEGIC MOVEMENTS OF THE OREGON.
Unusual Course Followed by the Battle-Ship in Order to Deceive
Spanish Naval Authorities.
"Where is the Oregon?" lfl a question now frequently asked. She left Callao, Peru, on the 9th lnÃt. to continue
her Journey south and around from the Pacific to the Atlantic. She was expected to call at Valparaiso, where her
smaller consort, the Marietta, arrived on the Bth, leaving again the second day after, and, though in due courae
Bhe should have been at that port some days ago, she has not yet put in an appearance.
It will be remembered that when the Oregon started Bouth the swift Temerario, one of the best torpedo-boats
in the Spanish navy whose captain is said to be a dare-devil, was lying at Montevideo. When the battle-ship left Cal
lao the Spaniard took on a full supply of coal and made ready for sea, and it was feared that It was his Purpose to
meet the American either in the Straits of Magellan or near the Atlantic entrance thereto, where he would be able
to give her a great deal of trouble, if not a fatal blow.
It seems however he will have no opportunity of doing so, for according to a naval authority who has studied
the situation and kept well up with the movements of both vessels, the big battle-ship must be now well into If not
has been fully alive to the situation. Instead of having the battle-ship touch at Valparaiso and
take on sufficient coal for the run to Montevideo or Buenos Ayres, he had her take on at Callao enough for the run
to <*andy Point a coaling station within the straits, and keep well away from Valparaiso on her run south. The
Marietta was sent into that port for news and then left to join the Oregon in the straits.
A good supply of coal is always carried at Sandy Point, which is a Chilean penal settlement, and the Oregon
can there get enough to take her on up to Rio or even Pernambuco without going near Montevideo and the Temer
ario There is no telegraph at any point of the trip from Valparaiso to the Rio Negro, just below Montevideo, so the
Oreeon would have no news later than the departure of the Marietta from Valparaiso, while the Temerario at Mon
tevideo could have it up to the day and knowing the time of the American's leaving Valparaiso and her average rate
of travel could well take her unawares when she chose. It is now more than probable that we will have within the
next few days news of the Oregon's safe arrival at Rio or some point higher up the coast.

demands Justice for the assassinswho sent
our brave sailors to an untimely death."
In marked contrast to the speech of
Tillman was the address of Wolcott of
Colorado, who followed. In opening Wol
cott said that it had not been his inten
tion to participate in the debate on the
resolutions under discussion till yester
day, when reflections upon the person of
the chief executive brought him to a
realizing sense that justice ought to be
! done the honored President in his hour
of great trial. Prefacing his discussion
of the question at issue, he stated that
ho would vote for the committtee resolu
i tion. He then characterized as almost
criminal the aspersions made by Sena-
I tors on the floor against the chief ex
1 ecu tive.
."The popular clamor patriotic in the
| extreme, has been unreasonable, and the
' condition of affairs as we find it today."
â  he said, "is largely due to a degraded
journalism, indulged in among those in
i nigh station, a journalism which sought
! to plunge the country into war in order
' to sell a few more copies of the newspa-
S er. Our beloved President, respected
y the people of th<- United States, has
smelled the smoke of battle, but in all
! he has shown Christian forbearance, the
i same which he has reflected in the
. handling of this most diplomatic of sub
i jects."
He regretted, he said, that diplomacy
had failed to bring order out of the chaos
existing. "We know not me finesse of
this diplomacy. We speak from our
! hearts in the open, and it is through us
that the President in his trying position
must be upheld."
He spoke of the two phases of the situ
' ation. the .condition in Cuba and the de
' struction of the Maine. If the two sub-
I jects had been separate, he continued, the
i necessity of war might have been avoid
â  ed If the awful barbarities in Cuba,
i which had aroused the pity of all man
' kind, had stood alone, there might have
been a solution of the problem.
For himself, he would have cared little
, what burden it entailed. He would have
1 been willing to mortgage every citizen,
:If only peace could be preserved. But
Spain refused to yield. And then. when,
added to that, came the awful explosion
in Havana harbor, the die was cast. Af
i ter that what could be said? "If even
i that catastrophe had stood alone, possi
bly war might have been averted. But
not by any methods Spain has thus far
pursued." he added, his voice ringing
â  dear as a bell. "From the day of the
explosion to this. Spain has done noth
ing except to make the most perfunctory
expressions of regret. She has made no
i attempt to exculpate herself or to re
' dress the wrong. If Spain freed Cuba
! to-day, we would have offered up 266
I American sailors on the altar of her
! freedom. War must come or Cuba must
Ibe free. No other answer will be ac
| cepted by our people. The honor of a
i nation must be inviolable. Defended,
i preserved, held sacred, a nation lives on.
The loss of It. the trading of it, the aban
i donment of it, makes ct nation die and
' perish from the earth. This is why, in
! this hour, good men. loving peace, see no
way under heaven how war can be avoid
ed ' It is fitting that we pledge ourselves
in advance before the nations of the
world that our hands are clean and our
cause just; that the war is a war in the
Interest of humanity, war for the suffer
ing and oppressed.
"Personally I regret that there cannot
be found in Cuba a government we can
recognize. I wish we could. For there
Is undeniable danger in these days of
syndicates and commercialism that men
who play upon human life as they do ou
loans and chattels for the advancement
of selfish interests will seek to glut their
greed here.
"In the eyes of every man in Europe
we must be free from ulterior motives,"
he went on, "if we are to preserve their
respect and our own. There is nothing
nobler at tne end of the nineteenth cen
tury than a nation erect and defiant
standing for human liberty. No concert
of Europe can choke our utterance or
turn us from our resolution. As a free
people wo can hear, but we must not
beed 1 <Jo not believe It. It is a poor
statement to follow 2000 years of the
teaching: of Christ. Spain has drained
her resources of men and money. If we
had sent a million of men and spent a
billion of money this country would he
as depleted as she is. And yet we are
asked to whet our appetite? for war upon
her. It would tie lik.' a man kicking a
cripple, fearing that the cr.itch might
hurt, and afterward asking for the plaud
its of the crowd. u<; have heard many
people say that the Spaniards are cow
ants. It is not true. From ihe days of
Alva and Pizarro to the days of Weyler
they have been brutal in their conduct,
but they have been courageous and brave,
and when we enter upon this war we do
not want to fool ourselves or the youth
of the land with the idea that we are to
meet cownrds or cowardice. This war
upon which we are entering; can bring us
no national gain. It will result in the loss
of m.. ilons to our commerce.
"It will sweep our ships from the sea
and we will leave thousands of our young
mf-n dead from fevers and disease in the
tropics. All this must be counted In ad

the day of Cuban freedom ha:< come, but
when we have achieved 'the victory, there
will be no territory to indemnify us for
our sacrifices, because we do not want
territory. There will be no money to in
demnify us because Spain is bankrupt.
We must find our supreme satisfaction for
our blood and treasure in relieving the cry
of suffering and the cause of humanity.
This war must be fought because, in the
eyes of the world, we stand as the senti
nel of liberty on the Western hemisphere,
and because if we fail to listen to the ;
voice of the suffering and downtrodden
w. will be untrue to the principles upon
which the Government is founded, as
A wave of applause swept over the gal
leries p.s Wolcott concluded, and thi3
(1. ni'mstration almost resulted in che
clearing of the galleries.
Cockrell (D.) of Missouri demanded
that this be done, but various Senators
on the floor interposed, among them Hoar
â  ( Massachusetts, who called attention to
the fact that the most flagrant violation
of ihe rule inhibiting such demonstrations
had been encouraged by the example of
S-iatnrs on the floor.
At this point Morgan of Alabama gave
notice that he would move to lay all
amendments on tne table.
As Spooner was recognized the scene
in the chamber was a notable one. The
wrong of auditors both in t..e galleries
and on the floor had greatly increased,
and among them were many of national
fame and prominence. Including members
of tne Supreme Courc.
In conclusion, speaking of the destruc
tion of the Maine, Spooner said: "That
there was Spanish complicity in the blow-
Ing up of the Maine, that Spain is respon
sible for that awful horror, that gigantic
murder, under our flag, no American
doubts ' and It would be in a righteous
cause that above our ships of war, when
they enter the harbor of Havana, the
signaled legend will float: 'Remember the
Maine! Remember the Maine:' "
I'pon the conclusion of Spooner's speech
Ixorman suggested an adjournment until
to-morrow morning, with an agreement
to vote at 7 o'clock to-morrow night.
\Â» eliington of Maryland moved to ad
journ, but the motion was defeated, 10â61.
Chilton of Texas secured th-Â» floor, only
to be interrupted by Hale of Maine, who
moved to adjourn.
White protested against the seeming
effort to rush the Senate to a vote. Hoar
protested against the tax which he be
lieved was to be placed upon the, health
and endurance of some or the Senators,
himself among others.
Hale however, withdrew his motion to
adjourn until Ohllton, securing the floor,
spoke until 8:30 p. m.
Teller of Colorado followed. He an
nounced at the outset that he would vote
for an amendment recognizing the inde
pendence of Cuba. It meant war. and
the step should be taken with the full
knowledge of that fact. He thought we
were fairly well prepared for hostilities.
and at this moment he congratulated
himself that he had always in the past
supported measures looking to the prop
er defense of the country to meet any
contingency. He also congratulated
himself that no act of his had contrib
uted to the dire calamity that we faced,
and that he had by no act of his em
barrassed or sought to embarrass the ex
ecutive He believed the Maine was
blown up by Spanish agencies. Before
that occurrence he had not believed that
war was necessary. If the executive had
recognized the belligerency of the Cuban
Insurgents our present position would
have been avoided. The President, in his
message, admitted that the war had ex
isted for three years. If the present ex
ecutive or his predecessor had said that
before the Maine was destroyed, war,
with all its horrors, would have been
averted.
War was an awful thing to contem
plate. No one could tell what would han
pen to our battle-ships or how many of
the brave youth of tnc land would go to
their death In the fever-stricken districts
of Cuba. Spain had already sent three
times as many soldiers to Cuba to sup
press the revolution as Great Britain had
sent to put down the American revolu
tion, yet the United States declined for
these years and months to recognize the
existence of a state or war. But It was
Idle now to regret idle opportunities. But
the war must not be laid at his door or
at the door of those who had acted with
him in urging the recognition of belliger
ency months ago. uid not desire to
criticize the President, but he did not
BÂ£ree with those who believed Senators
should surrender their Judgment to the
executive.
Teller declared that there must b.<" no i
interference by the allied powers of Eu- !
rope. It they attempted that, we would j
fight the world. We should declare it
with all the vigor of our Anglo-Saxon
blood and our 'iU.wW.uuO of people, and if
we did, the world would not attempt to
lay Its hands upon us.
The applause that greeted this state
ment wits suppressed by the Vice-Presi
dent.
When Teller concluded, another effort
to reach an agreement and adjourn was
made by Jones of Arkansas, and this time
with success, but it led to the most excit
ing incident of the day. The lie was ;
passed, as it was in the House on
Wednesday, and while no unseemly uis
order, such as disgraced the House, fol
lowed, the sensation it caused was quite
as profound. Jones proposed that the
Senate adjourn until to-morrow at 10
o'clock, and that to-morrow White of
California, Caffery of Louisiana and Wel
lington of Maryland, who are opposed to
any action by Congress, and whose view
of "the Question had not yet been pre
sented, be allowed four hours, other Sen
ators to be confined to fifteen minutes
each, with the exception of Platt of Con
necticut, who should be given half an
hour. After some explanations, Senators
Caffery. White and Wellington in turn
gave their consent. Money of Mississippi
thf ught the agreement ought to include
provision for a vote. "We are in the
attitude of a man who has lifted his arm
to strike," said he, "and afraid to strike
the blow."
"I suggest," observed White, "that
those who seem so anxious to fight have
consumed all the time."
This caused a suppressed ripple of
laughter, alter which .money yielded to
the solicitatio'is of those about him, and
said he would not object. All looked se
rene, when Chandler of New Hampshire,
who is given to rather vitriolic jests on
occasions, dropped a rerifark that caused
an explosion such as the dignified Senate
| has never witnessed in many years.
"I know the Senator from Mississippi,"
i he observed, with a quizzical smile on his
countenance, "does not wish to vote on
this question until he has heard the Sen
ator from Maryland (Wellington) in
full." me strong emphasis was on me
i last two words. Wellington Jumped to
| his feet and, turning angrily upon Chan
i dler, announced sharply that he did not
! relish the "pleasantry" of the Senator
from New Hampshire. [Laughter.]
"I do not intend to intimate that it is
necessary for the Senator from Missis
sippi to hear what I have to say about
tnis matter; but I represent in part one
of the sovereign States of this Union. I
j have sat here and listened to the Senator
from Mississippi when he returned as
' one of the agents of the newspapers In
New YorK, and I believe that the people
of Marylandâ"
Money was on his feet. He was stand
ing in the rear of the Democratic benches,
about fifty feet away from Wellington,
who, with flushed face, occupied a con
spicuous position immediately to the left
of the Vice-PresidenfÃ cnalr.
"Mr. President, I want to correct the
Senator from Maryland." he observed.
"The remark that he just made Is abso
lutely untrue."
"I waat to say to the Senator from Mis
1 sissippi that the Journal had said that
its commissioner had returned," replied
Wellington.
"I do not care what the Journal said,"
retorted Money.
Wellingtonâ lf there is any untruth in
the statement it was made by the news
paper.
"I am correcting you, not the Journal,"
retorted Money. I say the remark you
make is not true."
"I make the remark as the Journal gave
it," again retorted Wellington, doggedly.
"Then you make it on your own re
sponsibility," cried Money, his whole
frame quivering with suppressed emotion,
his arm outstretched defiantly toward
I the Senator from Maryland.
"I do make it upon my own responsibil
ity." replied Wellington with a flash.
"Then you lie," came from the Missis
sippi Senator so quickly that it sounded
like an echo or a crack of a pistol after
the flash of the explosion.
Th Senate was electrified. Senators
looked at each other in blank amaze
ment, and the galleries rose en masse and
leaned over as the two Senators faced
each other.
When quiet was restored, an agreement
wab reached that the final vote on the
Cuban resolutions be taken before the
Senate adjourn to-morrow.
St<wart of Nevada took the floor and
made a speech in favor of recognizing
the Cuban republic

Secretary Alger also selected the
commanders of the divisions of the
army that are to assemble at the j
places named, all of whom are well
known for this service in the military
branch of the Government. For the
division at New Orleans, Brigradier
General W. B. Shafter of San Francis
co, in command of the Department of
California, was designated; for that at |
Tampa, Brigadier General J. F. Wade,
now in command of the Department of
the Dakotas at St. Paul, Minn.; for i
Mobile, Brigadier General J. J. Cop- '
pinger, now on duty in command of
the Department of the Missouri at
Omaha, Nebr.; while for the post at
Chickamauga, Major Gneral J. R.
Brooke, in command of the Depart
ment of the Lakes, with headquarters
at Chicago, was chosen. These officers
have authority to take with them to
their new commands their entire staff
of officers and a quartermaster. These
latter, however, presumably will pro
ceed to their prospective assignments
for the purpose of making all neces
sary arrangements for camp grounds
and many other requirements incident
to the presence and operation of any
army.
The command of the army will de
volve upon Major General Nelson A.
Miles, who is now at the head of the
military branch of the Government.
His temporary headquarters, it is said,
will probably be at Atlanta, where
General Graham, who has command of
the Department of the Gulf, is now lo
cated. General Miles' permanent head
quarters will depend entirely upon the
developments of the campaign. He will
leave the city soon for his new duties.
Three regiments of Infantry and
four of cavalry are not included in the
mobilization orders, for the reason that
they are either a great distance from
the center of operations, are needed in
the section of the country in which
they are located or are in a location
where they can be readily summoned.

Army.
Special Dlspatrh to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., Aril 15.â A special
to the Herald says: Bulletins received
to-day announcing that orders have
been issued putting the regular army
into motion for points on the southern
coast have again revived the spirits of
the officers and men of Captain Samp
son's fleet. "This looks* like business,"
was the comment heard to-night
aboard the ships and ashore.
As already pointed out in the Herald,
the seeming absence of any preparation
on the part of the army to co-operate
with the navy in the task of taking
Havana haa been a subject of general
surprise and not a little criticism in
naval circles here. The fleet has been
in a splendid state of efficiency
for weeks. but every intelligent
officer realizes the futility of attempt
ing to take Havana by assault, and
then hold it in such a way as to restore
and preserve order without the active
co-operation of a large and efficient
force of troops.
The report that orders have actually
been issued for the mobolization
of the army therefore electrified the
naval officers here to-night, and, de
spite the long succession of delays and
disappointments which have chafed
their martial spirit, the general feel-
Ing this evening 1b that Havana's doom

together are now destined to win a

ULTIMATUM
THE NEXT STEP.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â '
The Washington Post's sum- '
mary of the situation, to be
published in to-morrow's issue,
includes the following state
ment: ,
Immediately the President is
empowered to use the army and
navy he will issue an ulti
matum to Spain, giving her
twenty-four hours â possibly
forty-eight â within which to
answer whether she will peace
ably withdraw her troops and
flag from Cuba. Her refusal to
evacuate the island â which is,
of course, expected â will be the
signal for action on the part of
this Government, and that ac
tion will be the vigorous use of
our naval and land forces. The
Post makes this statement upon,
the highest possible authority,
the course of action indicated
having been decided upon at
yesterday's Cabinet meeting.
time this afternoon. He declined to
comment on the news that the army
had been ordered to move, but evi
dently was pleased. He seemingly has
shared to a great degree the feeling of
unrest and uncertainty common among
his men.
The Cuban colony In Key \vest, at
the Marti Club and other resorts fre
quented by them, are celebrating to
night as though Cuban independence is
already assured.

URGES CO-OPERATION
OF FRUIT GROWERS
Convention nt Riverside Addressed
by A. R. Sprague of Los
Angeles.
RIVERSIDE. April 15.â The second j
day's session of the State Fruit-Growers' i
Convention proved, if anything, more In- |
teresting than that of Thursday. Tho j
first address, delivered by W. C. Fuller of I
Colton, gave his experience in citrus fruit
growing and his ideas of the best varie
ties of oranges to plant. Several mem- |
bers took part in the general discussion
which followed, on the advisability of
pruning, and the consensus of opinion
favored reasonable cutting away of'trees.
A. R. Sprague of Los Angeles introduced
the subject of marketing deciduous
fruits. He earnestly advocated co-opera
tion. He found the apathy of fruit-grow
ers great at the present time, owing to
frost and drought. The output of or
chards waa Increasing rapidly, and new
markets must be secured. This could
best be accomplished by united action.
The matter of overproduction created
earnest discussion and the delegates wore
divided. Many advocated the idea that
a limit of profitable fruit-growing had
about been' reached.
A resolution was passed condemning
the Barlow Quarantine bill.

TRINITY RIVER
TO BE DREDGED
FOR PLACER GOLD
Steam Shovels Will Be Utilized
to BrinÂ£ Up Gravel From the
Bed of the Stream.
REDDING. April 15.â A company of Montana capitalists recently
acquired the Poker Bar gravel deposits In the Trinity River, near the
famous Low Jen's ranch, in Trinity County, and has now begun work
oi\ a plan of operations which is a novelty, at least in the mining fields
of California.
Poker Bar is an extensive area of rich gravel in coarse placer gold,
whose treasures have been scarcely touched because of the well nigh
Insurmountable difficulty of petting a continuous supply of water. An
attempt was made a few years ago by mining men of Calaveras
County to work the deposits on a pretentious scale, but the effort met
failure. The heavy rise in the river washed out their works, which had
cost a fortune.
The Montana company now in possession proposes to throw a great
dam across the Trinity liiver below the gravel fields. Backwater cre
ated by the obstruction will flood th<3 entire mining grounds. An im
mense dredger is to be floated on this artificial lake, and the gravel
will be raised to the surface with steam shovels and carried through a
series of gold-saving sluices, as is now being done along the Sacramento
River near Redding.
The dredging machinery Is now being built by the Risdon Iron
Works 5n San Francisco, and will be shipped to this city by rail, thence
by wagon to Trinity County. Construction of the boats or pontoons for
the dredging machinery and gold-saving apparatus is now under way
at Poker Bar. The company has already let a contract for 500 cords of
wood for the steam power plant. E. F. Woods, a teaming contractor
of this city, got the contract to haul the machinery to Trinity County.
The steam boiler alone weighs over 10,000 pounds.

PALO ALTO, April I?. -The entire stu

this evening for the final baseball rally

a cart, were called upon to speak, and
all expressed their determination to
make the fight of their life to-morrow.
Coach Sheehan's terse remark was
cheered to the echo:
"Fellows, this proves that Stanford
spirit cannot die."
The "hoodoo," bound to a pole, was
brought forth and the death sentence
read. Then came the question:
"Gentle-men, shall he burn?"
"Burn!" yellert the excited students,

M'CLOUD RIVER INDIANS
IN A DRUNKEN ROW.
One Buck Beaten to Death With
Clubs and Bocks at the Baird
Reservation.
REDDING, April 15.â A remnant of the
tribe of McCloud River Indians, dwelling
on a rancheria one mile this side of the
United States Reservation at Baird, got
into a row while crazed with liquor, and
one buck was so badly beaten with clubs
and rocks that he died shortly after
ward. Coroner Earnest received a mes
sage from Robert Radcliffe, a United
States Fisheries employe, stating that a
drunken row had occurred among the
Indians below the Federal Reservation
and that one had received injuries from
which he died and several others were
badly hurt. The Coroner left in a few
hours for the scene of the tragedy, twen
ty-two miles north of Redding. The In
dian who killed his tribesman will be
placed under arrest and lodged in the
County Jail. Other arrest" for sellinar
liquors to Indians will folhJ*, as a de
termined effort will be made by the offi
cers of the fisheries reservation to break
up the nefarious traffic. The body of the
Indian was interred in the tribal bury
lng-grwind. The dismal mourning of the
squaws and bucks was kopt up all night.
ASSAULTS AN EDITOR
WHO DUBBED HIM A CUR.
SAN JOSE, April 15.â Attorney William
M. Beggs went to the office of the Ma..
at Los Gatos this evening and adminis
tered a severe beating to Editor W. 8.
Walker. Beggs struck Walker with his
fifts, knocked him down and then kicked
him. Although badly disfigured, the edi
tor is not seriously injured. Afterward
Beggs met George Walker, a son of the
editor, on the street, and an encounter
between the men was only prevented by
the interference of bystanders.
The trouble grew out of the recent libel
suit of Henry Schomberg against Walker
fir JIO.OOo damages, which was decided in
favor of the paper. Beggs prosecuted the
case for Schomberg, and in an issue of
the paper to-day Beggs was referred to
a 1?a 1 ? a cur.
Beggs was subsequently arrested on a
charge of battery, and released on giving
a bond of SIOOQ. .

PORTERVILLE. April 15.â Miss Emma, the i6-year-old daughter
of Mr. j . Mrs. J. E. Fontain of this place, disappeared shortly a'ter
7 o'clock 1 I evening:. Just prior to that time she had saic that she
â¢was going over to one of the neighbors, where r me of her school

was unconscious when found. She was taken home and a physician

laboring under mental aberration when she wandered away from
home. The point at which she was found is about one mile from her
home. She did not remember anything that had happened after she
left her home.
NORTH PITIED
AGAINST SOUTH
Tournament of Tennis
Opens at Nordhoff, in
Ojai Valley.
Racket Wielders From Above
Tehachapi Match Skill
With Southrons.
Champion Gaorgo Whitney Defeats
Picher in the Best Match of
the Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, April 15.â At the little
town of Nordhoff. in beautiful Ojai
Valley, fifteen miles north of here, this
was opening day of the greatest tennis
tournament ever held in Southern Cal
ifornia. There has for a long time
been a question as to whether the re
gion north of Tehachapl had better
tennis players than south of the
mountain could boast of. Some years
ago Miss Marion Jones of Santa Mon
ica brought the championship in ladies'
singles by defeating Miss Bee Hooper,
and there are some gentlemen here
who are expert wielders of the racket.
That the matter might no longer re
main in doubt W. L. Thatcher of the
Ojal Valley Tennis Club proceeded to
organize a tournament. He was suc
cessful in matching George and Rob
ert Whitney and Samuel and Sumner
Hardy, the champions of the north,
against A. W. Bumiller and Robert A.
Rowan of Los Angeles, O. I. Picher of
Pasadena and W. L. Thacher of Ojai,
who promised to uphold the banner of
the south. The tournament aroused
great interest in tennis circles.
The tournament was what is called
"Round Robin," that is, each player
from the South in singles and doubles
making sixteen singles and four dou
bles for the whole tournament. The
day was all that could be desired, the
weather being cool and cloudy, with
just enough breeze to fan the brows of
the players. The arrangements were
very complete and convenient; the
courts were in fine condition and the
grand stand was handsomely decorated.
At 9:30 time was called by H. Waldo
Forster, the referee. The first match
â¢was between Sumner Hardy and
Picher. Picher took tho first set and
on the second had a score of 3â23 â 2 be
fore Hardy woke up and won the last
two sets by strong volleying and driv
ing, which proved too much for Pich
er's back hand strokes and smashing.
Score: 4â6. 6â4, 6â2.
Sam Hardy and Bumiller then went
against each other with disastrous re
sults to the Southern man, although
he made some beautiful plays in lofv
volleying. Bumfller was not strong
at the back of court. Score: 6âl, 6â2,
in favor of Hardy.
In the next match Thacher downed
Robert Whitney with ease in two
straights, 10â8, 6â3. Whitney did not
seem to have his nerve with him,
while Thatcher played in form which
distinguished him when one of the
champions at Yale.
The next match was between George
F. Whitney and Robert A. Rowan. The
former won by a score of 6âl,6 â 1, 7â5,7 â 5, and
could have left Rowan with nothing
but "love" if he had awakened sooner.
Rowan did tolerably well in the second
set. At one time the score stood sâl5 â 1
in his favor, but it was apparent that
Whitney was only toying with him.
At 2:30 o'clock time was called for the
afternoon game with Sam Hardy and
Thacher at the net. The latter played
a strong game for a time, but it was
evident that he carried too much avoir
dupois to stand against the Northern
man and Hardy won in two straights,
6-3, 6-2.
By far the best tennis of the day
was played between Champion George
Whitney and Picher. The former was
the victor by 6-4, 6-4, but he had no
walk-over and for a time it looked as if
the Southern man would win. The fast
work of Whitney proved successful and
he defeated Ploher.
Sumner Hardy and Bumiller were the
next players. Both these boys are
slight and active and graceful as fawns
and it was hard to tell which was the
greater favorite with the grand stand.
There was much more beauty than sci
ence In their play and the Northern
man won by a score of 6-4. 6-3.
In the doubles Hardy brothers were
matched against Bumiller and Plcher.
It was evident from the start that the
Southerners were outclassed, but they
fought hard and the game was a bril
liant one. The score In favor of Hardy
brothers was 6-4, 6-2.
Whitney brothers then went against
Thacher and Rowan in the most excit
ing game of the day. The Northern
ers had to play a great deal harder than
they ever did before. The first set went
to the brothers by a score of 6 to 3. but
in the next the Southern champions
reversed the score. Just at dusk Whit
ney brothers won the third set and
game; score, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.
To-morrow it is expected that a large
crowd will be present, gathering from
all parts of Southern California, and
the most brilliant tennis playing ever
seen in the South is likely to be wit
nessed.

MAKING READY
FOR THE FETE
All San Rafael Engrossed
in Flower Carnival
Preparations.
Arches Are Being Reared on
the Main Streets of the
Town.
Success of a Benefit Performance
by the California Comedy
Company.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April 15.â "The rose
carnival." These are about the only
words one can hear in the "city of
roses" at present. On the streets, in
hotel lobbies, in the clubs and on the
trains, it is all the same. By some
subtle process, probably owing to the
correlation of ideas, the very air seems
to have become redolent of roses.
Great preparations are making for
that carnival, efforts clearly demon
strating the fact that in the summer
vocabulary of 3an Rafael there is no
such word as "failure." Arches are
going up all over town to the clinking
tune of the hammer and the rasping
tenor of the saw. The grand arch will
be situtated on Fourth street, between
A and B, just opposite the Postoffice.
The design for this, drawn ". * Farns
worth, the local artist, on suggestions
by Mrs. L. J. Hai m was accepted re
cently at a meeting of the executive
committee. Mrs. Haram, who is an ac
tive member of the decorative commit
tee, has for a long time been associated
in the decorative line with Miss Mary
Bates. The arch will be of redwood,
brought from the region of Duncans
Mills by Robert Dollar, the lumber man,
and will be so constructed that tiie
bark will produc . a most artistic ef
fect. The roof of evergreens will be sur
mounted by "Old Glory." Palms and
rose, the carnival colors, and rows of
incandescent lights will put on the fin
ishing touches. There will be neither
bunting nor anything else to produce a
stereotyped effect.
The Voluntc Firemen of San Fran
cisco have signified their acceptance of
the Invitation to attend the carnival
with all their paraphernalia. Leading
citizens of Sausalito are urging the
matter of representation vigorously,
and it is safe to predict that the beau
tiful little city will do itself proud on
the occasion. A public spirited lady of
Mill Valley has signified her intention
of beinf present with a 'bus load of all
the Sunday-school children that can be
raked together in the valley.
A large crowd assembled at thÂ«
opera-house this evening and greeted
the performance of the play "Pink
Dominos." given by the California
Comedy Company in behalf of the car
nival fund, which was appreciably
swelled in volume by the proceeds.
To-morrow afternoon the press com
mittee will hold j meeting to consider
the question of suitably entertaining
representative of the press during the
carnival. On Saturday evening, April
23. Dr. Frank Cornwall will lecture at
the opera-house for the benefit of the
carnival fund, on "The Art of Posture."
The lecture will be delivered under the
auspices of the San Rafael Social Club.
FOR THE KLONDIKE.
A Handsome Steamer Which Sails
Exclusively From San Fran
cisco.
A staunch, solid craft Is the steamer
Morgan City, which sails to-day at 3
o'clock on her initial trip to Copper River.
Besides being a swift-sailing Deauty, the
Morgan City belongs to the only line
backed by Eastern capital which sails
from San Francisco north.
She is the property of the Ladue-Yukon
Transportation Company, for whom the
Johnson-Locke Company are the local
agents. After this trip to Copper River
her next will be to St. Michael, where she
will connect with river steamers for Daw
son City. She has a promenade deck of
300 feet, and her staterooms and cabins
are handsomely fitted, giving more the
idea of a cozy home ashore than a tempo
rary floating dwelling-place. She 13
lighted by electricity, heated by steam
and everything within bespeaks comfort
and ease.
The company has issued a handsome
folder, containing a complete map of the
gold fields and full instructions How to
get there without being either frozen or
starved to death on the way.
School Accommodatioh Promised.
The West of Castro- Street Improve
ment Club at its meeting last night was
In a conciliatory mood toward the School
Directors since that august body prom
ised to provide accommodation for the
school children by the first of August.
The club committee appointed at the last
meeting waited on the board and fully
represented to it the great necessity of
providing a building on the west side of
Castro street for the children residing
there. The justice of the claim was rec
ognized by the Directors and a promise
made that a suitable place would be pro
vided by the commencement of the next
school term. This was satisfactory all
round and the club members feel as if a
victory has been trained. Consequently
there waa no war cry at the meeting last
nisht.
GAME LAWS
ARE VIOLATED
Fish Killed With Giant
Powder in Marin
County.
Finny Tribe in Lagunitas Creek
Has Been Almost Ex
terminated.
Sportsmen the Absence
â¢ of a Fish and Oamo
Warden.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April 15.â Sportsmen
of Marin County are enragedâ so thor
oughly angered that they are going to
make a good search for some legal
soothing syrup. The cause of it is the
wanton destruction of the fish in La
gunitas Creek by the use of giant pow
der in plain defiance of the law.
"Great shade of Izaak Walton," ex
claimed a well-known railroad man
yesterday. "If the old gentleman could
awake and take a trip along Lagunitaa
Creek he would see a sight that would
make him weep. Dead Hsh in every
deep hole, great and smallâ it Is all thu
same. This giant powder method ought
to be stopped and somebody be made
to suffer."
The principal place where fish have
been illegally killed, to say nothing of
the spawn, is near Camp Taylor. X
is asserted that certain men employed,
by Pedrini Bros, to take wood oft the
Shafter estate are responsible for the
outrage, as nobody else would care to
go there and kill fish with giant pow
der in full view of the woodcutters'
camps. Fish were unlawfully killed as
early as in March.
It is commonly supposed that there is
a Board of Fish Commissioners located
somewhere in the State, but it might
as well not exist, so far as the pro
tection of the finny tribe in Marin
County is concerned. An old man was
sent into the county five days befora
the open season began, but for all tha
work accomplished he might nearly as
well have spent his days in philosophic
meditation over Sturm's theorem.
What is needed is a fish and game war
den for the county, and those who
love the sport have about made up their
minds that one must be had at any
cost if a single fish is to be permitted
to remain in a stream that has af
forded recreation and amusement to
many handlers of the reel in days gone
by.
A Child's Accidental Death.
SA-. RAFAEL. April 15.â The jury ap
pointed by Coroner Eden to inquire Into
the death of 5-year-old Leon Oliver Kel
ton, who met death yesterday by falling
from a wagon driven by ula father on the
Petaluma road north or here, after a
short deliberation to-day brought in a
verdict of accidental death, in accordance
with the facts stated. The child was
badly mangled by the wheels of the
wagon, which was laden with about 1500
pounds of freight.
1 1 The truth. Weak as you are,
i I you still hope against hope
that you are going to get
well without trying to help
yourself. The day ;of mira-
â  %,? cles has passed. You will
. ' â â ' i never get vse!l until you try.
ft fâ¢"Tr Re nerves" that you have
I I I | are not worthy the name.
11l I | The manliness you possess
Vi L. I jis almost none. The confi-
{ dence you have in your own
abilities is less than nothing.
Why is this true ? You have
been indiscreet â too
hard, perhaps. Try to alter
matters to-day.
A well man is one who de-
lights to get up in the morn-
ing full of life, power and
energy. He is one of those
I who see happiness in every
step of life. He feels fully
equal to doing all nature
â  I If" I I requires of him, and he is
mjj requires of him, and If you
if fufl of happiness. If you
VU rlj j are one of these big men of
II L.L.L. ! nature you are to be con-
i gratulated ; but if you are
not, why not become virile
again ? You think you have
imposed on your constitu-
tion too heavily. As long as
"Hudyan" may be had it
will make up for ail your
losses.
What is "Hudyan?" It is
the grand remedio -treat-
ment of the Hudsonian doc-
tors for weak men. It can
be i obtained from them
| atone. But it je-creates
man. it gives life and vi-
I tality to those who are full
|of gloom and misery. To
Ijnill J those who fear, it brings
WU 11 1 131 self-reliance; to those who
1 1 1 1 iff are premature it is a great
1 1 U a I j help, in that it places nature
on her proper basis. Have
you abused your brain pow-
er ? Have you been foolish
in the exercise of any of
your functions ? Ask for
free circulars and testimo-
nials, showing you clearly
what "Hudyan" does. Med-
ical advice is free too. - .
If you see any sign of bloofi taint ask for
"30-day blood cure" circulars. ' It la .is effec-
tive as "Hudyan" for clearing all blood poison
out of â  the system. The fact that yours may
be a case In the tertiary stage makes no differ-
ence. "30-day blood cure" cures all blood taint.

But of greater moment than any of

and regarded as one of the most for
midable of her class afloat. These ne
i gotiations are being conducted by-
Charles R. Flint of New York, who has
j large commercial and financial inter
! ests in both countries. Mr. Flint was
' at the Navy Department to-day and
I held extended conferences with the Sec
j retary and other oflicials. While Mr.
Flint would not say how far the ne

; that the international dispute between
Chile and Argentina was assuming . ucii
j satisfactory shape as to warrant the
; presumption that they were not averse
; to parting with a portion of their na

It has been suggested that Chile shall
sell the O'Higgins and one torpedo
boat, while Argentina shall dispose of
the Garibaldi or the San Martin, both
fine cruisers, and two torpedo boats.
This would leave the two navies in
about the same respective condition.
Should Chile and Argentina decide to
sell these vessels it was believed to be
practically assured that they would be
added to the naval list of the United
States.

TIIE SAX FTtANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 16, 1898.
HAS GIVEN UP
ALL EFFORTS
' Pope Leo Realizes That
Peace "Will Not Long
Prevail.
Archbishop Ireland, Who Rep
resented His Holiness, Has
Left Washington.
Notified the Vatican That All At
tempts at Mediation Were Futile
in This Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 15.-A Washing
! ton special to the Herald says: The
| latest advices received in Washington
indicate that his Holiness, Pope Leo
: XIII, has given up his efforts to pro
' mote the interests of peace between the
| United States and Spain.
As an evidence of this fact, I may
state that to-night at 11 o'clock Arch
bishop Ireland of St. Paul, who has rep
resented t. s Pope In negotiations dur
ing the last two weeks, left the city.
presumably for New York. I am toid
that he left for good, although he may
, stop In Washington on his way to his
see in St. Paul.
Archbishop Ireland has notified Pope
Leo XIII that in iis opinion any furth
er efforts which could be made by him
or by the Pi.-pe himself woui be en
tirely futile, at least as far as the
United States is concerned.
A cablegram was received from the
! Vatican to-day expressing the deep re
gret of the Pope at the present serious
aspect of the case, and containing a
prayer that the spirit of peace might
still prevail.
The story printed this morning that
Archbishop Ireland last night called
! on the French Ambassador and with
him called on the Spanish Minister
i and then on the Austrian Minister'
: was denounced to me to-night as being
a falsehood. No message was received
; yesterday from Rome, and no such
visits were made last night. The sit
uation, as far as concerns the efforts
of Pope Leo to preserve peace, is cx
i actly as I have stated. Archbishop
Ireland pratically ceased all work
I toward this end when the President's

COOPERAGE
RUINED BY
FLAMES
Property of Laehman
& Jacobi Partially
Destroyed.
The Branch House on
Federal Street Will
Be Reconstructed.
According to the Owners the
Loss Was Almost Wholly
Covered by Insurance.
THE CAUSE A MYSTERY.
The Loss Has Not as Yet Been Esti
mated, but Will Probably
Exceed $8000.
The cooperage establishment of Lach- i
man & Jacob!, 63-55 Federal street, was [
partially destroyed by fire early this
morning, and the contents of the build
ing were also severely injured by the |
large amount of water which was j
thrown into the burning structure.
Two alarms were sounded from fire
box 57 about 12:30 o'clock and the de
partment quickly responded. Charles j
Sproule, the night watchman of the j
building, stated that he had thoroughly
looked over the premises about mid
night, and that no signs of a blaze were
to be seen at that time. The flames
were first noticed coming from the win- :
dows on the ton floor, and within a few
minutes the entire building seemed to
be burning to the ground. This was
probably due to the fact that immense
quantities of wine are stored in the i
building and the upper floors are of dry I
material.
After the first flame was seen the
whole structure scr mcd to become ig- ;
nited at the same time, but the fire de- j
partment, as well as the owners of the
establishment, are at a loss to account
for the cause unless some sparks from
the fire lit for the purpose of heating
the unused barrels caused the serious
blaze.
The building next door, occupied by J.
Jaughhan and Carl Assmus, employes
in the building, and owned by Joseph !
Fletcher, was damaged to a consider
able extent by water, but it is thought
the amount will be covered by insur
ance. Fifty-two men are employed in
the building, and, in consequence of the
flre, they will be thrown out of em- â .
ployment for a short time.
All their tools were in the building
at the time und the loss of them will
tend to bring up the amount of the
damage, which was roughly estimated
at $5000. According to the reports of the
owners of the property the damage will
not be very great unless the large ;
amount of wine on the lower floor was
damaged. It was thought at first that
the entire block would be destroyed j
by the flames, but prompt action on J
the part of the fire department soon ;
changed the ideas of those who were !
first on the scene.
Mr. Jacobi, a member of the firm, was
on the scene shortly after the blaze
was discovered. He said: "I have no
definite idea as to how the fire start
ed, although, of course, there are the
usual thousand and one ideas, any one
of which seems plausible, but not defi
nite enough to base a suggestion on.
"It is also impossible for me to make
an estimate as to the possible damage,
as I do not know just how much stock
was on hand. We used the lower floor
for the storage of wine and there was
anywhere from one hundred to one
hundred and fifty thousand gallons of
wine stored there. Of course, as you
may surmise, our stock is shifted in
and out, and without looking up the ac
counts it is impossible for me to make
any daflnlte statement regarding our
loss. Our loss is partially covered by
insurance, but I cannot remember the
figures: in fact, until we know how
much of the wine is ruined it will be
impossible to make the remotest cal
culation regarding our loss.
"The delay in starting up anew must
also be considered in the loss account.
Of course all the stock and finished
goods are gone, and this will put us to
some immediate inconvenience, but we
will re-open as soon as possible. A
great many of the workmen owned
their tools, which are very expensive, but
these they will replace themselves. We
will, of course, re-open as soon as pos
sible, as our business makes a con
stant demand for the finished barrels
or casks." __________^___

The crimson and the blue and gold will
meet at Recreation Park again this after
noon In the second game of the series
for the intercollegiate baseball cham
pionship. Stanford has taken its defeat
of last Saturday greatly to heart, and
the team is determined to reverse the
result to-day at all hazards, and with
that determination constantly in mind
the members have devoted every moment
to practice during the week that could
be spared from their studies. Coach
Jack Sheehan has been with them con
stantly, and their work during the past
few days has shown decided improvement.
The same men will go in to-day tnat
played last Saturday, as Sheehan is con

their own with Berkeley if they are in
condition.
California, too. has been far from idle.

won the first game they had no "cinch"

week has been steady and conscientious, i

teams, and to-day's game is counted on |

AMONG PROFESSIONALS.
Athletics and Oaklands to Meet
To-Day at Central Park.
Baseball is booming in all the cities of
the Pacific States League, and the man
agers of the Sacramento, Santa Cruz and
San Jose teams are confident that the
reason will be a most successful one. The
interior magnates have rounded up some
clever players, and the teams have been
playing such strong games that the
clubs from San Francisco and Oakland
have been taught to realize the neces
sity of strengthening. The Beachcomb
ers and Gilt Edges are exceptionally
strong, and the fans are already pre
dicting that the largest slice of the prize
money will be captured either by Sacra
mento or Santa Cruz. All the games be
tween these clubs last season were
played on their home diamonds, and the
lovers of the sport in this city were
greatly disappointed at their failure to i
witness any of the contests. There was
so much discontent over this circum
stance that the directors of the league
resolved in formulating the schedule of
this season to provide for a game be
tween those crack teams on the Central
Park diamond. The contest will take
place May 8, and will no doubt arouse a
great deal of interest.
The game at Santa Cruz last Sunday
between the Athletics (formerly the
Olympics) of this city and the home team
was protested by the visiting manager
on the ground that he was robbed by the
local umpire. The protest was contested
at a meeting of the executive commit
tee of the league, held at th > office of
President Bert Thursday evening. The
testimony was to the effect that there i
was a great deal of wrangling during
the game, and that the home umpire was
accused of making several rank decisions.
The matter was taken under advisement,
after which it was resolved to authorize
the umpires to Impose fines upon players
guilty of Insubordination, and to turn the
fines over to the treasurer, to be added to
the fund, which shall be distributed to
the winning teams, at the end of the sea
son.
Joe Corbett has not yet joined the Bal
timore Club, although the management
has agreed to give him an increase of
salary. The fact is that the star tv.irler
of the National League is not anxious to
return to the East. There is a little af
fair of the heart that is interesting Cor
bett more than baseball 1 at present, and
he is anxious to settle down in San Fran
cisco. If he remains here he may- engage
In some business and also play with and
captain the Oaklands.
Billings, the crack infielder and strong
hitter of the Stockton Club of the Cali
fornia League, has been signed by Man
ager Coffroth of the Oaklands of the Pa
cific States League, ami will make his
appearance with that team at Central
Park Saturday afternoon.
Manager Hennesev of the Gilt Edges
has secured a new first-base man for his
team in the person of a young society
man of Sacramento, whose name he de
clines to divulge at present. Hennesey
declares that his new man is a crack-a
jack. and Hennesey knows a ball player
when he sees him.

noon will be between the Athletics, or

and the Oaklands. The make-up is as

STOCKTON. April s.â Baseball enthus
iasts assembled in strong force at the
courthouse to-night to attend the meet-
Ing of the Stockton club, which has been
regularly incorporated. The stockholders
elected the following board of directors:
Judge McNoble, Joseph Peters Jr.. John
Heermen, George Campbell. Fred Tollard,
Frank Adams and Richard Lexen. The
directors then selected George Campbell
as president and manager, Fred Tollard
secretary and the Bank of Stockton
treasurer. The greatest enthusiasm pre
vailed, and ample money was pledged to
mako tue Stockton team the strongest In
the California League. More interest Is
manifested here in baseball than ever be
fore, the game of last Sunday having
worked the fans up to a high pitch of
excitement. Billings, who played in the
opening game with the team, has been
given his release.

SAYS RATS SCARED HER.
Family Disgrace Drives Florence Forbes, a Prettu
Young Girl, to Swallow Carbolic Acid,
Florence Forbes, an exceedingly pretty and modest girl IS years of age,
attempted to commit suicide yesterday morning by swallowing a dose of
carbolic acid at 1013 Golden Gate avenue, where she has been employed
as a domestic. The girl said she had to sleep in the basement, and
was almost scared to death by the colony of rats that made night hideous
with their noise. She had been unable to sleep for a week, which made her
extremely nervous. She Is a sensitive girl and brooded over the misfor
tunes of her family. Her father, Major Frank Forbes, who was known as
the champion whiitler of the United States army, died when the children
were young and they were placed in the Protestant Orphans' Home. The
eldest sister married George Foster, a bookmaker, and Florence went to
live with them, but Foster became insane about sixteen months ago and
Mrs. Foster had to break up her home and work for the support of herself
and two young children. Since then Florence has been employed as a do
mestic. Two of her sisters, Delia and Susie, are in the Magdalen Asylum
and her mother Is living with a colored man named Harris at 155 Potrero
avenue. Her mother's conduct particularly preyed upon the mind of the
sensitive young girl, and she made up her mind that it was better to die.
Thursday night she went to a drug store at 1224 Market street and
bought a bottle of carbolic acid. She told the servant girl next door of her
Intention to commit suicide, but the girl thought she was joKlng. About
5 o'clock in the morning she swallowed the poison and became uncon
scious. She was discovered about two hours later and a physician was
summoned. He telephoned to the Central police station and the patrol
wagon was sent to take the girl to the hospital. When the wagon arrived
the physician told Policeman Gaynor that the girl was all right and they
returned to the station. They were almost Immediately called up again
and the girl was taken to the hospital. Dr. Fitzgibbon applied the usual
remedies and the girl was soon pronounced out of danger. She expressed
regret for her act and said she would not try it again. Efforts are being
made to get some family to give the girl a home. The disconsolate girl had
been keeping company with a man named Max Speior. On Monday night
last they went out to the Chutes, but there they quarreled and Florence
left him and walked home alone. Since then the young man has refused to
renew friendship with her, and that added to her desire to quit the world.

c DUTY TOWARDS THE GUfIRD.
THERE seems every likelihood that the Na
tional Guard of California will be called to ac
tive service. That they will respond enthu
siastically there can be no doubt. It is unfair that
they should be asked to do this at great personal
loss and the hardship of losing positions in which
they earn their daily bread. They merit the practical
good will of every citizen.
The men of the National Guard of California are
not idlers. They come from the shop, from the desk,
the counting-room and the counter. They toil in
mills and factories; every honest vocation is repre
sented in their ranks. They are always ready to re
spond to the summons of the State or nation. They
would go to the front as gladly and gallantly as now
tiny will undertake the work from which the regular
soldiers have been ordered.
In the East some large employers â for in
stance. Wells. Fargo & Co.â have informed their
employe-; that any needed in the contest with
Spain may consider themselves at liberty to go, that
their pay will be continued, at least in part, and that
upon return their old positions will be awaiting them.
This is generous, but it is no more than right. It is
nothing but a seemly expression of patriotism.
Members of the California National Guard should
be assured that none by performing the service now
made necessary by the exigency of impending war
shall be deprived of the means of livelihood when the
emergency shall have passed. The employer who by
threat of discharge seeks to deter the State militiamen
from upholding the honor of the land will fall far
short not only of the pattern set by others, but of the
performance of a plain and simple duty of citizenship.
OREGON REPUBLICANS.
CLEAR, forcible and patriotic is the voice of the
Republicans of Oregon on the issues of the
day. The platform adopted by the State con
vention at Astoria is as terse, as vigorous and as em
phatic a declaration of the principles of the party and
its policies at this issue as could be desired by even
the most aggressive and stalwart Republican of any
part of the country.
The two issues of supreme importance are the
money question and the Spanish crisis, and on both
of these the utterances of the platform are notably
strong. They will be read all over the Union as evi
dences of the sentiment of the Republicans of the Pa
cific Coast, and will carry everywhere the assurance
that there is to be in the West no further compromis
ing with the silver men, nor any antagonism to the
policy of the President in dealing with the Spaniards,
whether the issue be peace or war.
The declaration in favor of the gold standard is ac
companied by the announcement, "We believe the best
money in the world is none too good to be assured
by the Government to the laborer as the fruit of his
toil or the farmer as the price of his crop." To this
is added a condemnation of the continued agitation
for free silver as calculated to jeopardize the prosper
ity of the country, and there is a particular condemna
tion of the unpatriotic efforts of the free silver agi
tators to array class against class and section against
â¢ection.
On the war issue there is a full and patriotic declar
ition of confidence in the administration. This is the
keynote of Republican sentiment everywhere on this
issue. In a crisis of this kind there ought to be the
fullest harmony among all citizens. An opposition
to the administration or an effort to destroy confi
dence in the President is at this juncture almost a
treason to the nation. The Republicans of Oregon
have done well to speak in no uncertain tones on the
issue, and can with reason rely upon the people to
sustain them at the polls.
By cable from Madrid comes the important infor
mation that over there the people are inclined to view
the message of the President "as derogatory to Span
ish dignity." Perhaps it is all of this. A message
which cites the bloody record and the treachery of a
nation could hardly have been designed to tickle its
vrnity.
One O'Neil who has been arrested for burglary also
figures as a bondsman for a man named Kellett, who
has fled the city. A common sense of gratitude should
now impel Kellett to return. Doubtless -he could get
accepted as surety for his friend O'Neil.
Of course another lot of Chinese have been per
mitted to enter on the plea of desiring to participate
in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and after having
given their promise to go back. Faith is a beautiful
thing.
Now is the time for a graceful backdown on the
part of Spain. A little later the operation may be so
precipitate as to give the impression of being awk

MR. BRYAN APPEARS.
V 4 R. WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN ap
/ \ peared in Washington on Thursday to advo
cate raising the European blockade of Spain
which has been created by the President's policy.
General Lee has advised that the blockade stand, that
there be no recognition of the Junta and no demand
for the dismemberment of Spain, her refusal to be
the cause of a declaration of war against her.
Lee has been mentioned as the next Democratic
candidate for the Presidency. He has stood, with
bravery and patience, in a position of supreme diffi
culty, and has assisted the administration in preserv
ing the isolation of Spain. He is popular. His re
ception in this country testifies to that. Mr. Bryan
has filed a caveat on the next Democratic nomination.
He sees in Lee a possible competitor who will carry
away New York and the Southern delegations.
Therefore he must make politics against Lee in his
own party, and against the President in the country.
lo do this he repairs to Washington to advise recog
nition of the Junta, which Lee says should not be
done. Mr. Bryan's reason is stated to be that "it
will be the proper political step to take; it will be
popular."
Reading the expressions from Continental Europe
uttered at the very time Mr. Bryan was making per
sonal and party politics out of the prospective
slaughter of men in war, we see plainly the result that
will follow the acceptance of his advice. France, our
ancient ally, stands with Spain on the issue of dis
memberment. Austria stands with France. From
Germany comes no expression except of aversion
and hatred for the United States. Russia, just estab
lishing herself at the end of a march of two centuries
in search of an unfrozen harbor, as the possessor of
extraterritorial domain, has vital interests against
the theory of a right to demand dismemberment. So,
from Biscay to the Baltic, lies the possibility and ex
treme probability of a Continental alliance with
Spain if Mr. Bryan's "good politics" prevail in Con
gress.
This nation is formidable. It has i 0.000.000 fighting
men, and what credit Mr. Bryan's conspiracy against
its financial soundness leaves to it. It can make war
against Spain for the destruction of a battle-ship and
the murder of her crew, or it can intervene in Cuba,
following a long chapter of precedents established by
all the European powers, and Spain can make this
the cause of a declaration of war. As the necessary
result of either course Cuba will be liberated and
our loss of life and treasure will be reduced to a
minimum. The people of Cuba will then form a
government to suit themselves, regardless or regard
ful of the Junta, as they choose.
Mr. Bryan, however, does not want this plan fol
lowed. He wants an issue to use in his business of
getting an office. Therefore he desires action by
Congress that will be, in its final analysis, a 'eclara
tion of war against Continental Europe. His selfish
personal interests, as he sees them, require that the
United States assume a right not claimed by any em
pire, principality or power from Babylon to these
days. He wants us to demand the dismemberment of
Spain, and to fight her if she refuse. He wants to
change the issue and shift the ground of contro
versy. He wants to destroy the Monroe doctrine, to
abandon the traditional policy of this Government,
and to take a position which dissolves every existing
rule of international right and responsibility. He is
the ambitious youth scratching a match to light a
conflagration that will extend no man knows where,
and be quenched no man knows when.
Can we credit Mr. Bryan with knowing enough to
know what he is doing? On him is no official re
sponsibility. That rests with the man who beat him.
Is his sense of propriety so bankrupt, so drowned
in the great gulf of his consuming vanity, as to cause
the belief that he is the leader of the people, that he
is the dictator of policy, that he holds the issue of
peace or war, of life or death?
If so, he is on the eve of an awakening that will be
instructive. Congress is not composed entirely of
self-seeking politicians, nor does the country wish to
water Mr. Bryan* s wheel with blood. If it is to be
shed the red stream will run that honor may live,
not that Mr. Bryan may get an office. He has his
analogue in Spain. He is the American pretender,
the Nebraska Don Carlos, the political Bourbon, who
learns nothing and who forgets nothing. His Span
ish counterpart threatens domestic revolution if the
Spanish Government go against his ideas, while Mr.
Bryan threatens to make an issue at the polls if the
man who beat him refuse to accept his leadership.
A NATIONAL LOBEL LAW.
ADDRESSES made on the opening day of the
State Fruit-growers' Association at Riverside
clearly reveal the interest taken by our fruit
men in the movement toward procuring such legis
lation as may be required to protect them from the
injurious competition of the makers of adulterated
fruit foods. The issue is, in fact, one that concerns
the general public as well as the fruit men, and it will
remain a subject of incessant agitation until it has
been settled for all time by being settled right.
The enactment of local regulations or State laws
against the manufacture or sale of impure foods is
not a sufficient remedy for the evil, and cannot be, no
matter how drastic or sweeping such laws may be
made. The contest involves something more than the
suppression of adulterations that are proved to be
harmful and perhaps poisonous. A large number of
the manufactured articles put on the market as fruit
preserves or olive oils are harmless enough in their
nature, but are none the less a fraud on the public
and a wrong to the producers of genuine preserves
and true olive oil, because they are made of cheap
stuff and are not what they pretend to be.
Mr. WardeH is reported to have urged upon the
fruit-growers the importance of a national law on the
subject and to have advocated such legislation as
should require every article offered for sale to be
labeled according to its true character. There would
be no injustice to any one in such a law. If the '"so
phisticated foods." as they are called by those who
deny that they are "adulterations," are harmless, the
manufacturers of them can certainly have no objec
tion to selling them under their rightful names. A
man who is willing to consume a preserve made of
apple-cores and glucose flavored with orange should
be permitted to do so, but he ought not to be made
to pay for it under the impression that he is getting
genuine orange marmalade.
Our Government requires that all imported goods
shall be plainly marked "Made in Germany" or
France or England, as the case may be, and a simi
lar marking should be required as to what they are
made of, whether manufactured at home or abroad.
Cotton-seed oil should be sold as the product of
cotton-seed and not as the product of an olive.
Apple jam and glucose should be sold as the product
of corn fields and apple-cores, and not as the product
of Californian orange groves. It is time to put an
end to this commercial masquerading. Honest label
ing will injure no honest article.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 16, 1898.
TK|E MOYOR AND HIS POWERS.
THE efforts of some of the supporters of the
proposed new charter to conceal the true char
acter of the powers which have been conferred
by that instrument upon the Mayor arc in the nature
of an electoral confidence game. The leading fea
tures of the charter are centralization and individual
responsibility. If the principles underlying these are
good things, why should anybody attempt to hide
them from the public or meet arguments against them
with pleas in avoidance or denials
One organ which is engaged in grinding out new
charter tunes daily has stated in terms that the Mayor
created by the charter will not be a "Lord Mayor 1 ' â
meaning by this that he will not under the instru
ment exercise powers of an extraordinary character.
For the purpose of countervailing an article in this
journal in which the functions of the Mayor were
dearly defined, this organ submits an extended state
ment of the powers which the charter-makers have
conferred upon the people. It illustrates the self
sacrificing magnanimity of the Freeholders with the
allegation that they have authorized the people to
elect eighteen Supervisors, an Auditor, Treasurer, As
sessor, Tax Collector, Coroner, Recorder, City At
torney, District Attorney, Public Administrator,
County Clerk, Sheriff, twelve Superior Judges, five
Justices of the Peace and four Police Judges.
The publication of this is accompanied by the as
sertion that when it is alleged that the proposed char
ter has created a Mayor with unprecedented powers a
supremely ridiculous statement is made. Yet the fact
remains that all the patronage controlled by the offi
cials whose creation has thus been generously con
ferred upon the people will not aggregate one-quarter
that which the Mayor will directly and indirectly con
trol. With the patronage of the Board of Public Works
alone the Mayor under the proposed new charter could
undoubtedly, if so disposed, dictate terms to the en
tire elective portion of the government. Should San
Francisco enter upon a system of street and sewer
improvements during the next ten years it would ex
pend from $25,000,000 to $30,000,000 in new work.
Every dollar of this money would literally pass
through the hands of the Mayor.
A Mayor of this character, as we have previously
remarked, may be a good thing. Possibly this town
has reached a stage when it is necessary that it should
have some such potentate to manage its affairs. But
what good is going to be accomplished by concealing
the nature of the monarch we are about to create? Is
it honest for the Freeholders to smuggle this sort of
a Mayor into the City Hall without letting us know
what sort of a kinglet he really is? If centralization
and individual responsibility are correct in principle,
a fight ought to be made upon them openly and
above board. That is the honest way to conduct the
charter campaign.
AN ART GALLERY FOR SAN JOSE.
BY the generous offer of Mrs. M. P. O'Connor
of that city San Jose has an opportunity to ob
tain an art collection valued at about Â§ioo,ooo.
The offer of the donor is subject to the sole condition
that the city or its people provide for the collection a
building suitable for the purpose. A site will be
granted for the edifice in Normal School square, so
ihat the city will have no further expense entailed
upon it than that required for the construction of the
building.
The terms and conditions being so favorable and
the collection to be gained so valuable, there can be
no doubt the San Joseans will be prompt to avail
themselves of the opportunity to enrich their city for
all time with an art gallery which from the start will
be one of the most notable in the State. It is re
ported that upward of $5000 has been subscribed al
ready to the building fund, and the movement to ob
tain subscriptions has hardly more than begun.
This liberal offer on the part of Mrs. O'Connor is
not to be passed over as a comparatively unimportant
event in the history of San Jose or even in that of the
State. Artistic development has been one of the
most salient features of American life during the last
quarter of a century, and there is every assurance
that in the future art culture and art work will en
gage an increasing amount of the attention and the
energy of our people. Those communities that have
advantages in the way of such culture will become
more and more esteemed as places of residence, and
will therefore gain in the contest for pre-eminence
with other cities equally favored perhaps in other
respects, but lacking in that which is now becoming
so essential to our intellectual life.
It is to be noted, moreover, that even commerce in
these days is developing largely along artistic lines.
Among articles equally good as to quality and use
the preference of customers is always for those which
are presented in the most artistic forms. This fact
has been strikingly illustrated in the course of the
industrial struggle between France, Germany and
Great Britain. A generation ago the French held
almost a monopoly of certain valuable lines of trade
because of the superior beauty and taste of the ar
ticles produced by their workmen. The establishment
of art schools in Germany and England has broken
down that monopoly, and now the people of those
countries are supplying not only their own markets,
but those of the world, with such goods in competi
tion with France.
Similar results have been accomplished in the
United States,- though on a less extensive scale.
Enough has been done here, however, to show the
commercial and industrial value of fine art. The of
fered gift of Mrs. O'Connor to San Jose is therefore
a public benefit of the widest scope and highest char
acter. The effect produced by such an art collection
there will be felt as an influence throughout the State,
and indirectly all California will be benefited by it.
A generous deed has been done by a generous
woman, and the San Joseans in providing a building
for the collection should bear in mind they are to
build for all time and for an institution that will
grow with the years, and consequently their edifice
should be made spacious, durable and noble.
If the map of the Golden Gate showing the alleged
position of alleged guns and torpedoes had been even
in a measure correct its publication in the Examiner
at this time would have been near treason and ample
ground for Government suppression of the paper.
Under the circumstances, however, the publication
was merely a symptom of paresis.
The appointment of Weyler as commander of the
Spanish forces would be satisfactory both to the
Cubans and to this country. There would be poetic
justice in throwing his carcass to the same vultures
who have been faring on lean and unnutritious re
cor.centrados.
There seems to have been a lack of stability about
the rumor that W. K. Vanderbilt intended to present
to the Government a warship worth $5,000,000.
It seems that the army has been strengthened by
the desertion of a few cowards from the Presidio.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
At last the matinee girl and the woman
hero-worshiper of New York have found
an American to burn incense befr . in
stead of seeking out hirsute foreigners
for the objects of their adoration. David
Bispham, a home product, is the latest
cult, and to ail appearances he is fuliv
filling the aching void left vacant by
Paderewski, Jean de Reszke and Max Al
vary. A corresponded who. attended one
of his recent concerts says: "I have heard
about the Bispham cult, seen articles in
the jocose columns of certain frivolous
journals relating to it, but I never real
ized the full extent of the mania until I
attended a concert the other afternoon at
the Astoria, where the American bary
tone sang. I had a seat that day near the
stage â one poor, forlorn man almost
burled in a sea of satins and laces and
suffocated with a hundred subtle odors.
DAVID BISPHAM, THE OBJECT OF THE NEW CULT.
Bispham stands up to sing-. lam sensible
of a fluttering all around me; front the
corners of my eyes I see beautiful women
pinch one another in ecstasy of Joyful an
ticipation; I hear issue from four-score
lovely bosoms long drawn-out sighs of
perfect bliss, on the waves of which float
such sweet expressions as 'Oh, isn't he
lovely?' 'Ah, what a man!' 'Did you ever
know such an artist?' 'What a voice!'
'How he does sing!' 'Isn't he the sweet
est thing?' and, to cap the climax of hys
teria this last, 'Oh, aren't you glad you're
alive?' There are some good, eomnton,
sensible people who will fancy perhaps
that I am making these tales out of
whole cloth, but I assure them, and will
swear on a stack of Bibles if demanded
of me, that I have written not a whit
more than the truth in telling what hap
pened at the Astoria."
Jan Blockx and Tiere's successful opera,
"The Princess of the Inn," is to be pro
duced at the Monnaie Theater, Brussels,
next season; Berlin has also secured it.
The other day it reached its fiftieth per
formance at Ghent, and, among- the mani
festations of which the composer was the
object on that occasion was one which
shows how generally librettists are neg
lected. Amid the acclamations of the
crowded theater Jan Blockx was called to
the box of the Mayor, M. Braun, who,
surrounded by his civic officers, solemnly
presented the successful composer with a
gold medal bearing the inscription: "La
Ville de Gand a Jan Blockx â I'r'ncesso
d'Auberge, 1898": (The city of Ghent to
Jan Blockx, "Princess of the Inn"â lS9S).
Jan Blockx gracefully expressed his
thanks for the tribute, and there was
general emotion. At the next session of
the Municipal Council several of the
Councilors asked the Mayor why the
librettist, M. de Tiere, had not been asso
ciated in the homage rendered Jan
Blockx. M. Braun answered frankly:
"We forgot all about him." The musician
had been the only one remembered; no
one had given one thought to the libret
tist. It is the general rule to overlook
librettists in this manner, but the Muni
cipal Council of Ghent resolved to do the
right thing, so the Councilors at once or
dered a medal to be struck off for M. de
Tlere. It was too late, however, to offer
it to him publlciy, so it was finally re
solved to send the librettist his medal by
post. t
The veteran song writer, Henry Rus
sell, although so very popular some years
ago, received scarcely any emolument
from his compositions; the competence he
realized was made by giving concerts and
singing and playing his own songs. Had
he written the whole of his works last
year he might have been a wealthy man
to-day, but there were no "royalties" in
the thirties. Nowadays the composer of
a popular song may make thousands of
dollars by one eifort, but the songs which
rang through England and America years
ago brought practically no result, apart
from Mr. Russell's singing of them.
"Cheer, Boys, Cheer" was sold for a
sovereign, and ' rhe Gamblers Wire,"
"The Maniac" and "The Slave Ship" yield
ed a like amount. "Nowadays," says Mr.
Russell, "a man receives fourpence for
every copy sold of his song, but I never re
ceived a single fourpence in royalties. On
one occasion thirty-nine presses were
working to supply the demand for
â¢Cheer, Boys, Cheer,' yet all I got was
a sovereign, though afterward the pub
lisher did give me a ten-pound note. But
he made a fortune out of my Work."
Jules Schuloff, whose pianoforte com
positions are known to amateurs all over !
the world, has just died in Berlin at the j
age of 73. Schuloff was born in Prague,
and completed his musical studies in |
Paris under Chopin. He made numbers '
of tours as a concert-pianist through
Europe, especially Germany, England,
Russia and Spain. For forty years he
gave pianoforte lessons in Paris, and
later in life settled in Dresden and finally
at Berlin. Among his best-known com
positions are "The Shepherd's Song"
(Chant dcs Bergers), the "Fantasie" on
popular Bohemian airs and his "Concert j
Waltzes."
The commission that Is organizing the
coining exposition at Turin has requested
Luigl Mancinelli to write an Inaugural
cantata to words by E. Berta. The com
poser has accepted the offer. Mancinelli
is the only Italian whose name figures on
the programme of Covent Garden Opera
House this season; the singers are Amer
ican, English, Scotch, Polish, French,
Scandinavian, Belgian, etc., etc., but
Mancinelli, one of the conductors. Is the
only Italian in the long list of singers,
conductors, etc.
Raynaldo Hahn, who set to music
Pierre Lotl's "he Mariage de Loti," Is one
of the most envied men in Paris. Not yet
24, he Is the matinee girl's and the piano
girl's idol. His dreamy melodies are
played on all the boudoir pianos and sung
in all the drawing rooms of Paris, and
now he has made his debut as an operatic
composer at the Opera Comique with a
three-act opera, based on Loti's marriage,
which has been generally pronounced
"sweetly poetical." fiaynaldo Hahn is a
fortunate man.
A competition has been opened to all
composers of Italian nationality for the
composition of a mass in the severe style.
It is to be written for four voices with
organ accompaniment and is to follow
the rules laid down for masses on July
4, 1594. A prize of 1000 francs will be given
to the successful competitor and medals
and diplomas of merit will be presented
if a cumber of good masses are present-
cd. The successful work will be exe
cuted publicly in Turin.
Many years ago Mme. Bordas was a
favorite at cafe concerts in Paris, on ac
count of the spirited way in which she
sang the popular songs of the period.
This lady, who has not been heard of
for twenty years, has written from Al
giers to L'Echo de Paris, saying that her
voice still retains all its pristine beauty
and that she intends to visit Paris in 1900
and show the world what French popular
songs were at the period when she was
in her zenith.
According to all accounts a second
Mozart has come to light at Bergamo, In
Italy. The new aspirant for musical
honors Is an infant phenomenon in his
eleventh year, who has already mastered
the science of music. The precocious
child is completing the orchestration of
an opera in one act entitled "Carmela,"
the libretto of which was written by
Signor Parmenio Bettoli.
The score of Massenet's "Cinderella" j
was played over the other day at the '
Opera Comique to Albert Carre, in pres
ence of the librettist, Henri Cain, and of i
a number of French musicians of note. I
It was pronounced to be an exquisite i
score and was eagerly accepted for pro
duction at the Opera Comique.
A new operetta has been given at the
Alfieri Theater, Turin, entitled "Rafael
and the Fornarina." The work fell flat
on account of an impossible libretto;
possibly the Italians objected to seeing
their great painter and his favorite model
made the subject of a comic opera.
Slgnora Anna Stolzmann, a prima don
na, was ambitious enough some months
ago to become manager on her own ac
count of the San Carlo Theater, Naples,
the biggest opera house in the world with
the one exception of La Scala, Milan. The
lady has just gone into bankruptcy, her
chief creditors being the members of the
chorus and the orchestra.
A grand concert was given in Saint

The Latest Plan to Assist

Festival.
Blossoms Coming From All
Over the State, Sent
by the Lodges.
The Souvenir Progranims Nearly
Ready for the Printerâ lt Will
Bo a Work of Art
The Bale of flowers is the ruling ques
tion just now among those who are
doing the most work for the Masonic
festival. Flowers will be sent into the
city from all over the State and they
will be exposed for sale at prominent
places. The idea of selling flowers came
from the out-of-town lodges. They
â wanted to send them â  , but the festi
val will he held so late in the year that
it was f<umd there would be but few of
the finer varieties in blossom. It was
then suggested that the flowers be sent
In at unce, and this will be done during
the coming week. There are some flow-
ers already for sale, but the big con
>signments will come in in the next few
days.
Mrs. W. Frank Pierce, the chairman
of i he committee on booths, received
letters yesterday from Cloverdale, Red
ding, Colusa, Healdsburg, Pacific Grove,
Neve da City, Fresno, San Diego, Gait,
Pam< 'na, Lincoln and Salinas. In each
of these places the ladies of the Eastern
Stars have determined to hold minia
ture fairs just before the coming Ma-
BOnic festival and, to send the results
of the fair in each case for the benefit
of tlie festival in San Francisco.
The ladies of Durant Lodge in
Berkeley have concluded to get up a
photographer's booth and will take
pictures at the festival day and night.
They will donate the entire receipts to
the festival.
The committee on cash donations.
headed by . .ippman Sachs, is now
busily at work gathering in such mon
eys as have been promised. John D.
Spr^ck^ls and Timothy Hopkins report
that most of the banks will donate cash
to the festival. P. C. Hale and Charles
L. Patton saw many of the Market-
Ftreet merchants yesterday and secured
many good donations.
The souvenir programme is nearly
for the press. There will be an
issu.- of 5000 struck off as a starter and
then more will be surplied as the de
mand justifies. L<>uis Roesch. chair
man of the committee which will take
charge of the distribution of the sou
venirs, had an idea that th_ Â¥ programme
will net the fund fully $4000 before the
fair is over. It will have 150 pages and
will be beautifully illustrated through
out. The cover will be printed in seven
colors and in a^ design purely Masonic.
The souvenir will contr.in the pro
gramme for the entire festival and for
all the special features, and will besides
have an exhaustive history of the home,
its aims and intentions and the need of
its work.

AN AUTOMATIC AIR BRAKE FOR STREET CARS.
A. J. Martin, who a few years ago was
a member of the Board of Fire Commis
sioners, has Invented a powerful auto
matic air brake for use on electric cars.
One of the cars of the San Francisco and
San Mateo electric line has been fitted
with the device, and for the past month
numerous tests have been made with it.
Its operation has fully come up to what
was expected of it, and railroad experts
who have seen it claim that it is by far
the best and most economical brake yet
applied to street cars. In the tests made
with it a car running at a speed of. twelve

Labor Council to Help the
New Organization of
Tailors.
The Strike of the Printers and Other
News of the Labor
Unions.
The joint committee from the three
central labor bodies having the case in
charge against the John Kelso Com
pany for violating the Federal eight
hour law on the new postofflce site held
a meeting at 1159 Mission last night.
The business agent of the Building
Trades. Harry M. Saunders. made a
brief report of what progress had
been made since the case was first in
stituted about six months ago and pre
sented a copy of Judge de Haven's de
cision, which is the first favorable de
cision ever received by a labor body
on this law.
The committee decided to thoroughly
prosecute the case and carry it to the
court of last resort it necessary. The
law provides a separate penalty for
each day on which the law is violated,
and as the job has been carefully
| watched separate charges will be
I brought for each day. The case will
be called on Tuesday, and another
meeting of the committee will be held
on Tuesday evening to take what fur
the faction it deems necessary. Each
of the central bodies will bear one
third of the expenses.
The matter of the printers' strike
was then brought up, and each mem
, ber of the committee pledged himself
to do all in his power in his respective
union to secure its fullest financial and
moral support for the printers.
The session of the Labor Council was
an unusually quiet one and very little
business out of the routine was trans
acted. A comrminication from the
Journeymen Tailors' National Union
requesting the council to do all in its
power to aid the new union in this city
was read, and after some discussion,
in which President Ellsworth of the
local union offered many valuable sug
gestions, the communication was re
ferred to the organizing committee.
Delegate Davis of the Musicians' Un
ion reported that the forty-niners had <
: engaged a non-union band to play at i
its coming picnic and a resolution waa
passed warning all members of affil
iated unions to keep away from all
picnics- where non-union music is play
j ed or beer without the label is sold.
It is expected that the trouble with
the Olympia Music Hall will be finally
i settled next Tuesday.
Local Union No. 22, Carpenters and
! Joiners, has started in on what it terms
; a series of "revival" meetings, with
! President McCarthy as chief evange
list. Nothing will be left undone to
| make the meetings as crisp and bright
as possible; long, dull speeches have
been tabooed and every effort Is be
ing made to awaken enthusiasm among
the members. Six new members were
initiated last night, and Mr. McCarthy
made one of his short speeches on the
new charter.
There were no new developments in
the printers' strike yesterday, but the
strike committee claims to have "some
thing up its sleeve" which makes their
faces bright and radiant and serves
to keep up enthusiasm to a wonderful
degree. Each day In the week some
of the strikers are securing employment
in what are designated as the "fair"
offices, and yesterday was marked with
a white stone, as three men were re
quested for one of the offices. They
were furnished at short notice. The
members of the Typothetae are just as
cheerful as the strikers, and say that
they have now entered in upon an era
of independence, and find themselves
perfectly capable of running their of
fices without the assistance of union
men. At a meeting of the bookbinders
last night $100 was donated to help the
strikers' cause, and a loan of $200 more
waÃ offered. Many of the men are of
the opinion that the strike will be end
ed within two^weeks at the furthest.
The Ohio Society.
At a largely attended meeting of the
Ohio Society held in Red Men's building
it was decided to give a reunion to thÂ»
natives of Ohio and their friends during
the coming summer, and preliminary
Bteps were taken to that end. It was de
cided that members may he admitted be
tween now and the meeting in June with
out paying the regular initiation fee.
Young Ladies' Institute.
Next Thursday evening Young Ladles'
Institute No. 1 will give a grand enter
tainment an dsocial in Native Sons' Hall,
on which occasion there will be presented
a varied programme that will be con
cluded with a one-act farce entitled "The
Two Advertisements," in which Miss Cora.
Fiske. Miss Anita Green, Miss Helen
Dixon, H. G. Leffman D. Sherin and
George Jackhn will take part. The en
are required to operate it, but instead
the air is turned on by the simple move
ment of a small handle close to the hand
of the motorman. The application of
the brake is so arranged that the car can
be brought to a sudden standstill should
the occasion warrant it, or it can be
gradually slowed down and stopped with
scarcely any perceptible jar.
One great advantage the inventor
claims for the device is that it does not
lock the wheels, no matter how hard it
is applied, and consequently overcomes
the complaint of causing flat wheels.
With the present hand brakes that the
cars are now fitted with the wheels are
locked every time the brakes are sud
tertainment will be under the direction
of Mr. Leffman.
â¢ A PATRIOTIC COMPANY.
Liverpool and London and Globe In-
surance Company Will Pay Mil
itiamen Full Salary.
A significant indication of the war feel
ing among a large and conservative class
of business men is evidenced by a letter
just received by the local manager of the
Liverpool and London and Globe Insur
ance Company.
At a recent meeting of the board of di
rectors of the company in New York it
was decided that the fullest encourage
ment should lie given to employes of the
company who are compelled to go to war.
It was decided that such as must go will
be allowed full pay while in actual serv
ice. Speaking of the matter yesterday,
the manager saJd:
"I have received official notice that our
board has already taken action on the
status of employes who go to war. I have
been instructed to notify ail who are
members of the State militia that if they
are called upon to go to war they will be
allowed full pay while hostilities last, and
their positions will be saved for them
until they return. The company has thus
taken action in advance, so as to avoid
all questions and hesitation that may
arise."
It is understood in commercial circles
that a similar course will soon be taken
by a largf number of firms, many of
whose employes are members of the
militia,
SENT TO FOLSOM
FOR EIGHT YEARS
Judge Wallace Passes Sentence
on Ex-District Attorney
Page.
The Prisoner Will Take Another
Appeal to the Supreme
Court.
Ex-District Attorney James D. Page,
who was convicted of embezzling $371)0
belonging to Louis Lichneker, an insane
j ward, was sentenced by Judge Wallace
yesterday to eight years' imprisonment
at Folsom Penitentiary.
Attorney J. N. E. Wilson, who defend
ed Page, asked for a postponement of
sentence for one week when the case was
called yesterday morning, but Judge Wal
lace refused to grant the motion. Wil
son then moved for a new trial on the
usual statutory grounds, and the motion
was promptly denied.
JudÂ«<' V* aliace said that the matter of
passing sentence had been postponed
three times at the request of defendant's
counsel and that he did not believe in
wasting any more time.
Attorney Wilson pleaded that he was
too ill to argue the points involved in the
motion, but Judge Wallace remained ob
durate.
Page wan convicted on the same charge
several years ago and sentenced to eight
years' imprisonment at San Quentin. He
appealed to the Supreme Court and was
grnnted a new trial. He was again con
victed on the second trial, but on motion
of his counsel was granted a new trial
by Judge Wallace. The third trial re
sulted in another conviction, and it was
on that judgment that sentence was
passed yesterday. A stay of execution
for ton days was granted in order to al
low Page's counsel time to perfect an
other appeal to the Supreme Court.
Father Yorke to Lecture.
A lecture â will be delivered on next Mon
| day evening in Metropolitan Hall by
| Rev. P. C. Yorke for the benefit of St.
! Joseph's Home for Deaf " Mute Children,
\ Oakland. The lecture was to have been
held some weeks ago, but was postponed
owing to absence of Father Yorke from
the city.
The institution for whose benefit it is
held is conducted by the Sisters of St
Joseph, and trains up deaf mute children
free of charge. It depends altogether on
charity for support, and relies on the
] proceeds of the coming lecture to pay off
considerable indebtedness.
The subject of Father Yorke's lecture
is "Charity." Tickets at $1 each may be
procured at room 37, Flood building, or

denly applied. â¢ The result is that, ac
cording to the statistics of the street rail
roads maintenance department, it costs
about $200 a year for each car for new
wheels and running gear that becomes
damaged through the effects of the brakes
locking the wheels. The inventor claims
that the first expense of putting his
brakes on the cars would be somewhat
heavy, but at the end of a year they
would effect a saving.
The air brake, he claims, would obviate
the necessity of placing fenders on cars
for the public safety. It is claimed .that
the cars thus fitted can be so quickly
brought to a standstill in a case of-emer
gency that accidents could be avoided.
OBJECT TO
EASTERN STONE
Local Dealers Claim to Be
Forced Into Unfair
Competition.
Trouble Threatened on the
New Building of Wells,
Fargo & Co.
Workmen Will Refuse to Set Any
Warble Cut Outside the
State.
Local marble dealers are up in arms
against a growing practice of builders
who let out their contracts to corpora
tions outside the city and State, and
have determined to make a strong fight
to keep the work here. A short time
ago the contracts for the interior mar
ble works on two large buildings were
kept here through the efforts of the
Marble Cutters' and Finishers' Associa
tion as they were on the point of being
let out to a Cincinnati firm.
This practice not only takes away the
money for the purchase of the marble,
but also necessitates bringing in work
men from the outside to set the mar
ble, as the members of the association
will not touch any marble cut and pol
ished outside the State. It is also said
that many of the Eastern firms which
local men have been fighting employ
the cheapest class of labor obtainable.
In some instances women and children
are employed, and in others the work
is done by convicts in the State prisons.
This makes the competition all the
harder as nothing but skilled labor at
good wages is employed by any of the
local concerns, yet on several large jobs
lately let there has been a difference of
less than $200 between the bids of the
San Francisco and the Eastern firms.
In the cases sufficient pressure was
brought to bear to keep the jobs at
home.
The latest contract to cause trouble
is that for the interior marble work of
the new Wells-Fargo building on Mis
sion street, which has been let out to
Mueller Brothers of Chicago. The stone
has not yet arrived, but when it does
the contractors will. In all probability,
! find it necessary to bring workmen
with them, as local men positively re
fuse to handle it. This action is also
likely to cause trouble with workmen in
all the other building: trades, as stone
cutters, bricklayers, hod-carriers, car
penters, painters and varnishers and
polishers are all organized and will re
fuse to work on the same building with
non-union men.
The following circular has been sent
out to the architects of this city by the
marble-cutters:
To the Architects of San PranciscnâGentle
men: At a regular meeting of the Marble
Cutters' and Finishers' Association, held on the
first Monday in January, 189S, the following
resolutions were parsed:
Whereas, the marble industry of California
hns long suffered from the competition of
Eastern firms and agents located In San Fran
cleco; and whereas. leÃltimate manufacturers
who pay taxes In this State are handicapped
in figuring on work which should rightly be
long In this city, through these agents who
carry their office In their hat. Therefore be It
Resolved. Tfcnt the Marble Cutters' and Fin
ishers' Association of San Francisco and vicin
ity will not set any Eastern marble that shnll
be contracted for on and after January 1, 189 S.
And be It further
Resolved, That this association does object
and will object to Journeymen plumbers set
ting or affixing marble in where It la necessary
to handle tools In connection with the marble
cutting or finishing craft.

as to the future which are somewhat too s-rlf
conndent. But it is safe to say that a sys

will renew health in the malarious, bilious,

"THE PURSER" A HIT.
A PlÂ«y Which Will Appear for
tho First Time in
A morion.
"Teddy O!" yelled the crowd at the
Sixteenth street station as the overland
drew in last evening, and immediately
afterward the expansive Bmile of one
FERRIS HARTMAN COMES HOME.
Ferris Hartman, commonly known as
the "San Francisco comedian," appear
ed at and blocked up the doorway of
the sleeper in which he and his new
company have traveled all the way
from New York to present for the first
time In America his new play, "The
Purser."
Mr. Hartman has been expected for
several days, so when George Bowles,
his partner and manager, yesterday re
ceived a telegram from the laughter
provoking Ferris, telling him he (Hart
man) would arrive in the city last
night, he was prepared to greet him in
the proper manner. Bowles went up to
Sacramento and there, with several
others, awaited the coming guest, who
arrived, for once in his life, on time.
This promptitude somewhat disconcert
ed Teddy's friends, â  who, knowing him
of old, were at a loss to account for a
proceeding so unlike his real self, and
refused to dismiss their anxiety until
Ilartman had explained that, as he had
not fallen off the train, he could not
help himself. This explanation proved
satisfactory and the entire party en
tered the car and proceeded to ex
change congratulations and other com
pliments an the train continued toward
the city, picking up a stray friend or
two at every station, until Sixteenth
street was reached, where so many of
the old Lasker crowd had gathered to
give the glad hand to their old run
ning mate that the sleeper would not
accommodate them all and several of
them had to content themselves with
a handshake and the company of Hart
man's dog, Snyder, in the baggage cah,
until the ferry was reached.
Hartman's new play, In which he will
open as the star at the Baldwin a
week from next Monday night, is called
"The Purser," and had a tremendous
run in England, where it was written
by John T. Day, a clever and wealthy
newspaper man of London. It is a high
class comedy, and tells of the trials and
tribulations of a purser on the good
ship Kangaroo, running on the P. and
<). line "from London to Australia, re
sultant on too many matrimonial ven
tures And love entanglements. It is
said by all the critics who have seen it
to be a bright, catchy piece replete with
humorous situations and sparkling dia
logues.
It was so well thought of by such com
petent Judges as the Frohmans. Al
Camby and Sam Fruedenberg that they
moved heaven and earth to get It, and
would probably have succeded were It
not for the fact that Hartman himself
went to England, where he told a funny
stofy, and waited around the clubs of
the British metropolis seven months
for the point to be seen, In order to be
come good friends with the author and
beat his rivals out In securing the en
tire American rights of the play. As
soon as he succeeded in securing the
piece he started for New York, remain
ing there just long enough to gather to
gether a flrst-clasÃ company, and con
tinued his way to San Francisco that
he might open for the first time in
America before an audience composed
of old friends.
"How did 1 like England?" said
"Teddy," when seen last night. "It's the
gn-atesi place on earthâ barring Amer
ica. The people are the most hospitable
in the world. I never saw anything
like it. They put you up at all their
clubs the minute you land, give you
a brandy and soda as big as a steam
beer, and keep on giving them to you
until you think you have struck heav
en. Talk about the hospitality of the
South â it is not in it. I once took a
show South and after three perform
ances they put me to breaking coal. I
took no show at all to London and the
people there kept me breaking bottles.
Give me London every time. You un
traveled inhabitants of the unregrener
ate West think the English are cold,
self-contained and conservative. You
never made a greater mistake in your
lives. To begin with, they are the
warmest kind of babies, every one of
them. As to being self-contained â
well, if the average Californian con
tained as much besides self as they put
away every twenty-four hours he
would soon be seeing funny things, like
Bowles here, for instance. They only
appear conservative thnmgh their ef
forts to keep all they have acquired.
They believe that, next to the Queen,
Tod Sloan is the greatest thing that
ever came over the pike, and that
America, should whip Spain, not on ac
count of the Cubans, but to avenge the
blowing up of the Maine. I was made
a member of the swellest clubs In Lon
don, and tried to requite the hospital
ity I received by telling some of Tom
Leary's best stories. Those who didn't
see the point looked politely interested,
and those who did looked bored. I
could't blame them for that. You know
what Leary is.
'*Yes, I have acquired an accent, but
I keep it for charity entertainments
when I'm liable to meet society. If I
used it with the boys along the line the
crowd would mob me. This cap I have
on is the same one I wore at Carson,
but I have the real thing in silk, with
great white wings on either side, in my
trunk and will - ear it on Saturday
afternoons when the sun is shining.
Have you seen my box coat? Of course
not, but come up to my room to-morrow
and I will show iÂ» to you. I am afraid
to wear it on the street because the
shoulders are padded and I look so
much like Sharkey in i; that I am
afraid some one will insist on giving
me a $10,000 purse which I don't de
serve.
"Seriously speaking, though I have
only been away nine months I am
mighty glad to get home. 1 have a first- !
class play and a good company and I j
have come all the way from England, j
over 6000 miles, to open in the city
where I have received so much kind
ness and where I consider I am at |
home. I would like to make a success i
anywhere as an actor, but, aside from !
professional pride. I <vant to succeed !
here and I am surÂ«, â % ith the show I |
have and the peopi'<> who are In it, I j
can't fall. I wanted to open here for
two reasons, first, because as I have
said. It is my home, and secondly be- '
cause the people of this city know what i
a good play is when they see it and i
if a piece goes her it will go anywhere. I
The critical taste of. San Francisco is
a thing recognize I by the entire pro
fession and the stamp of approval once i
won here carries much weight in other !
places."

THE SAN FEAyCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 16, 1898.
CORONER BOWS
TO THE POLICE
Under Pressure He Dis-
approves of the Verdict
of His Jury.
Declares the Decision That
Louie Wee June Was Mur-
dered an Error.
This Stand Taken on Account of Ser
geant Shea's Lengthy Report of
the Case.
The threatened trouble between the po
lice and the Coroner's office has been
averted, as Dr. Hawkins last evening j
wrote across the verdict of the jury In j
the inquest of Louie Wee June: "Not ap- I
proved." The police pronounced the
death of the Chinese cook a case of sul- |
clde at the start, and when the Coroner's
jury brought in a verdict of murder, set j
out to prove they were correct. A vo- i
luminous report was handed the Coroner j
last evening, and after reading it he be- i
came convinced that the police were cor
rect and his jury wrong.
Sergeant Shea was working- on the case
yesterday under instructions from the
upper office and interviewed even' one
connected with the death of Louie Wee
June. He made a thorough investigation
of the room In which the body of the
dead man was found and when he had
completed his research handed the report
to Dr. Hawkins.
Among the various statements which
the sergeant secured was one signed by
John E. O'Brien, the deputy Coroner, and
! Louis McGinnls, the Coroner* messen
ger, who took the body to the Morgue. In
their report they stated that the body
had been found in a small room on the
â  top floor of the Chinese theater, at Sl4
Washington street. Louie Wee June was
; lying on his bed as if asieep with two
i bullets In his breast. The revolver witli
i which he had. been shot wÂ«s on his right
?L (le J had three empty cartridges in
the cylinder. Two of these appeared to
I have been exploded recently and the
, other some time before. The statement
â  was concluded with the assertion that
the two Coroner's officials l*Ueved from
i their investigation that Louie Wee June
> had committed suicide.
In the sergeant's report there were a
: number of statements from relatives and
friends of the deceased, but the most im
portant was that of Chow Tin. the sec
ond cook of the theater. He left Louie
I ce H Ju Â»1 c at i Â°'Â° lock tlie mor n'ng before
j .is death and went to bed. At S o'clock
, he went to June's room to wake him but
received no response to his knock.' An
I hour later he returned to the room and
, when ho was unable to arouse his friend
! he notified Jang Chun Sun. one of Tim
< proprietors of the theater, and they with
I Ah Keo.. went to the room and broke open
: the floor and found the cook dead The
1 door was fastened on the inside with two
, wooden buttons, and there was no other
! lock on it. Chow Tin further stated that
the deceased cook had no enemies and be
lonsrrii to no highbinder society. He said
June had a wife and family In" China tnd
i that he had been gambling recently and
I owed considerable money.
I The statements of the other attaches of
| the theatt-r were similar to that of Chow
Tin and nothing new was found in them
Ah Kee. who was present when the door
I of the room was broken in. was a witness
! at the inquest, but Chow Tin was noV
i The latter broke in the door himself and
his testimony would have been more val
uable than that of Ah Kee. Just why
he was not called is not known. His state
i ment given to the Coroner is thoroughly
I In accord with the suicide theory of the
j police, which makes his absence at the
inquest all the more to be wondered at
With the report of the police Investlga
i tlon in his hands, there was nothing for
j Dr. Hawkins to do but to disapprove of
the verdict of his Jury, as the evidence
of suicide was conclusive. The doctor
stated last evening that he had thought
| It a suicide from tho first and that his
approval of the verdict was a mistake
When the verdicts from the various In
quests h,eld on Thursday were hand'-d
him he was In a hurry to make a cajl on
a patient, and approved them all without
reading them carefully. He had no Idea
that the jury would bring in a verdict
such as they did, and If he had notice i
it at the time he would have refused to
approve It.
DetectiveÃ Gibson and Wren are still
investigating the circumstances sur
rounding the death of Louie Wee June,
and have arrived at a conclusion that
without doubt it was a case of suicide.
Spurred on by the Coroner's Jury verdict
of murder the detectives have worked
hard on the case and alter much ques
tioning have discovered that the revolver
which was found in the hand of the Chi
nese and from which two shots had been
discharged belonged to the deceased, and
the fact, In company with others equally
strong, is accented as proof positive that
June came to his death by his own hand.
Detective Gibson stated last evening
that many Chinese who lived in the
building where the shooting took place
have stated that June always carried a
revolver, and that he was a heavy
gambler, as well as a sufferer from
stomach troubles. The police are thor
oughly satisfied with the investigations
and pronounce the case a suicide which
had long been contemplated.
NEW HOLY CROSS CHURCH.
An Entertainment Is Given in Its
Behalf at Armory Hall.
A successful entertainment in aid of
the new Holy Cross Church now in pro
cess of construction was given at Ar
mory Hall last evening under the aus
pices of the Native Sons" and Daughters'
booth of the Holy Cross Church fair. The
hall was crowded to its utmost capacity,
and upon looking over the receipts of the
evening it was found that the expense of
the erection of the new edifice will be
considerably lessened.
In addition to an interesting and en
joyable programme a dance was held
immediately after its conclusion.
The programme as rendered was as
follows: Tenor solo, William Finnic;
comic selections, John Cathcart of Olym
pic Club fame; soprano solo, Mrs. W.
Kennedy; recitation, John R. Bockman;
tenor solo, William O'Brien; recitation,
Hazel Buckley; humorous sketches, Wil
liam Nelson; bass solo, Benjamin Tar
box; solo. Miss Elsie Hall. Mrs. Dr.
Kemp Van Ec assisted as accompanist.
The floor committee consisted of Jo
seph Regan, as manager; assisted by the
following Native Sons: Peter Connolly,
Frank McGinn, Joseph Geary, John Ross,
George Olsen, James Monaghan, William
Jensen, Joseph Enright, John McDonald,
James Mulcahy and Charles Casassa.
Mrs. Charles F. Capp, chairman of the
reception committee, was assisted .by
Miss May Smith, Miss Pearl Laws, Miss
Mollie Van Pelt. Miss Nora Legane, Miss
Lela Laws, Miss Lizzie Lavery. Miss
Mamie Laden, Miss Lizzie Broderlck and

"RELIGION AND
PATRIOTISM"
Father McKinnon Speaks of the
Position of the Church on
Things Temporal.
Successful Entertainment t>y Pormla
Council, Younj Men's Insti
tute.
A very pleasant entertainment was
given by Portala Council No. 70, T. M.
1., in St. Joseph's Hall, last night. The
chief feature of the entertainment was
a lecture on "Religion and Patrioism,"
by the Rev. William D. McKinnon of
Suisun.
The exercises opened with an over
ture by Clancy's orchestra, after which
the president of the council, D. T. Pow
ers, made a few introductory remarks.
This was followed by vocal solos by
Miss N. Farrell, John Braiton. Miss
Kittle Hopkins and M. O'Connell, and
a trombone solo by George Gardner, a]}
of which were well rendered.
Father McKinnmi's address was most
Interesting and instructive, as he clear
ly defined the relative positions of the
church and Government in this coun-
try. He said in part:
In every country patriotism is a sacred
duty of every citizen. In America It is a
duty thrice sacred; it is a solemn duty of
conscience, a solemn duty to God. Re
ligion and patriotism are one and insepa
rable. It is impossible for one to exist
without the other.
The church has no civil or political au
thority, power, jurisdiction or pre-emi
nence whatever in these United States
and never claimed to have any. In tem
poral matters American Catholics recog
nize no power as sovereign but the Con
stitution of these United States, and
their religious principles render them but
more resolved to discharge fully their
duties as citizens.
The Catholic doctrine and American
Constitution, with regard to church and
state, are In perfect harmony. Catholics
In following this doctrine, have ever
proved their worth and loyalty in every
vicissitude of the republic. In peace or
in war their contributions to the nation's
weal have been generous.
The reverend lecturer called attention to
the assistance rendered by Catholic coun
tries in the darkest hour of our revolu
tionary struggle. He said that while he
did not claim that Catholics, native jr
foreign, made the revolution, yet that his
tory would bear him out in the assertion
that were it not for the Catholic blood
talent and treasure contributed to our
independence 1 , the "Union Jack," and not
the "Stars and Stripes." would now be
floating over this fair land.
VERMONTERS ENTERTAIN.
Present a Play at Odd Fellows' Hall
Called "A Mexican Romance."
The regular monthly entertainment of
tho Native Sons of Vermont, which was
postponed on account of Good Friday,
was held last evening in Odd Fellows'
Hall, proving as usual a success.
"A Mexican Romance," a romantic
play in three acts, was presented and
differed perceptibly from the usual ama
teur theatrical In being better acted and !
staged. The scenery depicting many of i
the sights of beauty in and around Mcx- i
leo, was exceptionally good and would !
have done credit to one of our largest i
playhouses.
The dramatis personae were as follows- !
Captain Jack Wilding, U. S. A., Bert i
Morrison; Pompey (his servant). Stephen i
Andrews; Major Montague-Headway, U. ,
S. A., Reginald Travels; iHajul' juau
Manoel, M. A., Geoff ry Denlston; Ser
geant Jackson, IT. S. A., Warren King-
Sentinel Murray, U. S. A., Robert Glea
son; Markiuita Talamance, Miss Freda
Gallich; Mrs. General Darcy, Miss Effle
Bond.
The entertainment was opened with an
overture by . Dellepia.nc's orchestra. The
attendance was unusually large and in
fact there was not an empty chair in the
entire hull.

Rev. Herbert Parrish, late of the St.
Clement Church, Philadelphia, arrived in
this city last evening, and will soon act
as rector of the Epfscopal Church of St.

A Democratic Meeting
The meeting of the Citizens' Democratic
party at Pythian Castle last night was
anything but harmonious. The meeting
was called by cnairman James O'Connor
for the purnose of canvassing i..c political
situation. The first discordant note was
sounded when T. C. Spelling moved that
the list of names presenteu a.t the last
meeting be used as a roll to show who
were entitled to vote, as it was charged
that a number of outsiders were present.
The chairman refused to recognize the
roll, and a lively discussion ensued. Pin
ally a motion was carried appointing a
lommittee, consisting of \V. F. Hum-
Sl Xl T- J - Glvnn - Charles McCarthy,
H. M. Kelly and Frank Foley, to confer
with the State Central Committee, with
a view to receiving recognition.
AN OLD WRECK
IS RELOCATED
Diver Keefe Thinks He
Has Found the City
of Chester.
Nine Well Known British
Ships Have Passed Under
the German Flag.
Arrival of "King" Greig of Fanning
Island on Another Visit to
This City.
What are supposed to be the remains of
the steamer City of Chester have been
located off Black Point. There is only
fifteen feet of water over them at low
tide, and in order to prevent a possible
accident they should be buoyed. The en
gines and boilers stand on end, and a
dozen jagged ends stick up out of the
mass. A vessel striking on one of them
would be Instantly pierced, and would
probably sink before she could 6e
beached.
Some time ago the barkentine J. M.
Griffiths arrived from Port Hadlock and
anchored off Meiggs wharf. During the
I northwester she lost her anchor and sev
| eral attempts have been made to recover
It, but they all failed. The next vessel
to lose an anchor In the same vicinity
was the barkentine Ruth, which came in
| from Honolulu with a load of sugar. For
j several days past men have been draggles
for both these mud hooks, and yesterday
one of them was located. A diver named
Keefe grappled it with a four-inch line,
but whenever the tug Redmond began to
haul on it the grapping iron slipped.
Keefe put on his suit and went down
only to find that Instead of an anchor he
had located an immense mass of iron.
Had the wrecker Whitelaw not gone up
In smoke at Skaguay he would have kept
his find to himself until she could have
got to work on It, but as there Is nothing
suitable on the coast to save the remains,
he thought it better to have them buoyed.
A few hours after the remains of the
Chester had been found the Griffiths' an
chor was located and hauled aboard the
tug, after which the search for the Ruths
am-hor was continued.
It was about eleven years ago that the
steamers Oceanic, bound in from China,
and the City of Chester, bound for Puget
Sound, were in collision off Lime Point,
and the Chester sank, drowning many
of her passengers. If the wreckage has
been located by Diver Keefe, it must have
drifted a considerable dtstance during the
past years.
G. Lagomarslno, rt 3520 Sacramento
street, had a narrow escape from death I
yesterday. He was thrown out of his coal
wagon and the vehicle passed over him.
He was taken to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital, where Drs. Deas and Dlggins
found that his left arm was broken in
three places, his right arm in one and two
of his ribs were also fractured. After
his injuries hftd been attended to he was
taken to his home.
Germany is rapidly Increasing its fleet
of sailing vessels at the expense of the
British mercantile marine. At the present
time there are live vessels awaiting wheat
cargoes in the Columbia River, and three
of these fly the German flag. The Ger
man ship Barmbek, which sailed recently
from Astoria, was formerly the British

formerly under the British flag. The four-r
masted hark Xnrma was formerly the

the Maulesden, the Kmelie was formerly
the British Ambassador, the Willkomenn
was formerly the Dawpool. the Henrietta
was formerly the Strathearn, the Adolf

Plluger was formerly the Walkato. Thus
nine vessels that for years came to San
Francisco under the British flag are now
coming here under the German.
The launch Yale, which sank at Folsom
street wharf a couple of days ago, was
taken to the Fulton Iron Works last
night. An examination showed that when
she was lowered from the Morgan City
Into the water her seacock was open and
that the two exhaust pipes had been dis
connected.
About a dozen carrier pigeons were sent
aboard the Monterey yesterday for Lieu
tenant McDonald. They will be eventually
taken to Mare Island and there trained
so that when released from one of the
warships at sea they will return to their
dove cote at the navy yard.
Dr. N. M. Nelson, who for a time was
connected with the Harbor Receiving
Hospital, died at the Lane Hospital yes
terday. He had suffered for a long time
from a spinal complaint, and two opera
tions were performed, but without any
beneficial result.
After many years of active life at sea
Captain J. S. Dolllver,Â«of the pilot service,
has retired. His wife has been urging
him for some time past to retire, and to
please her, he finally sent in his resigna
tion a few days ago. It is said that "Ad
mirnl" yon Schmidt, the well-known mas
ter mariner and yachtsman, will take his
place. In that event the Whirlwind will
not be seen in many of the yachting
events on the bay this season.
Victor Morlna was run over early yes
terday morning by one ot the belt rail
road engines and seriously Injured. At
the Harbor Receiving Hospital It was
found necessary to amputate his leg. He
was clambering into one of the cars when
the train started and threw him under
the wheels.
The schooner Falcon arrived ffom the
southern seas last evening. Among her
passengers was "King" Grelg of Fanning
Island, and his wife and child. The
"King" is on his yearly visit to his son,
who is at school in Alameda. This is the
first occasion on which his wife has ac
companied him. Mr. Grieg's father died
here in San Francisco a. few years ago,
and his body was sent to Fanning Island
for interment.
The coast defense steamer MonadnocU

A LIBRARY FOR SALE.
The Odd Fellows' Collection to Be
Sold BefoiVthe Ist of June.
The Odd Fellows' library, containing
45,000 volumes, is now being disposed of
at private sale, and by the Ist of next
June the entire collection will be taken
from the shelves upon which they rested
so long.
The library Is the oldest on the Pacific
Coast and was established by the Odd
Fellows in 1855. - : that time there were
few reading rooms in the city, and such
as existed were very unsatisfactory.
To provide for a suitable library, about
$500 was appropriated for the purpose,
and in a short time the library numbered
500 books. The experiment met with
favor, and in 1860 the library, by means
of donations and purchases, had nearly
S*X)O volumes. Since that time the library
has grown steadily, so that two weeks
ago, when it was closed forever, in the
neighborhood of 45.000 books lined the
walls. ,
The library, while complete in every
branch of literature, is especially rich In
Kb collection of early voyages and writ
ings concerning New Spain, Mexico, Cali
fornia and the Pacific Coast generally.
Many of these books are exceedingly rare
and some of them are to be bought no
where else.
The Free Public Library has thus far
b*>en the heaviest purchaser. During tho
pust two weeks it has secured $2000 worth
of valuable reference works.
Outside of the heavy purchases made
by the city very few sales of any import
ance have so far been made.
Boycott on Disreputable Houses.
The police have established a boycott on
the houses of Tillie Belmont and Mollio
Woodward on Mason street, between
Eddy and Ellis. The women have refused
to leave the houses, and warrants will
probably be Issued to-day for the arrest
.of all the occupants.
CLEVER OTTS
WON THE FIGHT
Referee Lawler Gives
Him a Decision Over
Hughey Dougherty.
Furious and Scientific Eight-
Round Bout at the Excelsior
Athletic Club.
With One Eye Closed Dougherty
Makes a Gritty and Deter
mined Stand.
"Touse fellys wot pay tree plunks to
see big guys punch, ain't getting yer
moneys wurt. Yer want to come out
of the cable if yer want to see real
fight," said a sage at the Excelsior
Athletic exhibition last night.
The rough criticism was about right.
It Is seldom that the big events prove
as exciting as the eight-round go be
tween Billy Otts of the Excelsior Club
and Hughey Dougherty of Chicago. For
eight rounds the many hundred spec
tators were treated to a scientific,
gritty and furious bout, and when little
Billy Otts, the pride of his club, was
declared winner by Referee Lawler, he
was worshiped.
Although inexperienced In ring gen
eralship Otts proved himself a clever
and willing fighter, while Dougherty's
ability to swallow punishment won the
admiration of everybody. With his left
optic completely closed, bleeding from
nose and mouth, the gritty representa
tive of the Windy City stayed with his
cleverer opponent returning blow for
blow, landing some, but missing many.
At the call of time Otts began to
launch his left with telling effect.
Dougherty would respond, but with lit
tle effect, as the former's blows came
with a rush. The round closed in Otts'
favor.
In the second the Excelsior lad set a
merry pace, and soon had Dougherty
blowing and bleeding. He gamely took
his grueling and landed many stiff
rights on Otts' jaw, cooling his ardor.
As the round came to a close, Otts
planted two heavy lefts on the jaw and
a right on the wind without a return.
The third round proved even faster.
Dougherty was surprised at Otts'
showing and began to mix things, and
for the first two minutes he had the
native son on the move, but an encour
aging word sent Otts at the visitor with
stinging left facers, and he soon had
Dougherty dizzy.
During the next three rounds of the
bout Otts forced the pace and often
had his man groggy, but Dougherty's
ring experience and crouching attitude
saved him.
Dougherty's bad eye proved a handi
cap to him in the last two rounds. He
tried to land his right time and again
but Otts' head would move to one side,
the blow going over the shoulder. Both
boys stood In the center of the ring,
giving blow for blow, at a pace that
did the hearts of old ring-goers good.
At the conclusion of the bout Otts
was as fresh as a newly picked flower.
Otts weighed in at 129 and Dougherty
at 128.
Previous to the event of the even-
Ing, Billy Qulnn and Jack Cranfleld.
William Vamlet and Joe Kane; Henry
Smith and Joe Kennedy boxed three
round goes. Vamlet proved a new
comer and a hummer. The way he
warmed Joe Kane's sides created favor
able comment. The only Jack Holland
sang his Italian ditty and Pat Casey
"recited a recitation."
Sergeant Brophy and his assistants
handled the large crowd splendidly and
nothing disturbed the harmony of the
evening.
SHOT IN SELFOEFENSE.
Charles W. Dunn Acquitted on the
Charge of Murder.
Charles W. lninn was yesterday ac
quitted by Judge Conlan on the charge
of murder. The Judjre held that from
the evidence L unn acted in self-defense,
and was satisfied that no Jury would
convict him.
Dunn was night bartender in a saloon
at Jones and O'Farrell streets and in the
early morning of March 11 D. W. Per
grin, an Englishman, was in the saloon
and was in a lighting humor. He abused
the Americans and struck a man named
Chrystal twice on the face. "When Dunn
interfered Pergrin seized a large beer
glass, and was in the act of throwing it
at Dunn when he fixed the shot that later
proved fatal.
Sentence of Tauchi Postponed.
The passing of sentence on Kamikichi
Tauchi, a Japanese, convicted of murder
in the sfecond degree, for having shot and
killed Mary Costillla, a white woman
with whom he had been living, was post
poned in judge Wallace's court yesterday
until next Friday. y

"Whereas, A petition has been
flied and is now pending before the
Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., at
San Francisco, Cal., seeking to
have moved landwards pierhead
lines in the Oakland harbor as es
tablished about five years ago by
the Federal Government, the effect
of which change would be to put
new pierhead lines and all wharves
and landings solely upon land
claimed by t Water Front Com
pany, leaving no free water front
age or landing place under the con
trol of the public as Is now the case
under the decision of the Supreme
Court of the State of California, as
it now stands:
solved. That this body views
proposed change with great
alarm, as against the public inter-
. gainst the growth of Oakland
ami the rig.Â»t of the city and the
whole public; and this body does
most strongly protest against any
change "f pierhead lines, the effect
of whicn would be to limit wharves,
Its, piers or landing places to
territory clal: d in private owner
;i:us taking the dominion and
control of the city front out of the
hands of the public and putting it
in the hands of individuals, or of
a private corporation organized for
profit. And this body protests
against any change of harbor lines
the effect of which would be to
diminish the area of water front
now under public control; and be
it further
"Resolved, That the officers and
directors of this body be and they
are hereby directed to appear at the
hearing of said petition in support
of this resolution and to oppose any
change of pierhead lines."
A special meeting of the Board of Trade
xrns held this morning to consider what
Fteps should be taken relative to the at
tempt to change the pierhead lines along
the water front. This Question to take
the water front controversy out of the
hands of the Supreme Court and to work
through the United States engineer's of
fice is considered to be of primary im
portance-, and at the meeting next Mon
day in San Francisco there will be many
arguments presented on behalf of this
city? interest.
Attorney Lair Hill, who has had a large
Fhare in representing Oakland's side In
the litigation, explained to the directors
how the petition of Brock & Co. to have
the pierhead lines changed would affect
the city's right.
Councilman Pringle, who was present,
paid: "This move is nothing more nor
less than an effort of the Water Front
pany to get around the decision giv
ing us a right to the water front. It will
need an enort on our part to get the en
gineers to decide in our favor. The Board
of Trade should send a delegation Id the
meeting on Monday."
A suggestion having been made in favor
of calling a mass meeting to protest
ne.iinst the import of the petition, the
matter wan discussed, but the board de
. i'led that little was to be gained by such
a general demonstration and that a "strong
protest backed by sound argument before
the United States Engineers would be the
letter plan. The resolution already quot
ed was then passed unanimously.
The Ordinance and Judiciary Committee
or the City Council has decided that it
â will be better to countenance the appear
ance of the special attorneys for the city
at Monday's meeting. The matter was
discussed by the committee last night
and on the representation of Mr. T'pton
:he attorneys are willing to appear
without compensation, it was decided to
Include the words "without compensa
tion" in the resolution and recommend its
adoption. Although this resolution will
not he acted upon by the City Council
until next night, when the con
ference in the engineers' office will have
closed, it is significant inasmuch as it
shows that several o. the Councilmen who
voted against it last Monday night have
been forced by the pressure of public
opinion and general protest to change
their votes. There is no doubt that in
accordance with the spirit 01 the resolu
tion as recommended, the city's attorneys
will be present.

POOLROOMS
NOT ILLEGAL
Judge Allen Annuls the
Law Prohibiting
Them.
The Head of the Ordinance Is
Not Harmonious With
the Body.
Nothing to Prevent Open Pool-Sell
ing Now in All the Cigar
*Storea.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 15.
When the Supreme Court declared that
the Stratlon primary law was unconsti
tutional because the title and the body
of the act did not agree they made It pos
sible for poolrooms to be at once opened
In Oakland and run without fear of mo
lestation by the police.
This morning Judge Allen declared the
famous anti-poolroom ordinance, which
was passed after the bitterest agitation
ever seen In this city, in 1592, to be In
valid on the ground that the title of the
measure did not correspond with its va
rious sections. As a result of this decis
ion the raid on the pool-sellers made
several weeks ago is without effect, and
D. P. Clark. A. D. Dennis, W. Wolfsohn
and C. McPiale were discharged in the
Police Court and the charges against
them were dismissed.
There is now no bar to the opening of
poolrooms In this city and conducting
them "wide open," unless the City Coun
cil should amend the ordinance and make
its head and tail agree. This is more
than is expected from the "solid six,"
and undoubtedly there will bo a great
anti-poolroom campaign inaugurated at
once.
Attorney T. M. Bradley, who repre
sented the pool-sellers in the Police
Court, moved tor a dismissal on the
ground that the title of the ordinance
under which the arrests were made did
not mention specifically that the receiv
ing of money to bet on races was pro
hiuited, while In the body of the article
such prohibition iÂ« ordained. He says
his client only received money to bet on
races for other parties.
A. A. Moore Jr., representing the Dis
trict Attorney";* oflice, while admitting
that Mr. Bradley's point might be well
tukin, asked for a continuance of a few
days to look the matter up. Attorney
Bradley insisted on an immediate " de
cision, and Judge Allen declared the or
dinance void and discharged the defend
ant.
The title of the ordinance reads: "An
ordinance prohibiting In certain places
within the city of Oakland the selling of
pools or making of beis or wagers on
contest between men or between horses,
wherein money or other articles of value
are staked or played."
In the ordinance Is the following sec
tion, upon which the pool-sellers base
their argument:
No person upon any trial or contest of skill,
speed or power of endurance, between men, or
â  between horseÂ». shall, within the limits of the
city ot Oakland, Bell, issue or dispose of any
ticket, certificate or other evidence of payment,
on which -shall be Inscribed, written marked
or printed any number, name, word, mark or
! device to desiunate the choice selected, received
or accepted by any other person to entitle or
enable the said person holding the ticket, cer
tificate or other evidence of payment to galfc
or lose on any contingent Issue; or receive any
article of value or any money or anything rep
resenting money, or any articule of value, as
a bet, wager or hazard upon the event of any
contest or contingent stake, or an a stake or
pledge between two or more parties or to dis
burse the said money or any portion thereof or
anything representing money ur other article
of value upon any representations or condition
or tn any conformity to or with any express or
tacit understanding or agreement.
When ex-Chief Lloyd made his raid on
the pool-sellers he stated that pool-sell
ing was being conducted on such a vl-
Eplan and In so many places that
ren not over H years of age of both
i were being taught to gamble and
putting up even as low as a dime
on the chances of horses. There Is no
doubt that the moral slue of the question
will receive immediate attention, and
there are many who think that Judge
Allen rendered his decision on a point
smaller than will be recognized should
the case be appealed to a higher court.

OAKLAND, April 15.â The Eureka So

HARMONY PREVAILS.
A New Lease of Life for the Young
Men's Republican League.
OAKLAND, April 15.â The Young Men's
Republican League took on a new lease
in its career to-night, and it is now be
lieved that harmony Is assured and that
within a few weeks the league will have
1000 enrolled members. President Breed
opened the proceedings with a very strong
statement of the position of the club with
regard to the two candidates for Gover
nor in this city. "After all that has been
said by unauthorized parties, ir ,'"said the
president. "I feel that a statement Is ab
solutely necessary at this time to place
the club in a truthful position before the
party In Alameda County. I brand as
I false and unauthorized any statement
that declares this league has indorsed or
is working in the interest of any candi
date for any office. This falsehood has
been freely circulated, and although we
have received Tair treatment from the
I press, the rumor has not yet been suffi
ciently exploded. After the convention
we win get behind all the Republican
candidates and work with all our might,
but not until then. Now, it is our pur
pose to build up a strong party organi
zation, loyal to Republicanism, but hot
to individuals striving for nominations."
This declaration was louuly cheered, and
some very kind things were said about
those who belonged to the league two
years ago but who have not yet joined the
ranks. Everything that was said in the
discussion that followed looked to har
mony, and anything that might be con
strued as inimical to those who are sup
posed to be in the Pulcifer camp was
carefully avoided. Charles Hall spoke of
the struggle between the candidates for
Governor, and said that the County Com
mittee should take the matter in hand
and should end the fight. : â¦
Mr. Knowles said that if Alameda did
not soon end her quarrel she would find
that Mr. Flint take the matter had hand

astically. Many other speeches were

At the close of the meeting it was found
that nearly 400 had signed Lie roll. Coffee
and sandwiches were generously pro

of an agreement entered Into by the par
ties JanuaiV 5, 1897. The parties are
living apart and have for some time, but
the husband has paid $75 per month for
the support of his wife and two chil
dren.
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor were married in
Oarfleld, Colo., October 9, ISB9, and have
two childrenâ Ethel A., aged 14. and
Frederick E., aged 10 years. Owing to
their inability to live together peacea
bly they drew up an agreement to sep
arate, the wife to have the care and
custody of the children. The husband
agreed to pay his wife $50 per month for
maintenance, and Charles A. Bailey, as
trustee, $25 per month, until the Berke

all his rights to the property.
It is alleged In the complaint that he
is now behind $1203, and it is this which
the wife seeks to recover in her suit.

Only Visited Mrs. Rojas

Denies the Allegation That He
Was Caught Kissing
the Lady.
Alvarado's Dlvorco Cnso May Be
tho Cause of a Lively-
Trial.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 15.
"When the divorce case of the Rojases
comes up in Judge Hall's courtroom there
will probably be a lively trial. Philip H.
Aston, whose name appears in the com
plaint, says that only one side of the
story has yet been told. The case has
excited much interest in Alvarado, where
the parties live, and has been a fruitful
theme for gossip for several months, both
parties to the controversy apparently
having many friends.
"I have been brought into this case on
false representations," Bald Mr. Aston.
"The facts are as follows: Rojas deserted
his wife on September 3 of last year, after
he beat and abused uer most shamefully.
Mrs. Rojas was at that time in destitute
circumstances, and, in fact, had not the
necessaries of life. On the day mentioned
Mrs. Rojas had him arrested for battery,
to which charge he pleaded guilty and
paid his fine. The poor lady came to me
in her great trouble for assistance, and
askeu me to give her my washing to
help her to sustaJn life for her three
children. I gave her work, and never
visited her till December 13, when I went
to her house about half-past 8 In the
evening to pay her. We were sitting in
the kitchen and talking together, when
Mr. Rojas rushed in and accused me of
kissing his wife, and abused her shame
fully. After considerable talking I left
for my home. I again yisited Mrs. Rojas
on December 17 to get a vest which I had
sent her that day for repairs. Rojas
again entered the house and raised a dis
turbance, but there was no fighting or
thrashing at these times. One night in
February ho waylaid me in the dark and
hit me unawares on the head, in a public
street, for which I had him arrested. Mrs.
Rojas is highly respected by all the good
people of this town, ajid they are now
helping her by giving her work; but I
cannot say the same for Mr. Rojas. When
the case comes up before Judge HaJl on
April 25 tne rest of this story will be
made public-^

GUARDIAN IN TROUBLE.
Gave Possession of Property Before
Authorized by the Court.
OAKLAND, April 15.â The guardian of
Mary Peterman, an incompetent, has
placed himself in a peculiar predicament.
Last Monday the sale of certain prop
erty was up for comf.rmation by the
court. One of the family had bid $2000,
but this was run up to $2425 by an out
sider. The court found the bidder had
no coin up. so refused to make the or
der until $500 was produced, and continued
the case until evening, then until Tues
day and finally until to-day, as no cash
came into court.
The bidder, however, who resides near
the guardian, at Haywards. paid the full
price Monday afternoon, and was given
possession. When the case was called
to-day a new bid of $2500 was offered.
The guardian's attorney objected and
made the explanation given here, but the
court refused to allow it, and confirmed
the new bid. The next move is awaited
with interest, as the court said the par
ties in possession had no title, the guard
lan having no authority to act without
the court's order..

There was a clergyman in a Long Island village who suf-
fered from dyspepsia to such an extent that it positively seemed
sometimes as though his doctrine was not sound. It was, however,
only a stomach trouble, and had nothing to do with the mind.
Being convinced of this, one of his parishioners, a lady, presented
him with a small quantity of Ripans Tabules and the relief he ex-
perienced was such that all the congregation noticed an improve-
ment, and now, although his salary is small, this clergyman and
his wife devote a portion of it to keeping the medicine closet
stocked with a suitable supply of Ripans Tabules. Doubtless
there are many cases where what has been thought heresy was in
fact nothing more nor less than dyspepsia, and Ripans Tabules euro
dyspepsia. One gives relief.

THE DOCTORS
A Little Ruse That Shows He
Has Intervals of Common
Sense.
Experts Disagree in Court and More.
Are Sent For to Unravel
the Tangle.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 18.
J. W. Lynn is causing the doctors and
officials and an army of witnesses a
great deal of trouble. Some declare he
is Insane, others declare he Is not, and
several are doubtful. For three hours
this afternoon Lynn was before Judge
Ogden while a judicial examination was
conducted as to his sanity.
As he was being conducted from the
insane ward to the courtroom a little in
cident occurred that tended to shake the
faith of some in Lynn's insanity. The
Chief of Police had planned a little ruse
that worked to his entire satisfaction.
He had several officers present and as
Lynn was going up the steps the Chief
said: "If this man jroes off Into one of
those struggling fits, just beat him haif
to death: don't waste any strength
wrestling with him."
This order seemed to have the effect
of renderlnir Lynn very sane, for he
turned to Chief Fletcher and said very
rationally, "If that's the way you are
going to treat me. I won't go." Ordi
narily .Lynn does not notice any conver
sation.
The case has now reached the interest
ing stage where doctors disagree.
"Lynn is crazy," swear Drs. Rabe and
"Lynn is sane." swear Drs. Rucker and
J. P. Dunn. And the court is in doubt.
After examining many witnesses, it
was decided to send for Dr. Hatch of
Sacramento and the physicians at Ag
news, where Lynn was employed, all of
whom will testify as experts. The casÂ«
was continued until to-morrow morning.
This is the most protracted insanity trial
ever held in this county, and bids fair to
be the most expensive.
The banana is said to be the most pro
lific of all food products, being forty-four
times more productive than potatoes and

MORE TROUBLE
FOR GOLD BUG
The Short-Legged Run
ner Won a Dash and
Caused Commotion.
The Talent Confronted With
Perplexing Problems at
Oakland.
Ojat Downed a Field of Youngster*.
Rubicon Caused Trouble for
th<s Books.
There was one race declfled at Oak
land yesterday, that caused considera
ble confusion. It was the opening
live and a half furlong scramble, the
"doggiest" event of the card. Gold
Bug won, and whenever the short
legged sprinter scores there is always
trouble brewing. The last time out
Gus Wilson rode him, and he showed
nothing. Yesterday the ex-hurdle rider,
Bob Cairns, had the mount, and at one
time the ring laid 15 to 1 about him.
Just before the horses were called to
the post, a colored trainer by the name
of Lee attempted to give the horse a
"shot," but was caught with the goods
on, and later was ruled off. At any
rate. Gold Buy was played down to
sevens, and In a drive beat Tom Smith
a length. Then the purse was pro
tested on the ground that the winner
was not eligible to start, having won
a race at Kanta Ana some time last
fall. While th^ officials were racking
their brains over the muddle, those in
on the know were cashing their tickets.
The racing throughout was most or
dinary, of the favorites served up but
two were successful in taking purses.
The season Is drawinp to a close and
lirst choices are a dangerous propo
sition.
In the four-furlonK gallnp for two
year-olds OJai. against which 7 to 1 was
once obtainable, out footed his field,
winning easily from Canace. Sweet
Cakes the favorite, was third.
The Blx-furlong sellfn<r sprint next de
cided resulted in a handy win for Va
lencienne. The St. Carlo filly was sec
ond choice in the hotting to Good
Friend, and taking the front position
In the stretch won ridden out from the
favorite. uffK-ial was a good third.
The mile and a sixteenth run was a
windfall for Paul Pry. The ring laid
6 to 5 against the chestnut horse and
he won easily from Robair, corning on
from fourth position. In a hard drive
the 40 i. i shot Metaire secured show
honors filhm Twinkle Twink.
The wise play sent Rubicon to the
post favorite for the second six-fur
lon; run. Mr-Light opened favorite,
but did not receive the caucus nomi
nation, receding to twos. Rubicon led
Throughout, and driving at the finish
got the verdict over Oddson a neck.
McLisrht, away from the post poorly,
v. as third.
The final mile selling run went to
Th"lma. Burko's mare sot all the best
of the start, and backed from 6 to 1
down to 7 to 2, was never headed, lead
ing out the 7 to 5 favorite, Refugee, by
four lengths.
TRACK NOTES.
The win of Valencienne wm not a source of
murh income to W. L. Stanfleld. The filly was
bid up $400 over her entered selling price by A.
Barrera.
A Hunter, the owner of Gold Bug. claims
that his hnrse did not win a purse at Santa
Ana, whirh would disqualify him in yes.ter
day's race, but merely a private sweepstakes.
The matter is being Investigated.
Tholma changed hands after winning the
final race of the day. The brown mare was
entered to be sold for S2'X\ and when boosted
to $600 by Tom Boyle, trainer, John Glvens let
her so.
The entry of Song; and Dance -will be re
fused In future at Oakland. The horse Is a
sulker.
The showing made by Lost Girl in her races
has not met with the approval of the judges.

The son of a wealthy Boston merchant, who has twice, during the first year of
his married iife, had his wife torn from his arms and has twice regained her after
spending a fortune in the search that has extended from ocean to ocean.
half a continent; has doggedly pursued
the quest from ocean to ocean and has
expended a fortune in the hire of the
best detectives In the land to continue
the search that ended two days igo
at a tumble-down farm house on a
wind-swept ranch in the foothills of

Such is a brief outline of a tragic ro
mance in real life that has no equal in
the works of modern fiction.
The name of the central figure in the
v/cncVrful succession of even f s is, or
rather was. Miss F. G. Clark. Sho is
the youngest daughter of the late Alvan
C CMark, the celebrated astronomer and
lenÃ maker of Cambridge, Mass., who
reared for himself In California an en
during monument in the lens of the
great Lick telescope. Her husband is
Sumner R. Hollander, the son of one
of the wealthiest and most highly re
spected families in the State of Mas
sachusetts. By the terms of her father's
will Mrs. Hollander 1b an heiress in her
own right to a fortune of a quarter of
a million dollars. If the solemn as
sertions of the young couple are to be
believed thin munificent bequest, dic
tated by paternal love, is the chief fac

seared and blackened the first year of
their married life.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 16, 1898.
tiful bride 1b the final Incident In a
series of events sufficiently strange and
thrilling to touch the most hardened
heart. All doubts and uncertainties
will be for the moment blotted out by
thiÃ happy reunion amongr strangers,
In a strange city, thoue-.i'ids of miles
from home and friends.
Scarcely more than a year ago Sum
ner Hollander, then a young college Btu
dent, and Miss Clark, who was one of
the petted belles of Cambridge society,
met and fell in love with each other.
With the impulsiveness of youth they
decided upon an elopement and
secret marriage rather than be
subjected to the delay incident
to the formality of securing pa
rental consent to their uninn. To
conceive was to act, and with happy
disregard for future consequences the
young couple repaired to a near-by vil
lage and were married by a minister
who was sufficiently discreet not to ask
unpleasant questions.
For three months the marriage was
kept a profound secret, then the young
couple braved parental wrath and gave
their secret to the world. Having re
ceived the forgiveness of their parents
and the congratulations of their friends
the happy husband and wife settled
down to the enjoyment of a life un
shadowed by any warning of future
sorrow. Fpr three weeks they lived
', in happy contentment. Then came the
death of the bride's father, Alvan G.
Clark, an event that was heralded in
the press of two continents. This oc
curred on June 9, 1897, a date that
marked the turning point in the cur
rent of two lives. Since that time hap
piness has been a stranger to the Hol
lander household.
Alvan Clark died a wealthy man.
When his will was read it was found
that he had made a small bequest to
one of his two older daughters. The
other he disinherited. To Mrs. Hollan
der, his youngest and favorite daugh
ter, he bequeathed $20,000 outright, be
sides the sum of $200,000 to be held in
trust for her for a period of ten years,
at the expiration of which period the
money was to be hers unconditionally.
By a provision of the will it was stipu
lated that if Mrs. Hollander died with
out issue before the expiration of the
ten-year period the money was to re
vert to the two remaining sisters, share
and share alike.
It is claimed by both Mr. and Mrs.
Hollander that as soon as the provis
ions of the will became known the two
elder sisters, both of whom are married,
manifested a deep and absorbing intor
est in the welfare of Mrs. Hollander.
The husband and wife go still further
than this and charge the two older sis
ters and their husbands with being di
rectly responsible for all that has since
occurred in the succession of startling,
almost tragic, events now to be so hap
pily terminated.
As already stated these events began
with the death of Alvin Clark and the
reading of his will. At this time Mrs.
Hollander was happy In the hope that
before the end of the year she would
present her husband with a living
pledge of her love and devotion, and
an heir to the fortune willed to her In
trust by her father. This hope was
blasted by means that may only be
hinted at here.
For weeks the young wife's life was
despaired of, and it was only by the
most careful nursing and the atten
tion of the most skilled physicians that
she was dragged back to life from the
brink of the grave. Then one day be
fore Mrs. Hollander had yet recovered
her health and strength her husband
returned home to find that his
wife had disappeared, leaving no trace
behind. From the homes of friende
and acquaintances the search for her
was extended to surrounding towns
and cities, but all to no purpose. The
young wife had disappeared as com
pletely as If the earth had swallowed
her.
Her . husband, crazed with ; grief and
anxiety, {was not .to be comforted. 'His
father, whose . heart â  had , been won Iby
the young wife's charming : personality
agd who, spoked upon her Â»<| ogo of hj^
own children, placed his fortune at the
disposal of his eon In pursuing the
search for the missing wife. The best
detectives in Boston and New York
were employed to aid in the quest, they
being ordered to proceed with the ut
most secrecy and discretion.
After weary weeks of suspense, of
> unfruitful clews and false alarms came
news that gladdened tho hearts of the
young husband and the members of his
family. The wifo had been found. She
had been found, but not as had been
' supposed, in Borne place of involuntary
' detention in one of the great cities of
! the East, but in a lonely farm house
1 that forma a minute dot on the llmit
! less expanse of the prairies of North
Dnkota, far from the haunts of civ
! lllzatlon.
Three days after this intelligence was
i flashed over the wires to the home in
j Boston husband and wife were clasped
lin each other's arms in the dingy
i living room of the weather-beaten
I farmhouse, the detectives standing
| guard to see that no unfriendly hand
or voice marred the momentary hap
piness of the reunion. The explana
tions that followed will be told fur-
ther along in the words of Mr. Hollan
der himself.
A happy home coming followed this
Joyous meeting on the bleak reaches of
the Dakota prairie. Then came a brief
period of comparative tranquillity that
was marred only by the thought that
the young wife might in some way be
made to suffer again by the people
who were held to be responsible for
what had gone before.
Three months passed and the young
wife was again made happy by
the hope of approaching maternity.
Again were these hopes dashed to the
ground by the same agency that had
before robbed her of her desire to be
come a mother. Again was her life
despaired of and again did the skill of
the physicians triumph. A long period
of convalescence followed, and Mr.
Hollander, made happy by the thought
that his wife had been restored to him,
and that death had for a second time
been robbed of a victim, resumed his
business occupations.
On the second day of last month Mr.
Hollander was called away from home
for forty-eight hours on a business
trip. When he returned he found his
wife gone and his home deserted. As
before, no trace of her whereabouts
had been left behind, no note of explan
ation and no message to relieve the
agonizing uncertainty as to what fate
had overtaken the missing woman.
Acting upon the knowledge gained by j
former experience Mr. Hollander called j
in the services of detectives and set
about a systematic search that was
destined to meet with success. After ;
several weeks a clew was found and j
the missing wife was trailed across the I
continent to California- The detectives |
found Mrs. Hollander at a ranch house !
owned by a family named Nye in the
foothills of Glenn County, fourteen
miles from the little town of Willows.
The telegraph conveyed this informa
tion to the anxious husband, who at
once started for the Pacific Coast as I
fast as steam could carry- him. He was ;
accompanied by his attorney, Walter |
S. Sherman. They went direct to Wil- j
lows, where they hired a team and
drove to the ranch house. There dis
appointment awaited them. It appears
that notice of their coming had been j
telegraphed from Boston by spies who
had been detailed to watch the move- |
ments of the husband. This warning
had been given in time to enable those ;
who were seeking to keep Mrs. HOI- ;
lander from her husband to take her ;
from the farm house to another hiding
place.
Disappointed and almost disheart
ened, Mr. Hollander and his attorney
came on to this city and took up their
residence at the Palace Hotel. They
reached Willows April 7 and found
that Mrs. Hollander had been taken
away from the ranch on April 5. They
reached this city April 8. Arriving
here there was nothing left for them to
do but to await the time when the new
hiding-place of :he unhappy wife
should be discovered. This was ac
complished last Thursday afternoon.
Precautions necessary to prevent a re
currence of the defeat and disappoint
ment that was met with upon the ar
rival of the rescuing party at Willows
caused a delay of 36 hours before Mr.
Hollander was notified that the time
had arrived when he could greet the
wife who had been so cruelly separated
from him for a period of almost two
months. Not until this meeting takes
place to-day will they feel themselves
free for a time at least from the dan
gers that seem to surround them.
"This Is the second attempt that has
been made to take my wife from me by
force and violence," said Mr. Holland
er yesterday, "and if there is any law
or Justice in the land It shall be the
last. Both attempts were so nearly
successful that I shudder to think of
the fate that would probably have
overtaken the dear little woman had
it not been my good fortune to find
and rescue her.
"Even to me, who have undergone
tortures of body and mind sufficiently
terrible to make me alive to the real
ity of what has happened, the whole
thing seems like a horrible dream or
the fancy of a diseased mind. It does
not seem possible that in this enlight
ened age there are people who would
not hesitate to do what has been done
to me and mine for the purpose of ac
quiring possession of a few paltry dol
lars.
"Think of it. A woman twice stolen
and taken thousands of miles away and
placed in an obscure hiding place;
twice" subjected to physical treatment
that all but ended in death and result
ed in the sacrifice of two innocent lives.
It is terrible, wrong and inhuman, yet
I doubt if it be possible to bring about
the punishment of the persons I know
to be guilty of these brutal and crim
inal acts. I do not know what to do or
where to turn. It seems that lam una
ble to protect my own wife from those
who would be benefited by any evil
that might be done her.
"The first time; she was taken away
from me I almost lost, my reason, be
cause I was afraid * that j she had been
murdered and her body either concealed
or destroyed. After: weeks of the
most terrible suspense I' found her in
Dakota. She had suffered as much
as â¢I, because she had ! not been per
mitted, to communicate with me or
with any one else. ; She told.me as
she has told my attorneys and will tell
you that her sisters and : their husbands
are responsible for ; all - that has hap
pened to her. I know V that all that
she has been able to " gam ..a knowl

fortunes is every word true and that it
is but a small portion of the scheme
that has been planned. My attorneys

A NEW HOME FOR DEPENDENT BOYS.
Youths' Directori] Will Be Open to Unfortunates of All Creeds.
VIEW OF THE NEW YOUTHS' DIRECTORY.
Contracts for the new Youths' Directory to replace the building on Howard street have been signed and re
corded. The institution will be handsome and imposing, and its doors will be open to all creeds. It will cost a
good, round sum, most of which the Rev. F. Crowley expects to raise among the numerous friend 3of this de
serving work.
The reverend director has a new scheme for raising funds, and it seems to be popular and successful. He
has had printed a number of pasteboard books, each page of which represents twenty bricks, sold at 5 cents each.
In this manner the friends of the home expect to realize as many B cent pieces as there are bricks in the new
building. It is an entirely new plan of financiering, and it is likely to work well.
The location of the new building is at Nineteenth and Angelica streets, with a frontage of 146 feet and a depth
of 56. One of the fine features of the building is a rotunda entrance supported by columns and surmounted by a
handsome dome with a striking clock. It will have accommodations for 125 boys. The dormitories, lavatories and
lecreation halls will be fitted up in the most modern style.
Eleven years ago the Youths' Directory procured its first permanent home on Howard street, near Seven
teenth. This was -a two-story frame building, which soon proved Inadequate.
During this period of eleven years the directory has passed through Us portals 5500 boys, who have been
protected and provided for without care or cost to State or county. Of late the increase of applicants for admission
has been such as to necessitate more room. Hence the new building in a larger lot of ground.
The directory was incorporated in ISS7. The present board of directors are: The Most Rev. Archbishop, Father
D. O. Crowley, James R. Kelly. Matt I. Sullivan, Thomas R. Bannerman, Dr. J. F. Gibbon, Dr. Joseph Oliver and
T. P. Riordan. The late Joseph A. Donohoe, Alex H. Loughborough and Henry Barroilhet were also members of
the board of directors up to the time of death.
It has been mainly through the untiring zeal and capable management of Father Crowley that the directory
as a great charitable Institution has accomplished so much good for helpless and unprotected waifs. He is an en
thusiastic believer in the maxim that "prevention is better than cure." He believes It is better to spend time and
money in housing, educating and training the unprotected waifs and orphan boys of the State, to the end that they
may grow up good, law-abiding citizens, than to neglect them and allow them to become criminals. The doors of
the directory are open at all hours of the day and night to the juvenile victims of poverty and vice. It is marked
by the most broad cosmopolitanism, and has numbered among its inmates representatives of almost every people
on the face of the globe.
be a case of life or death, and I shall
act accordingly."
Mrs. Hollander is but 22 years old,
yet she is said to be broken in both
health and spirit by the terrible ex
periences she has undergone.
Attorney Sherman also corroborates
the full details of the story as related
by the young husband and adds many
things which have not and cannot be
told here.
There is one chapter in the history
of the Clark family that has an inti
mate connection with the events of the
past year that have been briefly told in
the foregoing story. One of Mrs. Hol
lander's sisters was disinherited by the
terms of her father's will.
She Is Mrs. Richard Grogan Jr.
Richard Grogan is the son of the pro
prietor of the livery stable where the
horses of the Clark family were kept.
By reason of this fact Miss Clark was
occasionally called upon to enter into
conversation with the stableman's son.
She fell in love with him and they
eloped and were married. For this her
father never forgave her, a fact that
was made manifest by his omitting to
>rovidc for her in his will. The other
sister was also so unfortunate as not
to please her father in her selection
of a husband as well as in other mat
ters that antedated her nuptials. It
was because of these things that Al
vin Clark left the bulk of his valuable
estate to his youngest daughter, now
Mrs. Hollander.

DEATH OF DR. STOUT.
Dr. Arthur B. Stout, one of the oldest physicians of this city, died at
St. Luke^s Hospital on last Thursday. The deceased was 84 years of age
at the time of his death. He was a native of New York, and came out to
San Francisco as surgeon of the old steamship California which was the
first steam vessel to round the Horn with passengers for the gold fields in
1549. He practiced medicine here for many years, and was widely known
among the older San Franciscans. The weight of years finally incapacitated
him. and for the past five years he has been at St. Luke's "Hospital. His
funeral will take place to-day from Pioneer Hall at 1 o'clock
Hermann Oelrichs Here.
Herman Oelrichs arrived in the city
last night on the overland from New
York. He comes on some private busi
ness matters and will remain for three
or four weeks before returning to his
home. When seen last night Mr. Oel
richs said that he knew nothing what
ever of the alleged discovery of the pa
pers in the Fair will case, and that the
first he had heard of the matter was
When he read of it in a paper he secured
at Sacramento. Mrs. Oelrichs has gone
to Europe, accompanied by Miss Fair
and her two children, and will probably
remain abroad several months. The con
dition of her eyesight has much im
proved and her husband has hopes of her
complete recovery before long. Mr. Oel
richs refused to discuss the Cuban situ
ation for publication further than to say
that, in his opinion, the matter would be
settled without a resort to arms.
Remembered the Nurses.
Mrs. Schuller, who was shot by her
husband and lay in the Harbor Hospital
for two weeks, took a pleasing method
of showing her appreciation of the care
she received at the hands of the nurses
at that Institution, yesterday, when she
appeared there with two gold medals,
which she presented to the two matrons.
On one side of each of the medals was
inscribed a sentiment of thanks and on
the other side the name of one of the
ladles who gave her the attention which
was mainly responsible tor her recovery.
The Crowd
Goes to El Campo every Sunday. The re
sort opened for the season last Sunday,
and the attendance was large, but hardly
noticeable on account of the extent of
the grounds and the ample steamer ac
commodations. There's no other place
like El Campo â sunny and warm and
windless, besides it's inexpensive and
m-ar to San Francisco. Take the big
steamer Ukiah; four round trips at con
venient hours.

OOP OOOOOOQQ O O_O 0000GREAT COURSING
EXPECTED
ON MAY DAY.
The greyhounds at both Ingleside and
Union parks will enter upon a struggle
this afternoon besides which a mere
Congressional altercation wouldn't show
the heat of an Alaskan glacier. At Union
Park an all-age open stake will be run
off and with it a consolation event for
the dogs failing to successfully negotiate
theJr initial courses. At Ingleside the
feature of the card is a stake for the
hounds that have not won third money
or better during the past six months.
The running at both parks begins at the
usual hour.
Sinaloa is said to have improved much
since her appearance at Ingleside last
â week. She will soon be back in her old
stake-winning form.
This week's stake at Union Park ap
pears to be another good thing for Cur
tis. Cavalier will certainly be pretty
close to the top.
The initial stake of the Ingleside cham
pion challenge class to be run off on May
day gives evidence of havine met with
much favor. Already nominations are
being spoken for, and indications point
to an event awakening both State and
interstate interest.
An Eastern leashman, writing to a lo
cal publication, takes exception to a few
remarks lately made in The Call relative
to the quality of the greyhounds raised,
and being raised on the coast. After
quoting The Call, he says in part:
At Ingleside Park on March 20 the Eastern
bred dogs won both stakes, namely. Magic and
Coralie. The former is by Miller's liab out of
Lady Pembroke, and, I believe, was whelped
at Huron, S. D., and raised at St. Louis, Mo.
Coral by Babazoun, out of Buenretiro, was
whelped and raised in Colorado.
. Now, I presume a California greyhound is one
â whelped in California and an Eastern grey
hound is one whelped in the East.
I have the greatest respect for Californian
bred greyhounds. They breed some excellent
greyhounds, both fa.st and clever, and it takes
a rare good dog to down them, but 1 feel sure
every Californian sportsman will not object to
allow the Eastern greyhounds their dues and
what they .'airly earn.
The late Grace Cup, run for at Ingleside
Park, an Eastern dog divided first and an
other Eastern dog was third. Patrla, an East
ern greyhound, has been first or second or in
the money in all the stakes she has taken part
In and it was only a short time ago, 0:1 Feb
ruary 20, we saw grand old St. Lawrence, an
Eastern dog, who is getting too old to run
now has a crippled foot, and has been at the
stud win a fifty-four dog stake at Ingleside
I'ark and It is, perhaps, safe to say that In
his prime few If any greyhounds bred in the
East or on the Coast could lead him to the
bare.
In all this the gentleman Is undoubted
ly correct. But the article appeared in
The Call March 21. Let us look back of
that date. Of the twenty-three stakes
(covering a period of practically six
months) prior thereto Patria annexed
one and divided another. St. Lawrence
pulled down one and Diana scored one.
The other nineteen attest the worth of
coast stock, particularly as the above
named Eastern dogs were not only In the
fame often, but also several of the Van
lummell strings, several from Kay &
Train's stable, frequent representations
from Scott &â¢ Glassen's kennels, divers
of Howe it Thompson's flyers. Simmons
& Donahue's Colorado productions and
iodly number of others from the
East. That the Eastern stock has been
making a creditable showing at Ingle-
Blde lately is admitted. But the article
in The Call, when written, was certainly
not without warrant and the coa.st dogs
o cause to shirk a course with
their competitors from beyond the moun
tains.
Jimmy Anthony has got back his old
doR Tullamore and is running him at
Ingleside to-day. He looks to be able to
negotiate his iirst course.
Firm Friend and Th-ron should put up
a corking contest at Union Park to-day.
Theron has been run pretty steadily of
late, but he will make the old dog extend
himself, neverth)
Both pikers and plungers will play to

Banta Clara County returns to Inglo
â ide to-day in battle array. Portal.
Spring and Stillwell are all in the game
on the oid grounds again and their can
didates have a very dangerous look. The
race between StilKvell's Little Dell and
Flynn's Tom Bell will brir.jr out the
heaviest play of any contest this after
noon.
There are one or two dark horses at
T'nion Park to-day whose presence is a
disturbing element. Mona, County Dan
and Pigeon Toes are all three unknown.
It is to be doubted, however, that much
anxiety over their presence is warranted.
Mona is up against Magnet. County Dan
â¢will needs be a crack to put out Move
On. And while Sans Souci has peers
Pigeon Toes will nevertheless have to
belie his name to win.
The "Van" family, brought out by Dr.
Van Hummcll, is well represented at In
gleside to-dayâ Van Cloie, Van Knapp,
Van Kirk and Van Nidaâ all being in the
running.
Cronin & McDonald's Dottie Dimple
returns to Inglc-slde to-day, after a some
what protracted absence. In condition,
Dottie should negotiate her first run

The championship stake event which
will take place at Union Coursing Park
on May 1 will assuredly attract a great
gathering of leashmen from all parts of
the coast, and as the high-class dogs
of the State will appear in the slips on
that day, particular interest will natu
rally be manifested In the final rounds.
During the past week or two sports
men have been discussing the merits of
â¢the two great dogs, viz.. For Freedor.i
(Imported) and Connemara (local), and
there is no gainsaying the fact that if
the last-named dog is entered for the
May Day event at Union Pant, specula
tion on the result will be very keen ln-

mous hound as it would be a great fea
ther in his cap. if Connemara lowered
the colors of the imported canine in a
race that would leave not the least ele
ment of doubt in the minds of the spec
tators as to which is the better dog

J. R. Bockman of the Ar>ls took a
party of friends out last Sundny in his
new pleasure boat Sprite. His guests
were E. McDonough. Edward Lynch and
James Duffy. The German crew of the
Arlels intended to race against a South
End crew, but one of their members be
ing absent through sickness no race took
place.
The Ariel Rowing Club will hold its
club regatta on Sunday. May 15. Medals
for senior and junior scullers will be of
fered. Frank Wilson, holder of the se
nior sculls. Is taking daily exercise and
getting into torm. The junior scullers
are James O'Conneil and Andrew Car
roll. The Stockton Club obtained last
season from the East a new racing
barge, and this year the Ariels will prob
ably acquire one. Indeed, the probabil
ity is that all the rowing clubs will be
better equipped this season than almost
ever before.
During the winter Herzor and Julius
Morton of the Olympic Boat Club have
been going over to the boathouse at Tib
uron quite regularly, but general practice
among the members has only just begun.
Several members visited the clubhouse
on Sunda^ anu some crews will soon be
formed. The captain is anxious to get
four men to row regularly together to
form a crew for the four-oared shell.
At the meeting of the Alameda Boat

ALL-ROUND ATHLETICS
AT STANFORD COLLEGE.
The following communication from the
Stanford University concerning the ath
letes and how track and Held affairs are
progressing is self-explanatory:
STANFORD UNIVERSITT. April 14.â Since
the deicat i:i the Hist intercollegiate (tame,
the Stanford 'Vanity baa l>>-en practicing as
â i-ly. Two irntures of play have re
ceived most attentionâ the fielding and the bat
ting. In the former the players are showing
more reliability and Beem belter fitted to meet
the emergencies that arise. The work with the
stick has also improved. The men are lining
the balls out and placing their hits to goo/I
advantage.
The feeling In college Is that the team should
win the second game of the series. The loss
of another game on costly errors is a thing
not to be thought of. That the team should
have lost the last match because of |Â«ior play
at a critical time is a matter of suppressed
indignation. Those who attribute defeat to
hard luck are the more tolerant.
The make-up of the nine will be the same
as it was laot Saturday and Is as follows:
Catcher Strohn
Pitcher ....Beckett
First base Young
Second base Harris
Third base Klauber
Shortstop Lougheed (Captain)
Right field Swindells
Center field Wight
Left field Murphy
Am the time approaches for the intercolle
giate field day, the prospect, never bright for
Stanford, grows more and more gloomy. Char
lie Dole, on whom the college relied for at least
two first places, Is In bed with a strained ten
don. Everything is being done to bring him
around. Great doubt is entertained, however,
as to his ability to compete at all. If he re
covers in time to take part, his lack of train
ing will place him at a great disadvantage.
Jack Brur.ton, also. Is not doing as well as
was expected. His limbs an- stiff from rid
ing: and lack of training while absent from
college. Ropes are entertained, however, that
another week will bring him back to his old
form.
The bicycle event, which will come off In
San Jose on Wednesday, Is receiving consid
erable attention. Bayer, Cross, Rudolph. Mar
vin and Hohn will represent the cardinal in
this Intercollegiate tryout. Yours, etc.,

GETTING READY FOR
THE BENCH SHOW.
The secretary of th" San Francisco Ken
nel Club has received from New York an
unofficial intimation that the suspension
of the Mastiff Club has already been can
celed, but in the absence of official con
firmation this report must be accepted
with the proverbial grain of salt. It seems
that the time is too short for any such
measure to nave been taken. The San
Francisco Kennel (Hub is naturally anx
ious for the reinstatement of the Pacific
Mastiff Club, as the latter has offered
some valuable prizes for competition at
the show.
At a meeting of the committee on
judges last evening the question of the
retention of George Bell was definitely
settled in the affirmative.
Seventy-five per cent of the profits of
the show will be devoted to the cause of
charity. Mr. Oldham, the superintendent
of tho show, will arrive here on the 27th
inst., and will :it onre take charge of the
preliminary work. Neither pains nor ex
pense will be spared to insure a success
ful show.
Applications for premium lists and en
try blanks have already been received
from New York and Now Orleans. The
premium lists will bo issued next Monday.
The Oakland bench show will open two
weeks alter the close of the San Fran
ci.sco show, and David J. Sinclair will su
perintend it. The judge has not yet been
selected, but it is a foregone conclusion
tnat the Alameda Sportsmen's Associa
tion will not reappoint their last year's
judge.
F. R. Webster will shortly break up his
splendid cocker spaniel kennels at the
Country Club, and tho fine little hunters
of which he is so proud will be scattered
far and wide.

GOOD FLY FISHING
ON COAST STREAMS.
Sonoma Creek, which Is one of the
prettiest trout streams on the line of the
San Francisco and Xorth Pacific Hail
road, will doubtless be well stocked with
trout fry this year.
Some six years ago, when the I,a Motte
hatchery was in operation near Glen El
len, trout fishing- on the creek was good
during all months of the season, but
since the stocking of the stream, which
was done by experienced hands, had
ceased the sport gradually faded away.
Some people attribute the poor fishing
of the past three or four years to the
pollution of the waters from the debris
of the asylum, which place is located
near Glen Ellen; but when fishing above
the asylum has been equally poor, then
it becomes patent that something other
than the pollution of the waters has had
something to do with the famng off of
the grand sport that was enjoyed on the
creek some years ago.
With good and intelligent stocking an
nually Sonoma Creek can be made very
popular fishing waters for local anglers.
There is, however, tolerably good sport
at present to be had on the stream. Some
nice creels of trout have been taken dur
ing the past week. Charles H. Linn of
446 California street and John Sloane
caught sixiy very nice pan fish last Sun
day, one of which weighed nearly two
pounds, and on Wednesday last A. Har
rison of Glen Ellen landed fifty trout,
many of .which measured from eight to
twelve inches. Harrison writes: "There
are plenty of fish in the creek, but they
have been slow to bite, because of the
rich food in the stream, but they have
now commenced to take fly and spoon
with avidity."
Paper Mill Creek is holding its record
as the most prolific coast stream in the
State. Good catches have been made on
it this week. The Sh^pard brothers
caught 12ri trout, a few days ago. and
among that number were fifteen fish
that weighed from half a pound to one
pound. â¢
Jim Orndorff caught some nice trout
last Tuesday in San Gregorio Creek, but
Jim's sport was spoiled after he had
taken an involuntary dip in one of the
deep pools.
Good trout fishing is reported from
Salmon Creek, nenr jjodega, and Dutch
Bill ('r.ek, tn-tween Camp MocKer and
Tyrone station, which is near Russian
River.
A striped bass weighing 25 pounds
was caught in Russian River near Dun
cans Mills last week by an angrier who
was trolling with a Wilson spoon for
steelheads.
The following communication from
Monterey is self-explanatory:
MONTEREY, April In.â Two petitions rela
tive to the frame laws of this county have boon
presented by County Game Warden Godat.
The first asks that the beginning of the trout
season be deferred from April 1 to May 1, be
i uiK trout caught before that time are full
of s:>awn, and the other asks that It be de
< lart-i1 unlawful tÂ» hunt deer with doga of any
kind, on account of the fear of frightening all
the deer out of Monterey County.
Recent advices from Los Gatos do not
give great promise of much lishing in
that vicinity this season, owing to the
fact that what water has gone down Los
Gatos Creek has been taken out of the
stream at Camnbell for irrigation pur
prises, thus stopping it from going to Al
vfso. Tt is not generally known, but it
is true, nevertheless, that the majority
of the fish caup-ht in this creok come
from AIvIbo; they are steclheads. Last
year it is said that thousands of these
Ti*h wf-rp found in the irrigating ditches
near OiUnpbel! after the water had sank
into the ground. Screens should be put
in at the head of all Irrigation ditches
and fish ladders at all dams.
HANDBALL AND
POOL TOURNEYS
The banging and smashing of balls re
bounding from the walls of handball
courts could be heard incessantly during
the week at the Olympic Club. Many
exciting games were played, and the j
tournament is progressing rapidly toward
completion. The results are as follows: i
First classâ Hampton beat Morton, 51â ',
37; Morton beat Newman; 51â38; Hamp- :

TO BATTLE FOR
COLLEGE
CHAMPIONSHIPS.
It will take Stanford some time to re
cover from the shock its baseball men
received last week in the initial game of
the three which are to decide the cham
pionship between the two colleges. With
ten hits but three runs were scored, and
California, with five hits to its credit,
tallied seven times. This distinctly and
unerringly goes to prove what coaching
has lone for the Blue and Gold. With
a paucity of material, Cochran has
evolved a team which by its superior
knowledge of the game snatched a vic
tory when, under the natural laws of
chance, defeat should have been its por
tion.
The difference in the two college nines
this year is readily patent, even to an
unobservant spectator. Stanford has a
hitting team; California has not. Cali
fornia nas a nine of unparalleled fielders.
The same cannot be said for Stanford.
Strange to say, California plays as a team
and uoes not fall apart at critical mo
ments. Stanford needs balance and self
composure, two things which, with their
hitting abilities, wouid be a death knell
to all California's aspirations on the
diamond for this season. One hears on
â  -â¢ -i v â â â¢ i forma won on !uck last
Saturday; but the old-time professionals
and some of the later products of the
diamond who saw the game rebut
thia sin nuously. Thc-ir verdict is
that California won on its merits
and is likely to do this after
noon in the second game of the series,
unless Stanford plays much better ball
than that of a week ago.
To-day's game is the most important of
all. It means loss of the banner for
Stanford should a second defeat mar
their standards, and will probably meaji
a majority of games for them should the
Cardinal be triumphant. Beckett is a
vastly improved pitcher. He is steady,
accurate and sure, surpassing Kaarsberg
in speed and curves. During the week
he was worked hard for a few days, and
then rested. Shc^han, Stanford's coach,
was prostrated with grief on account of
defeat, but that did not prevent him from
working his men in iieid practice until
their hands were almost sore. The prac
tice has been better in form and team
work, improved upon until the red coats
are now the semblance of a team. But
for California's improvement in stick
work ami a sustention of their splend.d
field operations there is no reason why
Stanford should not win the match to
day. That the gam mbe closely fought
every indication as .vs. Devoid of acci
dents, a hot struggle s ovid be seen.
With the exception of Bride, first base
man for tho Blue and Gold, the team has
been in perfect condition physically. Bride
is suffering from a severe cold, but will
play in the gamp. The teams will line
up in tho samo order as last week, unless
changes are decided upon at a very late
hour. Following is the order.

Even though baseball is the more im
mediate subject of interest to collegian?!
it is forced to the wall by the absorbing
attention accorded to field sports by the
enthusiastic college youth. Next Saturday
the two colleges meet in the ann-ial field
day, and the struggle will be unto death

CHAMPION RACQUET
WIELDERS AT WORK.
Tennis players are fondly waiting for
the reports of the great Ojai Valley tour
nament, probably the most Important
ever held In California, The general be
lief is that the north will be triumphant
over the south in every battle. The Whit
neys and Hardys left the city last
Wednesday evening: for the valley, and a
gathering of tennis players was at the
ferry to wish them success and victory.
Rarely has any tennis tournament caused
as much interest as this which will be
completed to-day. In the minds of those
who know a thine or two about tennis
ttfere is no doubt concerning the result
of the tournament; that the Whitney and
Hardy freres will win not only the major
ity of matches, but every one played, is
their firm belief. However, they will find
strong men oppobed to them, and they
will have to play to carry off the palms.
At the California Club some very good
matches were played during the week,
and arrangements mnde for others to
follow next week. On Monday the oft
postponed match between Miss Hoffman
and Miss Mason for the club champion
ship in singles will be played. In mixed
doubles Sumner Hardy and Miss Clark
cleared the courts with sweeping: victor
ies. Miss McLeran. a fair visitor from
the south, played several matches on tho
courts during the past week and taught
the young lady players something of the
game. With Miss Tsabelle Sherwood of
Alameda she defeated Miss Winifred
Sherwood and Miss Mann 6âl. Miss Mc-
Loran and Joe Daly defeated the Misses
â Sherwood 6â2. 6=2.
Of the players who went south Robert
N. Whitney was the only one who did
not put in a week of practice. Sumner
and Sam Hardy put up good games in
practice. Sam Hardy beat Walter Magee
four out of five sets. George Whitney
beat Bradshaw 6âl,6 â 1, Bâ6, 6â2.

AN EMERGENCY ROLL.
Plan to Recruit for First Regiment,
!tT. G. C. â The New Service
Uniforms Are Here.
At a meeting of the Board of Officers of
the First Regiment of Infantry, N. G. C,
held last Thursday night, it was re
solved to open an emergency company roll
at each of the two armories. The pur
pose of this is to enable any of the ex-
National Guardsmen,' who, for various
reasons, were honorably discharged from
the service, to be ready to again become
members of any of the companies they
might desire. It is not, at this time, the
Intent to muster the men who may sign
the emergency roll, but to have them
ready at short notice should the occa
sion arise for their services.
These rolls will be opened on Monday
night at the Ellis street armory, where
those who may desire to enroll their
names with the companies that meet
there that night will have an opportun
ity to do so. The rolls will also be opened
at the Page street armory, where two
companies will meet for drill that night.
Every night next week the armories will
be open on company nights and In addi
tion there will be at each armory an of
ficer who will impart information as to
where the members of the consolidated
companies, that is, those which belong
to the regiments that were mustered out
under the plan of reorganization, can be
found, as there are, no doubt, a great
number of ex-Guardsmen who would pre
fer to be with old companions-in-arms.
Most of the service uniforms that were
ordered for the National Guard several
weeks ago have been receiwd in this
city and are now in a warehouse, and
will be ready for distribution in a short
time, as soon as a proper form of re
ceipts Is drawn up.

be done by the Supervisors unless a
written recommendation to do the
same has been made to them by the
Board of Public Works, and all sucfi
recommendations shall be made mat

Board.
When the Board shall recommend any
work to be done on a street intersec

not intersect each other at right angles,
it shall in each such case determine
what lots in the blocks adjacent to such
intersection or crossing will Le benefit
ed by said work, and shall cause a
map to be made on which shall be
delineated the lots so to be benefited.
Such map shall be transmitted to the
Supervisors with said recommenda

objections to the same within ten days
after the expiration of the time of the
publication of said resolution of inten
tion, which objections shall be delivered
to the Secretary of the Board of Public
Works, who shall endorse thereon the
date of its reception by him. Such ob
rjections shall be a bar for six months
o any further proceedings in relation
to the doing of said work or making
said Improvement, unless the owners of
the one-half or more of the frontage or
of the district, as aforesaid, shall
meanwhile petition for the same to be
done, and the same shall, after the ex
piration of said six months, be contin
ued under the resolution of intention
first passed if said Board shall deem
proper. If, however, the owners of at
least two-thirds of the property front

fied the Board shall hear the objections
urged, and pass upon the same, and its
decision shall be final and conclusive;
and If said objections are overruled the
proceedings shall be continued as
though no objections had been made.
At any time before the making of
the assessment as hereinafter provid

assessment therein, who, ufu-r the first
| publication of the aforesaid resolution
9 of intention, may feel aggrieved, or
who may have objections to any pro

tition <'f remonstrance, wherein they
shall state in what respect they feel
aggrieved, or the proceedings to "which
they object. Such petition or remon
strance shall be passed upon by the
Board, and its decision thereon shall
be final and conclusive.
Sec. 5. When the contemplated work
or improvement in the opinion of the
Board of Public Works is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the
expense of such work or improvement
be made chargeable upon a district,
and said Board shall in its res
olution of intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
and m be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to
be benefited by said work or improve

The Secretary of the Board shall lay
Bald objections before it and the Board

making such objections by depositing
a notice thereof in the Post Office at the
City and County, postage prepaid, ad
dressed to each objector. At the time
specified the Board shall hear the ob
jections urged and pass upon the same,
and if said objections are overruled, its
decision shall be final and conclusive
as to the extent and boundaries of the
district.
If the objections are sustained, the
Board shall proceed to set out another
district to the extent and boundaries
of which objections may be made and
a hearing had thereon as above pro
vided; and so on in like manner until
a district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob
jections shall be overruled by the Board
âits decision in that behalf to be final
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro
ceedings shall continue the same as if
no objections had been made. In its
report to the Supervisors the Board
shall accompany its report with a dia
gram on which shall be delineated each
separate lot, piece or parcel of land,
the area in square feet of each of such
lots, pieces or parcels of land, and the
relative location of the same to thÂ«
work or Improvement proposed to bÂ«

or with any one on his behalf, to ac
cept a price from him less than the
price named in said contract, or to
make any rebate or deduction to him
from such price. Any such agreement
shall be deemed a fraud upon all per
sons liable to be assessed for such
work other than the property owners
who were parties to the .agreement, and

front feet assessed for said work. A
mistake In the name of the owner shall
not invalidate any assessment.
When the expense of such work falls

corporation having railroad tracks
upon the street where such work has
been done, said assessment shall In
clude an assessment against said per
son, company or corporation, for its
legal proportion of said expense, and

within sixty days after the time of
said application, make and deliver to i
said applicant a new assessmant, dia- i
gram and warrant In accordance with i
law, and sign, record and authenticate ]
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots I
of land set out therein for the period of !
two years from the date of Its record- \
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce i
said lien as provided in this Chapter. I
Should such final judgment be that of j
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an apDeal therefrom to the '
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as

If any payment be made, the contrac
tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same
upon the assessment in the presence
of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons so assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is
stated as "unknown" upon the assess
ment, then said contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return Indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid in whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shal!
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff in
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
ment upon the books of its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
were issued. If any contractor shall
fail to return his warrant within the
time and in the form provided in this
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon
which a return may be made with the
same effect as If the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum until paid.
Sec. 14. The owners, whether named
in the assessment or not, the contrac
tor or his assigns, and all other per

provided for in this Chapter, or in the
assessment, feeling aggrieved by any
act or determination of the Board of
Public Works in relation thereto, or
who claim that the work has not been
performed according to the contract in
a good and substantial manner, or
having or making any objection to the
correctness or legality of the assess
ment or other act, determination, or
proceedings of the Board, shall, within
thirty days after the date of the war
rant, appeal to the Supervisors, by
briefly stating their objections in writ
ing and filing the same with the Clerk

and place of the hearing, briefly re
ferring to the work contracted to be
done, or other subject of appeal, and
to the acts, determinations or proceed
ings objected to or crmplained of, shall
be published for five days. Upon such
appeal the Supervisors may remedy
and correct any error or informality
in the proceedings, and revise and cor
rect any of the acts or determinations
of the Board relative to said work,
may confirm, amend, set aside, alter,
modify or correct the assessment in
such manner as to them shall seem
just; and require the w r ork to be com
pleted according to the directions of
the Supervisors, and may at their op
tion direct the Board of Public Works
to correct the warrant, assessment or
diagram in any particular, or to make
and issue a new warrant, assessment
and diagram to conform to the deci
sions of the Supervisors in relation
thereto.
All the decisions and determinations
of the Supervisors, upon notice and
hearing as aforesaid, shall be final and
conclusive upon all persons entitled to
appeal under the provisions of this
sertinn, as to nil errors, informalities
and irregularities, which the Supervis
ors might have remedied and avoided;
and no assessment shall be held in

rant, assessment and diagram, or any
day thereafter during the continuance
of the lien of said assessment, and re

remaining unpaid, with interest there
on at the rate of seven per centum per
annum until paid.
In all cases of recovery under the
provisions of this Chapter the plain
tiff shall recover the sum of fifteen dol
lars in addition to the taxable costs,
as attorney's fees, but not any percent
age upon said recovery. When suit has
been brought, after a personal demand
has been made and a refusal to pay
such assessment so demanded, the
plaintiff shall also be entitled to have
and recover said sum of fifteen dollars
as attorney's fees in addition to all tax
able costs, notwithstanding that the
suit may be settled or a tender be
made before a recovery In said action,
and he may have judgment therefor.
Said warrant, assessment and dia
gram, with the affidavit of demand and
non-payment, shall be held prima facie
evidence of the regularity and correct
ness of the assessment and of the prior
proceedings and acts of the Board of
Public Works and of the Supervisors
upon which said warrant, assessment

of the right of the plaintiff to recover in
the action. The Court In which said suit

Board shall by resolution determine
that the improvement would be of pub
lic benefit, it shall make an estimate
of the expense of such improvement,
and determine by resolution the district
which will be affected by, and should
be assessed for, the expense of such im
provement. No proceedings shall be
had upon the filing of such petition ua
til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary
of the Board an amount of money
which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
the expense that may be incurred in
case the Supervisors shall not pass an
ordinance for said improvement.
Sec. 2. If within three months after
the passage of the resolution determin
ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district

said property â including improvements
thereon â estimating said value accord

that such objections are sufficient to
prevent a recommendation of the im
provement, it shall pass a resolution to
that effect, and no further proceedings
shall be had under said petition. If
no objections have been filed, or if the
Board shall determine that the objec
tions filed are insufficient, it may pass
a resolution recommending to the Su

recommendation shall specially report
to the Supervisors whether in its opin

fied as affected by said improvement
will be benefited to the extent of the
expense of said improvement.

ABTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC "UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby 'eclared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the/City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations tor the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase tf such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important tp the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
a.nd County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
pubHc utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible- cost thereof.
gee. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in nur.ibor to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to tha
electors of thÂ« City and Obunty, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of su-/h utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the data
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa.
tures are appended to the original. ThÂ«
Mayor shall also have the right to for*
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formut
fated by the .Supervisors for the acqui.
sition of the utility named in said petl.
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi.
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board r.f Election Commission.,
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposl.
tion receiving a majority of the vote)
cast thereon shall be adopted; but ie
case the votes cast in favor ot bothI
propositions shall not exceed one-half j
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as _ar ore
said to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same as
provided in section Bix of this Article j
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same In the manner herein
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid ;
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms. !
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to b acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues ;
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there- :
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall â -;
therein the amount of the pro]
bonded Indebtedness, the rate of Inter- *
thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
two-thirds of the electors rotlng
therein at such election shall be neces
sary to Becure such acquisition and to
warrant the Issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, u< b reinafter se: forth.
Sec. :>. When the elec< irs by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a j
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne- J
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great" to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting erf
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Bupervis irs by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to ihe electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such '
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted- j
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public i
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County shall issue for the payment
of the cost of the same as in such or- j
dinance set forth (if the proposition bo
accepted by the electors), and shall fix ;
a day on which such special election '
shall be held, the manner of holding ;

A FATAL BLOW.
Otto Senn Killed Accidentally by a
Fellow Workman at the Union
Iron Works.
Otto Senn, of 137 Perry street, a ma
chinist employed in the Union Iron
Works, died in the Waldeck Hospital yes
terday fn^ii the effects of a blow with
tamer wielded by Thomas John
son, a i> How workman, on April 11. Senn
am! the workman were engaged on a
steel shaft driving Imlts. The hammer
slipped off the head of the bolt and struck
him over the pit of the stomach inflicting
injuries which caused the death of Senn.
Senn was taken to the Waldeck Hospi
tal, where an examination disclosed the
hat his stomach w;is ruptured and
that there was do hope [ >r his recovery.
The deceased told his wife shortly before
his death that the blow was accidental
and that he could not blame any one.
The body was taken to the Morgue, and
an inquest was waived by the relatives
of the deceased. Hence no inquest will
be held.
Poolrooms Decreasing.
According to the reports of the mem
bera of the Merchants' Association the
fight of that body against the poolrooms
is already productive of good results.
Many of the sharpers have already closed
their shops, and the Chief of Police has
promisfd to see that they do not open
some other kind of "skin game" in the
city. It is the belief that before very
long not a single poolroom will be left
open.

in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 15.â Professional traders
bought stock this morning, causing an advance
in prices of a point or over in the speculative
favorites, but most of these takings were sold
again before the expiration of the day's ses
sion, carrying prices back over their own
course and leaving net changes in almost all
cases Insignificant, but with small gains pre
dominating. The party on the exchange which
espoused the bull side yesterday found cause
for encouragement in the advance In the price
of Americans on the London exchange this
morning. Other European Bourses also showed
a firm tendency for Americans, and Spanish 4s
rallied from an early depression before the
opening of trading here. The cause of this
strength was a rumor that the powers had
Intervened between the United States and
Spain and that the Cuban insurgents had
agreed to an armistice. This rumor seemed
to have great force in foreign circles and
effected a sympathetic rise here at the open
ing, which was assisted by the professional
manipulation. Reports from London indicate
that there has been extensive dealing in ou
tions on Americans in that market and to-day s
demand was in large part from the sellers of
these options for the purpose of covering their
contracts. Whatever credence attached to the
intervention theory abroad, it was not deemed
important in this country, and the buying move
ment was quickly exhausted. The midday
period of Intense dullness and sagging prices
gave way to- a more active selling movement in
the final hour on belief that the Senate would
take action before adjourning. The definite
information from London that Great Britain
would refuse to Join in a naval demonstration
in behalf of Spain, and the Austrian Embadsa
dor'B open avowal that he had given up hone
of Europe preventing war. was notÂ» received in
Wall street until after the close. Neither was
the news that the regular army had been or
dered to the seaboard. Dealings were on a
small scale and the wide movement of prices
indicated a small floating supply of stocks
holders maintaining their waiting attitude. The
money market continued firm to-day and the
demand from the interior continued unabated
The supply of currency has become so scarce
that some of the city banks are shipping gold
In response to the interior demand. Further en
gagements of nearly $1,500,000 in gold for im
port were made to-day, notwithstanding the
hardness of the London money market and the
disinclination of Paris or Berlin to supply gold.
The Paris exchange on London as a. result
Jumped l'/4 centimes to 25 francs 36 centimes,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 15.â Trade In wheat started
â with the usual jump in May and new high
prices were made for that delivery. May
closed yesterday at Jl 11H. but opened to-day
at all the way from $1 12 to $1 14, and in two
minutes' time it had been bid up to $1 15. Not
since 189? has wheat reached such a high
level. A sharp break to $1 10 followed, fol
lowed by a quick rally to Jl 11%. After that
all interest near the close was centered in
the avalanche. July opened at S?%@B7%c, com
pared with yesterday's closing price of 87% c.
Hundreds had It for sale at those figures, and
the decline which started did not halt until
86% c was recorded. There the market rested,
but only for a few minutes. Liquidation was
redoubled and it was estimated that at least
5, 000,000 bushels was dumped on the market
in the hour- and a half which followed the
opening, chiefly for Letter's account, and the
heavy lines he disposed of, coupled with his
enormous cash sales, the last week must
have materially reduced his line of holdings.
The Liverpool market was %@%d lower before
this market opened, but apart from that no
realization for the weakness could be gath
ered from thÂ« news. The heavy holders were
evidently destined to realize their profits on
the r>-oent large advance, and their action
brought nearly all the small "tallers" in witti
their lines of long wheat. After the July price
had (rot down to S6V4c the market attain
quieted down to a certain extent, and up to
12:30 the decline was very gradual. But in the
last half hour's trading liquidation was re
sumed again and this time May also suffered,
though more from lack of support than from
an extensive offering. It was evident then
that the early bulge in May was part of a
cleverly prearranged plan to help Leiter li
quidate his July holdings, and It undoubtedly
did act as a steadying: Influence during the
n>3t tremendous fiord of wheat. The market
becam2 very weak toward the close and the
lowest prices of the day for July were quoted.
July closed at S4}i@64 T /4c; May closed Jl 09,
after selling at $1 08.
Corn was easier, principally In sympathy
with wheat. May closed %c .ower.
Oats were fairly active, weak and lower,
The weakness of wheat and coin was the main
factor. May closed %@%c lower.
Provisions were quite steady. Business was
very <!ull and fluctuations were very narrow.
The close was steady, May pork, lard ar.d ribs

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, April 15.â The Commercial Bulletin
â will say to-morrow of the Wool market: All
records for dull business are broken as far as
domestic Wools are concerned. Beyond sample
bags thpre has been no business except some
small lots of scoured yarns growth fine Texas
sold by an outside 6i>eculator at 46c. The
sales of foreign are swollen by the shipment of
p;ut of a wrecked cargo, 458 bales of Cape
Wool, in bond .to Canada. All credits are now
most carefully scanned, especially since the
utterly unexpected assignment of the felt works
at Dolgeville has succeeded the partially an
ticipated failure of Sawyer & Manning. The
grfat worsted mills have begun to shut down
machinery.

DUN'S REVIEW* OF TRADE.
TJEW YORK, April 15.-R. O. r>un & Co.'a
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
The meaning of Congress regarding Spain is
not in doubt, but the form of declaration at
this hour is in question. Preparations for war
continue as if it were inevitable. There Is
some hindrance In business and yet the vol
ume of payments through clearing houses is
still 12.9 per cent larger than last year, and
outside of New York about 2.2 per cent larger
than in 1892, though speculative stagnation
here makes the aggregate lower. New York
banks may now realize that they are strong
enough for all possible emergencies and may
give the Government valuable aid by greater
freedom in business loans. Sound New York
banks are not in the least alarmed about tha
business situation, nor have they any occa
sion for alarm. p
The industries are doing well, because they
have enormous orders taken In February and
March or earlier, which Insure operations for
periods varying from a fortnight to several
months. But the new orders, upon which they
have to rely if partial stoppage or closing of
many works is to be prevented, are lust now
restricted by apprehension about the money
market and the possibility of loans. In the
Iron business there are orders for about 20 000
tons of structural work held up by questions
of law; in Chicago the large postofflce order
is yet waiting, and the Russian order for
rails is still pending, possibly because of finan
cial difficulties. While new business in this
line is still very heavy, the production Is so
large that It may easily be disastrously check
ed by a persistent restriction of the current
demand. But foreign orders for six large ves
sels are pending In Eastern shipyards, and
actual orders for cars alone cover 20 000 tons
basic steel at Pittsburg. Angles have ad
vanced $1 per ton and structural works are all
crowded with orders, while pipes are in heavy
demand.
With prices for print cloths still at the low
est point ever touched, buying: of cotton goods
Is more hindered than many are willing to
admit by the idea that other goods, not equal
ly overproduced, may likewise decline In price.
The stagnation In wool is something remarka
ble, the total sales at the three chief mar
kets having been only 1,182,144 pounds, against
9, 61*. 600 last year, and in the first half of
April only 3.385,044 pounds, against 22,346.000
pounds a year ago. Manufacturers are still
waiting, although somewhat encouraged by a
rather better tone in the clothing trade of late.
They have ample orders for the present in most
lines, though not in all. Wheat rose o 1 * cents
and held 2V2 cents for the week, although At
lantic exports for the week have been 3,045.021
bushels (flour Included), against 57fi,719 bush
els last year, and Pacific exports 827,36* bush
els, against 212,056 last year. The total from
both coasts for two weeks of April has been 7,
379.136 bushels, against 3.057. 452 bushels last
year. The receipts from Western farms show
some decrease for the week, but for two weeks
are only about 600, 000 bushels smaller than a
year ago. Meanwhile, it Is astonishing that
receipts of corn continue remarkably heavy,
for the week more than 1.000.000. larger than
last year, and for two weeks more than 1.
650,000 bushels, and the exports for the week
have been 4,653,031 bushels, against 2.705.73S
bushels last year and for half of April 5, 146,681,
against 6.032,015 bushels last year. Such ex
traordinary exports of corn go lar to show that
the outward movement of wheat is by no
means of a speculative character, nor likely
to diminish speedily. The official report shows
that exports In March were 15.459.575 bushels
of wheat (flour included), against 7.901.722
bushels last year, and In nine months from
the principal ports, 163,909,730 bushels, against
132,676,463 last year Meanwhile, the exports
of corn In the nl;ie months have been 135.905,
934 bushels, against 136.634,231 last year.
The volume of legitimate business Is enor
mous. Meanwhile failures are remarkably
small for the week: there have been 2:>4 in the
United States against 207 last year, and 18 in
Canada, against 30 last year.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, April 13.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: The effect of the prevailing un
certainty in foreign affairs Is reflected in a
further perceptible quieting down of general
trade, so far as future engagements are con
cerned, ir. nearly all parts of the country.
While there is a little more activity to be
noted In the demand for seasonable staples at
the West and Northwest, where better weather
has helped retail and wholesale trade alike,
rather more quiet is reported at the East and
at the South Atlantic and Gulf ports, where
the Interruption to business has become par
ticularly serious, owing to the foreign con
troversy. The least notable effects yet ex
hibited are found In the Central West, where
distributive demand and movement are report
ed of a seasonable character, the only changes
njted, in fact, being the strengthening of
money rates and the discouragement of new
enterprises, such as railroad building. In the
Iron trade business continues of large vol
ume, but the bulk of this Is claimed to be on
aciount of orders previously booked, and new
business, where noted, is for small individual
lots. Price weakness Js more marked also than
for some time past. A feature of the week is
reported to be the gradual getting together of
the non-Bessemer Iron purchasers, who follow
ing the example set by other branches of that
business, are said to have formed a combine
which will include nearly all the manufactur
ers of foundry plgiron between the Alleghanies
and the Rocky Mountains. Wool continues dull
at nominal prices at the East, and the activ
ity in dry goods is confined chiefly to goods
needed at once. Cotton goods prices are steady
except for iTlnt cloths and talk of curtailing
produ"lton Is continued. Low-price woolens
continue in most active demand in this branch
of trade. A heavy export demand is reported
ami prices aro considerably higher. The price
situaticn is one of comparative steadiness
Foreign imnrÂ»f sions as to the situation in
Cuba are redacted in sharp advances in wheat,
flour, corn and lard and other food products
Declines are to be seen In Bessemer pig-iron
steel billets, coffee, sugar and lead, while as
compared with a week ngo, the price of oats,
pork, beef, molasses, copper, cotton, wool and
the manufactured products of both of those
staples are generally steady and unchanged
The business failures in the United States
for the week number 215, against 220 last week
195 In the corresponding week of 1597. 244 In
1806 and 219 in 1895.
Exports of cereals are larger. The shipments
of wheat (Hour Included) this week from the
United States and Canada aggregate 4,044 000
bunhels, against 3,778,000 bushels last week,
1.344,000 bushels In this week a year ago, 2,017 -
000 bushels In 1596, 3.165,000 bushels in 1895 and
3,019,000 bushels In 1594.
REVIEW OF THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 15.â Bradstrwt's, of the
New York stock market to-day, to-morrow w..i
say: While the public continues to watch the
stock market intently it takes no active part
in the proceedings. The professionals have ap
parently arrived at the conclusion that the un
favorable elements in the situation have been
discounted and that prices are more likely to
advance than to decline, no matter what the
outcome of the country's relations with Spain
may be. Stocks have passed largely into strong
hands and the floating supply of them is small
The short interest Is very much reduced

Jacob Wollner's circular says:
"The wool market, both here and In the East,
is Just the same as it has been for the last
three or four months. There Is no wool sell
ing and no inquiry. Usually during the preva
lence of a dull sjriell there Is some looking
around for weak spots or wools in weak hands
that try to effect sales by offering below the
market, but such Is not the case, however, at
present. Although there is no market, prices
are not shaded and cannot be quoted lower
than they were at the beginning of the year.
As soon as the war scare is settled we can
look for some business. There have been no
sales at all in this market anil Â»-->w wool*
which arrived <iuite freely on consignment are
not offered, as there is no use in owning them
if there are no buyers.
"Some of the Interior newspapers claim. that
the San Francisco wool merchants have com
bined and agreed not to buy any wools In the
country. so that the growers would have to
ship their wools to this market on consignment.
If we had a market or any demand at all
there would be lots of buyers in the country,
but as most of the wool dealers have .large
stocks on hand from last year they do not
feel like loading up with new wool when they
cannot sell It at present. Just as soon as
business is revived there Is no doubt but that
we will have plenty of buyers."

Hanlson's circular says:
"The following coal deliveries have been
made here this week, viz. five from British
Columbia, with 17.33s tons; two from Wash
ington, 6400 tons; two from Oregon, 1030 tons;
two from Australia. 4Sf>9 tons; total. 29.627 tons.
The arrivals are about equal to our consump
tion, hence prices remain about the same and
stocks In yards are undisturbed. Jobbers re
port trade dull; profits are fair, but orders are
not coming in freely. Some of our factories
are liberal fuel consumers, filling orders which
have been created by the anticipated needs of
our Government in case of war being declared.
This has made values steady for steam grades.
But few contracts are being made for future
deliveries of foreign coal, as the margins of
profit are cut so fine that the importers can
not cover their sales if a war insurance rate
is added. Coal is an article contraband of
war. hence liable to confiscation If the carrier
of same should be overtaken by Spanish gun
boats or privateers, if destined for an Amer
ican port, besides being a munition of war
which the Spaniards moet need. It Is most
singular that Australian and .English coal
freights have not been materially advanced in
view of the dismal outlook for grain carriers
to receive a moderate compensation for their
services on arrival here. If they continue to
come it is an undeniable fact that the carry-
Ing trade of the world Is at a very low ebb.

than we do.

JORDAN INDICTED.
"United States Grand Jury Presented
a True Bill Against the Post
office Janitor.
The United States Grand Jury yester
day presented an Indictment In the United
States District Court against John W.
Jordan "for embezzling from the United
States mall a valuable letter" on the sth
of April of this year. .
Jordan is a colored man and had been
employc-d for about two years as porter
and janitor in the general delivery de
partment of the postofflce in the Custom
House building. For several weeks mail
from the interior addressed to the gen
eral delivery had been missing, together
with money inclosed in the letters. Pos
tal Inspectors Munro and Erwin set a
watch on Jordan and detected him in the
ii< t of abstracting from a letter silver
certificates to the value of $3.
Being caueht in the act Jordan con
fessed that he had been stealing money
from letters for two months. The let
ters he destroyed after opening, by burn
ing them in the stove in the general de
livery department. The prisoner will be
arraigned in Judi?e de Haven's court this
morning and will, no doubt, plead guilty,
as he is being prosecuted on only one
charge.

Democrats Searching fo:

San Francisco Too Attractive
a Place and the Delegates Do
Not Come to Meeting.
At the Session of the State Central
Committee To- Day the Workers
May Be Heard.
San Francisco Is laboring under a pe
culiar handicap. It Is too attractive;
when the people come In from the coun
try they do not attend strictly to busi
ness, but go wandering around In search
of the sights, of which San Francisco has
enough and to spare. This character
istic Is thte most pointed argument the
outside counties can bring against the
city as a place for the meeting of the
Democratic convention during the coming
fall.
Not that the Democrats are particu
larly prone to sight-seeing, but It Is
claimed that there Is always a large ab-
GREGGAINS CAN NOW SLEEP.
The Referee Has Solved a Problem That Has Been Keeping
Him Awake.
A NEW DEPARTURE IN THE PRIZE RING,
Alec Greggains can now sleep at night. He has been troubled with Insomnia since the day that It was decided
that he should referee the coming mill between Sharkey and Jeffries, not that he had any doubt as to his ability to do
Justice to the case, but through an instinctive disposition to preserve himself from possible contact with the fists of
either of the big fellows who will enter the ring for the purpose of demolishing something;.
It is well understood among sporting men that when Jeffries and Sharkey get together trouble will brew for the
man who tries to make them break away when they shall have clinched, and just how the referee should be protected
from accidental violence was a question that has called forth more thought than the arrangements for the mill. This
has been the cause of the nervous trepidation on the part of Greggains. and the solution of the problem is .the cause
of the superabundance of smiles tha,t now illuminate the genial face of the referee.
It was well known that the face would be the vulnerable point should the enthusiasm of the pugilists get beyond
control, and it has been finally decided that Billy Woods' pneumatic face, such as was used at Carson, would afford
necessary protection in that respect. So far all was well, but Alec was bitterly opposed to having his arms and legs
used as possible fulcrums or his body becoming a mass of battered flesh when he attempted to separate the clinching
rivals for fistic honors.
One happy afternoon Greggains strolled out to the park In order to think In the wide free air, and an Inspira
tion took him to the museum. As he wandered aimlessly about his eyes chanced to fall upon a suit of antique armor
and the whole question was solved. Negotiations were entered into and the coat of mail was leased with privilege of
such alterations as might be found necessary, and now Alec is happy. A blacksmith friend was called Into requisi
tion and additional spikes welded on the steel frame with corresponding stiffening of the joints. While Greggains
would hardly be called an available candidate for a beauty show in his new apparel, he feels that much can be sac
rificed in appearance when safety of life and limb are in consideration, and the result is a combination that will di
vide the honors with the big fellows In the ring.
Sharkey and Jeffries have been shown the combination suit that will be worn by the referee, and they have be
come duly Impressed with the fact that if they fail to break away at command they are liable to fall afoul of some
thing worse than a knock-out blow, hence it is believed by those who have been "put on" that this fight will be one
of the most unique in the annals of local fistiana.
I sent list whenever the convention meets
in this city, and so to remove temptation
from before the easily led, it is proposed
as a remedy that the convention meet
! any place but In this attractive munici
pality.
There are several cities that want the
Democrats to come and partake of their
| hospitality, and there are committees out
i from each, working hard to show that
I there is no place for the convention but
! in the particular town which each repre
sents.
It was expected that the matter would
come before the meeting of the Demo
1 cratlc State Central Committee, which
| will be held in the California Hotel this
morning, but there is a feeling that the
time has not yet come to select the place
â  and prominent members of the coramit
i tee declare that no action will be taken
j unless under unforeseen circumstances.
Chairman Alford has heard that commit
I tees on convention from all over the
i State are in the city, and he thinks they
I should at least be heard, but having been
heard it is not unlikely that all they say
will be taken under advisement to await
some future time.
Sacramento, Santa Rosa, Los Angeles,
Santa Cruz, San Jose, Stockton and San
Francisco are all out on the hunt for the
convention guest, but San Francisco is
, tin- only one so attractive to the multi
i tude that they fear they cannot attend
jto business. The same claim is not made
! for Sacramento, nor for any of the others,
i and unless some fault is discovered in
j the availability of the Sunset city it is
probable the convention will meet In
some place where It can lock itself in.
General R. M. \Varneia. a. S. Baldwin,
J. C. Kirkpatrick, George K. Hooper, A.
A. Watkins, William M. Bunker and
George Warren, who were appointed by
the California Convention Committee to
appear before the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee and urge that body to
hold the next State convention of the
I party In this city, met last night in the
Palace Hotel. A. S. Baldwin was elected
chairman and the duties of secretary de
volved on General Warfleld.
It was the sense of the meeting, that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 16, 1898.
every effort possible should be put forth
to secure the convention. Inasmuch as
It is the intention of the California Con
vention Committee to endeavor to secure
the national conventions of all political
and fraternal organizations, it was the
belief of all the members that the first
step to t>e taken should be the holding of
our own State conventions in this city.
A resolution was then adopted appoint
ing A. A. Watkins, W. M. Bunker and
A. S. Baldwin to appear before the Dem
ocratic State Central Committee to-day
to urge the claims of this city. They
were authorized to agree to 'furnish thÂ«
necessary hall for the convention and
pay all reasonable incidental expenses.
The hotel proprietors have also pledged
themselves to furnish accommodations for
the delegates at reasonable rates.
JAPS TO BE DEPORTED.
Commissioner Rodgers of Philadel
phia Compliments North on
His Methods.
The work of the Special Board of In
quiry In the matter of seventy-one Jap
anese who arrived on the steamer Peru
was concluded yesterday afternoon. The
board recommended that five of the num
ber be returned by the steamship com
pany to Japan, it being %;lear that they
had come to this country under slave la
bor contracts. The five were the gang,
one of whose number was caught by Im-
migration Inspector Geffeney tearing up
a labor contract, and who tried to settle
the matter by offering the Inspector $100.
Several others were detained for fur
ther investigation, one member of the
board having declined to sign the report
admitting them to this country.
United States Immigration Commis
sioner Rodgers of Philadelphia, who was
sont hither from Washington to investi
gate the truth of the complaint made by
the Japanese Minister at Washington that
his countrymen were being discriminated
against, left for home last night. Before
his departure he highly complimented
Commissioner North on the efficiency of
his office and the thoroughness anl im
partiality of his methods. He will re-
port that the facts have been misrepre
sented to the Japanese Minister.
Commissioner Rice of Victoria, B. C,
who had come to this city for the pur
pose of familiarizing himself with the
methods pursued by Commissioner North,
will leave for his post this morning. He
and Mr. North have agreed upon a uni
form procedure in the cases of all Im
migrants of all nationalities coming un
der their Jurisdiction.
ACCIDENTALLY ASPHYXIATED.
Thomas Wilkinson Came to His
Death Because of a Leaky Gas
Tube in His Boom.
If Thomas Wilkinson, tailor, 130 Hayea
street, hart been a regular reader of the
newspapers his body would not now be
lying on a slab in the Morgue.
Wilkinson was found dead in his bed
at 8:30 o'clock yesterday morning: the
room was full of the fumes of illuminat
ing gas. Deputy Coroner O'Brien made
an investigation and found that the dead
ly gas had escaped from a rubber tube
connecting the gas fixtures with a stove
used for heating: tailors' -Irons. The de
ceased, on retiring, had turned on" the
gas at the stove, and the tube being leaky
had allowed the gas from the fixtures to
fill the room. Had he turned the stop
cock at the fixtures and thus prevented
the gas from going into the tube the ac
cident would not have happened.
The deceased was a native of England,
aged about 38 years, and was divorced
from his wife some time ago. He pos
sessed some shares of stock in the Conti
nental Building and Loan Association and
some money in the Pacific StateÃ Savings
and Loan Association, the whole amount
ing to $500.
Has Left Her Home.
The police have been asked to find
Maggie Lineger, a girl 17 years of age,
who left her home Monday afternoon.
Her father is James Lineger, 11S8 Harri
son street. The grirl is of slight build,
with dark eyes, and dark hair cut abort.

The March Earthquake
Held Responsible for
Recent Fires.
Fire Marshal Towe Gives
Property-Owners Some
Timely Advice.
American Biscuit Factory and Golden
Gate Villa Fires Referred to
as Illustrations.
The poor little earthquake of March 30
that caused so much excitement In the
city Is still having bricks thrown at It.
Fire Marshal Towe says that It is re
sponsible for something more than scar
ing people out of their wits and break
ing a lot of windows, and he thinks that
before next winter is over it will cause
the loss of many thousands of dollars.
The day following the earthquake the
American Biscuit Company's factory on
Broadway and Font streets was totally
destroyed by fire. The fire was attrib
uted to the earthquake by cracking the
top of the oven. The flames were first
observed by the watchman at the top of
the oven, which was about two feet from
the floor above,
Thursday nighfs fire at the Golden
Gate Villa, Ocean Beach, is also at
tributed to a crack in the chimney caus
ed by the earthquake. When the flames
were first sÂ«-en they were round the kit
chen chimney in the vicinity of the
crack. The kitchen fire was being used
at the time to cook tamales.
.. 1 T h , av c not the slightest doubt," said
the iMre Marshal yesterday, "that both
of these tires were due to the earth
ly V and there wlir be a lot more
through the same cause before next win
ter is over. The flames get in the cracks
an Â« >n time the woodwork catches fire
and it is a difficult matter to extinguish
the lire before considerable damage is
done.
"I would advise owners of buildings to
ov f rh u ul the chimneys for cracks and
get them repaired, otherwise they may
suffer serious loss. People are not using
many v Â» f ln thls weather, otherwise
more buildings would have suffered, but
when the cold weather comes then I ex
pect there will be trouble. I don't want
to alarm people unnecessarily, but it
would be well for property owners to
take my advice."
To be forewarned is to be forearmed,

A CASE OF THOMAS.
The Kate Thomas in the Hands of the
Thomases for Luck and Has a
Thomas Cat Mascot.
A case of Thomas, like history repeat
ing itself, came to light in the Custom
house yesterday. The ship Kate Thomas
cleared for Queenstown, Ireland. Her
captain is William Thomas, and she is
owned by William Thomas & Co.. who
are not of any kin to the captain. The
captain's sister is Kate Thomas. The
ship was entered at this port by Customs
Broker W. Ford Thomas, no relative of
any of the other Thomases, and he also
has a daughter named Kate Thomas.
The ship was entered in the name of
Customs Broker Harry B. Thomas, and
took away with her a large Thomas cat
as an additional mascot.
INCONVENIENCES HXJNTINGTON
He Wants the Bailroad Commission
ers to Hear Him at an Earlier
Date.
The Board of Railroad Commissioners
were in receipt of the following com
munication yesterday from C. P. Hunt-
Ington, president of the Southern Pa
cific, which explains itself:
_ April H. 1898.
To the Honorable Board of Railroad Com
missioners of the State of California-Gentle
men: I am in receipt of your notification to
me to appear before your board on the ilth
day nf May. at 1 o'clock. In the matter of the
establishment by your board of rates oi
of charges for the transportation of passen
gers and freight by the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and I beg to say. with all deference to
your board, that while I shall be quite ready
and glad to meet your honorable body and
state all information in my power concerning
the railroads with the control and direction
of which I have the honor to be connected.
I ask your courtesy In fixing upon an earlier
date for my appearance before you. My busi
ness duties are pressing and important and I
am likely to be called away from San Fran
cisco at almost any time after a week more
shall have elapsed. I reel quite confident that
a compliance with my request cannot Incon
venience the board nearly as much as my at
tention to your notice is certain to Incon
venience me, and hence I a.=k your favorable
consideration of it. Very truly,
C. P. HUNTINGTON.
Those of the Commissioners who are
out of the city will be notified of the re
ceipt of the letter by the board, and the
wish therein expressed by President
Huntington, that they permit him to 'ap
pear before them at an earlier date. In
all probability the Commissioners will
grant the request of the railroad mag
nate.
CADETS VOLUNTEER.
A Well-Drilled Regiment of Young
Men Offer Their Services to
the Governor.
Among the first organized bodies to
proffer their services to the Government
in case there should be war is the First
Regiment of the League of the Cross
Cadets of this city. The following letter
was sent by their commander to Gov
ernor Budd to-day:
SAN FRANCISCO, April 15, 1898.
Hon. James H. Budd, Governor of California.
Sacramento, Cal.â Sir: At a meeting: of the
board of officers of the First Regiment,
League of the Cross Cadets, held last even
ing, I was instructed by a unanimous vote to
place at your command the services of the
regiment for any duty that may be neces
sary tv maintain and defend the nation's honor.
The regiment is well drilled and disciplined
and is composed of 3 battalions; two of five
companies each and one of lour companies;
hospital corps, band and the requisite field,
staff and non-commissioned staff officers; in
all a total volunteer force at this writing of
706. I am preparing roster showing name, age
and height, which will be forwarded within the
next few days. I trust that this application
will receive your favorable consideration. Very
respectfully, W. P. SULLIVAN JR.,
Colonel Commanding First Regiment, L. C. C.
BIG MEN BEGIN
THEIR TRAINING
Sharkey at Work in Vallejo
and Jeffries Preparing
in Oakland.
Baker and Stelzner to Be Matched
for the Preliminary Bout of
the Evening.
Tom Sharkey, the patriotic marine, has
postponed his intention to enlist and fight
the Spaniards until after his go with Jim
Jeffries. The Sailor has already begun
training for the big event, and has Henry
Baker to assist him. As Thomas always
tires two men out when down to work,
he made overtures to Jack Stelzner to
join his camp. Stelzner might have done
so but for the fact that Jeffries had al
ready gobbled him up. Joe Kennedy will
now assist the marine.
Sharkey will train in Vallejo up to with
in a week or two of the fight, when he will
go to the Ocean Beach and finish up.
His old training quarters were destroyed
by fire on Thursday night, and Tom will
have to engage others.
Lon Agnew, the clever lightweight,
thinks Jeffries will prove the victor in
the coming go. As Agnew has trained
with Choynski, sparred with Jeffries, and
likewise with the Sailor; his opinion is
entitled to some consideration. Agnew
thinks Jeffries the strongest man in the
ring to-day, and as he has a good left
and is a good judge of distance, the Sail
or's rushes will not avail him.
As in the past Jim will train at the Re
liance club rooms under the watchful eye
of Billy Delaney.
Dal Hawkins left for New York on the
overland yesterday with the hope of be
ing pitted against Daly. Since his victory
over Eddie Connolly, Dal has become con
fident that he can take Lavigne's meas
ure.
It is said that Joe Goddard, the Barrier
champion, will try his fate again by en
tering the ring against Peter Maher. A
good offer has boen made him by the
Arena Club of Philadelphia for a go be
tween the Australian and the big Celt for
May 6 or 13. Joe, like Barkis, "was
wlllin'," and on receipt of the offer re
plied that the 6th would suit him, but
wanted more particulars before journey
ing East.
Sacramento Athlot.? Club has matched
Young Griffo and â¢'Bull" McCarthy to fight
twenty rounds for a decision on the 27th
of this month. The men will fiÂ£rht at
140 pounds, and Alec Greggains has been
chosen referee. McCarthy has met Owen
Zeigler and other leading lights, and has
made a fine showing against them, and
as Griffo is taking care of himself a good
bout should result.
Lon Agnew was in town yesterday look
ing better than he has in many months.
The ligaments in his right shoulder, which
he strained in one of his bouts, are in
their normal condition, and he is able to
use his right with as great force as in
former contests. Agnew says he would
rather meet "Spider" Kelly than any man
in the business. He claims Kelly was
given a decision over him by Sharkey
without cause. He thinks that Kelly
would be an easy mark for him, and
would like to retrieve himself.
The Manhattan Athletic Cluo will hold
another of its popular monthly boxing ex
hibitions on the evening of the 29th. The
best available material in the city has
been selected for the occasion and some
interesting goes will result.
Managers Groom and Gibbs, of the Na
tional Club, expect to have a good ap
petizer for the big go, by matching Baker
and Stelzner. As both men are in rival
camps training the big men, a fight be
tween them would attract nearly as much
Interest.
