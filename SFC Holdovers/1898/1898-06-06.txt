NEW YORK. June s.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs :
Spain's offensive naval power is effectu
ally broken, as tfye result of tr;e closing of
the net around Admiral Cervera and his
n)en-of-war, and naval officers are sure
another weeK will witness the capture or
destruction of the fleet now awaiting trje

War Board is collecting valuable informa
tion as to tr;e condition of tf}e Spanisf) re
serve squadron, aQd is employing it in the
preparation of an elaborate plan of cam
paign which may extend to tr;e Canary
Islands and Spain rjerself.
. Much to the gratification of the
officials, it has been definitely as
certained that the Cardinal Cis
neros, Cataluna and Princess de
Asturia, armored cruisers each
slightly heavier than any of the
vessels cooped up in the harbor
of Santiago de Cuba, cannot be
completed for some months.
Hitherto the officials have been
proceeding on the authority that
these vessels were ready for serv
ice, but the information received
within the last day or so is so
thoroughly reliable that they
have accepted it without hesita
tion. Furthermore, it has been
definitely learned that the ma
chinery of the battle-ship Pelayo,
the armored cruiser Carlos V
and the protected cruiser Alfonso
XIII is in bad condition, and al
though every effort is being made
to get the ships away from Cadiz,
it will be some time before they
can be put to sea. This informa
tion came to-day and set at rest
the minds of officials, who were
disturbed by the previous reports
that the Spanish fleet at Cadiz
had left and that its destination is
' the Philippines. With Cervera's
fleet effectually disposed of and
with a knowledge that-ihree ar-
mored cruisers cannot be got
ready for service for some time,
naval officers say there need be
no further apprehension of dan
ger from Spain's navy.
The information contained in
Lieutenant Caranza's letter that
the Cadiz squadron was intended
to "bombard Boston, Portland
and Long Island," will doubtless
cause a rearrangement of plans
on the part of the Spanish Gov
ernment, the department offi
cials say, as it reveals Spain's
secret, and, furthermore, gave
the United States warning,
which would have been taken
advantage of had not Admiral
Cervera been so effectually
trapped. Even supposing the ma
chinery of the squadron is shortly
placed in satisfactory order, the
American fleet at Santiago will
not have much trouble in dispos
The San Francisco Call
ing of it. Spain's armored force,
as a result of the bottling up of
Cervera's fleet, is reduced to two
vessels, both inferior to the Am
erican battleships, one protected
cruiser, some small, antiquated
cruisers, two torpedo gun vessels
and four torpedo boat destroyers.
The advantage is so palpably
with the American navy, and the
prospects of its triumph in both
the Canaries and even Spanish
waters themselves, that navy offi
cials do not believe that Spain
will be so eager to continue the
war.
In view of the condition of the
Spanish fleets there is renewed
talk in naval circles of the advis
ability of forming a flying squad
ron immediately after the de
destruction or capture of Cer
vera's men-of-war and of dis
patching it to the eastward for
the purpose of carrying the war
into Spanish waters.
It will be recalled that before
hostilities were actually declared
the Naval War Board planned the
formation of such a squadron,
â  consisting of the armored
cruisers New York and Brook
lyn, the protected cruisers Minne
apolis and Columbia and the
auxiliary cruisers St. Paul, St.
Louis, Harvard and Yale. On
I account of this action of tht
j Spanish Government in dis
patching Cervera's fleet to this
; side of the Atlantic the project
; was abandoned. In any event it
is doubtful if the liarvard and
Yale could be placed in such a
squadron at this time, as neither
has any offensive armament. The
St. Paul, however, has an excel
lent battery, and the St. Louis
twelve six-pounders, which could
be added to it in short order.
The departure of such a fleet
would not embarrass the opera
tions of the campaign against
Cuba and Porto Rico, as battle
ship-monitors will be depended
upon to protect the blockade and
coast and to bombard Havana
and San Juan whenever the army
attempted to occupy them. _^_ i
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, JUNE 6, 1898.
THE LATE CAPTAIN CHARLES V. GRIDLEY.
ONE HERO OF
MANILA BAY
IS SUMMONED
Call Office, Risers House,
Washington, June 5.
Captain Charles V. Gridley, com
mander of the cruiser Olympia, and one
of the heroes of the brilliant victory at
Manila, is dead. The announcement of
his death was received by the Navy De
partment late this afternoon in a cable
gram from Paymaster Gait of the navy,
dated at Kobe. Japan, June 4, and di
rected to Secretary Long. The dispatch
contained this simple statement: "Cap
tain Gridley died to-day. Remains ac
company me on the Coptic."
Captain Vernon Gridley is the first
American officer of great prominence
whose death Is a direct result of the
existing war with Spain. As the com
mander of Admiral Dewey's splendid
flagship and one of the admiral's chief
advisers, Captain Gridley achieved dis
tinction at the battle of Manila Bay,
and added to his previous laurels by
winning high praise from his superiors
In the service for distinguished gallan
try and ability. He fought his ship
from the conning tower, while Admiral
Dewey directed the movements of his
squadron from the bridge of the ves
sel.
It was not known for several weeks
aftfr the engagement that Captain
Gridley had suffered from It; and even
now the precise nature of his trouble
is not yet disclosed. Upon the arrival
! of the Zafiro at Hongkong on the 20th
! of May, the N" â¢*â¢â >- Department was no
j tified that Captain Gridley had been
] condemned by a board of medical sur
vey and "invalided" home. Subsequent
advices received by the department In
dicated that Captain Gridley was suf
j feting from the effects of a rupture
supposed to have been received during
the battle at Manila, but no details
were given. It was not supposed that
his illness was very serious, as the de
partment was informed that the cap
[ tain, m company with Paymaster Gait,
would leave for home as soon as pos
sible.
On the 28th of May they left Hong
kong on the steamer Coptic, one of the
vessels of the Occidental and Oriental
Steamship line. It would appear that
Captain Gridley died about the time the
ship reached Kobe. It is quite evident
now that he considered his case serious,
as he did not communicate, so far as is
known, with any member of his family
after the battle of Manila.
Captain Gridley. was not a "dress
parade officer." Among the older of
ficers, however, especially among those
with whom he served, he had the repu
tation of being one of the best-equipped
officers of the navy. He was regarded
as one of the best navigators in the
service, and his thorough knowledge of
all its details and requirements fully
Justified the remark of Admiral Ram
sey that "Gridley is one of the brainiest
and pluckiest officers In the naval serv
ice."
Dispatches from Manila concerning
the battle indicated that Commodore
Dewey had the utmost confidence In
Captain Gridley; that he never inter
fered in the slightest degree with his
management and handling of the ship;
that he told him to fire whenever ready,
and that the broadside which sunk the
flagship of the Spanish admiral was
Grldley's own conception and act, and,
in fine, that throughout the entire
battle the Olympia was handled
superbly. The distinguished bravery
and ability of Captain Gridley were
recognized by the President, and had he
lived promotion doubtless would have
been his substantial reward.
Captain Gridley leaves a widow and
three children â two daughters and a
son â who are now residing with Mrs.
Gridley's father, Judge Vincent, at
Erie. Pa. His mother, Mrs. Ann Eliza
Gridley, and his brother, Lucius, reside
in this city, the former being a clerk
in the Patent Office and the latter an
employe In the Treasury Department.
Captain Gridley was born In Logans
port. Ind., in 1845, and appointed to the
Naval Academy from Hillsdale, Mich.,
in 1860 by Representative Henry Wald
ron, the Gridleys having removed from
Indiana to Michigan when Charles was
only 3 months old. Under ordinary cir-
cumstances the class of 1860 would
have graduated in 1864, but the necessi
ties of the Civil War advanced it one
year. On October 1, 1863, young Gridley
was promoted to ensign and ordered to
the steam sloop Oneida, then at the
West Gulf blockade squadron, in which
squadron he remained until the close of
the war. He was in the battle of Mo
bile Bay, August 5, 1864, where his cool
ness and bravery were noted.
After the war he was assigned to the
steam sloop Brooklyn, the flagship of
the Brazilian squadron, with which he
served until 1867, being promoted to
master in November, 1866. A year later
he was promoted to lieutenant, and
March 12, 1868, to lieutenant com
mander. In 1870 he was assigned to
the steamer Michigan, (fourth rate),
where he served two years. Early in
1873 he was asigned to the Monongahela
(second rate), serving one year, andi in I
February, 1875, detailed as instructor at i
the naval academy at Annapolis, where ;
he remained for four years, serving
during the summer cruises of 1877 and
1878 as executive officer of the practice
ship Constellation.
In 1879 he was made executive of
ficer of the United States flagship
Trenton on the European station, serv
ing from December, 1879, to November,
ISSI. On March 10, 1882, he was pro
moted to commander, and during that
summer he was on duty at the torpedo
station. From October, 1882, to Feb
ruary, 1884, he was chief navigation of
ficer at the Boston navy yard. In Feb
ruary, ISS4, he was ordered to com
mand the training ship Portsmouth.
From June to November, 18S6, he was
senior officer of the cruising training
Squadron. In July, 18S7, he was in
spector of the Tenth Lighthouse Dis
trict and stationed at Buffalo, where
he served until October, 1891. From
October, 1891, to July, 1892, he was as
signed to special duty at the navy yard
at Washington. In July, 1892, he was
assigned to command the Marion, and
on July 10 was detailed from that ship
as inspector of the lighthouse district
with headquarters at Buffalo. In
March, 1597, while commander of the
receiving ship Richmond at League
Island he was ordered to the Asiatic
squadron, and July 18, 1897, was as
signed to command the Olympia.
PROBABLE CONFUSION
OF TERROR AND FUROR.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. June 5.â A dis
patch from Port Antonio says:
"A vessel that has arrived here from
Santiago de Cuba reports that the
Americans sunk on Friday night the
Spanish torpedo-boat destroyer Ter
ror."
The assumption, based upon dis
patches from Madrid, has been that the
destroyer Terror, after leaving Fort de
France wen to Porto Klco, and it is
probable that the Port Antonio dispatch
confuses her with her sister destroyer,
the Furor, as has several times been
done in dispatches from ot ier points.
BUT WAR

CONCLUDED
Spair) Is Now ir) Proper
Mood to Asl^ for
Peace.
This Government, However, In
tends to Act Aggressively for
the Next Few Weeks.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, June 5.
News from several quarters during the last few days
strongly indicates that Spain is in a mood to ask for peace.
The magnanimous action of Cervera in notifying Admiral
Sampson that the prisoners captured on the Merrimac would
be kindly treated and exchanged for Spanish prisoners at Fort
McPherson is regarded here as a particularly smart thing for
him to do. The wily old naval commander appears to be
something of a diplomat as well as naval tactician.
El Epoca, published in Madrid, is fh close touch with the
Sagasta regime. Its recent allusions to this "grand Government of
the United States," and its confession that "an inclination in favor
of peace is predominant in Spain" is another circumstance that
shows which way the wind is blowing.
The sentiment here in Washington is unanimously opposed to
entertaining any peace overtures at this time. The Philippines and
Porto Rico must both be taken before any such proposition is con
sidered.
There is not the slightest doubt of the administration's inten
tion to act aggressively for the next few weeks. There seems to be
no reason why Porto Rico should not be in our possession by the
end of this month.
It is quite generally believed that General Fitzhugh Lee will
lead the Porto Rico expedition and will be made military governor
of the island.
As for the Philippines, they are virtually in our possession now.
A dispatch from San Francisco printed this morning indicates a
doubt as to whether the Monadnock will be sent to Manila. The
Call correspondent has positive information that this is the destina
tion of that vessel, for he has seen the orders issued to the Mare
Island commandant.
It has been decided to send more troops to San Francisco. This
time some of them will be sent from as far east as New York. Orders
will be issued assigning for duty in the Philippines the light brigade
organized and equipped by John Jacob Astor, inspector-general,
with rank of colonel on the staff of Major-General Breckinridge.
The Nebraska regiment of which William J. Bryan is to be colonel
has not yet been mustered in, but there is no doubt that this regi
ment will be sent to Manila.

ALLEGED COMBAT OFF
THE HAYTIEN COAST
Three Spanish and Four American
Warships Reported to Have
Battled.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayti, June s.â Advices from Mole St. Nicholas (
6ay that yesterday afternoon (Saturday) some distance off Jean Rabel, (
a seaport on the northwest port of Hayti, half way between .Port de (
Paix and Mole St. Nicholas, a combat took place between three Spanish (
and four American warships. (
The American ships are said to have withdrawn from the combat. (
One of the Spanish warships entered the harbor of Jean Rabel for (
water. The officers of the ship lying at Mole St. Nicholas were ex- (
tremely reticent. (
Jean Rabel is an insignificant seaport, and there is no telegraphic (
station there. It is thought possible that the Spanish ships encountered (
were the vanguard of the Cadiz fleet. (
The names of the American ships are not ascertained, but it is be- C
lieved that they were scout boats. (

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June s.â Richard Hard-
Ing Davis, writing to the Herald from
the headquarters of the United States
army at Tampa, Fla., says: The ut
most indignation has been aweakened
here to-day by an article attacking the
regular army, which appeared in a cur
rent number of an illustrated weekly
paper. The article is by Mr. Poultney
Bigelow, who, with Editor Percival, is
to-night universally condemned.
Mr. Bigelow states that owing to the
stinginess of the Government the
health of the men is seriously affected;
that they are being treated worse than
those of any Continental and
that there is not a single regiment fit to
take the field. The camp doctors, so
Bigelow writes, are busy with men and
officers suffering from dysentery.
I asked Colonel Pope, chief surgeon
of the Fifth Artillery Corps, just what
was the present health of the men, and
he said: "The sick list is only 2 per
cent. This is less than one-half the
normal rate of 44 1 * per cent. It is the
healthiest army in history."
The article also charges the Govern
ment with giving men unseasonable
food.
"We are in the habit," writes Bige
low, "of pitying the soldiers of Eu
rope. For downright neglect I have
Been nothing to beat the way the
American is treated by Uncle Sam.
There is a German miltary attache at
Tampa noting all these things, and
what is concealed from the American
people is carefully sent to Europe."
I happened to be talking the other
day on this same subject to this same
military attache, Count yon Goetzen,
who said the rations served our men at
Tampa were as good as those served to
any Continental army, and that our
men received them in much greater
quantity. That is the answer of the
German attache to Mr. Bigelow.
As to his most sensational charge,
that there is not a single regiment here
ready to take the field, I can best quote
the commander-in-chief :
"There is not a regiment belonging to
the regular army," he said, "that Is not
ready now to take the field and that
has not been ready for months. I have
never been so proud as I was yester
day, when I rode through the camp of
the Fifth Army Corps and saw the
magnificent condition and Physical per
fectness of our men. There is no army
corps anywhere in the world that is
better supplied with men and officers of
courage, fortitude and intelligence."
That is the answer of the com
mander-in-chief to the editor of the
periodical and to Mr. Bigelow.

It was stated on pretty good author
ity to-day that the Government would

handled is enormous.
A distinct but unverified report was

Paymaster McArthur, of the New

with the funds with which to pay off
the New York regiments for the time
they were in camp prior to being mus

Two troops of the First Kentucky

raised since the call for volunteers and
the men have, so far, had no experience
in the service.

PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, June 5.â
According to the latest advices from
Santiago dÂ« Cuba, there were not more
than seventen ships in the offing all
day, and it is belived there that the
three missing vessels have gone for
provisions and munitions of war.
At 6 o'clock this afternoon the Hay
tien steamer Nouvelle Voldregue ar
rived here from Cape Haytlen after
touching at all the ports along the
coast. She reports that yesterday at
Mole St. Nicholas she saw the United
States troop ship Resolute awaiting in
structions. The vessel was under con
voy. It was ascertained from passen
gers on the Nouvelle Voldregue that
the Resolute had been pursued between
Jean Rabel and Mole St. Nicholas by
two Spanish corvettes.
From the same source it is learned
that Admiral Cervera's squadron in its
entirety is not in the port of Santiago
de Cuba, but that only a cruiser, sup
posed to be the Cristobal Colon, one
torpedo boat and two auxiliary crui
sers are there.
SAYS THREE WEEKS

Associate Justice Shiras Predicts a
Decisive Blow Off Cuba in
a Few Days.
NEW YORK, June 5.â A Pittsburg
special to the Herald says: Associate
Justice George Shiras of the United
States Supreme Court declares that the
war will end within three weeks. He
said tonight:
"In my opinion a decisive blow will be
struck off the Cuban coast in a few
days, and within three weeks Spain will
be suing for peace."
"Were you for war before the formal
declaration of hostilities?" I asked.
"No," he replied. "I believed the Cu
ban question could be settled peaceably,
but now that war Is started I think we
should not be slow in prosecuting it to
a speedy termination in a manner that
will bring glory to the United States.
The Administration means business,
and the wisdom of the policy pursued
will be apparent in due season. The
close of the war is near."

A high official of the Government,
speaking to me to-day, said he had no
doubt Caranza's presence in Canada
partook of the same offensive nature as
if one of Spain's ships were in Eng
land's neutral ports. This official said
this country had made due demand of
England in the premises and had no
doubt that within a few days Caranza
would be forced to leave British soil.
"For," said he, "England cannot un
der any principle of international law
allow within its borders an organized
conspiracy, as divulged by Caranza's
letter, against the peace and comfort of
a friendly nation."

AMERICAN TROOPS
TO BOMBARD THE
SHIPS OF CERVERA
NEW YORK, June 5. â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends the following:
Pending the arrival of American troops, Rear Admiral Sampson's men-of-war will perform
the monotonous but highly important work of blockading Santiago de Cuba. The monotony may
be occasionally relieved by the destruction of any new batteries the Spaniards may attempt to erect,
or by the discharge of shells at any workmen who may labor to remove the wreck of the Merri
mac. And it may be that Rear Admiral Sampson may come to the conclusion that wisdom re
quires the sinking of another collier alongside its sister ship. But beyond this it can be stated au
thoritatively there will be no formal bombardment of fortifications, and no extensive naval opera
tions will be attempted until the arrival Wednesday or Thursday of the American troops now en
route to Santiago de Cuba.
New conditions will exist when the troops are at hand. It will be necessary in the first
place for the ships to cover the landing of the troops, and it is possible Rear Admiral Sampson
may consider it advisable to trick the enemy by making a demonstration either directly in front of
Santiago harbor or at a point on the opposite bank of that on which a landing is really being
effected. The troopships are under a strong convoy, the most formidable member of which is the
battleship Indiana, so they will be in little danger during this short cruise.
It is expected the insurgents will greatly aid in facilitating the landing of the American
troops, perhaps by making an attack on Santiago de Cuba or by protecting the landing place. This
is a detail which it is understood Rear Admiral Sampson will arrange with General Garcia, who
commands the insurgent forces in the province.
There is little prospect that the armor clads under Rear Admiral Sampson's command will
be able to try their metal against the Spanish armored cruisers. By the sinking of the collier Mer
rimac in the harbor Rear Admiral Sampson closed the channel so effectually as not only- -to pre
vent the escape of Admiral Cervera, but the ingress of his own ships. There is no wrecking ship
with the American squadron and none will be sent to that point, so it is evident the army will be
given the work of capturing or destroying the ships. This proposed work will be accomplished by
a cordon of siege guns which are now being transported to Santiago de Cuba, and will be placed
on the high hills surrounding the harbor. The accomplishment of this work will mean the de
struction of the Spanish military force now defending that city. When it is completed twenty-four
five-inch Armstrong siege guns, manned by experienced artillerymen, will point down toward Ad
miral Cervera's ships, and if that officer does not surrender a storm of shells will be hurled down
upon him which will be disastrous.
The dynamite cruiser Vesuvius, which will be enabled to come within short range of the
harbor where Admiral Cervera's ships are, will be able to drop dynamite shells in their vicinity,
and Rear Admiral Sampson's men-of-war can add to the bombardment by firing shells over the
hills, as was done by the Spaniards during the reconnoissance made by Commodore Schley a few
days ago.
It is evident the outlook is very gloomy for Spain. The Naval War Board is a unit in de
claring it is impossible for Cerve^a to escape. It is desired by officials that there shall be as little
loss of life as possible, and for this reason it is hoped that Admiral Cervera will surrender as soon
as he can honorably do so.
"I doubt very much if Admiral Cervera will attempt to blow up the Merrimac and escape
through the channel," said a naval expert with whom I talked to-day. "The steel sides and ma
chinery of the collier would obstruct the channel, and the probability is that holes would be bat
tered in the bottoms of the armored cruisers if they attempted to pass over the pieces of the
wreck. It is my belief that when the Spanish army has been defeated Cervera will destroy his
ships and go ashore, where he will surrender. The Spaniards will never permit those vessels to fall
into our hands."
BRAVE MEN WHO SHARE
HONORS WITH HOBSON
WASHINGTON, June 5. â Information afforded by the official records of the Navy Department as to the
full names and antecedents of the gallant sailors who made up Hobson's little crew in sinking the Merrimac dif
fers in some particulars from data furnished through the dispatch boats. The naval list is about as follows:
Daniel Montague, first class machinist on the New York, born in Ireland and 29 years old; last enlistment in
December, 1896; next of kin, Kate Golden, sister, 84 Horatio street, New York.
George Charette, first class gunner's mate on the New York, born in Lowell, Mass., 29 years of age; last
enlistment May 20, 1898: has been in the service since 1884; his next of kin is Alexander Charette, father, Low
ell, Mass.
Osborn Deignan, cockswain on the Merrimac, born in Stuart, lowa, 21 years old; last enlistment April 22,
1898; next of kin, Julia Deignan, mother, Stuart, lowa,
George F. Phillips, machinist on the Merrimac, born in Boston, 34 years old; last enlistment March, 1898
next of kin, Andrew Philips, Cambridgeport, Mass.
Francis Kelley, water tender on the Merrimac, born in Boston, 28 years old; enlisted at Norfolk April
21 next of kin, Francis Kelley, Boston.
Randolph Clausen, cockswain on the New York, born in Boston, 28 years of age; last enlistmei t February
25, 1897; next of kin, Teresa Clausen, wife, 127 Cherry street, New York.
Great admiration is expressed at the department at the cool pluck and discretion shown by the young cadet,
George W. Powell, who took command of the New York's steam launch and lay under the batteries fo; many
hours until he was satisfied from his own observation that the Merrimac had gone down befora he returned to the
flagship. It is felt that his act involved a display of quite as much courage as was shown by the Merrimac's
crew, and he is likely to profit thereby.
Young Powell was known as "one of Hobson's chickens." When Hobson joined the squadron he se
cured permission from the authorities to take with hi three young naval cadets from the academy at Annapolis.
They were included in his own class of naval cadets at the academy and he wished to take them with him to sub
stitute the theoretical force by some practical experience in the effect of explosives on ships. Powell was ap
pointed to the academy from New York in May, 1893.
CANADA WILL
EXPEL SPIES
London to Force Their
Departure.
GIVEN CAUSE FOR ACTION.
EFFECT OF THE INTERCEPTED
CARRANZA LETTER.
Sir Julian Pauncefote Cables to His
Government, Which Will
Interfere Without
Delay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 5.
Steps have been taken by which it is
expected Lieutenant Carranza, who has
conducted the Spanish spy system at
Montreal with his associate, Senor Dv
Dose, the former first secretary of the
Spanish legation here, will be expelled
from Canada within the next few days
unless they adopt their own meana to
leave before an international question
is raised as to their presence in Canada.
The Carranza letter detailing his spy
system was communicated to the Brit
ish Embassador, Sir Julian Pauncefote,
together with all other information
bearing on the operations of the Span
ish in Canada, The Embassador was
quick to act, and without awaiting the
slow process of the mail he cabled the
entire matter to the Foreign Office. No
doubt is entertained as to the speedy
action of the authorities at London,
now that a specific case has been made
out against the Spanish officials in
Canada. They would have taken the
initiative ere this had there been any
thing more than suspicion as to the
operations of Carranza and Dv Bosc.
The Carranza letter was proof positive
and the British officials will move
quickly and of their own volition
toward securing adequate redress.
The State Department has not cabled
to Embassador Hay, not deeming it ne
cessary to do more than simply lay the
facts before the British Embassador
here. It is expected Lord Salisbury will
call the attention of the Spanish Gov
ernmen to the undesirability of having
Messrs. Carranza and Dv Bosc remain
in Canada longer, as the operations are
so obviously hostile to the United
States. This, however, may become un
necessary if the Spanish officials with
draw from Canada, for there appears
to be no disposition to prosecute them
nor to give them an enforced expulsion
bo long as they are willing to close
their operations and depart. The Brit
ish statutes, as well as those of Canada,
have specific provision against the use
of British or Canadian territory by for
eigners temporarily seeking asylum
there as the base of hostile operations
against countries with which Great
Britain and her colonies are at peace.
About a week ago an effort was made
by the Spanish officials to enlist the
sympathy of the British Embassy here
with an alleged British subject im
prisoned at Tampa, who, it is believed
is the Spanish spy alluded to in Lieu
tenant Carranza's letter. A Canadian
lawyer arrived here last Sunday and
made a personal appeal to Sir Julian
to intervene in behalf of the man im
prisoned at Tampa. There were sus
picious circumstances connected with
the case, and before acting the Embas
sador asked for a specific recital of all
the facts. These were not forthcoming
and the case was not pushed. When the
Carranza letter appeared stating that
one of his spies had been caught at
Tampa, It became apparent for the first
time that the efforts toward interven
tion were designed to secure the re
lease of his spy.
Aside from the official action of the
British Government, it is quite likely
the Canadian officials will take some
action against Carranza and Dv Bosc
under the Canadian statutes. When Sir
Louis Davies, Minister of Marine of the
Canadian Cabinet was here recently
he spo: --Â« of the determination of the
Canadian authorities to maintain the
strictest neutrality and see that the
Carranza party did not use Canada as
a base nf any hostile operations against
the United S*-tes. He referred to the
difficulty in making out a specific case
against them, saying that it was not
enough to present mere suspicion. He
sUd, however, thqt if such a case was
secured, the Canadian authorities
would act promptly in putting an end
to the abuse of hospitality shown by
the Spanish officials.
The Carranza letter furnishes lust
such a case as Sir Louis Davies re
ferred to, and leaves no doubt that the
Dominloti Government, as well as the
authorities in London, will see that the
Carranza-Du Bosc party no longer
abuse their residence in Canada by
making It the headquarters for a spy
system and base of Information for
General Blanco. Admiral Cervera and
authorities at Madrid
AMBULANCE
SHIP SOLACE
COMES HOME
Brings a Brave Band of Sick
and Wounded Boys
in Blue,
Robert Voltz of San Francisco
Among the Latter-Valorous
Deeds Recalled.
NEW YORK, June s.â The ambul
ance Bhip Solace came into port to-day
having on board fifty-four wounded
and sick, some of whom had been
transferred from the American war
ships in Cuban waters and others taken
from the hospitals at Key West.
Her afterdeck had been tented off
with canvas and in swinging ham
mocks lay half a dozen of the more
seriously ill of the patients. The con
valescing room was the basking place
of a score or more of the poor fellows
who had not given up the fight without
a struggle, while the privilege of the
decks had been accorded all those who
were able to move about or anxious to
watch the green hills as the good ship
moved in shoreward.
The Solace anchored off Tompkins
ville early this morning, where she was
boarded by a representative of the As
sociated Press. She left Key West
Wednesday afternoon last and made
the run to New York without incident
until Saturday night, when the gale
tumbled her about awhile and made
things to some extent uncomfortable
for the patients she carried. But the
seavoyage was a tonic to the men.
They had left behind the sweltering
heat of the tropicsâ had exchanged suf
focating and exhausting winds for re
freshing breezes. Many were nearing
home; all, almost, were to rest in the
heart of the great country they had
been fighting for. The Solace brought
in many a little band of heroes among
the fifty-four. They had gathered to
gether in small groups on the voyage
up many a time and told again the
story of a brush with the Spaniards or
a night on watch at the blockade.
Four of the heroes from the Nash
ville and the Marblehead were among
the patients on the Solaceâ Robert
Voltz of San Francisco and Henry
Hendricksen, John Davis and H. W.
Kuchmeister of New York. They are
the wounded of that gallant band of
volunteers who cut the cable at Cien
fuegos nearly a month ago. It is a
tale that has been told before, but that
noble effort will live in history side by
side with the Merrimac's journey down
into the narrows at Santiago harbor.
Commander McCalla of the Marble
head called for volunteers to man the
boats. Every hand went up and the
men begged for a call to the place of
danger. Lieutenant Winslow, Lieuten
ant Anderson and Ensign Magruder
were in charge as the seamen swept
the boats with easy stroke in shore. In
the rifle pits 2000 Spaniards had gath
ered. Shells from the warships were
directed along the coast line, and then,
with every man at his gun, the Marble
head, Nashville and Windom sailed,
watching for the voice that all knew
was inevitable.
The small boats made straight In. A
few hundred yards from shore and the
men were at work. They dragged up
the first cable and hacked through the
heavy strands; then found the second.
This was the Spaniards' signal, and
they opened fire. For half an hour the
gallant sailors worked amid a rain of
bullets. Meanwhile, the American war
ships were hurling shells and shot into
the enemy, who, nevertheless, kept up
a fierce fire. The men in the boats kept
coolly at their work. Never for a mo
ment did they falter.
Lieutenant Wlnslow lost three fingers
of his left hand by the explosion of a
shell, but he is still at Key "West, ready
for duty again.
John Reagan, on the Marblehead
boat, was shot through the chest. As
he fell, Private Marine Kuchmeister
stooped to assist him. At that Instant
a rifle ball struck Kuchmeister in the
jaw and passed out of his mouth. The
marine, hardly realizing how badly he
was injured, bandaged up his jaw with
a handkerchiew and tried to stop the
flow of blood from Reagan's wound, but
poor Reagan died a moment later.
Gunner's Mate Davis of the Marble
head was torn with a bullet in his
thigh and a moment after a one
pounder from shore had sent a shot
close enough to graze his arm.
Hendricksen and Voltz, the for
mer from the Marblehead, and
the latter from the Nashville are the
others of that gallant expedition who
will rarry the marks of heroism to the
grave. "When the revenue cutter iWn
dom brought Hendricksen and Voltz to
Key West, the hospital surgeons said
both would die. One had three bullet
wounds, this was Voltz. A 22-caliber
bullet had passed through the skull at
the base of the brain and out. Com
pared with this the other wounds were
insignificant. He was unconscious for
several days at the barracks hospital
at Key "Vvest, but gradually they
brought him around. Now Voltz looks
well. To be sure, he is still thin and
haggard, wears the bandages and says
that his head troubles him somewhat,
but Voltz is a hero like his three mates,
and there are many heroes in the
American navy.
Hendrickppn ivas shot through the
abdomen. The bullet passed completely
out, so great is the velocity of these
tiny steel missiles v: er the new meth
ods of propulsion. Hendri_ksen. when
seen aboard ship to-day, however, said
he would be fighting the Spanish again
before the end of the month, if there
was any fight left in them.
The Winslow sent one man here to re
mind the people north of that now fa
mous torpedo boat, and of " > terrible
engagement at Cardenas, when En
sign Bagley was killed â the first officer
of the American navy to fall in this war
with four of his men. He is Robert T.
Orubb, a landsman. Qrubb was among
those aboard at the time and with
others was rescued ly thp Hudson.
A victim of the Porto Rico bombard
ment was also brought here on the
Solace. George Merkle, a slender, pale
faced marine. He was on the lowa at
San Juan and* came out of the engage
ment lacking one arm. Those who h'tvp
been through the thick of the shot and
shell and have emerged unscathcl may
tell of marvelous escapes and thrilling
encounters, but Merkle tells another
story- The order to cease firing had
been given, the great guns on the lowa
â were silenced, men coma from tha tur
j rets to draw a frosh breath of life and
some went below as a routine course.
| Meanwhile, the monitor Terror, lying
i in closer than the others and, failing to
! see the signal, continued to pour in iron
I messengers. Men gathered on the gun
decks to watch the progress of the
light. Merkle came up from below and
was in the act of putting on his coat
when a shell plunged through the air
and exploded directly in front of him.
One piece struck Merkle on the right
elbow, tearing out the forearm. Thia
occurred after the battle was over.
Three men from the greatest of bat
tleships, the Oregon, were among the
patients of the Solaceâ who, by the
way, have been transferred to the
Marine Hospital in Brooklynâ Liouia
Upson, P. J. Lynch and Alonzo Gartley.
They were not the <nly ones to suffer
from the heart, reaking voyage of the
Oregon, but they were the most seri
ously ill, after the battleship reached
Key West, and it was deemed advisable
to send them to a more favorable cli
mate. No men are prouder of the grand
work of their ship than they.
One of the remarkable cases brought
by the ambulance ship is William Tay
lor, a Washington boy, and a first-class
apprentice on the cruiser Mew York.
Taylor's recovery' is the most marvelous
of any of those remarked upon by the
naval surgeon, (me day, soon after the
bombardment of Matanzas, through
which the men on the New York passed
without the slightest injury, a revolver
dropped from the belt of Boatswain
Mullen, and exploded. The bullet passed
through Taylor's right arm at the el
bow, entered the abdomer passed up
through the liver, grazed the lun~ and
came out through the left shoulder. An
operation for laparotomy was per
formed and Taylor recovered although,
naturally, he is still suffering from the
effects of his multiple wound and the
operation.

ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT DAUNT
LESS, off Santiago de C-iha, June 3, 7
a. m. (via Port Antonio. Jamaica, June
4.) â Knowing Hobson's desperate plan,
the dispatch boat took up a position at
punset opposite the narrow harbor en
trance and Just outside the line of the
blockading warships. The swift
tropical twilight blotted out the Cuban
shore like a dissolving view in a
theater.
The last sign of the doomed Merrimac
â¢Been from the dispatch boat was her
black shadow close in shore, seven
miles east of Morro, and probably
hidden from its lookouts by the high
land close to the coast.
All night long glasses had been
trained on the streak of gloom which
waa all that maVked the shoreline.
Heavy clouds blotted out the full moon,
except at brief intervals, when its light
brought out the shadowy bulk of the
battle-ships, which was as quickly
swallowed up again. Now and then a
signal light of the fleet winked and was
answered by another far down the
Then more darkness, silence
and waiting.
The center of interest, the moon, re
mained black. Knowing that one
tentative plan was for the fleet to chase
the Merrimac in as a pseudo blockade
runner using blank cartridges on her
and search lights to point to Hobson
the harbor entrance, every one waited
for this pyn technical display. But it
did not come, so Hobson had apparent
ly chosen the less spectacular but
equally desperate plan of quietly stalk
ing the forts alone and in darkness

Almost <at the same moment dawn

lay last night, loomed up the black
â¢â¢ssel.

I "pal clouds.
Suddenly a dazzling flash, like a.
graph ray, leaped from the battle
ts, followed by a slow-spreading
cloud of white smoke. There was no
report, but far up the coast a white jet
of spray leaped from the sea. The
battle-ships were waking up.
Glasses were trained where the Mer
rimac had been. She was gone. The
Vixen had been mistaken for her dur
ing the morning light. Glasses swept
the horizon in search for the Merrimac.
She was nowhere visible. Bright flashes
and billowing smoke arose from point
to point where the harbor batteries
were located. The Spaniards were
awake sure enough and buzzing like
an upset hive.
"Hobson has run in on them and
fooled us ali," was s.aid; "but." it was
!, "what are the idiots shooting
at?"
The spraying shells arose every
where, beyond the Brooklyn and in
side the Texas, but the fire was seem
ingly concentrated westward, close to
the shore. There a thin thread of
smoke disclosed their target, the New
York's launch, which Ensign Powell
had gallantly held close under Morro's
walls until after daylight, when, driven
out by the fire of the big guns, he had
run far up the shore, under the partial
cover of the bluffs, and had turned and
eventually boarded the Texas, out of
range. Then he passed on to the New
York. 0
The brave fellow was heartbroken at
not finding Hobson and his men. Be
ing closer than In the warships. Powell
had seen the firing before daylight,
when the Merrimac and her daredevil
crew, then well inside Morro Castle,
were probably first discovered by the
Spaniards. He also heard an explosion,
which may have been caused by Hob-
Fon's torpedo. The ensign was not sure.
Ke waited, vainly hoping to rescue the
heroes of the Merrimac, until he was
shelled out by the forts.
The fleet, seeing the launch return,
crowded close in shore to learn the
news, and learning it, went In closer
still, hoping to draw. the Spanish fire,
but the forts were silent. Inside the
hills enclosing- the harbor could be seen
a dense column of moving smoke, as at
least one Spanish vessel moved down
the tortuous channel to the harbor
mouth. She did not show beyond Cayo
smith while the Dauntless remained in
sight. Beyond that her way was
blocked by the Merrimac's hulk, sunk

where Hobson promised, crosswise of
the narrow channel.
Yesterday afternoon while the Merri
mac lay "stripped to the buff" for her
last desperate run, she was Inspected
by the Associated Press representative.
With hatches off, gaping cargo ports
swung back and everything valuable
removed save her engines and 2300 tons
of coal, that scarcely seemed to count
in her cavernous hold, she was not an
inviting spectacle.
The seven men who were to risk their
lives in her were as cheerful as school-
j boys on a frolic, despite twenty-four
! hours' sleeplessness and hard work.
Coxswain Deignan, with professional
[ pride, explained the several stations of
; the forlorn crew. Murphy was to cut
loose the forward anchor and Daniel
I Montague the after one, and they were
' then to jump overboard and swim to
! the lifeboat which was towing astern.
Phillips, Kelley and Crank were to
! stop the engines and knock away the
; kingston valves to flood the hold, and
Lieutenant Hobson and Charette were
', to fire the torpedoes from the bridge.
Words cannot paint the cool, matter
! of-fact heroism of these enlisted men,
I so calmly .confident of success in their
â  audacious undertaking, so implicitly
! trusting in the young lieutenant
j who was to lead them, so oblivious of
! everything except that they were going
j in. They did not speak of coming out,
' â¢with the exception of Delgnan, who
said nonchalantly:
"Oh, I guess we stand a fair show
of getting out; but they can't stop us
j from getting in." this last in a most
! matter-of-fact style, as though going in
i was the only point worth considering.
So it was to them. This was every
! day heroism â heroism in overalls and
' oil and coal dust from ankle to eye
: brow. Hobson. despite his uniform, was
almost as dirty and disheveled as his
men, with forty-eight hours' growth of
beard, eyes sunken for lack of sleep and
hands as black as a coal heaver's, but
; M>n hands were as cool and firm in
; ilieir grasp as though they were going
i on parade, and nothing would dull the
I fire of those sunken, hazel eyes. Re
i served, but courteous even to gentle
i ness, he spoke of his plans. He spoke
j as his men had spoken of going in,
j nothing of coming back, except this,
just at parting:
"Now, pardon me, but in case you
: gentlemen write anything of this expe
dition, please don't say anything mdii
i vidually about its members until you
know."
He accented the last word and the
inference was plain, "Until yo 1 . know
we are dead" would have filled out the
sentence.
While the Associated Press corre
spondent was on the birdge of the Mer
rimac, a young officer from the Marble
â  head came aboard on business. When
j he left he said:
"Shall we send you fellows over some
i breakfast? We would be delighted and
I can do it just as well as not."
"Never mind about the breakfast, old
I man," replied Hobson, "but if you can
â  send some coffee, we would be very
: glad. You see, we are swept pretty
clean here, and none of us have had a
drop of coffee since day before yester
day."
It was a trivial incident, but coming
from a man doomed to almost certain
death, it seemed to add the last touch
of the pathetic situation, heartbreak
ing enough in Itself.

THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 6, 1898.
WAR REVENUE
COMES FIRST
Week's Work Cut Out
For Congress.
NEED OF APPROPRIATIONS.
OPPONENTS OF ANNEXATION
CONFIDENT.
Declare There Is No Chance for the
Passage of the Hawaiian
Resolutions This
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June s.â The Senate
was so late setting through with the
war revenue bill Saturday as to pre
vent any consultation looking to a pro
gramme-for this week. The only posi
tive indications are that much of the
time will be given to the appropria
tion bills, which have been entirely
neglected since the revenue bill was
taken up.
There are three appropriation bills In
conference, and all are about ready to
be presented to the Senate Committee
on Conference Reports. These are the
sundry civil, Indian and postofflce bills.
All present some differences between
the two houses and each of them will
unquestionably be made the basis of
more or less debate. There are many
items of general Importance connected
with the sundry civil bill, and It may
consume a day or two of the Senate's
time.
The census bill also will receive at
tenton if opportunity is afforded. There
is a general desire to provide" for the
taking of the next census before ad
journment for the session, and the hope
Is now expressed by the friends of the
measure that the committee bill will be
accepted without a great deal of de
bate. The quarantine bill also occupies
a prominent place upon the calendar
and may be considered.
Whether the Hawaiian question shall
come up will depend largely upon the
action of the House. The general
understanding among Senators is that
the Newlands annexation resolution
will be acted upon by the House during
the week, but that the action will come
up in time for the Senate to take up the
same measure this week is doubted
even by the best friends of Hawaii in
that body. The opponents of annexa
tion still insist that there will be no
serious action by the Senate during this
session, but they agree that it almost
certainly will come to the front again,
and especially if the House acts. They
prophecy that in that event they will
soon be able to make it so evident that
final action is out of the question that
the friends of annexation will them
selves be willing to suspend the contest
until the short session next winter.
The conference on the revenue bill
between the two Houses will be inaug
urated during the week, but how long
it will continue or what the result will
be, there is yet no indication from any
source.
All parties ore counting upon the
general desire for adjournment to as
sist materially in expediting considera
tion, and each man hopes this interest
in adjournment will help his cause by
insuring acceptance to avoid delay in
getting away. A majority of Senators
still count upon reaching tho end of
the session by the first of July, and
some place the date much earlier, but
all admit their opinions are mere con
jecture. It is impossible to speak in
anywise definitely as to this matter un
til the Hawaiian question shall have
had an airing and the war revenue
bill shall be definitely disposed of. In ]
tho meantime the progress of the war
may raise other questions. So far,
however, as can be seen now, the pres
ent montb ought to and probably will
witness the final adjournment.
The war revenue bill as it passed the
Senate wil be â^sented to the House
when it meets to-morrow. The desire
of Chairman Dingley and the major
ity of the members of the Ways and
Means Committee is to send the bill
t<> conference at once and not delay it
by 'l-'bate. In accordance with this de
sire the Committee on Rules will report
immediately a rule identical with, or
generally In line with, the resolution
which Dtngley introduced last week to
provide for a motion to disagree to the
Senate amendments and request a con
ference. This motion will prevail with
out debate and conferees will be
named.
At present there Is an understanding
that the Hawaiian resolutions, provid- j
ing for annexation, are to be considered !
in the House before th<Â» session ad- I
journs. Just whnn and how the con
sideration shall proceed has not been
determined. A large element wants It
to come immediately after the revenue
bill is sent to conference, and are anx
ious to have the matter disposed of.
pending 1 the r^nbrt of the revenue bill
from conference. Another element be
lieves annexation should wait until af
ter the revenue bill has passed, so as to
avoid all possibility of complicating the
situation.
Appropriation bills will occupy much
attention. The conferees on the sundry
civil have reached an agreement oh
about four-fifths of the measure, but
cannot agree upon the remainder with
out taking the sentiment of their re
spective Houses.
A measure of importance that Is
likely to come up during the week is
the quarantine laws and give the Fed
eral authorities enlarged jurisdiction of
quarantines against infectious and epi
demic diseases. It proposes to make
supreme Federal rules and regulations.
FURTHER INVESTIGATION
IS NOT NECESSARY
Senators Satisfied With the Beport of
the Naval Court in the Maine
Disaster.
â WASHINGTON. June 5. â Senator
Chandler, from the Committee on Na
val Affairs, Saturday mndp a report to
the Senate on the resolution passed on
February 21 last directing an investiga
tion into the destruction of the battle
ship Maine. The committeemen say
that in view of the careful inquiry by
the naval court and that which was
later made by the Senate Committee on
F. >rf>ii?n Relations they deem an in
vestigation by the naval committee un
necessary and have therefore made
none.

XAPA, June s.â The most disastrous flre
that has visited Napa in several years oc
curred here this morning at 3:30 o'clock.
Flames were discovered In a Chinese
laundry, situated on First street, near

ply of water for the first few minutes
the conflatgration gained great headway
and spread into J. F. Bradt's blacksmith
shop on the corner, and to a dwelling
owned by J. Israelsky, next to the laun
dry. The blacksmith shop, laundry and
dwelling were totally destroyed and the
dwelling occupied by Israelsky was dam

The President Preparing In

Dewey to Raise the Blockade and
Trade With the World to
Be Restored.
NEW YORK, June 5.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President
McKinley will forward to Major-Gen
eral Merritt, as military governor of
the Philippines, within the next few
days, a schedule of rates to be applied
to Imports into the district which he
will govern.
Under the instructions which will be
given him his first act after the de
struction or surrender of Spain's mili
tary power in the far east, will be to
declare Manila an open port, and Rear-
Admiral Dewey will, accordingly, raise
the blockade. By this means it iscon
fidently expected in official circles that
trade with the Philippines will be im
mediately resumed by foreign mer
chants and by taxing goods which they
will bring into the country satisfactory
revenue will be obtained.
The revenues obtained from the Phil
ippines will be known as "military con
tributions," and will be collected by
officers designated by Major-General
Merritt. There will be no export tax,
such as was imposed by Spain, but all
importations into the islands will be
taxed in accordance with the rates
which Spain has hitherto imposed.
The adoption of the Spanish system
of taxation has arisen from the desire
of the President and Secretary Gage
not to throw merchants trading with

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, June s.â lt transpires that
Pat Galvin's hurried trip to Dawson in
April, from which he returned- in May,
concerned a mining deal involving
$5,000,000. Galvin has undertaken to
purchase Klondike placers worth that
sum foV the North British American
corporation, which Galvin organized in
London last fall with a capital of $3,
500,000.
The properties on which Galvin has
secured options include some of the
richest mines on El Dorado, Bonanza.
Sulphur and Bear creeks. Experts of
international reputation have been ex
amining' the mines which were recom
mended to the company for purchase
by Galvin, and their report will soon
be made. Galvin says the report
will unquestionably be favorable, re
sulting in the biggest placer mine sale
ever made on this continent.
Galvin is the company's general man
ager. While in Dawson six weeks ago
he purchased $60,000 worth of real es
tate on which stores and warehouses
costing $140,000 are being erected. The
company intends to deliver 700 tons of
provisions at Dawson for its employes
and stores before navigation closes.
The company will operate on the Yu
kon its own river steamer, the Mary
Ellen Galvin, which is to be towed from
San Francisco to St. Michael two weeks
hence.
The company has purchased a one

The Chinese problem is influencing
the authorities a great deal in consid-
I ering the retention of the Philippines.
Great Britain and Japan are necessarily
I desirous that the ports of China shall
i be open to trad.\ and it is naturally the
policy of the United States.
Minister Denby has informed the
State Department of the probability
j that Russia and Germany will close
! Shantung and Manchuria to foreigners,
j thus reaping commercial benefits tor
their own merchants, and this undoubt
! edly will be seriously objected to by
Great Britain and Japan and by the
United States if it is determined to re
tain the Philippines.
With the Philippines situated In a
favorable postion for trade with China,
j if some of its benefits are to accrue to
American commerce the Islands must
bo continued under the American Hag.
Minister Denby states in his report
that the foreign trade of China for lS9fi
was $270,633,000. If the autonomy of
China is preserved Minister Denby de
clares that there will be an immense
development of trade in which the
United States will share. Much depends
upon whether the treaties are upheld
and whether access is assured to all
foreigners in Shantung and Manchuria,
which Germany and* Russia claim as
their own sole preserve?.
McDonald is one of the promotors of
this enterprise.
Galvin's company has also invested
in 1300 cattle which are brine? shipped
to Dawson under the management <>f

forwarded from Ta coma and Vancouver.
j They will "be driven over the Dalton

a butcher-shon on a large scale. Eighty
men will be employed all summer hand

Yesterday in a yelling, bellowing, ocherous screed
it gave a shameless exhibition of all of them. It
claimed to have correspondents in the audience cham
bers of crowned heads and in the counsel rooms of
other dignitaries. Yet it is still fresh in the minds
of men that the so-called interviews with Bismarck
have been denied by his secretary, that the reported
conversations with the Pope, the Kaiser and the Queen
Regent of Spain have been refuted, that the alleged
talk with Roosevelt has been roundly denounced by
that gentleman as a lie, and that the asserted inter
view with Mrs. McKinley has been denied by the
private secretary of the President and the publication
of it rebuked as an outrage upon womanhood as well
as a deception upon the public
The yellow puff contained the mrther claim: "From
Manila an Examiner-Journal man sent the first
graphic story by an eye-witness of Dewey's great vic
tory." This is a cunningly worded lie, but neverthe
less a lie. The claim is not made that an Examiner-
Journal man witnessed the battle, but only that he
sent the first story told by one who was a wit
ness. Even that is false. The Call correspondent,
Mr. Stickney, was on Dewey's flagship and watched
the battle from that standpoint. His story was the
first given to the public. The Examiner-Journal
faked a story from a short dispatch given them by the
Chicago Record, and in publishing the mass of trash
and falseness impudently claimed the Record cor
respondent as their own. For this the two Hearst
lings were denounced by the Record and their lying
exposed. To this day neither the Journal nor the Ex
aminer has ever given to its readers a true account or
even a fair account of the victory at Manila.
Such, tersely and hastily enumerated, are some of
the facts concerning the war news service of the Ex
aminer. They show how it has applied to the collec
tion of war news unlimited quantities of

A STREET-PAVING EXPERIMENT.
PHILADELPHIA has some cobblestone pave
ment* lingering among her generally well im
proved streets, and her people have long had
â Â» desire to get rid of them. Accordingly a great deal
of interest has been shown there in a recent proposi
tion from certain responsible contractors to pave the
cobblestones with asphalt and keep them in repair
for ten years at a cost of $i per square yard.
The contractors, according to the Philadelphia
Times, propose using the existing cobblestone pave
ments as a foundation without further preparation ex
cept to ram thoroughly the cobbles before applying
the binder coat and asphalt surface. The Times adds:
"It is claimed that by this method the cost of paving
can be reduced to $i per square yard, the cost at
present being about $i 60. Those who advocate the
new method claim that it has been tried in this and
other cities and that it furnishes as substantial a pave
ment as when spread upon a basis of pounded stone
or concrete, and that contractors will be willing to
lay the pavement at $1 per yard and guarantee its
wearing qualities for a period of ten years."
Other Philadelphia papers are equally favorable to
the proposed plan. The Record, .for example, says:
"The city authorities ought to jump at the offer made
by responsible contractors to resurface the
cobble streets with asphalt and guarantee to keep
them in repair for ten years at an original cost of $1
per square yeard. Ten years of saving in repairs,
costly sweeping, wear and tear of vehicles and nerves
and difficult cartage would be worth to the city and
dwellers in the city more than $1 per square yard."
San Francisco has a number of cobblestone streets
which are about as bad as any in Philadelphia. They
entail a heavy cost on all street traffic, wear out
vehicles, depreciate property values and irritate the
nerves of all who have to pass along them. More
over, thesr pavements are on the principal streets of
the city, and therefore doubly objectionable. We
have, then, an interest in the proposed Philadelphia
experiment. If there is any way in which a cobble
stone pavement can be transformed into a good
asphalt pavement at a cost not exceeding $t a square
yard with a guarantee of ten years' service we shall
be glad to know of it.
As a camping place the Presidio did not get a fair
trial. There are hundreds of acres there which would
be ideal for the purpose. All they need is water, and
if the Government is unable to secure this it is worse
off than there has been any reason for supposing.
Some gentleman writes in the Arena about "The
Decadence of Patriotism," but possibly it is senile de
cay which is troubling him.
A CHfINCE FOR MEN.
â¦ * PEAKING of women denying themselves
>^ the latest creations of the Paris milliner and
h â modiste," says the New York Commercial
Advertiser, "why should not the masculine .fraternity
show an equal patriotism by boycotting French
wines and using American wines?"
The pertinence of this question addressed to the
wine users of the East is increased by the arrangement
of a reciprocity treaty with France which admits the
import of French wines at such law rates of duty as
to render them formidable competitors to American
wine producers. The point made by our New York
contemporary is therefore one which should be re
iterated and emphasized.
The proposal of a large number of influential
women to turn aside from Parisian goods during the
war and bestow their patronage on American goods
ought not to be called a boycott. The spirit that
prompted the ladies in making this resolve was one
of genuine patriotism. As such it has been every
where recognized and widely commended. The move
ment thus inspired is above the dignity of a boycott
and ranks with those enterprises which tend to the
upbuilding of home prosperity by supporting home
industries.
Since the action of the women of the land has been
so widely approved by men, it is certainly fair to ask
the men to follow the example they have approved.
California wine is better and purer than nine-tenths
of the French wine brought into the country. It is,
therefore, more beneficial to the health and more en
joyable to the palate of those who know good wine
when it is set before them. Its enlarged use would
be for the advantage of the consumer as well as that
of the producer, and a distinct gain would result for
all parties.
Protection accorded to home industry by law
should be accompanied by a popular patronage of
home industry in order that the law may have the
fullest and best effect. The Commercial Advertiser
is on the right track in advising Eastern men to
patronize American wines. It should be borne in
mind, however, that the prime object of the move
ment is not to injure France, but to benefit the United
States. It is not a measure of hostility to end with the
ending of the war, but an industrial measure to con
tinue for all time. To patronize home industry is one
of the patriotic duties of a people, and it will be a
good day for the United States when it becomes a
matter of universal practice.
THE OREGON ELECTION.
BY reason of the fact that it is to be the first trial
of strength between the political parties of the
country in the selection of Congressmen this
year, the election in Oregon to-day will be watched
and the results studied with close attention. It is the
preliminary contest in a struggle which is to be waged
in every other Congressional district in the Union this
fall, and public interest in it is, therefore, keen and
widespread.
There are three tickets in the field, for the Bryanite
leaders have not been able to whip all the Populists
into line, and a Middle-of-the-Road Populist party
will contest with Republicans and Democrats for su
premacy. There is to be elected a full State ticket,
two members of Congress, county officers and mem
bers of the Legislature, and the legislators in turn
are to choose a United States Senator. The offices
at stake are therefore sufficient to bring out a fairly
full vote of the people, and it is not likely that either
side will lose by reason of the indifference of its
members.
As was to have been expected, the financial ques
tion â a survival of 1896 â has been the dominant issue
of the campaign. It is true that the free silver move
ment is virtually dead, but the new questions which
are now being rapidly shaped by the war and by the
grewing demand for currency reform have not yet
been formulated with sufficient clearness to be pre
sented to the people as party issues. These questions
will undoubtedly come to the front in the elections
this fall, for they are now being discussed in Con
gress, but in Oregon the contest was of necessity
confined to the issues of the past. By the vote of to
day, therefore, we will not have a sure basis for cal
culating the probable vote of the country in Novem
ber, but we will have an evidence of how far the Re
publican party holds the tidal wave strength of the
Presidential election.
In 1896, when the fusion of all the silver forces was
complete, the Republicans carried Oregon by over
2000 majority. This year the bolt of the Middle-of-the
Road Populists will detract from the strength of the
Bryanites and will go far to counterbalance any fall
ing off in the Republican ranks from the enthusiasm
of the great campaign for sound money and protection
which elected McKinley. Unfortunately, however,
there is a split in the Republican party in Portland
and this may have a bad effect not only on the local
ticket, but on the State and the Congressional ticket.
The conflict is therefore a close one and neither side
has any apparent advantage over the other.
The seeming equality of conditions under which
both sides are making the fight will add to the sig
nificance of the result. The Republicans have taken
a bold and unequivocal stand for the maintenance of
the gold standard. Their opponents have just as
boldly and clearly made an effort to revive Bryanism
and free silver. On that issue there ought to be no
doubt of the result. Oregon can surely be counted on
to vote right on an issue which is to determine
whether she is to get good money or depreciated
money for her products, and in which kind the Gov
ernment is to pay her patriotic volunteers.
A LESSON FROM THE SOUTH-
ONE of the most notable features of the cam
paign of education carried on by the Southern
States for the purpose of attracting men and
capital is the elaborate way in which they advertise
the extension and expansion of their manufacturing
industries. Every week a statement is sent out giving
details of the number of new mills or improvements
in old ones in the South. The showing for any one
week is not great, but the repetition of these state
ments has all the effect of incessant advertising, and
the whole country is compelled to give attention to
Southern development.
An illustration of the method pursued is to be found
in the statement now going the rounds of the East
ern press, which runs thus: "Touching new enter
prises inaugurated in the South during the last week
the following may be mentioned among the more im
portant items: A flouring mill in Alabama; a cotton
mill in Georgia; a stave mill in Kentucky; a rice
mill in Louisiana; a sawmill in Mississippi; in
North Carolina a flouring mill, a tobacco factory
and a mica mine; in South Carolina a cotton mill,
a $100,000 construction company and a roller flouring
mill; a chair and carriage factory in Middle Ten
nessee: machine shops, two lumber companies, an
electric light plant, a mineral oil company, a tobacco
factory and a 125-ton cottonseed oil mill at Texas
points; a tobacco factory and a $200,000 quarrying:
THE SAX FKAIN T CISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 6, 1898.
company in Virginia, and a sawmill in West Vir
ginia."
A sawmill here, a flouring mill there, a mica mine
in one place and a tobacco factory in another, are
little things in themselves, but in the aggregate they
make a telling paragraph which is sure to be widely
copied, and the whole South gets the benefit of the
free advertising. Men are interested in such an item
because it is a statement of facts. It is not descriptive
writing of glow and glamour, but news. Papers copy
it and people read it because it is of current interest.
Each statement of the kind counts, and when they
follow one another week after week and month after
month the public mind becomes impressed with the
idea that the South is flourishing and that it is a safe
land to go to for investment of capital or for the
making of a home.
The great States of the West might profitably fol
low the South in this method of advertising. There
is an association in the Southern States with cor
respondents in every locality which gathers the infor
mation and makes it public. A similar organization
should be established on the Pacific Coast to collect
with equal diligence information of every new indus
trial enterprise on the coast. If this were done the
record would far outstrip that of the South. Our
mines and mills and factories are greater and richer
than those of the South, and our weekly or monthly
statements would have a wider reading and make a
deeper impression.
A movement of this kind could be appropriately
undertaken in connection with the proposed Pacific
Coast exposition to be held in commemoration of the
semi-centennial of the discovery of gold. The enter
prise should be the work of the whole coast and not
of a single State. The South has shown us how to
get free advertising of a high value, and we ought to
be wise enough to profit by the example.
THE STATE OF TRfIDE.
IT is a curious fact that in May, the first month of
the war, commercial failures were smaller than for
May, 1897, when the country was at peace. It is
another curious fact that the longer the war goes
on the less is heard about it in commercial circles.
One might easily fancy, from the general indifference
regarding it, that war was the natural condition of the
country. Except in Wall street, there is positively no
visible effect on general trade. At the outset a few
lines were disturbed, but they quickly became adapted
to their new conditions and business is now peaceful
and humdrum as usual.
The pivot on which everything is now swinging is
contained in the single word, Crops. One hears
nothing else, either here or in the East. From all of
the great grain producing sections of the land except
California come reports of brilliant crop outlooks,
and if they are realized the yield for 1898 will be un
precedented. This prospect, with the termination of
the May deal in wheat at Chicago, has caused a sharp
decline in wheat, though at the close more firmness
is apparent, and a reaction is not improbable. Other
grains have sympathized more or less, and several
have gone down, too, but corn is higher under a heavy
demand for export.
Possibly the brilliant showing of the wheat crop has
stimulated business, but at any rate reports from all
over the country indicate a fine wholesale and retail
trade, and the present influx of fall orders leads to the
opinion that the fall trade will be the best seen for
years. All lines of merchandise are participating in
this demand, which shows that the inquiry for goods
is legitimate and popular, and therefore an indication
of an increased purchasing capacity on the part of the
public. This is borne out by the continued gain in
bank clearings, those for the whole country last week
being 30.3 per cent more than for the same week in
1897. The failures are also smaller, being 222 for the
week, against 241 for the corresponding week last
year. The continued decrease in these failures is one
of the most gratifying signs of the times.
The great staples, which financiers watch with vigi
lance, are exhibiting increased activity, and the ten
dency in prices is upward rather than downward.
Cotton and wool, which have been the dullest of all
lines for some months, are the most conspicuous ex
amples of this gain, and both are firm, though busi
nesi in the latter is still light. Wheat leads the export
list, the foreign shipments for the week aggregating
5,248,086 bushels, against 4,309,000 bushels last week,
2,020,000 bushels in this week a year ago, 3,209.000
bushels in 1896, 2,991,000 bushels in 1895 and 2,742,000
bushels in 1894. The demand for iron continues
phenomenal, the monthly consumption of pigiron
amounting to 1,000,000 tons. The demand is largely
for agricultural implements, showing a prosperous
condition of the farming community, though struc
tural work, for building operations, comes in for a
good share.
There are indications that the public is drifting back
into Wall street, being attracted by the recent im
provement in prices, though the professional ma
nipulators still hold the major part of the market. A
pronounced victory at Santiago de Cuba would prob
ably add a further stimulus to this great trading mart
and draw back still more of the public. As it is there
has been a marked improvement in Government and
railroad bonds, with increased buying by London.
Locally there is little new to report. Throughout
the whole Pacific Coast there were only ten failures
last week, against seventeen for the same week last
year, last week's record being almost unprecedented.
The grain markets continue quiet, and beyond the
decline in wheat show no particular change. Mer
chandise is going off well and quotations exhibit few
fluctuations. The hay, grain and fruit crops are now
coming forward, and the prices received are rather
above those of last year as a rule, while the quantity
and quality of all three are superior to the indications
of a month ago, thanks to the late rains. Still the
output of the State is far below the normal this year,
and there will be little if any wheat for export.
Texas is a great State, but the plan she follows
of burning at the stake a certain class of offenders will
never meet with the approval of the thoroughly civil
ized. Dispatches relate that at the latest episode of
this kind "prominent lawyers" made speeches to the
crowd. A step in the direction of reform would be
to send a few "prominent lawyers" to jail for the
term of their unnatural lives.
The best medals for the brave men who steamed
into Santiago on the Merrimac would bear the in
scription, "In God We Trust" and be good for $20
worth of goods anywhere in the world.
So the man who headed the expedition into the
mouth of Santiago harbor is known as a non-com
batant. It would be interesting to know what ele
ments go to make up a fighter.
One objection to sending East for equipment which
could be bought here more cheaply is that when a
soldier of Uncle Sam is naked he really deserves a
coat without delay.
Perhaps the once good ship Centennial got its
name because a hundred years have elapsed since it
was safe to go to sea in.
THE SOLDIER'S HEART.
Where is the heart of a soldier.
Ilia thought, his hope and his dream.
When the rifles ring and the bullets sing
And the flashing sabers gleam?
Oh, not on the field of battle,
But .far and far away,
His heart is living the old. old hopes,
While his sword is red In the frayt
Where Is the heart of a soldier.
And what do the bugles wake,
And what does the roar of the cannon mean
When the hills beneath them shake?
Oh. not for him the glory.
And the dash and crash of war.
But his heart is away on a mission gay
Where they hear no cannon roar!
And there Is the heart of a soldierâ
A little home on the hill,
A white-faced woman, a little child.
That stand by the window sill; I
A little song and a little prayer,
And a wonder in the face,
And a "God save papa and bring him back
In the goodness of thy grace!"'
And there 1b the heart of a soldier-
Not on the field of fight,
But steepedMn the dream of a saddened home
Where a window keeps its light,
That a soldier's feet may keep the path
And his way may homeward lead.
When under the flag of the freedom-land
He has wrought the hero's deed.
Yea. there Is the heart of a soldier.
Where wife and baby are.
Though his eyes and his will may follow
The light of the battle star;
Though his hand may swing to the saber,
And his bayonet charge the foe,
The soldier's heart is away, away.
In the home where they miss him so!

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
A new netting against the attack of tor
pedo boats has been tried in the British
navy with satisfactory results. The
meshes are smaller and the rings thicker
than in the Bullivant and other styles
now rejected, and will be able to resist the
shears of torpedo net cutters. As a pre
liminary the channel fleet will be supplied
with this new netting.
The Marshal Deodoro and Marshal
Floriano, coast defense ships of 3162 tons,
building In France for the Brazilian navy,
are fitted with the inclined turrets de-
signed by Chief Constructor Hichborn, U.
S. N. Considerable weight is saved by
having the armored turret top Incline at
an angle whereby a thickness of S inches
will offer the resistance of lOVi inches
placed vertically.
The difficulty of making the limited
number of engineers suffice for the great
number of ships in the British navy is be
ing overcome by the admiralty in the in
troduction of warrant rank to machinists.
The plan has only been in operation since
last January, hut gives promise of success,
and the machinists are filling the places
hitherto held by commissioned officers.
This leaves a surplus of assistant engin
eers available for duty in ships. A sim
ilar programme is proposed in the bill for
the reorganization of the navy now be
fore Congress and is likely to become a
law.
Attention was recently called in the
House of Commons to the fact that twen
ty-eight war vessels were in course of
construction at private shipyards in Great
Britain for foreign countries, and Arnold
Foster desired to introduce a bill making
it obligatory upon the builders to relin-
I quish the ships to the British Government
i in the event of a demand to that effort.
The Armstrong Company at Elswick,
which is the principal builder of foreign
war vessels, had, however, given it as
their opinion that as soon as a first pay
\ ment had been made by the government
for which a ship was being built, the ves
sel became the property of that particular
country and the builder had no right to
turn the ship over to any other except
with the consent of the contracting gov
ernment.
European naval powers are paying
much attention to armored cruisers and
each country differs as to types and sizes.
Since the New York and Brooklyn were
built in the United States this class of
vessels has been recognized as being of
great value and France in the Entrecast
eaux made almost an exact copy of the
New York, excepting the speed, which in
the French ship is less than in the Ameri
can. Russia has built the Rurik and Ros
sia of 10,923 and 12,130 tons and is building
another of 12,336 tons. Great Britain is
building four of 12,000 tons, and in France
one of 12,728 tons, with 18,200 horse power,
is shortly to be begun. The ship is to be
named the Suffren and will be 41S feet in
length and a beam of 71 feet 2 inches.
Austria, on the other hand, does not run
into mammoth dimensions, but contents
itself with a vessel of 6100 tons and 8600
horse power, to have a speed of 20 knots.
Armor-piercing projectiles in the British
navy are put to very severe tests before
being accepted from the contractor. In
the first place they must be of forged and
hardened steel, annealed at least 1200 de
grees Fahrenheit after forging. Before
the ballistic test the projectile is tested
for initial strain by being cooled to 40 de
grees and plunged into water at 180 to
212 degrees and again cooled off to 40 de
grees. The next trial Is by subjecting the
interior of the shell to a hydraulic pres
sure of 500 pounds to the square inch. The
final test is their ability to penetrate ar
mor, and two projectiles are taken at ran
dom from the lot to be accepted and fired
with a velocity of 1500 feet per second
against a steel plate in thickness one and
one-eighth the caliber of the shot. If two
out of three projectiles pass through
plate and wood backing without material
cracks or deformation the lot is accepted.
Other alternative tests are to penetrate a
nickel-steel oil-tempered and annealed ar
mor plate 4M> inches thick for 8-Inch; 534
inches for 10-lnch and 7 inches for a 12
lnch shell. With a striking velocity of 900
foot seconds two out of three shells must
pass through without breaking up or De
ing materially deformed.

THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS.
A very common error is prevalent that
the work of reporters, given in newspa
pers, as a rule ia not entitled to respect
or credence. It Is generally assumed that
the reporter writes chiefly or wholly to
make a sensation or in some way interest
readers without regard to facts, while
Just the reverse is the truth in all reputa
ble newspaper establishments.
It is safe to assume that the statements
of reporters given in the leading reputa
ble journals of the country are quite as
truthful ft* bxm th* o-onaraJ s La-laments
from the pulpit whet the minister gets
outside of strictly jeligious teachings,
and very much more truthful than are
the public expressions .of most if not all
of the leading profession. With very few
exceptions the rnanagereent of our lead
ing daily newspapers enforce truthfulness
and fairness as the supreme attribute for
a newspaper writer, and yet it is com
mon for all who are displeased with any
reportorial statement to say that "it's
a mere newspaper story."
It is true that there are a few conspicu
ous exceptions to the rule that governs
the reputable newspapers of the country.
Not only are the managers of our lead
ing newspapers entitled to great credit
for the scrupulous care they enforce on
their reporters and correspondents to pre
sent the truth with as exact fairness as
is possible, but the public little know the
ceaseless care that is exercised in every
reputable newspaper office to prevent the
publication or even the truth when it
would be more harmful to publish than
to suppress it. There is not a wÂ«ek, in
deed hardly a day, that tne newspapers
of this city do not suppress the facts
proper for public information which
would make a most interesting story
solely because it would bring a hood of
sorrow to the innocent and helpless and
cast an imperishable shadow upon their
lives. With all the errors necessarily
committed in a newspaper office by rea
son of the haste with which the articles
must often be prepared, the public luue
know with what thorough integrity the
newspapers, as a rule, protect the inno
cent even at the cost of suppressing legit
imate and interesting information. The
skeletons of hundreds of households are
carefully guarded in the newspaper of
fices of the country, and generally with
out even the knowledge of the people who
are thus protected.â Philadelphia Times.

BOY DROWNED IN THE
BAY NEAR EL CAMPO
EDWARD BOYLE WAS TAKEN
WITH CRAMPS.
He Was Trying to Swim Behind a
Boat in Which Were His
Brother and Two Lit
tle Friends.
1 Edward Boyle, the 15-year-old son of
J. J. Boyle, a clerk in the license office,
was drowned near El Catnpo yesterday
afternoon while trying to .swim in the
bay. The accident happened about 2
o'clock, Just before ebb tide, and as it
is at a place where the water is at least
fifty feet deep it is doubtful whether tho
body will be recovered.
The boy left h >me with his you
brotl . Herbert early in the mornii
outinc :tt El Campo. Shortly

t and Ch i rson, of the same
;.- Kdward, hired a boat for a row

a neighbor of Mr. Boyle took the sur

T. 1\ Boyle, who notitied the parents at
their home, 2011 Vallejo street. Herbert,
who was compelled to watch his brother
drown, while powerless to aid him, thinks
that Edward must have been taken with
cramps, which made him lose his hold on
the boat. The accident happened Just op

This Country Has a Mission.
Dr. C. E. Locke of the Central Meth
odist Church on Mission street, who
Just returned from an Eastern trip, oc
cupied his pulpit last night, and as"~a
consequence every seat was tilled. His
r lecture was on the war and what God ex
pects from the people of the United
States. He commenced by reciting some
of the wonderful things the Almighty
brings about In his own way. "We were
now at war with a nation that by its
money and arms conquered this portion
of the country at a time when there wore
no Anglo-Saxons, on its surface. At that
time, 1620, two ships arrived on the Amer
ican continent; one landed Its passengers
at Plymouth and the other at the mouth
of the James River. But the object
o* each was very different; "one came in
search of liberty and eelf-government,
while the other came to plant slavery and
rule with a tyrannical form of govern
ment.
God in his wisdom reserved this conti
nent for a race which was destined by
his holy will to spread liberty and free
dom throughout the entire world. Now
the time hail arrived to carry out* tbtso
great and grand ideas to the pagans of
the Orient^ Over in the /Philippine
Inlands there is not to-day one single
Protestant church, for the policy of the
Spanish Government Is to shut out tbrÂ»
light -of liberty and freedom, but God had
In his wisdom sent a Dewey, who will
open up the country for liberty and light. J
. (Applause.) It Is the bounden duty of j
the United States to retain not only the !
Philippine Islands, but every other island j
which may be taken by the arms of our i
brave boys, each and every one of whom
carries' the banner of liberty and free
dom with him.
. "This, like all American wars," he con
tinued, "is not one of conquest or terri
torial aggrandizement, but one of hu
manity. The Alinlgniy, who knows what
is best for his people, always raises men
for the occasion." The lives of Glad- j
stone and Lincoln werÂ« rited in proof of '
this, as both have figured in the nine
teenth century as having done more than
any other two. men for the sufferings of
the human family. As It has been in the
past so will it in the future. There will
always be men for the occasion, pro
vided the cause be just as ours is at the
present time.
"An alliance with England, the mother
country, was devoutly to be- hoped for,
an by It and with it a system of arbitra
tion would be established, and this would
bÂ« the last war where human blood would
be .phed for the righting of national
â¢wrongs. And furthermore the two great
nations would spread the gospel of Chris
tianity, freedom and equality over the
entire world." . _â  *

HURRYING TO
HONOLULU
Quick Dispatch for the
Mohican.
SAILED ON SHORT NOTICE.
RELIEVES THE BENNINGTON
AT HONOLULU.
Repairs to the Collier Brutus Com
pletedâShe Will Sail To-Day
in Company With the
Monterey.
The water front was busier than usual
yesterday. At the Mail dock a double
force of men was at work on the
steamers China and Colon, while at the
Oceanic dock the finishing touches
I were being put on the Zealandia, and
i the Btores for the soldiers were being )
i. shipped. At Folsom-street wharf noth- i
, Ing was being done to the Centennial, j
but around the landing place the
; launches from the Monterey and Mohi
! can made thiners live)- for a time.
The Mohican came down from the j
navy yard early in the morning. She |
: will make a quick trip to Honolulu, j
â  i-.nd on her arirval at the islands she j
will relieve the gunboat Bennington, !
the latter going to Manila to Join Ad- i
' miral Dewey's fleet. The sloop-of-war |
must have left Mare Island after being
fitted out in a hurry. She was short of \
'< both potatoes and butter and the mess
boys were skirmishing around to lay :
In supplies. They were not very sue- ;
cessful as all the stores were closed, j
and when the last boat left for the !
' sloop-of-war the various messes were
little better off than when the Mohican
left the navy yard.
Captain Book is again in command
of the Mohican, and he has the same :
, officers with h.m that went out on the I
war ship with the apprentices. About ;
! forty of the latter are still aboard, but
their hopes for seeing a tight are sure i
; to be disappointed as the war will !
never reach Hawaii. The sloop-of-war ,
has her bunkers well filled, and consid- !
erable coal in sacks is piled on deck. '
. She will proceed under both sail and
steam, and Captain Book expects to
make the run to the islands in eight
days. In that event the Mohican will
reach Honolulu about forty-eight hours
1 before the Monterey, which will sail to- i
day.
There was little or no excitement
over the sailing of the Mohican. About ''
noon time two wagon loads of mall
came down from the Postoffice, and
the Monterey's launch put it aboard the
Mohican. At 1 p. m. the anchor was j
hove up short, and at 1:30 the man-of- |
war got under way and steamed out '
i through the Golden Gate.
The Monterey came down from the '
1 navy yard last Friday, and the gen- i
i eral belief was that she would get i
', away for Honolulu, en route to Manila. '
; early Saturday morning. She lay at
anchor off Folsom street with steam
up all day awaiting the arrival of her
consort, the collier Brutus from th<
navy yard, but at evening the news !
; came that something had happened to |
the collier's low pressure cylinder, and
; that it would take some little time to
. make repairs. All of yesterday the
Monterey still waited, and during th*
afternoon word came that the Brutus
was having a trial trip, and if every
thing was successful she would be
down this morning. In that event both
warship and collier will lf>ave for the
islands about 1 p. m. to-day.
The Monterey and Brutus will go to
Honolulu at a uniform speed of about
10 knots an hour. At that rate It will
take them nine days to cover the dis
tance. Going 10 knots an hour the coast
! defense steamer has enough coal
aboard to take her to Honolulu, but If
forced to a greater speed of say 12
knots the consumption of coal would be
po great that the supply would be all
burned up in six days, or twenty-four
hours before her destination could be
reached. After arriving at Honolulu
th^ Monterey will be recoaled, and will
then start for Manila In tow of the
Brutus.
Masters of American vessels are pro
ceeding very cautiously these days, and
those on ships bound from Japan to
New York are taking no chances. The
bark J. B. Walker left Hlogo, Japan, on
April 23 for New York, and instead of
going there direct Captain Wallace
headed for Honolulu in order to find
out the status of the war. On May 22,
in latitude 28 deg. 42 mm. north, lon
gitude 157 deg. 35 mm. west, he met the
barkentine Archer bound for San Fran
cfseo and spoke her. Both vessels were
hove to, and Captain Wallace went
aboard the Archer, where he was
warmly welcomed by Captain Calhoun.
The latter got together all the papers
; he had on board and gave them to
j Wallace, who was only too glad to get
them. When the news of Admiral
| Dewey's victory was told to the men on
; the Walker they cheered again and
, again, .md then they gave three cheers
: for Captain Calhoun and the Archer for
i having given them the good news.
The chances are that the transports
Zealandla, Colon and China will be
ready by Tuesday night and will go out
into the stream Wednesday. It will
then be Friday before the last of the
. supplies can be got aboard the vessels
i ready for sea. Whether a sailor's preju
i dices against sailing on a Friday will
; be taken into account or not remains
to be seen.
The schooner Repeat, which came in
from Grays Harbor last Saturday, an
| chored near the telegraph cable and
dragged down on it Sunday. The tug
Reliance was sent out to her, and after
some trouble the anchor was freed
from the cable and the schooner moved
to Mission Bay.
The Retail Grocers held a picnic at
Schuetzen Park, San Rafael, yesterday,
and a great crowd went across the bay
to attend It. The steamer Tiburon,
which left this side at 9:30 and 11 a. m.
and 1:30 p. m., must have taken over
fully 6000 people, and even then there
were hundreds who missed the boats.
Young Men for the Hour.
Dr. James A. B. Wilson of the Howard- i
. street Methodist Church who has lately
â¢ been transfered from Los Angeles, where !
j he spent three years, has by his earnest- I
| ness and stirring sermons and lectures ]
' added many members to his church. In i
physique and manner of discourse he re
minds one of the late Dr. Cox of the j
same denomination. In his lecture last
night he spoke on the "Young Men for
thÂ« Hour," taking his text from: Prob. '
! xvl:32, "He that ruleth his own spirit is
greater than he that takes a city." He
said In part:
The hour reveals a marvelous change of i
conditions over a former period. We, as a
nation, are becoming urban rather than ru
ral. Thus In 1820 we had but six cities of 8000
Inhabitants or over, but now we have tM,
with 80 per cent of our population In oitlt-s, !
and In twenty-five years at the rate of Increase I
now being; made, the cities will have 10,000,000 i
majority In the whole country. Our cities are I
the worst governed of any ki the civilized I
world. The worst class of our population dom
inates the politics of our municipal life.
There Is before us the absolute overthrow
of our Institutions and the utter subversion
of the moral life of the nation.
This Is a young man's problem. My gen
eration will have nothing; to do with Its so
lution. The preparation for this new patriot
ism must be strength. Intelligence, morality,
discipline and religion. He is not prepared to
deal with the monotonous question of citizen
ship who does not accept the highest ideal of
the universe as hie standard.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 6, 1898.
"POPE BOB"
IS DEFENDED
Edwards Davis Delivers
an Erratic Lecture.
HE REVERES THE INFIDEL
SMALL AUDIENCE AT METRO
POLITAN HALL.
The Lecturer Attacks Catholicism,
Protestantism and Various Other
Creeds in Order to Defend
the Great InfldeL
Rev. Edwards Davis, the sensational
pulpit orator who achieved considerable
notoriety as Oakland's "actor-preacher"
when advertised by the yellow journal a
few years ago, defended Colonel Robert
G. Ingersoll at Metropolitan Temple last
nicht. Incidentally the speaker denounced
Catholicism and threw many bouquets at
himself.
The eeif-advertised orator did not seem
satisfied with his audience, which con
sisted of about thirty people, but he an
nounced thut he would lecture again, sub
ject "Hell." The date of this lecture was
said to be next Sunday night. Among
other things the speaker said:
"If the representatives of the press
here to-night roast me to-morrow morn
ing they will 'roast' by and by. They
can lay anything they want about me.
but let me tell them that if they deal
In personalities about my family I will
fight and die game. I have this advan
tage over uiem that the more they speak
about my ignorance the more people will
Christians Are Abject Puppies.
want to hear me, which will naturally
mean more encouragement in the box
office to me."
With t)iis> prelude the orator began
what he termed his "Defense of Inger
soll," which, consisted in brief of the fol
lowing:
"I don't think that Ingersoll should be
damned to hell in the people's minds for
not believing in Jesus Christ. I believe,
however, we are to discriminate between
I sincerity and hypocrisy. Some crooked
lieok^d humpbacked Christians bellevo they
\ are going to Heaven simply because they
i prostrate themselves at the altar of God
i and various graven images, while Bob,
like myself, is going to be damned be
cause he will not join in their mockery.
I think we have more chance of getting
through the needle's eye than 90 per cent
of the so-called followers of Chri.st. In
gersoll should not be condemned, but
praised. He has made Christians think;
and a man who does not think is not
â¢worth thinking about. Some people don't
think I think, but I think 1 do, although
I have no other proof to convince the
public than the logic of my arguments.
When you attain the heights of intellec
tuality and transcendent thought that I
have labored to attain you will find that
there is purpose in antagonism; and that
is why God allows me to live. Is there
any wonder that there is stagnation in
men's eouls? There is no hell lire or fu
ture torment that can prevent me from
talking the way I want to. The ministry
should uphold Individuality. I know that
I could please a great many people if
I chose to do so; I know that I could
be on top some day, be that day ten
years or ten days distant; 1 am ronvinced
that Davis will be on top and Davis is on
top now.
"Some people tell me why don't I get
a vindication. What good will that do
Edwards Davis Defends Ingersoll
me? A vindication won't buy me bread,
and even if It did I would prefer to go
hungry than accept it.
"I am nothing but 160 pounds of man,
with a brain. Have I sinned? I guess
yes! When I am asked this question,
however, 1 plead 'not guilty.' 1 have
sinned. It Is true; but I have never told
a lie in the pulpit, except a small one;
I have never told a theological lie.
"If I arose and preached the way people
wanted me," he continued, "J would be
the biggest 'bug' in the community. I
believe that Bob Ingersoll is a better
man than most of the men here to-night,
and 90 per cent of the Christians of the
world. Bob never abuses his wife, and
I wager that he gets along with her bet
ter than Christian men usually get along
with theirs."
After concluding the lecture with a per
sonal argument on his own worth, the
lecturer bowed himself off the etagn. lie
seemed greatly pleased with his effort.
Work of the Red Cross Society.
The Red Cross Society found very little
to do yesterday at Camp Merrltt, as
everything was moving along very

all the patients have been removed to

berth on the Oregon, Is perfectly satis
fied at being transferred to the monitor.
"We had an excellent trip," he said, "and
the boys aboard the Oregon think her
the only ship afloat. Of course she rolled
some, but altogether she behaved beau
tifully. We caught up with the Marietta
and Buffalo some distance out of Kio de
Janeiro and layed to by them for about
half an hour exchanging the news. When
we steamed away it didn't take us long
to leave them far in the rear. The Oregon
is a speedy vessel, and we made good time
all the way. The slowest we went was
ten knots an hour, and that was only for
a short time.
"At every port the vessel stopped some
of the crew were allowed to yo ashore,
and there were a number of brawls in
some of the South American ports. The
marines all noticed that there was con
siderable feeling against them on account
of the war, but this opinion was due
largely to their imagination, though there
was a slight foundation for it. Every
where any British people were encoun
tered we received the best of treatment.
We passed several English vessels and
were always greeted with cheers and
salutes by those on board.
"We had news of the doing's of the
Spanish fleets at every place we touched,
and were aware of the fact that it was
believed we might encounter some of the
enemy's vessels. We were rather confi
dent of our own powers, and dint care
a Davy Crockett if we met the entire
Spanish navy. About IGO miles out of Rio
a vessel wa^ sighted, and it was taken for
one of the Spanish fleet. The men were
all called to their stations and the guns
loaded preparatory to an engagement.
The vessel turned out to be a British
bark and there was a considerable feel
ing of disappointment among the men,
who seemed anxious to try issues with
the Spaniards."

Major Penny's Call Meets With
Many Hearty Responses
Major L. N. Penny's call for colored
volunteers to join with his colored com
pany in defense of the country has met
with favorable r> sponses from several
sources. He has heard from the office of
the adjutant-general of the State to the
effect that It will be impossible under
the present arrangements to accept any
entirely new company for the reason that
this State's quota will be supplied in full
when all companies now in the field shall
be fully enlisted.
Captain W. G. Copeland of Tulare
writes that he and thirty-live other col
ored men arc ready to join the movement.
Thumas T. Johnson, a colored man of
Pasadena writes that some of his friends
who have seen service as well as some
who have never been on the Held will be
glad to offer up their lives for the coun
try at the right time. All ti.ese colored
gentlemen are anxious to become part of
thci company which Major Penney pro
poses to advertise among his race in this
State.

fesses That He Did Not Tell

which was investigated last week.
The boy who admits he is a perjurer Is
15 years old. He says he wished to in
jure Day, believing the latter had talked
about his sister. Cassagrande says Beebe
the superintendent, prior to the investi
gation, made out a list of questions to
be asked concerning the management,
passed thorn aruund among the boys and
many boys volunteered to answer them
though they had not the slightest knowl
edge of what was meant.

THE GROCERS'
DAY TO SHINE
Their Big Picnic Held at
Schuetzen Park.
PATRIOTISM WAS RAMPANT
MANY PBIZES WON BY THE
CONTESTANTS.
California Commercial Travelers Out
in Foree â Dancing and Feasting
Were Major Features of
the Occasion.
Picnics nowadays seem to hava devel
oped Into occasions upon which ths ram
pant patriotism of the American public
generally can assert itself In no uncer
tain tones. The twenty-seventh anniver
sary picnic of the Retail Grocers' Pro
tective Union, held at California Schuet
zen Park yesterday, was a good instance
in point, for when the 2500 people that
attended marched off the boat at the foot
of Market street on their return, singing
the "Star-spangled Banner," "The Red,
White and Blue" and yelling "Remember
the Maine," "Hurrah for Free Cuba"
I and a number of other war slogans, it
I was enough to make sightseers think
there was an invasion of some sort ur
â  that another regiment of volunteers had
! arrived. Through it all the American
i Hag was carried on high by President J.
T. Hurley, surrounded by a host of the
"faithful," and the band "played on."
During the day the picnickers enjoyed
themselves at the park in many ways.
} There were games of all kinds for the
children, dancing in the big pavilion; tar
get shooting and bowling. Then there
, were a prize drawing for members, a
wheel of fortune at which many took a
"turn" and others a "fall" and a valuable
distribution of gate prizes.
At the noou hour a lunch was given in
the dining hall by the officials of the
organization. Speeches were made by
President Hurley, Vice-President Hartje,
Secretary Dolder and Treasurer Mahoiiv-
The members of the California Commer
cial Travelers' Association were largely
in evidence, from President Mershon to
"Poohbah" Louis Berger, the line includ
ing such notables as Con Grau, E. A.
James, "Samson" Roessler and Cupid
Myers.
Everybody that attended the picnic
went happy and returned in excellent
spirits as well.
Following was the result of the races:
Boys, race, 12 to 15 yearsâ James Mugan

MESSENGER BOY ROBBED.
Joseph Hubert the Victim of a Foot
pad in the Potrero.
Joseph Hubert, 848 Mission street, a
messenger boy in the employ of the Amer
ican Distriot Company, called at the Re
ceiving Hospital yesterday afternoon with
a blackened eye and his face swollen and
cut.
Hubert said that he went with a mes
sage to the Potrero, and while on his
way back he stopped at the corner of
Sixth and Kentucky streets to look at a
place that had been burned down. Just
then he was hit on the back of the head
and knocked down. Then he was kicked
in the face until he became unconscious.
When he came to his senses he found
that 85 cents, the money he had got for
the message, had been taken from his
pocket. He had no idea who the robber
was.
What hurt Hubert most was that the
company "docked" him the So cents.
Died From Her Injuries.
Mrs. Catherine Chessman, who was ac
cidentally scalded at her residence, 101
Wool street, on last Friday while lift
ing a boiler of hot water from the stove,
died at the City and County Hospital yes
terday at noon.
After the Coroner's office was notified of
her death her husband called on the offi
cials and said he was satisfied the death
of his wife was purely accidental and in
no manner was the owner of, the house
to blame, therefore he waived an in
quest. This viow was accepted, and the
body was turned over to an undertaker.

THEY WONT NO MORE PIE.
Five luckless gentlemen who were taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital
last night with various portions of their anatomy variously Injured, have made
a firm resolution that they will never again mix up in another man's troubles,
but will be content with their own. The gentlemen are now convinced that It
doesn't pay to jump in where they are liable to get their feet wet, and they
have no appetite for picnickers' pie.
A sailor, a trifle the worse for liquor, became engaged in a brawl with a man
at the corner of Stuart and Folsom streets last evening, and when a party of
fifteen picnickers, returning from a day's outing, passed the two scrappers, one of
them Insulted a member of the party and was promptly knocked flown. Tha
the friends of the picnicker then went at the man on the ground and adminis
tered to him sundry kicks and cuffs which bade well to make him a fit subject
for the Coroner.
It was at this point of the trouble that the outsiders got into the game before
buying chips. Mike Lane, a saloonkeeper in the vicinity, saw the fight, and
thinking the odds were against the sailor, came up and began to remonstrate
with the Irate picnickers. The peacemaker in this case was not blessed. The
picnickers brooked no interference, and proceeded to turn their attention to Lane.
As they were giving him the same treatment they had given Jack, F. W. Waston,
a jolly German in a yachting suit, happened along, and being a lover of fair
play, upbraided the picnickers for not fighting fair. One of them asked, In a very
aggressive tone: "Say, mister, is this any of your pie?" As the jolly German
did not answer, the picnicker, taking silence as equivalent to assent, began to
feed Waston his portion of the pastry, and from the looks of that gentleman's
face after the cyclone struck, the pie must have been of the cherry brand. Ed
Brass, Tom Kelly and John Thompson were three gentlemen who seemed to wish
a portion of the lunch the picnickers had with them, and they received what they
wanted. After the picnickers departed all five of their guests seemed to be taken
with indigestion, and inquiring the way to Dr. Hill's workshop they turned them
selves over to his tender mercy.
BECEIVE CONFIRMATION.
Over Two Hundred Children Kneel
to Receive the Sacrament From
the Archbishop.
The sacrament of confirmation was ad
ministered to over 2uO children at St.
Francis Church yesterday afternoon by
Archbishop Riordan, in the presence of
an immense audience.
Promptly at 4 o'clock the service began
with an eloquent address by Archbishop
Riordan, In which he outlined the ob
ject of the confirmation and the neces
sity of the sacrament as a means of sal
vation. He likened the period of youth,
when it is absolutely necessary for me
children to understand thoroughly the
object of the ceremony, to tho budding
time of spring.
"This is the period of life," said the
preacher, "when your character begin to
mold, and it is highly essential to your
future happiness that you mould begin
to sow the seeds of piety and ughteous
ness and endeavor to lead good Christian
lives."
Immediately after the sermon benedic
tion was solemnized by the Archbishop in
person, assisted by the clergy of St.
Francis Church.
The Camera Club.
There will a social "at home" to mem
bers of the California Camera Club and
their friends on Thursday evening, June
9. The entertainment will consist of a
slide exhibition interspersed with music,
vocal and instrumental. The slides are
from the camera clubs of Ottawa, St.
Catherines and Montreal, Canada, and
are well worthy of seeing. George Breck
will give a demonstrtion of the use of
acetylene gas in photography to-morrow.
A Vote of Thanks.
At a meeting of the general Memorial
Day committee, which had charge of the
last celebration, a resolution was passed
thanking all those who had contributed
to the success of the day or who had in
any way assisted in the celebration.

LAKE LINDERMAN.
Interesting Details Giving the Ex
isting Conditions There.
The following extracts from a letter re
ceived a few days since from J. Lembke,
under date of May 21, gives an idea of the
condition of affairs at Lake Llnderman.
Mr. Lembke writes: We are still In
camp at Linderman, I expect to be here
until the 10th of June or later. The ice
on the lake is still solid, and will not
commence to break in less than two or
three weeks. The weather has been very
nice for some time. Snow is pjetty well
gone. We will build afscow 26 et long
and 8 feet beam, and will cary a ton. The
scow was launched this afternoon. Wo
had a rather hard time getting over the
pass. Had we left San Francisco by the
Ist of February we should have done
much better. Everything coming over
the pass now is carried on the tramway
part way and packed the rest. Goods can
be gotten over for six cents from Dyea
to Linderman.
Their First Communion.
A class of fifty boys and girls took their
first communion at the French church on
Bush street yesterday morning, the sac
rament being administered by Father
Loude. Those 'communicants were pre
pared under the instruction of Father
Gulbart. At 4 o'clock the members of
the class received their baptismal vows.
The services both morning and afternoon
were of a most impressive and solemn
character and were witnessed with moro
than ordinary interest by the relatives
and friendd of the young people. The
confirmation will take place on June 2b.

NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN
The Standing of Those
Who Volunteered.
WHAT MUSTER ROLLS SHOW.
AN OFFICER DISPLEASED WITH
SECOND BRIGADE MEN.
The Fifth Infantry Regiment May
Know This Week if It Will Be
Included in the Second
Call.
There is but little activity in the Na
tional Guard of the State at this time,
for the reason that there is nothing defi
nite as yet as to the reorganization, ex
cept one thing, and that is that in the
future no one will be accepted as a mem
ber of the guard who is not qualified
from a physical standpoint.
The Attorney-General has under con
sideration a question which, when an
swered, will determine the standing of
the men who as National Guardsmen en
listed and became United States Volun
teers. Upon that decision will be based
the standing of the men who have al
ready gone to the front and of those who
are in Vailing to be sent there. Judge-
Advocate l>wyer of the division staff has
given an opinion that these men have
â  >cl their connection with the guard,
are no longer in the service of the State
and should be discharged therefrom. As
to commissioned officers the law is quite
plain. It i.s that no one can hold two
commissions.
li the Attorney-General should agree
with the Judge- Advocate of the division
Btafl then the First and Seventh Infan
try Regiments will have to be reorgan
ized anew and also the Fifth Infantry,
should it be sent out on the second call
lor troops.
FOR THE SECOND CALL.
It is expected that early this week there
will be received instructions mat will
give Joy to tne memoen of the several
companies of the i-itth Regiment of in
to or uuom them to disappointment.
They win know wnetfaer they mil be sent
to the iront or not. If the regiment is
to be accepted as a body ot the .National
Guard ot this State there will have to
be uu addition ot tour companies to bring
it uj> to its maximum Btrengtn. These
it is prop >?.â <! to taKe lrum the Second
Infantry. The second call demands that
a certain number or men (loiti) shall be
enlisted to mi up the companies previ
accepted, >â > as to bring them up
to the maximum of luJ rank and lile. But
as yet it has not been determined
whether they will be taken from the Na
tional Guard. \\ bile tiie guardsmen who
were left behind on the nrst cull would
willingly po as- guardsmen an. l as a body,
there is not a manifestation of great de
sire to be mustered in and distributed
where they could rill vacancies.
THE FIFTH INFANTRY.
Regimental orders issued June 1 from
headquarters of the Fifth Infantry show
ti.at since the issue of orders the pre
vious month there have been discharged
from the service of the State, ten men
from Company B for removal, two from
Company C for removal, and two at ex
piration of term of service, and four from
| my F for removal and four at ex
piration of term of service, twenty-two in
all.
The following appointments In the regi
ment are announced: Sergeant J. B.

C, vie- A. H. ("assidy promoted; Private
Ernest H. Nordman to be corporal of
Company H, Privates E. J. Marois and
Georgo L. Wildberger to be corporals of
the same company.
THE SIGNAL CORPS.
Upon the call for volunteers from the
rsatiqjial Guard for the signal corps, Lieu
tenant Colonel Miles, signal officer on the
division staff, . sent In lifty-eight names,
twenty-five from the corps of the First
Brigade, twenty-two from the Second and
eleven from the Third. The signal officer
is not pleased with the results obtained
from the Second Brigade corps, and has
not. taken any pains to conceal his dis
pleasure. When there was made public
the announcement that there would be a
call for volunteers, Captain Perkins, now
lieutenant in the volunteer signal corps
then commanding the corps of that bri

volunteer in case a demand was made for
signalmen. To this demand thirty-two of
the forty-five men signified a willingness
to go. When the call for such was made
there were but twenty-two names to send
In to the mustering otncer,. and when
there wasÂ»an appearance before the mus
tering officer there were but twelve who
were willing to undergo examination. Of
this number six were rejected principally
for defective eyesight, and the other six
were accepted and mustered into the ser
vice. The next day. however, one of
these was dropped from the list, and there
remain but five. These are P. C. Knapp,
William J. Stock, 11. F. Jurs Emmet

ODD fELLOW SOLDIERS.
Received by the Relief Committee of
the I. 0. O. F.
.The reception tendered to the Odd Fel
lows who arÂ« In the volunteer service of
the United States and stationed at Camp
Merritt by the general relief committee
of the Odd Fellows of San Francisco, as
sisted by the ladies of the Rebekahs in
Eureka Hall. I. O. O. F. building, yester
day forenoon, was one of the warmest of
fraternal greetings that has been noticed
in this city since the breaking out of the
, war.
The large hall, in which was prominent- I
ly displayed the emblem of our country '
was crowded to its capacity with mem
bers of the various lodges, a great num
ber of ladlr-s and more than 100 of the
boys in blue. Prrsi.lr-nt L. L. Remy pre
aided, and with dispatch disposed of the
work of charity which it is the province
of this body to dispense, after which j
James A. Wilson, the vice-president, in a
neat patriotic speech welcomed the sol
dier boys in the name of L,ove, Friendship
and Truth. Then followed a programme
which included an address by George T
Shaw, the grand secretary: Mrs Mary E
Donoho. secretary of the State Assembly
of the Rebokahs; Grand Treasurer Har- !
ris; "The Flag of Freedom." a recitation |
by Major Jeaghers of the Patriarchs
Militant, with "Boys. Remember the
Maine," an original composition, as an I
encore; a tenor solo by Dr. D. A. Hodg- i
head; the singing of Major Jeaghers' com
position. "Roys. Remember the Maine,"
by Joseph Greven, who composed the
xmiÃii; for it. The words are full of pa
triotic sentiment, the air is charming and
will no doubt become as popular as were
many of the war songs of the rebellion
days. An edition of this will be pub
lished this week and the proceeds donated
to the relief fund. Then followed remarks
by Mr. Chaplan of Charity Lodge of
â  Stockton. Mr. Wright of Memphis Lodge,
i Term., Lieutenant Morgareidge of Com
: pany G, "Wyoming Volunteers, Sergeant
O. W. Coarse? of Company G, South Da
kota Volunteers. Past Master J. H. Simp
son, Sergeant Andrews of the Twenty
third United States Infantry, who has
been in the service of Uncle Sam for
twenty-eight years, and E. C. Stock. The
soldiers who spoke were profuse in their
praise of the welcome of the brotherhood
in California, of the reception by the citi
zens at large and the ladies in particular.
Sergeant Cbursey said, in speaking of the
ladies of San Francisco: "I never until I
reached San Francisco knew what good
angels women are, although I am mar
ried." The programme, which had been
arranged by Louis Krapen, treasurer of
the relief committee, closed with the
playing of the "Star-Spangled Qanner" by
Private Treveny, one of the boys in blue,
and then the audience arose and joined
in the chorus. After giving three times
three for the glorious old flag, the ladies
I present each took one of the soldiers by
; an arm, and forming a procession, with
the flag carried at the head, marched to
the banquet room below, where a com
mittee of the Rebekahs had prepared a
collation for 300. Every seat was occu
pied, and the soldiers expressed them
selves in terms of warm praise for the
hospitable manner in which they had been
entertained.
| At the close of the meeting in the upper
I hall a soldier approached H. H. Dobbin,
I secretary of the finance committee, and
handed -"him a $10 bill with the remark,
"add that to the friendship fund." He re
fused to give his name, the letter of his
company or the name of his regiment.
To morrow evening the officers of Can
ton San Francisco No. 5 of the Patriarchs
Militant will be installed by Colonel H. O.
Brower, who will be assisted by Canton
No. 11 of Oakland. All the officers and
members of that branch of the order who
are with the volunteers have been In
vited to be present to witness the beauti
ful ceremony.

A SOLDIER ARRESTED.
Lawrence Reynolds of the South Da
kota Regiment Charged With
Attempt at Burglary.
Lawrence Reynolds, of Company D,
South Dakota regiment, was arrested
early yesterday morning and booked at
City Prison on a charge of attempt at
burglary.
Charles Hackmeier, of 1820 Ellis street,
rushed into the O'Farrell street station
about 3 o'clock yesterday morning and
said there were burglars In his house.
Policeman J. P. Herlihy was sent back
with Hackmeier, and they found Reynolds
on the roof of the adjoining house bare
footed and in his shirtsleeves. He was
considerably under t-he influence of liquor,
and as Hackmeier insisted that he was
the men who had been in his house, Her
lihy arrested him. An examination of
the house showed that nothing was miss
ing, so the charge of attempted burglary
was booked against Reynolds.
Reynolds said yesterday that he remem
bered nothing about the case. He had
been down town with some comrades hav
ing a good time, and he lost sight of them.
He had some more drinksi, and he re
membered nothing more until he awoke
iin the prison. He felt keenly the positiop
I he had been placed in. and vehemently
I denied that he was a burglar. He had
been working on a ranch at Sioux Falls,
S. D., when the call for volunteers came
and he enlisted.
Drank Carbolic Acid.
Joseph Simpson, a laborer, was discov
ered at the corner of Stanton and Fred
erick streets Yesterday morning about
7 o'clock in terrible agony. Sergeant
Thompson of the park police was notified
and immediately sent him to the Park
Receiving Hospital. Simpson said he
Mad taken carbolic acid. At 12 o'clock he
had so far recovered that he was moved
to the City and County Hospital. He said
he was despondent from drink. He died
at 6 o'clock last evening.

THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUKE 6, 1898.
PIGEON SHOOT
CONCLUDED
Clarence Nauman Won
the Fay Medal.
HE KILLED TWENTY BIRDS.
VICTORY EARNED BY LUCK
AND CLEVER SHOOTING.
Merrill of Stockton Had an Off Day.
Maskey and Fox Give an Ex
hibition of Fine Marks
manship.
Clarence Nauman carried away the Fay
diamond medal in the concluding match
of the Olympic Gun Club's three-day live
bird shoot at Ingleside yesterday by kill
ing twenty straight. Good shooting and
pure luck gave him a victory. On two
occasions his birds dropped Just within
bounds, whereas with other contestants
many pigeons would struggle over the
line.
In the opinion of many Maskey and
Fox did the better shooting. Nineteen
birds fell before their deadly aim, and
they had very little occasion to use their
second barrel.
An ideal day and a fast batch of
pigeons made things extremely Interest
ing for the contestants. Pete McCray
sprinted for a bird that was hopping
near the deadly lm* and just as he was
about to snatch it the wary pigeon tlew
away, much to his dlscomiiture. Haight
wounded a bird with his second barrel
and it arose in the air and, describing a
half circle, Hew into the hands of its
executioner.
Owing to the fast birds and the numer
ous misses the twenty-two contestants*
dwindled down in short order. Instead of
four hours being devoted to the match,
but two and a half were consumed.
Following were the high scores: Clar
ence Nauman, 20; Maskey. 19; Fox, 19;
F. Feudner, 15; Burnett, 14; Otto Feud
ner, 13; Smith. 9; Merrill, 8; Haight, 8.
Maskey and Fox divided $25 between them
for next high guns.
One hundred and fifty-five dollars was
divided among Nauman, Merrill. Haight,
Webb and Burnett, each having scored
ten straight In the Dupont Smokeless
Powder race.
In the Roos Brothers' race, Nauman,
Merrill. Haight, Webb, Burnett, Leigh
ton and F. Feudner divided the pool of
$155, each scoring ten straight birds. Hei
delberg and Rice scored nine, their odd
birds having flown out of bounds.
In a private match Feudner and Mer
rill divided $17 50 botwoen them, each
hiving killed four straight. Haight also
landed a purse of $17 50 by defeating
Fn:dner, Rice, Merrill, Fox, Pickett and
Stelling.
W. Robertson acted as referee.
AT SHELL MOUND.
The Deutscher Krieger Verein Marks-
men Shoot for Prizes.
While the attendance at the Shell Mound
rifle range yesterday was not very large,
those who were there had a pleasant time,
especially the members of the Deutscher
Krieger Verein's shooting section. The
attendance of the members of this body
was because, aside from the attractions
of the regular monthly contests for med
als, there were special prizes in Bight.
When the last big shooting festival of
this body was held there were a number
of merchandise prizes more than the
events required, and these were shot for

IN YAZOO CITY, MISSISSIPPI^
" I had been troubled with dyspepsia for over fifteen
years and the last five years suffered intensely. I had 1
tried quite a number of remedies, and though at times
they relieved my suffering they never cured me. About
four months ago I noticed the advertisement of Ripans
Tabules and bought some, and by using them as directed
they benefited me more than I expected. Soon I found : â 
that all signs of the disease had disappeared and that I V
was gaining =in weight right along, â â  and to-day I can say
that I am thoroughly cured. I have gained in weight
seventeen pounds, increasing from 128 to 145 pounds."

THE ITALIANS CELEBRATE.
Fiftieth Anniversary of Their Secur
ing Constitutional Rights.
Nearly all of the Italian colony was at
the picnic held yesterday at Shell Mound
Park, the occasion being the celebration
of the fiftieth anniversary of the conces
sion of the constitution to the Italian
free States. The outing was held under
the auspices of the Italian benevolent so

parade, headed by the guard, in which
about fifteen societies participated. The
parade was along Broadway, Dupont and

Stockton, Pine, Montgomery and Market
streets to the ferries. In the carriages
wire Italian Consul-General F. Serra, F.
Calegaris, A. D. Splvalo and the presi
dent of the day, F. Cavagnaro. While the
early boats were well filled with the peo
ple from sunny Italy the later boats were
crowded. When the picnickers arrived
at the park they scattered out in all di
rections and spread their lunehts under
the trees. No time was lost alter get
ling things in shape in rushing to the
dance pavilion, where the majority en
joyed themselves until the shadows of
evening gave warning that it was time
for them to go home. In every particu
lar the affair was a success. In the even
ing the dancing was resumed in the hall
of the guard at 423 Broadway. The ex
cursion and ball was under the manage

All Republicans Are
Not Seeking Office.
PRINCIPLES AT STAKE
THE PARTY NOT ANXIOUS FOR
A REPETITION OF '94.
A Few Who Would Seek Self-Glory
at Any Price Need to Be Sub
jected to Discipl
ine.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 5.
It Is now in order for the Republican
party of Alameda County to make itself
heard. There are about two months yet
to elapse before the delegates will be
elected to a State convention, and in the
meantime Alameda Republicans should
make up their minds regarding what they
want and the most practical way to ob
tain it. There are some who would fain
believe that the party has already done
considerable campaigning. This is a de
lusion. The party that gave the boasted
majority for McKinley and saved this
State to the Republicans is not composed
of about 100 office-seekers whose inter
est in politics is purely personal. It re
quired nearly 13,000 Republican votes to
give McKinley that 5000 majority, and of
this great number not more than a cou
ple of hundred have moved a finger.
Every effort has been made to create an
impression in the rest of the State that
this county is lying awake o' nights plan
ning how to make Jones a Governor or
Robinson a Constable.
This is not true. Candidates for office
in nearly every ward have aroused some
Interest, and their friends have come for
ward to some extent, but the meeting last
Friday night was evidence that the great
body of Republicans are not yet ready to
express their preference. No band will bo
required to fill a moderate sized hall when
the Republican campaign is really on.
When George Knight, or General Barnes
or Mr. Schoonmaker ascended the plat
form at the Tabernacle two years ago
the immense building was packed. Why?
Because the Republican party in Alameda
County \Vas aroused and at work. The
great benefits that were considered to be
necessary then are a hundred fold more
necessary now.
What effect will it have upon the na
history twenty years hence, wheth
er I>r. Pardee or Mr. Davis or neither of
them be Governor of California when the
century closes? It is right to take pride
live political warfare, but the prin
ciples of the great party are of infinitely
more importance thai* the ambitions of
individuals. Yet it would seem that the
zt'iilousness of a few who have much,
politically, at stake, has almost reached
the danger line, and office-seeking is sup
planting party-building.
An intelligent review of the situation
seems to indicate that Alameda County
began her fight for obtaining the Gov
ernorship from xhf wrong end. Instead
of the twelve thousand Republicans be
ing consulted as to who should represent
them candidates were placed before the
twelve thousand Republicans, and so far
lioice has been made. I have no
hesitation in saying that either of the
two men would make a good Governor.
The fault of the present deadlock is due
in the fact that the party did not name
either man, and before It was aware oi
had been done two standards were
I and it has been war to the knilo
ever ill
To state that Alameda County has yet
shown any positive preference is as un
true a.Â« it is absurd. This county is hard
to Judp-. A few years ago there was a
very lively primary for the delegates to
nominate a Congressman. Judge Frlck
and Congressman Hilborn were the op
g parties. Frick's forces were well
organized. He had a. majority of the
County Central Committee with him and
on the eve of the primary it wag thought
lie had the fight won. Everybody knows
liiav it resulted. Frick got a compli
mentary vote in the convention and Hil
borr. went to Congress. The same un
certainty prevails to-day.
One of the most significant features in
the major contest In this county is the
part being taken by those politicians who
do business at the county buildings. They
are all at work and are desperately in
earnest. Whether they are helping the
iiiran cause it is too early to pre
dict. Four years ago many of this same
element attempted to put through a pro-i
gramme. The party refused to accept
ft and the Republican candidates for
County Assessor, Sheriff and Treasurer
were beaten at the polls. Should the
rulo-or-ruin policy of the few, which has
already been inaugurated, not be rebuked
at the primaries, Alameda's county gov
ernment, in spite of her Republican ma
jority, may be entirely lost to the party
It is no secret that the men who were
responsible for the Republican defeat of
1894 were subject to the political powers
of the corporations in this county, it
Is no secret that these same agisnr-i,-. s
are again at work, and that their influ

cut but a very small figure In the twelve
thousand Republicans of the entire
county, and it is very likely that when
the issues are understood there may be
some surprises at the primaries.
Oakland has passed through another ex
perience with a Grand Jury, and it Is so
similar to that of past years as to be
tedious. Assuredly, one good result has
been attained. The people have been 'edu
cated up to the point of being suspicious,
and that is worth something. Although
Harry Thomas is acquitted, it would have
been more satisfactory to the people if
the case had been tried on Its merits, for
then much that has been told in rumors
and whispers would have to be sworn
to or contradicted by silence. But the
desire of the public cuts no figure in law,
and the incident is closed.
A newspaper published in the Interior
of the county must have blushed last
week, when it humbly whispered that one
of the county nominations on the Repub
lican ticket should go into the county.
Of course it should, and if the township
delegations go about it properly they can
have more than one. It has long been
noticeable that the press of the interior
towns is altogether too reticent regarding
politics. It has proved that it can raise
a big cash bonus for a cannery at^ San
Leandro; can induce a Y. M. I. State
gathering to go to Haywards. and can
achieve similar feats, yet it takes a de
light in ignoring the political Interests of
the respective districts. The interior
deserves its share of the ticket, and can
get it by demanding and working for It.

TRAGIC DEATH OF AN
OAKLAND HUNTER
J. L. LEGATXLT KILLED BY HIS
OWN GUN.
It Was Evidently Discharged as He \
Dragged it Through a Fence.
Another Tragedy.
OAKLAND, June s.â While dragging a
gun through a fence, J. L. Legault was
killed this afternoon In Contra Costa
County. The accident was one of the
most frightful of gun accidents, and both
barrels were discharged close to the un
j fortunate man's head, blowing it to pieces.
| J. L. Legault was a brother of Dr. J. \V.
Legault, one of the best known physicians
of this city. He kept a grocery store on
Adeline street, in North Oakland, and has
been in business there for many years.
The body of J. L. Legault was discov
ered by George F. Neece and M. A. Whid
den this afternoon about a mile and a
half this Bide of Lafayette. The entire
face was torn away, and the brains lay
scattered all over the surroundings, while
twenty feet away was found a large piece
of the skull.
Neece and Whidden were returning from i
Mt. Diablo. They were driving along the
road when they noticed a gun and a man's
hat lying alongside the fence in the road.
When they drew nearer the body was
seen on the inside of the fence. Mr. Whid
den investigated and found that it was
Legault. with whom he was well ac
quainted.
"I never saw such a sight," said Whid
den to-night on his arrival at home. "The
head was split wide open and lay face
down on the back of his hands. The
ground was spattered with brains, while
there was blood everywhere. The gun i
was covered with blood, and lay parallel
with the fence. Poor Joe, he must have
attempted to pull the gun through the
fence, when it exploded. The body lay on
Jihe property of a Mrs. Carroll, whom we
notified without touching it. I dropped a
sack over his head to keep the flies off
She sent a son to Lafayette to telephone
to the Coroner at Martinez."
Mr. Legault was but recently acquitted
on a charge of arson. A year ago his
store, at the corner of Thirty-fourth and
Adeline streets, was discovered on fire
The police claimed to have seen him in
the store by the glare of the light, and
when they went around to the back part
Of the place to awaken him they found
Legault in bed partly dressed with his
Fhoes on. The fire was extinguished, but
Legault was arrested and had to stand
trial. The jury acquitted him.
Legault left home this morning at 7
o'clock and called at his brother's house
to ask his brother to water his horse at
noon He said he was going hunting for
the day. !No one suspects him of com
mitting suicide, as there was no known
reason for such an act.
"There is no doubt the affair was purely
accidental," said Dr. Legault to-night
"My brother went out this morning with
a party to hunt In the hills near Lafayette
and ho was probably following something
when the nccfdent occurred. He was evi
dently dragging his gun through the
fence alongside of which he was found
and it exploded. He was alone at the
time. The affair must have been acci
dental, for there cannot possibly be any
other solution of the mystery."
J. L. Legault was a single man. about
2T. years of age. He has live.d in this city
many years and has always been con
sidered a successful business man. The
remains were taken in charge by the
Coroner of Contra Costa County.
Another case of death by a gunshot
wound was discovered to-night Just be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 6, 18f8.
fore dark In Diamond Creek, about a mile
and a half above Diamond. The body
had evidently laid out for nearly two
weeks and was so badly decomposed that
it was handled with difficulty. The face
was gone all but the teeth. There is not
the least thing about the person or
clothing by which to identify it. There
was a black diagonal cutaway coat, light
blue vest and trousers and a new pair of
gaiter shoes. Deputy Coroner Henry
Quellin, who brought the remains in, be
lieves from the surroundings that the
body had rolled down a steep embank
ment and been stopped by a tree. Near
it lay a double-barreled shotgun. One
barrel had been fired, while the other bar
rel was cocked. The gun was a 12-bore
and badly rusted, and nothing on it to
indicate the owner.
CAME HOME TO DIE.
Charles Purcell, Foreman of the
Crockett Sugar Beflnery, Strick
en "With Apoplexy.
OAKLAND, June s.â The family of
Charles Purcell, who had looked forward
all week to his presence with them to
day, were greatly shocked at his sudden
death at 7:30 o'clock this morning from
a stroke of apoplexy. The deceased had
arisen and was walking across the room
to get a drink when he was stricken down
and died before assistance reached him.
Mr. Purcell was employed as foreman at
the Crockett sugar refinery, and came
home last evening to spend the day with
his family, expecting to return to-day.
He had been feeling as well as usual, and
his death comes as a great shock to the
family.
Deceased was a native of Ireland, 65
years and 6 months of age, and had re
sided in this State twenty-five years, the
greater part of the time right In this city.
Besides the widow, Margaret E. Purcell,
he leaves a large family, consisting of
seven daughters and three sons. One of
the boys recently enlisted and Is In the
Montana regiment at Camp Merrltt, ready
to leave for Manila this week.
The children are Mrs. A. I. McCourt
ney, Mrs. Fred Lillenthal and the Misses
Florence, Ruth, Gussle, Fannie and
Maggie and William John and Robert.
The funeral will be held Tuesday after
noon.
WORKED ALL SUNDAY.
Increased Interest and Activity in
Sending Supplies to the Soldiers.
BERKELEY, June 6.â From early
morning until late this evening the ladies
: of the Berkeley branch of the Red Cross
: Society stayed at their headquarters in
the Hinkel block, plying their needles and
tying up bandages. The long tables with
which the room is furnished were crowded
all day with women getting ready the
1 things which are to be sent to San Fran
, cisco for the soldiers. People stayed away
i from the churches, both morning and
evening, in order that the work might be
carried on. A large packing-box filled
with 600 abdominal bandages stands in
â¢ the room ready to be shipped to-morrow
i morning. Fifteen bundles of books and
! magazines, together with several hun
dred sterilized finger bandages, will be
i ready to go with it.
The name of the chairman of the re
: lief committee, which was mentioned in
: yesterday's Call, was announced to-day.
Miss Edith Brockway of Bushnell place
; has consented to undertake the task of
finding relief for families left destitute by
soldiers who have gone to the front. The.
other members of the committee will be
appointed later by the chairman.
Several of the Red Cross ladies have
been taking subscriptions for the hospital
' ship which is to be given to the Govern
ment by the Red Cross workers of the
coast. Up to this evening they have suc
ceeded in collecting $600 for this purpose.
Contributions are received at head
quarters. A list of donations, together
with the names of donors, is being made,
which will be published to-morrow.
The school children are showing a very
active Interest in collecting books and
money. A committee from the senior
class just graduated from the Berkeley
High School sent a letter to-day to Mrs.
C. R. Greenleaf, president of the Red
Cross work in Berkeley, offering to re
peat "Esmeralda" for the benefit of the
society'B funds. The offer was accepted.
'â  "Esmeralda," a play written by Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett, was performed

GREAT COURSING
AT UNION PARK
Favorites Lose Heavily
In the First Round.
CRACK DOGS WELL MATCHED.
HOUNDS BAN WELL TO THE DE
LIGHT OF THOUSANDS.
The Talent Had the Best of the Day
After the First Sweeping
Victories of the
Shorts.
Thousands attended the coursing at
Union Coursing Park yesterday. The bet
ting was lively from the start owing to
the fact that a number of crack dogs,
evenly matched, had been entered. The
day was perfect and the excitement
throughout intense.
In the first round yesterday, which was
the second of the course, the talent met
with severe disappointment, but after that
the favorites won. During the first round
the short end followers had a holiday,
and many a walkover. In the first two
courses three to one shots won. Miller's
Maid beat Sylvanus, and Benicia Boy
beat Move On. The talent also had a
little upset when Johnny R beat Tod
Sloan, the winner showing great speed
and good work. Again the stake favorite,
Theron, was defeated by a Sacramento
dog, Mercury, at odds of 6 to 2. Theron
was unfortunate in the first course, as
Mercury was unsighted. As Theron had
tired himself it was called "no course."
Laurelwood also beat Royal Buck at 6
to 2.
The final round was one of thÂ« most
exciting of the day, as Rusty Gold and
Laurelwood tied. In the next run Rusty
Gold was an easy winner. The following
is the score of the day:

EXPLANATION.
Th arrow files with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath It, if any, the
amount of rainfall or ot melted snow In inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather nicy be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

YELLOW BOYS
LOSE AGAIN
The Blue Ribbons Are
Warm Members.
PITCHER SHEA IN GREAT FORM
UMPIRE LEVY'S DECISIONS A
TRIFLE TO THE BAD.
It Was a Great Game, the Blue Rib
bon Boys Surprising Every
body by Their Superb
Work.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Sure enoxigh the "blue ribbons" outdid
themselves in yesterday** game. They
not only defeated those "yellow ham
mers," but they unmercifully rubbed it
in. My! how they <liv play. Not a
"chest" was visible, not a play that you
could conscientiously criticize, pave in one
instance, but as this was the only "idio
tic" mistake it would be well to let it
pass, at least for the present.
A big crowd was in attendance, It was
one of those reiined, good-natured gath
erings that are ever willing to cheer fine
plays, and that appreciate good base
ball. Only in a few instances did they
have occasion to show their displeasure,
and it was always directed at Mr. "Ru
ben" Levy, the autocrat of the field. This
gentleman gave some miserable decisions
on balls and strikes, and while the hon
ors in this respect were about evenly
divided as regards the teams, still they
brought no good, and the game would
have been much better without them.
The players, however, always overdo
such a thing as was evidenced in the case
of Early. He was kicking on strikes
that were dead over the plate, and for
such work should have been put out of
the game. It Is very "cheap" of a player
to make things unpleasant for an umpire,
â when there is really no cause for it, and
while Levy, in some instances, gave about
as poor an exhibition of umpiring as one
would care to see, he, however, was not
to blame in all cases, particularly in that
of Early.
Rube is not aggressive enough, and be
sides he should stand pat on what he says,
"iesterday he called a man out on strikes.
The third strike was a very bad one, and
the "yellow hammers" registered quite a
kick against tne decision. Knell, who
played right field, and by the way played
It beautifully, made quite a demonstra
tion, as was expected, and for his pains
was ordered out of the game. To the sur
prise of every one, wht-n the inning was
over. Knell was still back in his position.
Levy should then and there have ik-clared
himself, by compelling Knell to retire, but
instead, he allowed him to finish the
game. This was a serious mistake on
Rube's part, for players will always think
him bluttting. Sick to your word, Rube,
no matter whom it aitects.
The game opened up by the "blue rib
bons" making three runs in the first in
ning. It looked for all the world as if
it was to be a repetition of all former '
games played at Recreation Park, but the
outcome- was most gratifying, and 1 may
add, surprising. After the first inning
nothing of note occurred until the ninth,
as both clubs were putting up excellent
ball, and playing the game for all it was
worth. Shea, tne new pitcher of the
Fri'jcos, kept his hits well scattered until
the last inning, when four hits and three
runs were made off him, but up to this
stage he was invincible. Pitcher Thomas,
however, was unfortunate, as the hits off
him came at opportune times, as did a
couple of the errors, and runs enough to
win the game were stacked up.
Fresno, however, was in reality out
played. They made as many hits as did
their opponents, and only one error more,
but when hits were necessary they were
as invisible as the "Spanish armada."
The "blue ribbons" hit opportunely, and
played t^e game as it should be played.
There was no indifferent spirit visible, i
and the game they played in the field was I
superb, made so by the fielding possibili
ties which occurred in each inning, all of
which were accepted save four, and a
couple of these were excusable.
That glorious uncertainty of the game
loomed forth conspicuously in the last
inning, when Fresno made that rally.
The score is as follows:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 6, 1893.
MADRID WOULD
END THE WAR
Spain Anxious to Make
Peace.
POWERS NOW HOLD ALOOF.
NONE WILLING TO ACT AS
INTERMEDIARIES.
Fear Tnat Their Action Might Arouse
Resentment on the Part
of the American
People.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June v.
The belief is growing in the best in
formed Government circles that Spain
is sincerely anxious to make peace, and
that even now she is seeking a favor
able opportunity to make overtures in
that direction. Numerous evidences of
this have come to the attention of the
authorities here, but up to this time no
actual move has been made toward as
certaining on what basis the United
States would consider peace. It is said
the first step would be toward having
some disinterested power make inquiry
of this Government as to what terms
would be accepted, after which, the
terms being stated, it would be for
Spain to form a commission, and make
a formal tender of peace.
The authorities here feel that Spain
is feeling her way toward a movement
of this kind. One evidence of it is the
utterance of the Spanish Ambassador
at London urging that a peace move
ment is opportune at this time. It is
thought to be highly improbable that a
Spanish official of his rank would make
a statement of this kind unless it
voiced the view entertained by the au
thorities at Madrid.
Another evidence is the sending of
Senor Castillo to Paris, his principal
mission being to enlist sympathy there
and to encourage a movement toward
obtaining peace on a basis honorable
to Spain. With this comes the report
of the serious embarrassment of the
Bank of Spain, on which the Govern
ment relies for funds to carry on the
war. The desperate condition of the
Spanish forces at Manila, Santiago and
Havana are looked upon as added rea
sons why Spain should be solicitious
at this time for peace.
But while Spain is thought to be j
anxious to obtain peace, she appears to
be unable to secure the services of a
disinterested power to take the initia
tive in a peace movement. This was ;
the view expressed to-day by a leading i
member of the diplomatic corps. He ;
said much surprise had been caused at j
foreign capitals by the resentment in
the United States against the kindly j
representations of the great powers,
made to Presid >nt McKinley some
weeks ago, which had been treated by
the American press and by publ . ~ opin
ion throughout this country as an in
trusion on the part of the great powers.
For that reason the efforts since made
by Spain to induce the European pow
ers to interve. had met with flat fail
ure, because none of the powers wlyh
to arouse the enmity of the United
States. For the same reason, this dipJo
matic official pointed out, the ]uropean
powers were loth to befriend Spain at
the present time, even to the extent of
making inquiry as to what basis of
peace would be acceptable to the I'nited
States. No one power would undertake
such inquiries, he said, as it would sub
ject that power to the possibility of be
ing snubbed. He thought such a snub
quite likely in view of the manner in
which the kindly representation of the
powers had been received some weeks
ago.
And. while do power was willing to
act alone," neither could the powers be
brought together for united action
along that line. For this reason, it is
pointed out, Spain's isolation at the
present time made it extremely difficult
for her to see any intermediary by
which she could conduct Initial steps
toward securing peace.

OTIS IS TO SAIL THIS WEEK
SECOND PHILIPPINE EXPEDITION
It is now asserted by officers high in the service that Major
General Otis will go in command of the second expedition to
the Philippines, and that Brigadier General Miller will assume
command of the troops remaining at Camp Merritt..
Nothing definite is known as to when the second expedition
will sail, but the general impression is that it will not get
away before next Sunday.
Three ships, the Zealandia, China and Colon, will comprise
the fleet, according to present arrangements, and the work of
loading stores will begin this morning. Detachments were
sent aboard the three ships last night from the Eighteenth
and Twenty-third United States and the First Colorado and
Tenth Pennsylvania.
The second expedition to the
Philippines will not sail before the
last of the week, and according to
present plans will comprise the
troopships Zealandia, China and
Colon, though more ships may
be assigned later. Major General
â¢ Otis will go out in command.
Battery C of the California
heavy artillery departed for Fort
Canby last evening. It will travel
by rail to Portland.
The band of the Fourth
United States Cavalry arrived
from Walla Walla yesterday
and went into quarters at the
Presidio. Troop lof the same
regiment will arrive to-day, and
two more troops will arrive later
in the week.
The battalion of the Third
'United States Artillery, under
command of Major Hess, will go
into camp on the Presidio drill
plain to-day.
The next volunteers to arrive
will be the lowa regiment, which
is due here Wednesday. It will go
into camp near the Montana and
Dakota troops, north of Point
Lobos avenue.
Sunday was duly observed at
Camp Merritt by religious serv
ices in most of the camps during
the forenoon, and the suspension
of all but guard duty. The men
were given several hours' liberty,
and during the afternoon the
camp looked deserted.
AT CAMP MERRITT.
Still Speculating on the Date
of Departure of the Second
Philippine Expedition.
Despite the order issued from division
headquarters by General Otis to the
various commands comprising the second
expedition to Manila to be ready to sail
by to-morrow, it is apparent from all that
can be learned that no troops will leave
San Francisco before the last of this
week, if then. The ships that will carry
the soldiers have been determined upon.
They are the Zealandla, China and Colon.
The Tenth Pennsylvania and one-half of
Battery H wiil go on the first-named ves
sel, the two battalions from the Twenty
third and Eighteenth Infantry on the
Colon and the First Colorado and Utah
IJght Battery on the China.
The latest news in Camp Merritt was
given out yesterday afternoon, and from
reliable authority it is learned that Gen
eral Otis will be In charge of the second
expedition, and that he and his staff will
sail on the China. Sunday seems to be
the generally accepted date set for the
departure of the troops. It is reliably
reported that Brigadier-General Marcus
P. Miller will assume charge of Camp
Merritt when General Otis leaves.
General Milier established his head
quarters at Camp Merritt yesterday and
ti">k command <>i thÂ« i-irsi Brigade, re
lieving Colonel OvMshine., who nas been
in temporary command. General Miller's
Btafl consists of Captain Putnam Bra-dlee
Strong, assistant adjutant-general, .Lieu
tenant Charles G. woodward and .Lieu
tenant Morns K. Barrail, both of the
Third Artillery, aids.
Lieutenant Franklin of the Twenty
third lnlantry has been appointed com
missary lor the troopship Coion and Lieu
tenant Grote of the Eighteenth for tho
China.
Yesterday was an exceedingly quiet day
In camp and only a few routine orders
â were issued from headquarters. Com
paratively few people were out to see I
the soldiers, and these had to limit their
attentions to the volunteer organizations,
as no visitors were allowed in the camp
of the regulars.
Private Willis Jackson, Company L,
Eighteenth Infantry, died at 9 o'clock
yesterday morning of appendicitis. He
was given a military funeral at 4 o'clock,
the . uuy being buried in the National
Cemetery at the Presidio. The two bat
talions of the iiighteenin, with the band '
pluying a dirge, escorted the body ]
through camp. Tho usual ceremonies ]
were observed at tho grave. The firing !
squad paid homage to the dead soldier !
and the bugler sounded taps. Jackson
had been in the service for two years.
In addition to the Thirteenth Minnesota
the two battalions of the Idaho troop;-
â will be inspected by Colonel Hughes and
Captain Mallory some time this after-
noon.
The First Nebraska was inspected in ,
heavy marching order yesterday morn- I
Ing.
By order of Postmaster Montague a j
branch poÂ«toffice for the benefit of Camp !
Merritt will be opened to-day at the cor- I
ncr of Fourth avenue and C street.
Colonel Jones, of the Idaho troops, yes- j
terday furnished his band of twenty-two i
men with the instruments that were pur
chased with the appropriation made by
th<- State for that purpose.
With the exception of the regulars, the j
Idaho battalion and Twentieth Kansas, j
services were held in all the commands
at Camp Merritt yesterday. The Cath
olic Truth Society's large tent was crowd
ed at all three services. At 7:30 o'clock
many soldiers from the various regiments i
attended low mass. It was read by i
Father O'Ryan, and communion was also i
administered. At 11 o'clock Father Yorke !
preached upon "The Value of Souls." The
tent was crowded and a masterly dis
course was delivered by Yorke. His line
of thought, developed on the valuation of
human souls, was tii.it Christ died for
men. and that every soul must be meas
ured by our Savior's love. He told the
soldiers that they were going to war,
where men's bodies were to be used for
the single purpose of stopping bullets,
but he declared that the soul could never
perish, and that it was the duty of every
man to be ready when the summons came
to redeem their souls.
In the Seventh California, Chaplain
Clarke preached from the text, Second
Peter, ill, 18, "Grow in Grace."
His line of thought was based upon the
law of beginnings, and the ordinary law
of growth and development. Christian
ity, he said, was no exception, to the rule.
He appealed to the men not to dwarf and
deform their moral manhood while they
are in the army, .and always to do their
duty with a spirit of Christian love
toward all men.
In the Thirteenth Minnesota, First Colo
rado, First Nebraska and Twentieth Kan
sas, services were also held by the dif
ferent chaplains.
Drill was suspended in all the com
mands, and the men were given their
freedom until 6 o'clock. Tlie park and
ocean beach attracted thousands during
the afternoon.

sented by George C. Hunt of Oakland,
| a brother-in-law of Governor W. A. Rlch
j ards of Wyoming, to Major Foote in the
! name of the Governor and the ladies of

find itself the flag would be honored and
I preserved. Major Foote delivered a very
appropriate address, and placed the flag
i in the hands of the color sergeant.
First Sergeant Burritt of Company C,
I replied in the name of the enlisted men
and officers. His oration was brief and
brilliant, and elicited many cheers for

ladies of Wyoming.
The money for the purchase of the flag

scriptions from the Wyoming ladles, not
one of whom was permitted to give more
