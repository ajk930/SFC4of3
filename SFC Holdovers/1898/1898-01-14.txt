INDEPENDENCE OF CUBA
AND AMERICAN CONTROL.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â Private information has been sent to the
State Department and to the members of the Foreign Affairs Commit
tee in Congress going to show that powerful influences are at work to
secure Independence for Cuba. Spain has issued bonds to the gross
amount of about 1400,000.000, based specifically upon the resources and
revenues of Cuba. These bonds are held in large part in Great Britain
and France.
Some of the largest syndicates in these countries, it is said, have
become convinced that these bonds are about to become valueless un-
Ippp the United States in some way guarantees their payment. They
that the island is entirely devastated, and that it can be
restored only by the Influence of a srong commercial power.
Representations have already been made to this country by certain
stronsr <:â¢,-, mmeroial Interests to secure active intervention. If this were
done, the United States would become morally responsible for the pay
ment of the Cuban loan. This could be done by a protectorate similar
to that of England in Egypt or by direct control of the Cuban cus
tom houses.
NEW YORK. Jan. 13.â The Herald's '
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Rumors are in circulation late to-night
about fresh riots having broken out in
Havana. They could not be coflfirrned.
Despite the alarms "Washington offi- |
cials maintained a dignified coolness to- :
r1 :\ i.ver the Cuban situation. It can j
be stated authoritatively that the Ha- :
vana riots of yesterdny, which were
promptly subdued, have not changed .
the attitude of the administration in
regard to relations with Spain, or its
general policy on the Cuban question.
It can he stated with equal positive
ness that the President is by no means
panguine that Spain will ever be able
to restore peace in the island through
the medium of autonomy. President
McKinley sees from the official reports
from Cuba and Spain that autonomy
has not yet made much headway. He
does not believe, however, that there is
anything in the existing situation that
justifies any further action by the
Fnited States at the present time. His
policy is clearly defined. He will meet
contingencies as they arise with the
most pacific means at hand, and always
be prepared for any emergency.
HAVANA, Jan. 1?,. â About noon to
day a crowd gathf-red in front of the
offices of El Diario de la Marina shout
ing: "Df-ath to El Diario!" General
Aroulas sent the regular troops to re
store order and to compel the dispersaJ
of thÂ» crowd which kept up a continu
ous shouting on the streets near Cen
tral Park.
These people accuse El Diario de la
Marina of being responsible for the at
tacks made upon army officers and
Spanish residents in the island. They
say that La Discusion and El Re
concentrado received their cue from El
Diario. A man selling El Diario was
shot in the arm.
CONSUL-GENERAL LEE
ALLAYS THE FEARS OF
TROUBLE AT HAVANA.
But Orders Stand for the Maine to Be Ready
to Proceed to the Cuban Capital at
an Instant's Notice.
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Consul -General Lee cabled
to the State Department late this even
ing that In view of the more pacific
condition of affairs In Havana there Is
no n't' 6of an American warship there.
While gratified at this information
there is no intention to abate vigilance
In the matter of providing Americana
and thfir Interests in Cuba with pro
tectlon should they be endangered by
further riots. The intention is to per
mit the orders given to the Maine late
yesterday afternoon to be in readiness
to proceed to Havana at an instant's
notice, to stand. She is at the disposal
of Consul-General Lee, and the moment
he considers th.it the interests of this
Government require the presence of a
man-of-war he Is empowered to cable
Captain C. D. Sigsbee, h^r commander,
to come. Of course, it is recognized by
the President that the necessity which
will call the Maine to Havana must be
urgent. The administration does not
desire to station a man-of-war in Ha
vana harbor. The authorities object to
exposing the officers and men to in
fections from dangerous diseases, and
they think their presence in the har
bor would cause some overt act to be
committed which might involve Spain
and the United States.
There was ample confirmation to-day
of the Herald's exclusive announcement
that the Maine had been ordered to be
ready to leave for Havana should Con
sul-General Lee desire her presence.
Secretary Long was disinclined to dis
cuss the situation, but finally said that
the original orders given to the vessel
had not been changed, as was stated in
The San Francisco Call
the Herald's dispatch this morning. The
instructions given to the Maine when
she left New York for Key W^st on De
cember 11 were that she might have to
proceed to Havana. The dispatch from
Consul-General Lee indicating that se
rious trouble existed in Havana came
yesterday afternoon. Tt in understood
that General Lee sent to General Blan
co and urged upon him the advisability
of havingan American warship come to
Havana. General Blanco, however, to
quiet thf> apprehension of General Lee,
stationed guards around his office and
house. In closing his dispatch to the
department General Lee intimated that
the presence of a man-of-war was de
sirable, although he did not directly
ask that one be sent to his assistance.
General Lee's dispatch was sent to the
White House, where the President and
Assistant Secretary of State Day were
in conference. Th<\se officials consid
ered the suggestion of General Lee
looking to the dispatch of a man-of
war to Cuba, and as a result Mr. Day
went to the Navy Department to see
Secretary Long. Mr. Day informed
Secretary Long that the President did
not believe that a warship should be
sent to Havana, but it was desired that
the Maine might be in readiness to pro
ceed to that port at an instant's notice.
Accordingly Secretary Long telegraph
ed instructions to Captain Sigsbee to
be ready, and General Lee was advist-d
that he might cable to Captain Sigsbee
to come to Havana should there be any
danger.
News of the suppression of the riots
was sent by General Lee late last night.
This afternoon he reiterated his state
ment that quiet prevailed, and in a Bub
sequent message explained that there

was no further pressing need of a man
of-war. An official erf the administra
tion told me to-day that there was no
need of alarm over the possibility of a
rupture between the United States and
Spain. He recalled the fact that the
Navy Department recently sent the
cruiser Marblehoad to Port Au Prince
to protect Americans. Similarly, the
Maine would have gone to Havana. He
said that the stories that the entire
squadron had been ordered to Havana
were absurd. The squadron will not
leave Hampton Roads before Sunday.
It will then proceed to Tortugas, and
f-npape in tarpet practice. It will rest
on Sunday. January 23, and will then
sail for drill grounds, which lie between
Tampa and Key West. The vessels
which will take part in tho drill will be
the New York, the flagship: the battle
ships lowa, Indiana and Massachusetts,
st-cnnd-class battleship Texas, cruisers
Detroit and Montgomery, monitor Ter-
ror and dispatch boat Fern. The Maine
will probably be directed to take part
in the squadron maneuvers. The squad
ron will remain at the'drill grounds un
til April. The Detroit has just reached
Key West from a cruise to the West
Indies, and in accordance with orders
sent by the department, the Marble
head was preparing to leave for Na
vassa Island when an accident occurred
during target practice, which resulted
in injuring fonir men. The Marble
head's departure has consequently been
delayed. The torpedo boat flotilla will
soon sail for Galveston, Tex.
President McKinley is not so anxious
to-day in regard to the Cuban situation
as he was yesterday. Reports sent out
from Washington this morning that
there was a Cabinet meeting presum
ably at 5 o'clock this morning are un
true. It is believed that the flurry is
over, at least for the present.
GREAT INTEREST IN
THE TROUBLE IS NOW
MANIFESTED AT MADRID.
Government Version Says the Uproar Is
Over, Thanks to the Loyalty of the
Volunteers at Havana.
MADRID, Jin. 13.â 1 need scarcely
tell you that news published early this
evening of the rising in Havana excit
ed acute interest. Early placards were
posted up in prominent places forecast
ing what the evening papers would
publish later on, and these were sur
rounded by crowds of people, who chat
tered as only Spaniards can. Later on
when the papers came out there was a
rush for them instantly. Men read
them, coveted up their eyes with typi
cal Spanish cloaks, and in cafes and
clubs all were intent to know the de
tails, which, when printed, did not tell
you any more than my first telegram,
The case is somewhat like that of the
Greek officers who, three years ago,
broke into the office of the Acropolis,
an Athens newspaper, and threw the
type and everything possible of the
window. But this case is worse, as it
implies that the ofTlcers in question dis
agree with autonomy, which th<> pres
ent Government is trying so hard to es
tablish. It is not true that the officers
will be summarily shot. They will be
tried by court-martial. Their conduct
has been physically what General \V. â¢>â¢-
K-r's was morally. The QueÂ°n Regent
at an early hour was given the con
tents of the telegram from Cuba, and
a council of ministers was held at the
palace.
Alarming rumors went about in the
Stock Exchange, the m<rst sinister of
which was that the volunteers had
pone over to the mutineers, when-as
the contrary is the case. They m i
stanchly by the new Government.
There was a slump all around, but it
was not serious. The Government ver
sion Issued is very brief. It says that
all the trouble is over, thanks to the
loyalty of the volunteers. The Gov
ernment feels annoyed at this trouble
occurring at a time when everything is
going so smoothly, but pains hope in
the Feeling that the United States will
now see that th'> object of the present
Government and that of the United
States are the same, and that cries <>f
"Viva Espana!" "Viva 'Weyler!" "Mn
erte ala autonomia!" uttered apainst the
<;'>vernment were also uttered against
the T'nited States' policy.
The Heraldo makes the greatest fea
! ture of all the papers, having a whole
page with the heading right across,
"Military Mutinies in Havana." It
professes to have received a special re
port through a steamer touching at
\ Key "West, and says that 100 officers
took part belonging to different corps.
The origin of the trouble t was some
newspaper attacks upon Captains Gal
vo and Sanchez, General Weyler's
aids. Captain General Blanco is much
irritated, and proposes severe action.
i A cable dispatch from Havana says
â¢ that a new law to prevent the press of
1 Cuba from attacking the prestige of the
Spanish army and officials will appear
in to-morrow's Gaceta.

The battleship Indiana left this after

A poll of the Senate

ter stands, there are fifty

ing article in an evening paper whose
editor, for reasons well understood' In
Honolulu, Is rampant for annexation.
The Star tries to make It appear that
Senators Thurston and Gear, who were
a day or two ago announced as op
posed to annexation, are now doubt
ful about their policy. In its juggle
with figures, this paper says: "With
Thurston and Gear in line, and count
ing Kenney and Smith as favorable,
there would be sixty votes for the
treaty. It is understood that McLau
rin is very apt To vote for annexation.
The fact that Mr. Morrill has been a
most attentive listener to the speeches
favoring annexation since the Senate
has been holding executive sessions,
and his remarks made to other Senat
ors are believed by many friends of
the treaty to mean he is doubtful as
to the way in which his vote will be
cast and that should it be shown his
vote would determine the question he
would likely cast it in the affirmative.
"With Thurston and Gear in favor of
the treaty, if they so declare them
selves according to the expectations of
many, Mr. Morrill would he the only
Republican in opposition, arid, as stat
ed, his opposition is now regarded as of
a doubtful nature rather than having
a firm conviction against the wisdom of
the treaty.
'â There are also possibilities of votes
favoring the treaty in addition to those
indicated. Senator Daniel remarked to
day that he was still doubtful, though
inclined to vote against annexation.
Roach and Mitchell are also doubtful.
The President is using all the Influence
in his power to make friends for the
treaty. The whole situation as it ap

HONOLULU. Jan. 6.â And now the
fair city by the Golden Gate should
prepare to salute the President of Ha
waii with all due honor and courtesy,
for he is the first, and perchance the
last. President of the Republic of Ha
waii. Once before Hawaii sent you a
King, but you treated him too hospita
bly and royally, and we lost him. The
ruler Hawaii pf-nds by the steamship
Pern on the 7th is a man cast in a dif
ferent mold. He, too, is a son of the
â Oil ami of an honored and noble mis
sionary father, and a man of very
plmnlng and charming personality. As
a nan and a gentleman his bitterest
political opponents have no words of
dispraise or in detriment of his per
sonal character. As a politician and a
â talesman he will bo on trial before his
peers in Washington.
The Council of State at its delibera
tions late yesterday afternoon decided
by a unanimous vote that Sanford B.
Dole, President of the Republic of Ha
waii, should be authorized to proceed
with all haste to Washington to labor
in the cause of annexation. This ac
tion was taken after a preliminary
meeting cf the members of the Gov
Â« rnment -with Chief Justice Judd, Gen
eral A. B. Hartwell, John Ena, F. J.
Lowrfe, Henry Waterhouse, William C.
Wilder, Colonel W. F. Allen. W. A.
Kinney, P. C. Jones, James A. Ken
nedy, C. P. RipUy, Alhert Wilcox, Cecil
Brown, George W. Smith, J. B. Ath
erton, W. R. Castle and others.
It was thought at this meeting that
a tidal wave of enthusiasm would fol
low in the President's wake in his
journey through the United States, un
til it would overwhelm all opposition
and carry the bark Â«f annexation
throuerh Congress at a thirty-five-knot
run. But then the dignity of the toga
of our chief magistrate is to be pre
served. According to the official organ
it was expressly stated that he was
not to appear before committees to be
subjected to questioning and cross
examination like an ordinary witness.
Neither was it the intention that he
should travel about addressing meet
ings or bodies indiscriminately or mis
cellaneoaaty. His conduct was to be
dignified, of course, and his goings and
comings from day to day would be left
to his own judgment and discretion.
The Cabinet then met and approved,
and then the great Council of State
also approved, and Minister Cooper, he
who rules over the Foreign Office and
Board of Education, will, after Satur
day next, bo the Acting President of
Hawaii, an honor earned through read

the "Committee of Safety," which

Dear Sir: In reply to your favor

the price of our grain bags has
been fixed by the State Board of
Prison Directors at 4^i cents. Con
ditions and terms will be same as
formerly, and I inclose herewith
a number of blank order-sheets.
The outlook now is that bags
will advance in prtco with the sea
son and our present price may be
changed by the directors at any
time. The only way I can see for
you to secure the bags you require
for your customers is to obtain
their orders as soon as possible
and send them in with the requir
ed deposit, to have them booked
for delivery at any time to suit
yourself.
The "Ostrom law" may be re
pealed or modified by the present
Legislature, but even if it is, the
same rules will most likely be fol
lowed by the directors in the dis
posal of our bags, with, perhaps,
the exception that they will not
insist upon an affidavit with or
ders from known direct custom
ers. Until something is done by
the Legislature, we must, of
course, follow the provisions of
that law. Yours truly,
W. E. HALE, Warden.

sacks as a middleman, or as depositor
of the required 10 per cent, the affidavit
affixed, in which the number of sacks
is specified as necessary for use, was
sufficient to demand their approval. It
has been a case with them of not car
ing to go behind the returns. Various
pretexts are offered for this acquiescent
course, the least plausible of which is
that several farmers pcol their applica
tions under one affidavit to secure the
benefit of the lower rate on large ship
ments. Why they could not apply un
der affidavit severally and provide for
carload consignment to a given point,
with the same result, is not explained.
Again, it is held that almost inva
riably farmers apply for more sacks
than they really need, and the residue
pass into the hands of the storekeepers
and country cjealers.
Under a carefully supervised system
of sales it does not appear that such a
contingency would be of consequence,
so far as the market price of sacks2
might be affected. Farmers having a
small surplus <>f sacks in the fall would
be forced to sell them at or below cost,
and any number of such transactions
could not raise the prices the following
Bummer, unless the board pegged them
up. The small sales made by needy
farmers of surplus sacks after harvest
have no influence on market quotations,
and if they had it would be to reduce
the local prides.
Regarding legitimate sales to actual
consumers from every point of view, if
every small farmer applicant in the
State, who came -within the 5000 limita
tion of the Ostrom law, should have se
cured too many Backs, whatever dispo
sition he might make of his surplus
could not inflate prices on him and his
fellow farmers the succeeding year.
If the truth were told the board
holds the Ostrom law in contempt.
They have assumed erroneously that
their particular function is to do as
they please with the jute mill product.
po lons as they can make a good show
ing on the balance sheets. It does not
contain a single provision of a restric
tive or mandatory nature they have
not at one time or another violated,
under specious pretensions and a
manifest misapprehension of the obli
gations Imposed on them as public of
ficials. If it is a bad law it remains to
be proved such, and even if proved a
i\v it is no part of the duty of the
prison directors to repeal it or abrogate
it. Legislatures are elected for the
purpose of annulling, making and
amending the statutes. Every time the
board has appealed to the Attorney
ral for his official consent to dis
regard certain specific provisions of the
Ostrom act he has tried to recall them
to their senses.
The frequent reminder in the lan
guage of the law that the warden and
the board should deal only with actual
consumers meant that they should
spare no vigilance and precaution in
acting upon applications. It meant
that they should closely scrutinize each
and every affidavit, and see to it that
the sacks sold were delivered to citi
zens needing them for the transporta
tion of grain from their wheat fields to
market." Confessedly th c board did
not bother their wits on this score.
In Beveral wheat sections, among
them Yolo County, The Call has taken
pains to consult the farmers as to
their experience in procuring San Quen
tin sacks, and the divulgements con
firm the assertion already made that
the supply is pretty largely controlled
by middlemen. While they are guilty
of no direct violation of the law. they
have established a. system which pro
duces that result. It is even shown
that in furtherance of their plan for
loading up each year with San Quentin
stock, the middlemen secure the sig
natures of farmers to affidavits for
sacks in excessive number, without
swearing the affiant before a proper of
ficial. Farmers familiar with the law
testify to having refused to make affi
davit to these inflated applications,
knowing they would thus commit a
misdemeanor. Afterward they secured
without affidavit all the San Quentin
packs they needed from the very men
who demanded of them an oath to a
falfe application.
In those instances where farmers
â were persuaded to attach their signa
tures to affidavits heedlessly before the
attest of a notary was affixed, or
where they willingly testified to the re
quirement of many more sacks than
they could consume, they appear to
have bet a to some extent in the power
of the jobbers as debtors. The necessi
ties of these poor men were made the
vehicle of the fraud so daringly prac
ticed. They were approached partic
ularly during 1897, when the big deal
â¢was put through, long before sacks
were needed, in the month of Febru
ary, an<l told applications must be for
warded at once or they might not be
able to get their supplies when harvest
time came. Thus informed, they made
applications to suit the greedy plans
of the middlemen.
What The Call intends to prove posi
tively at this stage of the investiga
tion is collusion between Warden Hale,
the board and at least one conspicu
ous middleman in Yolo County. Th<>
latter, Mr. Diggs, is a personal friend
of Mr. De Pue and his father-in-law,
W. <}. Hunt of Woodland, who has
been sold jute goods known as "bar
leys," or defective sacks, without
making affidavit. It will be found in
following the inquiry that Diggs sold
the Backs, and that farmers found
them perfect.
It has been asserted by The Call that
middlemen have been favored, and it
now remains to prove the fact. By
those persons who have followed the
exposure in progress it will be remem
bered that the Board of Prison Direct
ors fixed the price of Backs at $4 75 per
hundred February 3, 1895, and decided
to s^ll on application to any number
within 1,000,000. A second resolution of
similar purport was passed to cover the
disposal of a second million. As has
been intimated already, the sale for fu
ture delivery in the brief space of fif
teen days of 2,000,000 sacks shows that
certain friends and operators were, to
quote a. vulgarism, "put on.**
Dtgprs was one of the protected mid
dlemen, as will appear from the letter I
files at San Quentin. Three days before
the plan of the directors matured, the
Woodland middleman wrote to Warden
Hale as follows:
WOODLAND, CaL, Jan. 30. 1897.
W. E. Hale, Warden, San Quentin. Cal.
Dear Sir: What are sacks worth? I
already have a few customers and I would
like to do the sack business with you j
the coming year, and would like also to ;
know what would be the chances for me ;
to secure a certain number of bags for i
June and July delivery, so that I will
know I will be able to furnish my cus
tomers with them at a certain given
price.
Of course. I would furnish tho affidavit!
at the proper time. I would he pleased lo
hear from you on this i>oint (and you
might talk the matter over with our mu
tual friend, Mr. De Pue, and let me know
in regard to it). Yours truly,
M. DIGGS.
Warden Hale promptly answered:
February 3. 1897.
Mr. M. Dlpgs. Woodland. o*l.
Dear Sir: In reply to your favor of
the 30th ult. I beg to s.iy that the price
of our grain bags has been fixed by the
State Board of Prison Directors at A\
cents. Conditions and terms will be the
same as formerly, and I Inclose herewith
a number of blank order-sheets.
The outlook now is that bags will ad
vance in price with the season and our
present price may be changed by the
directors at any time. The only way I
can see for you to secure the bags you
require for your customers is to obtain
their orders as soon as possible and sen-J
them in with the required deposit, to have
them booked for delivery at any time to
suit yourself.
The "Ostrom law" may be repealed or
modified by The present Legislature, but
even if it is. the same rules will most
likely be followed by the directors In the
disposal of our bags with, perhaps, the
exception that they will not Insist upon

affidavit with orders from known di-
rect customers. Until something is done
by the Legislature, we must, of course,
follow the provisions of that law. Yours
truly, W. K. HALE. Warden.
Then comes Mr. Piggs, under date
four days before the board raised thÂ«
price of sacks 25 cents a hundred, with
the following:
WOODLAND, CaL, Feb. 18, 1897.
W. E. Hale, Warden. San Quentin, Cal.
Dear Sir: Will you please let me know
as soon as you can after you decide to
make a change in tho prto of bags?
Notify me as soon as possible after you
find out there is to be a change. Yours
truly. M. DIGGS.
What Warden Hale telegraphed is
not known, but here is the interesting
letter Mr. Diggs sent to him the day
before the price was put up to $5 00.
WOODLAND, CaL, Fob. 19. ISP7.
W. E. Hale, Warden, San Quentin. Cal.
Dear Sir: I wired you this morning to
reserve for me 66.000 sacks, and that I
would forward affidavits. I received your
answer stating that you wosid do so.
tor which please accept thanks. It will
probably take me several days to get
the affidavits, as some of the farmers live
quite a distance. in the country, and it is
storming so hard and owing to the i^nr
condition of the roads it may be s.-veral
days before they prt in. but I will for
ward them to you as soon as I possibly
can.
Thanking you for past favors, T remain
yours truly, M. DIGGS.
Mr. Diggs had not the affidavits to
foward just then, but would get them
as soon as the county roads were aus
picious. Thus he got In on the ground
1!.. 0r price of $4.75 per hundred sacks,
saving his distance by a day and the
good offices of the board.
R. Lichtenberg of San Francisco fre
quently sells raw jute to the board on
contract. He is evidently on excellent
terms with the memDers and keeps in
touch with their management of af
fairs. On February 18, two days be
fore the price of San Quentin sacks
was advanced from $4.75 to $5, Mr.
Lichtenberg put in applications that
were accepted for a total of 7">,000 sacks
as follows: George E. Williams, 5000;
J. A. Williams, 10.000; Frank S. John
son, 10.000; Jacob Levy Sr., 50,000. Two
of these orders were not filled until
May, the other two remaining in the
State warehouse until July.
SACKS SOLD
WITHOUT
AFFIDAVIT
Middleman Diggs Does a
Thriving Busioess ir) San
Quentin Products.
Careful investigation by The Call
shows that among the most extensive
dealers in grain sacks in Yolo county
are Marshall Diggs. I. P. Diggs, T. B.
Gibson and C. D. Simpson, of Wood
land, and Borach & Levy of Yolo,
while many others deal in them to a
less extent.
The firm of Borach & Levy, as shown
by the statements of several farmers
in that vicinity, entered into contracts
with farmers to supply San Quentin
bags without even having them make
the necessary affidavits. C. E. St. Louis
says he entered into a contract for 800
1 prison sacks and that they were duly i
! delivered to him. He made no affidavit
i and was not aware that any of his
neighbors did. In addition to his affi
davit he stated to The Call correspond
ent that when he ordered his sacks one
of the members of the firm handed him
a blank application and told him to
sign his name to it. This he did and
' the merchant then took charge of it.
Mr. St. Louis had no idea what became
i of it, whether it was filled out by the
merchants and forwarded to San Quen
tin or not. He was positive, however,
he did not go before a notary and attest
it. It was his belief that the others
signed blank forms in the same man
! ner. Such a proceeding is clearly in
violation of the law governing the sale
of jute bags.
But while almost anybody with suffl
( cient capital can trade in San Quentin
I sacks there was one transaction in 1893
that is tinctured with something more
than mere evasion of the act of 1893.
Only one grade of bags is made at I
San Quentin. Every year there is a j
S quantity of bags that are supposed to j
'be imperfect. These are sorted out and !
| are what are known as culls. In 1893 ]
; and 1894 these bales were stamped and
known as "barleys," but during the
past two seasons no distinctive mark
has been put upon them and instead !
| of being known as "barleys" they are
now called "culls."
i W. G. Hunt of Woodland, who in
1893 purchased 5000 "culls" at 5 cents,
i : Is the father-in-law of ex-Prison Di
i } rector E. J. De Pue, whose official term
I ; recently expired. Mr. Hunt owns 800
Â» acres of land on Cache Creek. 515 acres
i of which are set out in fruit trees and
known as the Yolo orchard, of the
â  land not included in the orchard about
100 acres are covered with timber and
: i less than that quantity is sown to
i j wheat,
i Mr. Hunt's purchases of "culls" were
I 1 made on June 10, July l, July 20 and
THE SAX FTCAXCTSCO CATX, FKIBAT, JAKXTABY 14, 189 S.
August 12 of 1593. From March until
August th" regular price f<>r bags was
|5 ~:> per hundred. In the latter month
the Directors advanced the price to
$6 40 per hundred. He made no affi
davit \vh. n he bought the culls, al
though the law says that "Al! orders
for jut>* triM da must be accompanied by
an affidavit setting forth that the
amount of goods contained in the or
der are for individual and personal use
of the applicant, mid affidavit to be
subscrib.-d and sworn to before some
Notary Public or Justice of the Peace."
Mr. Hunt was present at a meeting
of the Board of Prison Directors at
which the Question <-f disposing of im
perfect bags was discussed, and he sail
he could use some of them. Tlv hoard
decided to lot him have some at $5 per
hundred, and the purchases were made
in four lots.
That these bags were not for his own
use, and that they were n"t Imperfect
hags, but of first quality, is shown by
the affidavit* of two highly respected
farmers of Tolo County. James E.
Scarlett, who owns 31 T> acres of land
about seven milts from Woodland,
makes affidavit that in 1893 I. P. Dtggs
offered to let him have all the bags he
needed for that season. Pipers was do-
Ing Scarlett's harvesting, and. accord
ing to the tatter's affidavit, Digga told
him he had got the bars from Hunt:
that, although they were marked and
Fold as "barleys." they were perfectly
good. Scarlett pays he examined the
sacks, and found them to be without
flaws or imperfections, and accordingly
he bought all he needed for that year.
L. Cramer, another Yolo County
farmer, makes affidavit that during I*W?
Diggs offered to sell him what grain
sacks he needed, and stated, as he did
to Sr arlett, that the sacks were known
as "barleys," but were first class in ev
ery respect; that he had p<7t them from
Hunt, and that Hunt had procured
them through the influence of Pc Pup.
Cramer did not take any. as be had
already purchased his bags.
Mr. Piggs was ask.-d fur an explana
tion of that and other transactions but
hf refused to make any statement
whatever thnt would throw any light
upon his dealings in crrain baps.
Mr. Piggs owns 198 acres of land in
Tolo County, and last year he rented
lfiO acres from K. U. Lowe, making a
total of 3'S acres he cultivated. This,
at the average yield of ten sacks to the

duly delivered to me and were the San Quentin bags. I could have <
had either San Quentin or Calcutta bags. It was understood that we t
were to pay more than the rate quoted at San Quentin prison, but we t
were satisfied to do this in consideration of the fact that the freight t
charges were paid, and that we were given credit for the bags until i
after our crops were harvested. This is the first year I have purchased i
San Quentin bags from an outside dealer. t

actÂ«, would make 35*0 sacks he would
require for his own use. Certainly, his
CTOfM could not be so heavy as to re
quire more than 5000 bags, yet on Feb
ruary 19 last I. T. Diggs, through his
cousin, Marshall Diggs. filed an appll
catlOQ for 12,000 San Quentin sacks. |
which, according to the prison records,
were delivered on June 1.
J E. Scarlett, who bought some
"culls" of I. P. Diggs in lhi'3. also
bought 2000 San Quentin bags from him
in 1897. This would show conclusively
that Mr. Diggs did not use all the bagn
he ordered, but when he was asked for
information on the subject he eaid that
if a farmer had more sacks than ho
needed it was natural for him to get
rid of them rather than carry them
for a year.
"Rut how is it that you ordered 12,000
sacks, Mr. Diggs? Surely your crops
never gave promise of such a yield as
that," was suggested.
"Last year I farmed nearly 500
acres," replied Mr. Diggs.
"But even so, you could not possibly
want 12,000 sacks for your own use."
"Well, a man is liable to overestimate
his crop sometimes. It is a hard mat
tes to R<> into a field of growing wheat
and estimate just what it will yield."
All attempts to induce the gentleman
to say how many surplus sacks be had.
or what he had done with them, met
with the same ill success. Mr. Diggs
would not even admit that he had sold
any, although he was told that Mr.
Scarlett had made affidavit to that ef
fect.
"I know Mr. Scarlett well," said Mr.
Diggs, "and he is one of the most re
sponsible men inÂ« the county, but you
know that everybody is liable to make
mistakes."
He djd not deny that he had sold the
sacks, but intimated that he might
have loaned or traded them to Bear
lett. The latter's affidavit, however,
names the price he paid Mr, DiggÃ for
the bags.
Mr. Diggs declared he had no recol
lection whatever of the transaction in
the culls or "barleys" referred to. and
professed ignorance of what "culls" or
"barleys" were. He said he paid cash
for everything he bought and kept no
books, therefore he had no means of
telling anything about his transactions
of former years, and did not take the
trouble to remember them.
"But did you not sell some 'culls' to
Mr. Scarlett in 1893?"
"That Is too far back for me to re
member anything about. Possibly I
did; I cannot say now."
"Did you offer to sell any to Mr.
Cramer?"
"I tell you I cannot remember all my
transactions so far back."
"Did you purchase any bags from Mr.
Hunt that year?"
"You had better ask Mr. Hunt, he
can probably tell you better than I
can."
"But surely you can remember
whether you ever bought any bags
from him and if at less that the reg
ular rate?"
"Now, see here! If a man does you
a favor, you are not going to say or do
anything that might work him an in-
Jury, are you? Well, that's my case. I
have absolutely nothing to say on this
subject; if you want any information
go to Mr. Hunt."
"Do you remember having bought
any kind of sacks from him at any
time?"
"I really can't say whether I have or
not. As I told you before, such matters
pass from my mind, and I never pay
any further attention to them."
W. O. Hunt is classed as one of the
wealthiestmenin Yolo County. In addi
tion to the Yolo orchard, he owns much
property in Woodland, and resides
there. He was not inclined to throw
any more light upon the deal in
"culls" than Mr. Diggs. ;ind made no
secret of his desire to have the inter
view terminate with all possible haste.
"If you want any information go to
headquarters for it," was all he would
say.
He declined to state whether he had
<lÂ»-alt in prison baps since 1893. ur
whither be had ever had any dealings
with Marshall or I. P. Diggs.
s<mie idea of the extent of the traffic
In San Quentin grain baps may be
gained from the number that passed
through the hands <-f Marshall Diggs
of Woodland last season. As shown by
records at San Quontin. Mr. Dipgs sent
in orders for 156,000 bags between Feb
ruary 9 and April 14. 1597. the orders
being filled out in Mr. Pipgs' name.
while the affidavits bore the names of
the farmers.
A copy of the order and affidavit of
A. Bourn of Yolo County, which is sim
ilar to the others, is herewith Riven:

Subscribed and sworn to before me. this sth
day of March, 1397. J. I. MeCONNELLs
[L B.] Notary Public.
It will be noted that all the orders
but the last two, calling for all but
9000 of the sacks ordered by Mr. Diggs,
were filed prior to March 13, on which
date the board advanced the price to
$5 40 per hundred.
Mr. Dipgs expressed the utmost will
ingness to explain his connection with
the traffic in San Quentin baps. He
made no Â»cÂ» ret of the fact that he
handled them, but explained that he
<li<l so as a matter of a<< â â mmodation
to his customers, and that the profit
h>Â» made on them was limited to the
difference in the freight charges on car
load lots and on k:Â«s than full carloads.
"The extent of my dealing: in San
Quentin bags is this," said Mr. Biggs.
"Early in the season I take orders from
farmers for what grain sacks they
need. These orders, accompanied' by
the usual affidavit, I forward to San
Quentin, together with the necessary
10 per cent deposit, which secures the
bags, subject to orders. When I get
ready to have the bags shipped, I for
ward the remaining M per cent of the
purchase pr i and the bag*" are for
warded.V % Â-.
"How is it that you order your bags
so far in advance of the time you have
them delivered?"
"Merely to secure prompt delivery
when I get reads fÂ° r them."
"The orders sent in by you are us
ually marked, 'Shipping Instructions to
follow.' What is that for?"
"Oh. I do that because, as Is often
the case, I <!<â > not want them all de
liver. â¢<! at i :â¢ place. For instance.
Charles Pay ordered all of his baga
from me lnst season, taking in all, I
think, about 21.000 San Quentin bags.
Part of these were for his Yolo ranch.
and the others were to be sent to an
other ranch in the San Joaquin valley.
"When he got ready to use them I for
warded instructions as to the number
to be shipped to each point."
"How are these orders and affidavits
made out, Mr. Diggs?"
"Right hrre in my store. The far
mer gives the number of bags he wants
and the order is made out. He signs it
and makes affidavit that they are for
his personal use. We forward the or
der, and sometimes advance the 10 per
cent deposit."
"Are these orders ever raised; that is,
do the orders call for more sacks than
the farmer really needs?"
"Not to my knowledge."
"Rut you certainly have had prison
made bags for sale and have sold
quantities of them?"
"Well, yes. I have, but it Is like this:
A farmer cannot estimate from his
growing grain just how many sacks
he will require and if he has a surplus
I take them off his hands."
"What is the largest surplus you re
member a fnrmer to have had during
th^ past season?"
"Oh, I can't answer that, but some
crops will fan short one-half. Of
course they don't want to carry the
surplus bags over to the next year so
I take them and sell them to some
body who needs more than he counted
on."
"Well, your cousin. I. P. Diggs, for
instance, did he have any surplus bags
from last season?"
"Yes, a few."
"He cultivated about 3"0 acres of
land last season, did he not?"
"Yes, about that."
"And ten sacks to the acre Is a good,
fair average?"
"Yes. that is a fair average."
"So that would make about 3500
sacks he would require?"
"Yr-s. about that."
"Then why did you. on February 19
last, accept an order from him for
12.000 sacks?"
"A man may go out in the spring and
estimate what his crops may yield, and
when he comes to harvest them they
may fall short one-half. I have known
that to happen frequently, and, of
course, rather than to carry the sur
plus sacks they have bought over until
the following ppason the farmers are
willing to sell them at even less than
Cost."
YOLO. Tolo County, State of California. January 1, 1898.
I am a farmer cultivating 100 acres in township 10, range 2 east,
Yolo County. In the year 1593, I. P. Diggs came to me and offered to
supply me with all the grain bags I needed for that season's crop.
He told me they were San Quentin wheat sacks, but were marked
and shipped as barley sacks. He assured me they were No. 1 sacks
in every respect. He told me he got the sacks through W. G. Hunt, of
Woodland, and that Hunt got them through the influence of Prison
Director De Pue, who is Hunt's son-in-law. He said the price was
$5 per hundred, but I cannot remember whether that included the
freight, or I was to pay that. I did not take any of the sacks, as I
had already purchased all I needed.
That was the only time Dlggs ever spoke to me about grain baps.
About the first of June, 1897, I bought 1000 San Quentin grain bags
from Borach & Levy of Yolo, paying for them $5 12^4 per hundred, de
livered in Yolo. I was not asked, and did not make any affidavit, nor
did I sign any paper whatever. I merely ordered the sacks and got
them at the depot. L- CRAMER.

"But how can a man who is culti- j
vating a small farm on which it is im
possible to make such an over-estimate
as occurred In this instance make am
davit that he requires 12,000 bags when |
it is impossible for the land he is cul- j
tivating to yield more than, say, 4000
sacks of grain at the most?"
"I don't know anything about that.
All I can say is that if â  man gives an j
order for a certain quantity of sacks
we fill out the order as he gives it and
never question it."
"And you are Entirely willing to take
all the surplus sacks he may have?"
"Oh, certainly. I only wish we could
get hold of more than we do."
"How many San Quentin sacks do .
you think you handled last year?"
"Oh. probably 160.000."
"Have you had any dt-alings with Bo- j
rach & Levy?"
"Yes; I have sold thotn BOBM Snn
Quentin sacks, but how many I do not !
know."
"None of the sacks ordered by you i
are ever delivered before June, are
they?"
"No; I never call for th^-m until the
farmers begin to want them. They are
delivered mostly during June and
July."
Mr. Digps was then questioned about
the traffic in "culls," and at first pro
fessed the densest ipnorance on the
subject, but later he admitted having
heard something about them several
years ago. Ho denied emphatically,
however, that he had ever dealt in
them, and did not know of anybody
who had.
"Have you ever handled any 'culls'?"
"What are culls?" returned the mer
chant. "I never heard of culls."
It was explained that they were
marked "barley," but were comnumly
called "rulls."
"No; I never heard of them before."
replied Mr. I >igps. "I thought that
only one prade of sacks was manufact
ured at the prison."
After some further conversation he
suddenly remembered having heard
something about culls before, but only
In a general way. and was positive he
had never handled any.
"It must have he?n about 1593 or '4,"
said he. "that some barley s:i<ks, or
what were called barley sacks, wore
sold at the prison, but who bought
them, or how many were sold, I can
not say."
PRACTICAL
EXPERIENCES
OF FARMERS.
Results of an Investigation)
fimong Wheat-Raisers in
Yolo County.
Several days were spent by Call rep
resentatives among the farmers in dif
ferent sections of Yolo County, and
many WON the side lights thrown upon
the handling of San Quentin bags.
There wore some who, while admitting
that they had hoard and seen enough
to be convinced that merchants and
speculators WOTt derhrlng a rood in
come from the handling of prison bags,
were opposed to making: any statement
for publication for fear, as they ex
plained, lest they might provoke the
wrath of men to whom they were un
der obligations, in one way or another.
Farmers who till thousands of acres, as
well as men who have barely enough
land on which to eke out a living, were
seen, and nearly all expressed the opin
ion that a thorough investigation
should be made.
That San Quentin bass can be pro
cured in large quantities without the
necessity of filing an affidavit Is proven
beyond a doubt, while the prices charg
ed by these dealers, including freight
from Pan Quentin. vary from the fac
tory price to nearly 25 per cent above.
< ;>'orge Scott owns and farms more
land than any other man in Yolo Coun
ty, his farm lying about sixteen miles
from Woodland. Last season he re
quired 20.000 sacks to hold his crop of
wheat. Mr. Scott does not use San
Quentin sacks, because the Calcutta^
are cheaper and answer the purpose
just as well, although they are not
quite as good in quality as the prison
goods.
"It has long been a mystery to me,"
said Mr. Scott, "why sacks cannot be
manufactured at San Quentin prison
at a less cost than they can be im
ported from Calcutta, but whenever I
want to buy any, I find that the latter
are the cheapest, and so I take them.
The San Quentin factory is supposed
to be operated for the benefit of the
farmers, but I fail to see where they
derive much benefit from it. Regard
ing the handling of prison bags by
dealers, of course I cannot speak from
experience, as I have never purchased
any, but I have no doubt that anybody
can get all the prison bags he wants in
season, without sending to San Quen
tin for them."
Charles T. Day lives about three
miles southwest of Woodland on one
of the largest and richest farms in the
Sacramento Valley, which he is proud
to call his own. Mr. Day is well known
throughout the State and is generally
regarded as an up-to-date farmer and
a shrewd business man. But when the
subject of prison bags was brought to
his attention he laughingly admitted
i that there were some things of which
â  he had but vague knowledge, and one
! of those was the management of the
I San Quentin jute factory.
"I understand the law governing the
sale of prison-made bags," said Mr.
Day, "but I imagine there are few
farmers in this section, at least, but
know that its provisions are evaded
and violated in one way or another. I
have told some of the men I knew to be
dealing in bags that the affair would
be thoroughly ventilated sooner or
later.
"Why, only last season." Mr. Day
continued, "a certain dealer in this
town whose name I must decline to
give, came to me and asked me why I
didn't buy 'culls' instead of the regular
sacks. I had never heard of "culls' be
fore, and I asked him what they were.
" 'Don't you know about these culls?"
asked he. apparently surprised at my
ignorance.
"I confessed that I did not, and he
explained what culls were, and assured
me that they were as good as the reg
ular bags. That was the first I ever
heard of culls, and I told this party
that exposure would come eventually,
but he did not seem to think so.
"I did not buy any culls, but went to
the Bank of Tolo, as I always do, and
tilled out an application fur 1f.,000 San
Quentin sacks. Then I went before a
notary and made the usual affidavit
that they were for my own use. This
order was forwarded for me by Mr.
Diggs. So far as I know, my affidavit
was regular in every respect; I follow
ed the same course I do every year."
"Did you order any more sacks than
you required?"
"No; but there is another thing: I
have noticed, and that is that the deal
ers are always anxious to have a far
mer order all he can possibly need.
They assure him that they will take
all he may have left over. That haa
been my experience repeatedly. I have
been told to be sure and get enough
sacks, and there* will be no danger of
my being out of pocket by getting too
many. But I have never ordered more
than I thought I needed, and if any of
my applications have called for more,
the figures have been raised after I
signed them."
Mr. Day would not say who it was
that gave him the information regard
ing culls, but as Marshall Diggs han
dled his order for him and has done so
before, it is not unreasonable to sup
pose that it was he who gave the ad
vice to purchase them.
Asa Morris, who has many acres ly
ing between Tolo and Knights Land
ing, said:
"It has been no secret In these parts
that San Quentin bags could be ob
tained at any time from dealers. Diggs
and Hunt of Woodland have dealt in
these bags extensively, and merchants
throughout this section are always
ready to supply either Quentin or
Calcutta bags at practically the same
price as quoted at the prison.
"I have never bought any prison bags
from dealers, preferring to get them
direct from San Quentin. This season
I bought Calcutta bags, but several of
my neighbors bought prison bags and I
am quite certain that some of them at
least got them from Diggs and other
dealers.
"I have often wondered how these
dealers got hold of prison bags, and
naturally supposed there was some
thing shady about it, for the law is
very explicit in regard to their sale
and requires every purchaser to make
affidavit that they are for his own use.
Consequently there must be something
wrong when men who do not farm a
foot of ground, or at most compara
tively small tracts, stand ready to fur
nish at any time more prison- bags than
they would need for their own use in
twenty years. These men do not han
dle bags as a matter of accommodation
to farmers, and if they get prison bags
at a less rate than the farmers can the
farmer is a double loser, for he not
only helps to support the prison, but
he is charged more for an article os
tensibly manufactured for his especial
benefit than a few favored dealers are,
and the latter are thus enabled to
make a profit out of the farmer on
prison bags that the law intended there
should be no traffic in. I sincerely hope
the entire matter will be thoroughly
sifted."
G. B. Eustis, an extensive wheat
grower, living about six miles from
Knights Landing, was most caustic in
his comments on the way prison sacks
were being Bold.
"I have thought for some years that
there was something wrong about the
handling of the San Quentin product
and many of my neighbors have had
the same idea. For that reason I and
T think others have not cared whether
I used prison or Calcutta bags.
"There has been nothing secret about
dealers handling prison bags. Hunt,
Diggs and others have sold both San
Quentin and Calcutta bags to farmers
throughout this section for years, and
it has always been a mystery to the
farmers where they got the former.
"This past season I bought 1500 bags
of Borach & Levy at Yolo, and they
offered me either brand, but I took the
Calcutta bags, as they hold more and
are just as good as the San Quentin
bags. It is known to everybody around
here that almost every storekeeper in
the county is prepared to furnish any
quantity at short order. "Where they
get them of course I can't say, but I
have all along thought that some San
Francisco houses were handling San
Quontin bags and supplied the interior
dealers.
"We all know the law governing the
sale of San Quentin bags, and if a
farmer wants to purchase from the
prison direct he has to make the usual
affidavit that they are for his own use,
but of course, with almost any mer
chant handling them openly, I be
lieved that the law was being evaded,
to put it mildly, and the natural sup
position is that the Prison Directors
must be aware of what is going on. I
hear much about the defects in the law
governing the sale of prison bags, but
It is my opinion that if it were proper
ly enforced it would afford ample pro
tection to the farmers, as it was intend
ed to do."
T. F. Laugenour is one of the oldest
and most highly respected farmers in
Yolo County. His farm comprises one
of the most fertile tracts along Cache
Creek. Mr. Laugenour explained that
his memory had failed him somewhat
and he could not recall the dates of
his transactions with the dealers, but
that bags of San Quentin make were
openly and constantly handled by them
there could be no doubt. There were
several people in Woodland, he said,
who dealt in sacks, as did also Borach
& Levy of Yolo, and other merchants
in the county. He coula not remember
anybody In Knights Landing who han
dled them, and it was his impression
that there was nobody there who was
engaged in the business.
"I have not used any San Quentin
bags for the past two seasons," said
Mr. Laugenour, "for the reason that
Calcutta bags have been cheaper, and
I find them just as good. But in 1895.
I think it was, I bought a number of
prison-made bags from If. Diggs of
Woodland. I do not remember just how
many I purchased or what I paid for
them, but I am sure it was in that
year that I got them.
"Of course San Quentin bags are sold
outside the prison; every farmer in
Yolo knows it. But where or how tba
dealers get them I do not know. I
have been told, however, that the deal
ers buy up the surplus bags from the
farmers, but it is not likely that they
depend upon that source alone for their
supplies. What I mean by surplus bags
is this: If a farmer bought 5000 bags
at San Quentin and only used 4000,
some dealer would take the other thou
sand. That explanation does not
amount to much, though, for a farmer
generally has a pretty good idea of
how many bags he will need before he

tempting to Explain Her
Strange Absence.
SANTA ROSA. Jan. 13.â Jessie Pickerel!, the pretty 16-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Pickerell of this city, has disappeared,
and despite the frantic effortl of her parents and the systematic
work of the police, absolutely no trace of her can be obtained. Yes
terday at about noon Bhe left her home at the corner of Cleveland
avenue and Lincoln Btreet, having obtained her mother's permission
to visit her aunt In South Turk, on the opposite side of the city. As
ehe had said she Intend* d staying all night nothing was thought of her
absence until about noon to-day, when Mrs, l'ickerell began to feel
bo me what won
Shortly after luncheon, unable to control her anxiety longer, she
visited her sister's house, only to find that her daughter had not been
there I all. A hui trch of the neighborhood was made, but no
t r;l , â¢- the missing girl could be f< und. Mrs. Pickerell and her sister
th< reupon returned to the vicinity of the Pickerell home, and a tour of
the houses of the pirl's friends was commenced, but all to no purpose.
A boy was Bent to summon Mr. Pickerell, and upon his return from the
where he Is employed, and Just as he was entering the gate, he
mtered a postman upon his daily rounds. The carrier handed Mr.
pickerell a letter, and it was found to contain the following:
Dear Father: I leave you this letter to let you know that I am go
lr.tr away. I am not happy at home. Please do not grieve for me. OJoi-d
!r Papa.' "JESSIE."
letter was not in the girl's handwriting, and, instead of prov
ifort to the parents, it only served to increase their fears.
The police were at once notified, and every possible clew was investi
gated without effect. The girl is well known here and the railroad peo
re certain that she has not left town on any of the trains de
parting since her disappearance.
The mother can give no reason for her leaving home, although
she admitted that she had noticed that J<-ssie had appeared somewhat
despondent for a past week. Mrs. Pickerell is completely prostrated.

Outcome of His Attack Upon

Chamber of Deputies Passes a Reso
lution Declaring Confidence in
tlio Government.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Jan. 13.â Count de Mun, the
Clerical leader, caused excitement In
the Chamber of Deputies to-day when
he asked to be allowed to question the
raiment on the subject of Emlle
Zola's open letter to President Faure.
M. Colberry caused an uproar by reply
ing that the absence i f General I
compelled a postponement of dlscus
sion. Count de Mun declared that the
question was one that could not be put
off.
Loud protests greeted M. Cochery's
announcement that the Government
posed to iix a day for the debate,
and the Minister finally agreed to sus
1 â¢!. 1 the session until General Billot
could be present.
When the session was resumed the
Premier, M. Meline, made a statement,
saying in substance:
"We understand the excitement In
the Chamber in the presence of the at
tack <Â»n the chiefs of the army. The
Government, recognizing their duty,
have derided to prosecute M. Zola, al
though they are not blind to the fact
that the prosecution is desired in order
to prolong the agitation. It Is to be
hoped the ChaAber â will have confi
dence in the energy and wisdom of the
Government."
Count de Mun said the Government
owed it to the army that it be assured
of its confidence, as it was Impossible
to allow the accumulation of insults
and attacks.
General Billot said this was the
fourth time he had been called upon
t'> defend a matter upon which judg
ment had already been passed. The
army, he added, treated the attacks
with contempt, but it was painful to
see it attacked from abroad. The army
was composedly pursuing its mission,
and in the day of need would know how
to do its duty. (Applause.)
M. Jaures. th<- Socialist leader, con
demned the court-martial proceedings
behind closed doors, which, he asserted,
"left the mind of the nation groping in
obscurity." He also asked the House
not to repudiate the subordination of
the military to the civil power. To
this General Billot replied:
"The army obeys its chief, and, as
the faithful guardian of republican In
stitutions, pursues its sacred mission."
M. Cavalgnac, Republican, asked the
Government to communicate to the
House the secret document which had
determined the condemnation of Drey
fus, which caused murmuring. M. Me
line said it was Impossible to re-open
before the Chamber the case already
Judged by court-martial.
Tli<- House rejected the motion of M.
Cavaignao regretting "the Govern
ment's vacillating policy," and adopted
by a vote of 311 to 21U the combined
nation of M. Marty (Republican) and
Count de Mun, expressing conlidence in
tii- Government and reiying on the
government "to take the necessary
Steps to stop the campaign against tht
army."
Zola's letter formally accused the
Minister of War. General Rillnt. Gen
eral Mercier, Major Ravary and Major
Patis de Clane of perjury in the Ester

gan to-. lay at the < >Id Bailey. Justice
Channel presided. The audience in
cluded many theatrical people. There
were about a dozen ladles in curt. At
the witness table sat Tom Terriss, son
of the deceased. Answering the usual
question of the clerk, Prince declared
that he was â¢guilty, with provocation."
The prisoner demanded the assist
ance of Queen's counsel. The Judge
explained that this was Impossible
Without B] !:se, but added that
th-- prison, r was entitled to counsel,
and advised him to take the adv; â 
til-- lawyer wlv> appeared for him at
the Instance of his friends.
Prince finally consented to have
counsel. After consultation with mun
s.-l. Prince said that, bung advised to
do so, be would plead not guilty.
The prosecution then opened their
case. As the murder was being de
scribed. Prince frequently smiled and
wiot,- a number of notes to his coun
sel, apparently to correct absolutely
unimportant details. Th-> testimony
presented was the same as was taken
at Bow-street Police Court, when the
prisoner was arraigned. Tom Terriss
was the first witness.
The defense alleged that Prince suf
fered in his youth from â  sunstroke,
and that more recently he has had de
lusions.
The mother and brother of the pris
oner testified regarding the sunstroke.
It developed that Prince had claimed
thai be was Christ and that his mother
was the Virgin Mary. It was als
sorted in court that Prince had once
attacked one of his brothers with a

The Judge summed up. favoring
Prince's insanity, and the jury was out
half an hour. The prisoner was pale
and careworn as he faced the jury.
The jury returned a verdict that
Prince was "guilty; that he was aware
of what he did: but the jury, accepting
the medical testimony, declare him to
be irresponsible."
After hearing the verdict Prince at
tempted to make a speech, but was
checked by the Judge. The prisoner
then thanked all concerned, nt which
some applause was started, which was
Immediately suppressed by the Judge.
The judgment of the court was that
Prince be detained as a criminal luna

ANACONDA, Mont.. Jan. 13.â At an
early hour this morning the discovery
was made that five men were entomb
ed in a tunnel, which the Anaconda
Copper Mining Company is construct
ing for water-fluming purposes under a
bluff about a half mile beyond the city
limits. A large quantity of powder
which has been carried into the tun
nel for the use of the night shift was
exploded by some mi ans, now un
known, wrecking the face of the tun
nel, which is about I^' feet long, and
resulting in a slidt- of earth which
closed the tunnel completely at a dis
tance of about forty feet from its en
trance.
From the moment of the discovery of
the accident, diligent effort has been
made to reach the five miners, concern
ing whose fate the deepest anxiety is
lilt. At in o'clock to-night, those en
gaged in rescue work felt sure that
the noise of the "miners' signal" reach
ed them from within the tunnel.
It was proposed to drive a three
inch pipe through the mass of earth
that had filled the tunnel. This plan
was vigorously followed and a twenty
foot length was successfully driven. A
second section was connected and to
the joy of the anxious spectators it
penetrated the mass of earth. Imme
diately, at 11 o'clock to-night, com
munication was established with the
Imprisoned men. Four of them were
reported alive and well; one is dead.
The work of reaching them is going on
with greater z>-al than ever. The men,
through an improvised speaking tube,
reported that they suffered from
neither thirst nor hunger, but that they
wanted candles.
Joe bfcLeod, formerly of Butte. is the
dead miner. The surviving four are:
Andrew I'lsher. Michael Kozina. Mat
Petritz and Mat Kozin.
Six hours hence will probably find
them released. It is not yet learned
how the explosion occurred.

Telling Testimony Against
the Baden Murder
Suspect.
Hotel- Keeper Ferriter Positive
in His Identification or
the Prisoner.
Weapons With Which Andrews
WÂ»3 Slain Purchased in a
San Francisco Store.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 13.â The evi
dence thus far presented in the South
San Francisco murder case bodes ill for
Harry Winters, the defendant, now on
trial at this place. A number of wit
nesses were examined for the prosecu
tion to-day, and their cross-examina
tion by the defense strengthened rather
than weakened their testimony.
Patrick Ferriter, who was being ex
amined yesterday when court ad
journed, was placed on the stand this
morning. He testified that when the
robber on the stairs commenced shoot
ing Connelly called out:
"For God's sake, Ferriter, who is
doing the shooting."
Ferriter replied: "Get out of the
way â it's the man down stairs."
Just then Connelly cried out: "I'm
Bhot," and fell back on the Hour.
Ferrlter followed the robbers down
stairs, and saw Winters fall over a
watering trough. It was a bright
moonlight night and he could Bee him
very distinctly.
Upon cross-examination Ferrlter
positively identified Winters as the
man who told him to throw up his
hands. He said ho could recognize the
several persons as they came into the
hall in answer to his call for help.
The next witness called lor the pros
ecution was Rachael Tennabaum, who
conducts a second-hand Btore at 213
Third street, San Francisco, She posi
tively identified Winters as a man who
came into her place during the latter
j-art of October last. He at the time
had a hammerless Smith & Wesson re-.
volver, which he desired to trad
two common revolvers. She mad" the
exchange with him. When Bhown th<->
two revolvers taken from Winters and
Raymond she identified them as the
name ones, but on cross-examination
modified her statement by paving that
in her opinion they were the same.
Charles Tennabaum, her son, corrobo
rated her in every particular. He
further testified that Winters told him
he had need of the revolver* In his
business, which was traveling through
the country. The defendant entered
his name in a book kept by the Tenna
baum's us "L. S. Smith, 25 Fiilmore
street."
Police Officer Eugene V. Herve testi
fied that at 4 :4 T. o'clock on the morn
ing <>f the 17th of November, he arrest
ed a man whom he identified as C. 11.
Raymond, while the latter was coming
up the road toward San Francisco. The
arrest was made near the line divid
ing Sau Mateo from Pan Francisco
County. Raymond said he was from
San Jjse and was going to San Fran-
Cisco.. A revolver, which had been re
cently discharged, having one loaded
and four empty chambers, was taken
from him. The pistol was identified as
one sold to Winters by Mrs. Tenna
baum. He explained the empty cham
bers by saying that he had been shoot
ing at the fences and at objects on the
marsh Just for fun. Lieutenant Wil
liam F. Burke, before whom Raymond
was taken at Ocean View, testified that
Raymond told him he hailed from New-
York City; that he had been at San
Jose, where he was a roustabout and
collector for the Salvation Army.
When asked what wages he got for that
kind of work he said he didn't get very
large wages. "God pays me," ho de
clared. Lieutenant Burke noticed on
his Bhoulder tra^s of whitewash. Ray
mond explained that he had been lean-
Ing up against a fence. }{,- subse
quently took great pains to remove all
traces of the whitewash.
James MeXamara was called and
testified that on the fatal night he was
a roommate Ot C. A. Andrews. the man
who was murdered. He retired betwe< n
8 and fi o'clock and Andrews came in
somewhat later. He was awakened in
the early morning by the barking of
Ferriter's dog. He heard Ferriter get
up, come to the dor.r and speak to
someone. He was startled by the cries
<.f the hotel man of "Murder!" and
"Help!" He opened the door and looked
out. The men were scuffling in the
hall. Ferriter called for a light, and
McNamara and Andrews then went
out, the latter carrying a candle. He
went to the assistance of Ferriter and
caught the robber by the throat and
got him down on the floor. Then some
one commenced shooting. Connelly fell
at one of the shots. Four shots were
fired. The robber escaped and then
Andrews told him he was root twice.
He and Andrews walked into their
room, where the latter was put into
bed. While McNamara could not pos
itively identify "Winters as the robbcrf
yet it is his opinion that he is the man,
as he looks like the one.
The District Attorney expects to fin
ish the introduction of evidence for the
prosecution to-morrow.
HOW DIGGS

places his order. Moreover, it is not
likely that a man would pay freight
on 2000 bags and then sell them at less
than the rt-gular rate quoted at the
prison, as he would have to. So where
â¢would the dealer make a profit? I am
aware that it is necessary to make af
fidavit when purchasing bags at San
Quentin, and for that reason I do r.ot
see how dealers get hold of the bags."
A. L. Bemmerly is another extensive
wheat grower of Yolo- County, who has
had some experience with Borach &
Levy in the purchase of grain bags.
Like some other farmers, he entered
into a contract with the Yolo mer
chants, his contract cajllng; for San
Quentin bags. In February. 1897, Mr.
Bemmerly contracted for 10,000 prison
bags for future delivery, at a price he
does not now remember, but is of the
opinion that it was over $5 per hun
dred, considerably more than the pris
on quotation, but that Included freight.
When Mr. Bemmerly called for his bugs
Borach & Levy were unable to deliver
10,000 of the prison make, and the or
der was filled with part Pan Quenttn
and part Calcuttas. Mr. Bemmerly was
positive that a portion erf the Backs
Were of prison make, but could
cot state Just how many. Afterward
he found it necessary to get more sacks
t<- hold all his grain, and he procured
some of Marshall Diggs, and at anoth
er time he got a small quantity from
Charles D. Simpson of Woodland. Mr.
Hemmerly is unable to say, though,
whether these last two- luts were prison
or Calcutta goods.
A. Abele owns 1 ."00 acres of farming:
land a few miles from VY odland, and
he Is one of the men who have pur
chased San Quentin bays from Mar
shall Dlggs. Mr. Abele expressed ft.
willingness to acknowledge his state
ment before a notary, but unfortunate
ly he is suffering from a stroke, of par
tial paralysis, his bands and arms be
ing rendered almost useless, and he was
unable to go before a notary or even to
i pen to attach his signature. His
statement was written in full in his
1. wrever, and he said it was
t in every respect. His statement
v. as ;is follows :
"January 2, ISM.
"I am a firmer owning 1500 acres and
more of land In YolÂ© County. In the
>ar 189(1 1 purchased from Marshall
Digga of Woodland nearly WOO
Quentin grain sacks, paying f"r them,
to the best of my knowledge, 5V6 cents
each, Including freight to Woodland. I
made no afltdavil and signed no docu
ment or paper, but paid cash for the
sacks upon receiving them. I have on
other occasions purchased San Quentin
â¢acks fp'in dealers, but do not remem
ber the exact dates or quantities
1m -mlit."
Walter MlUsap is a prosperous far
mer of Yolo County, his ranch being
situated about five miles from Wood
hind. His purchase of Pan Quentin
bags was limited to th" season of 189T,
and made from Boraco <Si Levy, At
first Mr. Millsap, while admitting that
be had heard much talk of the way
San Quentin bags were being sold by
outsiders, and that he had had some
experience himself, was loth to make a
statement because Of his friendship for
Mr. Borach, and was disinclined to say
anything that might get him into
trouble.
Mr. Borach, however, was not so ser
iously burdened with friendship for
Millsap at the time the contract was
entered into. On the contrary, al
though the price quoted at the prison
at the time was $." per hundred, Bor
ach charged his friend 15 80, and Mr.
Millsap is not certain but the price was
per hundred. He was Inclined to
the belief that It was the latter, but
to be on the safe side he placed the
figure at about $"â  f>" in his signe 1 state
ment. It was not until March 16 that
the prison directors advanced the price
to $."i 40. which rate has prevailed ever
since. Even at that figure, and paying
the freight to V Iâ¢, I rach would still
have found rich pickings in his friend.
D. B. Woods, a son-in-law of T. B.
Laugenour. tells more about the ex
tent of Marshall Diggs' dealings in
prison sacks. In 1897 Mr. Woods pur
chased from Digps v " "i bags, part, if
not all, of which were of prison make.
In 1886 he bought from the same dealer
11.000 bags, and part at least of these
were San Quentin bags. Mr. Woods
was of the opinion that both years he
bouerht more than the number given:
but he was not positive, no he took the
figures from Mr. I hosts' books. At no
time did he make any affidavit to the
State prison, but the bags were deliv
ered to him upon personal application
to Dlpps. showing that the dealer must
have had a big supply on hand.
C. P. Summers cultivates forty a^r^s
of land about two miles north of Yolo.
Mr. Summers also deals extei . Â»ly in
poultry, eggs and butter, and In <
quern o has close business relations
with Borach & Levy, and other
merchants in Yolo and adjacent coun
ties.
"If The Call's expose of this bag ring
brings about an investigation ami my
nony is wanted." said Mr. Sum
mers. "I shall be perfectly willing to
give it. That such a ring exists is pat
ent to every fanner in th^ county, and
it has been the subject of much com
ment among them.
"The way It is worked is very sim
: he added. "Every storekeeper, Hi
most, is supplied with quantities of the
warden's printed applications and affi
davits for prison bags. These are In
every respect Identical with those fur
nished by the Ban Quentin authorities
and must come from th â¢ prison.
"I know Borach A Levy had a quan
tity of such blanks during the past :-â¢ a-
S'Â«n, for I Baw th< in there. 1 went to
the store one day early in the season
to order sacks, and was asked how
many I wanted. At that time crops
were looking ex* eedingly slim and l re
plied that 500 were all I would â¢
Tfv- storekeeper told me to fill out an
application for 10,000 San <Â«>ueT:ti:i
saÂ«ks, pointing to a stack of affidavits,
but I refused to do so. A man to likely
to make a mistake of a few hundred
sacks when looking over his growing
(â !'. ;,s and estimating what they will
harvest, but nobody will make an esti
mate of 10,000 sacks for fony acres of
grain. The proposition was so palpa
bly crooked thai I would not consent
to become a party to it. and upon my
refusal, the storekeeper declined to
take my order, saying it was too rtnaJl
to bother with. loiter in the Reason,
however. I secured 700 San Cjuentin
bags, all 1 needed, from him.
"That is one way storekeepers obtain
their sacks." concluded Mr. Summers.
"They get farmers to make a requisi
tion for a much larger quantity than
they need, and keep the others to sell
to others. But there are other'methods
of obtaining prison hngs 1 think, for at
times the prices quoted by the dealers,
delivered in Yolo nr Woodland, are
about the same as the rate quoted at
the prison."

they can only muster tifly-slx votes, or

The Pc-st says: "Unable as yet to
command a sufficient number of votes
to secure the ratification of the Ha
waiian annexation treaty in the Senate,
the friends of the treaty have appealed
to the President to throw the weight
of his Influence into the scale in their
behalf. The appeal has not been made

is taken the influence of the adminis
tration will be exerted in undisguised
fashion in support of tne treaty. Pres

The announcement In the Post yester

and Gear had decided not to vote for
the treaty because the annexation of
Hawaii and the consequent develop
ment of â  large sugar-producing do
main would materially Interfere with
the beet sugar industry of Nebraska

treaty, and gent them In post haste to
the White House. Senator Klkins. who
is tlie representative of the administra

nectlon â with annexation, informed the
President early yesterday morning that
the reports of the defection of Senators
Thurston and (;c<ir were unfortunately
true, and he urged the President to use
every effort to bring them back into

"Tliis the President premised to do.

"Mr. Gear, however, took notes of

tions uttered. In the <â â¢;>â  n sessions,
which will be necessary when the Mor
gan lull Is taken up, the whole ground
of discussion will have to be tra
again, while the appropriation of M. -
000,000 to pay the debt of Hawaii will
also excite a lively controversy.
The Senate did not make great prog
ress with the Hawaiian annexation
treaty to-day. Several â  were
delivered, but ':> every Instance the
leer announced that to-day's re
marks â  rely preliminary to what
lie would say before the close of tl
bate.
The executive session opened shortly
after 1 o'clock, with Senator \vi
the floor, but Senator Stewart Inter
rupted, and others cut the California
Senator out of thÂ»- discussion. Those
who spoke were Senators Stewart, Frye
and Morgan.
Senator Stewart of Nevada supported
the treaty, and was the first Senator to
discuss th<Â» Question of sugar In con
nection with the subject. He said all
sugar lands were now occupied, and lit
tle was left saccept lands available f Â»r
the production of coffee. He asserted
that the Importation of sugar *to the
United States from Hawaii would not
be Increased to any perceptible extent
because the islands bad n a< h< d their
limit in the production of that article.
For this reason the producers of t I
sugar and can" sugar need not i>>->
alarmed. Senator Stewart eulogised
the natives as Intelligent and docile.
He said there were many of them In
California, and that they were well re
led there.
Senator White Interrupted to ask
why, if the Kanak re so wen
thought of, they had not been consult
ed on the question of annexation.
Mr. Stewart replied that throughout
their history. u\< to recent years, they
had beÂ» n anxious to have thoir country
te a part of the r:iitr<l Si;
Senator Frye spoke upon the < <>m
merctal and military aspects which an
nexation | : in favor (if the
United States. ll<- called attention to
the fact that some Senators complain
ed i"'< ;ius<- ii" oil" stayed in the cham
ber and listened to the debate upon this
important subject. II" remarked tint
it was no wonder Senators Bed to the
cloak rooms and committee rooms wh^n
long speeches were read which contain
ed much dry detail and were not argu
monts upon the question before the
Senate.
The Senators should counsel together
and discuss the matter, debate and ad
vise, and then there would be a full
Senate at all times and the information
sought would be brought out. On the
merits of the case he considered Hawaii
as necessary to the United States. He
devoted considerable time to the im
portance of the Nicaraguan canal,
which could not be maintained unless
Hawaii was ours. Senator Frye
thought this was an important epoch
| in our history and if we did not annex
the islands now we could not complain
if they were annexed to any other na
tion or if any other nation should take
them.
S.-r.afnrMorcran of Alabama made the
principal speech of the day and occu
pied the time of the H<nate until It ad
journed. He will continue to-morrow.
He began by referring to a suggestion
made by Senator Hoar that thÂ» Com
mittee on Foreign Relation! had made
no report and lie (Mr. Hoar) was with
out sufficient information concerning
the subject of Hawaii and annexation.
Senator Morgan then piled upon his
desk numerous printed volumes. In
cluding reports before various con
gressional committees, reports of the
officers of the Hawaiian Government
and other documents relating to Ha
waii.
"The Senator from Massachusetts,"
said Senator Morgan. "Is welcome to
these documents, and if he will give
them the attention which he usually
gives to public questions, he will have
all the information necessary on this
subject."
Senator Morgan then went into a de
tailed history of the Hawaiian Islands.
from the time of their discovery to the
present. He believed it was the inten
tion of President Cleveland to have re
stored Queen Liliuokalani to her throne
and after that transaction to have
opened negotiations for the annexation
of the islands under her regime.
This assertion brought Senator Chan
dler to his feet with the question as to
what authority there was for it.
Mr. Morgan replied thero> was no
special authority, but that he was ex
pressing his opinion and puck a course
would have been In keeping with the
logic of events.
Senator White asked if this treaty
were not a treaty with the Provisional
Government, and what was to be done
regarding the natives and their rights.
Senator Morgan said he had fully an
swered that question in a previous por
tion of his remarks, but he would re
view the subject for the benefit of the
California Senator. In the early part
of the present century, be sai.i, Van
eewe* went to the islands, and on hio
third trip th" then King of the islands.
a native, said he. would cede them to
Great Britain and acknowledged the
sovereignty of England. As to the oft- j
repeated asaertkto) that the United j
States was trying to absorb the Islands
without the wish of the Kanakas, Sen
nt Â«r Morgaa said that for the last hun
dred years the government of the isl
ands and the people of the islands were
anxious to secure the sovereignty of a
strong power and secure a local self
government.
Senator Morgan described at consid
erable length his visit to the islands
last summer and related his own per
sonal observations, and in reply to a
question explained why the Portuguese
could not vote. He then turned his at
tention to the Kanakas. He said that
th y were a picturesque people who
would be much belter off under a gov
ernment by the United States. He
sp >ke of the ladies going barefooted
along the streets In loose gowns, which
he called "Mother Hubbards." and the I
men with little slothing, nnd yet strong
and manly looking fellows.
Senator White asked Mr. Morgan
why the Islands were not annexed in !
IHS. and how it was that the proposal I
for annexation had tn wait until the :si
ands were in the possession of the land
grabbers who were trying to further
their personal fortunes. Senator Mor
gan said that if attention had been
given to his remarks on the subject of
annexation in ISI3 Senators would have
vi, lerstood what intervened. The his
tory of that time was in the document
ary evidence which had been printed
llscussed often before. He be
lleved th â >â¢ should have been annexed i
at that time, and believed they should
be annexed now, and the reasons which
existed then for annnexatlon had mul- :
tiplled a hundred times. What former I
authorities had refused to do was no !
excuse why the United States should!
refuse now. as it w:>s evident that an
nexation was best, both for thÂ«- people
[ of the islands and for this country.

son as to the k::. 1 of Pirate that has
captured this country," but all pirates
are not alike, and suavity and fii
are frequently more to be dreaded than
inhuman brutality.
Even a; : i Â«.. number of the annex.i
tionlsts are doubtful as to tba wisdom
of the policy of sending the President
on a lobbyists errand, while the na- j
lives nnd fu ti-: .nexatlonists are slm- '
ply Jubilant, foi to them It appears as
if the cause of annexation must be In

However, it makes the situation more !
interesting, and will add to its comic- ;
aiity in the event of Congress having
already decided the momentous ques- 'â 
tion of annexation contrary to the will i
of a people and practically against the i
spirit <.f a . institution that has hither- '
to held the world's esteem for Its hon
'â 'V â '' manliness of intent toward!
feeble nai lons.
The mosl the anti-ann^xationists ran
â ay t this Juncture is that if they are

The Coum ! nf State has appropriat
ed 110.000 for the Presidential tow of
, triumph. Their powers under th
stitution are "to appropriate public
moneys, when, during the time Inter
| ventng between the sessions of the
Legislature, the emergencies of war, in
;i. rebellion, pestilence or other
, great public necessity shall arise." The
unfortunate taxpayers desire to know
under which of the above heads they
are to be mulcted, for to the majority
of them it would seem only just and
appropriate that the expenses of a po
litical lobbying tour should be paid out
of thÂ»- funds of the Annexation Club
whose in- ml. -is will be the offea to
mostly benefit by annexation.
The President will be accompanied by
Port Physician Dr. F. It. Day as pri
vate mi dical adviser. Dr. Day has al
ready rendered invaluable services to
the republic in a tour of inspection in
the Orient in connection with the Board
of Health. He first became compe
tently prominent during the sad period
of th* cholera epidemic. Major Curtis
P. laukea of the I 'resident's personal
staff will also accompany him as aide

In spite of Minister Cooper's asser
tion to The fall correspondent in ref
erence t'> th.- Cabinet that "he never
had th" pleasure of being connected
with four gentlemen who were nmre
courteous or considerate to each other
than the members of Hawaii's Govern
ment," it is known as an indisputable
fact that Ministers Damon and Kins,
while not openly, by vole, 1n opposi
tion to the President's Journey, are tac
itly opposed to it; the former for finan
ci.il reasons, and the latter believing
I It to> be a grave error in policy.

The Annexation Club meets this aft

Hawaiian delegation to Washington
Will be considered, with the probable
result of one or two being sent on Sat

The Executive Council has granted
Clarence W. Afihford leave to return to
Hawaii, and it is bplleved that a gen
eral pardon will be extended on Janu

thot they take the oath of allegiance
to the republic. This most of them will
do, as after the example of the over
throwers of the monarchy political
oaths are merely matters of personal
convenience in Hawaii and no longer
conscience binders.
The Call correspondent is convinced
that it is most unjust to that lady
and most untrue for a few of the an
nexation leaders to suggest and still
more to maintain that the Princess
Kaiulani is in politics, and is aided in
her aspirations and ambitions by Eng
lish influence.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 13.â Friends of
Edwin K. Alsip, whose disappearance
caused a sensation in Sacramento busi
ness circles, still express confidence in
his integrity, and believe that his cred
itors will not be losers in the end.
George W. Locke, one of Alsip's bonds
men, said to-day:
"I have known Mr. Alsip a lons while
and have found him to* be a rustler and
have always believed him to be honest.
I think that it will yet be proved that
his downfall has been due to indiscre
tion rather than dishonesty.
"Why, just last week," continued Mr.
Locke, â¢"he drew a check in my favcr
for somewhere in the neighborhood of
$1700, in order to make a quarterly set
tlement of rents and interest. If he had
intended to defraud any one he surely
would not have done that. Of course, I
do not know what shape his affairs
may be in, but I am of the opinion that
he will have something left after his
debts aro all paid."
B. U. Steinman does not take such a
comforting view of the situation.
Mr. Steinman said that, so far as he
knew, the departure of Alsip would not
affect the loan associations with which
he was connected.
To-night's Bee published the follow
ing synopsis of .the records of Sacra
mento County which disclose the real
estate transactions of Mr. Alsip: Prop
erty in the city, assessed for
?v? v !."/<; a one-half interest in Oak
Park property, ' assessed for Jin,
500; a mortgage on two lots in Oiik
Park, assessed for $1660: the Anderson
tract near Walsh's Station, for $3200;
the Louisiana tract neai Oak Park, as-
SCBBCd for ?32. r Â»0; three l<4?i in South
Sacramento; assessed for $700: one l<.t
in Highland Park, assessed for $JSO;
total, $31,010.
Th.- books In the Recorder's office
show the following mortgages to be of
record: George W. Locke, on city
rty, $1731; Theodore Kenger. on
city property, 13500; is. U. Steinman,
on Oak Park property and Anderson
tract, 19500; California State Hank. <> n
Oak Pnik property. $13,650; Caroline
S-.vinnerton, on Oak Park property,
$8600; total, $36
This would sh"\v Alslp's property In
Sacramento County to have been mort
gaged for $5571 more than its assessed
value. Alsip holds an undivided one
third Interest in the business of the
Fair Oaks colonies, but the property is
assessed to Cox & Clarke. He may a Is..
be the owner of mortgages upon which
the mortgagor pays interest, and which
are not of recced in th>? Assessor's of
fice. Alsip owns property in Oakland,
known as the Kohler Block, which is
mortgaged to 13. U. Steinman for $25,
000. He owns property in Placer Coun
ty, whicfc is mortgaged to Steinman
for something like $8000.
AlÃip's downfall is accredited to the
scandal in which he figured and which
w;is exposed about a year ago, when
Alsip charged Edward 11. Morgan, a
San Francisco attorney, with black
mail. Alsip had paid large sums to
Morgan for Eugenic Florie Howel). the
woman with whom he has been admit
tedly intimate, and whose child he car
ed for. After he had been blackmail
ed out of thousands of dollars, it was
learned that the babe was that of an
other woman, which had been borrowed
by the conspirators.
Warm love is esteemed
by all good women.
Hut when you are ill,
weak, run down, you
do not feel like loving
any one or anything.
You are listless, and
y.'U walk about as
though life had for you
no pleasures and no
charms. Sleepless
nights, weak back, a
feeling of despairing
gloom and a sure
sense that you are only
a very small part of a '
man all help to make
you what you are.
You must seek help.
"Hudyan " will not only
help you â it will sure-
ly cure you. It has
put tire into no less
than 18,000 men in
America alone. It will
restore to you your fire,
your vigor and year
great big manliness.
You will ilnd charm in
life again, and your
fear that others know
your secret will have
vanished. Write and
ask about it. Testi-
monials and circulars
are as free as the air
you breathe, and so Is
the advice of the most
celebrated physicians
on this continent. If
you see copper colored
spots anywhere on
your body, if your
teeth are loose, if your
voice is husky, you may
feel certain that you
have some form of
blood poison. Whether
in Its tertiary, its sec-
ondary or its primary-
state it makes no dif-
ference. The "30-day
blood cure" will be cer-
tain to eradicate, to
clean it right out of
the system promptly
and permanently. Cir-
culars and testimonials
about this are as free
as are the others about
"Hudyan." Write or
call to-day.

Bpeclal rispatch to Thf Call.
L,OF ANGELES, Jan. 13.â There is
quite 'â  feeling abroad in this
unity thru the League for Better
City Government will not prosecute the
charges flled against School Director J.
H. Braly. The Board â¢â¢!" Education has
I that the l>-::tru.- conduct the
ution, but the genera] feeling is
th.it the league would by far prefer to
ily rather than prosecute him
f his high social Btanding. In
the prosecution the League for Cleaner
Government has thus far been repre
sented before the School Board by
Judge J. Noonan Phillips. The Judge
was isker 1 what position the organiza
tion he represented took with regard
to Director Braly. and h-' said:
"Director Braly lias been duly charg
ed with having violated the law. The
League for cleaner Government.
through me. as its representative, will
prosecute Mr. Braly just the same as
we would any other accused public
servant. And why should we not? We
have siid that we have nothing to r- ,\
c-r up in this School Board Investiga
tion, that we were going to probe it to
the bottom. Now lei us go ahead with
the probing. Mr. ISraly ought to- be
only too clad to be prosecuted, and
thereby Bet at rest th.-se rumors. If the
League for Better City Government de
cllnes to prosecute Mr. Braly, the
League for cleaner Government, which
I represent, will. We want no none
nor sickly sentiment in this business.
We must treat all j pie alike. That
is the only way we can do and do right
by everybody."
The announcement of Judge Phillips
will be in the nature of a 1 in. rang in
::n)i of Mr. Braly*s friends. Th< y
iy endeavor to head off
the Investigation.
Elder j. s. Pittman. ex-member of

tion of his position as janitor, ami who

turned from the East. He denies that
he left to escape further exposure in
connection with School Board crook
edness. He is after Professor Rohde,
a teacher in the public 5en...,:, who has
testified that h-- joined Plttman's
church at the time Pittman was a
\ member of the School Board in order
to get a position as teacher. Rohde has
t n called up before the church, and
an effort is >><-jng made to expel! him.
Pittman claims that he went East on
chur<-h husiness. When interviewed h
sail he had no further statement to
makf concerning th-- bribe money he
received from Janitor Cooper.
< mly one witness was examined be
| fore the Board of Education to-night
in defense of School Director Webb,
and this closed th> case f, ,<â  the de
fense, with the exception of one wit
ness â the self-confessed perjurer. J. F.
Adams, who was ordered subpenaed
; for to-morrow. The prosecution will
put in rebuttal testimony to-morrow.
Mrs. A. C. Gregory, a teacher who
was dropped from th^ list last June,
gave testimony showing how the Times
had distorted an Interview with her so
as to engender public fe.-nng against
Director Bartlett, who has stood by
Webb throughout this controversy. In
an interview published in th-- Time? of
December IT Mrs. Gregory had I n
mad" to say she had bought a piano
from Bartlett, which she returned be
cause she could not ?â <â 'â  her way dear
to pay for it and that she had lost h>-r
position because she had returned the
piano. On the stand to-night she de
clared that she had never stated to
the Times reporter who interviewed
her that she had lost her position be
1 cause o fthe return of the piano.
Mrs. Gregory created a stir for a rrm
ment when she admitted that she had
tried to â¢â â .lire her position for another
term by means of money.
"Whom did you try to buy?" asked
Attorney Meserve for the defense.
"I decline to answer," replied the wit
ness.
"To whom was the money to so?"
persisted the attorney.
"1 supposed it was to go to the
board."
None of the three papers which com
pos-- the journalistic combine of Los

handling of the School Board investiga
tion than the Express. So peculiar are
Its ideas that even the newsboys of I^os

sters and mostly attendants at the pub
lic schools, struck to-day. There are
about fifty of these lads. They met last
nipht. and to-day distribute. l the fol
lowing printed notice on the streets:
To the Public: We take this means of
informing you that we, the Newsboys'
Union of l,o S Anpeles. have declared a
strike against the Evening Express until
they agree to sell us papers at a price ;u
which we can make a llvinp by selling
them with other papers on the streets.
At present they ch.-irpre the newsboys :i
cents a copy, so we have to sell thÂ«-m at
r. cents to the public, whereas they sell
them over the counter at their office to
tlie public for 2 centsâ l cent less than
they sell them to newsboys which Is an
imposition on th" newsboys and the pub
lic Therefore we ask you to co-opernte
with us in righting this wronjj. Yours

TIIF. SAX FRANCISCO CAIX, FRIDAY, JANUARY 14, 1898.
THE BARKENTINE S. IN. CASTLE.
v a. la n tiubbard will go to sea in command of the Castle to-morrow on the one hundred and first voyage he has
made to Honolulu during the la^t thirty-tour years. He is still hate and hearty, and expects to make 150 voyages to
Hawaii before he retires from the sea.
A CENTURY OF
ROUND TRIPS
Captain Hubbard Has
Made Over a Hundred
Runs to Honolulu.
The Alameda Searched for an
Escaped Murderer From
Auckland.
Total Loss or the British Steamer
Fitzroy on the Australian
Coast.
Captain Hubbard of the barkentine
P. N. Castle has a most remark
record as a South Sea Island trader.
The vessel is scheduled to sail for Hon
olulu to-morrow and Captain Hubbard
will then start on his 101 st consecutive
run to that port. Masters of steamers
have made the same number <>t" runs,
but nobody approaches Captain Hub
bard's record. His first trip to Hawaii
was on the schooner Juventa in l^'.-l.
In those days Honolulu was not the
nourishing city it is now, and the
Kamehamehas sat on the throne of
their fathers. His m-xt command in
the Hawaiian trade was in the bark
Clara Sutel and later he was in the
barkentine Jane A. Falkenberg, thÂ»
bark Caribbean and now the barken
tine s. N. Castle. Up T" 1874 Captain
Hubbard was not constantly in the
island trade, but since that date his
â¢ very voyage off San Francisco has in
cluded Honolulu as a port of call. The
captain is still one of the balest ami
heartiest skippers in port and expects
â¢ bis If.i'th trip t<> the I'ara
dise of the Pacific before retiring.
The oceanic Steamship Company*!
Alameda arrived from Sydney via
Auckland, Apia and Honolulu yester
day. From the time she left Sydney
until San Francisco was reached noth
ing but strong head winds were en
countered. Before leaving Honolulu it
was thought that she would not get
here until to-day, but. good tune was
made and the splendid steamship made
port within an hour or bo of her regu
lar time. The passengers by th>- steam
tr say that President Dole of Hawaii
and Dr. Day, his physician, will be
passengers for San Francisco by the
Pern, scheduled to arrive here to-mor
row. <>n her arrival they will go to
Washington, 1). C, by special train.
According to the report on the Bteamer
President Dole's visit is entirely In the
Intel est of annexation.
E. Tweedle, a. prizefighter, was ;t
passenger by the Alameda. He tights
at 125 pounds and has come over here
to see if h<- can get a match. He Is ac
companied by his manager, Fowles.
Tweedle'* last light was v\ith Mik- >>!.â¢-
Cli-pff of London, whom he beat in a
round and ;i half before the Grosvenor
Sporting ciui> of Sydney. A lin.- can
thus be K r ot on Tweedie'a ability as Mc
<;>>tY easily defeated Jimmy Barry and
('ill IfcCarty. Fowles saya thai Tweedie
has only been bested once. On that oc
casion th>- decision was against him
on points, but that he afterward de
feated his conqueror In a most con
vincing manner.
The Alameda was boarded in the
stream by United Statt s Marshal Barry
Baldwin. lit- was acting under cable
instructions to arrest 1 >r. Arthur Hurl
bert, who was wanted iti Auckland. N.
Z., on a charge of murder. Hurlbert
is accused of performing a criminal
operation, from which his victim dud.
The Marshal did not get his man, how
ever, as the doctor left the steam. T- at
Honolulu. When the Alameda arrived
at Auckland a man boarded the
steamer and engaged a birth, saying
that the person who was going to use
it would not arrive until shortly before
th'- vessel sailed. An hour before sail
ing time Dr. Hurlbert put in an appear
ance and claimed the berth, which was
given him. On the way to Honolulu he
asked many questions about San Fran
cisco anil was very anxious to pet in
formation as to what questions he
wouki be obliged to answer upon his
nrrival here. The ans\v< rs given caused
the medico to change his mind, so he
KÂ«>t a stop-over ticket from the purs.-r
and went ayhore at Honolulu. When
Hurlbert boarded the steamer at Auck
land h<- wore a large Bowing beard, but
when he went ashore at Honolulu he
had shaved everything orr except a
small goatee, which made a wonderful
change in his appearance, in anticipa
tion of his coming on here by some
other steamer <>r by a sailing vessel,
every rraft that comes from the South
ern seas for some time to come will be
searched. The crime of which I>r. Hurl
bert Is charged is treated very differ
ently in Australia than it is here ami
the cham-.-s an- if in- is ever returned
to Auckland that he will share the fate
of Butler, and that his trial and exe
cution would not occupy any longer
time.
The Alanvda brinps th>- news of the
total loss <>f the Australian steamer
Fitzroy. She left Sydney for Brisbane
and Queensland ports with forty-five
passengers and a crew of thirty-five.
While making: her way alonp the roast,
without any warning she ran broadside
on to a sandy beach. For two hours
and a half the passengera and crew
clung to the yesÂ» I, many of them with
nothing more around th> m than a nicrht
dress and a blanket, waiting for day
light tn disclose th. ir whereabouts, and
bring an opportunity for rescue. No
lives were lost and the officers of the
Alameda say that from what they
heard of the wink that the fact that
all succeeded In getting ashore safely
was a circumstance little Bhort of the
miraculous. The vessel and cargo were
a total loss. The cause of the disaster
ha.l not '" â¢ n ascertained when the
da left Sy Iney.
T Vi -- fishermen are up to their old
tricks apain. Early yesterday morning
at leasi a thousand mud hens must
have been landed at Flshennens' wharf
In s.-u-ks. These birds were not shot
but were caught in a nÂ» j t and drown
ed. They are then hauled into the
boats the same as fish and are br
to mark. -l. Th â  buyers In every in
stance are Italians, who strip the birds
of their feathers, partly clean them,
and to-day will hawk them nil over the
city as teal, mallard or sprig. As thfÂ»
birds wore nev< r bled, and throuph b*>
inp confined in sacks became heated,
they would thus be a very distrusting.

Work of the Executive Com
mitteee and Outlines of the
Programmes.
Money Coming In More Rapidly and
All the Big Features Ar
ranged For.
Jubilee arrangements have progressed
as far as the minute details, an.', from
now until the preat day the commit
t â¢ will busy themselves with perfect
ing the plans already outlined.
A new factor has appeared in the
programme, and if it be successfully
carried out it will add not a little to
the entertainments of the week. The
plan is t" make Union square an lm
m>-nse flower market, where the bI"S
sonis which pmw at this time of the
year nowhere but in Fan Francisco can
be seen and admired and purchased if
the wish of the seekers for enjoyment
go so far.
Mr. Ooleman Is not prmvlinpr; he says
so himself, and the reason for his con
fession is that the money is mminp in
to his committee so fast that he has no
chanre to make moan over a depleted
treasury. If it continue as fast for a
week more he .says he will have enough
to relieve several of the minor commit
tees of the financial stringency of which
they have been so bitterly complaining.
s. K. Thornton of the committee on
publicity and promotion reported that
up !<> <lat" the committee had expend
ed $1920 60 outside of the press agents'
expenses, but it was cena:n the amount
over that sum would not be more than
$1000.
Mr. (Jrady. for the parade committee,
reported that fourteen bands- had been
arranged tor, and that before the work
Of the committee had been finished
; there would be twenty-two. He said
the parade would be four and a half
miles long and would include over 10,000
men and twenty floats.
It was decided to appoint a commit
tee of five from the Native Daughters
to judge the house and store decora
j tions displayed during the day of the
! celebration. The committee was al
lowed $I^o for expenses, and it will
award four prizes of 5100, $75, 550 and
$L"5. Another committee was created,
to be appointed by the president of the
Bohemian Club, to pass upon the floats
i in the parade and to award four prizes,
$Joo. $175. $75 and SSO.
The programme for the jubilee week
has been decided on as follows:
Monday morning at 10:30 o'clock, grand

THE RUNAWAY HORSE.
CONXKRXIXG the intelliger.ee of the
horse there has been some discussion, in
augurated, if memory serves as, when Job
had been by a siege of boils reduced to a state of
thoughtfulness. Job's opinion was that the horse
of that day was a vain thing for safety, and there
has been no notable improvement since. A horse
that scares at a piece of paper and runs away is not
an intellectual giant. Neither is the man who had
left that horse untied.
The assumption that an equine will be controlled
by what for some re;i>o:i never explained is known
as "horse sense" has nothing upon which to rest.
Occasionally the driver may be so blessed as to
possess a share of this, but the driven i? without it,
exceptions being so rare that they have escaped no
tice. Therefore the driver who leave? a horse un
hitched should be held responsible for any and all
damage done by the animal while engaged in run
ning away. The horse is not to blame. He is as
created and trained. That he should know more
than his master is not a reasonable expectation.
Yet when he is left in the noisy street untethered
and fails to run away and smash things he clearly
proves that he does know more than his master.
As he knows so little, else could not be a horse, a
natural conclusion is that the master mu^t be pain
fully short on gray matter.
A FOOLISH BOODLER.
THE Mission street organ of Colonel Mazuma,
in a burst of confidence which is truly astonish
ing, says it is perfectly willing to submit all its
charter "cinches" to the people as alternate proposi
tions. This confirms what we suggested a lew days
ago, namely, that the Boodler thinks the election
held on December 27 last was carried by Colonel
Mazuma, and that a majority of the people voting
thereat declared in favor of restoring it to the pay
roll of the Southern Pacific Railroad monopoly.
In our judgment, however, the Boodler is ex
ceedingly foolish to submit its "cinches'* as alternate
propositions. It may be mistaken as to the verdict
of the Freeholder election. The people are some
times absent minded in expressing themselves at the
ballot boxes, and it is barely possible that they did
not have that $30,000 "advertising"' contract in mind
at all. They may have voted the Citizens' Commit
tee ticket for the purpose of getting a chance to
smash another Lord Mayor charter. They may
have voted it for fun, just as they used to vote for
Dr. O'Donnell, or they may have voted it for any
one of a thousand other reasons entirely discon
nected with the interests of the Boodler.
However this may be, it is certain that if the
Boodler permits the Freeholders to ei:bmit its
"cinches" as alternate propositions it may as well re
linquish all idea of getting another "advertising" con
tract out of the Southern Pacific. Not only will sev
eral alternate propositions give the corporations, the 1
bosses and the "push" a chance to trade for votes,
but by concentrating on any one or more of the ar
ticles so separately submitted either one or all of
these malign influences can "plump" the "cinches"
out. The Boodler can never, for instance, hope to
carry its scheme for forfeiting the franchises of the
Market Street Railway Company by any such sys
tem. The amount the company might be called
upon to pay on an "advertising" contract, if expended
at the polls, would easily defeat that proposition. " '
When we suggested the alternate plan we assumed,
of course, that the Boodler would at once oppose it.
We are, therefore, amazed at the confident air with
which it accepts the issue. We can account for its
attitude on only one of two theories. Either the re
sponsible editor is out of town and the printer's
devil is in charge of the editorial page, or the
Boodler is coming down with softening of the brain.
The country journalists of ye olden time used to ex
plain their errors of utterance on the former basis.
Certainly, the Boodler can never expect to regain
its old place on the Southern Pacific payroll by sub
mitting its '"cinches" as alternate propositions. The
corporations would ask nothing softer than that.
Can it be possible that the organ of Colonel Mazuma
is losing its mind? If the responsible editor is in
town and the devil is not in charge it would seem to
look that way.
People will be slow to believe that the terrible
murders recently committed near Boston were
done by Dunham, the Californian who made
so fearful a record at San Jose. There Is no doubt
that Dunham would, if living, be capable of any
deed of horrid cruelty, but the belief that his bones
bleach somewhere in the foothills is a comfort
which there is no desire to relinquish.
While Mr. Philhrook is in the business of suing
several distinguished gentlemen it is a wonder he
named so small a sum as half a million when a
whole million would have been so much more im
pressive. Possibly, however, Mr. Philbrook thinks
the former amount all he can conveniently handle.
Some people have no desire to be embarrassed with
riches.
IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION.
NOW that the bill for the restriction of immigra
tion has been brought before Congress by the
speech of Senator Fairchild, it is to be hoped
the measure will be taken up in earnest and pressed
to a prompt enactment. It should not be made to
wait on any other question whatever. The need of it
is urgent, and there is no reason why there should be
any delay.
The Republican party and the administration are
pledged to the passage of some measure of the kind.
The St. Louis platform declares: For the protection
of the equality of our American citizenship and of the
wages of our workingmen against the fatal competi
tion of low priced labor, we demand that the immi
gration laws be thoroughly enforced, and so ex
tended as to exclude from entrance to the United
States those who can neither read nor write."
In his letter of acceptance President McKinley
said: "The declaration of the platform touching im
migration is one of peculiar importance at this time,
when our own laboring people are in such great distress.
1 am in hearty sympathy with the present legislation
restraining foreign immigration, and favor such ex
tension of the laws as will secure the United States
from invasion by the debased and criminal classes of
the Old World."
It will be noted there is a slight difference between
the language used by the President and that of the
platform. The one proposes to exclude criminal
classes and the other demands the exclusion of those.
who can neither read nor write. The difference is
hardly more than one of words. As a rule the crim
inal element among the foreign immigrants is coin
cident with the illiterate element. At any rate the
foreigner who can neither read nor write is hardly
fitted to become a citizen of the United States and as
it is not possible to devise a means by which t"
to mine criminal potencies among Immigrants the
educational test called for by the platform is perhaps
tlie best that can be effectively applied in practice.
President Winston of the University of Texas
pointed out at the recent "Prison Congress" that the
foieign element in the country is one and a half time
as criminal as the native white element, and that half
the foreign criminals are not naturalized. He strongly
advocated closing the country to illiterate immigrants
of all kinds, and said it would be economy on bar
part to shut them out even if we had to donate $.25.
000.000 annually to support them in their own coun
tries.
It is well known that the character of the immi
gration to the United States has undergone a notable
change in recent years. Formerly our immigrants
came from the British Islands or from Northern and
Western Europe. Their civili7ation was virtually the
same as our own and they were easily assimilated
with the native population. Of late years there has
been a rapid increase of immigration from Southern
and Eastern Europe, and the great majority of the
new comers are too alien to us to understand either
our government or our social life. Most of them are
illiterates and would be excluded by an educational
test as advocated by Senator Fairchild.
With reviving prosperity there will be an increased
incentive to such immigrants to cume to the United
StateÂ«, and therefore the expediency of closing the
doors at once is too apparent to need argument.
THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL SCANDAL.
' IZ^ ACH successive development in the Los An
geles school scandal makes more evident the
'â * need of a far reaching, penetrating and thor
oughly comprehensive investigation of the whole
subject. At the present time the charges and counter
charges i:iade by the opposing parties to the con
troversy are so equally balanced as to render decisive
judgment impossible. It will probably require an ex
amination in court, with testimony given under the
solemnity of oath and subject to rigid cross examin
ation, to make clear the facts involved in the present
confusion.
All that is quite certain is that much in the way of
evil and forbidden practices has been going on in the
management of the public schools of Los Angeles.
The League fur Better City Government is entitled
to the credit of having brought these practices to
public notice and started the movement to expose
them and punish the authors. The exposure, how
ever, seems to have gone further than the league in
tended, or at least to have disclosed wrongdoing in
quarters wholly unexpected. As a result some of the
members of the league have turned aside from the
object originally aimed at and are now acting more
like partisans in the contest than impartial investi
gators seeking the truth and desirous only to acquit
the innocent, but let no guilty man escape.
The Call from the first has taken a keen interest in
the investigation. Malfeasance or misfeasance in the
public schools aft'ects one of the most important fea
tures of our social organism. Corruption in our edu
cational system is a thing not to be tolerated in any
part of the State. Public sentiment, so prone to
indifference in matters of local administration, is re
solved on that point. The Call was therefore acting
in strict accord with popular ideas of the duty of the
press to the people when it set about aiding the in
vestigation at Los Angeles and making known every
particle of the evidence given on either side, whether
for attack or defense.
To angry disputants the impartial man seems an
enemy to both. The attitude of The Call in the
course of the Los Angeles investigation has exposed
it to that form of misrepresentation. Because it pub
lished in full the charges of the league and the evi
dence given by Axtell and Adams it was called an
enemy of Trustee Webb. Because it permitted Mr.
Webb to defend himself and published a statement of
his side of the case in a letter written and signed by
himself it is accused of being an enemy of the league.
This misconstruction was not unexpected. He that
t.-ikes part in a hard fight must expect blows. The
Call is fighting for the truth and for the punishment
of any person proven guilty of wrongdoing. In that
fight it is regardless of men, parties or factions. It
hews to the line, letting the chips fall where they
may. Its object is to publish nothing but the truth,
but also to publish the whole truth, and the only way
by which that can be accomplished is the publication
of the testimony on both sides.
Citizens of Los Angeles who wish to learn both
sides of the controversy in order that they may judge
it fairly must read The Call, as it is the only paper
in the State now pushing this investigation with no
other object than that of exposing guilty parties and
showing the people the evidence that convicts them.
As Minister to China Conger will have more to
do with protecting the rights of Americans than
ever fell to his lot in Brazil, and in the latter place
he never did it particularly well. Perhaps, however,
if the occasion is large he will rise to it.
There will be a pretty fight between ex-Senator
Hill and the Tiger. When it is over Hill may show
the marks of claws, but the chances are that the
Tiger's scalp won't be on straight either.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JA2STTTABY 14, 1898.
UMTII a view to fairly stating the plan for re
' form of our financial and banking system, re
ported by the volunteer monetary commis
sion, we have presented the parts covering the stand
ard of value, the silver currency and the demand ob
ligations of the treasury. Under the latter head it
will be seen that the proposed treasury division of
is.me and redemption will:
(a) Pay out gold coin for gold certificates.
(b) Pay out gold coin in redemption of green
backs and the notes of 1890.
(c) Pay out silver dollars for silver certificates of
any denomination.
(d) Issue silver certificates of denominations of $1,
$2 and $5 in exchange for silver dollars and for silver
certificates of denominations above $5
(c) Pay out gold coin in exchange for silver dol
lars.
(f) Pay out silver dollars in exchange for gold,
greenbacks or notes of 1890.
(g) Pay out greenbacks or notes of 1890, not sub
ject to immediate cancellation, in exchange for gold
coin.
(h) Pay out and redeem subsidiary and minor
coins as now provided by law.
(i) Pay out United States notes in exchange for
currency certificates.
In the national banking system proposed no bank
shall issue notes in excess of its paid-up and unim
paired capital, exclusive of its real estate. All such
notes are a first Hen upon all assets of the bank, in
cluding its stockholders" liability. No such notes
shall be in denominations of less than $10.
Ip to an amount of 25 per cent of the capital
stock of the bank, unimpaired, the notes issued by it
.-hall not exceed the value of United States bonds de
posited in the treasury. Five years after passage of
the act the amount of United States bonds to be de
posited against notes issued shall be reduced each
.car by one-fifth of the 25 per cent of capital, and
thereafter any bank may at any time withdraw any
bonds deposited in e\cc>> of the requirement.
Any bank may deposit any lawful money with the
treasury for retirement of its notes, and every such
deposit shall be treated as a reduction, to that ex
tent, of its outstanding notes.
Other provisions relate to taxation of national
banks and improvements in their supervision, and
for a change of banks now in commission to the new
â  in.
In brief, the intention of the commission's plan is
â â > secure a system with these features:
i. To be national, with better national oversight.
_'. Its note issues to be based upon readily converti
ble bank assets.
.?. A limitation of the amount of note issues to the
unimpaired capital of the issuing bank.
4. A further security in a common guaranty fund.
in which all the banks in the system guarantee the
notes of any one bank, securing the same confidence
and uniformity in value for the notes as now.
5. Continuance of the present redemption fund and
method of redemption, as now, with increase in plans
of redemption.
6. A further security in the liability of the share
holders to the full par of their shares.
7. And a system whose continuance will not de
pend upon a permanent national debt with United
States bonds as its basis.
Bankers who see the bill in deta 1 will observe that
the last is the chief difference be: veen the proposed
-ystem and the present. Indeed the whole plan sub
mitted is evidently formed so as to produce as gradual
a change to sounder and more desirable methods as
possible and with the minimum of disturbance to the
country's finance and business.
The Monetary Conference is called to reassemble
at Indianapolis <m the 25th of this month, and all
commercial and financial organizations are invited to
-end delegates thereto.
It is expected that the con mission's plan will be
freely discussed and explained at this meeting, and
no doubt great interest in the whole question will be
stimulated.
THE SOUTH AND THE FAIR.
S~^ ( >MMENTING upon a recent statement of the
I Citrograph that "San Francisco does not to
v-^v-^ day recognize South California as a gold or
silver producing region," tin San Bernardino Sun
agrees with The Call that it such be the case it is
time the people of that section enlightened the ignor
ance of the metropolis.
The Sun very cogently says: "It may be that San
Francisco capitalist* have been told of the 'prospects"
with which the Imperial County, as well as half a
dozen other counties, arc blessed and have refused to
believe it. But if an actual exhibit of ores were made
they might be convinced. Seeing is believing, and
a few pieces of glittering quartz would accomplish
more tb*n could >Â»c done by talk in a thousand
years."
After such a forcible presentation of the advantages
sure to accrue to the "Imperial County" and to the
south generally from a good exhibit at the mining
exposition in this city, it is to be regretted the Sun
felt it necessary to add: "Hero is where we again feel
the need of some organization at the county scat
which would take the matter in hand and see that a
creditable display is made. But we have no such or
ganization. No display will he made, and San Fran
cisco will probably go on believing that South Cali
fornia mines are largely 'talk.' "
The mere lack of an organization at the county
seat should not prevent an adequate representation
of the mineral wealth of so rich a county as San Ber
nardino at an exposition of such opportune impor
tance as that which is to be held in San Francisco
this winter. The men who are interested in mines
and mining should get together and arrange some
kind of exhibition to attract attention to the mineral
resources of their section. The fair is not to be a
holiday frolic. It means business.
The men of South California are noted for their
enterprise and their energy. If their section is not
well and brilliantly represented at the exposition the
visitors from the East will attribute the fact to a lack
of mineral resources from which to make exhibits.
Thus the south will suffer not only negatively, but
positively, if anything prevents it from taking a con
spicuous part in an exposition of the mining indus
tries and interests of the whole Pacific Coast.
The issue cannot be ignored. If there is no or
ganization at the county seat of San Bernardino to
prepare the exhibit then the progressive men out
side should get to work an! show what the "Im
perial County" possesses in the way of gold, silver
and other minerals. A
Senator Cannon's proposition to have a ducking
stool provided for statesmen will strike people who
are not statesmen as being excellent. In reading
the Congressional Record the average citizen has
often found himself wondering how so many old
scolds ever got together.

the name of Stanford in California. Mr.
Jones has been a leader in the politics
of his State, going twice to Congress
from there and being five times the chair
man of the State delegation to the na

one of the conventions being the one that
nominated Horace Greeley for the Presi

ness connected with his extensive affairs,
and has just arrived in the city on his
way from Seattle to Los Angeles. Speak
ing of the outlook for Klondike travel in
the spring, Mr. Jones said: "I thought
there was some excitement in the East
over the Alaskan mining boom, but 1 had
to reach Seattle to really comprehend
the passion for gold that has taken hold
of the people. 1 never saw anything like
It. The streets are crowded with all
sorts and conditions of humanity, and
the only thought that seems to possess
the entire assemblage is the wealth to be
had in the north. You of this city may
think you are doing some Klondike busi
ness, but things are dull here when com
pared with the way things are running
up there. All the outfitting stores
are doing a land office business, and the
man who cannot discuss plans for getting
away in the spring Is an Individual not
worthy of consideration."

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
REPTILES IN IRELAND--];. E. C.
City. Reptiles are not Indigenous to
Ireland, yet there is nothing in the soil or
climate to prevent them from living in
that country. In 1831 six snakes of a
harmless species were Introduced In the
County Down, being turned out in the
garden of the Rath Gail House. One of
these was killed u,t Mi!j<r.>ss after being
at liberty one week, two m.>r.> were killed
Within six weeks, but the other two were
not traced, although a reward was of
fered for them. In 1843, according to the
Dublin Penny Post, another experiment
was made with snakes in that country
and they thrived. This shows that the
assertion that "reptiles cannot live in Ire
land twenty-four hours" is not correct.

to him by Governor Budd. The Call was
first to suggest his appointment, believ

the office In a. manner highly acceptable
to the public. The chief reason given
by Mr. Pond for declining to serve is his
retirement from politics. â¢ Speaking of
the topic yesterday he said:
"I declined to accept the place because
I am our of politics entirely, and again
I have not the time to attend to the du
ties of the office. This institution, the
Pan Francisco Savings Union, of which
I am president, requires my time and at
tention. I am also engaged in other busi
ness affairs, so my time is constantly oc
cupied. The office of Railroad Commis
sioner is one that demands attention. A
man accepting the place should give his
whole time to the performance of his
official duties."

Services at the Greek
Church in Honor of
New Year.
Bishop Nicholoson Says Mass
Assisted by Priests of the
Faith.
Special Service to Commemorate
the Anniversary of
St. Basil.
Amid the chiming of bells and the
chanting of a Te Deum, the New Tear
was sacredly ushered into the calendar
of the Greek Catholic Church yester
day morning at the Cathedral on Pow
ell street.
The ceremony from commencement to
end was one of impressiveness; and to
the Btranger, unacquainted with the
rites of this church, most interesting.
Immediately upon the cessation of
the bells the golden gates leading from
the inner sanctuary were thrown open
as if by magic, and a monk, robed in
the black (lowing garments of hi.-* or
der, issued forth, followed by a small
procession of priests and lesser digni
taries of the church.
Upon leavin? the sanctuary he
marched through the church, where,
save the sound of his own prayers, ev
erything was hushed in silence, to a
sacred portal leading from the church
to the Inner sanctuary of Bishcrp Nich
oloson.
Upon coming in sight of the bishop
standing at the door with the upraised
emblem of Christianity in his hand the
entire congregation immediately bowed,
made the sign of the cross, chanting as
they did bo a hymn of praise.
The Bishop, upon entering thechurch,
went directly to the sacred gates lead
ing to the sanctuary; and, alter offer
ing up a brief prayer, repaired to his
throne in the center of the church,
where he was assisted in donning his
vestments by the assistant priest, pre
paratory to saying the mass.
The celebration of mass in the Orien
tal Church, although it differs consid
erably from the Roman Catholic, is
nevertheless impressive and inspiring.
The vestments used by the Bishop in
yesterday's ceremony were similar to>
those used in the Romish Church, with
the exception that the cross was not
worn on both sides of the vestment
used by the celebrant of the mass, as i.s
the case with the Roman priest when
he says mass.
In addition to the celebration of mass
in honor of the new year, special serv
ices were held t<j commemorate the
circumcision of Christ and also the an
niversary of the feast day of Ft. Basil.
Members of the church, without ex
ception, contributed money toward the
purchase of wax candles, to be burned
in front of the statues of Christ and St.
Basil, In memory of the Savior, and to
commemorate the anniversary of the
saint.
All through the sacred observance of
mass the choir chanted religious hymns
and answered the monotonous chant of
the Bishop. .
The ceremony of blessing the sacred
mass bcrok and other religious articles
on the altar is almost identical with
that of the Roman Catholic Church,
the only difference being that the Cath
olic prifst never goes beyond the steps
of the altar with the consecrated book,
while in the Greek ceremony the book
Is tak^ii from its position o-n the altar
and is carried to th" Bishop's throne In
the center of the church to be conse
crated.
All through the long service the
members of the congregation are com
pelled to stand, never changing their
attitude but twice, and then at the ele
vation of the host they kneel.
The moat impressive part of yester
day's services was the confession of a
young man, who knelt before the priest
and offered up his prayers to God ask
ing for forgiveness, and receiving the
body and blood of Christ in holy com
munion.
After th*? celebration of mass the spe
cial observance was held in honor of
the circumcision. It was a brief cere
mony, and consisted in kissing the sa
cred image of Our Lord affixed to a
brazen cross and also th" receiving of
the consecrated bread by the entire
congregation. It was an impressive
spectacle to see the members of the
church marching in single file to the
altar and receiving the desired privi
lege of kissing the effigy of their Bay

The Interior of the church presented
a maze of lights, wMeh afforded a most
diizzling spectacle to the eye.
In the center of the church and di
rectly above the Bishop's throne was a
magnificent silver-plated hanging can
delabrum, studded with myriads of wax
candles, presenting a most beautiful
sight.
In the front of the church and Just
inside the entrance to it was a similar
blaze of light from another hanging
candelabrum.

separate the main church from the
sanctuary are a number of paintings
representing the earliest saints of the
church.
In front of each of these pictures was
placed a hanging lamp filled with oil
and burned by means of a rash-light
wick. In addition to this lamp three
candles were placed in front of each
picture by public donation to commem
orate the saint it represented.
The music rendered by the choir was
better than is usually heard In church
es, and the sopranos and the bassos
showed off to especial advantage.
After the services in the church
Bishop Nicholoson retired to the priest's
house, where he received and enter
tained a number of guests at tea.

CAPTURE OF A
DESPERATE MAN
Brought to Town by a Brave
Posse of Four Constables
From Marin.
i Tho Authorities Did Not Wont Him
Because Confederate Notes Are
Not Counterfeit.
A Constable from Novato, Maria
County, with three stalwart assistants,
brought a prisoner into the office of the
United States District Attorney yester
day and caused great excitement among
the bystanders. The prisoner was a lit
tle man, skinny, but with a very bad eye,
and there was no doubt at all In the
mind of Deputy Attorney Schlesinger
that he must be a desperate train robber
and murderer. The strong guard and the
tact that the prisoner was handcuffed so
tightly that his wrists were bruised and
bleeding confirmed this suspicion.
"We've got a prisoner here," said the
Constable, with an air of great import
ance.
"I see you have," said Mr. Seliles-
Inger, "but don't you think it would be
well to loosen up those handcuffs a
little?"
This was done, and the officer wiping
the perspiration off his brow, announced
that be hud captured a daring and dan
gerous counterfeiter In the town of No
vato.
"What's he been doing?"
"He's been trying to pass a $1 Confed
erate bill, and hero's the evidence." ami
the officer waved the bill in the air.
Gently, but firmly, Mr. Bchlesinger in
formed the- Novato officer that the act
was not an offense against any United
Suites law, and suggested that ho take
the prisoner before some Justice of the
Peace at Novato and charge him with
fraud.
The posse went out with their little
man crestfallen and got on a Sansume
srreet horse car to go to the ferry, and
the prisoner jumped off the car and rmule
a dash for liberty. The four officers fol
lowed In hot pursuit, shouting like In
dians on the war path, and the unfortu
nate little man. who did not weigh more
than 120 pounds, was caught by a San
Francisco policeman and handed" over to
the Blt-uths from Marln.

TROUBLES IN
SHAIN'S HOME
Divorce Action on Trial
in Judge Daingerfield's
Court
Story of an Unhappy Married
Life Told on the Stand by
the Plaintiff.
Defendant Al^o Ha? an Inning and
Adds Much to the Distressing
Tale of Woe.
The suit of Grace F. Bhaln against
her husband, Joseph E. Sham, a collec
tor, for divorce promises to be a bit
terly contested one, and to allow the
family skeleton to stalk out before the
eyes of the world that it may gossip
and wonder. The action commenced be
fore Judge Daingerfleld Wednesday
morning and the plaintiff commenced
to build up her case. Mrs. Sham was
first called to the stand and told the
story of her sufferings and reasons for
charging her husband with cruelty and
Intemperance in her application for
divorce.
She testified that some time prior to
her application for divorce she had
been practically without funds with
which t<> k.ep herself and children. As
"the wolf*' Â« 'ft iines threatened to come
In at the door through necessity she dis
posed of most of her personal property.
Her baby's little bed was first to be
sacrificed when she was in need of
money and then when that had gone
the rich and pretty clothea she pur
chase d for it had to b Bold and coarser
used Instead. T. ;s piece bj â¢
the furniture of the h m was disp
of until the only furm: ,r- that remain
ed was in her husband room, and that
belonged to an outside party.
Another interesting Incident in the
unhappy married life occurred early
one morning when Mrs. Sham, accord
ing to her testimony, returned to her
home, from which she had fled the
night before In fear to a friend's hous<\
and found her piano on the sidewalk
and a couple of men ready to cart it
to a warehouse. In the distance she
Bald sin- saw her husband disappear
over a hill and know that he had made
an effort to get the piano, Mrs. Sham,
after assuring the men that she wanted
no trouble, drew a revolver from within
her cape as a means of assuring th*>m
that such was the case, i n ! then paid
them double th<- price offered by hr-r
husband to move the instrument to a
neighbor's house.
The piano movers Immediately com
plied with her request and Mrs. Rhain
was the Victor and her husband again
outwitted. A servant Kir!, at one time
employed in the home of the Shams,
testified that she had seen the head of
the family in an Intoxicated condition,
but how often she did not remember!
She had also expostulated with him in
fÂ«>ar that he would strike his wife, but
as to whether or not he ever did the
girl was unable to state.
Yesterday afternoon when the case
was continued the oldest daughter of
the litigant* was called to the stand.
Phe told in an unwavering manner the
story of her parents' troubles. Her
father, she said, was in the habit of
nightly sleeping with a revolver under
his pillow, much to the discomfort of
his family. Many times, th^ witness
said, in the still watches of the night
her father would come into her room,
kneel down beside her bed and cry
and monn in anguish. On being ques
tion, -d th^ young woman said that her
father complained that nobody loved
him and that he was greatly grieved.
Tin other occasions her father would
come into her room and lie down be
side her on the bed and moan until
sleep closed his eyes. "When my fa
ther used to lie down beside me his
touch would make me shudder." said
the witness. "He knew that I did not
like to have him near me on the bed,
but still he came." Miss Shn!n then
t"M the court as to how her father
used to whip her younger sister when
she was very young and that he was
oft times Intoxicated, a condition
which failed in a material degree to
augment the happiness of those about
him.
After the daughter had concluded her
testimony Sham. the defendant, had
an Inning on the stand and explained
his troubles on the angry sea of matri
mony. Outside the articles Mrs. Shaln
testified as to having sold In order to
maintain herself and children she dis
posed of several more according to the
statements of her husband. The de
fendant said that an elegant water
proof coat went the way of several
other of hi* possessions. His wife ob
tained $10 for the coat, he said, and it
was easily worth five or six times that
amount, but that fact mattered but lit
tle to her. N The next thine: he missed
was his dress suit and then discourage
ment came to him. Regarding the
statement made on the stand that he
had returned to his home with a bro
ken nose one evening he denied It, but
admitted that fourteen years prior to
meeting: his wife he sustained a fract
ure of his nasal organ. Regarding al
leged caperlngs on the sidewalk In a
nude condition Shaln made positive de
nial. He had never left his home a
la Adam, and the statements that he
had were false. He will probably tell
more of the story of his home experi
ences when the case Is continued,
which will probably be next Tuesday.

ROBBED BY
LIGHT OF DAY
Collector Knocked Down
Yesterday After
noon.
Was Relieved of # Fifty Dollars
by Unknown Assail
ants.
He Whs Making His Regular Rounds
for the Filmer - Rollins
Company.
Joseph Morris, collector for Filmer,
Rollins & Co., electrotypers, claims ho
; was attacked by two men on Washing
ton street, near Sansume, about 4
; o'clock yesterday afternoon, who, after
; dragging him Into a doorway, robbed
him of $50. Before robbing him, he
says, one of them struck him over the
! head with an Iron bar, cutting a deep
I gash.
According to the story told by Morris,
he was walking along Washington
| street, and when a few doors below
' Sansome he was seized by his assail
! ants, one of whom grabbed him by the
| throat. After threatening to strangle
| him if he made an outcry, he was then
thrown into the doorway of an empty
â  house and robbed of his money. Morris
I was subsequently taken to the Receiv
| ing Hospital, where the wound in his
head was dressed by Dr. Conrad Weil.
As soon as the alleged robbery was
reported to Chief Lees. Detectives Gib
son and Wren were detailed to make
an Investigation. They closely ques
tioned Morris, but he was unable to
give the faintest clew which would lead
to the identity of the robbers.
He declared that he did not see the
men, as they attacked him from be
hind, and after carrying him into the
doorway they at once struck him over
the head, the force of the blow ren
dering him senseless. When he re
gained consciousness a few minutes
later the alleged robbers were gone.
The detectives ridicule the story of the
robbery. They believe that Morris en
gaged in some saloon row and was
beaten.
When seen last night George Filmer,
secretary of the company, said: "We
have not seen Morris since the robbery.
He has been with this firm for many
y-ais and has always been a reliable
man. or we would not have entrusted
him with tho collection of bills due us.
Word came to us from Gates' drug
store that Morris had been carried
there In an unconscious condition, but
when we went there he had Been car
ried to the Receiving Hospital."
"THE BLACKSMITH."
Delorme's $50,000 Parting a
Alasterpiece of Modern
Art.
The fiction of the reality in Delorme's
wonderful painting, "The Blacksmith,"
now <>n exhibition in the art room of
the Emporium, is almost magical. As
you stand in front of the canvas it is
harder to imagine the reality than the
fiction. In a dusky, musty, rusty old
shop, with the sunlight streaming in
on his back and the charcoal fire (lam
ing in his face, there stands the bare
armed, muscular forger, pulling the
bellows rope and holding his pinchers
ready to remove the iron in the coals;
and the sparks fly out. He is a living
figure â the flames, the sparks, are
burning fire, and the sunshine is warm
and alive. You see three qualities of
sunlight. Through a dusty, cobwebbed
window at his back it streams lavishly,
but with subdued fervor. From some
where else, in the roof, perhaps, there
Is more mellow, diffused radiance. But
from under the door, through the
slightest unevenness, comes springing
one ray of joyous, boisterous, vivid
light, hampered by nothing. You gaze
at this picture and are in the shop, in
the dust, treading the rusty iron refuse,
feeling the fire heat, heading the surge
of the bellows and roar oi the fire. Ah,
it is marvelous. Why, even the old an
vil has its stains and its wounds â its
readiness to sing and its song.-!
BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL.
It Objects to the Threatened
Decrease in Wages at the
Mir)t.
The $40,000 reduction in the appropria
tion for the maintenance of the San
Francisco Mint, and the consequent
threatened reduction of 20 to 30 per cent
in the wages of the employes, has cre
ated considerable discussion, particularly
In labor circles, and at last night's meet
ing of the Building Trades Council the
matter was brought up for consideration.
The members wore one and all of the
opinion that a reduction of the wages
of the working man in one bram-h of
business means corresponding decn IM
in the amount of money he will spend
during the month, and a proportionate
falling off In other lines of business de
pendent upon his support.
A committee was appointed to con
sider the matter and introduced the fol
lowing resolutions, which were unani
mously adopted:
Whereas, It has been brought to the
knowledge of the Building Trades Coun
cil of San Francisco that the FVderal
Government is contemplating a reduc
tion of the wages of the men who do the
actual work and are the poorest paid in
the United States Mint located in San
Francisco, therefore ba it
Resolved, That we, the Building Trades
Council, in regular meeting assembled, do
hereby vigorously protest against the
Government's reducing the wages of the
above-mentioned employes, and ilo earn
estly request our representatives in
Washington to use their influence
against such reduction.
A committee consisting of J. Rose, W.
Page, M. C. Hencken and C. J. Cross
ley were appointed to draw up a petition
requesting Governor Budd to use his ex
. cutive clemency in the case of Salter D.
Wordi-n. who is condemned to die for
wrecking a train in the railroad strike
The committee which was appointed
two weeks ago to wait on the Harbor
Commissioners and urge that body to see
that nothing but California products be
used In the furnishing of the new ferry
depot reported that the Harbor Com
missioners had treated them with great
courtesy, but the interview was useless,
as the two important contracts in ques
tion had already been let to local firms
who employ union men.
STILL UNSATISFIED.
Mrs. O'Keefe's Children Still in
Doubt as to Their .Mother's
Whereabouts.
The O'Keefe case is still worrying Oak
land society. Some say that if the mother
Is living she would tend her children and
others nut forth the idea that she has
either deserted the whole family or else
met with foul play.
It is claimed that Eddie, the oldest boy,
is of the belief that hife mother is still in
the land of the living, but the other chil
dren, the girls, agree that their mother
has met with foul play. A portion of the
Oakland police force believe that the
girls' idea is the correct one and still oth
ers think the case is simply one of deser
tion. However, the children say that
their mother was sober In her habits, and
that the father was the one to blame for
thu present trouble.
BUNKO MEN GOT
ALL HIS COIN
J. W. Kite, a Miner From
British Columbia, the
Victim.
He Was on His Way to This
City for Treatment and
Parted With $331.
%
Captain Bohen Has Detailed Two
Detectives to Search for the
Confidence Operators.
The number of people who report to
the police that they have been the vic
tims of bunko men is astonishing, the
more so as most of them are men gift
ed with ordinary intelligence and in
their different spheres are looked upon
as successful and shrewd in their deal
ings with their fellow men.
J. W. Kite, a miner from Silverton, B.
C, is the latest victim heard from. He
called at police headquarters yesterday
morning and told Captain Bohen a piti
ful story which aroused the sympathy
of the veteran detective.
Kite is troubled with a tumor on the
back and left Silverton about a week
ago to come to a sanitarium in this
city to have it attended to. While in
Seattle waiting for the steamer to
bring him here he met a man who in
troduced himself as a cattleman on his
way to this city. Kite, being a stranger
here, was only too glad to make the ac
quaintance of such an obliging and
well-dressed man. They walked around
that city and finally Kite was led into
a room and introduced to another man.
The cattleman suggested to the other
that they should have a quiet game of
poker. They played a few hands, the
cattleman winning about $2,500.
He took Kite aside and told him con
fidentially that if he had any money
he could join him and they would share
the winnings. He showed Kite a bogus
draft for $2,500 on a bank in San Fran
cisco to prove to him that he was a
man of means. The bait took and Kite
handed him $251 in cash and a draft on
a San Francisco bank for $300, which
at the request of the cattleman he in
dorsed.
The cattleman and the other man
started to play again and, of course,
luck turned, and in a short time the
cattleman had lost all his money, in
cluding the draft and money given him
by Kite.
Kite was dazed by his loss, but the
cattleman came to his rescue and mag
nanimously offered to buy a ticket for
him to take him to this city by steam
er. He did so, and it was not till Kite
had told his story to a fellow passen
ger that he became aware of the fact
that the cattleman was a confederate
of the other bunko man.
Kite arrived by the steamer "Walla
Walla Wednesday and registered at
the New Western Hotel. He wired to
his friends in Silverton to send him a
supply of funds as he was penniless,
and yesterday morning reported tho
case at police headquarters*.
Captain Bohen at once notified the
local banks not to cash the $300 draft
if presented for payment, and to at
once telephone him If anyone should
present it. He also instructed detec
tives Egan and T. B. Gibson to go
around with Kite to see if he could lay
his eyes upon the cattleman or the
other bunko man.
"It is hard upon me," said Kite yes
terday, "as it is necessary that I should
have the operation performed at once
and now I will have to wait till I get
money from home, as they left me
without a cent. I suppose they took
me for a simple miner and thought I
was an easy thing. Well. I suppose
they were not far wrong, but it will be
â i lesson for me for the rest of my life.
If I could only get the draft for $300
It would not be so bad. but I am afraid
I will never see It again."
Libel figalnst the Navarro.
Frank E. Morley. a soafaring man,
filed a libel yesterday in the United
States Circuit Court apainst the steam
ship Navarre, to recover $l">.400 damages'
for in juries alleged to have been sus
tained by him by reason of the fall upon
him of a cage of railroad ties, which the
complainant was assisting in loading on
board the steamer at Usal, Mendoclno
County, on August 21, ISP". The com
plaint alleges that the fall of the cage of
ties waa eiiusf d by the breaking of a
wire cable, the said cable being unsound
and worthless.

for the four years 1894-97, 465.G.-jti cases. The
total output for 1597 In 4.149.441 cases, and Is
unequal to the annual requirements of the
trade In r. year of general prosperity, or else
prices would not have advanced since August
from 30 to 35 cents per dozen on standard
grades of No. 3 tins. The carry-over from
1896 into 1597 wan very much lighter than the
carry-over from lÂ«<f> to ISM!. It is also certain
that stocks in packers' hands at the clone of
1896 were lighter than they have been in many
years at corresponding date.
The pack of the leading States, compared
with 1596, Is as follows:
â Cases 2 doz. tins each â
1R96. 1597.
Maryland 1.031.600 1,881.989

The total pack of Corn in the United States
and Canada was 1.908,740 cases, against 2.676.
Â£ls cases In ISM, an Increase of 232. 215 cases.
It will be noted that the output In 1897 was
only 6000 cases over the average yearly pack
for the three years 1805-97. A revision of the
figures of the Maine pack makes the total for
that State 50,000 cases larger than reported last
year.
The carry-over Into l. c 97 was much less than
the stock taken over Into 1Â«56. This year stocks
are light everywhere.

EXPLANATION,
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at Ftatiun indicate maximum temperature
for the day?; those underneath It. if any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow In inches
and hundredtbs during the past twelve h'>urs.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pre^ure; I? therms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The trlnd "high" means hlÂ»?h
berotnetlc pressure and is usually accompanied
with fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure an-i !.-â  usually preceded and accompanied

Brst ai;.i-Â»r on the Washington coast. When
the pressure ;s; s hi^-h !-i the interior and low
along the coast, and tha isobars extend north
and south along, the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
nark â¢ rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "hifch" In the vicinity of
Idaho, ar.d the pressure 'allintf to the Cali

EASTERN MARKETS.
KEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. .Tan. 13.â stock market was
under more or less pressure to-day on account
Of the news from Havana. There was heavy
realizing at tlmfa anil some aggressive at
tacks I v the bears. . A number of large oper
ators recently on the bull side changed their
views and sold stocks to-day, and the lm
prÂ«salon on the market would undoubtedly
have been much more serious had It not been
for the remarkable strength and buoyancy of
several of the Vanderbllts. This Htrength ar
rested the liquidation and steadied the market
and the declines afterward on the general list
were not large, even when these stocks them
eelves reacted on profit-taking. The declines at
the opening were checked also by the execution
of commission-house orders which had accu
mulated over night. These were the principal
causes to neutralize the undoubtedly serious
view of the situation in Havana and' Its bear-
Ing on the relations between the United States
and Spain which is held in Wall street. There
was no news to account for the buoyancy of
the Vr.nderbilts beyond rumors of an Intended
change of policy In administration, looking to
the reduction of operating cost and an Increase
in dividends. The Grangers and the recent
speculative favorites. Union Pacific and North
ern Pacific, suffered from profit-taking. Lon
don Bold in this market, with a view to taking
profits on yesterday purchases or owing to
disquiet over the Havana incident, was not
clear. Net changes In prices generally are
on the side of losses.
Dealings In Bonds continued large, though
in somewhat reduced volume, and marked gains
were shown by some of the. higher-grade
Bonds. Total sales. $3,530,000.

LONDON MARKET.
I NEW YORK. Jan. 13.â The Evening Post's j
London financial cablegram says: Profit taking
caused a general reaction In the stock mar
i kets here to-day, notably In stocks, which have
! recently risen sharply- Americans, after a re
j action, closed strong and the general outlook j
continued favorable. The weekly statement of
I the Bank of England shows that the coin and \
i bullion Increased Â£165.000, although Â£675.000
I net In (Sold was exported for the week, having
I returned from home circulation and from Scot-
I land. The decrease of Â£1.600.000 In other se
curities shows the maturity market hills held
I by the bank, the effect of which Is also shown
I In the decrease of Â£1.000.000 In other deposits.
The reserve Increased Â£800.000. Details of the .
Gold movement for the week show the export
' of Â£600.000 to Argentina, of Â£100.000 to Egypt
j .-,:, 1 Â£17.000 to Peru, and the receipt of Â£6000
from Paris and Â£24.000 from South Africa. No

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. IÂ».â Weakness was again the
most obtrusive feature of the openlns pro
ceedings In the Wheat pit. May was for Mia
at from 90c to 90V*r. against 90%Q30V4c at the
close the day before. There were substantial
reasons for the opening decline. The Liver
pool market was %$ lower to begin with, and
a little later and still before trading com
menced here the decline, had deepened to a
loss of I>*'l to l>4d per cental. Paris was some
what lower at the -opening. The explanation
of the extreme weakness, at Liverpool wan that
Argentina was offering Wheat very freely.
London also .cabled that cargoes on passage
were very weak. A rise of M.c a bushel that
followed fifteen minutes of free selling was
partly due to fear of complications with Spain.
After this business was very light. The clos
ing quotations from foreign markets gave
TTTE SAX FRAXCTSCO CALL, FTUPAV, JAXT T AT*Y 14, 1898.
Liverpool resting at from %d to Id decline;
Paris Flour unchanged for January and 10
centimes higher for March and June; Wheat 10
centimes lower for January and 10 centimes
higher for March and June. Some buying or
ders from members of the bull clique changed
the complexion of the market In the last hour.
May had declined to 90c, but it wa* well sup
ported at that figure, not only by the Loiter
<!â â â Â« i. but also by shorts. The market rose to
90H&90%c, closing at POVic.
Corn was firm. The range of prices was
narrow. May closed a shade higher.
Oats were very dull. May closed unchanged.
Provisions were dull, figures showing a heavy

VICTORIOUS
Judge Greene Decides a
Case Pending for
Years.
The City Cannot Raise Figures
of the County Board of
Equalization.
Oakland Loses Many Thousands of
Dollars by the Court's
Dcci^-i mi.
Oakland <~>fTlcp, San Francisco Tall,
908 Broadway, Jan. 13.
Judge Greene this afternoon decided
In favor of the Central and Southern
Pacific companies in the matter of the
assessments of their property that were
raised by the City Council above the
b at which they were set for
county taxation purposes.
Th â  court held that the proceedings
rf the City '' â imcil Bitting as a Board
of Equalization were unwarranted by
law, arbitrary and unjust, because no
evidence was taken or heard on the
subject.
The suit was brought by the city of
Oakland against the railroad com- i
panles I t J12.531 in taxes, alleged
it for the year 1593-94.
The companies paid $4541, but refused
v the balance, declaring it to be
illegally levied. The suit was original
ly began by J. K. Peirsol, who was
then City Attorney, but it has dragged
Blowly through the courts until Mr.
I retired from office and was suc
("ity Attorney 1 'ow.
Mr. Dow at the time the levy was
made, was a member of the City Coun
dl, and Attorney. Harvey Brown this
morning invited him to the stand as a
witnea .-.â¢ he was a member of
the Board of Equalization that i
â  in litigation. Mr. Dow
objected and argued the point with the
court, claiming that there was no re
quirement of law to have the evidence
Introduced, and he also quoted the |
charter on that point. The court over- '
ruled his objection, after which Mr.
Dow testified that no witnesses were
Bworn or testified at the meeting. In
Ing himself Mr. Dow
the statement that E. Black Ry
an, tax agent of the railroad com
irney J. C. Martin were
<â â¢ called upon to testify,
but ref '
Brown made an argument
by way of an objection that th^re was
no dollar mark at the head of the roll
In th<> assessment column and that the
figures were consequently unintelligi
ble. But the court held that there was
no merit in the contention. After hear
insr about an hour of argument, the
court decided against the city.
TO LIQUIDATE
CHURCH DEBTS
A Union Organized In the Inter
est of Local Methodist
Congregations.
An Aggregate or Seventy Thousand
Dollars to Be Raised for Clear-
Church Property.
The Methodists of San Francisco arc
up In arms against church debts. At the
of the San Francisco
ion Society of the Meth
church, held at the
Howard-street M. E. Church last night,
matter was the principal theme
ussion. It was a big meeting
and a very enthusiastic one. Representa
frora all the local churches were
on hand in large numbers. The ladies
of the society had so arranged the order
s as to make the initial fea
ture a sumptuous collation.
Of course the time to talk to church
members about raising church debts is i
when they fecjl good, and nothing oper
ates to make them feel pood like a good !
supper or dinner. The ladies got their i
brethren to feeling good, and thus played
a most important part In the proceedings
which were to follow.
Following the supper the meeting was
called to order by I. J. Truman, who pre
sided. After warm words of welcome by i
J. A. B. Wilson, the pastor of the church
in which the meeting was held, addresses ;
were made by Bishop John P. Newman
1>.1>.. I-L..D., Hon. Charles Ooodall, Rev.
\VÂ« Melvln Woodward of Ernvorth M. E.
Church, Rev. Hurcourt W. Peck of i
Trinity Church, I. J. Truman. Rolla V. ,
."Watt and many others on the subject j
under consideration. It was reported i
that the aggregate indebtedness of all !
the local churches wa.s $70,000, and a com
mittee consisting of R. V. Watt, I. J. '
Truman and J. D. Hammond, previously !
appointed, made a report in which was !
formulated a plan for liquidating this
debt. The report proposed the creation i
of a society, to be known as the San <
Francisco Church Union, whose object '
should be the payment of the principal '<â 
of the Interest-bearing debt of the :
several English-speaking Methodist i
churches In this city within three years, |
the aforesaid Indebtedness to be assumed
by the society and divided Into 7000 â 
(shares of $10 each. It was agreed that :
no subscription should be binding until !
the whole- sum In question shall have j
b*Â»en pledged.
The plan was received with the most
enthusiastic approval and the proposi
tion of the committee was accepted with- !
out a dissenting voice. Mora encourag
ing speeches were made, and the move
ment was fiVon an Impetus which prom
ises to carry it through to a successful
issup within a few months, for it is con- i
sidered certain that the necessary
pledges can be secured to pay the debt
within the time specified.
COURSING MEN AT OUTS
Incorporation of the Interstate
Club of California Will Be
Contested.
By the filing of articles of incorpora
tion of "the Interstate Coursing Club of
California" a few days ago an interest
ing point in local coursing history was
reached and a lengthy ltg*l warfare foe
owners and racers of blooded dogs
â will be the result. The directors of the
Bportlng corporation, Dominick Shan-
Don, John Grace, Michael Treanor, P. J.
Rellly, Jamea Dean and James Grace,
ar.rl 1,. ]j. Brown, Secretary of State, in
consequence of the filing of the letters
of incorporation, have been made defend
ants In a suit filed by I. F. Halton, E. V.
Sullivan, John Perigo, S. W. Smith, Ray
Holton, C. C. QrUnrold, Al Austin, W.
Kay- and George Whitney, who have for
several years past been conducting
coursing matches under the name of the
Interstate Coursing Club of California.
They claim the name hai been stolen
from them by the defendants, who con
spired against their interests, and they
ask that the defendants be restrained
from using the incorporation name and
that the Secretary of State be enjoined
from Issuing letters of incorporation to
them. The plaintiffs and defendants In
the action, â with the exception of the A
retary of State, have been "at outs" for
some lime, and the notion of the Incor
poraton and those who sue to prevent
a consummation of their plans was nut
unexpected.

STOPPED THE ARCH.
Supervisors Would Not fillow a
Golden Jubilee Project to
Irrjpede Travel.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors brought the construction of
the Golden Jubilee arch, on Market street
In front of the Baldwin Hotel, to a sud
den stop yesterday. It was found that
the arch was being built directly over a
crossing at which the cars stop and that
travel would be seriously Impeded should
the work go on.
A member of the Jubilee committee ap
peared before the Supervisors in the af
ternoon and agreed that the arc*h should
be removed to a point about nftee feet
west of where it was started, and on this
condition the committee decided to allow
the building to e.i on.
PIQUO AND HIS
LITTLE DECEPTION
If You Would Succeed in the
Acrobatic Art Take a
Foreign Name.
So Says a Clever Impersonator of
That Highly Miechievous
Character.
A gymnastic team -which was billed
under the names of Paulinetti and Pi
quo lately appeared at the Orpheum
Theater in this city and presented an
act on the horizontal bar that was
probably as entertaining as any.tl:<it
has ever been witnessed on the .
One would infer from the Italian na
ture of the names that the poss
were born and reared in Italy's sunny
country, but would be somewhat sur
prised to learn that instead of being of
foreign extraction the two gentlemen
axe both natives of these glorious I'nit
ed States, and to use the words of Pi
quo himself they are proud of it. There
are tricks in all trades, and the theat
rical profession is no exception to this
genera} rule, but in an interesting talk
with Piquo the reasons for thil
sumption of foreign cognomens were
readily understood and it must be
granted that the little deception prac
ticed on the American public is fully
warranted by the attendant circum
stances. It is a well known fact, says
Piquo, that a variety artist who ap
pears under a name peculiar to Euro
pean countries is almost invariably as
sured of being veil received by an
American audience simply because
there is a mistaken impression that
whatever is foreign must be good. This,
says he. militates against the Ameri
can artist, especially in acrobatic per
formances, and Piquo evidently knows
whereof he speaks, for he is no novice
in the theatrical business. He first
commenced to earn regular salary and
thereby professionalized himself in
1868 in the city of New York, where he
was born. His proper every day name
is T. S. Dare, or Tommy Dare, as he
is familiarly called by those who know
him best. He played the part of the
clown in the act, and will be remem
bered as having caused considerable
merriment in that character. His
partner, who rejoices under the name
of Paullnetti when he is doing his
turn, is Ph. Thurber when he is not
going through his very clever and dim
cult scientific work on the horizontal
bar.
Piquo says that the immediate cause
of their taking the foreign names was
the fact that they had traveled c-x
tensively throughout Europe, showing
at the beat music halls in the princi
pal cities, and on returning to this
countiy conceived the scheme. The
first manager to whom they applied
for an engagement, on learning that
they had just arrived from across the
pond and had closed a succeessful sea
son of several months at the Folies
Hergeres, in Paris, immediately con
tracted for their appearnce at his the
ater and paid them double salary (or
the European name. When they first
went to England as the American ar
tists, "Dare and Thurber," they were
coldly received by the English mana
gers, who said there was a surfeit of
that horizontal bar business in th^
theatrical market, "don't you know,"
but condescended to give them a trial.
The managers soon thawed out, how
ever, on the opening night, when they
saw how well the team was received
by the languid English audiences,
who really became enthusiastic in
their applause. After that long en
gagements were the rule. Mr. Dare
(or Piquo), for his identity must be
preserved, Is authority for the state
ment that English acrobatic artists
cannot compare with the Americans
engaged in the same line. In their
gymnastic work, while the former are
slow, studied and lumbering, the lat
ter are more easy, quick and graceful.
Piquo also says that the feats which
he and Paullnetti perform are not one
half as difficult as answering to th^ir
foreign aliases. After a performance
one evening a gentleman of color was
overheard to remark to his companion,
"Say, Johnson, dem fellers, Pollinaris
and Pie-cut, were de best on de pro
gramme."
Piquo's countenance became sad
when he said that there was some dan
ger of the team separating, on account
of some little misunderstanding, but it
is to be hoped that such an event will
not occur, for two people who work fo
well together in public should experi
ence no difficulty in getting along in
their private life. But Piquo says that
it is the gratitude of the world. To
use his language: "I have had a score
of partners In the course of my the
atrical career; have given them all the
benefit of my thirty years' experience
in the acrobatic business, and tben
they gave me the frigid shake. Hut,
never mind, if this one leaves me I
will soon get another one, and we will
hold on to the name of 'Paulinetti and
Piquo' even if the new man should be
a Scandinavian."
THE SAX FIJAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 14, 1898.
IS RESTORED
TO FREEDOM
Doctor Woolsey's Horse
Was Ravenously
Hungry.
Also Drank a Tub of Contra
Costa Water Before Its
Arrest.
Serious Trouble Is Avoided by the
Payment of Three
Dollars.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 13.
Dr. E. H. Woolaey. once the head of
the Southern Pacific Medical Depart
ment, is particularly proud of his pos
session of a heavy black eharper. The
animal is one of the finest in this coun
ty, and its master is a fearless rider.
J>r. Woolaey en his horse is one of the
most familiar sights on the streets of
Oakland and wherever they are seen
one is admired only a little less than
the other.
A few days apo the doctor was taken
sick, an experience almost unknown to
him In his whole life, and while he was
confined to his bed his equine compan
ion stn lied off on an exploring expedi
tion and was found quietly eating oats
in a blacksmith's shop in East Oak
land.
Last night the horse was arrested
and detained at the City Prison under
the charge of Chief Lloyd. The aristo
cratic animal had never associated
with common municipal horses and
vags before, and its spirited nature re
belled at such 'treatment. Its humilia
tion was entirely due to the feed of
oats it stole, or is alleged to have
stolen in the blacksmith's shop.
When the blacksmith found himself
in possession of the doctor's charger
he says he also found himself out of
possession of two sacks of oats which
he alleges the animal had eaten. Now.
Dr. Woolsey has never been credited
with being close-fisted, and he says
that if his animal really ate a feed
from the blacksmith's oat box he does
not mind paying for it. but the black
smith declares that the doctor's horse
was so fearfully hungry that it did not
stop till it had eaten and destroyed two
sacks .of oats, after which depredation
the horse was taken into custody.
Dr. Woolsey is not able to attend to
the legal part of the business himself,
so he deputed Dr. Harry P. Travers to
take all necessary steps to recover the
horse, which he values at several hun
dred dollars, and which was detained
because Of a disputed two sacks of
oats. It irritates the doctor to think
that any one should assume that he
owned the horse that was ever hungry
enough to eat two sacks of oats at a
meal, and he declines to pay for it.
A search warrant was duly sworn
out and Dr. Travers, accompanied by
Officer Moore, went to East Oakland
and recovered the animal. It was
brought to the City Prison and as it
was too late to hear the evidence last
night Judge Allen ordered Chief Lloyd
to take good care of the animal till
this morning.
This afternoon the CAse was called
before Judge Allen. Attorney .T. C.
Johnson appeared for the blacksmith
and Dr. TrÂ«wrÂ« represented the doc
tor and the horse. It was testified to
that the horse had drank one cask of
Contra Costa water and eaten largely
of finÂ« oats, and the whole matter was
adjudicated by the payment to the
blacksmith of $.?.
Dr. Travers led the horse home from
the prison stables.
Mills College Opening.
OAKLAND, Jan. Mills College

expressed at the non-attendance of somo
seven girl students who had been ex

rumors were current as to thÂ« cause of
the non-appearance of the pupils, one
even alleging that it was enforced by the
faculty on account of some girl Isi esca
pades Indulged In by thÂ« students during
a wheeling trip last term. Professor Ke^p
of the college and the father of one of the
girls absolutely denied that there was any
ground for such rumors and denied that
there was anything unusual in the cir

firm In Milwaukee was $24,000 below the
Chicago figures. The Risdon Iron
Works of this city were $8000 below the
Milwaukee bid, and the Union Iron
Works offered to supply the desired
machinery according to the specifica
tions at a figure $34,000 belo-w the price
designated by the Chicago firm. The
bid of the Union Iron Works was pre
sented In due form.
Capitalists whose money is invested
in the development and operation of the
mines may find occasion to investigate
the award of this most remarkable con
tract. In the OTdlnary course of busi
ness, contracts are awarded to the
lowest responsible bidder, but In com
petition for supplying machinery for
the Alaska Treadwell mine, the lowest
Chicago bidder takes the award.
The Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association heard of the setback given
to the California bidders and the man
ager. Oscar Lewis, lost no time in try
ing to get at the bottom of thp facts
and reasons. From whnt bÂ« hÂ«i
learned he will bring the matter to the
attention of the Board of Directors at
tho next meeting. He stated yesterday
that the reason of the highest instead
of the lowest bidder getting the con
tract was apparent, but the reason for
asking for bids in the first place was
not. "I found," said he, "that the
owner of thÂ« Alaska mine property is
a large English syndicate and some of
the heaviest members of the syndicate
are members of the firm whose bid for
the machinery was accepted. In other
words they gave the contract to them
selves and the only r^apon. that I can
think of, why any bids werp asked for
at all. was the European members of
the syndicate wanted the California
members to believe that the machinery
whs bid for in the open market. While
W< stem manufacturers do not wonder
that these people should pive the con
tract to themselves they are not
!>!â  is- d that the action should give the
Impression that Chicago can make ma
chinery any better or cheaper than
California. This is where the Western
kick comes in. and at the next meeting
it will be made pood and strong."

BORROMEAN COUNCIL.
Seventh Annual Entertainment
Given by the Mission Boys.
The members of Borromean Council 129,
of the Young Hen's Institute, gave their
mnny Mend a In the Mission an up-to-date
entertalnnu ni at Turn V>rcin Hall on
Seventeenth streel last nl^ht. The hall
was beautifully decorated with the colors
of the Institute, cardinal and poid. and
the programme w is everything that tal
ent could make it. especially that part
allotted to Dr. J. P. McCarthy, which in
its rendition "caught the house."
Soprano selections by Mrs. Cheesman
and Miss Nippert were above the average
generally heard at amateur entertain
mi ntn
This was the seventh anniversary of the
Council and, from the number of the
Mission people who attended a paid en
tertainment It is quite evident that the
boys par.l well with their neighbors, as
the hall was well tilled.

THE SAVING OF
THE PAGAN SOUL
Dedication of the New Central
Mission House as a Place
of Worship.
A Qnaint Programma in Which Chi
nese Acquitted Themselves
â¢iibly.
A most Interesting and Impressive cere
mony was the dedication as a place of
worship of the new central Mission House,
an adjunct to the California Chinese Mis
sion at 9 Brenham plate,, on the west
side of Portsmouth square, yesterday
evening. This mission was organized
twenty-five years ago to teach the Gos
pel to the Chinese. The mission house
has 135 members enrolled under the ban
ncr of the Chinese Congregational So
ciety, and the parent body, the California
Chinese Mission has over ISM Oriental
converts to its credit since it first began
the I tod work. Dr. J. K. McLane Is the
president and guiding spirit of this mis
sion. An audience of nearly 400 people
assembled at their hall last evening,
nearly half of whom were Chinese, the
rest being white workers in the move
ment, a few Chinese ladies making the
scene a picturesque one with their char
acteristic costumes.
They listened with rapt attention and
with heads reverently bowed, especially
to the religious portion of the exercises,
and with rinsing voices all Joined In
Rinsing a hymn in their own language,
and they are evidently most sincere in
their Christian belief. They seemed to
particularly enjoy the discourse in Chi
nese, delivered by Rev. F. J. Masters,
who speaks the dialect like a native. An
entertaining novelty was the singing of
the two quartets, one of which sang in
Chinese and the other In English, both
patting much feeling and considerable
melody in the-renditlÂ«7ns of their respect
ive numbers. Rev. P. B. Perkins, vice
president of the corporation, presided
over the order of service.

An Object Seen Near Duluth
Gives Rise to the
Story.
There Is Bright Moonlight, and a Tele
graph Operator Soys It la a
Balloon.
Special TMspatch to The Call.
DULUTH, Minn., Jan. 14.â What is
believed to be a balloon drifted slow
ly out of the northwest at midnight,
and is now suspended over Lake Su
perior, apparently about twenty-five
milt s from Duluth.
Th.p night operator for the North
American Telegraph Company viewed
the object with a powerful marine
glass, and says there Is no doubt what
ever that It is a balloon. Th*>re is a
bright moonlight, and wind from the
west. From Duluth the balloon was
sighted at fire headquarters. Night tel
egraph operators at several points
have also seen it.
The ballooi^ carries a light, which
flickers, so aPto give It, at a distance
of twenty-five miles, the appearance of
a star that twinkles more than ordi
narily.
TWO HARBORS. Minn., Jan. 14.â
For several hours to-night a balloon
with a light in it was seen over Lake
Superior. The marine reporter here
saw It plainly with a powerful night
glass. There Is no doubt about the ob
ject being a balloon. It was visible un
til 2:30 this morning, when the sky be
came cloudy. As there has been no bal
loon ascension in this vicinity It is tak
en frrr granted the object seen is An
dree's balloon, reported yesterday from
British Colurubia points.

TO CONDEMN
DEATH'S CURVE
Cuvellier Working to
Abate the Fatal
Nuisance.
Land to Be Condemned and
an Assessment District
Named.
Five Thousand Dollars May Be
Enough to Buy tho
Block.
" m a
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 13.
There Is now a hope that death's
curve, at Seventh and Market streets. !
may not exist much longer. Thi3 sec- j
tlon of the track where the trains pass j
within a few feet of the walls of adja- j
cent houses and which cannot be pro- ;
tected except by the purchase of land, j
has caused the deaths of scores of peo- â¢
pie during the thirty years the railroad ,
has been in operation. The last victim |
was a blind man, who could not see ;
that the train was coming, and preced
ing him was J. H. Knarston. the prom
inent Druid of San Francisco.
Councilman Cuvellier has been work- j
ins in the interest of having the ad
joining land purchased by the city so
as to entirely do away with the pre
vailing danger. The obstruction to
view which has been so fatal is the
gore block bounded by Market, "West
and Seventh streets, and Mr. Cuvellier
is in favor of condemning the block
rind purchasing it by fixing the cost on
an assessment district to be yet deter
mined.
It has been found that the block is
aaai ssed for $"200. but the owner has
demanded $10,000 for the property. At
the average of assesments in Alameda
County the property night be worth
from J4SOO to $5000. The Councilman
thinkscondemnation proceedings should
be instituted at once, and as soon as
the assessment district shall be decided
upon, an ordinance will be introduced
for carrying out the project.
Councilman Henneberry thinks the
proper district to be assessed for the
infprovement should be bounded by
Third, Twelfth. Castro and Filbert
Streets, and the Street Committee has
decided to make this recommendation
to the Council.

MRS. SHAFTER
AT DEATH'S DOOR
Suffering the Second Time
From a Stroke of
Paralysis.
Falls Insensible as She Is En
tering Her Car
riage.
!
Mrs. Shatter, the wife of Commandlng-
General Shafter of Fort Mason, has been
lingering between life and death for the
past few days from a stroke of paralysis.
Though almost in the arms of death
the relatives of the stricken woman do
not give up hope -and are clinging tena
ciously to every theory that may lead
to possible recovery.
As this Is the second attack of this
character grave fears are entertained for
her ultimate recovery. The first attack
was received on the 11th of December,
INS. and since that time up to the present
Mrs. Shafter has enjoyed good health.
It was believed that she had entirely re
covered from the first attack, owing to
the good health she was enjoying. Since
the attack "Wednesday she has not re
gained consciousness for a single mo
ment.
The last attack of the dread disease
was very sudden, as It was received by
the unfortunate woman as she was en
tering her carriage. She had been at
tending a lecture at the Century Club
Wednesday afternoon and seemed to be
In the best of health. She had Just left
the lecture hall and was stepping into
her carriage when she fell insensible, al
most striking the carriage step as she
fell.
Just previous to her leaving the hall
and during the progress of the lecture
she seemed to be in sound, and to all ap
?earances, perfect health, chatting to her
riends and at times listening very atten
tively to the lecturer.
Owing to her present condition it Is
feared that unless a change for the bet
ter comes soon the end will not be long
in relieving her of pain.
The latest reports received from her
home last night state that her condition
Is about the same, there being no cfTange
for the better and none for the worse.

It has lately developed that Russell al

amounts and filling out the correspond

much smaller amounts, charged to his
"personal account." The aggregate of
robbery is not known, save to a few peo

The loss falls principally on the Globe

OUTSIDERS IN
THEIR ELEMENT
The Going at Oakland
Was Too Sticky for
the Favorites.
Ricardo Defeated a Big Field at
the Long Price of Fifty
to One.
Palmerston Won Easily at Twenty
to One â Fashion Plate Another
Winner at Long Odds.
The going at Oakland yesterday was
Fticky and holdlner and form players
experienced a rough time picking win
ners. Outsiders In the betting held a
sort of levee, taking most of the races
on the card. The rank outsider Ri
cardo, with as good as SO to 1 about
him in the ring, captured the opening
event with ease from a big field. The
books laid 6 to 1 against La Maroma.
winner of the maiden three year old
race, and Fashion Plate romped away
with the mile and a sixteenth affair at
15 to 1. The final race of the day went
to Palmerston, backed down from 20
to 12.
A miscellaneous collection of selling
platers faced the webbing In the open
ing six furlong sprint, with Gallant
ruling: a 5 to - favorite. He failed to
get Inside the money. McDonald on the
50 to 1 shot. Rlcardo, ran around his
field, and, taking the lead in the run
home, won with ease from Coda. Hen
nessy landed show honors with Ver
agua. Blue Bell had speed, but quit
near the end.
The finish to the five and a half fur
long scramble next decided resulted in
a very close finish between La Mar
oma, Flandes and Bow and Arrow, th<=>
trio finishing: heads on the wire. The
winner, La Maroma, with Hennessy up,
a 5-to-l chance, made the running, and
Inclined to swerve at the end, won by
a head from Flandes. Entrata was
tipped about as the smart one In the
race, but failed to do anything sensa
tional.
The mile and a sixteenth selling run
was a hard throw down for the talent.
Argentina was heavily played at even
money, but was unable to navigate in
the sticky going, and landed rods be
yond first place. Fashion Plate, a ir>
to-1 sh"t, cut out the pace from the
jump, leading out Collins a length at
the wire, with pounds to spare. Song
and Dance finished in the show.
Cash Sloan, astride the second choice,
Morellito, down the 5-to-2 choice, San
Venado. in the seven and a half fur
long run, and at the same time nearly
gave the colt's followers heart disease.
With the race well in hand the entire
distance. Cash drew the finish
fine, and, nearly caught napping by
Clayton, won by a h^ad. Tom Griffin's
filly, Hardly, showed to goad advan
tage, finishing a clofee third.
The big chestnut horse. King Will

for the mile soiling run, but little
O'Connor l<rst an acre of ground with
him at the head of the stretch, and was
unplaced at the wire. Harry Thoburn,
with Spencer up. made a runaway race
of the thing, leading from start to fin
ish, and winning in a romp from Th<M
ma. Cappy, third choice, was badly
cut down.
Benamela, with Lonny Clayton in the
saddle, was made an B-to-5 choice for
the last race of the afternoon, and did
not shovÂ»- enough speed to catch a
broken-down car horse. Palrnerston, a
20-to-l ehot. ridden by Tompkins, over
took the speedy D<>n't Skip Me less
than a furlong: from the wire, and
won easily by five lengths. Una Colo
rado, another outsider, was a clc-se
third.

was the perplexing problem that confronted S.
F. Capps, owner of Rlcardo, yesterday. Mr.
Capps but recently got out of a hospital where
he had been confined, and while others won
handsomely to the race he had to be satisfied
with the purse.
MeManus, the local plunger, played Rlcardo
all three ways, winning $1500 to the race.
J. F. Fogg's useful mare will probably be
on the shelf for some time to come. When
cut down during the progress. of the fifth race
the tendon of the nigh hind leg was nearly
severed through. The accident undoubtedly
occurred at the first turn, and the "cook"
who caused it should be retired from the sad
dle for some time, as the field was a small one
and there was no necessity for such a happen
ing
Old Cash Day apparently came out of
Wednesday's race sound and good, but yes
terday It was discovered that the tendon of
his good fore leg was bowed, and he has prob
ably done with racing for all time.
"Longshot" Conley was fined $50 by the
judges for pulling out from the rail with Don't
Skip Me in the last race In an endeavor to
block the rapidly coming Palmerston.
Roy Carruthers is the possessor of some two
year-olds that are being prepared for the com
ing summer racing on one of the southern
stock farms. Yesterday he was in receipt of
a letter which stated that while romping In
the paddock one very promising filly, a full
sister to the Futurity winner. L'Alouette, had
her breast pierced by a rail and had to be
destroyed.
Ricardo, the long-priced winner of the open-
Ing event, was given as the probable winner
in The Call's selections. Sleepy Jane, the first
horse named, was scratched.
The attention of horsemen is called to the
fact that entries to the two-year-old stakes to

POOL-SELLING ORDINANCE.
FranÃ Corbett Acquitted by a Jury
in Judge Low's Court.
Frank Corliett, who was arrested last
November for violating the pool ordi
nance, had his case tried before a jury
in Judge Low's court yesterday after
noon. After hearing the evidence of the
arresting officer and the arguments of
r.uin-^1 the Jury retired and in a few
minutes returned with a verdict of not
guilty.
Jtidge Low pays it is impossible to get
a Jury to convict in such cases. an<l a
juror remarked to Prosecuting Attorney
Reynolds, after the verdict had been
given, that he did not see why Eastern
men should be allowed to come here and
make pools inside the race track and
local men prohibited from making pools
outside the track.
BUNKO MEN FOILED.

Spoil T^eir Little Garrje.

Whiting and William Bailey, fr.ur well

officers, becoming suspicious, watched
the men, and followed tlv-ni to th>- Lodg
ing house at the corner of O'Farrell and
Mason streets, breaking into the roum.

the man from the frozen pokl fields.
The men were arrested and j/lnced on

THE SAX FEANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JAXTJARY 14, 1898.
RACING TIPS
AND OTHERS
Mrs. Prentiss Said to Have
Played Horses and Lost Her
Milliner Shop.
She Denies This Allegation and Makes
Some Others to the Confounding
of Judicial Wisdom.
Juuge Hebbard has under advisement
a case delicate and difficult enough to
make a wise Jurist He awake o" nights.
In the first place It is a Quarrel be
tween women, so either way he decides
he must incur the scorn of one of them,
which is not a pleasant thing to incur.
There is understood to be no fury like
it.
Mrs. G. L. Prentias is a milliner and
so is Miss Minnie Gorman, once Mrs.
Prentiss had a shop and now Miss
Gorman has the same shop. The chang
ed condition is not satisfactory to Mrs.
Prentiss, but Miss Gorman, knowing
the value of possession to be equal to
nine points out of a possible ten, holds
on grimly. To all efforts to have her
ousted, bounced, ejected, set outside
the door, she presents a determined
front. Each contestant told her story
yesterday. In some particulars these
fall to agree.
According to Mrs. Prentiss she had
disposed of the business to Miss Gor
man for a paltry $230, the transfer be
ing temporary. Later she had made a
tender, of this sum and Miss Gorman
had declined to accept it or to permit
the former owner to resume the digni
fied position she had abandoned. As
she could not win the consent of M;ss
Gorm&n to this arrangement, she put
in a claim to some furniture in the
shop, thr worth of the property being
from $1000 to $135. according to the es
timates of the warring pair. To a
question, the witness replied that bets
on racing had not caused hfr troubles.
Miss Gorman then took the stand and
testified that the troubles of her ex
employer arose from a habit of play
ing the races and a weakness for
straight tips. She affirmed that the
money which should have gone to pay
for services rendered by millinery ar
tists really wont to the book-makers.
She claimed that she had bought the
shop In good faith and had put H2OO
into improvements so that the idea of
letting go was beyond all consideration.
With no part of this testimony did that
of Mrs. Prentiss agree, she denying
that the straight tip had aught to do
with the situation.
"With the affair elucidated only to
this extent it was turned over to the
Ju<lge and the Indies departed, not how
ever without an exchange of glances
more chilly than the dawn of a frosty
morning;
CORONERS INQUESTS.
The Market-Street. Railway Com
pany Blanked for Not' Having
Fenders on Their Cars.
Coroner Hawkins yesterday morning
held .in inquest on the body of Howard
R. IfcNlchol, who died a few days ago
from the effects of injuries received in
a collision with a Market-street car at
thÂ« crossing f.f Eleventh street. After
reciting the Immediate i ause of death
the verdict goes on to say "and the uiry
blames the Market-street Railway < ;,, - m
pany for lack i.f efficient fenders where
by such fatalities might be avoided."
In the case <-f Mrs. Mary Duffy, the
24-year-old widow who pnisonti! herself
with carbolic field on the Wth inst the
verdict was that the decease!
laboring under a fit of temporary in
sanity.
For Illegal Flsrjlng-
The preliminary examination of
Michaels and Drake, who were arrested
last Saturday for using illegal nets in
the Salinas River, was held yesterday
before Justice Clark of Castrovllle anil
the accused were held for trial before
the Superior Court. These men were
caught by the Fish Commission deputies
while operating set nets which they had
stretched from bank to bank across the
Salinas River, near Castrovllle. The
county officers in that section of the
State always render the State officers
all t..e help they can in the matter of
upholding the game and fish laws.

CONTESTS
Hard Punching and
Ear-Chewing Last
Evening.
McGrath Whipped Sul
livan, but the Referee
Was Lenient.
The Excelsior Athletic Mem
bers Witnessed a Good
Entertainment.
ARONSEN, EAR-CHEWER.
The Pugilistic Italian Attempted to
Mutilate His Opponent's Or
gi;n of Hearing.
The Bxeehnor Athletic Club of Eighth
and Folsnm streets gave a very excit
ing contest last evening at their club
rooms between Joe Sullivan of the Im
perial Athletic <"lub and James Mo-
Grath, a pupil of Young Mitchell. The
men entered the ring weighing 130
pounds, and Jim Kennedy, the presi
dent of the club, who was selected to
referee the contest, announced that he
would declare the man who scored the
greater number of points at the end of
six rounds to be the winner.
McGrath was seconded by Spider
Kelly. Tim McGrath and Solly Smith,
while Sullivan was looked after by two
or three of his friends from the Impe
rial Athletic Club. Several dollars were
wagered at even money by the mem
bers of the club on the result before
the men entered the ring.
In the first round McGrath rushed at
Sullivan, and. after missing a left-hand
swing at the head, he smashed the Im
perial man a heavy right in the stom
ach. Sullivan fell back against the
rnppp, then ducked away, and as lie-
Grath rushed at him again. Sullivan
caught him a left swing on the Jaw
which partly dazed the recipient. Sul
livan then seeing an advantage closed
in on McGrath, and punched him a left
In the neck. This was followed by in
fighting, and some rough exchanges re
sulted. McGrath was Bent to his knees
from the force of a right cross counter
on the jaw. As he regained his pins
the bell sounded the end of the first
round.
Second Ro-und â Sullivan came to the
scratch with blinking eyes, and Mc-
Grath lost no time in forcing the argu
ment. Sullivan was punched all round
the ring, but returned to the fire, and
with a well-directed left-hand swing he
plospd completely the right eye of Mc-
Grath. and was having all the best of
the Mght until near the finish when Mc-
Grath whs Bent under the ropes in a
bleeding and distressed state. Just
then the gong sounded and saved Mc-
Grath's bacon.
Third Roundâ McGrath. notwith
standing the punishment he had re
ceived, fought like a demon, and pun
ished Sullivan in the stomach with
right-handers. Sullivan returned blow
for blow, and had McGrath'a face
smeared with blood when the round
closed.
Fourth Roundâ McGrath toed the
scratch anxious for fight. He charged
at Sullivan, swinging right and left,
but th.> Imperial man being wary, duck
ed cleveriy from punishment. Near the
end of the round MpGratb landed three
hard smashes on Sullivan's mouth, and
the receiver turned tail and ran around
the ring. Sullivan was showing the
white feather when the round ended.
The fifth and sixth muml? were all in
McOrnth's favor. Notwithstanding the
punishment that he had received In the
previous rounds, he proved to b% the
gamer man by a long shot, and drove
Sullivan from corner to corner of the
ring in a manner that disgusted the
friends of the Imperial Club gladiator.
McGrath was having all the best of the
fight at the end of the sixth round
wh^n time was called. He was thor
oughly entitled to the decision on points,
according to rule, but the referee de
cided the contest a draw, so as to give
general satisfaction.
The San Francisco Athletic Club hari
an entertainment also last evening.
After several small bouts between
members of the dub, Nick Aronsen, the
champion hungry man from no partic
ular place on earth, was defeated by
Young Sharkey in two rounds. Shar
key did not knock Aronsen out, but
when the latter found .that he was get
ting the worst of the argument he made
a desperate attempt to chew off a piece
of the Wt ear of his opponent. Ref
eree Jerry Flynn thought that Mr.
Aroneen should have left his cannibal
appetite at home, and immediately
awarded the fight to Young Sharkey.
Over 200 members of the Union Ath
letic Club met in their hall, on Mason
street, last evening, and enjoyed an ex
cellent programme of b.xingand tumb
ling. A sparring match between acts
seemed to arouse the enthusiasm o-f the
members. The go of the evening be
tween William Pabst of the T'nion Club
and James Ryan of the Home Club
was declared a draw by Referee John
Casey, a now shining light, who for
mally challenged the world after
watching the friendly go.

A DESPERATE BURGLAR RECAPTURED.
Charles Johnson, one of the desperate
burglars who escaped from the Salinas
City Ja.ll several weeks ago, was recap
tured on Grant avenue early yesterday
morning by Detectives Gibson and
Wren.
Johnson, according to the police, is
one of the most desperate burglars in
the country. A short time ago he was
released from San Quentin after serving
a sentence of four years for burglary
committed in Sacramento. He subse
quently went to Salinas City, where he
and an accomplice were caught in the
act of burglarizing a private residence.
They were confined in the City Jail,
and a strict watch was kept on them,
as it was believed that Johnson would
make a determined effort to break jail.
On the night that they escaped John
son called th.- under sheriff and asked
him to get him a sheet of writing pa
per, as he was anxious to send a letter
to his aged mother. In some way the
men had provided themselves with a
key to the cell in which they were con
fined, and as the under sheriff went to
get the paper they opened the door and
quietly entered the corridor.
The writing material of the jail was
in a small desk in a room at the end
SOLID NINE AT
WORK AGAIN
Director Hammond Pro-
vides for His Favor-
ite Niece.
No Significance to Be Attached
to the Late Transfer of
Principals.
But Directors Head and Bnrrington
Hold Widely Divergent Views
on the Subject.
Miss I,ida Carroll, who has secured
the pt-sition of vice-principal in the new-
Mission High School, has nothing to
regret in being the favorite niece of
Director Hammond. She was among
the first of his appointments one year
ago, or shortly after he warmed his
seat in the board. Consequently her
prom<rtion from the substitute class to
that of a teacher and finally to the re
sponsible position of vice-principal of
the new Mission High School all with
in the short period of one year is doing
well, to say the least of it. Of course,
there are other teachers in the School
Department who have been more than
one year teaching in the lower grade.
T'nfortunately for them, they have no
uncle in the board as a Director who
pulled kindly in the "boss" harness and
saw to it that the wishes of Dr. Ragan
and his seven compatriots were car
ried out to the letter, without asking
any impertinent questions as to
whether the changes in the department
were for the good of the pupils and
advantageous to the interest of the tax
payers Probably the other nieces of
this thoughtful Director will be remem
bered later on, provided there be
schools enough to accommodate them
with vice-principalships in High
Schools. Qualifications, of course, do
not count in the eternal fitness of
things in rewarding Directors' nieces
with good paying positions, so long as
there are positions to found.
The breach that has existed in the
School Hoard ever since its members
were first inducted into oflioe is threat
ening to become wider and wider all
because of the late transfer <rf several
principals and vice-principals. The
transfers were in the nature of promo
tions, for salaries have bet n increased
in every case. However, the lucky onefc
will not assume their positions until the
completion of the new Mission High
Sphool, of which Joseph O'Connor was
eta ted principal. That school, accord
ing to Director Head, will not be
ready for the reception of pupils until
the end of the year, and he contends
that the board, to say the least, was
a little premature in making an ap
pointment which will not g<; into effect
urtil that time. He claims that the
board, or rather the Solid Nine of it. is
now paying up some old political debts
and this settlement of claims they
have been endeavoing to bring about
for almost a year past.
As an instance of this political ma
nipulation he points to the assignment
j of Madison Habcock to the vice-princi
palship of the Girls' High School,
I which would appear to be the latter's
reward for having, while Superintend
ent of Schools, nominated Ragan to
succeed Director Halstead. whn died
j before he assumed the duties of his of
i fice about a year ago. and Babcock's
; present promotion has all the ear
j marks of being a stepping stone to the
more elevated place of principal of the
same school. This could be easily ac
complished by the transfer of Profess
or Brooks to another school. James
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 14, 1898.
of the corridor, and as the under sher
iff entered the desperate men slipped
up to the door and turned the key,
which had been carelessly left in the
lock, making the official a prisoner.
They then secured the key to the outer
door and made their escape. The un
der sheriff was compelled to remain in
the room until the following morning,
when one of the deputies, noticing his
predicament, released him.
By this time the escaped prisoners
had boarded a freight train and sub
sequently came to this city. Detectives
Gibson and Wren located Johnson's ac
complice in the tenderloin district and
placed him under arrest. The follow
ing day he was returned to Salinas
City, where he Is now awaiting trial.
Shortly alter 5 o'clock yesterday
morning the same officers discovered
Johnson in a rooming house on Grant
avenue. Determined not to take any
chances of being shot by him the de
tectives suddenly burst open the door
of his room. As they entered Johnson
reached for a loaded revolver which he
bad concealed under his pillow, but be
fore h>- could use it they seized him.
He was then handcuffed and escorted
t.i th.- City I'rism. To-day he will be
taken back to Salinas City.
Simmons pressed O'Connor very close
ly in the race for the Mission High
School principalship, but the latter won
out handily and the former was con-
BOled by succeeding O'Connor in the
Horace Mann.
It might l>e interesting to state In this
connection that Simmons was Kainey's
candidate fur Superintendent of Schools
on th" Democratic ticket against Web-
Bter and Habcook at the last election,
but was defeated, Webster being the
fortunate one of the trio. It would thus
appear that these three had some secret
understanding to stand by each other,
although they were political opponents.
< 'ii the other hand. Director Barring
ton maintains that the appointments
have no especial political significance
whatever, but we're all made in the best
Interests of educational affairs. As to
the charge of undue haste in the mat
t. r of Â« i'l'nnnnr's appointment, he takes
the opposite stand, for he pays that the
Mission High School wlil !Â»â  finished in
time for the opening of the school yc;ir
in August, and If this board is to be
accused of being premature, what must
be said of the last one, which attempt
ed t<> elect Charles H. Murphy princi
pal of that school as far back as De
cember, 1596, before the foundation was
laid. He failed of election, however, as
he never received more than six votes.
and it required seven to elect. As to the
wholesale transfer of teachers. Bar
rington says that It was done in the
main at their own request, and In some
cases at the desire of the principals
for the Improvement of the various
schools und^r their charge.
SENSATION OF THE
SUICIDE SYMPHONY
Tschaikowsky's No. 6 Played
by Fritz Scheel at the
Tivoli.
The Russian's Work Dwarfed and
Darkened the R<*st of a Mod
ern Programme.
The much written about "Pathetic." or
"Suicide," or Sixthâ as you like it-
Symphony of Tschaikowsky lured the
largest audience of the season to the ;
concert at th<* Tivoli yesterday after- .
noon. Advertising has its value, even ;
fur tlie masterpieces of music. The his
tory of this symphony is sensationalâ
It has been made sensational by the mv- â 
sic critics of two continents; and many
persons who would not have been moved
by an ordinary concert announcement
were made curious by the innuendo and
esoteric signilicnnce that have been as- I
sociate'l with the work. Their curiosity
was m>t disappointed. The Tsehaikow
sky was a shock; it dwarfed and cheap
ened everything else on the programme.
The "Irn Herbst" overture of Grieg's
was played without notable fineness, but;
It received some attention because it '
came before the symphony. The Schu
mann Abendlieri and four numbers of
Rubinstein's "iial Costume" came after
it. and those were barely tolerated.
Bcheel gTabhed at a few mechanical
hand-pats which greeted the "Toreador
and Andalusian" picture In the Rubin
stein suite, and considered them as an
encore. But he did not deceive the most
of us. who. so soon as the symphony was
over, settled deep in our top coatsâ the
house was as cold as a morgue â and de- j
tied him to bring us back.
To say the Pathetic Symphony is sen
sational does not imply that it is yellow,
nor that It is given over to the lascivious
pleasings of neurotlcism. To me, as well
as I can understand It after one hear
ing. It seems to be the music of the age
problem music. It asks something of the
heart; it paints pictures of worldly hap- '
piness; It pleads, and in a way it com
forts, but In Its entirety it celebrates the
futility of human hope, the sovereignty
of despair. It is too kindly, too radiant
with melodic beauty to be called cynical.
There is in it none of the massive godli
ness of Beethoven, none of the sweet
dyspepsia of Chopin, none of the colossal
exaggeration of Wagner. It is virile, hu
man and plausible, and It is terribly
modern in Its psychology. I had not seen
the score nnd knew practically nothing i
of the manner of the work before It was
played yesterday, and yet I was not sur
prised by the grim, relentless endingâ an
ending that, from its suddenness and ab
solute decision (as compared with other
works), you would expect to be surprise
ful. I can account for this only by tho
thoroughness with which the sympathy
and portent are shadowed from the very
lirst f.f the first movement. The Pathetic
Symphony Is a tragedy, with precious
moments of liÂ»;ht and love and ambition,
but with all its forces working toward
the inevitable tragic er.d.
1 have no Intention of rivaling James
Hamilton Howe, who Is now the official
prose-poet and programme-illuminator
of the Symphony Society, but I defy any
nne of normal imagination to hear this
symphony as Scheel played It yesterday
and not get from It some meaning and
motive beyond the mere sensations of
amiable sound. ASHTON STEVENS.
