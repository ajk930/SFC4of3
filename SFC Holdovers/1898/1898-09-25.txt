VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO. 117.
ENTHUSIASTIC REPUBLICANS
Issues of the Campaign
Plainly Outlined by
the Orator.
A Great Audience Listens
to a Masterly Speech
at Odd Fellows'
Hall.
Morris M. Estea addressed an enthusiastic audience last night at Odd
Fellows' Hall. No man in the State is better versed in local and national
politics. He discussed the issues of the present State campaign in an able
manner. He advocated the retention of the territory acquired during the
recent war, and demonstrated that thÂ§ holding of the conquered islands was
a political and commercial necessity due to the progress of the nation and
the extension of its commerce. He denounced the single-tax heresy of
Maguire and advocated the construction of the Nicaragua canal. He warned
ths Republicans to stand together to combat the railroad influence in the
administration of public affairs and to fight for the protection of American
industries and American producers.
Hon. M. M. Estec addressed a large
gathering of voters last night at Odd Fel
lows' Hall on the political issues of the
present campaign. Hts address was an
able one and was delivered in a masterly
style.
The hall was well filled. The rain kept
many indoors, but withal there was a
goodly crowd, and those who composed It
were not lack::ig in enthusiasm.
George C. Pardee was the chairman of
the meeting. In his introductory remarks
he said the mission of the Republican
par* was not yet accomplished. During
the forty years of its existence the Amer
ican nation had passed through many
trials, and or.cc the nation came near dis
solution. Each time- of the nation's
troubles the Republican party has gone
to its rescu\ The Republican party has
saved the nation from ruin and has made
the nation what it is to-dayâ the greatest
on th- < ar;h. Whenever there are great
national thin? to do the Republican
party lias always furnished the men to
do them. It furnished I-ineoln' to carry
it through a great fratricidal war; Grant
to rivet the nation together during a time
of peace; J. G. Blame to spread its fame
throughout the world, and to-day it has
furnished even a greater leader in Wil
liam McKinley.
"Turn over the pages of history," he
paid, "and can there be found a Demo
crat that carries the name of any of
those I have mentioned?
"The Republican party will not com
plete its work until It has cemented this
great nation into one great brotherhood.
"The coming election is one which has
more than local and Slate significance.
Its results will be an expression of con
fidence or of condemnation of the actions
and deeds of the present administration
and of the President. 1 do not believa
there is a man here who is not proud of
the achievements of the nation during
the recent war under the guidance of
William McKinloy."
When M. M. Estee wa^s introduced he
â was greeted with cheer after cheer.
"It may be a little rainy and cold on the
outside, but it is warm in here, " he said,
in response to the greeting.
"Before I commence 1 want to intro
duce to you two men whose names are
on the Republican ticket for State of
fices. They are Truman Reeves, candidate
for Treasurer, and M. J. Wright, candi
date for Surveyor General."
Each of the candidates received a round
of applause.

Progress.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, IS9Bâ THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
On these lines It consecrated the early
years of Its existence; since then it has
been fighting to perpetuate these princi- 1
pies. It to-day and at all times has been
the great tribune of the American people
âit boldly met every new issue confront
ing' this nation. From the beginning it
has proclaimed the equal rights of man;
it has been the defender of the poor and
the homeless; it has secured to the Amer
ican worker new and more ample re
wards; it has protected American Indus
try and American enterprise from the un
fair competition of foreign labor; it has
stood at the gates of commerce and de
fended American trade. Its protective
policy has enlarged the opportunities of
all toilers to increase the value, .amount
and variety Of the results of such toil.
It is through the influence of the Re
publican party, and by reason of the en
couragement which our laws afford, that
America has become the home of the suc
cessful artificers of the world.
It was through the Republican party
that the flag of our country has been re
baptized and rededicated to the cause of
humanity, and It now typifies more than
ever before the greatness and glory of the
republic. It to-day stands as a symbol
of liberty in the Western World. Thus
this republic has advanced to the front
among the nations of the earth. Its
progress is chiefly noted by our increase
in population and in wealth, the intelli
gence of our people, and the achievements
of our army and navy. These have all
been a revelation to the people off Europe
and an inspiration to America. Among
civilians Lincoln stood at the head. All
in all. he was the greatest man this coun
try has produced since Washington. His
marvelous leadership was shown by his
confidence in his people. He knew he
could trust the people's average judg
ment. It was he who said, "You can fool
all the people some of the time and some
of the people all the time, but you can
not fool all the people all the time." He
never tried to fool the people at any
time. Moral courage was his most con
spicuous virtue; he was not afraid to do
right whatever might be the conse
quences. There was nothing sensational
in his character; he could look danger in
the face without fear or emotion ; he was
a patriot â
He loved his country be-ause it waa his own,
Nor cared to give aught other reason why.
His death left a nation in tears and the
whole world in sorrow. The Republican
party, formed through his commanding
influence, must continue in the lines he
marked out. It must continue as the
great "people's party" of this nation. It
cannot live alone by its traditions. We
live in the present; behind us is the im
perishable record of millions of free men
who represented the Intelligence, industry
and patriotism of this great nation; ahead
of us are the hopes of America's unborn
millions The past 1* safe, the future
alone is uncertain.
The present political campaign in Cal
ifornia has a national significance not so
much because we are
I to elect national offi
cers as from the grav
ity of the questions
involved in this con
test. The war with
SDain has emphasized
and nationalized the
present State election.
| Public opinion is being
formed to meet new
conditions. One of these new questions is,
"Shall we acquire territory ijing beyond
the limits of the continent?" The United
States has recently made a new departure
in this direction. For the first time, in the
history of- our country we have acquired
territory beyond the continent.
In the past, both by practice and tradi
tion, we have been an isolated people. Our

Spanish misrule in the West Indies until
that misrule violated every principle of
humanity; nor even then, until Ameri
can lives were taken and American prop
erty destroyed and our honor assailed by
the blowing up of the Maine. We found
from experience that neither life nor
property was safe in Cuba. The war with
Spain had thus become inevitable, and
that war has resulted in our taking Span-
ish territory, some of which we must
keep, all af which we may keep. Call It
conquest or what you may, we will re
tain what ye need.
If we r "' any territory back. Spain
will be in position where she can pun
ish her revolting colonies, and thus ren
der our war for humanity a failure and
turn our victory into defeat.
But if we retain the Philippine Islands
we have to assume the responsibilities
of . wisely governing
he people who live
here. They are a
it range people, not of
>ur o^-n race, and
:hey have no expcri
3nce in governing
themselves â all are
Asiatics. I am there
lore opposed to our
â etaining of the Phll
ipplan group more than the Island of
Luzon. This will furnish a coaling sta
tion for American shipping. This is all
#1 need, and all we have conquered. We
do not want any remote American States
whose population is not of our race.
It. is more than doubtful statesmanship
to attempt to Americanize a vast number
of people who have no sentiment of pa
triotism in common with our people.
Race distinctions cannot be remedied by
legislation or by any political action of
our home government. International
complications might, and doubtless
would, arise by reason of our attempted
control cf all of the Philippine Islands.
I say all because there are about 200 of
them which are inhabited, and it would
require American soldiers on every one
of th^rn to maintain government or se
cure pear".
Speaking 1 of the Philippine Islands,
Resident Archbishop Dosal recently said:
"I earnestly hope the islands will not
remain Spanish, because the rebels are
now so strong that such a course would
inevitably cause appalling bloodshed. The
reconquest of the natives is impossible
until after years of the most cruel war
fare."
Does America want years of war?

Americans, and It goes without saying
that an American who can govern him
self is capable of governing others. If
this were a question of government only,
we could successfully meet the new con
ditions thus presented. But the graver
problem of amalgamating so many peo
ple of another race with our American
family now confronts us. Speaking for
myself, I am opposed to this.
I know we cannot be a hermit longer;
that "in this age whatever stands still
recedes, whatever ceases to grow dies,"
and that all other great nations are
grasping lor territory, and so It seems
to be the present American sentiment,
and some think a wise one, too, that we
should, by taking *the Philippine Islands
and the people inhabiting them, get all
we can, but I would not imperil Ameri
can liberty at home by increasing our
population abroad.
The permanency of this republic may
depend upon the position assumed by our
Government In relation to the Philippine '
Islands.
It may be quite as dangerous for us to
ask too much from Spain as It woujd be
to accept too little. This" War has grati
fied out ambition, and excited our pride,
and it has advanced us to a new and
more commanding position among the
family of nations. Tl.et us not risk that
position by demanding what we cannot
afford to keep. We are great now both
as to war and as a financial power. We
Just floated a $2,000,000 loan among our
own people, and no one person was per
mitted to take more than $5000 worth of
the bonds, and even then we had more
than a billion of dollars subscribed. Theso
bonds are now selling at a premium.
In the near future the islands of the
great oceans will be our country's out
posts. In war they will form the skirmish
line of our army and navy; in peace they
will be the aentinel3 guarding our com
merce and protecting our flag.
Our cities are overflowing with a great
population, which must have employment
or public support, and the best way to
support them is to secure to them re
munerative employment at home and let
them support themselves. Our wealth
has accumulated faster than our oppor
tunities for good investments; our popu
lation is now -quite 75,000,000 people. We
should make no large additions to our
population except they are intelligent
people and of our own race. A vast
population is always a danger to a free
nation, so much- so, that for years many
thoughtful Americans have favored a
larger restraint upon European lmmigra-
I tion.
With these conditions confronting us at
home, what will be the effect if we in
crease our population by adding millions
of a foreign and unassimilated -ace to
our American population? We cannot
maintain the protective policy of our
party by adding a vast number of cheap
Asiatic laborers to our American family.

strength of this na
| tion and the wis

It was once said that "to gain empire
was easy and common, but to govern it
well was difficult and rare indeed." We
are now about to try the experiment of
"gaining new empire." We are entering
upon the uncertain and dangerous task of
"governing It welfc"
Fellow-citizens, we cannot lower the
standard of American citizenship and
long maintain Republican institutions in
America. It may oe, and possibly is* our
mission to control America, but we can
not go over to Asia and control those
Eeoples. War has its successes and its
efeatsâ let us not turn victory into "He
feat. A great victory may be more dan
gerous than a great defeat.
It is not the peril of war, nor Indeed the
unrest caused by political factions that
now endangers our country, but rather
the folly to which unrestrained ambition
may lead American diplomacy in its for
eign policy.
In the United States business success
or failure depends largely upon the busi
ness conditions which now from party
victories. Two years ago Mr. 1.-'.-ivinley
was elected President and a Republican
Congress was elected at the same time. A
new tariff law was passefi, and although
a war with Spain has since followed, and
thousands of men were called into the
army and navy and ceased to be pro
ducers, and the expense of the Govern
ment was greatly Increased, yet our ex
ports were never as much as this year.
In a word, the peole of this nation never
before sent abroad for sale such a large
amount of surplus products. This is the
crucial test of a nations prosperity; just
as much as it is a test of business success
when n farmer sends away from his farm
for sale double what he buys or brings
onto the farm for use.
I am quite aware our Democratic
friends may say that our great business
success arises from conditions they in
augurated. If this be so, how is it that
during the eight years Mr. Cleveland was
President we labored under business de
pression, while during the greater part of
the intervening four yean of President
Harrison's administration, and after the
passage o/ the Republican tariff bill, we
nad good times, and we now have a mark
ed recurrence of the same thing. The ef
fect of the Republican tariff legislation Is
especially noted by reference to the ex
ports and imports for the years c::ding
July 1 of 1R97 and 1593.
Tne following are the exports and Im
ports for those years:

Last year shows the largest surplus to
the credit of our country ever before at
tained in our history, and a much larger
surplus than any other nation can show

The construction of the Nicaragua ca
nal is a national necessity. It is said by
men of experience in
this matter that if we
had a war with any
Nicaragua canal
â¢would pay for itself in
aside from its use in
war it is invaluable to
the United State 3in
peace, because it would connect our ter
ritory on both sides of the continent and
would be of especial value to the Pacific
States. It is a mistake to build battle
ships to protect our coast and defend our
commerce, and at the same time not to
construct this canal. It is a greater mis
take to attempt to build up American
commerce and not provide the highways
over which that commerce shall move.
The Nicaragua canal is one of the great
est necessities of this age. Its construc
tion will not only unite two oceans, but
two continents, and it will shorten the
distance between both more than one
half. At present the people of the Pacific
side of this republic have no chance to
compete with our people living on the
Atlantic.
China, Japan, the Indies, Oceanica, and
all of that vast number of Pacific isl
ands, including Australia and New Zeal
and, will be brought nearer to the At
lantic side of America when this canal is
completed; the commerce of the Pacific
will be greatly increased, and thus we
*reap an immeasurable benefit.
much has been said in favor of this
t canal and so little against it that
is led to marvel why it has not been
built. The fact seems to be that for
eign nations do not build it for fear of
American diplomatic complications, and
America does not build it because she
can put it off. But the time is fast ap
proaching when we must cease this "dog
in the manger" policy. We must either
act or let some one else act. The whole
civilized world is interested, and further
delay on the part of our Government will
be dangerous to our future control of the
Kmerce of the Pacific Ocean,
t It be said, with bated breath if need
that the Southern Pacific Railroad
ioration opposes its construction. The
knowledge is .common to the public men
in and out of Washington that such is
Â»fact. Let us adopt the remedy pro
d by the Republican platformâ to
the money due the Government from
railroads and use it to build the ca
nal. This would be retributive justice.
The Republican platform on the subject
is as follows:
"The last Congress having unanimously
passed a law providing for the collection
Bie indebtedness due from the Central
Western Pacific railroads to the Gov
lent, the Republican party favors the
rcement thereof, and, unless such law
and all the provisions thereof be promptly
accepted and complied with by such spe
cified railroad companies, that the law be
strictly enforced and the lion on said
roads and properties be foreclosed and
said roads and mortgaged property be
sold according to law, and that all funds
that now or hereafter are realized from
either or both said Pacific railroads, or
from the collection of their debt to the
Government, whether voluntarily or by
foreclosure, be applied to the construction
of the Nicaragua' canal."
The silver problem, which two year 3
ago disturbed the American business
world, nas, for the
present at least, set
tled itself, and there
can be no reason for
that question entering"
into nolitical discus
sions this year, for the
amount of money in
circulation is most
This question haa
been largely settled through the meilium
of Republican tariff legislation. That is
to say, since the Republican protective
tariff laws went into effect we only im
port about three-fourths of the amount
we imported under former tariff condi
tions; for instance, for the hscal year
ending July 1, 1897, under the Democratic
tariff laws our imports were $7>>4,730.412,
while for the fiscal year ending July,
18J*8. under the Republican tariff act. our
imports were only $615,324,791; and this was
in war times when our foreign demands
were largely increased.
The result of tias is that our exports
have greatly exceeded our imports, and,
when this occurs, money flows into the
country. Foreign peoples are paying us
more money than we are paying them,
thus our money for home circulation i 3
increased because we do not have to send
it abroad. We do not need to increase
R- mintage of silver to increase our cir
ation of money. Thus in America,
h our present trade conditions anu for
home purposes, a silver dollar, a pa
dollar and a gold dollar has to-day
same value. Our protective laws and
de conditions have, for the present at
least, settled the great monetary ques
tion so recently disturbing our country.
As our population increases the labor
problem becomes of the most serious mo
ment, . and that* party which offers the
most and best opportunities for labor
serves the country best.
Taking the month of March of the two
years of 1895 and 189S as a test, we find
that in the former year the Wilson bill,
a Democratic tariff measure, was in full
operation. It appears by an official ex
amination of 2229 manufacturing estab
lishments situated in different States, that
in the month of March. 1895. there w<2.-e
employed 204,580 men who received wages
In the aggregate of 17,049.323 34; for the

after, the same establishments employed
exactly 269,329 hands and paid them $10.

It must be seen that protective laws do
protect, and thÂ«t they protect labor
against all unfair foreign competition,
and they sustain the prior of labor, and,
therefore, protective laws protect the
laborer and thereby benefit the people,
because the workers are a large majority
of the people.
The protective theory is the Republican,
theory of government; the free trade
theory is the Democratic theory of gov
ernment. The protective theory gives an
advantage to the producer rather than
to the consumer; the: free trade theory
benefits the consumer at the expense of
the producer, and as the people who have
means are the chief consumers, and the
people who have nothing but their labor
as capital are the chief producers, it
should be the policy of the. Government
to sustain the producer and let the con
sumer buy what he needs of his neigh
bor who produces. It may be said that
the protective policy should apply with
equal force to the men who produce and
to the thing produced, and this is an ad

My Fellow Citizens: I wish to say. in
the most emphatic terms, that in speak-;
ing of Mr. Maguire, 'l speak of his princi
ples and not of him personally.' I could
not say an unkind thine of him if I
tried. I believe him to be an honest man.
I am opposed to his election because I
think his principles are wrong.
Maguire is a single taxer. He has al
ways been an enthusiast upon this sub
ject, yet when given
the nomination by the
Democratic party, and
when called upon to
declare himself upon
this question, he said
in effect that "his
position as Governor
would . give him no
power whatever to put
these theories â¢ into
practice,'" and his sponsors in the Demo
cratic party say the same thing; but his
. Populistic friends; say that they believe
in these principles of single tax, and they
are for him because he Delieves in them
also.
The question as to what this single tax
-means can be answered thus: "It Is that
land shall bear the whole tax for the
â¢support. of the Government; that neither
the improvements on land, money nor
other personal property shall be taxed. ,
This is the kernel of the whole doctrine.
The result, would be, that the personal
property and the improvements on real
property, including the buildings, grades,
tracks and bridges of the railroads, the
money in bank, the pawnbrokers, and all
other people dealing, in or handling per
sonal property, would "not aid In the
slightest degree in supporting the Gov
ernment, while the man with a little home
would be trebly taxed for that purpose.
The farmer with small holdings, who can
now illy afford to pay taxes, would then
be compelled to pay three or four times
as much taxes as he now pays. If it
be true, as Mr. Maguire says, that ex
cessive taxes would impoverish the rich
land holders and thus compel them to
Bell their land, would it not destroy every
poor man in the State before it reached
the pockets of the rich; would It .not im
peril the home life of the masses of the
people, because a poor man could not own
a 'home?' â  â¢' .'
This is the most unwise theory of taxa
tion promulgated since the French revolu
tion. This theory of taxation was first
advanced by one Francois Quesnay t a
Frenchman, but neither his own country
nor any other civilized country has ever
been foolish enough to adapt it. Imagine
the effect that such a policy would have
upon the business interests of the State!
Money itself would have no safe security
and no loans would be made, on land.
Land is the basis of all property values,
and when land has.no value then, money
would be insecure and business confidence
would be destroyed. Personal property
would lose its value because real prop
erty, the foundation. of wealth, would be
valueless. s
In order to promote the wishes of Mr.
Maguire the Democratic State Convention
either wittingly or unwittingly adopted
the following plank in their platform: .
" "We favor a constitutional amendment
abolishing the poll tax, and giving to
counties and munici
pal corporations the
right to adopt and
change their system
of taxation ' for local
purposes whenever a
majority of the people
of any such county or
municipality shall so
determine. We favor
,t, t the adoption of State
Constitutional Amendment ' No. 10. now
pending, giving the right of local self
government to the counties of the State.'-
This amendment, on its face, is appar
ently for a good purpose; and it bears the
ear marks of advancing the public good.
but when we remember that, In the Ex
aminer of November 6. 1596, Mr. Maguire
used the following language: .*
"Already the single taxers demand that
practical effort be commenced immediate
ly to force the issue into politics in Cali
fornia. The Legislature will be asked at
its next session to submit to the voters
a constitutional amendment remitting the
whole question of taxation for State,
county and municipal purposes to the
Legislature, as a first step toward a sin
gle tax. The moment that amendment is
submitted the battle will be on in earn
est."
It will be seen that in the language of
Mr. Maguire himself "the battle will bo
on in earnest" when the. Legislature
meets. And the question that confronts
the people of California is not so much
whether Maguire or Gage shall be elected
as whether the single tax craze shall pre
vail in California, and all 1 values of prop
erty be thus unsettled, if not practically
destroyed. -
* Do the people of this State wish to place
in the -most exalted position in their gift
â¢a man entertaining these views? Can
the people afford to Bet the seal of their
approval upon the single tax proposition,
as they would do if they elected its most
earnest and able exponent to the position
of Governor?
If Mr. Maguire thinks wrong, on this
subject will he not think wrong on other
subjects? It Is absurd to Pay that he can
do no harm because he entertains these
views, because if he is elected' Governor,
and a Democratic and Populistlc Legis
lature is elected also, then through the
Governor's influence the organic law of
the State can be changed to meet the
wishes of the Governor, and the initial
step has been taken In the Democratic
platform, before quoted. If the majority
of the people are in favor of a man for <
Governor this year who Is for single tax
only, why should they not sustain the
Fame policy next year? Thus this elec
tion Is the test of the strength of this pol
icyâthe issue becomes single tax or no
Bingle tax. protection of property rights
or destruction of all values in landed
property. â¢.â¢*--<â â â¢ â¢â¢" â¢ '
My fellow-citizens, on the railroad ques
tion the Democracy is making its usual
flank movement by pointing to the
Republicans and charging that party
with being- dominated by railroad poli
tics. It is a historical fact that for six
teen years past the Democracy have
never won- a single State contest that
they have "hot gained by railroad influ
ence, and during â  that time they have
been in power three of the four terms.
It is known to every public man, Dem
ocrat or Republican, that the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company has for many
years tried to control the politics of this
State, Its vast influence and : unlimited
capital is used in politics full as much as
in business. . It places money ahead of
men and its own greed In advance of
public morals. ' If this thing Is longer
permitted to continue It will imperil alike
the rights of liberty and property: it is
a menace to. the republic, and good men
of all parties should unite in defeating
its influence.
. This year the railroad company is un
der, special obligations to the Democratic
party. It never suc
ceeded In getting a
refunding bill through
Congress until a Dem
ocrat drew It, and
then every Democrat
ic United States Sen
ator supported. It;
and now, alas! the
Democratic j candidate
;- , for Governor Is mak
ing political capital out of the fact that
he opposed that measure in the House
of Representatives.- But this was done
at a. time when his opposition could do
neither good nor harm.
The political- power of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad corporation increases as
new and additional favors are extended
to it. With all its railroad mileage and
Its vast business Interests it Is a politi
cal machine. It is a, "power within the
Government.greater than the Government
itself. It is now entering upon both State
and national politics, and all parties
should unite in opposition to its nefarious

rather than. "How are the people pleased

could thus hope to control both sides and

Truth About
the
Railroad.
The officers of the Southern Pacific Rail
road say they are in politics to defend
their property. "What are the undeniable
Cactfl as to these matters?
First â The railroads are worth millions,
and they were made so by the bounty of.
the people. It is admitted that these
companies own the railroads regardless of
the fact that they got them for nothing,
and that they are entitled to the same
protection that the law gives to other peo
ple and to other property, and to no more.
Secondâ That neither the Governor, nor
the State Legislature of California, nor
the members of the House of Representa
tives, nor the United States Senators from
California could destroy or take away
from these corporations their ownership
of this property If they trjed to do it,
and they have not and will not try to do
it. Therefore, the real purpose of hav
ing partial friends in Congress, or in any
other department qf the general Govern
ment, is to get more money from the
Government than is justly due "he rail
road company or to pay the Government
less money than is honestly due it.
. Thirdâ ln State affairs there is no more
reason for the railroad's interference In
politics in order to protect Its property
rights than for the interference of any
other citizen. It is a travesty on justice
if they can havu their personal friends on
the Railroad Commission, a judicial body,
or on the Board of Equalization, a semi
judicial body, or in any other branch of
the State government. This is unfair to
al! other citizens. Compare the conduct
of the railroad corporations with the other
rich people and rich corporations in this
State.
The time was in California, when Flood
and O'Brien, Mackay and Fair, were said
to be worth more than
a hundred million
dollars. They were
certainly among the
richest men on tne
coast, and some of
their capital was in
vested in railroads,
yet they never inter
fered in politics. D. O.
MillÃ.who Is one of the
richest men in California, never asked for
political favors, and he is interested in
railroads also; nor has the Bank of Cali
fornia, the Bank of Nevada or the Hi
bernia Savings and Loan Society. Ail
three are great monetary corporations;
the latter in said to hv one of the richest
Institutions of its kind in America. Tney
did not aak to be treated differently from
other people; they did not demand tnat
the Bank Commissioners be appointed
in their Interests or Assessors selected ue
cause they were friendly to them.
California never was unfair to the rail
roads. The people of California have al
ways, and will always, deal justly by
capital and capitalists.
To illustrate the railroad power, we
need but refer to James Bryce, a member
of the English Parliament and an author
of world-wide reputation, who in his
"American Commonwealth," at page 653,
volume 2, in speaking of the great West
ern railway magnates, graphically says:
"These railway kings are among vie
great men, perhaps I may say the great
est men, in America. They have wealth,
else they could not hold their position.
They have fame, for every one has heard
of their achievements; every newspaper
chronicles their movements. They have
power, more powerâ that Is, more oppor
tunity of making their personal will pre
vailâthan perhaps any one in political
life, except the President and the Speak
er, who after all hold theirs for four
years and two years, while the railroad
monarch may keep his for life. When tne
master of one of the great Western rail
way lines travels toward the Pacific on
his palace car his journey is like a royal
progress. Governors of States and Terri
tories bow before him; Legislatures re
ceive him in solemn session; cities seek
to propitiate him, for has he not me
means of making or marring a city's
fortunes?"
Many years ago Mr. Lincoln in a speech
made in Springfield, 111., quoting from tne
Scriptures, said: "A house divided
against Itself cannot 3tand," and he add
ed, "A nation divided against itself can
not standâ this nation cannot remain part
slave and part free." If Mr. Lincoli* hail
been gifted with the spirit of prophecy he
could not have said a truer thing. Here
and now I venture to add that "a State
divided against itself cannot stand," and
any State government is divided against
Itself when corporations control or cor
rupt State politics. We are part slave
and part free when tfce many are con
trolled by the few.
Said a United States Senator in a
speech made in the Senate some years
ago. referring to the Pacific Railroad
companies:.
"They have but one ruls of policyâ first
employ all means to convince; failing In
that, then all moans to crush. â¢ â¢ â¢
Their agents and attorneys and lobbyists
swarm in our corridors, block the way to
our committee rooms and set spies upbn
our actions."
The Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany politically destroys those it cannot
control. For full twenty-five years the
Central and Southern Pn Tic Railroad
corporations have followed, with persist
ent bitterness, every pul lie man and
every newspaper that has had the inde
pendence to tell the truth about them,
and they have slandered out of public
life all those who did this. Note the old
Sacramento Union, Governor Haight,
Governor Newton Booth, Senator A. A.
Sargent and many others who might bo
named.
They often herald the fact that they
support certain candidates at nominating
conventions when they do not. ThL* is
done to make the candidates feel they
will be under obligations to them If eltci
od. They openly declare they control
from 12.000 to ir.,000 votes in this Stateâ
rm-n in their employ. If this be true, H
If a humiliating and disgraceful thing
to admit, and the people must make a
new Declaration of Independence. This
question arises above party. It reaches
the honor of all men of all parties.
If these conditions continue it may be
that the question will ultimately come,
whether or Dot the Government will have
to own the railroads. It will be safer for
the Government to own the railroads
than for the railroads to own the Gov
ernment.
\W maintain that the political power
of the republic must rest with the people
and not with the
money of the people;
that the ballot must
represent men and
not dollars; that
American manhood
cannot be bartered
away by corporate in
fluence without en
dangering the repub
lic; that the same
law which governs one man must govern
all men alike; and we demand that the
people shall do their own voting, and
that the railroad rompanl.-s shall not be
permitted to control the votes of their em
ployes; that intlmidaticvn and menace
shall not be political factors in California
politics.
In 1832. General Jackson, when he
vetoed the bank bill, used the following
significant language, which has a pecu
liar application to the present subject:
"In the full enjoyment of the gifts of
heaven and the fruits of superior Indus
try, every man is equally entitled to
protection by lav/. But when the laws
undertake to add to these just advan
tages and natural gifts artificial distinc
tions; to grant titles, gratuities and ex
clusive privileges; to mjtke the rich richer
and the potent more powerful, the hum
ble members of societyâ the farmers, me
chanics and laborers â who have neither
the 4ime nor the means of securing like
favors to themselves, have a rignt to
complain of the injustice of their Govern
ment."

'ftie position of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company In California politics
reminds me of Peggy's advice to little
Paul, in Bulwer-Lytton'B novel of "Paul
I Clifford." That precious dame was de
sirous of teaching Paul to steal, and Bhe
eaid to him: "If you wants what's not
your own, try to do without it; if you
can't do without it, take it by inslniva
tlon, not by bluster; they as swindles
gets more and risks less than they as
robs."
It Is no criticism upon the honor, virtue
or intelligence of the people of California
to say that the railroad corporations con
trol political conventions or elections in
this State. The masses of the people here,
as elsewhere in America, are honest, and
the rank and file of all parties is honest.
But the railroad's manipulators are al
ways organized â the people never. Our
rural population is sparse and widely
scattered over the State; our industrial
classes are busy in honest pursuits and
thry have no time to devote to political
contests, and so that corporation which
controls such vast business interests,
reaching every town in the State, and
which has no competition or opposition,
can, and easily does control the politics
of the State, unless the people shall unite
against it. ,
I cannot close without saying a word
for the State ticket.

BONNET'S INITIAL SPEECH.
The Democratic Candidate for Sher-
iff Charms a Large Audience.
Theodore F. Bonnet, Democratic nom
inee for Sheriff, delivered his maiden cam
paign speech last night before the Forty
third Assembly District Democratic Club.
His effort received the enthusiastic com
mendation of the large gathering, which,
undeterred by the rain, tilled California
Hall. Every point that Mr. Bonnet made,
and they were many, was delivered with
great earnestness and his oratory was re
warded by frequent applause. He was
Introduced by Chairman R. P. Hooe, and
after the applause had subsided, began
his speech. Mr. Bonnet said it was his
initial attempt, but that he had been in
training for the occasion and was rapidly
rounding into form. Ho spoke of his
promise to the Democratic convention
that he would not be hard to find during
the campaign and stated that he was
keeping his promise by appearing before
the club.
"I appreciate the fact that this district
is a Republican one," he said, "but the
five hundred members of the Forty-third
District Club will roll up a majority for
our ticket in November next."
The speaker then called attention to the
important office of Sheriff. He told of the
drawing 6f juries, and what a dangerous
power it â %ws in the hands of a corrupt
man. The insolvency business that occu
pies that official's attention was also
dwelt upon, and Mr. Bonnet assured all
that If elected to the important office he
would do everything honorably and in a
way that would meet with the approval
of the people of this city.
Mr. Bonnet's closing sentence was the
signal for renewed cheering and hand
clapping. He left shortly after to con
quer new audiences. The Golden Gate
quartet and James Donohue furnished
vocal music during the evening. The lat
ter's original parody on "He'll Be Faith
ful to You" caught the fancy of the
crowd, and he was repeatedly 'encored.
William BE. Hinton, John P. Dunne, Ar
thur Mack, J. Bowlan and James H.
Barry followed In quick order and made
short addresses. Liquid refreshments
and sandwiches did much toward holding
the crowd until the end of the meeting.
The officers of the club are: R. P. Hooe,
president: W. Abbott, first vice presi
dent; J. McGuire, second vice president;
R. C. Scott, recording secretary; J. Bow
lan, corresponding secretary, and T. Ka
naley, sergeant at arms.

and Neff Club of the Twenty-ninth As
sembly District was held Friday evening

CONGRESSMAN LEWIS
SPEAKS FOR MAGDIRE
He Warmly Defends the Course of His
Former Colleague in the Halls
of Congress.
Lewis Declared in a Speech at Metropolitan Hall Tbat
Republicans Now Claim Credit for the War Because
They Have No Other Issue.
Despite the heavy rainstorm a large
and enthusiastic audience gathered in
Metropolitan Hall last nipht to listen to
Congressman James Hamilton Lewis
discuss the political issues of the day as
viewed by him from a Democratic stand
point. Lewis is a ready and pleasant
speaker and frequently during his address
he was warmly applauded.
The meeting was held under the
auspices of the Union Campaign Com
mittee, consisting of representatives from
the Democratic, Populist and Silver Re
publican parties. It was caJled to order
by William P. Lawlor, who announced
that Frank H. Gould would act as chair
man. Gould, in a brief address, said that
the Republican party was endeavoring to
impress on the minds of the voters that
the successful war just terminated with
Spain was a Republican war, and that
to that party is due all the laurels won.
"They say it was a Republican war,"
said he, "but who was at the heau of the
gallant First California Regiment? That
sterling and tried Democrat, Jim Smith. "
The name of Smith was cheered, and
when a few minutes later Gould men
tioned the name of Secretary Alger there
were hisses. The names of Sampson,
Dewey, Schley and Hobson were applaud
ed, and when the speaker referred to that
"sterling American and Democrat," Fitz
hugh Lee, the audience rose and again
cheered. In conclusion, Gould urged all
his hearers to support James G. Maguire
in his candidacy for Governor, "For by
his election," said he, "you will drive
corruption forever from our midst."
After several vocal selections by the
Prees Club Quartet, William Craig, the
Democratic-Populist candidate for Con
gress from the Fourth District, was in
troduced.
"The war has taught us one great ob
ject lesson," he said, "and that is when
our fla,g is in peril the American people
stand as one man. The late war with
Spain was not a Republican war nor was
it a Democratic war. It was a war by
the united people of these United States
and the American nation stands out io
day before the world as it never stood be
fore."
Craig then closed with the declaration
that the nomination of Maguire was an
open act of defiance to the corporations
and monopolists.
James H. Barry, in resp:>n*e to re
geated calls, said that he would be u;ia
le to make any extended speech, 'as be
was suffering from hoarseness. After ex
pressing a hope that he would meet Con
gressman Lewis at Washington, he brief
ly' eulogized the fusion ticket and with
drew.
Congressman Lewis was heartily greet
ed when he was Introduced as the speaker
of the evening. He said that he deeply
appreciated the generous reception ae.
corded him. and that it was only another
evidence of the boundless hospitality of
the people.
"I feel that I am almost one of you,"
said he, "and that is only natural, xhe
interests of your State affoct the inter
ests of my State, for all the States on
the Pacific Slope are bound by a common
tie. Whatever evils may beset you, or
whatever wrongs may follow, the same
must also attach to the people of my
State. I come to you in the garb of a
neighbor and friena to pay a small but
sincere tribute to my friend, James G.
Maguire."
The crowd again cheered. When Lewis
proceeded he said that he had carefully
watched the course of Maguire in Con
gress and had always found him advo
cating and fearlessly fighting for what he
believed to be right.
"1 could not be else than recreant to my
heart," he continued, "if I did not speak
In his behalf to-night. Since I have been
here I have occasionally seen in the pa
pers charges that Congressman Maguire
had been neglectful of his duty. In fact,
a distinguished gentleman announced
from this platform a few ni?litÂ« ago that
Congressman Maguire had frequently left
his post of duty to go off to New York
and Delaware to deliver lectures. The
Republican candidate is also making
similar charges. In answer to both gen
tlemen I ask them to show by the record
any Instance where Maguire was absent
at rollcall when matters of national in
terest were Involved."
The speaker then said that the Repub
lican party was claiming the credit of the
war, as it had nothing else to stand
upon. "Where has a single declaration
in the national platform been complied
with? One of the principal promises they
made was the reformation of the cur
rency. All parties admitted the necessity
for such reformation, but held different
ideas as how to reach it. What did the
Republicans do? They sent a committee
to England to confer on the currency
question, and before its members arrived
in London there was a cablegram await
ing them there inmructing them to re
turn. Where is the promised reform in
the system of banking and currency?
Where is the promised law regulating the
hours of toil? Will the Republicans diÃ
pute the fact that when such a bill passed
the House it was defeated in the Senate?
When the bill Introduced striking at labor
organizations and making it criminal for
men to look for their rights, why did the
agents of the Associated Press not tele
graph it broadcast? It seems there must
have been some influence at work. I sup
pose that it is because Congressman Ma
guire fought against this infamous bill
that was an assault on the rights and lib
erty of the poor that he is now called an
anarchist."
The speaker then said that the same
narrow-minded band of partisans delib
erately Insulted ' Commodore Schley' five
times when they voted down a bill giv
ing hin> credit for his heroic work.
"When Hobson was mentioned for pro
motion," said he, "he was accorded tne
same treatment by these ghouls.'\
Then Lewis spoke at length on the in
justice of the charge that the Democrats
had refused to give support to the Presi
dent on war measures. He said that the
Democrats had upheld the hands of the
President in his every act. He admitted,
however, that they had objected to a so
called war revenue bill that meant add
ing to the burdens of the poor.
"The Democrats did object to placing
a tax of ten cents a pound on tea and
five cents on a bottle of champagne. In
stead of placing the tax on the shoulders
of those who would be able to stand it
they placed it on the shoulders of the
poor. I was with Maguire and was one
of the men who fought the unjust meas
ure. If he is an anarchist then so am
In conclusion, Lewis said that the isl
lands taken from Spain should be held,
"for when the body of our first brave
soldier was put under the sod, his blood
consecrated the soil to America."
He expressed a firm conviction, how
ever, that the Philippines would not be
held. He said that the capitalists who
hold $400,000,000 worth of Spanish bonds,
threatened to sue the United States if
Porto Rico was attacked. He said that
they would use every possible influence
to have the islands held under the pro-
tectlon of the United States, until they
could get their bonds redeemed or Spain
could get herself in, position to hold the
insurgents in check.
MACHINISTS NEEDED
AT MARE ISLAND
Skilled Workmen May Obtain Em
ployment in Several Depart-
ments at the Yard.
VAL.LEJO, Sept. 24.â There are now 1750
men employed at Mare Island. Requisi
tions are constantly being made for more
but they cannot be obtained. Good ma
chinists and riggers' are wanted and work
men in several other departments can ob
tain employment.
Work on the Yorktown is nearing com
pletion. Owing to the scarcity of riggers,
it will be some time before her standing
rigging is in place. The Yorktown's rig
ging is in the loft and will be taken to
the ship next week. Her new masts were
stepped yesterday and the ship joiners are
building a new chart house. The Hart
ford's oollers have been placed in the
hold nf the ship and are boing covered
with magnesia, a non-conductor of heat.
They will be practically completed in a
couple of weeks, though it will be some
months before the engines are ready. The
Rangor is ready to receive her engine and
boilers, which will be hoisted aboard in
about ten days. The work of repairing
the ship will go ahead rapidly from this
time on, as she is wanted next after the
Yorktown.
The Adams is nearly completed, and
with the exception of her battery will be
ready for her crew of naval apprentices
within a week. Commander B. P. Tilley
has been ordered to command her. The
battery will consist of modern rapid-lire
guns, six four-inch, six sixpounders, two
one-pounders and two Colt machine
guns.
The Albatross Is still at Mare Island,
where she will be thoroughly overhauled
before going on duty for the Fish Com
mission.
BORN WITH THE CENTURY.
Mrs. Mary Cummings Merrill Dies at
the Age of 98.
HEALDSBURG, Sept. 24.â Mrs. Mary
Cumminga Merrill, widow of the late An
drew Merrill, died at the home of her
youngest daughter, Mrs. D. G. Jewett, In
this city, on September 18, In her ninety
eighth year. She was born with the cen
tury in Albany, Me., and was the mother
of eight children, six of whom are now
living. She has also numbered among
her descendants grand and great grand
children.
"Grandma" Merrill was justly proud of
her ancestors, tracing them back to the
early days of American history; and her
wonderful memory recalled incidents oc
curing during her lifetime. Her sister
was one of the first woman missionaries
to India.
The personal appearance of Mrs. Mary
Merrill was striking. Of commanding
height and dignity of manner, she im
pressed all with her worth and attain
ments. In her youth the obtaining- of an
education was accomplished with toil and
energy. She obtained hers by borrowing
the money for an academy course., which
she repaid by teaching. She laughingly
related that one mode of studying was
by attaching her book to her spinning
wheel.
During the last few years of her life
her mental and physical strength was
wrecked by a paralytic blow, and for
days and months her mind wandered
back to the sunny paths of youth.

Spervisor Ed Smith was a strong favor
ite in the light for the shrievalty nomina

would not accept the nomination nor any
other place on the ticket. The fact i*s
that Smith is a very sick man, and his
physicians have advised him to take a
much-needed rest. They feared the ex
citement that accompanies a campaign
would have a very serious effect on him.
With the withdrawal of Smith came the

PLYLEIt'S SECOND TRIAL.
Two Sensational Incidents in Court
at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 24.â 1n the second
trial of George F. Plyler for mayhem
there were several sensational incidents
to-day. The first was the demand made
by J. H. Skirm. one of the attorneys for
the prisoner, that E. W. Brawn, editor of
the Evening Record, be cited to appear for
contempt on the ground that hp had writ
ten articles prejudicial to the defendant's
interest. The order was made citing the
editor to appear on October 1, but It will
not be served until the attorney makes
an affidavit covering the allegations.
The second incident occurred just as the
court adjourned. Chief of Police Kid
ward, who was called by the defense to
testify to Plyler's character, was asked
by the attorney as to what the people
had said about Plyler after the commis
sion of the crime. The Chief related what
he had heard. This wns not compliment
ary to Plyler, who became excited. As
Kidward passed him he remarked within
the hearing of the jurors that he would
give $15 for every person the Chief could
produce who would say what the latter
testified had been told to him. Judge
Smith peremptorily ordered Plyler to be
taken back to jail.
Joseph Harveston, the ex-Constable,
who was brought from San Quentin to
testify, it was thought by many would
make a confession, but he did not add
anything new to what he had testified to
at Plyler's first trial.
The defense introduced witnesses to tes
tify as to the prisoner's character and
to show that he was insane over the dis
covery of his wife's relations with Charles
Harris. The case was continued until
Monday.

BRIGHTER THAN SEARCHLIGHT
SUCCESSFULLY TESTED BY THE

Â»
As "Lord and King of the Land"
Emperor William Talks at the
Opening of Stettin's New
Harbor.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Sept. 24.â A new and highly
important invention was tested at the
German naval maneuvers ending this
w- ,-k. It was in the shape of a Greek-
Phoenician fire, invented by a Berlin
engineer. It ignites on contact with
the air or water and cannot be
quenched by either water or earth. It
burns # w ith a brillia.it llame, exceeding
big searchlights, and it can be sunk
under water or under ground and when
brought to the surface instantly bursts
into flame at any desired point. It was
tested during the night evolutions off
the island of Heligoland, and proved
most efficient in detecting the presence
of the enemy.
Emperor William visited Stettin yes
terday to open the new harbor. During
the course of a speech which he de
livered his Majesty said:
"Our future lies on the water, and I,
as lord and King of the land, express
gratitude to you for having brought
Stettin to this degree of prosperity. 1
hope, expect and might also say 1 de
mand of you development at the same
rate of progress."
Work has been commenced on the
new mammoth dock at the Imperial
ship yards at Kiel. It will be 550 feet
long and 65 feet deep. It is intended to
dock large ironclads of the Kaiser
Friederich type.
The Chamber of Commerce of Ham
burg has taken up the fight in behalf
of American pork. Published statistics
show there has not been a single case
of trichinosis in Prussia or Hamburg
due to American pork for fifteen years.
The report concludes:
"While these facts are not disproved,
and the statements as to the adultera
tion of American lard are uncorrobor
ated, evidence has been found showing
that all the repressive measures against
foreign â and especially against Ameri
can â meats must be held to be un
' reasonable and as gravely injuring
German economics."
The entire press of Hamburg, ex
cept the Hamburger Nachrichten, sup
ports these statements, and the entire
Liberal press Is beginning to agitate the
matter in view of the ever-increasing:
price of meat.
The Vorwaerts publishes a report of

steadily increasing throughout Ger

cialism was ur.kno'wn. The campaign
of the socialists cost 200,000 marks. The
spreading of pamphlets proved most
successful, and the socialistic press
now comprises sixty-eight political pa

Interesting Proceedings by Which

Brought Before the Vot
ing Public. i
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 24.
The Democratic County Convention was
held hero to-rlay, and one of the net re
nults is that fusion has been accepted,
though with a bad grace and only after
the Democrats, disgusted with the ac
tions of the Populists, decided early this
evening to enter into an agreem.-nt only
with the Silver Republicans. Somewhat
later, With exceeding bad grace, a PopuÂ»
list delegation appeared and said they
w^re at last satisfied to accept the con
ditions.
Too many hard things, however, had
been said by Robert Fitzgerald, Ex-Con
cressnian English, Attorney Gaxrity and
Alex Rosborough about the "Populists
and dissatisfied Republicans" to hope for
peace, so fusion, in a repudiated and nau-
Beoua form, was swallowed with a wry
face by the convention.
K. M. Fitzgerald, chairman of the fu
sion committee, at 6:30 o'clock returned
to the convention hall with the Informa
tion that he was unable to find any trace
of the Populist fusion committee and was
tired of waiting. Fitzgerald tneu stated
that the Populists desired either the
County Clerk or Sheriff, wnich would not
be allowed by the Democrats. Tne Silver
Republicans had agreed to fuse provid
ing they were allowed the Assessor, Tax
Collector, one City Justice and the nam
ing of the physician for the Coroner, xhia
.Mtzgerald announced was agreed to
Warren English moved that a full Dem
ocratic ticket be nominated. Logan i
amended so that the report of the con
terence committee be adonted The !
amendment prevailed, and thereby the I
Democrats and silver Republicans fused !
turning out the Populists
Nominations for Sheriff were then called I
for and It brought out the old trouble
between the Laymance and the Fitz
gerald wings. Tne first nomination was
made by Thomas Garrity, who proposed
Patrick O'Kane. O'Kane withdrew. J
i MoLeod was nominated by the Fltz
ferald wing. Warren English nominated
homas Landregan and Thomas Garrity
seconded. R. M. Fitzgerald seconded Me-
Leod s nomination in a warm speech.
This brought Garrity to his feet He
declared McLeod had been a citizen less
than two years. A great uproar followed,
after which Fitzgerald threw back a hot
shot. Half a dozen delegates were on
their feet at once and each nomination
was numerously seconded. On roll call
the vote stood: Landregan 91. McLeod
77. This was a turndown for Fitzgerald,
but he took his defeat gracefully by hav
ing Landregan's nomination made by ac
clamation.
M. F. Tarpey took the floor and nom
inated Thomas C. Stoddard of Alameda
for County Clerk. Stoddard was nom
inated by acclamation. At this point a
Populist delegation presented itself and
accepted all the conditions imposed upon
the party by the Democrats, though they
swallowed the pill with bad grace. They
asked for the Public Administrator, Dis
trict Attorney, County Treasurer, one
Constable in Oakland Township, one Jus
t!ff of the Peace in Brooklyn Township
and one Justice of the Peace in Oakland
Township. This report was adopted and
fusion was completed.
G. W. Stimpson and A. T. McDonough
v*re nominated for Recorder. A .icDon
ough won by a vote of 107 to 59.
The chair announced at this time that
the SilvÂ«-r Republicans had nominated
Henry Dalton for Assessor. This brought
"W urrf-n Knglish to hiu feet with ii de
nunciation of such action and an ap
peal to the Democrats not to allow them-
Belvos to be prostituted by having a gold
bug Republican forced down their
tfc mats.
"i auk you as Democrats, as Silver Re
publicans and us Populists not to allow
this to he <lor><- " declared Em* lish. He
then moved the reconsideration of the
agreement with the Silver Republicans.
M. F. Tarpey rriMlo a red hot speech,
threatening' to walk out of the conven
tion if th<; agreement was not lived up
to. A motion to lay English's motion
upon the table prevailed. A motion that
the secretary cast the ballot w*h. upon
roll call, carried by a vote of 88 to 77.
Populist Treasurer O. M. Sanford was in
dorsed. T. O. Crawford was nominated
by acclamation for Superintendent of
Schools. George Beck was chosen for
Auditor. O. A. I,ane, Populist nominee
f.ir Tax Collector, and J. N. Manson, Pop

Nearly an hour after the appointed
time for calling the Democratic conven
tion to order to-day Chairman Brosnahan
of the Democratic County Central Com
mittee called for order and M. F. T-irpey

A. F. St. Sure of Alameda thought it
well to appoint at once a fusion or confer
ence committee of five, including the
chair. His motion was seconded by R.
M. Fitzgerald. James Hennoberry thought
It more to the point to ascertain ilrst if
the convention desired to fuse. Accord
ingly the motion was amended to cover
Henncberry's suggestion so that the con
vention would have the privilege of debat
ing the proposition.
The chairman declared he had no inter
est In Â«he matter. He thou~^t it due the
Populists at least that they should be met
by a committee from the Democratic
convention. The te was taken on the
amendment as to whether or not a com
mittee should be named to confer with
the Populists. The amendment was with
drawn and the original question was put
and carried. The chair named as the
committee on fusion R. H. Fitzgerald
(chairman), John Christie. John E. Geary,
F. W. Vogt and M. F. Tarpey.
Hour after hour passed away and still
the fusion committee could arrive at no
decision wltWhe Ponulists and Silver Re
publicans. Th% other committees were
ready to report, and the platform with
a long appendix of resolutions was ac
cepted without dehate.
The platform indorsed "the historic
principles of the Democracy as enuncia
ted in its platforms, both national and
State," the manly and fearless course of
Hon. James G. Maguire while in Con
gress, and confidently commended him
as a statesman worthy the confidence
and leadership of a free people. The wise,
economic and able administration of Gov
ernor Budd. "who has been true to his
promises, faithful to the people. result-
Ing in an unexampled saving to the over
burdened taxpayers of this State," was
also commended.
Other planks in the platform were-
M c demand the enactment of such a primary
law as will make bosstFm impossible and pre
vent the disgraceful practices whlrh character
ized the primaries recently held in this county
by the Republican party, and to this end we
pledge our nominees to the Legislature.
We pledge our nominees for the Legislature I
to vote for the approval of all charters adopted
by sister cities. |
We are heartily In favor of all competing i
railway lines and we pledge nur nominees to
use every honorable endeavor to secure for
Oakland the terminal of the Valley road and all >
competing lines.
Tnxatinn should be limited to the needs iif
government, economically administered, and
while we believe that the general welfare of
the people should be amply protected, we pledge
our nomtnees to close economy and conscien
tious discharge of duty In the administration
of public office and the expenditures of public
moneys.
We believe in the public school system and
in maintaining the same at a high grade of
efficiency, but we are convinced that as at
present administered, there is too much of
theory and not enough of practical in its !
operation. Brain work and hand work are of 'â¢
equal importance in the economy of govern- I
ment. We therefore favor the establishment I
and maintenance of schools of Industrial art '
as a part of our public school system.
We congratulate our citizens upon the heroic
conduct of our army and navy in the war just
closed, and we denounce the effort now being
made by the Republican party to absorb the
glories of the maenlfli;ent victories won by
a whole people, and we demand a thorough in
vestigation of the methods whereby our soldier
boys wen? deprived of the necessities and com
forts generously provided for them by a grate
ful people.
The platform also declared In favor of
abolishing one of tho Justice's courts of
the city of Oakland.
Owing to the numerous delays asked
for by the fusion committees the whole of
the afternoon was passed by and not until
evening was any business transacted. It
was not until the fusion committee re
turned and the appearance later of the
Populist fusion committee that a half
hearted assent was given to fusion, and
the- busincÃS of making nominations and
Indorsements was proceeded with.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
DOS Broadway, Sept. 24.
The Populist county convention was
called to order in Grand Army Hall at
10:45 this morning by P. J. Gregory, chair
man of the county central committee.
Gregory announced that the "regular and
legally constituted cÂ«unty central com
mittee" had Issued the call for this con
vention. He impressed upon the delegates
the importance of harmony.
Burdette Cornell, who once made a phe
nomenal run for Congress against Grove
L.. Johnson and A. Caminettl, was se
lected as permanent chairman. Edgar
Pomerpy acted as secretary, assisted by
C. \V. Pangburn. No sergeant-at-arms
was deemed necessary.
After a five minutes' recess, during
which the Assemebly delegates selected
members on the committees on creden
tials, permanent organization and order
of business, the convention reconvened
and the following committees were an
nounced:
Credentials â Forty-sixth Assembly Dis
trict, G. Toyne; Forty-seventh, W. H.
Roth; Forty-eighth, J. M. Bassett; Forty
ninth, T. M. Lattimer; Fiftieth, S. H.

Forty-ninth, D. \V. McLaughlln; Fifties,
C. S. McNally; Fifty-nrst, Dr. W. H.
Loomis; at large, M. L. Gray of Pied-

Perry Wall made the report of the
I credentials committee, while G. W. Graft
read the report on order of business and
permanent organization. A communication
from the Bimetallic League of Alameda
County, addressed to the convention, was
received and read as follows:
"Secretary of the People's party Coun
ty Central Committee of Alameda County
âGentlemen: We beg leave to inform
you that the Silver Republican party of
this county has appointed a fusion com
mittee to confer with your honorable
body, for the purpose of effecting a union
of our forces to elect county and legls-
I lative officers.
"H. A. INGALLS, Chairman.
"E. T. BARBER, Secretary."
The report of the district delegates on
j the selection of a conference and of a
! resolution committee was then presented,
the following selections being made:
Conference â Daniel Inman Forty-sixth
District; R. B. Meyers, Forty-seventh; H.
D. Wagner, Forty-eighth; C. W. Pane
bum, Forty-ninth; B. C. Allen, Fiftieth;
M. L. Gray, Fifty-first.

F. J. Gregory^at large; W. J. Donovan',
at large.
A motion by A. J. Gregg that the con
ference committee be restrained from
making any last or final arrangement be
fore the fusion committees of the
Democratic or .ver Republican
parties, for the reason, as he said, that
the convention could then retain its pow
er to pass upon the ofters of the other
parues without being hampered by agree
mm Â£ nt n Â»i" ls oreated a warm discussion.
R. B. Myers, argued that the conference
committee be Instructed to report sten
by step, the entire proceedings with the
other fusion committees and that it ho
vested with no discretionary or final pow
er to act. Others took issue and final iv
the sentiment of the convention was
called for in a test vote. The result was
that instructions were issued to the com
mittee to determine Just what was to be
offered by all sides, and to then report
back before any pledge toward fusion was
offered at all.
G. W. Pratt, J. M. Moore and Daniel
Stuart were then appointed as a commit
tee to wait upon the Democrats and Sil
ver Republicans and inform them of the
fact that a conference committee had
been selected and placed in readiness to
act. While the convention was awaiting
reports of the committee N. J. Manson
read the report of the platform commit
tee. The platform indorses the platform
and candidates of the party convened at
Sacramento from July 12 to July 14, 1808;
the principle of direct legislation fÂ« fa
vored; the soldiers and sailors are con
gratulated for their heroism; the consti
tutional amendment No. 2 is commended
for thoughtful consideration; the: candi
dates for Supervisor are pledged to
support the past Dalton assessments on
franchises, and the Board of Supervisors
is censured for cutting down said assess
ments, and the "hypocrisy of the corpo
rations assembled in convention at ban
Leandro" is denounced; a demand is
made for the repeal of the polltax. and
Legislative candidates are accordingly
pledged; good roads are demanded; <...'e
Improvement of Oakland harbor is re
garded as of utmost importance to the in
dustrial and commercial interests of'tne
county, and the party pledges the nomi
nees if elected to employ every effort with
Congressmen and Senators and the na
tional Government to bring about such
harbor improvement.
Then followed a debate on nic fact of
Dalton's name being mentioned. Some
wanted stricken out all that rc-ferrod to
Dalton'H assessments. To this Daniel In
man objected.
"Gentlemen," said he, "I am a Dalton
m.in. He is the only Assessor that we
have ever had that has assessed me cor
porations fairly. if I had my way I
would make Mr. Dalton the nominee of
thiÃ convention."
â¢ R. B. Myers spoke in the same strain.
Gregory said that the Republicans had
abused Judge Magulre. He was In favor
of returning good for evil by leaving Mr.
Dalton's name in the party platform.
The motion to strike out Dalton's name
was finally lost by a.most a unanimous
vote.
The convention reassembled this even
ing and the offices allowed to the party
by the fusion arrangement with the Dem
ocrats were filled as follows:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ANA, Sept. 24.â The fusion
campaign opened in Orange County to
day with a day moeting in the Grand
Opera House, addressed by James G.
Maguire. It was called to order by W.
M. McFadden, chairman of the Demo
cratic County Central Committee, who
introduced Dr. M. A. Menges, a Silver
Republican and the fusion nominee for
the Assembly, as chairman oi the meet
ing.
Mr. Maguire was greeted with warm
applause when he was introduced. The
fusion candidate announced that he was
deeply pleased to be met by such a
large audience at so unusual an hour.
Mr. Maguire asserted that the present
campaign was a contest not for party,
but for principle. The three reform par
ties of California had united to wage
battle against the party of monopolies
and special privileges and the fight in
volved the banishment of all monopoly
from* this State. The three parties stood
for every principle represented under
the leadership of William J. Bryan and
had made whatever sacrifices were nec
essary to effect a perfect union of
strength.
The speaker paid a high tribute to
the character of the State fusion ticket,
stating* that all its nominees were men
of honesty and capacity. He gave spe
cial attention to Dr. C. H. Castle, fu
sion candidate for Congress in this dis
trict, and Toland of Ventura, candidate
for the Board of Equalization.
Mr. Maguire had considerable to say
about .the railroad question, referring
to it at various sta""^ of his address,
as though th to leave it. In fact, if
the railroad, Henry T. Gage and Gen
eral Barnes were eliminated from his
remarks there would be little left. His
talk was directed to the poor, whom he
commiserated on being compelled to
pay 80 per cent of the war tax and to
whom he held out glittering allure
ments if the monopolies were only an
nihilated. His speech was listened to
with close attention and generously
applauded.
E. L. Hutchinson, fusion candidate
for Lieutenant Governor, also spoke
briefly, confining his ef'orts to a pyro
technic description of a man who prov
ed to be Mr. Maguire.
Maguire at San Diego.
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 24.â The fusionists
of San Diego opened their campaign
this evening with a big rally on the
Plaza. The spep" srs were Hon. J. G.
Magulre, candidate for Governor; E. L.
Hutchison for Lieutenant uovernor,
H. P. Andrew; for Attorney General
and J. L. Dryden for Railroad Com
missioner. Mr. Maguire njade. the prin
cipal speech of the evening and was
well received.

PROFITABLE TALKS
ON FARM TOPICS
State University Professors Discourse
Scientifically at the Marysville
Institute.
MARYSVILLE, Sept. 24.â There was
a decided increase in the attendance at
the Farmers' Institute to-day. Pro
fessor D. T. Fowler and Professor E.
W. Hilgard were the principal speak
ers. The farmer took up the subject
"Fodder for Winter Use. and the Sort
From Which the Best Results Are Ob
tained." He pointed out at length the
advantages alfalfa has over wheat and
oat hay, laying stress on the elements
in the alfalfa best fitted for work stock.
He asserted that the California farm
er must awaken to the necessity of di
versified farming. Alfafft, he said, was
the key to the problem. It was a cheap
food, to be had in abundance, and its
great value remained to be realized by
the farmer. It was the element that
built un muscle in stock and it was due
largely to that fact that farm-raised
beef had a greater demand in the mar
ket than range beef. Corn-fed with
alfafa was a desirable combination.
Many farmers planted corn for fodder,
and thought that to cultivate it was not
necessary. This was a misStke, he de
clared. The results derived from culti
vating were highly satisfactory.
Of the silo Professor Fowler is a
strong advocate. The silo, filled with
succulent corn and alfalfa, always in
sured fodder tl -.t the stock appreciated.
This afternoon Professor Hilgard
lectured on irrigation, giving many
new points of benefit.
There was a. big turnout of city folk
to-night when Highway Commissioner
Price lectured on "Practical Road
Building," illustrating his remarks
with stereopticon views. He was fol
lowed by Cm issioner Ashe on "Good
Roads." After final adjournment the
young folks Indulged in a social dance.

SAUSALITO, Sept. 24. â Captain
James Morse Brooks, the navigator
of Commodore lsadore Gutte's yacht,
the Chispa, was murdered while asleep
in his bunk aboard that vessel at about
1:30 o'clock this morning. Peter Nelson,
a deckhand, claims that the crime was
committed by the proverbial "two
men, one tall and the other short," and
that he himself escaped death only by
leaping over the side and swimming for
his life. The circumstances are so pe
culiar that the authorities believed
themselves warranted in arresting Nel
son on the suspicion that he was the
assassin, and he is new confined in a
cell in the San Rafael Jail.
At the hour named the town was
'aroused by somebody crying "Help:
murder! robbers!" the cries being punc-
tuated by three revolver shots. The
noise seemingly came from the direc
tion of the Chispa, which was anchored

There are four things that throw a
peculiar Ride light on the murder as
described by Nelson. It was only about
five minutes after the shots were fired
that the party from shore boarded the

Brooks had the reputation of being a
hard man for his help to get along
with, and once discharged three men in
a week.
The remains were taken to San Ra

lie on a slab at the Morgue. The au
topsy and inquest may be held to-mor
row, but. probably not until Monday.
Brooks was 50 years of age and a
widower.
It is not known how much booty the
robbers secured, aside from a gold
watch and chain. Captain Brooks would
not have received his payment for this
month's services until October 1, ac
cording to Mr. Gutte. Whether this
was known to the murderers or not
cannot be learned. Nelson had not
been hired long enough to know the
fact. Captain Brooks had some money
on Thursday evening, for he asked Cap
tain Dexter at the Narragansett Pier
House to change a $20 piece for him.
"Captain Brooks was in my employ
for nearly nineteen years and a more
faithful man I never met," said Com
modore lsadore Gutte. "The first news

their way into cabin. The next
thing the deck hand heard was- the
rattling of the lockers, and then a
thud, followed by a moaning and a cry
of "Help! Murder! For God's sake,
Peter, help!' As Peter crept forward the
rilling of the lockers still went on, and
so did the moaning of the wounded
man. Then he heard one of the men
say: 'Oh! Shoot the old and
have done with it.'
"Before Peter got to the companion
way one of the men started to come on
deck, so Peter lumped overboard and
swam toward the yacht Ramona. When
the murderers heard the splash they
ran on deck and fired three shots at
Feter. One of them took effect in his
leg. but still he swam on and got
aboard the Ramona. The shooting woke
up Sausalito. but before anybody could
row out to the Chisna the two men had
got into a boat and rowed away.
"The anchor light shone full on the
face of one of the murderers and Peter
would know him again among a thous

they left a 25-cent piece and a dime on
the floor of the cabin. Still they took
Captain Brooks' studs and sleeve links
out of his shirt. Captain Brooks was a
great collector of coins, and it was gen
erally believed that he had quite a sum
invested in that hobby, and that the
coins were aboard the yacht. Whether
that was so or not I can't say. The
deceased was a widower and his only
relative is a father living in England."

GAGE AT SAN

Enthusiasm at High
Pressure.
THOUSANDS ARE ADDRESSED
GENERAL BARNES SHARES IN !
THE GREETING.
Republican Party's Stand for the
Reclamation of Arid Lands
Explained by the Head
of the Ticket.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 24.â The
Republicans of this county simply out-
did th.miselves in their enthusiastic
welcome to Henry T. Gage and General
W. H. L. Barnes. They recognized the
one as their standard bearer and the
coming Governor of California, and the
other as one of the greatest American
orators and a man who has devoted his
life to the expoEition of Republican
ism.
People gathered from all parts of the
valley. A special train brought 500
people from around the loop, from
Highlands, Mentone and Redlands. An
other special from Ontario, twenty
miles away, brought people from that
town and intermediate stations. Still
another special landed a crowd of
cheering citizens from Riverside, Col
ton and Bloomington, fully 200 in all.
Besides these there flocked to the
town 'rural inhabitants by the wagon]
load. It is no exaggeration to say that
San Bernardino to-night contained
1000 or more strangers, besides her own
citizens, who turned out 5000 strong.
Mr. Gage and General Barnes arrived
from Los Angeles at 5:37 o'clock and
were met at the depot by a reception
committee composed of E. D. Roberts,
chairman of the central committee; F. !
W. Richardson and Henry Conner, and ;
escorted to the Stewart Hotel. There i
an informal reception was' held. Hun- j
dreds of citizens took advantage of the !
opportunity to meet Mr. Gage. Every |!
one who grasped his hand went away
his friend and supporter. The gentle
man has magnetism about him that j
convinces that he is an upright, honest
man of the kind the people want fo see i
at the head of the groat Golden State, i
Aa twilight deepened people began to ;
throng the streets. Then the uproar be- i
i gan. A crowd congregated about the
j hotel and began to cheer Gage.
At about 8 o'clock the two speakers i
I were conducted by the committee to an â 
open carriage under an escort rÂ»f 100
[ members of Truman Reeves' Young
Men's Republican Club, who lined either
side of the vehicle. A cadet band led
the procession.
The enthusiasm displayed put that at
the Maguire meeting held last night in
the shade. It is not the same kind â it
was not of the forced order noted be
fore. Every one was thoroughly in
earnest, and when the Young Men's
Club lent its yells the ovation seemed
complete, indeed.
Judge John L. Campbell, as chair
man, called the meeting to order, and
the secretary read the list of vice presi
dents. Then came a treat in the way
of a vocal solo by Miss Elize Buford.
She sang "The Star Spangled Banner"
in a rich contralto voice, and responded
to an enthusiastic recall.
After a patriotic selection by the band,
the chairman arose to introduce the
first speaker. He remarked that on this
occasion there were present two of the
greatest men in the State; that under
the circumstances anything more from
him than the necessary introduction
would be an imposition on the people.
Therefore, without further ado, he
would discharge the honor and duty
intrusted to him, present" to the people
of the imperial county Henry T. Gage.
The audience received the introduc
tion of Mr. Gage with a great outburst
of applause. The nominee for Gover
nor gracefully acknowledged the com
pliment and said he well understood
that the vast throngs assembled on the
streets of San Bernardino to-night had
not come toe-ether to welcome an indi
vidual, but to express confidence in the
triumph of Republican principles. He
thanked the people of San Bernardino
County for the support which he re
ceived from this county in the Repub
.lican State Convention. He repelled
the' charge nightly made by Mr. Ma-
quire that the delegates to that con
vention wore dominated by corruption.
He t^uid the insinuation was beneath
the character of any man aspiring to
the high office of Governor of Califor
nia. The audience of 6000 people ap
plauded the sentiment.
A tribute was paid to the honesty
and high character of Jacob Neff, the
candidate for Lieutenant Governor;
Truman Reeves the candidate for State
Treasurer, and other nominees on the
Republican ticket. He remarked that
there was no place in the fusion party
to-day for the patriotic Democrat to
occupy. The party organized by the
Silver Republicans had been traded out
of existence and there was no place
for the honest Silver Republican out
side of the Republican party.
Mr. Gage promised in the event of his
election to give the people a clean, hon
est and businesslike administration. In
his speech he displayed unus\ial ear
nestness and vigor. A few interrup
tions added to his advantage, as he
quickly grasped the opportunity to re
ply, to the discomfiture of his inter
rupting friends. He utilized the Con
gressional Record to prove that Mr.
Maguire did not object to the railroad
measure at a time when objection
would have .been effective. A lucid
statement of the question was submit
ted to the audience. The conclusive,
positive and overwhelming proof that
Maguire, had been dodging the question
ever since he started out in this cam
paign surprised the audience. The ex
pcrsure created a sensation and evoked
applause. ' â¢
In regard to the position of the po
litical parties on irrigation Mr. Gage
spoke a's follows: â  r â¢'.
Fellow Citizens: To the farmers, fruit
growers and horticulturists of this State
the subject of Irrigation Is of the highest
importance. The Republican party in its
desire for the welfare of the people of
California has pledged its representatives
to secure financial aid from the National
Government for tho location and con
struction of a system of storage reser
voirs for the supply of farmers, fruit
growers and horticulturists during dry
seasons. The following Is the pledge of
our State branch of the great party,
which has never failed in its public prom
ises, and whose past history and present
control of the national administration is a
guaranty for the future.
"The present year has demonstrated
again the necessity for a complete sys
tem of irrigation which shall enable the
land owner to use in dry and rainless
summers the water that is so plentiful
in the winters, and by its means secure
fruitful crops from what is now worst
that wasted soil. The redemption of the
many million acres of the present arid
land of America is a task that should en
gage the attention of the authorities,
both State and Federal, for its success
will add promptly and immeasurably
to our taxable wealth and population.
The conserving of the flood waters of
winter will require the investment of
many millions of dollalrs, which if in
vested by private capital would subject
the settler and land owner to imposition
and extortion. We therefore pledge our
representatives in Congress to the policy
of the location and construction of a sys
tem of storage reservoirs by the General
uu\ ci i mi- : - ' .
The fusion Democrats ' and Populists.'
ignoring the interests of the cultivators of
the soil, have made neither pledge nor
reference to . the subject. Content with
the determination of Mr. â  Maguire to im
pose the burden of taxation upon. the.
farmer, fruit-grower . and land-owners
generally through the medium of the sin
gle tax, they did not deem the matter of
Irrigation of any importance in the-lignt
of fusion politics. . â¢ /
It needs no argument for the sensible
people of the State who are Interested in
its, growth and development to under
stand the supreme importance pi irriga
tion, not only so far as respects the arid
regions, but even its richest parts. Here-,
tofore all State attempts to aid farmers
and fruit-growers and others cultivating
the soil have resulted in legislation bur
dening the land-owners, imposing, addi
tional taxes and causing perplexing com
plications.
The right irrigation system, while It
has benefited certain portions of the
State at great cost to the peo-1- of the
districts, has again ruined the values of
lands in other parts, and i. is a matter
of common knowledge that all similar
plans must necessarily prove ineffective
and burdensome where the expense of
purchasing and storing- the waters is to
be paid by the land-owners in the dis
trict. With the method proposed by the
Republican party of securing Govern
ment aid in collecting and storing the
mountain waters for the dry seasons and
constructing large- reservoir systems,
water may not only be supplieu to what
are now arid regions; but all settlers in
farming districts may obtain water sup
plies at practically nominal rates in com
parison with, the present cost of irriga
tion. > â 'â  'â â â  â ;â  â â¢ â .-:â¢; â -. '?'*â¢>:â <
In the report of the special committee
of the, United States Senate, on the irri
gation and reclamation of arid lands.
May. B, 1890, the following statements were
embodied: - â¢<â -. . .
â  "It is difficult to make anything like
a close approximation of the reclaimable
area of California.. .With the water in
sight certainly 12,000,000 acres will be a
low estimate. Water storage on a grand
scale, such as the conditions warrant,
will require the reclamation of at least
20 000,000 acres. A large proportion of
whatever â  area may be reclaimed- will
necessarily be .devoted to the raising of
products possessing a high market value.
Its fruits are among the best in the
world. It bids -fair to become the suc
cessful rival of the oldest wine growing
and wine making lands. Its nectarine,
prune, grape and orange are already
found in the markets of the world. The
olive, fig, lemon, date and other semi
tropical fruit are fast becoming of great
commercial importance. â  Nearly all these
products are the direct results of irriga
tion. They are all benefited by It when
wisely directed." *
Taking this estimate from the Senate
report of the reclaimable public lands, at
twenty millions of acres and multiplying
this at the Government price of $1 25 per
acre, we have a total of $25,000,000, in the
event of the land being made by irriga
tion desirable for settlers. This amount
being received by the general Government
by the sale of â¢ land made reclaimable by
Irrigation and expended in the construc
tion of reservoirs, flumes and ditches
would in five years enhance the value of
this land to $20 per acre, making a grand
total value of $400,000,000, which sum
would yield to the State â  of California
$2,000,000 per annum at a tax rate of 50
cents on each $100 worth of this now
worthless realty. It would create homes
for 125,000 families, each the possessor of
160 acres of irrigable and productive land.
Still another step: these families would
025,1)00 to the population- of , the State.
ÂW ith this increase in the value of land
now irreclaimable the value of all other
land now farmed' and cultivated would
more than double in value. â :* Such splendid
results to the State and nation so greatly
increasing the material wealth by the de
velopment of the arid public lands of the
State is well worth the present expendi
ture of a few million dollars by the gen
eral Government which expocilture, be
sides the "prospective advantages, would
relieve the existing distressed condition of
labor by giving c: nloyment to many de
serving unemployed people of the State. ,
At the conclusion of Mr. Gage's ad
dress the chairman presented General
W. H. L. Barnes. The general received
a superb greeting from the vast au
dience.
General Barnes' address was a mas
terly and eloquent review of the leading
questions before the people to-day.
General Barnes replied to the criticisms
of Democrats and Populists, that Mr.
Gage spoke with his hands in his
pockets. The general reminded the au
dience that Game's hands were not in
any other mans pocket, and mention
ed incidentally thn: Maguire as an
office-holder for the past fifteen years
had drawn $60,000 from the pockets of
the people, yet to-day he was indorsing
a platform declaring that public ser
vants should receive no more than the
wages of a laborer.
Maguire was again handled without
gloves, and the poonle apolauded every
point made against the nominee on
the fusion ticket.
Tremendous enthusiasm greeted the
sentiment in favor of holding every
inch of territory that has been conse
crated by the blood of American sol
diers. In several respects the orator
surpassed his great effort at Ventura
on Friday night. His hearers listened
'with breathless attention to his clos
ing utterances, wherein he traced the
erowth and expansion of the American
nation and declared that the one hun
dred millions of people in this country
would never permit the geography of
this earth to be changed unless they
had something to say about it. The
sixteen to one doctrine to which Barnes
bears allegiance â that is the destruc
tion of sixteen Spanish ships t com
pensate for the loss of the Maine
â produced the wildest enthusiasm.
In addressing the Silver
the orator was persuasive rather than
caustic. He invited them to come back
to the true faith and uphold the admin
istration of that great President, Will
iam McKinley.
After the meeting adjourned Mr. Gage
received with General Barnes the con
gratulations of a multitude. Men and
women pressed forward on the stage to
clasp his hand and cheer him with as
surances of individual support. The
crush at the Pavilion was so groat that
the chairman of the meeting announced
that the Republican nominee for Gov
ernor would continue the reception at
the Stewart House.

DEMOCRATS WILL
SUPPORT MR. GAGE
At Los Angeles They Are Openly
Declaring Their Disgust for
the Fusion Ticket.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 24.â Democrats of Los Angeles County are
coming boldly out into the open and declaring themselves for Henry
T. Gage and the Republican State ticket. Within the past week as
many as fifty former leaders of the local Democracy have openly
declared their intention of supporting Gage for Governor. The result
has been that the Democrats and their Populist brethren are alarm
ed at the manner in which the supposed supporters of Maguire are
falling away. Democrats who supported Bryan are bolting, declar
ing that they will not indorse the triple alliance in California.
The latest Democratic leader to declare for Gage is General John
stone Jones. In 1596 he was the nominee of the Democratic party for
Senator in Bulla's district, and was defeated. In 1890 he was elected
on the Democratic ticket as District Attorney of San Diego County,
and he was formerly Adjutant General under a Democratic adminis
tration in North Carolina. General Jones, in speaking of his position
in this campaign this evenine: said: "I have been a Democrat from
the time I cast my first vote, but the arrangements and deal that has
been put up in California this year does not meet with my approval
as a Democrat, and I cannot give it my indorsement at the polls. If
this policy of taking in all the disc .itented political elemer.' is to be
continued the result will be the utter ruin to our party. The time to
put the stamp of disapproval upon it is now, and the in 1 ) we will
be cleared for true Democrats to go into the Presidential campaign
unburdened by these side shows that give us so much trouble and
cause us to make so many explanations. I am glad, feeling as I do,
that I can cast my vote for Mr. Gage. I know him well, and he is an
honorable and highÂ«|ninded gentleman. I hope he will be elected, and
if my vote and the votes of such frier as I can control, will affect
the result, it will be accomplished."
L. Claiborne, a prominent local attorney and lifelong Democrat,
has also announced his Intention of supposing Gage.
Edson, candidate for Railroad Commis
sioner in the First District. Delegations
came from surrounding towns, swelling
the crowd to unusual proportions. A
great deal of powder was burnpd. Ar
mory Hall was filled to overnowing.
Patriotic and campaign songs were sung
by the Manhattan quartet.
Congressman hsarham's able address
was warmly received. Mr. Edson spoke
for a few minutes and made a flattering
impression on the voters of this county.
Local speakers also addressed the meet
ing, which was mailed throughout by un
common enthusiasm.

Mission.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special Correspondence of The CaJU
CAMP DEWEY, with the American
Army of Occupation before Manila,
August 10.â Rev. Father John McKin
non, chaplain of the First California
Volunteers, has just performed an act
without parallel in the history of mod-
em warfare â an act of unselfish bra
very, of devotion to the sacred cuuse
of peace which should make his name
live forever, even though his mission
failed. Alone, unarmed, without even
the protection of the Red Cross badge,
and with no knowledge of the Spanish
language. Father McKinnon to-day>
walked from the American camp
through the Spanish lines into the city
of Manila.
When the Paulist Father Dougherty,
also well known in San Francisco,
came out as chaplain to General Mer
rltt there was at once talk of a visit
to the Archbishop of Majiila, who, it
was understood, had been most largely
instrumental in nerving the Spanish
Governor General to resistance, In order
that a capitulation might be arranged
upon terms honorable to both parties
and the further effusion of blood
6topped.
Father Dougherty selected Father
McKinnon as the fittest man to ac
company him upon this mission, and
General Merritt and Admiral Dewey
both gave consent, although with some
reluctance. It was at first proposed
that the two priests should be taken
into the city in the Belgian Consul's
launch as that gentleman had been in
defatigable in his efforts to save Ma
nila from destruction. The Consul
promised to take them into the city,
but for some reason best known to
himself failed to keep the appointment
he had made.
Loiter the Consul proposed that the
two clergymen should pa.es the Ameri
can trenches and enter the Spanish
lines, sayir? he would display the Bel
gian Hag at the exact point on the
outworks at which he would meet .them
and that he would insure them safe
conduct. General Greene gave his con
sent to this plan after strong demur
and the two priests were on hand to
keep their engagement. Once more the
Belgian Consul failed to keep his ap
pointment, and the priests were fired
upon from the Spanish lines, one bullet
coming so close to them that Father
McKinnon's coat was cut and his back
slightly scratched.
It wuÃ formally announced then, as I
cabled you, that the attempt to see the
Archbishop would be given up. Father
McKinnon was not satined to let the
matter rest there. He realized, no one
more keenly, the tremendous power the
Archbishop of Manila must possess for
weal or woe and he determined to ap
peal to the humanity of one who after
all was but a man with a man's feel
ing f.r his fellows. The hostile armies
were lying quietly on their arms to
day and the fleet, though grimly form
ing, was silent. An air of expectancy
hung over the American camp. It had
been announced two days ago that
Dewey had given notice to the new
Governor General of Manila, Don Fir
men Jaudenez Alvarez, that at 1 o'clock
on Wednesday afternoon he would be
gin the bombardment of the city. The
Governor asked for an extension of
this time for twenty-four hours and
this was granted. Until noon to-day,
therefore, when word came from Hong
kong that peace had virtually been
agreed upon and from the flagship that
the bombardment had been again post
poned, it had confidently been expected
that before night the capital of Luzon
would be tumbling in ruins about the
ears of its defenders.
Stretching away in front of our camp
the beach Is as level as a floor down to
the very walls of Manila. Two miles
away, where an old iron barge has
been moored to a mango tree, the
American trenches come down to the
water, and 1000 yards beyond are the
trenches from which the Spaniards de
fend the pulverin, or powder magazine,
of Malate, now innocent of powder, but
making a strong battery.
Standing on the beach in front of our
camp, Father McKinnon watched the
ships in the ofliing, swept the beach
with a strong glass, and remarked to
me:
"I believe I could walk right away
down the beach and into Manila with
out any trouble at all."
The good father was missing at din
ner time, although no one supposed
that he had really carried out a pur
pose but imperfectly expressed. He
walked into camp at 8 o'clock to-night,
straight from the palace of the Gov
ernor General of Manila, the palace of
the man who had been selected to suc
ceed Augusti because he was a fire
eater and because it was suggested at
Madrid that Augusti was too much
afraid of Dewey's j?uns to make a
proper defense. Father McKinnon had
walked down the beach into Manila.
Without authorization other than that
given by his sacred calling, placing no
responsibility upon any shoulder save
his own, he had done all that he could,
more than any man in the camp be
lieved possible, to prevent the loss of
more life. If the worst comes now hib
conscience will be clear. He had done
more than his duty.
The father had found small difficulty
In entering the city. He was shot at
once, when within about 500 yards of
the Spanish trenches. It was then too
late to go back, even if he bad desired
to. He kept straight on, and no more
shots were tired. Arriving close to the
Spanish trenches, the captain came
down to meet him, escorting him with
in the lines. He could speak little Span
ish; his conductor no English. A
third officer, who spoke Latin fluently,
was sent for, and to him the father
made known his desire to see the Arch
bishop. With profound apologies that
they had no carriage available to
place at his service ,the officer escorted
him, on foot, to the Archcpiscopal
palace.
The Archbishop, Very Rev. P. No
zaleda, is described by Father McKin
non as a prelate of most imposing yet
benign presence. He is and has always
been, he says, a man of peace, and he
denied most- emphatically the author
ship of the circulars abusing the Amer
icans and calling the Filipinos to arms
which has been ascribed to him. On
the contrary he says he has always
been and is most profoundly anxious
to bring about the restoration of peace
between Spain and the United States
and to prevent, if possible, the further
shedding of blood in the Philippines.
He expressed a willingness to co-oper
ate with Father McKinnon in any way
possible to these ends. His people were
dying of starvation, were harassed by
constant alarms, were kept in a con
tinual state of dread by the existence
of the present conditions. So far as his
influence extended it was and would
always be for peace. Nevertheless he
gravely feared the Spanish leaders
would not give up the city without a
hard struggle at the last. There might
be only one assault. That one fight
there was certain to be.
The Archbishop bade Father McKin
non a pleasant adieu and placed his
carriage at the disposal of the Ameri
can priest for the purpose of calling
upon the Governor General. He also
gave to the good father the card which
I inclose herewith.
Father McKinnon was driven across
the Juneta and through the walled city
in the Archbishop's carriage, drawn by
a pair of milk-white horses, seeing cvi-
I dences on every hand that the people
i were suffering the pangs of hunger.
Small wonder all who could get away
had left the city gladly when Dewey
sent in his notice of bombardment.
Alvarez received Father McKinnon
most cordially, but gave even less hope
of an immediate cessation of hostilities
than had been given by the Archbishop.
j The Spaniards, he said, must resist the
I American fleet and army before Manila.
| The city was their last stronghold. The
i Americans possibly were strong enough
Ito take the place. Certainly their fleet
I gave them a distinct advantage. Never
i thelefis there would be, therÂ« must he
i resistance.
The Governor General had Father
j McKinnon escorted to the Spanish
I theless there would be, there must be
through the lines. He returned to
camp to-night, as I have said, and was
honestly surprised to find that his
j pluck had made him a hero.

Fishing for Health.
When a man breaks down with that
dread disease, consumption, and recognizes
his condition, he starts out to fish for
health. He tries this thing and that thing.
He consults this doctor and that doctor.
He indulges in all kinds of absurd athletic
exercises. He tries first one climate and
then another. He tries the rest cure and
the work cure. He grows steadily worse.
That is the story of most consumptives.
Finally, when the consumptive dies, the
doctor shrugs his shoulders and pronounces
consumption incurable. A thirty years'
test of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery has demonstrated that it cures 98
per cent, of all cases of consumption, if
taken in the earlier stages of the disease,
before the lungs are too far wasted. In a
consumptive there is a weaker spot than
even the lungs. That spot is the stomach.
A consumptive never really begins to die
until his stomach gives out. The "Golden
Medical Discovery" not only braces up
the stomach, but acts directly on the
lungs, healing them and driving out all
impurities. Honest medicine dealers will
not urge you to take an inferior substitute.
*'l had a very bad cough, also night-sweats,
and waa almost in my grave with consumption "
write* Mrs. Clara A. Mclntyre, Box 171 Ash-
land, Middlesex Co., MasÂ». r - A friend of mine
who had died with consumption cnme to me in
a dream and told me to take Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Diacorery. and, thank the Lord, I did
so. By the time I had taken half of the first
bottle I felt much better. I kept ou until I had
taken three bottles. That was all I needed. I
got well and strong agalu."
Whenever constipation is one of the com-
plicating causes of disease, the most perfect
remedy is Dr. Pierce's pleasant Pellets,
which are always effective, yet absolutely
mild and harmless. There never was any
remedy invented which can take theu
place. They never (ripe.

A "HEFTING" WATCHDOG.
AN esteemed morning contemporary criticises Dr.
R. Beverly Cole for describing Mayor Phelan
in a speech before the McXab convention as
a "watchdog of the treasury. " This idea is scouted
as ridiculous, and our contemporary broadly intimates
that Dr. Cole's remarks constitute a case of sarcasm,
for it is unable to see how his statements can be
reconciled with the facts, especially while the trial
of ex-Treasurer Widber is in progress.
'"How in the name of common sense." says our
contemporary, "is it possible to pay a man the Com
pliment oi saying that he is a zealous guardian of the
interests of the public, when it is notorious that the
defaulting Treasurer owed his opportunity to rob the
State to the tax manner in which the Mayor per
formed a duty imposed upon him by law?"
We do not hesitate, however, to take issue with our
contemporary upon this point. It is quite true that
had Mayor Phelan "seen" and counted the money
in the treasury, as the law requires, Widber would
never have been able to steal $115,000. But this es
teemed critic forgets that Mayor Phelan is not a
"seer" and "counter." but a "hefter" of coin. As a
"hefter" it is well known that the Mayor bears a
reputation second to none in the State of California.
The Finance Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
shortly after Widber' s defalcation, declared in a sol
emn report that the Mayor had been thoroughly edu
cated in the art of "hefting" hogs while at college,
and that he could tell to an ounce by that process
the weight of any commodity, whether money or
Instead of counting the money in the treasury once
a month, as the law directs, Mr. Phelan naturally re
sorted to his favorite method of "hefting" it. He
lifted the bags of coin and pronounced them correct.
As r\ matter of fact they did weigh exactly what the
labels called for, thus proving that the Mayor's sys
tem of "hefting" is reliable. Mr. Phelan never
thought of silver dollars and washers being substi
tuted for the gold in the bags. It never occurred to
him that a washer weighs very nearly what a $5-piece
weighs, and consequently he did not open the sacks.
But this wp.s not the fault of his system of "hefting."
He was simply made the victim of a fraud which
might have been practiced upon the best "hefter" that
ever lived.
We think Mayor Phelan is entitled to the designa
tion, "watchdog of the treasury," but he is a "heft
ing" watchdog and not a watchdog who "sees" and
counts the coin. This is a distinction our contem
porary ought to draw in its criticism of Dr. Cole.
If that gentleman's speech be amended by inserting
the word "hefting" before the word "watchdog"
where it occurs, the description of the Mayor will
be entirely accurate.
As to the question whether a "hefting" watchdog is
as good a watchdog as one who "sees and counts" the
treasury funds, we have nothing to say. As we un
derstand, that point is riot in issue in this campaign.
OUR COLLEGE OF COMMERCE.
\A fSS FLOOD'S munificent gift of millions to
/ \ the State University comes to the regents as
a most timely aid in the upbuilding of the
College of Commerce, and the establishment of that
college in turn is most timely to yie needs of the ad
vancing welfare of the State. That such an institu
tion has been created by the regents and that Miss
Flood has furnished it with ample means for the ac
complishment of its vast work are therefore matters
over which the people of the Pacific Coast cannot too
much congratulate themselves.
Statistics of the commerce of Pacific Ocean coun
tries recently published by the London Statist fur
nish an illustration of the'rich field for endeavor and
study that lies before the students of the new college.
According to these figures the trade of the Pacific
Coast States of the Union amounts to about $I5O;OOO,
ooo annually; that of British Columbia to $8,000,000;
that of Mexico, Central and South American coun
tries on the Pacific to approximately $307,000,000;
Ac islands of the ocean have a foreign trade aggre
fating $206,250,000: the international trade of Aus
tralia, Tasmania and New Zealand amounts to $680,
jdoo.ooo; the foreign commerce of the treaty ports of
"China is estimated at $437,500,000; that of Burmah
and British India at $1,000,000,000, and that of Japan
at $200,000,000. When to these sums are added the
figures for the trade of Eastern Siberia, French. China,
Siam and that of the Malay Peninsula, the total
reaches the vast sum of $3,586,250,000 annually.
That is the amount of trade now being carried on
upon the ocean of which San Francisco is the natural
metropolis. It is, moreover, a rapidly increasing
trade. Its richness has attracted the energies of all
the great nations of the world. It is surely a field
sufficiently vast to arouse the emulation of our pro
gressive youth, and to teach students how best to
master it and profit by it will require the fullest use
of all the means which the State or munificent patrons
can place at the disposal of the college. ,
Bryan says he's dammed, and we have to take
for granted that this is the way he spells it.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1898.
LOND CONFISCATION.
AS Judge Maguire has locked his mouth on the
subject of land confiscation, it is somewhat
ditticult to get at just what form he purposes
to give to that policy when he gets an official oppor
tunity.
In his speeches in Congress ~he has always de
nounced private ownership of land as a monopoly, a
special privilege, and as robbery, that must be pun
ished by confiscation of the land.
In his speeches to Single Tax clubs this form of
statement is also followed, and he has not hesitated
to use such hot condiments of language as to imply
a set prejudice against land-owners.
. In his speech before the Delaware Legislature,
urging the calling of a convention to amend the con
stitution of that State so as to confiscate land, he
said: "All revenues for the support of all govern
ments, Federal, State, county and municipal, are to
be raised by a tax on the unimproved value of land;
all other taxes, tolls,, duties and licenses being abol
ished." But this statement is vague. What is "the
unimproved value of land?" He v/ould seem to mean
that .ill l.fnd shall be taxed to its full value in its un
improved state.
Later on in the same speech he said: "The test of
the value of land is the amount of rent that the owner
could get annually for the use of it." This rent is to
be taken by the State for taxes. The characteristic j
industries of California have invited into land owner- j
ship many small holders, who live on tracts of orchard
and vineyard and garden of from twenty to sixty
acres. Their industry has made present the latent
fertility of the soil. Their labor has demonstrated its
value. They have picked the stones from the soil,
have leveled its inequalities of surface, and have coaxed
its capacities into demonstration. These small hold
ings in the foothills through which railroads run, as
in Placer County, present a delightful picture of rural
Kfe, where 'a few years ago was a rocky waste,
bearded with manzanita and chemisal. The change
came under the stimulus of private ownership by men
who had earned the money for their land investment as
mechanics, small tradesmen, and not a few as unskilled
laborers. Their labor and enterprise have given to
their land a rental value. In some parts of El Do
rado and Placer counties this rental value is from $10
to $15 per acre. By Judge Maguire's definition of this
plan this ground rent is to be taken for taxes, and
the owner of twenty acres would have to pay from
$200 to $300 per year taxes: the owner of forty
acres from $400 to $600, and of sixty acres from $600
to $900. As the land in its raw state had no rental
value at all, and its capacity to earn rent is the fruit of
labor, it must be seen that the single tax is a penalty
put on labor when devoted to the improvement of
land.
In the same speech Maguire said: "It may be said
that the present owners purchased their lands upon
the faith of existing laws maintained by the people,
and that they were even encouraged to invest in lands
by the manifest policy of the laws thus made and
maintained by the people. They say that, having thus
purchased under the sanction of the public laws, it
would be a hardship on them to change the laws so
as to destroy their investments."
He then proceeded to argue that those who hold
on to private ownership of land "in spite of the warn
ings that are involved in the progress of this move
ment" will have only themselves to thank for what
ever hardship comes. He also denied that any vested
right in land deserved consideration, but only the
effect of land confiscation "'upon the general happi
ness of the whole people of the State or of the coun
try is the true question at issue and will be the only
question considered when the people are prepared
for the final contest which is surely and rapidly ap
proaching on this great issue."
The land-owners being in a minority, to despoil
them of their investments is to contribute of course
to the joy and happiness of the owners of personal
property, who are in the majority, and who will en
joy, all the benefits and protection of Government
while paying no taxes for its support.
It requires the brain of a fanatic to see in the land
owners a privileged class, and not in the owners of
tax-free personal property. Personal property is the
product of labor and so is the rental value of farm
land, and neither should be privileged to enjoy the
protection of government without paying taxes to
support it.
THE POPULARITY OF EXPOSITIONS.
DESPITE the excitement of the war, which very
largely distracted public attention from the
affairs of peace; and notwithstanding the ex
treme heat of the past summer, which rendered the
people of the Mississippi Valley indisposed to the ex
ertions of sight-seeing, the Omaha Exposition has
thus far proven to be a financial as well as an in
dustrial success. It has furnished another proof of
the fondness of the American people for such dis
plays, and shown that when well managed they are
profitable as well as popular.
According to the latest financial report of the ex
position the receipts were then more than $38,000 in
excess of the expenditures. There was a balance in
bank of $15,000 over and above expenses and obliga
tions of all sorts. The original cost of buildings and
the plant generally being thus made up, and no
further expenditure being required other thzgi that of
running expenses, the managers of the fair have the
assurance of a good-sized surplus to look forward to.
As the remaining time during which the exposition
will be open will be plcasanter for visitors, the out
look is very bright, and Omaha is congratulating her
self. â¢
One of the effects of the success at Omaha is the
*:<mulus given to movements for holding expositions
in other cities. The press and certain capitalists of
Baltimore are discussing the advisability of holding
one in that city next year. New York has already laid
plans for an exposition in 1901 to follow that of
Paris. l Philadelphia proposes one in 1902, and St.
Louis plans something extraordinary in 1903 in celcr
bration of the anniversary of the annexation of that
section of country to the United States.
It will be seen that there is activity in the way of
providing for expositions in the near future in every
part of the Union except in the Far West. There
has never been at any time a comprehensive display
of what American civilization h<?? accomplished on
this side of the Rocky Mountains. Moreover, it is
safe to say no such display will ever be provided until
San Francisco takes the lead and does the greater
portion of the work required to accomplish it. The
project of holding one is certainly worthy of consider
ation. All other sections of the Union are moving
forward in such matters, and the Pacific Coast should
keep up with the procession.
Oakland thinks it has a murder mystery, and prob
ably it has. When the body of a man with five bul
let holes in the breast is discovered, the theory of
suicide has difficulties with which to contend. It
must be remembered, however, that in the case of a
man shot twice through the brain with a single
barreled pistol, either shot of necessity instantly fatal,
the , San Francisco police decided on the certainty of
self-destruction, and as the murderer never turned up,
they have stuck to it.
THE HflWflllAN TRfIDE.
F\ MEMORIAL from tne Chamber of Commerce
/ \ to the Hawaiian Commission requesting the
* immediate application of the coastwise naviga
tion laws of the United States to the trade of the
islands has been strengthened by similar petitions
from associations of Eastern ship-owners. The issue,
therefore, has been presented in a way that calls for
prompt action on the part of the authorities, and it is
hardly likely there will be much if any delay.
It is not easy to see why any question should have
arisen in the matter. Under our navigation laws the
coastwise trade is reserved exclusively for American
shipping. These laws cover the shipping trade be
tween American and Alaskan ports as well as that
along the coast of the United States proper. It
would seem, therefore, that as soon as the Hawaiian
Islands became a part of the territory of the United
States the existing laws would at once go into effect
and govern the trade regulations between our ports
and those of the islands.
There is, however, a considerable foreign interest
engaged in the Hawaiian trade, and that interest is
desirous of continuing to employ its shipping in

try as long as possible. It is claimed on the part of
the alien ship-owners that their right to engage in the
trade should not be abridged until Congress meets
and enacts laws expressly for the purpose of regu
lating the commerce with Hawaii. The existence of
this opposition furnishes ample cause for the me
morials and petitions that have been addressed to
the commission.
The issue is one that should not be involved in any
doubt. Our trade with Hawaii is large, and conse
quently the interests at stake are considerable. A
proclamation that trade between our ports and those
of Hawaii is in the nature of coastwise trade and sub
ject to the same law should be made promptly.
OUR GROWING MUSICAL CULTURE.
T \ EVIEWING the outlook for the coming musi
lâs cal season in that city, the New York Tribune
*â  *â  gives a list of announced operas and classic
concerts which is extraordinary ii. its variety, quan
tity and high quality. In the list are included
seventy-six representations of grand opera, sixteen
concerts by the Philharmonic Society, ten concerts
by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and a long se
ries of mixed social and artistic functions at the
Waldorf Astoria which, we are told, will "imitate
the court concerts of Europe."
To carry out this elaborate programme of music
the best artists of the world have been engaged.
There are to be concerts by Saver, Blanche Mar
chesi, Cecile Chamiade, and probably Paderewski,
and as for vocal artists their name will be legion. The
Tribune says of them: "Our gilded cage has never
housed so numerous a company of the world's best
songbirds as it will house this winter, and neither
London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, St. Petersburg,
Madrid nor Bayreuth ever saw so famous an aggre
gation of lyric artists."
For an understanding of the full significance of this
rich musical programme it must be remembered that
it is only a few years ago when New York as a musi
cal center was hardly accounted as a rival of Boston.
A few operas were given every winter at the Academy
of Music, and a few rare singers were brought over
from Europe from time to time, but people went
rather to see them as novelties than to hear them as
singers.
From that time to the present, when New York
looks forward to a winter more brilliant with the
highest music than is expected in any of the capitals
of the Old World, the progress of musical taste' and
culture in the United States has gone forward with
giant strides, and is notable not only in the me
tropolis, but throughout the count y.
The people of the United States are now expend
ing more money for high-class musical entertain
ments than any other people in the world. The ex
penditure, moreover, is not a mere ostentation of
wealth. It is made for the purpose of supplying a
genuine public demand, and is as lavish in proportion
to their wealth in the smaller cities as in the larger
ones.
One feature of the growth of high-class musical
entertainments throughout the country is worth at
tention. The number and the quality of the musical
events in any particular city have been in a large
measure dependent upon the quality of the halls
and opera-houses provided for them. When Boston
had the finest music-hall in the United States the
music of the nation centered there. When New York
erected her Grand Metropolitan Opera-house, and
Chicago provided the magnificent Auditorium, they
in turn went ahead. We have seen in San Francisco
what has been accomplished for us by a musical
theater so comparatively small as the Tivoli, to which
fashion and society do not like to go; and it is an
easy conclusion that if we had a grand opera-house
well located this city would soon rank among the
foremost in the world as a musical art center.
BONES OF THE DISCOVERER.
r^ APTAIN GENERAL BLANCO, Word
I Painter, Dictator to the Typewriter, and Son of
Thunder generally, has issu:d an order as to
the transfer from Cuba to Spain of the bones of
â¢Columbus. This is an impertinence. Blanco should
have no power now to issue any order more impor
tant than for his own dinner. He represents a con
quered people. He lingers in a territory where his
presence is tolerated by the conquerors, but where he
should have no vestige of authority.
We did not send troops to Cuba for spoils, there is
no intrinsic worth to the osseous remains of Colum
bus, and yet to permit them to be disturbed would
be a sacrilege for which there is neither occasion nor
excuse. Spain has no claim upon them. She did
Columbus the honor to permit him to die in chains,
and the deference to be given his bones could more
fittingly come from the great people whose then mys
terious habitat his eye of faith discerned, and be be
stowed in the land he found as he voyaged into an un
known world.
We protest against the proposed removal. It is a
matter purely of sentiment, and yet sentiment sways
the human mind and the destiny of the race. To let
the Spanish depart from the island they for centuries
oppressed, the island where their very presence was a
disgrace, and take with them anything they choose,
would be a mockery of justice. Let them go with
"honor" and side-arms. For some reason they place
a value on the former, and with the latter they are
incapable of doing damage. But Blanco does not
seem to realize that he has been subdued, that he
represents a lost cause, that every concession made to
htm is a distinct and wholly undeserved favor. To
permit him to desecrate the tomb of Columbus would
be a shame. Blanco should be allowed to take away
his own bones, together with the fatness thereof, but
the bones of the dead discoverer must be considered
outside his jurisdiction.
The course of the Spanish since their surrender has
been grossly presumptuous. They want to make all
the terms. The stars and stripes fly over Havana
now. The incident seems to have escaped the notice
of Blanco.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
One of my ambitions is to see a lot
of lawyero of a certain sort sent to jail.
Of course there are many respectable
lawyers. This makes more surprising
the fact that there are other lawyers
who are scamps, scoundrels, bunko
steerers, who know nothing of law ex
cept to evade it, who have clients only
to fleece them. Are these precious con
fidence operators under the protection
of the Bar Association? If so, what is
the claim of this association to dig
nity and standing? lam led to ask
these questions by a news item con
cerning Burnette G. Haskell, attorney
at law. Perhaps Haskell has been mis
represented. Ido not pTetend to say.
But if he has not, he should be prac
ticing at the jute mill. The item sets
forth that Haskell undertook a case for
a woman; that the case was decided
by default against her, and that Has
kell then sent word to the contrary,
and that he must have $2 50 in order to
enter the successful judgment. The
woman sent him the money, at least
so her allegation sets forth, and soon
after swore to a complaint for his ar
rest on a charge of petty larceny by
trick and device. I have observed
nothing as to the serving of a warrant,
but if the charge is true, society Is
wronged bo long as Haskell remains at
large. The legal fraternity owes to
Itself the duty of freeing its ranks from
the presence of black leg shysters. Has
kell may not be one of these, but there
are others. The Police Court practi
tioners who prowl about the City Jail
looking for prey are morally on a lower
scale than the drunks and vagrants
whom they rob. They ought to be ex
terminated.

There has grown up a bad habit of
speaking ill of the Tennessee soldier in
general. That there is no warrant for
this is understood by all who have been
brought into personal relations with
the men of that regiment. For in
stance, here is a short stor>-: The other
day a lady entered a street car. When
she came to pay her fare she was em
barrassed by the discovery that her
smallest coin was a twenty-dollar
piece. The conductor, unable or un
willing to change it, told her that she
would have to leave the car. He gave
the information rudely. The lady
blushed and prepared to obey the or
der. Up rose a soldier who had been
sitting in the corner. He smashed that
conductor just once, because there was
no necessity of doing it a second time.
The gripman rushed in, and in turn
the soldier knocked him into a state -A
comparative grace. Then the victor
tipped his hat to the lady. "I'm a
private in the Tennessee regiment," he
said with that Southern accent which
falls so pleasantly on the ear, "and I'm
very glad to have been here just now.
I would take it as a favor, madam, if
you would permit me to pay youah
fare." He extended â¢ the lady the
necessary nickel, tipped his hat once
more and left the car. The conductor
and gripman revrved. and business was
resumed.

Captain Barnes of the Eighth Regi
ment has for several years had as
serving man a negro known as Sam.
Since the captain has grown so stout
that he cannot lace his own shoes, Sam
has been a necessity. As a rule he
is obedient, but the other day he re
belled. "Ham," said the captain, "get
on my horse and ride down to the Ten
nessee camp, give my compliments to
Colonel Smith and tell him I will be
glad to join him at lunch." Sam rolled
his eyes. "Mistah Bahnes," said he,
"I'se ben a faithful man, and I'se en
deavohed, sah, to do my full duty. But

The captain reflected a moment, and
then sent a white messenger.
Perhaps I bring myself into contempt
by it, but I confess to admiration for
the Indiana Sheriff who came here for
a prisoner, and having secured him
stole him out of the State by means of
a special locomotive. Of course the
Sheriff might have stayed indefinitely
while the customary monkey business
of the law was being enacted, but he
thought of a better way, devoid of
technicality, delay or flubdub. The
prisoner had committed a crime and
sought refuge in California. This is
not properly an asylum for rogues. Ex
tradition papers had been signed, and
after nil, up popped a lawyer with in

It was a vain effort, thanks to a Sheriff
not given to foolishness.
There is no utility in overpraise of
a man even if he is dead. I have in
mind the late Carl Smith, a valued
member of the Chicago Record stajf.
He was drowned a few days ago while
on the sort of a vacation a liberal pa
per grants to its overworked men, and
during which they are required to write
a column a day. Of Smith an admirer
has written:
"The name of Carl Smith will nev*r
be forgotten, but will live to be an
inspiration so long as youth, intelli
gence and virtue shall dare to achieve
honorable distinction in the. face of dif
ficulty and disadvantage."
All this shows a friendly spirit, but
It is nonsense. The name of poor Carl
will be forgotten before his successor
shall have warmed for a fortnight the
chair Smith filled so well after Field

appreciate a man, even if he labor un

With all respect for the members of

THE LAW AND
THE CULPRIT
The world is full of madness, deceit
and crime. The law of love is no
longer the law of liberty. Human ne
cessities increase with advancing civil
ization and ambition to rule leads men
into excesses and crime until all re
formatory and penal institutions are
crowded with criminals.
The administration of law is so un
certain that it has but little terror for
the offender. Crime is on the increase.
There is little protection to virtue and
no reward for honesty.
This condition is most lamentable and
cannot be changed, nor will the ma
jesty of the law be respected until the
guilty are punished and public moral
sentiment is spared a cruel suspense.
Then justitia flat might, with propri
ety, be placed upon the canopy over
shadowing the court.
The difficulties attending court pro
cedures so often witnessed do not ap>
pear to be alone occasioned by the de
fects of the laws, but, rather, depend
upon the maladministration of the laws
and defiance of justice. In such cases
the punishment named in the law as
a penalty for crime is set aside by spe
cious pleadings or perhaps intentional
errors which appear in the briefs, and
crime laughs in the face of justice and
defies the law.
A promise that is not kept creates a
distrust in its integrity, and a case
which fails to make an application of
its penalty should be taken from the
code of criminal procedure, as it en
courages the crimes it was made to
prevent. What can be more plain in
a forensic debate before the court than
the scholarly dignity which carries con
viction to the minds of the jury upon
the side of justice in accordance with
the spirit of the law?
When, however, eminent pleadings
are made for the purpose of securing
delay in accordance with t.he assump
tion of law â aut scriptus aiit non â
then the people rise and declare vox
populi, vox Dei, and then follow the
dangerous proceedings of summary
punishment. It would be better to
have ten guilty persons hanged, than
to have one innocent person suffer; but
the law says differently.
When one commits a homicide whllÂ«
drunk, as in the case of Ross'er, and
enters the plea of "not guilty," and
claims to be unconscious of the act at
the time-it was committed, the ques- â¢ '
tion of responsibility will be taken sub
judice and occupy much of the val
uable time of the court at a great ex
pense to the State.
This is wrong in all ordinary cases
of drunkenness, for it is only after a
prolonged debauch, while one is suffer
ing from delirium tremens, that he
fails to realize what he has done and
makes no effort to escape; but when
one commits a homicide in a moment
of acute drunkenness he at once at
tempts to get away, and if arrested
will show an unconscious condition of
his mind.
Should it be made to appear to a
Jury that while drunk one is uncon
scious of what he is doing or has done
and. is ignorant of the law, then the
old maxim, "Ignorantia legis neminem
excusat," should apply to him until the
penalty of the law shall prevent a rep
etition of his offense.
Even for his drunkenness he should
be punished for misdemeanor, for no
one has a right voluntarily to make
himself unconscious of any unlawful
act he may commit. Public morals re
quire a conscious rectitude of action
at all times, and the man who becomes
indifferent does not always -become for
getful of his duty to the public and
always knows the difference between
the bar and ltinch table and never goes
to the latter for his drink.
Then, why should the courts be tri
fled with upon so simple a proposition .
as mental alienation in cases of homi
cide during a fit of intoxication, ex
cept in known cases of mania a potu,
and why should public sentiment be
made to feel the injustice of the pro
ceedings in so many of the cases of
criminal prosecution?
At times the ermine of the court
seems dragged in the mire and justice
weeps and retires before eloquent fo
rensic pleading's.
No experts need be called to tell the
court and jury of the responsibility of
the man who is drunk; common intel
ligence and daily observation are bet
ter Interpreters of the effects of alco
hol upon the mind than many of the
books that are written upon the sub
ject. It has often occurred that .a
witness has been upon the stand as an
expert upon mental diseases who hag
never had any practical experience and
who knew far less of the subject than
the court, and possibly than some of
the jury.
Such a witness, on whichever side he
may testify, does more to defeat Jus
tice than to promote the execution of
the law, for his mistakes are formu
lated into spurious arguments to con
fuse the jury so as to give the defend
ant the benefit of a doubt. To avoid
this error in the proceedings of crimi
nal cases there should be a, special com
mission appointed, consisting of five
prominent members of the medical pro
fepsion. who. besides having supervi

Insane, should be known as "State" ex
perts," whose duty as State officers
should be, when notice is served upon
them, to attend all trials when the
question of mental unsoundness is oc
cupying the attention of the court.
Th^n the criminal and the legatee

spirit of the law.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 24.â The com
mission to investigate the conduct of
the War Department during: the recent
conflict with Spain held Its initial meet-
Ing in the office of President McKinley
at rhe White House to-day. There were
eight members present, as follows:
Major General Granville M. Dodge of
lowa, Colonel J. A. Sexton of Illinois,
Captain E. P. Howell of Georgia, Ma
jor General J. M. Wilson (chief of en
gineers of the United States army).
Hon. Charles Denby of Indiana (late
Minister to China), ex-Governor Urban
A. Woodbury of Vermont, ex-Governor
James A. Beaver of Pennsylvania and
Major General H. McD. McCook of the
army (retired).
The commission spent an hour and a
half with the President and then ad
journed to the room assigned to it at
the War Department for the purpose of
organizing and beginning work.
The proceedings with the President
consisted in the main of a general ex
change of views as to the scope of the
commission's investigation, in which
the President participated quite freely.
He told the members that the organiza
tion of the commission had been under
taken, at the request of Secretary Al
ger, and read a letter from the Secre
tary in which he made the request. The
President had put his own views in
â writing and read them before proceed
ing to the verbal discussion. In this
statement he said that complaints had
been directed especially to the surgeon
general's, the quartermaster general's
and the commissary general's depart
ments of the army, and he sugestged
that the conduct of these departments
should receive especial consideration at
the hands of the commission. To this
specific request he added that it was his
desire that the entire military organi
sation should, if necessary, be made
the subject .>f inquiry, saying that he
wished the commission to go to the bot
tom of the subject in all cases and to
proceed with its work without fear or
favor.
"If," he said, in the Informal discus
sion that occurred, "the commission
should have difficulty in securing the
attendance of witnesses or in obtain
ing access to papers thought to be es
sential to the prosecution of its labors,
I hope the matter will be brought to my
attention, when I will do allinmypower
to overcome the difficulty. I want
the commission to have a clear field,
and I will do all that is possible for me
to do to pee that it has."
Secretary Alder's request, as made in
the letter read by the President, was
for a complete inquiry into the conduct
of the war, especially on the line of
the charges published in the newspa
pers. He said that these charges had
assumed such magnitude that he did
not feel satisfied to have the depart
ment rest under them, and that he de
sired an investigation by those eminent
In military and civil life.
After the close of the conference at
the White House the President express
ed his satisfaction with thf personnel
of the commission, adding that he be
lieved the investigation would be thor
ough, and the report fair and impartial.
The commission organized by electing
Granville M. Dodge chairman and
}-;:>hard Weightman secretary. Major
Mills of the inspector general's office
Is to be military recorder. The com
mission adjourned about 1:30 to meet at
10 o'clock on Monday.
The session was devoted to method of
procedure, nothing definite being reach
ed. It was said that probably the in
vestlgatfon, bo far as the examination
of witnesses was concerned, would be
c ;nn, but that other proceedings would
be in executive session.
Dr. Phineas S. Conner of Cincinnati
was announced as the ninth member of
thf commission. He was not present at
to-day'fl session, but no doubt was ex
-t>d that he would serve. He was
selected because of his eminence as a
physician, and the President has been
anxious from the beginning to secure
the services of a medical man because

speedily digested before It has time to
. sour and ferment. These tablets will di-
gest food anyway, whether the ; stomach ,
wants to or not, because they contain
harmless digestive principles, vegetable
essences, pepsin and Golden Seal,, which
supply just what the peak stomach
lacks.
* I have advised the tablets with great
success, both In curing indigestion and to
build up the tissues, increase flesh in thin
nervous patients', whose real trouble was
dyspepsia, and as - soon as the stomach
â was put to rights they did not know what
sickness was.
A GO-cent package of Stuart's Dyspep-
fsia Tablets can be bought at any drug
store, and as they are not a secret patent
medicine they can be used as often as de-
sired with full assurance that they con-
tain nothing harmful in the slightest de-
gree: on the contrary, any one - whose
stomach is at all , deranged will find great
a benefit from the use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Y Tablets. They will cure any â¢ form of
stomach weakness or disease except can-
cer of the stomach. - Full size package at

ALGER'S DEFENSE
SHOWN BY SPEECHES
The Secretary of War Holds Com
manding Officers Responsible
for CoQditions at Camps.
ATLANTA, Ga., Sept. 24.â The Southern tour of Secretary of War
Alger has developed the line of his defense to be made before the
commission to investigate the "^v'ar Department methods appointed
by President McKinley. The firtÂ»t inkling of the Secretary's position
developed in his speech to the commanding officers at Camp Po
land, Knoxville, and his speech to the officers of Camp Shipp this
morning at Anniston undoubtedly made it clear that the Secretary
has his plan of action. He will make the point that he is not re
sponsible for the evils of the camps, and that he could not justly
be held responsible because It was impossible for him to attend to
his duties at Washington and at the same time look after condi
tions jeu the various military camps. He had declared repeatedly
that he holds camp officers responsible for sanitary and camp regu
lations, and that unless the commanders require their subordinates
to see to It that the camps are clean and in good sanitary condition
at all times he will hold them to account. Secretary Alger made a
speech to General Prank's officers at the headquarters at Camp
Shipp this morning in which he repeated what he had said In Knox
ville about holding officers responsible, and declared if there were
evils in the camps at Chickamauga, Tampa or elsewhere the blame
must rest tipon the commanding officers first and then on colonels and
captains and so on down the line.
the medical department of the army is
much involved in the charges that have
been made.

by Jnmei Gordon Bennett.
MANILA, Sept. 24. â The sanitary conditions are of a most menac
ing character. Six hundred and eighty soldiers are now in the general
hospital. They are suffering from typhoid and dysentery, for the most
part, and the new cases run from ten to fifteen daily.
Within the walled city the conditions are even worse. Ten Span
ish prisoners died from typhoid fever yesterday. Hundreds of the others
are sick, despite efforts of the Americans to keep the place clean. The
American officials realize that matters must continue to grow worse
unless orders come to remove the prisoners either to Spain or -to Cor
regidor Island, where they could be kept* safely away from infection.
The death report for the American troops for the week is as fol
lows :
First Californiaâ Da,ve Drum, Clayton Cunningham, John O'Neil
and Harry Robertson, dysentery; P. Helian, A. Lenchal and H. R.
Fry, typhoid fever.
Astor Battery â Daniel Prysble, dysentery.
The hospital ship Rio sailed Thursday, having 150 invalids on
board, The Raliegh. Boston and Callao have gone to Iloilo to take pos
session of the place.
Seven insurgents were arrested Thursday, charged with impress-
Ing men in the city for Aguinaldo's army. Three are held for exami

CONFESSES THAT
HE WROTE THE
FAMOUS NOTE
Esterhazy's Admission That He
Forged Evidence to Con
vict Dreyfus,
While the Intelligence Office Suspected the
Captain It Had to Forge Evidence to
Convict.
LONDON, Sept. 24.â The Observer
this morning continues its Esterhazy
revelations, begun last Sunday, in a
long article, the most salient feature
of which is Cerate Esterhazy's disclos
ure, made, it is asserted, in the pres
ence of more persons than one, that he
was the author of the famous Dreyfus
bordereau, which he wrote "at the re
quest of Colonel Sandherr, now dead."
It was intended, he said, "to consti
tute proof erf Dreyfus' guilt. It was
known through a French spy in the
service at Berlin that certain docu
ments had reached the German general
staff which Dreyfus alone could have
obtained. It was a list of these docu
ments which constituted the bordereau.
Dreyfus had been tested in several
ways. For instance, a plan for the con
centration of troops of the southern
frontier had been dictated to him, which
was quite fantastic.
"A short time afterward our spies in j
Italy Informed us that the Italian staff
was making modifications in the forti
fications around Nice, which corre
sponded with the changes announced
in the imaginary scheme dictated to
Dreyfus. Then Dreyfus managed to
spend long holidays in Alsace without I
giving any reason.
"In fact there was considerable moral
proof against Dreyfus before the trial |
took place, but no material proof.
"Colonel Sandherr, who was an Al
satian like Dreyfus, but intensely antl- j
Semitic, determined to form his proof.
He was convinced of the accused man's
guilt, but it was necessary for the pur
poses of the court-martial that docu
ments should exist. I was attached to
the intelligence department, my duty
being to watch the movements of mili
tary attaches accredited by the powers
of the triple alliance.
"When Colonel Sandherr told me to
â write out the borderes^-i. did so with
out the slightest compuncOo. I am
one of those men who, by precession,
cling to oii r -".ieval traditions of
military discipline. When I received an
order I obeyed it implicitly, and with
out question. I wrote the bordereau be
cause Colonel Sandherr told me to do
so. I knew, of course, the purposes it
was intended to have. I was commit
ting a forgery; but I also knew that all
intelligence departments in all coun
tries were run on the same line, and
that it was impossible to achieve the
results in any other way.
"In the Yon Tausch case, for in
stance, which made so great a sensa
tion in Germany, Major Yon Tausch
confessed to having committed forgery,
adding that the crime was nothing to
the infamies the Berlin staff had forced
him to commit in connection with other
H DEFEAT FOR
BRITISH POLICY
How the Chinese Puzzle
Is Interpreted.
DISAGREEABLE SHOCK GIVEN
m
IMPATIENCE TO LEARN OF
EVENTS AT FASHODA.
Copyrlghted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Sept. 24.â The recent dra
matic development of the Chinese
puzzle came as a disagreeable shock to.
the people of Great Britain, and their
chagrin was intensified by the fact that
they were reveling in their apparent
diplomatic triumph in the disgrace of
Li Hung Chang and the wane of Rus
sian influence. Not only in Great Brit-
am, but abroad, the Queen Dowager's
proclamation is interpreted as a fresh
defeat for British policy.
The impatience here to learn the out
come of the journey of Sir Herbert
Kitchener to Fashoda is in no wise al
layed.
There are fears that the French au
thor!t'es may seek a foreign diversion
from their internal strife. The Parisian
newspapers, however, adopt a more
compromising tone, and instead of de
claring that the French flag will never
be lowered at Fashoda, they now put
forward the occupation of that place
by Major Marchand as a lever by which
France may be able to obtain advan
tages elsewhere.
The alarming situation in France riv
ets the attention of Europe. The ex
citement is increasing hourly and new
revelations and developments are ex
pected. The weakness of M. Brisson,
the Premier, over the affair of Lieuten
ant Colonel Picquart, who is nc/w In se
cret confinement in the military prison j
of Cherche Midi, placed there appar- j
ently without the knowledge of the
Government and in spite of the fact
that he was in the hands of a civil
court, has disgusted even his own per
sonal friends, who call him a coward
and a dc-lt, while the enemies of a re
vision of the Dreyfus case accuse him i
of being a hypocrite and of having sold
himself to a Dreyfus syndicate, an or
ganization which is undoubtedly exist
ing.
The supporters of the Cabinet declare
that M. Biisson, in order to save the
constitution, should dismiss General
Chanoine and General Zurlinden and
even arraign them for treasonable con
duct. Only bold action will secure the
supremacy of civil law.
One satisfactory feature of the prose
cution of Colonel Picquart is that the
War Office has engaged to give him an j
open trial, which M. Brisson insisted i
upon before he consented to the pris- j
oner's transfer to the military prison I
of Cherche Midi. The friends of Colonel
Picquart declare that if he is publicly
tried he will throw floods of light upon
the whole mystery.
In an Interview a former parliamen
tarian, who has figured in all the po
litical events in France since 1869, pub
lished in to-day's Daily News, is quoted
as expressing opinions regarding the
i matters. Therefore the court attempted
!to silence him. He ultimately received
I the minimum punishment prescribed
! and has since been released long before
! his time.
"It is nearly always necessary to man
ufacture material evidence against
spies, because otherwise they would
never be punished. The bordereau hav
ing been written, it became necessary
to give it the indispensable air of an
I authentic document. As you know it
j was supposed to have been stolen from
! the German embassy. Colonel Schwarz-
I koppen (formerly German military at
| tache in Paris) denied ever having seen
I It. What he said was perfectly true.
; The bordereau was handed by an agent
j of our Intelligence Department to the
I porter of the German Embassy, who
; was a spy in our service. The porter
I gave it to another agent named Genest,
I nnd by him it was brought to the In
! tolligence Department and there dock
eted and numbered as a document ob
tained from the German Embassy in
the usual course. It thus received of
ficial baptism.
"It was exclusively on the evidence
of the bordereau that Dreyfus was con
demned. The document privately
shown to the officers of the court-mar
tial was fetched from the War Office
during the Huis Odes with the object of
I convincing the judges, should they
I show signs of wavering. It was the let
ter containing the phrase, 'De Canaille
de D .' Now, this letter, which is
genuine and was really written by
I Colonel Schwarekoppen, did not refer
I to Dreyfus at all. The general staff was
! absolutely aware of the fact that 'D'
was a certain Dollfus, a building con
tractor, who years before had sup
plied the German attache with plans
of the fortifications near Nice."
The ex-major added that the case
against him was quashed in defiance of
all law and justice. He said the veiled
lady who anpeared in the case was no
other than the wife of Colonel Patty
dv Clam.
PARIS, Sept. 24.â The Cabinet met
to-day and decided to postpone its de
cision on the question of the proposed
revision of the Dreyfus casa until Mon
day next, owing to the absence from
the meeting of the Minister of Finance
M. Peytral, and the Minister of Agri
culture. M. Vig^r.
It was officially announced this after
| noon that the civil commission which
! has been examining the documents in
; the Dreyfus case, with the view of re
porting to the Government on the ad
visability of reopening it, is equally di
| vided for and against revision, and the
j Government considers that this revision
. gives it full liberty of action and also
of responftlbility. Therefore, the Gov
ernment has decided, as already stated
to wait until Monday, when a full Cabi
net meeting will be held and a decision
arrived at.
!â â  '1- which President Faure is playing
confirming previous statements on the
same subject. He says that General
Zurlinden enjoys the full confidence of
the French President, who is in love
with military glamour. President
Faure, he adds, has but to say the word
and have France at his feet, and, he
further says, if he does not say this
word and declares himself in favor of a
revision of the Dreyfus case, he will
have the whole French mob in hue and
cry against him and he will have to go.
But if, in order to oppose a revision, he
resigns the presidenc- the national as
sembly or congress for the election of
presideots will meet at Versailles with
in twenty-four hours and M. Faure will
be re-elected by a crushing majority of
those who are hostile to a revision. He
will then form a ministry, and with M
Barthou as Premier, and with an am
bitious, strong general at the head of
the War Office, he will be able to do
what he likes with France.

Form a Plan for the Paci

ROME, Sept. 24.â Within twenty-four hours Great Britain, Rus
sia, France and Italy will append their signatures to an agreement
for the pacification of the island of Crete, including a plan for coercion
of the Sultan into submission. The scheme has for some time been
drafted but its enforcement was delayed to invite the participation of
Germany, which country declines.
At the beginning of the week the four powers will send an ultima
tum to the Sultan of Turkey, summoning him to accept the project
and informing him that unless he does so measures will be taken to
enforce his compliance. The powers have irrevocably decided to set
tle the Cretan question immediately and will not hesitate to send
their fleets to the Dardanelles and beyond if necessary.

SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 24.â The
fourth day of the Methodist conference
of Southern California was opened by
the devotional services conducted by
the Rev. M. J. Hilbish. The morning
was occupied by a business session of
the conference.
William A. Brown, a probationer of
the second year, was transferred from
New York and B. E. Newton from Ne
braska to the Southern California con
ference. Dr. W. S. Matthew, editor of
thi- California Christian Advocate, ad
dressed the conference in the interest of
the Advocate and reported much prog
ress and success during the year. It
has been a financial success in every
way. Dr. J. D. Hammond of San Fran
cisco spoke in the interest of the San
Frunciscu Book Concern. Bishop John
F. Hurst, D.D., L.L.D., addressed the
conference concerning the American
University at Washington, D. C. Rev.
E. W. Caswpll offered the following
resolution, which was unanimously
adopted by the conference:
Resolved, That we. as a conference,
make subscriptions for the cause of edu
cation; one-naif of said subscriptions
shall be made in the interims of the Uni
versity of Southern California and one
hall' appropriated for the benefit of the
American University and represented by
our beloved Bishop Hurst, unless other
wise ordered.
Two thousand two hundred and forty
dollars was subscribed, $1773 of which
was ordered appropriated for the Amer
ican University and 5665 for the Uni
versity of Southern California.
T. A. Miller, Edwin H. Fetz and Wil
liam A. Brown were elected to the dea
cons' orders.
This afternoon Evangelist Charles N.
Crittenten addressed a large audience
of women on "Rescue Homes." Mr.
Crittenten g:.ve a touching account of
the circumstances that caused him tv
establish the first rescue home at the
Florence Mission in Philadelphia. In
the course of his talk he said that there
â were over 300,000 fallen women in Amer
ica, whose average life was five years.
He figured that this would make 5000
deaths in a single month from the ef
fects of the life they led.
He regretted to say that very little
Interest up to this time had been taken
In these women. He contrasted the
lack of interest to the great interest
taken in the 2000 deaths caused by
fever and shot on the field of Santiago.
Mr. C'rittenten gave the sociological
causes of the downfall of women and
attributed it in great part to the very
low wages paid to the shop girls in
cities, to the skating rink and to pro
miscuous bathing at seaside resorts.
This evening being the anniversary of
the Educational Society, the Rev. C. H.
Payne, the general secretary of the so
ciety, and its president, G. W. White,
addressed the conference on their work.
GENERAL KITCHENER'S
VERY NARROW ESCAPE
During the Battle at Omdurman He
Was Fired Upon by Becently
Enlisted Dervishes.
LONDON. Sept. 24.â 1t leaked out this
week that General Kitchener had a nar
row escape from -death through treachery
during the battle of Omdurman. He was
riding with his staff in front of a Souda
nese battalion, which was advancing,
when at least a dozen bullets whistled
past his head. General Kitchener gal
loped as fast as he could and word was
sent to the officer commanding the batta
lion. There is no doubt the perpetrators
were some of the recently enlisted Der
veshes. .

States Will Permit the

Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 24.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Major
General Wade, chairman of the Ameri
can Cuban Commission, has nqt re
ported, to the W r ar Department the de
termination of the Spanish authorities
to remove to Spain the ashes of Co
lumbus and the monument erected over
them. Acting Secretary of War Meikle
john told me to-day that when Embas
sador Cambon, representing the Madrid
Government, signed the peace protocol,
Spain relinquished her sovereignty over
the island 'and agreed to an immediate
evacuation of her troops.
"General Blanco has no right," he
continued, "to take up the monument
and remains and ship them to Spain.
As an abstract question, it is my opin
ion that this Government has a right
to object to such action, but nothing of
the kind has yet been done."
It is not believed at the War Depart
ment that General Blanco has directed
the removal of the ashes of Columbus
without first learning the views of the
American Commission. Should Spain
particularly request that she be per
mitted to retain the dust of the great
discoverer, however, no doubt IS' ex
pressed that her wishes would be re
spected.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1898.
BURLINGAME HORSE SHOW
COMES TO A BRILLIANT END
THE fates dealt kindly with the mem
bers of Burlingame Club who wore
the patrons of the open-air horse
show on their grounds. Hardly had
the curtain been drawn yesterday on one
of the most remarkable exhibitions of
that character ever given when came the
rain, abruptly.
The events for the second day brought
out in strong relief the features of a
programme that from the start had been
a matter of comment by all so fortunate
as to be the guests of the gentlemen
charged with the promotion of the exhi
bition. As much care and attention were
bestowed upon the horses and their ap.
pointments as though they were being
sent into the ring at the national show
in Madison Square Garden. The stand
ard has not been lowered since the shows
held in this city and never will be low
ered while the gentlemen associated with
the show which closed yesterday lind
pastime in riding and driving.
The most interesting events were held
in reserve for the larger attendance
which it was known would be attracted
yesterday. Those under whose patron
age the affair was held were not dis
appointed. Although the first horses en
tered the ring at 10 o'clock, the specta
tors, chiefly ladies, were present to give
them greeting. There were additions
from time to time until the intermission
for luncheon. When the guests assem
bled again in the afternoon the grounds
presented a brilliant spectacle. The la
dies wore their brightest gowns, and filled
the tribune, from which they viewed the
Judging, to overllowing.
Â alter Hobart carried off all the honors.
Whether it was with single horses, pairs,
tandems, four-in-hands or diminutive po
nies that he competed, the blue ribbons
denoting victory were worn proudly by
his representatives. He Feemed tireless,
handling his horses in all the classes. He
wore a gray golf cap, blue cutaway coat,
riding breeches of dazzling whiteness ana
top boots.
slr. Hobart created the greatest sensa
tion with a pair of ponies in the tandem
class. The leader stepped out as though
he could walk on egg shells withouv
crushing them. Later the same ponies
formed part of a dainty four-in-hand.
They were shown in the pony class, but
the' judges felt they were in a class by
themselves and awarded them a special
blue ribbon. Mr. Hobart scored again In
the tandem class with a stout pair of
bays. These appeared again with his
four-in-hand coacn team and again car
ried off the much coveted blue ribbon.
HiÃ poorest showing was made in the
jumping classes. The blame must rest
with his "leppers," which persisted in
beating a rataplan on the hurdles each
time they were sent at them. Mr. Ho
bart's favorite mounts were Lady Green
sleeves and Royalty, a slashing gray.
This horse was purchases at the New
York Bhow two years after his present
owner had seen him clear the remark
able height of 7 feet 1 inch. All the
horses ridden yesterday have been badly
schooled over the jumps. Instead of be
ing made to stand off from their fences,
they arÂ© allowed to breast them and
clamber Over as best they may.
The only approach to a casualty during
the day was in the Jumping. Joe Irvin,
a groom, fell with his horse and was roll
ed in the dust. He was soon up, and, nis
Fair Drivers Act Well Their Parts in the Exhibition.
horse being caught, he sent him over the
hurdles again, this time in safety.
The last event on the programme be
fore luncheon was the sporting tandem.
The competitors were W. S. hobart, R.
M. Tobin and John Lawson. They drove
in with tandems, each attended by a
groom. The competition was to unhitch
the leader of the horses, unharness him
and then get him under saddle. The sad
dles were stowed away in the depths of
the carts. Mr. Hobart was again success
ful, being the first mounted.
The ladies were afforded an opportunity
to show their skill as drivers during the
afternoon. Their first appearance was be
hind single horses to driving traps. Prin
cess Poniatowski won with Silver King,
Miss Scott second with her horse Lancer
and little MUs KruttsehnfCt third.
Mrs. XV. S. Hobart caught the judges'
eyes in the competition for pairs, Mrs. C.
A. Baldwin was second with John Par
rott's clever pair of, Paquiia and Pepita,
and Mrs. J. S. Tobln was third. The la
dies were loudly applauded as they guid
ed their horses about the show ring.
The success of the show proved a sur
prise to those who assisted in the ar
rangements. Visitors competent to juage
fironounce it superior to any held under
ike conditions in any part of the world.
The majority of the horses were Califor
nian-brt'd. making the showing all the
more creditable.
The idea of the exhibition was carried
to a successful outcome through the ef
forts of Major J. L. Rathbone. He is
president of bÂ«th the Burlingame Club
and of the Horse Show Association. He
has been untiring in his efforts on behalf
of the show since it first took form. He
was congratulated on all sides for its suc
cessful outcome both from the standpoint
of an exhibitor and from that of a spec
tator.
Richard Graham again proved his effi
ciency as ringmaster, never permitting
the proceedings to lag for a moment.
Trumpeter Hardy of Troop B, Fourth
Cavalry, handled the coaching horn. He
is a celebrity in the army. While serving
in Kansas he was called to the East to
sound "tapsâ all lights out" at the fu
nerals of General Grant and General
Sherman.
Of the exhibitors J. D. Grant was a
good second to Mr. Hobart. He was sec
ond to that competent reinsman In trie
four-in-hand competition for drivers and
also carried off third prize with his quar
tet of bays.

GRAPE-NUTS.
NO 10 O'CLOCK LUNCH.
A Food That Sustains the Body
After Common ij'ood Is
Exhausted.
With many people there comes a
feeling of faintness and need for food
before the noon hour Is reached. This
is generally because of the use of
white bread and other non-nourishing
articles of food used for breakfast. 'It
is a cause of comment among those
who use the concentrated food, Grape-
Nuts, that no feeling of hunger is felt
until the noon hour. The facts show
forth that the food is sustaining and
nourishes and feeds the body hours
after the power of ortjjlnary food is ex-
hausted.
A few days Mai of Grape-Nuts tells
the tale.
Found at grocers, and made by the
Postum Co., at Battle Creek, Mich.

BLACK'S SUPPORTERS
EXPOSE THEIR HAN^
Hope to 3>efeat Roosevelt by Proving
He Is not a Resident of
New York.
A.LBANY, Sept. 24.â The supporters of
Governor Black have at last exposed
their hand, which has been responsible for
their great confidence in their ability to
defeat Colonel Roosevelt for the guber-
natorial nomination. Colonel Roosevelt,
they say, is "ineligible" to run as a candi
date for Governor in this State at this
time. Superintendent of Public Works
Aldridpe, with a delegation of '..epubli
cans who have been affiliated with him in
the fight for Governor Black's renomina
tion as against Colonel Roosevelt, left for
New York City yesterday to tell Sen
ator Platt and the local Republican lead
ers why Mr. Roosevelt is "ineligible" for
the nomination, and when the matter has
been placed before him and his associates
In that city, the Black men say, Colonel
Roosevelt will no longer be mentioned as
a candidate for Governor.
When Colonel Roosevelt was sworn in
as Assistant Secretary of the Navy he
swore to his residence as Washington, D.
C. The Federal constitution, however,
provides that persons holding office in the
Federal Government retain their residence
in the State from which they are appoint
ed, but when Colonel Roosevelt resigned
from the Navy Department, he retired
to private life. " Thereafter he enlisted in
the army, and, in accepting his commis
sion, again swore to his residence as
Washington, D. C.
While this Is the primary ground of the
contention, it is claimed that further evi
dence of his ineligibillty is afforded in the
fact that when he was assessed for per
sonal property in the town of Oyster Hay
he later appeared before the Tax Com
missioners and swore off the assessment
upon the ground that he was not a resi
dent of Oyster Bay but was a resident of
Washington. P. C.
NEW YORK, Sept. 24.â Colonel Theo
dore Roosevelt, when seen in regard to
the matter, said he did not care to make
any statement. The story, ho declared,
of his not being a resident of New York
State was without foundation. Colonel
Roosevelt did not seem very much wor
ried about the matter.
EX-CONVICT ARRESTED
ON A MURDER CHARGE
Oregon Authorities Believe They
Have the Slayer of Rancher
Bay Sink.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 24.â W. H.
Mageers, an ex-convict from the Oregon
penitentiary, was arrested in this city
on suspicion of being the murderer of Ray
Sink, the wealthy farmer from W'asco
County, whose body was found in the
Willamette River on Tuesday near Salem.
Sink was last seen alive in the company
of Mageers on September 13. The pris
oner stoutly asserts his innocence.
Mageers was arrested at the Depot
Hotel to-day in the company of two girls,
Nannie Quigley and Kate Lane, whom he
introduced as his wife and niece respec
tively. Mageers is known to have spent
considerable money during the past few
days, and the police say that they have
strong evidence that lie murdered Sink.

THORPE PILOTS
THREE WINNERS
Hard-Fought Finishes at
Sacramento.
TRIO OF LUCKY FAVORITES
ZABBO LANDS AT ODDS OF
8 TO 1.
Old Bed Glenn Outfoots Chihuahua
and Ocorona Beats a Field of
Two-Year-Olds to the
Wire.
i
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 24.â The Satur
day crowd at the park this afternoon wit
nessed some excelent racing, hard-fought
finishes being the rule of the day. Char
ley Thorpe again carried off the saddle
honors, piloting Obsidian, Ocorona and
Zarro over the line in front. Favorites
earned brackets on three occasions.
On past performances Miss Dividend
looked the most eligible of the seven
starters in the opening five and a half
furlong scramble, and she carried the
bulk of the coin bet, at even money. In
front almost from the start, the mare
won handily by a length. By hard riding
riggott landed Joe Levy in the place, a
length before Ockturuck.
The band of two-year-olds starting in
the five-furlong sprint which followed
gave Starter Ferguson a raft of trouble.
Nilgar, the second choice, twice made a
circuit of the track with Houck during
false breakaways, and "burned up" con
siderable coin. Thorpe, on the favorite,
Obsidian, finally got away in front, and
at the wire won galloping from Gilt
Edge. Petal managed to take the show
after a tempestous tour.
Red Glenn was "Hawkins 1 horse" to
day, and hauled down the third purse for
"Bill Murry" without much effort on Pig
gott's part. Chihuahua, with Glenn,
ruled an 8 to 5 favorite, and, though mak
ing a strong bid for the fat end of the
prize, was downed a length. Lady Ash
ley, ridden by Wilson, was accorded con
siderable support, but "Pudd'nhead" got
the mare cut off turning into the stretch
and brought up in the show. Red Glenn
was quoted 5 to 2 throughout the betting,
as the distance was considered too short
for him.
It was said the stables made an effort
to scratch Ann Page irom the six furlong
two-year-old run, and this made bettors
shy of speculating on ncr chances. Pig
gott was up, though, and she ruled equal
choice in the betting with Thorpe's Oco
rona. As usual the speedy Magdalenes
showed first as the stretch was reached,
but the sultry air there had its effect on
htr affected breathing apparatus, for she
was puffing like a locomotive. Ocorona
soon assumed the front position, and at
the wire led i Ann Pas-o out by four
lengths in 1:16.
The St. George filly Stepabout was her
alded as the "goods" in t.ie final event of
the day, a seven furlong selling affair,

IRISH LANDLORD
GETSTHE SEAT
Blakiston-Houston Sent
to Commons.
THE NORTH DOWN ELECTION
CLANCY TELLS OF THE IN
TERESTING RESULT.
i
Painful Picture of Life in the West
of Ireland Furnished by
an Inspector of
Schools.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DUBLIN, Sept. 10.â The North Down
election about which I wrote in my last
letter has resulted in the return to Par
liament of Mr. Blakiston-Houston, the
landlord and Ministerialist candidate;
but the majority of the victor was
rather inconsiderable. On a poll of
something between 7000 and 8000 votes
the one candidate topped the other by
2SO. From the point of view of the
Catholic and Nationalist majority of
Ireland it did n<>t really matter which
of the two candidates was fleeted. Both
professed the ( same political principles,
which were directly antagonistic on
every point to those of that majority.
Nevertheless, the Catholic and Nation
alists in North Down, who number SOO
on the electoral roll, are said to have
voted to a man in favor of the success
ful candidate. They probably did so
because Blakiston-Houston was a local j
man, while Corbett, the defeated can- j
dtdate, was a London Scotchman, if I ;
may use such an expression, and there- \
fore looked at least like an unscrupu- j
lous person whose main object was to j
get a seat in Farltament anyhow. But j
the real moral of this election Is that
the landlord party in the Orange part j
of Ulster have more influence left with
the mass of the people than might have j
been expected. A very considerable
proportion of farmers whose views on j
the subject of land legislation have al
ways been fiercely combated by the
landlords must, on this occasion, have
voted for the landlords" candidate. How
this came about I profess myself utter- I
ly unable to account. It only remains
to add that the new member for North
Down is not one to set the Thames on i
fire. He i.; like almost all the other !
Irish landlord representatives in the
House of Commonsâ that is to say, j
more or less of a "deadhead." This is i
a term, I think, which has been bor
rowed here from the expressive vocab- !
ulary of America; but if 1 am wrong in
that supposition, I may mention that
the word "deadhead" means with us
Irish a person intellectually incompe
tent and incapable.
1 observe tt at Mr. Chamberlain in j
the interview hich he is just reported
to have given to a New York Journal
ist has triedâ at least according to a
more merited report which I have Just
seenâ to convey to the American peo
ple the impression that the passing of
the local government act has at last
BOlved the Irish difficulty which has j
stared England in the face during the
last seven hundred years. If he has i
attempted anything of the kind it is j
simply foolish on his part, because as I
sure as the sun is in the sky at noon j
events will happen in due course which i
will smash his theory to atoms. The !
local government act transfers existing
powers of administration in local af
fairs from the minority to the majority,
but it is only the power of administra
tion and not the power to make laws
which has been effected, and what the '<
Irish people want is power to do both
the one thing and the other, and it !
may be safely affirmed that the mass
Of them will never be satisfied with ;
anything leÂ«R. Mr. Chamberlain, I may
add, knows ;i!l this as weil as anybody j
e\><- in the world. What prevented him
from becoming a Home Ruler in 1885 '
and 18sÂ»> I do not know, but he was j
actually more of a Home Ruler than
Gladstone himself when Gladstone's
conversion took place in the autumn
of 18S5, mid some of his descriptions of
the present system of governing Ire-,
land which he hr.d given in the earlier
part of that year have since been
among the connomplaces of Irish Na
tionalist oratory. I have said that I :
do not know what transformed Mr.
Chamberlain from being an advocate
of home rule into being its most bitter
opponent: but in Ireland at ltast it is
believed that an Incident which took
place in the early summer of IHo.'i had
something to do with that "notable
change. He was then a friend and col- j
league in the Government of Sir Charles
Di'ike, the "Republican Baronet," as !
he was called, and the two politicians
â who were th^n the "rising hopes" of
the English Radical party proposed to j
pay a political visit to Ireland. It was !
: sary, of course, for their, to secure
in advance either the favor or the '
neutrality of the Irish National party,
and the story is that -they applied for
either the one or the other to one 01
t'\<> of the Nationalist leaders and that
they got a decided rebuff. Thereupon
the intended visit was abandoned and
Boon afterward Mr. Chamberlain de
veloped into ax first-class antl-hom*Â» j
ruler. He is. it appears, still posing in |
that capacity.

Fred A. Pollock. Manager.
CAPTAIN GREER, a Distinguished Turfman of Ireland.
i report which has juat been published
Iby the head inspector of national
j schools in Connaught. This gentle
i man, a Mr. Sullivan, remarks that the
j attendance in most .schools is, compar
atively speaking, good in winter; but
only when the winter is mild, and that
â  for an obvious reason. "A very large
! proportion of the children of this prov
ince (Connaught),' says Mr. Sullivan,
j "is poorly fed and very poorly clad. It
1 is painful to see â as an inspector can
j not fail to see â little groups of bare
' footed boys and girls, miserably clad,
trying to make their way on a winter's
: morning to the neighboring school. In
| such cases we hope that the school
; room, when reached, may make these
I poor children warm and comfortable.
j Unfortunately, this is not the easy.
' My experience, and it is extensive, is
that the schoolroom which awaits most
children after their walk over bleak
roads or paths, is a cold, cheerless
! apartment." And the inspector goes
i on to speak of the spectacle presented
by the few sods of turf placed on the
| hearth and lighted, but giving no heat,
; or, rather, a little heat and a mass of
i smoke, and of the miserable children
wh<> had just come in and who sat
! quiet, melancholy looking and shiver
ing opposite their respective desks. On
I inquiry the inspector was toid that it
i was '"a bad year for turf"; but the fact
is that it is always "a bad year for
turf" â and for everything else â in some
i parts of Connaught. The oonsequences,
j so far as the spread of education is
I concerned, are disastrous. Among
them is an insufficient and unpunctual
attendance at school in those very
places where a sufficient and punctual
attendance would be of the greatest
importance. "Parents and children
feel," says the inspector, "that on a
I winter's morning their own cabins,
miserable as they are, are warmer
than the schoolroom, and consequent
ly the children either remain at home
| altogether in cold weather or postpone
: their departure for school until as late
!an hour as possible." After all the
I years of Turkish rule, we could not
' find such a state of things in Bulga
ria. In Ireland, after three centuries
of effective British control of Irish af
fairs, it is unfortunately a common
sight. It would be well if Mr. Cham
: berlain explained why it is so before
, he leaves the I'nlted States.
I suppose I need hardly say even to
] my purely American readers that the
] Doncaster "St. Leger" is one of the
greatest events of the racing year in
I England. It is the greatest, indeed,
after "the Derby," and the winner of
! "the Derby." generally speaking, wins
the St. Leg^r, too. This year Jed
dah, who won the Derby in June, was
considered "a dead certainty" for the
other race. lie has, however, been
beaten in "a canter" by "Wildfowler, an
Irish horse. This incident is natural
j ly a matter of pride to Irishmen, most
| of whom take delight in racing, and it
is all the more remarkable coming, as
it does, after the victories of that other
Irish horse, Galtee More, last year in
: not only "the Derby" and the "St. Le
per." but also in "the* two thousand

that Irish horses in that country now
usually sell at a VPry high figure, while
English owners of race horses are set

. land in the belief that the soil and the
climate of the country are specially
favorable to the production of first

VOLCANIC ASH IN
M'CLOUD RIVER
REDDING, Sept. 24.â During the last
few days the waters of the Sacramento
River at Red Bluff have been muddy
as though the volume had been In
creased by the dirty fioodwaters from
up-country water sheds. A rise in the
stream of five or six inches is reported
and considerable drift is floating sea
ward.
The people of Red Bluff account for
this by asserting that the muddy water
and drift come down from the McCloud
River. They say that at the conflu
ence of the McCloud and Pitt rivers, the
latter stream is as clear as crystal,
while the McCloud Is turgid and
muddy.
Observation at Redding entirely up
sets the theory held by the people of
Red Bluff. The Sacramento River at
this point is as clear as at any time

during the year. There has been no
perceptible rise in the stream, nor is
there any drift floating seaward. But
a singular phenomenon, first noted on
the McCloud River and now observ
able at Redding, is exciting considera
ble speculation.
Throughout the present season, the
dryest known in this region, the waters
of the McCloud, clear and cold, have
presented a milk-white appearance as
though floating full of bright, shining
particles or supercharged with minute
air bubbles. The strange spectacle has
caused comment and created specula
tion among the residents along the
banks of the stream, as well as among
the hundreds of visitors who annually
spend their summer outings in the pic
turesque McCloud River region.
The best interpretation of this sing
ular phenomenon la advanced by Rob
ert Radcliffe. for years an attache of
the United States fishery at Baird. He
says that at the base of Mount Shasta
there is an extensive ! asm filled with
light volcanic ash. During an exces
sively dry season snowfields that in or
dinary seasons remain intact are
melted and the waters drain through
the ash into the McCloud River. The
fine, light particles, of which the vol
canic substance is composed, are what
give to the water its uncommonly
white appearance.
The present is the first season the
strange spectacle has been observed at
Redding.
A theory in explanation is advanced
by a few observers here that the white
substance is soda, and a few even say
that it acts as a strong aperient on ani
mals drinking of the waters.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 24.â After
many years of disappointment Sa.lt '
Lake City is about to see its Qherished
project', the construction of another j
railroad to California, carried out. So
often have various promoters of the en
terprise pretended to be able to con- |
struct the road without having the
necessary backing that the repeated
failures had made people distrustful of
all propositions relative to the building
of the line. But the enterprise now on
foot, that of the Utah and Pacific, hat
progressed so far that doubt has been
dispelled and confidence is felt that at
last a new rord to the coast is assured.
The developments of the last few days
have been of a character to satisfy the
public that the company means busi
ness. When the company was orgo.n
iced a short time ago it limited the an-
nouncement of its purpose to the state
ment that it would build a line from thc
pre?T.t terminus of the Oregon Sh rt
Line at Milford, Utah, southwesterly
to the Nevada State line, a distance of
seventy-six miles. Years ago the road
bed for this extension was built, but
the vicissitudes of the Union Pacific,
which then operated the Short Line
system, caused further work on the
line to be abandoned. This line is now
to be used by the Utah and Pacific,
being in such a state of preservation
that It will need only a small amount
of repairing. The new company has,
therefore, only to lay its rails. The
contract for this tracklaying has been
let and it is now certain that work
will begin within the next week. The
rails are to be supplied by the Short
Line Company, which is, of course, be
hind the project and has the steel on
hand. Ties have been purchased in
Eastern Orepon and Southern Utah,
and the first shipments will arrive at
Milford this week. All this insures the
speedy construction of the road to the
Nevada line.
There has been much speculation as
to the further intentions of the com
pany. As has been stated, it did not
at the outset promise to do more than
build the seventy-slx-mile extension, '
but now President A. W. McCune says
that it is its purpose to go on to a con
nection with the Santa Fe.
McCune is a man of wealth. His for
tune is believed to be increasing at the
rate of $50,000 a month from his British
Columbia mines and other interests.
He enjoys an advantage over most of
those who in times past have taken
hold of the project. He has money of
his own to put into the enterprise, and
he has other moneyed men associated
with him in the company. It is this
aggregation of capital that first in
spired public confidence in the Utah
and Pacific. It is now felt that Presi- j
dent McCune is not talking idly when
he says that it is a dead sure proposi- l
tion that the road will not be stopped
at the State line, but will be built on to
a connection with the California East
ern. Through this connection the com
pany expects to reach Southern Cali
fornia points and eventually San Fran
cisco.
The extension for which the contract !
has been let, it is believed, will be
ironed in three months, and it Is ex- i
pected that next season the new line
which will eventually extend to Cali
fornia will be in operation.

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES

I
"Tell Me What You Eat
and I'll Tell You What
You Are."
The human ostrich. You've seen him
probably, in the booth at the fair or
circus or on the platform of the dime
museum. He has toughened his stom-
ach to the consistency of leather, and
lunches on broken bottles, tacks or
tenpenny nails with seeming impunity.
He doesn't live long, of course, for he
sacrifices life to earn a lazy livelihood.
You would be amazed, perhaps, to be
told that you were something like the
1-M& K^/OSTI :H MAN] I_Jc
human ostrich in the character of your
diet, and the risk of life involved.
It is not necessary that you eat glass
and nails in order to resemble this
monstrosity. The man who plays the
part of the human ostrich is an ex-
ample of depraved appetite in its most
extreme and exaggerated form. The
depraved appetite of the average can-
didate for dyspepsia does not go farther
than hot bread and biscuit, rich pas-
tries, highly seasoned dishes and exces-
sively greasy foods. Add to this im-
proper cooking, haste in eating and
lack of proper Â£est after a meal, and
you have a condition very likely to re-
sult in disease and suffering.
Let it be remembered that the sole
object of food is nutrition; nutrition not
for the body as a whole only, but nutri-
tion for the varying needs of the sepa-
rate parts of the body; for the muscles,
the nerves, the brain, the blood. When
the stomach is in a state of healthy
activity, nature, by her remarkable
processes, takes the food you supply,
and distributes its starches and sugars,
its salts and phosphates according to
the needs of the separate organs of the
body. When the stomach is not in a
state of healthy activity nature does
her best, but the various dependent or-
gans of the body are put on short ra-
tions. There is not nourishment enough
to supply them properly.
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
A weakened stomach. A stomach in-
capable of performing its functions
fully. The liver and blood - making
glands work imperfectly. The natural
result is that the food is imperfectly di-
gested and only partly assimilated and
the channels of life are choked and
stopped by waste and putrescent mat-
: ter. Some people know where the
| trouble is. They locate it in the stom-
ach, because they have pain there after
I eating, an irregular craving for food,
or an appetite that eating does not sat-
isfy. There is heaviness after a meal,
a feeling of undue fullness. It is hard
; to breathe, there is such a stuffy feel-
I ing about the chest. There may be pal-
â  pitation or irregular action of the heart
and the sufferer imagines he has heart
; disease. Perhaps the stomach sours,
: and there are bitter risings, and belch-
i ings. These symptoms mark various
forms and stages of "weak stomach."
They will not all be present in every
case or in the earlier stages of the dis-
ease. Any one of these symptoms lo-
cates the trouble in the stomach and
the digestive and nutritive functions,
which are disturbed.
Quite often there is no apparent con-
nection between the stomach and the
symptoms of the disease. The victim
thinks it "liver trouble." heart failure,
or lung disease. There is a dull pain,
perhaps in the back or the side. The
spine aches, sometimes "in spots" and
sometimes through its whole length.
There may be a sharp stitch or pain
occasionally. Exercise makes the limbs
tremble and the heart beat violently, j
Perhaps to some of these symptoms J
there is added an obstinate, stubborn '
cough.
WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW?
It is another case of weaV stomach.
But, that is not where the pain is. Very
likely not. But that is where the
trouble is. The stomach has not been
able to properly feed the organs de-
pendent, upon it. They aro starving,
they are weak and they show their
I weakness in the aches and pains that
afflict the various parts of the body.
What will set the stomach right? There
is one remedy practically infallible in
its Results and that ono remedy is Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It
cures because t is made to cure just
the conditions of the stomach which
give rise to disease.
A COMMON SENSE VIEW.
If so many diseases beerin in the
stomach and nutritive system, why
should not some one remedy be com-
1 pounded, which by healing the stom-
ach would necessarily cure the dis-
eases of the organs dependent on it?
T' 's was the great question which Dr.
R. .V. Pierce set himself to answer.
Then follov ed a period of profound
study of the value of alterative and
tonic medicines.
The result was Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery, a medicine for the
stomach and the whole digestive and
nutritive system. The soundness of Dr.
Pierce's original theory, that diseases
which originate in the stomach must be
cured through the stomach, has been
1 proved in thousands of cases, where
one or several of the chief organs of
the body were involved in wasting dis-
eases, and an entire cure has been
i wrought by the use of the "Golden
I Medical Discovery."
By way of proof take the case of
] Rev. C. L. Mundell of Pinegrove, Gallia
| County, Ohio. He writes: "I suffered
from a dreadful feeling and weakness,
and in 1593 I lost my health altogether.
I went to one of the best doctors in the
State and he said I had heart, stomach!
liver and kidney trouble. His treatment
did me no good. I tried different kinds
of patent medicines, but got worse all
the timo; was so weak that I could not

walk any distance. If I walked up hill
or a little fast it seemed as though my
heart would jump out. I had almost
given up all hope, and my money was
all gone. Was scarcely able to make a
living. Finally I saw an advertisement
in one of the country papers that foi
twenty-one 1-cent stamps Dr. 1 ierce
would send me one of his 'Common
Sense Medical Advisers." So I sent ana
got one and bes-an to read concerning
diseases like my own. After consulting
the doctor himself I purchased at my
nearest drug store a bottle of Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and
a bottle of his 'Pleasant Pellets.' This
'vas In 1897, and now I am happy to say
that I am in the enjoyment of good
health, which I attribute to Dr. R. V.
Pierce, and I am so glad of my health
that I cannot say too much. I first re-
turn my sincere thanks to Almighty
God and then to Doctor Pierce."
The above is only a specimen case
take at random from thousands.
WHY IT IS SO.
In view of the foregoing facts It is
easy to explain why the "Golden Medi-
cal Discovery" is the best blood-purify-
ing nedicine. The stomach supplies
the blood. Draw pure water into a foul
cup and if you drink it you drink foul
water. No matter how pure the food,
if the stomach is foul you will have
foul blood. *jt. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery clea ses the blood by clean-
ing the stom h, invigorating the liver
and setting the blood making glands
at work.
Weak lungs are cured on the same
principle. Weak lun~s are inseparable
from a weak stomach. A wea,v stomach
does not ak.ays mean weak lungs, but
weak lungs always mean a weak stom-
ach. The weak stomach means lack of
sufficient nutrition, or the incapacity of
the stomach to digest the food an' 1 dis-
tribute the nutriment to repair the
waste an 1 loss of the body. The whole
medical profession recognizes this fact.
Their great prescription for weak lungs
and consumptijn is a fattening food,
condensed and asr lilable â which takes
the form of cod liver oii, either in all its
original nastiness, or with its offensive-
ness modified in some emulFive prepara-
tion. The theory is sound enough.
What t 1 Â» body needs is nourishment.
If you could nourish the body up to the
point of aggr^-'on against disease it
would protec* itself. Somehow cod
liver oil anr 1 its preparations never seem
to get as; fa â¢ as the weak lungs. They
fail because it is the stomach that needs
healing. Let the lungs alone. If you
can cure the stomach, invigorate the
liver ai.d set the blood making glands
to manufacturing, and start the current
of ffch, red blood throughout the sys-
tem, Nature w,ll take care that it does
its work o uilding up the body. That
is the basis of Dr. Pierce's cure for
weak lungs, the condition which by
neglect or bad treatment becomes con-
sumption.
HOW IT WORKS. .
How does the 1 treatment work in
practice? Mr. Noel W. Orvin of Lang-
ley, Alken County, S. C. finds that it
worked first rate in his case. He says-
"l was taken sick in July last year
and was not able to do any kind of
work until November. I . had been
coughing up small hard lumps for
about a year before I was taken down
I then called on a doctor, who attended
me # or â  two months, and said that one-
half of my left lung was gone and ad-
vised me to leave my , home (Charles-
ton, S. C.,) and go to the country, but
did not say what sort of disease I had
I thought it was consumption ard
wrote to you for advice; I took four
bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery, which has done me more
good than all the other medicines I
have ever taken.'' 0 â 
The doctor didn't say what was the
matter. But Mr. Orvin "thought it was
consumption." No wonder he thought
so, when the doctor told him one-half
of one lung was gone. But it does not
matter what the disease is called the
fact remains that Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery has cured thousands
of . such casesâ where there were
night sweats, hacking cough emacia-
tion, hectic flush, labored breathing and
great weak ess. Call the disease what
you please, "Golden Medical Discovery-
cures ninety-eight out of every hun-
dred such cases. These statements have
gl twofold claim on . your : attention [if
you are a . sufferer from a weak stom-
ach, - weak lungs, stubborn lmeerintr
cough, bronchitis, bleeding lungs or
an J i Of tl l ese kindred forms of disease
\Ahich * when, neglected or. improperly
treated, lead to consumption ; â¢
WILL, NOT 1 SERIATE.
There is one Important feature about
Golden Medical Discovery" which
cannot be too strongly emphasized It
contains no alcohol, or whisky, no
opium or n rcoties, neither sugar nor
syrup which so often disagree with tie
weak dyppentic stomach. Without any
of these things it preserves its medici-
nal qualitio perfectly and in any cli-
mate. It does not create, a craving for
injurious stimulants or narcotics.
DON'T BE DECEIVED.
If you are convinced that Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery is what you
need, do not allow any designing dealer
to palm off a substitute on you under
t specious plea that it is "just as
eood." If he has no respeot for your
Judgment show him that you have. Any
dealer can obtain this great standard
remedy for vou if you insist upon it. It
affords him a fair profit. It is his busi-
ness to supply what you ask for. and
not to urge some substitute on you for
DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
the sake of making a larger profit. ,
Your health is of vastly more conse-
quence than his profit. Let any substi-
tuting dealer understand that. .
! There are people everywhere who are
in ill-health. Medicine has not helped
them. They are out of heart and dis-
couraged. Dr. Pierce invites such to
write. to. him, freely and fully. After
careful consideration of the case a re-
ply is quickly made containing such in-
structions and fatherly advice as will
prove of the greatest benefit. There is

norance on Late Police
Actions.
Police Commissioner M. A. Gunst re
turned to this city last night after a ttve
months' pilgrimage of health in Euro
pean watering-places. His irip has been
successful in tliis respect, for he has re
turned with renewed health and a color
In his face which he did not have when
he left.
The gates were closed last night on
Commissioner Gunst's power of speech.
His lips were sealed and he refused to
talk on those affairs which are of espe
cial local interest. Jake Shaen. his
henchman, met him at Reno, and with
the assistance of Milton H. and Albert
Ksherg. Gunst's partners, he was suc
cessful in securing a graveyard silence.
At Sacramento Mr. Gunst was met by
his family. A large contingent met him
at Oakland, and a still larger force at
the foot of Markot street. Jesse Marks,
Albert Esberg and a few politicians
crossed the bay to shake hands with the
CommlsSioner, ar.d Henry Ach stood In
the rain waiting fur the boat to land.
Mr. Gun.si has visited health resorts
In England, France and Austria. The
greater portion of his time was passed In
I-.ad Na.ub.ein, one of Austria's greatest
medicinal sanitariums.
"I have regained my health," said Com
missioner Gunst on the incoming terry
boat last night, "and that w.is the ob
ject of my trip. Yes, 1 feel better in
health ana spirits, and will now be in a
better condition to go to work. When I
left here my physicians advised me to
ieave the cares of my business and poli
tics behind me, and I have been most
faithful to their counsels. It was abso
lutely necessary for me to drive all
thoughts of business and the Police De
partment out of my head. That 1 did,
and my regained health may or may not
have been tne result of a cessation of
mental worries."
Commissioner Gunst's protectorate al
lowed him to speak most loquaciously
concerning his health, but whenever
questions were asked which had a glim
mer of local interest attached to them
he was at once surrounded With a circle
of anxious faces whose expressions read
"Beware." They were most solicitous
not to allow their chieftain to be in
veigled into any controversy.
\\ hen asked if he had determined upon
any new Improvements for the Police De
partment Mr. Gunst said: "No, this trip
nas been for the resuscitation of my
health solely. I did not make any in
vestigations of the police systems of the
metropolises of Europe. That was the
object of my preceding journey. So lit
tle thought have I bestowed upon the
Police Department since my departure
that I -have no plans to propose as yet.
When J am settled then I will give my
time and attention to police affairs.
"In regard to the Carpenter case, In
which you say the police arrested a man
and charged him with the crime and sub
sequently were forced to release him, 1
can Bay nothing. 1 did not even read of
the case, for I was advised not to bother
my mind with any business affairs, no
matter what their nature.
"The Botkin case iirst came to my at
tention in New York, but I really have
nothing to say about it, as 1 am not con
versant with the details." Mr. Gunst
listened passively to the errors of the po
lice in their attempts t<> fasten the crime
upon the accused in several of our re
cent murders, but he would not venture
an opinion either of defense or censure
on their methods. He was happy to
learn that the great pride of the- depart
ment Chief Lees, was enjoying good
health, which bit of information was no
doubt imparted to him way up the road
by Jake Shaen. The injury or a boy by
a" policeman Friday night was next
brought to the attention of the Police
Commissioner, who took refuge at once
in declaring that he had not read the
Btory in the papers, but only glanced at
the headlines.
Commissioner Gunst will rest a few
days and then devote himself to busi
ness and the affairs of the Police De
partment. It is the current belief that
there will be a shake-up as Boon as tho
cigar man peels his coal and starts the
mill a-golng. Some upheavals are ex
pected by those who ar< on the Inside,
hut as yet Mr. Gunst wÂ» mute, like unto
the silence of the impenetrable sphinx.

The Local Manufacturers Are Appre
hensive of Philippine Com
petition.
Several days ago J. W. Kerr of the
Manufacturers' und Producers' Associa
tion submitted a resolution to the board
of directors in which the suggestion was
made that unless considerable care be
taken in the disposition of the Philippine
Islands, and in tht* event of the islands
coming into the Union, great injury might
result to maufacturers and labor in con
sequence of the cheap island trade coming
into competition with that of the United
State?. Mr. Kerr's resolution suggested
that Instead of annexing these islands the
Government establish a protectorate over
them Yesterday a full board of directors
considered that question, and after much
discussion, decided to knock out the pro
tectorate proposition and substitute the

Consolidation of Two Lodges of K. of

The consolidation of Justice Lodge No.
S5 with Golden City Lodge No. 63 of the
Knights of Pythias, which, in the cards
of invitation was designated as "the nup

in Pythian Castle in the presence of a
large number of Knights, including a del
egation from California Lodge. Herman
Schaffner, G. K. of R. and S., was the
officiating officer, and united the two
lodges, -which hereafter will be known as
Golden City Lodge, with George W. Mon
teith as chancellor. The ceremony, which
was very interesting, was followed by a
number of short speeches, and at the
close of the business the members
marched to the Cosmos rotisserie, where
more than 100 partook of an excellent
wedding supper. During the time that the
dessert was being served ChancellorMon

By the consolidation Golden City Lodge

having now more than $4500 to its credit.
MILLERS PAYING A
PREMIUM ON WHEAT
HOLDERS OF GRAIN ARE MUCH
MORE JUBILANT.
Indications Looking to Higher
Prices â Barley Assumes a
Fictitious Value.
Holders of grain were made more jubi
lant during the past week. Wheat and
barley 'in the local market show a large
| gain as compared with prices at the clos
ing ot" the previous week. The advance
came abuut in a natural way, supply and
demand ruling against speculative pres
sure to depreciate prices. The extreme
crop of wheat harvested continues so
: small that millers and exporters lind it
] necessary to pay from 3 to 5 per cent
premium for spot stuff. Millers' wants
j seem only started. Farmers will not sell
lat present prices. In many sections
throughout the East farmers' clubs aro
being organized, the purpose of which is
for the strong to help the weak. Those
who are compelled to sell their wheat
| are loaned enough money to carry them
i over until a more favorable opportunity
presents itself.
The most encouraging feature to the
market has been England's upward ten
dency. Russia's condition does not im
prove. This item of news stems to be
: shaping sentiment over to higher prices.
: Ihe average speculator is just beginning
to awaken to the fact that wheat prices
I aro low.
There appear as yet no reliable grounds
upon which to base this year's crop at
over 600.000.0vij bushels,- notwithstanding
that crop experts early estimated 700.(AW.
000 bushels. Threshing returns do not
cany uui such extravagant ideas. Allow
ing the crop harvested to have been
65u,000, 000 bushels, its distribution would
be:
Home use and 'cod 370,000,000
Average exports 150,000,000
Visible and invisible crop, July 1, ISS9. 130,000,000
Total 650,000.000
The exports to July 1, 1809, will reach
; 200,000,000 bushels. If the crop should fall
; short of the amount stated, which is
more likely?' than not. then the trade will
realize how completely the country was
swept of wheat at the starting of the
present crop year. Another -matter must
| soon be compiled anew. The consumption
of wheat at home has been | placed- .at
I 370,000,000 bushels for the past six years.,
It is fair to , suppose the population has
increased during that period. 'Why not
; home requirements? The time Is not far
: distant when home requirements will
j equal production, or very closely. The
world's production has not increased as
rapidly as its population. The world's
available supply is 21.000,000 bushels less
than a year ago, and 60,000,000 bushels
less than two years ago. The supplies in
all positions at the present time in and
! afloat for Europe are about 37,000,000 bush
| els. The smallest quantity ever reported
as Russia's shipments are 55 per cent less
than last year. Argentina may not be a
competitor for eighteen months.
Judging existing conditions throughout
the wheat eating and growing world there
i seems no logical reason to anticipate ex
| treme low prices for wheat this year.
! Locally wheat prices are above those of
other market centers. Temporarily prices
, may be high enough, but that eventually
| they will sell higher seems reasonably
â  sure.
The Washington and Oregon crops are
proving much less than generally expect
j ed: The increased demand for flour to
China, Japan and the Philippines will
absorb all the surplus of this coast, with
what has already been sold to Europe.
Pacific Coast markets are rapidly grow
ing independent of those of Europe and
the East. As time goes on the fact will
; be more apparent. ---
i - Barley twisted the shorts during the
â  latter part of the .week. December sold
at $1 za% against $1 12&,' the low point.
The advance in barley is more in the
nature of a squeeze. No doubt the bulls
will try to work the price up somewhat
higher so as to give, the shorts nervous
prostration. When this is done, no doubt,
there will be plenty of barley for sale.
It is not worth present prices. Artificial
values are not those of profit. â¢

Major Matthews' Report of His
Work to the Surgeon Gen

Major Matthews, the surgeon in charge
of the Division Hospital, yesterday com
1 pleted his report to the surgeon general
at Washington. In the report .Niajor
Matthews covers the entire time that the
: Division Hospital has been in existence,
which is from June 2 up to yesterday.
â¢ After giving a detailed statement of the
total number and kinds or' cases treated
; and the number of deaths resulting from
the same, the major makes the foflowlÃg
) report in his letter. It needs no comment:
"While the climatic and soil conditions at Camp
Merrltt were bad the sickness would certainly
have been much less had a higher degree of
â¢ discipline be.ii maintained and had tjie offl
i cers seen to It that the ordinary rules oÂ£ per

i observed and enforced.
The statistics of the report completely
contradict for all time the sensation.-U ar
tlclea published some time ago in the Ex
aminer and Chronicle regarding the rav
ages of sickness that was reported to be
daily carrying off the soldiers.
There have been treated at the hospital 1!WO
cases and there have been only eighty-four
I deaths. Taking the Kighth Army Corps, com
! posed of 21.iJ()0 men, the percentage of aickness
. has been 7 per cent and the mortality 4 per
. cent. This makes the Eighth the healthiest
corps In the Government service. There have
, been 16S cases of typhoid fever, with twenty
three deatos, while out of 102 cases of pneu
monia there have been thirty-nine deaths. A
great cry was raised In the press about the
epidemic of typhoid fever, whereas pneumonia

There have been 623 cases of measles treated,
with no deaths. There have been two deaths
from diphtheria, two from sc-irlet fever, one

MEN OF THE SIXTH
WANT TO GO HOME
DESIRE TO BE MUSTERED OUT
OF THE SERVICE.
Colonel Johnson Willing to Remain
in Command, but Ready to
Accede to the Wishes of
the Privates.
Nearly every man of the Sixth Califor
nia Regiment has expressed a desire to
be mustered out of the military 'service
of the United States. That expression
was made in a manly way at the request
of Colonel Johnson. On Thursday Col
onel Johnson called out his command,
and on their parade ground at Fort Point
asked the men. In a short address, what
was their desire. â¢ He said the majority
of the officers were In favor of remaining
in the service, "but I know," he said,
"that many of the privates are equal, if
not superior, to most of the offlot/rs, and
the officers receive good salaries. I re
ceive $2fiO a month as commander of this
regiment, but -I do not want to retain my
commission or my salary at the expense
of you men. The men who wish to be
mustered out will please step to one
side."
"When the roll was counted 848 men
were found to have expressed a desire
to be sent to their homes. They repre
sented nearly 85 per cent of the command,
and Colonel Johnson was satisfied that it
was the desire of the men to be mus
t'T.'d out as soon as possible, unless they
were sent to the front to furtive, service.
Yesterday It was said tEe orders given
some weeks ago to musm out the regi
ment had been modlfied.^ind that it now
rested with the department commander
whether they would join the next expe
dition to the Philippines or not. The
men, however, do not look upon the re
port with favor, and say it is only an
other excuse to keep up the hopes of the
men. while their private business suffers,
and the officers have excuses to retain
their commission and 'draw good sala
ries.
The orders to muster out the regiment
are progressing slowlyâ too slow, in fact,
to suit the men. Many of the privates
are complaining of favoritism in musUr
ing out men. Some men favored by their
captains have no trouble in getting out
of the service, while the requests of
many others, they say, are ignored.
THE RICHTER BENEFIT.

pany I, First California Infantry, who
was mortally wounded in the battle of
Manila on the night of July 31. It is
estimated that at least $3000 will be real
ized from the benefit and this amount
will be used for the best interests of the
widow and four children that Captain
Richter left to mourn his loss. In addi

JUDGE MOGAN
GOES ON A
LABOR STRIKE
Refuses toTry tHe Case
Against Falk.
SAYS HEJS. OVERWORKED
MARKET INSPECTOR DAVIS ON
THE WARPATH.
Will Seek the Grand Jury's Aid
to Make the Judge
Try the
Case.
A peculiar complication has arisen -out
of the arrest of .ll. Falk, the restauran
teur at 211 Fourth street, who was taken
into custody the day before yesterday by
Chief Market Inspector Ben Davis, on a
charge of having diseased pork in his
possession. It is . customary In these
cases, where the ' Inspector catches an
offender with proofs of guilt In his pos
session, for no warrant to be sworn out, ;
but an arrest Is made Immediately and
the complaint is drawn up and sworn to
afterward.
Davis followed this course and Falk,
after his arrest, was released on bond.
Yesterday-morning: Davis found that the
case had been assigned by Sergeant Mc-
Donald to Police Court 1 for trial.
The Inspector accordingly drew up a for
mal complaint against Falk and went to
the courtroom to swear ) to it before
Judge Mogan. The latter refused to re
ceive it. Davis says:
i "The Judge declined to have anything
to do with the case. I told him that it
had been regularly assigned to his court
and that I was only doing my duty to
come before him with the complaint.
Still he refused to allow me to make an
affidavit and told me to go to some other
Judge, as he did not propose to be longer
imposed upon.-* He had too much work.
I refused to go. It is not my business to
chase around through the different courts
hunting for a judge to try my cases.
â¢ "Suppose that 1 did it. The other
Judges would very properly tell me to
go back to the Judge to whom the case
was assigned. Judge Mogan's excuse was
that he had too much to do. That is no
affair of mine. I am not to blame if he
gets more than his share of the trials.
The. case was assigned to his court and I
had no authority to make any change.
When he refused to take my affidavit, I
went to the Prosecuting Attorney and
he told me the; only thing to do was to
bring the case to the attention of the
Grand Jury. Since then I have been de
termined to present the whole - matter
to the jury and see whether or not. Judge
Mogan can be made to attend to this
case." .'
Dr. Williamson, when made acquainted
with the facts of the case, stated that as
a member of the Board of Health, he
fully indorsed the -stand taken by In
spector Davis. . "It is not the duty of our
officers to hunt Judges to try their cases,"
remarked the doctor, "and they will not
do it, either." .
Judge Mogan's side of the case is briefly
this: v He claims that more than a fair
share of the Police Court work has been
shoved -upon r him of late and that the
other Judges, have A had . too much play
time. He said: "It is a case of running a
willing horsf* to deaths I' don't propose to
stand it any longer.' Nearly all of the
jury trials come to me and a good deal
else. Some of the other Judges can step
in and attend to Davis' case."
SCAVENGERS' UNION
VERY APPREHENSIVE
its 'members may lose their
OCCUPATION.
Decision of the Supervisors That the
City Shall Collect Its Garbage
Causes the Trouble.
The appropriation of $150,000 by the
Board of Supervisors for the collection
and reduction of the city's garbage for
the next six months has filled the mem
bers of the Scavengers' Union with appre
hension lest they find themselves in
Othello's plight. They held a meeting
Thursday night and discussed various
methods of presenting their grievance 10
the City Fathers in order to prevail upon
them to rescind their action.
It is claimed by the men who handle
refuse that they will lose their means of
existence, and they assert that nearly
four thousand mouths look to them for
dally food. They figure that the twelve
hundred men who operate the wagons
support from three to four times their
own number, and they denounce in un
measured terms the attempt to deprive
them of the fruits of a business which
they have built up only years of in
dustry and enterprise.
Now, they declare, the Sanitary Re
duction Works, of which corporation ex-
Mayor L. R. Ellert is president, will have
a monopoly of the garbage business.
While that corporation has -enjoyed the
exclusive right to cremate the city s
garbage, its collection has b*?n left to the
individual scavengj&Pfl. when the latter
privilege shaU have been taken from
them, they say, there will be nothing left
for them to do but to dispose of their
teams for whatever they will bring and
seek employment elsewhere.
Outside of the intrinsic value of their
teams the scavengers control certain defi
nite routes, fixed by their union, and ijiese
have heretofore had a market value
ranging from $2500 to $3000 each. These
will now be valueless, and if the com
pany directed by ex-Mayor Ellert puts
its own teams to work as it un
doubtedly will on the score of economy,
the scavengers will indeed find them
selves confronted by a serious outlook.
His Horse Fell on Him.
Louis Hohn, 220 "Valencia street, was
riding a horse along- Julian avenue yes
terday morning, when the horse slipped
and fell. Hohn was extricated with diffi
culty from under the animal and was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where a
was found that he had sustained a double
fracture of both bones of the right leg.

tnis paper. ' Â°
A young lady In New York City relates the curious case of heVsfstet
who suffered from a sort of nervous dyspepsia â that was what the doc- '
tor called it. She was despondent How-spirited,' inclined to imagine all ..
forts of things. One thing especially seemed to be in her mind ;, that
was the idea that abscesses were forming in different parts of her body.
; The sister, who tells' the story had found Ripans Tabules a specific for
V- headache, and generally had a supply on hand. One day, incJre in ,
joke than in earnest, she said to the afflicted one : 'â¢ Try these t "
.they'll 1 cure you." Well, she did try them, aryi strangely enough the
Tabules did cure her. The despondency left her. This was nearly .
H year ago. She took less than a dollar's worth in aIL and has-QQl*^
taken one for over eight months .now."

GOLD BRICK
WORTH THREE
BIG MILLIONS
Peter J. Cox Tried to Emulate
Swiftwater Bill, but
Failed.
He Won a Pretty Girl and a Solicitous Mother
in-Law, Who Would Like to Collect
Five Hundred.
Verily the way of the most ardent
female leg-puller Is hard sometimes
and her experience is oft to be com
pared to that of the purchaser of a
gold brick. The Examiner* bought a
gold brick last August and presented
It to its readers in the shape of a story
In which Peter J. Cox was the hero. It
told about Ptter J. Cox coming from
Alaska with $3,000,000 to bur- holes in
his pockets, and a consuming desire to
enjoy life in San Francisco for a while.
The story, misleading as it" was, gave
the tip to the horde of ladies and gen
tlemen who were willing to assist Mr.
Cox to pass the time pleasantly at his
expense and to guarantee that he
would not become bored. They were
of the same class of people that chased
Swiftwater Bill all over town and into
the wilds of Alaska in order to get a
whack at his dough.
Peter Cox had a good time for the
month or so in which he remained here
and went home to Lawrence, Mass.,
after spending about fifteen hundred
dollars and is now reported to be al
most on his .uppers, there being but
very little left of the balance of his
original $^S50 â the latter amount being
all he possessed in the world.
Among tli~ ttrst strangers to seek the
acquaintance of young Mr. Cox â
fur he is not much more than 30 years
oldâ were Mrs. Woodhull and her
pretty daughter of 19. They read the
Examiner story and called on the sup- j
posed millionaire at his hotel to in
quire whether in the course of his
ramblings through the glaciers of
Alaska he had met or heard of Mrs. j
Woodhull's nephew, named Gardner,
â who was supposed to be roaming about
the Antk- wilds somewhere or any old
whore.
Mr. Cox lik^d the young lady and reÂ»
turned the visit to the Woodhull dom
icile, suite 45, in the top story of 606
Montgomery street, between Clay and
Merchantâ a building occupied princi
pally as offices for lawyers and other
business people. In fact, he made sev
eral visits and took the young 1 iy and
her mamma one evening to a theater
party entertainment. Then he pro
posed marriage to Miss Woodhull and
was accepted, the fact that he had a
wife and family in Lawrence being for
gotten or ignored by him. As an evi
dence of his wealth and the sincerity
of his love he presented his fiancee with
a draft for $500. The draft was never
paid and it was put into the hands of
a collection agency in this city for col
lection, but word has come back from
Lawrence that Cox is impecunious and
that the draft is worthless.
Instead of being a millionaire three
times over, as represented by the fake
Fhret, Cox was a lively young
man with a great capacity for liquor
and the smiles of pretty women. His
father was an old-fashioned country
butcher who slaughtered cattle on his
farm on the Lowell road three miles
from Lawrence. Later he removed
into the city of Lawrence and opened
a small meat market with a llauor and
beer attachment. Peter J. was the
only child of the couple, and when he
loft school after the death of his father
hÂ» studied medicine in the office of a
physician, but not finding that noble
science to his liking he went to work
in a mill where hf> couM oarn some
thing without killing anybody. He mar
ried a good looking French girl of that
oity and has a family of little Coxes.
His mother married again and after
her death the estate, consisting of two
GREEN NOW WANTS
TO FIGHT SMITH
SAYS THAT McCONNELL NEEDS
ONLY EXPERIENCE.
Local Athletic Clubs Are Very Anx
ious to Match Tom Sharkey
and Jim Corbett.
George Green was about town yester
day feeling good over his late victory.
He had very little to say about McCon
nell, pxeepting that the defeated middle
weight would prove a very dangerous man I
If he was better drilled in foot work and
had more experience. Green says that his
only ambition now is to meet Billy Smith
again in this city.
"You see that we are even up now,"
said Green, "and a third meeting should
decide who is the better man. I whipped
him in Carson and he bested me in the
East. I do not offer an excuse for my
defeat, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that
the excessive heat weakened me to such
an extent that after going ten rounds the
effects of the heat commenced to tell upon
me. However, if Smith wants another
trial I will give it to him, but the con
test must be decided here."
McConnell felt very sore at heart yes
terday. He was too confident of whip
ping Green, and as a consequence his
friends bot large sums on him. He is of
the opinion now that if he had agreed
not to hit in the clinches a different re
sult would have been announced. Mac
thought that at close range fighting he
would certainly have the better of the
game, as he relied upon his right, to do
heavy damage at short range, but he
found his opponent up to snuff and a
better general at that style of fisticuffs.
Green invariably got his head, or rather
his jaw, out of the way when danger was
near, and McConnell's right hand punches
landed on the back of his head or neck.
At long range fighting the San Francisco
Athletic Club champion would certainly
have had a better chance of defeating his
opponent, and the rules under which he
fought Tracey would have given him a
much better opening to get In his auc
tioneer.
McConnell would have no objection to
another meeting with Green, >ut as he
has suffered two defeats within two
months it is not prooable that his serv
ices will be in demand until he has gained
more experience.
Harry Corbett is very desirous that the
National or Olympic club give something
like a $20,000 purse for a twenty-round
contest between Jim Corbett and Jim
Jeffries. The ex-champion has evidently
taken a good line on Jeffries' style of
fighting, and cunning jim is doubtless of
iho opinion that the face of the Orange
Grove champion vrould be just the size
of target which could be hit repeatedly
by a clever boxer. Corbett is also aware
of the fact that ducking from Jeffries'
telegraphic left-hand swings or hooks
would not be a hard task for him to per-
It is extremely doubtful if any of the
athletic clubs of this city would give more
than $5000 for a twenty-ronnd contest be
tween Jeffries and Corbett, as the mana
gers realize what a decidedly one-sided
contest it would prove to be. altnough al
lowing for Jeffries' age and preponder
ance of weight.
If Corbett is really anxious for a fight
that would create no end of excitement
houses and a small sum of money, was
given to Peter under the terms of his
mother's will, except that the step
i father had a life interest in one of the
j houses.
Peter had a serious quarrel with his
, wife and sold all his property and left
! for California. The sale of his share
!of the estate netted him $4100, one
third of which sum he gave his wife
las her share. This left his about $2800,
! with which he came to California and
I had a glorious time as an Alaskan mul
ti-millionaire.
Mrs. Woodhull when interviewed yes
terday expressed the greatest respeot
j for Mr. Cox. She told how after read-
I ing of his arrival she had gone to his
hotel to inquire of him whether he had
met her nephew in Alaska, how he had
returned the call at her humble apart
ments at 606 Montgomery street and
how he had asked her for the hand of
her beautiful daughter in honorable
wedlock. He was perfectly frank and
honorable in all his dealings and she
would not believe him otherwise than
what he was represented to be. She
was sitent as to the present of the
worthless draft for $500, a transaction
which would seem to indicate that he
was not so green as he looked. Mrs.
Woodhull said further that she feared
that he might be made away with for
! his money by designing persons, and so
when he had not turned up for two or
three days she aad her daughter called
at the residence of Mrs. Dr. Gericke,
i at 353 Geary street, and inquired for
! him. but she and her daughter were
! snubbed and insulted by Mrs. Gericke,
who, by the way, is a lady of about 60
years. She took a motherly interest in
the young man, while Mrs. Woodhull
took a motherly-in-law interest in him.
"My cheek burns with shame," con
tinued Mrs. Woodhull, "when I think
of the outrageous insults heaped upon
me and my daughter by that old wo
man."
Mrs. Dr. Gericke told how her daugh
ter, Mrs. Bates, came to be acquainted
with Cox. She was a passenger from
Portland on the same steamer with the
fake millionaire from Alaska and was !
attracted by his eccentricities. She j
made his acquaintance and finding him i
to be a nice gentleman informed him j
that her mother had furnishaS rooms
to let. After staying at the hotel for a
day or two he took a room at the Ger
icke residence and it was while living
there that Mrs. Woodhull and her |
daughter came to Inquire for hfm. !
AVhen Cox heard that his prospective
bride and her ma were at the door he
directed Mrs. Gericke to say that he
was not at home for he did not wish to
see them.
She *had a little money transaction
with Cox. It was a draft of $800 which
she cashed and kept for safe keeping,
Cox drawing unon her for money as he
needed it until he drew it all. He re
mained in her house only one month.
He told her one day that he had given
Miss Woodhull a draft for $500 while
he was in a generous spirit inspired by
alcoholic spirits and he repented having J
presented her with so large an amount, j
He asked Mrs. Gericke's advice about
paying it. and she advised him that
$50 would be a sufficient return for
whatever entertainment the mother
and daughter might have afforded him.
A few days afterward a private de
tective requested her to use her in
fluence with Cox and induce him to pay !
the draft, but she refused to do so.
The latest news from Cox is that he \
has made up with his French wife and '
is living with her and the babies again, j
and that although practically on his
uppers and limited in his capacity for
obtaining booze he is a happy father.
here he should, by all means, take on
Tom Sharkey, and it goes without saying
that a battle between Snarkey and Cor
bett would crowd the Mecnanies' Pavil
ion. But will Jim take fenarkey on? That
is the question.
Manager Groom received a letter from
"Kid" McCoy yesterday in which the lat
ter thanked the National Club for its of
fer and also stated that if the Hawthorne
Athletic Club, under whose auspices he
was to meet Corbett, could not pull off the
"go" he would be willing to enter into
negotiations with the local organization.
Through an inadvertence Maynard was
accused of acting disgracefully during
the preliminary bout on Friday evening,
when in fact "Kid" McFadden was the
guilty one. The latter's work was rather
coarse. Experts in the manly art ex
pressed their approval of Referee
Murphy's decision. They all concede that
Mcl< adden la a strong bo,y and might do
better in a twenty-round fight, but last
Friday night he was outpointed.
Much discussion was aroused yesterday
over Lon Agnew's peculiar actions in the
ring. Many were of the opinion that Lon
was intoxicated, but friends of Agnew
claim that he has not indulged in over a
year. The true reason for his groggy
movements is that Agnew has Deeh
"batted" so often in the head that it has
set him "daffy." This is not apparent until
he is in the ring. One good blow has its
effect and his actions become deceiving.
These same friends say that had he been
allowed to go on he would have Improved
and made a monkey of Evans.
ILLNESS DROVE TO SUICIDE.
Augustine Grover Drowns Himself
While in Pain.
Despondency caused by illness is the
reason given for the suicide of Augustine
A. Grover. whose body was found in a
pool of water two miles below Ingleside
yesterday afternoon.
F. A. Blanchard, a private in the
"Washington regiment, was going along the
road when he saw a coat and hat near the
water, and, on investigation, discovered
the body, which had a sack of stones tied
about the neck. The police were notified
and the body was removed to the Morgue
by Deputy Coroner Hallett.
Grover was a carpenter and had roomed
at the residence of A. W. Dunn, 1222
Valencia street. For the past twelve
years he has been engaged to Annie
Smlthurst, a sister of Mrs. Dunn, and the
two were to have been married within a
week. He recently purchased a lot on
Bartlett street, and the erection of a
home was to have begun to-morrow.
Grover was well to do, having made con
siderable money In the cider business In
which he was engaged until recently.
Miss Smlthurst says Grover frequently
complained of neuralgia pains in his
head and it Is supposed that while suffer
ing he killed himself. It is said that he
made a previous attempt on his life by
turning on the gas In his room Friday
night. In a note book found in his pocket
was penciled the following message to
Miss Smithurst: "Good-by, Annie, with
best wishes and love."

POLICEMAN KENVILLE A PRISONER.
HIS VICTIM'S DEATH HOURLY EXPECTED
LITTLE Willie Lynch, the victim of
Policeman Kenville's club, still lies
on the cot at the Receiving Hos
pital, hovering between life and
death, while a saddened mother
bends over him and watches as
only a mother can watch for some
encouraging sign, although she has been
told time and again that the case is hine
less, and her boy will probably pas.s from
this world without ever giving one look
of recognition to a mother who seems al
ready to have had more than her share
of trouble.
The little fellow's hÂ«ad is swathed in
bandages and he seems haply to bo ob
livious to pain, although occasionally a
low moan will escape trom his lips; oc
casionally the eyes will open foe a lew
moments', but their glassy atare is like
those of a corpseâ they s.>e nothing nnd
cannot even carry the impression or the
anxious mother's loving face back to tne
poor injured brain.
The story of the little fellow s life is as
NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
CAPTAIN DUMBRELL TELLS OF
COMPANY C AT MALATE.
Complications Likely to Arise Out of
the Movement to Form a New-
First Regiment Infantry.
The recent order of the commander in
chief to reorganize the First Regiment
of Infantry of the National Guard is be
ing carried out. It is under the provisions
of section 1951 of the Political Code, which
provides that "whenever a sufficient num
ber of persons resident of any county of
this State, subject to military duty, sub
scribe a call for the organization of a
company, the adjutant general, upon the
application of such persons, and with the
approval of the general of brigade, must
present the same to the board for the or
ganization of the National Guard." Quite
' a number of individuals who wish to be
come guardsmen have signed petitions,
and among the number are men who are
of the four hundred of the regiment who
were not accepted in the volunteer serv
i ice.
This presents a state of affairs that
never before has existed In this or any
! other State of the Union. Military men
! who have given the subject much thought
I say that the four hundred men who re
i mained in this city by reason of not be
i ing accepted are still the First regiment,
and that in each company there is a non
commissioned officer who, in the ab
sence of ranking officers, is in command,
and that in two companies there are still
commissioned officers, namely, one lieu
tenant in each. These men, they say,
have never by any order been discharged
from the service of the State, conse
quently they are still members of the
First Regiment. They hold that the men
of the four hundred who have signed pe
titions must, if acer-ted, go in as entirely
new members, and that they will lose
the credit of service in the past and will
not be able to apply for a seven-year ex
emption certificate until they sh'kll have
served full seven years unaer the new
organization Quite a number of these
have already served several years, and
if they are accepted their service will
go for naught. Then they say that an
other matter will arise, and that is. What
will be done with those of the four nun
dred who will not affix their names to the
petitions? If under the petitions the
twelve companies of the regiment are
sworn in, what will be done with those
who already are In the ree'-nent? It is
claimed that they cannot be forced to
sign the petitions and cannot be mustered
out unless they come under one of the
several reasons for winch a guardsman
can be mustered out or discharged from
the service of the State. At present it
looks as if there will arise many compli
cations which it will be difficult to ad
just. The mode of procedure that has
been adopted for the First is being fol
! lowed for the Fifth Regiment of Infan-
I try It is probable that some legislative
action will have to be taken to straighten
out the prospective tangle
Major Jansen has been ordered to pre
side at an election to be held October 5
for a second lieutenant of Troop A, vice
Penniman, resigned.
Colonel T. M. Cluff, adjutant on the
division staff, has applied for leave of ab
sence for thirty days to enable him to
visit the East. , t
The biennial report of the adjutant
general of the State is in course fo prep
aration.
Captain L. H. Turner, having received
his discharge from the auxiliary navy,
has been ordered to resume his former
position as the head of the naval militia.
It is probable that in the near future
there will be a number of changes in the
militia with a view to a betterment.
The Signal Corps of the Second Brig
ade. Captain Hewes commanding, was. it
appears from the records, during the un
pleasantness with Spain, treated very
much as was the Seventh California "Vol
unteers. In addition to the five from that
corps who were accepted there were a
number who would have gone to the
front, but through some Influence, which
Is suspected but not positively known,
they were turned down and told that
there was no further need for signal men,
while at the same time men who were
without any experience were being
taken Into the ranks. Then they ex.
pressed a desire to enlist in other
branches of the service, and when that
fact became known the Information was
imparted to them that they had better
wait a while, as another corps was to be
touching as his present pitiful condition.
He attended the Sacred Heart College at
Eddy and Larkin streets, and every
afternoon could be found at Market and
Powell streets with a bundle of papers.
At 6 o'clock his sister, two years his
junior, would bring him some supper and
the two would eat together in a comfort
able doorway with one eye on the lookout
for a possible customer. About a month
ago one of the familyâ a little girl 5 years
of ageâ died, and only a few short hours
before the fatal blow had been struck
Willie and the surviving sister were plan
ning to take a few nickels from the next
day's sales to buy flowers for the baby s
graveâ but that next day found Willie on
his own deathbed.
The striking down of this innocent child
is an object lesson in police matters, but
when the head of the force is a man who
is known to fly into a violent passion on
the slightest provocation it does not seem
surnrisintc that the hoodlums enrolled on
the' force should follow his illustrious ex
ample. If the members of the force were
trained in the duties of a policeman in
stead of taught to beat drums and strut
on dress parade innocent and law abiding
citizens would be properly protected in
stead of being clubbed into insensibility
or roughly iostled from side to side by
burly patrolmen whenever it becomes
necessary to hold a crowd in check.
Although Kenville makes a flat denial,
popular SL-ntlment cries loud against him,
and according to the testimony of eye
witnesses he is directly responsible for
the sad occurrence of Friday evening,
but is there nothing back of it? What are
police regulations regarding the use of a
club, and is every officer as fully drilled
in these as he is in drummir", doing poli
tics or paying deference to the senile
head of the department?
The actions of the ijlue-coated minions
of Lees at the tight wete not such as
would stamp them as genttemen. Their
many ruffianly acts would not be tolerated
in any other" city on the gW.be, and the
stars "they hid behind probably saved
many of them from getting the treatment
they so richly deserved.
Iri the pavilion Sergeant Conboy seemed
Bent on, and that all who wanted to go
would then be taken. For a long time
it was a promise held out one day to be â .
i broken the next, and then renewed to bÂ« j
! broken again until the cessation of hos- ,
1 tilities. Since then the men of the corps
have become resigned to the Inevitable,
, and have made a fresh start as national
guardsmen. They have discovered from
! the experience of the recent war that
the chief requirements in the signal corps
1 are wigwag work or flag signaling and
, telegraphy. That the men of the corps,
which had been recruited to forty-three,
within two of the full strength, may be
come familiar with telegraphy, instru
ments have been placed in the armory
on Ellis street, and a course of instruc
tion in telegraphing, line building and j
i repairing will in the future be part of the i
! duties the men will have to become pro- |
ficient in. Signal wcfrk with flags will be i
' extended. A new map of the city for
! signal work has been prepared, and this
shows twenty-five points that have been
selected as stations, and it is the purpose |
: of the captain to have frequent drills ]
i with a sufficient number of men to form
! a cordon around the city. From the I
i several heights selected men will be j
'â â  able to wigwag from Fort Point to the
i Presidio Heights, from there to Sutro
1 Heights to Twin Peaks, to South San
i Francisco, to the Potrero, to the top of
' the ferry tower to the top of the Claus j
1 Spreckels building, to the top of Clay- j
street hill, and in that way to teach the
men the art of short and long distance
work.
The corps returned a few days since
from a sojourn in Mill Valley. T\ hlle
there the men had exercise in signaling \
by flag and heliograph, and had target
practice with carbines at 200 yards, firing
by squads and as individuals. I
"Captain James W. Dumbrell, command
ing Company C, First Regiment of Cali
fornia Volunteers, one of the companies
of the Nationals of the Ellis-street ar
mory. In a letter to Captain J. N. Pike
(retired) of this city, gives a very inter
esting account of the fight before Malate,
and of the part the First California took
! in it. From a military standpoint, it is
most interesting, as it gives with ex
actitude the precise position occupied by
each company during the several en
gagements the men had with the soldiers
from Spain. In his letter he writes:
At 12-4". p m., August 1, Company C (Dum
brell) was ordered to relieve Company F (Mil
ler). I stationed nine men on the right of
Company K. (Cunningham) and then took po
sition with the balance of my command about
twenty-five yards in the rear of our line and be
hind tin irrigating ditch, which had trees grow
ing upon Its bank. This offered a natural en
trenchment. The men had to lie in the water.
Then the enemy was quiet, save the sharp
shooters*, who were working toward our line,
taking advantage of a grrove of trees on our
right. This gave us the impression that tne
enemy were moving forward in numbers so as
to get a crossfire on our right flank. I posted
eight men In the grove with orders to chork
the advance and then fall back to our line.
Just before daybreak August 2 the enemy
drove In our pickets and opened fire. Company
â¢C returned the fire with platoon volleys and
now and then It was fire at will. The ene
my replied with shell and it was a hot fight
for thirty minutes. It was C's flelit from start
to finish No other command had a hand in it.
Every one did his full dutyâit was a "na
tional" affair.
Whenever the First Regiment has been
called on it has responded with a will
and performed its duties satisfactorily to
the powers that be.
Emmett Jones, who enlisted from the
signal corps of this city in the volunteer
signal corps and went to Manila, has
been promoted from corporal to sergeant,
and William J. Stock, enlisted from the
same corps with Sergeant Jones, was
promoted corporal.
BANQUET OF JOURNEYMEN.
A Lot of Jolly Tailors Gather at
Pabst's for Their Annual Jinks.
One hundred and fifty jolly fellows of
the Journeymen Tailors' Protective and
Benevolent Association came together for
a banquet last evening in the banquet
hall of the Pabst Cafe.
For a month past a committee com
posed of Otto Johnson, F. A. Smith, Ed
ward Hoelquist, W. McDonald, W. B.
Banfleld, I. Jansen and F. B. Nesbitt, has
done nothing much but arrange for this
great event.
The decoration of the tables, the mottoes
round the hall, the light effects, the din
ner itself; all were in accord with the
spirit of goodfellowshlp that dominated
the evening.
When the light wines of the late even
ing came on it transpired that Toasmas
ter Nesbit had a little surprise up his
sleeve in the way of a well-selected pro
gramme. It happens that every other
member of the Union is an exceptional
singer, and, thanks to Mr. Nesbit, there
was no limit to the melody, or to the
omnipresent, and like his subordinates hÂ»
could not stoop to ask a citizen to step
aside. Clubs were freely used by officers
to force a passage for their own import
ant personages or personal friends, and
hundreds of people will have sore ribs for
weeks in consequence. Frank Foster had
his face badly gouged by one of these
ruffians and narrowly escaped losing an
eve; Frank Purcell received a jab in UÂ»e
ribs he will remember, Bob McArthur wa3
badly hustled around, and a brother or
"Kid" McFadden, who essayed to get to
a dressing room, was kicked clear down
an aisle. These are a few samples.
As for Kenviile, he is now under arrest,
and the law may deal justly with him.
He has not been on the force long and
his reputation is not of the best.
He came from a ranch near JiiC
cles station, about half way be
tween San Jose and Santa Cruz, along
the line of the narrow gauge railroad. He
was of a quarrelsome, overbearing dispo
sition while at home, and he frequently
figured in brawls.
He joined the force on December Z,
]595 and a little over three months later
he got himself into trouble. He arrested
a son of Thomas O'Day, Fifteenth and
Belcher streets, for disturbing the peace,
and while doing so struck him in the
fnce and told him to "get out of here.
The boy's father brought him before the
Police Commissioners and he was fined
$50 for unofficerlike conduct.
Less than six months afterward he was
again in trouble. In the early morning
of Novenmber 2 C. H. Kobick- a carrier
foT a morning paper, who lives at .Â«4
Guerrero street, was shoving his small
push-cart along, when he was accosted
by Kenvllle at Fifteenth street, who
struck him in the face with his club, re
marking: "I've been looking for your
kind of people for some time. Kobicke
asked him for an explanation, and Ken
ville told him that tie believed he was
stealing and carting away tools Ken
vllle put the handcuffs on Kobicke, not
withstanding his protestations, a 1 ae
c .mpanied him in thr- pitrol wagon to
the Seventeenth street station,. ihere
Kobieke was recognized by the late
Lieutenant Burke and promptly released,
Burke apologizing to Kobicke, saying that
Kenville was a new man ana not very
bright, and such mistakes were liable to
happen with a man of his stamp. Ko
bicke preferred charges against Kenville
before the Police Commissioners, but
later wrote a letter to them, withdraw
ing the charges, as Kenville was a man
of family and he did not want to injure
him.
wit of the toasts, that rounded out the
evening's pleasure. It was later than one
o'clock In the morning before the tables
were left alone In their depletion and
the annual banquet was at an end.
HER HUSBAND MISSING.
Mrs. H. D. Hundt Thinks He Was
Led Astray by "Women.
Mrs. H. J. Hundt, living at 242 Sixth
street, Is greatly worried over the disap
pearance of her husband, a saloon-keeper
at 238 Sixth street. In one breath she
says she fears foul play and in the next
attributes Mr. Hundt's absence to his in
timacy with two women who used to fre
quent the saloon.
"My husband left home on the 26th of
last month," said Mrs. Hundt. "He had
with him a large sum of money v.'ith
which he was going to pay a liquor bill.
When he did not come home that night
I telephoned to the wholesale liquor
house and found that he had not been
there. I thought at first that he had
merely gone out on a spree, but his con
tinued absence leads me to believe that
something has happened to him.
"I have thought that perhaps he might
have been drugged and robbed, but have
about come to the conclusion that he
fell in with bad company and spent his
money and now fears to return home.
Two married women have been frequent
visitors to his place of business and
from what I have heard since his disap
pearance I have come to the conclusion
that they know something of his where
abouts. lam not of a jealous disposition
and did not think anything of their visits
lo the saloon, until within the last few
days friends have told me that their ac
tions were not above reproach."
The missing saloon -kr-eper is 52 years
old and weighs about 200 pounds. Besides
his wife he lfft a bright 2-year-old little
girl, who misses him greatly. Mrs Hundt
says if her husband will return all will
be forgiven.
THEY WANT TO GO.
The Tennessee Boys No Longer
Desire to Be Mustered Out.
The enlisted men of the First Tennessee
Regiment are glad that they are going ro
Manila. Before the order arrived for
them to he sent, about 10 per cent of the
men wanted to be mustered out, but the
last few days have seen a decided change
in the wishes of even this minority. The
dispatches sent to the Tennessee papers
by the correspondents in the regiment
previous to the order to go to Manila
were of a very different tone from what
they are sending now.
Altered the Sale Checks.
Robert Kirkman, a clerk in Hale Bros.'
store was arrested last night by Detec
tives Ryan and ODea on three charges
of misdemeanor and embezzlement. He
was caught in the act of altering the
faces of three checks. The first for $22
he reduced to $2, turning the $2 into the
cashier and pocketing the $20: the second
was changed from 75 cents to 10 cents,
and the third from Sf> cents to 15 cents.
James Kelly His Name.
The old man who was run over by an
electric car at Folsom and Beale streets
last Friday morning has been identified
as James Kelly, an inmate of John Cur
tain's boarding-house, 334 Main street.
He was 50 years of age and a native of
Ireland The deceased was out of work,
and was drowning his ill fortune In drink

ARRELLANES HAS TROUBLES
BORCHERS WAS HIT OPPOR
TUNELY YESTERDAY.
The Game Was Quite Interesting at
Times, the Gilt Edges Play
ing Too Steady for Their
Opponents.
By Joe Copbctt.
In anticipation of a much-heralded
game of ball quite a large sized crowd
wended its way into Recreation Park yes
terday at'^rnoon and saw the cle%er Sand
Crabs faff down before the shoots of
Harvey and the playing of the entire
Gilt Edges, the score at the expiration of
the contest being 8 to 5.
Not since the opening of the season has
such a peculiar game been played, it be
ing at times provoking and interesting.
For five long drawn out innings not a
murmur escaped the lips o. those pres
ent, and I attribute this rather unusual
occurrence to the fact that the attend
ance was strictly for Santa Cruz, and as
this crack organization wa- meeting with
reverses at the hands of a better team,
naturally admirers were reticont.
This, mind you, was only for the flrst
five innings. After that uneveniiul stage
had been passed Mr. Harvey's shoots
were driven in all directions, and in rec
ognition of what was being done to this
talkative individual, the assemblage cut
loose, as it were, and simply tore things
and each other almost to pieces. Never
did a crowd root more faithfully for a
team, and it is "really a shame," as one
female remarked, that the "Sand Crabs"
could not win out.
In the third and eighth innings they
made noble efforts, scoring t .o and three
runs respectively, but it was. no use, for
where three or four players would make
a glorious start those following would
prove ineffective, and in consequence
rallies which started well ended inglori
ously.
1 had supposed that the game would be
very close, and undoubtedly a pitcher's
battle, and in this 1 was seriously mis
taken, for both pitchers were hit often,
Harvey keeping most of his scattered,
and Borchers being hit rather oppor
tunely.
He, however, did very well, considering
that his second baseman mr. c four rank
errors, one of which let in two runs.
Arrellanes had a very bad day of it for
sure. Outside of his four mishaps he
went to bat on three different occasions
I with men on bases, yet failed. I am in
) clined to conjecture that he had better
practice up, as he appeared to be very
unsafe at all times, and such work as
his easily demoralizes a team that is
striving nobly for fresh honors. The
j "Sand Crabs" all through did not play
' the game they have on former occasions,
and there was also lacking that dash so
conspicuous and so much admired.
When their rallies began they were all
over the place, yet up to the sixth inning
they were as lifeless as the Friscos.
They were, however, outplayed. The
leaders made but one error; were very
fortunate in bunching their hits, when]
hits meant runs, and were as steady aa I
could be, with the exception of Harvey,
who is a real mark when the fates go j
back on him. Had it not been for Reilly's |
thoughtfulness in stopping the game dur- !
ing those innings when the "Sand Crabs"
were hitting everything pitched up, good
ness knows when the cannonading would
have subsided. Harvey cannot stand be
ing batted safely any number of times in
succession, and from Reilly's interference
during such times one might easily con
ceive that the Gilt Edges know this.
It is a good play to make, for many a
pitcher gets going, under heavy fire, and
relaxation, in any form, always enables
him to collect himself, so to say, and be
gin anew.
This Harvey did yesterday. If he were
allowed to continue when things were go
ing against him, I have no doubt but
what the Sand Crabs would have piled
Up more runs. It pays to know a pitcher. â 
Harvey, with it all, pitched good enough j
to win, and what more is to be expected? j
Up to the sixth inning not a run was I
made off him. and all told he struck out !
ten men. which is a great record these j
days. The game was a great affair after !
the sixth inning. Batting rallies were ;
frequent on both sides, but better play
ing and opportune hitting won the day <
for the leaders.

1 Some Good Sport and a Fine Array
of Blood.
Some good blood made its anpearanca
at the Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday,
and the finish or the forty courses, which,
will commence to-day at 12 o'clock, prom
ises to afford rare sport.
It was apparent irom the first that the
favorites would carry off tne honors. The
Bhort-enders had to trust to luck and pull
even, it they could, on four courses, in
which Monitor, Swinaerton, Alica
and Golden Russet were behind at the
betting ring, but took the purse.
In tne last course, between Magdailah
and The Gossoon, the bets were declared
oft" by the management, who suspected
jobbery on the part of The Gossoon's
keepers. When the dog came on the track
it was noticed that she had been fed. Tha
boy in charge at first denied that such
was the case, but at length admitted that
the dog had got at a box of food which
was intended for its evening meal.

band.
Mrs. Amanda Marceau-Fennell has de
cided to make another attempt to free
herself from the marital tie which binds
her to her latest acquisition in the line
of husbands. To-morrow morning,
MARRIAGE BONDS ARE
GETTING IRKSOME
, MRS. GERALD M. FENNELL, Once Mrs. Marceau, Is
Going to Try Again for a Divorce.
througrh the Messrs. Dunne & McPike.
lipr attorneys, sh>- will institute proceed
ings in the Superior Court of this city
for a divorce from Gerald M. Fennell, al
leging desertion as the reason why her
prayrr should be granted. What tinges
the present application with a color of
sentiment and romance, and therefore in
terest beyond the fact that Mrs. Fennell
!k the central figure, is the announce- |
merit that she has recently received a
mest advantageous offer of marriage.
It is not at all startling that Mrs. F*Â»n- :
r.( 1! i-hould receive an advantageous mat
rirr.nr.iai offer. On the contrary. But that
. hould seriously contemplate its ac- :
y another of those piquant
ties which the lady fair furnishej> j
at frequent Intervals from an apparently i
inexhaustible fund.
Notwithstanding that the shadows of i
UUtapplness and discord nave intruded
themselves Into two of the three ventures
on the part of the plaintiff to be, it isÂ»
Well known among her intimates thai !
she has an abiding faith in the entrancing i
Joys of wedded existence, even though at
times its course be seamy and bestrewn
With obstacles.
Probably then, her friends suggest, the
alluring visions conjured up at the pros
pect of a fourth alliance have had the
effect of stimulating her to again brave i
the unpleasant publicity of the courts In
seeking to render herself eligible in the |
eyes of the law. A little mure than a i
year ago Mrs. Fennell brought an action |
In the Fresno County court against Mr.
Fennell, charging him with adultery, but j
Judge Conley refused to grant her a de
cree on the ground, as he expressed it
from the bench, that there was collu
sion between the parties.
Judgp ("onley's conclusion was evidently
baseil on the natural assumption that lit iâ
ffantj in an action of such a character
BhAld not be on intimate, if not actually
affectionate terms. The fact is that Ger- j
aid Fennell never permitted his wife-who- ,
wouM -be-free a moment's peace while |
the causa was pending. If she drove to j
the courthouse or to her attorney's office
: stood at the curb to assist her to
â¢â¢light; it phe chanced to attend a lee
s' tur. or a play at the Barton Opera House
her spouse invariably occupied the chair
next to her. and on more than one occa
sion they were observed driving together
in the public highway, laughing and chat
ting with the utmost unconcern.
All these Incidents were undoubtedly
brought to Judge Conley*Â» attention, and
the result wns that Fennell left Amer
ica for London, his old home, and Mrs.
Fennell returned to this city, where she
has since resided almost without inter
ruption. But the hateful fetters of the.
marriage contract still bound the couple
together, alt hough a continent and an
ocean separated them.
Just at this juncture a member of one
of the great* st families of Italy, whom
Mrs. Fennell had met in Yokohama sev
eral years ago. where he played the gal
lant in his country's diplomatic service,
happened to write to her. The. letter was
scarcely more than formal, yet a response
to It brought others less so. and about a
fortnight ago there came a tender missive
through the plebeian medium of the mail
laying at his fair correspondent's feet
his hand, hin heart, his fortune and a
title. And Mrs. Fennell has accepted, and
that is all there is to the story except
the name of the fortunate suitor.
Vittore Ferdinando del Cellini, Rarone
di Miiano, who has wooed and won the
dashing Mrs. Fennellâ always remember
ing, <>f course, the impediment which
clever counsel are expected to remove â
is an Italian nobleman who boasts de
scent from the ancient house founded by
that bizarre genius, versatile craftsman,
courtier and exponent of the later Italian
Renaissance, the redoubtable and pictu
resque Benvenuto Cellini. He is a re
tired officer of the Italian army, a scholar
and a diplomat of experience, although |
he has not yet attained his fortieth year.
Mrs. Fennell declares him to be the hand-
A mest man she has ever beheld.
FT am not at all afraid of another mar.
1 riajre," said Mrs. Fennell last night,
"simply because some of the others have
proyed to be failures. I snould make but
a poor advocate of single blessedness. Th%
dreadful tragedy of my early married
lifo quite unfitted me to know my own
heart for a long time. afterward. Indeed.
I have never recovered from it. And
then, In the second experience, there were
personal differnces, most of them un
avoidable as well as unfortunate which
eventually brought about a separation.
"Of Mr. Fennell I have nothing to say,
save that he didn't understand me. Men
seldom comprehend women anyway and
that was Gerald's worst fault. I knew
him many years before' I married him
and then lost sight of him completely un
til two years ago. We only lived to
gether two weeks, you know, and I found
it absolutely necessary* tÂ©> visit the Pa
cific Coast. He demurred,' but I had my
way and left him in -New; York. \
"After he joined me here we found that
our mutual happiness demanded a separ
ation, but he Would not assent to it.
Then I learned of his [Infidelity and en
deavored to free ? mysalf from him " in
Fresno. But the stony-hearted Judge
there insisted that we had arranged the
proceedings beforehand, and refused me
a decree. Within a lew days Mr. Fen
nell disappeared, and I ascertained later
on that he had gone to London. . Since
then I have not. had a word from him,
and I have no idea where he Is or whether
he is living or dead. â  .
"I expect Barone Vittore in San Fran
cisco within a few months, and if I am
free then, as I expect to' be. we shall be
married at once. After that my plans
are uncertain, but I shall probably spend
the winter in Italy." With this Mr 3.
Fennell begged to he excused, and the
brief interview came to an end.
Mrs. Fennell, who may be known later
on as the Baroness Cellini, was first mar
ried to John D. Fiske about twelve years
ago. He was shot and Killed by F. C.
StiUman. and the latter is now serving a
life sentence in San Quentln-as a result
of the crime. She was left a large es
tate by Fiske. Then she married Colonel
Theodore Marceau, the well-known pho
tographer, and her marriage to Gerald
Fonnell succeeded her divorce from Col
onel Marceau by only two days.

NATIVE SO^fc' CELEBRATION.
Unofficial Figures Show That as a
Uesult of the Celebration They
Will Net a Neat Sum.
The joint 9th of September celebration !
committee of the Native Sons of tho
Qolden West held a meeting last night
for the purpose of winding up the affairs
I of the recent celebration, but such a re
j suit could not be accomplished by reason
' of the fact that four of the parlors had
not made a settlement with the treas- i
urer.
At the previous meeting the committee '
passed a vote of thanks to T. R. Judah
of the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany for the businesslike manner in
which he had arranged for the transpor
tation of excursionists on the 9th; also a
vote of thanks to P. J. Kelly, one of the
company's ticket agents, for courtesies
shown. These gentlemen acknowledged
by letter the appreciation of the commit
tee.
An unofficial statement made, based !
upon the returns of tickets taken up by
the railroad company, showed that the
excursion had been a financial success
and that after the payment of all ex
penses there will be a dividend of about '
$100 to each of the twenty-eight parlors
represented In the committee.
It was also stated that with tickets at
less rates than in 1594 the receipts were
equal to those on the occasion of the preÂ«
vlous celebration in San Jose, showing
that the attendance was greater than on
that occasion.
The four delinquent parlors were al
lowed until oext Thursday to make final
settlement with the treasurer.
The committee agreed to stand the loss
of seven and one-half tickets which were I
lost In the disposition of them by ticket j
sellers and which the sellers had been !
compelled to account for.
Thf committee will have another meet- !
ing next Saturday night.

HIS HEART
WAS ON THE
RIGHT SIDE
The Midnight Suicide
Did Not Know.
SO HE FIRED FIVE SHOTS.
HE WAS CLEOPHAS GREGOIRE, A
DERANGED MECHANIC.
Scientific Solution of a Mystery
Which Puzzled the Police Sur
geons â An Anatomical
Freak.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Sept. 24.
The dead body found on the lawn in
front of the Tabor boarding house, 533
Hobart street, late last night, was this
morning identified as that of Cleophas
Grcgoire, a French-Canadian, aged 26
who until a few days ago had been
employed at the Remlllard Brick Com
pany's works at Pleaaanton.
Last night, after what was supposed to
have been a thorough examination of the
wounds on the left breast directly where
the heart is located in the ordinary anat- !
omy of man. Dr. M. M. Ennos gave it as
his opinion that the man had been mur
dered. He contended that no man could
fire five bullets through the heart, or
in such proximity a.s the wounds indi
cated, with suicidal intent.
The murder theory was, therefore, gen
erally accepted as the only correct solu
tion until this afternoon, when Dr. S. H.
Buteau had completed an autopsy.
The autopsy revealed a physical con
dition that will prove of interest to sci
ence, and particularly to the medical
world, and according to Dr. Buteau's
analysis of the case, totally removes the
last shred of the murder theory.
It was discovered that live bullets from
the 35-callber revolver found by the side
of the dead man last night had entered j
where any one of them would, in the !
ordinary anatomy, have pierced the heart,
or so close thereto that the wound in
flicted would have proved fatal.
But Gregoire's heart was on the right
Bide. He had miscalculated when he fired
the first four shots, and the last shot
alone toU' lad the heart, the lobe of
which ortan barely extended over the
center lint from the right side of the
body.
Dr. Buteau had carefully noted tTfts
course of each bullet. One entertd .or
pierced the fourth rib about one inch to
the right of the nipple; another pierced
the fourth intercostal space, one-half inch
to the right of the left nipple; two pierced
the fifth Intercostal space on a line with
the smne nipple; and one pierced the sixth
rib in line with the nipple at the lower :
border of the sixth rib. Two of these
bullets had pierced the lower lobe of the
lung and near Its inner margin, and one
of the other missiles just grazed the lower i
I border of the lung at Its inner margin,
! while two of them had pierced the dia
phragm and entered the stomach.
But when Dr. Buteau went to direct his
attention to the heart he hesitated a- mo
ment and exclaimed:
.Â»\!L, upn.-j my word, here is one of the
strangest cases . I have come across.
Either the man's heart is so small that I
cannot find It or it Is not there.''
The most delicate care was exercised
by the surgeon, and finally the heart of
ordinary size was located on the right
I side of the body, as stated above.
An examination of the heart showed
where but one bullet had touched It. The
apex of the organ, which extended slight
ly over the center line, had been grazed
by one bullet, but the missile had not en
tered the cavity.
It was Dr. Buteau's opinion that Gre
golre had been born that way, but that
the dead man had been wholly uncon
scious or ignorant of his heart's location
during his life, and that when he shot
himself he held the revolver where he
supposed the vital organ to be. None of
the wounds were considered necessarily
fatal except the one that grazed the lobe
of the heart.
The wounds, moreover, clearly showed
i powder burns, and two of tho bullets had
pierced the body and lodged in the back
: of the coat, which fact the surgeon and
; Coroner Baldwin believed demonstrates
that deceased laid himself upon the lawn,
utilizing both hands while settinr- the re
volver in place against his breast, and
fired until the fatal bullet did its deadly
! work.
From all accounts Cleophas Gregoiro,
the dead man, had not been of sound
mind for some time past. He had been
discharged nt the Kemillard Works In
Pleasanton a few days ago. and called at
! the company's office in this city last even
' ing. Philip Remillard had received the
following letter a day or so previous,
which Is self-explanatory:
PLEABANTON, Sept. 22. IR3B.
D<>ar Philip: I had to discharge Grpgolre, as
he io out of his head. He kept me awake all
night a couple of days. ,ign. I cannot trust
him any longer. I am afraid he will harm me.
He will rail at the office, as I gave him a
draft for $200.
I told him to go to Canada, and I wish you
would tell him the name. It may help him if
he Koes back.
Be careful, because you cannot tell what he
might do. He carries a revolver. Your friend,
ELZEAR.
Gregoire hnd come down from Fleas
anton with E. Rcmillard last evening,
and intended to go to his former home
in Canada. The brass railroad checks
found on him were for his baggage, which
he intended taking with him.
Mr. Remillard says that on the trip
down from Plensanton Gregoire acted
very queerly. On arriving in this city
he went to the company's office to draw
his pay. and thereafter wandered off. The
management did not honor the $200 draft
last night, but told Gregoire to call to
day.
It developed to-day that the first per
sons to discover the dead man were Rev.
F. B. Perkins and Miss Alice Monroe, the
former escorting the latter home. When
the body was inspected by Rev. Mr. Per
kins he found the vest of deceased open.
It was Rev. Mr. Perkins who notified th*
police.
The deceased had a second cousin here,
Alfred Gregoire, a teamster in the em
ploy of the Remlllards, who also identi
fied the remains.
At the Inquest to-night George
Boiler identified the revolver found
by the side of the deceased as
Gregolre's. Dr. Buteau's testimony
brought out no new facts. John P. Ge
linas. secretary for thr> Remlllards, testi
fied that When deceased enme into the
company's office last evening he had an
overcoat over his arm and that the $200
draft was In one of the pockets. How
ever. Gregoire's cousin. Alfred, cleared
away all doubts when he testified that
afterward the deceased called at his room
and at that time had no overcoat. The
jury returned a verdict of death caused
By five gunshot wounds, but failed to de
termine whether those were inflicted by
deceased or by some unknown person.
Husband Made No Contest.
OAKLAND. Sept. 24.â Jndge Hall to-day
granted a divorce to Mary L. Jones from
William S. Jones on the grounds of ex
treme cruelty and habitual intemperance.
The custody of three minor children is

Secret Trial for Bey. Mr. Briggs.
OAKLAND. Sept. 24.â The annual State
conference of the Methodist Church South
will be held here next Wednesday. More
than ordinary Interest is centered In this
session on account of the ecclesiastical
trial of Rev. R. J. Brlggs, formerly pas
tor of the Centenary M. E. Church, San
Francisco, which will be a secret one.
Lost in Icy Waters.
OAKLAND. Sept. 24.â Mrs. L. A. Ken
nedy of 829 TVenty-second street, has re
ceived word from Messrs. Synon & Stein
beck, Fort Kenal, Cook's Inlet. Alaska,
to the effect that all efforts to recover the
body of her son. James D. Kennedy, who
met death in the- waters of the Keriai
River recently, have proved futile. Ken
nedy was one of the young men from this
city forming the prospecting party that
sailed from San Francisco on the schoon
er Rattler April IS last for Cook's Inlet.
For a number of years Kennedy was a
member of Company F. N. G. C, of this
city, and had a host of friends.
A HEROIC RESCUE.
How Arthur Downey and Frank
Mofi&tt Were Saved by William
Scott in the Estuary.
OAKLAND, Sept. 24.â A dual act of
bravery and savior of life in the estuary,
which occurred a lew days ago, has just
leaked out, notwithstanding the modesty
of Arthur Downey and William Scott, the
two heroes. A lad named Frank MofÃtt,
residing at Central avenue and Webster
street, Alameda, and Arthur Downey of
this city, two boys, were fishing off Web
ster street bridge, when the lirst named
fell into the water. Downey jumped in to
rescue him and after several attempts he
succeeded in bringing Moffitt to the sur
face of the water. The latter, however,
apparently desperate, fought against
Downey's efforts to save him. Soon both
lads were so weakened that a watery
grave for both seemed inevitable. Fortu
nately for both, at this junctiure William
Scott came to their rescue. He jumped
in and seizing Downey by the hair, while
the latter was aJso in the grasp of Moffitt,
he pulled them to the pier, when other
assistance was available.
Soldiers' Appreciation.
OAKLAND, Sept. 24. -Major F. W. Dud
ley, surgeon of the Eighth California
Regiment, now at Vancouver Barracks,
has sent a letter to Mrs. John Lynch or
the Catholic Truth Society here, express
ing the thanks of the soldiers for the.
valuable aid rendered by the society to
the field hospital while the regiment was
at Camp Barrett. A similar letter of
thanks was also sent by Company X,
signed by every man in the company.
THE ALAMEDA TAX LEVY.
It Will Probably Be Fixed by the
Trustees at $1 05 on the $100.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 24.â The Board of j
City Trustees met last evening as a com
mittee of the whole to discuss the fixing
of the tax levy. The estimates were sub
mitted as already published, and it was j
found that they would require a levy of !
$1 17 in order to raise the .amounts asked !
by the various departments. The figures
of the actual expense of running the gov
ernment, it was found, could be reduced
to a point that would make the levy $1 05.
This would allow nothing for betterment
and would include only the actual cost of
each department's operations. The rate j
of $1 05 would make the total tax rate I
the same as last yearâ sl 25. The city
rate was $1 12, but the county and State
rate this year is 7 cents more than last,
making the total the same. It is reported |
that the trustees will attempt to reduce j
the rate to $1, but it is not apparent how i
this can be done without impairing the I
efficiency of some of the departments.
Considering the population and the many I
conveniences enjoyed, the cost of the city '
government is not large.
A Homing Pigeon Traced.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 24.â A homing pigeon
was recently killed near Fresno, bearing
on one of Its legs an aluminum band :
marked "R. 548." Harry Whitman, the I
well-known pigeon fancier of this city,
who has a record of the birds belonging j
to members of the California Homing
Pigeon Association, finds by reference to I
that record that the bird belonged to O.
F. Zahn of Los Angeles, and was prob
ably lost during the homing pigeon
matches held in Los Angeles about two j
weeks since.

ALAMEDA, Sept. 24.â The Political

of Mrs. E. A. Smith, 1725 Alameda avenue.
The Alameda Republican Club held i

moved to Tuolumne. County, where, like

a turn at mining, but not finding the
mother lode he returned to San Fran
cisco, where he became a resident. Dur

Through the efforts of Detectives Gib
son, Wren and Dinan two of the most
dangerous crooks that ever operated in
this city are locked up in the City Prison.
Their names are Carl , Rolf, alias ''Tug
Wilson," and James, alias "Kid" Vincent.
Rolf is wanted in Sacramento for shoot
ing a Japanese whom he and another
crook attempted to hold up.
The Japanese was returning from a hop
ranch where he had been employed, when
he was met by- Rolf and his companion.
They ordered him to throw up his hands,
and when he refused, one of them shot
him. Rolf's accomplice was captured a
short time after the shooting and was
charged with assault to murder and at
tempted robbery, He was convicted af
ter a short triai and sent to Folsom for
fourteen years.
Rolf left Sacramento and came to this
city.
Learning that he was stopping at a
lodging house on Bush street near Grant
avenue, Detectives Wren, Gibson and
Dinan went to the place and proceeded â 
to place him under arrest.
In a satchel the officers found a miscel
laneous assortment of skeleton keys,
pick locks and other burglar tools. â 
Vincent, who is known to the police as
a desperate crook, was placed under ar
rest and taken to the City Prison, where
his name was entered on the "small"
book. A short time afterward Rolf was
found on Grant avenue and was also
locked up in the City Prison. To-day he
will be taken to Sacramento to be tried
for shooting the Japanese.
Some years ago Rolf was arrested for
burglary and rent to the House of Cor
rection for one year. On December 2, :
ISM, he was convicted In Monterey Coun
ty of a similar offense and sentenced to
two years" imprisonment in San Quentin.
He was released only a short time ago '
and, going to Sacramento, committed the i
crime for which he is to be tried.

HiGH FOR A PAR"v
PROMOTERS OF THE UNION
SQUARE SCHEME MEET.
Willing to Give $80,000, but the
Property-Owners Want
" $300,000.
That the Union Park scheme is not go
ing through without a light was shown at
a meeting held in the basement of bt.
Mary's Church last evening.
President Shadbourne of the Union
Park Association reported for the execu
tive committee that from numerous peo
ple of wealth he had assurance that any
money that might be needed over and
above the $75,000 appropriation of the Su
pervisors would be forthcoming at the
proper time.
"1 am familiar," said Mr. Shadbourne,
"with that property and its values, and
as it stands to-day $90,000 is a top-notch
price for it. I want to invite the property
owners to co-operate with us and hand
me the abstracts of their titles so that
within thirty days we can begin con
demnation proceedings."
Father Otis said he had not much to
say, but that the property owners, or
some of them, would contest the con
demnation proceedings. This brought N.
A. McConaghy, a representative of a
large block of the property owners, to
his feet. It was his opinion that the prop
erty was worth $300,000 and upon this ba
sis he and his clients would gladly co- j
operate. His clients not only own the
property, but also claim title to St. Mary
and Quincy alleys, and it was stated
that these streets had been turned over
as fee to the attorneys who will make
the fight.
President Shadburne informed McCon
aghy that upon a reasonable price both
sides could agree, but that if $300,000 was
held out for it would he war to the knife.
And war is being made ready for.
After increasing the executive commit
tee from five to twelve members adjourn
ment was taken to the evening of Satur
day, October 8.

T. CARL SPELLING
TAKES AN APPEAL
SUPREME COURT GRANTS HOI
A WRIT OF MANDATE.
Fourth Congressional District Fight
to Be Decided in October â L.
H. Brown Must Answer.
T. Carl Spelling is bound to run for
Congress in the Fourth Congressional
District, against James H. Barry, if per
sistency and the courts will be of any
use to him. On Thursday certificate
of nomination by the so-called Fourth
Congressional District committee was
returned to him without being Hied by
Secretary of State L. H. Brown, who, it
may be added, recognized and hied the
certificate presented by BarrS'. Secretary
Brown's reasons for his decision were
that the body which nominated Spelling
for Congress was not and never had been
recognized by the Democratic National
Committee, the State Central committee,
nor even considered by the late Demo
cratic State convention.
Spelling does not propose to be turned
down in this or any other manner, and
yesterday he tiled in the Supreme Court
a petition fcr a writ of mandate to com
pel Secretary Brown to give the peti
tioner's name a place on the ticket, and
show cause why he aid this in the case
of Barry. In his petition Spelling recites
the positions that, h-j and Brown hold
in the community. That before Novem
ber, 1896, an organization known as "The
Democratic Party of the Fourth Con
gressional District" existed, and at the
election of that year it had more thn 3
per cent of the vote of that district, and
that no election having been held since,
the party in question is entitled to make
nomlnaticns. The calling of the conven
tion at which Spelling was nominated is
set forth in the petition, and the claim
is set up that the organization has ful
filled all the obligations to entitle it to
standing and recognition.
The reasons r>f Secretary of State
Brown for not filing the petitioner's cer
tificate of nomination are also given.
Spelling asks in conclusion for a speedy
hearing of his prayer, as there is no time
to lose. The Chief Justice issued a. writ
which was made returnable on October 3
at 2 p. m. before the court in bank.
POISONED IVY DID
NOT CAUSE DEATH
LOUIS GEISHEN SWALLOWED A
COLLAIUBUTTON.
Dr. Gallagher Found the Little Arti
cle Lodged in the Child's
Throat â A Pathetic Case.
Dr. Gallagher, the Coroner's autopsy
surgeon, discovered yesterday that Louis
Geishen, the two-year-old boy who died
suddenly at his parents* hom^s, 1336 Sac
ramento street last Wednesday, was not
poisoned by eating 1 an ivy leaf, but from
swallowing' a collar button.
As was told exclusively in The Call of
Thursday, the child had been playing in
the yard in the afternoon. His mother's
attention was drawn to him by cries and
moans. She ran out to her boy and found
him in convulsions. Thinking he had
swallowed a leaf from the ivy that
thickly grew on the back fence, she
rushed to a corner drug store with the
child in her arms. The druggist feared
to treat the little one, as its condition
was dangerous. He directed the frantic
mother to Dr. Gallwey, but he was not
at home. Other physicans were looked
for, but before one coud nbe found to at
tend the chiid he had grown unconscious
and soon after died.
The collar button was found lodged in
the boy's throat, with the small point
downward. This, in the autopsy physi
cian's opinion, caused the convulsions
and later death.

TOBIN WRITES
FROM MANILA
Tells How the First
Fight Was Won.
THE SPANIARDS OUTCLASSED
COMPELLED TO RETREAT UN
DER A HEAVY FISE.
Many of the California Boys Killed
and Wounded in the Desperate
Struggle for Vic
tory.
Thomas Tobin, desk sergeant at the
Southern station, has received an inter
esting letterfrom his brother, First Lieu
tenant Tobin of the California Volunteers
at Manila. In describing the battle of
Manila he writes:
We have been under fire twice, and while
matjy of our boys have bet-n killed and
â wounded I have thus far escaped the bullets
>>Â£ the enemy. The first fight bÂ»-gaii Sunday
niKht, July 31, and ended August 1 at 3:30
a. m. Despite the terrible cannonading of the
tnemy we held our own and finally planted our
flap in their soil. â¢ â¢ â¢
Provisions are getting very low. Chickens
are worth $3 apiece and eggs retail for $12 per
dozen.
In another letter Lieutenant Tobin
writes:
Hurrah! We have captured Manila, although
our losses were ten killed and thirty-seven
â¢wounded. We started on the morning of Au
gust 13 and our regiment took to the left on
the Bide nearest the bay. We arrived in posi
tion at 9 a. m. A short time afterward the
Olympla Bent the first shell into the Spanish
fort. The other vessels of the fleet pumped
shells Into the old fort and it was soon si
lenced. We oould see the awful destruction
that the shells worked from our position. The
steam launch Callao ran close into shore and
slaughtered a number of Spaniards In. their
trenches.
The ulaushter was awful. Some had their
heads blown off and their iimbn torn by shot
and e>.ell. The uninjured Spaniards retreated
under the heavy fire and made for the fort.
We followed them, and. entering the fort,
swung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze. The
enemy was concealed behind trees and also on
housetops, and as ws ran down the street they
poured a leaden hall into our midst. How we
managed to escape the bullets they pent after
us I ani at h. loss to explain. As it was we
only had two killed and nix wounded.
In the meantime the navy had stopped firing.
The California boyÂ«! covered themselves with
glory. The Astor Battery "trot it in the neck,"
so to speak. They went up the wrong road and
laid themselves open to the fire of the enemy.
Talk about bird shooting! The Spanish sharp
shooters were concealed in trees, and yhen we
got on to them we dropped them II lei* an ex
perienced hunter would a flock of g-eese. When
we got the range the enemy was piled up like
cord wood. At 20 minutes to 5 the city sur
rendered. The insurgents tried to loot the
houses, but our boys stopped them. We have
about 50 of them under arreat. After the city
surrendered I was sent back to camp with
thirty-three nen to take command, and here
I am yet. It has been raining steadily since
the fight commenced.
The boys are disarming the Spaniards and
natives and guarding the city. The forts did
not fire one shot at the fleet. The Spaniards
destroyed their large guns so that we could
not use them.
Tho flel'i and staff are ensconseed in the
Governor General's mansion, with its rich fur
nishings and superb location. I have been de
tailed to act as assistant superintendent of all
sanitation in Manila. Regards to the boya.
Yours sincerely, WILLIAM H. TOBIN.

The quality of the tennis was of the high
order, and the Interest in the games was
at all times intense.
George and Robert N. Whitney, the old
team which has won so many victories,
played together yesterday for the first
time in many months. Their team work
was not so good as it has been, but they
easily outclassed all the others entered.
The tournament was won by the Whit

Root and Walter Magee defeated Mc-
Gavin and Eckart, 6â2.
Then the Whitney brothers payed
Adams and Weihe, and as it was patent
that one of these two teams Would win
the townament, they determined to set
tle the result against the possibflity of a
tie and played two sets out of three. The
Whitneys won the flrst set with a score
of 6â3. The second was closely con
tested, but the result wits inevitable. The
Whitneys won, 6â4.6 â 4.

REPAYING OF
MARKET STBEET
TO BE STOPPED
If Ambrose's Advice
Is Followed.
LACK OF MONEY THE CAUSE
STBEET SUPERINTENDENT TO
ADDRESS SUPERVISORS.
... . â
Will Urge Cessation of Work Be
yond Sixth Street Until
Some Future
Time. â 
Market street, from Sixth to Valencia,
cannot be repaved with bitumen this
year. Such is the statment made to The
Call by Superintendent of Streets Am
brose. Speaking of the matter yesterday
he said:
"On Monday I shall send a communica
tion to the Supervisors, calling attention
to the fact that I will be unable to per
form all of the repair and repaying work
ordered up to date by the board and still
have enough money left in the depart
ment's funds to pave Market street be
yond Sixth. The Supervisors cut down
the street appropriation some $400,000
under the figure that I set in my esti
mate as necessary, and as a result no
improvements additional to those already
ordered can be made on the money tÂ«iat
will be available. I will go out of office
next January, and the full amount of the
department fuuds for the months up to
that time has been spoken for. I am
sorry that it is so, but there is apparently
no help for it. Improvements cannot be
made without money. I understand that
a petition was filed with the Supervisors
to-day by property owners on Market
street asking that the work of repaying
with bitumen be extended from Sixth
street to the City Hall, but I do not see
how this can be done. To the best of my
belief Market-street improvements will
have to stop."
The petition to which Mr. Ambrose re
fers was filed with the Supervisors' clerk
Saturday morning and is signed by the
majority of the abutting property owners.
In it the fact is stated that bitumen
might as well be put down in view of the
fact that rails of the streetcar company
have been torn up and the expense of re
pairing with cobbles would be consider
able with an ultimate unsatisfactory re
sult, inasmuch as the cobbles make an
inexcusable racket, while the bitumen re
duces noise to a happy minimum.
The declaration of Mr. Ambrose regara
ing the necessity for stopping the Market
street improvement will cause both sur
prise and regret, as it was the general im
pression that the Supervisors would
speedily order the street finished as far
as Valencia street. There had been some
talk of bituminizing certain adjoining and
connecting streets, so as to furnish an
unbroken bitumen pavement from Mar
ket street to Golden Gate Park.
Several other matters of importance
will be brought before the Supervisors to
morrow. The Committee on Buildings
and Grounds will recommend that a fur
ther extension of time to January 1, 1899,
be given to the contractors, Bateman
Brothers, in which to complete the Hall of
Justice. This job has been dragging
slowly along for some time, although re
cently a slight in' rease in activity has
been observed on the contractors' part.
The Supervisors have evidently t>een
fkepticaf about the early completion of
the structure, as it was a mooted question
when the tax levy was considered as to
whether any provision should be made
this year for money to furnish the place.
It was finally thought wise to appropriate
some fnnds for the furniTure, with the
understanding that the money could be
used for other purposes if not needed in
the Hall of Justice.
The Committee on Buildings and
Grounds will a.so report adversely upon
the petition of the Board of Health for a
change in the specifications and plans for
a receiving hospital at the Hall or Justice.
The board wants two floors for the hospi
tal, but the Supervisors' committee thinks
that one will be sufficient.
The Supervisors will be asked to pass
a resolution identical with, that of the
Chamber of Commerce, addressed to the
State Harbor Commissioners, asking them
ta assign blocks of State land bounded by
Davis, Pacific and East streets in this
city for the use of car tracks and sheds
required for a free public market. A com
munication to this end will be presented
by Edward F. Adams in behalf of the
producers' free market committee.

The most graceful aerial lady athletes
in the world, the Austins, at the Alham
bra, â¢GREATEST MEXICAN FIESTA OF THE YEAR
A BARE, brown plain, burned
to the consistency of bricks,
barren of vegetation, save for
the spreading oaks, which
strive, in spite of the terrible
drought, to keep life in them
selves. Their shrive!ed-up leaves drop
from the branches, but they are still
green and contrast pleasantly with the
parched ground, where not a blade of
grass nor even a weed can grow.
Thero is no life on the ranch; the cat
tle have long since left for the high
ranges of the Santa Lucia Mountains,
where there is still some feed.
But the day is the 16th of Septem
ber. Though the date has no special
associations to citizens of the United
Staies, Us occurrence is sufficient to
draw a long: string of buggies and
horsemen along the dusty trail. They
come from Jolon, from all the ranches
and farms in the neighborhood, ev< n
from far-away Kings City. For this
is the eighty-eighth anniversary of the
declaration of Mexican independence,
and it has been left alone to Jolon, of
all towns in the United States, to keep
green the memory of this great na
tional event of Mexico.
By far the most interesting charac
teristic of the day is this visit to the
ruined San Antonio Mission. It has
ali the features of a sacred rite.
"Last year we had many more peo
ple here," said Father Ferrer, the par
ish priest, as he spread out the palms
of his hands with a gesture of dismay.
"This year, alas, the drought has
ruined their crops, they have no horses
and they cannot come."
Despite the father's words, there was
a goodly assemblage of people around
the ruined mission. There were ladies
in gay prints and summer frocks, store
keepers and ranchers in somber attire,
Indian women and children clad In
every color of the rainbow. Within
the chapel floor had been cleared of
debris, and the fallen roof timbers,
Siiwed into convenient lengths, made
improvised seats. Despite the bright
ness of the day, the eioudless sky of
deepest bluv overhead, the sunlight
which streamed through the broken
spaces in the roof, there was a patriotic
element about this forlorn service in a
ruined church. There, seated on
benches at one side, were the gaudily
clad Indians, the direct descendants of
those whom the mission fathers had
rescued from savagery and trained
with infinite patience to a life of civil
ized decency. On the other side were
tRÂ« better dressed whites, men and
women of European descent, who had
succeeded, by sheer force of arms, to
the domain which once belonged to the
squalid, poverty-stricken Indians. And
in between, a kind of stepping stone
in the march of empire, were those of
Mexican descent, whose forefathers
had displaced the Indians, only in turn
to be displaced themselves by the more
energetic Americans.
Yet to-day, being the 16th of Septem
ber the people, though of strongly dis
similar type, united in the worship in
order to celebrate an event, which, in
this land at least, has long since lost
all national significance. Though the
ostensible reason for the service was
the glorification of Mexican independ
ence, there was another and more
touching side. It was a direct testi
mony to the reverence in which the
memory of the mission fathers is still
held; it was an appeal to the gener
ous to do something toward restoring
and keeping in fair preservation the
marvelous handiwork of these pioneer
Christian laborers. To Father Ferrer,
indeed, an enthusiast in the cause,
this was the one and only feature of
the celebration. He plaintively ap
pealed to his audience for help in the
â work of restoration, and reminded his
hearers that all that had hitherto been
accomplished had been done by his
own hands. He told how he had
dragged away heavy timbers and
cleared up debris until, at last, the floor
of at least a portion of the sacred
structure had been rescued for use.
He had even living proof of the mis
sion fathers' work to show. Framed
in the doorless archway we looked out
upon the barren land which once was
the fair domain of the mission. Crops
and orchards and vineyards flourished
here, covering the well - Irrigated
ground with a carpet of verdure right
away to where the fringe of willows
which border the San Antonio Creek,
refresh the eye with living green. And
beyond, even to the Coast Range,
where the topmost peaks melt into
blue haze beneath the dazzling sun, the
fathers held sway, cutting their tim
ber and pasturing their cattle on these
mountain heights.
As we sit on the rude benches gazing
out upon the memories of the past,
The San Francisco Call.
there comes to our ears the sound of
rude barbaric music. The orchestra
enters, a pitiable band, which would
excite nothing but ridicule in the
streets of San Francisco. But here it
excites only sympathy; the ridicule is
merged into the pathetic. There are
four instrumentalists, and between
them they handle, with less than in
different success, two drums, a fiddle
and a flute. One must pass over the
weakness of their music to gaze upon
the personality of their leader. Tower
ing above his fellow-Indians, a majes
tic, white-bearded figure, the man
stands as one of the oldest living me
mentos of mission work. His age can
not be found with exactitude, but he
is at least 80. and his memory, still
good, carries him hack to the day when
the settlement teemed with Indians;
when the hum of cheerful industry
filled the air; when handicraftsmen of
every description plied their vocations
under the supervision of the fathers.
He was born on the mission, his par
ents were among the earliest rescued
from savagery by the priests. Yearly
he comes with his fellows to the cele
bration service, yearly he bangs the
drum with more ardor than skill, for
was he not once a member of the mis
sion orchestra, a humble but useful
WITH LOUD CRIES THEY CfIME LUSHING AND SPURRING THEIR HORSES DOWN THE STRETCH-
unit of the institution during its most
glorious epoch?
It was the prettiest, the quaintest re
ligious service I have ever witnessed.
There were no elaborate paraphernalia,
no golden vessels nor gorgeous vest
ments, such as usually illumine the
altar of a Roman Catholic church. For
a screen there was a trellis of green
willow boughs, shutting off the ruined
end of the chapel, for candles God's
glorious sunlight. Yet priests never
held a more impressive mass, never
was a religious function more simply
and devoutly performed. The sun
shone on the heads of the fathers and
lighted up the dusky faces of the little
orchestra; occasionally it stole through
the broken tiles and touched the de
vout countenance of some fair listener,
or struck a gleam of glancing color
from her bright summer frock. There
was a brief sermon, I suppose appro
priate to the occasion, because it was
a still briefer exhortation from Father
Ferrer in English, in which he uncon
sciously struck a note of humor. He
appealed to his audience not to cele
brate the 16th of September with a too
exuberant cordiality, advice which
many of them, I am afraid, sadly neg
lected later in the day.
Then came the crowning feature of
the ceremonial, when the Indian moth
ers brought their black-haired, beady
eyed infants to be christened. Of
course, the babies cried, but the rite
was none the less cheerfully performed.
Then we were treated to an Indian
wedding of a somewhat peculiar char
acter, and the priest had to appeal to
his congregation to take the service se
riously, and to - remember that ; they
: were in a consecrated building. The
bridegroom was -at X least sixty years
old, the bride a maid of fifteen sum
mers. I suppose I should have â  said
blushing, but her skin was so dark that
one could not detect the tell-tale flush.
An audacious American â  girl., pretty as
a picture, steals close up with her cam
era, determined, despite all, irreverently
to obtain a snap i shot. â¢ "I got them,"
she laughingly cried afterward, "just
when they-, were trying to, put the ring
on the wrong finger, and it wouldn't
fit. "Wasn't it funny."
The elderly bridegroom got very
drunk at the hotel that evening, but
all the other Indians did the same
thing.
The mission : priests of a century ago
were a practical, hard-working set of
men, and when one thinks of all they
accomplished with the primitive means
at their disposal, one marvels that
every trace of their handicraft should
have been allowed to disappear. All
around the mission inclosure you will
find the ruins of adobe buildings. These
piles of brown earth were once a long
row of. huts where the Mission Indians
riweU: hÂ»rÂ»> was the flour mil), turned
by a primitive waterwheel, here was
the storehouse, the blacksmith shop and
so on.
All these buildings are practically
leveled to the ground and in a few
years every trace of their existence will
have disappeared. On the slope of the
hills just below is a more melancholy
relic, the Mission graveyard. Here, in
a great square inclosure, lie the undls
tinguishable dead of a century â Indians
and half-breeds, Mexicans and Span
iards, sleeping, many of them, three
or four deep, for the fathers were not
particular about using the same grave
several times over. Being covered with
tiles the walls which surround the in
closure are still fairly intact, but within
all distinguishing marks have disap
peared and there is nothing to show
where the graves are.
Even the large wooden cross in the
center has fallen under the prevailing
influence of decay, and waves its hori
zontal arm wildly in the air, at an alto
gether irreverent angle.
This scene of ruin and desolation is
all that is left of the work begun by
Father Junipero Serra 127 years ago
and so ably completed by his success
ors in office. In point of age the San
Antonio mission ranks third. First
there was S"n Dif-go, then Monterey
and a year later San Antonio. Travel
ing painfully over the mountain ranges
with his mule trains. Father Junipero
gave war to a dramatic impulse when
he reached the FDOt. Taking the bells
from his mules' necks he hung them on
a tree and rung them violently with
his own hands, exclaiming. "Come, all
ye Gentiles, come and receive the faith
of Jesus Christ." By Gentiles he
meajit, of course, the Indians. Yet,
strangely enough, the good father was
not the first, by more than a century,
to speak words of hope in this heathen
land.
An aged Indian woman, numbering
over a hundred years, was present at
the ceremony and ready to astonish
the father with a reminiscence. Her
mother, she asserted, remembered two
white men who came to the country
years ago and who talked exactly as
the father had done. Probably these
were the priests sent north by Father
San Francisco in 1631.
The secular part of the celebration
held at Jolon presented many aspects
of a distinctly humorous character.
For the brief period of twenty-four
hours Jolon emerged from its custom
ary obscurity and became a center of
vast importance to the neighborhood.
Few people in San Francisco have
ever heard of Jolon. Yet Jolon,
though small, is lively and knows how
to surround a festival with all needful
accessories and trimmings. It is a
straggling little town of a few white
painted houses, picturesquely situated
under the shelter of the Coast Range.
Once It was a stopping place on the
stage line from King? City to Los An
geles but the advent of the railway has
changed all tl.at and few strangers
ever find their way along the dusty
high road. Jolon. however, has age to
justify its existence, as the magnificent
grape vine in front of one of the two
hotels testifies.
Traces of the San Antonio mission,
only _ix miles distant, are visible
everywhere at Jolon. The landlord, a
very old resident, possesses quite a
small museum of mission curios. There
are the huge wooden cart wheels cut
out of a solid piece of wood on which
the cumbersome, creaking ox wagons
of the pioneer days were mounted.
There are upper and nether millstones
rudely shaped from black volcanic ba
salt; there are wooden statues, now
sadly dilapidated; there are plows,
saws, queerly fashioned tools of every
description, copper vessels beaten out
by hand and a host of other articles of
primitive manufacture, all of which
were contrived by the Ingenious priests.
There are even some of the altar deco
rations and sacred vestments as well
as the cross which once stood over the
grave of the last ruler of the mission,
Father Ambris.
When this holy man died, in 1883, the
mission, already shorn of its lands and
fallen sadly into decay, soon went to
pieces altogether. The Indian residents
had dwindled to a mere handful, and
the Land Commission hud only left the
mission the ground it had actually im
proved, some thirty acres. Hencefor
ward the Roman Catholic Bishop
troubled no more about this precious
relic of early settlement, though
as earnest men are now ad
vocating the restoration of all the mis
sions, it is possible that something may
be done before it is too late â that is
to say, within the next two or three
years.
The old traditions, however, die hard.
Spanish is. spoken quite as frequently
as English; it is universal among the
many half-breeds and Indians to be
seen about the town. The celebration
of the 16th of September remains the
one great festival of the year, far over
shadowing in importance the Fourth of
July or Thanksgiving day or any of the
national holidays.
The people there, whether American
or Spanish, speak of keeping the 16th of
September as we would do of keeping
Christmas, and make their prepara
tions for a glorious jollification which
lasts from midnight on the 15th to sun
rise on the 17th.
It is always the same story. "If you
had only been here last year," every
one Bays. "'We had over a thousand
people in town. We never had such a
time," etc.
This year, owing to the failure of the
crops, the attendance was described as
small, but still there were quite enough
people to make things hum.
The proceedings, accordine to im
memorial usage, began at midnight
on Friday, when the Mexican flag was
ceremoniously hoisted. The loyalty of
the people to the republic was shown,
however, by the fact that the stars and
stripes floated above the red, white and
green banner. Indeed, though the
fiesta being kept was purely a Mexican
one, none of the revelers forgot that
the United States had first claim to
their citizenship.
"We all pull together," said a resi
dent â "Americans,- Mexicans, Span
iards and Indians â and though we keep
a Mexican celebration we don't forget
Uncle Sam."
This was the spirit of the thing, for
when the flags were hoisted and the
bonfire blazed merrily, cheers were
given indiscriminately for the United
States and Mexico, for anyhody and
everybody, of whatever nationality. As
nobody in the place possessed a can
non, a gentleman obligingly flred off
charges of giant powder in an adja
cent field, to the imminent danger of a
valuable bird dog. This intelligent ani
mal, hearing guns, a.s he deemed them,
being fired, immediately commenced to
retrieve imaginary game, and in the
course of his researches amid the giant
powder narrowly escaped departing
to the canine happy land.
Thus the 16th opened auspiciously,
and the crowd adjourned to the hotel to
continue the event. To the credit of
the Jolon citizens only the Indians got
very drunk, a circumstance which was
hardly surprising. It seemed to be a
point of honor on this occasion to put
ac much whisky as possible into each
Indian, partly from a pure spirit of
hospitality and partly to induce them
to dance or cut ludicrous antics.
The forenoon of the 16th was occu
pied with the religious ceremonial at
the Mission, but though it was a very
hot day the energy of the people was
by no means exhausted. They held a
barbecue in the afternoon in the bed
of a dry creek, where a fringe of cot
tonwood trees and willows gave some
slight protection from the blazing sun.
It was holiday making under the most
difficult circumstances. The stony creek
looked as if it had never known the
meaning of the word water, the under
brush was burned to a cinder, apd the
various picnic parties were hard-pushed
to find enough shade to cover . them
selves.
Still, there were many there, pretty
girls and comely matrons, sober farm
ers and eloquent politicians. The lat
ter gentlemen, aspirants for county of
fices, took advantage of the opportunity
to press their claims upon the voters,
and one could hardly walk a yard with
out having a . card thrust into one's
hands announcing that Mr. Surethiag
was a candidate for some lucrative
State position.
But, though much politics was "talked,
the spirits of the people remained- un
dampened and they adjourned to the
race course to conclude the afternoon's
sport. The race course was simply a
level stretch of dusty road, half a mile
long. The horses start from one end
and in due course arrive at the other:
that is all there is about it. There was
no public betting or any of the ordi
nary sporting accompaniments of the
race course. As the riding was of a
purely amateur character the contests
did not lack excitement, from a local
point of view, and the finish of each
race was welcomed with warm cheers
from the friends of the winner.
Toward the close of the afternoon the
revelers retired to prepare for the great
ball, which was to crown the festivities
of the day. Th tamale booths, cool and
refreshing with their covering of green
willow boughs, concocted an extra sup
ply of this favorite edible in readiness
for the night's demand. Every room in
the hotel was crowded with ladies pre
paring their ball dresses, a string of
buggies drove up with fresh arrivals..
Need I say that the ball was a brilMant
success? It was the one opportunity
of the year for many of these people
and they made the most of it.
"Strange," remarked an indignant
storekeeper, surveying the scene,
"though these small ranchers can never
find money enough to pay their store
bills they can always discover a few
dollars to spend at the ball."
Jolon kept it up until long after day
light. Then the visitors departed and
Jolon went to sleep for another year.

WHO SHALL BE ELECTED
President
OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY?
By seven pron)iQeQt college graduates.
THE . selection of a president for the University .
of California is a question which is greatly in
teresting our State at the present time, and is
incidentally interesting other States which
have "favorite sons" who aspire to the position.
The Eastern, candidates most . prominently men
tioned so far are: Professor Benjamin I. Wheeler,
professor of Greek at Cornell; Dr. Charles D. Wal
cott. United States geologist and acting manager of
*iie National Museum; Dr. Albert Shaw, editor of the
Review of Reviews; Dr. Edward James : of Chicago ;
University; Dr. John H. Ficley, president of ; Knox ''
College in Galesburg, 111.; Dr., William D. Hyde, presi- .
dent of Bowdoin, and Professor William James of
â¢ Harvard. . â¢.,../. â , : ., ..* .. ;.â 'â¢;
The prominent Pacific Coast candidates are Profes
sor. William Carey Jones and Professor Bernard Moses.
Some of our prominent San Francisco college men
have been asked to express an opinion in the premises
with the following result: â¢
-â¢â  * â¢
We need a man at the head of the University of
California who combines' learning and intellectual
- ability of the very highest
i order with a capacity for
understanding and man
aging the practical affairs
- of college life. ' ' l '
I would suggest that in choosing a man for the
occupancy of the most important position in the gift
of the regents one who is the fortunate possessor of
a pleasing personality, one who is a tactful man and
a man who is capable of expressing himself readily
and well on all topics of general interest as well as
upon those connected with the particular Interests of
the university should be selected.
It may seem Utopian to expect to find one person
who combines successfully so many excellent and
necessary qualities, but to my mind Stanford has been
able to accomplish just this. President David Starr
Jordan seems to me an ideal college, president, and
since Stanford was fortunate enough, to find him it
seems at least not impossible that Berkeley may find
some one worthy to enter into generous rivalry with
him.
â¢ â¢ * .
The selection of a president for our university is a
thing which should appeal to every thinking man in
the State, and it behooves
the regents to make a
most careful selection
among the many candi-
. dates who will undoubt
edly apply for so desirable a position.
One great trouble with Berkeley in the past has
been in my estimation, the many changes which have
been made in its presidency. The comparatively brief
term which has been the rule and the sense of inse
curity which the realization of that frequently re
curring election gives the incumbent naturally
militates against the even progress of the college.
The plans of one man, however wise and beneficial,
and the work which he has Instituted may be com
pletely changed by his successor. This is intended
as no reflection on the men who have been presidents
of the university in the pastâ they have all done their
best undoubtedly under the circumstances and in the
environment in which they found themselvesâ It
is merely a statement of fact. "Rotation in office"
is a very poor plan for an educational Institution;
the rule should be "Get a man thoroughly fit for the
place and let him alone as long as he is fit for it."
Permanency of position, under certain limitations,
would do much to advance the best interests of the
college and the students attending it.
I am inclined to think that the root of all the dif
ficulties and troubles which Berkeley has experienced
In the past has been the connection which politics
has had with its management. Politics should be en
tirely eliminated as far as the affairs of the university
are concerned, and "political methods" should not be
used in connection with appointments of any kind.
Fitness for the place should be the only qualification
required of regent, professor or president, and when
this is the rule and it is lived up to our university
will be far ahead of what it is at the present time.
The position of president of a successful university
requires more than the possession of intellectual quali
ties though those should be of the highest order.
Executive ability and. wisdom in the selection of. sub
ordinates are requisite. In my opinion : the success -
of President Jordan at Stanford has been largely due
to the fact that he possesses these latter qualities in
an unusual degree, and also to the fact that he has
been allowed such freedom in these and other respects.
The fettering of the president has militated against
the success of Berkeley in the past, and it is to be
hoped that the statement recently made that a change
is to be made in this regard in the future' is based
on fact. The new president should be broad-minded,
and should be a man of great, executive ability as
well as a scholar of eminence; k these qualities being
assured he should be given wide latitude of action
In regard to all university affairs. There is no reason
that Berkeley should be second to any institution of
learning in the country. It is a place of almost'un
.limited' possibilities, which can be made realities by
judcious management. Stanford has done Berkeley,
â¢almost Incalculable : good by arousing a spirit of
healthy rivalry and emulation and the future promises .

are the .requirements for such a position as ?Is the

among the leading promoters of the University of
Californiaâ those who were I most active |in its . estab
lishmentâwere many of our Harvard men, and Har
vard men have always taken an especial Interest in
Its welfare. For years the Harvard Club of this city,
of which I am a member, has donated; an annual
sum for the purpose of paying the: expenses of a
Berkeley graduate recommended by' the faculty while
pursuing a postgraduate course at. Harvard. I men
tion this merely to illustrate how deep and also prac

In my opinion the man who is selected for the po
sition of president should be broad-minded and many-

store of learning. Some changes might, perhaps, : be
made in the administrative system of the university
which would be to, the advantage of the institution as
well â  as ' to â  the faculty. I should recommend that
the new president be given more "â¢ latitude ; in many
â ways than has been allowed those who have served
in that capacity in the past.*.
The president of a college should be capable of
taking an intelligent; prominent and active part In
the management of the body over which he presides
or else he should not be allowed to occupy his position.
He should not be held responsible for : events over
which he has limited or no control, but he should be
given larger rights arid powers and then be held ac
countable for results.
Another thing;. false economy should have no placu

ucational institution as
is our university it would
be wise to secure some

Eastern universities, that

is that these two institu

a standard of education
to which all the smalller
colleges try to attain, or
which they endeavor to,
with greater or less suc

A man who has been
a successful mem

either of these universi

one a measure of
intellectual acquirement,
practical knowledge and
experience which could
scarcely fail to make his occupation of the presiden

I should also advocate the securing of a man of
not more than middle age, as such a person is more

personally to all matters connected with the different
branches of university work, and also more apt to be
liberal rather than conservative in his views and ad
ministration.
Having chosen this intellectually qualified, energetic
find liberal man, whoever he may be, he should be
given far more power than those who have been
presidents in the past have been allowed. He should
be made president of the Board of Regents as well
a? president of the university, as thus all differences
between the two bodies would be prevented, and,
moreover, a political Governor would thus be pre
vented from mingling politics with the management
of our great educational institution. Occupying this
dual position the president should have full respon
sibility and should be held responsible. With the
right man at the head the university would soon show
the beneficial effects of this change in the form of
management.

Off-hand, giving me no time for reflection, you nsk

president of the Univer

a large question to be
GORDON BLANDING,
YÂ»le.
!! â i â  propounded on short no
tice to a small man. I am not fit to answer it, have
not the time to answer it and do not want to answer
it, and if I attempt a reply it is only because of that
Inherent weakness which makes us all cowards when
we ought to say "No."
The university is presided over by an able Board
of Regents. The long list of its alumni contains the
names of many scholarly and accomplished men and
women. These are the persons who beÃt know the
special needs of Berkeley and whose ripe judgment
and experience should concur in the selection of a
fitting president. That they will do so cannot be
doubted. It is a great office and one not easy to
fill. Not all who will crave It will possess shoulders
broad enough to wear the mantle. If the maxim that
the office should seek the man not the man the oftico
ever had any significance it applies with peculiar force
here. "Pajmam qul meruit ferat." The saying is
trite and easy of utterance, but what a world of
leaning Is Implied In this particular "qul meruit."
He should have, and in the order named:
1 Character.
2. Executive ability.
3. A wide and scholarly learning.
He must be an unconscious ruler of men. He mus*
govern not by the severity of written rule or pre
scribed ordinance, but by the gracious reverence in
spired by a great moral personality. His sway must
be founded on the hearts not the fears of his dis
ciples. It must be built upon the immutable founda
tions of a great simplicity, a great sincerity an 4 in
finite truthfulness. And these must be not hidden
gems, but as the sun at noon-day, so that all men
may feel their radiant warmth and be kindled to
fresh ardor by their unsullied glow. His work wil
be chiefly with the undergraduates, and none are
swifter than these to detect any kind or degree of
sham. They that have passed beyond the college
walls are the finished clay. The fixed lines of the
academic mold are upon them. They that yet linger
â Aithir. are still the plastic earth upon which all forms
jf beauty and of truth may be wrought. The potter's
fir.pers that would fashion this yielding staff must
wcrk with a deftness born of long worship of the
deal. He must have been in sympathy with
the great questions, the great sufferings of the world.
The voices that whisper from the broken columns of
the Parthenon and the Colosseum, from the crumbling
arches of Benares, from the graven stones of the
Pharaohs and of Rameses, from every sod knee-worn
by the victim of Gethsemane, must all have held com
munion with his soul and have lifted him from
the infinitesimal of the ego to the infiniteness of the
beyond.
"And lingering for this.
My laurels lend the glory of their boughs
To crown no narrower brows.
For od his lips must wisdom sit with youth,
And in his eyes, and on the lids thereof,
The light of a great loveâ
And on his forehead, truth!"
In such a presence all men will instinctively bow
md do reverence. The young will come to him as to
a. great teacher, a cherished friend, and, long after
the shrines of Alma Mater shall know them no more
some portion of his light will shine, an unbidden
tiomage from their lives and their life's work.

G. E. D. DIAMOND, AGED 102
IN their selection of a bronze to pre
sent to Colonel Roosevelt the Rough
Riders could certainly have made
no better nor more appropriate
choice than they have made in tak
ing Frederic Remington's "Bronco
Buster." This spirited figure of a
cowboy battling with one of the wild
little horses of the plains is one of the
few pieces of sculpture at which Mr.
Remington has tried his hand. It is
finely modeled and has all the charac
ter and dash which have long been dis
tinguishing features of the artist's
drawings of Western life. The bronze
was executed by Tiffany & Co., and
when exhibited by them in London two
years ago it received high praise there.
It stands about two feet high, and Is
thus of dimensions which make it suit
able for the decoration of any room.
The "bronco buster," who Is engaged
in one of the most perilous feats of
his profession â that of maintaining his
seat upon a rearing horse and endeav
oring to make the "bronc' " "come
down in front again," as he would say
âhas always been a daring and pic
turesque figure on Western cattle
ranges. His business is horse-break
ing, and, his ability in this direction
being recognized, he travels about
from ranch to ranch "busting" horses
at so much a headâ usually $5 or there
abouts. A horse is said to be "busted"
when he is broken just so far as to be
ridable by one of the expert "cow
punchers." For any less skilled horse
man the animal would be as impossi
ble a mount as if his back had never
been touched by a human being. That
is to say, he will probably still buck
stiff-legged, at times, and his temper is
not warranted kind, but he is a degree
removed from the absolutely wild horse
of the prairie.
In Mr. Remington's bronze the wick
ed, frenzied expression of the bronco's
eyes, and his tense, straining musclea
give evidence of the struggle he is
making for his liberty. Rearing, with
his head plunged downward between
his forelegs, he is trying the device
which is perhaps most often success
ful in unseating his rider. But the
"buster" clings doggedly to his great
"cow saddle," with" its high pommel
and cantle, and thus far all the ani
mal's efforts have been vain. With
his left hand grasping firmly both the
horse's mane and the rope of the queer,
bitless halter, known as the "hacka
more," the cowboy uses his right arm
to wield his rawhide quirt vigorously.
This whip, with its short handle and
lash of two or three thongs, is an ef
fective weapon, and the bronco squeals
and snorts as it descends upon his flesh.
The "buster's" expression is one of de
termination and watchfulness. He is
alert to observe whether the bronco is
coming down properly or is going to
fall over backward, for in the latter
event he must be ready to spring off
instantly, lest he be caught beneath the
animal.

"UNCLE" GEORGE T. BROMLEY, aged 81.
Georjje T. Bromley Is the widely known and well be
loved "Uncle Bromley" of the famous Bohemian Club of
San Francifcco. Few men have the capacity of Mr. Brom
ley to make and keep friends. As is most fittingly said in
the parting address given him by the resident of Tientsin,
China, at the expiration of hia consulate there some ten
years since, his has been "a life without guile and a
tongue without reproach." Hla unfailing cheerfulness of
disposition, hfs true kindness of thought and act, his
fcenfallty of manner, and his brilliancy as a raconteur
have made him popular among young and old.
A native of Connecticut, Mr. Bromley has traveled
widely and has profited thereby, since he has aocumu
lated a fund of experience, story and anecdote which has
won him the reputation of being the best "after dinner
speaker" on the coast.
Although a full year more than an octogenarian
"Uncle's" age Is a matter of speculation to all save his
most intimate friends, since his handsome face, erect and
dignified flpure, and assured gait give no hint of the
years that have passed over his slightly silvered head.
I HAVE never worried in all my life. While I have
had troubles as all do I have always pu.hed them
aside and utterly refused to brood over or worry
about them. Other than this I have never taken
any care of myself whatever. I have indulged in
all the luxuries of life as far ;.s it was possible for me
to do bo. I have always loved and sought the com
panionship of those younger than myself, and am
fully convinced that being a member of the Bohemian
Club has prolonged my life.
1 began my independen life by going to sea at the
age of fourteen and the pure air, hard work and strict
discipline of those early years laid the foundation of
a constitution that has carried me through until now
and that I firmly believe will tarry me through for
many years to come.
I have been exceedingly fortunate in the matter
of my associates. It falls to the lot of few men to
form such pleasant and enduring friendships as I
have and those friendships I am assured have had
much to do with prolonging my existence.
While I have alway bee what I consider tem
perate I have never been a total abstainer except for
about six weeks some fifty years ago when a youna
lady persuaded me to oin the : Washingtonian move
ment then sweeping over the country. A month and
a half later another young lady persuaded me to give
the whole thing up and from that day to this I have
used my own judgment in regard to my beverages. I
drinl- what I like, when I like and have- never found
my bodily or mental health the worse for it.." \
while I have smoked cigars from boyhood 1 I have
never smoked a cigarette, o.' late years I eat very
little meat, in fact I eat sparingly of everything. I
do not keep specially good hours, but go and com*
as is most expedient and agreeable.
Although I am 81 I feel by no means old, and have
confidently laid my plans to round out at least a cen
tury of existence. If I succet 1 in so doing it will be
lam . convinced, because I strictly adhere to my rule- .
Don %â  worry. if a thing can be helped help it at
once; if it cannot put it out of your mind and think

24 and did excellent work in

labors among the children by
organizing the "California

which sprang the "Bands of

teachings which I am confident have helped
to preserve my life so many years beyond three score

lurked in many of the common habits of our race. I

FATHER WAUGH, AGED 90.THE sensation of the hour in Europe is M. de Rougemont, the "modern
Robinson Crusoe," who returned to France a short time ago, more than
thirty years after the time when he disappeared, and was supposed to
have been lost. It appears that during this time M. de Rougemunt
ran the gamut of savage experiences, from that of the lonely casta.vay
on a tiny island to the chief of a cannibal tribe In the interior of Aus
tralia. His story, the most remarkable of modern times, has deeply inter
ested such men as Drs. Keltic and Mill, the eminent geographers, who have
investigated It and are satisfied of its perfect accuracy. M. de Rougemont
attracts a great deal of attention wherever he appears, and has received
any number of invitations to address geographical and scientific socie
ties. Last week he appeared before the Bristol Congress of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science. His account of his experi
ences is being published serially in George Newnes' Wide World Magazine,
beginning with last month. Altogether M. de Rougemont may be called
the man of the hour. The title of the modern Robinson Crusoe, which has
been generally placed upon him. is in no way a misnomer, for the weird
remarkable experiences which he has been through have never been
equaled since Defoe wrote the story of his famous hero.
The following statement is the first account that M. de Rougemont has
given of his experiences, and covers briefly the whole ground that will be
gone over by the numerous installments of his magazine story. It is the
same story that he related to the British scientists, the truth of which has
been so carefully verified:
IN the year 1863 I left home a mere
youth and engaged in a jvearl-fish
ing venture on board the Dutch
schooner Veielland. Our pearling
grounds lay between the Australian
coast and Dutch New Guinea, After
about ten months the vessel was
wrecked on a n.iall coral island, situa
ted about tnirteen â¢ (Jegiers ouutu a-nd
125 degrees east, off the northwest coast
of Australia- I was absolutely alone,
save that I had the captain's dog with
me.
On this island, or. rather, sand-spit,
I lived for two years, and underwent
much suffering. At the end of that
time a party of blacks, who had been
blown ouc *o eea from the Australian
main, were cast upon the island on a
native raft, such as is used in fishing
expeditions. After a further period of
"I Drove the Ravenous SharKs fiv/ay by Beating the Water With
My Oar, and so Reached the Unconscious Castaways."
six months' â waiting for favorable winds
â we set out together in a boat built from
the wreck of the schooner, and I landed
with my companions on the coast of
Australia in the year JB66 â the exact
locality was < ambridge Gulf, on the
northwest coast. Of course I made
many excursions in various directions,
always with the hope of reaching civi
lization, either overland or by sea.
Eventually, however, I drifted into the
center of the continent, and oniy
reached civilization in 18S5 after an ex
ile of upward of thirty years.
When 1 first landed on the* Australian
main it may be necessary to bear in
mind that I was absolutely destitute â
without clothes, tools or instruments of
any kind, except a harpoon, a stiletto
and a steel tomahawk. I had no book
except a New Testament in the French
anC English languages; all maps and
charts had been swept away by the
heavy seas that preceded the wreck. I
had no writing materials whatever; it
was therefore impossible for me, even
if at that time I had had the wish, to
make any scientific t bservations, or to
record my wanderings. For a time,
however, I did make notes on the blank
leaves and margins of the Tes ament,
using blood for ink and a quill from a
wild boar as a pen. This book was, un
fortunately, lost after my return to
civilization in the wreck of the steamer
Matura, which was lost in the Strait
of Magellan in the present year of 1898.
When I landed on the continent I
believe vast tracts of it w*re unex
ploreJ and certainly my own knowl
edge of Australian geography was very
small and vague. If I had known even
the exact outline of Australia it would
have saved me many terrible Journeys
and years of suffering.
As I have already said, I landed on
the east side of Cambridge Gulf, as

who found their way back with me
from the little Islet by steering by the
stars. For some little time I remained
in the camp of their tribe, where I was
received in the most friendly way in
consequence of the introduction and
representations of my native wife. This
woman was one of the family of blacks
that had been cast upon my islet.
When we landed nearly all the mem
bers of the tribe and many individuals
from other tribes were gathered to see
the first white man they had ever be
held. They were not so much sur
prised, however, at my personal ap
pearance as at the form of my foot
prints, which differed very greatly
from theirs, and the few articles I pos
sessed filled them with amusement, es
pecially my boat. This â¢Iroat, which I
built on the island from the wreck and
in which I reached the mainland with
the party of natives was, unfortu
nately, lost in an encounter with a
whale, and with it disappeared my
hopes of reaching Somerset at Cape
York, a settlement of which I had
often heard the pearlers speak. Thus
1 was obliged to make the attempt by
land, and I started with my wife about
October, 1867, intending to travel due
east to the Queensland coast.
After six or seven months' traveling
â at first over a flat coaat land diversi
fied by isolated hills and then through
an elevated and very broken country â
I reached a desolate and waterless re
gion covered with spinifex, where we
both suffered terribly from thirst, and
but for the skill of my native wife In
finding water and procuring food I
should probably never have come
through It.
We soon found that we had come
considerably farther south than we in
tended, and so we struck due north,
and eventually reached a flooded river
flowing eastward, which presently led
us to the sea. This river was probably
the Ropa, entering the Gulf of Car
pentaria, but as I did not know of the
existence of such a gulf, I believed we
had reached the Queensland coast, and
I at once inquired of the tribes we met
for the nearest settlement of white
men. These natives, by the way, were
the most savage and hostile I ever en
countered in all my wanderings. They
attacked at night; but having been
warned by my native wife, we retired
from our gunyah or shelter of boughs,
and slept in the bush without a fire.
In the morning we would find our shel
ter riddled with spears. In reply to mv
inquiries, for these people were appar
ently friendly in the daytime, they
pointed to the southeast and to the
northeast, indicating that settlements
were to be found.
Then, after staying a few weeks with
the tribes living on the islands near the
mouth of the Ropa, probably the
Pellew Islands, I set out in a frail
du^-out, borrowed from these tribes, to
ascend. I believe, the Albert River, but
on account of the floods which at
that season affect all the rivers on

the coast, I changed my mind. I
then determined to coast along to the
northward, hoping to reach Somerset,
and having not the slightest idea that
the great Gulf of Carpentaria and
Cape York peninsula separatf-d mo
from the Pacific Ocean. The Bmallness
of the craft, which was quite unfit to
go far beyond shelter, and the necessi
ty for keeping a close lookout for a set
tlement, compelled us to follow every
winding of the coast.
At length, after several months of
coasting, we found the land trending
to the west, and here at Raffle's Bay
probably, we found a Malay proa. The
Malays themselves, who were beche-de
mer fishers, were willing to take us to

lays, and could not be prevailed upon
to go, I felt I could not desert her so
for from her own people, and I also
considered she had already saved my
life a great many times; thus the op
portunity passed.
Here at Raffles Bay we met a native
who spoke English and who had served
on a British man-of-war. He told us of
the settlement of Port Darwin, lying
to the southwest, and he warned me
to avoid Van Dlemans Gulf, partly on
acount of the alligators and partly,
also, on account of the innumerable
creeks I should have to ascend in
search of the settlement, for it must
always be borne in mind that none of
my informants gave me exact and pre
cise information, some of them simply
indicating the direction. We landed on
the northern coast of Melville Island,
and after we had again reached the
coast of the mainland through Apsley
Strait we experienced a terrible storm,
which must have driven us past Port
Darwin. For whole nights my native
wife and I would be immersed in the
sea, clinging to the gunwale of our
frail craft. At last, , about eighteen
months after we had left my wife's
home in the Cambridge Gulf region, we
one day recognized certain Islands and
also the coast, and soon afterward we
found ourselves, to our great surprise,
at the very spot from which we had
started. Of course, I had to pretend
that my return was anything but in
voluntary.
The next attempt I made was to the
southwest, starting after some months
of rest, and coasting in the dugout as
far as King Sound. I landed upon and
explored many of the Islands dotted
along that extensive stretch of coast,
and in some of them I found caves with
rude drawings on the rocks. On what
was probably Bigges Island I found a
cairn of stones, which I readily saw
must have been the handiwork of a
white man.
We returned to the old camp over
land, crossing the King Leopold
Ranges, which were finely wooded, and
appeared to be largely composed of
granite. Beyond those ranges the
country was a moderately elevated
plateau, intersected, by many very fine
creeks and rivers, and covered with
long grass from twelve to fifteen feet in
heightâ so high as to make traveling
difficult. We even had to fire it to clear
a track. There were also on this
plateau a number of curious looking
abrupt pinnacles of bare rock rising
above the general level surface. We
next struck an undulating country,
covered with sharp broken pebbles of
white quartz, with ledges of slate
creeping out. In this quartz I saw gold
for the first time I had ever looked
upon it in its native state.
We n?xt struck what was probably
the Orde River, which we followed
down to Cambridge Gulf, and returned
along the coast to our own home. On
returning from this Journey I felt lit-

tie inclination to make another at
tempt, and for three years I lived
among the natives, becoming accus
tomed to the life and rinding it not dis
agreeable. I was interested in study
ing' their customs, and the customs and
languages of their neighbors. For this
I had a motive. In those early days it
vros always my object to make the ac
quaintance of tribes who could render
me assistance in escaping overland.
The desire to reach civilization re
turned, and about the year 1873 I
started with my wife, resolving this
time to cross the continent to the
south, as I knew in a vague kind of
way that there were great towns on
the coast somewhere to the south. I
had only the very haziest idea, how
ever, of their position. On our way
south we first crossed a range of gran
ite mountains running east and west.
After crossing this range we came to
a low and slightly undulating coun
try covered with dark chocolate col
ored loam of great depth. I found here
a most extraordinary richness of vege
tation and animal life, especially a
kind of water rat. I found creeks with
very deep channels cut in the soft, rich
loam. We were, I should think, about
a woek crossing this rich country, com
ing more or less south.
The tribes were very numerous, and
altogether it was very thickly popu
lated. I never traveled due south, but
found it expeditious to go from tribe to
tribe and from water hole to water
hole. As far as possible I kept on my
own courso, bidding the tribes adieu
when our ways lay in diametrically op
posed directions. Besides having my
native wife with me I was armed with
a certain mystic message stick, and,
best of all, I had the power of amusing
the tribes by means of acrobatic per
formances, my steel weapons and the
lurk of my dog, who could also go
through a little performance on his
own account, dancing to the tune of
my reed whistle. I emphasize these
things because they sav^d my life over
and over again; somenow I always
managed to ingratiate myself with
even the most hostile tribes.
When we had been three or four
weeks out we traversed a rough coun
try of low limestone ranges, abounding
in caves, in contrast with the gTanite
ranges further north, in which I had
found no caves. In these caves I found
bones, also the skull of a kangaroo,
which was so large that at first I took
it to be that of a horse; its skull was
probably two or three times larger
than the skull of the largest kangaroo
I ever saw. It belonged probably to
an extinct species.
In traversing the desert belts, which
we crossed on this journey, and indeed
at all times, we were In the company
of the various tribes we met, conse
quently our course was often east and
west instead of directly southward, ac
cording to the water holes, the nature
of the country and other circum
stances. Thus we wandered from place
to place, sometimes accompanying par
ties of the natives on their hunting and
fighting expeditions, but always mak
ing for the south whenever possible,
crossing ranges and desert tracks.
In the desert country water is ob
tained from the roots of the Mallee
tree, a species of eucalyptus. The roots,
which lie near the surface, are dug out
for a length of about twelve feet. They
are about two inches in diameter, and
are cut in lengths of about two feet,
and sucked or allowed to drain Into a
vessel or ekin water bag. These roots
yield pure and refreshing water of a
slightly earthy flavor.
When we were perhaps seven months
out we came suddenly upon four white
men. At this time we were with a
small party of blacks, who were on a
punitive expedition. 1 The party had al
ready been attacked by these same
white men and had retaliated, and
therefore they were by no means dis
posed to be friendly. Naturally, in the
excitement of the moment. I forgot
that I was virtually a black man my
self, and rushed upon them, but they
promptly fired upon us and retreated.
I now know them to have been the
Giles expedition of 1874. I should point
out that I was perfectly naked, like
the savages, and was anointed with the
same protective covering of black,
greasy clay, which Is used by the na
tives to ward off cold and the attacks
of insects, but, apart from this, the
sun had long since tanned ray skin out

of all resemblance to a European. Re
pulsed In this way more than once, I
despaired of ever making my real
charccter known.
Two or three weeks after the en
counter my wife came upon the tracks
of a man whom she described as a white
man, and a man no longer in his
senses. She deduced this latter fact
from the eccentric circles which the
tracks followed. Following up these
tracks we did find a white man alone
and dying froâ thirst. He was hope
lessly imbecile. He lived with me for
two years, a serious incumbrance, and
never regained his intelligence until
just before he died. He asked who I
was and where he was and then he
said his name was Gibson, and that he
had been a member of the Giles expedi-
The place where he was lost was, I
now understand, called by the Giles
expedition "Gibson's Desert," and It
lies In the southeast of Western Aus
tralia.
After Gibson's death I made up my
mind to end my days in solitude, and
the reason for this was partly that I
seemed doomed to disappointment
every time an opportunity offered it
self to return to civilization and part
ly, also, on the urgent solicitations of
my wife and the tribes with whom I
lived. They pointed out to me that I
had everything a man could want and
that I could be king among them. It
was moreover quite evident to them
that my fellow white men did not want
me. Thus for something like twenty
years I made my home with them in
the mountainous region near the cen
ter of the continent, where I ultimate
ly became king, or ruler over a num
ber of large tribes. From this moun
tain home I made frequent long jour
neys, and traversed at one time or an
other a great part of the interior of
the continent.
Once I followed on the camel track
of a white party with the tribe for the
purpose of picking up empty tins and
for other things useful to us, and I
came upon an Australian newspaper. I
remember it was the Sydney Town and
Country Journal, bearing date bome
where between 1874 and 1876. It was a
surprise indeed. I rend it over and
over until I had learned it by heart,
and I preserved it in an opossum skin
cover until it was literally worn to
pieces.
Much of the information this news
paper contained puzzled me greatly,
and 1 nearly worried myself into in
sanity over a statement that "the dep
uties of Alsace and Lorraine had re
fused to vote in the German Parlia
ment and had walked out." Turn it
over how I might I could not under
stand how the representatives of two
great departments in my own country
could possibly be in the German Par
liament â knowing absolutely nothing,
of course, of the war of 1870.
The tribe over which I reigned was
composed of beings who were certainly
low down in the human scale, but at
the same time they have elaborate
laws, which govern their daily life pre
cisely as in the case of civilized peo
ple. Briefly described, they are sav
ages, repulsive in appearance, who
have not even risen to such a point of
civilization as to have permanent
houses, addicted to cannibalism, and
altogether of a very degraded type.
But, nevertheless, I must say that they
have many ~ood qualities and that
their code of honor wouid bear com
parison with that of any civilized na
tion.
Although no permanent houses were
erected, the natives with whom I lived
did build habitations, which they oc
cupied during the two or three month 3
of cold weather. These were made of
sticks driven into the ground, around
which branches, twigs, roots and
brushes were interwoven like a basket.
The spaces in the walls were covered
with mud or with the material used
in the construction of the white ant's
nest. In cold weather the huts were
lined with emu and kangaroo skins,
and they are much more comfortable
than can probably be imagined from
my description.
Frequently the number of these huts
gathered together in one place form*
a large village, though at other times
the communities split up into tribes of
twenty or thirty families each. Each
family, on the average, consists of or.c
man, three women and five or six chil
dren, so that even a single tribe makes
a very considerable gathering.
While mv natives did not, as a rule,
paint the body, on great occasions,
such as corroborees, initiation ceremo
nies and other festivities, they paint
and decorate themselves elaborately,
each tribe having its own design of
decoration, and even a geometrical de
sign for each ceremony. The pigments
used in decoration are of many colors,
but chiefly yellow, red, white and
black.
Ordinarily the only clothing known
consists of a coating of greasy clay,
mixed with charcoal. This serves
many purposes. It keeps off the cold
during winter and is also a protection
against the attacks of insects. In sum
mer a special kind of pigment is used
to keep off insects, and this material
is scented with a kind of pennyroyal.
They occasionally stick on to this
clay clothing the feather-down from
cockatoos, geese, ducks, turkeys and
other birds. This serves as a further
protection, and when they want to im
prove upon the touches of red, they
use blood obtained from the arm of a
man.
Other ornaments are the wing and
tail feathers from all the large birds,
such as the- emu or native companion,
these being worn in the hair usually.
They also make use of feather tuns on
the breast and shoulders, while the
bones and teeth of animals are made
into jingling necklaces. From this
brief description, it will be evident that
my subjects presented a most fantas
tic appearance on full-dress occasions,
and it must be added that they are
cannibals.
Cannibalism prevails to a very great

extent, but is governed by many rules.
Usually it is the slain victims in bat
tle that are eaten by the victorious side,
and as the object seems to be to ac
quire the valor and virtues of the per
son eaten, I endeavored to wean the
tribes from cannibalism by assuring
them that if they made bracelets, ank
lets and necklaces out of the dead
man's hair they would achieve their
end equally well.
When a family grows too large, and
the motherâ being the beast of burden
âis unable to carry one of the chil
dren, the father orders it to be clubbed
and eaten. This, however, is entirely
actuated by love, as the natives have
a horror of natural decay. Maimed
and deformed children are also killed
and eaten. Women and people who
die a natural death are never eaten.
When a man has to be eaten there is
always a grand corroboree. All parts
are consumed, the brain, heart and kid
neys being considered special delica
cies. Some of the bones, such as those
from the ankle, are used as ornaments.
Often they are strung together to form
jingling necklaces, but they are chiefly
made up into war belts, which rattle
when the owner dances. Other bones
are uaed in connection with sorcery to
bring about the death of enemies, and
these are known as the death bones.
The skulls are kept and hung in trees
to commemorate the victory, but are
never carried about; Any bones that
are left are burned and are never
given to the dogs.
Human flesh is not prepared or cook
ed in the usual cooking places but a
special fire is made for the purpose in
an oven dug in the aand.
The natives are not ashamed to con
fess cannibalism, nor is an individual
considered unclean after joining in a
feast. From this account it may ap-
pear that my natives were not a pleas
ant people tv live among. But I found
the reverse to be the case. They were
always cheerful, obedient and deferen
tial in their manner, and many times
did I owe mv life to the care exercised
by my faithful native wife.
It was possible to devise many oc
cupations, which were at least sufficient
to pass thp time. For amusement I
used to search the beds of the water
courses for curious stones. In a great
many of these water-courses I found
both coarse ar.d fine gold, and in some
instances the creeks were- extremely
rich in alluvial gold. In some cases a
bed of cement or concrete was found
at the bottom of a creek, gold was
sticking out at the sides, which proved
that there was a large proportion 'of
that precious metal in the concrete. , I
frequently picked up large nuggets,
but had no use for the metal, save to
make ornaments for my wife, but these
she did not appear to value, and
promptly gave them away to some chil
dren wherewith to amuse them. Al
luvial gold was found to the north of
my mountain home, and reef gold to
the south, the richest deposits of all
occuring in the southwest.
In several localities we found low^
ridges of iron stone mixed with red
clay, very similar to those I beheld in
the vicinity of R-ount Margaret when
I reached civilization at these Western
Australian gold fields. Among these
iron stone ranges broken iron stone and
quartz were lyir^g in immense heaps
or hillocks, and in almost every piece
of stone coarse gold could be seen.
There are thousands of tons of this
auriferous stone. Lying on the sur
face, in another locality, an iron stone
formation stands up above the ground
to a height of about four feet; it is
twenty feet wide and over three hun
dred in length. In all the depressions
of water-courses in the neighborhood
both coarse and fine gold is plentiful.
The surface here for some distance ap
pears to be full of gold.
In another district I found large
quantities of native copper lying about
in pieces. All these localities, though
far removed from a settlement, can be
reached without much difficulty by
properly equipped transport parties,
and I hope before long tÂ« have the sat
isfaction and reward of leading the
first prospecting expedition to exploit
them.
My w/.d life came to an end at last.
An epidemic of influenza swept over
the country and carried off my wife,
who had in the most literal sens> been
my guardian angel for so many years.
My surviving children were also swept
away.
Thus left alone, without the old in
terests that had made life tolerable, I
determined to make a la6t effort to
reach my own people, and leaving my
mountain home I set out for the south
y/est. On this, however, as in all my
journeys I was never able to take a
direct line, but had to go hither and
thither with the tribes amomg whom I
was sojourning.
After a time I found a tree marked

Taught by bitter previous experience
I knew that before I could appear
among the whites I should have to get
some of my natives to procure soma
clothes for me by any means known

When at length I presented myself
before the white men I am afraid they
did not at first look with favor on their
guest. I answered their questions and
when they heard I was without mates
and had been Journeying, hither from
the interior for nine or ten months they
were convinced I was a person of weak
intellect. A question of my own, "What
year is this? ' convinced them alto
gether that they were right in their
conjecture.
However, in the end I obtained help
and work, and in 1895 I reached Mel
bourne, whence by slow stages and not
without many difficulties I got back
this year to Europe.

Miss Mary Yoemans of Humboldt County Found

down. The beetle is a symbol of the j
resurrection, and is found in all Egyp
tian tombs. Every one knows how of- |
ten the butterfly is used to symbolize
the. resurrection.
Miss Yeomans possesses boxes and \
boxes of beetles, which she has gath- :
ered, but which she intends to keep for :
her own private collection. More beau- '
tlful than Jewel* they reflected the sun-
Ught in a thousand colors as she shook

"When we first came out here we !
were very lonely away up here in the
mountains, but we had to make our
farming venture a success, for we had
to ll\ c. you see.
"I had collected butterflies in Eng
land, and know the rare ones. One ;
day I was out on those mountains back
that way," pointing to some hign hills
on the horizon. "My brothers were

"Such a chase as I had: I could run

the flock .wheel and fly back to the
I top of the hill again, where there were
I quantities of yellow flowers. I might
have known they would come back to
the yellow flowers, but I quite lost my
head.
"At dark I had fourteen butterflies.
The boys helped me to pin them on
my setting braid as we sat around the
campfire.
"I knew that the rest of the flock
could be caught in the morning, and
I was out before the sun was up, for
that is the easiest time to catch but
terflies, for they are sluggish then and
I stick to the damp foliage.
"Yes, I caught the rest to pin down.
! Money was rather scarce with us then
! and I was saving my postage, which
; meant a good bit of a sum, so, as a
I safeguard, I sketched my butterfly in
water color and sent the sketch home
to England.
"Such a long wait as I had and fancy
my delight when word came to send
my entire flock to London.
"You'll never guess what they of

you they were rare specimens? Twen
ty-five dollars each. As there were

vested in three very fine sheep.
"Well, that was the beginning. Aft^r
that I worked in real earnest. You
see California is very rich in new spe
cies both of butterflies and beetles."
Then Miss Yeomans showed me a cat
alogue of a firm in Paris which deals
j only in butterflies, and every butterfly
i or beetle has its marked value; some
| of them ranging as high as $100.
In Europe many people in private
' life, who have plenty of money and
i nothing to do, make these collections
I and pay great prices for rare or beau
tiful specimens, so that it is a regular
i business to handle butterflies and bee
j ties. There are at least three largo
' firms in London and Paris with peve
i ral hundred thousand dollars capital
i invested.
"Americans," continued Miss Yeo
â  mans, "uso these specimens in their
museums, and every college has its
specimens for the students. They are
I my customers."
Miss Ycoroiins' cellar is not intended
; for vegetable? or eatables, but for the
rearing of beetles.
In one corner is a box filled with
what lookf? like sticks of wood for the
kitchen stove.
"This Is my nursery and these my
: babies," she explained. "May be lam
1 their Bluebeard, though, for I make
out of this box the series of the life
of a beetle from the time it is in the
egg to maturity."
Then she took up one stick and
showed it to me. It was split down
the middle, but the two halves were
held together by a rubber band. In
a hole between the two sticks she had
; put a beetle to eat Ltfl way through the
wood. When it works its way out she
will put it back again and so prevent
: its running away. These beetles arp
. worth $3 each. iÃhe receives $15 for
' the entire "synopsis, " which consists of
I a male and female adult, eggs, larva,
pupa, in different stages, showing the
i entire metamorphosis. The beetle on
| that particular stick was one which
wap. supposed to grow only In Italy.
"On" 1 day a stranger and his son came
to our house," said Miss Yopmtins.
"He war. n Frenchman and asked per
mission to stay a few days while he
collected buttorflieÃ in the vicinity.
"I was surprised, of course, but said
THE SAN FTiANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1898.
at once we would be glad to have them
stop with us. I did not tell him
though, that I was collecting. The
stranger came home one morning. He
had spent the night going about the
flowers in the garden with a candle, and
was perfeptly jubilant.
" 'I have found one so great beauty, 1
he said in ecstacy. 'For so many years
I have hunted, hunted, hunted! Mow I
have him!'
" 'Why, I know that species. I have
seen it before.' 1 exclaimed.
" 'You, you know some things?'
"I bowed low and whispered to him
I had carefully kept the secret from
every one that I was an idiot.
" "Ah, madam,' he went on deprecat
ingly, "you will pardon an old man
who is too enthusiastic. To me they
are so wonderful, these jewels which
people look at but do not see. And
you, madam, can it be that to you, too,
is known this so great marvels?'
"That stranger was Dr. Lo Fontnni
of Paris, and such a delightful man!
He taught me many things, and this
beetle was the 'beauty' he found in
the garden.
"Wherever you find one its mate is
sure to be not far away, and he and I
hunted together and found it. They
were the ancestors of these in this box
The Dragon, Ichthyosaurus, as It LcoÃed When Alive.
and my box has never been empty
since then."
I was curious to see what manner of
"beauty" it was. Miss Yeomans
laughed and said: "You had better
not."
"Why?"
"You are doomed to disappointment if
you do," and poking about in the saw
dust she raked out a dead beetle and
put it into my hand.
There it lay, to me a slender, black,
long-legged bug hnlf an inch long, for
I am not one who, as the doctor put it,
"know some things."
This doctor was a famous French
scholar afid was traveling in this coun
try with his son. The latter, according
to the farmers around Miss Yeomans'
ranch, was also "a bug catcher." He
carried back to France many entirely
new species. The boy made enough
out .of the collection he made to pay
all Vis share of the expenses of the
trip across the ocean and across a
continent. Dr. Le Fontani planned the
trip to California because he was sure
valuable specimens could be found out
here. He could find no native Califor
nians to make collections and he had
never heard of Miss Yoemans, and he
came out himself. Through his in
fluence Miss Yoemans found better
markets for her specimens and he him
self was able to make more extended
researches.
Miss Yoemans likewise can find no
one to help her in collecting except a
small Indian boy.
Four or five years ago a small,
brown, barefoot boy emptied his pock
ets on her kitchen table. He had i
caught some rare butterflies which he
called his flying flowers. His mother
had washed for the Yoemans, bring
ing her boy with her. He had seen
Miss Yoemans' cabinets full of butter
flies, as boys will see things you ne^ver
give them credit for. In running about
the hills he watched the bugs and had !
learned a good deal of their habits. 1
Whenever he found butterflies he had |
never seen before he caught them and j
brought them to Miss Yoemans.
"I could have cried when I saw those i
crumpled remains, for they were noth- j
ing else," she said. "They happened '
to be a very rare kind and the custo
dian of the Smithsonian Institution
had asked me to try to find the very i
species. I told Joe I would give him j
a dollar if he would bring me some j
more. He could not find any, but j
brought me instead a big beetle. It I
was not one I recognized, for, you see,
I know a great many beetles and can
tell at a glance what they are. I killed I
it with ether and made a careful draw- j
ing of it and sent it to the custodian of
the Academy of Sciences in Fhiladel- \
phia, with a description of the place i
it had been found. I told him I had j
sent the same drawing and description
to Washington. It is ju.st as well to 'â .
sell in an open market, you know.
â 'In a few days I was surprised to see
our next neighbor ride into our ranch
in a great hurry and give my brother -i
telegram. The neighbors were sure
some one was dead, so my brother
opened the telegram with a very se
rious face. As for me, I was near
fainting, for telegrams are almost un
known in this corner of Humboldt
County.
" Mary, he wants a bug,' said brother
at last.
â  Who wants a bug?'
" 'T.iis wise man of Philadelphia.'
"Ho was afraid the other mazi might
get the beetle whose picture I had
telegraphed, and asked me <o sell It to
him at my own price."
"And what was your price?" I asked.
"Fitteen dollars, and it was the most
valuable beetle I ever sold.
"I went with Joe to the place where
he had found it. If there is one there
are sure to be more, if you. know where
to look for them.
"When the reply rame from the man
at Washington offering me $10 I sent
him one. I sold four others â one' for $3,
one for $5 and one for $6â and now I
can get only $1 each for them, because
they are no longer rare. The species
was supposed to live only in the Alps,
and was very scarce."
Miss Yoenians goes through the red
woods every year to collect her speci
mens. Spreading a white sheet on the
grcund, she gathers up the refuse un
der the trees and scatters it on the I
sheet. When something moves she
looks to see what It is, and if it proves
to be a good specimen she places over it
a wide-mouthed bottle having a sponge
dipped in a solution of cyanide of po
tassium, which kills the insect instant
ly. This last year has been very bad
for insects, for they demand moisture, i
and there has been so little rain.
A singular custom prevails among the
Tartars or Kurds. If a. man gets into dif
ficulties, 1. <-â¢.. loses his cattle or other
movable property, he pours a little brown
sugar into a piec4 of colored cloth, ties it
up, ami carries one such parcel to earn of
his friends and acquaintance-. In return
he is presented, according to circum
stance, with a cow. or sheep, or a sum of
money. He is thus at once set on his ;
legs again. The same method Is adopted
whon a young man wishes to marry, but
is not in a position to satisfy the parents
of his intended brido in the matter of the
"bashlyg"â i. c.. mariage dower. Only Jn
this crise he- does not go round himself,
but sends a friend or a servant.
THE FRAM'S
NEXT TRIP
JUDGING from the comments with
which the American press recent
ly accompanied a couple of tele
prams about the Fram having
been reported seen by different
vessels since she' started on her
second expedition to the Arctic regions,
it will not be amiss to -give the Ameri
can public a few data about the new
Fram expedition. It is not a "private
scientific expedition, chiefly English,
under command of Lieutenant Johan
sen," as the papers have repeatedly
stated, but it is a scientific expedition,
essentially Norwegian, under the com
mand of Captain Sverdrup, the well
known commander of the Fram dur
ing Nansen's expedition.
Expenses of the present expedition
are mainly borne by three Norwegian
capitalists, the same men who were the
chief private contributors to Nansen's
expeditionâ the two brothers Ringnces,
brewers, and Consul Heiberg. The
Norwegian state has, besides' giving the
use of the Pram, which is state prop
erty, also directly contributed to the
expedition.
This expedition Is larger than Nan
sen's, consisting of sixteen members,
including the loader, Captain Sverdrup,
while Nansen had only twelve follow
ers on his expedition. Outside of Sverd
rup there is only one of the members
of the old Nansen expedition partici
pating in the present one. P.' L. Hen
driksen, from Tromso, Norway, a skip
per who for sixteen years has devoted
his time and energy to Arctic travel,
hunting and fishing. The vessel is this
time commanded by Victor Baumann,
a lieutenant in the Norwegian navy.

WONDERFUL SKELETON OF A DRAGON
DISCOVERED IN ENGLAND.
THE complete skeleton of a dragon has at last been
unearthed, lying just as it did when it breathed
its last. This is one of the most important finds
ever made in the way of geological remains.
It was in England that this valuable skeleton
was found. The locality has long been famous for its bones
and fossils, but has never yielded anything to equal this.
The little Warwickshire village of Stockton, plowed and
excavated by three manufacturing cement firms, claims
all the honor.
The late rector of that city educated the quarrymen by
lectures and in conversation to understand and value the
prehistoric bones and fossils that they constantly un
earthed. With their help he formed a collection that now
constitutes the nucleus of a county museum.
The saurian remains found in the vicinity of Stockton
have always been fragmentary, a fact due, most likely, to
the men's careless digging. To prevent any calamities in
the future the rector instructed the men to send for an
expert if ever they came across what appeared to be a
large portion of a skeleton.
In the case of the dragon, the latest find, this was done.

a Dane. The Swede Is EL G. Simmons,
a botanist, and the Dane Edward liay,
a zoologist. The physician and sur
geon is Dr. Johan Svendsen of Bergen,
Norway, and the scientific staff out
side of the men named consists of one
geologist, P. Schel, and one lieutenant
of cavalry, G. I. Isachsen, who is to act
as chartographer and attend to the
magnetical and astronomical observa
tions. The remaining members of the
expedition are seamen, mechanics and
sportsmen generally.
The Fram has, before starting on this
expedition, undergone considerable al
terations, the front part having been
raised so as to be a little higher than
the poop, which formerly arose consid
erably above the stern. Thereby has
been gained considerable more space
I for staterooms, and the men now have
very commodious quarters. The elec

It was a big Job. The expert proceeded slowly and
with great caution and In due time uncovered the remains
of a noble ichthyosaurus. He lies forty-five feet below
the surface; twenty feet in length, the head two feet across
and three feet ten inches long. The paddles are unusually
distinct. The front pair are two feet six Inches and the
hind pair one foot eight inches in length. The tail is ab
ruptly curved and some of the lumbar vertebrae are slight
ly displaced. The pelvic ring is missing, removed, perhaps,
before the nature of the find was guessed and still to be
recovered.
The quarry where the find was made belongs to M.
Larkin of Leamington, who intends to present the speci
men to the South Kensington Museum.
Crowds from all parts of the county throng to see
dragon's skeleton and not a little vigilance is necessary
to protect it from dishonest visitors attempting to purloin
teeth or fragments. It has been beautifully photographed
by H. Elkington of Broadwell. Rugby, who will, on ap
plication, furnish copies to geologists and others desiring
them. â¢ . ...... _.. L;k-L i â.*.k^ ti. fc^*i: jj. Â»uu.'. ii . . .
on the previous expedition has been re
moved on account of the unsteadiness
of the ' Arctic winds, which had to fur
nish power for the electric plant.
There is nothing English about the
expedition at all, and published state
ments to that effect must be due to
the expedition being mixed up with the
Antartic expedition, which, under com
mand of Carsten Borchgrevink. on the
Southern Cross, is starting.
Expenses of that expedition are borne
by an Englishman. Sir George Newne*,
and its twenty-six members are about
evenly divided between Englishmen
and Norwegians.
The object Captain Sverdrup has in
view with the Fram is to circum,navi-,
gate and explore the Arctic regions to
the north and east of Greenland, but
there is no intention of trying to find
the north pole. The sole and only ob
ject of this expedition is scientific re
search.AFTER LY

the Hermitage near by, is the nearest
place of permanent abode to the mouth
of the crater.
The base of the mountain mass is
some thirty-three miles in circumfer
ence, with its axis nearly parallel to
the shore of the bay. The base of the
cone proper, which first sprung up dur
ing the eruption of A. D. 79, is 23 X) feet
above the sea and the apex from IGOO
to 1900 feet higher. . This height varies
after each -eruption, the greatest re
corded being 2053 feet. The apex is
truncated with a rim, according to re
cent observation, of 2000 feet in diame
ter and a crater of between 500 and COO
feet deep.
On the north and east, partly circling
Vesuvius, Is Monte Somma, whose
highest peak, Punta Nasone, is 3730 feet
high, and between the two lies th deep
vailey, Atrio del Cavallo, and on the
west the Vetrana, which Is being filled
with lava by the present eruption. A
good carriage drive runs from Resina
to the foot of the cone and a cable rail
road took travelers up to the top.
Previous to. the first recorded erup
tion of A. D. 79, which overwhelmed
Herculaneuni and Pompeii, the rid of
Monte Romrna, 4000 feet high, encircled
a depressed plain, the mouth of an old
crater; three miles! in circumference.
No writing or tradition gave any direct
hint that it had over been a scene of
disturbance, or was not as safe as the
fertile and populous Campania. around
the base. The geographer. Strabo,
writing in the time of Augustus Caesar,
said of it: "Mount Vesuvius Is cov
ered with beautiful meadows, with the
exception of the summit. rh : latter is,
indeed, for the most part, level, but
quite sterile, for it has an appearance
like ashes and shows rugped rocks of
sooty color/and consistency] as if they
had been consumed by lire. One might
conclude from this that the mountain
had once burned and Possessed 'fi#ry
abysses, Hid had become extinguished

two streams of lava to get a little near

their heads, but left us to our fate and
went back down the mountain.
It was well they did. We had gone
slowly up for perhaps an hour. The
heat meanwhile had grown so intense
that I was dripping with perspiration.

Suddenly there was a report like a

smell, and it seemed as if the top of
the mountain had been blown off. We
did not slop to see just what had hap

steep mountain. It was as if a dam of

A WOUNDED
SOLDIER'S STORY.
WE stopped at a cot far down
the line in the soldiers' pavil
ion at Bellevue.
"Here's a queer case," said
the doctor. "Look, see the .red
mark on his breast! it's almost gone;
and then this other one at the back.
The bullet went clean tHrough the left
lung. It's a wonder he's alive to-day.
We pumped out â let me see â "
"A hundred and sixteen ounces," said
the soldier.
It was easy to see that his mind had
dwelt on these figures. One hundred
and sixteen ounces of blood â his. blood.
He had thought of this for days, reck
oning it up at first with apprehension,
afterward with a certnin pride. This
was his title to distinction in the ward.
"Exactly; one hundred and sixteen
ounces from the left lung. The house
surgeon thought pus would forfn, and
wanted to cut away the ribs, but I
sfuck to the pumping and he pulled
through. If he'd been a smoker, though,
he'd be a dead smoker now, but his
heart was sound and could stand half
rations of air."
"I don't drink, either," said the sol
dier, "that is, nothing but beer. I'm a
German."
'"Are you?" said I. "Where from?"
"Fort German, lowa. I'm a quarter
master sergeant in the Sixteenth In
fantry."
He seemed an intelligent quartermas
ter sergeant, so I talked to him a while,
letting the doctor go on.
"Was it ai San Juan you got hit?" I
asked.
"Yesâ half way up the hill. It didn't
hurt muchâ just jarred me like a good
punch."
"Did you keel over on the ground?"
"Keel over nothing. I went 'un up the
hill."
"What â with a bullet- through your

"Cert'nly. I tell you it didn't hurt;
it just bled a little where the ball came
out."
"And you went on fighting?"
"Yes, sir; I kt pt right on â up aways,
then down flat on the ground, then up
again, firing and yelling and laying low
until we got to the blockhouse."
"How long did you fight after you got

"About an hour, I guess â until we

THE FIRE-FIEND OF CALIFORNIA.
NEVER in the history of California has the fire fiend raged with
the fury he has during the past eight months.
New Year's day came and passed without a fire of any conse
quence on any part of the Pa< i!i Coast The next day, however, the
fiend started on his mission ol destruction. On that date a destruc
tive fire started in Fruitvale and since then the smoke has hardly ever
cleared away from the face of the State of California.
Ail parts <>f the Pacific Coast suffered, but California was afflicted the
worst. The almost unprecedented lack of rainfall last winter left the in
terior valleys as dry as tinder. The starting of a small lire spread like
lightning and in Beveral instances wiped whole towns out of existence.
Square miles of timber land wont ur> in smoke.
It is impossible to compute the exact amount of the loss, but it runs
up into tens of millions. As a rule insurance has been light so that the
suffering from the fires has been most severe.
Many of the fires have been accidental, a few are unexplainable, but
the larger number have been incendiary.
At one time so many fir- s were deliberately started with intent to de
stroy property that the authorities began to fear there was a concerted plot
to burn up a large section of the State.
Forest fires raged fiercely all through* the summer and thousands of
acres were laid waste. Many of these fires were caused by the careless
nesfl of campers, but that they si.re.nl to such a disastrous extent was due
to the dry winter. The loss of lumber will foot up Into millions of dollars,
but a still greater loss conies from the fact that in several instances the
destruction of the forests was also the destruction of very Important water
sheds. The valuable San (iabriel Canyon in !>>s Angeles County id a loss
that cannot be estimated in dollars, and the problem of how it is to be re
placed is one that will have to be solved by the residents.
Not a day ha? passed this year without its record of a serious fire. In
some of the interior cities fires of [ess than $1000 were so common that no
notice was paid to them. Fire engines were always on the run and the
alarm bell constantly clanging. Very few town:- in the State escaped fire
losses.
On the Pacific Coast, outside of California, the work of the fire fiend has
been most severe. Several towns have been wiped out. The worst of these
fires were at Fort 'Wninprel Alaska, where the loss footed up nearly $2,000,
000; New Westminster, B. C, where the loss was placed at $2,500,000, and
Jerome, Ariz., where the loss was over $1,000,000.
The following brief list will give an idea of the enormous extent of the
fires. None of thoso referred to was a loss of less than $5000, but the ma
jority run up into the tens of thousands:
SEVENTY THOUSAND RATS
KILLED BY THIS DOG
808 is dead. Bob, the greatest
rat-killing dog that ever struck
San Francisco, is dead. He
passed away quietly a few days
ago in Wheland & Collins' cel
lar, the place that has been his
home for nearly twenty years.
For the last two or three years Bob
has not been as young as he used to
be. His eyes have been dim and his
teeth nearly all gone, but up to the
last few hours before his passing over
into the happy hunting grounds of all
good dogs he was able to kill rat?.
When he refused to tackle a rodent his
owner shook his head and declared that
Bob's end must be near.
For nearly a fifth of a century Bob's
rat-killing performances have been a
marvel to all who saw him at that
work. The little Scotch terrier was
conceded by dog fanciens to be a won
der in his way.
Tim had two ways of killing rats.
Those that he caught himself and
those that had been caught in traps
and brought to him for extermination
each required different modes of treat
ment.
The rats that Bob caught himself
were killed in rath>-r a tame manner.
He Pimply chased his game among the

bottles and barrels of the dust-covered
s of the cellar and when he ;
caught ii death was an instantaneous;
s uf the proceeding.
But when a tr;ip full of squealing ro
dents was brought to him all ready for j
killingâ that was a different matter.
In an Instant the little Scotch terrier
pricked up his ears. He was all ready
for business and jumped about the trap
in the liveliest manner.
There was no need for holding back
the ruts in order to give Bob a chance
to kill them. The trap was usually
opened from the bottom and the ro
dents dumped out in a bunch. Then
thf fun began. The more ratft the
merrier for Bob.
Before the first rat had a chance to
touch the ground Bob had his teeth
into its back. One crunch and the rat
i was finished. This performance he
! kept up for only a second or two and
then pitch) d Into the rats that were
(â limbing all around him. Like light
! ring he darted here and there, seizing
the nearest and giving it one grip over
th-- spinal column. No second bite was
ever need* d.
The rat-killing record of this little
i terrier is most surprising. Ten rats a
day was a low record for Bob, but even
at this rate in one year he killed 3650
:by actual account kept on a tab. In
ten years 38,500, and in twenty years
'â¢ 73.000.

SITE OF OUR NEW CITT HALL
WAS A CEMETERY THIRTY TEARS AGO.
After the bodies wero moved from the old Yerba Buena Cemetery grading; of the sand hills was commenced on
the site for the erection of the new City Hall July 28, IS7O, and was completed in the following year. The work of lay
ing the concrete bed for the foundation wall of the new City Hall was commenced September 18, IS7I.
ALMOST half a century ago San Francisco thought
she was growing: and was destined to take a po
sition in the worid for herself so she determined
to improve herself for her forthcoming station. At
that time her limits were house-tents and sheet-
Iron structures lining the waters of the bay, which came
up to Montgomery street. One of her first moves toward
self-improvement was to move her cemetery further out
into the country.
At that time the city was growing toward North Beach,
so the territory bounded by Powell, Stockton, Lombard
and Chestnut streets was ordered leveled and all the
bodies in graves therein were ordered removed to the new
city cemetery.
The site for the new cemetery, which was official];- called
the Yerba Buena Cemetery, was where the new City Hall
now stands. The city fathers thought it would be many
a year before the city would reach that. then d..,tant place.
'i liat was in the early fifties. At once the work began
of moving $ the bodies to Y.-.erba Buena Cemetery. Al
though many of th c bodies of those pioneers were un
identified the City Counsel determined to keep a record of
all interments in t he new cemetery. This was done.

It has just been discovered that through the usual offi
cial carelessness and negligence the records have been al
most destroyed.
The documents covering the period from the opening of
the cemetery until the date of its condemnation were
stored away in the basement of the City Hall. Laborers
raked them together, tossed them l.ito garbage wagons arrd
the fires of the crematory left not a trace behind.
In 1554 Lone Mountain Cemetery was opened and su
perceded Yerba Buena Cemetery for general use, but many
were interred in the Yerba Buena ground for years after
ward.
At last it was derided for a second time to disturb the
bones of those who were first carried to the old grave
yard out toward North Beach. The work of remov#ig the
remains from Yerba Bucna began. It was probably a con
tract job, as when preparations f"r the laying of the new
City Hall corner-stone were being made groups of boys
who came to watch the work remained to uncover scat
tered bones of pioneers left by the body removers. Many
bones were found while the ground was being broken for
the site of the new City Hall. Now its massive founda
tions stand as tombstones over the bits of skeletons that
were left there in the early seventies.

BUILDING BIG
CITY SKYSCRAPERS
THE high buildings of our great cities, and particularly of New York,
are constantly giving more and more justification to the term "sky
scraper." The structures which were marvels for their skyward
reach ten, or even five, years ago, now stand dwarfed, mere pigmies in
comparison to their gigantic neighbors. Year by year the buildings
have grown until we see stories ranging commonly in the twenties, and
reaching as high as twenty-five.
The highest building in the world is on the corner of Ann street and
Park Row, and is called the St. Paul building. Its height is 337 feet, and
the top story is the twenty-fifth. A fine balcony surrounds it near the
roof, and from it and from the great windows of the offices on the upper
floors a most impressive panoramic view of the city and its environments
is presented to the eye.
Far to the south, beyond the bay, and beyond the Narrows, and over
miles of ocean, loom up the heights of Navesink. Looking west, the ma.
Jestio Hudson, a broad highway that disappears among the hills in the
north, lies at your feet, and across it in the distance the eye rests upon
the blue outlines of the Orange Mountains. To the north, Broadway, filled
with seething life and movement, stretches away into the heart of the city,
until the view is cut off by Grace Church, which seems to stand at the
head of the street. On either hand, and over the East River, spanned by
the noble Brooklyn Brklge, is a sea of roofs, and almost directly at your
feet you look far down upon the Astor House and the postoffice; even the
spire of old Trinity does not reach your altitude.
But the surprising part of it all is not in the height of the buildings
themselves so much as in the possibility of constructing them by human

A burglar was one night engaged in the
pleasant occupation of stowing a good
haul of s\v:ig in his bag, when he was
startled by a touch upon his shoulder,
and turning his head, he beheld a ven
erable, mild-eyed clergyman gazing sadly
at him.
"Oh, my brother!" groaned the reverend
gentleman, "wouldst thou rob me? Turn,
I beseech you; turn from your evil ways.
Return those stolen gDods, and depart in
peace, for I am merciful, and forgive.
Begone!"
And the burglar, only too thankful at
not being given into custody of the police,
obeyed and slunk swiftly off.
Then the good old man carefully and
quietly packed the swag into another bag,
walked softly (.so as not to disturb the
slumber of the inmates) out of the house
and away into the silent night, for he, too,
was a burglar.

After all it was Little worse than the 1

OCCULT POWERS FOR
SECRET SERVICE.
IN discussing the signal and secret
service of our army in the war with
Spain Colonel Graham, a retired of
ficer who served his country in the
Civil War. has just expressed some
â : unique views which will.be of In
terest to others than those engaged. in
military affairs.
"In the first place," said the colonel,
lighting a fresh cigar and placing his
slippered feet comfortably on a chair,
-you know that one of the most im
portant things in connection with mod
ern warfare is gaining accurate infor
mation of the position and strength of
the enemy's forces. To accomplish
this, many Ingenious means have been
-uiployed. The spy system has serious
limitations, not to s-eak of the. risk to
life Involvedâ for in all countries a spy
is executed when caught. Captive bal
loons, cameras, sent- up kites, carrier
pigeons, have all been employed In the
service of securing and transmitting to
headquarters some information con
cerning the enemy. nut all these
'methods fail in - certain conditions. For
instance, our Government was for a
long time unrble to -learn the where
abouts of Cervera's fleet; : and- lack of
more definite information as .to .the
Spanish defenses of Santiago, no doubt,
caused us unnecessary loss of life in
the first engagements, i Now, I be
lieve ii possible to institute a secret
service hose operations would be ab
solutely unknown to the enemy,: involve
no risk to life or limb, and yet result
curing accurate information under
ail circumstances. As 1 said at first,
these views will seem extreme to some,
but "i ' have , Holy Writ, ,' secular history
and modern science on my side to sup
port the possibility of what I assert. ..
- "In looking up some matters, con
nected with the methods of warfare
among the ancient Hebrews I happened
to consult, among other books, the
Bible- a book," said the colonel, smil
ing and - knocking the ashes from his
cigar "which, I- dare say, is seldom
consulted by military officials general

Israel forestalled him. He naturally
concluded that there were Hebrew spies
among his forces. He called his ser
vants together and demanded to know
who was for the King of Israel One
of the number answered: 'None, my
lord, 0 king; but Elisha, the prophet
that is in Israel, telleth the kins of
Israel the words that thou speakest in
thy bed chamber. 1
'You will find this in Second Kings,
sixth chapter, twelfth terse. Now you
may say ihat this is an instance of spe
cial providence; that the prophet,
Blisha, was given this miraculous
power trom on hU:h for this especial
purpose. Hut I find that similar pow
ers h:ive been exercised by pagans, in
matters where we Bhould not think of
asserting any special divine dispensa
tion. Among the oracles of the Â§1
we find many instances of it. On one
occasion Croesus, King of Lydia, de
sired to test the powers of the oracle
at Delphi. lie sent messengers who
should ask on a certain .d:Â».y what the
King was at that lime doing. At the
time appointed, says Herodotus, the
King hit upon tie following to be done,
as ?.omethi'>f; which he supposed might
be difficult to detect and describe: Cut
ting up a tortoise and a lamb, he boiled
them together In a brazen vessel, which
alv> had a i'i?V"r of brass.
"Note the answer of the oracle," and
the colonel took up B volume of Hero
dotus from the table, and read as fol
lows: "I know the number of the
sands and the measure of the sea; I
know what the dumb would say; I hear
him who speaks rot. There comes to
me the odor of tortoise and lamb's
flesh, seething together in a brass ves
sel; beneath the flesh is brass; there is
also brass above."
Laying the hook down and .puffing
a moment at his cierar the colonel con
tinued: "Now. what kind of a power
is it that enables one thus to learn
what a certain individual is saying jn
his private chamber, or doing in his
own court? Is this power at all com
mon ?"
"Here is another instance of it. The
great philosopher, Pythagoras,
Bessed this mysterious power, If the
records of his life are true. On one oc
casion, when a certain ship was s a en
coming into port, some persons near
him expressed the wish that they might
possess the great treasure which they
believed to be on board the vessel.
Pythagoras auletly told them that the

with a single wrapper. A broken tile
will b? given them to play with. What
they do is not good, nor is It bad."
Further on in this delicious literature
Tuen found the teaching that the hus
band is heaven and the wife is earth,
and the attitude of a wife toward her
husband must be that of a subpect to
a prince.
Very little to fire ambition, indeed, is
there in "The Giris' Four Books," but
two of them were written by Em
;â :â¢â¢ sses, and perhaps that set the young
girl thinking and aspiring to the high
only thing on board was a corpse. Upon
subsequent investigation they learned,
much to their surprise, that this was
actually the case.
"Now I maintain," said the colonel,
shifting his slippered feet to ibe table,
"that the power which could ascertain
that there was a corpse on board that
ship, while the ship was yet afar off,
could just ns .easily ascertain how
many guns and men there were, for
instance, on one of Cervera'a ships
while the latter were yet in Santiago
harbor. It Is only a question as to
whether people in these days possess
the powers attributed to these an
cients; and, of course, I believe that
some do to a certain extent; and that
it can Be cultivated indefinitely. My
wife often tells me that some particular
individual is on the way to see me long
before he rings my bell. How docs she
get this Information? I don't know,
and she doesn't. Hut I believe it is a
hint of this same power which we read
of in connection with the prophets of
the Bible and the oracles of the Greeks.
I believe that with persistent training
and steady application to a particular
purpose this power would be made
available in military service.
"England discovered long ago that
in India the natives have means of
sending information without telegraphs
or wires, and with a 'need that pre
cludes the idea of couriers. I have read
of instances of this sort which put all
our scientific methods, to the blush. I
believe this power is used by natives
who have developed it by years of spe
cial training.
"I am not a Swedenborgian," said the
colonel, "but in reading some memoirs
of Swedenborg I ran across some re
markable instances of this same pow
er." Taking down from some shelves
an old book which the colonel said has
been long out of print, he read an ac
count which is fairly summarized as
follows:
Swedenborg was in Gottenburg,
three hundred miles from Stockholm.
On a Saturday night a great fire oc
curred in his native city. Swedenborg
described this fire, giving the facts of
Its origin, the time and place, and its
progress and termination, showing that
he possessed some strange power of
seeing or apprehending events at a
great distance. Subsequent dispatches
conclusively proved the accuruc" of his
statements.
"The authenticity of this wonderful
account is vouched for by the gfeat
German philosopher Kant," said the
colonel.
"No, I don't preter 1 to understand
how it is done." replied the colonel in
response to a question. "I do not at
tribute it to spirits, so-called, but to
some hidden faculty of the human

that the Hispano-American war has

MAKING THE TUNIC THAT ADVANCED HER IN FAVOR AND
WON HER IMPERIAL NOTICE
It was a great trip for the young
Tuen, this one forty-four years ago,
when with a beating of tom-toms and'
a "ood deal of other unnecessary fuss
she was escorted to the three-walled |
City of Peking, where, in the heart of i
the town, are set the Emperor's pal- j
aces. But it was a trip for which no
return ticket is ever issued. She knew |
that, once well inside the third wall,
she would never issue forth again, nor
ever behold more father or mother or
friends of the Viceroy's family.
From the royal harem, "the palace
of earth's repose," as it is called in
flowery language, no woman ever de
parts alive once she has entered, and
the Emperor himself rarely leaves the
splendid isolation of his palace and
gardens. Not that the prospect daunted
Tuen. In the golden cage she saw an
other opportunity, for she felt that it
was not her fate to "blush unseen,"
and her purpose never once faltered.
Once a secret is spoken it ceases to
be a secret â it is in the air, and the
beauty and wisdom of Tuen-Tson-Hsi
was soon discussed in the 'harem, so
by and by the "son of Huren" himself,
the Emperor, began to hear of it, and
naturally to be curious. He saw that
she was lovely, with a soft, olive com
plexion, and lips as red as the cherry
blossom, which Orientals love. As for
form, she carried herself like a Queen
â poor slave girl that she was â perhaps
it was all an idle boast of her father's
that the blood of Tartars flowed in his
veins, and the Tartars are the real
aristocrats of China. Having won the
Emperor by her beauty Tuen proceed
ed to hold him by the force of her men
tality. Never the sort of a person to
let opportunities slip, you may be sure
she had learned of affairs of state from
her friend the Viceroy and the visitors
to his household, and the Emperor was
charmed to find that she understood
pu^li happenings and the needs of the
commission, which terminated its la
bors in June last, will cause some
changes in the figures referring to the
African colonies, but -they will not be
forthcoming until some time in 1599.
The boundaries fixed by the Anglo-
French commission may be considered
as still uncertain, as the German Colo
nial Society, on June 28. protested
against them as "an infringement of
German rights."
Of all her colonial trade France does
the greatest amount with Algeria, the
largest item of importance being wine,
the aggregate being $19,410,731. The
j next item Is 458.343 head of sheep, val
! ued at $3,107,093. In point of population
St. Pierre and Miquelon, one of France's
American possessions, is the smallest
of all her colonies, and yet in the mat
ter of imports this little colony of only
i ninety-four square miles and only 6300
I population, ranks second to Algeria.
empire quite as well as many of his
official advisers, while he trusted her
infinitely more, believing her honest
and single in purpose.
Naturally the said advisers disliked
j the new favorite, or else they began to
j think the old '. nperor wiser than they
I had imagined, but what they were not
I prepared for was the obliging death
! of the Empress, and after the term
of courtesy mourning was over the
marriage of the Emperor with Tuen-
Tson-Hsi! Here was a thunderbolt.
The old Empress had been of the good
Chinese type, worshipful, and of af
fairs of state all unknowing. She had
left a son and heir, and died with a
sense of having done her duty accord
ing to Nue er Ching and "The Girls'
Four Books."
Tuen was different. The Emperor
was just old enough to be completely
swayed by his brilliant wife, clear
headed anu practical as she was. Vir
tually she became the ruler of the hii
mense empire, and when an indignant
statesman ventured to oppose her de
crees, as occasionally one of them
would be brave enough to â¢ do, Tuen
promptly ordered the offender s head
cut off, not .-guratively, but literally,
with a "short, sharp chop," and this
drastic measure soon squelched any
aetitve desire to criticize her policy or
her methodsâ it wasn't safe.
Bitter, indeed, was it to the average
Chinaman to feel that the real power
behind the ruler's throne was one of
the despised sex. Yet was Tuen mag
netic withal, and won people by her
force and charm, even when they had
rather not. Che was always tactful,
dearly as she loved power, and -minis
ters of state grew to respect her ability
even when they disliked the woman.
Then the old Emperor died in the full
ness of years and Tuen became dow
ager Empress, wiÂ£h a weak boy for
ostensibly reigning monarch.
Now did Tuen-Tson-Hsi get her real
innings. Already she had achieved
power througl the Emperor, and now
it was hers in very truth, for what
could a child King be but the most
I transparent of figureheads? Neither
did the shrewd woman exert herself to
prepare the young Emperor for his du
ties in reigning over the greatest â
numerically speaking â nation in the
world! She did not beat or abuse him;
she worked a more subtile injury, and
one for which there could be no swift
uprising against her. He was a weak
boy and she simply let him have his
I own way. She surrounded him with -
: luxury, with beauties of the ha-rem,
with idleness and dissipation. After
twenty-six years of this enervating life
! her step-son is the merest of spiritless
I puppets in her capable hands. He has
i never ruled, though he has had the
! name of ruler, and now the news comes
that the powerful old lady has done
what no one ever dreamed even she
j would dare to do â she has openly re
j lieved the Emperor of all power and
! all ministers are compelled to take their
S instructions directly from her, Li Hung
I Chang practically superseding the
Tsung-li-Yamen.
This is what the humble slave girl
has risen to by means of her beauty,
I cleverness and diplomacy, to be abso
j lute ruler over 600,000,000 of subjects,
and to have it said of her that she is
the Bismarck of China; that in state
craft there is not her equal in any
court in Europe!
People used to wonder why cunning
old Li Hung Chang struck his colors
si i close to the Emperor's dowager in
stead of to the Emperor; now the world
knows. He has always been more or
less of a favorite of hers, though being
a fiery-tempered and exacting old lady
she has more than once deprived him
of his honors and his decorations, his
! yellow silk jacket and his peacock
I feathers, only to become pacified later
j and to give those marks of favor back
I to the sly diplomat, who has worked
so much commotion of late, and who is
reputed to hr.\ sold his nation to Rus
sia. He stands in well with her and

MIRACLE OF LAVA CANYON.
THE Sheriff of Siskiwah County, Arizona, had a se
cret. He never told it to his best friend, but it was
never out of bis own mind. He was a physical cow
ard. A Bhot tired set his heart beating wildly, and
he turned sick at strife and carnage. Mis pulse
beats averaged 96 per minute and his heart turned
cold every time a summons for arrest was placed In his
binds He experienced a sensation of nervous dread each
time lie Biiung himself upon the back of his high-spirited
horse Every BUdden sound conveying presage of danger
thrilled him with fright. His disposition wan high-strung,
sensitive and unalterably timid.
â \mi yet "Rad" Conrad was known us the coolest and
most courageous Sheriff in this Territory. He had at
tained this reputation by daily and hourly struggle with
his whole moral force against his natural weakness. His
fear of dagger, great as it was. had beon subordinated to
a greater fear lest his falling be known. How to hide his
cowardice from the world was his one aim. With a cold
fear In hla heart he sought danger with the eagerness of
one who loved its every phase. Quiet, persistent, plodding
in his way; without any of the "Western dash and audacity
belonging to most men tn his occupation, he continually
t the closest risks and hazards, driven by an abnor
mal desire to appear fearless.
Lien who had no conception of the meaning of the word
"fear" sometimes stood apart, aghast at the man's dar
..ig, and admired him. Apparently without the slightest
excitement, almost sullen of aspect, he trailed desperate
criminals to their rendezvous, engaged in combat against
mighty odds and waged such relentless war upon despera
does and outlaws that his fame as an upholder of law and
order was sperad far and wide.
Radclif Conrad kept his secret well. Not a man in
Slskivvan County had ever seen him flinch from his duty,
and tales were told in saloons and camps of his intrepidity
and recKlessress.
There came one cruel day when the Sheriff was forced
to apply the whip to his tortured spirit with double force.
The town of Lava Canyon was built on a stretch of plain
sloping down to a river from the exit of a mountain gulch.
Within this gulch was a tangled wilderness. Two miles
back from town it converged to a fissure lialf a mile deep,
like a BWCrd-CUt cleaving the hills. The sides, for its
whole extent were inaccessible except to the rattlesnakes
thai made their dens among the bowlders. Within the
qi}^" of the Kulch, where the densely wooded sides began
to straighten to steeper angles, stood the white painted
cottage of Emmet Reed, the Postmaster, and leading
dealer in hardware, cutlery, arms and ammunition. Here,
(>â  side the mountain stream and among the moss-grown
rocks, played the juvenile Reeds â little more than rushes
In size â watched over more or less carefully by Boadlcea,
agtd 20, eldest daughter of the house.
To these confines, late one afternoon, came Arizona
Dan, worst man Jn the county, after breaking half a
thousand dollars' worth of mirrors and glassware in the
principal places of entertainment, and introducing: sundry
Bluga of lead into various citizens, to their great bodily an
guish. Dan was not too drunk to entertain a wholesome
fear of Rad Conrad, and it was his intention to conceal
himself until darkness should lend him cover to escape.
(>n being apprised of these events, the Sheriff of the
county, recognising his duty, prepared to effect Dan's eap
tore. A brave man in his place who properly estimated
the value of a pood citizen's life in comparison with the
Altai spark of a degenerate like Arizona Dan, as a further
ance nf the survival of the fittest idea, would have sum
moned a posse, and by moral force of numbers would have
secured the surrender of the offender without risk of
bloodshed. Radellff Conrad was not the man to do this.
He shunned all appearance of lack of courage, as he de
sired, in hi? heart, to shun the danger.
'â¢What arms did he have?" asked the Sheriff of some
men who had seen Arizona Dan's retreat to the gulch.
"Nary a one," said a saloon-keeper, who had suffered
from the fugitive's iconoclasm. "He left both his guns in
my place."
The Sheriff unbuckled his revolver and shoved it across
the counter.
"Keep that for me," he said. "I'll go and get Dan."
He passed slowly down the street, walking tn the direc
tion of the gulch, and the men gazed after him admiringly.
"Never knew what bein' afraid was, Rad never!" said
the mail carrier.
"He 'uz born that a-way," said the County Clerk. "A
man as ain't pot no skeer in him don't deserve no credit
fur havfn' sand. He wouldn't take his gun along, 'cause
Pan had left hls'n. With a creetur like Dan it pears to
me that's a leetle reckless. Dan overweighs Rad a matter
of twenty-five pound, the very least."
In the gulch things were as usual, to all appearance.
The little mountain brook that dashed down the steep
rocks purled in the deep shade, and sent out diamond
flashes where stray flecks of sunlight dived into it. and
the birds in the redwood treÂ«Â»s whistled away as though
there was no such unharmonious and degraded thing as
Arizona Dan somewhere below, trying to conceal his dese
crating presence. The little Reeds were at school, and
fiuch noises as might have been heard by that legendary
and overworked creature, the casual observer, were sylvan
and well attuned. A critic in sight-harmony would also
have found little to cavil at, unless his too fine-drawn
perceptions had deemed the aspect of Miss Boadicea Reed,
who sat negligently in a grapevine swing, too unslyph-like
for perfect accord.
Miss P.n;:dicea â called "Dicey" by her immediate fam
ily and friends, a diminutive evolved from their original
and arbitrary pronunciation of her name â souned a note
which may have been a dissonance, hut It had its true
power of accentuating the soft melody of the wood. A3
Bhe half reclined upon the giant vine, her freshly-starched
white muslin crackled about a form whose measurements
faltered not an Inch from the modern standard of perfec
tion. Her glossy black hair was arranged In the latest
fashion sl.Â« wr. in the most recently arrived ladles" maga
zine in Lava Canyon. Her features were clear cut and
regular; she had the eys of Melpomene, and the heart of
the ancienf British queen whose name she bore.
As Boadieea swung In the grape vine, some 300 yards
up the gulch from the house, she turned her gaze idly to
ward a thick clump of bushes, and saw an eye with a good
deal of red in the normally white portion of it looking at
her between the leaves.
She sat bolt upright on the vine, and, as it appeared to
he a man's eye, her hand, without any special volition of
her brain went to the knot of hair at the back of her head,
smoothed !â¦ a little and thrust In the pins more securely.
"Come out of there." she said.
Red-faced and heavy-eyed from drink. Arizona Dan,
hitching up his revolverless belt, shuffled his huge form
throuph the flexile branches of the bushes Into the path.
"Sh-sh-sh!" he said, his heavy face folding into a dull
smile Intended to be reassuring. "I ain't a-goin" to hurt
you, miss."
"Hurt me!" said Miss Reed, contemptuously, "I should
think not. What are you doing here?"
"Just a-layin' low, miss, and waltin' for night. Ter
see. I w.is on what j'ou might call a sort of spree, and
broke a plnss or two. Maybe somebody was hurt, too.
Thr whisky done it. A good lookln' young lady like you,
miss, wouldn't give the word on a man, now. I bet a
hoss."
Arizona Dan's lumbering attempt at compliment pro
duced no effect. Boadicea regarded him sternly with un
swerving-, disapproving eyes.
"You don't want to be loafinp around these dippings."
she said, substituting the local form or piirlanee for her
ordinarily more elevated style of conversation, as beinp
more worthy of her audience. "You are not afraid, are
you?" with infinite disdain.
"I ain't afraid," said Arizona Dan. shifting his feet
uneasily, "except of being took. I can't fight the whole
town."
"Is any one after you?"
"If they ain't, they will be. Rad Conrad's in town,
and "
Arizona Dan broke off. with an oath, and looked down
the steep pathway. "Here he comes now," he muttered.
Boadicea rose to her feet and peered over the tops of
the interveninr bushes. The Sheriff, unarmed. In a light
summer suit that set off to advantage his strong, grace
ful figure, was coming up the path with the sun striking
golden Hphts from his head of curly blonde hair. Boadl
eea looked upon him and loved.
When in ten paces of his man the Sheriff took off his
hat wlp;>d his brow with a silk handkerchief.
"Dan." he said. In an even tone. "I want you."
Arizona Dan drew a nine-Inch bowie knife from the leg
of his boot "Come and get me," he said, with a grin,
and a suggestive upward movement of bis right hand.
The old, well-known, nauseating, deathly, cowardly
physical fear crime upon the Sheriff as he saw the shining
blade held by the huge desperado he bad come unarmed
to capture. Hll pride and the wonderful moral puissance
that ground out courageous deeds from heart-sinking ap
prehension urped him forward another step. Arizona
Dan laup/icd a low. half-sober, big chilling lauph. So quiet
it was that the voice of the brook sounded in the Sheriff' s
ears like the derisive mockery of men at his poltroonery.
For nn< 1 Instant Radellff Conrad swung in the balance.
An all-pervading panic seized him, and the foot he lifted
to take a forward step weighed a hundred pounds. The
rustling of a branch to his right, above the path, drew
from him a swift glance, and he looked for ten .seconds
Into two dcrk eyes that seemed to flash some strange, ex
alting essence into his veins. A weight seemed loosened
Bomewhara within him. and he felt that he could hear it
fall down, down to unsounded depths. He looked at Ari
zona Dan and laughed low and joyously, as a child does
who has come upon a long-desired toy.
"Will you come?" said the Sneriff in a tone a bride
groom might have used to his bride.
"I'll cut your heart out. Rad Conrad," said Arizona
Dan. "If you come two steps nearer."
Boadicea, on the ledge above, rustled a little, and the
Sheriff, without looking up. smiled again. Arizona Dan
held his knife as one holds a foil, point outward, with his
thumb against the guard. The Sheriff crouched some
three inches like a cat. and seemed to pather himself to
gether with his weight balanced evenly on each foot. Ari
zona Dan stood still with his knife ready. Was Rad Con
rad fool ei-ough to attack him with his bare hands?
The Sheriff could have, shouted for joy. Like a flash
valor and audacious courape had come upon him. He felt
that he would never know fear again. Something had
passed into his blood that had made him a man instead
of the spurious being he had been. He felt the two dark
oyes above fixed upon him, but he kept his own upon Ari
zona Dan's
Heretofcre the Sheriff's exploits had been attended
by a fortuitous chance that brought him safely out of
thpmâ a chance just as blind and incomprehensible as that
which guard? the ways of children and drunkards. Now
he felt the caution, the indomitable intent to do coupled
with the prudence of the successful general that gives
bravery- Its value. Half a miracle had been accomplished.
The other half was to follow.
It must have been that Arizona Dan's nerves were
unstrung by his debauch, else when a small stone dis
lodged by Boadlcea's foot rattled down to the path at hla
side he would not have bestowed the advantage of turn
inp his head quickly to look. But he did so. and in an In
stant the Sheriff had his knife arm by the wrist, and his
other arm about his waist. Then Arizona Dan was filled
with surprise to feel the arm that held his knife slowly
twisting In spite of all his resistanceâ twisting outward,
until the tendons and muscles were cracking. The Sher
iff's hand was like a steel clamp and when the pain grew
unbearable Arizona Dan dropped the knife. When the

Sheriff heard It ring- on the rocks he released the wrist
suddenly and laid Ills left forearm across Dan's throat.
They were too doae tor blows, and there was little strug

She stopped suddenly. The Sheriff wÂ«s looking straight
into her eyes. She felt, for the first time, a strange heat
in her cheeks, and thought she must have fever. Her eyes
slowly dropped, for the first time, before another's. Her
tongue for the first time tripped and faltered.
"It'll be dark soon," began the Sheriff, and his voice
sounded to her far away like the wind in the pines; "you'd

trip to the head of Miles Canyon was
made in a shi t time and this great
problem confronted the travelers:
Through the canyon in two minutes or
over the mountain in two days? Of
course they debated this question for
a long time. That portion of JV3rÂ». Car
roll's letter that refers to this is as
follows:
EMPEROR FOR A NIGHT.
BARKT had often been told of his resemblance in
tare and voice to his Emperor, and had, indeed,
â¢"ound it a method of amusement for his friends
and himself, but he never dreamed that there
might be any danger from the mimicry.
Even Colonel Carolet, grave and methodical,
was surprised from his usual composure at a summons
from the Emperor, and when he presented himself a con
versation took place which will not be found mentioned
in the state annals or even hinted at on the pages of his
tory.
"I am going to honor you with my confidence in a cer
"Everybody told me not to go,
"The old captain who is put on guard
at the head of the rapids shook his
head. 'You will have to break the laws
if you go,' he said.
"I then found out, much to my sur
prise, that there is a law up there pro
hibiting women from going through the
rapids. This, of course, made me want
to go all the more.
"There were about twenty-five women
in the camp just above the canyon and
all begged and pleaded with me not to
go through the rapids. Some of them
shed tears, so earnest were they in
their entreaties. But I was determined
that if the rest of the party and the
boats went through the rapids I would
go too.
"But I was determined to go through
the rapids. '
"Again I resorted to my disguise, but
I guess the old man saw through it all
right enough.
"I put on a suit of slickers and pulled
my hat down over my eyes. Of course
my husband and the boys knew me and
grave me a seat in front. As the boats
are only allowed to carry so many I
had to do my share of the work. This
was paddling of the hardest kind.
Paddling for life in fact.
"We all crowded into the boat and
several men on shore held the sides
until just the right sweep of current
came along. Then they gave us a
shove and off we went, like a streak
of lightning it seemed to me.
"Before we started it was only nat
ural that I should have considered
what I was about to undertake. Ii
spent hours picturing to myself what
I would have to pass through. I made
the ordeal as bad as I could possibly
conceive it. But the actual trip was
not in the least as I had pictured it.
Where I had pictured wildly swirling
eddies we found a maelstrom.
"From the instant our boat left the
shore I had not a chance to look be
hind me. In some way I realized that
there was no turning back. No earth
ly power could help me now. We must
go through the canyon or die in the at-
tempt.
"Then the thought came to me that
perhaps I was on the brink of the
grave. For aught I knew two minutes
hence I would be lying drowned and
bruised beyond recognition on the
rocks at the foot of the falls. My
hand trembled. I almost dropped the
paddle. The sight of the seething wa
ters frightened me.
"Suddenly the boat seemed to give a
leap and an enormous black cloud
glided past me. A dash of icy water
flew in my face. A deafening roar as
of distant thunder filled my ears. The
air seemed to grow darker. We were
in the canyon and must flght for our
lives.
"Somehow this thought that we could
fight gave me strength. I forgot my
fears as soon as I realized that it all
depended on ourselves. If we handle*}
the boat properly and steered clear of
the rocks we would come out all right.
But a single misstroke of the paddles
or an instant's lack of vigilance meant
death.
"Then I began to paddle for dear
life, and began to realize what was
going on around me. I could see the
canyon walls sliding backward as if
some mighty hand were pulling them.
What progress we were making made
no impression on me. I devoted my
self to paddling the boat clear of the
rocks and keeping to my seat.
"We were pitched around in a dozen
different directions at the same time, it
seemed to me. Now we went up, now
down and then we swung sidewise, and
it took all our strength to keep the
boat under control. Water came
aboard in bucketfuls. In spite off my
oilskin suit I was drenched, but the
great exertion kept me from feeling
cold.
"Once we saw a patch of smooth
looking water and instinctively I felt
as if we must glide through it as slick
as could be.
"But this was the worst part of thÂ«
trip. Before I realized it there came
an awful bump. The boat lifted up
on one side and the waters churned
and foamed around the other. We were
on a rock. .
" 'Push her off, quick!' yelled one of
the boys behind me.
"Just how I did it I don't know, but
I got my paddle in just the right place
and with all my strength pus!.ed our
boat clear. But we were sidewise in
the stream and Just ahead a wave
rolled about five feet high. If we
didn't strike it bow on we were
doomed.
"Oh, how hard I worked. I paddled
until my arms were sore and my hands
blistered. But we struck the wave
just right and instantly were raised
high in the air. Then we dropped
down, down. It seemed as if we were
going into the bowels of the earth. I
almost lost my breath and a sick feel
ing came over me.
"With a mighty struggle I overcame
this and got to work axuln. Now we
struck a place where the current
seemed to come from the bottom with
a boiling motion. We were surround
ed by foam and had to paddle for our
lives. It was scarcely possible to
keep our boat head on.
"Then I began to feel tired. It
Beemed to me as if we had been In that
seething swirl of waters for a liretlme.
I had no idea of where we were or how
near we were getting to the end. Then
I reconciled myself to go on paddling
for ever and ever.
"Suddenly the motion seemed to
con.se-, and in a moment there came a
grating sound. 'What was that?' I
asked myself.
"But before I could find out I heard
the sound of a rifle and a mighty cheer
from a multitude of people standing
near by.
"I looked back in the boat and saw
J â with his watch in his hand.
" 'How long were we?' some one
asked; and his voice seemed to come
from far off.
" 'A minute and forty-five seconds, â¢â¢
J â answered, and I knew that we had
made the trip in safety.
"Then I was happpy. I was glad that
I had made the trip. I wouldn't have
missed it for a thousand dollars. But
I wouldn't take the trip again for a
million."

first command, I require absolute obedience.
"I have heard of a young man in your regiment who
Is said to resemble me somewhat, but whose voice is pe
culiarly like mine."
Colonel Carolet grasped. Was it possible, that the Em
peror could hold him responsible for such a thing? He
could only stammer Incoherently:
"Why, your majesty, Iâ heâ " . .
"E loiiÃh, enough!" said the Emperor, impatiently.
Waving fcJa hand. "You need not answer, as I know that
it is the m.th. For certain reasons, with which you havo
nothing to do, I require some one to personate me in an
adventure ir. which there may be some danger. I have
heard of this young man, and I saw him yesterday for
the puroose of Judging as to his fitness for the service that
I need. If you can assure me that he is braveâ"
"As a lien, sire."
"And loyal â "
"As death, sire."
"And can be silentâ"
"As the grave, sire."
"He will do. Nothing further must be known or the
affair. Nothing more must be investigated. If he or any
one makes but the slightest move in that direction he will
sign his death warrant."

"With his life, sire. Butâ" . ,â
"Thut v ill do," said the Emperor, rising. .J'You will
bring him yourself this evening to the little wicket at the
end of tho garden. No other soul in the world will know
this, remember, but myself, the young man and you. 1
bid you good-day, colonel/ â¢ , .
With military promptness they reached. the palace tnat
night, rod the heavy gate in the western wall swung
softly open the instant of their approach.
The colonel delivered the young man over to the
charge of an unseen watcher on the other side and de
parted. And JSaret beard the gate again closed and
looked; then in the heavy darkness, his hand was grasped
by another, and he felt that he was gently but nrmly
drawn forward, though not a word was spoken by his
unknown guide.
Closely skirting the courtyard they reached a couple
of stone steps. A massive, unguarded floor swung softly
inward, giving entrance to a stone passage, narrow and
damp, where a tiny lantern on the floor only made the
surrounding darkness more visible.
A narrow stair led to a smaJl hall, and, pressing a
spring to the left, his guide drew him into a brilliantly
lighted ro.rn. The sudden glare so dazzled the young sol
dier that be did not at tirst perceive his companion. wh<\
putting aside his cloak, had seated himself in a deeply
cushioned chair near tho rire.
"Sire!" he stammered. "Your pardon. Iâ l did not
know Tâ the honor â "
"There, there, my friend." said the Emperor kindly.
"You are to do me the honor to-night. I can depend on
your fidelity, your obedience and silence?"
"To the last drop of my blood, sire."
"That will do," said the Emperor, smiling. "They may
all be needed. In an hour 1 shall leave this room, to be
gone for Iwo hours or more. I had thought of sending
you in my place, but prefer to go myself. You will re
main here till I return."
Baret waited.
"Is that all, sire?" he asked blankly.
"That is all, except that on your absolute obedience to
my orders will depend your life and my happiness. For
the first hour or two there may be interruptions. Some
one m.iy knock or ask admittance. To all. alike you are
to refuse an entrance, using such words as I shall tell you.
After 12 oÂ»* 1 you are not likely to be disturbed, and you
may jven sleep on mv bed in the room yonder if you
wish.
"Yo'.ir voice, in answering all inquiries.", he continued,
"must be absolutely calm and undisturbed. Not a tone,
not a syllable, must betray agitation. I am never agi
tated."
'I un U-rstand, sire. lam to personate â " â ".
"You understand nothing, sir, but what T say to you,"
said the Emperor, rising, and his eyes flashed angrily.
Baret bowed in silence, and the Emperor, whose ar.ger
cooled as suddenly as it had rison, save him his hand to
kiss before he entered the bedroom.
When he reappeared his dress was so changed that
Baret stared at the- disguise in amazement.", and in turn
the Emperor gazed at him piercingly, searchingly. Ap
parently Battened at last, he motioned to Baret to enter
the bedroom before he rang the bell.
WThen the servant came he was back in the inner room
and called to the man from there.
"I 'ira mt to be disturbed again to-night for anything,
Laurent. You understand? For anything! Give orders to
that effect instantly. Andâ stay. You may return first
with a light supper; I may need It before I sleep.
The door closed softly behind the servant, and the Em
peror turned to the young soldier, who stood near him in
respectful silence.
"The supper is for you. Baret." he whispered. "And
before â " }--o, I wish you to speak to Laurent, that I may
determine 1 your coolness. When he brings the dishes, say
from within this room: 'That will do for to-night. Lau-.
rent.' "
The ynuncr man hoped his voice did not sound so oddly
in the ear* cf the Emperor as it did in his- -own when he
repeated ihe words, with an almost involuntary' imitation
of the slight drawl sometimes heard in the tones of the
ruler of the empire.
The servant's steps echoed on the marble floor and died
away into silence before the Emperor fastened the door
behind him. Then, taking a soft hat and drawing his
cloak about him. he said:
"I shall be home at 3 â perhaps."
And. placing his linger to his lips, he disappeared
through the secret panel.
To be an Emperor, even for a few hours, was not such
a bad thing, thought Baret as he looked about him. The
many luxuriesâ massive hangings, richly embroidered
with the Imperial emblem, the curious tapestries on every
side, the furniture and fine tabinetsâ all deeply impressed
him.
There was a noise at the outer door of the anteroom
where r.ii!T- ( >nt slept. It was repeated again and again.
"Suppose some one should insist on admittance? Sup
pose the Empress, whom no one would dare deny, should
demand an audience?"
Baret stood near the door as he heard Laurent, at last
aroused from sleep, talking: to the newcomer.
"A thousand pardons, my lord. To see the Emperor to
night, since he has ordered me to admit no one, you
would have to walk over my body."
"Tut-tu.-! What nonsense!" said the other, with vexa
tion in Ms tones. "I had vowed to see him before he slept
but have It your own way now. I shall not fall to report
your in.-nl-nce to the Emperor. I shall be here at day
break. I must see him before he rises."
One! Founded from the tower, and Baret's eyes were so
heavy that he would willingly have settled himself in the
deep chair beside the dying fire, had not a thought sud
denly .aroused him.
What !f a snore should disturb Laurent, sleeping in the
outer room!
"What could he do to banish sleep! Had the hours of
night over teen so long? He tried to read a hook of old
romances, but they bade fair to serve as a sleeping potion-
One! two! chimed as he walked, and three was near its
stroke. wln>n a voice was heard in the distance The chal
lenges of the sentinels ranirbuck and forth. Heavy foot
steps an'l the clanging of sabres sounded rrom the court
yard, coming nearerâ nearer.
Again the calls, and a large door swung open, letting in
a tumult of voices that echoed along the high corridor
Had anything happened to the Emperor? Heaven forbid!
But If this were so!
The big drops of fear stood on the forehead of the man
who had faced death a score of times unmoved. He crept
to and listened breathlessly at the door leading to the
room whpre the faithful Laurent slent. â¢
Laurences sleep had evidently agafn been disturbed,' aa
he heard 1 lie servant's voice and that of another.
"I cannot wake the Emperor, my lord. He gave me
particular orders that he was not to be disturbed before
morning. He has had some bad nights lately, and is now
sleening o.uietly."
"But, my man," insisted the other, "you do not under
stand. \V> must see him. or. at any rate, find out if he is
in bed and safe. When did you see him?"
"At U o'clock, my lord."
The newcomer walked about impatiently. In a few
minutos he retreated to the lower hall, apparently to con
sult with his companions. Hastily returning, he said,
quickly and firmly;
"My fnod Laurent, we will hold you safe from all
blame, but we must know if the Emperor is asleep in his
bed or not. To tell you the entire truth, a report has been
sent to the minister that a wounded man, who bore a
marked resemblance to the Emperor, was seen about half
an hour a.go in the outskirts of the city."
"But the Emperor said â besides, my lord, no one has
passed hero since he gave me the order. But if you think
It at all possibleâ "
It is the time of waiting that the soldier fears. The
hour for action steadies the nerves even of the coward.,
and the rrnve Baret felt muscles and nerves grow as firm
as steel and his brain clear and vigilant.
Thoughts of the possible fate of the Emperor, and the
only too cure fate of himself if the report was true, darted
through his mind with wonderful quickness.
Quickly passing through the curtained recess, he threw
himself on the bed, as a low knock was heard. Twice,
thrice, ';o allowed it to be repeated before he called out,
in a drowsy tone of annoyance:
"What is the trouble? I said I was not to be disturbed."
"Thank heaven! You heard him, my lord' He waS
very tirel."
Laurent's voice was trembling still with the relief from
a terrible fear.
"I asK your pardon, sire." He called again. "There has
beenâ we feared something had happenedâ"
"DisMr'-y me again at your peril. Laurent " said the
drowsy tone of the mock Emperor, interrupting him.
Then, raising his eyes. Baret saw the true- Emperor
standing in the doorway just as he had seen him last with
his fir,er.->r to his lips.
Bar.?t sprang to hi? feet, but a gesture cautioned
silence, and both waited in patience till they heard th^
steps cl to away in the distance, and Laurent again closed
the outer floor.
"I hope you have some knowledge of surgery, Baret. I
have met vith an accident." His eyes twinkled. "There
was a moment when I feared I could not keep my appoint
ment with you."
When the wounded arm was bandaged the EmDeror
himself conducted the soldier to the wicket, and Baret
found the faint gleams of dawn casting a dim light
through the streets.
â¢ â¢â¢*â¢â¢â¢â¢
Perhans it was as well that he never knew how the
Emperor had spent his leave of absence. That at mid
night. !n an unoceunied house in an isolated part of the
rlty, two men had fought a duel to the death, with only
the light of two poor candles to guide their aim.
The poorly dressed man. who was the only one to leave
the house, entered the wicket gate of the palace two
hours later, having made a long detour to avoid the pa
trols. For once his vanity had almost received a check.
Two days after the incident narrated above Colonel
Carolet received a paper appointing Baret a captain of the
imperial chasseurs in Africa.WRECKED with the WHALERS
IN NORTHERN ICE PACKS.
When the Orca, one of the vessels of the whaling fleet ice-bound in the
vicinity of Point Barrow, left San Francisco in March, 1897. she carried on
her rolla the name of Eugene Hubert Johnson. Although rated as an able
seaman, Jc/hnson is well i-ducated and of more than ordinary intelligence.
He has led a seafaring life for the ]>; st ten years, and has sailed in almost
every clime; but the trip just tenn.nated was his first experience on a
whaler and his first visit to the Ante seas. He declares emphatically that
it will be his last.
Here is Able Seaman Johnson's story of his adventures on the wrecked
Orca, and incidentally that of several other vessels of the whaling fleet,
from the standpoint of the forecastle.
VAILIMA,
the honjs of
Robert Louis Stev
eosoo, where the Klnq
fell sIcK-
SOME time during the month of
March, ISS7, I noticed in one of
the San Francisco papers that
able seamen were wanted for a
whaling voyage. As I hail been
ashore several weeks, and conse
quently had in i money, I went to the
place named in the advertisement, and
after a talk with the plausible agent I
shipped with Captain Sherman of the
Orca.
All of us shipped on a lay. In fact
everybody on a whaling vessel, except
the engineers, ships on the same propo
sition. Sometimes it is a paying plan,
but more often it is just the opposite.
In the articles signed by me each able
seaman was to receive one barrel of oil
out of two hundred and one pound of
bone from a similar number of pounds.
The oil was valued at 20 cents a gallon
and the bone at $1 50 a pound, though
their market valu.- varies.
My order for $40 advance was pay
able twenty-four hours after we left
port by the company to my order. I
Boon found, however, that I was ex
d to make use of it only in baying
my outfit of clothing. I was marched
oft to Shipping Agent Levy's in charge
of one <>f the Orca's officers, and was
never left to myself until 1 had spent
the last dollar for which my order
called. For flannel shirts which are
usually sold for 80 or 90 cents I was
compelled to pay $3, for a $3 oilskin I
gave up nearly $S and everything else
was in the same proportion.
Then I was escorted to the Orca,
which lay in the bay, and for the first
time in my sea experience 1 had an op
portunity to inspect a whaler at close
range. She was bark rigged, with aux
iliary steam power, and measured about
500 tons, and altho-ugh every loot of
her deck was incumbered with whaling
apparatus and supplies waiting to be
Btowed l-f-low I could see only dirt and
grime from the forecastle to the taff
rail aft.
It took us about three weeks to make
Unalaska and we were busy from the
time we lost sight of the California
coast astern erf us until we reached
Unalaska in preparing the whaling
tackle and getting our lines ready for
codnsbing. At the same time we
worked the ship watch and watch.
When 1 we were within twenty miles of
our first port we dropped anchor in or
der to catch a supply of fresh fish.
We put out three boats, each with
six men at the lines, and at the end of
four days we had caught nearly 2000
pounds of cod. Some of these were
eaten just as they came from the
â¢water, but the bulk of them were salt
ed down for us.,- later in the season.
Let me say right here that after the
first few days we never saw anything
but the heads of our Bah. The latter
were made into stews and soups and
served to us in the forecastle, while the
bodies went to the cabin mess.
We lay around Unalaska for several
days, and then, toward the end of
April, we started off for the Bering Sea
in search of whales. On the fourth day
out -I was sleeping soundly in my bunk
when suddenly a grinding, bumping
noise aroused me in a jiffy and sent me
scurrying to the deck. Just forward
of our bow I could see, as far as the
eye could reach, a vast field of broken
ice, into which the Orca was en
deavoring to push her way.
After an hour of this work Captain
Sherman decided to make no further
effort to get through. So for the next
fortnight we drifted slowly with the
ice. We killed a number of young seals
while in the ice, and they made a very
palatable dish when boiled with dum-
Finally we got clear of the ice and
made for St. Lawrence Isldnd, and
traded with the natives for three or
four days. They offered walrus tusks,
bone, and skin garments in exchange
for flour, tobacco, tinware, calico and
guns and an old whaleboat, worth al
most nothing to the ship, was readily
exchang-d for bone worth $1000. Almost
every whaler carries one or two old
and discarded boats on the trip to th*
north, and the natives snap them up
at fabulous prices. This trading, I
should explain, is mostly carried on by
the captain and his officers. The sea
men have no capital on which to trade
except spare tobacco and an occasional
or under-garment, but to the
Ships' officers the trading is an impor
tant feature of their lay.
After this we returned to the ice, and
here we killed our first whale. Al
though it was the smallest one taken
by us during the next few months, it
yield.-.] 2000 pounds of bone and 100
barrel? ( ,f o {[. A day or two later we
took our Becond whale, and then we
put in at Indian Point, on the Russian
side, where v,- traded for furs, deer
skins, bone and ivory for some time.
When our trading stock was exhaust
ed we ! to Port Clarence to take
on provisions and coal. The company
has a supply post at this point, and
at that timp the Government reindeer
station was maintained there. 7h>>n
we put to the northward again, 'his
time heading for Cape Smyth. Wo
reached there about the Ist of Septem
ber.
All this time we were on the look
out for whales, meeting with success
:t times, and by the middle of Sep
tember our captain folt justified in
.starting for Point Harrow, North
ern Alaska, a point that would mark
the bpginning of our journey home.
At Point Barrow we found \h<- whal
ers Jessie H. Freeman, the schooner
Rosario, the Belvedere and th" Alex
ander, and all of these reported fair
catches. We remained here twelve
days, amusing ourselves by "gam
ming," or exchanging visits from ship
to ship, and then we spent three days
in chopping, sawing and blasting our
way through the ice to reach open
water. It was very hard work, and
we were well nigh worn out when we
got through. Then we found that we
had broken our rudder pintles in back-
Ing into the ice, as we were forced to
do occasionally, and so we went tq

AMONG NATIVE SURROUNDINGS.
Cape Smyth, where we repaired them.
When we left this point all of us
from the captain down were rejoicing
at the prospect of returning to civiliza
tion. We little realized the dangers
and hardships that lay ahead of us.
We had been steaming along through
the Ice for two days without much dif
ficulty, the whalers we had found at
I Niint Barrow nearly always in sight,
when early one morning our course was
checked. The ice had thickened and
crowded ahead of us to such an extent
that we could not budge a foot.
We were caught in the ice floes.
Within the next two hours we were
brought to realize that we could neither
turn about nor steam ahead. Great
masses of ice, in the meantime, were
hurled against the hull of the Orca,
jarring and shaking h^r from stein to
stern. Our situation became desper
ate.
Captain Sherman consulted for a mo
ment with his officers, and then the
cry, "All hands on deck to abandon
nhip!" was shouted in our ears.
It had all come about so quickly that
I was stunned. I had scarcely any
thing to lose, but it seemed a dreadful
thing to leave for good the stuffy little
forecastle, where we had made our
home for so many months. And yet
we were fortunate to be able to find
a place of refuge aboard the other ves
sels of the fleet which lay in the open
water a few miles distant.
We were permitted to take with us
only the clothing we had on our backs,
and an extra coat and a blanket, and in
less than an hour from the issuing of
the order we were on the ice. We made
our way carefully to the Belvedere and
the Freeman, and were divided up
equally among the two. Although the
crews of these vessels had but little
space to spare they made us welcome,
and the officers of the Freeman, to
which I was assigned, gave us every
thing we needed in the way of cloth
ing. It turned out that Captain Sher
man was wise in abandoning the Orca.
She was crushed in the next day and
went down stern first. The Freeman
and the Belvedere, as soon as the Orca
disappeared from view, steamed away
in the direction of Sea Horse Island.
Before we had made fifty knots the
Freeman was caught in thin ice, and
although In my own opinion we might
have made clear of it Captain Porter
ordered his crew to abandon her.
Then we all took to the Belvedere,
which had managed to keep in the
open, and for three days we hung
about the Freeman, hoping that she
would drift free.
It has been charged that members of
the Freeman's crew set her afire as she
lay in the ice. but this is not true. 1 A
Norwegian, whom wo knew only as
Long John, told us afterward that he
had been pent over to her to get cer
tain papers from the cabin. He said
that in searching through the cabin he
had dropped a lighted lanrn and that
this started the me that destroyed her.
This man. Long John, as we knew him,
was employed by Charles Brower, the
trader, at Cape Smyth. A number of
these stories about burning the vessels
and getting insurance floated about all
the time.
After the burning ">f the Freeman her
captain and the captains of the Orca
and the Belvedere, all of them being
quartered at the time on the latter ship,
sent a runner to Cape Smyth for dogs
and sleds. Brower, the Cape Smyth
trader, sent them at once, and ninety
two of us started off for his station.
We were four days on the trip, and
had nothing to eat during that period
save a little hard bread and tea. But
the prospect of again getting under
shelter spurred us on, and we reached
Cape Smyth in good health and fair
spirits.
Here we were put In a warehouse,

number, and we never left It until we

were rescued by the Bear.
When Dr. Call and Lieutenant Jarvis
! of the relief expedition sent by the Qov
j eminent reached us, six months later,
j we were in a pitiable condition. We
| had slept, week in and week out, on
the bare floor; the structure itself was
poorly built and in no way excluded the
bitter cold and nipping winds, and our
! food was of the coarsest kind and cx
i ceedlngly scant.
For the first two months we were
given a small bit of bread and a piece
; of tainted salt meat twice each day, al
, though this menu was added to by a
little tea in the morning and coffee at
; night. Later on, when it was feared
| that scurvy would break out among us,
i we had beans, peas and boiled salt fish

hie draws lots of tribute in his owr> country and a big salary here.
FOR the past three weeks a real
live Prince, and a wealthy one
at that, has been in this city,
and, strange to say, no Ameri
can beauty has flung herself
and fortune at his feet in the
vain hope of herself becoming a Prin
cess. This, however, is accounted for
by the fact that the identity of the
Prince is not generally known.
This Prince is by name Muly All Sidi
Hmad Omossa, and is one of the clev
erest tumblers with the Tow-Zoon-In
Arabs at the Orpheum.
To tell his story, one must first in
troduce Hassan Ben Ali, who brought
the Tow-Zoon-In Arabs all the way
from far-off Arabia to San Francisco.
This same Hassan Ben Ali brought to
this country the first Arabian acrobats
and gunspinners ever in America.
That was years ago, and he has been
in this sort of business ever since.
\ears ago he came to England as a boy
'in an English ship. In London he
joined a troupe of acrobats and a few
years later he struck out in the busi
ness for himself and toured both Eu
rope and America. He knew that he
had seen acrobats in his native coun
try who could excel anything he had
ever seen in Europe or America. But
how to get them permission to leave
their homes in Arabia was the ques
tion that puzzled Hassan Ben Ali, but
not for long, as he is a resourceful fel
low. He hit upon an idea and started
ill dice for Arabia.
He traveled to the interior and call
ing the various chiefs around him he
propounded this question to them:
"These Christians keep sending their
missionaries over here to convert us;
why not give them a dose of their own
medicine by sending a few missionaries
over to America to convert its people
to Mohammedism?"
This phase of the missionary ques
tion had never dawned upon the fol
lowers of the prophet and they asked
time to think it over. Next day the
chiefs assembled in council and Hassan
Ben All addressed them further on the
subject. It was the unanimous opin
ion that the Christians ought to be con
verted, and Hassan Ben Ali was in
structed to pick out his missionaries.
That was just the point he was work
ing for.
He addressed the assembled chiefs
and plausibly told them that when the
Christians assembled for worship they
always had some amusement to attract
the people. The Christians attracted
their congregations by singing and
playing on musical Instruments, and
if they were to be attracted to Mo
hammedanism it would be through some
novel entertainment. If the Chriatian
not been for him we would have
starved to death.
Dr. Call and Lieutenant Jarvis, as
soon as they came among us, set to
work to better our condition. They
divided us into three classes, according
to our physical state. A third of us
were removed to a school building,
some were put in a place adjoining
Brower's store, while those who were in
the best condition were made more
comfortable in their old quarters. Bet
ter food and medical attention soon
brought us around, so that when the
rescuing Bear made fast to the ground
ice off Cape Smyth, about August 1,
we were fairly well prepared for a sea
trip.
As a result of my eighteen months in
the whaling business, working cm a lay,
I received about eight pounds of whale
bone. My shipmates were put ashore
at Seattle, turned adrift, in fact, nearly
all of them penniless and with nothing
in the world to show for the perils they
had encountered except the threadbare
and almost worthless clothing they
wore. What has become of them God
only knows. If they had been landed
here in San Francisco their chances for
employment would not be so bad.
A few of the men, some of them who
had been whaling in the Arctic seas for
ye.irs, had carefully preserved orders
given them from time to time, and
these were enabled to cash them when
would not listen to the gospel of his
own religion unless some side enter
tainment was furnished, he certainly
would not listen to the words of the
prophet. The chiefs saw the force of
the argument and told Hassan Ben Ali
MUHLY ALI SIDI MAD OMOOSSA, PRINCE OF ARABIA AND CIRCUIT TUMBLER.
BURIAL OF MALIETOA
KING OF SAMOA.
SAMOA, August 23, 1898.â 1n the
large banqueting hall of desert
ed Vailima Samoa's King lay
a-dying.
More than two and a half
years before another King had
yielded up his breath within those
walls; a king whose scepter was a pen,
they were put ashore. But there were
not more than eight or ten who had a
dollar or anything of value to their
name. As for myself I sold the bonp
I had clung to so long for about $14 and
with the proceeds came to this city. So
after eighteen months of work and
peril I landed in the city with what I
started â nothing.
It was my first whaling trip. It will
be my last.
to pick out his own missionaries. This
was just what he had been leading up
to, and he chose all acrobats.
In Arabia a young man practices
acrobatic feats just for the fun of the
thing and to amuse his neighbors. They
whose charm subjugated all the Eng
lish-speaking globe. But he had owned
another and a higher power than that
of the pen, a transcendent gift of sym
pathy which overlept barriers of race
and custom.
Robert Louis Stevenson, the Sa
moan's "Tusitala" par excellence, is
the one white friend whom the natives
feel to be closer than a brother; with
their fervent, traditional belief in
spiritual presence, they hold that Ste
venson's love is still with them in th( ir
hour of need.
Thus it came that when King Malie
toa lay sick unto death his thoughts
turned, not to his own race and kin,
but to the white man his people had so
loved. Common report had often
classed Stevenson with Malietoa's ene
mies; his avowed sympathy for the ex
iled Mataafa led to the supposition that
he lacked sympathy for Mataafa's en
throned rival. Malietoa knew better,
knew that the white man sought only
the good of the Samoan race when he
deemed a chief who was no German
puppet the best occupant of the throne.
Tusitala loved Samoa and the Sa
moans with the strong love of the
white man. Tusitala had passed into
the Spirit Land; to him a Samoan's
thoughts must instinctively turn when
the Spirit Land loomed near.
When the doctors pronounced science
at fault and spoke of p. change to
mountain air as the one possible chance
of cure, Malietoa smiled the sad, wist
ful smile which had become habitual
to him. "Take me to Tusitala's," he
said. In vain those of his own race
offered hospitality, in vain the homes
of high chiefs were placed at his serv
ice. "I would be with Tusitala," he
persisted feebly. "Take me to Vai
lima."
And to Vallima they bore him.
For two days he lay on his mattress
in that empty hall, evoking memories
of the past. For two days he lay strug
gling with the fever while Tusitala's
tomb flung its shadow from the moun
tain top and Tusitala's spirit hovered
near his Samoan brother. On the third
day the fever gained strength, and the
spirit of the white King of Letters
beckoned to the spirit of the brown
King of the Isles. Malietoa heard and
closed his tired eyes. Life had dealt
harshly with him; it would be sweet to
pass out on his canoe to Tusitala.
"Have you no wish to express; will
you not name a successor?" tenderly
asked Mr. Gurr, the natives' advocate
and friend, the man who more than
any had known the inner life of the
Vailima household.
Malietoa's sad smile was his only
answer. Why should he name a suc
cessor, thereby adding to the troubles
of his beloved Samoa? He had suffi
ciently contributed to her dissensions
while living; he would leave no legacy
of strife.
So through that long Sunday, the
24th of August, King Malietoa peace
fully lay a-dying where Stevenson nad
died; his only sorrow the absence of
his daughter in far Fiji.
On the Monday, at dawn, medical
skill gave out and the approaching end
was announced. Then Malietoa's
mourners arose and girded up their
loins. It was well to seek dying com
mune in the shadow of Tusitala's tomb,
but it were not well to die there. A
never think of performing their feats
for money. Of course a few excel and
are regarded with pride by the tribe.
Each tribe usually has one young man
who excels all the others, and Hassan
Ben Ali requested the chief of each
tribe to send his best acrobats. They
did so and these so-called missionary
acrobats formed the first tribe of Ara
bian acrobats brought to America.
They were a novelty and took well.
However, as they learned to speak
English they discovered Hassan Ben
Ali's ruse, and they made a vigorous
Arabian protest for something more
than board and clothes out of the $400
a week Hassan Ben Ali was being paid
for them.
A split among the troupe followed
Samoan King must be gathered to his
fathers under his own Samoan roof,
With wailing and lamentation they
raised the dying monarch on his mat
tress and bore him along the "Road of
the Grateful Hearts," which commem
orates Tusitala's good deeds; thence on
to Apia and to the royal suburb of
Mulinuu. There they laid him, jnot in
the wooden house built for him by for
eigners, but in his own thatched dwell
ing with its adjoining graves.
And in the eventide Malietoa was
gathered to his fathers.
For two days he lay in state, en
wrapped in native siapo and adorned
with flowery wreath and cross contri
buted by "papalangi" friends. For two
days, while white politicians wrangled
over questions of precednce and suc
cession, Malietoa's native court laid its
head in the dust, mourning and chant
ing, and enumerating in well turned
oration the virtues of the royal spirit
which had passed over in its canoe.
For two days Malietoa's subjects
and some who had not acknowledged
his supremacy came on pilgrimage
bearirig their funeral gifts of fine mat
and roll of siapo and green baskets of
fresh food. The funeral meats were
baked and eaten, the watch fiFes were
lighted, and the waterway was kept
clear, lest the canoe of the dead should
pass to and fro. For the careless
footfall of the traveler, the sound of
his paddle or his voice in laughter and
song must not disturb the spirit seek
ing its long home.
On the third day the white residents
of Apia laid aside their differences and
joined their brown brethren, honoring
in death him to whom in life they had
given scanty honor. Mulinuu. was
thronged with visitors when the bear
ers came forward and carried their
dead King from his thatched home to
that othÂ°r "sandalwood house" which
was to be his abiding place. By his
own wish the dead was buried, not
with his fathers, but at the extreme
point of that Mulinuu, where he had
held his mock court, and thither his
chiefs bore him with slow, cadenced
step and averted head. Proud and
stately, in their stiff kirtl^s of fine mat
ting and their girdles of living green,
the King's chief brother one of the.ir
number, they reckoned as blue-blooded
ancestry as him whose form they car
ried, not in the canoe of olden days,
but in the somber box Introduced "by
the white man.
The white man's box was lowered
into a Samoan grave, lined with pieces
of white coral; wrappers of native
siapo, rich in texture, carefully de
signed and painted, concealed the for
eign coffin, while under and over it
were piled the large fine mats; those
precious heirlooms woven by the deft
fingers of dead Samoan women.. Above
were laid two of nature's tombstones,
enormous slabs of white coral, which
completely hid the grave from view.
Then with tears and sobs, with croon
ing chant and beating of the breast,
the mourners turned their faces home
ward and Malietoa, the white man's
puppet, slept with the native honors
which enshrouded his ancestors.
Slept in his coral bed, with the blue
waters of the coral-studded lagoon lap
ping his grave.
But his spirit communed with that
of Tusitala on the mountain top.
ROSE DE BOHEME.
and Hassan hastened home for more
Arabs. He reported great progress in â¢
the conversion of Christians and told
of the great crowds that came to see
the Mohammedan missionaries. He got
another troupe and years laier still an
other. Finally there came a day of
reckoning and Hassan Ben All had to
account to the chiefs of the Arabian
tribes for his conduct.
Now, considering his day and genera
tion, Hassan Ben All is as wise a man
as ever came out of the East. During
all the years he had maintained a close
friendship with Prince Ali. the favorite
son of the great Mohammedan chief,
Sidi Hmad Omossa, to whom all the
tribes of Morocco and the Great Desert
pay tribute. Every time he returned
to his native land Hassan Ben Ali car
ried in his train many useful if not
costly presents for Prince Ali. Field
glasses, Colt's revolvers, a repeating
rifle, a watch and trinkets for personal
adornment were all of almost inestim
able value to Ali, prince of the desert.
When the day of reckoning came
Hassan Ben Ali's stanchest friend was
Prince All, and the inquisitive chiefs
were promptly told that if they dared
to interfere with Hassan Ben Ali and
his plans they would be made to pay
double tribute to Sidi Hmad Omossa,
and furthermore not a member, of any
of the rebellious chiefs' tribes could find
shelter in any of Sidi Hmad Omossa's
Zaouias. This was the most feared of â 
all, for Prince Ali's father maintained
twenty-six Zaouias along the edge of
the Great Desert. These Za-ouias are
resting places where a stranger may
find shelter, food for himself and horse
or camel and if necessary fresh horses
or camels and guides If on a strange
journey. The Zaouias are maintained
wholly by Sidi Hmad Omossa out of the
tribute money paid him by the wander-
Ing tribes, and in turn he extends the
hospitality of his Zaouias in time of
need. He reserves the light, however,
upon justifiable cause, to refuse admis
sion to any member of the tribe who
may have offended him.
It was about two years ago that Has
san Ben Ali made the star play of hia
life. He landed in New York with a
fresh troupe of Arabs, all of whom he
promptly hid somewhere in the city.
A few days later a cab drove hur
riedly to the Fifth-avenue Hotel. A
richly dressed and mysterious-looking
Arab alighted. Another cab folio-wed
with a servant and no end of boxes and
bundles. The Arabian potentate reg
istered a queer-looking name that no
one to this day has been able to der
cipher. He selected an ele<*~ ~t suite of
rooms. At night his servant lay on a
mat in front of his door like a big dog
watching his master.
This mysterious Arab never appeared
in public without his servant. His rich
dress naturally attracted attention. His
hands were covered with diamonds and
rich jewels. Diamonds hung by gold
chains from the four sides of his fez,
a bejeweled cimetar showed itself from
under the folds of his purple girdle. The
reporters pursued him continuously,
determined to learn his identity, but he
rudely brushed them away.
The rich Arabian would not conde

of the trouble was the drawing-room,
Which mamma declared must be fresh

started the disease spread and from gar

more acutely than the house itself.

Special to The Sunday Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.-"Please
excuse mamma to-dayâ she's
busy," lisped a little girl of 6
years to a visitor.
The caller hesitated before
turning away and the girl added:
"She's upstairs in the attic looking for
an old plaid shawl that used to be grand
ma's."
"The old plaid shawl that used to be
grandma's" will be very fashionable this
winter. You will see It in so many guises
that you will scarcely recognize it. and
you will behold it decorated, trimmed and
utilized in all manner and variety of
trimmings.
"The old plaid shawl that used to be
grandma's" has been brought down from
the attic and hung in the breeze until all
the camphor smell blew out of it; it has
been pressed and shaken until the creases
were out of it and the nap all restored;
it has been cut and sewed and fashioned
into a new garment, such as will delight
the heart of the fashionable woman who
was so fortunate as to possess a grand
ma, the whole season through.
It Is undeniably a plaid season; the
spring proved the fact that plaids are
popular; and now for a month plaids will
again hold sway in great brilliancy.
"The plaid season," said a very fash
ionable Paris dressmaker, "Is from April
15 to June 1. and from September 15 to
November 1."
It Is true that during the six weeks of
the plaid sf-a.snn plaids are brought out
and fairly flaunted in the breeze. You
tree gaudy plaid vests and no less gaudy
plaid coats. You behold scarlet plaid rib
bon upon a mixf-d plaid straw toque, and
you see hous* bodices plalded until the
wearer is a grand mixture of color.
The favorite and the showiest bit of
plaid which one can wear in one's cos
tume Is the plaid vest, which for the next
six weeks takes the place of the muslin
shirt waist. The vest Is made- sU-^velesa
with a silk back and a plaid cloth front.
The back may be of taffeta and the front
of Scotch suiting. The buttons may be of
Cearl and the lining of the lapels of
right silk.
The plaid vest fits very tightly at the
waist; in fact, is is decidedly glove-fit
ting. Its glory lies In the fact that it is
very snug, and the very nicest handiwork
is necessary to secure a good fit. The vest
If worn over a white muslin shirt front
which is attached to a white broad col
lar. A plaid tie to match tho vest is
worn with this, and Into the tie are stuck
numerous sporty little pins of various oe-
signs.
The plaid coat is of a heavier grade of
cloth and it hangs loose in the front very
much like the English hunting coat. It
is trimmed down the front with largo
pearl buttons, which do not, however, do
the real work. The coat is firmly hook
ed and the buttons are merely for orna-
ments.
The popular new coat collar Is one
THE VEST THAT WILL BE WORN THE NEXT SIX WEEKS.
which flares all the way around. It has
heavy stitchings and Is something like a
Medicis collar, only not quite so tall.
The coat has modilied sleeves which are,
however, large enough to slip over a silk
waist, and It is lined with thin silk to
make it pull on easily.
The larger the plaid in the coat the bet
ter, provided it is not too large. A piald
of four inches Is fashionable as is also one
of two inches. The ugly plaids are those
which are so large as to cover the whole
of the back in one square.
Plaid ribbons make very jaunty little
hats for fall. The ribbon is tied in a
very upright bow knot and the bow knot
is then stood upon the front of the hat
with Its loups proudly erect. The plaid
in the ribbon is supposed to match the
pliiid In the jacket and thus the fall wo
man looks very much like a piece of nov
elty goods as she sallies forth on the first
brisk day in her gay plaid.
Plaids for house waists are decidedly
novel. Some of them are flgurea. One
of the prettiest was a very thin cloth
plaid figured with violets. The violets
were scattered all over the goods. An
other was figured with small bunches of
roses so that the plaid goods was made
very gay with the flowers.
Plaid skirts are trimmed with bands of
braid, but very seldom with ruffles. A
plaid ruffle is always a bewildering thing
and the fashion makers have just about
abandoned the idea of using them. Plaid
skirts are treated to bands of black braid
put on In clusters of from four to ten rows
each. The clusters are brought closer and
closer together as they approach the
waist.
Any plain band trimming can be used
upon a plaid skirt, and pipings and bands
of plain silk are much seen. A green and
red McKinley plaid can be banded with
scarlet silk. This makes a very pretty
skirt for fall and one that lias a lovely
effect as the leaves are turning.
In a little while It will be time for gray
and green, but just now the plaids are
holding their own.
These plaid skirts are all lined with silk,
or imitation silk, and are ruffled arounu
the foot with a narrow dust ruffle which
shows slightly below the hem of the skirt.
Red and blue hold their popularity in
plaid combinations and so do yellow and
green. Any color is pretty in plaid except
white, which should be used sparingly.
Silk vests are considerably worn, but
are less fashionable than the cloth ones.
Later there come the chamois vests,
which are made in such attractive styles
that one cannot tell them from cloth, so
embroidered and trimmed are they.
The new plaids are many, but the most
popular ones are the Cuban and Dewey
plaids. The Dewey plaid Is composed of
mangrove green and cantaloupe yellow,
with a band of pomegranate rod. The
green and yellow cross eacU other in
broad stripes through which a pjn stripe
of red runs.
The Cuban plaid is 'l:-irji*rp. being of
brown and purp'o with green running
through the brown. It is a pretty plaid,
though, and will be seen a great deal.
The old plaid shawls make very excel
lent waists, although it is a pity to cut
them up. Many persons prefer to use
them for skirts as though there were less
slaughter of an heirloom In cutting a skirt
than a waist. The fringe Is thon used aa
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, IS9S.
OCTOBER PLAIDS AND FASHIONS
a trimming around the foot of the skirt.
The fringe when used in this way is set
an inch above the hem to avoid fraying
around the foot.
Another way of using the plaid shawl is
as a bias band around the bottom of the
skirt. The shawl is spread out and care
fully cut crosswise in strips of about lif
teen inches wide. These strips are after
ward sewed around the foot of a plain
cloth skirt and thus do duty a^bias folds.
If the shawl is very large, th<r remainder
of it is made into a waist, using the fringe
as a trimming for the revers aiid shoulder
puffs.
Evening dresses are even to be trimmed
with shawls, but the enveloping plaid
covering will not ilnd its wav Into the
drawing-room unless It be or very old

fashion and the shawl can be either of
white, delicately embroidered In some
contrasting color, or, as is often the case,
it can be of pale blue, pale pink or pale
green heavily worked with white.
The borders are embroidered In large
roses and finished with long silk fringe,
and in the four corners of the shawl are
great bunches of the flowers. When
draped skillfully these shawls add much
grace and beauty to the gown, and they
will be among the leading trimmings for
evening dresses of fall and winter.
But for daylight wear plaids will be
used. Men will also dress considerably in
plaids this fall, and for them there is the
ever popular Scotch plaid and the Mc-
Klnloy tweed, which has run a season or
more.
The greatest latitude is allowed in men's
suitings, and it is surprising to see the

A FEW words about the care of
the ears will not be amiss In
these beauty talks, for the size
and Bhape of these affect the
personal appearance to a great
er or less extent. The perfect ear should
be about twice as long as broad, and
should He back close to the head. There
are very few perfect ears.
Although nature has much to do with
the size and shape of the ear, mothers
are largely to blame for the almost de
formed ear we continually see In young
people.
There Is nothing that gives a lad so
uncouth an appearance as wide, project-
Ing ears, and yet, a little care In early
youth will almost entirely remedy this
defect. A simple bandage worn at night,
which holds the ears flat to the head.
Is all that Is necessary. The absence of
bones and the soft cartilages make the
ear a particularly easy member to train.
Rrarely ever Is an individual found
whose two ears are exactly the same in
shape, and so marked is the difference in
some cases that when photographed It is
fllfficult to believe that the pair belonged
to one individual. It is said that the right
car is an inheritance from the father or
his family, while the left resembles the
mother's ear or that of some of her fam
ily, which accounts for the dissimilarity.
Too much cannot be said against the
reprehensible habit which some mothers
have of boxing their children's ears.
When this Is resorted to concussion takes
place, the power of which is often greater
than the delicate membrane of the drum
head can resist, and it bursts. The mem
brane may heal, but the blow often af
fects the nerve, paralyzing it, which, in
the end, may bring on permanent deaf
ness. There Is a certain portion of the
child's anatomy, oh, ye mothers! that
was especially designed by nature for the
chastising hand or slipper of the irate
parent, so let the blows fall there if fall
they must, and so protect the delicate or
gan that was meant for other purposes
than chastisement.
If I had my way no child's ears should
ever be pierced. To my mind this Is a
relic of barbarism and any mutilation of
the flesh Is abominable. Piercing, when
clumsily performed, has been known in
many cases to develop erysipelas and ab
scesses of a most dangerous character.

Any girl who can sew a little bit can
have a red waist Just as chic as those

and belt can be made for about $3. A

yard of black satin will be sufficient.
BY MME. hYGEIA.
And ears whose lobes have been severed
by the weight of rings are most disfig
uring-.
A perfect and healthy ear should be of
a shell-like ptnkness. When, however,
they are continuously red, which may be
the result of frequent pinchlngs or pull-
Ing or exposure to the cold, wash them
morning and evening with a lotion made
as follows:
Alum (powdered), 1 teaspoonful.
Borax, 1 teaspoonful.
Tincture of benzoin, 2 tablespoonfuls.
Rosewater, ifc pint.
When the ears are very pale in color,
with that wax like appearniioe which be
tokens ill health, bathe them frequently
with alcohol or bay rum.
Women who are subject to eczema of
the ear, which is not an uncommon ;ill
ment, should avoid shell-fish and pork in
every form. They should pin their faith
to fruits and salads, particularly dande
lion and water cress. They should take
frequent warm baths and be careful not
to get chilled or overheated. For the fear
ful itching which often accompanies ec
zema of the ear a local application of lip
terlne, diluted with water, will usually
be found eftlracious.
Never Insert a sharp lntrument of any
kind into the ear for the purpose of clean
ing or scratching It, as they are liable to
Injure the delicate membrane and pro
duce permanent ill results. No liquid of
any sort should ever be Injected into the
ear except by medical advice. In case of
earache the only safe home remedy Is a
hot water bag, or a roasted onion very
hot, done up In flannel and applied on
the outside of the ear.
Regarding the care of the ear cleanli
4>fss is the first consideration. Many
of otherwise scrupulously cleanly
habits seem not to understand how to
thoroughly wash and cleanse the ears of
the accumulations of dust and cerumen.
The pleasing whole of a well dressed, neat
looking woman's appearance Is completely
marred when one discovers the apparent
neglect of this important little member.
The best way to clean the ears is to use
a little toilet utensil called an aurilnve,
which Is usually made of ivory or bone,
and has a tiny sponge covering Its end.

The garment is cut like a shirt waist
and made without lining, being kept in
place at the waist by a Braw string. The
sleeves should be pfain and not full, but
gathered into a cuff noi more than two
inches wide and closed by a gold button.
The tie must be made on the length
wise of the satin, with an interlining: of
crinoline, and is thf' same shape as the
white pique Ascot ties, but seven inches
wide. Cut the stock the same a-s the
white stock, with buttonholes back and
front.
The belt is quite new, and consists of
a-. piece of satin twenty inches wide dou
bled, having the edges stitched. In the
back the belt is pulled up almost to the
shoulder blades, but in front is pulled
as far down as possible and confined by
a double gold or silver buckle not mors

The waist is closed by fancy studs,

with the waist, silk being quite out of

Massage, of course, must accompany its
application. Don't "rub as hard as you
possibly can," but hold the skin taut with

AFTERNOON COSTUME FOR FALL
Ing It would be a very risky experiment.
The eyebrows may be improved by using
a quinine wash made by mixing five
grains of sulphate of quinine in one ounce
of alcohol. Apply this every other night
and on the nights in between times mas
sage very gently with the fingers dipped
in warm olive oil.
KITTYâ Do let me know if you were
finally successful with the cold cream.
LULUâ The embrocation made of the
following ingredients Is very excellent for
softening and whitening the hands: Al
mond oil, V/i ounces; cucumber juice, 2
ounces; white wax, 2 drachms; sperma
ceti, 1 ounce; oil of neroli, 10 drops. To
get the cucumber Juice press it out of
the fresh cucumbers. Heat this to a point
Just sufficient to coagulate the albumin
ous matter and strain. Melt, the wax and
spermaceti over a water bath, add the
almond oil slowly and remove from the
heat. Now add the cucumber Juice, also
slowly. Stir continually with a silver
spoon until cold. Then beat in the oil of
neroli. Rub this well into the hands at
night. If after using it several weeks
it has not helped you let me know.
BROWN EYESâ The fat face and
double chin can be reduced by dieting,
exercise and proper massage. Smear the
face and chin with cold cream, and then
with the tips of the first finger and thumb
gently pinch the flesn. Be sure not to
bruise the skin. This systematic picking
up and rolling of the flesh between the
fingers will in time dissolve the tissues.
The result will be a sort of a flabbiness
of the skin which can be done away with
by a weak alum solution. Put a bit of
aium the size of a bean in a pint of
cold water, and apply with a piece of ab
sorbent cotton after the massage.
MISS RAE CHAMERSâ You will find
your question answered in the foregoing
reply to Medusus. Also use the cold
cream formula for which is given in re
ply to Mrs. A. Raffeto.
CONFIDENCEâ Glycerine in its pure
state will very often cause the tiny hairs
to sprout. Electricty is the only sure
cure and ir would be utter folly to un
dergo the nervous torture of the electric
needle to remove anything that Is of so
little real account. If the little hairs are
very dark you can lighten them and so
make them' less noticeable by putting a
little peroxide of hydrogen on them. It
is owing to a lack of lime In the system
that the nails split or are brittle. Rem
edy this by medical treatment. Some
times seoklng them in warm olive oil will
help Suppose you try it. .The half
moon does not show on every one"s
fingers no matter how for down the flesh
wav be pushed. I would advise you to
go 'to a manicure, who understands the
treatment of nails in the condition yours
are in After two or three treatments
you will be able to care for your nails
yourself. I know of absolutely nothing
that will make the lips thinner. Large

and constant pinching â not hard pinching,
but firm smoothing. I gave a special talk
last Sunday on the treatment of black
heads, which I presume, you saw. It is
almost impossible to get rid of them with
out using soap. Really, I think you need
the advice of a competent physician. I
think the digestive and circulatory sys
tems need a general overhauling. Try
this lotion for massaging the hollow, bony
places: Add equal parts of lanollne,
cocoanut oil and cocoa butter. How
ever, as long as your general health is
not good, outward applications will be of
little benefit. Soap has a tendency to
make the teeth yellow, and charcoal and
all other gritty substances, if used fre
quently will Injure the enamel. The best
base for tooth powders is prepared chalk.
To this you can add some powdered orris
root, which gives it a pleasant flavor and
has a favorable effect upon the gums.
ANTOINETTEâ Of course, omitting
the soap will somewhat alter the char
acter of the cucumber milk. It should
make a creamy yellow liquid. If you ob
ject to the soap and oil, then use the cu
cumber juice in this way. Press L ne juice
out of the green cucumbers. Heat this
until a white scum rises to the top. Skim
this off and then strain. Dilute it about
one-third with rosewater, and a little
alcohol added to it will preserve it. Many
of the oily substances when used in this
pure state undoubtedly have a tendency
to promote the growth of hair upon the
fare, but when used merely as an ingre
dient in a cream or lotion can be used
with perfect safety. The wrinkles should
be massaged as illustrated In your dia
gram, only there should also be an arrow
straight up through the middle of the
forehead. For wrinkles in the forehead a
compress of new linen, soaked in a mix
ture of equal parts of alcohol and white
of egg is quite beneficial. I know nothing
about chloroform used for the purpose
you mention. Listerine, slightly diluted,
is one of the best things I know of for
that purpose. When one s nose is sensitive
to changes of temperature it is usually a
sign of weak circulation, which should be
restored by tonics, massage or baths, or
any method suggested by one's physician.
In the way of an outward applictalon
there Is nothing better than witch hazel.
I presume this is the hair tonic you refer
to- Fifteen grains of quinine dissolved in
half a pint of alcohol. This is particularly
good for hair that is very oily.
VIRGINIA. R. B. P.â You might try
this lotion for the freckles: Three grains
borax; five drams rose water; five drams
orange flower water. But. as freckles are
the natural accompaniment of auburn
hair, and as you have had yours so long,
I doubt if anything will remove them.
I should let them alone if I were you
and not worry about them. Rubbing the
eyebrows every other night with five
grains of sulphate of quinine dissolved
in one ounce of .alcohol, and on the other
nights massaging with pure olive oil will
often bring a darker hue.

HAS STARTLED COURT CIRCLES.
Publication of Dr. Busch's Long Expected
LIFE OF EISM^pGK.
THE most sensational book that has' 1 *
appear* il ii many a day is "Bis
marckâSome Secret Pages of # His
tory/! by, Dr. Moritz Busch. Here
for t ho first time are rattled some â 
. of the many skeletons in the royal
lions- of . England and Germany. Bis
marck is shown to be a different man
than most people supposed him to be.
The Kings and Emperors of Germany are
made to stand In the calcium glare of
Bismarck's eye. Some of the revelations
are startling and not calculated to. make
crowned, heads sit more easily on their
thrones.
But has Dr. â¢ Busch been true to his
trust in putting such a book before Uusi
world? Dr. .Busch thinks he has been.
In more ways than one the book Is re
markable. Dr. Busch has performed the ;
apparently impossible. He has out-
Frouded Fronde and out-Purcelled Pur- j
cell.
It Is not merely that Dr. Busch has
succeeded In degrading his hero far more
than Frouile â¢ â  graded Carlylo or Pur
cell degraded Manning. He has commit- ;
ted Indiscretions against the living or the
recently dead which must prove more !
sensationally painful than any of the
lapses made by the two Englishmen, who I
have reached a bad eminence as the most
tactless, the most Inconsiderate, the most
essentially disloyal of all biographers. '
Of course Dr. Busch has his excuse put
forward in this viry book lii anticipation
of the storm of criticism which It must
provoke.
He quotes Bismarck as telling him
"Once I am dead you can tell everything
you like; absolutely everything you I
know."
Paving thus received the sanction of I
him "wucm I look upon as the first of
men." Dr. Busch professes smail care
tor the opinions or others, "ihe great ;
majority of those referred to," he says.
"have departed from this life and taken
their places in the domain of history,
where tne claim for indulgent treatment
is no longer valid. Those who an stui
with us may be 'neve me. when 1 assure
them that in now publishing these pages
1 have no thought of causing mem pain
or Injuring them in any way.'
Dr. Busch's assurances will carry very ;
scant Lalm to the members of the royal
family of England and the imperial tarn- â 
iiy C] Germany, who are disdainfully and ;
even scandalously treated in the conver
sations reported in these volumes.
Nor will Bismarck's reputation be en
hanced by the discovery that he was a
good aeai of a hypocrite in his attitude
toward the sui ce-stive masters whom he
served and feigned to reverence as gifts
of God to the Jr'ruL-.sian nation, that even
for William i he nad only a kindiy con
tempt, and for his son a contempt that
was absolutely ur.Kindly, that ne nad no
words too bitter tor the tonics ana pre
tenses of an i he women- of. the royal
â¢hou&ehola. that he indulged in such petty j
tricks ac secretly writing or inspiring
articles with one hand while he de
nounced' them publicly \vi... the other,
and that in ; Is <â â â .â . age. when he came to
dictate his memoirs, lie degenerated into
a liar and a braggart.
Let me Justify these charges from Dr.
Busch's own pages. And first as to Wil
liam I. He is popularly supposed to have
been Bismarck's idol. Yet in pages 414-15
of the second volume is recorded a con
versation in which Bismarck describes his
iaoi as alternately a coward and a head
strong fool, whose weakness and irreso
lution would have lost him his crown
many times ovc-r were it not that he was
under- the â¢ dominance of Bismarck's
mightier will.
biiscii cioses the conversation by the
sententious remark: " "Monarchs are of
ten adorned with other people's feathers.
If a battle is won at wnicn one of them
happens to be present as a spectator, he
is said to have, although, ot course, the
start, has really won it, and so it is In
your case in tne field of battle.'
"'Why, 'yes, 1 replied Bismarck, with
the price tr.at apes humility, -out if the
york is done ai.d succeeds, that is tne
mats point; It is a matter of indifference
wno did it.' "
lie was especially contemptuous of the
vanity of AN lliiam I, and ol his submis
sion io petticoat tyranny. He. held that
lie was. largeiy under the dominance of
the present Dowager Empress of Ger
many, and thToug her of her mother,
Queen Victoria. He held that these ladies
were selfishly insular In their sympathies.
and that even the Empress would be glad
to use her adopted country as a tool for
the furtherance of British as against
German interests.
They even bc-trayed an altogether un
necessary tenderness toward France dur
ing the Franco-Prussian war. trom day
to day after the German army had en
camped around Paris, the bombardment
of tne city was delayed because of the
opposition of the Queen of England and
the en Crown Princess of Prussia. On
XovemÃcr 19, 1870, Bismarck is found
complaining to Busch, "1 told the King
again yesterday that It was time to be
gin, and he had no objection to make.
He replied that he had given orders to
begin, but that the generals said they
could not." Busch continues: "It ap
pears that in his opinion first Queen Vic
toria and then, at her instance, the Crown
Princess, and finally the Crown Prince,
persuaded by his consort, will not have
Paris bombarded, while the generals 'can
not' bombard the city out of considera
tion for the views of the Crown Prince,
who will, of course, be the future King
and will have the appointment of Minis
ters of War, commandants of army corps
fir.d iclti n.aishals."
On November 29. 1870, Bismarck said to
Busch: "The King told me ah untruth
to-day. I asked him if the bombardment
was not to commence, and he replied that
he had ordered it. But I knew Immedi
ately that It was not true. I know htm.
He cannot lie, or at least not in such
a way that I; cannot be detected, He at
once changes color, and It was particu
larly noticeable when he replied to my
question to-day. When I looked at him
straight into his eyes he could not stand 1
it."
Again he laid the blame for the royal
indecision to "the sentimentality of Queen
Victoria." which had' percolated" through
the entire feminine contingent of ' Prus
sian royalty.
"That seems." be cried, "to be the
characteristic of the Hohenzollernsâ their,
women folk always have a great infiu-

and regard it as a matter of course. We
are an inferior race, ordained to serve '
them. So the Queen. thinks, too. and her <
daughter is exactly of the same opinion. !
They are working In partnership..
And again, after the Crown Princess j
had become Empress; for a brief period,
he complained that "at home with her
daughters she only speaks English, the
language of the chosen people, and tne
Princesses write English letters to their
father." Busch supplements this state
ment with an anecdote of Princess Vic
toria, one of the Empress' daughters,
she had a difference with her brother on
one occasion regarding Some household
arrangement.
"After all. that is much better managed
at home," he cried.
"At homo.' What do you mean?" queried
William.
"Why. at home in England," retorted
Princess Victoria.
li was this young lady's projected mar
riage with Prince Alexander of Batten
berg which threatened at one time to be
come an International question of tne
gravest import.
The present German Empress Is an
other re:niulne member of the Imperial
family of Prussia for whom bismarck
haa a shrewd contempt. \i" his is now he
describes her wouia-be filial * attitude
miring the last sickness â ol Emperor
Frederick William, her father-in-iaw: :
"The Grand Duchess wants So play the
loving- daughter before people; and a i sue
accompanies him when ne, like every one
who works a great deal, would preier to
drive out alone, and at me same time sne
argues with him, even who:: the wind is
in their faces, so thai he catches cold If
he answers her. As he sits at work Au
gusta sticks her head into the room and
asks in a caressing voice, "Do I disturb
you?' When he, always gallant in the
treatment of ladies, and particularly of
esses, repnos No. she comes in and
pours out all sorts of magnificent gossip
to him, and scarcely has at last gone
away man she comes back again, knock
ing at the door with her "i am again dis
turbing you,' ana so she wastes ins time
chatting. Now that he Is ill â you know i
what his complaint Isâ she is a real em
barrassment ana plague to him. Shi s.ts
there with him, ana when he wants to De
left alone he does not venture to tell her,
so that in the end he gets quite red from
pain and restraint, and Mie. notices it.
'That is not love, however, but pure play
acting, conventional care and affection.!
There is nothing natural about her;
everything is artificial, inwardly as weii
as outwardly."
Imagine what delight the perusal of
this passage will carry Into tne I.cart of
her Imperial Highness, as likewise Into
the heart of her imperial and imperious
spouse.
Dr.. Busch complacently adds a piece of
brutality of which he was guilty after tne
death of Frederick William. VI wrote to
Bucher," he says "a few lines expressing
the satisfaction I felt that we were re
lieved from that incubus, and that his
place will now be taken by a disciple and
admirer of the chief." tie also quotes
from Bismarck an "exquisite example"
of Frederick William's incapacity. "We
had at one time a secret treaty with the
St. Petersburg people which now no
longer exists. Under it we were to re
main neutral In case of war breaking out
between England and Russia. On my
mentioning the treaty to the Crown
Prince he remarked: "Of course, England
has been informed and agreed to It!
No wonder Busch records that mere
was great laughter at tJie table when this
tale was told, "in which the ladies also
Joined."
Of the present Emperor William, when
he was only the eldest son of the Crown
Prince, Bismarck spoke very hopefully, iv
ISS2, contrasting him favorably with hi*
indolent, comfort-seeking father. '"He is
energetic 'and determined, not at all dis
posed to put up with parliamentary co
regents, a regular guardsman! Phiio
pater and Antipater at Potsdam! He is
not at all pleased at his father taking up
with professors, wit.. Mommson, Virchow
and Porekenbeck. Perhaps he. may one
day develop Into the rocher de bronze of
which we stand in need."
Mythmongf-rs will be pleased to find the
origin of a famous chestnut traced to tug
present German Emperor as a child. Or.
Busch had asked whether governesses
and other persons intrusted with the edu
cation of princes were at liberty to chas
tise them when they were naught> or
whether they had to tell their rents,
who decided as to their punishment. Bis
marck answered the first part of he ques
tion in the affirmative; and went on to
say that the governess of the Emueror
William II said as she was administering i
physical chastisement to film on one oc- i
casion:
"Believe me, Royal Highness, that it
hurts me as much as it does you to do
this."
"Ah:" exclaimed the little Prince, "ami
does it hurt in the same place?"
Is it authorial vanityâ desire that
his book shall remain in history as the one
true record of the inner thoughts and
feelings of Bismarckâ prompts him
to discredit the forthcoming memoirs of
the Prince Chancellor in advance of their
publication?
In March, 1591,. Bismarck himself told
Busch that the memoirs .would probably
come to nothing. "I have no documents,"
he said, "and even if I remember the
main pointsâ quite clearly â one cannot,
after all. carry in his head every detail
of what has happened in the course of
thirty years. Then, as to the publication

BARBIZON AND MME. SiRON.
From 'he 5a 'jrda/ Review.
The bones of Millet would surely turn
in their quiet grave at Chailly should
any one suggest that the peaceful hamlet
is a whit less the happy paradise .if ar
tists than in the days when be saw that
vision of peasants bower] beneath the
benediction of the evening Angelus, and
immortalized the pathos of their BUdden
rest. No, Barbizon is still one of the last
haunts of the spirit of romance, and the
ghosts of Ivliliet and Corn,, Diaz and
Rousseau still haunt the village street
in the white moonlight and lurk in the â 
shadows of the dark dining room at the
Hotel Siron. In that hotel is perhaps the
plainest sign of the procession of the
years; for Mme. Siron, the homely friend
of many gen< rations of artists and poets,
has sold the place to and .
prising couple, who have Brought some
thing of the bustle and energy of Paris

Now she Kits in front of her cottage

one of her favoritesâ l flatter myself that
I am oneâ you may. perhans, win from
her some delightful reminiscences of the
great men -she has known. But she is
Old, and her memory is something over
charged; and. besides, now that she has
become a proprietaire, she has many oth
er things to think of than the doings of
feckless paintersâ a race for which she
has, I am persuaded, a gentle and moth
erly contempt. Still, you may be lucky
enough to glean something of entertain
ment from her slightly vague recollec
tions. Robert Louis Stevenson, for in
stance, is one of those of whom she likes
best to talk, and she is full of stories of
his quaint humor.
Miss Molly Elliot Sea well's new novel, "The

0 Modest Artist
AND AN UNUSUAL PF(ESS AGENT.
BY a stoutly displayed interview in
an evening newspaper I see that
Mis? Nance O'Neil of California
has been talking back to her
critics. This is a good sign.
It shows that Miss O'Neil takes us
seriously, a form of flattery that is not
frequent. And then she is honest and
amiable about it. Sho argue* the point
â the point of overdoing Leah in "The
Jewess"â and to those of us who think
she overdid she says you are kind and
well - meaning but mistaken. Miss
O'Neil has been likened tothe strapping
Oherktte Cushman and, : il-mg this f<r
compliment (as well Bhe may), longs
frankly for a revival of the Cushman
spirit. She believes in the stage art that
reveals rod corpuscles, lusty lungs and
cerebral vigor; Bhe thinks a long course
of anemic, epicene play-acting has su
persensitized us to a point where we
cannot meet the shock of a big, bound
ing, flesh and blood impersonation like
hers of the Jewess; she says that with
experience we all will come around to
her way of thinking.
* â¢ *
I talked v h Miss O'Nell a week ago
and one has only to do that to be con
vinced of her seriousness and candor.
Unquestionably there is somo sense and
truth in what s' has to say. The
modern stage does need a few able
bodied >V'.::-.g actors and actresses who
would 1 a sort of "pink pills for pale"
playgoers. But the need is for the real
live thing, "t a new inflammation of
the old melodrama. Traditions of act-
Ing have always conspired to keep the
dra.-ia out of ac human key and cer
tain gestures, flings, shouts and chokes
that a hundred years ago v, â¢ con
sidered good business are earning sal
aries to-day. Rut humanity as you
and I find it capers very differently.
Misa ' -\eil ... a unique body and
temperament; she has i; nents of
thrilling: originality: she Is capable of
being trer. -.dously, brutally human;
but in Leah, at least, she gives only
fragmentary evidences of this. Instead
of giving free play to her own person-
elity and her own ideas, of which she
talks E charmingly, she wastes her
genius and health in trying to force an
illusion out of the tricks and manner
isms of another day.

With all credit to McKee Rankin for
discovering Miss and developing
her to her present proportions, I can
not but think that In his zecl to make
a great actrc-ss he has over-Belascoed
his pupil. Mr. Rankin is a master in
the good old melodramatic school â
elaborate, compiic.itc-d, twice the size
of ltf~. As a tut >r-actor he would be
a Joy at Morosco's, but he is not the
model for a rushing emotional gift like
Miss O'Neil's. You can read Rankin
written all over everything she does.
She is undertralned in the subtle work
of repression and suggestion, and over
trained in voice, gesture, by-p!ay and
all the physical notions of the craft.
Often she carries you away by the
force of her passion, but oftener she
carries herself beyond the credible. She

is to-day a sensation when she might
be a success. â¢
â¦ â¢ â¢
And if Nance O'Neil is a sensation
her press agent is another and a suc
cess besides. I have spent perhaps the
saddest days of my life reading over
the matter that is sent to newspapers
by the adjective artists of the theaters.
From them I have learned how to ex
ceed the superlative, defy grammar
and doubt the existence of truth. Read
for yourself this sane, crisp paragraph
from Miss O'Neil's salaried celebrator
and imagine the shock it gave me:
Nance O'Neil is announced as
Parthenia in "Ingomar" the first
three nights and Saturday matinee
of this week, and as Nancy Sykes
in "Oliver Twist." with McKee
Rankln as Bfcl Sykes, for the re
maining four nights of this week.
It is easy to understand that Miss
O'Neil will live up to her reputa on
as an exceptionally powerful tragic
actress in the role of Nancy Sykes,
and if the gentle simplicity she dls-
played in the last act of "The Jew
ess" can be extended through the
four acts of "Ingomar" she should
at least make a favorable impres
sion. The advance agent and man
agers claim that she is more dainty
and delicate as Parthenia than she
is emotional in "The Jewess" and
tragic in Nancy Sykes, but they are
not always to be trusted. It is only-
Just to say that they have not over
estimated her exceptional strength,

but then it is difficult to understand
_ that an actress who rather storm- __
ed her audience into attention in
one role should succeed in gaining
the same attention in another by
directly opposite methods.
Ah! if all press agents only wrote
like that!
But on second thoughts it is just as
well they don't: if they did, dramatic
critics would be superfluous.

most of the architecture, while I
made the figures and the Roman

The first production In this city of E.
H. Sothern's romantic success. "An En
emy to the Kfnp." is announced to take
; place at. the Raldwin to-morrow nig-ht.
Aside from the presentation of an Impor
tant success there will be the added inter
est In the reappearance with the new
| Frawley company of Miss Blanche Bates,
' who has been loaned to Manager Frawley
by AuKUstin Paly, unuor whose manage
ment Bhe is now appearing. The play
calls for a cast of twenty-six speaking
! ports.. Among the new members of the
company who will appear In the play on
j Monday night are pretty Georgia Welles,
the new ingenue of the company, and the
well known old actor, Joseph P. Keefe,
who has been here on several occasions
with Stuart Robson's company. His most
celebrated bit of work was the creation
of the stock dealing Clergyman in the
comedy, "The Henrietta."
"An Enemy to the iving" will be elab
orately staged. The striking costumes of
the period in which the story is laid af
ford splendid opportunity for attractive
display in that quarter, and the manage
ment has gone to ai. enormous expense
for various costumes to be worn in the
production. As Julie de Varlon Miss
Bates will be seen in a role quite superior
to any given a play by modern writers of
romantic drama.. In most cases the male
leading role has been the finer, but
Author Stephens has made an exception
in his play. "An Enemy to the Kins" will
be given at the Ealdwin at the regular
Frawley prices.

she will be called upon for a wide stretch
of versatility. Mr. Rankln's Bill Sykes is

Harry Corson Clarke and his clever
company continue at the New Comedy
Theater another week, describing what
happened to the irrepressible Jones. The
farce is full of quick, clean American fun,
and is well served up by the young star
and his supporting players. Commencing
to-morrow night, the performances of
"Jones" will be preceded by a little cur
tain-raiser, "One Touch of Nature," in
which Mr. Clarke has one of his favorite
old gentleman parts. It Is said that nix.
Clarke has secured an option on Broad
hurst's latest piece, a farce by the howl
ing title of "Why Smith Left Home."

After a run of three weeks "The First

to Gus Thomas' beautiful character
drama, "In Mizzoura."
n was as Jim Radburn, the red-headed
sheriff hero of this play, that Nat Good
win did the most artistic work of his
life. It is a strong, beautiful play
throughout, the best that the author of
"Alabama" has ever written. "Shore
Acres" and "The Old Homestead" are
children's pieces as compared with this,
for, apart from its fidelity to local color
and dialect, there is real drama in the
story. "In Mizzoura" is a play of genu
ine heroism, and yet there are none of
the old-fashioned heroics in it.
J^orosco's.
Although "The Coast Guard" during
the past week, together with the attrac
tive specialty of the Waterman sisters
and the initial performance of Miss Maud
Miller, has drawn crowded houses at Mo
rosco's, the play will be withdrawn to
make way for the reopening of that pop
ular actor James M. Brophy in "Trilby."
When the young California actor termi
nated his recent starring engagement he
did not contemplate playing in this city
again for some time. Manager Morosco,
however, having in view a grand opera
season in March, the remodeling of the
Grand Opera-house and a general change
of policy, desired to strengthen his stock
company for the remainder of the pres
ent season. Before taking his vacation
Mr. Brophy was consequently induced to
accept an engagement as stock star of
the company. He believes that his con
ception of the character of Svengali wUI
compare favorably with that of Mr.
Lackaye, Mr. Roberts or Beerbohm Tree,
and will follow closely the lines laid down
by Mr. Dv Maurier as to the make-up
and characterization of the hypnotic mu
sician.
The entire company and several extra
people are in the cast.
Jhe TiVoli.
The production of Gol^martC's "Queen
of Sheba" Is one of the most creditable
ever given at the Tlvoll. The difficulties
of casting and staging an opera of
thl s character are exceptional, and
the Tlvoli deserves all the profit that
follov.-H Its enterprtae. The work is an
Important one, and until now has been
unknown to most of the music-lovera
and Sunday and the Saturday matinee
will be given over to Gounod's "Romeo
and Juliet," another standard opera that
was Introduced to San Francisco by the
Tivoli. Miss Llchter will be Juliet and
Edgardo Zcrni, the Romeo.
On Wednesday and Saturday evenings
"Trovatore" will be sung.
Jhe Orpheum.
The Orpheum's new bill has another act
by a company of graduates from the
legitimate stage. Mr. and Mrs. R. J.
Dustin, late of the Lyceum Theater slock
company, will appear In a one-act com
edy, entitled, "The Man Up Stairs." writ
ten by Augustus Thomas. This little cur
tain-raiser recently scored a success In
the Madison Square Theater. Mr. and
Mrs. Dustin are supported by Cecil Mag
nus, Miss J. Connor and Miss Maggie
Weston, making a company of five in all.
Another artistic turn is claimed in the
Anglo-American Quartet, who will a-ppear
In a military sketch entitled "In Camp."
Other new features are Lew Hawkins, the
monologist, whose name is already
familiar to Orpheum patrons, with a new
budget of songs and witticisms, and the
Sankey Bros., whose feats In equipoise
are claimed to be marvelous. Mile. Jeanne
Franko, the violin virtuoso, who has
been so well received and Miss Bessie
Bonehill and Louis Cazeau, the sleight
of-hand man, will have new things
offer.
The y\lKambra.
This is the last week of Mr. and Mrs.
Sydney Drew at the Alhambra. where

the new people who are to appear to

j^usic.
A delightful event in this almost con
certless month was the recital given by
Miss Anna Miller Wood, in the Asso
ciation Auditorium, on Thursday evening.
Miss Wood sang some of Arthur Foote's
settings of Omar's Rubaiyat, an old
Irish song, "The Little Red Bird," res
cued by Villiers Stanford, and several
French songs, giving spirit and character
to each beyond the mere beauty of tone
which is always in her warm contralto.
Miss Hilda Newman, a young Callfor
nian, just returned from Vienna, where
she has been studying the piano, under
Leschetizky, will give a recital at the

favorable attention of Paderewski while
he was here.

J^E OUJER WOJ?LiD.
Jacob Litt Is chancing Chicago with the
production of a farce by the fateful name
of "Mistakes Will xiappen."
The state of the stage in Spain is not
likely to be made any worse than it is
now, if the accounts of a French investi
gator do not paint its degradation in col
ors too black for justice. He found that
the theater had lost all inte: â zt in the
classical drama of the country, and the
Espagnol, an institution analogous to the
Francais, closed its doors several years
ago because it could obtain support neith
er from the state nor the public.
That "the coon song must go" was one
of the most positive and cheerful asser
tions of the wiseacres in stageland a few
weeks ago, writes Acton Davies in the
Evening Sun. They gave reasons, sub
mitted "signs of the times" in evidence
and cast both aspersions and gloom over
the Honeys, the Lous, the Bullies and
the other coons of recent song and story.
The coon song has urone, but not after the
manner foretold. It has gone on its way
rejoicing, and the public appears to be
with it still. There is a new "Dinah" at
the Broadway Music Hall, along with a
new "Emmaline." TJie newest Hoyt fare*
carries a "Rabbit's Foot" song.
The following criticism of Olga Nether
sole In "The Termagant" is by the critic
of the London Dally Mail,, and notes
many points in common with San Fran
cisco's opinion of Nance O'Neil's acting.
"Miss Nethersole has a vitality which i>
really wonderfulâ a force there Is no gain
saying; and even the feast of manner
isms and tricks she sets before usâ even
the closed eyelids which denote passion,
and the reverberating groans which in
dicate despairâ the all-too-mechanical
method she shows usâ cannot hide the
cleverness, the abandon, the flexibility of
her acting. If she would only restrain
her exuberance â if she would only hold
herself inâ though she would seldom
touch our hearts, she would carry us
away with her by the very force of her
personality. She is a powerful and ac
complished actress, but she has not yet
arrived at the art concealed."
Anna Held threatens to visit us again
this season in a new French comedy.
An interesting experiment will be th*
substitution of Blanche Walsh for Fanny
Davenport in several Sardou plays. Miss
Davenport has paid a handsome fortune
in royalties for the right to produce
Sardou's dramas, and sne sees a possi
bility of profit in sending out an actress
who is now in looks nad manner very
much like the Fanny Davenport of twen
ty years ago.
David Belaaco is back from Europe and
announces that his latest play is yet un
named. No definite plans have been
made for It by the playwright until af
ter the public sees "Zara," in which Mrs.
Carter will make her r'entree on the
American stage. The play is by Berton
and Simon.
An interesting experiment is making at
the Dagmar Theater in Copenhagen. A
series of gratuitous Sunday perform
ances was begun September 4 for the pur
pose of enabling the working classes, who
cannot pay for their places to study the
dramatic literature not only of Den
mark and of to-day, but that of all coun
tries and all periods. The first play was
Ibsen's "Brand," the next Moliere'a
"Malade Imaginaire," and Theodore de
Banville's "Gringoire."
Ibsen is writing a new play for Agnea
Sorma, his most distinguished exponent.
and she will play it in this country under
the Heinrich Conned management.
Mr. and Mrs. Kendal are back in Lon
don now, occupying the St. James The
ater, which they used to manage in part
nership with John Hare. It is more than
ten years now since that prosperous term
of management was ended. The Kendals
are appearing in a play called "The Elder
Miss Blossom," in which Mrs. Kendal im
personates a becomingly gowned maid of
39 years. That, she says, is the age she
prefers to think of as Miss Blossom's.
They will remain at the St. James until
Christmas, when Alexander and his com
pany will return. Next year, they say,
they may revisit this country-

DRIED FRUIT AND RAISINS IN NEW j
YORK.
The New York Commercial says of Raisins
â¢nd Fruit under date of September 19: ;
"All outside supplies of Raisins are exhaust
ed, and buyers must meet the views of the |
association or go without. Business was less I
brisk the last of the week, but there was a i
moderate demand at full prices for Immediate \
shipment. Very little speculative interest was \
noted, however, and few but immediate ship- â 
ment orders were given. Foreign raisins are j
meeting some additional inquiry, and there Is '
some increase in demand, due partially to
ehort crop reports. Prices are practically un- !
changed on the spot, though fractional Increase j
is noted on supplies to arrive.
"Prunes were quiet and steady. There was
some confirmation of the reports printed in
the Commercial lest week to the effect that !
buyers were seeking large sizes in Oregon
and Washington. Reports regarding the '
proportion of large sizes held there are con- I
flicting, but most dealers appear to think sup
plies of these plies will be shÂ«rt. On the spot j
prices were unchanged, and business was con
fined to filling small orders. There is almost no
speculative demand, buyers apparently pre- |
ferring to await the completion of the harvest
before making large investments for future de
livery.
"In other lines little Interest was shown.
Prices were unchanged, an^ business was ,
about the same for the past week or more."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 24.â Speculation was in
clined to wait on the bank statement to-day,
and there was much doubt concerning what the
showing would be. The realizing movement In
the stock market upon it; appearance indi
cated that the return is not regared as al
together favorable in spite of the rise in
the net surplus reserve of 14,012,475. The
increase, in the cash was less than $1,200,
000, the remainder of the Increase in sur
plus was due to a reduction of reserve require
ments by a fall of $11,314,300 in the deposits, a
reflection from the contraction in loans of $11,
102,400. It was believed by some people that
last week's heavy decrease of over $12,000,000
in loans was due in some way to the mysterious
system of averages used by the banks. But,
in that event, there should have been some
bookkeeping compensation in to-day's state
ment. It Is certain that there has been no
euch drastic contraction of open market loans,
either last week or this, as indicated on the
face of the statement. The more probable ex
planation is that advanced In this review
last week, namely, that the liquidated loans are
largely those made to outside banks to finance
subscriptions to the Government loan. The
delivery of bonds by the Government has been
delayed, but is now progressing more rapidly,
and the loans are liquidated with the delivery
of the bonds. The bank returns Indicate other
wise the turn In the money market toward
greater ease. The stock market showed a quiet
but large absorption of railroad stocks, notable
of the Pacifies and Grangers on the traffic re
turns of those roads. The miscellaneous list
showed a tendency to reaction, which was
checked by the firmness of the railroad stocks.
The list under the realization movement was
weak.
The expectation was quite general that the
upward movement of prices on the Stock Ex
change would be resumed this week and that
the tightness of the money market would be
lifted. The expectation Is still general
the events are simply delayed â¢In the various
reactionary Incidents of the week. On Monday
the violent break In | Sugar and the continued
tightness of money hae checked speculative
ventures during the whole week. â¢ The con
tinued hardness of money, has been a particular
disappointment' to speculators, as various fac
tors were looked to confidently â¢ brlnx forth
surprises.
The different factors have proved efficacious
as the week advanced to cause lower rates for
money, but In the meantime a number of banks
have fallen below the reserve limit. The call
money rate went to Â« per cent on Tuesday, the
highest point of the season In spite of the
heavy engagements of gold for import. The
fact that the gold movement has been Inaugu
rated in force just at the time when the monÂ»y
market has passed successfully through the
strain of the Government loan Is significant

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Sept. 24.â The Financier says: '
Whether the actual condition of the New York !
banks at the close of the week is shown In the '
j current statement Is a matter of doubt, but
i the exhibit 13 even more favorable than had
! been anticipated, so far as percentages of re
; serves are concerned. '.;â¢> ; :~
The factors of Importance which developed ]
' within the past few days influenced the totals. !
| The first of the gold Imports have been added j
I to specie account, the losses to the treasury :
j were very much less than have been reported !
of late and the interior movement continues '
light. By contracting their loans the banks !
\ have been able to reduce their deposits, thereby !
bringing down the reserve requirements and :
| apparently adding to the cash on hand. In !
this manner the reserve excess was Increased â 
no lees than $4,012,475, of which $1,1*3,900 came !
: from a gain In hpecle and legals, and $2,828,575 '
i from, the lessened 25 per cent requirement, due i
;to the contraction of $11,314,300 In deposits. As \
i a result of these changes the surplus reserve I
: now stands at $5,252,875. which does not com- !
pare as unfavorably with the average reserve
for this season in other years as might be i
Imagined. The strain on the banks Incident to I
i the settlement of the bond transactions Is prob- â 
i ably at an end, and the heavy liquidation which i
! decreased loans $30,000,000 during the month of
September will give way to a more moderate j
adjustment. It begins to look as though the !
New York banks will not be called upon to the 'â 
usual extent for crop money. Eighty millions I
of treasury deposits widely distributed are im- j
portant In this connection, and the recent rise :
I In rates in New York developed the fact that I
, Interior Institutions had plenty of money â¢to '
! loan at prevailing rates. Banks here having
heavy country business shew rather a large
falling off in deposits, but redlscountlng Is bald
to be small. The recent stringency ! has de
veloped an effort to enlarge circulation, and
the Increase of $507,400 for the week, based on
new 3 per cent bonds, was taken out principally
by two banks. The statement In detail shows I
that the heavier changes in totals were made â 
by a few of the larger banks, but decreases
were the rule through the list of sixty-five
Institutions.
. LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 24.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were lifeless to-day, business be
ing checked by the approach of the settlement
and by the Jewish holiday on Monday next.
In Americans the only feature was the buy- '
ing of Central Pacific and of Union Pacific by j
the continent. Grand Trunk was good on fa
vorable traffic reports and Argentines were
eaeler. There has been a sudden cessation
I In the demand for gold and New York orders
for - coin were canceled . to-day. The London
market discount rate- is 2 13-16 per cent, but
firm, however, In the Bank of England's con
trol. Money was In demand for next week.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 24.â Wheat to-day made a
further decline of %c. Speculative interest
was perhaps the chief reason for the decline.
Weak cables and confirmation of the heavy
French crop figures were bearish Influences.
Wheat . started at a slight "dec!lnÂ«, '; December
opening at 63H@63%c, compared -â  with I yester
day's closing price of 63% c. One or two small
pales were made at 68 T Immediately -after the
opening, but the market- began to decline :at
once under a moderate selling .< pressure - from
commission houses, 63%'9-63%c I being - quoted for
December before any, support of consequence
materialized." Liverpool wrÂ»s ' %Â©%c lower and
the readiness with which that market responded
to yesterday's decline, here was responsible for
part of the bearish feeling shown. Official es
timates of the French wheat â  crop made s the
total 31Â«.000,oyi bushels, against 214,000,000 bush
els last year, which was an additional reason
for the â  Inclination : to â¢ sell. Northwestern ' re
ceipts were liberal at 1091 cars, against 1112 last
week - and â¢ 1268 a year â¢ ago. r Chicago 'â¢â  receipt*
were 199 cars. 2 Cash s wheat i was â¢%c â  lower at

a further increase in Southwestern receipts was
looked for. After declining to 6S%@6S%c : there
THE SAN FBAN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1898.
was a little improvement in the demand, shorts
covering In a small way, and December reacted
to 63%(363 l >(iC. From that time until near the
close trading was excessively dull, and even
i seaboard reports of heavy clearances, which
j ordinarily would have a strengthening effect,
I were given little attention. Clearances from all
ports approximated 1,000,000 bushels. Export
business was reported small to-day. Toward
the close there was a slight increase in the
buying, owlnj: to a desire to even up over
Sunday, and the market became steadier, clos
ing %c lower.
Corn was a little higher, although there was
material Increase In trade. Cables were up,
Liverpool showing \<s%c advance. The mar
ket closed a shade higher.
Oats were as dull as corn, closing a shade
! higher.
Provisions were very flat and averaged some

NED IN CUBA
CHAPTER XI.
THE American army commanded
by General Shafter captured the
heights of El Caney on th-> mem
orable first day of July, l^ lS -
Upon that day the Hough Riders,
with the First and Tenth Infantry,
took San Juan, another suburb of San
tiago de Cuba, after desperate fight-
Ins, with heavy losses. During
this and the succeeding day the
American fleet, under the command of
Admiral Sampson, maintained a con
stant bombardment of the fortifications
of the city. Or. July 2 the Spaniards
made a desperate attempt to recap
ture San Juan, but were driven back.
The American successes were soon
known in Santiago City. It was de
cided on the evening of July 2 by Ad
miral Cervera, commanding the Span
ish squadron, to try to escape from the
harbor upon the following day. What
buy or girl has failed to be thrilled by
the story of how Commodore Schley's
chips drove the Spanish ships ashore
and destroyed the flotilla, Spain's
proud boast? What boy or girl of
America failed to think of the glorious
news on the Fourth of July? Santi
ago was doomed!
Binnie knew nothing of these events.
Hovering between life and death, he
was constantly attended by Julia and
by Harry Ostend. Julia's Joy at the
dawn of freedom from Spanish op
pression in Cuba was clouded by her
deep Borrow at the dancer of Binnie.
Two weeks passed before the surgeon
would say that Binnie had a chance to
recover. Then, a few days later, when
Binnie's strength seamed to be grow
ing, an order was sent out that he
should be moved as soon as possible
to the high hills beyond the fever
stricken region about Santiago. The
city had been surrendered to General
Shafter by General Toral, but Binnie
was unconscious of what was going on
around him. The Cubans were not
pleased because the Americans per
mitted the Spanish officers in Santiago
to control the civil government for the
time. Many Cubans had withdrawn
to a distance and there was dan^T
that they might oppose by force th<>
American soldiers and start a gruorriila
warfare. When General Shafter heard
that Julia would accompany Binnie as
a nurse, he sent to have her come to
his tent. He had work for her.
Julia was knnwn to many Cubans.

arms and ammunition with which
many Cuban mountaineers had been
equipped. Consequently, so reasoned
General Shafter, she must have the
confidence of the Cubans, and she
could do much good by taking to th>.m
his message of pood will and the as-
Burance that their interests and- wel
fare would be well looked after by the
Americans. Julia promptly accepted
the mission. With a letter of instruc
tions in her possession she left General
Shafter's headquarters. Soon after
she was walking beside the litter upon
which Binnie was carried out to the
healthier hills. Binnie improved rip
idly. His wounds healed as if hf
magic. He grew impatient to rej>ir.
the Rough Riders and to share in thoir
adventures.
"I do not wish to be classed as a de
serter or a shirk of duty," he said with
an impatient toss of his head.
"Have patience," was all the reply
that he could get to his teasing to be
allowed to resume his duties as a vol
unteer. Harry Ostond visited him
nearly every day. Finally Binnie was
told that he could go back to duty v.-ith
safety if he desired. Such :i whoop
Â«t joy as he uttered! But when he
learned that Santiago was occupied by
the Americans, that peace was prooa
b^e and that the Rough Riders and

other American soldiers would not be
called upon to fight any more in that
part of Cuba, at least for the prey-nt,
he was witling to listen to Julia's le
quest that he should accompany her
upon her mission to try to persuade
the Cubans that the Americans were
really their friends, which they hud
doubts, for a time after the fall cf
Santiago.
Harry Ostend sent word that he
would not be able to go with them. He
had aneady planned to make a voy
age to the Philippine Islands upon the
yacht California, anticipating that in
that far-off region he would find an
opportunity to -gratify his desire for ad
venture. Ned was with him once
more. Together they would go, so be
wiote to Binnle, to the United States,
to fit out the California Cor its long
voyige. "We will return soon a3
I iisaiMe," he concluded, "'and you w"l
thcr: go with us to make the acquain
tance- 'A Admiral Dewey and of the
Filipinos."
Julia's mission was to find General
Garcia of the Cuban army. He re
tired to the mountains directly after
the surrender of Santiago de Cuba, and
was in camp with his followers. Julia
found no difficulty in following the
mountain trails, and after traveling
some distance she and Binnie reached
their destination. They were ushered
into General Garcia's tent. Julia hand
ed to the General the .letter she had
received from General Shatter, Then
she introduced Binnie. X>
"So this is the young man?" asked
General Garcia, without offering to
take Binnie's friendly hand that was
reached out toward him. ' "Sentinel,
take this person and put him In the
guardhouse. See that he does not es
cape."
"General Garcia, what does this
mean?" asked Julia 'angrily, who was
astounded. .
"It means simply that the young
man whom you call Binnie is accused
of leading to their death a Company of
Cuban mountaineers, whose bodies
were found at the bottom of a canyon.
He will have a trial for his life."
"Binnie? Who accuses him? Who
dares accuse him?" : T.Â»"'- ViV i'
"Our trW-and true friend - Ramirez,
whom you well know." 1 :
"Ramirez! It was he who caused
the Cuban "mountaineers to be am
bushed and killed. Ramirez is a Span
ish spy. I speak of what I know.
Bring Ramirez before us and see what
he will say in our presence."
General Garcia called an attendant
and handed to him a note.
"Ramirez will be here directly, Julia,
and you will find that I have a desire
to treat Binnie fairly; but if half
that Ramirez says is true, you will find
it very difficult to save the life of this
young American traitor."
"Traitor! Then you have already
judged him and found him guilty? Is
that the fair play of which you boast?"
Before General Garcia coald make re
ply Ramirez entered the tent and was
facing Julia and Binnie. His old-time
hardihood had returned. After the
Spanish defeat was certain, he no
longer dreaded the Spanish wrath. His
first thoueht was to make his way to
the Cuban lines and tr* to justify his
acts with the Cubans. General Garcia
knew nothing of all the treachery of
Ramirez, and this the spy soon found
out. Having the confidence of Gen
eral Garcia, Ramirez accused Binnie
of causing the ambushing of the Cu
ban mountaineers, for whose coming
Garcia lons looked in vain. His
wicked thought was that this would
protect himself. His acting, now that
he suddenly faced those who best knew
of his perfidy, was characteristic of one
whcse whole life had been one of de
celt. Turning with an expression of
assumed contempt from Binnie to Gen

eral Garcia, Ramirez said:
"I congratulate you. General, upon
making this important capture. That
you may see that I have been correct
I recommend that the pockets of the
perfidious young American shall be
searched for evidence at once, before
he has the opportunity to destroy it."
"In that request," said Binnie, speak
ing for the first time since he had en
tered upon this surprising adventure,
"I heartily join. At the same time I
wish that you would search the pockets
of Ramirez."
"I have no objection," answered the
spy. "I have nothing to conceal."
"What do you expect that the pock
ets of Binnie will reveal?" asked Gen
eral Garcia, with an nr>nearance of
great interest.
"A writing. General, signed by Cap
tain General Blanco, authorizing the
bearer to steal away Julia."
Binnie appreciated the boldness of
this play; and also realized that he
was in real danger. The letter taken
by him from the pocket of a Spanish
soldier, after the encounter narrated in
the first chapter of this story, he still
had. He realized that it â¢ iri be dif
ficult to explain away this fact. Nev
ertheless, he boldly drew out the let
ter before the sentinel had a chance to
search him, and held it out with a de
fiant gesture.
"Here is the letter you seek. Please
read it and then permit me to ex
plain."
"You admit, then, that you have in
your possession a letter, written by
Captain General Blanco, in time ol
war?"
"Yes, but"
"You see, General Garcia, that I am
right so far. Now let me advise you a
little more. Julia is the friend of this
young man, which, under all these cir
cumstances, is a suspicious feet. Ask
her if she was not in the company of
the Spaniards who ambushed our
mountaineers at the time that they
were lured on to death."
"Julia, you hear the question," said
General Garcia.
"Yes. I was there, and so was Rami
rez."
"It is true. General, that I was there
also," said Ramirez "and I can add
that I was there as a prisoner, while
Julia was there willingly."
This terrible accusation was made by
Ramirez with great coolness. General
Garcia wan convinced.
"No more now," he eaid sternly.
"This is not the place to try the merits
of the case, but I have heard enough
to be satisfied that Ramirez has good
reason to make accusations. Let Bin
nie be taken to one end of the camp
and place Julia under guard at the
other end. I will assemble a court of
officers to-morrow. In the meantime,
Ramirez, remain in camp, for you will
undoubtedly be a valuable witness."
The reader will reflect that, up to this
time General Garcia had no reason to
suspect the fidelity of Ramirez. When
we first saw Ramirez hf> was trusted
by all the Cubans. After the battle
of the bridge he was not seen by any
of the Cubans until after the fall of
Santiago de Cuba. Of air the Cuban
mountaineers who rode upon the bridge
and fell into the canyon not one re
mained alive to accuse Ramirez. Con
cerning the acts of Ramirez in Santi
ago, there was no one to testify except
Binnie and Julia, and it was evident
that they would not be allowed to tell
any more than what concerned them
selves In their own defense. The story
told by Ramirez to General Garcia, in
explanation of his absence from the
Cuban army during the battle of Santi
ago, was that he had been taken into
the city as a prisoner by the Spaniards
and that he escaped only the day before
the city was surrendered. The spy felt
sure that he was at last safe, or would
be upon the death of Binnie and Julia,
which it was now his purpose to bring
about. D. H. W.

THE CIRCUS
IN GLENVILLE
BY LAWRENCE C. BEMENDERFER,
ANGELS CAMP
WHEN Louis Turner and James
Thayer heard that a circus
was going to exhibit in Glen
vllle they at once decided to
visit It. But as they lived on
a farm and Glenville was ten miles
away, they borrowed a horse and bug
gy and with five dollars in spending
money started early one morning. The
streets of the town were lined with
people and all along the road they
passed vehicles going in.
"I tell you, this suits me," remarked
Louis, as driving into the town they
saw the changing scenes on all sides.
:. .". ..â  â  : ~6Â£M< l^s- v '
"I like to see life and stir. It takes a
circus to wake up a farming country
and bring out the people. Just look
at the streets now and imagine how
deserted they generally are."
Tying the horses, they stood on the
sidewalk in the midst of a crowd and
watched the parade pass, and were sur
prised at its size, for the bills make
much of little. But in this case they
hardly described the splendid menag
erie and many features.
Going to the grounds the boys bought
tickets and visited the menagerie, and
later the side shows, of which there
were three in sight. The ticket sellers
were all shouting at once, describing
the various attractions of the different
tents. "Don't leave without seeing the
wild man; great and only wild man."
"The dwarf and the giant."
"The snake charmer of India. All
here in this tent. Only thirty cents!"
shouted a man near by.
"Let's get tickets?" whispered James.
So, buying tickets, they were soon
feasting their eyes on the dwarf and
giant, the "great and only wild man"
and the snake charmer of India. While
standing by, a man remarked that the
circus was " a sell." He had not seen
some of the exhibits, especially the fat
man. Louis could not help remarking
that the fat man was in the other tent.
Strolling about the grounds in com
pany with several boys of their age
PUZZLE PICTUREâ TO WHAT ' CITY ARE THESE SOLDIERS MARCHING?
they at length came to another.
"Walk up, young gentlemen. Only
ten cents to see the greatest thing in
the world. Ten cents, ten cents!"
shouted the ticket man.
"I guess I'll buy one," said a person
near by, and the boys saw the man of
the circus tent.
"I am never too poor to see the great
est thing in the world. What do you
say to buying tickets, fellows? I have
some money left," impulsively declared
James.
The boys agreed. On entering the
tent they were surprised to see only a
tall man dressed as Uncle Sam, seated
at a table on a raised platform. Be
fore him lay a mallet and cup. At one
side was a long white line marked on
the hard ground and opposite was an
other like it.
"I don't call this the greatest thing
in the world," angrily remarked Louis
to the man who stood near by.
"That is because you do not under
stand the fundamental principles. Now
this man," pointing toward Uncle Sam,
"is simply the umpire. If you wish
to earn a handsome medal deposit fifty
cents in that cup. Try to jump from
one line to the other. If you don't suc
ceed your money is returned. If you
do, you are rewarded."
This seemed fair enough and the boys
each put fifty cents in the cup. James
and Louis were first to try, stepping
back a few paces and measuring the
distance. They ran forward and
vaulted into the air. James touched
the lino, but Louis went fa' 1 eyond
it, and on asking for his reward James
was handed only a pasteboard medal,
while Louis received a souvenir.
"So this is the way you treat people
who win fairly. I reached the line,
while Louis went beyond it."
"Well," replied Uncle Sam, "I only
did him justice, and while many may
earn pasteboard medals, if you would
win one of value, jump beyond the line.
Try again."
But they did not. No, they left at
once and the man they remembered
longest was he who, dressed as Uncle
Sam, had "umpired the game."
"Now, Harry," asked the teacher of
the juvenile class, "what is the meal we
eat In the morning called?"
"Oatmeal." was the little fellow's
prompt reply.
OLD TALE
BACKWARD
BY NELLIE HAYNES.
THE watermelon fields of Lodi were
rich with frultc ge. Huge melons,
Juicy and inviting, covered much
of the ground from which they
had sprung. Into one of these
fields little Hatty wandered, dreaming
of Cinderella.
"But of course there is no such
thing nowadays," she said.
"How do you know that?"
Hatty was surprised. There was no
one in sight to account for the voice.
No one? There was a big toad, wink
ing and blinking lazily.
'Hatty," said the Toad, "You are
a foolish little girl."
There was no doubt now that the
Toad spoke, and Hatty at once knew
that the Toad must be a fairy.
"Why am I foolish?"
The Toad chuckled. "Foolish people
are those who jump at conclusions."
"And you?" asked Hatty, mis
chievously.
"Iâ wellâ lâ ha ha! That is a good
one on me. But I don't really jump. I
only hopâ and I don't hop at conclu
sions."
"What then?"
"Oh, I onjy hop at choice family hops
â dances, don't you knowâ under the
hop vine. Come on. There will be a
hop now."
"Buti cannot go to a dance on foot."
The Toad touched a gourd vine,
which immediately began to race along
the ground. He then touched a great
melon, and lo and behold! it suddenly
turned into a coach, lined with the fin
est pink satin, and the seeds turned
into footmen and trolley men.
"To the dance by trolley," laughed
the Toad, as he attached the coach to
the moving gourd vine. Then he
hopped into the coach and they were
off in fine style.
Such a party! All the bullfrogs and
toads in the neighborhood were there.
They danced just as boys play leapfrog
â Jumping over each other's shoulders,
and the crickets and night owls made
music. Hatty laughed heartily at the
antics. By and by a clock struck
twelve and Hatty knew that it was
midnight. Then what happened? The
toads and the frogs turned suddenly
into the mogt lovely little ladles and
gentlemen imaginable and, in place of
their everyday dresses, they were at
tired in silks and satins and laces; and
the gowns of the ladies glittered with
diamonds â which had been dewdrops,
but were changed by magic into dia
monds. The music becatne soft and
lovely, and when & beautiful little cav
alier, holding his white plumed hat in
one hand and bowing very low, asked
her to dance with him she could not re
fuse.
The other fairies addressed Hatty's i
cavalier as "Dear Prince," and Hatty
was naturally happy to think that a
fairy prince should thus honor her. By <
and by there was a banquet under an
arbor of hop vines. They ate and drank '
and sang and paw the man in the moon (
grinning through the horÂ» vines at so i
much jollity. Hatty lost one of her
glovi -'s. But when she mentioned it I
there was a great shout of: "Cinder
ella story told backward."
Off they all ran, leaving Hatty alone.
She looked for her missing glove, but
cr.-uld not find it. That was two years
ago.
On last Admission day Hatty found
the glove and it was filled with rare
candies. She picked the glove up under
the hop vine arbor. The candies were
fresh and she believes that the fairy
prince has had it all this time and has
taken this way to assure her that he
remembers and loves her still.

"Tell me," said the teacher, "what is
the difference between wrought iron
and cast iron?"
"Well," replied Will, smiling, "the
shoe -worn by a horse is a wrought iron
shoe, but when the horse loses the shoe .
from its foot it becomes a cast iron
shoe."
"Why, Clara," said a mother to her
little daughter, who was crying, "what
are you crying about?" "C-cause,"
sobbed the little miss, "I s-started to

You poor little raggedy woman, you,
I feel very sorry for you, I do,
With your raggedy dress and your rag

Poor little raggedy woman.
I often wonder as you pass by,
If the dear, good Lord who lives in the

Will let you stay ragged until you die-
Poor little raggedy woman.
And every day I think a lotâ
I guess your husband's a drunken sot,
And you think he's all in the world you've

Poor little raggedy woman.
If I had a husband like yours must be
I'd send him a-llying over the sea,
And I'd never let him come bark to meâ
Poor little raggedy woman.
But I s'pose you'll ever be the same,
Ashamed of your home aqd ashamed of
your name.
And you'll always hang your head in
shame-

FATE OF
CORDELIA
BY DOROTHEA A. MEITMULLER,
SOME years ago, on the shores of a
strange land, in a castle called the
Crystal Castle, there lived an old
witch, who had the power of
transforming herself. All people
called her Ugly Cordelia, because she
was the ugliest creature in the land.
Now, not far from the Crystal Castle
was the Golden Palace, in which lived
the beautiful Princess Grace â the peo
ple called her Beautiful Grace. She was
but ten years old and lived contentedly
with her father, King Bertram; tier
mother, Queen Ellen, and her brother.
Prince Sylvan. Now, Ugly Cordelia
hated Beautiful Grace, because of her
beauty, and she wished to get rid of
her, and one day her chance came.
Prince Sylvan was very sick and Ugly
Cordelia knew she could cure him. So
she went to King Bertram and told
him she could cure Prince Sylvan.
The King was overjoyed and asked
her what she wished in payment for
such deed. She told him that if he
wanted her to cure his son he must
promise that after his son was w^ll he
would allow her to come .to the palace
and be a nurse to Beautiful Grace. The
King, who did not know Ugly Cordelia,
for she had transformed herself into a
lovely woman, readily gave his consent.
So, when the son was well, Ugly Cor
delia became a nurse to Beautiful
Grace. One night Prince Sylvan heard
Ugly Cordelia say to herself:
"To-morrow night, at half-past ten,
I shall take Grace into the forest and
let her be devoured by the beasts."
Now, the next night at the oppointed
time the Prince Sylvan and one hun
dred and fifty soldiers went into the
forest. When Ugly Cordelia and the
sleeping Princess entered the. Prince
seized his little sister from the arms of
the witch, and the witch was seized by
the one hundred and fifty soldiers and
brought before the King, who ordered
her to be taken to the forest and be
devoured by the beasts instead of his
innocent little one.
A PUZZLE OF WORDS.
BY JAMES L PEQUIGNOT.
Some people know I use such very bfe
words s
That I never can tell what they mean-
They may talk all day. but whatever they
Is in words that I've not heard or seen.
I heard a man talk of com-per-end-i-na
tlons;
Poor fellow! he Just meant delays-
When our principal spoke of his con-grat
u-la-tions â  â¢
We supposed he was tending his praise.
Our teacher once spoke of a great con
fla-gra-tion;
Now, who'd have thought. of a fire?
And when she said something about in
dig-na-tion
I judged from her looks she meant ire.
What do men speak of pep-e-gri-na-tion
When they mean they are going- to
roam?
And why do they talk of thetr ln-hab-i-ta
tion
When it takes much less time to cay
home?
Why people will speak in a language un
known
I shall never be able to see;
Why they don't talk in a tongue of their
own
Is the greatest of puzzles to me.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The current mining news that is pub
lished from day to day and from week to
week has more importance than Is popu
larly attached to it, and often it has more
importance than is measured by the
amount of space the news Is given In this
or any other column of any paper or the
extent to which "heads" are devoted to
it. The current mining news concerning
California is a constant record of new de
velopment work, new mills, new mining
power plants, new processes and, most
important of all. new Investments of cap
ital. This or any other record of mining
development in California gives but a
Email part of the news of mining progress
in the State. It would not b<? possible to
make up much of a news column concern
ing failures of mines and abandonment of
mining ventures. These occur now and
then, but numerically ajid financially they
are a very small traction of the legiti
mate mining news of the day from week
to week. The news Is news of progress.
Old and abandoned mines are everywhere
being reopened and new mines are every
where coming to the front. The dry sea
son ha*s put a heavy and crushing hand
on productive operations almost every
where throughout the State, hanging up
stamps, silencing hydraulic giants and
postponing for a year the building of
millF. etc., but still the prospecting, ex
ploitation and development oi new prop
erties has gone on with hut little impedi
ment because the phenomenally dry year
has not weakened faith in the California
gold fields, however much It may have re
duced the gold output for 1898.
Among the items of miring news that
have been presented at the front during
the week is one that gives the possi
bility that still another mineral resource
has been added to the incomparable list
that is California's. No other State or
section of contiguous States presents the
variety of mineral resources that Cali
fornia does. This now thing is a possible
discovery of molybdenum, and the facts
of the discovery are thus told by the
Kern County Echo:
"81 Droullard. the well-known miner.
Marshal Baker and H. Vincent Wallace,
the assayer, have arrived home from a
prospecting of several weeks in the high
SUrras at the head of Kings River In
Fresno County. They paw much wild
mountain country, peaks higher than
Wnltney, numerous laJtcs, plenty of feed
and considerable mineral. The prime ob
ject of their trip, it appears, was to llnd
and locatea molybdenum mine. They found
it, and plenty of it. too. This mineral is
very rare arid said to be worth about $i'
an ounce. It is used for certain kinds of
painting. They claim that this is the rirst
to be discovered in California."
Molybdenum la one of the rare clommts
and lttÂ» dissemination among the works of
nature is small. It Is found In small
quuntltiea. and generally occurs in veina
of granite or gneiss or disseminated
through these rocks. Its occurrence has
been noted in a number of places in the
United States, but its production is main
ly limited to Sweden, where it has been
found in the grtsatest state of purity and
under condition* most favorable for eco
nomic production. It often occurs as a
sulphide, or "yellow lead ore." which is
properly "molybdenite," The use of this
metal Is largoly in chemical laboratories,
and It Is also used as an alloy as Is
tungsten and other rare metals. It is only
recently that the metal has obtained any
commercial importance, but this import
ance is likely to greatly increase. Min
eral Industry for the past two years does
not give its price, and It Is not a metaJ
included in current quotation?, but Min
eral Industry for ISO 4 gives its price at
$1 for ten grams. Molybdenum will never
add millions to the wealth of California,
but the possibility of its occurrence is in
teresting as adding to the Incomparable
list of California minerals.
J. H. Means, who has been for a good
while one of the able staff of field depu
ties attached to the State Mining Bureau,
has returned from a stay of several weeks
in Santa Barbara County, where he has
been studying the asphalt formations of
the region about Mount Plnal and Mount
Solomon. The region which he has stud
led geographically is about three by live
miles In size and is an Interesting one.
He has made a topographical and geo
logical map of the region, and his map
and a bulletin thereon will be published
as soon as the condition of the office of
the State Printer will permit. Mr. Means
was for some years an assistant to Pro
fessor Brauner. who now occupies the
chair of geology at Stanford, when he
was the State Geologist of Arkansas, and
his services to the State Mining Bureau
have been of marked ability and value.

The old Spencer mine on Humbug is
rapidly coming to the front again. For
a long time this property was one of the
best gold producers in the county. The
water has been pumped out of the shaft
and sinking has been commenced. In thÂ«
phaft there Is a three and a half foot
ledge, while In the drift it is eighteen
inches. The ore mills $14 In free gold and
carries a large amount of high-grade sul
phurets.âYreka Journal.
This weÂ»k G. L. Bailey of Dedrick sold
the Stanley-Helone group of mines owned
by him in that district to A. G. Hubbard
of Redlands. This group of mines Is sit
uated near the Chloride-Baiiey mines, in
the same quartz belt, and recent develop
ments have shown up a good body of ore.
A force of men have been put to work.
an 4 the mine will be opened up and thor
oughly developed, and a milling plant
erected on the property. The Canyon
Creek district is snowing ur as one of the
best quartz sections in Northern Califor
nia, and we predict a brilliant future for
the camp.â Trinity Journal.
Frye & Macauley are putting up a j
! new quartz mill on Cherry Creek, and
when completed, will cruah quartz from
Hunter's Cherry Hill mine. They have
also pur.chase<l a quartz mine from
Ironsides, which they intend developing,
so as to get out more quartz for their
mill, to keep it running steadily.â Yreka
Journal.
The Consolidated Gold Mines of Califor
nia, the London company which owns a
number of valuable properties in Butte
county, affords the following current
news items:
"The English syndicate which controls
the 'Banner mine." noar Oroville, has de
cided to expend $250,000 in deepening <he
shaft 1000 feet more. The shaft Is now
down 1300 fâ¬-et and has a three-foot per
pendicular ledge In slate which runs from
seven to e^ght Inches in ore. The superin
tendent hopes that the new shaft will de
velop the gold ledge to its full width. If
this be accomplished the output will be
enormous. The mine has hardly paid
expenses for sonfe rears.
H. Francis and others of San Francisco |
have bought the Buchanan Hill mine in !
Butte County. Concerning It the Orovills \
Mercury says: The Buchanan Hill Is j
one of the oldest drift gravel mines in j
this se-ction. ami was profitably worked j
many years ago. At present a tunnel is i
being driven to tap the channel at its j
lowest point, and this tunnel will be j
driv^j ahead Steadily until the gravol in '.
reacnvd. New buildings will be erected :
on the property, new andjnodern ma-chin- :
cry ertx-ted, and the mirVc^will no doubt
become a gold producer at an early date. I
The Jubilee Gold Mining Company are |
erecting a 40 horsepower steam engine j
and a four-drill compressor. When com- ;
pleted this company will be in a good
position to rapidly drift their main tunnel
to intersect the old Hazel Dell vein. The I
tunnel is now entered some 400 feet, and \
90 feot still remain before the intersection
of the vein.â PlacVrville Nugget.
Among the Improvements contemplated I
by the Blue Lakes Water Company are j
a larger reservoir and a new ditch. The
ditch is to have an elevation some eighty I
I higher than the present one. These im- i
i provements and other incidentals will
! cost upward of $400,000. We are informed
', that English and Eastern capitalists arÂ«
; interested in the enterprise. When these |
i Improvements shall have been llnlshed j
I a new and larger electric plant will be '
! built at White's Bar. on the Mokelumne
River, about three miles above the site
of the present one.â Amador Republican. '
The old Telurium mine bids fair to come I
to the front under the management of '
! Oakland parties. The water in the Mok- j
! elumne River being exceptionally low, i
river bed mining Is carried on to consider- I
I able advantage with, we are told, fair !
i results. Ore to the amount of about 160 i
: tons from the Potazuba mine was recent- 'â â 
ly milled at the Zeila. Returns from |
i Selby & Co. show that it yielded $3825, j
; besides $200 worth of snilphurets. The re- \
i suit, equal to $27 per ton. Is gratifying to i
j all concerned. San Francisco capitalists I
who are developing the Douglass mine in j
the Volcano district appear to feel confl- i
dent of ultimate success. The new shaft j
is down about 217 feet, and the old So- i
racco shaft has been partly cleaned out.
The total expenditure so far amounts to '
a trifle over $20,000. It Is said that the |
work of development will go steadily for- j
ward without interruption.â Amador Re- |
