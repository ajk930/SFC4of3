SUNK IN BERNER
BAY WITH CREW
AND PASSENGERS
Alaskan Steamship Clara Nevada Re=
ported to Have Gone Down With
All on Board.
THE STEAMER CLARA NEVADA.
SEATTLE, Feb. 14.â Meager details
on the loss of the steel steamer Clara
Nevada have been received here from
I'pnaimo, B. C. Th? Clara Nevada left
Pfcaguay for Juneau on her home trip
{o Seattle, and when off Skyward City.
Pmruw : Bay, about thirty miles south
I ;>. Bhe was seen by the reef-
dents of Seyward City to Vl^V 1^ all ablaze,
a mass of hungry flames. While the
â¢â¢^^ig wharf at Berner Bay was crowd
* ed with spectators of the awful scene,
a loud report was heard, -which re
;,led the explosion of boilers, and
i thing more was seen of the ill-fated
steamer.
It is feared the unfortunate forty
passengers and the entire crew arc
lost as no trace could be found of tb^m
along the beach of Berner Bay. The
sea was rough and a furious gale was
blowing. It is thought the vessel was
trying to make Berner Bay for shel
ter.
The steamer Inlander, for Victoria,
called to-day at Union, whence Captain
Irving telegraphed the news of the dis
aster. He sent word that the Clara Ne
vada was reported to have been on fire
and to have disappeared after a great
explosion on board in the neighborhood
of Seyward, fifty miles north of Juneau.
The beach in the vicinity of Beyward
is strewn with wreckage, freshly paint
ed like the woodwork of the Clara Ne
vada. This wreckage was seen by Cap
tain Thomas Lathan of the steamship
Coleman, lately at Juneau from Skag
uay.
On the evening of February 5 George
Beck and wife of Seyward City saw a
â mall steamer proceeding slowly
against a head wind well out in the
channel, and while they watched its
efforts to make headway the vessel
broke out Into flames. This vessel was
unquestionably the Clara Nevada. The
pea was very rough, so that those on
board would have had very littlechance
to make shore anywhere in boats. The
fire was seen by many other residents
of Seyward City.
This was the first trip of the Clara
Nevada, and she was due to leave
Seattle last Saturday on her second
trip, with all berths sold. The steamer
Rustler had left for the scene, but no
report from her is obtainable.
The Clara Nevada was formerly the
steamer Hassler of the United States
Coast Survey Service, and was sold
last August to MeGuire Bros, of this
city, who refurnished and overhauled
her for the Alaska trade. She was on
h^r way from Skagurty to Juneau and
had forty passengers on board. She
was a three-masted schooner, rigged
without gaff 3. She was of 319 tons bur
flrn, VM feet l'>ng, 24 feet beam and 10
'. -pp depth. She was built in 1872
at Camdcn, N. J. When inspected the
boi!Â»rs of tho Clara Nevada stood a
cold water pressure of 146 pounds,
equal to 200 pounds steam pressure.
She had a steel hull fitted with five
transverse air-tight bulkheads. She
cost the McGuires $15,000 and they
upent $15,000 more on her alterations.
Fhe was considered entirely seaworthy
and was given a first-class rating.
In the reports of the loss of the Clara
Nevada it is stated that the steamship
left Skaguay on her return trip to Se
attle on February 5. W. W. McGulre
says that he has positive knowledge
that the steamship had not reaohed
Bkaeuay on February .4. McGulre does

not believe it possible for the Nevada
to have left on the sth. There does not
seem to be any doubt about a vessel
being lost, he says, but there is a pos
sibility that it may not be the one re
ported.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 14.â Captain
C. H. Lewis, of the steamer Clara Ne
vada, has been in the employ of the
< Togon Railway and Navigation Com
pany and the Pacific Coast Steamship
i 'ompany for twenty years. At differ
ent times he has commanded the
steamer George W. Elder, the Willam
ette, the Idaho and the Michigan. Last
August he attempted to take the stern
wheel steamer Eugene from this city
to St. Michael, but met disaster on
Vancouver Island.
G. Foster Beck, the purser and one of
the owners of the Clara Nevada, was
one of the best known young men in
this city, having lived here the greater
portion of his life. He was about 28
y^ars of age and was the son-in-law of
Mrs. R. L. Hawthorne, probably the
wealthiest woman in Portland.

New Cannery for Hanford.
HANFORD, Feb. 14.â At a meeting of
fruit growers and citizens to-day 1000 tons
of fruit for canning purposes was guar
anteed to Fontana & Co, and a site for
their cannery to be built in Hanford was
pledged the company. Fontana was pres

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NELSON, B. C. Feb. 14.-The steamer
Nelson arrived this evening from Kuska
nook, a new town at the head of Koote
nay Lake, formerly Goat River Landing
and brought the body of Dennis Connors!
who was foully murdered on Sunday
night. The facts of the case so far as
learned are: The murdered man, who
was a teamster in the employ of con
tractors for the Crows Nest Pass Railway
Construction Company, was sitting in the
barroom of Erickson's Hotel, when a
man known here as Doyle and in Ross
land as Sullivan entered the place. With
out any provocation Doyle drew a re
volver and pointing it at Connors said:
"Dig up or I'll shoot you."
Connors replied: "Fire away." Doyle
immediately fired. Connors fell dead
without a groan, with a smile on his face.
Doyle fled from the house.
Constable Ford, who is acting in Con
stable Jarvis" absence on special duty in
Nelson, arrived on the scene about five
minutes later and at once started out in
search of the murderer along the toll
road to O'Leary's place", along the route
of the Crows Nest Pass Construction
road. Although a strict search was made
no trace of the murderer could be found

QUIETING DOWN
M. FERNAND LABORIE, Counsel for Zola.
AROUSED BY
THE EXPOSE
IN THE CALL
Hilborn Will Cause a Thorough
Investigation of the Defective
Shrapnel Scandal.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14. â
Representative Hilborn to-day
introduced in the House of Rep
resentatives his resolution di
recting the Committee on Mili
tary Affairs to make an investi
gation into the matter of defec
tive shrapnel furnished to the
army by private contractors.
This matter is creating great
Interest in army and navy cir
cles and in Congressional cir
cles as well. Copies of The Call
containing accounts of the fail
ure of the shrapnel at the Pre
sidio have been brought to the
attention of Congressmen and
army officers.
Members of Congress believe it to be
a very serious matter and are in favor
of an investigation. Congressman Hil
born said to The Call correspondent
to-night "The results of the tests of
the shrapnel at the Presidio, when i>o
per cent of the ammunition was found
to be unserviceable, cannot be passed
by without notice. It is too serious a
matter. It Is true that war is not im
minent, but 'in time of peace prepare
for war.' And In no way can we pre
pare for war more effectually than by
devising means for certain delivery of
perfect ammunition and stores in case
of war.
"It appears that we have purchased
and paid for a considerable amount of
shrapnel which is worthless. This
means either that the inspection by
our army experts was faulty, at the
time of delivery, or that the materfal
has deteriorated in a very brief period
so as to become useless. In either case
there should be a thorough investiga
tion. If the army officers are careless
in making tests of material received
from contractors they should be taught
to be more vigilant, and if the ammu
nition we are accepting is manufac
tured according to a faulty formula
and lacks stability so that it becomes
worthless in a few years we should
know that also. If war comes we do
not want to be in the condition in
which France found herself when her
war with Germany commenced. Her
army marched to slaughter instead of
war because of the insufficiency of the
war material furnished by dishonest
contractors.
"Whenever practicable the Govern
ment itself should manufacture its war
material. Then there will be no
temptation to furnish unserviceable
ammunition. The cost may be a little
more, but it will pay in the end. We
recognize this in the manufacture of
our navy guns and make them at our
ordnance shop in Washington, with our
own skilled men. They are not only
the best guns in the world of the;r
kind, but they are made so cheaply
that no private contractor thinks of
competing for the work.
"In the matter of powder, our posi
tion is peculiar. When we used the old
black and brown powders made of sal-
I neter. sulphur and charcoal, the Gov
ernment purchased Its powder in the
open market from some of the hun
dreds of manufacturers of that pow
der in this country. When, however,
we required a special kind of brown
and black prismatic powder for our
high-power guns, which had to be
made under great pressure, we had
trouble to get contractors to bid for
its manufacture.
"Secretary Long in his last report
complains of the lack of competition
in the manufacture of powder by pri
vate manufacturers. We have now,
however, reached the point when the
brown and black powders must be
abandoned, if we propose to keep up
with the other nations. Smokeless pow
der is the powder of the future. It has
45 per cent more power and is not so
destructive to the gun; it aoes not ioui
the gun, and the operation of swabbing
Is dispensed with. But its great ad
vantage is that it is smokeless. The
ship using brown powder will after the
first fire be fighting in a cloud of
smoke, while her enemy, using smoke
less powder, will not have her view
obscured. The ship enveloped in a
cloud of smoke must necessarily shoot
wildly and become an easy prey to the
torpedo, which she â¢will be unable to
discover and avoid. Our navy experts
have worked out the problem at the
experiment station at Newport, and
have obtained formula for a smokeless
powder of great energy, which is stable
and will not deteriorate for years un
der any conditions of heat or cold, dry
ness or moisture. This was a great tri
umph and reflects credit upon our na
val officers. This r.mokeless powder is
equal if not superior to any powder in
the world for ship use. It has no nitro
glycerine in it, which makes it a desir
able powder for ships. The powder
used by the army, called Payton pow
der (in honor of its inventor, Bernard
Payton, superintendent of the Califor
nia Powder Works at Santa Cruz) has
forty parts of nitro-glycerine. The
army officers do not object to this and
find this safe on the land. But there
is some volatilization of nitro-glycerine
from the mass, resulting in a deposition
of free nitro-glycerine upon the cooler
surface of the powder mass. The vola
tilization will be accelerated in the hot
magazines of the ship.
"The army powder of which nitro
glycerine is a component part is deemed
unsafe to use in ships. The smokeless
powder adopted by the ordnance de
partment of the bureau is made wholly
of gun cotton of high nitration. It is
called pyro-celluloise. This powder
possesses remarkable properties. A
splinter of it may be lighted and when
in full flame may be blown out with a
breath. But fired in a high-power gun
it takes on another character. Two
powder manufacturers in this country
have undertaken to produce powder ac
cording to this formula, which has only
been perfected within the last year.
These companies are the Dupont
Powder Works of Wilmington, Del.,
and the California Powder Works of
Santa Cruz. The California company
has turned out a product which is pro
nounced fully up to the standard, but
has as yet delivered none to the Gov

PARIS, Feb. 14.â A remarkable
change Is manifest to-day in the
demeanor of the public toward
Emile Zola.. In the crowds of
people who collected outside the
Palais de Justice there could not
have been more than a dozen
or so at most who went with the
intention of making demonstra
tions in favor of or against Zola.
The impression obtained by the
Herald correspondent, who was
present outside the court from
the time of Zola's arrival until
his departure at half-past 5, was
one of calm â such absolute calm
that one almost wondered if hos
tile intentions had ever been
shown by the public toward the
novelist. At 10 o'clock there were
few people In the Galerie de
Harley facing the Place Dau
phine, and when Zola arrived
at 12 o'clock at Quai dcs Orfev
riers the number was not percep
tibly increased. He was greeted
with a few cries of "A has Zola"
and "Vive Zola," with an accom
paniment of whistles from a
small body of anti-Semites,
but it is a notable fact that there
were no cries of "Vive l'armee"
when the military witnesses ar
rived.
As the day wore on the num
ber of people increased, and
there must have been at least
20,000 on the various quays and
Place Dauphine. To-day being
a Paris workmen's holiday, a
great part of these were arti
sans, who sauntered along the
boulevard with glances of curi
osity through the large gilded
gates at the main entrance to
the Palais, then along Quai de
l'Horloge, where a company of
soldiers were on picket duty,
back to the Place Dauphine,
and thence to Quai dcs Orfe
vriers. thus making a complete
circuit of the Palais de Justice.
An incident in the afternoon pro
vided a matter of much gossip.
Prince Henri d'Orleans pre
sented himself at the court, but
was refused entrance because he
was not provided with a special
permit.
As Zola left there came from
Quai de la Messagerie the sound
of whistles. About a dozen anti-
Semites had taken up a position
on the parapet of the quay and
did not lose this opportunity of
demonstrating, at a distance,
against Zola. Now the question
arises to what can we attribute
this change from the vociferous
demonstrations of last week? It
is suggested that the answer can
be only one of two things â either
the police previously employed
agents or provocateurs who are
now withdrawn, or the public
feeling toward Zola has been in
fluenced in his favor by the
reading of the reports of the
trial.
PARIS, Feb. 14.â When the trial of
M. Zola and Perreux was resumed to
day M. Jaures, the socialist member of
the Chamber of Deputies, was recalled
and reiterated his belief in the culpabil
ity of Major Esterhazy.
The examination of It Bertlllon, the
handwriting expert, was then resumed.
He said he thought it impossible to ask
the Minister for War for the incrimi
nating documents seized at the resi
dence of Dreyfus in 1894, which, accord
ing to the testimony of the witness on
Saturday last, would enable him to
prove that Dreyfus wrote the border
eau.
M. Laborie, counsel for M. Zola,
thereupon protested, and twitted M.
Bertillon with being unwilling to tes
tify in court, while giving interviews
to newspapers.
M. Bertillon said the interviews were
""Being pressed by M. Laborie to tell
how unless he had seen the secret doc
uments, he was able to prove at court
martial that Dreyfus wrote the border
eau. M. Bertlllon answered that he2
could not explain without documents,
which were no longer In his possession.
This statement caused a sensation in
court, and M. Laborie demanded that
the Advocate-GeWal compel the wit
ness to reply. The Advocate-General
made no answer. ,
Finally M. Bertillon. who Persisted
in not answering questions, left tne
witness-stand amid considerable up
roar, M. Laborie remarking: And that
is the man upon whose evidence Drey
fus was convicted." T, flwrit- nTl
â  M Teyssonnieres, another handwrit
ing expert, testified to identif>ing the
handwritins of the bordereau a that
of Dreyfus. He added that the fac
simile had been blurred so as to make
it resemble Esterhazy s. ..
Later the witness created a, sensa
tion by testifying that friends of Drey
fus had approached him and had
fe^SS Crepleu-
Si n med Sa?the only foundation he the
mitted that the only
insinuation was his personal impres
sion and that no- bribe had actually
been offered to him. Minister of Jus-
M Trarieux, former Minister of Jus
tice threw such suspicion upon all tne
evidence given by M. Teyssoniere that
the latter left the bar much discredited.
At the opening of the hearing to-day,
M Laborie made an impassioned per
sonal statement, refuting allegations
of La Libre Parole that he was of Ger
man origin and his wife a Jewess. M.
Laborie admitted that his wife vas
English, but denied that she was a
Jewess As for himself, he said he was
born at Rheims, and that his father
was a Frenchman, employed on the
eastern railway, who had been deco
rated with the Legion of Honor and
congratulated by General de Bois
deffres fc-r services rendered in 18 <0.
M. Bertillon gave his absurd evi
dence, while displaying a fantastic dia
gram, atnid continuous shrieks or.
laughter. ~**^_ .
After fruitless â¢efforts to obtain in
telligible testimony from this witness
,M Laborie turned to the jury and
said: "The whole case against Drey
fus stands before you. They had him
and the bordereau."
The remaining evidence was rather
uninteresting. The testimony of M.
Trarieux and the cross-examination of
M. Teyssoniere elicited that the latter
was dismissed from the office of an ex
pert- in the war office because he was
suspected of enabling the Matin to
publish the bordereau. M. Teyssoniere
went to the War Office for an explana
tion, but was threatened with arrest if
he came apain. Moreover, he was dis
missed from the post of expert to a
civil tribunal for the offense of over
charging a client.
Altogether the day was rather fa
vorable for M. Zola. It is rumored that
a report from Judge Bertulus, who has
been inquiring into recent developments
in the Dreyfus case, will be produced
and read in court to-morrow, dealing
with unpublished letters of Count Es
terhazy. It is likely to cause a sensa
tion.
â¢^AL Milliard, Minister of Justice, sum
moned M. Bertulus this. afternoon and
they had a long â¢ conference. It ap
pears that the juryman in the present
trial who retired on account of illness
was a contract M. Leblond, employed
by the Rothscifilds, and his illness was
caused by theihreatening letters he re
ceived, a significant indication of the
outside influence brought to bear on the
jury.
M. Laborle's wife was formerly the
wife of the famous pianist, Bachman.
Before the marriage she was Miss Mag
gie Okey. She was born in Australia,
is herself a fine pianist and has played
at concerts in England.
M. Peleir, one of. the expert?, read a
Fummnry of his report, which held that
the bordereau might have been written
by either Dreyfus or Esterhazy.
The crowd outside the court was
much calmer to-day.
M. Papillaud, editor of La Libre
Parole, has challenged M. Jauroz, the
socialist leader, to a duel, owing to a
quarrel that has grown out of the Zola
trial.
COUNT ESTERHAZY'S
DIRE PREDICTIONS.
Says if Dreyfus Were to Return to
France the Jews Would Be
Massacred.
NEW YORK, Feb. 14.â A morning
paper prints on interview with Count
Esterhazy, in which he makes this pre
diction: "If Dreyfus were ever to pet
foot in France again thpre would be
one iiundred thousand corpses of Jews
on the soil. If Zola is acquitted there
will be a revolution in Paris. People
will put me at their head in a massa
cre of the Jews."

Two men entered the grocery-store of
William Beckman, on the corner of Sixth
and Bryant streets last evening and,
without paries-, presented a revolver at
his head. Beckman held up his hands
and was ordered to turn his face to the
wall. When he turned his eyes round he
found the robbers gone, as was also a
bottle of choice schnapps.
G. Monnier, liquor-dealer, 1152 Howard
street, was also a sufferer by thieves last
night. A man fame into his store and
asked for change for a 120 gold piece.
While the change was being counted he
snatched a purse in the hands of Mon
nier and disappeared in the darkness The
fellow secured $4.. by his bold trick
Both cases were reported to the police
who expect to land the three robbers in
Jail to-day.
THE RATIONS INCREASED.
Sergeant Wolf Detailed to Supervise
the Feeding of Prisoners.
Chief Lees is determined that in future
the prisoners confined In the City Prison
shall have sufficient to eat. Yesterday
he specially detailed Sergeant Wolf to
visit the prison during meal hours and

The prisoners confined in cell 27 were
agreeably surprised when Sergeant Wolf,
accompanied by the priÃon cook, walked
down the main corridor, the cook carry-
Ing in his arms an abundance of food.
Wolf saw that the prisoners got suf
ficient to eat, much to their delight.
After the men were fed the cook was
locked up in the kitchen so as to prevent
him from Importuning the unfortunate

Head of the PolioÂ© Department
Says It Shall Be
Closed.

Recent Order of Mayor

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 14.â The mettle
of Sacramento's new Chief of Police
has been put to the test, and the result
of the first assay 6ho\vs material well
tempered, vigorous, and with a ring to
it which harbors evil to wrongdoers.
There is not a gambling den running
in the town, except one, and whether
that falls under the legal interdiction
or not is a question. But whatever
may be the technical exemption claim
ed by Frank Daroux, proprietor of the
pool rooms in the old Capitol Hotel,
Chief Dwyer is determined to carry out
the spirit and Intent of the ordinance
under which he has closed all of the
other games. In speaking of the war
now being w,aged against the gambling
fraternity, Chief Dwyer made the fol
lowing statement to the representative
of The Call:
"I am determined that this place
of Daroux's shall be closed with the
rest of them. In the first place it is un
fair to those who have obeyed my or
der and closed their places, to permit
Mr. Daroux to continue. Of course Mr.
Daroux is a man with much experience
in avoiding the penalties of the law and
frustrating the attempts of law offi
cers in the performance of their duty.
But while he has been successful in the
past in openly disobeying the municipal
ordinances, he will find his future road
a hard one to travel as long as I am
Chief of Police."
When asked what would be his pro
cedure "in the next move against
Daroux, Chief Dwyer said:
"I do not think it best to disclose my
plans, but you can rest assured that I
will be successful in the long run. I
have something up my sleeve which
will come as a surprise to Mr. Daroux
and I do not think he will be prepared
for it. So far as closing the doors of his
place against my officers is concerned,
you may depend upon it, that when I
get ready to enter the place there will
be no failure on my part. I have given
no order to any officer to enter the
place, but should I do so, an entrance
will be effected should it require the
entire force.
"Iffy first plan will be to dispose of
the gang of touts which hangs arouna
the Capitol Hotel and In the neighbor
hood of Seventh and X streets. A
more disreputable aggregation it would
be difficult to find, and I do not propose
to tolerate their presence any longei
in the vicinity of une of the principal
quarters in the city. Women and chil
dren are often rc-qxilred to pass on the
other side of the street in order to
avoid the crowd of pool room touts,
<>piu' Jiends and crooks who hang
arois â¢. the Capitol Hotel corner. I
have given notice to bag the entire
bunch and compel them to answer the
penalty for vagrancy.
"I have entered upon this crusade
against the lawless elements infesting
Sacramento with the determination to
succeed In ridding the city of them by
a proper enforcement of the municipal
ordinances."
Frank Daroux, in speaking of the sit
uation, said:
"In the first place I am violating no
law or ordinance. My place of business
is in Yolo County, where there are no
restraints against pool-selling. It is
true that I am the lessee of the Capitol
Pool Rooms, but no tickets are sold
there, and while there may appear to
be, as a matter of fact there is no bet
ting done in the room."
When asked about the posting of
odds Mr. Daroux said:
"Of course, I write the odds on the
blackboard, but that is done for the
convenience of those who desire to go
over to Yolo later on and play my
books, which are open there.
"No, sir," said he, continuing, "I am
violating no law, and stand in defiance
of no one. I respect the authority of
the Mayor of this city and that of the
Chief of Police. I have always treated
them with the utmost courtesy, and
shall continue to do so."
"Why are your doors closed to the
police?" was asked.
"Because the police have no right to
enter my place of business as long as
1 am creating no disturbance or break
ing no law. You as a private citizen
could close your home to the entrance
of some prying policeman, and I have
the same right, for this is my home,
as I sleep here."
"Could a bet be made in these rooms
on a race?"
"Of course it could, but no tickets
are sold there. Any man can make a
bet if he chooses, and I know of no law
which prohibits it."
"Do you intend to maintain your
present position against the Chief?"
"As I said before, I do not consider
that I am standing out against the
Chief."
"Well, will you obey his orders and
close your place of business?"
"No; he has no more right to close
me out than he has to close that drug
store across the way."
"He says that he has."
"Well, he is wrong."
So it is that the fight is on, and
whether the Chief or Daroux will win
depends upon events of the future. City
Attorney de Ligne is out of the city,
but it is generally un<*Â«rstood that he
has some doubts aboat the statu3 of
Mr. Daroux's "pace of business." All
of the other games in the city have
closed in earnest, and the proprietors
seem to be taking the new order of
things with wonderful complacency.
No great opposition has been registered
from any quarter, and the probabilities
are that none will be made, as it was
well understood from the beginning
that Mayor Land was opposed to and
would not favor "an open town." Mayor
Land in speaking of the situation
said:
"Let the results of my orders speak
for me." ______________

BRALY NOT TO
BE PROSECUTED
Spared by Los Angeles'
League for Better
Government.
Escapes Punishment for the
Discounting of School
Warrants.
Attorneys of tho Organization Submit
r Liyai Opinion in His
Favor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14.â The session
of the School Directors to-night was a
fruitful one. The League for Better
City Government filed a communication
announcing that that organization had
decided not to prosecute Director J. H.
Braly, the banker, who in his capacity
as custodian of funds discounted claims
against the School Department, which,
as a School Director, he had assisted
in creating and approving.
The communication Is made from the
league In the shape or a letter from
Rev. Burt Estes Howard, as chairman
of the Municipal Reform Committee of
that body. Rev. Mr. Howard says that
the committee had submitted the mat
ter of prosecuting Director Braly
to its attorneys, H. T. Lee and W. J.
Hunsaher, and that those gentle
men had given advice to the effect that
the charges could not be sustained, as
Mr. Braly had not committed any act
which would warrant his removal from
the board, and that a criminal prosecu
tion against him would not hold.
The opinion of the attorneys of the
league was filed with the board. It
ia to the effect that the transactions in
question, in which the Braly, bank en
gaged, and put" of which it obtained a
benefit, were not contracts made by the
Board of Education, as the individuals
had performed their respective con
tracts, their labor had been accepted
and the claims allowed, and that the
contracts were, therefore, at an end;
that Mr. Braly's bank had an interest
in a fully executed contract and that,
therefore, Mr. Braly had not violated
the law, which provides that no mem
ber shall be interested in a contract
pending its execution, but he can be in
terested in the proceeds of such con
tract after its execution. Nothing was
done with the communication. It was
, simply filed.
At the last meeting of the board, N.
!S. Averill was elected secretary. To
j night Secretary H. G. Johnson declined
| to give up the office, on the ground that
; his successor had not been legally cho
j sen under a section of the city charter
i which provides that the appointive of
' fleers shall hold during the pleasure of
the appointing power. The reformers
on the board had no charges to pre
i fer against Johnson's competency or
j honesty. They simply wanted the place
â  for another man.
To-night A. M. Bragg entered the
. board as the duly elected member from
| the Seventh Ward. A motion deelar
| ing N. S. Averill the dully elected sec
! retary of the board was lost by a tie
; vote. Director Bragg declining to vote.
Then Director Webb moved that H.

board, which was carried by 5 to 4,
Director Bragg voting with the ma
i jority.
PLACED IN A
FALSE LIGHT
BY A FOOL
Continued from First Page.
of Justice, the State Department has
taken steps to place In the hands of
Senor Canalejas, to whom the letter
was addressed, the epistle written by
Senor Dupuy de .Lome which led to
the resignation of the Minister. The
transaction Is explained in the follow
ing brief statement given out to-night
by the State Department:
"Recognizing that the legal owner
ship of the De Lome letter is in Mr.
Canalejas, and his agent and attor
ney, Mr. Carlisle, having proper au
thority to receive the same, the letter
was delivered to him to-day."
As explained in this statement, Mr.
Carlisle was fully authorized to ap
ply for and receive the letter, having
the cabled authorization from Senor
Canalejas. In the view of the State
Department the letter was a stolen
document, and, like any other
piece of property, it should, upon ap
plication, be delivered to its rightful
owner. There was no other course left
open, for, in the United States, as in
all other countries having a code of
laws, a letter becomes the sole prop
erty of the person to whom it is ad
dressed immediately after it starts on
Its way from the sender. Even the
latter cannot obtain possession of it
without the consent of the person ad
dressed; the limit of hla powers legally
being in certain cases to stop the de
livery of the paper. This letter has,
besides, already completely served all
of the uses for which it might have
been applied by our Government, and
there are in existence facsimile copies
of the paper that are so surely authen
ticated as to leave no legal doubt of
their accuracy.
There now remains only the closing
chapter of the incident to be written,
for the end Is already in sight. Not
withstanding all that has been said
in the press about demands on Spain
for apologies or retractions of the dis
agreeable things said by Senor Dupuy
de Lome in his letter, it can be posi
j tively stated that at no time since
the publication of the letter has the
| State Department taken any such
course. Instead it has relied entirely
upon the sense of propriety of the
Spanish Government to do all that was
proper and needful to wipe out the un.
pleasant impression produced by these
statements, and it can now be said
that this course has been fully justi
fied and that the Spanish Cabinet, now
being aware of the full text of the
letter, is expected within a day or two
to make such disclaimer of the letter
as is required by the circumstances.
To-night the State Department re
ceived official notice from Madrid of
the selection of Senor Lois Polo-Ber
nabe to succeed De Lome.
CONGRESS AND THE
CUBAN QUESTION.
Allen's Amendment to the Consular
Bill Shelved, and a Resolution
of Inquiry.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.â During the
short open session of the Senate two
phases of the Cuban question were ad
verted to briefly. The amendment of
Allen of Nebraska to the diplomatic
and consular appropriation bill recog
nizing the belligerency of the Cuban
insurgents was reported adversely by
the Foreign Relations Committee, not,
as Morgan explained, on the merits of
the amendment, but because the com
mittee did not approve of tacking such
legislation to appropriation bills. Mor
gan's resolution calling upon the Pres
ident for the reports of United States
Consuls In Cuba and for information
as to whether any agent of the auton
omous Government in Cuba had been
accredited to this Government and rec
ognized by it was adopted without dis
sent.
Morgan reported from the Committee on
Foreign Relations the. amendment to tho
diplomatic and consular appropriation bill
offered' by Senator Allen of Â£ cb o ra hh a >
recognizing the belligerency of Cuba, mo
report, which was quite long. Bta tf Ã -tnat
the Senate had already acted on this mat
ter and was still of the same opinion ana
would be glad to have the House co-op
erate in securing a recognition oi oeiug
crt?ncy
In connection with the report Morgan
Bald a word of explanation was necessarj.
It had occurred during his membership
of the committee that it had been necea-
Bary to place upon an appropriation bill
a matter of the kind suggested by tne
proposed amendment. 'The report, said
he. "makes no suggestion as to tne merits
of the proposition contained in the amend
ment. It does, however, regard this as an
inopportune manner of taking up the bud-
Ject. The effect of the report is to have
the amendment lie on the table, and the
Senator who offered it CAllen) has tho
privilege of calling it up at any time. Â!
"I do not like." added Morgan, . to go
further at this time into a matter which
is likely deeply to stir the public mind,
especially as, later in the day. the sub
ject may again come up, in which event 1
shall have something to say upon it.
In response to an inquiry by Allen as to
the Btntus of the amendment, and the er
fect upon it of the report. Morgan sad:
"It is a favorable report as to the merits
of the amendment and an unfavorable
one as to tacking it on the appropriation
bill."
A resolution of Morgan of Alabama was
passed, calling for consular reports re
garding affairs in Cuba, and inquiring
whether or not this Government had rec
ognized the autonomous Government or
Cuba and authorized the negotiation of a
reciprocity treaty. . .
Considerable unnecessary excitement
was caused among the members pi tne
House to-day by the rumor, broadly cir
culated before the House convened that
important action relative to Cuba was to
be taken. It turned out to be simply a
resolution of inquiry unanimously report
ed by the Foreign Affairs Committee last
week callling on the State Department for
information as to the condition of the
concentrados in Cuba and the progress
made in. Spain's effort to induce the Cu
bans to accept autonomy. The resolution i
was adopted without division.

soon to turn out one thousand pounds

mated that for target practice alone our
navy will hereafter require annually
half a million dollars worth of powder."
The Call correspondent to-day inter
viewed an officer of the American Ord
nance Company, whose headquarters
are in Washington. He said that the
defective shrapnel was not sold to the
Government by his company, but by
the old Hotchkiss company before the
consolidation. It appears that the
American Ordnance Company Is noth
ing: more than an ammunition "trust,"
which was organized in Washington in
January, 1*96, with its central office in
Washington. It is a consolidation of
the Hotchkiss Company, the Driggs-
Sehroeder Company, in which the
Cramp Bros, are interested, makers of
rapid-firing guns; the Pratt-Whitney
Company of Providence, the American
Projectile Company of Lynn, Mass.,
makers of ammunition, and that com
pany also has a torpedo manufactory
at Bridgeport, Conn. They also seem
to co-operate with the Maxim Gun
Company of London, as their office is
situated just across the street from the
War Department, in the same building
with that of the Maxim Company.
It also appears that the stockholders
in the Bethlehem, Pa., works, which
furnish to the Government the steel
forgings for monster naval guns, are
large stockholders in the American
Ordnance Company, and that the lat
ter company, through the agency of
powerful influence here, manages to se
cure contracts for all kinds of guns and
ammunition.
Dr. Richard Gatling, inventor of the
world-known Gatling gun, some time
ago perfected a process for casting big
guns in one piece. He claimed that the
hoop and band guns were worthless
after they had been fired a few times.
He even went so far as to declare that
after a few shots the joints became
loose. Whether this was an exaggera
tion or not. Dr. Gatling was supported
by some eminent experts in his claim
that the life of a hoop and band gun
was of short duration considering its
enormous cost. After many years of
study he perfected a process by which
he believed that a big gun could be
cast in one piece and he vainly en
deavored to get the ordnance bureaus
of the two departments to recommend
to Congress that an appropriation be
passed for experimenting. He failed
in this and alleged that it was because
the Rethlehem and Watervliet forging
companies had too strong a pull with
the war and navy ordnance bureaus.
Dr. Gatling, however, finally, secured
his appropriation and is making his
experiments at Cleveland, O. It has
also been a matter of much comment in
Washington that two calibers of arms
are employed for the infantry and the
marines of the naw. instead of having
one caliber for both, so that the arms
and ammunition would be interchange
able in emergency. This is another
matter that Congressman Hilborn will
endeavor to have Congress investigate.
Union Park Land Company Sued.
George J. MeC'ormick filed suit yester
day against the Union Park Land Com
pany to recover $50,000 damages for al
leged breach of contract. The plaintiff
alleges that the defendant is the owner of
the Union Coursing Park Association,
and that that organization at present oc
cupies lands in San Mateo County which
were leased by McCormlck from the
Union Park Land Company prior to the
incorporation of the Union Park Cours
ing Association. The plaintiff claims that
the defendant disregarded the lease and
unlawfully gave it into the possession of
the Union Coursing Park Association
and In consequence he has been damaged
to the extent of the sum for which he
sues.

In the Senate to-day Harris of Kan
sas Introduced a resolution with refer
ence to the latest phase of the Kansas
Pacific sale. He said in connection with
! the resolution that the reason for its
j presentation at this time was that the
Attorney-General had informed him
less than a week ago that he proposed
to redeem the first mortgage bonds of
the Kansas Pacific and have a receiver
appointed for the road.
"We were surprised yesterday," said
Harris, "to learn that the Attorney-
General had decided to abandon his ex
pressed plan of redeeming the first
I mortgage bonds of the Kansas Pacific
I and having the receiver appointed for
j the road. By this deal. If it be true
that it has been entered into, the Gov
ernment would lose $6,624,107 interest
due." .
The resolution was as follows: 1
Resolved, That the Attorney-Genial Is
directed to inform the Senate if he has
authorized the abandonment of his ex
pressed intention to redeem the first
mortgage bonds issued by the Tnlon Pa
cific Railroad Company, eastern division,
now the Kansas Pacific division, of the
Union Pacific Railway, and to ask for
a postponement of the sale thereof and
for the appointment of a receiver there
of in the interests of the Government of
the United States, and also if he has
authorized an agreement by which said
property is to be sold for the face value
of the subsidy bonds, resulting in a loss
to the Government of the amount of
$6,624,107, and if the Government has
agreed not to be a bidder at said sale.
Chandler objected to present consid
eration, and the resolution went over
until to-morrow.
Allen called up his resolution relating
to the free and unrestricted coinage of
standard silver dollars without delay
and without waiting for the consent of
foreign nations, and submitted some re
marks upon it. He reviewed at length
the currency legislation of the past and
maintained that silver, as the money of
the constitution, ought to be received
at the mints on equality with gold.

Trouble Over a Hat.
A girl's hat will cause Judge Campbell
lome worry to-day, as he will have to
listen to the stories of a large number
of people. The hat Is said to belong
to Alice Itsell, a pupil at the Hamilton
Grammar School, and it Is alleged that
it was stolen from her on January 3.

REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR.
Women never really kiss each other
They both know it is only an imitation
The average girl will never admit that
she likes to see a man in his shirt sleeves
No man cares much for etiquette when
it is a warm day and he has got a porous
plaster on.
The man a woman likes best is the one
who knows when to say nothing and just
pat her hand.
A man is never really proud of his
whiskers till he takes to wearing his
mustache longer than his beard.
Nobody should ever get married. If a
man isn't good-looking enough his wife
will look at other men, and if he is good
looking he will look at other women. â

For tha Third Time Joseph W. Bab

Chairman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 14.
The Republican Congressional cam
paign committee met to-night In the
lobby of the House, with twenty-seven
members present, and after forming Its
organization entered into a brief dis
cussion of party issues. Representative
Joseph W. Babcock of Wisconsin, for
the third time was honored with the
chairmanship of the committee.
In accepting the honor, Chairman
Babcock expressed his appreciation of
the tribute paid him, said it should be
borne in mind that there is a strong
fight before the party and pledged his
best efforts in carrying out his part of
the contest.
Representative Pearson of North
Carolina nominated Representative
John Simpkina of Massachusetts for
vice chairman, to succeed Representa
tive Apsley of Massachusetts, who was
not re-elected to this Congress. Mr.
Simpson declined the nomination in
favor of Representative James Shear
man of New York, who was elected.
Representative David H. Mercer of
Nebraska was nominated by Represen
tative Loudenslager of New Jersey for
re-election as secretary, but he, too,
declined, and nominated instead Repre
sentative Jesse Overstreet of Indiana.
The latter was elected.
Colonel W. B. Thompson of this city
was then elected treasurer.
A motion was carried authorizing
Chairman Babcock to appoint an ex
ecutive committee at a future date, he
to both select the members and de
termine the number. This executive
committee was authorized to fill any
vacancies in the general committee
which might be caused by death or
resignation, thirty days' notice to the
State delegation affected being made a
condition precedent.
There were several informal speeches.
General Grosvenor referred to the
Maine election, which is to follow that
'of Oregon, but said its significance
paled before Oregon, on account of the
latter's precedence in date.
Representative Hilborn of California
made a short address, in which he
claimed that protection had accom
plished much for California and the
country in general and because it was
an assured fact the party should devote
considerable attention to it.
Senator Shoup of Idaho said his sec
tion of the country would do everything
possible to give a Republican majority
in the next Congress, but he conceded
that the sentiment of Idaho was for bi
metallism.

the Freeholders.
There was a fairly large attendance at
the ma9s meeting of the unemployed
men and women of this city in Metropoli
tan Temple last night.
J. K. Phillips presided. The speaker of

sum asked for would give employment to
950 men for six months during each year.
A resolution was offered calling upon

gerald, asking him to use his personal
and official means to further the interest
of the unemployed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUXEATJ. Alaska, Feb. 8 (by steam
ehlp Rosalie, via Seattle, Feb. 14).â
During the last four days a terrible
blizzard has been raging along the
coast from the head of Lynn Canal to
Fort Wrangel. The wind came down
In Irresistible blasts from over the tops
of the mountains and through the gaps.
Vessels in the harbor -were afraid to
venture out.
The steamer Chilkat. from San Fran
cisco, while on her way to Juneau, was
caught in the storm. She steamed for
ten hours against the wind without
making- four miles. She lay here twen
ty-four hours waiting for the wind to
go down.
The steamship City of Topeka lay
here thirty-six hours. Her lines parted
and she was blown away from her dock
and dropped her anchor.
Old-timers say it was the hardest
wind they ever experienced in Alaska.
At Dyea and Skaguay the cold was in
tense. Part of the time a blinding
snow fell. People on the trail suffered
greatly.
A sensational report has reached Ju
neau, coming down on the small boats,
that many persons were frozen to death
on the summit of White Pass and on
the trail beyond. As evidence of the
severity of the weather, W. Murruatt,
an Englishman, was brought to the
hospital here with both of his feet
frozen. A surgical operation will like
ly be necessary.
Accounts differ as to the number of
the blizzard's victims,
varying from
seventeen to twenty-seven. There is
no means at pr< sen! at petting at the
real facts. It win take some days for
the truth t<> be ascertained. There is
doubt, though, that there were a
number of deaths, and the Chilkoot â
the worst pass in Southern Alaska tor
storms â is yet to be heard from. It is
no exaggeration to say no small steam-
er has dared to venture out, the cap
tain of each fearing that the wind
f would lift it up bodily and drop it
Jf ashore.
Skaguay is comparatively quiet. The
action of Governor Brady in asking
the President fq.r sufficient reinforce
ments to preserve order and protect
life and property has had a whole
some effect on the rough element. The
shell and other "sure thing" men are j
not making themselves so conspicuous,
and the sand-baggers and garroters |
are not now doing any more work in
robbing the solitary, unwary and be- \
. lated pedestrians. The best citizens of I
Skaguay are keeping their hands on
the reins and are now running the ;
town. The theater where the fatal
Bhooting of United States Deputy Mar
shal Rnwen and McGrath occurred is j
still closed, and will doubtless remain
so until time has cooled the temper of
the people.
United States Marshal j Shoup will
leave Juneau to-night for Skaguay.
He came over on the last boat from
Sitka. He had printed a number of
silk badges bearing the woTds in gilt,
"U. S. Marshal," which he will require
all his deputies at Dyea and Skaguay
to wear on their hatbands.
Eddie Fay, the bartender in the
theater, who killed Rowen and Mc-
Grath, claims that he did not know
, the former was a United State Deputy
. Marshal when he killed him. Marshal ;
Shoup is inclined to believe this story
for the reason that Rowen was a very <
recent appointee. He will, therefore,
' decorate his deputies with the badges
, of their authority. As has been face
, tiously suggested here this may be a
sign, to the following effect:
"I am a Deputy United States Mar
shal. Don't shoot."
The Governor will make a show of
force at the head of Lynn Canal. He
will shortly make his annual trip of
inspection to Yakutat, aboard the
"Wheeling, now at Sitka, and he is ex
pected to drop anchor before Dyea and
Pkaguay on the way. News that Gov
ernor Brady had appealed to Prpsident
McKlnley for help created a big sen
sation at Skaguay and calmed the
town.
Governor Brady also admitted at
Sitka last Friday that the report gent
exclusively to The Call last week that
he Intended to take the gunboat
Wheeling and make the Killisnoo re
store to the Hoonah Indians the $2500
worth of blankets and other property
forced from the unfortunate Hoonahs
by superior numbers is correct. He
will stop before the Killisnoo village
on the way to Yakutat. There can be
but one result when two big G's â a

THE OREGON PUTS BACK
TO ASTORIA WITH FIRE
RAGING IN HER HOLD
A Conflagration Starts on the Alaska-Bound
Vessel and Creates Almost a Panic
Among Her Six Hundred
Passengers.
ASTOHIA, Or.. Feb. 14.-^But for the timely discovery Â©f a lire In
the hold of the Alaskan steamship Oregon, the vessel might now be a
mass of raging flames, at the mercy of the waves and winds.
The Oregon sailed from her dock In this city at 12:30 o'olock to-day,
carrying 600 passengers and as much freight as it was possible to place
aboard. The steamer proceeded to the mouth of the river without Inci
dent. When juat about to cross smoke was discovered issuing from the
bunkers, where 600 tons of coal were stored. The alarm was Immedi
ately given, but It was some time before the exact position of the blaae
was ascertained.
In the meantime the passengers had learned of the fire and for
a while there was consternation. The steamer was twenty miles from
a suitable berth and as the terrible possibilities of the situation
dawned upon the fortune-seekers the excitement was Intense.
The officers of the Oregon were cool and went among the frightened
passengers, assuring them that the flre would be extinguished without
damage to life or property. The excitement then subsided and the crew
was better enabled to work at the bunkers.
The fire was at the bottom of the coal and It was necessary to put
back to port. The steamer arrived at her dock at 6 p. m. and the work
of unloading the coal -ommenced. The flre had gained but little head
way and was easily extinguished. Spontaneous combustion was
the cause.
While the Oregon was on the way down the river from Portland
Andrew Hill, one of the waiters, seemingly lost his reason and ran
amuck. In endeavoring to suppress him one of the passengers, F. A.
Smith, was knocked down and severely beaten about the head. Hill
raved and swore like a maniac, insulting the women passengers and
jeopardizing the lives of all who came near him. He was finally seized
and bound, handcuffed to the backstay. He continued his abuse, but
ceased when a hose was turned on him. He was taken before a Jus
tice of the Peace here and fined $75, in default of which he was sent
to Jail for thirty-seven days.
The Oregon will sail in the morning. She carries about twenty pas
sengers from Astoria.
Governor and a Gunboatâ are arrayed
against a few Indians.
On the Rosalie were a few Klondik
ers who left Dawson on December 19
last. I have sent reports of parties
who left Dawson at much later dates.

MRS. JACK GARDNER
SETS SOCIETY AGOG.
Anxious to Create a Flutter, She
Appears at a Concert in an
Invalid's Chair.
BOSTON. Feb. 14.â Mrs. "Jack" Gard
ncr could not wait until Friday's con
cert to show society that a little thing
like a broken leg could not keep her
home. Perhaps it was love of music, but
! the talk made her desire to do some
1 thing to set society agog. Yesterday it
: was printed that on Friday Mrs. "Jack"
i would attend a recital in Music Hall,
i being wheeled to it in an invalid's chair.
The publication of this news took away
all the novelty attending the act, so the
brilliant society leader must tina some
new caprice. Alexander Siloti, the fa
mous Russian pianist, was to give a re
cital at Steinert Hall to-day, and Mrs.
i "Jack" would attend.
Society was out in full force and the
: programme was just ready to begin when
Mrs. Gardner was wheeled up the aisle
in her chair. She had come to the hall
: in an open brougham, was lifted into the
; chair, taken up in an elevator and ar
< rived just at the proper moment. She
i caught society again, and her entrance
I caused a terrific sensation, Mrs. Gardner
receiving an ovation equal to that given
Siloti when he appeared.

NEW YORK, Feb. 14.-A dispatch to
the Evening Post from Montreal says:
The Great Commonwealth Develop
ment and Mining Company intends to
build a railway from Edmonston to the

through the Rockies by the Peace
River Pass, across the northeastern
corner of British Columbia at Fort
Halkett, on the Laird River, up the

STOCKTON. Feb. 14.â Peter Christian

lived l.ke a hermit on a ranch eight miles
from Sto< ktnn, was found dead in his bed
on Sunday. He left an estate worth about
$150,000. Hp had no relatives in this coun

Senator Pettigrew's
Protest Against
Annexation.
Taking Hawaii Means the
Final Act in a Great
Conspiracy.
This Government Has No Right
to Secure the Islands With
out Consent of Natives.
OVERTHROW OF RULER.
LllluokÂ«lÂ«ni'Â» Downfall DvÂ« to In
trigues Backed by the United
State* Minister.
Special Dlipatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 14.
The Senate devoted almost four hours
in executive session to the considera
tion of the Hawaiian treaty. The prin
cipal speech was made by Senator Pet
tigrew, this being the third installment
of his remarks upon the subject.
Senator Pettigrew devoted himself
to-day largely to the administration
of President Dole, showing how the
Government of Queen Liliuokalani had
been overthrown, and to a presentation
of his views of this Government's par
ticipation in the revolution. He con
tended that the downfall of the Queen's
Government was due to a conspiracy
on the part of Minister Stevens, repre
senting the United States, and a few
citizens of Honolulu, of whom Presi
dent Dole was one, who were backed by
the marines from a United States bat
tleship.
He argxied that at the time there was
no armed force on the island opposed
to the Queen's Government except the
United States marines, "and," said the
Senator, "if the islands were as rich
as the dream of avarice and their ac
quisition as desirable as that of Louis
iana, we could not take title from a
Government set up by ourselves with
out submitting the question of annexa
tion to a vote of the Hawaiian people.
"To do this," he continued with em
phasis, "would be an international
crime which would place us on a level
with Great Britain in her subjection of
the weaker nations of the earth, which
would be an abandonment of the posi
tion as to the policy of our Government
from its earliest history. A Govern
ment which declares, as does this Gov
ernment in its constitution, that 'all
Government dc-rives its just power
from the consent of the governed,
could not afford to depose a friendly
Government, set up a usurping Govern
ment in its place and then acquire title
to the country without tlrst obtaining
the consent of the people of that coun-
try."
Pettigrew read a letter from Hon. J.
! C. Carter, formerly of Queen Liliuoka
lani's privy council, giving his views of
the revolution. Pettigrew also con
tended that the passage of the McKin
ley tariff law had been the direct cause
\ of the revolution by which the Queen's
Government was overthrown, the mo
tive being to secure the bounty of 2
cents per pound on domestic sugar
which that law provided. He quoted a
letter from Minister Stevens saying
that the provision for this sugar bounty
had ruined the sugar business of the
islands unless they could be annexed to
the United States, and cited other au
thorities to maintain their contention.
Pettigrew discussed briefly the char
acter of the present population of Ha
waii. He said that two-thirds of the
people there were males and that this
fact applied to all nationalities, includ
ing Americans and other Anglo-Saxons.
This circumstance, he contended, went
to show that the Anglo-Saxon does not
go to Hawaii, as he does not to any
tropical country, to make a home. The
man capable of self-government, he
saJd, must wear woolen clothes a part
of the year and for some months feel
the frost in his blood.
Summing up, Pettigrew said that the
opponents of annexation claimed to
have established four points. They
have, he said, shown, first, that the
route to the Orient via the Aleutian
Islands was 1000 miles shorter than
that via Honolulu; second, that no bat
tleship coaling on the Hawaiian Is
lands could reach the United States in
condition to fight and that on this ac
count the possession of the islands
would be an element of weakness
rather than of strength, -which was in
opposition to the theory that the is
lands were necessary to defense; third,
that the commerce of the islands, which
had been claimed to be one important
reason for their annexation, was con
stantly declining and was less than
that of an ordinary county of the
United States; fourth, that one of the
Aleutian Islands would afford a more
secure footing and a shorter route for
a cable to Asia than would the route
via Honolulu.
At the close of his three days' speech
Senator Pettigrew was cordially con
gratulated by many of the Senators, in
cluding some of fhe opposition, upon
the thoroughness with which he had
gone into the subject and the ability
with which he had presented the oppo
sition to annexation.
Teller made a brief statement calling
Pettigrew's attention to the fact that
the United States Minister was not the
only representative of a foreign Gov
ernment who had recognized the Dole
Government. Pettigrew replied that
this was true, but that the recognition
of the other Governments had not come
until the day following the Queen's ab
dication, whereas Minister Stevens'
recognition had been before that time.
Senator Proctor of Vermont followed
with a brief speech in favor of annexa
tion. He devoted himself exclusively
to the military phase of the question.
He cited the fact that England har
strongly fortified posts all along our
Atlantic seaboard, beginning with Hal
ifax, and taking in the Bermudas and
the West Indies. He also called at
tention to the strong fortress at Esqui
malt, and said that if England should
possess the Hawaiian Islands, as she
might easily do in case we let this op
portunity to acquire them pass by, her
drum beat would be heard almost en
tirely around the United States, and
that she would be able to attack us
from her own territory in any direc
tion.
He also contended that it would be a
comparatively easy matter for the Jap
anese to acquire the islands by popu
lating them, as they were apparently
very strongly inclined to do. He said
that the United States, failing to make
the islands a part of this country, could
not regard their seizure by some other
power as an offense against this coun
try. We could not play the dog in
the manger, refusing to accept the
territory ourselves or to allow others
to take it. He attempted to contro
vert the statement of Senator Petti
grew, that warships could not carry
sufficient fuel from Hawaii to make
them effective eitheT for or against
the United States in case of Hostili
ties, and quoted statistics to show the
contrary view. He said that if it were
even true that a vessel could not carry
sufficient coal itself, coaling vessels
could be taken along for that purpose.
He thought the islands of essential im
portance to the United States, both for
the purpose of offense and defense.
During the session. Senator White of
California attempted to ascertain from
Senator Davis, in charge of the treaty,
whether there would be any early at
tempt to secure a vote upon it. The
California Senator stated his opinion
that there ought to be at least three
weeks' notice of a time for a vote for
the arrangement of pairs. He stated
that he would be compelled to be ab
sent from the Senate for the next three
weeks, and expressed a desire to know
something of the plans as to bringing
the discussion to an end.
In reply, Senator Davis simply stat
ed that he could not at present say
when the debate would cease, or when
the Senate would be prepared to take
a vote.
RACE FOB A JUDGESHIP.
Many Candidates for a Vacancy in
Del Norte County.
EUREKA, Feb. 14.â The contest for the
appointment of a successor to Superior
Judge James E. Murphy, deceased, of Del

agree upon a candidate from that county.
There are three Del Norte candidates â
District Attorney L. F. Cooper, Samuel

MOBE WAGES FOR SAILORS.
Substantial Raise Made by the Ship-
Owners' Association.
Wages will be increased by the Ship
| owners' Association. The increase is
made because the ship-owners can af
ford it and not because of any fear of
trouble or apprehension of a scarcity
of men for a long time to come. The
owners are getting better charters for
their vessels and freighting has raised
correspondingly. Rates have been in
creased $5 all round for able seamen,
for all ports, excepting for vessels sail
ing for Australia, Asia, Europe and
South America, on which the rate re
mains the same, $20. The reason for
this exception is that the foreign ship
pers control such rates. The schedule,
as increased, to go into effect to-day
is as follows:
Sailing vessels, lumber, bar harbors, Pa
cific States, Alaska or British Columbia.
$35; sailing vessels, coal, bar harbors. Pa

Epidemic of Attack
and Riot in the

Correspondence of The CaJL
SHANGHAI, Jan. 9.â Authentic re
ports have reached here of recent date
from all sections of the Chinese em
pire indicating that riot and attack
upon foreigners is the order of the day.
The attacks seem to be those of isolat
ed ruffians rather than a concerted ac
tion on the part of the populace.
In one of the central provinces, Hu
peh, a riot was instigated by the stu
dents of the military academy. ProD
erty was stolen and the members of
several native churches were scattered
over the country. Seventeen leaders
of the riots have been arrested and are
standing trial. A chapel of the Wes
leyan mission was destroyed during
the riot.
In the same province several Chi
nese merchants were set upon by
marauders, and, after a fierce fight,
the robbers carried away the spoils,
consisting of 7000 taels, which the mer
chants were carrying in coin to a
neighboring city.
From Soo Chow, in Central China,
comes the authoritative information
that in the collection of rentals in and
around Soo Chow there has been a per
sistent refusal on the part of the nat
ives, and that an altercation occurred
in which a woman was killed and !
others injured. The native Magistrates j
themselves, when attempting to hear I
those cases, have been mobbed, pelted
with mud and compelled to lice from !
the court of justice.
In Canton, from the very south of |
China, where most of the travelling is
by rivers and canals, steam launches
carrying foreigners have been repeat
edly held up by bands of ruffians, and
recently a European woman mission
ary was brutally treated, her boat be
ing held up in the river. The men over
powering her coolies, boarded it by
force, and robbing her of her money
left her in a sorry plight. From For
mosa, just off the coast of Central
China, authentic reports come that the
whole of the country is disturbed. Re
peated attacks by armed bands of rob
bers are being reported day by day.
Travel in the interior Is unsafe at the
present time.
From the Province of Chuen, one of
the provinces nearest the highlands of
Thibet, authentic information comes of
riots instigated and led on by military
students, and of the destruction of
property.
In the well-governed city 'of Shang
hai and the European section there are
confirmed reports of insulting treat
ment of foreigners by Chinese. A
prominent lady riding upon a wheel,
passing the west gate, was insulted by
a Chinaman who spat in her face.
Chinese soldiers, even in Shanghai,
have attempted to throw foreigners
from their carriages. Boys in the
streets are set by older people to follow
at the heels of prominent European
residents of the city, throwing mud and
calling indecent names.
In view of the fact that the treaties
are soon to throw sections of Japan
open to foreigners, there are interest
ing reports of the Buddhist and Shinto
priests assembled in one of the princi
pal provinces to discuss the siuation.
They have promulgated the following
four resolutions and request all Japan
ese to be governed by them.
L To cultivate feelings of abhorrence of
foreigners and to. refuse in principle to
sell or buy of them anything whatever.
2. To refuse absolutely to rent their
houses or lands to foreigners.
3. To refrain entirely from using foreign
terms in speaking and writing.
4. To positively decline to listen to
Christianity;

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House*
Washington, Feb. 14.
The House Committee on Merchant!
Marine and Fisheries held a meeting:'
to-day, going over the proposed changes;
in the navigation laws to removal
troublesome problems arising In Alas-J
kan commerce. As a result the com-*
mittee later favorably reported to thai
House the Payne bill providing: for|
several amendments to the navigation;
laws.
The bill is framed to meet new oon-^
ditions created by the gold discoveries
in the Yukon River and its objects andj
effects are explained in a comprehen
sive report made to the committee bjfl
Secretary' Gage. It strengthens and)
makes explicit the laws declaring 1 ou?j
general policy that the coasting trade,
(including the trade between the rests
of the United States and Alaska) shall
be reserved exclusively to American,
vessels, and covers more explicitly this
situation. Seagoing vessels can proceed'
to St. Michael, near the mouth of thÂ«
Yukon. The Yukon is very shallow;,
in some places only four feet deep.
Transfer of cargoes and passenger*
from deep-draught seagoing vessels
to river vessels drawing little water Is
therefore necessary at St. Michael.
Substantially the same is true of
Stickeen River and Wrangel near its
mouth.
The essential amendment, as pointed!
out by Secretary Gage, is on the ques
tion as to whether American goods
consigned to Alaskan ports from Seat
tle can be carried in American vessels
to Victoria, a distance of only 72 miles,,
and at Victoria be put on British ves
sels to be carried to Dyea, about 900
miles, or to St. Michael, about 2000
miles. The Treasury Department has
ruled that this is a violation of the laws
reserving the coasting trade to Ameri
can vessels. The policy of the United
States, Secretary Gage says, is to con
fine carrying by water "for the whole
voyage" between American points to
American vessels, n.nd section 1 of the
bill is believed to explicitly affirm this
policy and remove all doubt. The com
mittee has increased from $100 to $200
the penalty for each instance of a for
eign vessel transporting a passenger
between ports or places in the United
States, either directly or via a foreign
port.
WEEK OF GRACE FOR
COLONEL FINIGAN.
Illness of a Woman Saves Him From
Possible Incarceration for
Contempt.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 14.â Colonel Peter
A. Finigan is the most abused man in tha
world, according to his own story. To
day, through a woman's illness, he was
saved the ignominy of again occupying a
cell in the Marln County Jail. Colonel
Finigan was on hand early in Superior
Judge Angellotti's court, on an order to
show cause why he should not be ad
judged guilty of contempt of court for
failure to pay alimony to MLrs. Emily B.
Finigan. The one-time millionaire in an
affidavit alleged that Mrs. Finigan had
annoyed and harassed him and exposed
him to contempt and ridicule. He said he
had no income or means of support and
was dependent for his maintenance on tha
credit he had been able to obt:iin. Mrs.
Finigan's persecution, he explained, pre
vented him from engaging in business.
Colonel Finigan was asked by Mrs. Finli
gan's counsel what property he had be
fore the divorce suit was commenced.
Judge Bigelow said it was intended
to show that Colonel Finigan had proper
ty standing in the names of others
amounting to over $100,00). Obj<Â»ctionÂ»
were raised and it was decided to post
pone argument of the point until the af
ternoon.
A subnena was issued for Mm. R, H.
Warfield, wife of General Warfieid of the
Hotel Rafael, where the Finlgajjs lived.
When court convened Attorney Crowley
said that Deputy Constable Crit Shepparfl
had served the subpena on Mrs. Warfield
and she bad informed him that she woulÂ«
not come. Crowley asked that an attach
ment be issued to bring her into court.
Judge Angellotti said that a certiflcata
had been given him, signed by Dr. H.
Howitt to the effect that Mrs. Warfield
was sick and could not appear in court.
The court put the case over until next
Monday.

SAN JOSE, Feb. 14.â 1n expectation
of sensational proceedings in the inves
tigation of the charge that Police Offi
cer John H. Scully had secured his po
sition by fraud the council chamber
was crowded to-night, there being
scarcely standing room. But the pro
ceedings were disappointingly short
and tame.
The reading of the communication
from Chief Kidward announcing the
suspension of Officer Scully pending the
Investigation by the Council opened the
matter. Councilman Fay was the only
absentee. He was sick.
Councilman Noltlng said that under
the circumstances he thought it would
be proper to have an Investigation and
suggested that the Mayor set a time for
the same. Krieg, one of the accused
Councilmen, remarked that a defendant
was usually given ten days in which to
prepare for a hearing. The Mayor then
set Monday next for the investigation.
District Attorney Herrington is ar
ranging to place the case before the
Grand Jury. He is gathering all the
evidence available. He already has in
his possession the original note for $50
given to W. C. Krieg by Mr. and Mrs.
Scully as part payment of the price of
Scully's star. There was also placed at
his disposal to-day the last order for
$13 35 paid to W. C. Krieg out of Scul
ly's salary as a police officer and the
original affidavit made by Mrs. Scully
on Saturday.

Currency Question and the Treat-

LONDON Feb. 14.â Replying to a
question from Mr. Field in the House of
Commons to-day as to whether or not
the Government intended to co-operate
in promoting- an international conference
to consider the currency question. Mr.
Ba'.four, First Lord of the Treasury and
Government leader, eaid he was happy
to say the Government would be verj
glad to see an international agreement
regarding currency, but that he had
nothing to add to the Information al
ready in the possession of the House.
The House later discussed the amend
ment of John Lawson Walton. Liberal
member for South Leeds, to the address
in rt-ply to the speech from the throne,
and - iolng the question of the Govern
ment o Indian frontier policy. Walton'
criticized it from a Liberal standpoint,
disapproving of the occupation of Chitral
us being the source of the present trou
bles and urging the Government not to
tamper with the independence of the
frontier tribes, which, he said, were "the
natural bulwark of India."
Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of
State for India, replied. He said it was
Impossible to evacuate Chitral without
impairing the prestige of Great Britain
and the tranquillity of these tribes. The
present troubles, he continued, proved
that the occupation of Chitral was wel
come and he warmly repelled the oppo
sitions' charges that the Government had
been guilty of breach of faith with the
local tribes in continuing the occupation.

Aged Mother of Murderer Cole
Gives Way When Hope

SANTA CRUZ, Fi j. 14.â Juana Jonkens dropped dead this morn-
Ing at her home in the MlÃSlon orchard when told that her son, Joe
Cole, had been taken to San Quentln to commence serving hie life term
of imprisonment for the murder of his sister-in-law, Mlbb Peres, by

Here in Santa Cruz Cole was always known as a hard-working
man of good character, and he was always kind to his old mother.
When he was taken from her the shock was more than she could bear.
Mrs. Jonkens and another old friend, Mrs. Torres, resided in a small

Nephew of Supervisor Houx
Sends a Bullet Through
His Body.
Rendered Stupid by Liquor, Ha Had
Resolved to Cut Short His
Career.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Feb. 14.â Elwood Houx
: attempted to commit suicide at the
residence of his uncle, Supervisor
Houx, near Blacks, last evening. The
\ attempt was unsuccessful for the time,
i but the wound is of such a serious
| character that his condition is consid
ered very critical. The young man Is
i only 17 years of age and the son of
i John Houx of Placerville. He has
I been at work on the farm of Super
[ visor Houx since last November. '
On Sunday, in company with two or
three young men, he went to Knights
Landing to witness a game of baseball.
When he returned in the evening he
appeared to be slightly under the in
fluence of liquor. He went to his room
at about 8 o'clock in the evening. An
hour later Miss Myrtle Houx, his cou
sin, and the sixteen-year-old daughter
of Supervisor Houx, heard a pistol shot
in the young man's room. She hastily
opened the door and found her cousin
pitting on the side of the bed with a
smoking revolver in his hand.
Mr. Houx and his wife were quickly
summoned. An examination of the
pistol showed that on the first attempt
- : the cartridge failed to explode. The
second attempt was successful. The
ball, which was of thirty-two caliber,
â  entered the right side, between the
third and fourth ribs, about an inch
! and a half above the nipple. Its course
! was upward and backward toward the
I shoulder. It penetrated a portion of
the lung, severing several small blood
; vessels, and the hemorrhage was pro
j fuse.
The bullet was not located. Its
: course, however, indicated that It Is
lodged in the upper portion of the thor
acic cavity. The young man is now
i suffering from pleuro-pneumonia, in
duced by the wc-und in the lung, and
his recovery is doubtful. His strongest
hope rests in the fact that his health
has been perfect and his constitution
j is robust.
When the young man was asked by
his uncle why he attempted to kill
himself, he replied that he did not
know. It Is probable that his brain
was so befuddled that he was not re
sponsible. To be under the Influence
of liquor was something: unusual for
him. He has a reputation for sobriety
and Industry and has been of an ex
ceedingly cheerful disposition.
Supervisor Houx and family are
much distressed on account of the sad
affair. The parents of the young man
have been summoned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1898.
GRANT OF TIME
FOR FLANNELLY
Trial of the Parricide
Continued by Judge
Lorigan.
Delay Occasioned by the Illness
of Witness Daniel
H. Doyle.
His Testimony Depended Upon to
Bolster Up the Case of the
Defendant.
6pÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
BAN JOSE. Feb. 14.â The trial of
Thomas W- Flannelly for the murder
of his father, Patrick Flannelly, at
Redwood City, on October 28, which
was set for this morning in Judge Lor
igan's court, was continued until Feb
ruary 28. This action was taken be
cause of the illness of one of the wit
nesses.
When court opened this morning At
torney Leon Strauss of the firm of
Strauss & Riehl, Flannelly's counsel,
asked for a continuance for one month
on the ground that Daniel H. Doyle,
one of the principal witnesses for the
defense, was sick in bed with erysipe
las. It was alleged that Doyle would
swear that the defendant did not pro
cure the pistol with which he killed his
father Just prior to the homicide, but
had carried it about his person for
more than a year; that about an hour
before the killing the defendant was
calm and peaceful, and spoke to his
father in a kind and considerate man
ner; that the father of the defendant
was ironical, despotic and cruel in his
treatment toward his son, and, finally,
that when the father of the defendant
requested a dissolution of the partner
ship between Doyle and the defendant
it was cheerfully dissolved.
District Attorney Walker of San Ma
teo County, who Is prosecuting the
case, and District Attorney Herring
ton both acquiesced to this. They said
they did not desire to Hurry the trial.
The prosecution also wanted Doyle as
a witness, and in all probability he
would be well enough to appear in
court in about two weeks. The mo
tion was granted and the case con
tinued until February 28.
Flannelly 6at beside his counsel, and
did not seem worried by the large num
ber of spectators present, who strained
their necks In their eagerness to catch
a glimpse of the parricide. He seemed
in excellent health, and maintained
that stoical look that has character
ized his attitude throughout.
AMPUTATED LIMBS
GIVEN A FUNERAL
Ed Huebeler Lives While a Portion
of His Body Is in the
Grave.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. Feb. 14.â Tn Calvary
Cemetery this afternoon at 2:30 there oc
curred the most unlaue funeral of the
year. To be precise, it was only half a
funeral. Some other time it will be com
pleted. Through his own directions, the
lower half of Ed Huebeler's body was in
terred. On February 11 Huebeler was
struck by a train, sustaining injuries that
necessitated the amputation of his legs.
As soon as he rallied from the shock he
decided his legs should be buried with
proper ceremony. An undertaker took
charge of the severed members, and this
morning Huebeler had so far recovered
that he ordered the burial to proceed
without delay. He was not able to attend
his own half of the funeral, but he had
the satisfaction of knowing his friends
had not forgotten him. A wagon con
veyed the withered limbs to the cemetery
and relatives and friends saw them care
fully lowered into the grave. A burial per
mit" was required and was Issued without
hesitation after the circumstances had
been explained. After the funeral Hue
beler's friends called to see him and gave
him assurance That his legs had been ac
corded a Christian burial.

KOCH'S VETO
IN THE WAY
San Jose Street-Sweeping
Job Is Certain of
Failure.
Arguments Heard In the In
junction Suit Against
the Council.
Restraining Order Declared Unneces
sary, Because of the Mayor's
Attitude.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 14.â There was an
unusual array of legal talent in Judge
Klttredge's court this morning when
the hearing on the restraining order re
cently procured by Sanford E. Smith,
a member of the New Charter Club, to
enjoin the Mayor and Common Coun
cil from awarding a three-year con
tract for sweeping the streets to Nash
& McÃeynolds came up. Attorneys
Spencer and Veuve appeared for Mayor
Koch and Councilmen Fay, Dittus,
Krieg and Nolting; Attorneys Bird and
Sullivan for Nash & McÃeynolds, while
Attorneys Hardy, Wilcox and Brown
looked after the Interests of Mr. Smith
and the New Charter Club. A number
of spectators were present, but the only
city official who appeared in court was
Councilman Nolting.
Smith's petition for a restraining or
der was read. It set forth that the
contract awarded by the Council to
Nash & McÃeynolds would amount to
a sum in excess of the amount avail
able in the city treasury fi/r this pur
pose. It alao claimed that the bid of
Nash & McÃeynolds was not the low
est and best bid, and if the contract
was carried out it would cause a great
loss and be a detriment to the taxpay
ers.
To this Mayor Koch filed a separate
answer. He asked that the restraining
order, as far as he was concerned, be
dismissed. The matter had already
been determined before the beginning
of the suit. He had vetoed the ordi
nance, and without his signature the
street-sweeping contract could not go
into effect.
Attorney Spencer then read the ob
jections of the Mayor and Common
Council. It was stated that the re
straining order should be dissolved, as
it was improvidently made; as the
matter in issue had been fully deter
mined and ended before the commence
ment of said suit; that defendants, or
either of them, had not since February
1, 1898, threatened, offered or attempted
to award any contract; that in order to
pass any resolution or ordinance refer
ring to said contract It would be neces
sary to obtain the consent c/f the
Mayor, and the latter official has al
ready filed his veto of the same; and it
further denied that the awarding of
the contract would cause any injury
to plaintiff or to any taxpayer in San
Jose. A dismissal of the injunction was
asked for as the complaint did not state
facts, matters or things entitling plain
tiff to a restraining urder. It was
claimed that the restraining order was
uncalled for; that alleged and pretend
ed or threatened acts of defendants
were fully terminated or ended prior
to the commencement of plaintiff's suit
on February 1, 1898; that it did not
appear that since or subsequent to the
Ist of February these defendants, or
either of them, had offered or attempt
ed to enter into any contract with Xash
& McÃeynolds.
Nash & McÃeynolds 1 answer was
longer than the others, but th-e points
raised were substantially the same.
As soon as Attorney Spencer finished
reading the answer of the Mayor and
Common Council, he began an argu
ment along the lines laid out in the
answer. Attorney Veuve followed
Spencer on behalf at the Councilmen,
and while Attorney Hardy was still ar
guing for the complainant, S. E. Smith,
adjournment was taken until Wednes
day.

a Tramp at the Scans of His
Self- Destruction.
REDWOOD CTTY. Feb. 14.â A ghastly

uninhabited, except by the tramp ele
ment, and is situated in the extreme
northwest end of the town, being a piece
of land lying between the main county
road and the railroad, and thickly over
grown With shrubbery and trees. Tne
tramp reported to ihe station agent here
that he had discovered the body of a
man lying among the trees. This in
telligence was transmitted to the Coroner,
who made an investigation.
The body proved to be that of Frank
Demartini, a young man well known
about town and a brother of Paul De
martini, a wine merchant of this place.
The body was lying upon its back, and
near it lay a revolver. The heart had
been pierced by a ball fired from the
revolver. The revolver was identified by
Paul Demartini as one belonging to him.
The suicide had for some time past
been ailing, and it became necessary to
send him to a San Francisco hospital.
He recovered, and returned to his broth
er's place a short time ago. He was mel
ancholy, and appeared discouraged. On
Saturday last he left the place where he
was stopping, and his whereabouts was

time a barbor at this place, and was
doing well until his health failed. He was

LAWYER JAILED
AS A FIREBUG.
Arson Charge Against a
Young Attorney of
Selma.
Accused of Starting a Blaze In
His Office fop the
Insurance.
Valuable Books Had Been Removed
and the Walls Saturated With
Kerosene.
Special Dispatch â¢- The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. 14.â Edward Robin
son, a young attorney of Selma, was
arrested this morning on a charge of
arson. He is accused of having set
fire to his office in order to get the in
surance on his law library, which
amounts to $500. The blaze was dis
covered in Its inception, however, and
extinguished before any damage was
done. The room was found to have
been thoroughly saturated with kero
sene, and all the books, with the ex
ception of twenty volumes or so, had
been removed from the office.
Immediately after the fire had been
put out, a search was made for the
young attorney, but he could not be
found. He was afterward arrested in
the country. He offered no explana
tion of the mysterious fire, nor of the
fact that ail his books of any value
had been removed from the office.
Robinson was brought before a mag
i istrate and his bail was placed at $1500.
He tried to find sureties, but was un
able to and was lodged in the County
; Jail here this afternoon. His arrest
I was a great surprise to the people of
! Selma, as well as to the citizens of this
i city.
Robinson removed to Selma about
; three months ago, and began the prac
tice of law. He had studied law in
the office of Attorney Van Meter of this
city and was known as an industrious
' young man. He found the road of the
: young lawyer a hard one though, and
: probably concluded that the insurance
t money would be of more immediate
i benefit to him than his authorities.

with the upper half of the head missing.
Nearly all the bones in the body were
broken.
The Warren and Nichols boys were
badly injured and scratched by their fall,
but their injuries will not prove fatal.
CLARENCE D. AMBROSE
KILLED IN MEXICO.
Receives a Mortal Wound Through
the Accidental Discharge of His
Pistol.
POMONA, Feb. 14.â Pomona Is shocked
at the news just received that Clarence
D. Ambrose was shot and killed by the
accidental discharge of his pfstol near
Hermosillo, Mexico, on February 10. Mr.
Ambrose had been in Mexico for several
months, having obtained from President
Diaz a concession of thousands of acres
or mineral and agricultural lands. He
â¢was looking over his concession, and
while stooping down his pistol slipped
from the holster and was discharged by

ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP
PRINCE CLARENCE.
The Banished Chief of the Mosquito
Territory Yet the Object of
Nicaraguan Plotting.
KINGSTON. Jamaica, Feb. 14.â An at
tempt was made late Saturday evening to
kidnap Prince Clarence, formerly chief of
the Mosquito territory, who is now living
here as a pensioner of the British Gov
ernment. The attempt is believed to have
been the result of Nlcaragiian instigation.
Prince Clarence Is now about 24 years
old. He was elevated to the position of
power four years ago as hereditary chief
of the Mosquito Coast territory, and ruled
over 10,000 subjects. His elevation as ruler
came Just before Nicaragua began *to en
croach on the Mosquito territory. Chief
Clarence with his subjects resisted*, and
finally overthrew the Nicaraguans. The
tension between the two nationalities in
creased so much that the United States
Consul at Bluefields, a town in the
Mosquito territory, was forced to ask for
protection for Americans there. The feel
ing against Chief Clarence continued bit
ter, and after repeated defeats he was
forced to flee. With many other refugees
he sought safety on the cruiser Marble
head and left the Mosquito coast. In Au
gust, 1894, he landed at Kingston, Jamai
ca, and has since lived there as a pension
er of the British Government.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 14.â A shoot
ing affray took place about eighteen
miles from Bakersfield this afternoon,
between Charles Sutter and wife and
Joseph Dickey, all three residents of
this county. Sutter and his wife arm
ed themselves and stole a march on
the cabin of Dickey. Dickey, probably
suspecting some evil intent, did not
open the door, but engaged the couple
in conversation from the inside of the
house.
After some words, the exact nature
of which is not known, Sutter opened
fire on Dickey with a Winchester
through the window, but, owing to his
poor aim, his shots flew wide of their
mark. Seizing the opportunity, Dickey
leveled a shotgun, loaded with fine
bird shot, and returned the fire, the
charge striking Sutter in the head
and inflicting a painful though not seri
ous wound. Sutter fell, but staggered
to his feet and shot once more, again
missing Dickey.
By this time the noise of the combat
hai attracted the neighbors, and the
men were placed under arrest. Sutter
declines to give any reason for the at
tempted murder beyond the somewhat
significant assertion that "dead men
tell no tales," from which it is supposed
that some criminal secret is shared by
the two men.

Secret of Waller's Escape at the
Hands of Last Year's
Jury.
Wsen Will Have to Satisfy the Inquiring
Body That His Demands Were
in Order. .
The Grand Jury met In session last
-jrfgrt, and the question of the Issuance
"by the Supervisors of permits for box
ine matches in this city was seriously
discussed. The matter occupied the
tine of the Jury for nearly two hours,
with the result that a resolution was
edopted by the entire jury that a state
ment should be sent to the Board of Su
pervisors by the Grand Jury, inform
ing them that they were acting illegally
In issuing permits for prizefights, as
their action was in direct contravention
of a State law. Comment was made on
the fart that almost all the boxing
matches which had taken place in this
city are fakes, and were only brought
about f"r the purpose of enriching
their promoters, who were men 01 no
standing in the community.
The case of Official Stenographer
Qisen was also under consideration and
was postponed until next Thursday, to
give the accused an opportunity of put
ting his case before the Grand Jury
personally. Olsen is accused of hav
ing defrauded the city of a large sum
of money by putting in a demand for
payment for many more folios than
had really been supplied to the city
by the accused. Police Judge L"vv had
â  certified *to the correctness of the sten
ographer's demand, but the Grand Jury
has fuund that the demand was unwar
ranted.
The case of the man Bonney. who
was accused of having hÂ«'ld up and
robbed a saloon-keeper in I he Mission,
was dismissed for want ol corrobora
tive evidence.
The betrayal of Miss Miller by Roy
Webster was the last cas.> to engage
the attention of the Grand Jury. Web
ster was charged in Police Judge Jo
aohimsen's court last December with
having betrayed the girl, who it is
claimed was under age, under th"
promise of marriage, but the case was
dismissed. The parents of the girl
have now brought the case to the no
tice of the Grand Jury, and several
X ; -"ple. including the Rev. Mr. Tubb,
were present to give evidence on be
half of the complainants. The case
went over until next Monday, and the
Grand Jury adjourned at 10:45 p. m.
SNARED BY WALLER.
Secretary Snook of the
Last Grand Jury Was
Forced by In
terest to Be
Friendly.
War the charge of betraying a pub
;iast which was made against
School Director Waller to the last
Grand Jury dismissed?
It was claimed, that the charge was
never taken official cognizance of by
that body, but was allowed to drop
quietly out of notice. The reason for
this action, or rather Inaction, on the
part of the last Grand Jury has just
jcome to light. The secretary of that
body was one James Snook, who, It Is
alleged, is a personal friend of Waller,
and is also largely interested in the San
â Francisco Real Estate and Investment
\Company, the corporation which has
f'jeap^d the Lincoln School lots from the
i-Board 'of Education. The nominal sec
[retary of the corporation is Henry Tre
: vor, bookkeeper for Benedick & Hast
jlngs of the Hastings clothing store, on
| Montgomery street.
When seen yesterday on the matter,
t Trevor Baid: "I have nothing to say
| about the corporation, and absolutely
[refuse to give the press any lnforma
. tion about the affair. It is not any of
th*Mr business who the members of the
' corporation are, and James Snook is
(not the secretary of the company. My
' employer, Mr. Benedick, Is largely in
(terepted In the concern, and that is all
*I have to say about the matter."
Trevor acknowledged that Snook was
also largely interested in the leasing
âºcorporation, and other people say that
"Waller knew this at the time his case
was presented to the Grand Jury of
â which Snook was secretary. At any
rate a large amount of secrecy has
been preserved in the transactions of
| the company, and as yet, it is impos
1 Bible to see the lease of the Lincoln
j School lots on the records. The Re-
I corder's office employes say that it
; could not be recorded as It was incor
rectly drawn up. The lease Itself Is
Very Jealously guarded by the secretary
0f the Board of Education, who does
not wish It to be seen by the public.
It Is securely locked in the safe, and
mo amount of persuasion yesterday
â  could Induce the office clerks to
.produce It for Inspection.

KNOCKED STIFF
A Short but Lively Battle at the
Excelsior Athletic Club
Entertainment.
im Riley Wins the Club's Cham
pionship in One and a Half
Rounds.
There was a full house at the enter
tainment given by the Excelsior Ath
letic Club last evening on Folsom and
Eighth streets.
The sport opened with three-round
bouts between the following boxers:
Jimmy Lawlor and Billy Lawlor, Pat
Lynch and Tom Devine, McGinnis and
Young Savage, Joe Kane and Joe lla
her, Billy Haskins and Billy Ott, P.
Lynch and Dan Kemp.
After the three-rounders had retired
to their dressing compartments, the
president of the club announced that
the event of the evening would be next
on the fistic bill of fare.
"Gentlemen," shouted the announcer,
"this next contest will be eight rounds,
and it must be fo-r a decision as I will
not stand for any more draws. An
other thing 1 want to say, and it is
this: The hall is small and we have
not any too much air, therefore I wish
you would quit smoking and shouting
while the contest is going on; let every
man be a committee of one himself to
keep order and decorum. Otherwise
the hand of Sergeant Michael Joseph
Conboy may be seen signaling tor
something, and I guess you all know
what that something means."
Jimmy Riley, 127 pounds, seconded by
Jimmy Lawlor, Martin Murphy and
Harry Baker, entered the ring. The
pugilist was followed soon afterward
by Jack Sullivan, his opponent, whose
wants were attended to by Charles
Conway, George Fletcher and John
McCormick. Frank Skuse was se
lected as referee and John Harrington
timekeeper.
The boys lost no time in fiddling and
"looking for openings," but went right
at the game like good little game
chickens the moment time was called.
The first round was give-and-take
and some hard punches were ex
changed. Riley's left swing bothered
Sullivan who caught each blow on
the neck or jaw. He did not attempt
to duck or side step, but was seeming
ly willing to give and take, and at that
style of fisticuffs he certainly had the
worst of the battle, although occasion
ally he surprised Riley, whose nose
stopped some hot shots. Near the fin
ish of the round Sullivan hit Riley a
beauty on the left eye which must have
caused the receiver to imagine that
the hall was chock full of electricity.
In the second round it was expected
that the fighters would take things
easy after the sharp rally In the first,
but such was not the case. They
seemed to put even more ginger Into
their punches than before, and the
spectators, especially "the guns," the
"McGills" and the "colonels," waxed
warm because of the excitement which
aroused them to cries of "give It to
him, Riley." "Wax him," Sullivan,"
etc.
The exchanges were many, and both
fighters were striving for a knock-out,
when Riley caught Sullivan a heavy
right-hand swing on the jaw. The re
cipient erf the smash staggered back
partly dazed, and attempted to fight
back, but the jig was up with him. He
was not given time sufficient to recover
his equilibrium. Riley. after a few wild
misses, put the right on the jaw again,
and Sullivan went sprawling on the
boards. He was up, though, before
the tenth second was called, only to be
knocked down again and counted out.
The contest, although short, was a go
from start to finish.
Mrs. Jack Dempsey, wife of the pu
gilist who died of consumption is seri
ously ill in Portland, as will be seen
from the following item which ap
peared in the Oregonian of February
10: Mrs. Jack Dempsey, formerly Miss
Maggie Brady, daughter erf James
Brady, continues very seriously 111, and
It is thought that she cannot recover.
Mr. Brady, her father, at whose home
she is, said yesterday that his daughter
was very low, although there had been
no material change in her condition for
the past few days. She has been grow
ing weaker constantly. She has been
in poor health for a lwig time, and
went to San Francisco for treatment
but received no benefit. She returned
home, where she has been ever since.
Ask for Dissolution.
The Bather Banking Company has filed
an application in the Superior Court for
dissolution. The company was organized
in March, 1837, and Jl/XW.OOO was subscrib
ed by the stockholders. The directors
who conduct the corporate forms of the
company and who now make application
for Its dissolution, are V. H. Metcalf, Ed
G. Lukens, William P. Johnson. C. S

SUPERVISORS ACT ON
THE FENDER QUESTION
Companies Given the Choice of
Three of the Devices That
Have Been Submitted.
The Board Expresses Itself In Favor of
Municipal Ownership of Water
Works.
After a long discussion, In which
some acrimonious talk was Indulged in,
the Board of Supervisors took action
yesterday that practically places at
rest the much-mooted fender question
and leaves the matter in such shape
that safeguards must be adopted at a
very early date.
The Health and Police Committee
submitted a report recommending that
the street-railroad companies be given
the option of selecting the Craig, Hun
ter or Douglas fenders. The latter is
the device that was offered in the com
petition by Manager Vining of the Mar
ket-street company. The same ground
was covered by a resolution that came
up late, it being also provided that the
selection of the fender must be made
within thirty days and the work of
placing them on the cars finished
within 120 days.
Several Supervisors spoke in favor of
immediate action, but Supervisor Clin
ton thought that in view of many cir
cumstances the companies should be
limited to a choice between two fenders
instead of three, and he offered an
amendment to the effect that one-half
of the cars should be equipped with
the Craig fender and the remainder
with the Douglas fender. The amend
ment was lost by a vote of 6 to 6, and
the original resolution was carried by a
vote of 8 to 4.
This sends the matter to print and
at the next meeting of the board it will
come up for final action.
A resolution was adopted declaring it
to be the sense of the board that the
city should own its own water works
In supporting the resolution, which
was carried unanimously. Dr. Clinton
took the occasion to say that the board
by adopting the Haskins schedule of
water rates had placed a burden on
the householders that could be re
moved by municipal ownership, and
that the city could save $745,000 per
year by the purchase of its own plant.
Chief of Police Lees was called upon
by a resolution to report whether or not
patrol drivers are permitted to carry
revolvers. This action arose out of the
shooting of Baldwin Gardiner. It has
been a mooted question whether the
fatal shot was fired by Burglar Stroh
Âr Driver Kelly of the patrol wagon,
who took a hand in the fray.
Supervisor Smith's ordinance requir
ing keepers of hotels and lodging
houses to examine the stop cocks of all
pas jets to prevent guerts from being
asphyxiated was finally passed.
Similar action was taken with the
order requiring house-owners to place
correct numbers on their houses in such
positions that they may be seen from
the street.
Judge Murphy appeared before the
board as the representative of the Chi
nese Six Companies and asked fifteen
days' extension of the order stopping
burials in the City Cemetery.
He stated that the companies were
making every effort to get a location
for a cemetery outside of the city and
county and that they were in a fair
way to succeed. The request was al
lowed.
The joint Committee on Hospitals and
Buildings reported that it had found a
place for the detention of the Insane
while in the care of the Sheriff. The
rooms selected are now occupied by the
carpenter shop and are in the basement
on the McAllister street side.

Attorney Galpin Promises to Show Up
Some Juggling With
Figure*.
The Bult of Charles B. Polhemus to re
cover $3000 with compound Interest run
ning back many yeara from the estate
of Charles Mayne was opened In Judge
Seawell's court yesterday morning. The
suit, while quite complicated, is very In
teresting in that It promises many sen-
sational developments, and will Involve
searching through railroad transactions
of the past thirty years.
The San Francisco and Ban Jose Rail
road was originally built by Polhemus,
Newhall and Donahue, each controlling
one-third of the stock. According to the
allegation of Attorney Galpin In the open
ing statement tne road kept running be
hind, and the Individual members of the
firm would loan the corporation money
drawing Interest at the rate of 11-3 per
cent a month. Polhemus began to run
short and had recourse to Mayne, from
whom he borrowed considerable, giving
Mayne in exchange one-half of his one
thlfd of the stock. Subsequently the
road was sold to the Southern Pacific
Company for $3,200,0000 while Polhemus
was abroad. Polhemus now alleges that
when he returned and asked for an ac
counting he was informed by Mayne that
there were no profits from the sale, as all
the money had been sunk in improve
ments to the road, purchase of real es
tate, etc. Later Mayne died, and in the
litigation of his estate the fact was de
veloped that Mayne had profited $300,000
by the sale of the road. Polhemus now
declares himself entitled to one-half of
this principal, which, with interest to

date, amounts to something like $600,000.
The morning session of vie court was
taken up with listening to Mr. Galpin's
opening statement and the afternoon to
Joseph L,. Wolcott, who acted as secre
tary and bookkkeeper for the company
up to the time of the sale of the road to
the Southern Pacific. Mr. Galpin then
read a long document which he claimed
was a statement of the condition of af
fairs just prior to the sale of the road.
He showed the paper to the witness and
asked if he recognized it. Mr. Wolcott
at once admitted the authenticity of the
document and stated that it was made
from the books of the company under his
direction for the purpose of closing the
books.
A set of books which the prosecution
claims to be the original books of Polhe
mus, Donahue mid Newhall was men
opened, and various items in the state
ment were compared with those in the
books and were found to agree in almost
every particular. The attorneys for the
prosecution hope by this means to prove
the genuineness of the books and have
them introduced as evidence.
The case will be resumed this morning 1 .
Was Not in Contempt.
Superior Judge Hunt yesterday sus
tained the demurrer of Sheriff Whelau In
the suit brought by Claus Spreckels to
compel the Sheriff to obey the order of
Notary Lee L>. Craig directing the im
prisonment of A. M. Lawrence for con
tempt. Judge Hunt held that the notary
had no power to issue the order for the
Imprisonment of a person for contempt,
and that in the event of a refusal of a
witness to answer a question it was the
duty of the notary to report such refusal
to the court, where the proper proceeding
against the witness refusing to answer
a relevant question could take place.
A Pleasant Sail.
James Kitterman, 1313 Stockton street,
treated the attaches of Judpe Joachlrn

America.. There were ample refresh
ments on board and as the day was fine
all thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The

PUT UP OR SHUT UP.
AN attempt of the Examiner to discredit a
news item published in The Call was met
yesterday by an offer of The Call to deposit
?iooo in the hands of Mayor Phelan to be distributed
among the charitable institutions of the city, if the
Examiner could prove that The Call was wrong
provided that the Examiner would put up an equal
amount to be distributed in the same way if The
Call was right. The Examiner was challenged to
meet this proposition: to put up or shut up.
In quoting from the Examiner the passage in
which the attempt to discredit The Call was made,
a mistake occurred in the use of names. (It is diffi
cult for sensible men to quote senseless things with
accuracy.) We do not intend, however, to allow the
Examiner this loophole to escape from the issue.
We therefore return to the subject in order to give
the extract from the Examiner accurately so that it
cannot make a pretense that we have misrepresented
it.
The case is this. The Call published a statement
from John R. Griffiths, a former inmate of the
Agnews Asylum for the Insane, to the effect that
Peter Camarinos, a patient in the asylum, had been
/ailed by his attendant, John W. Lynn, who recently
made an attempt in Oakland to kill his wife.
Griffiths claimed to have been an eye-witness of the
assault of Lynn upon Camarinos.
Upon the publication of this story in The Call the
Examiner said: "John R. Griffiths, who is respon
sible for the story, claims to have been an inmate
of the asylum at the time the alleged murder was
committed, and he has been quoted as saying that he
saw Lynn kill Camarinos. After the crime Griffiths
says he went to Fresno. This was about November
26, as near as he can fix the date. As a matter of
fact and record P. Camarinos died on December 8
last., or nearly a month subsequent to the time when
Griffiths claims Camarinos was murdered."
The Call repeats the statement that Griffiths was
present at Agnews when Camarinos died, and chal
lenges the Examiner to make true the charge of
error. The yellow journal cannot dodge nor sneak
away from the issue on the ground of misquotation.
The Call stands by the accuracy and reliability of
i's news. Will the Examiner stand by its words of
dtr.ial?
Here is a chance for the Examiner to do some
thing for charity and at the same time prove that
its reports are not always fake 3. We repeat what
we said yesterday.
The Examiner is so quick to discredit the reports
of its rivals, and so incessant in boasting its regard
for charity, it can hardly decline the proposition we
have made without stultifying itself both as a news
gatherer and as a patron of charitable institutions.
The issue before it is therefore plain. It must put up
or shut up.
It is presumptuous and vulgar in a disreputable
paper to try to boom a scheme to have Lin
coln's birthday made a national holiday. In the
first place the plan is not original. In the second
place the paper in question is a discredit to any
cause it may espouse. For it to link its own un
clean personality with the honored name of Lincoln
is an insult to the memory of that great and good
man. There is involved a principle similar to that
actuating the thrifty tradesman who stamps on the
national flag .the advertisement of a patent medicine,
and then, unfurling the emblem to the breeze, proudly
calls attention to his patriotism.
It is not often a funeral is marked by so much in
cident as that recently held in token of the death of
James Brogan. One brother was there in charge of
two policemen, having been permitted to leave jail
for the purpose. Another brother was taken from
the carriage of the chief mourners and dragged hand
cuffed back to the House of Correction, whence he
had escaped. The Brogan home may indeed be a
house of mourning, but rather for the living than
the dead.
The dangers of living burial are being greatly
magnified, but with what purpose does not appear.
There may be a chance of being interred while there
is still animation in the body, and there may be a
chance of being carried to heaven in a chariot of
fire. The evidence in support of either possibility
seems to be equally strong.
Some fault is being found with an Arizona woman
for having peppered a cowboy with bird shot, and
doubtless the criticism is just. It is accepted as estab
lished that when an Arizona cowboy goes on the
rampage his case cannot be treated successfully with
anything smaller than buckshot.
Apparently one of the strongest reasons urged why
Sherman should resign is that a gentleman named
Day is in that condition of mind which gave Barkis a
olace among immortals.
OUT OF TOWNE.
\\ R. TOWNE has opened the silver campaign
/ \ at the south end of the State. His speech at
* * Los Angeles is that of the politician whose
vocation of office-holding is gone, and is being pur
sued in its retreat in the hope of overtaking it by
attacking all other vocations. He arraigns every in
terest and every industry. Success in any is to him a
sign of infamy and evidence of oppression. Raising
high his banner, inscribed with free coinage of silver
at 16 to i, he summons his hearers to do battle under
it, because every business enterprise, every wage
paying industry, every profitable occupation in the
country is arrayed against it. He enlists all who have
failed, and all who have made no effort, and there
fore have not risked failure, and all politicians who
hanker after power, and have not found favor with
their party. An observer of events must be impressed
by the prospective effect of such politics upon the
community. The generation of men just coming
upon the active stage are told that it is no use to
strive as their fathers strove; that confronting the
battle of life they must lay down their arms without
striking a blow; that education and the qualities of
self-control, thrift and temperance, industry and
honor, will not avail any more. They are told that
all the successes they see around them, won by the
generation that preceded them, are the spoils of
craft and crime; that government is a fraud, law a
threat, Judges are jugglers and business ail offense
against the rights of man.
When the young were taught that success was open
to morality and self-denial; that fortune was the
good man's prize; that, given health and spurred by
industry, the world was open to achievement; that
no man could carry the pathway to fortune with
him as he walked its length, but must leave it to
be pressed by the feet of every generation that fol
lowd him, the tendency was to cultivate in men the
known elements which led to success. As these were
consistent with honesty and squared with honor and
manliness, generation after generation passed in
which they were preserved and depended upon.
Now there has arisen this new school of politicians
who impeach every human activity and denounce
every human effort that has paid the wages of labor
and profited by success. They coddle every man who
fails, for he is a victim of the criminal success of
another. They enter the home" of content to destroy
its peace, by exciting greeds and grudges. They
set men against men. They incite labor against its
employer, and advise that he be ruined. A percent
age of those just entering active life will take
them at their word that business is a criminal occu
pation and will enter it in that spirit. Others will
lag at the beginning and survive to recruit the army
of theoretical or practical anarchy. Whenever the
old moralities and the old manhood can be driven
out of their place as the promoters of contented lives
they will be expelled.
Now, who are these men who are making this
campaign against the structure of social health and
propose to tear down society and rebuild it upon the
foundation of its failures and its diseases? Mr.
Bryan and Mr. Towne are the leaders of that school.
What industries have they founded? What wages
have they paid, what men have they employed? What
hands have had labor and what mouths have been
fed by anything they have done?
Have they so far experimented with the industrial
and financial status which they impeach as to till a
farm, start a shop, employ labor, or pay wages?
They are both lawyers, and have both practiced.
Did they succeed in their profession? Are they not
doing better now as agitators than they ever did as
lawyers? What practical experience have they in
business enterprises that makes them the judges of
the world, and enables them to condemn every man
who has taken risks, who has borne the cares and
anxieties of business, who has strengthened his
manhood, sharpened his ingenuity and has found, in
his experiences, kindness and not condemnation for
his fellow-men?
They draw a black picture of existing conditions
and declare that its repulsive aspect will pass away
under free coinage of silver at 16 to I. How do they
know that? If every evil they pretend to see were
upon the country, how would their plan cure? Is
there anything in conditions in Mexico, China and
the other silver countries to prove what they say?
If the full habiliment of silver and its free coinage
as money can create the Utopian conditions they
prophesy for their policy, can they point to a present
or a historical example to prove it? Can their free
coinage scheme make business virtuous, men honest,
courts upright and legislation pure? If so, where
has it clore these things; where has it worked thesÂ»
transformations?
There be those among their followers who are
honest but deceived, while the promoters of the
movement who give it impulse everywhere are
simply agents of the deception in the hope that it
will Dring them office and power.
PERVERTED JUSTICE.
THE most extraordinary case of miscarriage of
justice which we have encountered for a long
time happened in Judge Campbell's court last
week. A man named Kirchhoff, who says he is a
grocer at the Mission, was arrested on Wednesday
at the corner of Third and Market streets on a
charge of looking too hard at the new Examiner
building. It was alleged that Kirchhoff was making
some kind of a disturbance, but to the arresting offi
cer he said he was protesting against the architecture
of the edifice.
When arraigned in Judge Campbell's court he
informed that eminent jurist that the building had
given him sore eyes, and he argued in extenuation of
his offense that the trimmings and terra cotta cor
nice of the architectural nightmare were sufficient to
malft anybody swear, especially if he contemplated
them in the light of two or three cocktails. "I don't
see why a man should be arrested for saying that a
building like the Examiner's gives him a pain," said
Kirchhofl; "I deny that I made the remark in a
loud or boisterous manner, and the officer stretched
his imagination when he charged me with disturbing
the peace."
Judge Campbell remarked that he had seen the
Examiner building himself, and that it had also
given him a pain. He regarded the edifice as the
very worst that had ever been perpetrated upon the
people of San Francisco, and he strongly intimated
that if the building were up before him on a charge
of assaulting the rules of architecture he would find
it guilty instantly. Regarding Kirchhoff's case, his
Honor said: "You were quite right in expressing
your opinion. The Examiner freely expresses its
opinion about everything, and I have never heard of
the proprietor being arrested for disturbing the
peace." Thereupon he dismissed the case.
It is such arbitrary rulings as this which are cal
culated to bring down upon the law the execrations
of the people. Kirchhoff should have been convicted.
He had no right to look at the Examiner building.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 18H8.
Contemplation of that horrible thing should be en
tirely forbidden. If people are to be permitted to
look at it, breaches of the peace in the vicinity of
Third and Market streets will be frequent and
flagrant.
We trust the people will retire Judge Campbell to
private life at the next election. He has no right to
dispense law in this way. What does he want in this
town? Anarchy?
IN many respects the most important news sent
down trom the revenue cutter Bear, now at
Unalaska, was the announcement that the seals
branded by the United States officials have in large
numbers returned to the seal islands, and are now at
their usual rookeries. This news, given on informa
tion received from Colonel Murray, the treasury
agent in charge of the islands, is authentic, and may
be regarded as finally settling the question of the
leasibility of solving the problem of protecting the
seals by branding them.
Many plans had been proposed and not a few of
them tried, for protecting our seal fisheries from
poachers, before President Jordan of Stanford sug
gested the advisability of branding the females so as
to render their skins valueless and therefore of no
profit to the poachers. The plan met with a good
deal of opposition. The most potent and frequently
made objection was that branding would so frighten
and pain the seals that they would abandon the
islands and seek rookeries elsewhere. This objection
is now disposed of. The seals have returned, and
there is no danger the rookeries will be abandoned.
Another objection often made was that the brand
ing would not so sufficiently destroy the fur as to
render the skins valueless for commercial purposes.
This also has been refuted by the reports from the
islands, as a number of the branded animals have
been examined, and in every case it has been found
that the brands are clear and distinct. According
to our special correspondent, Lieutenant Berry, "not
a single vestige of hair or fur remains in the wake
of the iron, although the mark is at least a year
old."
From these reports it seems clear the controversy
over pelagic sealing is settled, and the United States
has accomplished the protection of its seal fisheries
without the aid or consent of any other nation. In
ternational tribunals will no longer be necessary to
provide laws for the prevention of pelagic sealing.
We shall not have to carry on a further controversy
with Great Britain over the Canadian practice of
seal poaching. What statesmen and diplomatists
could not do, a simple plan devised t>y the exercise
It will not have escaped the attention of intelligent
men that this important item of news was treated
yesterday in a manner worthy of its importance by
no newspaper in the city except The Call. The
Chronicle contained the bare announcement from its
correspondent: "From Colonel Murray, special
agent in charge of the island, it was learned that the
branded seals were returning to the island rookeries."
The Examiner had a hardly more extended notice of
the fact, and that was huddled confusedly in the body
of a long report dealing with the general events of
the voyage of the Bear.
The information thus carelessly treated by our
contemporaries will De received throughout the
United States with more than ordinary gratification.
It promises to put a speedy end to an international
dispute which threatened to become chronic, and
involve the United States in endless difficulties with
Canada and Great Britain. It also assures relief to
the Government from a considerable portion of the
cost of patrolling the seas around the islands. As
our correspondent says: "With the female seals
branded in such a manner that the skins are value
less and with the bachelor seals herded in the salt
lagoon on St. Paul Island until the weather be
comes too bad for pelagic sealing, there will be no
profit in the business for the sealing schooners. And
we can easily protect the herd from raiders on the
islands, within or without the sixty-mile prohibited
area."
RELIEF FOR THE WHALERS.
REPORTS from our special correspondent,
Lieutenant Berry, show that the expedition of
the Bear for the relief of whalers imprisoned
in the ice of the Arctic Ocean had been attended
with good fortune up to the time of writing, and the
prospects then promised a successful accomplishment
of the relief.
As The Call was first to make a move for the relief
of the whalers, and as it was due mainly to the agitation
of The Call that the Government sent the Bear
northward on its mission of humanity and patriotism,
the good news is particularly gratifying to us. It will
be remembered that at the time the expedition was
proposed it was asserted in some quarters that the
season was too late for anything to be achieved in
the way of relief, and The Call furnished from ex
perts the information which finally determined the
Government to act.
At present the Bear is at Unalaska, safely har
bored, and the expedition under Lieutenant Jarvis is
making its way over the frozen coast line toward the
place where the whaling vessels are hard bound in
the ice. The distance to be overcome is estimated
at 1440 miles. It is impossible to calculate how much
time will be required to make the journey, but the
expedition is well equipped, and began the march
under favorable auspices, so that there is every
reason for hoping success will attend its efforts and
relief arrive for the whalers before any of them
perish from destitution in their prison of ice and
snow.
It is an heroic task that has been undertaken. The
sympathies of all classes of Americans are with the
brave men who in response to the call of duty have
dared the dangers of the Arctic winter for the relief of
their fellow-countrymen. Out of this sympathy there
will come a popular demand for greater care in the
equipping of Arctic whaling fleets hereafter. If the
Government is to interpose to save sailors from the
consequences of ill-supplied ships sent to the north,
the better way to do so would be to interpose before
the ships start, and see to it that the supplies are
sufficient.
Perhaps against the $2000 claim of Belew the
Examiner can set up the contention that it did not
know it was buying a second-hand confession. How
ever, in the eye of the law, ignorance excuses no
man. By carefully reading The Call the Examiner
may keep clear of such mistakes and avoid the
necessity of lagging more than twenty-four hours
behind.
If the persons who were publicly married on the
showing that they intended to go to the Klondike
were simply engaged in a pretense, there should be
some punishment for them. At least their presence
in this city casts a shadow of doubt over the police
assertion that all the bunko folk have left town.

THE ALARMING INCREASE OF OPHTHALMIA IN
SAN FRANCISCO.
n Open Letter to trje Board of Health.
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 1898.
To the Board of Health, San Francisco, Cal.â Gentlemen:
â  The importance of the subject to which I beg to call your
â  attention must be my excuse for addressing your honorable
â body.
I feel it my duty as a citizen and as a scientist to bring
â before your notice one of the gravest of dangers to the pub-
Ilic health. Partly through accident, partly because of the
â direction of my scientific investigations, I am enabled to
â point out to you the beginning of an epidemic which threat-
Bens our city. That the disease of which I speak rarely re
â sults fatally, only crippling and disfiguring its victims, is
â not a reason that it should be ignored by public officials, to
(whom the care of the city's health has been intrusted.
I refer, gentlemen, to the alarming increase of ophthalmia in San Fran
cisco.
It has not escaped the notice of even the most careless observer that the
proportion of those afflicted with some disease or other of the eyeâ nature's
most beautiful, most useful organâ grows greater annually. The knowledge
that with each succeeding year more and more people are wearing glasses
is common property. But the sudden increase, to which I refer, and which
has brought forth this communication to you, is a more serious as well as a
more insidious danger. And this menace it is my duty as a scientist to lay be
fore you; and yours, gentlemen, as public officials, to avert. For, as I have
said, it is only the beginning of the ophthalmic epidemic that I have to chron
icle. Whether it is to spread and destroy the sight and the beauty of our peo
ple, or whether it is to be stamped out in its comparatively innocuous birth,
rests with you.
It is seven days now Bince a citizen of San Francisco sounded the first
note of warning. -\Â» Â«.
On Tuesday, February 8, a worthy grocer of the Mission, B. Klrchoff by
name, was standing on the corner of Third and Market streets. I quote from
The Call of February 10. His eyes fell upon the Examiner building and in
stantly he became aware of acute suffering.
"That building," remarked Klrchoff, in his crude way, "that building
makes me weary."
Kirchoff, you see, though not a scientist, and perhaps not the most cultured
of men, was able to connect cause and effect. He suffered, and it was the Ex
aminer building which caused his suffering. When an officious policeman re
monstrated with Kirchoff, the latter only repeated his complaint, adding that
the eight of the building gave him sore eyes.
Poor Kirchoff! He was the first of a long army of ophthalmic martyrs.
The suffering grocer was arrested and brought before a police judge whose
fame is as great as his beard is long. The judge looked searchingly at the un
fortunate grocer, who sat still, shading his aching eyes with a trembling hand,
and a wave of sympathy came o'er the judicial breast.
"Release the prisoner!" exclaimed the wise man. "I have seen that build
ing myself. The only way to be near it and escape getting sore eyes is to be
blind."
This is the story. How have we benefited by Kirchoff's terrible experi
ence? What steps have been taken by the guardians of the city's health to
prevent a repetition of that experience?
It is with regret, gentlemen, that I must admit a feeling of keen disap
pointment when day after day passed and in none of the newspapers did
I find fufther mention of this most important matter. I inquired at the office
of your honorable secretary, supposing that the Board of Health had taken
action in the premises, and that its decision had, in some inexplicable way,
been overlooked. I was informed that the Board of Health of the city and
county of San Francisco had absolutely ignored the vital question; that no
record of its even having discussed the matter was in the secretary's posses
sion. I, therefore, deemed it proper to address you in this public manner.
It has been asserted that the proprietor of the building on the south
east corner of Market and Third streets is a very shrewd business man, who,
seeing the opportunity to make money out of his fellow-creatures' pain and
disfigurement, has Invested largely in the various opticians' establishments in
San Francisco, which are doing a Klondike business, I am informed. It is
difficult to believe that any human being, however degenerate, would deliber
ately provide the means of affliction, and afterward, in the most cold, yellow
blooded manner, make arrangements to benefit financially by the suffering
caused by his own bad taste, his own inartistic lack of a sense of the beautiful.
I must acknowledge, gentlemen, that my feelings in this matter are unus
ually strong. My own eyes have always been rather weak. At present I
wear two pairs of eyeglasses of such strength that it is necessary to have
them made to order. In addition, I am provided with an extra pair of green
goggles with extensions on the side, which I use on the. street. Yet I tremble,
gentlemen, I tremble, should those eyes, already weak and worn in scientific
research, by chance light upon the Examiner building. Of course, I never,
consciously, turn my steps in the direction of its hideous, eye-blasting, dis
cordant yellowness. Any detour I am compelled to make when business calls
me from my quiet study out into the whirl of city life is gladly undertaken.
I count no cost of extra time or exertion that will spare my poor eyes the
sight of that architectural monstrosity.
But it is no secret that students, like myself, are absent-minded; that un
worldliness and a dearth of where-am-I-ativeness Is the penalty science ex
acts from her devotees. I admit, frankly, that my mind wanders amid scien
tific abstractions at times, and forgets to watch closely over the body. Judge
of my horror, my dismay, when only the other day I found that, all uncon
sciously, I had walked in the direction of the Examiner, that Medusa of build
ings. I was actually but a few yards distant and facing the awful thing
when the close train of thought that had held me came to an abrupt end an,d
I realized my danger just in time to escape. Hastily I raised my thick um
brellaâwhich I carry for Just such frightful emergenciesâ held It carefully
between what is left of my precious eyes and that sight-destroying building,
and, boarding the first Market-street car, on the north side, of course, I was
soon out of danger.
But think, gentlemen, thinkâ if a corporate body can thinkâ of what might
have happened! Nay, of what may happen any day if, in the abstraction of
deep thought, one's eyes chance to really see that building!
As for my own eyes, I have watched them closely. I have had them ex
amined by the best oculists in San Francisco since that fateful day, and they
assure me that no Irrevocable damage has as yet been done.
I appeal to you, gentlemen, to save my eyes. Not only my eyes, but those
of a multitude of sensitive souls, who any day may be plunged into the black
ness of blindness by this unnatural, this cruel, this fearful sight.
I appeal to you in behalf of the children who rush carelessly upon their
fate, all unknowing the awful consequences of looking, though but once, on
the Examiner building.
I appeal to youâ yes, gentlemen, such is the impersonal Justice of science
âI appeal to you in behalf of those misguided, unfortunate men and women
whose energies are spent in the service of the man who has cursed San Fran
cisco by the erection of this building, which out^trolleys the electric cars in
the cruelty and ferociousness of Its appetite for sightless victims. I plead
even for the Examiner reporter. Though lost, apparently, to all the better
instincts of humanity, though deaf to all those sweet, elevating influences
which distinguish man from the lower animals, he is yet human. Save his
eyes, I implore you, though his soul be already lost.
Use the power which the people have placed in your hands. My Incapacity
in practical, every-day matters forbids my suggesting the means which your
honorable body might use to defeat the plans of- the man who has schemed
to destroy the sight of San Francisco, that she may not see the depth of his
jaundiced iniquity.
I deprecate lawlessness, though Its employment may be, apparently, for
the ends of justice. I would not have the architect of that building lynched for
this reason. Besides, there is another point to be taken into consideration.
No architect, in his right senses, would have constructed such an edifice. The
man who did this is either insane, and therefore not responsible; orâ which is.
no doubt, the true solutionâ the Examiner building is the architectural child
of its proprietor. The architect was but the instrument in the accomplish
ment of this crime against the structural beauty of our fair city..
I realize that the real criminal is beyond the jurisdiction of San Fran
cisco's courts. I am aware that he has powerful reasons for expatriating
himself. He dares not face his yellow Frankenstein. He fears for his own
eyesight, for even he could no-t look with impunity upon it.
But, ' gentlemen, I have faith in that excellence, in that intellect and In
tegrity,' which must have shone conspicuously In you before your fellow-citi
zens selected you for the distinguished positions you now hold. Whether you
shall decide, in your solicitude for that most precious thing, the health of the
people, to erect a wall about this eyesore, or whether you shall decree that
every eye (even that of the Examiner reporter) which, by any possibility,
might chance to gaze upon the blasting,
blighting thing in all its hideousness,
must be guarded and veiled behind
specially constructed and adapted spec
tacles, I know not. But with the fullest
confidence, the utmost trust in your hu
manityânow that I have opened your
eyes, which are themselves in danger,
rememberâ and in your ability to serve
the people, and to save us all from be
coming eyeless bipeds, walking in a
Mammoth Cave of darkness, over which
the Examiner building, like an exultant
yellow fiend, shrieks triumphant. I re
main, gentlemen, your most obedient
servant,

FUN AT THE MINING FAIR.
The Kennels of Big St. Bernard Dogs Formed an
Attractive Feature Last Night.
The heat and excitement, combined with
the bitter fact that she had been defeated
by lot-s than a half-minute in making a
world's soup-wrapping .record, caused
pretty Ij'.zzio Ohlendhorf to faint at the
Mining F;:ir last night. This unexpected
occurrence created considerable excite
ment for a while, and the young girl's
sister became hysterical and had to be
taken from the building by friends.
The soup-wrapping contest was the fea
ture of the evening, and there were four
contestants from the Xew England Soap
Company. The conditions of the event
were to wrap and pack 100 cakes of soap.
It was very close and exciting, and the
girls worked with lightning-like rapidity.
Ida Fairclough won by one cake in 6:05,
with Kittle Ray second, and Lizzie Oh
lendhorf a close third. The girls had just
left the stand when Lizzie was seen to
reel, but a friend caught her before she
fi il. She was carried into the ladies' wait
ing room and a physician summoned. Tho
Kirl was finally restored to consciousness
and taken to her home.
EMBEZZLEMENT
IS THE TOPIC
Checks Are Beginning to Make
Their Appearance in the
Figel Case.
Murder Evidence Delayed While the
Prosecution Endeavors to Fix
a Motive.
The Figel case reopened yesterday
iin Tiling before Judge Cook and jury.
Many witnesses were called for the prose
cution, but nothing of importance was
brought forth. At the present timo the
case seems to be considerauiy jumbled
up. In the morning general testimony
was given, but during the afternoon
on the entire testimony seemed to
hinge on the embezzlement and forgery
â  s, fur the purpose of showing a
â¢ for the alleged murder of Isaac
Hoffman. It looks as though the case will
consume over six weeks of Judge Cook's
valuable time.
James Bacon, a letter-carrier, was first
! called, and testified that he had removed
tetters from the letter-box on Bush
and Battery Btreets for the last time on
the evening of June 1 at 6:3 d o'clock.
He was followed by Harry Jacobs, a
man, who slated under examination
that he had seen Figel on Bush street
on the evening of June 1. after he had
cl ised up his business at 111 Bush street.
thai afterward he had seen and
] odded to John Lauer. The witness aiso
i that his office is in the west end of
â > , ! uildlng occupied by the firm ot Hott-
Rothchild & Co., and that his office
i- separated from rrie company's offices
lOard partition.
Isaac Gellert, manager of the firm of
Hoffman, RothchiM .V Co., testified that
Op to the Ist of lust June be had acted
sistant bookkeeper, and that up to
â¢ me of the shooting Mr. Shulte and
Figel had the keys to the front door,
but that one evening, while at work, Figel
told him that he had lost his key to
the main dour and was obliged to enter
<>n the Bush-street side.
U this time an argument arose as to
whether or not testimony which had
1 n given at the preliminary ex
amination should be read in the
absence of the witnesses. The Â»r

The National City takes up the strang
est load of freight that has ever left San
Francisco. Charges on 165 dogs were
paid, and these animals were all aboard
yesterday. The animals are muzzled, and
have their quarters on the upper deck.
They will be fed so many at a time, and
each dog will be muzzled again as soon
as hid meal is over. In this way it is
thought that free fights will be pre
vented.
Every man and woman who went away
on the National City yesterday was well
prepared to stand a siege of Arctic ice
and cold. All are able-bodied and well
supplied with everything necessary for
the venture, and not one but is
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1898.
The display of St. Bernard dogs under
the auspices of the St. Bernard Club of
California was the chief attraction yes
terday, and the dogs will ,be kept upon
exhibition to-day also. Their stands were
surrounded by large crowds of men and
women, who greatly admired the beauti
ful animals. Those who entered and ex
hibited the dogs were as follows:
Miss Fontana. 'Hmpress Josephine; Mr. Sbar
baro. Prince; H. McCracken, Presidio Belle
and Irma: Dr. t'luness Jr., Refflove Jr.; Mr.

General Barnes on the ground that How
ard Vernon, the Police Court stenogra
pher, who took the testimony, had not
been sworn in the case. Judge Camp
bell and Howard Vernon were called.
Judge Campbell stated that while How
ard Vernon was the official stenographer
of his department, and had been sworn
in as such, he was not specially sworn
in to take the testimony given in the
Figel case at the preliminary examina
tion. Howard Vernon substantiated the
Judge's testimony. Then Judge Murphy
moved to have the testimony of Mr. Hale
read, but an objection by the defense
was sustained by Judge Cook, after he
had listened to an argument.
During the afternoon session Dr.
Hirschfelder was called and testified that
he was professionally treating H. Basch
fo^ an illness which prevented his at
tendance in court. The testimony given
by him in the lower court was not read.
P. C. Hale testified th*. his brother, Mar
shall Hale, was in New York City, and
Henry L. Smith, secretary for the Hoard
of Trade, identified the handwriting of
Theodore Figel, which was written in
the body of a check. His testimony was
corroborated by Emmlt X.. Hewston, sec
ond assistant secretary of the Board of
Trade.
Then Edward S. Rothchild was called
to the stand. He testified as to his
business relations with Isaac Hoffman
prior to his death, and stated that Theo
dore A. Figel had been the bookkeeper
for the firm of HoffmTin, Rothchild &
Co. He said that he had issued positive
orders that no checks should be signed
by the bookkeeper, and that no letters
should be opened by him. Considerable
time was taken up examining the wit
ness as to the check held by the Board
of Trade for $436 3fi, but no points of more
importance than those elicited at the ex
amination in the lower court were
brought out. The witness stated that
he had no account with the First Na
tional Bank of this city, but the Paris
London and American banking firm car
ried on their money transactions, and
that Theodore Figel had been given no
authority to do business for the firm with
the National Bank.
Chief of Police L,ees was the next wit
ness. He stated that he had received
tags and checks from the First National
Bank on an order given him by the de
fendant. In the cross-examination Chief
I.ees said that the defendant had told
him of the accounts In the bank and had
willingly given him the order for the
tags.
Hvman Basch. a member of the firm of
J. Platt & Co., testified that his firm was
Indebted to Hoffman. Rothehlld & Co
and that on March 2.Â°, he had paid Theo.
dore Figel for the firm $306 and received
a receipt therefore, signed Dy the de
fendant. An adjournment was then taken
until to-day at 10 o'clock, when more
evidence concerning alleged embezzle
ments and forgeries will be given

rich on the 'Klondike. All day long the
fUp was besieged with crowds of curious
people, who wanted to see the gold-hunt
ers and their outfits. Every man had at
lfast half a dozen friends among the
throng.
Owners of missing dogs were there by
the dozen, and G. A. Putz had to give no
a fine animal which he had purchased
from a dealer. Manny P au i got out a
search warrant and took the dog away
in spite of Mr. Putz's protests. The eoid
hunter got another animal and left Â»

Dr. E. E. Hill of the Harbor "Receiving
Hospital lost his valuable mastiff and he
made a tour of the Alice Blanchard

the valuable brute. Later in the day the
doctor received a telephone message to
the effect that the dog had broken his
halter and was back home again.
Several women were also down to the
National City looking for their pets, but
were not allowed aboard, as it was too
ne.ir sailing time.
When the National City was leaving
the wharf one of the miners got up in
the rigging and began firing a salute
from his rifle. He was quickly brought
to his senses by the captain and con
fined his farewell to handkerchief waving

MOGAN AND HIS
READY PISTOL
The Deputy Fish Commissioner
Arrested for Assault to
Murder.
A Bullet From the Weapon Passes
Through a Door and Hits a
Paper- Hanger.
Joseph A. Mogan, Deputy Fish Com
missioner, was arrested yesterday after
noon by Policemen Pyle and Herlihy and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
assault to commit murder. He was short
ly afterward released on $1000 bonds.
Abount 1 o'clock Mogan was in Smith's
saloon on the corner of I>arkin street and
Birch avenue drinking with some friends.
He pulled his revolver out of his pocket
and it exploded. The bullet passed
through the bottom of the glass on the
front door and hit Gus Weber on the
right arm. The ball passed through the
fleshy part of the arm and nearly struck
a small boy. Weber is a paper hanger,
living at 1909 McAllister street, and was
walking past the saloon toward McAllis
ter street at the time. He had a very
narrow escape, as the bullet passed
across his abdomen and struck his arm.
An inch or two more and the conse
quences might have been serious to him,
if not fatal. He went to the Receiving
Hospital, and Dr. Bunnell dressed his
wound.
Mogan, after being arrested, was taken
to police headquarters, where he made a
statement that he was pulling out his
handkerchief from his pocket and in do-
Ing so pulled his revolver out also. While
taking the handkerchief away from the
revolver he might have accidentally
pulled the trigger and the explosion fol
lowed. He was talking to a man at the
time and could not have meant to shoot
him, as the bullet went in the opposite
direction. Weber was also taken to po
lice headquarters, and on his complaint
the charge was made against Mogan.
In the saloon at the time were Attor
novs G. Rose and Fred Frey, Deputy
County Clerk Williams, Clerk Hayes of
Judge Joachimsen's court and others.
They as well as the proprietor of the
saloon and the bartender, said there were
no angry words uttered In their hearing,
and they believed the shooting was purely
accidental.
CHARGED WITH INSANITY.
Helena Gurra Confined in a Cell Be
cause She Could Not Speak
English.
Helena Gurra, an Italian girl, 19 years
of age, came to the city on Friday morn
ing from San Mateo County to look for
work. She wandered around, and, feel-
Ing tired, sat on the steps of the Masonic
Temple to rest herself. She was discov
ered by the janitor, and as she could not
speak English he thought by her actions
that she was insane. She was sent be
fore the Commissioners, and not being
able to answer any of their questions, she
was taken to the Receiving Hospital by
a Deputy Sheriff. _
The girl is still in the hospital, but she
will be looked after to-day. Yesterday an
Italian interpreter had a conversation
with her, and soon learned that the girl
was no more insane than he was. A
cousin in Baden was communicated with,
and he will come for her to-day, but if
she should prefer to remain in the city
the Salvation Army will take care of her.

GAMPOLFS "HA-HA."
He Gave It to the Motorman of a
Mailcar, and Now Wishes He
Had Not.
J. Gampoll drives an express-wagon,
and In order to save his vehicle from
being torn to pieces on the rough pave
ments he used to drive his wagon with
the wheels on the rails or the streetcars
and give angry motormen and gripmen
the "ha-ha" while he took his time in
getting out of the way. But one day
last October he turned his head and gave
the "ha-ha" to the motorman of a United
States mailcar, and was arrested therefor,
although the charge in the complaint was
"retarding the United States mails."
Gampoli pleade* "not guilty" some time
ago, but he got tired of waiting for a trial
to sponge that disastrous horselaugh off
his memory, and yesterday he withdrew
his plea and acknowledged his guilt. He
will receive hie sentence next Thurrday
morning.
JILTED IN LOVE
SHE GETS ANGRY
Pretty May Fay Slaps
the Face of Alfred
Clement.
She Claims That He Deserted
Her for Another
Woman.
Arrested on a Charge of Battery
She Is at Once Re
leased.
Miss May Fay, an attractive young
woman, was arrested last night on a
warrant from Police Court No. 3,
charging her with battery. The com
plaining witness is Alfred Clement, a
clerk in a down-town insurance of
fice.
According to the story told by Clem
ent, Miss Fay is enamored of him. Re
cently he decided to "give her the
shake," as he expressed it, but she re
fused to give him up. He claims that
she was in the habit of meeting him
as he left the office in which he is em
ployed, and vainly endeavored to con
vince him of her "undying love" for
him.
Last Saturday, Clement claims, the
woman met him on Larkin street in
the vicinity of the City Hall, and
proceeded to "call him down" for not
reciprocating her affections. Becoming
angry, Clement took her by the arm,
intending to have her locked up. On
the way, he claims, the woman struck
him in the face with her open hand.
Yesterday he appeared in Judge
Joachimsen'g court and swore to a
complaint charging his pretty assail
ant with battery.
Judge Campbell at once released her
on her own recognizance.
Miss Fay said she was a stenogra
pher, and that she was employed in
the Baldwin Hotel. She claimed that
Clement fell desperately in love with
her. She returned his affection, and
according to her statement, he prom
ised to make her his wife.
Several weeks ago, she claims, she
met Clement with another woman, and
reprimanded him for what she termed
his unfaithfulness. He informed her
that he had transferred his affection
to the woman who was with him.
Becoming enraged at his conduct, she
says, when she met him last Saturday
she slapped his face.
The woman exhibited several letters
to Chief Lees which she received from
the gay clerk. They were couched in
endearing terms, the writer express
ing undying love for the pretty sten
ographer. Clement, it is understood,
will ask that the charge against the
woman be dismissed when it is called
in the Police Court this morning.
HONEYMOON INTERRUPTED.
Charles Atkinson and His Wife
Spend Some Hours in the
City Prison.
The honeymoon of Charles Atkinson, a
dairyman on a ranch at Clayton, Contra
Costa County, and his wife, Hilda, was
rudely interrupted yesterday morning by
a policeman, who called at the Yosemite
House, where they were stopping, and
took them to the City Prison. After re-
maining there for several hours they
were released.
Mrs. Atkinson's maiden name was
Hilda Rhine, and her father owns a ranch
in Clayton. She and Atkinson had been
keeping company for about a year, but
her father strongly opposed their mar
riage, on the ground of religious differ
ences, so they determined to get married
without his consent. She came to the
city about six weeks ago and got employ
ment in a store. Atkinson"s remunera
tion is very small, and last week she sent
him money to enable him to come to the
city. He arrived last Friday, and ob
tained a marriage license in Oakland.
They were married by Justice of the
Peace Clift on Sunday. A cousin of Hilda,
named Abe Rhine, came to the city, and
from a feeling of jealousy, she says, he
reported to the police yesterday morn
ing that she was under age. This led to
the young couple being taken to the City
Prison. She declared she would be 19 in
June, which was later confirmed by a
dispatch from her father, and they were
released.

OPPOSED TO THE POUND.
Potrero Nuevo Residents do Not
Want It in Their District.
Property owners and residents gen
erally in the vicinity of San Bruno ave
nue are opposed to the erection of the
public pound on that thoroughfare, be
tween Twenty-sixth and Army streets,
and the opposition has assumed definite
shape.
That the opposition is a determined one
is evinced by the fact that two petitions
against the "scheme have been signed by
every resident and property owner on
the block and In the vicinity, and be
sides, they have agreed to contribute a
sufficient fund to retain an attorney who
will take legal action in the matter. Gen

The Board of Supervisors mf-t yes
terday and made a present of $150,000
to the Spring Valley Water Company.
Through the solid vote of the "Shifty
Eight" the H.iskins water order now
in effect was adopted as the schedule
for the fiscal year ls;Â«S-9:i, notwith
standing the fight made by Supervi
sors Clinton, Dodge, Lackmann and
Rottanzi to prevent the imposition of
an ujijust burden on the already heav
ily taxed water consumers. The
"Shifty Eight" ware deaf to all argu
ments. They had made up their minds
to carry the programme through and
never for an instant did they hesitate
la their work.
The Committee on Water and Water
Supplies first met to consider the com
munication of the president of the
water company, asking the Supervi
sors to make provision for interest to
be paid $900,000 to be used in estab
lishing new pumping stations.
Chairman Clintun called the commit
tee together and after briefly stating
the object of the meeting said that he
and Dr. Dodge had drawn up a re
port which he would submit to the
members for their consideration. The
report was as follows:
San Francisco, Feb. 14. 1898.
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors
â Gentlemen: Your Committee <>n Water
and Water Supply, to whom whs referred
the communication from Charles VVohb
Howard, president of the Spring Valley
Water Works, asking that provision I>p
made for the extra expenditure of ISWO.'M)
during the coming year chiefly for new
pumping stations on the plea that the
water supplying the upper levels is liable
to become insufficient owing to a threat
ened dry winter, would respectfully re
port as follows:
We do not feel justified In adding this
heavy burden to the already overtaxed
ratepayers without some Investigation
being made by this board as to the neces
sity for this expenditure. We deem thin
investigation to be warranted in view of
the solemn, unqualified and oft-repeated
statements made to this board a f*Â»w
months ago by the chief engineer of this
company when he declared that the com
pany was prepared to abundantly supply
the entire city with water regardless of
the occurrence of two or even three suc
cessively dry winters.
We therefore recommend that his Hon
or the Mayor appoint a competent engi
neer to represent this board and report
at our next rpgular meeting as to the
necessity of this large expenditure of the
â public funds.
C. A. CLINTON.
WASHINGTON DODGE.
"I move the adoption of the report,"
eaid Supervisor Dodge. "The board Is
not ready to Impose this additional
heavy taxation on the people on the
unsupported statement of the com
pany's officials. We should have the
pplnion of an engineer representing the
board on this matter. It may be just
es the company representsâ that new
pumping stations are necessary- If bo
I would favor granting the request of
the company. Until we have that tes
timony before us I think we should not
act."
"Did I understand you to say," asked

From a Well-Known

Poverty and Hunger the Lot of Many

A recent letter from Dawson ; City
tells of dire famine, and it seems that
the relief expedition will be of very lit
â¢tle use unless it shall arrive in Dawson
2)y the middle of the present month.
Professor Price, the well-known as
sayer of this city, has received a letter
from Augustus J. Bowie, an authority
on hydraulic mining, now in Dawson
tor a New York syndicate, which fully
describes the situation there. The let
ter is dated December 3. In it Bowie
says:
Noto the hour and the temperature
2:50 p. m. and 20- degrees below zero I
have just returned om a trip up the
Tukon to tho Klondike, only a mile abovo
this piace, and have said j-ood-Uy to the
sun for to-day. The mines aru all frozen
and we are enjoying tho pleasures of an
Arctic winter with none of the comforts
of civilization. Our : means -of transport
are nominally by dog sleds, but shoulU
you for one moment think that you
â¢would enjoy a sled ride of this kind you
would be sadly mistaken. A trip with
dogs up here means going on "shauk's
mare.". If you ride you are Â»~ thrown out

yourself on the point of freezing stiff,
"With a possibility of leaving one of your
extremities in the sled.

that as a matter of fact I do not feel

Supervisor Morton, addressing Dr.
Clinton, "that you and Dr. Dodge had
a little caucus and that this programme
le the result of it?"
"There was no caucus," replied Dr.
Clinton, angrily. "This report was
drawn by me in the hope of facilitat
ing matters. I read it over to Dr.
Dodge, and as he concurred in It he
signed it."
."I move that the request of the com
pany be denied," said Supervisor Britt.
"1 don't see any m-ed of delay in this
matter. We dallied with the rates last
year andâ well, we got into trouble I
don't want any more such experience."
"1 am also opposed to any delay
such a* is contemplated by this re
port." interrupted Supervisor Morton.
"I am as ready to vote now as I will be
a week hence."
"So am I," chirruped Supervisor
Rivers.
Dodge said that the report of the en
gineer would be ready Monday, and
that no harm could possibly result
from a continuance of a week.
"The papers are all crying that the
Spring Valley Water Company is get
ting too much money now, and I am
willing to take a chance on their end
this time," said Britt. "If the company
has to have the new pumping sta
tions let them pay the Interest on the
bonds issued out of the 6 per cent div
idends now being paid the sharehold
ers. If necessary let them cut their
dividends down to 2 per cent for a
change."
Supervisor Clinton deprecated any
hasty action. "It is our sworn duty to
guard against any possible water fam
ine," said he, "and if an engineer ap
pointed by the Mayor should report
that the pumping stations are neces
sary I would not for an instant stand
in the way of the company providing
them."
'I am ready to vote now," said Britt,
"and as an amendment I move that the
communication be placed on file and
the request denied."
Morton seconded the amendment,
whereupon Supervisor Dodge remarked
that some of the members had experi
enced a great change of heart since the
last schedule was adopted.
Supervisors Clinton and Dodge ar
gued that time should be given to as
certain if there were any possibility of
a water famine.
"What need is there for an engi
neer?" asked Britt. "I think the ex
pert appointed by the Mayor would re
port against the expenditure and would
be appointed for that purpose."
"We have the utmost confidence in
the honesty and integrity of Mayor
Phelan," replied Dr. Clinton sharply,
"and I think the insult offered him is aa
undeserved as it is gratuitous."
"We don't all see things in the same
light," retorted Britt.
The roll was called on Britt's amend
ment to deny the request of President
Howard and it was carried, Britt. Riv
ers and Morton voting in the affirma
tive and Clinton and Dodge in the neg
ative.
"There Is something In the wind,"
significantly remarked a bystander as
the committee adjourned to the board
room, where the other Supervisors were
â waiting to sit as a committee of the
whole.
Supervisor Clinton was called to the
chair and all the Supervisors answered
the roll call.
"If Engineer Schussler is present,"
said Supervisor Smith, "I wish he
would take the stand as I have a few
questions to ask him."
Schussler took the witness seat and
settled himself down as if expecting to
be compelled to undergo a lengthy ex
amination.
'What was the last issue of stock ?'"
asked Smith.
Francisco, for the sum of $5, so you
can have some idea of what things cost
here. Meat now is $1 50 per pound whole
sale; flour, $135 per sack of fifty pounds.
Men are paid $1 50 an hour, and they are
not worth that much per diem. Without
exception this camp has fewer mining
men than any other place I ever was in.
They have not the slightest conception of
mining. The only wonder to me is the
fact that this place has been able 'to
exist as long as It has under tho terrible
prices here demanded Cor everything.
People in San Francisco â even Sloss &
Co. â cannot conceive the condition of af
fairs here. There Is absolutely nothing
to be obtained, and it will be fully two
yeai-s before these mines can be han
dled as they should be on account of the
want of the ordinary essentials for work,
let alone living. Wood sells here at $50 a
cord. There is plenty of it, but no means
of quick or easy transportation.
To go back to the mines, they are cer
tainly extraordinarily rich, but this
present system of work must be largely
or entlreiy abandoned and corporations
must take hold and ciean out this crowd
of good-for-nothings and a new era will
duvvn. As for the Alaska Commercial
Company and the North American
Transportation and Trading Company,
the only two business concerns here,
they must be met with a decided opposi
tion, and traders must come in here,
where there is ample room. If transpor
tation lines are established. Situated as
these companies are, they will throw
every obstacle in the way of any and
everybody coming in to compete with
them and thus keep up all their sales,
and slowly but surely absorb all the
gold output by the infamous prices of
supplies.
The Alaska Commercial Company dur
ing the present famine has never raised
the prices on any staple article and has
been very just, but the North American
Transportation and Trading Company, as
soon as its nds that the Alaska Com
mercial Company has sold out any ar
ticle, jump the price 300 per cent or more.
Cor', oil Bella for $-iv r>"r gallon and can

mands $5 per bottle, and you can buy but

Light Just now is the most important
proposition on hand. One cannot buy
candles or oil now for love or money,
and I can't say how I am going to drag
out some of these long nights. I have
only spent one night in the town, as the
place is absolutely too disgusting for any
thing. Gin mills, loose women, dance

THE BA->T FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBBITARY 15, 1893.
"I have been told it was 7000 shares,"
replied Schussler.
"When was it issued?"
"I have been told since the new year,"
was the answer.
"Is the company paying interest on
the same?"
"I understand it is proposed to do
so."
"That's all," and Schussler, with a
sigh of relief, took a seat by the side
of Attorney Kellogg.
"If there is nothing new to be
brought up," suggested Dr. Dodge, "we
might excuse the witnesses subpenaed
here."
"Have you anything else to offer?"
asked Dr. Clinton of Attorney Kellogg.
"Nothing," he replied. "We have
presented our case."
Dodge then moved that the commit
tee take up the discussion of the sched
ule of rates and Britt seconded the mo
tion.
The majority report of the Committee
on Water and Water Supplies, signed by
Britt, Morton and Rivers, was then
read by Clerk Russell. It was as fol
lows:
To the Honorable t..e Board of Super
visors of the City and County of San Fran
ciscoâGentlemen: Your Committee on
\\ ater and Water Supplies begs leave to
state that the annual statement of the
Spring Valley Water Company has been
examined and consideration given to that
statement which shows that the actual
increase on the income of said company
over that of last year is only J5948, shew
ing clearly the effect of the resolution
which your honorable board passed reduc
ing and fixing the rates for the year com
mencing July l. 1897. Notwithstanding
Ihe increased Income from the city and
county and from water rate*, and al
though the collections of the rates >=o
fixed are for a period of six months, the
result has conclusively shown that the
said resolution has materially reduced
the income of the company.
The investigation last year was pro
longed, and very fully presented the
questions that were to be adjudicated.
The fact that every indication points
to a dry winter and the consequent ex
pense entailed by reason thereof in pump-
Ing water to the high levels for the pro
tection of life and property and to afford
v pl'-ntiful supply for sanitation cannot
be lost sight of, and while your currmlttoe
does not feel justified inrecommendtngany
increase in the rates, yet every considera
tion induces your committee not to cur
tail the revenue of the company, as tne
works must be adequate at all* times io
furnish such a supply of water as may
be required for the use of the inhabitants
and for protection against fire.
As stated, the actual revenue of the
company was $5D48 for the year 1897 in
excess of the year 1&96, and certainly no
good reason appears to warrant disturb
ing or changing the rates heretofore
established.
Your committee has considered the
communication from the Spring Valley
Water Works for an Increased allow
ance for pumping and the construction of
additional works, and is opposed to and
report against making any additional al
lowance, as the company has it in its
power to regulate its expenditures and
by this power to determine the amount
of the interest to be paid on the stock of
the company.
A majority of the members of your com
mittee, believing that any further post
ponement of this question may be taken
advantage of and place the board in an
anomalous position, are, therefore, of
opinion, and so report, that the rates
charged and collected for the year com
mencing July 1. 1897. be established as the
rates to be charged for the year com
mencing July 1, IS9B, and that a resolu
tion embodying said rates be adopted by
your honorable board.
Dodge moved that the report be di
vided into two sections. "Let us first
vote on the adverse report to the
granting of the request of the water
company concerning the pumping sta
tions," said he.
There was no objection, but before
proceeding the minority report, signed
by Drs. Dodge and Clinton, was also
read.
Chairman Clinton ruled that the mi
town who earns a scanty living by mak
ing fur caps was sitting in her cabin sew
ing with her feet resting under a Yukon
stove (a mere eheetiron box. Not being
a capitalist, she had only green wood to
burn, and not much of that. This kind of
wood gives out very little heat, ajid when
the poor creature tried to arise from her
seat, she found that both feet had been
frozen as far as the ankles. Needless to
say, she had to have them both ampu
tated.
Some large sales have been made here
to Eastern parties, $324,000 having been
paid for three claims on Bonanza Creek,
and $24,000 for two others. Twenty have
been bought on El Dorado Creek for $100,
000. Sulphur -and Dominion creeks now
offer the best advantage for money. The
yield of all the claims will, I think, be less
than last year, as there are no supplies
here for labor or materials to work with.
And the famine is sure to kill off many
laborers. If I do not starve to death I
Bhall be very lucky.

nority report, recommending the em
ployment of an engineer, had prece
dence.
"Before you proceed, gentlemen,"
said Attorney Kellogg, "Engineer
Schussler would like to make a brief
statement."
"I think the board thoroughly under
stands everything," said Dodge, "but
I will not offer any objection to grant-
Ing Engineer Schussler the privilege of
a statement."
Schussler said that It was a year ago
instead of a few months ago when he
announced that the company had an
ample supply of water to furnish the
city, in the event of there being two or
three dry winters. "We still have
enough water," he added, "fur there
is 1,400,000,000 gallons in the Crystal
Springs reservoir. It is the upper res
ervoirs that supply the Western Addi
tion that are nearly depleted. Then
the request for |900,000 has not been
clearly explained. Two hundred and
eighty thousand dollars of the sum is
wanted for a new pipe line from San
Andreas, as the one in use is about
worn out; $200,000 for extending mains
in the city in the outlying districts and
$320,000 for new pumping stations to
get water into the reservoirs on the
upper levels."
"Don't you think that under the ex
isting rates you can set aside enough
for all that work?" asked Supervisor
Smith.
"I don't think so."
"I think that an engineer should be
appointed to look into the pumping
station question, " paid Dodge. "The
Western Addition is building up rap
idly and more water is required there.
In addition there has been a great
waste of water. I don't think it fair
to say to the water company that we
don't believe the statement that addi
tional pumping stations are required."
"I shall vote to give every one a fair
chance," said Dr. Rottanzi, "and I hope
the minortiy report will prevail."
A vote was taken and the minority
report lost, Dodge, Lackmann, Rottan
zi and Clinton alone voting for it.
The majority report, in so far as it
related to denying the request for
pumping stations, was carried without
discussion.
The matter of adopting the Haskins
order was then taken up for considera
tion.
Supervisor Dodge said he wished to
introduce an amendatory resolution
and schedule, whereby at least $128,000
could be saved to the city after giving
the water company all it asked for.
Britt was opposed to any schedule be
ing introduced at that time. He said
that the adoption of the report would
not fix the ratÂ»s. That would have to
be considered afterward.

BONDHOLDERS
WIN A VICTORY
The Supreme Court Reaffirms
Its Decision in the Sacra-
mento Case.
A Case Which Involves the Question
of Bonds Bearing Interest
After Maturity.
The Supreme Court handed down a
decision yesterday in which a bare ma
jority of Justices reaffirmed a former
decision by the same court on the 9th
of June, 1896. The decision affects cer
tain bondholders who hold the bonds
of the City of Sacramento issued by
authority of the Legislature in 1858,
maturing in 1888, and bearing a cer
tain i*ate of interest, as provided in the
act of authorization. The question at
issue is whether the bonds should
cease to carry interest after date of
maturity or not.
The case at bar was commenced in
Sacramento by W. S. Kendall against
the Treasurer of that city, and the
Treasurer entered a demurrer, which
was sustained by the Judge of the Su
perior Court. From this position E. S.
Pillsbury, a San Francisco attorney,
took an appeal to the Supreme Court.
The court in June, 1896, sustained the
position taken by Mr. Pillsbury. In
this decision, which was written by
Justice Henshaw and concurred in by
Juetices Garoutte, Temple and Harri
son, the Judge of the Sacramento
court was instructed to vacate his
order sustaining the Tresurer's demur
rer and have him put his answer in,
thus permitting the case to proceed to
trial on its merits.
The City of Sacramento then applied
for a rehearing of the case in bank.
This petition was granted and the case
was heard a second time by the Judges
of the Supreme Court, with a precisely
similar result. The concurring opinion
slmpiy said "for the same reasons as
given in the decision of June 9, 1896,
the case is sent back with instructions
to the trial court to vacate Its previous
order and permit the Treasurer to an
swer."
Justice McFarland simply quotes his
dissenting opinion as written by him
on the former decision, while Chief
Justice Beatty devotes several pages
plied Dodge, "it practically amounts to
gag law. 1 think I should be given an
opportunity to prove, if I can, that the
Haskins order as now in operation will
give the company much more than is
asked during the coming fiscal year. It
will also give the company 6 per cent,
whereas we are pledged to only allow 5
per cent on the invested capital. The
members of this board cannot be ex
pected to stultify themselves. If they
adopt the report it is not likely that
they will afterward vote against the
Haskins schedule. It is strange that
Supervisor Britt wants to vote before
hearing all the evidence."
Supervisor Smith said that he could
not see any objection to giving Dodge
an opportunity to be heard.
"This matter means a saving of fully
$128,000 to the city," said Chairman
Clinton, "and Dr. Dodge should be
listened to."
Britt withdrew his objection and
Dodge proceeded. "I am going to
prove." said he, "that the Haskins
schedule gives the water company
much more than it asks for at our
hands. I will use the figures given by
the company's officials to prove my as
sertion. Secretary Booker testified that
the revenue from householders amounts
to $1,800,000 annually. He estimates the
rents of the new building at $27,000 and
increased business at $65,000, making a
total annual revenue of $1,892,000. What
does the company ask for? Four hun
dred and ninety-eight thousand five
hundred dollars for interest on bonds,
$105,000 for taxes. $43,000 for interest on
floating debt, $400,000 for running ex
penses. Now in my figures I have al
lowed $460,000 for running expenses, as
I thought the pumping stations might
be allowed. I allow $697,000 for divi
dends at 5 per cent, making a sum total
of $1,803,500, or $88,500 more than the
company asked for. You decided to re
fuse to allow interest at 6 per cent on
$900,000 for the stations, and that is
another saving of $54,000, making a to
tal of $142,500 given under the Haskins
order in excess of what the company
require. "We can easily cut down this
surplus of $142,500 and deal fairly with
the company. Secretary Booker testi
fied before us that the income for 1897
from meters was $542,000. I propose
that we make a cut of 10 per cent in
the existing meter rates. From the
same source we receive the information
that the receipts from householders on
floor space amounted to $484,980. I pro
pose a cut of 20 per cent on household
er rates, amounting to $96,996. This
would make a total cut of $151,196. Bear
in mind that I have left $60,000 in the
running expense account that is not
necessary, as the pumping stations are
not to be granted. What is the result?
The company stands $51,404 ahead after
making a 10 per cent cut on meters and

clusion Justice Van Fleet concurs with
his chief.
As the case now stands It will have
to be tried in one of the Superior
Courts, and the question whether the
bonds shall bear interest after matur
ity or not will be finally determined.
As it now stands Mr. Plllsbury has
scored a point in the interest of the
bondholders.

Accepts a New Position.
F. F. Connor, general agent for the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany, will shortly leave that position to
take charge of the business of the Pana
ma Railway and Steamship Company,
which has been without a representative
here for over a year. Mr. Connor's
authority will extend to all the company's
business on the Pacific Coast of North,
Central and South America, reaching as
far south as Valparaiso.
General Manager R. 1,. Walker of the
same company is at the Palace, and says
ho expects the new wharf at Panama,
which is three miles in length, will be
finished about June next.
The Pool Tournament.
In the handicap pool tournament now
being held at Frank's billiard parlors, on
Sunday night Jim Burrows, the present
champion of the Pacific Coast, after a
hard-fought and briliant game, was de
feated by Swain, who played 90 oalls to
the champion's 100. The score at the finish
was 90 to S6 in favor of Swain, and Bur
rows' defeat was somewhat of a surprise
to his admirers. The same evening- Cash
Sloan, the jockey, was rather easily dis
posed of by Johnson, who won by the
score of 100 to 53.
Pulled His Whiskers.
W. P. Bock, proprietor of the Valencia
Hotel, 718 Valencia street, obtained a war
rant in Judge Campbell"s court yesterday
for the arrest of R. Reordon, his cook, on
the charge of battery. Bock said that he
and Reordon had a dispute Saturday
night about wages, and the cook, after
swearing at him. took hold of his long
whiskers and twisted them so hard that
he nearly fainted. He has been unÂ»i>lÂ« to
sleep since from the oain.
20 per cent on householder rates. These
calculations are made from the com
pany's figures and I challenge anyone
to prove that they are incorrect. If we
adopt the Haskins order as it now
stands we will violate our pledges to
the people by giving the company over
5 per cent interest on the investment.
They can pay interest at 6 per cent on
$900,000 they claim they require and
still have an excess of $88,500."
"From these figures," said Dr. Rot
tanzi, "it can be easily seen that the
company can pay 6 per cent and still
have a balance of nearly $10,000 at the
end of the year. Then we have not
taken into consideration the rental that
will come from the company's old
building on California street."
"Have the company officials any
questions to ask me?" asked Dr. Dodge.
Schussler and Kellogg remained si
lent.
"The company admits the correct
ness of my figures by its silence," add
ed Dr. Dodge. "I now move that the
new schedule be based on the Haskins
order, with a 10 per cent cut in meters
and 20 percent on householder rates. In
order that the members may have time
to consider the matter I move a recess
until 1:30 o'clock this afternoon."
Sheehan objected to a recess and
Dodge withdrew his motion. "I don't
see how any member can vote for the
Haskins order in the face of these fig
ures," added Dodge, "and keep his
pledge to the people. If the board re
fuses to accept my order a serious mis
take will be made and the members
placed in a bad light. I now move that
my order take the place of the Haskins
order in the report of the Water Com
mittee."
Lackmann seconded the motion.
Dr. Rottanzi offered as a substitute
measure an order providing for a 10
per cent cut in meter rates and that
hydrant rates be reduced from $5 to
$2 50. "A schedule of this character,"
said he, "will mean a reduction of
$150,000."
Dr. Clinton then took the floor after
calling Dr. Dodge to the chair. "I de
sire to introduce," said he, "the sched
ule I presented last year making a
clean cut all around of 20 per cent. I
know that it is useless to waste time in
argument, for I regret to see that most
of the members have made up their
minds. The figures presented by Dr.
Dodge show that if the Haskins order
Is again adopted it means nothing more
and nothing less than a present of
$150,000 to the Spring Valley Water
Company. Any one of the last three
measures Introduced will give the
members a chance to redeem their
pledges. My schedule will give the com
pany 4 per cent interest, and as it had
6 per cent last year it will amount to

The Clinton order was then taken up
and defeated by the following vote:
Ayesâ Clinton. Dodge. Rottanzi.Lack

ny, Sheehan, Morton, Britt, Smith and
Rivers.
"The memebers are putting them
selves in an unenviable light." said
Dodge, warningly, "by giving the com
pany more than it asks."
"The Haskins schedule has been in
operation fiÂ»r going on eight months,"
replied Britt. "and I have not heard
any serious opposition to it. It is bet
ter to stick to it than try new experi

A vote was taken on the Rottanzi or
der, and it was defeated by the same
vote as the Clinton schedule.
"It is wrong, gentlemen," said Clin
ton, "to present the Spring Valley Wa
ter Company with $150,000."
The solid eight paid no heed to his
remarks, for they promptly voted down
the Dodge order.
"I move that the report of the com

"We had better take an adjournment
until 2:30 o'clock," suggested Clinton,
"in the hope that some of the members
may experience a change of heart."
"We don't want any recess." said
Britt. "We can soon finish up the busi
ness."
The report was adopted by the same
vote as before, and Britt moved that
the Haskins schedule be adopted for
the fiscal year 1898-99.
"Let us postpone action until the reg
ular metting of the board next week.
The Supreme Court may in the mean
time decide that we are not legally in
office," said Clinton.
"I have stood all the abuse I am pro

Britt, "and I am prepared to vote. I
move that we rise as a committee of
the whole and report back to the

Clinton. Dodge. Lackmann and Rot

"Can we do so?" asked Dodge.
"Should the matter not be taken up

A Clean Production That Ban

"The Girl From Paris."
The New Opera Not

But It Is Legitimate and
Has Delightful Pictures
and Spirited Music.
SOCIETY NOT ALL THERE.
A Large but Not Brilliant Audience
Applauded the Good Par
formance.
All clammy recollections of the late
"Girl From Paris" were swept out of
the Baldwin last night by those reliable
and virtuous entertainers, the Bos
tonians, who appeared in a new three
act comic opera, the book by Harry B.
Smith, the music by Victor Herbert,
and the title "The Serenade."
There are several reasons why "The
Serenade" should be received with
kindness and consideration. For one,
we have had such a wholesale dose
ately of musical comedy, musical farce,
musical vaudeville and all the mongrel
mixtures of so-called melody and mirth
that anything in the line of a legiti
mate effort deserves attention. For
another: Ever since the Bostonians
first produced "Robin Hood," it has
been the common practice to hold up
their new j>;> <â âº-* to odious comparison
with that merry masterpiece â which is
hardly fair, considering that De Koven
himself never has been able to compose
anything half bo good, And for an
other: Everything the Bostonians do
is done with such easy art and effi
ciency; th<-re is so much ideal liberal
ity shown in the distribution of parts
that not "M" star but five or six warble
in the chol< â¢â¢ Bungs and bathe in the
rich calcium thut settles in the cen
ter nf the stage; the costumes and the
scenery wear so convincingly the stamp
of having been designed expressly for
the occasion; the celerity that comes
only of accomplished stage manage
ment is so delightfully apparent â in a
ward the Bostonians have a method
and an atmosphere in themselves that
is pretty sure to make good entertain
ment of anything their judgment urges
them to undertake. And anyone who
has followed the comic opera output of
the last five years will know that "The
1 Serenade," while rich in unevenness
and imperfection, is not to be despised.
It has bright, pretty pictures, plenty
of gr>, in a reckless sort of way, and
music which is eminently singable and
full or color, smash and bing, even if
it is not the sort that follows you home
and prompts the Aeolian pucker.
I will not press the value of Mr.
b's Btory, which, fortunately for
me, was most hopefully foretold in yes
terday's Call. Mr. Smith has the germs
of a good story. He says they wore
suggested to him by an interlude of
GoldiiU's. Mr. Smith doubtless is my
senior, since my first meeting with his
"suggestion" dates from an early per
formance of "Nanon." There is a par
ticular tune in "The Serenade," as there
is in "Nanon," and this tune forms the
basis of a not unusual plot in which
various identities are variously con
fused and discovered in the complicated
ourse of its popularity. Delores hears
the barytone sing it at the opera and
straightway falls in love with him.

capacities contrives to keep in the
hborhood of his sweetheart.
But other susceptible ears have
hoard the tittilant tune, and other
hearing of the enraged Puke. First it
is a crushed tenor who essays to sing
it in trio with a tailor, who is also
enamored of Dolores, and the tailor's
daughter. Yvonne, who is in love with
Alvarado. The tenor is captured, and
you hear no more of him. Then it is
taken up in other forms; everybody has
a pipe at it; from the girls in the con
fto the monks in the monastery.

handling, and I must say that Mr.

with honors, even if I cannot keep pace
with Mr. Smith's accompaniment of

AY e have come to hold all the old
standbys of the Bostons almost aa Na
tive. Sons and Daughters, but last
night there was a special interest felt
in the return of Alice Nielsen. Miss
Nielsen I first heard at the lowly Wig
wam, then later at the Tivoli, and al
ways doing better and better work.
Now she is a member of the swellest
comic opera organization in the land,
and soon she will be a star "out on
her own" with the genial and only
Cowles heading her support. I think
Mis? Nielsen is lucky, as well as tal
ented. Compared with Delia Fox and
Pauline Hall or any one else we have
had here in recent years she is won
derful. Compared with Lillian Russell
she is not quite so wonderful, and com
pared with Camille D'Arville she is not
wonderful at all. I cannot wholly
agree with the several New York crtics
who think her the cleverest soprano
in comic opera. Hut she has a lithe,
seductive personality, an agreeable air
of sans Kene and a deliriously sweet
and lissomely cultivated voice. She has
the birdie note in its superlative.
Miss Nielsen's is the part of Yvonne,
which is musically notable for a bolero
and a waltz song with fancy trills and
staccati at the close. These she sings
to perfection.
Jessie Bartlett Davis is the songster
struck Delores. She is the same
plumply magnetic Jessie Bartlett with
rich chocolate-colored voice and the

creamy enunciation, and her most
sumptous singing is done in an Angelus
song, one of the best in the opera.
Cowles 1 voice sounds to me to be
greater and mellower than ever be
fore, and he has a good part in Romero,
the bandit, and several characteristic
songs, especially the on of the "Car
blne" and a mock religious piece into
which he infuses large humor.
Barnabee, "the boy wonder," was
suffering from climate last night and
did less with the Duke than he will do
in a day or two. Macdonald is the
"barytone singer," and. as always, an
admirable one. The tailor falls to
Frothingham. It is not a corpulent
part, but there are several good mo
ments which this trusty artist turns to
good account. W. E. Philp is the new
tenor â the real tenor â and Harry Brown
the broken-down remnant mock article.
Mr. Philp sings a sure, tidy note and
Mr. Brown has a voice to make any
body laugh.
The chorus, especially the men,
missed the key once or 'twice, but other
wise it sang with rare unanimity and
spirit. ASHTON STEVENS.
SOCIETY NOT THERE.
But Old Friepds Are There to
Welcome the Bostonians.
There was n smashfng of the opera
audience tradition at the Baldwin last
evening.
Tho Bostonlans had their first night and
society was not there to greet them.
There were no jewels, no laces, no
gleaming shoulders, not even the faintest
glimmer of a snowy throat; in short, "the
house," to put it munagerially, was not
"prettily dressed."
Bat it was substantial. Every chair
from the orchestra rail to the last row
in tho Kallory was occupied, and what
the audience lacked as far as social pres
tige goes it more than made up in en
thusiasm and a lloral expression of wel
come and appreciation.
Monday night, according to the laws
that be, is no longer the night of the
week. One goes on Monday to enjoy the
play or revel in the music, whichever the
case may be, but one wears one's best
frock and invites one's friends on Friday
eveningâ the theater night par excellence.
It was the music lovers that were out
la full force lust evening. They burst
{"heir gloves Rtid stamped holes into their
best calf boots to accentuate the delight
the music and the artista gave them.
They Hung chilly "good form" to the
winds, anu when they wanted more they
cried for it in the good old fashioned not
to-be denied way and got it.
Theatrical rules were broken and flow
ers passed over the footlights. The second
act was given over to the flower brigade,
and Manager Friedlander, in spick and
span full dress, directed the movements
of a force of ushers who sped down the
center aisle bearing the numerous floral
tokens. During the wait occasioned by
the fragrant divertissement a wall flower
with a mathematical turn of mind ob
served that Miss Alice Nielsen bowed
acknowledgment for twenty-five floral of
fering?.
.Tussle Bartlott Davis was also gener
ously remembered by her friends, and
Eugene Cowles courteaied his thanks for
a solitary bunch of jonquils.
From the rise to the fall of the curtain
the audience was wildly enthusiastic and
kept the singers keyed up to a similar
pitch. It was as a greeting between old.

STABBED IN THE BACK.
A Young Italian Assaulted by an
Unknown Man.
Louis Ottana, a young Italian, was
stabbed in the back by an unknown man
at the corner of Green street and La-
fayette place last evening and was so
: seriously injured that he had to be taken
!to the Harbor Receiving Hospital. A
i wound a couple of inches long and an
1 inch and a half deep was found about
â  the middle of the back near the spinal
j column.
Ottana, who drives a baker's wagon,
i had been to call on his sister, who lives
at the corner of Dupont and Green
| streets, and was returning from there
! when he was assaulted by the man.
I whom he claims he does not know and
: never saw before. The assailant grabbed
1 Ottana by the head, stabbed him and
afterward made his escape.
The police believe that the stabbing
i was over some Mafia trouble, and think
i Ottana knows who the man is. It is said
that the injured man had some trouble
about a week ago with an Abyssinian
fisherman whose identity is not known.
and he may have been the one who did
the stabbing.

Trustees.
Took a Pledge and Vio
lated the Purity of

Promised if Elected to Keep
Only Republicans in
Office.
A CASE FOR THE COURTS.
The Trustees Will Not Give Up
Their Places to the Board-Elect
Without Credentials.
There is every probability that the
new Board of State Library Trustees
will not take office without a struggle
in the courts. It is understood that
Governor Budd will refuse to certify
to the election by the last Legislature
of the five men who are to constitute â¢
the new board.
The gentlemen who were elected are
expected to take office on February Â°8
The present board will not turn over
the office unless the new members pre
sent credentials and the n-sult will be
that the courts will be asked to decide
the matter.
The Governor will base his refuse 1
on the ground that the board-elect
with the exception of one member took
a pledge not to retain any Democrat
in office, and that the pledge disqual- I
ifies them from holding public office !
under the provisions of the purity of
elections law.
During the last session of the Legis
lature and when it came to the election
of the new Board of State Library I
Trusrees, the Republican Assembly- \
men called a caucus, and at the meet- I
ing it was decided that they would re
fuse to support any candidate for the
office unless a pledge would be given â 
that none but Republicans would be |
retained in the positions the new board
had to offer.
Frank D. Ryan of Sacramento, Jacob j
H. Neff of Colfax, A. B. Lemmon of
Bantft Rosa, Thomas Flint Sr. of Monte- !
rey ami Lep of Los Angeles were the
Republican candidates.
Letters dictated by the caucus were
sent to them asking them to pledge
themselves to give offices only to Re
publicans in the State library. AH but ;
Jacob H. Neff replied giving the neces- !
sary pledge. All five, however, re- I
ceived the Republican support in the
Assembly, and they were elected.
The purity of election law provides
for such emergencies, making the
crime of bartering in public offices a
felony, and it is said thÂ« Governor, by
refusing to issue the certificates, will
bring the offenders in direct contact
with the law.
What Ryan Says.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 14.â The rumor
In circulation that Governor Budd
would refuse to certify to the election
by the last Legislature of the new
Board of Trustees to manage the State
library on the alleged ground that they
had given a pledge not to retain any
Democrats in position, is made light of
by politicians involved. F. D. Ryan,

CLOSING DOWN OF THE FOG.
Three of the Crew of the Sealing Schooner Mary Taylor While Out Hunting off
Point Reyes Lost the Vessel in a Fog and Captain Nelson Gave Them Up
for Lost After Searching in the Vicinity for Twenty-four Hours. The Men
Landed at the Mouth of Russian River, However, and Sold the Schooner's
Boat and Hunting Guns to the Fishermen and Ranchers for whatever They
Could Get.
SEALERS IN
HARD LUCK
The Weather Unfavora
ble and the Hunters
Deserting.
Three of the Crew of the Mary
Taylor Lost the Schooner
in a Fog.
Landed at the Mouth of Russian River
and Sold the Vessel's Boat
and Guns.
This year's sealing fleet Is not a very
large one, and those vessels that did
venture out are having a hard time of
it. Captain Billy O'Leary of the
schooner Geneva reports that seals are
very scarce and wild, and the weather
very unsuitable for hunting. Captain
A. Nelson of the schooner Mary Taylor
lost seven of his men and had to put
into port for repairs. He also reports
seals being very scarce. So the chances
for anything like a catch this year are
very poor.
The Mary Taylor left Victoria, B. C,
last Monday for a cruise along the
coast. A week ago one of the boats got
lost in the fog while out hunting. The
schooner cruised about in the vicinity
for twenty-four hours, when the cap
tain came to the conclusion that the
men had either reached shore in safety
or that the boat had gone down and
the men were drowned. A Lew days
ago the foremast head of the schooner
was sprung in a gale of wind, and the
captain had to put into Drakes Bay
for repairs. On his arrival there he
found thiit the men who were lost in
the fog had reached the mouth of Rus
sian River in safety. They sold the
boat to two fishermen and the hunting
guns to a rancher and then made the
best of their way to San Francisco.
Two of the men started to walk â one
of them walking alonp the edge of the
cliff and the other sticking to the
beach. The fog came down again and
they lost each other. The man who
was on the cliff has not been seen
since, but the one who stuck to the
beach reached San Francisco in safety
where he was found by Captain Nelson
yesterday.
While the work of repairing the
schooner was going on four more of
the crew deserted. The captain and the
mate chased them for quite a distance,
but they also got lost in the fog and
made their escape. Being seven men
short in his crew Captain Nelson had
to come to San Francisco in order to
fill the vacancies. He got his men to
gether last night and at once left for
Drakes Bay. He expects to continue
his hunting cruise to-day.
The Cox & Marvin sealing fleet of
Victoria, B. C, will not be put in com
mission this year. All their schooners
were hauled out of retirement and
docked at the various wharves. The
sailors and hunters had been engaged.
Indian crews for some of the boats had
been secured and the stores were on
board when the owners suddenly
changed their minds and returned the
vessels to their anchorage in \ ictoria
arm There they lie until a more favor
able opportunity for seal hunting ar
rives The precautions taken by the
United States to prevent poaching
seems to have had a good deal to do
with the non-commissioning of this
fleet of British sealers.
The river steamer Herald broke
down at a most opportune time yes
terday She had completed her morn
ine trip from Vallejo and Mare Island

The bark Northern Light will go on
the dryclock to-morrow preparatory to
being got ready as a passenger ship
for the Kotzebue Sound trade. She will
take about 127 gold hunters and will
get away early in the spring. The bark
Alaska, which is also managed by Cap
tain Cogan.has all her accommodations
taken and the machinery for the stern
wheel steamer has been put aboard. The
lumber for the vessel is expected daily
from Puget Sound, and as soon as it
gets here the steamer will be built in
sections and stowed away in the hold
of the Alaska, after which Captain Co
gan will take a rest until the vessel
sails next April. The Alaska-Northern
Light expedition will be one of the best
equipped gold hunting ventures that
will leave San Francisco this year.
The Australia and Zealandia will
both sail next Thursday. Over a hun
dred men have been at work on the
Australia getting her ready for the
Dyea-Skagua"y trade, and she will get
away Thursday at 4p. m. The Zea
landia, which will take the Australia's
place on the Honolulu run, is in readi
ness to go out and will get away on
Thursday at 2 p. m.
The Alaska Commercial Company
has evidently some fears for the safety
;of the bark Coloma. On December 29
last she left Tacoma for Unalaska with
680,000 feet of lumber valued at $9650.
This was intended to be used in the
I building of barges, but as the captain
' of the steamer Lakme reports that the
1 Coloma had not reached her destina
! tion when he left Alaska her owners
' think that something has happened to
i her. Accordingly the steam schooner
; Suiiol has been chartered to go to Port
I Blakeley at once and load lumber for
Unalaska. The Sunol has had a hard
time of it this last week. She left here
! for Usal to load lumber, but had only
got one slingful aboard when her moor
ings parted and she had to put to sea.

WATCH CAREFULLY
Nature Gives the Warning, and Every
Wise Man or Woman Must Respond
When She Calls for Help.
Watch well the first symptoms of dys
pepsia and indigestion.
In these are the seeds of future trouble
planted in the system.
Disease and danger lurk in the vital
organs, the blood becomes vitiated and
the general health is undermined when
ever the stomach and liver fail to perform
their functions as nature intended.
The evidences of disturbance in these
organs are always plain and unmistak
able.
A heaviness and lassitude eeem to seize
the brain and to depress the bodily energy
and spirit. All mental or physical effort
becomes a torture, and, if neglected,
things go on from bad to worse until the
health is completely undermined or de
stroyed.
Nor is it safe to resort to the harsh and
! griping cathartics. The best thing any
j many or woman can do at such times i.-Â»
to take a pure stimulant â not an ordinary
one, but something that has been tested
and tried and is indorsed by the leading
people of the land. Precisely suoh an
I article is Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey.
!It has stood the test of time. -. pos
'â  nesses medicinal qualities known to no
other whiskey. It will tone up the
stomach, relieve dyspepsia and cure where
I other preparations only relieve. Be sure
your druggist or grocer gives you the
genuine.

KEW YORK STOCK MARKHTT.
XETV YORK. Feb. 14.â The weakness of
f; ks was pronounced to-day and permeated
even- department of the market. The decline
â xas quite uniform in the general list, and a
few of the highly speculative specialties broke
severely. There was little reported In the
way of buying orders at any point, and prices
went off easily and rapidly.- The market stead
led at intervals an.] rallied rather feebly,
but pronounced dullness followed every symp
tom of recovery. Few of the active stocks
have escaped a net loss of a point or more
and many prominent securities are over two
points lower. The higher prices at the open
ing were caused by the confidence- with which
1 prices of Americans had been sustained on the
London hxchange during Saturday's holiday In
New York. This confidence was still in evi
dence in London before the opening here, and
the international stocks shows sharp advances
in sympathy, ' reaching nearly a point in the
case of Union Pacific. These advances were of
the most eph^ineral character, some of them
being aliiMsr wiped out on sales at the open
ing. This was particularly the case with Union
Faeific stocks, in which the reorganization
committees agreement with the Government
over the K.i::sas Pacific sale seemed to hiiie
realization.
Much talk was heard of the Cuban question
durinp th- day, but there was no specific de
velopment that offered a new motive for sell
lng. Tho bears took advantage of the over
bought condition of the market and the rather
long-sustained effort t" support prices to make
an aggressive raid. The stock dislodged by
uncovered margins induced quite a heavy li
quidation. The bears had no difficulty in cov
ering at the decline without any marked rally
In prices, ./v.
The reactionary tendency in Ftocks affected
the bond list | throughout â  for the first time
since the recent advance was checked. . . Prices
of bonds did not yield â at once, some issues
Showing: strength in the early part of the day,
but declines wore general before the close.
Dealings continued on. a very heavy scale.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 14.â The Evening PosfÃ
London financial cablegram says:
The stock markets were quiet and easier to
day, but wi^h' an absence of business. Ameri
cana opened rood, especially Louisville a id
Nashville and Union Pacific, but then gave way
on New York selling and finally closed flat on
reports of an ultimatum from the United
States to Spain. This was not generally be
lieved, and barring any such political news I
must report a very favorable .disposition in
financial quarters here towards Americans.
Many, indeed, are looking for a real boom. The
general tendency to buy Louisville and Nash
ville was led by a linn which recently secured
large profits in trust operations In Americans.
Spanish securities were steady. Gold has fallen
sharply to 77s 94d.
The feeling grows that the Chinese loan
negotiations are still on. but discretion prompts
secrecy, and to a certain extent restrains the
press.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. - Feb. 14.â At the opening and for
about half an hour thereafter wheat was In
clined to weakness. Heavy receipts were re
ported as the result .of accumulations sinct
Saturday, and early Liverpool advices showed
viQld decline In futures, though cash prices
were %@2d higher. That part of the foreign
market was, . however, . overlooked by local
traders â  for the time being. The French crop
outlook was reported as being. very. favorable. :
Initial sales of May, which closed Friday at i
57%i6 97%r, were made to-day at 97 5i@97Vic. and
for some time the market fluctuated between
those fractions. Offerings were not at all
heavy, but there was an almost total absence
of buying orders. Gradually the market toon
on strength. . Figures on the Liverpool stocks,
the strung cash situation there also drew
more attention to the advances in the cash
market. Liverpool stocks showed a decrease I
of 337.000 buehelÃ for the week, leaving but I
1,212.000 bushels, against 3,480,000 bushels a year
ag'->. ' English : country markets were quoted
from 6d to Is per quarter higher than on Fri
day. : Covering by shorts and a little general '
buying was started when later cables were re
ceived showing \a recovery in the March de
livery at Liverpool and the May price ' was
slowly forced up to 9SHc. Here a reaction oc
curred under realizing sales, May dropping to
97}ic, where it was stopped by reports of poor
threshing returns from the Argentine crop and
statements that the figures on the exportable
surplus of that country would probably be ma
terially reduced. This caused . renewed buying
and a recovery to 98c. Then for two hours the
market was exceedingly dull. Acting . on the
belief that the I.eiter party has control of the
wheat market, many of the professionals went
over into the other pits to do their trading, and
so dull was the market for a time in conse
quence that brokers reported difficulty In do-
Ing business â in . even â¢â â  moderately sized -lots. 1
Some nervousness was shown at times. â - Prices
fluctuated rapidly over a narrow â¢ range. â  ThÂ»

visible supply showed a disappointingly smal
decrease, 385.000 bushels, notwithstanding th
recent large shipments, and encouraged shor.
selling, which resulted in a decline to 97}ge. :
Late in the day the market became strong
again on rei>orts . of good export engagement;
and prices advanced to the highest point O;
the day. May advanced to ; BÂ£>>>ic and closed
strong at 98%S$9S>4c. Â»
Corn was \ cry active throughout. On ac
count of heavy receipts, 545 cars, and the open
ing wheat decline, the market was weak for i:
time. Active speculative buying followed, th<
market becoming very firm.
There was an active, Btronger and hlghei
market for oats.
Business in provisions was the largest for
some time. The market was very strong
throughout and new high levels were reached.

dealers prices still have a wide range, al

off. and prices ranging from 7S to 80 cents
(Portland basts) were reported as paid by mil

AN INJUSTICE
Will Not Be Collected in
Alameda This
Year.
Assessor Dalton Finds That
Other Counties Have
Ignored It.
Said to Work a Hardship on Men
Who Reap No Special
Benefit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 14.
There will be no road poll tax col
lected In Alameda County this year.
Supervisor Mitchell introduced a reso
lution at the meeting of the board to
day setting forth that the tax is un-
just, and It was unanimously carried
after a warning from Mr. Talcott that
the board had better not get into poli
tics too early in the campaign.
Assessor Dalton does not believe that
the road poll tax is just and equitable,
and he has been in communication
with County Assessors in other parts
of the State on the matter. Now that
the northern territory between old Oak
land and Berkeley is annexed to this
city, this district is not liable to be
taxed for road poll tax, and Mr. Dal
ton does not see why the balance of
the outside territory should be made to
pay.
As a result of the canvass of twenty
five counties, Assessor Dalton has re
ceived replies that show that twelve
of the largest of them do not collect
the tax, believing it to be oppressive
and vicious.
The counties in which the tax is not
collected are: Los Angeles, Santa
Clara, San Joaquin, Placer, Shasta.San
Diego. Stanislaus, Merced, Tulare,
Kings and Kern. In Tulare the usual
resolution was passed by the Supervis
ors up till last year, but it was aban
doned in 1897.
"The tax is eminently unjust," said
the Assessor this morning, "because it
is discriminatory. It produces more
hard feeling than all the rest of the
taxes put Together. It is such a small
amount and falls on such a few that it
Ehould not be collected. Of course, the
Assessor will lose his commission, but
I do not care for that.
"It is this way: People as a rule do
'not object to the poll tax, because the
money goes to the public schools. But
any poor fellow who happens to live
.<!e an incorporated city or town
should not be forced to pay another $2
for the use of roads which he does not
use more than .anybody else. Take the
Hay wards road, for example. It does
not seem right to garnishee the wages
of each of the boys for $4 when they get
no benefit from it that every other
citizen doe? net get. The amount pro
duced by road poll tax last year was
16000. This year without the annexed
district it will be much smaller, and it
would bebutrigrht to put it in the tax
levy as so many other counties have
done and let the tax be evenly distrib
uted."

A FAMOUS ARCTIC EXPLORER
Lieutenant Pearu, Who Will Tru to Discover the
North Pole,
Lieutenant R. E. Peary, U. S. N.. whose name has become famous in connec
tion with Arctic exploration, arrived in the city yesterday, together . with his
wife -and little daughter. They went to the Palace.
His present visit to San Francisco, and it is his first, is on a lecturing- tour,
made with the idea of seeing something of the country and profitably putting in
the time between now and July next, when he will start from New York on his
much, talked of attempt to reach the North Polo. The Lieutenant looks to be
' 35 years of age, with a thin wiry frame built of nearly six feet of bone
} muscle and surmounted by a strong, determined looking face.
Said Lieutenant Peary, When questioned concerning his next trip northward:
"I shall leave New York somewhere about the middle of next July in my vessel,
the Windwarad, an Arctic whaler built in Scotland for the special purpose of
navigating through ice. I will go directly to Whale Sound on the west coast of
Greenland, about 3000 miles from my point of departure. There I will take on
my dogs and about eight or ten young Esquimau couples, with all their belong
ings. I will then push onward through Smith Sound, Kane Basin. Kennedy and
Robeeon channels, the Ice permitting, to Therrard Osburne Fjord, where I will
Lblish a station as my base of supplies.
"Having made everything snug there. I will, with a surgeon and one other
white man of my party, two or three special selected natives and dogs, travel
northward to Cape Washington, the most northern point of Greenland yet known,
and from there as much further on as I can on land. When I have reached the
limit of terra firma I will strike right across the frozen sea and endeavor to

A QUESTION
OF CULTURE
An Artist Says There Is
No Musical Taste at
Pleasanton.
Mme. Peters Stirs Up Society
in the Interior of the
County.
She Appeals to the "Best People" of
Livermore to Patronize
True Art.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Feb. 14.
You will be conferringonmea per
sonal favor by letting me know at
once, as I do not intend to stay
here in Pleasanton since the peo
ple here are anything else but re
fined and human. It comprises
shoddy genteel and codfish aris
tocracy.
88S8S88SSS38888888888S88838SS
There is trouble at Pleasczton, â  and
it has been caused by Mrs. Lillian B.
Peters, a musician not unknown in the
cities around the oay. Mrs. Peters has
set Livermore against Pleasanton and
as these two towns are always ready
to say that each is best there is likely
to be some warm correspondence over
the matter.
The last time that Pleasanton so
ciety was shocked was when an at
tempt was made to sing "Isabel" at a
Christian Endeavor social, but failed.
Now Mrs. Peters has stirred up the
town once more, and has declared that
the people of Pier . -anton are "anything
but refined and human."
Mrs. Lillian B. Peters, if her claims
are correct, is a great artist. She says
that Henry Abbey was once her Lon
don manager, and that she has served
as court pianist at the courts of Rus
sia and Austria. ' She has also organ
ized Chopin clubs in different cities In
the country and is an enthusiast. A
few months ago Lillian B. Peters de
scended with all her attainments upon
Pleasanton. She called society together
and told it that it would be the proper
thing to have Saturday music recitals.
New York and Berlin have them 4
Pleasanton should also have them. An
attempt was made to make Pleasanton
musical, and it failedâ failed, so that
tn call the town "jay" is to compliment
it, according to Lillian B. Peters.
Now Mrs. Peters believes that there
is some hope for Livermore, musically.
She has written to a social leader in
Livermore. asking if it would be a good
thing to introduce Saturday musicales
a la Albert Hall to the "best people"
of the town that adjoins Cresta Blanca.
Mrs. Peters ends her letter with the re
mark with which the story opens.
It is said that Livermore will tolerate
at least one series of musicales, If only
to prove that it is musically and so
cially on a higher plane than Pleasan
ton.
Mrs. Peters has left Pleasanton.
Frightened Away a Burglar.
OAKLAND. Feb. 14. â Mrs. Matilda
Brown, a daughter of Frederick Delger
and mother of Everett Brown, the uni
versity football manager, was aroused
about 2 o'clock this morning by a bur
glar in her room. She made an outcry,
which caused the fellow to beat a hasty
retreat. An examination of the house
showed that the intruder had forced an
entrance through a side window and ran
sacked the lower floor before going above.
He had gathered a lot of clothing and
other things into a bundle and had taken
them to the back gate, but in his haste
did not take them away.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1898.
HIS YEARS OF SERVICE END.
A. D. WILDER, Whose Death Occurred Yesterday, After
Two Decades of Work for the Southern Pacific
Company as Division Superintendent.
Oakland Office San Frnneiaco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 14.
After thirty-eight years of active life as a railroad man A. D. Wilder died
this morning after a few days' sickness.
The career of A. D. Wilder from a junior freight clerk to the position of divi
sion superintendent of the Southern Pacific Company has been one of gradual ad
vancement, earned by hard work and diligence. Never a very strong man physi
cally, he was subjected to a very severe strain during the great strike of 1894, and
since then he has not been as strong as formerly.
About a week ago Mr. Wilder caught a cold and unfortunately he neglected it.
It developed into pneumonia, and last Thursday became critical. Drs. Woolsey,
Dunn, Ryfkogel and MaeMonagle were called in, but the disease had found a pa
tient unfitted to withstand sickness, and this morning he succumbed.
A. D. Wilder was born in 1843 in Attica. X. V.. and commenced his railroading
career on the old Erie Railroad when he was 17 years of ago.. He worked himself
up to be chief freight clerk of the road, and in IRSS he came to California. He first
went into the service of the Southern Pacific as a ticket seller in the San Fran
cisco depot, and in 1869 he went to Sacramento and rose by successive stages from
clerk to freight auditor, which position he held till 1572, when he left on account of
ill health.
In 1572 Mr. Wilder came to Oakland and was given a position as chief clerk for
E. c. Fellows, then division superintendent, and a year later he was made divi
sion superintendent of the old California Pacific, with headquarters at South Val
lejo. When John Corning died in IS7B Mr. Fellows was promoted and A. D. Wilder
was transferred to Oakland and made division superintendent, which position he
has held for nearly twenty years. When he assumed charge of his division there
were 150 miles of track under his control: now there are over 800 miles.
Mr. Wilder was twice married, first to Anna C. North, who died In 1882, and
who was the mother of two sons and two daughters. His seconu wife was May
E. Snyder. who survives him, of which union there is one child.
Mr. Wilder was for some years a trustee of the First Congregational Church
and an active member under Rev. Dr. McLean's pastorate. Many years ago he
joined the Masonic order, but no other fraternal organizations.
STAMP OBDINANCE LEGAL.
City Attorney Dow Declares It to Be
Within the Police Power.
OAKLAND. Feb. 14.â City Attorney
Dow, in response to the City Council's
request for a written opinion upon the
validity of the proposed anti-stamp ordi
nance, has made the following reply:
"It is unquestionably within the police
power of a municipality to pass an ordi
nance prohibiting the introduction of lot
tery schemes and similar devices tato
mercantile transactions (.Long vs. State,
22 Atl. Rep., page 4), and an ordi
nance passed for that purpose will be
sustained unless it manifestly appears to
contravene rights secured to the citizen
by the constitution. _
â¢â¢The discussion thus far had before
your honorable body in connection wltfi
the said proposed ordinance has referred
largely to what is known as the -trading
stamp"' â ystem, adopted by Borne mer
chants of this city, but it will bÂ« observed
that the ordinance in question IS not
directed against any particular scheme
or device, nor should it be construe! aa

property 8 without connection with the
sale of goods, but to embrace within its
prohibitions all indirect disposes of gifts
ami prizes In conn-rtlon with the sale of
goods by means of^ tickets ; coupons, etc.
"T respectfully advise thnt the enact
vtstoar of said ordinance are applicable
to such case."

MORE TALK
OF BRIBERY
Officer McKinley Said to
Have Been Asked for
Money.
City Attorney Dow Thinks the
Grand Jury Should
Intervene.
Has a S'ory That He Would Like
to Tell the County's
Inquisitors.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 14.
The Grand Jury now in session has,
it is stated, taken up the rumors of
bribery in connection with the recent
appointment of the new men on the
police force, and it considers it is ow
ing to the city that the matter be
probed to the bottom. Whether there
be bribery or not, there are all manner
of discreditable stories flying around
involving city officials, and if those
who are assiduously circulating these
stories are doing it mischievously, they
should be silenced and punished.
The proposition was made to-day by
a city official and a member of the
Board of Works that it would be a
good thing to subpena all the City Hall
officials before the Grand Jury and get
at the bottom of the whole business
i that will not down.
It is reported on excellent authority
that one man who is at present on the
police force was approached and told
that if he would put up a certain
amount of mr-ney he would be certain
of being appointed. This candidate at
once went to City Attorney Dow, who
is also a Police Commissioner, and told
him of the transaction. Mr. Dow was
asked about the matter this afternoo-n
and said: "While Ido not feel at lib
erty to give out conversations which
are confidential, I will admit that I
have heard of at least one case of at
tempted or proposed bribery. There is
no doubt that these stories are detri
mental to the city, and they shc-uld
be run down by the Grand Jury. The
man who had a conversation with me â
Officer McKinley â is now a member of
the force and 1 do not feel inclined to
tell what he told me. because if I did
so, other officers who feel at liberty to
discuss matters with me would at once
jump to- the conclusion that I might
not regard anything as confidential.
"I think the Grand Jury should sub
pena all those who have been in any
way mixed up in these rumors and
hear their stories. I would be quite
willing to tell all I know."
"I was approached," said Mr. McKin
ley at his residence to-night, "and the
amount was mentioned, which the par
ties claimed it was necessary for me to
put up to secure my position. There
were two gentlemen, and I knew I had
no opportunity to defend myself should
they ever determine to make a report
at the meeting. I told them most em
phatically that I would have nothing
to do with such an offer. Not once, but
twice or three times they came to my
house and insisted that I meet them,
even if I did not get in until midnight.
I met them once and took along a com
panion whom they refused to admit.
"I was not told by this party that
they represented any of the Commis
sioners nor did he claim to be able to
buy the position, but said, 'Put up the
money and you will be named to-mor
row. 1 That was the day before every
one believed that the appointments
would be made, but they were not. I
was given to understand that the party
talking was very close to one of the
Commissioners.
"I do not feel like saying anything
more nor mentioning any names, for I
have my position, and if I talked they
are in a position to make enemies for
me in the future. I have been advised
to attend to my duties and say noth
ing."

if passed, will carry with it a mandatory
provision directing work to be resumed,
otherwise it is feared that the same ad

the past against the improvement may

The Boy Burglar.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 14.â Edward Hill, the
18-year-old burglar, was taken before
Justice Morris to-day, where by consent
of the District Attorney the case was
postponed for six months, with the under
standing that at that time a date would
be set for the examination. No reason
was given for this remarkable procedure,
nor is there any apparent reason why
the young man should not have his case
treated in the same manner as other
burglars. The arresting officer who
caught him in the act of committing: the
burglary is puzzled to account for the
strange proceeding.
A Strange Case.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 14.â Mrs. A. D. Willis
of 2201 San Antonio avenue went to call
on a neighbor to-day, and when she re
turned she was amazed to find a strange
man sitting in her kitchen, where he was
making himself very much at home. She
asked him Who he was and what he
wanted, and he answered that he guessed
he must have made a mistake. There
upon an officer was summoned and he
was taken to the police station. He could
give no coherent account of himself, but
was vej"y quiet and docile. Soon after
his father appeared on the scene and ex
plained matters. The young man's name
is Ixmls Jellu. and his father is an Oak
land baker. He has become mentally un
sound from overstudy and is not re
sponsible for his actions. He is harm
less, however, and was allowed to de
part in company with his father.
COMPANY M VICTOrvIOTJS.
Defeats Company I in a Hard Strug-
gle on the Gridiron.
Nearly 500 people journeyed to the Pre
sidio athletic grounds yesterday to wit
ness the final game of the season between
I.e.ngue of the Cross teams.
The Lilac Ms. known as Company M
of the League, and the Stars and Stripes,
representing Company I, lined up on the
gridiron, and, after an exciting struggle,
( ompany M won.
A great deal of enthusiasm was shown
by the crowd, the brilliant runs and
cfever plays being repeatedly cheered.
Sheble and Greste of the Lilac M's were
the heroes of the day. The first-named
made two out of the four touchdowns
scored by his team, one by an eighty-yard
run and another twenty-yard "run.
Greste's seventy-yard run through a scat
tered field to a touchdown was the sen
sation of the day.
Company I put up a gallant struggle,
but to their lack of training and a
poor knowledge of signals they owe their
defeat.
Charles Johnson acted as referee and
Lionel Swift as linesman. The score was
16 to 0.
Valenzuela Released From Custody.
A criminal charge has not as yet been
i placed again Ronaldo Valenzuela, the
I man suspected of plotting the robbery
I and murder of Pedro Charaleu, an aged
Frenchman from Tucson. Considerable
I doubt seems to exist as to whether Valen
i zuela and his companions were really
i plotting the death of the old man or were
â  acting under the instructions of his wife
' in misrepresenting to Charaleu that they
; were taking him to the Klondike in or-
I der to get him out of the way until the
j present excitement blows over. Valen
zuela was released from custody pending
> an Investigation of the charatre.
A Serious Fall.
George Hunter, 525 Natnma street, went
home about 3 o'clock yesterday morning
and, as is his usual custom, sat on the rail .
of the porch till the door was opened. He
had taken too much liquor, and fell back
ward to the ground, a distance of about ,
six feet. Ho v. as taken to the Receiving
Hospital, but as he was in a quarrelsome
mood he would not allow the doctor to
attend to him. and he was put to bed.
Dr. Weil examined him yesterday morn
ing and found that his neck and right hip
bone were fractured, and he was in a bad :
way.

FLASHLIGHT
A SURPRISE
Took the Mile Handicap
From Paul Griggs in.
a Fierce Drive.
May W, the Post Favorite,
Finished Back in the
Ruck.
;Six Favorites Burned Up theTalem
Coin â Town Topics Failed to
Land, Causing Much Sorrow.
The mile handicap decided at Emery
ville was resposible for a splendid ex
hibition of speed on the part of two
thoroughbreds, and that was about all
speculators on the event got for their
money. After May W, the favorite,
and the gray horse Paul Griggs, second
choice, in the betting had turned off
the first six furlongs in 1:14 flat, Flash
light, ridden by "Doc" Tuberville,
moved along and in a hard drive with
Griggs beat him out a head in 1:40.
The winner was at one time as good
as 15 to 1 in the ring. On Saturday
last Flashlight finished fourth in a mile
run won by Paul Griggs in 1:41. That
race evidently keyed him up to concert
pitch. The defeat of Griggs could be
attributed to the indiscreet ride fur
nished by Dorsey. He killed off the
fast May W, but in so doing forgot to
hold a triile in reserve, and when chal
lenged by Flashlight was all out.
This was not the only setback the
talent received during the afternoon.
Of six post favorites turned over to the
tender care of Mr. Ferguson, a soli
tary one failed to get back to the wire
in front, and some very hot things were
unloaded on the market. The betting
was especially good for the first part
of the week.
The good Montana filly Yule was
made the favorite for the opening
pprint at six furlongs, and though she
had Conley in the saddle was lacking
in the speed line and ended up a hard
ridden third. Hurly Burly, the Oorri
gan entry backed down from threes
to 11 to 5, outfooted the faint-hearted
Woodford filly the last part, and in a
drive gained the verdict by less than a
length.
Dan Honig annexed the purse hung
up for the "babies" with his Amigo
filly Amoltopec, piloted by Conley. She
clused in the betting at odds of 5 to
1, and taking the lead from the leader
Vioris in the stretch stalled off the
challenge of the favorite Clarando at
the end and won by over two lengths,.
Buena Ventura was extensively played,
but failed to get a chalk mark.
In the third event at six furlongs,
Town Topics was hammered down
from 7 to 1 to 5 to 2 favoritism, but a
poor start ruined his chance to shine.
In the closest kind of a fit "Skeets"
Martin on Dr. Marks was given the de
cision over Abina, the pacemaker,
though to many it looked as though
the latter had won. To cap the climax
Town Topics was handed the show.
Jockey Dorsey's mechanical genius
was too much for the favorite Serena
in the mile and a sixteenth selling af
fair. What he did with the mare, or
what he was trying to do, no one could
decipher. At any rate he got her past
the wire in seventh place. In a long
hard drive through the stretch, the su
perior finishing powers of "Skeets"
Martin served him in good stead, and
he led Johnny Woods and his mount,
Dr. Bernays, past the judges a nose,
in the fast time of 1:47%. Thorpe,
astride Wawona, was a good third.
Old Roche turned the trick in the
last event on the programme, a seven
furlong run, decided under selling con
ditions. Opening up in the betting at
â¢' to 1 his odds receded to 10, when they
Were played down to 6. Dick Clawson
ruÂ«hed the old fellow to the front down
the back stretch and, ridden out at the
wire, finished over a length In advance
of M^th, third choice in the ring, rid
den by Lonnie Clayton. Montallade
took the show from Kamsin in a drive.
TRACK ITEMS.
Tho California Jockey Club yesterday do
nated the sum of JSOO toward the fund for
the relief of the family of "Dare-Devil" Fltz
patrlck.
At the conclusion of the first race Dan Tully,
the trainer of Yule, the beaten favorite, re
marked that he thought Conley pulled the
mare. He was requested to appear before the
stewards to-day and state his reasons for such
belief.
The special two-mile race between Judge
Denny and Marplot set for decision to-day was
declared off. Barney Schreiber, the owner of
Marplot, asked for a two-pound allowance from
the Denny people, and after considerable
bantering the whole thing was dropped.
The management at Emeryville endeavored
to bring Fleur de Lis, Libertine and May W
together in a mile dash. The conditions were:
Fleur de Lls to earn' 100 pounds and each of
the other two entries 85, wilfc a special money
consideration if the record for the distance was
lowered. Joe Terry, owner of the first named
mare, could not be induced to accept the
proposition.
Vioris, the entry of Tom Griffin in the two
year-old race, is a very fast trick, and if she
had not run out the last part would un
doubtedly have landed the purse.
The last time Town Topics started, on Janu
ary 18, he was beaten by Lucky Dan and Re
jected and was any old price in the betting.
Yesterday he was one of the choice things of
the meet. The colors must have become badiv
confused at the finish, for everybody within
clofp proximity to the stand thought Valen
cienne got the place by a good head, with Al
Koran and Estro both finishing ahead of the
"good thing."
Henry Ache fell with the wise ones and had
a good bet on Town Topics.
Mercutio kept the field in the mile and a six
teenth event at the post for quite a spell by
his bad antics. Nearly left when the barrier
was finally released, he ran a phenomenal race
finishing fourth.
. Lonnie Clayton on Myth was badly pocketed
down the back stretch, but for which he prob
ably would have given old Roche a much
stronger argument at the end.

Laydon on the lA/itness-Stand.
Since the judicial investigation into I
the Jobbery of the Harbor Commission
began a number of new points have
arisen, showing that there are others ',
besides the Parafflne Paint Company
â who can point the finger of suspicion j
toward the State officials who are sup
posed to look after the people's inter- |
ests on the city front. One of the latest
Irregularities that has come to light in- ;
volves the expenditure of thousands of j
dollars of the State's money in the j
building and repairing of the wharves. j
For a long time past rumors have been
current that there was something
worth looking into under the wharves;
that there was some kind of "funny
business" down where the treacherous (
ewish of the changing tides and the foul i
sewers conspire with unscrupulous offi
cials to discourage investigation.
There were plenty of reports that the
piles of the wharves and bulkheads
â¢were not up to the standard and that
the creosoting of these timbers was not
half done. If such should be found to
be the case it was good evidence that
some one was making money at the
State's expense.
An investigation of the wharves by
a reporter of The Call, accompanied by
an expert in wharf building, shows that
the stories are true and that the State
is being systematically bled.
In the first place a great number of
piles are not up to the standard or re
quired sizes. It must be remembered
that in different lengths of piles the
diameter varies. A pile of thirty feet
should have a diameter near the butt
of twelve inches; one fifty to fifty-five
feet should be sixteen inches in diame
ter; sixteen inches should be the diame
ter of one sixty-live to seventy feet,
and eighteen inches for piles between
eighty and ninety feet in length. As to
the creosoting, the wood should be im
pregnated by the chemical to at least
three-eighths of an inch and the creo-
BOte sh'.uld be soaked in so that one
cubic foot of the pile should absorb at
least ten pounds. If anyone believes
that these requirements have been
complied with by the Darby Laydon
Lumber <'ompany and the San Fran
cisco Timber Preserving Company let
him makf an examination of the piles
of the Steuart- street wharf and bulk
head, the Spear-street wharf, the Fre
mont-street wharf and the new Hatha
way wharf. The first place visited by
The Call representative and his assist
ants was the bulkhead and wharf at
Steuart street.
According to the figures of those who
once had the piling contracts of the
Harbor Commissioners, the water at
this wharf required at least piles o-f
sixty to seventy feet, and the stand
ard here should be sixteen inches. But
what was found? A forest of pipe
stems, ami not a single pile over twelve
inches at the butt, while dozens run
down as low as ll^. 11, 10^, 10, 9Â«Â£ and
some ft inches. This work is in the
line of repairs and was performed not
over a month or six weeks ago.
A part of these timbers is covered
by creosote, although the word "cov
ered" hardly expresses it. Like beauty,
the creosote is hardly skin-deep. The
scratch of a common penknife reveals
the white wood in all Its virgin purity.
And yet the State is paying from nine
to fourteen cents per lineal foot for
piles, and from twenty to thirty cents
per lineal foot for creosoting the same,
and to what purpose if not for teredos
and limnoria, the contractors and cor
ruptionists to grow fat upon? Some of
the piles encountered under this wharf
were put in by the Perfection Pile Com
pany, known along the front as the
Rood pile, after the name of the man
ager of the company. Many of these
timbers are of scant measurement, not
withstanding their covering of burlap
and tar, or asphalt. A rough estimate
shows that at least one-half of these
piles are undersize.
The Hathaway wharf, which is close
to the place last mentioned, is a piece
of brand-new work, the newness not
yet having had time to wear off. It is
bo situated that very long piles are not
required, twelve-inch being sufficient.
"While many are of the proper size, still
there are not a few which are smaller
than twelve Inches in diameter. For
some reason the Harbor Commissioners
have alternated some of the piles pre
pared by the creosote process and that
used by the Parafflne company.
Here a startling discovery was made.
As stated, the work is all new, yet
many of the creosoted piles have al
ready been attacked by the limnoria.
This destructive little pest, it will be
remembered, does not bore into the
wood, but attacks it by cutting away
or girdling the outside or surface. In
at least a dozen of the creosoted piles
these little wood-workers have got
a hold, and when they get, a hold the
timber :s doomed. In clearing away
the surface they make possible the pas
sage for the teredo into the interior of
the timber. It will be remembered that
when the change was made from the
"built-up" piles, that proved such a
success, Commissioner Colnon's expla
nation was that the creosoted article

was the only one that was teredo and
limnoria proof, yet here is a sample of
how the doped piles will not stand the
test for as much as a month.
At the Spear-street wharf, or Oregon
dock, where the big steamers lie, past
experience shows that the piles should
be at least fifty-five feet in length, the
standard of which is fourteen inches di
ameter. At the north or shore end the
State has recently been putting in some
piles and while a few of the timbers
were found to be less than twelve
inches, this figure was the average of
the new work put in. Here, too, the
FREMONT-STREET WHARF.
! Rood and creosote piles were mixed. â¢
A few minutes 1 pull at the oars
j brought the investigating party in the
j boat into a veritable grove of small â 
! saplings, by courtesy called the Fre
; mont-street wharf and bulkhead. Be
tween the bents, up one side and down |
I the other, went the boat and a pile that :
i reached the width of twelve inches
across the butt was the exception and ;
j not the rule. Those under this size
â¢ were too numerous to count, there be- !
j ing more from nine and one-half to j
! eleven inches than over that diameter.
! Here, too, the deadly little limnoria had
j got In its work through the thin dra- :
| pery of creosote. On the west side the !
: bridge that connects with the Mail dock !
; seems to be "set up on pipe-stems," as i
I the expert -of the party put it. There j
| were nearly sixty piles and none ap
i peared to be any where twelve inches
! in diameter.
At the Fremont-street wharf it was
expected that the piles would be at j
; least fourteen inches, for there the |
; depth of water requires a fifty-five-foot I
pile. The hopes were in vain, for none
was over twelve inches and nearly
three dozen of the Rood and creosote
| covered timbers were found to be be
! tween ten and eleven inches. These re
pairs have been in about three months,
i from what can be learned. The experi-
e nce at the Main-street wharf was
: about the same as at the other places,
I although the average there is twelve
inches.
In making the examination of the
i piles in the several wharves it was
found that among the many kinds of
j teredo and limnoria-proof piles there
was one kind that has stood the test
of years. It is the "built-up" pile.
! Many were examined and although
they have been in for years they are
to all appearances as good as new. The
manner in which this company was
: "unloaded" from Harbor Commission
favors is a story of itself.
Many years ago the manager of the
company asked Marsden Manson, the
; engineer of the board, to place some
: of these piles in the most exposed place
i on the water front, which he did on
â¢ the seawall, making a record of the act
in the books of the Commission. Nine
years later the manager requested H.
,C. Holmes, the present engineer, to
: pull up those piles for examination^nd
comparison with some placed in only
two years. The built-up pile was
found to be in perfect condition and
good enough to be driven down again.
The other piles were so badly honey
combed that they broke in two of their j
j own weight. That test was sufficient I
i for the (former) board, and this is how
; so many of the built-up piles are now
in use on the front.
As soon as Commissioner Colnon be
i came the ruling spirit of the present
Inboard he "turned down" the built-up
pile people and gave the job of fur
nishing thiÃ class of timber to the Dun
don-Slade-Laydon combine. His rea
son, that is, the reason he gave to the
public was that the creosote piles were
cheaper. The "cheapness" may be
â  readily understood when it is taken
into consideration that the piles fur- !
i nished during the past nineteen months i
i have already begun to disintegrate and
i many are now honey-combed to that

IN JUDGE BELCHER'S COURT
Proceedings in the Case Against
the Commission.
The proceedings yesterday in Judge
Belcher's court were not of a startling
nature. The investigation for the day
closed with P. F. Dundon still on the
STEUART-STREET BULKHEAD.
witness stand. After he had been
sworn he was asked to produce the
contract between the San Francisco
Timber Preserving Company and the
patentees of the creosoting process used
by the company, Messrs. Curtis and
Isaacs. Witness objected to doing so,
on the ground that he did not want to
expose his business secrets.
Judge Cope appealed to the court to
require witness to produce the contract.
Garret McEnerney, representing Dun
don, asked to be heard on the sub
ject, but the court sustained the ob
jection of counsel for the Parafflne
Paint Company. Witness further ex
plained that the contract contained
things that might be used against him
in a business way by competitors.
Judge Belcher ruled that the contract
should be produced, with the under
standing under which the Slade books
had been examined, that counsel for the
plaintiff should make no exposure of
business matters foreign to the subject
of the inquiry. Witness then drew from
an inner coat pocket a document which
Attorneys Cope and Sullivan examined.
As the instrument was unsigned they
Insisted on the production of the genu
ine contract, which, it was argued,
would be brought into court later.
Judge Belcher glanced through the
document and passed it back to Dun
don with the remark that he could not
see that it contained anything of mone
tary moment not covered by the testi
mony of S. E. Slade.
Dundon then brought forth a book
purporting to be his private record of
receipts and disbursements for the firm
of Darby Laydon & Co. The only entry
of seeming pertinence to the legal in
quiry was checked "H. C. C C." This
indicated a deposit made with the Har
bor Commission in the form of a certi
fied check in the case of a bid, which is
required by law.
M. W. H. Healy, who has been a
member of Healy, Tibbets & Co.,
water-front contractors, for nearly ten
years, testified that his firm drove 685
piles on sections 1, 2 and 3 of the seawall
during July and August, 1897. He saw
possibly 100 of these piles himself. The
Harbor Commissioners supplied him
with piles through Darby Laydon &
Co. Some of them were second hand.
He saw two that were rotten. He re
membered stating to the Harbor Com
mission, after his firm's contract had
been completed, that some of the piles
supplied him by Darby Laydon & Co.
were rotten. These were among the
fender piles. They were not required
to be creosoted. They were the larger,
outside wharf piles. The standard
piles, creosoted, numberi: j 425 under
the specifications, supported the wharf
superstructure. He made the state
ment quoted to the board, because
Dundon has sarcastically reflected on
his firm in the presence of the board.
Witness said he did not know of any
money having been put in an envelope
and placed where a certain member of
the board could get it. He was asked
if he had not told Darby Laydon thia
fÃct, but an objection to this question
was sustained by the court. The rot
ten part of the piles referred to had
been cut off.
Further examination of the witness
brought out the fact that he enjoined
the board, for the purpose of gaining
time in which to secure piles necessary
for the fulfillment of a contract he had
secured as the lowest bidder. He had
been buying piles from the Pacific Pine
Lumber Company for years, but just
before he bid on this contract they had
notified him he must agree to pay them
a higher price. He had declined to do
so, and arranged to secure piles else
where, though it would require more
time to get them. The suit never came
to a trial. He had prepared himself
to deliver the piles at any point the
board might indicate for treatment.
Witness admitted a combination had
been formed against him. and this was
the means he took to save himself on
his contract.
Mr H. C. Hr'mes. engineer of the
board, testified that certain provisions
in the specifications for the treatment
of piles were inserted by himself and
that Mr. Stratton had advised the
board not to compromise the Pacific
Pine Lumber suits. He corrected the
latter statement, saying that Mr. Strat
ton's advice was not given in open
meeting, but when several persons were
present including the secretary of the
board and himself. His instructions as
to the insertion of patent numbers in
the specifications covering treatment of
piles came from Mr. Stratton and
Chairman Colnon. Mr. Stratton had
advised the board that they were not
prohibited by law from using a
patented article or process when the
result to be accomplished could not be
attained by other materials or means.
It was only sinre this trial had begun
that Mr. Stratton mentioned anything
about a law passed by the last Legis
lature respecting the usp by State
boards or institutions of patented ar
ticles, and then he said he had forgot
ten about the existence of such a stat-
ute. While Mr. Stratton was a member
of the State Senate in 1897 witness had
consulted him with reference to Har
| bor Commission matters
Darby Laydon testified he did not
j know "Batterson," "Matterson" or
"Ratterson." He did not keep the books
!of the firm. Mr. Dundon kept them.
Dundon ran the books and finances.
Witness did not believe he had spoken
] more than half a dozen or a dozen
i times to Colnon. He knew nothing
I about the missing pile book. He had
j been acquainted with Mr. Stratton flf-
I teen or sixteen years. Witness at first
j denied that he knew anything about a
; compromise with the Pacific Pine Lum
ber Company, but finally admitted that
; there was an understanding in effect
I that he should get his piles from that
j company so long as their figures were
! reasonable, his firm to remain out of
; th\ importing business.
The hearing will be continued to
' morrow morning.

When They Were Called Off the

It has been the boast of the "upper
office" that no burglary of any conse
quence has taken place In the city for
some time, those reported being, as
they claimed, the work of sneak thieves
and "dope fiends." The allegation did
not seem in accordance with facts and
now they are convinced that burglars
Who know their business are operating
in the city.
For several days detectives have
been working on one of the most suc
cessful burglaries, in point of the quan
tity of the articles taken, that has
occurred in the city for a long time.
While Mrs. Hancock of 1836 Turk
street was visiting friends in the coun
try about two weeks ago, burglars
broke into the house and raised havoc.
All the trunks, containing a large
quantity of valuable silverware, were
broken open and rifled of their con
tents. Several articles were of crystal
with silver handles. The crystal had
been broken into pieces and left on the
dining-room floor, so as to get posses
sion of the handles. Not content with
carrying off all the silver articles they
could find they smashed into pieces a
lot of valuable bric-a-brac, china or
naments and china dishes. Bureau
drawers in the bedroom had been
forced open and anything of value in
the way of silver or gold was stolen.
There was a quantity of wine and
other liquors in the cellar and the bur
glars had apparently helped them
selves liberally to them. They had been
unable to carry off all the stuff they
had stolen and cached a quantity in
the yard in the rear.
Mrs. Hancock's son lives on the op
posite side of the street and he discov
ered the burglary the next morning.
He notified police headquarters, and
Detectives Silvey and Byram were de
tailed on the case. In making their in
vestigation they came across the
buried treasure in the yard, and on re
porting that fact to Captain Bohen the
happy idea occurred to him that the
burglars would return for the plunder
and by having a detective constantly
on the premises he would be able to
capture them. Silvey and Byram were
detailed for this purpose, one to take
day and the other night. They re
mained there till last Thursday, and
as it was suspected that the burglars
had given up the idea of reurning for
the stuff it was decided to call them
off.
That very night the burglars re
turned, entered the house again, drank
considerable more liquor and stole a
number of other articles. They also se
cured the buried plunder in the yard,
and now the detectives are trying to
discover who they are. From the fact
that they returned the very night the
detectives were called off. It is pre
sumed that they had been watching the
detectives and knew exactly their
movements.
When Mrs. Hancock returned from
the country a day or two later she was
able to give a complete description of
the articles stolen, and it covered sev
eral pages of foolscap. The value will
amount to several thousand dollars.
Mrs. Hancock is the widow of Samuel
Hancock, late proprietor of the Han
cock House on Mission street.

BOOKSELLERS PROFESSIONALS.
Rev. L. H. Geary Says That They
Should Be Ranked as Such.
Rev. L. H. Geary read a paper yester
day at the Presbyterian ministers' meet
ing- entitled '"The Books of the Ministry,"
and during: the time of his discourse he
declared that a bookseller in his own
way did as much good as a minister or a
teacher, and said that they ought to be
ranked as professionals.
"It will be conceded, I think," said Mr.
Geary, "that the bookseller Is an educa
tor and a blessing to every community:
that a store of well selected books is an
educational Institution of little less im
portance than a school. Nor should the
influence of the bookseller in matters re
lating to Intellectual and religious mat
ters be underestimated. The work of the
bookseller Is the same as that of the
teacher. The religious bookseller's aims
are the same as those of the minister,
whose verbal instruction must be sup
plemented by good books."
At the Methodist ministers' meeting a
paper was read by Dr. Harris on Budd
hism, and was extremely interesting, and
after which there was quite a spirited
discussion.
The (Jongregatlonalists were entertain
ed by a paper from Rev. William Rader
on "Teaching of Eschatology." The
meeting yesterday was called at 11 a. m.
and closed at 12 m.
The gentleman that was to read a pa
per before the clergy of the Christian
church was not present and instead a
discussion on "The Holy Spirit" occupied
the morning.

TWO SUITS FOR
MRS. LEGLIES
Sued for $400 and Sues for
an Immediate
Divorce.
ThÂ« Woman in Trouble Is Better
Known ns Miss Gussie
La More.
Mrs. Leglies, better known as Gussie
La More, whose personal attractions car
ried "Swiftwater Bill" of the northern
country to his fate â that is, to the mar
riage of Gracie La More, has been sued
by R, Burden, head janitor of the Mills
building, for $400 and interest at l?i per
cent per month, and a bonus of $60 given
on a promissory note signed by M. E.
Leglies and his wife, Emilie C. Leglies, on
July 11, 1895.
It is not generally known that the pur
ported Gussie La More was a married
woman; but, however, it is a well-known
fact that Gussie's charms carried Wil
liam away from the charms of his num
erous gold claims, and that after arriv
ing in this city he married the sister of
the charmer.
The story as related by the party anx
ious to recover the money loaned was
that, while he was janitor of the Mills
building, the husband of the defendant.
M. E. Leglies, who was then collector
for the building, borrowed the sum of
$400 on a promissory note, and to bind
himself had signed an acknowledgment
before Notary H. C. Droger for the
amount.
When the summons was taken to the
former residence of Gussie La More at
the Baldwin Hotel, it was ascertained
that she had left her apartments and
had presumably gone td her sister's resi
dence, 1125 Taylor street, but last even
ing a male voice denied that either of
the sisters was in evidence and further
more, that the whereabouts of Mrs. Leg
lies was not known to the sister who
had married and quarreled with "Swift
water Bill."
Mrs. Leglies left for the East last
evening and leaves a petition behind her
praying the court that she be divorced
from her husband.

AMERICAN BOATS
ON THE YUKON
Canadian Authorities Make an
Important Concession to
Commerce.
Steamboats May Ply Between the
Headwaters of the Big River
and Alaskan Ports.
The following circular, issued by the
Treasury Department, will be of inter
est to the mercantile community:
The department is advised by the Ca
nadian authorities that small American
river steamers may be carried in sections
from Dyea or the Stickeen River to the
head waters of the Yukon River, to be
assembled there, free of Canadian , cus
toms duty, and may carry cargo and
passengers from customs stations at
those head waters to Circle City and
other places . in Alaska. Such steamers
cannot engage in the coasting trade from
any place to another in Canadian terri
tory. The stations to be occupied by
Canadian -customs officers at the head
waters of the Yukon are not fully de
termined, and their establishment will, to
some extent, be contingent on the busi
ness to be done. Parties sending such
steamers across to the Yukon can. how
ever, be advised more definitely on ap-,* 1
plying to the Customs Department orr
Canada at Ottawa, and giving specifla
information as to the points of depart
ure, etc.. on the head waters of the river.
In navigating the Yukon River in Can
ada the usual Canadian customs regula
tions are to be observed. These permit
only vessels of British registry to carry
passengers and cargo from one place .ln
Panada and land the same at another -
place in Canada. If the river steamers
transported into the Yukon have.Ameri
can registers they may clear with pas
sengers and cargo from a customs sta
t'on on the Yukon in Canada for ports
in Alaska, and vice versa. In cases of
emergency, pending the receipt of reg
fstry a clearance may, however, â¢be
granted to any of these steamers with
out certificate of registry on board for
the first voyage down the Yukon .to
\laska but not for a subsequent voyage.
