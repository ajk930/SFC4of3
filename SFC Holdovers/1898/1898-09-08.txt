I am not afraid of epaulets or of the decorations that

MADRID, Sept. 7.â The Chamber has
followed the Senate in discussing the
late war behind closed doors. This
action has caused the greatest sensa
tion. Immediately after the meeting
Senor Salmeron, the Republican leader.
moved that an investigation be made
into the responsibility of Senor Sa
gasta's Government in connection with
the declaration of war, the. negotia
tions for peace and the violation of the
constitution by the suspension of the
guarantees.
The Premier, Senor Sagasta, quickly
asked that the deliberations be con
ducted behind closed doors, and the
President pronounced favorably on
the request. Thereupon the Republi
cans and Conservatives vehemently
protested, and amid an indescribable
confusion the doorkeepers cleared the
grwleries of spectators, the Deputies in
the meantime shouting uproariously.
The Senate session was also a stormy
one. Generals Weyler, Dominguez,
Azcarraga, Palejo and Rivera attend-
Ing. . â¢
General Weyler reminded the Senate
of how Count d'Almenas had greeted
the returning soldiers; ignoring the of
ficers. He declared that this was a re
flection upon the officers' efficiency. :
"The mistakes made in Cuba are not
j.'-jj be blamed upon the army," he said,
"at upon the politicians at the head
fPf the Government." The latter, he
*_ .dared, were responsible for not send
ing supplies to the army In Cuba and
MARSHAL PRIMO DE RIVERA.
General Rivera, who brought himself prominently before the public
by declaring "that rag called the American flag shall never float over the
walls of Manila," has the reputation of being as inhuman as a wild
beast. He was the captain general of the Philippines after the recall of
the notorious Polavieja.
Porto Rico, and, indeed, for completely
abandoning them.
"The Ministers of War and Marine
ought to have resigned. Had the arniv
been properly equipped," he continued,
"It would not have failed. It would
have been better for Admiral Cerveras
Bquadron to have remained at the Ca
naries, for no practical end was served
by sending the ships to Santiago."
"What measures did the Government
take to protect the squadron?" JSer.
eral Weyler asked, hotly. "The re
sponsibilities for the surrender of San
tiago rested wholly upon the Govern
ment instead of General Toral."
General Weyler strongly condemned
the secret sessions of the Cortes and
concluded his speech as follows:
"I desire to speak to all Spain, and
not merely to the Government."
Count d'Almenas, replying to General
Weyler's strictures, said:
"I addressed my gn-<t!ngs to those
tvho have been martyrs for countryâ to
the Spanish soldiers, because they de
served such greetings. I did not address
the generals, for they 'showed them
selves incapable of leading soldiers to
battle or of showing them how to fall
worthily on the field."
Marshal Primo de Rivera shouted,
"That Is not true," and General Weyler
and others joined in the protest.
Count d'Almenas, addressing General
Rivera, replied: "I am not afraid of
euch cries or of epaulets or of the deco
rations that will have to be torn off the
breasts of . several officers, The sashes
of some generals should be torn off and
put around their necks."
A great uproar ensued.
A resolution signed by all the Re
publican representatives was submit
ted to the Chamber declaring the Gov
ernment responsible, first, for lack of
the necessary energy .in prosecuting the
war: second, for accepting a shameful
peace, and, thirdly, for violating the
constitution.
The moment that the President of the
The San Francisco Call
Chamber ordered the doors closed Senor
Salmeron cried out: "I solemnly prom
ise the country that the Republicans
will publish all the deliberations of the
secret sittings, for we are determined
to violate the secrecy which the Gov
ernment imposes."
During the tumult in the Senate sev
eral Senators were called to order.
Count d'Almenas, speaking again, de
clined, .In spite of .the appeals of his
friends, to withdraw a single word he
had already uttered. He repeated that
the surrender at Santiago was "dis
honorable."
Ultimately the Republican and Car
list Deputies quitted the Chamber as
a protest against the secret .sitting.
Th^y held a meeting later, but failed to
arrive at an arrangement, and the
meeting was adjourned until to-mor
row.
The Chamber, by a vote of 102 to 45,
rosolved to discuss Senor Salmeron's
motion for an investigation Into the re
sponsibility of the Government in con
nection with the war, but in the ab
sence of the Republican and Carlist
Deputies debate was impossible and the
House adjourned.

UNUSUAL PERCENTAGE
OF OFFICERS KILLED
Evidence of the Valor of the Leaders
of Our Forces in the War
With Spain.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â The official
records of the War Department, as com
pleted, show that there were thirty-three
officers and 231 enlisted men of the army,
264 in all. killed in battle during tho war
with Spain. These casualties include all
the lives lost by the army In the battles
Jn the Philippines, as well as those In
Cuba and Porto Rico.
The percentage of officers killed 1b strik
ingly large, and is said to be unprece
dented In the battles of the world. The
contrast Is especially striking In the case
of the battle of Omdurman, where, al
though the loss of life was heavy, the list
of killed included only one officer of the
British army.

LONDON, S.ept. 7.â The correspond

the Governor, has just arrived (late
Wednesday afternoon) on board the
Camperdown. Captain Hughes-Hallett,
who spoke with him, saw no necessity
for using diplomatic language and told
him plainly in strong terms that as
Governor he would be held responsible
in the event of any further disturb

was powerless to control the mob, but
his sincerity seems very doubtful, see

GAMBLING PERMITTED
WHILE THE FAIR LASTS
When the State's Show Closes Mayor
Land of Sacramento Will Order
a Raid.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 7.â Considerable
alarm was felt by gamblers this morning
when they heard that Mayor Land had In
structed Chief of Police Dwyer to close
the various games that have been in op
eration since the opening of the fair. In
many gambling places extra guards were
stationed at the entrances to warn deal
ers of the approach of the police. Rather
than suffer the consequences of being ar
rested the proprietors of several games
packed their â¢'layouts," preparatory to
leaving the city. To-night, however the
Mayor rescinded his order and the games
are" running wide open.
When asked If he Intended to prohibit
gambling during the fair the Mayor said:
Y'lY 'I am unalterably opposed to 'brace
games,' and as there were a number in
operation since the fair opened I con
cluded to stop everything In the form of
gambling, realizing that many strangers
would be robbed by these sure-thing
games. I notified Chief Dwyer to close
them. As Mayor of this city I feel that
It is my duty to protect persons who visit
us and who financially assist In making
the fair a success. For this reason I con
cluded to call a halt and so Instructed
the Chief of Police."
Chief Dwyer. when spoken to, aald that
he had been ordered by the Mayor to
close all games, and that he intended to
carry out his instructions to the letter.
"There will not be another card turned,"
remarked the head of the Police Depart
ment. "Mayor Land's order is explicit
and I Intend to obey it."
While the Chief was engaged In pick
surgents have attacked the Ottoman
troops at Candia and are forming a
cordon around the city. Edhem Pasha,
the Governor, has urged the admirals
of the international fleet to take im
mediate steps. The fighting continues,
but Candia itself is quiet. The British
naval commander has threatened to
bombard the town if the disturbances
are not kept down.

LONDON, Sept. 7.â Sir A. Billoti, the
British Consul at Canea, who went to
when the Czar was passing, In expecta
tion that the house would be blown
to pieces, and the Czar be killed by
flying debris. The conspirator would
perish himself as a sacrifice to the
cause.
This duty fell to the lot of Alexander
Kolanoff. In his agitation Kolanoff
seems to have made an error, as the ex
plosion was mistimed. When it oc
curred a staff officer and his wife were
ing out his best men to raid the various
gambling places he received word from
the Mayor that the latter had rescinded
tho order. Subsequently they had a con

of the citizens. Land told the Chief he did
not want the games closed. It is under
stood,, however, that immediately after
the fair closes, all forms of gambling
will be suppressed. Constant bickerings

attitude of Mayor Land. Several well
known gamblers wanted to "hoer" every

THE GOVERNOR
WILL DEMAND
THE EVIDENCE
Extradition Proceedings flgainst
Mrs. BotKin Will Be Held
in. This City.
Matters of Fact as Well as of Law Will Be
Cogsideredâ Trje Police Are Eogaged
. in a New Search;.
The next important step in the prose
cution of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin will
have a national interest. It will be
the effort of the authorities of this State
and of Delaware to send the woman to
Dover, where her alleged victims died.
In this phase of the case Governor
Budd must deride. He has no- prece-
dent to guide his decision and neces
sarily must act as his own judgment
dictates. The Governor and the Chief
of Police have been in consultation over
the matter and it has been determined
to hold the proceedings looking toward
extradition in this city and not at Sac
ramento-.
The importance of the case and the
tremendous issues involved make it ad
visable to hold the inquiry where the
available witnesses may be easy of ac
cess. From the conferences already
held it is clear that the entire case and
not only its legal aspect will be re
viewed by Governor Budd. Mrs. Bot
kin will be practically on trial before
a tribunal that can neither condemn
nor acquit her. The Governor will in
sist upon knowing the character of the
evidence arrayed against her and also
that which has been gathered in her
defense. Such knowledge will be neces
sary to determine properly the issue of
extradition.
It is argued that if this were not done
a possible if not a probable injustice
would be done to the woman. Her case
has risen to the dignity of national im
portance. As the issue of extradition
is determined for or against her, so it
will be for all others who may be con
ditioned aB she is. The commission of
a murder 3000 miles away, across a con
tinent and a score of great common
wealths was one of the contingencies
not thought of and consequently not
provided for by national legislators.
Governor Budd will settle the question
so far as California is concerned, ani
his decision will act as a precedent for
the chief executives of other States.
When the application of the authori
ties of Delaware for extradition is pre
> sented to Governor Budd it wiil con
tain two assertions that must be dis
cussed and maintained. The extradi
tion papers will declare that a murder
has been committed at Dover by Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin and she is a fugitive
from justice. Both of these points must
be sustained.
It is argued that if no evidence
other than that of the extradition pa
pers were presented Governor Budd
must deliver the accused woman to
the officer from Delaware. The chief
executive under such circumstances
could not go behind the record, which
insists that a crime has been com
mitted by Mrs. Botkin and that she is
a fugitive from, Delaware.
For this reason testimony covering
both issues will be submitted to Gov
ernor Budd. The police have been
busy gathering facts and suspicions to
sustain the charge of murder. This
testimony will be given to Governor
Budd through Assistant District Attor
ney Hosmer, and the defense will be
given an opportunity to combat it
through George A. Knight, Frank Mc-
Gowan and Charles Wheeler. The sec
ond issue, that of flight from Dela
ware, will then be discussed in the first
place as a question of fact and in the
second as a problem of law. The mat
ter of fact whether or not Mrs. Botkin
actually committed the murder in
Delaware and subsequently fled from
that State will be discussed before the
question of jurisdiction is entertained.
The discussion will be extremely in
teresting, for it will be the practical
presentation of the case of facts for
and against Mrs. Botkin and a discus
sion of the great legal issues involved.
The prosecution will insist that Mrs.
Botkin be extradited on the ground
that if she is not there may be a com
plete failure of justice in her case in
this State. The District Attorney will
argue that the Supreme Court of this
State may decide that California has
no jurisdiction in the matter. In the
event of conviction such a decision by
the appellate court would set the ac
cused woman at liberty, even if she
were convicted. She could not then be
tried in Delaware, as the law of every
State and of the United States declares
that no one may be placed twice In
jeopardy of life.
The defense will combat any attempt
to show that Mrs. Botkin was "con
structively present" in Delaware when
the murders were committed. The law
of extradition, the attorneys claim, must
be read literally and if that be the case
it will be an easy matter to "prove that
the woman was in this State and not in
Delaware and consequently could not
have fled from the latter place. Upon
the same ground, it is argued, the prob
lem of extradition will rest, for it is tn-
slsted that the essential features of the
murder were committed here although
the victims of the poisoner's hate died
in Dover.
The proceedings before Governor
Budd will not comi.ence before Mon
day. The Governor would have been
able to receive the application to-day,
but Chief of Police Lees announced
that he would not be ready to present
his side of the case. Governor Budd
will be very busy for the rest of the
week, so the whole matter will be
postponed until Monday. All of the
necessary witnesses, whose testimony
may be required, will be ordered to at
tend. All of the affidavits taken in this
State and In Delaware will be sub
mitted. The dc -nse will introduce
enough testimony to combat, as it be
lieves, the position taken by the detec
tives and the public prosecutors. It is
probable that the hearing will occupy
more than one day.
The police are active in a new search
for evidence. The testimony against
Mrs. -Botkin, although strong in cer
tain circumstantial aspects, is not what
a keen prosecutor might reasonably de
sire. The detectives have striven to
trace everything of evidence to Its
source. They sought to find where,
when and by whom the box of candy
was purchased. They tried to locate
the sale of the handkerchief and the
purchase of the poison. The box, candy,
wrapper and handkerchief have been
identified. There is in the partial Iden
tification of the handwriting on the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
wrapper and of the note In the box tes
timony of grave suspicion against Mrs.
Botkin. The purchase of arsenic and
the analysis of the State chemist of
Delaware give further facts of circum
stantial importance, and carrying out
their own logical policy of detection the
police have bent every energy to trace
to Mrs. Botkin the only remaining ele
ment of evidence that might point to
ward the woman.
This element of possible evidence is
contained in the stamps that were used
upon the box of candy. One two-cent
stamp and four five-cent stamps were
used and every effort has been made to
trace them to the purchaser. The Post
office in this city has been ransacked
from top to bottom. Hundreds of em
ployes in the general office and in the
sub-stations have been questioned, but
to no purpose. Since the abolition of
stamp agencies it was reasonable to
suppose that the five-cent stamps were
bought at one of the Postoffices. Very
few druggists handle stamps of a large
denomination. There is a sub-Post
office three blocks away from where
Mrs. Botkin lived, but although the
employes have been closely questioned
they cannot say that Mrs. Botkin
bought the stamps. Hundreds of simi
lar ones are purchased every week and
it is utterly impossible for the clerks
to remember the incidents of each sale.
Mrs. Botkin did not appear yesterday
before Police Judge Joachimsen. The
charge of murder against her waa not
heard by request of the defense. The
proceeding was continued for a week.
The Examiner grew hysterical yes
terday morning in an effort to connect
a Mrs. G. Harris as a witness in the
case against Mrs. Botkin. Mrs. Harris
knows nothing of the affair and very
candidly said so. She was a clerk at
the City of Paris, and with scores of
other clerks was questioned by the au
thorities. She knew absolutely noth
ing, and the nolice naturally paid no
further attention to her.
The story of her supposed evidence
was on an equality of nonsense with
that published by the Examiner in ref
erence to Mrs. C. Jacobs, who does not
know Mrs. Botkin and has no desire
to know her. Mrs. Jacobs does not
know Dunning or any one else in the
case. She sells candy and the Exam
iner drew a conclusion natural to itself
that she must be connected with the
Dunning murders.
THE PRELIMINARY
HEARING CONTINUED
The Prosecution Not Yet Ready to
Go on With the Celebrated Case.
Still Taking Affidavits.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin, on the charge of murder,
has gone over for another week. The caso
came up at 11 o'clock yesterday morning
in Police Judge Joachimsen's court and
at the request of Attorney Madden, who
appeared for the defense, the hearing was
ordered for next Wednesday morning.
None of the attorneys for the defensa
were present, nor was Mrs. Botkin, al
though a large crowd had gathered in the
corridors with the expectation of seeing
her.
It will probably be again necessary to
continue both the habeas corpus proceed
ing, which is calendared for next Tues
day morning-, as it is not expected that
Governor Budd will have rendered his de
cision on the requisition papers by that
time.
The takinsr of affidavits goes rapidly on,
but there yet remains an immense amount
of work for Chief Lees to perform. The
one witness of note who was in consulta
tion with Chief Lees yesterday, was Mrs.
Rauof, who still persists in the same reti
cence as to her knowledge of the case
that has characterized her course from
the beginning. r-
Mrs. Botkin spent the day in chatting
with her sister and her attorneys, who,
from time to time, dropped in to discuss
the case.
Chief Lees said last night that his his
toric black valise was nearly filled and
that to-day or to-morrow would see it
chock-a-block with the testimony of hia
witnesses.
The Chief looks tenderly on that grip
as his most potent mascot. In it he car
ried the evidence that hanged Theodore
Durrant, convicted Hoff and nearly every
other notable criminal that he has suc
cessfully prosecuted. Whether or not it
has lost any of its efficacy will be dem
onstrated at the finish of the present
case.
TWO WOMEN PERISH
IN A PRESCOTT FIRE
Hemmed in by the Fames and Smoke
While Attempting to Save
Furniture.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Sept. 7.â Fire this
morning at 2:30 o'clock resulted in the
death of two persons and the serious in
jury of three others. The dead are:
Mrs. H. T. Andrews.
Celia Nyren.
The most seriously injured are: Dr. E.
W. Dutcher and James Austin; slightly
injured, Dennis A. Barker and Mr. Hunt.
The fire started in an unknown manner
in the residence of F. S. Davis. The lat
ter was alone in the house, his family
having just left for the East, and he was
engaged till late last night in packing the
furniture preparatory to moving out to
day. He was awaKened by a dog jumping
on him. The room was full of smoke, and
he had a narrow escape from suffocation.
Owing to the scarcity of water. Judge H.
T. Andrews' home adjoining caught fire,
and it was here wniie men were helping
to remove the furniture from this house
that the casualties occurreu. The occu
pants of the house were aroused in ample
time to escape with their lives, but in an
effort to save me furniture the victims
were caged in by a sudden gust of flame
and smoke, Mrs. Andrews and Celia Ny
ren being suffocated and afterward
burned to a crisp.
Dr. Dutcher jumped from the second
story to the hall below, and in addition to
being seriously burned suffered a fracture
of several bones of the foot. His condi
tion is not consftlered dangerous.
The property loss is $5000 or 16000, both
houses being complete losses, while Davis
only saved one chair and his trunk. The
insurance was about $2000.

Driving Out of Tellerites.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Sept.
7.â A pitched battle occurred in this
city at daybreak to-day between the
two warring factions of the Silver Re
publican party of this State, in which
one man was killed and three wounded.
The dead man is Charles S. Harris, an
employe at Denver of the Gulf Rail
road. The wounded were spirited
away by their friends and their iden
tity has not been definitely established.
It is said that a man named Palmer
was shot in the cheek, but not serious
ly injured. Another man had his
hand shot nearly off and another got a
ilesh wound in the arm.
The fight was waged for possession
of the opera-house, in which the Sil
ver Republican State Convention is to
meet to-morrow. An armed guard,
representing the Teller-Blood faction,
was in possession. Ex-State Chair
man Broad, who had been deposed by
National Chairman Towne, sent an
armed force to drive the guard out of
the theatâ¬r. After a scrimmage, in
which many shots were fired, the Tel
lerites fled in dismay. Harris and the
men who were wounded are supposed
to have been members of the attacking
force.

other leading Silver Republicans open

CHAIRMAN BLOOD'S
BOLD ACCUSATION.
P COLORADO SPRINGS, Sept. 7.â Chairman Blood has Issued the
COLORADO SPRINGS, Sept. 7.â Chairman Blood has Issued the
following statement:
"To the People of Colorado: As chairman of th.c State Central
Committee of the Silver Republican party I desire to make public the
exact condition of affairs resulting in the deplorable occurrence of
this morning. Yesterday evening the county convention of the Sil
ver Republican party of El Paso County was being held in the opera-
house at this place. The convention adjourned about 12 o'clock mid
' night. At that time S. N. Nye, the lessee and manager of the opera
house, turned over the door keys and the possession of the opera
* house, as per contract, to me, as chairman of the Silver Republican
State Central Committee, that we might hold therein the ensuing State
\ Convention called for to-morrow.
"Rumor had reached me that ex-Chairman Broad, I. N. Stevens
and Dewitt C. Webber had arranged for a gang of thugs to come from
. Denver, headed by Duffleld, Arnett, Tom Clark and others who have
done time in the penitentiary for lawless acts, to co-operate with the
Sheriff of this county, W. S. Boynton, and the police force of this
town in obtaining possession from me of the opera-house by force. Be
ing lawfully in possession of the opera-house I determined to retain
the same, and for" that purpose left about a dozen persons in the
house under the leadership of ex-Mayor Plumb and of County Clerk
' Leggett. .At about 1 o'clock this morning I left the opera-house in
V peaceable and quiet possession of these gentlemen and retired to a
"hotel. Shortly before 4 o'clock this morning I was aroused by those
! whom I had left in charge and Informed that the opera-house had just
been taken from them by a body of armed men; that all the entrances
to the house had been attacked simultaneously, accompanied by the
.firing of a large number of shots through the doors, the forcing of the
â  doors and the entrance of the armed men. No word was spoken or
demand made by any one previous to the commencement of the firing
.and assault.
"When the armed force entered the opera-house It was found to
be headed by the Sheriff of this county, W. S. Boynton, and Frank
'â Howbert, the Collector of Internal Revenue, accompanied by mem
â  bers of the police force of this town and a number of other armed
men, some of them dressed in police uniform, and the thugs imported
. from Denver and elsewhere. Upon gaining entrance to the houso no
process, or writ, or warrant of law of any kind was displayed or ex
planation made of this extraordinary unlawful proceeding. At the
same time, by the direction of Sheriff Boynton and Collector Howbert,
four or five of the men In charge of the house were arrested without
any warrant or process of law whatever and thrown into jail. I am
informed that several persons' have been more or less seriously
1 wounded in the attack on the opera-house. I can only regret that in
this absolutely lawless and wholly unjustifiable proceeding the peace
i officers, of this city and county should be found the first to violate
' the law and -cause blood to How in order to consummate an unholy
1 aUiance intended to defeat the sovereign right of the people of this
State to peaceably assemble In convention. . JAMES H. BLOOD.

They are all of Cripple Creek. They
are charged with the murder of Har
ris, and informations were filed in the
District Court against them.
A guard of twenty men under Boyn
ton and Gathright hold the opera-house
and the Teller people are refused ad
mission.
In a published statement Chairman
Blood intimated that I. N. Stevens, vice
chairman of the National Silver party
during the last Presidential campaign,
and others arranged with a gang of
thugs to come from Denver and assist
in capturing the theater. Mr. Stevens
brands this statement as "absolutely
false," and says he knows nothing
whatever about the opera-house affair.
At 1 oclock this morning the Wolcott-
Stevens faction applied to Judge Lunt
for a writ of mandamus, compelling
Chairman Blood, who was then in pos.
session of the opera-house, to turn over
the building to ex-Chairman Broad.
The writ was refused.
"At 4:10 this morning," said ex-Mayor
\
Plumb, "twenty-two of us were inside
the opera-house. Suddenly a fusillade
of shots was fired through both the
front and side doors. Then, in a sec
ond, the doors were burst open, and in
rushed from seventy-five to 100 men.
"There was constant firing in all
parts of the hall, we replying as best
we could. I saw one man fall, shot
through the lungs. They carried him
to the balcony and laid him down. He
died a few minutes afterward. An
other man was injured. We were
forced out of the building. Sheriff
Boynton and Chief of Police Gathright
were in the front ranks."
Sheriff Boynton allowed the men who
participated in the riot to leave the city
early this morning unmolested. After
battering in the doors about seventy
five men rushed into the building,
shooting off revolvers. The ceiling is
full of bullet holes. The attacking
party shot into the air with a hope of
frightening the guards Into submission.
The guards were scattered in groups
about the auditorium, where they could
best command the entrances, and they
returned the fire. Those who partici
pated Intimate that no less than 150
shots were fired in the opera-house
within a few minutes. The smoke was
so dense in a moment that all shots
were at random. The attacking party
finally reached the center of the house
and the guards fled to the street. The
latter had but one round of ammuni
tion. The attackers trebled them in
numbers and had revolvers and plenty
of ammunition.
Ex-Chatrman Broad this afternoon
issued a counterstatement to that of
Chairman Blood. Broad charges that
the riot was caused by incendiary*
speeches of the Teller Republicans at
last night's county convention. He says
.Sianairer Nye violated the lease made
Wm aim as chairman of the State
committee by turning the opera-house
over to Charles S. Sprague, editor of
the Evening Telegraph, and a follower
of Teller. Broad says his lease gave
him the right to put his men In the
opera-house any hour to-day for the
purpose of decorating and preparing
the hall for to-morrow's convention.
It seems to-night that all dangers of
further serious trouble between the two
factions of the Silver Republicans has
been removed. This afternoon members
of the Blood faction made application
before Judge Harris of the District
Court for a writ of mandamus com
pelling Sheriff Boynton to turn over the
opera-house to them. To-night citizens
of Colorado Springs took the matter In
hand and the result was a compromise
by which both Bides relinquish all
claims to the disputed room. By this
agreement Judge Harris issued an or
der to Sheriff Boynton to let neither
faction have possession of the place.
The Broad faction have secured the
Coburn library of Colorado College and
the Blood wing will meet at Durkee
Hall. It Is impossible to learn any
thing about the man alleged to have

Late to-night the chances of fusion
do not appear at all bright. The Pnpu
lists hold out for the head of the ticket
to which there is strong opposition
from both the Silver Republicans and
the Democrats.

Summersville Man Makes Use of His
Lariat to Punish a Neigh

ANTTOCH, Sept. 7.â A case that smacks
of early day border sensationalism was
enacted in Summorsville this week. There
has been bad blood between the Hanlons
and Watsons of that neighborhood for
years past. Last Sunday, it is said,
young Hanlon was standing in front of
the Postoffice when Watson rode up on
horseback. Hanlon was impertinent to
Watson, when, quick as a flash, Watson
undid a lariat and threw it over Han
lon's head. Tightening the rope quickly
he rode off, dragging- Hanlon behind him.
He had dragged him quite a distance
when a man attempted to interfere. Wat
son whipped out a pistol and fired two
shots at the interloper. One shot grazed
his cheek.
Constable Sweeney arrested Watson,
and he is now in the jail at Antioch
awaiting trial.

Staff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Sept. 7.â The Figaro to-day
says the Cabinet council, just held,
unanimously agreed upon a revision of
the Dreyfus case and directed the Min
ister of Justice, M. Sarrien, to take the
necessary steps to that end.
The Matin announces the discovery
of facts implicating the officers of the
general staff, adding that General Zur
linden. the new Minister for War, re
ported the matter to the Council and
urged the necessity for reforming the
Intelligence Department of the War
Office, whereupon he was directed to
elaborate a project separating the du
ties of the general staff from those of
the Intelligence Department.
The agitation for convoking the
Chamber of Deputies is growing daily.
Already notices of twelve interpella
tions as to the Dreyfus affair have
been given. Three duels are imminent
over the case.
A great sensation has been caused by
the statement by the Matin that facts
have been discovered implicating the
officers of the general staff.
Rumors are in circulation to-night
that Comte Esterhazy has disappeared
and that Lieutenant Paty dv Clam has
been arrested, but they cannot be con
firmed.

memorial tower on the crest of Brandon
Hill, erected by subscription, to com

Cabot's discovery of the continent of
America, the Marquis of Dufferin made
a speech extolling the friendship existing
between the two nations, and he then
opened the door with a golden key, which
he afterward handed to the Mayor.
Proceeding to refer to the "vast inter
ests opening in the Far East in which
the United States would be compelled
to take part," the Marquis said: "What
ever solution there may be of these prob
lems, it is pretty certain the interests of
America and Great Britain will not
clash, but rather that both nations will
desire the same ends."

CINCINNATI, Sept. 7.â The National
Encampment of the Grand Army of
the Republic has had its red letter
day. To-day came the Grand Army
parade, to be followed to-morrow by
the Cincinnati industrial parade as a
peace jubilee demonstration.
The attendance in the city to-day
reached fabulous figures, according to
the estimate of two dozen railways that
have been taxed beyond their capacity.
All along the long line of march there
were casks of ice water and lemonade
for the marchers, and in some places
they were served with more substan
tial refreshments. There were seats
for thousands along Washington Park,
on Race street and around the postof
fice and other places, while the house
tops, as well as the windows and every
place for reviewing the parade along
the line of march, was occupied.
The line of march was less than three
miles, with the reviewing stand at
Washington Park, near the end of the
course. With the parade starting
promptly at 10 a, m., the reviewing
stand was reached shortly before noon.
Here Commander-in-Chief Gobin was
surrounded by Vice Commanders Al
fred Lyth and F. B. Allen, Chapiain F.
C. Brunde, Quartermaster General
Charles Burrows, Judge Advocate Gen
eral Eli Torrence, Surgeon General
David Mackay and others of his staff,
Mayor Tafel and other officers of Cin

Kinney, Albert Brewer, S. A. Atherton,
George W. Healy and others.
While there were marked demonstra
tions all along the line of march, yet
the stages of the greatest enthusiasm
were witnessed as the different divi
sions passed the reviewing stand and
were saluted by the distinguished gen
tlemen on the platform.
The first thing to mar the proceedings
of the morning was a serious accident
to General Curtis, one of the Police
Commissioners of Buffalo. He was rid
ing with the Police Commissioners of
this city and other cities, who were on
the Ptaff of the chief in charge of the
police that headed the procession. His
horse flipped and fell, and In the fall
the animal crushed General Curtis in
such a way as to injure his spine. It
was at first thought that he would not
recover, but later in the dayrtiis condi
tion was improved. It is believed, how
ever, that General Curtis is crippled for
life.
Previous to the parade there were
many reunions to-day, and some busi
ness sessions, including those of the
ladies of the G. A. R. and the Woman's
Relief Corps.
The National Army Nurses' Associa

EAGER FOR A SIGHT
OF THEIR QUEEN
Fifty Thousand Working People
Gather to Catch a Glimpse of
Wilhelmina.
AMSTERDAM, Sept. 7.â About 50.000
working people, with bared heads, gath
ered on the Damplatz this morning under
a scorching sun, waiting to catch a
glimpse of the young Queen of Holland.
The sovereign, however, sent an aide de
camp to the place with the request that
i the spectators resume their hats. This
thoughtfulness on the part of the Queen
was greatly appreciated by the im
mense crowd and evoked tremendous
cheering from the waiting multitude.
The Queen subsequently listened to
the singing of a grand chorus of 2000
scholars. She appeared nervous and un
strung, and had requested that her sub
jects refrain from cheering. The people
respected the young Queen's wish to the
letter, and when the singing by the schol
ars had ended absolute silence prevailed,
which was more impressive than the
mighty cht-ers which had previously been
given.
In spite of the orders that no members
of the royal families or of the nobility
of any other country than Holland be
admitted to the coronation ceremonies.

TACOMA, Sept. 7. â Three ship
wrecked sailors were rescued from Eas
ter Island in Polynesia by the schooner
Annie Larsen, which arrived from the
Fiji Islands a few days ago. They were
George O'Donnell, Ed Walsh and James
Whalen, seamen on the bark Wanderer,
which was wrecked near Easter Island
last summer.
The Wanderer sprang a leak going
from Australia to Panama. By vigorous
use of the pumps she was kept afloat
until Easter Island was sighted. While
trying to make shore she ran upon a
reef and was wrecked.
The three sailors swam ashore and
were warmly received by the cannibal
King of Easter Island and the natives.
O'Donnell told Captain White of the
Larsen that the King took the greatest
fancy to him (O'Donnell), apparently,
because he landed nearly naked and
thus most nearly resembled the natives.
O'Donnell was entertained in the
King's own house and all three were
notified that they would be considered
Princes. They were offered wives if
they would stay.
A few days after the shipwreck a
box containing several cans of paint
floated ashore. This enabled O'Don
nell to paint the King's house red,
white and yellow, which, he says,
caused the King to provide an extra
banquet.
Whalen and Walsh made themselves
popular by constructing coffins for sev
eral subjects who died and burying
them as white men do.
When the schooner Larsen hove In
sight they hoisted signals and were
taken aboard the next day. Captain
White left them at Port Townsend.

ALL VOLUNTEERS CANNOT
NOW BE MUSTERED OUT
The President Notifies Governors That 100,000
Men Will Be Needed in Newly
Acquired Territory.
WASHINGTON, Sept 7.â The following was given out at the
War Department to-day:
"In response to tne request of the Governors of some of the
States for the muster out of their entire volunteer force the Presi
dent replied in substance as follows: 'Answering your telegraphic
request for the muster out of your regiments I have already direct
ed that 100,000 of the volunteers shall be mustered out of the service.
This because in my judgment that number can be spared. About
one hundred thousand will remain as the Government now requires
in Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines a larger army than the reg
ular military establishment affords. The muster out. like the muster
in, will be as nearly as possible according to the population of the
several States. The suggestion to muster out all of the volunteers
from your State cannot therefore be entertaine.l. The Secretary of
War has already inquired of the Governors of the several States
what regiments in their judgment can with the least inconvenience
remain in the service. Their advices will, so far as lam concerned,
consistent with the public interest, be complied with.' "
NAVY'S STRENGTH ALSO KEPT UP.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Until the treaty of peace is signed the Navy Department proposes
to keep up to its present strength the enlisted force of the navy.
There are now 22,000 men in the service. As soon as peace is
signed the number will be reduced to 12,500, the maximum allowed
by law. Secretary Long will probably includn in his fortchoming
annual report a strong paragraph urging favorable action by Con
gress on the naval personnel bill.

SALT LAKE, Sept. 7.â No one here
connected -with the Salt Lake and Los
Angeles Railway will admit that the road
is in combination with the San Joaquin
Valley line with the object of ultimately
building a line from Los Angeles to Salt
Lake City. Affairs of the Salt Lake and
Los Angeles are at a standstill- Active
work ts being pushed, however, on the
Utah and Pacific, which will be built from
Milford, Utahâ the present southern ter
minus of the Oregon Short Lineâ to the
State line of Nevada, tapping a rich min
eral district en route, including well
known and old-time Pioche. Beyond that
line, which has at its back A. W. Mc-
Cune, the Utah millionaire, and the suc
cess of which is assured, tnere will be no
railway building in Utah this year.
It is well understood here that the Salt
Lake and Los Angeles, which merely
connects this city with Saltair, on Salt
Lake, twelve miles in all, is in no condi
tion to extend its line now.
Secretary Wells of the Utah and Pacific
said this evening that this road had no
connection with the San joaquin Valley
or any other road, but that he was conn
dent that Mr. McCune intended to push
the road through to the coast just as
early as possible, but the route from
State line has not vet been decided on.
It is known, however, that surveyors
have been over the ground so often gone
over before, and If any road connects this
city with Los Angeles it will be the Utah
and Pacific.
APIA THE BENNINGTON'S
PROBABLE DESTINATION
Administration Deems It Wise to
Have a Naval Representation
in Samoan Waters.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
While it cannot be learned at the Navy
Department that any orders have been
given to the gunboat Bennlngton di
recting her to proceed to Samoa, there
is reason to believe that Apia is her
destination.
The death of Malletoa, with the re
sulting danger of a disturbance of
affairs in the Samoan Islands, has Im
pressed upon the administration offi
cials the necessity of having a naval
representative In Samoan waters. Great
Britain and Germany each is repre
sented by men-of-war, and the au
thorities believe, in view of the inten
tion of the President to establish a
coaling station at Pago-Pago, and the
fact that this Government is a party to
the Berlin treaty of 1890, that this coun
try also should have a gunboat in those
waters to protect American interests.
The President is determined that the
successor to Malietoa shall be elected
according to Samoan customs, as is pro
vided for in the Berlin treaty, and has
so notified the Berlin Government.
Great Britain and the United States are
pursuing an identical course regarding
the Samoan Islands, and it is under
stood that Great Britain is averse to a
distribution of the islands, as is desired
by Germany and the United States.

is a germ disease, the bacilli will not in-
vade sound and healthy lungs. The lungs
must first be in a diseased condition.
First a man feels a little out of sorts.
Probably he is overworked and has given
too little time to eating, sleeping and rest-
ing. His appetite falls off. His digestion
rets out of order and his blood does not
receive the proper amount of life-giving
nutriment. The liver becomes torpid and
the blood is filled with impurities. These
are pumped into every organ of the body,
building up unhealthy, half-dead tissues.
The most harm is done at the weakest spot,
and most frequently that spot is in the
lungs. A slight cold leads to inflamma-
tion, the bacilli invade the lungs and we
have a case of consumption.
Ninety -eight per cent, of all cases of
consumption are cured by Dr. Pierce'a
Golden Medical Discovery. It is the great
blood-maker and flesh-builder. It restores
the lost appetite, makes the digestion per-
fect, invigorates the liver, purifies the
blood, builds new and healthy flesh and
drives out all impurities and disease germs.
It cures weak lungs, spitting of blood, obsti-
nate coughs and kindred ailments. No hon- "
est druggist will recommend a substitute.
â¢ Mrs. Ursula Dunham, of Sistersville, Tyler Co.,
W. Va., writes: " I had a pain in my side all the
time, had but little appetite and grew very thin.
The â  ' Golden Medical Discovery ' promptly
cured the pain, restored my appetite and in-
creased my weight."

OF THE FUTURE
Irving M. Scott Speaks
of Improvements.
NO CONTRACTS IN EUROPE
BUT THE BUILDER OBSERVED
WORK IN THE YARDS.
Many New Appliances and Tremen
dous Activity in Countries
Which Build TheiX
Own Vessels,
Special Dlppatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â "The war yes-
Bels of the future will be the battle
g. ships, with heavier battery, greater
speed and greater radius of action than
yet attained." This is the opinion of
Irving M. Scott, hcaÂ«l of the Union Iron
"Works of San Francisco, which built
the Pacific wonder, the battleship Ore
gon. Mr. Scott returned on the Kaiser
Wilhelm der Orosse from a three
months' business tour In Europe, dur-
ing which he visited the great ship
yards of Great Britain, France, Ger
many and Russia. Mr. Scott intimated
.when he sailed last June that he hoped
'to obtain contracts from European
powers for new warships. He was not
successful.
"Europe will continue to build her
-own war vessels," he said, "with the
exception of the battleship and cruiser
ordered by Russia from the Cramps
, Jast May. Ido not expect to see Amer
lcan-bullt vessels flying foreign Hags.
In European ship yards I found tre-
Inendous activity and noted the con
stant Introduction of new appliances.
Each country naturally desires to
build its own warships.
"The Oregon's splendid performance
created a great sensation in Europe,
l>ut it marks only a step in advance of
the .old conditions. The next series
of vessels will evr^hadow her in every
particular. Personally, I was not sur
prised at the record-breaking trip from
Ban Francisco to the West Indies. She
was built as fine as human skill and
material would permit. It is solely a
question of coal capacity. Europe will
profit by the lessons the Oregon taught,
but will use the facilities of her own
â¢workshops and yards. Each nation
ins to be putting forth its greatest
A. fforts to enlarge its sea power. Ger
â  many's naval plans show that in 1905
she will have nineteen battleships and
forty-three cruisers. This is an indi
cation t^nly of the general activity."
"What feeling was caused by the
sweeping character of the American
naval victories?"
"Largely disgust at the poor efforts
of the Spaniards," said Mr. Scott. "Eu
ropean naval officers were astonished
fjt the slight damage sustained by our
* lips. There is a marked increase in
â¢spect for American gunnery."
. Mr. Scott had many opportunities for
learning the views of European diplo
mats on the P-ilippine question.
"Beyond a doubt," he said, "the pow
ers would be more embarrassed if the]
Vnitfd States would let go of the is
lands now than if they held them. Dip
lomats are relieved because we hold
Manila. Unless the United States keeps
the islands under direct control they
believe the interests of all countries
would suffer severely and serious com
plications probably would arise."
CONTRACTS FOR SMALL CRAFT
Union Iron Works Will Probably
Build Three of the Torpedo-
Boat Destroyers.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Contracts for the construction of six
teen torpedo-boat destroyers and
twelve torpedo-boats will be placed by
the Navy Department within another
week. The board on construction of the
Navy Department held a protracted
meeting this afternoon and discussed
the various bids which had been re
ceived. As a result it looks as though
It will recommend that the contracts
for sixteen destroyers be distributed In
about this fashion: Fall River Com
pany, three destroyers, at $280,000 each;
Maryland Steel Company, five destroy
ers, $282,000 each; Neafies & Levy, Phil
adelphia, three destroyers, $283,000 each;
T'nion Iron Works, three destroyers,
$285,000 each; Harlan & Hollings
worth, two destroyers, $291,000 each.
The board has a further examination
to make before finally recommending
that the contracts be given to the
firms named. I was told after the meet-
Ing of the board to-day that the firms
â which stand the best chance of secur
ing torpedo-boat contracts are the Bath
Iron Works, Lewis Nixon, George Law
ler of Boston, Gas Engine and Power
Company of New York and the Colum
fcian Iron Works.
VICTIM OF YON ARNOLD.
X3ity Trustee Robert Kent of Sacra
mento Becomes Insane.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 7.â Robert Kent,
one of the Board of City Trustees, was
taken to a private asylum in Stockton to-
day. pending an examination as to his
Banlty. A snort time ago Kent exhibited
pymptoms of mental decay and his rela-
derided to have him confined in p
asylum, rather than suffer having
Vilm committed to a State Institution.
Kent evidently was aware of their inten
tions, as he hurriedly packed his grip and
went to San Francisco. Coroner George
Clark, who Is an intimate friend of the
unfortunate man, was deputized to make
arrangements for his confinement in a
private asylum. After a search of several
days Clark found Kent, and Induced him
to acompany him -to Stor kton. He was
then taken to the asylum, where he will
be kept until he regains his mental equi
librium.
K<nt is well known here, and his sad
affliction is a severe blow to his friends
and relatives. There are many who be
lieve that his present condition Is due to
a uetermined attempt about two years ago
of an alleged detective named Yon Arnold
to besmirch his character. Yon Arnold is
now serving a term in England for
swindling a widow, who became infatu
ated with him.

TRIO OF CONVENTIONS
MEET AT ELLENSBURG
Fusion of Silverites Likely to Be Ac
complished Easily in Wash

ELT.EXSBURG, Sept. ".âThe Populist.
Democratic and Silver Republican con
ventions met here to-day to form a fu
i ston and nominate a joint ticket, con
sisting of two Congressmen and two Su
â¢ preme Judges. The results of to-day's
â¢session were the forming of a permanent
organization by each convention and the
j appointment of conference committees to
' perfect fusion.
The undercurents of the conventions ln
'â  dlcate that fusion will be easily accom
\ pli.shed. It is pretty generally conceded
! that the Populists will secure both Su
; preme Judges, and that Congressman
Lewis and Congresman Jones will be re- ;
, nominated.
The Populist convention has among its
I delegates one woman, Mrs.- Peter of '
Clallam County, who was seated on her i
husband's proxy.
The only conclusion reached by the
Joint conference committee was that the
ticket be known as the People's party and
that Democrats and Silver Republicans
each have a Congressman.

VERMONT'S ELECTION.
Democrats Show Some Gains in the
Off Year.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, Vt., Sept.
7.â The result of yesterday's election in
Vermont shows many surprises, the Re
publican vote having fallen off quite ma
terially from four years ago, whereas the
party managers expected It would equal
If not exceed the vote of 1894. The Demo
crats have not only made a gain for
Governor, but have elected thirty-three
Representatives in 179 towns heard from,
while only eleven wero seated the last off
year.
Although the question of high license
has been the principal lssle, the Prohibi
tion vote shows a falling off of over 40
per cent. One Prohibitionist has been
elected to the House of Representatives.
Returns from 172 cities and towns give
the following vote for Governor: Smith
(R.), 30,038; Moloney (D.), 12,386; Wyman
(Pro.), 712. The same towns In 1894 gave
! Woodbury (R.>, 33,293; Smith (D.), 11,615;
others 1035.
Congressmen Grout and Powers are re
elected by substantial majorities. The
Republicans have elected their candidates
for Senators in every county.

SHE CONTESTED TOO LATE.
Ati Important Decision Rendered in
the Matter of Captain
Wilson's Estate.
Judge Troutt rendered an important de
cision yesterday in the matter of the pro
bating of the will of the late Captain
John C. Wilson, who died on February
24, 1897, leaving an estate of considerable
value. The following month, his will, dis
tributing the estate to his wife, Mrs.
Agnes Wilson, and his son, John C. Wil
son Jr., was admitted to probate. Twelve
days later a woman claiming to be tho
widow of the decedent appeared on tho
scene and laid claims to the estate. She
was known as Mrs. Clara Brady or Gor
don, a resident of Oakland. She claimed
that she had three children, two of whom
were living, by Wilson; that he had pub
licly recognized her as his wife and had
in addition promised to leave her a share
of his fortune. A proposition was made
to young Wilson and his mother to com
promise the case, but they rejected the
offer. They refused to recognize the al
leged widow and announced their deter
mination to fight the case to the bitter
end. It was suggested that a scandal
would follow, but that did not alter their
determination. They paid that they would
not under any circumstances listen to any
terms of compromise. The matter then
dropped and the alleged widow waa not
heard from until March of the present
year. She then petitioned that the order
admitting the will be revoked and that
she be given an opportunity to present her
case in court. Young Wilson and his
mother immediately Interposed a de
murrer to the proceedings and Judge
Troutt decided yesterday in their favor.
The records of the court showed that tho
motion to set aside the probating of the
will had not been filed within the statu
tory time â one yearâ and that the contest
must necessarily fall to the ground. In
deciding the case Judge Troutt said that
the alleged widow could not plead Igno
rance of the facts for failure to commence
proceedings within the statutory time, as
her efforts to have the matter compro
mised proved that she was cognizant of
the legal steps being taken by young
Wilson and his mother to have the estate
distributed to them.
A Perjurer Caught.
United States Commissioner Heacock
announced yesterday that he would rec
ommend the deportation of Geen Mon Let,
a Chinese boy, who claims admission on
the ground that he Is a native-born Amer
ican. He introduced a Chinese witness,
claiming to be his cousin, whoso evidence
was so inconsistent that the cousin was
ordered into arrest by the court and de
livered to the United States Marshal. He
will be tried for willfully and knowingly
aiding and abetting the landing of a Chi
nese not entitled to land.
A Junk Capsized.
A Chinese Junk was capsized off Hunt
ers Point yesterday afternoon while the
crew of four men were taking In their
shrimp nets. A number of Italians were
casting their nets in the vicinity, and
went to the rescue just in time to save
the lives of the endangered Mongols. The
Junk was towed to the shrimp drying
grounds near the point, but not before
half a ton of small fish and shrimp had
been lost. This is the only instance of
the capsizing of a Chinese junk in the
memory of the Italians.

6peclal Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Sept. 7.â During the
Grand Army of the Republic campfire
at Music Hall to-night Governor Pin
gree was hissed and hooted off the
stage because of his criticism of the
conduct of the war. He cited several
cases of abuse and suffering due to the
delay of red tape and became very ve
hement in denunciation of formalities
at the sacrifice of comfort, health and
human life. After citing a particular
case of bad management in the distri
bution of disinfectants Governor Pin
gree said:
"If Secretary Algerâ "
But Governor Pingree never finished
that sentence. A voice in the audience
cried:
"Hurrah for Alger."
The cry was taken up in a boisterous
chorus. The Governor attempted re
peatedly to be heard, but the audience
refused to listen to another word. The
three words, "If Secretary Alger," had
left a wrong impression. The audience
interpreted these three words to be the
beginning of a strain of censure and
criticism and absolutely refused to let
the speaker proceed.
Chairman Melish made repeated at
tempts to quell the disturbance, but
those who started the racket persisted
in keeping it up. The Governor then
retired. Governor Pingree was reading
his speech from manuscript and had
proceeded but a short way with the
document when he was cut off by the
noisy and uncontrollable interruption.
After the Governor had left and quiet
had been restored, Chairman Melish
finished the sentence which the audi
ence had refused to permit the Govern
or to read. It was:
Queen of the Tennis Courts.
CHICAGO, Sept. 7.â The women's ten
nis tournament terminated to-day with
the game for the Western championship
between Mlfs Louise Pond, the champion,
and Miss Juliette Atkinson, the winner
of the tournament proper. Miss Atkinson
won the contest, Gâl,G â I, 6â3,6 â 3, 7â5.7 â 5. She is
now champion of the West.
"If Secretary Alger had been given
full such power such things would
never have happened."
The transformation of the audience
was then humiliatingly complete to all
who were present. Then hisses of de
rision were turned into cheers and re-Â«
peatcd calls for Governor Pingree, but
he had left the hall and refused to re
turn.
Chairman Melish, in a very appropri
ate speech expressed his regrets for
the misunderstanding and proceeded
with the programme.
After this treatment of Governor
Pingree the succeding speeches had v
most attentive audience.
Governor Bushnell of Ohio was tht
next speaker, and he stepped forward
waving a little flag and eulogizing
President McKlnley and his Cabinet
and the successful management of the
war in the highest terms. His remarks
brought forth frequent applause.
Commander in Chief Gobin made a
very eloquent address on the purposes
of the Grand Army, and as he was
about to leave the platform was pre
sented with an elegant gold watch and
chain by his comrades of the old Forty-
Fifth Pennsylvania Regiment of Vol
unteers. The other addresses were by
General H. S. Hurst of Chillicothe and
Hon. Frank C. Bruner, chaplain in
chief of the Grand Army of the Re
public.
PASSING OF THE POPULISTS.
Arkansas Election Shows the Party
Almost Extinct in That State.
LITTLE ROCK. Sept. 7.â Unofficial re
turns show that the Populist party has
become almost extinct In Arkansas. It
appears that they have lost Nevada,
White, Cleveland and Polk counties, here
toiore considered their strongholds, and
have elected but one member of the Leg
islature, that member being elected in
Cleburn County. About 100,000 votes were
cast in the State, of which the Republicans
polled about 35.000 and the Populist and
Prohibitionists perhaps 15.000.
Governor Jones ran far behind the
Democratic ticket.

AN INDIRECT
STATEMENT IS
MADE BY MILES
Peculiar Marker Adopted by the
Commanding General to
Express hjis Views. .
In ttye Form of a Letter tie MentioQs H in ) se 'f in
trje Third Person and Justifies f\\s
Recent Acts.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: While no action is expected to be taken upon
the statements already attributed to General Miles, yet there is
strong reason for saying the relief of the commanding general of
the army is among the probabilities of the near future. The officials
of the War Department rooall that General Winfield Scott was re
lieved as commanding general and assigned to duty as superintend
ent of West Point. There is no doubt of the authority of the President
to relieve a commanding general Avhienever he sees fit. It is also
within his power to order a court-martial for the trial of General
Miles, but this he has no thought of doing. The most extreme meas
ure he would be likely to take would be to relieve him of his command,
but whether or not this be done v. ill depend on the future conduct of
General Miles.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â The United
Btatps transport Obdam, having on
board Major General Nelson A. Miles
and his Btaff, arrived here to-day. Mrs.
Allies, son and daughter were also on
board the transport, which sailed from
Ponce on September 1. The surgeon in
charge reported all well and no sick
ness or deaths during the voyage.
The following statement, emanating
from General Miles, was given to the
reporters on board of the Obdam. It
is in the form of a letter In which
General Miles is mentioned in the third
person:
While at Porto Rico and during the
voyage returning on the OUdani, on which
eteamer were General Miles and staff and
i*ii battalions of the Second Kegiment of
Wisconsin Volunteers. I learned the fol
lowing fact 6 concerning the Cuban and
Porto Rican expeditions. In the first
place, let me say that the war has closed,
after being conducted largely as General
Miles stated publicly at the beginning of
the war that it would be. The statement
was publicly made and a generu.l order
was issued by him as commander of the
American army, in which the plan he has
striven to pursue was foreshadowed,
namely, seeking to accomplish results
with the least possible loss of life. In an
interview in the latter part of May he
eaid: "The United States Government is
too strong, too great and too powerful to
commit any foolish act in connection with
the proposed Invasion of Cuba."
Referring to the proposed rush to the
feyer-strieken city of Havana he said:
"No officer is fit to command troops who,
from any motive whatever, would need
lessly risk the life of a single solciier
either from disease or the millets of the
enemy. I have never sacrificed the lives
of men under my command and do not
propose to subject them to any unneces
sary risks in the present campaign."
In the order issued to the army at an
early day he directed thp.t "every officer
of whatever grade will so far as may be
In his power guard and preserve the
health and welfare of those under his
charge. He must labor diligently and
zealously to perfect himself and hts sub
ordinates in military drill, instruction and
discipline, and above ail he must con
stantly endeavor by precept and example
to maintain the highest character, to fos
ter and stimulate that true soldierly
spirit and patriotic devotion to duty
which must characterize an effective
army."
The principles thus enunciated have
been zealously observed from the first.
Owing to the fact that the season for
campaigning in Cuba had been exhausted
in debates and delay in Congress and in
necessary preparations, General Miles
â¢was opposed to rushing an ill prepared,
undisciplined* and unequipped army in a
movement against the capital of Cuba,
defended by 100,000 trained Spanish troops,
and In this position he stood practically
alone.
When finally called upon to submit a
plan of campaign, he din so and put It in
writing. In substance he took the stand
first, that every effort should be made to
equip the Cubans and thereby enable
them to haras? the Spanish forces. The
cry of "on to Havana" should be encour
aged, but when the transports, loaded
â¢with troops, were out of filght of land
th'-y should pail as straipnt as steam
power could bear them to the gate of the
Antilles and the key of the whole posi
tionâPorto Rico. Then, having seized
and occupied that Island, a movement to
Cuba was to follow by means of a
strong cavalry force, which was to be or
ganized anu equipped by August or Sep
tember. He contemplated that 20,000 cav
alrymen thrown to the center of Cuba,
cutting the Spanish forces in two ana
moving west to Havana, by the time tho
rainy Beason was over and it would be
possible to maneuver an army we could
move against that city a well organized,
well equipped and well disciplined army'
and complete the capture of the Spanish
forces.
The lnclosure of Cervera's fleet in the
harbor of Santiago changed the condi
tions and made It necessary to move a
military force to that point. General
Miles, while at Tampa organizing the ex
pedition, felt the Importance of the enter
prise so greatly that he requested permls-
Bion to accompany that expedition or to
join another to join it. This permission
was not granted, bo far as accompanying
that expedition was concerned, but au
thority was granted to equip a second
"for movement and operation against the
rncmy in Cuba and Porto Rico." How
ever, oefore this expedition was equipped,
calls were- made for additional fort>-n to
go to Santiago and they were immediate
ly forwarded.
The statement then leads up to MileÃ'
trip to Cuba and the "circumstances of
the surrender of Santiago. After Miles'
conference with Toral the commanding
general of the American army received
from Washington the following dis
patch:
"WASHINGTON,, v. C, July 13.â Major
General Mites: "iou may accept surren
der by granting parole to officers and
men, the officers retaining their side
arms; the officers and men after parole
to be permitted to return to Spain, the
United States assisting. If not accepted,
then assault, unless in your judgment an
assault would fall. Consult with Samp
son and pursue such" course as to the
assault aa you jointly agree upon. Mat
ter should be settled promptly.
R. A. ALGER, Secretary of War.
This, the statement says, does not
look as if General Miles was there as
a visitor. He was charged with the re
sponsibility of ordering an assault upon
the intrenchments and fortifications of
an army which If successful would have
cost at least 5000 lives, or of withhold
ing the assault if in his judgment such
assault would fail. No greater diÃcre
tion was ever given to any general
commanding an army, and what is
more, as will be observed, he was au
thorized to accept the surrender, which
in the interest of his subordinates he
gerterously declined to do and went
away, leaving all the honor to hiÃ next
in rank, General Sh after. On the morn
ing succeeding the first interview a let
ter was received from General Toral,
of which the following is a literal trans
lation:
SANTIAGO t>E CUBA, July 14, 1898.
General in Chief of the American
forces â Honored Sir: His Excellency
the general in chief of the army
of the island of Cuba telegraphed
from Havana yesterday at 7 p. m.
the following : Believing the busi
ness of such importance as the capitula
tion of that place to bo known and
decided upon by the Government of his
Majesty, I give you notice that I have
sent the conditions of your telegram ask
ing an immediate answer and enabling
you also to show this to the general of
the American army to see if he will agree
to await the answer of the Government,
which cannot be as soon as the time upon
which he has decided, as communica
tion by way of Bermuda is more slow
than by Key West. In the meanwhile
your honor and the general of the army
may agree upon capitulation upon the
basis of repatriation, returning to Spain."
I have the honor to transmit this to you
that In case you may consider the fore
going satisfactory, that he may desig
nate persons in representation of himself
who, with those in my name, may agree
to clauses of the capitulation upon tho
basis of returning to Spain, accepted al
ready in the beginning by the general
in-chief of this army. Awaiting a reply,
I am very respectfully your servant,
JOSE TORAL.
Next the statement tells of Miles'
landing at an unexpected point on
Porto Rico and concludes:
General Miles remained in Porto Rico
as long as he deemed his presence neces
sary for carrying out the wishes of the
I resident, and now returns to the United
States, bringing with him nearly 5000 men
who are no longer required, there being
some 12,000. remaining, an army sufficient
for all purposes. He returns at once to
Washington, where he believes he can
be most useful, as he considers the most
important- need of the hour to be the
reduction of war expenses and the re
turn of a large portion of those in the
military service as soon as possible to
their former occupations, where they are
most needed.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON'S
LATEST SCANDAL
Money Extracted From a Registered
Letter Sent to a Penitentiary-
Inmate.
SAN QUENTIN, Sept. 7.â About two
weeks ago Bayard Saville, the forger, who
was sentenced to fourteen years in prison
for swindling the widow "Bell," missed
$00 in currency sent to him in a registered
letter from the East. When the letter
arrived at the San Quentin postofflce the
prisoner was notified, as registered let
ters cannot be taken from the office with
out the convict's permission.
Turnkey John C. Jamieson, who opens
and inspects all the correspondence, took
the letter from the postoffice by Savlile'B
authorization. When Saville received the
letter and missed the currency the Post
offlce Department was notified. W
Robertson, the San Francisco inspector'
was sent to investigate. He received a
statement from the Bank of Wilming

in the letter. After an investigation last

WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â Secretary
Alger is now putting his affairs into
shape to admit of his absence from
Washington on a tour of inspection of
the army camps throughout the coun
try. He will leave to-morrow evening,
going first to Camp Meade. Pa., and
thence to Detroit. Now that the ac
tive war operations have closed, the
Secretary feels free to express certain
views entertained by the President and
himself respecting the plans for the
treatment of the soldiers and touching
the persons upon whom responsibili
ties should be placed for some of the
matters of complaint. In this connec
tion he says:
"The regiments that have been or
dered mustered out will be mustered
out. The regiments that have been
designated by the President to re
main in the service will hayÂ« to re
main. As soon as wfe have mustered
out 100,000, more or less, we shall reor
ganize the army â every brigade, divi
sion and corps, and put them into com
fortable camps until such of them as
are needed are withdrawn for service
in Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philip
pines.
"In these camps, with the experience
of the past to guide us, sanitary con
ditions will be strictly enforced. The
men composing the army will be
treated as soldiers. They will be shown
every possible consideration and their
health will be preserved. The officers
commanding regiments and companies
will be held strictly accountable for the
sanitary conditions of the camps. They
are the ones who should be held re
sponsible. During the war many of
th^e officers disregarded the specific
.instructions that had been given look
ing to the proper care of the men. Now
it is time for them to take this work
upon themselves and with the knowl
edge that they are to remain in service
they will be expected to devote their
bast energies to the work. Where men
are incompetent to discharge these du
ties they must give way to competent
FROM THE ALTAR
TO A CITY JAIL
Architect Albrecht Is in
Trouble.
ARRESTED IN SANTA ROSA
SENSATIONAL DENOUEMENT TO
.HIS WEDDING.
Marries a Rancher's Daughter One
Day and on the Next Is Accused
of Having Swindled Busi
ness Men.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
SANTA ROSA, Sept. 7.â Charles Al
brecht, an architect of San Francisco,
obtained a marriage license yesterday
afternoon to wed Miss May Marshall,
a daughter of William Marshall, a well
known farmer residing a short distance
from this city. The ceremony was per
formed later in the day and this morn
ing Albrecht and his bride took a drive
and spent the day at Mark West
Springs.
Upon their return to the home of the
bride's parents this afternoon Albrecht
waa arrested on a charge of having ob
tained money on false pretenses in this
city and issuing a fraudulent check. A
few days ago, it is alleged, Albrecht
went to Brooks & LoomlÃ, a dry goods
firm in this city, and arranged for the
purchase of dress goods for his in
tended. In payment he gave the firm
a check upon the First National Bank
of San Francisco, which was accepted
and the goods delivered.
To-day the suspicions of the firm
were aroused by inquiries from a local
dressmaker who had not been paid for
work she had done. The San Francisco
bank was communicated with by tele
graph' and replied that no name such
as that of Albrecht was on the books.
The arrest followed.
Albrecht when seen in his cell to
night by a Call representative claimed
the whole affair was an unfortunate
mistake and that he would be able to
explain everything in the morning
when he could communicate with San
Francisco by telephone. He said he
could not understand why the check
.had been returned as he had a sufficient
sum In the First National Bank to meet
the check and considerably more be
sides.
It has been learned that Albrecfit
met his bride while she was engaged as
governess in the family of Frank
Hatch, ex-Hawaiian Minister to the
United States, then living at the Palace
Hotel, San Francisco.
During the arrangements for the
wedding Albrecht insisted on paying
the bills, but when the ceremony was
performed he neglected to give the
minister. Jay William Hudson, the cus
men, for again I wish to make It clear
that these company and regimental of
ficers are to be held to account for the
welfare of their men.
"The great complaint of the soldiers
is homesickness, and a great deal of
this has been caused by the Inconsider
ate publications in the sensational
newspapers. Some of it is also charge
able to the fact that the men entered
the army with the expectation tnat
their services would be very short.
Every experienced officer knows that
a great many died of homesickness.
Following the depression which ensues
upon homesickness come other mala
dies, to which the homesick soldier
falls an easy victim, and it is impos
sible to check their course.
"Now, to my mind, the American
people should try to brace these men
up, to encourage them and cause them
to remember that they are soldiers and
are expected to meet a soldier's duties,
The people of this oountfy should not
be given the impression that they have
sent into the army a lot of boys unlit
to withstand the unavoidable vicissi
tudes of camp Ufa. -Some of the com
plaints that have been published are
calculated to make the American army
appear in a poor light to the eyes of
the American people and also to those
of the nations of the world."
The Secretary gave assurance of his
purpose to carry out strictly the deci
sion he had announced to hold field of
ficers responsible for the condition of
their men in the case of Private Hugh
Parrott, who was reported to have per
ished in hlB tent at Montauk, lacking
medical attendance. This, was the case
to which Representative Qrosvenor had
directed the attention of the War De
partment. The Secretary several days
ago called upon the commanding officer
at Camp Wikoff for a report upon the
subject, and to-day he sent a peremp
tory order to General Shatter to create
a court of inquiry to investigate the
case, or, if the facts warranted it, to
shorten the proceedings by ordering a
court-martial at once for the officer
responsible for Parrott's lack of atten
tion.

ALSACE AND LORRAINE
MAY BECOME INDEPENDENT
Sacrifices Which Germany and
France Might Make to Carry Out
the Czar's Peace Plans.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 7.â The No
vosti, in a long article, declares that the
principal subject to be considered by the
disarmament congress must be the ques
tion of Alsace-Lorraine. It anticipates
that the result of a consideration of this
will be either the neutralization or the In
dependence of Alsace-Lorraine, which
will now be possible without wounding
the amour propre of either nation.
Both Germany and Prance, says the-
Novosti, could make this self-sacflnce to
attain the Czar's worthy object and thus
restore friendship and relieve the world
of the burden of armed peace.

HARNESS HORSES
IN FAST CONTESTS
Exciting Sport at the
State Fair.
TRACK RECORD THREATENED
MUCH BETTER CIRCLES THE
COURSE IN 2:09 1-2.
Neretta Has a Walkover for the
Three-Year-Old Stake â Turfman
Hughes Found Alive, but
Not Well, in His Boom.
. Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 7.â The light
harness racers held the track down this
afternoon, and if there were a few days
of just such sport the gallopers would
soon somewhat lose their grip upon
the race-going portion of the public.
Every race and every heat was inter
esting, and when, In the last event,
Much Better, Rex Alto and Beachwood
came down the home stretch In close
order, with the drivers beating a merry
but painful tattoo upon the anatomies
of the contestants, cheers went up that
could be heard in .the far distant hills.
And when F. W. took the second heat
in such style as to install him a warm
favorite before the third heat there was
a mighty plunge on the son of Dorsey's
Nephew.
But "Farmer" Bunch perhaps could
drive trotter or pacer better than he
could sow wheat or kill potato bugs â
in fact, much better, and we noted the
fact that he could have been much
closer to the other San Jose man's horse
in the Becond heat had Bunch willed it.
But perhaps it was better, much better,
to save the favorite a trifle for the third
heat, and may be they will change the
nickname of the driver from "Farmer"
to "General."
Mamie Riley won the first race, a
mile dash for 2:25 trotters, very clever
ly by two lengths after getting away
poorly, while the favorite, Bonsaline,
wound up last. The time was 2:16%.
Dr. J, at 2 to 1 in the betting, led from
"go" to wind-up in the second event,
also a mile dash, but for 2:20 trotters.
Shelby finished a handy second and
Silver Queen, the longest shot in the
race, thirdâ this after showing a lot of
speed.
Lady Margaret, a wee brown mare
from Los Angeles, made every post a
winning one in the third race, for 2:30
pacers, finishing first by three lengths,
Belle W was second and Silas Simmons
third.
Captain Hackett and Harry J met
with an accident in this race, the for
mer's sulky breaking and spilling
Driver Bunch.
Then came the 2:12 pacing race spo
ken of heretofore. In the first heat,
so closely contested, the time waa
2:09%, just a quarter of a second be
hind the track record. In the second it
was 2:11 and in the third 2:13V 4 .
Neretta Jogged over alone for the
three-year-old stake, and a good day's
sport was at an end.
The judges were: A. B. Spreckels,
presiding; John Boggs and Adjutant
General Barrett. The attendance was
even better than that of Tuesday.
Turfman Rienzi Hughes of San Fran
cisco, about whose alleged disappear
ance the Sacramento papers had con
siderable to say, was discovered in bed
at his Second street home. He had
partaken of too much ice water for the
good of his stomach and was ill. Mr.
Hughes ia a very wealthy man and
fears were entertained that he had been
foully dealt with.

CORBETT IS NOW IN
FINE CONDITION
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â James J. Corbett
has returned to training in better condi
tion than even his best friends dared to
hope. He has come back quite his old
self. His weight has decreased a trifle,
but he is etill full of life and bubbling
with confidence.
Taken all In all, Corbett has benefited,
If anything, by the lay-off. He had been
at monotonous work for some time and
was growing impatient at the delay. With
only five weeks In which to get fit he
has turned in to wok as if he loved it.
He believes, as he da before, that he will
win as certainly as the day comes.

mucn oratory and many prophecies of
Democratic success, and was the oc
casion for the establishment of the Gal
laghers in the position of Dictators Ex
traordinary to the Democratic Party
and Most Exalted Mouthpieces of His
Honor the Populist-Silver- Republican-
Democratic Candidate for Governor, j
James G. Maguire. A single hitch i
marred the harmony of the proceed- \
ings. It was when James Gallagher, j
leader of the clan and designated Keep
er of the Official Conscience, attempted !
to nominate four officers of the com- j
mittee in a bunch. Eugene Deuprey
objected to this and declared that It i
savored of a programme. This view i
of the case caused Gallagher to nomin- \
ate his men one at a time, a proceed- |
. Ing that occupied a few minutes more â¢
time, but which satisfied Mr. Deuprey's j
fine sense of fair play because it elimi- i
nated from the proceedings all sus
picion of a programme.
In this connection It may be Interest-
Ing to Judge Magulre to know that The
Call named the ticket of the committee
days and even weeks ago.
The officers of the new committee
are:
CHAIRMAN.
Seth Mann of Oakland.
VICE CHAIRMEN.
Raleigh Barcar of Vacaville.
J. H. Seawell of Ukiah.
C. C. Wright of Los Angeles.
SECRETARY.
Ben Maddox of Visalia.
ASSISTANT SECRETARIES.

PURITY COMMITTEE.
C. C. Wright, Joseph Leggett, John
A. Hicks, Max Magnus, W. C. Graves
and B. V. Sargent.
Dr. Magnus is the man who Is so
obnoxious to the German Democrats of
the city.
After the committee had been called
to order by V. r . H. Alford, the retiring
chairman, R. M. Fitzgerald of Oakland,
addressed the chair for the purpose of
nominating Seth Mann for chairman.
He said:
"We are confronted with a situation
that requires us to put all of our energy
Into the work that is before us, for op
posed to us are the corporations and
the aggregated wealth of the com
munity. It therefore behooves us to
Belect such men for our leaders as have
our confidence and upon whom we can
rely. The situation interests us more
than at any time in the past and each
of us must lend our assistance to the
effort that is to be made by the party.
It is with this object in view that I
now desire to nominate for chairman of
this committee Seth Mann of Oak
land."
Dockweiler of Los Angeles moved
that nominations be declared closed and
Mr. Mann was elected by acclamation.
Upon taking the chair Mr. Mann said:
"I thank you most heartily and sin
cerely for the great honor that you
have conferred upon me. I have not
had experience in such a place before,
but I have always been active in the
campaign work of the party. What I
lack in experience I hope to make up
in zeal and I promise you that I will
do all that I can and that I have a
very hlph conception of the duties that
have been imposed on me.
"Our duties are chiefly executive and
It is our desire that we open the cam
paign at once and pet down to busi
ness. A Democratic administration of
the gubernatorial office is now about to
be closed and every Democrat can feel
a just pride in the work that has been
accomplished by Governor Budd. We
have nominated a ticket and it is a
mon Cause.
ticket of the people. It is our duty to
work for the success of that ticket, and
If we do so work there is no doubt
that we will achieve success. In con
clusion let me say that we have a
united Democracy behind us and that
every Democrat in the State will be
found working energetically for the
success of the whole ticket."
After the election of the other offi
cers of the committee W. H. Alford
moved that the executive committee be
composed of fifteen members, and that
the chairman of the State committee
be given power to increase the number
as he saw fit. Carried. On motion
of Wright of Los Angeles the thanks
of the committee was tendered to Mr.
Alford for his services to the party dur
ing the past two years. Judge Ma
gulre was then called to the platform
and spoke as follows:
"I have never in my experience at
tended a meeting of the Democratic
State Central Committee where the
spirit of enthusiasm was so clearly
manifested as it is here to-day. Never
have I seen so general a representation
from every quarter of the State. I
think this augurs well for the work
that is to be done.
"I shall not speak of the issues of
the campaign, but those issues are
! worthy of the most earnest effort of
every Democrat in the land. They are
j worthy of the best efforts of every
j man who believes in upholding the
| right against organized aggression. If
we would win we must win by intelli
gent and voluntary effort. On the
other side all the power that wealth can
bring will be put forward. If they
find us divided, if they find us apa
thetic, they will defeat us.
"I believe I see in the spirit mani
fested here to-day a purpose and a de
termination that you will not be over
thrown by any such means. If we
would meet them and answer them and
make their efforts futile we must or
ganize our people throughout the State.
We must put our men to work.
"The situation is altogether hopeful
for the Democracy of the State. I be
lieve we shall be successful. As soon
as the work of the campaign is mapped
out I propose to take my place in the
ranks of the workers of the party and
do whatever Is within my power to
bring victory to our banners."
Calls were made for Governor Budd
and in response he said:
"What I have to say will be said dur
ing the campaign. Where my voice
I will do any good in the State it will be
I heard. I believe that with Maguire
and the principles of our party we will
j win."
Mayor Phelan made a short address
I in which he eulogized Maguire and at
| tributed tho past success of the party
i to the Australian ballot law which he,
the Mayor, had helped to frame. He
â¢ was followed by W. H. Alford. William
\ T. Jeter; C. C. Wright, J. H. Seawell
j and others.
The meeting adjourned with throe
i cheers for Maguire and the Populist
| Silver Republican-Democratic ticket.
HENRY T. GAGE INDORSED.
Citizens' Republican Party Pledges
Support to the Entire State
Ticket.
The County Committee of the Citizens'
Republican party met last night, with
Charles W. Forbes in the chair.
The following resolutions, introduced
by Thomas B. O'Brien, were adopted by
a rising vote:
Whereas, It Is incumbent upon the part
of the Citizens' Republican party to assert Its
status as an established political organiza
tion whose nominees at the last election re
| eelved a minimum vote of 7000 and a maxi
[ mum vote of 15.000, and a Congressional vote
I of 10,940, all of which were enrolled and loy
ally supported the National Republican ticket;
therefore,
Resolved, That we now pledge our un
swerving allegiance to the nominees of the
State Republican ticket as approved hy the

council of our party In the State. As soldiers
In the grand army of protection, patriotism,
! prosperity and territorial expansion, each and
i all Infallibly pledge one another to earnestly
I work for the success of tho party of Lincoln,
| Garfield, Harrison, McKlnley and Oa^e.
O'Brien then spoke at length in support
of the State ticket, but said that the
j members were not bound to support any
local ticket In part named by Martin
Kelly, whom he denounced as a political
Hessian. "We will stand loyally by the
State ticket," said he, "and we repudiate

the charge made by our enemies that
Henry T. Gage, our standard bearer, is
controlled by any corporation. The best
answer to their calumny is that he is
loved and respected by all who know him.
The grand demonstration given him on
his return to his home in Los Angeles is
ample proof of what his neighbors think
of him. Henry T. Gage never earned a
ten-cont piece in his life from any cor
poration, and the people of this Golden
State know that it is to their best inter
ests to elect him Governor at the coming
election."
The committee then adjourned, subject
to the call of the chair.
A Uniformed Republican Club.
Over forty of the younger members of
the Republican party met at the Union
League Club last nighf and organized a
uniform Republican club. S. K. Thorn

DALTON HAS
CONFIDENCE
Will Not Be Omitted
From the Ticket.
Oakland Office San Frnnclsco Call.
908 Broadway, Sept. 7.
There is no longer any doubt as to the
method in which Assessor Dalton will
seek a nomination to succeed himself. He
stated to-day that he would go into the
convention with a solid delegation from
the First Ward, and that he had no fear
of the result.
"I shall certainly have a place on the
Republican ticket," said the Assessor this
afternoon. "1 shall have a delegation
from my ward, and I have no doubt re
garding my support from the other
wards. I cannot say now what other can
didates may be on my ticket from the
First. I understand that Robert Graham
is a candidate for Auditor and Dr. Blood
for Coroner, but as yet we have had no
understanding with one another.
"I do not expect to get any support
from the railroad. That is but natural.
I will admit I have done nothing for tnem
except treat them fairly, and I cannot ex
pect them to do anything for me except
probubly try to throw me down. I have
so much confidence In my own .standing
before this county that 1 venture to say
that no Republican ticket will be made
up without my name being upon It. 1 am
now seeing how many of my friends are
likely to be placed on ticket's from other
wards, and 1 am gratified at the pros
pect."
This statement of Mr. Daiton ends
much uncertainty. It means that there
will be a convention fight between As
sessor Dalton from the extreme west of
town and "Bob" I^eckle from the east
end, should Mr. I^eokie succeed in getting
the delegation from the Seventh. This
Possibility is of course denied by Frank
Jordan's supporters. One of the most
conservative of the Seventh Ward poli
ticians said to-day that there will be no
walkover in the Seventh Ward for any
body. The contest between Frank Jordan
and the dissatisfied Hllborn men is being
fanned by interested parties, and the pri
maries may produce a surprise either
way.
There has been much talk about some
of the San Francisco Republican leaders
taking a hand in Alameda politics. This
statement is generally regarded as ab
surd. Although it is possible in view of
facts that can be guessed at by every
intelligent politician, that much 'interest
may be felt in the county legislative
ticket, It is ridiculous to assume or to pre
sume that politicians outside of Alameda
are interested in her Recorder or her
Township Constables.
In the Third Ward Committeeman J. I.
Palmer is evidently trying to please all
the candidates, and the task as shown
by his many communications to the coun
ty committee is not an easy one. Some
days since Mr. Palmer wrote that he
would arrange to have the entire Third
Ward blanketed, and named the polling
placos. A few hours later he sent an
other letter to the secretary stating that
after deliberation he had concluded to
change his first plan and substituting an
other. Still later he has sent a third
plan to the secretary to be incorporated
in the call, in which he says that "after
mature deliberation" he has decided that
his first nlan is the best.
Committeeman Riley is thinking that if
each of the thirteen committeemen de
liberates and maturely deliberates and
then changes his mind after all in re
fard to his district, the call will be ready
or publication about Christmas, instead
of Saturday next, as ordered by the coun
ty committee.

DEMOCRATS
IN A PRETTY
WRANGLE
Office-Seekers Resent
Accusations.
WANT TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
COMMITTEE OF ONE HUNDRED
HAS A WARM SESSION.
Almost a Free Fight Among the Gen
tlemen Who Claim to Govern
the Local Democ
racy.
Less than a majority of the Demo
cratic Committee of One Hundred met
last evening, transacted a little busi
ness and indulged in a great deal of
oratorical warfare that at times threat
ened to lead to personal encounters and
a free fight. As It was, the members
who participated in the row confined
themselves to calling each other bad
names and accusing one another of po
litical dishonesty and bad faith.
The trouble began when a motion was
offered having for its object the exclu
sion from membership of all such mem
bers as are seeking or intend to seek
nominations at the hands of the Demo
cratic Municipal Convention. The sug
gestion came from Francis J. Heney,
but it was aÂ£ once met with such a
storm of protests that it became appar
ent that if such an order was carried
into effect there would not be enough
members in good standing remaining
to form a whist party. In repelling the
attacks to which his motion subjected
him Mr. Heney went so far as to say
that it was within his personal knowl
edge that members of the committee
who received nominations at the hands
of the State Convention had appointed
delegates to that convention who
they knew were favorable to their can
didacy.
This assertion caused another howl to
be raised and it was not until Chair
man Dunn, who, by the way, was him
self within the sweeping limits of the
accusation, poured oil on the troubled
waters that danger of a free for all
fight was averted.
The first business of Importance that
came before the meeting were' the
resignations of William Craig, candi
date for Congress from the Fifth Dis
trict, and James N. Block. Thf>y were
accepted without comment. William
M. Hinton, candidate for Railroad
Commissioner, then handed in his
resignation. This brought Dr. Beverly
Cole to his feet. He declared he was
surprised that at the twelfth hour Mr.
Hinton and the other gentlemen had
discovered the Impropriety of being
members of the Committee of One
Hundred. "Is it possible," he said,
"that these gentlemen have just dis
covered that they occupy a delicate
position before the public? Is it possi
ble that when they were naming dele
gates to the State convention they did
not know that they were to be candi
dates before that convention? If I al
lowed myself to be influenced by my
ideas of propriety I would say that my
friend Mr. Hinton ought to be ashamed
of himself."
Chairman Dunn' apologized for Mr.
Hinton and himself by saying that
neither had desired to serve as mem
bers of the committee and that their
membership had been forced on them.
When peace had been restored the
magazine was again fired by a motion
offered by Joseph N. Nougues, provid
ing that all members intending to be
come candidates for municipal offices
should hand in their resignations at th^>
next meeting of the committee. Francis
J. Heney offered as an amendment that
on and after September 15 no member
of the committee would be eligible to
a nomination at the hands of the
municipal convention. In speaking to
the motion Mr. Heney said that it was
improper that a candidate for nomina
tion should have a voice in the selec
tion of the delegates whom he wished
to act on his candidacy.
Franklin K. Lane resented the con
clusions of Mr. Heney purely in the in
terests of the horde of would-be can
didates, of which he is one. He de
clared that he was of the opinion that
no member of the committee would take
such an unfair advantage. "We are
among gentlemen and men of honor,"
he said, "and I do not believe that they
would do anything that was not gen
tlemanly and honorable."
Heneyâ l personally know of mem
bers of this committee who appointed
delegates to the State convention who
would vote for them as candidates be
fore that convention.
Chairman Dunn â It would be gentle
manly of you to give names.
Heneyâ l refer to a candidate for
CongTess who is a member of this com
mittee.
A voice â If you mean James H. Barry
It is a lie.
Sammy Braunhartâ l rise to a ques
tion of privilege. I want the gentle
man called down.
Chairman Dunnâ Mr. Heney owes it
to Mr. Hinton and myself to explain.
Heneyâ l know that it is contrary to
human nature for any man to sit in
judgment on his own case and not favor
himself. It is not human nature for a
candidate for office to select a delegate
who is not favorable to himself.
E P, E. Troyâ l rise to a point of
order. This man's remarks are un
gentlemanly and I demand that he be
required to explain.
Heney â Before the meeting of the
State Convention I was told by Mr.
Nougues that if I continued the fight
that I was making in this committee I
would be thrown out bodily. Now, I
never was thrown out of a place in my
life and I have never resigned under
fire and that is why I am here now.
Max Popper created a diversion by
offering an amendment to the amend
ment providing that all members of the
committee who were seeking subordi-
nate political positions by appointment
or otherwise, or who had relatives who
were seeking subordinate positions, be
declared ineligable to membership. In
speaking to the motion he said that he
believed there were not one hundred
Democrats in San Francisco who were
not seeking some such position. This
was too much and all of the motions
were voted down by an overwhelming
majority.
Chairman Dunn tendered his resigna
tion, which was accepted. He was
tendered a vote of thanks for his serv
ices. On motion of Nougues Jasper N.
McDonald was elected chairman to fill
the vacancy caused by the resignation
of Dunn. The following appointments
were made to fill vacancies:
Twenty-eighth District, Lawrence
Hoey; Thirty-first, Charles J. Gal
lagher; Thirtieth, John Heney; Thirty
fourth, John A. Helms; Thirty-seventh,
W. P. Sullivan; Forty-first, W. B. San
born; Forty-fourth, H. L. Ray.
The committee adjourned to meet
next Tuesday evening.
Ocean View Republicans.
The Regular Republican Club of Ocean
View, at a meeting last night, indorsed
by resolution the Republican State ticket.

WHEN THE OREGON COMES HOME-
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that as a result of recent developments in the
international situation, or because of a desire
of the administration to be prepared for emergen
cies, the battleships Oregon and lowa will leave
within the next ten days for the Pacific Coast. The
two vessels are now at the Brooklyn Navy-yard,
where they are being put into proper trim for the
long voyage.
It appears uncertain as yet to what part of the Pa
cific the ships will proceed. Reports are in circula
tion that they will be ordered at once to Manila, but
the prevailing opinion is that they will be attached to
the Pacific station and ordered to some point from
â¢which they could defend the coast or hasten if
needed to the Philippines. It is, therefore, probable
the two may come to this port and be stationed here
ior some time.
If the plans of the Navy Department are correctly
outlined by these reports, and the Oregon and the
lowa arc about to come to San Francisco, we shall
have an opportunity for a war celebration and a tri
umph of victory of our own fully as enthusiastic as
any witnessed in the Eastern States. Of course the
coming of the two battleships through the Golden
Gate will not be like the grand naval parade of all
the fleet of Sampson at New York, but the occasion
here can be made just as patriotic and as joyous as
was that of the Eastern metropolis.
It is estimated that the two ships will make the run
from New York at about eleven knots an hour, and
that they will reach their destination in the Pacific
early in November. That would bring them to our
harbor at the pleasantest season of the year, when the
fogs have ceased to obscure the bay and before the
rains have set in. It will be worth while, therefore,
for our civic authorities and organizations to find out
from Washington whether the ships are to come to
San Francisco, and if so at what date they will be due,
in order that we may prepare for them a grand re
ception.
It is scarcely necessary to say that such a recep
tion as the one suggested would make as jubilant a fes
tival as San Francisco has ever seen. We are all proud
of the victories achieved by our fleets during the war
with Spain, and particularly so of the splendid record
made by the great battleship built in our own ship
yards. There will be no need of earnest appeals to
arouse enthusiasm at such a reception as that will be.
All classes of our people, men, women and children,
will join the throngs that shout applause when the
Oregon comes home.
TriE OUTPOST.
RESIDENTS of the Mission and all owners of
property in that section of the city are to be
congratulated upon the appearance in the field
of journalism of The Outpost, a weekly devoted
mainly to making known to the general public the
many advantages of that flourishing part of the com
munity, promoting its industries and advancing its
interests.
The new weekly is strongly edited, being under the
charge of E. S. Harrison, one of the progressive
and enterprising of the younger business men of the
State, and \V. C. Morrow, whose reputation in litera
ture is international, and whose accomplishments in
the journalism of the metropolis are familiar to all.
The field which The Outpost has undertaken to fill
is a broad one, and success in its enterprise will re
dound to the benefit of the whole city. It is beyond
all doubting that the Mission district is destined to
become one of the greatest industrial localities of the
United States. It has already far advanced in that
direction. Moreover, it has a distinctive social as
well as business life of its own, and can well afford to
maintain a champion for itself among the newspapers
of the State. For that reason The Outpost may be
regarded as a venture wisely undertaken, and in the
hands of its capable editors will achieve a speedy
reputation for the excellence of its journalistic
methods and the usefulness of its work.
Middle-of-the-road Populists have already nomi
nated their choice for President in 1000. Their ob
ject is to head off fusion. Certain to be licked, they
want the honor of being licked as Populists. It is
rather a doubtful honor, but it is all the campaign
promises them.
President Dole refuses to call on the Hawaiian
Commissioners because he thinks they should first
call on him. This is a very important point. The
world will please stand still while it is being settled.
When a report is sent out that volunteers ordered
to Porto Rico will mutiny rather than obey, the coun
try simply takes the privilege of not believing the
report. â  .*
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1898.
c HINT TO WELLS-FfIRCO.
SEVERAL times there has been necessity for
calling upon the Wells-Fargu Express Com
pany to change its attitude. As it stands with
all four feet in the trough, people are likely to accuse
it of swinish proclivities. As this would doubtless
pain that good man, President Pecksniff Valentine,
the counsel to reform is here repeated.
There is in circulation a pamphlet of apology for
the express company. Besides a plea for mercy,
some fallacious reasoning and a few threats, it con
tains soothing and sustaining editorials from certain
subsidized papers. We scan it vainly for a glimpse
of a Call editorial bearing on the subject, and yet
venture the expression of belief that even to the
Wells-Fargo people these editorials have been inter
esting and instructive. From this pamphlet we
quote one paragraph:
"4. It is certainly most economical for shippers to
furnish the stamp, as any revised express rates in
cluding it would, unavoidably, at least double the
expense to them. It is hoped the people will con
sider this fact, and accept the action of the express
companies as moderate and just, and not withhold
their esteemed good will and patronage from the
express."
Here is a flagrant and impertinent attempt at in
timidation. The company virtually acknowledges
that it ought to pay the tax, but will not; that if
forced to obey the law it will revise its rates so as
to make the shipper more than pay the cost of the
stamp. It is a rogue pleading guilty and impu
dently proclaiming intent to do worse if punished.
Now why should this corporate monopoly be per
mitted to rise superior to the law?
The Wells-Fargo Express Company is a common
carrier, and as such subject to regulation by the Rail
road Commissioners. It will be their duty to bring
it to its senses. This express, company charges from
two to three times the rate charged by similar con
cerns in the East. It is an absolute monopoly, con
trolling every avenue leading to San Francisco. Last
year it paid dividends of 10 per cent on a capitaliza
tion of $8,000,000, and of this capital $7,500,000 is
fictitious. In other words, only half a million capi
tal has been paid into the concern. Seventy-five per
cent of this dividend was derived from California and
90 per cent of the stock is held in the East. Such
are a few of the facts tending to show that this State
owes to Wells-Fargo no debt of gratitude.
Once the company refused to carry the daily papers
unless they would pay for the required stamps. This
the papers refused to do, but they are being carried
just the same, and are not paying for the stamps.
The private citizen has every right of a daily paper.
He can take his parcel to the office, advance the cus
tomary rate and decline to pay for the stamp. If
the company proves obdurate in the case of any in
dividual. The Call will take up his fight for him and
endeavor to force the company to obey the law. Not
only is it just that Wells-Fargo be not permitted to
escape its share of the war tax, but the shocking
spirit of unpatriotism it has displayed merits rebuke.
President Pecksniff Valentine may issue pamphlets
to the delight of his soul, but they will not fool any
body. The concern of which he is the head is trying
a despicable bunko game. There is comfort in know
ing that it is not beyond regulation by the Legisla
ture. Part of the duty of every voter is to see that
men obedient to the orders of such corporations be
not sent to Sacramento. Wells-Fargo people must
be brought to their senses, and if shame fail to impel
them to lead better lives, be forced into decent be
havior anyhow.
"HELLO. CENTRAL."
NEXT to the Wells-Fargo Express Company, the
Telephone Company is perhaps the most ab
solute monopoly in California. Like the for
mer, it is trying to sneak out of payment of its por
tion of the war tax. Of course this is contempti
ble, but the company does not care so long as it can
cinch its patrons, and the patrons make no plaint.
When the tax was first imposed the Telephone
Company announced, as though to obey the law were
a shining virtue, that it would pay the tax. Even
this was a pretense. It paid for the stamps, but
by raising rates to non-subscribers could do this and
have greater profits than before. The remedy for
this is for customers to refuse to submit to the impo
sition. When a stranger desires to talk to an out
of-town point, he is not apt to stop to ascertain that
the regular rate is 30 cents, but will pay 40 on de
mand and go away unaware that he has been robbed.
For the sake of justice, he should first find the regu
lar rate as published and not yield a cent more. In
calmly submitting he wrongs himself and the public,
besides permitting the telephone monopoly to pose
as a patriotic concern, which it is not.
There are other things in common between the
two corporations mentioned. Both are subject to
legislative regulation, and each considers that it is a
law unto itself. Each pays large dividends on West
ern business, and pays them to Eastern stockholders.
The Telephone Company, however, has had a warn
ing it would do well to heed. It was hoped the ex
perience of a Washington (D. C.) concern, disas
trous, but deserved, would serve to make clear to it
the error of its ways, but evidently it must be given
an individual lesson. The next Legislature will have
to deal with it. and thereafter, while it may be no
more patriotic, it may be more discreet.
OUR BOYS AT MANILA.
AS accounts come in of the action of the Califor
nia boys at Manila the people of this State
feel a thrill for the bravery of the Â»oldiers who
represent them on a distant shore that has been alien,
but where now the stars and stripes are flying. In
the far-away Philippines the flag throws its shadow
upon patriots as valiant as ever defended it. Some of
these patriots are of California, and we glory in them.
Our hearts swell with pride at reading of their cour
age, the unshrinking nerve with which they faced the
foe in the darkness of a tropic night. No soldiers
tried by long campaigning could have done more.
For those who fell there is the tribute of a tear.
Well may they rest. They died for the country which
had sent them forth with blessings, and their memory
shall be held sacred. They died gallantly. Soldiers,
patriots and friends, California mourns for them and
yet glories that when the nation is in peril men such
as these rush to the rescue and offer their lives.
There is nothing to be said about the unspeakable
wretch who bored holes in the bow of a vessel about
to put to sea with a load of passengers. The English
language is barren of terms fitted to describe him.
American doctors are not permitted to practice in
Dawson, but the Canadian Government makes the
concession of not fining the unfortunate people who
die by reason of the consequent neglect.
Perhaps the soldiers have suffered unnecessarily,
but there are no indications that anybody is coming
forward to accept the blame.
General Miles has reached this country, and ad
mits that he really said it
AN EXPLANATION NECESSARY.
AMONG local political organizations the Non-
Partisan, or Deacon Fitch party, looms up as
the most unique known to municipal history.
This party has a "convention," which, we believe,
consists of about fifty prominent citizens, mostly per
sonal friends of Mr. Fitch or relations of each other.
How the "convention" originally came into being has
long since been forgotten. It is sufficient to know
that it was once appointed by somebody â probably
Deacon Fitch â and that from year to year it con
tinues to exist without any other excuse than such as
each one of its members has for living.
Like the British House of Lords, it has no term
of office. Its members are appointed for life. Va
cancies are created only by death or resignation.
Removal from the city does not disqualify a person
to serve as a member of the Non-Partisan convention,
for it is said on reliable authority that several of its
leading spirits reside in Oakland. When the cam
paign comes around all Deacon Fitch does is to blow
a horn, and the Non-Partisans come trooping in from
the suburbs, prepared to nominate a "reform" ticket
to purify the local government.
Mr. Fitch, like his party, is a unique politician.
He does not care how reform is achieved so long as
it gets there. Delegates from Siskiyou, San Diego,
Hawaii or the Philippines would answer his purpose
as well as delegates from Oakland, San Rafael or
Menlo Park.
We do not wish to be understood as disparaging
the purpose for which the Non-Partisan "convention"
exists. Perhaps it is well that it should continue to
hold a club over the heads of the other parties and
threaten them unless they nominate capable men it
will try to defeat them. Some such influence is gen
erally necessary to produce good municipal results.
But, nevertheless, the Non-Partisan party is an ex
ceedingly comical party. It rails at bossism, and yet
Deacon Fitch, its leader, is a boss compared with
whom Boss Croker, the New York potentate, is a
mere pigmy. Croker is compelled to handle his in
struments tenderly and at all times placate them with
offices. Mr. Fitch scorns any such methods. His
marionettes dance without music. He does not even
beat time for them. He merely toucnes the button
and they do his bidding. The deacon must be a
hypnotist.
The Non-Partisan party, however, is not entirely
without political standing. By virtue of votes given
for its candidates two years ago it has a legal right
to a place on the official ballot, and it could, if Deacon
Fitch so desired, organize a very effective local fight.
Why it confines itself to indorsing the candidates of
other parties is therefore a mystery. Six years ago
the Non-Partisans elected the Mayor. Two years
ago they elected a Superior Judge by an overwhelm
ing majority. Presumably if Mr. Fitch should go in
for everything he might, as they say at the race track,
win out. W r hy he does not do so needs explanation.
It is well known that the political bosses trade
offices with each other. The deacon has resolved this
year to indorse only. Can it be possible that he has
made arrangements with McNab, Rainey, Kelly and
the others by which they are to divide up the govern
ment and run it on the co-operative plan? We do
not exactly suspect Boss Fitch, but he is such an ir
responsible political potentate â having a tighter con
vention than any of his colaborers in the domain of
pure politics â that we think a public explanation of
the springs which work his conscience would be ex
ceedingly appropriate. Let us have such an explana
tion.
THE CHINESE IN HAWAII.
AS The Call has ceaselessly insisted would be the
case, the annexation party in Hawaii is out for
a continuance of Chinese labor and immigra
tion in that country.
By late advices we learn that the points made are:
First â The Hawaiian Chinese are much superior
to their countrymen in California.
Second â The exclusion laws of the United States
were intended only for the continental territory of
the United States, and to extend them to extracon
tinental territory since acquired will be going beyond
the intentions of the last treaty with China.
Third â Chinese labor is indispensable in Hawaii.
It does not compete with white labor, which cannot
live there. The industries of the islands will fail and
the planters will be ruined unless Chinese labor is
permitted.
Fourth â The Chinese are orderly and law abiding,
unlike the more truculent and uneasy Japanese, and
therefore should not be discriminated against.
A traverse of these grounds will convince our read
ers of the absolute correctness of The Call's position
in opposing the annexation of Hawaii in the interest
of the sugar production and labor of this coast.
It is not true that white labor can be used as a sub
stitute for coolie labor in Hawaii, and President Dole
knew it when he pretended to want such labor taken
there. We have insisted that after this country was
hoodwinked into annexation its Hawaiian promoters
would have to secure lawful permission to use coolie
labor or submit to the commercial decay of the
islands. Of course they denied this, but the demands
they are now making of the commission which is
framing a government for them prove the insincerity
of their denial.
We desire to say that this is a bad time to bring
home from Hawaii a code of coolie laws. It is not
with any pleasure that we say this, not even with the
feeling of satisfaction which goes with saying "I told
you so."
But it is with profound regret that we contemplate
the situation, and it will be with regret that we will
continue to apprise the people of what is going on
before the commission at Honolulu, where the ar
gument is being made that the United States must
abandon its policy of equality before the law, its one
system under one written constitution, and vary its
legislation to fit various conditions, so that what are
the rights of an American citizen under the flag in
one place will be denied to him under the same flag
in another place.
Such a change is so serious in its import and its far
stretching effects as to cause the greatest disquiet
even when only proposed. What will it cause when it
is accomplished?
English troops have been righting valiantly, but
their officers were not where the bullets flew thickest.
Perhaps discretion is as valuable in war as courage.
The death-list of the American army shows that our
officers sought the same danger to which their men
were exposed.
When humble citizens refuse to obey the law they
go to jail. The express companies refuse to obey
the iaw and to people who indicate displeasure they
say, "What are you going to do about it?" Tweed
used to ask a similar question.
Any person receiving an anonymous gift of food or
drink by mail will be wise to try it on the dog, se
lecting a dog not held in high esteem.
The trouble with the poundkeeper's deputies seems
to be that they think a reputable citizen and a yellow
cur merit exactly the same treatment
RECENT WORK OF THE ARTISTS.
Officers of the Bohemian Club have
made arrangements in New York to pre
sent for hanging In the wardroom of
the battleship Oregon, the magnificent
picture of the ship painted by Charles
Rollo Peters. The picture represents
night on the ocean and the Oregon steam
ing at high speed to join Sampson's fleet
at Key West. The picture, framed in
wood from the famous frigate Hartford,
the flagship of Admiral Farragut, was
purchased by the members of the Bohe
mian Club for presentation to the Oregon.
Irving M. Scott, Clay M. Greene and Jos
eph D. Redding, assisted by the sympa
thetic Lambs Club of New York, have
been detailed by Major James A. Thomp
son, president of the Bohemian institu
tion, to direct the ceremonies of present
ing the picture to the ship. A letter has
been received from Clay Greene in which
the details of the proposed ceremony are
outlined. The painting itself is highly
commended by New York artists.
Alexander Harrison, who is well known
in Europe as one of the first marine paint
ers of the day, is expected to arrive in
this city to-night. Mr. Harrison is the
founder of the school of painting nude fig
ures out of doors. Before he directed his
attention to this form of painting artists
were content to work indoors, with such
effects as a fake landscape scene might
suggest. Figures posed out of doors take
on the color and reflection of the sur
roundings. The success attained by Mr.
Harrison engaged the notice of other lead
ing artists in France and England and
now outdoor posing is quite common.
Alexander Harrison was in San Fran
cisco seventeen years ago. He was then
connected with the Coast Survey but had
time to make little excursions to inland
and thus gained a delightful impression
of the country. For many years he has
entertained with delight the prospect of
revisiting this region. Plans formed a
year ago for a journey hither were set
aside to meet engagements on the other
side of the Atlandtic.
Pictures from the studio of Mr. Har
rison are in every notable gallery of Eu
rope, including the Luxembourg of Paris.
He is a chevalier of the Legion of Honor,
a juror of the Champs do Mars Salon and
a member of the leading associations of
British painters. According to letters and
telegrams received by Charles R. Peters
from Mr. Harrison, the eminent artist
will be in California for a month or six
weeks. Monterey, which seems to pos
sess an irresistible fascination for artists,
will bo one of the first places visited by
Mr. Harrison after resting from his trip
across the continent. The artists who
take an active interest in th* attairs of
the Bohemian Club will arrange a fitting

TEMPLES M/vDE WITH HANDS.
With reverent and unceasing care,
Striving to make divinely fair
That house of God, the human thought.
Scholars have tolled and saints have
wrought
With passionate zeal, the centuries
through,
To shape man's mind and soul unto
A certain form, a certain creed.
Like some great minster-shrine. Indeed,
Clear-carven, stately, aisled, and dim.
"Behold God's house! Come, worship
him,"
They cry. "He dwelleth only here!
Acknowledge him with holy fear."
Yet, lo! outside the temple walls
God's sunshine just as sweetly falls;
Beyond Its outer gate still lies
A world of pain and sacrifice;
Beyond that world, a universe
Not to be summed in prayer or verse.
Omnipotence must stlfl transcend
The finite mind that knows no end.
And still life's questions, still life's needs,
Must overflow all human creeds;
Nor is God's majesty so small
That human hearts can hold it all.
Always the temple which we raise
Shuts out the sound of wider praise,
Shuts out the glories of the light
Which streams from out the infinite;
Always our bonds of time and space
Limit our vision of God's face.
We know in partâ how then can we
Make plain each heavenly mystery?
Yet still the Almighty understands
Our human hearts, our human hands,
And, overarching all our creeds,
Gives his wide presence to our needs.

function in honor of Mr. Harrison some
time during his sojourn in this city.
The representatives of the painting
fraternity in San Francisco are not roll
ing in Wealth, but some of the painters
are quite busy. Joseph D. Strong, is ex
hibiting industry, talent and portraits.
His greatest success in portraits is tne
picture of William Greer Harrison. Por
traits of Colonel George W. Granniss and
Ignatz Steinhart command attention. Mr.
Strong is painting, for the Bohemian
Club, a picture of William Sproule, and
the portrait will grace the walls of the
club room, as Mr. Sproule is an ex-presi
dent of the institution. According to a
custom honored in the observance
space must be provided for the picture of
every ex-presldent of the club. Occasion
ally'a man is re-elected, for the second
term. In that event he gets two pictures
of himself, one for each term.
H. J. Breuer is painting the cartoon for
the midsummer high jinks this year. The
picture will join the collection in which
such artists as Tavernler, Hill, Keith,
Stanton, Robinson, Liatimer, Williams
and Strong are represented.
This term John A. Stanton Is the prin
cipal teacher of the school of design,
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. Arthur
Mathews is in Kurope pursuing favorite
studios, and Stanton is at the hea<l of
the school. Chapel Judaon is teacher of
the night class. Under the progressive
administration of Joseph D. Grant, presi
dent of the association, the school is
prospering, while tho affairs of the insti
tute generally receive prompt attention,
Mr. Stanton gets t'mp to do a little out
side work. He is painting a drop curtain
for Mayor x'helan's theater at San Jose.
The curtain ought to be a joy forever,
as It is a thing of beauty. The scene rep
resents a wooded suburb of Paris whtn
the empire was flourishing. Foliage en
chanting in color, women appropriately
clothed arid decently posed, are some of
the original suggestions of the Mayor's
curtain.
The tented field incident to the war
gives the artists opportunity to diversify
their work. "The Camp at the Cross" Is
the title of a beautiful and strikingly ef
fective picture painted by Charles Rollo
Peters. The figure of a sentinel near a
camp fire, the light in a tent not far dis
tant and the Lone Mountain cross in bold
outline attracts instant notice. The ni^ht
scene in camp represents the best of
much good work In this line recently
done by Mr. Peters. The painting may
remain in San Francisco. Several Mon
terey night scenes painted by this artist
have been purchased in England.
C. D. Robinson, whose success as a
marine painter cannot be disputed, has
been working for some time on an am
bitious painting to represent the sailing

DOOM OF THE
FIVE GEORGES
The Fateful Handwriting on the
Greenroom Wall and a Strange
Prophecy.
"The Handwriting on the Greenroom
Wall; or, the Fate of the Five Georges,"
would be a good title for a short story
based on a simple incident connected with
a dressing-room in the Alcazar Theater.
Years ago, when that popular playhouse
was new, it so happened that there were
five Georges in the company during a cer
tain season, and they were all assigned
to one dressing-room. Furthermore, they
were jolly, congenial spirits, bravely
struggling toward the helghta of fame
and emolument. These live Georges were
Osbourne, Webster, McConnick, Galloway
and Newhall. Incidentally Webster wrote
his name and those of his roommates
upon the ceiling of the room, and in the
fatality of the record it was a case of
"Thmlast shall be first."
It was on a Saturday afternoon, and
these young men had been at a Jolly ..in
ner, and after the feast Webster in a
sentimental mood wrote the names. He
also made a prophecy. In which he stated
that In the order in which the names were
written so would the possessors succeed
In their histrionic career, and that the
black curtain would ring down on them
in a reverse orderâ that the last named
would be the first to go to celestial scenes
of conquest.
Notwithstanding the jest was made
while under the mellowing influences of a
big dinner and a persistent brand of wine,
it is still something to marvel at. Days,
weeks, months and years were rolled
back into the scroll of eternity, and natu
rally the inscriptions on the wall grew
dim and faded Into illegibility. Out of the
five tracings only a part of two remainâ
"Geo. Osb- â " and "George W ," and
it appears to be only a matter of a short
time when these lines will have been ob
literated.
The next peculiar and fatal phase of the
written record is the fact that as the
names faded from the last toward the
first, the doomed actor passed from the
mimic to the mystic world. McCormick
fell from a defective platform in the
Baldwin Theater, broke his collarbone.
Injured his lungs and died shortly or
quick consumption. Galloway went about
the same time, and only recently Mitchell
dropped dead on the stage of an Eastern
theater during a performance. Webster
for some time was on the highway of
prosperity with J. A. Brady, and is now
leading a company on the coast circuit
In another way "Webster's prophecy has
been proved true, for Osbourne, whose
name heads the list, has won the great
est prominence as an actor among the
five Georges.
He does not particularly admire the
manner in which his name is fading from
the ceiling, and, while he feels healthy
and strong, under the prediction Webster
should go next and the famous "creator of
the character of "Indian Jack" in "Chls
pa" is deeply concerned as to the health
of his last remaining chum of the quin
tetâWebster.
"It is rathor a weird story." paid Os
bourne the other day while talking of what
had happened to the five Georges, "and
the way the record on the wall is fading
away It will soon be my turn to go un
less Webster succeeds in dodging the
hoodoo of the prophecy. However, I am
not losing any sleep over the proposition
that I will go before my time. My name
still remains sufficiently plain to warrant
the belief that I will be here long enough
to carry out much that I have under
taken before Fate erases the last letters
from the wall and I read my closing
lines."

BILLS OF FARE IN FRENCHâ X M.
0., City. Bills of fare for formal dinners,
especially for official and semi-official
banquets, are printed in French as a mat
ter of fashion derived from European
customs. For a long time French was
the court language in Europeaji countries,
and Is still more generally used than any
other language as a medium of corre
spondence and of conversation, not only
in the various courts and in polite soci
ety, among peoples of different nationali
ties', but at hotels, on railway cars, other
public conveyances and in restaurants,
also between travelers and guides. Time"
was when it was the custom among dip
lomatic officers of all nations to conduct
diplomatic correspondence in French, but
that is passing away and each diplomatic
or consular officer is at liberty to use his
own language to write official documents,
but the French, for the other purposes,
is still almost a necessity for travelers.
This, together with the fact that French
cooks still have the reputation of being
the best in the -world, and that many of '
the finest dishes receive their names from
French inventors, will help to account for
the fact that at grand dinners the bills
of fare are printed in French. "Potage
a la reine" would sound very common
place if given on the bill of fare as
"Queen soup," as also would a great
many other dishes that go to make up
a French dinner.

It Is reported that Governor L*>rd of

quire into the condition and treatment of
the Oregon recruits who are attached to
the Third Battalion of the Twenty-third
Infantry. He will lind upon investigation
that he has been misinformed, as these
recruits have been well treatt-d and are
well officered. The men themselves will
testify to that fact. In this connection
General Miller yesterday sent the follow
ing communication to Adjutant General
Field of the Department of California:
"In reply to tel( grams of September 6
from the Emergency Corps and Ked Cross
Society, I would state that I personally
inspected the battalion of Oregon volun
teers this morning. There are five good
officers, four of whom are regulars, in
charge of the battalion of recruits. The
men are well equipped, are well fed and
happy, and one of the best drilled bat
talions in the Bervice. No one appeared to
want to be mustered out as long as there
was a chance for foreign service. Thtre
was an apparent justification for this re
port three weeks ago, owing to the en
vironment of the troooÃ of Camp Merritt,
and a change of officers attached to it on
account of ofiicrrs who had been attached
going to Manila or Honolulu. The bat
talion would ht> pleased to have the Gov
ernor of the Slate visit it again and see
the fine condition it is in. 1 recommend
that they be not mustered out as long as
there is a chance of their Joining their
regiment."
NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE
A Member of the Tennessee
Regiment "Roasts" a
Kicker.
A private of the First Tennessee Regi
ment, signing himself "An Enlisted
Man," writes to The Call as follows:
"In The Call of the 7th I see an article
addressed to Hugh Craig, president pf
the Chamber of Commerce, and signed,
'The Enlisted Men of the First Tennessee
Regiment," thereby implying that said ar
ticle voiced the sentiment of the entire
regiment of over 1200 men. Now, I am
an enlisted man and I have talked with
a great many enlisted men, and have
never yet met one who knew anything
about such a letter having been written,
nor have I seen one Who is not indignant
â¢over such an article being accredited to
the regiment, Every enlisted man in our
regiment enlisted to serve for two years
or until the war is over. The war is not
over, neither have we served two years,
and until we have fulfilled our agreement
with the Government, we ha\ - e neither
the inclination nor the right to ask for a
discharge. Being an enlisted man, I
know as much about the sentiment of
this regiment as the man who signs him-
Belf 'The EnliÃted Men of the First Ten
nessee'; and I know that a majority of
this regiment is willing to fulfill its obli
gations to the Government. As for the
men not getting enough to eat, I will say
I weigh 185 pounds, and eat accordingly,
nnd I have never yet failed to get enough
to eat, and I will venture to assert that
7r> i>er cent of th*Â» men in this regiment |
weigh more to-day than the day they |
enlisted.
"I know of one man in this regiment
who is a chronic kicker. I have Known
him and his people for years, and I know
that he never in all his life had as much
to eat as he has had since he joined the
army. This class of men always kick. A
majority of us are men and soldiers, and
not afraid to serve our country in time of
peace or time of war."

FOUND DEAD IN THEIR BUNKS
A SAILOR AND TWO FISHERMEN
DROWNED.
Second Mate Smith of the Steamer
Westport Loses His Life While
Running Lines at Bear
Harbor.
A few weeks ago the news was cabled
to the Merchants' Exchange that the
American ship Kenilworth had put into
Valparaiso on fire while on her way from
Hilo, 11. 1., for New York with a cargo
of sugar. The death of the captain, first
mate and cabin boy were reported later,
rind at one time there were fears of foul
play, as Captain Baker wag known to
have had a very "tough" crew. The fol
lowing extract from the ship's log, which
reached here yesterday, gives full par
ticulars of the disaster and sets all doubts
on the matter at rest.
"The Kenilworth sailed from Hilo on
May 22. On July 8 at 3 p. m., when in
south latitude 46 degrees 14 minutes, west
longitude 110 degrees 21 minutes, the car
go was found to be on lire. An hour
later, as the lire was assuming a serious
character, the captain decided to bear up
for Valparaiso. To effect this he altered
the course of the vessel to northeast
one-quarter north.
"At midnight the second officer went to
the captain's cabin and was horrified to
find the master of the ship dead. He had
been suffocated to death. All the doors
had been closed on account of the cold
weather, and the gases from the burn
ing cargo had gÃthered in the after cab
in and caused death. The first mate was
also found suffocated, and the body of the
ship's buy, who was sleeping in the cab
in, his own room having been destroyed
by fire, was found close to that of the
mate. A passenger named G. E. Thrum
was found In a very critical state, but
was got on deck and he linally recov
ered.
"The bodies of the captain, first mate
and boy were buried in south latitude 40
degrees 05 minutes west, longitude 115 de
grees 25 minutes. The names of the dead
are J. G. Baker, captain, 01 years; Ar
thur B. Piper, first officer, 30 years; Heii
ry W. Hobson, boy, 16 years. The lire
continued until the ship arrived in Val
paraiso."
The Kenilworth was taken to Valpa
raiso by Second Officer V. H. Generat,
and as soon as the news of the disaster
reached New York Captain Murphy of
the Shenandoah was sent out to take
command of the vessel. Mr. Thrum, the
passenger who so nearly lost his life, was
the bookkeeper of the Papaicu sugar
plantation, and was making the trip on
the Kenilworth for his health.
The Alaska Packers' Association
steamer President, which arrived from
Nushagak Hay yesterday, brings the news
of the drowning of three fishermen.
Hugo Aklquist and Hans Anderson went
out rishlng In a small boat. During the
night It began to blow and the little boat
was driven on a quicksand spit and cap
sized. Next day the men were missed,
and a search party was organized.
Charles Olsen, mate of the schooner
North Bend, and Captain Parker of the
ship Oriental, went out along with the
party, and both of them were capsized
out of their Bkin boats. Mate Olsen was
drowned, but Captain Parker was res
cued. All three bodies were recovered
during the day and were buried at Nush-
agag.
While the President was lying at
Nushagak the river steamers Viva
and Victorian, bound for the Yukon,
put in for coal. Captain Yorke (broth
er of the Rev. Father Yorke) and
Captain P. Lewis, masters of the two
vessels, went in a small boat to the
President. On their way back the frail
craft capsized, and had it not been for
.the prompt manner in which the Presi
dent's crew got out a boat, both of them
would have been drowned. Captain Yorke
was completely exhausted when taken
out of the water, and it was several days
before he recovered from the effects of
his immersion.
The Viva was two months out from the
Sound, and her crew was surprised to
hear of the war with Spain. A steam
schooner undertook to tow the Viva and
another river steamer to St. Michael. The
Job was too much for the steam schoon
er, so the Viva was cut adrift and told
to shift for herself.
The steamer Westport got In from Bear
Harbor yesterday with her flags at half
mast. The vessel arrived at Bear Har
bor on September 5 at 7 a. m. Charles
Smith, the second mate, got into the boat
to run a line to the wharf. There was a
heavy swell at the time and the boat cap
sized. Smith made a bold struggle for his
life but went down before assistance
reached him. His body was not recov
ered and the chances are that the under
tow took it out to sea.
The British tramp steamer Condor has
been chartered by the United States Gov
ernment to carry supplies to the soldier
boys at Manila. She is being loaded with
provisions at Lombard street wharf and
will get away early next week.
The United States steamer Albatross re
turned from Aeapulco yesterday. Bhe
went to the Central American port to look
out for Uncle Sam's Interests during the
revolution In Guatemala, but the fighting
was all over when she got there.
The party of gold hunters that came
here from New York on the bark Agate
are not going direct to the Klondike. As
soon as the vessel is provisioned they will
sail for Cooks Inlet a.n<l will thoroughly
prospect that part of the country before
heading for Dawson. After landing her
passengers at Cooks Inlet the Agate will
be brought back to San Francisco and will
go into the coasting trade.
Captain Charles Rock of the bark Rode
rick Dhu has decided to retire from the
sea and turn fanner. For nearly 50 years
he lias been a sailor and for 29 years has
sailed in and out of the Golden Gate as
master of San Francisco owned vessels.
He now thinks he is entitled to a rest
aÂ«hore. Capt&in Rock's first command
was the schooner Edward Lewis, after
which he was master of the Fairy Queen
and the bark Emma Augusta. Then he
built and sailed the schooner Martha W.
Tuft and from her went to the schooner
Premier. Later he was master of the
ships Sumatra and Detroit and then made
one of four who purchased the ship Lev!
G. Burgess. He commanded her for a
time and then purchased into the bark
Harvester. After that he was master of
the steamer Daisy Kimball and bark
Annie Johnson, and three years ago went
Into the fine steel bark Roderick Dhu.
When Captain Rock and others purchased
the Roderick Dhu she was a British ship,
but he changed her rig and put her under
the Hawaiian flag. Although ho has
taken to farming Captain Rock will not
turn his back altogether on the sea as he
still retains his interest in at least a
dozen vet-sels.
Captain Johnson of the bark Santiago
who succeeds Captain Rock on the, Rode
rick Dhu Is one of the ablest of the pres
ent generation of masters. He was form
erly mate of the brig Lurline and then
succeeded Captain Rook as master of the
bark Harvester. From that vessel ho was
promoted to the bark Santiago and next
Saturday will take the Roderick Dhu out
on her voyage to Hilo. The vessel has a
large passenger list .and a full cargo.

THE VEXATIONS OF
LANDLORD COLE
| TROUBLE IN A HOUSE CAUSED
BY SERGEANT WOLFE.
The Officer Is a Nephew of Chief Lees
and Is Therefore Haughty
and Domineering.
â¢A communication to the Board of Police
Commissioners wherein Police Sergeant
R. Wolfe is mentioned in a manner that
is not calculated to inspire confidence in
his ability as a guardian of the peace
was promptly referred by the Commis
sioners to Chief Lees, and by the latter
functionary' promptly transferred to his
nephew, the aforesaid Sergeant Wolfe.
From all accounts Wolfe is clearly of
the opinion that this is the proper sea
son to howl, and the place to do the
howling Is at the door of W. A. Cole.
The sergeant occupies rooms in the house
at 730 O' Fan-ell street. Cole leased the
premises from Madison & Burtce and
sought to keep an orderly lodging-house.
He fancied that his purpose in this re
spect could be easier of accomplishment
if Wolfe would betake himself to other
lodgings. A notice was therefore served
on the sergeant which might be fairly
translated to mean that Wolfe's room
was better than his company. The fric
tion between Wolfe and his landlord was
caused in a measure by lodging-house
gossip in which several parties partici
pated. Wolfe treated the notice to leave
with lofty scorn, and threatened to "mix
things" with Cole if the attempt to force
him out was not abandoned. Cole re
sponded with a threat to call the patrol
wagon and have Wolfe run in as a dis
turber of the peace. This enraged the
sergeant, who asserted that no patrol
wagon would ever leave the station on
orders other than those issued by him
self. The row now began to take on beau
tiful proportions.
Some school-teachers living in the house
sided with the police. Dr. Kuhlman, living
on Jones street, who had rendered on
August 22 a bill of $10 against Cole for
Erofessional services, intervened uy
ringing suit to recover $2^9 from Cole.
Somehow the City Hall gang always
stands in, and Cole soon found all tne
money due him tied up by garnlshee,
growing out of the account for Kuhlman's
professional services. Cole had to pet
Attorney John Durst to come to his res
cue. To-day the lawyer will submit the
facts to Justice Kerrigan. Cole mean
while raised the money to pay another
month's rent in advance, and so holds the
fort at 730 O'Farrell street, but the fort
still holds Wolfe.
What the outcome of the contest will be
no one can foretell. Cole has everything
that he possesses tied up in the fortunes
of the house. He could live in peace here
after as he did before he met Wolfe if
the latter and his sympathizers would en
gage accommodations elsewhere. Cole
represents to Messrs. Alvord, Tobin and
Gunst. the Honorable Police Commission
ers, that Wolfe is a bad man, but the
Commissioners do nothing but refer the
matter to Chief Lees, who is Wolfe's
uncle, and Lees in turn asks Wolfe to In
vestigate himself.
Cole is a graduate of the University of
California, Several of his classmates hold
high official positions. He is a chemist
and electrician, whose services have been
sought by prominent firms in* San Fran
cisco. He is commended as a man of
high character for integrity and industry.
The indications are that his friends will
rally and present a force sufficient to cope
with the bulldozing tactics of the ruuianly
police and the City Hall gang.
FOR FREEDOM AND ROSETTE.

The championship stake, according to
Announcer Hathon, will not be run until
Saturday, but as the dogs en
tered are of high-class breeding the pa
trons of the grand old sport may certain
ly count upon seeing particularly fine
coursing. The great dog, For Freedom
will meet on this occasion the speedy lit
tle flyer. Rosette, and among leashmen
are many who will play the short end. as
Rosette is running well In form and may
possibly bowl over the kingpin of the
coursing field. Judge Bull will be In the
saddle and ready to pass Judgment on
the first brace of dogs on the arrival of
the first train from the city.
Estates in Probate.
William Scott, who died on August 2f,
1896, left an $8000 estate to his wife, Hesaie
McKean Scott.
The estate of Henry Hofman, who died
on the 30th ult., Is by the terms of his
will to be distributed between his broth
ers, nieces, cousins and certain benevolent
associations. It Is estimated that the es
tate Is worth over $10,000.
A RETURN TO THE
ROMANCE OF YOUTH
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY LIKE
UNTO THE ORIGINAL.
The Macdonalds of Aptos Come Here
in Teams to Celebrate Their
Silver Wedding.
The register of the Occidental Hotel
was filled yesterday with names of parties
who reside In Aptos. They are P. C. W.
Macdonald, F. L. W. Macdonald, C. W.
Macdonald, W. W. Macdonald, the Misses
Wageneaar and Scherder, A. Van Tiernan
Jansen, H. Van Tiernan Jansen and T.
Van Tiernan Jansen. Back of this visit
to the city is a story running through
twenty-five years and which discloses a
bit of romance.
Twenty-five years ago P. C. "W. Mac
donald, then a young man of good busi
ness prospects, courted one of Santa
Rosa's most beautiful daughters, and
success favored his efforts. The young
couple, with the wedding party, came to
San Francisco In teams and were mar
ried in the Occidental Hotel. The wed
ding was as picturesque as orange blos
soms, a romantic attachment and enthu
siastic friends could make It.
After the honeymoon Mr. and Mrs. Mac
donald returned to Santa Rosa. They
did not remain in Sonoma County for any
length of time, but went to other portions
Of the State, where the even tenor of
their married li f o continued to run Its
unobstructed course. Just two decades
and a half have gone by, and despite thu
rubs and sand-papering that the early ro
mance has been subjected to, the Macdon
alds have returned to the day when they
stood under the marriage bell in the Occi
dental Hotel.
The string of names written yesterday
morning on the Occidental Hotel register
indicate a family history. To return to
the days of yore the trip from Aptos,
Monterey County, was made in teams.
Upon their arrival here Major Hooper of
the Occidental Hotel hunted up his old
registers and discovered what room was
used by the Macdonalds when they were
married. The same room, decorated as it
was twenty-five years ago, will see the
silver wedding ceremonies, but there will
be more MaedonnWs and others of the
same blood taking part in this anniver
sary. It is a happy family reunion.
IN A PADDED CELL
WITH HER BIRDS
MISS HARRIET BATES A VICTIM
TO HALLUCINATIONS.
She Came Here From Boston Re
cently to Do Missionary Work
for the Methodist Church.
Harriet Bates, a lady-like little woman,
Is in a padded cell in the Receiving Hos
pital of her own volition, but she is sorry
now that she placed herself In such a po
sition, and would like to be released.
She has nine birds in a cage in her cell
to *eep her company, all being canaries
except one, which she calls a red bird, and
which seems to be her favorite. The birds
have been her companions all over the
continent since she left her home in Bos
ton to do mlssionery work for the Method
ist church.
She arrived here two or three weeks
ago and introduced herself to Rev. Dr.
Wilson of the Howard Street Methodist
Episcopal Church. She informed him of
her wish to do missionary work in the
city, but as she was without funds she
would require pecuniary assistance. She
had borrowed $10*) on four lots she owned
near Boston before leaving on her travels,
but it was all spent.
There was something in her manner that
puzzled the clergyman, and on question
ing her he discovered that she was haunt
ed by the idea that she was being pursued
by enemies who sought her life. He in
duced her to see a physician, but as she
could not get any satisfaction from him
she called at the Insane ward of the hos
pital Tuesday and told Dr. "Wadsworth
that she wanted him to find out If she was
suffering from hallucinations. The doc
tor thought it advisable to lock her up,
and yesterday morning she was taken be
fore the Insanity Commissioners and the
case was continued till to-day.
Miss Bates has been living at 638 Folsom
street, and at her earnest request her
birds were brought from there to her cell
in the hospital yesterday morning. She
converses with them as if they were hu
man beings and seems bright and cheer
ful except for the fear of being separated
from her pets.
WILL SUCCEED DR. MORSE.
Dr. F. Fehleisen Chosen Chief Sur-
geon of German Hospital.
At a special meeting held Tuesday
evening tthe directorate of the German
General Benevolent Society unanimously
elected Dr. F. Fehleisen chief surgeon of
the German Hospital, to succeed the late
Dr. J. F. Morse.
Since his arrival in San Francisco Dr.
Fehloisen has been connected with the
Waldpck Sanitarium, and has gained the
reputation of being an eminent and a
successful surgeon. He was the most
prominent pupil of the world-renowned
surgeon. Professor yon Bergmann of Ber
lin. Acting for many years as his first
assistant, he had during the frequent ab
sence of Dr. Bergmann full charge of his
clinic, famous all over Europe. A reso
lution of appreciation and thanks was
voted to Dr. Paolo de Vecchi, the con
sulting surgeon of the German Hospital,
for his valuable services in taking charge
of the department of the late Dr. J. p.
Morse, during the latter's illness and
since his death.
"Heartsease" on Saturday.
Although a special matinee performance
of "Heartsease" was given by Henry Mil
ler and his company at the Baldwin
Theater yesterday afternoon, there has
not been a ptop In the demand for the
play. It will therefore be repeated again
next Saturday night. The play will not
be given any other night, as "A Marriage
of Convenience" Is to hold the boards to
night, Friday and Saturday afternoon.
Has Not Slept for Five Years.
It Is reported that a man in Indiana has not
had an hour's sleep for five years. He con
stantly walks about, unable to rest, and is
now little more than a skeleton. There are
thousands of men and women who are unable
to sleep more than an hour or two a night
because of nervousness, weakness, dyspepsia,
headache and constipation. A certain remedy
for these disorders is Haotetter's Stomach Bit
ters. All druggists sell it.
URGED TO DEATH
BY HIS BLINDNESS
NICHOLSON SHOOTS HIMSELF
WHILE DESPONDENT.
Sent a Bullet Through His Body in
Alta Plaza â Not Expected
to Recover.
Thomas Nicholson, a young man, whose
residence is in Vallejo, was found at an
early hour this morning in Alta Plaza,
Clay and Steiner streets, suffering from a
gunshot wound, self-inflicted.
Officer Davis was attracted by the shot
and had the wounded man removed to the
Receiving, Hospital, where he was, attend
ed by Dr. Bunnell. The bullet entered
just above the heart and passed, through
the body.
Nicholson was 23 years of age.' He has
been blind for four years. The affliction
was brought on by an accident in which
he was struck by a telephone wire. His
uncle resides in Vallejo. Despondency,
brought on by physical ailment, was the
moving cause of his action.

New Plans for the Home of ths
Feeble-Minded.

tees present, F. P. Woodward, chairman;
R. R. Riebenstein, F. W. G. Moebus and
Dr. A. E. Osborn, the superintendent of
the institution.
It was decided to ask for bids, plans and
specifications for changing the heating ap
paratus of the buildings ' from hot water

draw up plans for two cottages for tho
accommodation of thirty inmates each.
T- c main buildings - are all overcrowded
and the applications for admission are
coming in fast. .. â¢ . â -â¢â 
The coming Legislature will be asked
to make provision for the reception and
treatment of all epileptic patients at the
home. It is the plan to have an epileptic
colony established at Eldridge. Cottages
will be built to accommodate twenty-five
or thirty patients. This, if accomplished,
will be the only institution of its kind in
America. ' â¢
The Code Commissioners' will embody
in their revision of the codes a section
changing the name of the home to that of
an Institution for the Feeble Minded.

THE OUTLOOK IX WALL STREET.
The Market Apparently Shaping For a Broader
Movement.
The circular of Henry Clewes, under data of
New York. September t. says: "It has been
an off week on the Stock Exchange. Many
operators and big leaders are away, the last
week of August being the height of the holiday
season, and their return does not begin until
after Labor day. The hot spell was also an
added cause of inactivity. As for the general
market it showed little change. At times prices
displayed a little irregularity under fresh real
izing and renewed bear attacks; but the un
dertone of the market remained strong and no
Iresh sources of weakness were developed. .
"Much more importance was attached to the
prospects of tight money than the situation
warranted. Both lenders and operators for a
decline In stocks would like to see a mote strin
gent money market, but they are likely to be
disappointed. A slight hardening of rates re
sulting from a better Inquiry for crop and busi
ness needs is possible; but this is all unless
manipulation Is attempted, and that seems un
likely in the present monetary situation. Eu
rope is still a heavy debtor to the United
States,, and American funds have been loaning
In Europe in large sums for months. Foreign
exchange is already weakening and gold im
ports have commenced; so that any decided
etlffenlnp of money rates here will quickly
bring a Hood of gold Into the country and pre
vent any Important advance. The West Is al
ready well provided with funds, and the crop
movement Is not likely to make any serious de
mands upon New York. Altogether, therefore,
there is no cause for concern about the local
money market. A slight rise in rates Is all that
Is probable.
"The railroad situation is promising In every
respect except the senseless cutting of rates
among some of the Grangers, which stockhold
ers whose properties are suffering ought to use
their influence toward ending. The best divi
dend payers have reached very high figures,
and they are likely to remain there and possi
bly many of them may rise still higher so long
as the difficulty of finding profitable Invest
ment for money remains. The possibility of In
creasing dividends and the fact that thus far
speculation in such stocks has been of the most
conservative Fort are likely to make these
shares the favorites on the Stock Exchange for
pome time to come. For many of the low- I
priced Investments there Is of course an excel
lent speeculative future, owing to increased
earnings and the Improved prospects for a re
turn on the Investments. The Industrials offer
still larger opportunities for profit, as business
Improvement Is likely to earn dividends In
many cases where none was expected a few
months ago, and Increases on old rates as well
"The market as a whole is shaping for a
broader and more active movement."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 7.â The bears got the
upper hand very decisively In the stock market
to-day and precipitated a more active selling
movement than has yet occurred. There was
speculative liquidation during the afternoon on
a very large scale, and offerings of long stocks
In some properties which had elements of
weakness were material factors in the de
cline. Sugar occupied the center of the stage
all day. It was evident before the market
opened that the bears had marked it for their
own, and everything that could be done in thÂ»
â way of discouraging reports of the company's
business and disastrous competition in prospect j
â was done through the medium of Inspired pub- j
lications. The movement was opportune, as !
the recent bull movement in the stock was :
accompanied by rumors of an Increase. In the
dividend, and the declaration to-day of only
the. usual dividend brougK heavy selling from
disappointed holders. Torrents of stock were i
dislodged on the decline, and all the usual
devices were employed to give an appearance
of Inside selling. The final rally in the stock i
â¢was only feeble, the last price being 5% per
cent below last night's closing. The demoral
ization in Sugar affected the whole list, but
especially the industrials. The Pacific stocks
were conspicuously weak on reallzlnz- In con
nection with the announced determination of
Canadian Pacific officials to accept â  the decis
ion of the Interstate Commerce Commission
against the differential In their favor In freight
rates.
Demand sterling fell further to-day to $1 85%
and gold Is expected to come this week, a
Email consignment belnz announced after the
close of the market to-day. â¢
Bonds were dealt in on a fairly large scale i
and prices yielded slightly in the later deal- '
ings. Total sales. $3,735,000. United States 3s. i
when issued, advanced 4 per cent in the bid
price. Government bonds were otherwise un
changed.

defined. It is believed, however, that the reac
tion will be only temporary, the undertone be
ing decidedly firm. Grand Trunks and Cana
dian Pacific rose sharply on a reported settle
ment of the rate war. although It is understood
here that only an adjustment of local rates on
the two systems has been arranged.
Americans suffered through realUings dur
ing the early hours, but the close was firm and
again St. Paul was especially strong. New
York Is still buying gold, bidding It up to 77s

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. .7.â Liverpool cables were
rather disappointing ' and that, together with
the weakness displayed .by corn, . started wheat
lower. ' The receipts In the northwest were
smaller and â¢ the markets in that quarter
were firmer. This resulted In a gradual change
of sentiment here and there was some buying
for . the long " account which finally : started
i shorts covering and materially helped the price.
! The feeling among the bulls generally was that'
the -market had had nearly everything against
I it i of , late, and yet had been so stubborn as to
I Indicate that it possessed a good deal of in
| herent strength. They argued that prices were
' more .likely to rally than to meet with further
i loss and, for that reason traders as a rule took
; .the long side. Advices from Minneapolis said
I the movement there for the next three months
I would be -on an Increased scale. - That, in ad
â  dition' to the declining corn market, resulted
i In cooling the ardor of the bulls and under real
izing and short selling the price gradually de
clined until the early gain was more than lost.
The market closed near the low point for the
day. There was very little demand for ship
ping parcels here, and such bids as came to
hand were at reductions and unworkable. Sep
tember closed %c lower and December lost 4

The failure of anything like damaging frosts
to make an .appearance in the corn belt last

DIRECTORS
ARE ANGRY
Denounce Statements of
Mr. Cuvellier.
MRS. KNOX TO LOOK ON
BAYS THE TEN MEN ON THE
BOABD MUST ACT.
Councilman Girard Thinks That a
Change in the School 'System
Is Perhaps De
sirable.
Oakland Offire San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 7.
The statement of Councilman Cuvellier
read by himself to the Board of Educa
tion last night has created intense in
terest. Coming at this particular time Mr.
Cuvellier's attack on the methods of the
school board may be said to be timely, for
the department estimates asking for large
Bums of money are already in the hands
of the Council, which body must fix a tax
levy before October 1.
Again, next spring a new board of Edu
cation .will have to be elected, and if af
ter the public interest has been aroused It
should be found that some changes are
necessary, the polls will be the , proper
place to testify to such desire on the part
of parents and taxpayers.
Meanwhile the members of the Board of
Education are roundly denouncing Mr.
Cuvellier's statement as outrageous false
hoods, although some give him ci^dit for
a conscientious desire to do sometmng for
the benefit of all, while declaring at the
same time that he got off on the wrong
track. Dr. Myra Knox says this Is., a
man's fight and" she is going to let them
fight It out. â¢â â 
"There are ten - men directors on the
board," she said, "to one woman, and I
am going to keep out of it. Even if Mr.
Cuvellier's charges â  be true, they should
not be charged -to the Board of
Education. The school course is pre-
Bcribed by the State and the Board of
Education cannot alter It. ' We make our
demand every year for such an amount of I
money as we think we require, and the
Council cuts us down, leaving too many
scholars to each teacher." â !
Councilman 'Girard. who is an ex-mem
ber of the Board of Education, says there
are only eight children out of every 100
who go to the University from the High i
School course.
"Now, what is the use of keeping up a
standard so. high when so few avail
themselves of it?" he asked to-day. "The
course is too high altogether. There are
too many things in It that ought to be
left out. The . public schools were intend
ed to give children a common education,
and those who want more . than that
ought to pay for.it." â¢â¢
Dr. J. Hamilton Todd, a School Direc
tor, defends Superintendent- McClymonds
against Mr. Cuvellier's charges of dicta
torship and hypnotism, and says that his
statements are not fair. Dr. Todd says
that it is preposterous thÂ§.t Mr. Cuvellier
should promulgate such a mass of mis-
Information.
Principal J. B. McChesney, who has
been at the head of the High School for
nearly a generation, credits Mr. Cuvel
lier with being prompted by a right mo
tive, but being led away from his origi
nal intention. -a â .;>-. â  .â¢â¢
'â¢The course of study was prepared af
ter long consideration," said - Principal
â McChesney. "The aim â¢ was to get as j
rroqd. Â»v course as we could, and we did it.
We' cannot" get perfect things with im
perfect tools, and Mr. Cuvellier does not
understand the situation properly."
Superintendent McClymonds- has filed
a report with the Board of Education,
showing in detail : the course of study
that is now pursued. It is in part an an
swer to the statements of Mr. Cuvellier.
Several professors at the- University, of
California were seen to-day and asked for
their opinion as to the students who
come to Berkeley from the Oakland and
San Francisco high schools.' They were
unanimous in saying that these two pre
paratory, schools sent out the- best mate
rial which the college has. ' . â -"â  .
Professor- Frank Soule of the depart
ment of mining- and civil engineering
thought that Mr. Cuvellier's charges were
altogether, unjustifiable. "The students
that; wo .get from Oakland and
Pan Francisco." he declared, "compare
favorably with those that come from
other parts of the State. I know of no in
stance- where their scholarship or stand
ing has fallen so low as to be a subject
of remark. On the contrary, .-.their work
is. In my; opinion, unusually : good, and it
is in no way subject to- such criticism as
.seems to have been made. I' feel' sure that
any one who" would start such a" report as
that must, have, been' prejudiced:"' .
â¢â¢ Professor Elmer J. Brown, head of the
department of- pedagogy and one of the
leading authorities on school systems,
â¢aid: "So far. as my experience goes I
should think that the Oakland school sys
tem compares well with any other in the
State. â¢ Just at present I have no statis
' tics to appeal to. but my impression Is, as
. I have said, that on the average-Its rank
Is high. Of course it has faults, but not
such , as are peculiar to tho Oakland
schools in themselves. I believe they are
Improving rapidly. The new course of
study recently adopted is certainly an Im
provement, I know of nothing as far as
the grammar school system goes, which
Is open to such rash and wholesale criti
cism as seems to have been made T>efon>
the meeting of the Oakland Board of Ed
ucation last night." ' â¢ -â 
The professors- in tho â¢ English depart
ment spoke in high praise ox the Oakland
and San Francisco students. "They are,"
feald Professor Bradley, "the best rounded
out material. that we have.: They. are cer
tainly the most thoroughly prepared -for
â¢university training, and I think that the
schools themselves are . improving rap
idly."- " : '
Professor Thomas R. Bacon of the de
partment of history and political science
was. much surprised that any such charge
could have been made. "I am certainly
astonished that a statement of that kind
could have been made about the Oakland
and ' San Francisco schools," he said.
"The students that they send here 'are
among the best we have." ~ â  .:-
OAKLAND COUNCILMEN
FIX THE TAX LEVY
THEY PROVIDE FOR A LARGE
INCREASE.
In the First Night's Work Auditor
Snow's Figures Are Exceeded
by $50,000.
OAKLAND, Sept. 7.â The City Council
met to-night to toko up the matter of fix-
Ing the tax levy, which must be complet
ed by September 20. and finally adopted
and approved by the Mayor before the
first Monday In October. City Auditor
Snow was asked by Mr. Prlnglo if he
eou.d not cut $GOO oft* his asslÃtant's ac
count, and Mr. Snow replied that he had
not Increased the expenses of his office
Ht all since 1889, although the work has
Increased 40 per cent. Every other de
partment, he Baid, had increased largely.
Some objection was made to sponding
$000 for water for the City Hall. Pringle
proposed that it be cut to $250, and Audi
tor Snow took the Council's breath away
by stating that $350 had already been
Bpent. It was decided to put $3000 in the
fund for a police and fire alarm for the
annexed district as soojr as thfd suit de
termining its legality is decided. A dis
tuspion took place as to the fund for feed
for the fire department. Last year the
contract was let at $9 20, this year it is
$26 40. Chairman Heitman said that the
city could buy its horse feed in the open
market and the contract could not re
strain it. By this means many thou
sands of dollars could be saved this year.
Mr. Cuvellicr made the statement that
there is an engine in West Oakland which
Is a menace to the life of the men every
time they take it out. Chief Ball said It
was true. It was decided not to allow
the Mayor an urgent necessity fund of
$500, but to allow it to the Chief of Po
lice. The sum of $38,500 was added to the
sewer fund for the proposed improve
ments to the sewers on each side of Lake
Merritt. By the first night's work on the
tax levy the Council increased the Audi
tor's figures $50,000, in the face of Mr.
Snow's statement that he had allowed

SAYS HIS BOOKS ABE OPEN.
Street Superintendent Miller end
Oakland's Auditor Have a lilt.
OAKLAND, Sept. 7.â There was a little
tilt at the meeting of the Board of Works
this morning. City Auditor Snow stated
that he had been criticized for pasing
bills for work ordered by the board,
amounting to more than $200 and not done
by contract as the charter provides. He
also called attention to the bills for street
work, which were sent to him from the
Street Superintendent's office, which did
not show what resolution authorized such
work. He suggested the board rescind all
resolutions authorizing the Street Super
intendent to employ men and beginning
anew adopt resolutions for each piece of
work as it came .up. He said also that if
improvements went on at the present rate
there would be no money in the treasury
by April 1. and went so far as to intimate
that the bills and time book of the Super
intendent had been twi9ted to give em
ployment to favored ones.
Superintendent Miller promptly replied
that his books were always open for in
spection, and that he knew of no irregu
larities.
Considerable discussion followed, Miller
finally stating that If Snow would show
him how he wanted the bills made out he
would follow his suggestions.

MOTHER AND CHILD
MUST SEPARATE
DAISY DAY'S ONLY HOPE IS TO
BE TAKEN AWAY.
Mrs. Bay Grows Worse and Is Threat
ened With. Death From
Starvation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 7.
The officials of the County Infirmary
have reached the conclusion that if the
mind of Miss Daisy Day is to be saved
she must be separated from her mother.
As the young lady will not leave her pa
rent for an Instant, and as the mother
believes that her daughter Is the only one
who can save her from destruction, the
task before the Commissioners is a deli
cate and difficult one.
Mrs. Bandy, the matron of the infirm
ary, says that since Mrs. Day was taken
there a week ago she has refused to
touch a crumb of food and is actually
dying of starvation. The matron sees no
hope for the mother, but declares that
the girl is curable. Some new informa
tion relative to the mother has recently
come to light which adds to the necessity
for separating her from her daughter.
Mrs. Day has threatened to commit sui
cide, and several times before being ar
rested for Insanity she went daily to a
grocery store and stood on the scales to
Bee if she were disappearing from this
world.
The mother has also expressed a strong
attachment for her sister's stepson, a
young man not much OiUer than her
daughter. She was very anxious to
marry him and tried to persuade her sis
ter not to oppose the match.
Both the mother's and daughter's minds
are steadily becoming worse, and if some
thing be not done with Mrs. Day at once
Bhe will starve to death. A medical com
mission will examine both ladies to-mor-
row.

Cross Bociety this morning made an ap
peal for eggs and delicacies for the sick
soldiers at Camp Barrett.
The water froi:t case was resumed be
fore Judge Osrden this morning and con
siderable testimony was adduced relative
to the dedication of streets at the water
front. The trial has now gone over until
the 20th.
When she began this labor she was in
robust health. After a few months had
passed Mary developed a hacking cough
but still she clung to her duties in the
ward, neglecting the warning. Strange
ly enough the physicians in the hospital
allowed her to continue to minister to
sufferers from lung disease and the
germs of tuberculosis gained a fatal hold
upon her system. Finally the day came
not long ago when she herself became a
hopeless patient, suffering from the dis
ease. On September 2 the spirit of the
nurse departed.
The young heroine was quietly buried
from the family residence, 936 Church
street, on Monday. The only written rec
ord of her life work is the death certifi
cate filled out by Dr. M. O. Austin and
filed with the statistician: "Death from
tuberculosis, contracted in the City and
County Hospital."
She died In the performance of duty
not as brave men have recently died
amid the excitement of battle but as
many brave women die every year
quietly fighting Death at the bedsides of
the sick.

OAKLAND, Sept 7.â The joint commit
tee from the Board of Trade and Mer
chants' Exchange appointed several
months ago in the interest of bringing
about a consolidation of the city and
county government met this morning.
Mr. Naismlth reminded the comlnlttee
that the old law providing for the forma
tion of a city and county government had
been repealed, and the committee then
discussed what step should be taken next.
Mr. Naismlth suggested that informal
meetings be held in Fruitvale, Berkeley
and Emeryville to discuss consolidation;
then, too, the committee should first find
out what is necessary to organize such a
government: and the committee should
secure pledges from the Alameda repre
sentatives in regard to the passage of the
necessary legislation. This met favor
with the other members and legal advisers
are to be consulted.

and Mrs. John Kelsey, giving practically
a history of the church and biography of
those who were instrumental In founding
and permanently establishing the Presby

ry L. Kingmade a brief address with a vein
of rich humor interwoven; Mr. W. F. Cur
tis delivered an impressive address In
merrioriam and Rev. Dr. Coyle spoke also.
These various parts were interspersed with
musical selections of a vocal character

members and which can now boast of a

STRIKES AT
CHINESE FRAUD
Shew Hon, Conspirator,
Held to Answer.
TRIES TO LAND IMMIGRANTS
COMMISSIONER HEACOCK'SFIRM
STAND.
A Crime to Attempt the Landing of
Mongolians, Even Though
It Proves a
Failure.
United States Commissioner Heacock
rendered a derision yesterday which will
'cause consternation among the men
.of the Highbinder's Bureau, which
; lt Is alleged has been landing
'Chinese In larpe numbers by means
of perjury and conspiracy. The
Commissioner decided that It was a crime
to aid and abet the landing of a Chinese
Illegally and that, though the attempt
/ailed, the crime had been committed and
was punishable.
The decision was rendered In the case
of the United .States vs. Shew Hon. ar
rested by Inspector John Lynch and Dr.
Gardner, while convoying to a Chinese lm
â  migrant letters of Instruction, copies of
which were published in The Call last
Baturday.
The defense was conducted by Thomas
T). Kiordan, whose partner, John J.
Quinn, has been so familiar a figure
around the Chinese Bureau that strangers
mistook him for a member of the bureau.
I\i r. Riordan raised the point that the at
tempt to land the Chinese to whom tho
letters were addressed had failed and
that, therefore, no offense had been com
mitted.
Judge Heacock, in setting aside Mr.
Riordan's contention, quoted from the
statute which provides that any person
v.ho shall knowingly aid or abet the land-
Ing In the United States from any vessel
of any Chinese person not lawfully entitl
ed to enter the country is guilty of a
misdemeanor. He then held that Shew
knew that ho was engaged in an unlawful
attempt because he ran away from Mr.
Jj.vnch and tried to destroy one of the
letters when he faw that Dr. Gardner
was about to road it. The fact that the
attempt to land the Chinese failed did
r.ot relieve the prisoner from the respon
sibility of his attempt.
United States Attorney Foote gave an
opinion to the Commissioner, at his re
quest, which opinion will carry comfort
to the hearts of tho highbinders. It was
based upon thr> fact that section 2 of tho
statute says that the master of any ves
sel who shall knowingly bring to land or
attempt tv Ipihl any Chino.se not legally
entitled to enter shall be guilty of a mln
(icmeanor. Mr. Foote pointed out that in
the section under which ho had brought
the prosecution of Shew Hon the words
"attempt to land" did not appear, and
that there was a question whether their
absence should not be taken as Inten
tional on the part of the lawmakers.
After the prisoner had been held to an
swer Judge Seacock said that false
swearing before the Collector of the Port
or the Chinese Bureau was punishable
Tinder the same section under which Shew
Hon had been held to answer.
Collector Jackson expressed the opinion
on the day before that there was no law
by which the Chinese perjurers could be
punished for perjury. Judge Heacock's
decision furnishes the law by which the
Mongolian scoundrels and their white
parasites can be brought to justice. It is
expected that the arrest of Chan Tai
Tsung of Ham Hop & Co., 901 Dupont
street, will follow. He Is tho writer of
tho letters found on Shew Hon. Chief
Meredith may bring him Into court.

JORDAN'S THEORY EXPLODED.
Rapid Growth of Salmon Proved by an Identi
fying Mark.
The recent capture of a full-grown twenty-four-pound naJmon In the
Sacramento River has exploded the theories of Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Oavid
Starr Jordan, the scientists, who are rated as authorities on fish ques-
These learned gentlemen have asserted that it takes three or four
years for the Pacific Coast salmon to attain its growth in the deep waters
of the ocean. In the spring of 1897 several thousand salmon fry were liber
ated in the waters of the Columbia River at the United States Fish
Commission hatchery, Clackiimas. In order that these fish might be Iden
tified when they should again ascend the rivers their adipose fins were re
moved. Circulars were sent out asking that the capture of any of the flÃh
be reported to the commission with full particulars as to weight and size,
the commission desiring to loam the time that young salmon spend In
the ocean, progress in the matter of growth and other interesting points
This year a few of the little fellows, somewhat Improved as to size,
were caught in the Columbia River, but none weig .ed over eight pounds'
J. P. Halkr. manager of the Sacramento River Packers 1 Association of
fered one dollar for every salmon caught bearing the Fish Commissioners'
Identifying mark. The other day the salmon mentioned in the foregoing
was landed in a fisherman's net. It weighed twenty-four pounds and was
thirty-six inches in length, heating Its fellows by many pounds and inches
So important do the State Fish Commissioners regard the cap-ure that
they will send the marked part of the lish to the Commissioners at Wash
ington.

Welcome Her Visitors â Three
Days of Unalloyed
Pleasure.
Native Sonsâ and Daughtersâ will own
the town for <a time this evening, prior to
their descent upon San Jose for their an
nual celebration of Admission Day. The
twenty-two parlors in this city will give
the people a slight Intimation of what the
grand procession in the Garden City to
morrow will be by marching from their
hall on Mason street to the Third and
Townsend street depot, where they will
board a special train for the scene of
their festivities.
As the ladies will not participate in to
night's demonstration, and the hand
some banners of the various parlors hav
ing already been sent down to San Jose,
to-night's parade will lack many of the
features that will add to the beauty of
the spectacle to-morrow, but there will
be plenty of red lire, Roman candles,
skyrockets and enthusiasm to offset
â what it lacks in numbers and other fea
tures. There having been several changes

lished in The Call, the make-up of to
night's procession is herewith reprinted.

HÂ§iWJ SORE
Raw Sore From Finger to Palm.
Physicians and Medicines No
Avail. Cured by Cuticura.
"When my little boy was two years of age,
dry spots commenced to appear on different
parts of his body. Last winter it seemed to go
to bis hands, and I was obliged to keep his
first three fingers done up ail the time, as it
was a raw sore, beginning to extend down to-
ward the palm of the hand. We consulted three
different physicians, each a certain length of
time, to see a benefit of their medicines. I
think now, after using Cuticura, that some
of the salves that I used did more injury than
good. A gentleman (who sat next to me In
church) asked me the matter with my boy's
band. I took off one of the cloths and showed
him, he told me be had been in a hospital in

THE IRISH FAIR.
Popular Interest Is Shown ly a
Large Throng at the Pavilion.
The attractions of the Irish Fair are
not diminishing, though the exposition is
drawing to a close. Popular Interest was
manifested by a large throng of attend
ants at the Pavilion last night. The
"spielers" were in good form and herald
ed the special features of the occasion In
a style that caught the fancy of visitors,
and brought many dimes to the box office
of each particular side show. Blarney
Castle's prestige as a popular resort was
attested l>y a line of visitors at its gates
from early In the evening until the closing
hour of the fair. The Art Gallery Theater
gave a good bill last night, but the patrons
of the performance were obliged to wait a
long time for the curtain to ascend. The
waiting hour was employed by many in
viewing the pictures, admiring this sec
tion of the Pavilion.
On thp other side of the Pavilion, the
agrnt of the Rooky Road to Dublin kept
the spectators alive to the merits and at
tractions of the route. The fishing In the
Lake of Klllarney may be good at this
season of the year, but the anglers last
night did not boast of an extra catch.
Verdict for the Railroad.
A Jury in Judge Hunt's court yesterday
rendered a verdict in favor of the Market
Street Railway Company in a suit for
$10,000 damages brought by James A.
Grant. An electric car collided with a
truck on which Grant was riding at the
corner of Broadway and Davis street
several months ago. Grant was thrown
from the seat and badly bruised- The evi
dence showed t.iat the collision was not
due to any negligence on the part of, the
motorman.

Hospital and was attended by Dr. Well.
THE SAX FKA^CISCO CALL, THUBSBAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1898.
EXILED WOMEN
ARE TO HAVE
AN ASYLUM
In the Old Supreme
Court Building.
IS A PHILANTHROPIC SCHEME
IT IS BEING ENGINEERED BY
TWO FRENCHMEN.
A Benefit to the Outcast Women
and an Increase of Rent
for the Property-
Owners.
There Is a movement on foot to gather
together a certain number of the women
who have recently been compelled to va
cate the dens in Morton, Quincy and St.
Mary streets and Berry place and col
onize them In the upper stories of build
mgs_on Merchant street, between Kearny
and' Montgomery, where they will be un
der the protecting shadow of the new
Hall of Justice, which has at last reached
a height that enables it to cast a shadow.
Whether this is a philanthropic move
ment to better the condition, financial and
sanitary, of these unfortunate creatures
or to fatten the purse of the owners of
property that has long since ceased to re
turn a fair income on the investment is a
question that only time can answer.
Recently two Frenchmen called upon
Two Handsome Banners to Grace tfye Saij
Jose Parade.
Landry C. Babln, a real estate agent, and
made a proposition to lease the structure
known as the old Supreme Court build-
Ing, on Merchant street, for the purpose
of converting it into a camp for the re
concentrados from the forbidden terri
tory. This building has for a long time
been almost entirely vacant, the only oc
cupants of the two upper stories at the
present time being Coroner Hawkins and
a shirt manufacturer. There was a time,
however, when offices In that building
commanded a premium, and the income
from the property was equivalent to that
from a good gold mine. The property is
owned by three parties â R. C. de Boom,
Marie de Sleyes and the heirs of Ange
lique de Apolonlere â all of whom no doubt
would be pleased to have it produce a
rental sufficient to pay the taxes and a
fair interest on the valuation. The
Frenchmen have not yet succeeeded in
coming to terms with the owners, but
they stand ready, so it Is claimed, to take
a chance in the venture. They hope to
secure a low rental and by sub-letting It
to the women whom they propose to cor
ral in the building expect to make a hand
some profit. The argument advanced in
favor of this enterprise is that these
women will be thus tumn off the streets.
This building contains thirty-three rooms,
and Mr. Babln, the agent, and Mr. de
Boom, one of the owners, are waiting to
hear from the two philanthropists, who
are probably delaying the consummation
of the transaction until they can ascer
tain whether they can also secure the ad
joining three-story buiWlng on the east,
owned by M. J. Newark.
In case the Newark building can be
leased, It is quite likely that the scheme
will be carried out.
Whether Coroner Hawkins and the lone
shirt manufacturer can be induced to
move from the old Supreme Court build
ing is doubtful, but as they are only ten
ants from month to month they can easily
be ejected after the usual notice is given.
Coroner Hawkins' office is rented by the
Board of Supervisors.
It was rumored that a doctor was inter
ested In the movement, owing to his hav
ing a contract for medical attendance up
on these women, and that he was acting
as a go-between In the matter. When
informed of this rumor last evening the
doctor became Indignant and emphatically
said that anything he had done toward
bringing about this concentration of the
exiled women had been simply in the In
terest of a society for the conservation of
health, of which he and Dr. P. J. Tormey
are the regularly employed physicians.
This society of which Dr. Fitch speaks
was organized two years ago, one of its
principal objects being the establishment
of the system pursued In France. Paul
Ny, a Frenchman by descent, and an em
ploye of the Smith Label Company, is the
president of this society, and is an en
thusiast In regard to its laudable mission.
An attempt on the part of the society
was made to induce the Board of Super
visors to pass a license ordinance, but it
was unsuccessful, as It was found that
such an ordinance would be in conflict
with the State law.
It is understood that Mr. Ny, as presi
dent of the society, is In full sympathy
with the colonization scheme proposed by
the two Frenchmen, on the ground that
the women being thus concentrated will
be more easily subjected to police and
medical control.
THE MINERS' CONVENTION.
It Will Be Held This Year Two
Weeks After Election Day.
The annual State convention of the Cal
ifornia Miners 1 Association will this year
be held on November 21. In San Fran
cisco. This was decided upon at a meet
ing of the executive committee of the as
sociation held at the Union League Club's
rooms last evening. No other buslness
of importance was transacted at the brief
session. Professor S. B. Christy of the
State University, who was one of the Cal
ifornia delegates to the International
Mining Congress at Salt Lake City gave
a talk on the congress, and Chairman
Neff directed that all special commit
tees prepare full reports tor the conven
tion.
FINDS RESTAURANTS
IN BAD CONDITION
INSPECTOR DOCKERY MAKES A
ROUND OF CHEAP ONES.
Gives the Customary Ten Days' No
tice That Kitchens Must Be
Placed in Good Order.
"Many of the restaurants of San Fran
cisco are filthy beyond belief." Such was
the appetite dispelling statement made by
Chief Food Inspector Dockery last even
ing.
"Deputy Lahaney and myself made a
trip of investigation to-day," continued
the Inspector, "and saw much that was
unpleasant. We invaded one restaurant
kitchen after another. While the major
ity were in fairly good condition, there
were many that contained the accumu
lated filth of years.
"For two months past we have investi
gated restaurants. It is our policy not to
announce In advance when and where we
propose to investigate, as such announce
ment defeats our efforts to better the
prevailing conditions."
"My trip among the restaurants to-day
was not fruitless, however, as many pro
prietors had not learned of the proposed
visit. Lahaney and I took the district
south of Market street and east of
Fourth. We entered sixteen restaurants.
The first filthy place that we found was
29 Third street, Frank Wonne Is the pro-
prietor. This establishment is a saloon
with a lunch counter as an attraction. The
kitchen In the rear and two shed rooms
behind were in bad condition. I ordered
the proprietor to clean and thoroughly
purify his establishment within the next
ten days. If he fails I shall close the
place.
"The Transfer Restaurant, 153 Third
street, was the second that needed atten
tion. The proprietors are Schaefels &
Corrodi. The kitchen was filthy, so was
the store-room. I gave orders here to
clean up within ten days.
"The fruit and vegetable store of Bar
bierl & Co., 155 Third street, was in an
â unsavory condition, especially the back
portion. They received the ten days' no
tice to Improve conditions. The restau
rant at 36 and 38 Second street, conducted
by Kroneck & Zehule, was in bad condi
tion. The Sunset Cafe, 108 and 110 Third
street, received ten days' respite, also
the Electric Kitchen, conducted by Car
dini & Solari, at 108 Third street.
"The proprietors of Berlin Restaurant,
249 Fourth street, received orders to
whitewash the kitchen and clean the place
generally. While J was around with my
deputy I had five other men in other sec
tions of the city. They visited eighty-five
restaurants and tamale places and found
four that needed prompt attention. OnÂ©
of these, a tamale kitchen, kept by Mrs.
M. J. Tate, received the ten days of grace
for cleansing purposes. It is' located at
150 Eddy street. The New Orleans Res
taurant, 1203 Polk street, kept by Baddich
& Dumaraz, was in bad order, as was also
that at 206 McAllister street, conducted by
J. P. and J. T. Ennls. In the restaurant
run by Matovich & Kukavinza there was
a similar condition. "We will endeavor to
put the eating places of San Francisco in
better shape before we finish."

A WIFE-BEATER SENTENCED.
James Bonlin, a Stevedore, Gets
Seven Months ip the County â 
Jail.
James Donlin, a stevedore, was yester
day sentenced to seven months In the
County Jail by Judge Mogan on charges
of beating his wife and disturbing the
peace.
On August 28 Donlin went to his home
at 45 Clementina street in an ugly mood
and beat his wife so brutally that she
was confined to her bed for five days. He
was arrested for battery and was released
on bail. He went straight home and
abused his sick wife, which led to his
arrest for disturbing the peace. He got
six months on the battery charge and
one month for disturbing the peace.
Ban Over a Small Boy.
Herbert Seemen, aged 4, living at 45
Crook street, was run over by a truck on
Fourth street yesterday afternoon, and
sustained a fracture of one of his ankles.
The driver did not wait to ascertain how
badly the child was Injured, but drove
on. The police have been unable to iden
tify him.
ANOTHER ACT
OF BROWNE
AND BRUNE
Removed Deeds From
Their Bank.
Â°LACED THERE IN ESCROW
D. P. TARPEY HAS ANOTHER
CHARGE TC MAKE.
This Allegation Will Be Brought Out
in Litigation, Criminal and
Civil, Soon to Be Insti
tuted.
The deeds to valuable real estate in Mex
ico, the property of Edward Byrne, left
in escrow in the Moscow National Bank,
pending the arrival of a transcript of
title, were illegally removed from the
vaults of the institution prior to the ar
rival of the document by present Secret
Service Agent Robert S. Browne, late
president and director of the defunct
Moscow banking institution, or his
brother, Clarence M. "Brune." That the
deeds were left in escrow in the bank
pending the arrival of the transcript is
substantiated by documents in the pos
session of D. P. Tarpey. who has pre
ferred charges against the brothers, and
the fact that the deeds have been remov
ed, coupled with the fact that the trans
cript has not yet arrived, clearly estab
lishes the contention that the accused ex
officials of the bank are guilty of the il
legal act with which they are charged.
The first link in the chain of evidence
which has been welded tending to estab
lish the guilt of the accused brothers is
a letter written by Brune to H. S. Krig
baum, who acted as the agent of Edward
Byrne, dated January 27, 1897. The let
ter was mailed in Moscow, Idaho, and re
fers to the proposed deal between Byrne
and Brune, which was later almost com
pleted.
It stated that Brune had arranged with
the bank, of which he was the cashier, to
take care of the deal, to look over the
abstract of titile upon its arrival and to
care for other contingencies which might
arise. It was necessary, even though the
transaction did not savor of a swindle,
that the deed to the property transferred
by Byrne to Brune should be legalized in
Mexico after the consummation of tne'
deal. The fact that the transaction did
Bavor of a swindle, and in fact bears all
the earmarks of dishonesty, made it im
perative that the deeds be legalized as
soon as possible, that in event the fraud
was discovered and Byrne took steps to
recover the property he would meet with
greater difficulty than if the documents
still remained in the vaults of the Bank
of Moscow. In consequence on February
4, ihree days after the failure of the bank,
Judge Sepulveda, United States Consul at
the City of Mexico, received a telegram
from Brune instructing him to imme
diately record the deeds from Byrne to
Brune and to answer by telegraph.
The deeds in question had not yet ar
rived in Mexico, and indeed it was
thought by Byrne that they still remain
ed within tho vaults of the bank. The
following day, however. Judge Sepulve
da received, in a registered package, the
deed, a check for $16 on a New York
bank to cover expenses of recording, and
a letter instructing the Consul to have
the deed legalized and recorded immedi
ately. The letter inclosed in the registered
package bears the date of January
22, 1597, but the stamp of the United
States Postofflce on the package shows
it to have been postmarked on January
28, showing that the letter must have
been dated back to suit the exigencies
of the occasion. Sepulveda then had the
deed legalized, and on February 6 sent
it by registered mall to George H. Ked
zie. United States Consul at Durango,
with Instructions to register it. On the
same day Consul Sepulveda telegraphed
Brune, "Have sent deed forward to Ked
zie for registration to-day."
These are the facts showing that the
deed was removed from the bank with
out the knowledge of Byrne, and also
that they must have been removed from
the bank either on the day Brune mailed
his communication to Krigbaum, on Jan
uary 27, relating to the proposed deal be
tween Byrne and Brune, or on the fol
lowing day. The registered package was
received by Consul Sepulveda on Febru
;.~v 5, and it takes fully seven or eight
da->a for mail posted at Moscow to ar
rive at the City of Mexico. In event di
rect connection is not made it might take
from nine to ten days for the trip. Con
sidering these facts but one conclusion
can be reached; that the deeds were
taken from the bank and mailed to Mex
ico, and the letter of January 27 was
written for the purpose of allaying any
suspicion that might arise in the mind
of the victim. There was but little fear
that Byrne or his agent would discover
the fraud that was being perpertated
upon them, but as fear and suspicion are
always uppermost in the guilty mind,
Brune probably decided to take no
chances, walked to the vaults of the
bank, removed the deeds, mailed them
and awaited the collapse of the bank,
which he knew was inevitable.
"The wreck of the bank reached our
rars but a few days after the deeds had
been mailed to Mexico," said Mr. Tarpey
yesterday. "Of course, I was astonished
at the sudden failure, but lost but little
time in starting to make investigations.
1 thoroughly verified my suspicions that
fraud was responsible' for the failure of
the institution and a few days ago mailed
my charges to the Secretary of the Treas
ury, in whose department the ex-bank
officials are at present employed. I then
took tho case before the local Government
officials. 1 was in some fear at first that
this matter would not get the investiga
tion it deserves. I first presented the
papers to Postofflce Inspector Munroe, and
osked him if it did not look like a clear
cuse of using the United States mails to
further a scheme to defraud. He looked
the papers over carefully and said that if
all the allegations were true it was a
good case, but it would be necessary to
have it tried in Idaho, as the incriminating
letters were mailed at that place.
"1 told Mr. Munroe that I thought he
was mistaken; that every letter written
In connection with the buying or selling
of the bends was connected with tho
swindle, while the letters themselves
might contain nothing incriminating. He
said tbat he would think the matter over
and see what could be done, as he does
not want any violator of the postal laws
to escape. Of course it was not in hi-?
province to express a direct opinion, hut
he advised me to file the papers in the
Idaho district in case nothing could ba
done with them. ,
"Mr. Munroe Bhowed the papers to In
spector Erwin and District Attorney
Foote, who held a different opinion. They
thought that, as according to the papers,
a swindle had been perpetrated, any let
ter bearing on the case in any way was
incriminating, and as such letters were
mailed in this State the case is within
their Jurisdiction and will be fully invest
gated."
All the papers have been formally turn
ed over to Attorney Foote, who, in turn,
has placed the case in the hands of his
assistant, Bert Schleslnger. Mr. Schles
inger has been so busy with the Clarkson
case for the past few days that he has
not had time to go through the papers
thoroughly, notwithstanding their impor
tance. ______________

JURIST AND
STATESMAN
IN ARGUMENT
Shall We Hold the
Philippines?
SPREAD EAGLE VERSUS FACTS
I
PEEKINS AND BABNES TAKE
OPPOSITE SIDES.
Heated Argument Made by the Noted
Speakers at the Convention
of the Women's Press
Association.
The eighth annual convention of the
Women's Press Association, after a
rather flat, stale and unprofitable session,
closed In a blaze of glory last evening,
with ringing cheers and a magnificent dis
play of verbal pyrotechnics.
Like diplomats, the members of the as
sociation kept their best for the last, and
Senator Perkins and General W. H. L.
Barnes found the audience larger and in
an appreciative mood ready to side with
the more convincing speaker in the ar
gument, "Shall We Hold the Philippines."
Barnes spoke first, inflaming the audi
ence with his running story of patriotism,
his brilliant review of America's recent
and glorious victories and a magnificent
tribute to our sailor and soldier heroes.
Rapidly and succinctly he reviewed the
history of the country, gradually nearing
the present time and tracing en route the
story of the great acquisitions.
He dwelt upon the opposition with
which territorial acquisition had always
met and opposed the tradition that would
make of us a hermit nation.
"Why should we not take what we
have won?" argued the General. "Can the
Philippines hurt us? and on the other
hand may not the United States be an in
finite boon to them?" "We went
to those people," continued the orator,
"and we promised to be their friends. Is
It possible to turn those people back again
to their oppressors?
"We want the Philippines because they
offer to us a magnificent territory; be
cause there is no longer such a thing as
a sailing man-of-war; because coal is
king. But we don't only want a coal hod
for the United States navy; we want the
land to civilize the people, to Christianize
the people. We want those islands as an
outpost for the great American people,
and where the flag has once gone up it
must never come down."
When Senator Perkins took the floor in
the face of the applause that was still
ringing for his opponent, without any pre
amble he at once began to demolish the
pretty castle of sentimental phrases that
the general had reared.
Where Barnes gave sentiment Perkins
gave facts.
Ruthlessly he destroyed the alluring
picture of the Philippines with thousands
of Americans luxuriating on enormous
wealth-producing sugar plantations and
showed the country clothed in all the hor
rors of the destructive earthquake, me
death-dealing cyclones, the deadly cholera
and the enervating, prostrating heat of
four degrees north of the equator.
"If you have any missionary work to
do," said the Senator, "come right home
here to do it. And when you have fin
ished with San Francisco you will prob
ably find a field in New York. If we save
this country we are doing pretty well."
The cheap labor of the Chinese in Man
ila the Senator offered as an argument
as to the impossibility of our boys com
peting with them, and "cheap labor
means danger to a republic," he de
clared.
In conclusion Senator Perkins said:
"Let us confine ourselves to this conti
nent. Let us revere our banner as we
now do. Let us maintain our national
dignity, our national honor. Let us build
war ships, but never let us bring in any
element that Is so antagonistic to repub
lican government as are the various sects
and tribes that inhabit the Philippine
Islands."
Interspersed with a programme of mu
sic and song, during the afternoon the
members of the Women's Press Associa
tion joined Mrs.E. O. Smith in a discus
sion of the facts presented by the lady
in her paper, "Does a Man Own His Own
Face?"
Mrs. Smith claimed that in this day of
sensationalism and caricature the press
seemed to think that they alone owned
all faces, to do with them as well or as
badly as they pleased. The caricaturist
came in for many hard taps by the lady,
who was ab!y seconded in her sweeping
assertions and all-round abuse of the dis
torter of faces by Mesdames Copley,
uretherick, Dr. Beecher and Mrs. Stan
tan.
