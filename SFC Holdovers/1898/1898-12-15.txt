VOLUME LXXXV.-UO. 15.
MRS. BOTKIN FACES
AN ACCUSING WITNESS
DRAMATIC SCENE ENACTED AT THE TRIAL.
The Suspected Woman Picked as
the Purchaser of Poison
and Candy.
Prosecution Finishes a Critical Day in the
Presentation of Its Caseâ A Series of
Sensational and Exciting
Incidents.
THE prosecution of Mrs. Cor
delia Botkin has now reached
a critical stage. For the
first time since the hearing of testi
mony began the name of the ac
cused woman was used yesterday un
der dramatic circumstances. One wit
ness testified positively that Mrs.
Botkin purchased arsenic at the Owl
drug store on June 1. Another de
clared her belief that the defendant
had bought the box of candy that was
subsequently poisoned. Every effort
of the defense to break the effect of
this evidence was without avail.
The attorney for Mrs. Botkin at
tempted to threaten and to browbeat,
but his attack was without effect.
The defense found some consolation
in the fact that a third witness for
the State failed in what the prosecu
tion evidently expected him to do. He
also had sold arsenic about June 1,
but he could not swear that he had
sold it to Mrs. Botkin. When pressed
for a definite answer he said there
was doubt enough in his mind for
him to declare that he did not sell
the drug to Mrs. Botkin.
The case for the prosecution is now
nearing its close. Efforts will be
made to trace the handkerchief found
with the candy to Mrs. Botkin. Ex
perts on handwriting will swear that
the accused woman -wrote the ad
dresses on the box of candy, and then
John P. Dunning will take the wit
ness stand to show that Mrs. Bot
kin had a motive for murder. The
proceedings yesterday were of a very
sensational character.
There was very little to indicate In
the preliminary proceeding? yesterday
In the trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
that the rr.'Jt exciting day of the case
â was to onsue. Before the last witness
of the day had heen relieved, however,
the accused woman had been more se
riously than before placed on the de
fensive. The attorneys for the prose
cution and the defense had clashed and
wrangled. Judge Cook had sharply
reprimanded one of them and had
threatened to clear the courtroom of
the hundreds of curious andmorbid
people who occupy every available seat,
throng the galleries, crowd the aisles
and encroach even upon the inclosure
In which sits the Judge. Incident after
Incident of excitement crowded one
upon the other during the day, and for
the first time Mrs. Botkin displayed
unmistakable signs of the fear that is
â within her.
The prosecution has now begun its
direct case against the accused woman.
Until yesterday the officers of State
v.ere concerned by necessity to prove
the fact of the Dover murders. This
has been done as far as the prosecutors
are able to do it. The case has turned
from that of the State of the murders
to the specific accusation of the woman
charged.
When court convened the audience
expected th John P. Dunning, husband
of one of the murdered women, would
be placed upon the stand to tell the
disgraceful story of his relationship to
Mrs. Botkin, to swear that she wrote
the address on the death package and
to establish with his recital a motive
for- the alleged crime of the woman.
The audience was disappointed. The
prosecution intends to hold John P.
Dunning for its last witness, who will
go upon the stand after Mrs. Botkin
has been connected with the murders
as far as the evidence of the State will
permit.
Thomas Price was the first witness of
the day. Mr. Price is the local chemist
and was needed by the prosecution to
complete its proof that there was still
arsenic in the poisoned candies after
the Dela.vare officials had turned the
box over to the police authorities of
this city. Mr. Price was equal to the
occasion. He testified that he had
made a chemical analysis of some of
the poisoned candy and had found ar
senic The results of his investigation
were! identical with those of Dr. T. R.
Wolfj and George Knight, who knows
the wisdom of leaving shrewd wit
nesses a'one. devoted practically no
time to cross-examination. Dr. Wolf
â¢was then recalled for a few minor ques
tions, and with his testimony th,e State
closed one of the great departments of
its case.
In closing one department and open
ing another the prosecutors did so in a
clever transition. Both Price and Dr.
T. R. Wolf had testified that arsenic
is never used for the purpose of bleach
ing. The next witness on the stand
swore that he had sold arsenic to Mrs.
Botkin because the woman assured him
that she wished to use the poisonous
The San Francisco Call
drug to bleach a hat. The witness who
gave this testimony is Frank Grey, a
clerk in the Owl drug store.
There was nothing new in the facts of
his evidence. He had told the story
before and no one in the courtroom
expected him to swear to anything
else. It was the method of his Identi
fication of Mrs. Botkin that supplied
the Bensation of the day. People for
got that Grey knew Mrs. Botkin be
fore she bought the poison, gave her
name and address and legally admitted
the purchase. But when Knight com
manded his client to stand, and the lit
tle, fat, black-gowned, black-com
plexioned woman arose and was point
ed out by Grey as the woman who had
purchased the poison there was a buzz
; 'Pressed excitement in the court
room.
Grey then related the circumstances
of the purchase as they have been re
lated. He sold powdered arsenic to
Mrs. Botkin. But both powdered and
lump arsenic were found in the poi
soned candy. The prosecution has
failed yet to show where the lump ar
senic was obtained.
In attempting to do so yesterday the
officers of the State met with a most
lamentable failure. David Green was
placed on the witness-stand and proved
to be a boomerang for the prosecution.
He worked for the Star drue store, on
Market street, near Fifth, in the latter
part of May and the early part of
June. About that time he sold lump
arsenic to a short, stout, flashily
dressed woman. When asked if Mrs.
Botkin was the woman Green hesi
tated, stumbled and collapsed in con
fusion. There was a rapid exchange of
sharp remarks between the attorneys
n? Knight sought to force the vacillat
ing drug clerk off his feet. Sharp re
marks and quick retorts served only to
make confusion worse confounded for
the helpless clerk, -who finally declared
in desperation that he could not idÂ«i
tify Mrs. Botkin as the woman to
whom he sold the poison. The defense
had won its first victory, and the morn
ing session closed rather gloomily for
the prosecution.
The lost ground was more than made
up In the afternoon by the State. The
next effort was to show that Mrs. Bot
kin had purchased at the establishment
nf George Haas & Son the box of candy
that was subsequently poisoned and
then sent on its mission 'of murder to
Dover. The central witness of the af
ternoon was Miss Sylvia Heney, a
young saleswoman employed by George
Haas. Miss Heney is bright, quick,
Iâ¢ rt and ready of wit Her story,
which may be of serious moment to
Mrs. Botkin, seemed to have been well
rehearsed, for the girl never stumbled
under the badgering, browbeating
- -examination of George Knight.
Miss Heney remembered that she had
sold a fancy box of candy on the after
norm of July 31 to a short, stout woman.
who, in manner of gait, movement and
appearance, resembled Mrs. Botkin.
When asked if Mrs. Botkin was the
purchaser of the box the saleswoman
replied impressively: "I believe she
is." There was a rustle and a sup
pressed buzz throughout the court
mom. Time and again Knight sought
to break the force of that answer, but
he failed. He shouted his questions
threateningly at the girl, but she only
arranged herself more comfortably in
the chair and replied with even temper
and undisturbed assurance.
Knight assumed to disbelieve the
girl's assertions, but the assumption
was unheeded if it was understood.
The lawyer grew insinuating, but his
soothing tones were as unavailing as
hi- disturbing shouts. Each effort to
cajole or threaten the girl into a modi-
Qcation of her calm assertion that she
believed Mrs. Botkin to be the woman
who bought the candy met only with
renewed failure. It was rather an in
teresting battle between a lawyer
trained in all the subterfuges of the
law and a girl who had probably never
been in a courtroom before. It seemed
as if Knight wished to retire from the
field, but did not know just how to do
so without meeting the titter that would
proclaim his defeat.
The attorney finally gave up in de
spair. He could neither confuse nor
frighten the witness. He could involve
her in no contradiction and her testi
mony remained as it had been given
upon direct examination. Miss Heney
had positively identified the box and
the candy and had reiterated until re
iteration became monotonous that she
believed Mrs. Botkin had made the
purchase. While this testimony was
being given the accused woman leaned
back in her chair and with eyes closed
remained in that position.
The last witness of the day simply
corroborated some of the more impor
tant elements of the testimony of Miss
Heney. This witness was Miss Kitty
M. Dittmer, another clerk employed by
SAX FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1898.
George Haas. This girl was also In
the store when It is alleged Mrs. Bot
km made her purchase. She was as
firm in her position as had been Miss
Heney, and Knight closed her cross
examination without winning a single
point. The case will be resumed to
day.
Professor Thomas Price, who said that
for forty years he had been an analytical
chemist, was the first witness of the day.
Mr. Hosmer's opening question "was:
"What is arsenic?" To this he replied
that it was one of the elements, and a
metal in character. He doubted if it was
a poison unless mixed with alkalies, when
it became a deadly poison. He then re
counted having received eight pieces of
chocolate candy from Chief Lees to be
analyzed.
Professor Price told in simple language
the methods employed and the results ob
tained by him. He found microscopic
crystals of arsenious acid in the candy.
One piece contained seven and 56-100
grains; another over five grains and tho
others nearly two grains each. No lumps
were found, it being mostly of an amor
phous, pulverized nature. Of ten pieces
he examined in Chief Lees' office later
two showed lump arsenic. One of these
lumps weighed nearly eight grains. The
aggregate amount found In eight pieces
was eighteen grains.
Asked as to the smallest dose that
would kill, he replied that it varied under
different conditions, but two to three
grains was a lethal dose and would cause
death. The witness told of the different
tests made by him and showed the speci
mens resulting from the tests.
Attorney Knight then took the witness
for cross-examination and questioned him
regarding the possibilities of poison de
vt loping about a copper candy kettle.
This was a possibility, he said, but poison
would only appear in minute particles.
Asked as to what produced colors he said
that was something the philosophers had
been unable to determine.
The witness said it would be impossible
for powdered arsenic to assume lump
form, although the latter might become
powdered in transportation. He saw no
nee of the chocolate having been
broken to insert the arsenic. Questioned
by Mr. Hosmer ho said that arsenic had
never been used to bleach hats to his
knowledge. Its bleaching power was
light.
Dr. Wolf was recalled and said he had
never heard of arsenic being used to
bleach straw. H-: also sai,! that cryftal
lne arsenic is sometimes found pulverized
and If placed In water or submitted to
moisture It would assume an amorphus
condition.
Frank Grey, pharmacist, employed in
the Owl Drug Store, was the next wit
ness. Mr. Hosmer's first question â was:
"Do you know the defendant, Mrs. Bot
kin?" He replied: "Yes, by sight." He
knew her since August, 1897, having seen
her at the Baldwin Pharmacy prior to
his going to the Owl. On June Ist of this
year she applied to him for arsenic. He
asked for what purpose she required it
and was told It was for bleaching straw
hats. He suggested oxalic acid and
chlorate of lime as being more effective,
but she insisted on the arsenic, as she had
hoi n accustomed to using it. lie finally
gave her two ounces of pulverized ar
senic, marked it poison and asked her to
sup to another desk, where the sale could
be recorded. She gave him the name,
Mrs. Botkin, and the address, Victoria
Hotel, Hyde and California streets.
"Is the defendant the person who pur
chased the arsenic?" asked Mr. Hosmer.
At the suggestion of Mr. Knight Mrs.
Bntkin stood up and the witness replied:
"That is the lady." Ho said he delivered
the arsenic to Mrs. Botkin and she left
the store with it.
On cross-examination Mr. Knight asked
him where he was born and educated, and
then went at once to the period the wit
ness spent at Ukiah. He was asked why
he left the employ of Hoffman at Ukiah.
After an objection by Mr. Hosmer, he
said it was to take a position at the in
sane asylum. He was discharged from
there. Did not know why. Later he said
he was succeeded by a relative of the
manager.
He did not ask Mrs. Botkin to sign her
name in the poison register, as it was
neither the custom nor the law. Mr.
Knight tried to trace other sales of var
ious poisons, but the witness fell back on
his book of record, without which he was
nor. sure. Mr. Knight wanted the original
record, but only a photographic copy was
available.
"I want the book, the original record,"
said Mr. Knight.
"Then you'll have to wait," replied
Chief Lees.
Attorney Knight came back with, "Who
says so? I will not cross-examine the
witness until I get the book of original
entry."
The witness was excused until 2 o'clock
and David Green took his place on the
stand. He is employed as a druggist at
the corner of Clay and Kearny streets,
but was formerly employed in the Star
Drug Store, Market street, opposite Fifth.
While there he sold two ounces of arsenic
to a woman who was "flashily dressed,
stout and somewhat prepossessing."
Judge Cook: "State your best opinion
as to Mrs. Botkin being the woman." Mr.
Knight told Mrs. Botkin to stand up, and
Mr. Hosmer objected to his manner, say
ing he was intimidating the witnesses and
that it must stop. Judge Cook admon
ished Mr. Knight not to raise his voice.
Replying to the Judge's question, Mr.
Green said: "She reminds me of her." He
W&fl asked what she asked for and what
she purchased, but objection was made
and sustained by Judge Cook. Hosmer
explained that he expected to show the
character of the arsenic sold to a woman
who said she had been to the Owl Drug
Store. Mr. Knight objected on the ground
that the man stated that he did not rec
ognize Mrs. Botkin as the woman.
Judge Cook asked the witness: "Do
you, in your own mind, believe and will
you state under oath that she is the
woman?" The witness could not answer.
On cross-exnmination Mr. Knight com
menced to ask the same questions that
he objected to counsel for the prosecution
asking. When reminded of this he per
mitted the witness to retire.
Frank Grey was the first witness dur
ing the afternoon session, and contrary
to expectations was not severely cross
examined. He recalled no purchasers
at the Owl Drug Store on June 1. A
big business was done there, but not in
poisons. The hour from Ito 2 was us
ually a dull one. few purchasers being
present.
GREY'S DRAMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF MRS. BQTKIN. â 
AN exciting scene was enacted yesterday morning at the trial of Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin when the accused woman was identified by Frank
Grey as one to whom he had sold arsenic. It was the first time in
the great trial that even the slightest reference was made by name or
suggestion in the testimony to the woman on trial for her life. Grey's
theatrical identification created, therefore, a great stir in the courtroom.
Chief Lees took the stand and testified
to having gone to Grey some time since
and purchased a package of arsenic sim
ilar to the one sold Mrs. Botkin.
Mr. Grey was recalled and testified to
having put up a package for Chief Lees
in September of this year. It was taken
from the same bundle as that sold Mrs.
Botkin, but was not necessarily from the
same bulk.
To the Judge: "It was the same grade
and class of arsenic as that sold Mrs.
Botkin."
Miss Sylvia Heney, "sales lady" in the
candy store of George Haas & Son, was
the next witness. She has been employed
by Mr. Haas two years, and on Sunday,
July 31. sold chocolate candy to a lady.
The latter was not very tall and was in
clined to be stout.
"Did you sell any candy to Mrs. Bot
kin?" asked Mr. Hosmer.
"I can't say she is the party."
"Do you believe her to be the woman?"
"I believe she is.
"She came between 4 and 5. I was j
standing on the east side of the store |
where the candles are kept, the east side i
of the store. JShe wanted to see some !
fancy boxes, and I took her to where we j

EACH OTHER'S BLOOD
General Wood Prevents a Duel at
Santiago de Cuba by â rrest
ing the Principals.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Dec. 14.â
General Wood, Military Governor of
the Department of Santiago, stopped a
duel to-day that had been arranged be-,
tween Senor Trujillo. editor of El Por
venir and Senor Colono, editor of Cuba
Libre. An article recently appeared
In the Independencia abusing Senor
Trujillo, charging him with beine a
swindler and accusing him of numer
ous crimes. Senor Trujillo attributed
its authorship to Senor Colono and
sent the latter a challenge. Under the
conditions agreed upon the duel was
to have been fought this afternoon on
San Juan hill. The contestants were
to use six-shooters, beginning at twen
ty paces and walking toward each
other, firing at will. If neither should
be injured by the other's six shots the
antagonists were to reload and start
again.
Chief of Gendarmerie Valient report
ed the matter to General Wood, who
promptly arrested both men and con
fined them In their own houses under
guard.
Ask for Lower Water Rates.
FRESNO, Dec. 14.â The Board of Su
pervisors was yesterday asked to regu
late the rates for water charged by the
Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company.
Heretofore the Supervisors have not in
center of the box and on top of the fancy
knot."
"Do you always give a fancy box with
candy?" asked Mr. Hosmer.
"No. Not unless requested. The regu
lar box has Haas' name on it, and that
is the kind usually sold unless a request
is made for one without it."
The witness identified the candy, the
box, the seal, and even the brown paper
wrapper which covered the fatal box
that carried death to two women in Dela
ware. She then told of the regular price
of the candy purchased by the woman as
being 50 cents, but as she did not receive
a full pound she was charged 40
cents for the candy and 25 cents ad
ditional for the fancy box. It was the
price paid for the candy that helped to
fix the various circumstances in her mind.
as it was an unusual occurrence for a
person to call for an odd amount. ' Tne
purchaser seemed impatient and nervous,
asking her to hurry up several times. She
was in the store some ten minutes.
Attorney Knight then took the witness
through a most rigid cross-examination,
but try as he would he could not shake
her story. He first asked how many writ
ten statements she had made for Chief
Lees. The witness thought not more than
two, although her questioner named four.
Mr. Haas was the first person to whom
she had spoken about the candy, telling
him about the circumstance of selling the
fancy box.
"Didn't Kitty Dittner tell you you sold
the candy?" asked Mr. Knight.
"No, sir! You are mistaken," witness
replied.
She knew Chief Lees had been at tho
store, but had not seen him there. She
said that she identified the candy box as
the one sold by her the moment she saw
it. A question was framed that implied
that she knew it was Mrs. Botkin who
terferod with the rates, but it is claimed
they have the right to rogulate them, as
the water is diverted from Kings river,
a public watercourse. The petition was
signed by a number of citizens. The hear
ing of the petition was set for January
19. It is supposed the canal company
will oppose interference by the board.
PRETTY VALLEY ROAD
DEPOT AT TULARE
When Completed, the Structure Will
Be One of the Finest in
the State.
TULiARE, Dec. 14.â Work has begun on
Tulare's Valley Road depot and a very
handsome and commodious structure it
will be.
The depot proper, built of brick, will be
30x164 feet, with fruit shed addition and
verandas, making it when completed
one of the best depots on the line. Delay
has been occasioned by the failure to get
the brick on the ground as soon as was
expected. Work on the structure will
now go forward, and the Valley Road will
be fully equipped for Dusiness. The finish
ing touches are being put on the Tulare
branch of the road and regular trains will
shortly be in operation.
Restrictions May Be Removed.
BERLIN, Dec. 14.â There seems to be a
prospect of the removal in the near fu
ture of the restrictions placed upon Amer
ican insurance companies in Prussia.
Upon the request of one of the largest
companies the Minister of the Interior
had decided to send two representatives
to New York to investigate whether the
Americans are able to comply with the
conditions of the Prussian authorities.
purchased the candy, but she denied hav
ing made such a statement, as she was
nut sure of the identity.
"You don't recognize her. Have you
any doubt?" asked Mr. Knight in feigned
surprise.
"I believe she is the woman," replied
Miss Heney.
"Is she the party?" ; persisted Mr
Knight. : :
"I believe she is." said Miss Honey.
Mr. Knight put the same question again
witb the same result. He dropped the
matter and the witness said she could not
name any other customer on whom she
waited during the afternoon. She remem
bered the sale to Mrs. Botkin because of
the incidents surrounding it. She first
told her story to Chief Lees at her home.
Some days later she went to his office
and made a statement which was taken
down by a stenographer. She first went
to identify Mrs. Botkin when the latter
was being taken to court. She thought
she looked "awfully like the woman to
whom she had sold the candy."
The witness answered a question to
which Mr. Hosmer wished to object, and
Mr. Knight turned 10 him and said:
"That's the time I got the best of you."
The spectators laughed and Judge Cook
said:
"This laughter must cease. This is the
trial of a case where the defendant is on
trial for her life for murder. It is un
seemly to act in this manner and I will
not permit it. The people are here purely
through courtesy and in such numbers as
to interfere with the officers of this court.
If this occurs again I will at once order
the room cleared of all persons who can
not find seats."
Mr. Knight tried in vain to get the wit
ness to state why she was in the City
Prison and in the court room with Mrs.
Botkin one day, but she affirmed that she
did not know that it was for the purpose

that she had built her story upon what
she had read in the papers regarding the
purchase of candy at Stockton by a
woman in black. She fixed the date ac
curately because a girl from the store
who was on her vacation passeu the store
and spoke to her. She returned to work
the next day. She said she had not been
drilled and that no one had told her to
stick to her story.
The opposing attorneys clashed again,
owing to what Mr. Hosmer thought was
harsh language on the part of Mr.
Knight.
"You think that's oratory, don't you?"
said Mr. Hosmer in an insinuating
manner.
"No, I don't," replied Mr. Knight. "I
think it is good hard sense."
Miss Heney said that from Mrs. Bot
kin's walk, manner and general appear
ance she thought she was the woman who
bought the candy.
To Judge Cook: "I can't say positively
she is the woman, but in my own mind I
believe she is the lady."
Mi.^s Kittie May Dittner succeeded Miss
Heney on the stand. She corroborated
the latter's story of the sale of the box
of candy. She noticed the purchaser, who
was short and rather stout. She nÂ±sem

her mind regarding the identity of the
woman, as she did not see her face.
Mr. Hosmer charged Mr. Knight with,
trying to mislead the witness in . some
matters by his mode of questioning her.
Shortly after Mr. Knight asked another
question and said to Chief Lees: "Don't
bob your head, Chief, to the witness; she
will bob her head." To Miss Dittner ho
said: "Don't notice him. He may bob
wrong some time."
The witness concluded her testimony
by saying that Mrs. Botkin resembles In

Wishes of the Madrid Comissioners
Ignored in the Treaty of
Peace.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â Spanish ship
i ping is not to enjoy preferential treatment

I der tHe terms of the peace treaty. Some
| thing of that nature may be brought
about in negotiations that must follow be
tween the United States and Spain as
part of the project for the restoration of
commercial relations, but so far it has not
been provided for. although the Spanish
Commissioners made a special request
that the privileges should be accorded.
The text of the treaty has not yet been
received at the State Department, 'ihe
document is so 'ong that the expense of
cabling it texturUly would be very great
and would not be warranted, in view of
the fact that the Government already
possesses a sufficiently accurate outline of
the articles. The American Commission
ers are expected to sail Saturday, which
will bring- them home by Christmas. They
will bring the treaty with them, and it is
believed the document will not be pub

as he said the Senate was falling into the
habit of doing. He called attention to the
fat t that notwithstanding Illinois had fur
nished C5.0U0 more soldiers than Indiana
the pension roll for Indiana exceeded that
of Illinois by $1,5u0.000. He accounted for
this fact on the ground that Indiana is a
pivotal State politically, Haying that it
was notorious that the Commissioner of
Pensions, who was an ex-Union soldier,
had granted pensions to almost every ap
plicant in political districts which were
close. He did not contend that the Re
publican party was alone to blame, but
knew that men of all parties were in
clined to uso the machinery of the Pen
sion Office to further their political In
terests. He had indorsed Mr. Cleveland's
veto of pension bills, and while he did not
want to revive the old questions he would
express the opinion that the Government
in this matter had fallen into a most un
just and Iniquitous expenditure by its ill
advised legislation.
Gallinger suggested that Vest, instead
of .scolding the Senate on private bills,
Bhould propose amendments to the pen
sion laws which would correct the abuses
he complained of. Continuing, Gallinger
paid the committee had been considering
the advisability of publishing the list of
pensioners. Yet there were objections to
the plan, and he feared that if underta
ken its only effect would be to take two
or throe million dollars out of the treas
ury to no good purpose.
The bill providing regulations for the
registration of foreign-built vessels
wrecked on the American coast and re
paired in the United States was taken up
at the instance of Elkins, and Caffery
addressed the Senate in opposition to it,
living that under its provisions vessels
would be wrecked in order to secure
American registry. He attacked the nav
igation and tariff laws of the United
Btates, Baying they had practically driven
our merchant marine from the seas. He
contended that the bill was prohibitive In
Its terms, intended to remove the last
vestige of competition in the matter of
Shipbuilding. There was no necessity for
this under the present conditions. "We
may hold the Philippines, Cuba and Porto
Rico," he Bald, "'but If we adopt the con
tractive policy of this measure, our bal
loon will soon collapse and our expansion
policy come to an end."
At the close of Caffery's remarks the
registry bill went over until to-morrow
and the Nicaragua canal bill was taken
up, the pending question being Turple's
motion to postpone until January 1.
Harris of Kansas then spoke on the
general features of the bill. He said that
as a boy he was attached to a surveying
party in the isthmus in 1559 and ever since
that time he had been the zealous advo
vate of the general proposition that a
canal should be built across the isthmus.
Still ho did not consider it practicable for
a private corporation to construct the
canal, and ho urged government owner
ship, but the Maritime Canal Company's
charter supplied the only open door, and
the committee in charge of the bill had
dotermined to enter it, with the under
standing that the company was to be got
ten rid of. Harris said he considered the
Panama canal as entirely impracticable.
He supported Berry's amendment, reliev
ing the bill of its bond provisions, saying
It would greatly improve the measure.
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty formed the
basis of a brief speech by Money. He
advocated delay in order to afford oppor
tunity for negotiation looking to the abro
gation of the treaty. Money said we
Hhould at least notify Groat Britain that
we desire modification of the treaty as a
first step. In this connection Money re
ferred to the entente cordla!f> existing be
tween this country and England, saying
that he wanted to see the two nations
brought even closer together than now
Hence the Importance and propriety of
dealing fairly and courteously with Great
Britain in this matter.
Bacon gave notice of an amendment
providing that work should not bogin on
the canal until the Government of Nicar
agua should consent to a modification of
the treaty granting title to the United
States in perpetuity to the canal right of
way. and also eliminating articles 53 and
54 of the concession from that document
Stewart advocated the bill a.s a most Im
portant step In thn commerce of the
world, and urged Senators to accept It
as it stands.
Replying to Monoy, Morgan said he had
never claimed that the Clayton-Bulwor
treaty >as not in full force, "denying the
assertion Imputed to him that the treaty
had vanished Into thin air. He had been
of the opinion that the treaty was abro
gated by the acts of Great "Britain and

ANTONIO F. TERRY'S
CAREER IS CLOSED
Death of the Millionaire Cuban Planter,
Whose Second Wife Was Sybil
Sanderson.
PARIS, Dec. 14. â Antonio F. Terry, formerly of New York, died
here to-day of liver complaint. He was twice married, his sec-
X ond wife being- Sybil Sanderson, the opera singer.
Antonio F. Terry was one of the sons of Senor Tomaso Terry,
who left a fortune at his death in 1886 estimated to amount from
$50,000,000 to $60,000,000 to be divided among his six children. Antonio
came into possession of a large sum of money in Spanish gold, a
augar plantation in Cuba and a residuary interest in the estate. His
first wife was Miss Grace Dalton Secar, to whom he waa married in
New York during the year 1576, when he was 20 years of age. Mr.
Terry went abroad in ISB7, made h.is home in Paris and spent much of
his time traveling. After about ten years of married life Mrs. Terry
brought suit for divorce against her husband. He met it with a coun
ter-suit, and their troubles were still In the courts when Mrs. Terry
died in 1897. The same year Mr. Terry married Miss Sanderson, who
is a daughter of Judge Sanderson of California. Mr. Terry was born
in Cuba.
opening up the subject with Great
Britain.
At the conclusion of Morgan's remarks
an agreement was reached to vote on
Turple's postponement motion to-morrow,
after which the Senate went into execu
tive session. At 5:25 p. m. the Senate ad
journed.
REED'S SARCASTIC
DEFENSE OF HOUSE RULES
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â The House to
day, for the second time during this Con
gress, refused to consider the Lodge im
migration bill. At the last session an at
tempt was mado to taite it from the
Speaker's table, but it was defeated by
a large majority. Danforth of Ohio,
chairman of the Immigration Committee,
thought the bill would be stronger after
the elections were over, but to-day when
he tried again to secure consideration the
House declined, 100 to 103, to take it up.
An interesting but brief debate on the
rules was precipitated during the session
by Grow of Pennsylvania, during which
DeArmond made a spech on the deca
dence of the privilege of debate in the
House and held Speaker Reed responsible
for the fact that the House had h.ad no
opportunity to adopt a new system of
rules at this session. Tho Speaker re
plied with a sarcastic speech, in which he
referred to the complaints of John Ran
dolph in the early days of the century to
show that the syne remonstrances were
made then that #ere being heard to-day.
FIFTY THOUSAND MEN
FOR THE CUBAN ARMY
Adjutant General Corbin Believes
Tliat Number Necessary to
Maintain Order.
WASHING! ON, Dec. 14.â Adjutant
General Corbin appeared to-day before
the House Committee on Military Af
fairs. His statements attracted unus
ual Interest because of their direct
reference to conditions in Cuba, Porto
Rico and the Philippines and the mili-
tary requirements on which the War
Department was acting. As to the
need of an increased army, he said
that was a most serious proposition.
He proceeded:
"The Cuban evacuation commission,
consisting of Generals Wade and But
ler and Admiral Sampson, has sub
mitted a statement that in order to
preserve order and restore order in
Cuba, it will require the presence of
an army of 50,000 men."
General Corbin said he would send
this recommendation to the committee,
but later it was arranged that it should
be submitted without confidential res
ervations. It was on this recommenda
tion, said General Corbin, that the ulan
of sending troops to Cuba was based.
It might be found that the 50.000 men
would not be requisite.
"But we are holding 50,000 men in
readiness to go If required," said the
general.
"As to the Philippines," he went on,
"General Otis, in command there, had
recommended that 25,000 men were re
quired there. In Porto Kico the of
ficers in command say the force now on
hand .3 adequate for the requirements.
The present force there is 6100. That
made 100,000 menâ so,ooo for Cuba, 25,
000 for the Philippines, and about 6000
for Porto Rico, leaving us, with an
army of 100,000, about 18,000 for re
serves at home. If we had had such an
army last June there would have been
no such loss of life as occurred."
Owing to importunities of Congress
men for the release or volunteers the
press was requested to give General
Corbin's statement on that point. He
scld:
"The Department is disposed to deal
very leniently as to letting off men who
are needed at home. In some cases
colonels have been instructed to re
duce companies to eighty, so as to let
' off men who were urgently needed at
: home. And even below eighty we are
â¢ making discharges on satisfactory
statements that the presence of men
are needed at home."
The Senate Committee on Ap
; propriations continued its hear
ings on the army deficiency bill
to-day. General Miles being before the
committee for more than an hour. The
pending proposition is an amendment,
supported by several members, provid
1 ing for the immediate mustering out of
50,000 volunteers. It is understood
> Secretary Aiger and Assistant Secre
tary Meiklejohn opposed such a pro
vision and Adjutant General Corbin
said that, in view of the recommenda
tion of the Cuban Military Commission,
it would be advisable.
General Miles said to-day that he
thought 25,000 men would be enough
; for Cuba. He said the island must, in
time, and at an early date, be policed
i by natives, which should be recruited
i into the army under American officers.

followers have notified the Chief Jus
j tice that they met Â«n November 12 and

opposition met, and Tamasese, who
had previously been named as their

Mataafa has been proclaimed King of
Atua and Aana. On November 28 Ma
taafa's adherents came to the Chief
Justice and said if there was no ob
jection they were going to proclaim
him King. The Chief Justice read them,
the treaty and said there was no ob
jection to their doing so.
Considerable excitement was created
here on November 10 by the landing of
a party of bluejackets from the Brit
ish and German warships. While no
serious trouble is anticipated at pres
ent, the representatives of the powers
thought it wise to make a demonstra
tion, owing to the number of natives
who have congregrated at Mullnuu, so
as to show that the powers had deter
mined to protect the white residents.
The party landed at Matautu and
marched through the town, headed by
the German band from the Buzzard
with the drum and fife corps from H.
M. S. Porpoise. After making the dis
play both parties returned to their re
spective ships.
Mataafa's followers are known to
have a large number of rifles secreted.
On November 28 a native arrived from
Pango-Panpro and said that two United
States war vessels were there. The
consuls have no intimation of any
war vessels having been ordered to
Apia. The v .zzard left on November

off the station. The Ringdove has also
gone to Sydney. The German warship

Californians Still Working Against the

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â Although President Mc-

that the proposed reciprocity treaty with Greece will not be
pressed to a conclusion, the California delegation is spar-

WISE TELLS
OF MOORE'S
QUEER WORK
Ex-Collector's Task at
Washington.
SEEKS A FAIR INVESTIGATION
AND EXPOSES THE CONDUCT OF
THE TREASURY AGENT.
Information Laid Before Assistant
Secretary Howell Confirms The
Call's Expose of the Ma
jor's Transactions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Dec. 14.
Ex-Collector of Customs Wise ar
rived in Washington early this morn
ing. His appearance has been awaited
with considerable interest, for it was
reported that he was coming to Wash
ington to file charges against Treasury
Inspector Horace A. Moore of San
Francisco. Mr. Wise has not yet filed
formal charges in writing, but he was
at the Treasury Department bright and
early to-day and had a very interest-
Ing conversation with the treasury of
ficials.
Assistant Secretary Spalding, who
had supervision of Customs Depart
ment matters when Mr. Wise was Col
lector at San Francisco, was first seen,
and it may be said incidentally that he,
as well as Secretary Gage, holds Wise
in highest esteem. Mr. Wise told
Spalding what he knew about Moore,
whereupon Spalding said: "You go and
tell Assistant Secretary Howell what
you have said to me. I am sure he
will be interested, for he has already
heard more or less about this officer. '
So Mr. Wise then interviewed Mr.
Howell, and said to him: "I used to
know you when you were with Mr.
Spalding in clerical capacity before
you were promoted to be assistant sec
retary. I liked you from the start, and
if you will order an investigation into
Moore's character you will not only
perform a valuable service for your
department, but will make me your
debtor in everlasting friendship."
Howell produced from his flies a copy
of the San Francisco Call of Monday,
December 6, charging Major Moore
with base conduct toward lady type
writers, and asked Wise whether he
knew anything about it. Mr. Wise, in
reply, not only corroborated The Call's
story, but told Howell other things
about Moore which The Call had
deemed improper for publication.
Wise said that when he was Collector
he had written Secretary Gage a letter
about Moore, saying in effect that he
"ought to have been a squawman on
some reesrvation, where he could exer
cise his peculiar genius without re
straint." In this letter, which occupied
twelve or fifteen type-written pages, he
also said that Moore had not been faith
ful to his trust; that when Hager was
Collector at San Francisco under Cleve
land's first administration Moore should
have investigated the conduct of Fo
garty, against whom charges were
made, but he did not do so because the
two were companions and played games
of whist together. â 
A search was then made for this let
ter, but it could not be found on, file,
whereupon Mr. Wise remarked that the
Secretary of the Treasury had evi
dently concluded that it was of such a
nature that it might as well be de
stroyed as preserved in the archives of
the department. But Wise assured
Howell that he had written to San
Francisco asking that a copy of it be
forwarded to him at Washington.
Mr. Wise was very much disappointed
to find that Secretary Gage was absent
from the city and would not bo back
until next week. He has not yet de
cided whether to await his return and
receipt of the letter from San Fran
cisco alluded to above, but it is likely
he will do so. He is quite anxious that
Moore's character be inquired into and
appropriate action taken when the re
port is made, but he believes that in
stead of intrusting this work to Treas
ury Department agents Collector Jack
son should be asked to report to the
department. Mr. Wise feels sure that
this will be done. He does not wish to
file any formal written charges against
Moore unless he is assured that investi
gation will be made by a thoroughly
impartial party, such as Collector Jack
eon, for he feels sure that the Col
lector's report will substantiate his
charges.
It may be, however, that Me. Wise
will file formal charges before he leaves,
whether or not he Is assured of the
manner in which the investigation will
be conducted. At any rate an Inquiry
will be instituted.
Mr. Wise says there have been sev
eral instances wherein Moore has been
guilty of improper advances to lady
employes of the custom office. He says
that he heard of three cases, and that
two of these ladies admitted to him
that Moore had made improper pro
posals to them. One of them shed
tears when she was questioned. He has
only a vague recollection of the type
writer mentioned in The Call of De
cember 5, but thinks she may have
been the one employed in the District
Attorney's office after Schlesinger's va
cation of that office. He remembers
that the lady typewriter employed by
Schlesinger's successor made similar
charges against Moore. Wise says,
furthermore, that it was well under
stood in San Francisco that Moore was
assoc'atlng with a Mrs. Elliott while
"Foss" was serving in the penitentiary.
He says that when he was Collector he
received anonymous letters concerning
Dick Williams.' He knew by the hand
writing they were written by Wong
Sam, but did not heed communications
written anonymously, but that Moore,
"who also received such communications
from Wong Sam, entered into an agree
BRYAN AND HIS ISMS
HAD GRANTS SUPPORT
San Diego Candidate for the Senatorship
Was a Leading Silver Republican
Two Years Ago.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 14.â 1n 1896, when there existed considerable
doubt as to whether the electoral vote of California would be cast
for William McKinley and a sound financial policy, there was one
man in Southern California who came voluntarily to the front and
gave several persons to understand that he was a supporter of Wil
liam J. Bryan and the principle of the free coinage of silver. That
man was U. S. Grant of San Diego.
In October, 1596, there existed (and there exists to-day) an or
ganization known as the Silver Republican Club. The officers of this
club were energetic and enthusiastic men. Nathan Cole Jr. was
president and with his confreres he was really the bone find sinew of
the fight made in this part of the State for Bryan and free silver.
One of the prominent Republicans whom the Silver Republicans
in this part of the State were always referring to as evidence of the
fact that Bryan was being supported by men of prominence who
formerly had been affiliated with the Republican party was U. S.
Grant of San Diego. The story was generally circulated throughout
this part of the State and Mr. Grant never made any effort to deny
it. In fact, it was understood that he had made a very liberal con
tribution to the Bryan campaign fund.
In those days the Silver Republicans worked on the theory that
if by chance it should so happen that they might hold the balance of
power in the Legislature of 1897 they would insist on sending U. S.
Grant to the United States Senate as the successor of George C.
Perkins. But It happened that the Silver Republicans were without
influence in the Legislature of 1897, and so Mr. Grant and his Sen
atorial aspirations were compelled to wait.
Now he appears as a straight, sound money Republican, asking
Senatorial honors. The result is there is a very strong protest
made against Mr. Grant and his ambition to be Senator by some
of the local Silver Republicans, who claim. that he stated he was with
them two years ago and who now goes back on his former friends.
ment with this Chinaman whereby ha
was to escape punishment for his own
crimes in consideration of his testimony
in the case against Williams. The Dis
trict Attorney was a party to this
agreement, "for he told me so him
self," said Mr. Wise.
"When a raid was made on Chinese
from the Omaha Exposition, Moore in
formed Wong Sam that such a raid
was to be made. He then went to Los
Angeles and only returned when all
had escaped. In the case of the Chi
nese woman, Fong Suey Won, Moore
and a woman from the Mission were
the parties responsible for her release
on the plea that the 'poor woman'
wanted to get back to China. He made
these representations, although he
knew that she was a procuress and
therefore guilty of felony. He thus
secured her release before the Chinese
Bureau knew the facts. Collector Jack
son has exonerated Meredith. The
Treasury Department understands the
case. Meredith's conduct was all right
according to Colonel Jackson.
"Moore's dislike of me dates from the
time when three Treasury Department
agents held their usual investigation
of the customs department affairs.
Moore was one of the three, the others
being ex-Governor West of Utah and
Inspector Dullom. Moore had given
Governor West a list of questions to
ask me. I knew this and in the pres
ence of all three pointed my finger at
Moore and said: 'There Is a man about
whom I have written a letter concern
ing improper advances toward ladies.'
This statement of mine should have
been included in the testimony taken
by these three inspectors, but I after
ward ascertained that Moore had
caused to be stricken out of the report
my reference to him in connection with
women. Nor oan you find it to-day in
this report filed at the Treasury De
partment.
"Moore proposed to Greenwall in the
penitentiary that he would secure his
release if he would offer testimony
against others. The very day I left the
Cuatom-ho-use he discharged Mrs.
Houston, a relative of Senator Simp
son of Los Angeles, who placed Per
kins in nomination for Senator at Sac
ramento, on the plea that as I had em
ployed her as a typewriter she was
friendly to me and her retention by the
new regime might be detrimental to- the
service. Collector Jackson acted on
his suggestion and she was discharged,
but Mr. Jackson afterward regretted
that he had acted so hastily and at the
instigation of this man."
Mr. Wise related many other stories
about Moore, showing him to be thor
oughly small, mean and contemptible,
but these stories, while showing the
small caliber of Moore about his finan
cial and social doings, are too mean
and trivial for publication.
FITZHUGH LEE IS
WELCOMED IN HAVANA
Everywhere the Ex-Consul General
Beceives a Great Ova
tion.
HAVANA, Dec. 14.â General Lee's pres
ence has provocated numerous demonstra
tions, though he has tried to avoid them.
He ate lunch to-day at the Hotel Trocha
with Generals Wade, Greene and Clous,
and leaving there this afternoon he passed
with his escort through Carro, a suburb
of Havana, where the ladies waved
American flags and threw flowers. The
crowds along his route cheered enthusi
astically. At Marlanao his reception was
equally enthusiastic.
La Lucha announces that General Lee
proposes to treat Cubans, Spaniards and
all other nationalities with equal justice.
This has produced a great reaction among
Spanish residents favorable to General
Lee, the hope being everywhere expressed
that he will act up to La Lucha' s asser
tions.
VOLUNTEERS TO SETTLE
IN THE PHILIPPINES
Astor Battery Inaugurates a Move
ment for the Development of
the Islands.
MANILA, Dec. 14.â At an enthusiastic
meeting of the Astor Battery at its quar
ters to-day preliminary steps were taken
to establish the Philippine Development
Association of American Volunteers for
the purpose of promoting the development
of the islands, when the volunteers are
discharged from the service. While will
! ing to bear arms as long as required,
many of the volunteers are desirous of re
maining here to engage in various enter
prises. Some of them are determined to
settle down in the islands even if they
are compelled to return to the United
States in order, to get their discharges.
The association proposes, however, to
communicate with the United States au
thorities in order to obtain the discharge
of all volunteers who are desirous of set
tling down here, and will urge that the
men be granted a traveling allowance in
lieu of transportation when their time
has expired. Meantime the association
Intends to procure information regarding
the resources of the islands. Its mem
bership is confined to enlisted men of
good character.
The Astor Battery has been ordered to
deliver up its equipment to the Quarter
master, preparatory to embarking in a
homeward-bound transport.
Murderer Chavez Reprieved.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Dec. 14.â
Warden Halo received a telegram from
Governor Budd to-day stating that he had
reprieved Manuel Chavez, who was to be
hanged next Friday for the murder of a
Spaniard near San Diego, until April 15
or next year. Chavez was removed from
the condemned cell and taken back to
"murderers' row." His joy at learning of
the reprieve was unbounded.

VANCOUVER, Dec. 14.â The Em
press of India brings the following from
Hongkong::
At a recent banquet at Shanghai
Lord Beresford said:
"Wherever I have met Britishers they
say they dare not make extensive in
vestments; there Is no security for the
future."
Lord Beresford said he would do all
he could to convince the British that
the policy of "drift" in China must
cease. The speaker then referred to the
Russians and said he went all through
Manchuria and everywhere were armed
Cossacks.
"Why were they there? There was
no reason In a peaceful time for such a
state of affairs. Things look very
black for trade in the near future.
"At Port Arthur when I arrived tre
mendous preparations were being made
as if for battle. I asked an officer why
these preparations were made. He
answered it was necessary to procure
food. He took up the trade of Port
Arthur and found that in the last
three years three vessels came there
and their cargo wasâ seaweed.
"If the Konshing case had happened
In America, it would have been settled
long ago. When Igo home I will urge
a settlement. Great Britain has not a
single sod In .China which belongs to
her sphere of Influence. When it comes
to diplomacy Russia always wins."

HARRISON AND
ALTGELD ARE
NOW AT OUTS
Side Issues in the
Chicago Scandal.
BRIBERY CHARGES RENEWED
YKRKES AND THE EX-GOVERN
OR MAKE STATEMENTS.
Meanwhile the Aldermen Are Pre
paring New Ordinances to Help
Out the Traction Com
panies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 14.â The franchise
fight has been dragged into politics
and public attention Is being attracted
from the efforts of the alleged bribers
and boodlers among the street car
magnates and Aldermen to loot the
city to the contest for supremacy in
the -councils of Illinois' Democracy,
now being waged by the followers of
Mayor Harrison and ex-Governor Alt
geld.
In a speech last night Altgeld said
undoubtedly there was much truth in
Yerkes' charge that the so-called
"trust" newspapers had their price. He
had it from good authority that the
amounts demanded for the support of
the fifty-year franchises were as fol
lows: Tribune, $150,000; Record, $100,000;
Times-Herali $10u,000; Post, News and
Journal, $60,000 each. The speech has
created a sensation. All the afternoon,
papers took up the matter and in inter
views Altgeld insisted the statement
was true.
"I know the statement to- be abso
lutely false," said Mayor Harrison, re
ferring to Altgeld's remarks concern
ing the newspapers. "But, assuming
it is true, the traction companies can
not take up the proposition too quickly.
It's dead cheap. If the street car com
panies can secure the support of the
newspapers it is cheap at any price.
They can then get any kind of an or
dinance they want. Except for the as
sistance of the press the opposition to
the Allen bill would be hopeless and the
issue between the city and corporations
would have been settled in favor of the
latter long ago. But I know too- much
of the publishers In this city to enter
tain for a moment the implication con
tained in the rumor repeated by Alt
geld last night. I fought them for a
long time, and I will say I would rather
have them with me than against me.
If the corporations think the news
papers have prices they should hasten
to close a deal."
Joseph Medill, editor of the Tribune,
would not discuss Altgeld's charge, ex
cept to say he was surprised that a
man of Altgeld's ability and standing
would make so seriou* a charge on
mere rumor. Messrs. Kohisaat of the
Times-Herald and Post and Lawson of
the Record and News refused to dis
cusa the matter at all.
In a statement to the press to-night
Yerkes reiterates the charges of black
mail against the publishers of papers,
and says further that those Aldermen
who run all-night dives, policy shops,
poolrooms and gram blingr- rooms â and
there are several in the Council â were
promised protection fur their games If
they voted against the traction ordi
nances.
Mass meetings continue to be held in
opposition to the franchise extension,
but owing to the Altgold- Harrison split
the public is losing interest in the main
question at issue. In the meantime the
Council committees are at work fram
ing new ordinances to be introduced
Monday night, and it would not be sur
prising if as a result of the diversion
furnished by the politicians the trac
tion companies will slip through a
measure giving all they hope for and
probably all originally asked for.

DIED FROM A
NATURAL CAUSE
Verdict of Agnews
Board.
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION
NOTHING MYSTERIOUS ABOUT
HER SUDDEN DEATH.
.Much of the Sensation Traced to the
Examiner's Fad of Faking.
Stocking's Frank
Statement.
Soecial Dispatch to The Call.
AGNEWS. Dec 14.â 'Resolved, that
the board of managers, after due inves
tigation of ;h Btances attend
ing the death of Bessie Bailey, con
cludes that t^he came to her death
from natural causes, entirely uncon
nected with the management of the
Agnews State Hospital."
With the adoption of this resolution
at thÂ» reeular meeting of the Agnews
Asylum trustees ended the supposed
mystery surrounding the death of the
unfortunate young woman named.
The action of the board was taken only
after the case had been thoroughly in
vestigated, and the examination failed
to develop a single doubtful or sus
picious fact. Incidentally it was
shown that the Examiner's copyrighted
and exclusive habit of faking was
Bible for the sensational
[ the affair that it published.
Director White brought the matter to
an issue. ::<. stated that in view of
the reports that had gone out reflecting
on some of the attaches of the institu
te n and on the management of the asy
lum in connection with the death of
Miss Bailey, he thought it but right to
invite everyone who had any knowledge
on the subject before the board.
Director Upham warmly seconded the
â¢ of White, adding that he would
like to have Dr. Stocking, the first aa
:.â  physiccn of the asylum, and Dr.
the superintendent, come be
fore the board and help clear up the al
leged mystery.
Chairman Curnow placed the matter
formally before the meeting in the
Ehape of a motion to investigate the
manner of Miss Bailey's death and to
ascertain who were instrumental In
bringing it about.
Director Gould attempted to throw
cold water on the proposition of so sweep
ing an investigation, and moved an
amendment to the motion so as have
it call for an investigation of the man
ner of death only.
Director White fought this curtail
ment or" the scope of the inquisition,
saying that it had been charged that
Dr. Stocking had been in this girl's
room more than he ought to have been,
while Curnow interjected a remark
about chicken dinners having been j
given to the young woman by Dr.
Stocking. White added that he would
agree to the amendment, if the board
would, immediately after the decth had
been investigated, proceed to investi
gate matters at the asylum supposed to
be connected with the girl's taking off.
Gould would not consent to this, but
his amendment was carried by the
votes of Hale, Upham and himself.
Director Hale called for all the let
ters and telegrams that had passed be
tween the officials and attaches of the
asylum on one side and the officials of
Nevada and the physician who had at
tended Miss Bailey on the train and the
physician who had made the post
mortem examination on the other.
Most of this correspondence has al
ready been published. The most im
portant portion of it, and that which
has not been published, were the letters
that passed between Dr. Sponogle of
the Agnews Hospital and Dr. Hood of
Elko, Nev. In response to a note from
Dr. Sponogle, the Elko physician who
made the autopsy, -wrote as follows:
C. J. Hood,
Physician and Surgeon.
ELKO, Nev. .
Dr. Sponogle â Dear Doctor: As regards
Statements of Examiner, using my name,
I have never made any remarks as to the
cause of death nor any statements re
flecting: on the character of said deceased,
nor have T ever given my opinion of the
cause of death.
Certain drugs were found on her per
pon and one empty paper, which had pre
viously contained a powder evidently
similar to other powders found, contain
ing- a substance resembling acetainled
with a fine powdery substance of a very
bitter taste. What the exact Ingredients
â¢were I do not know.
Above you may use or not, aa you
think best. Very truly, C. J. HOOD.
This was followed by another note
from Dr. Sponogle as follows:
AGNEWB STATE HOSPITAL,
AGNEWS, Cal., Dec. 5. IS9S.
Dr. Hood, Elko, Nevadaâ Dear Doctor:
I am requested by the Board of Managers
of this hospital to address you concern
ing the autopsy of Miss Bessie Bailey.
We would like to have a statement from
you regarding the condition of the body
by inspection, al:-b regarding the vital
organs and of the thoracic, abdominal
and pelvic regions, and if you examined
the brain and spinal cord. We would be
pleased to have a full and complete his
tory of the case as you found it, and your
opinion as to the cause of death. As there
has been so much newspaper notoriety
concerning the case we want to obtain
::ue facts. Very respectfully yours,
F. M. SPONOGLE,
Medical Superintendent Agnews State
i [ospitaL
To this came the following reply:
c. j. iiood,
Physician and Surgeon.
ELKO. Nev., Dec. 7, IP9S.
P. M. Sponogle. M. D., Agnews, Cal.â
I>' ar Doctor: As regards the case of Bes-
Llley, deceased, I saw the body after
l.rinc embalmed by local undertaker, and
on November 21 examined contents of
pelvic cavity only.
Following conditions found:

no cause of death discovered Fratern
ally. C. J. HOOD.
When Dr. Stocking was called upon
to tell what he knew of Ressie Baileys
condition when she left the Institution
hf- statfd that she was PufiV-ring from
a slight cold contracted on the day she
left, caused, presumably, by having
taken a hot bath a few hours before she
started on her fatal trip. He had pro
vided her with some quinine pills and
also with some laxative pills and
sulphonal powders, but no morphine.
He declared that if she had taken at
one time everything he had given her
it would not have caused death or even
hurt her. His opinion, founded on the
information received from Nevada, was
that her death was caused by pulmon
vy congestion or acute pneumonia. It
CANDIDATES FOR THE
INTERIOR SECRETARYSHIP
Land Con)missioner Hermann and Webster Davis
After tr;e Place to Be Vacated by
Bliss.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â 1t Is the opinion of leading members of the administration still in the city
that the vacancy to be caused by the resignation of Secretary of the Interior Bliss will be filled by
promotion. In this connection the names of Binger Hermann, Commissioner of the General Land Of
fice, and Assistant Secretary of the Interior Webster Davis are being considered. Both of these are personal
friends of the President and have given excellent service to the party.
For geographical reasons it is thought that Mr. Hermann's chances are the better. There la no repre
sentation in the Cabinet from the Pacific Coast, and on account of the vote of Oregon in the recent elections
it Is thought highly probable that the President will confer the office of Secretary of the Interior upon Mr.
Hermann.
Mr. Davis, however, has given very valuable campaign services In many States, for which the President
feels very grateful.
being no uncommon thing for persons
in that high altitude to die from this
complaint within a few hours after
being attacked.
Dr. Christal, the second assistant
physician at the hospital, under whose
charge Miss Bailey had been, stated
that he had provided her on the day of
her departure with an ounce of glyce
rine and borax for her chapped lips and
had also given her some licorice tablets
in an antl-kamnia box. He believed
her death was due to acute pneumonia.
Dr. Sponogle's opinion as to the cause
of death was the same as that of his
two associates.
Dr. Stocking stated that he wanted
the board to satisfy Itself thoroughly
and completely as to his connection
'With the affair, and that he was desir
ous of clearing himself from the insinu
ations and innuendoes that had been
published regarding him. It was
charged, he said, that he had given
Miss Bailey money and chicken din
ners. He had one day given Miss
Bailey 50 cents of her own money with
which to buy herself some fruit. This
was done on her Importuning him for
It. The books would show the trans
action. As to the chicken dinners, he
had ordered chicken served to her but
once, and this was as a promised re
ward for her having performed parti
cularly meritorious service In waiting
on another patient. This chicken was
part of that which was to have been
served at his own table.
Some minor testimony was taken of
attaches as to the bath enjoyed by Miss
Bailey on the day she left; the resolu
tion "already priven was presented by
Director Gould, was adopted by the
unanimous vote of the five members of
the board, and the Bessie Bailey in
cident went into history.
CONFLICT OF HAWAIIAN
AND AMERICAN LAWS
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Dec. 7.â Treasury
Agent Brown has declined to permit
several Chinese who arrived by the
steamer City of Peking to land, al
though their re-entry permits are in
correct form so far as tl?Â° laws of Ha
waii are concerned, but not in accord
ance with the United States laws regu
lating the entry of laborers. The re
sult is an appeal to the Hawaiian Su
preme Court, w r l eh will be heard next
Monday. About 150 more Chinese in
exactly the same predicament are ex
pected by the Gaelic on the 9th. This
conflict of jurisdiction may he far
reaching enough to entail diplomatic
negotiations between the United States
and China. Here are men who left
here under the protection of the Ha
waiian Government, and the good faith
of that Government pledged that they
might return to this country if certain
requirements were complied with. They
return and are met with the statement
that they cannot land because laws of
which they have had no notice and per
taining to a different country have
gone into effect. It would appear to be
only just that the laws of the United
States should not invalidate contracts
made by the Hawaiian Government
prior to the act of absorption. Except
in regard to Chinese immigration the
Department of Customs is still under
the liawaiian law, and the notice that
Mr. Brown was in charge of this
branch of the department was only
given just prior to the sighting the in
coming vessel with these men on board.
Another question that Is being
mooted in regard to this important teat
case is: Has the Hawaiian Supreme
Court any Jurisdiction over United
States Federal matters or a Federal
official, although he may be seated by
consent of the acting government in
the Hawaiian custom-house? That
bureau is not yet under the control of
the United States, and certainly was
not when the permits to return were
granted. Mr. Brown's contention, it is
said, will be that as special apent of
the United States Treasury he is em
powered, without recourse to the Ha
waiian courts, to enforce the provision
of the Newlands resolution wherein it
says: "There shall be no further"im
migration of Chinese into the Hawaiian
Islands, except upon such conditions as
are now or may be hereafter allowed
by the laws of the United States; and
no Chinese, by reason of anything here
in contained, shall be allowed to enter
the United States from the Hawaiian
Islands." These nien are bona-fide
residents of Hawaii, who. %ifter an' ab
sence of twelve months, have returned.
These continual test cases make us all
long for a settled form of government
good, bad or Indifferent
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1898.
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN MURDERED AND HER BODY CREMATED.
HOT SPRINGS, Ark., Dec. 14.â Gradually the mystery surrounding the
disappearance from this city several weeks ago of Mrs. Nellie J.
Home, a beautiful young woman who was visiting the health resort,
and who, the authorities believed, was murdered by young Hardy Sheffield
and robbed of her money, is being cleared up, and Hardy Sheffield is in Jail
charged with murder.
The Sheriff returned to the city to-day from the home of Sheffield's
brother, in Hot Springs County, where it was reported the body of Mrs.
Home had been found. He brought a sack containing grewsome evidence
that a human body had been cremated piece by piece in Sheffield's house.
The sack contained human bones, ashes and other articles recovered from
the fireplace. Experts are at work making a scientific examination of
these ghastly relics, and it is already established that the bones are those
of a human being.
Sheffield's brother, in whose house the crime is supposed to have been
committed, was brought to Hot Springs by Sheriff Williams and placed in
jail, as were also several others who are charged with being accessories to
the crime. Some startling developments are expected.
MAY TAKE CHARGE OF HAVANA BEFORE JANUARY 1.
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â A Washington special to the Herald says: There
is reason to believe the administration contemplates suggesting to the
Spanish Government that the United States take charge of Havana
before January 1, in order to stop such disgraceful brawls as are constantly
occurring. It is intended by a naval demonstration to show to the world
and the Spaniards and Cubans in Havana the intention of the United States
to preserve order. While no instructions have been given to Rear Admiral
Sampson or Commodore Philip to land marines the senior officer will de
cide in the event of any further riots whether foreign interests demand the
landing of an American force. It is proposed to maintain a strong naval
force in Havana harbor and Cuban waters generally from now on, and it
would not be surprising if additional ships were sent to the island soon.
It is understood the officers of American men-of-war will adopt every pre
caution to prevent any miscreant repeating the Maine catastrophe. The au
thorities have been informed of the raising of all mines in the harbor, but
they believe it will be the part of wisdom to observe the utmost precaution.
MEXICAN BORDER MAY BECOME PARADISE FOR CRIMINALS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â Unless the unexpected happens the United
States and Mexico will be without an extradition treaty on the 13th
of next month. The situation promises to be one of gravity and
the Mexican border is likely to be a paradise for fugitives from justice and
criminals of every description until a new treaty can be agreed upon. Mex
ico denounces the existing treaty because our Government refused to de
liver up on extradition proceedings certain Mexicans who had escaped
across the line and were accused by their own Government of various of
fenses of a criminal character, but who, it is asserted, were really wanted
for political reasons. The case of Guerra, who was involved in one of the
periodical raids across the border of New Mexico, organized by the leader
Garza, caused the break.
Mr. Clayton, United States Minister to Mexico, is endeavoring to make
a new treaty, but with the serious difference in principle between the two
governments as to whether a case like Garza's is political or revolutionary
or the act of a brigand, his task will be difficult.
ONE MILLION SPENT IN FEEDING THE CUBANS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.-Since the cessation of hostilities this Gov
ernment has spent about $1,000,000 in feeding the starving Cuban*
and the work is still going on with untiring vigor. The Comal about
which there was a dispute over permitting the entry of supplies which It
carried, took 1,200,000 rations to the province of Havana. T\e Batten JZ
Port Victor carried 1,000,000 rations each to the starving Cubans and the
Comal is now at Savannah with 1.200.000 rations, and will be ready to sail n
a day or two. It is estimated that these rations cost in round nimThV
$1,000,000 Besides this, about 5.000.000 were left at Santiago after the cam
paign before that city, but have been used by the American troops aZ
distributed among the Cubans. The distribution of rations is now \Zt
on wherever American forces are found in Cuba, as there is a standing order
issued by the Secretary of War to dole out the rations to the Cubans whfn
ever application is made for them. wnen-
RED CROSS NURSE SHOOTS AND KILLS HIS BROTHER.
NEW lORK, Dec. 14.-John D. Hayes, who served as a Red Cross
nurse with the Second United States Infantry under General Shatter
at Santiago, last night shot and killed his brother, Edward Hayes oro
prletor of a hotel at Bleecker and McDowell streets. Apparently no one wit"
nessed the shooting. According to the story told by John Hayes his
brother accused him of appropriating some of the hotel funds for his own
use. They had several quarrels over this, and, according to the murderer
who is under arrest, Edward attacked him with a club and icepick After
having his cheek laid open John Hayes drew a revolver and shot his 'brother
through the head. The wounded man fell without a sound and was dead
In a moment, the blood pouring from a hole in his left temple and drenching

MANY DEATHS FROM NEGLECT
STATEMENT MADE BY A RE
TURNING BED CROSS NURSE,
Could Save Dozens of Lives on Five
Cents a Day, Though the Gov
ernment Makes Liberal
Provision.
Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Dec. 7.â The Scandia
arrived yesterday morning from Ma
nila, having sailed from there on No
vember 15. She brings a number of
officers, ninety-one discharged and fur
loughed men and two Red Cross nurses.
She brings the largest mail that ever
left Manila, 213 sacks for San Francisco
and one for Honolulu. She will sail
for San Francisco on or about Decem
ber 10.
One of the returning Red Cross
nursea said: "Scores of the soldier
boys are dying in the hospitals at Ma
nila for want of proper nourishment.
They say the Government allows 60
cents a day for each patient. I could
save dozens of lives on 5 cents a day.
Oh, the utter woe of the hospitals, the
helplessness of them. Men as bright
and noble as God ever made, giving up
to death, hoping for it, seeking it, tak
ing poison, doing anything that will
end the despair that comes upon them.
"Seeing nothing before them but days
of pain and nights of wretchedness,
without proper care, without proper
food, with no one to give them sym
pathy, to write to friends, to soothe
aching brows or moisten parched lips,
if by sheer endurance of nature or ob
stinacy of vitality they do get better
there is before them nothing but the
still more cheerless period of convales
cence with the probability of relapse,
and the old weariness of despair to be
suffered again. No wonder there are
six or seven funerals a day. No won
der the dead house is never empty.
"And outside the hospital and even
in it, such indifference. Petty consid
eration of rank and position, squabbles
about precedence, lack of consideration
in prescribing and preparing food,
while men are dying, not merely of
hearthunger, but for want of nourish
ment.
"I have gone through the wards day
after day, and as I spoke to this one
and that, and they poured out their
sorrows, men who do not wear their
hearts on their sleeves cried from pure
agony of their loneliness, and despair,
made poignant and vivid by their own
telling of it.
"I got so I simply could not go
through the wards. What could I do?
I saw the need of care, of proper nour
ishment,, of the most ordinary hospital
treatment, and was utterly helpless to
do anything; just one cog in the great,
remorseless, grinding machine whose
material was noble men and whose
grist was death."
Miss Schaefer was one of the first Red
Cross nurses to go to Manila. She went
from here on the Arizona, arriving at
Manila on September 26. She returned
as attending nurse to the sick among
the ninety wrecks of robust manhood
who are returning as invalided soldiers.
She went a strong woman in good
health. She left Manila November 15
weighing fifty pounds less than when
she started from San Francisco.
"I do not mean that all in the hospi
tals are careless or Indifferent," she
continued. "Many are trying to do
their best. There is a lot of worthiness
and unselfishness among the attendants
at the hospitals. But there is so much
Inexperience and so many clogs to
those who would do- much. To think of
an attendant going through a ward
with a pail of beef broth, ladling out
to the fifty or sixty patients indiscrimi
nately a tin cup full of it. In the whole
pailful there was not enough nourish
ment for one, even if it were made of
the best material. But what it really
was made of I shut my eyes and refuse
to imagine. In a whole-ward there is
not more than one nurse of experience,
and for helpers only one or two awk
ward boys who perhaps never saw a
sickroom before. Do their best and
what can, they accomplish? Let no one
speak slightingly of the women who
have lately gone on to Manila as army
nurses.- Any woman who works as she
will have to work if she goes into the
tents at all will deserve the tear of the
recording angel which will blot out all
she may have transgressed in the past
or all she may be guilty of in the fu
tttfo "

has guaranteed to Perry S. Heath, First

associates that he will issue the char

Campbell and himself are interested as
soon as Congress extends the territor

be very soon.

BEATEN BY SALOON-KEEPERS.
J. P. Quigley the Victim of a Barroom
Fight and May Die From His
Injuries.
J. P. Quigley is lying unconscious in the
Harbor Receiving Hospital, suffering
from a beating administered by Joseph
Trautmann, proprietor of a saloon at 630
.day street, and Mark Hoffman, his bar
keeper. His wounds were dressed by Drs.
Diggins and Zabala, who say the man's
Injuries may prove fatal.
The story of the affair as told by Traut
mann and Hoffman is to the effect that
Quigley came into the saloon yesterday
afternoon and after drinking went over
to the lunch counter. While Quigley was
standing there a hanger-on about the
saloon informed Trautmann that Quigley
had a number of drinking glasses in his
pocket, evidently stolen from the counter
when the barkeeper's back was turned.
Trautmann accosted Quigley and at
tempted to take the glasses away, when
the latter rebelled, catching the proprie
tor by the throat. Hoffman sprang to his
employer's assistance and pinioned Quig
lpy's arms behind him, while the glasses
were taken from him.
They then tried to throw him out. but
he resisted, and after a brief mix-up
Quigley fell to the floor unconscious.
Officers T. Furlong and J. E. Maloney
placed Trautmann and Hoffman under
arrest, charging them with battery, and
sent Quigley to the hospital.
Trautmann and Hoffman were released
on bail.

Warm to McKinley.
NOTABLE SPEECH AT ATLANTA
LAST TRACE OF SECTIONALISM
HAS BEEN WIPED OUT.
Presidential Party in Attendance at
the Peace Jubilee Receives a
_lost Enthusiastic
Welcome.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 14.â The Presi
dential party arrived in Atlanta at 8
o'clock this morning over the Southern
Railway. The weather was more crisp
than most of the party anticipated.
Small groups of early-rising Georgians
watched the train as it flew past the
wayside stations. At Gainesville,
where a short stop was made, about 200
persons were at the station and in
spected the train with curiosity. From
there on to Atlanta there came waving
welcomes with an occasional cheer, but
there was nothing in the nature of a
demonstration.
At the Union depot, in Atlanta, a
large crowd was assembled and a
rousing cheer went up as the train
came to a standstill.
General Joe Wheeler was the first to
alight. A strong chorus of cheers
greeted the distinguished Alabaman,
who, accompanied by the members of
the reception committee, made his way
to a carriage. When the President ap
peared on the rear platform of his car
a hearty cheer was given him. The
welcome to the members of the Cabi
net was very cordial. The ladies of the
jubilee committee extended a greeting
to the ladies of the Presidential party,
after which the President and those ac
companying him were escorted to the
Kimball House.
The party included the following:
President and Mrs. McKinley, Secre
tary of the Treasury and Mrs. Gage,
Secretary of War and Mrs. Alger, Sec
retary of the Navy and Miss Long,
Postmaster General and Mrs. Smith.
Secretary of Agriculture and Miss Wil
son, Secretary to the President Porter
and Mrs. Porter and Mr. Barnes, ex
ecutive clerk; Major General Joseph
Wheeler and Miss Anna Wheeler, Ma
jor General Henry W. Law ton and Mrs.
Lawton, Captain Scherer, U. S. A., Dr.
P. A. Rixey, U. S. N.
A few minutes before 1 o'clock the
President's party was assigned to car
riages and, escorted by fifty mounted
police and the members of Governor
Chandler's staff, started for the capitol.
Upon his arrival at the capitol he
was greeted with a field artillery salute
and was at once escorted to Governor
Chandler's office. There was a short
informal reception there. Upon its
conclusion the President, followed by
members of the Cabinet, was conduct
ed to the Assembly chamber, where he
occupied the Speaker's chair with Gov
ernor Chandler on his right.. When
President Dodson of the Senate called
the Legislature to order the galleries
were thronged with men and women.
The Speaker rapped for silence and in
troduced the President to the audi
ence. As the President rose the audi
ence applauded. During the course of
his short speech Mr. McKinley referred
often to his notes and constantly
paused for cheers to stop. A scene of
intense enthusiasm followed when,
amid impressive silence, these wor.ds
fell from the lips of the President:
"Every soldier's grave made during
the unfortunate civil war is a tribute
to American valor. And while, when
those graves were made we differed
widely about the future of the Gov
ernment, those differences were long
ago settled by the arbitrament of
arms â and the time has now come in
the evolution of sentiment and feeling
under the providences of God. when, in
the spirit of fraternity, we should
share with you in the care of the
graves of the Confederate soldiers."
A wild cheer went up from every
throat in the audience, a cheer that
echoed and re-echoed throughout the
chamber until it was taken up by the
crowds outside. Old men who fought
for the South rose from their seats and
waved their hats. One Confederate
veteran, now a venerable legislator,
had pressed forward until he was lean
ing against the Speaker's deck, hang
ing on each word the President ut
tered. When the reference was made
to the Confederate dead this old man
buried his head in his arms and while
cheers rang out cried like a little child.
Of all the many conciliatory speeches
which have been made since Grant
said, "Let there be peace," nothing has
more deeply stirred a Southern audi
ence than the simple words of Presi
dent McKinley.
General Wheeler followed the Presi
dent, and was received with wild en
thusiasm.
Generals Lawton and Young spoke
briefly and received a warm welcome.
The session then adjourned and those
present were presented to the Presi
dent.
The prettiest and most novel event of
the day's festivities occurred during
the afternoon. It was a floral parade
in which all the people of the city took
part, and the first of its kind ever given
in the city. The President and his es
corts preceded the parade to the re
viewing stand, at the corner of Peach
street and Ponce, de Leofl avenue. As
each carriage passed the stand the oc
cupants saluted the President and
waved flags, to which the executive re
sponded graciously.
To-night the members of the Capitol
City Club opened their clubhouse to the
President and guests of the city. The
occasion was notably brilliant. The re
ceiving party consisted of a number of
Atlanta's representative women and a
large company of club members. The
decorations were flags, American smilax
and American beauty roses.
Deserted His Little Ones.
A sad case of desertion has been re
ported to the officers of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
According to the statement of Mrs. Sarah
Vogelsang, she and Mark Vogelsang for
several years past lived a peaceful exist
ence in Usal, Mendocino County. Three
children came to bless the family. A few
weeks ago the husband and father fled
and the woman has no idea where he has
fone. In the hope of finding him in San
ranclsco she came to this city and be
gan a fruitless hunt that only exhausted
her scant funds. Not until starvation
stared the little ones in the face did she
apply to the society for relief. This has
been afforded, but the woman is in sore
need of help.

Shasta County throughout Tuesday
night and until 8 o'clock this morning.
The sky remained cloudy until late in
the afternoon, when a mild wind set
in from the north, with indications for
a clear-up. Snow fell in the moun
tains, reaching quite low on the foot
hills. The precipitation will help the
farmers some, but will do the placer
miners little good. Should a hard freeze
set the snow, followed by further
snowfall, plenty of water in the moun
tains would be insured for the summer
of 1899.
RED BLUFF, Dec. 14.â When the
rain flag was hoisted by the Weather
Bureau here yesterday morning, and
the observer announced a rain
for last night and to-day, there were
many who were skeptical. But the
rain came and oame "a-plenty." Up
to 9 a. m. nearly an inch had fallen and
the outlook is for more to come.

DEMANDS AN
INCOME TAX
Action of the Labor
Federation.
ENGLISH DELEGATES SPEAK
URGE CLOSEE RELATIONS BE
TWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.
A Resolution Adopted Protesting
Against the Passage by Con
gress of the Anti- Ticket
Scalping Bill.
Scecla.l Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 14.â
Speech-making consumed the morning
session of the third day of the annual
convention of the American Federation
of Labor. The delegates listened with
Interest to talks by William Thorne
and William. Inskip, delegates from the
British Labor Congress, and to a re
sponse -thereto by President Samuel
Gompers.
Mr. Thorne said that labor should
strive continuously for better organiza
tion and- more power- in politics. Dele
gate Inksip urged not only a stronger
organization, but a stronger friendship
between American and British unlon
istÃ. What was needed, he said, was
not only a federation of trades organi
zations, but a federation with our Eng
lish-speaking cousins. The sentiment
was warmly cheered.
President Gompers said, in the course
of his remarks, that there was some
times apprehension as to the condition
of ' the workers of our country. A
greater percentage of mechanical la
bor, outside the agricultural element,
he said, were organized in America
than on any part of the globe. While
he declared that unionists were active
in defending their principles in politics,
Mr. Gompers nevertheless urged in
creased activity along this line.
Upon the employment of women Mr.
Gompers said: "The American Feder
ation of Labor has always stood for the
organization and recognition of those
women who are compelled of necessity
to work. But we do demand now and
we must always demand equal pay for
equal work." Mr. Gompers paid a warm
welcome to the English delegates and
declared that the closer the two Eng
lish-speaking nations came together in
fraternal alliance the speedier would
approach the era of universal peace.
At the forenoon session a resolution
presented by Adrian M. Jones of Chi
cago protesting against the passage
of the anti-scalping bill, recently
passed by the House of Representa
tives, was adopted without discussion.
A copy of the resolution will be Bent to
each United States Senator.
The income tax resolution offered by
J. S. Kent of Nebraska was not adopt
ed, hut this substitute was unanimous
ly indorsed: "Resolved. That the
American Federation of Labor is of
the opinion that the decisions of the
Supreme Court on the income tax are
not fn accord with the constitution or
the spirit of the American people, and
that this Federation demands of Con
gress a law making a tax on incomes
a feature of federal taxation."
Convict labor came in for a share of
the convention's attention. The reso
lutions condemning convict labor, by
C. W. Coy, were referred to the exec
utive council with instructions that it
take such steps as may check its en
croachments upon the interests of the
honest working people of the land. The
convention emphatically reaffirmed the
boycott on the American Tobacco Com
pany, declaring it to be a monopoly
and a trust, and to be under the ban
of organized labor.

EXTRA SESSION
OF CONGRESS
ON CURRENCY
Sentiment in Favor of
Prompt Action.
VIEWS OF LEADING MEN
REPUBLICANS SHOULD REDEEM
THEIR PLEDGES.
The Best Interests of the Nation
Demand Legislation to Reform
the Money Sys
tem.
The eentlment of California as ex
pressed by leading public men and intelli
gent bankers who have Btudled the money
question is positively in favor of na
tional legislation to bring about currency
reform. The judgment of the majority
of business men of large affairs is that
an extra session of Congress should be
called by the President. Argument is ad
vanced that the important questions relat
ing to currency reform should be consid
ered apart from other issues, and not be
thrown into the general discussion of
topics springing from the war. An arti
cle published in The Call of Tuesday last
engaged the attention of the commercial
community and elicited many expressions
of opinion on the subject.
Committed to
Currency Reform
Ex-Senator C. N. Felton Holds
an Extra Session Should
Be Called.
Ex-Senator Charles I*. Felton is out
spoken in favor of an extra session of
Congress to consider the currency reform
question. He says: :.-â ;,:â¢.-; i
"The Republican. party, realizing that a
reform of the currency is essential to the
best interests of the nation, is committed
to action on the, question. In my opinion
the sooner the action Is taken the better,
and that by all means in a session of
Congress called for the purpose. In no
other way canit receive the undivided at
tention requisite for. a wise conclusion."
â¢ â 
An Extra Session
by All Means
Congressman-Elect Julius Kahn
Strongly Favors the
Proposition.
Congressman-elect Julius Kahnâ l am
in thorough accord with the idea pro
mulgated in The Call's editorial of Tues
day. I have always believed It necessary
to hold an extra session of Congress to
settle the currency question and give the
legislation upon it a good, fair chance to
operate before the national election of
1900. The great trouble with this country
is that it does not give time for a settled
policy to become fixed before Congress
meets again and changes of such magni
tude are made that the original legisla
tion is nullified. If an extra session be
called by the President, and I trust that
it will, the currency question would prob
ably be settled inside of three months,
and then there would be over a year be
fore the next ensuing elections; within
which time the new laws would have had
a chance to operate and the administra
tion would be in a position to know just
what defects exist and how to remedy
them. Whereas if legislation is delayed
until the regular session, before it is fairly
tested the elections of 1900 will be held.
The newly elected Congress would then
begin to tinker with said legislation so
that the entire effect of it would be lost
to the nation.
What the Interests of tho country de
mand at the present time is stability.
The constant tinkering with tariff arid
financial legislation causes our merchants
and manufacturers to refrain from mak
ing any large investments, and conse
quenty the laboring mail, the mechanic
and, in fact, all our people suffer more or
less. By all means let us have an extra
session to settle the momentous question
of currency reform.
Stable Currency
Begets Prosperity
Extra Session Meets With the
Entire Approval of Banker
I. W. Heliman.
President I. TV. Heliman of the Ne
vada Bankâ l am of the firm opinion that
the President should call an extra session
after next March to settle for all time
the most important question of the cur
rency. We want stable money, for no
country can have permanent prosperity
without It. Every civilized nation on
the face of the globe is to-day on a gold
basis. Semi-civilized countries like China,
South America and Central America are
the only ones left on a silver basis.
Wherever that currency exists labor is
degraded and the people are in a poor
condition generally.
Our soldiers in Manila, Cuba and Porto
Rico have had a splendid object lesson on
the benefit of sound money and the need
of proper financial legislation. Every dol
lar of our money brought them *2 20, and
when they return to us they will not be
in favor of a depreciated currency, be
cause they have realized the benefit of
our money.
By an extra session of Congress legisla
tion can be enacted for the United
States to remain permanently on a gold
standard, and that menace of the free and
unlimited coinage of silver can be forever
silenced and destroyed. This subject Is of
moment not only to the bankers but to
the whole business community as well. A
stable currency begets prosperity, and
the question is of sufficient magnitude to
warrant the calling of an extra session for
its consideration.
a
Currency Reform
Is Imperative
Warren Olney Says If an Extra
Session Will Bring It About,
Let Us Have It.
"Warren Olneyâ l heartily agTee with the
proposition of legislating on the subject
of currency reform, but I am not pre
pared at the present time to state that
the conditions are of such a nature as to
warrant the calling of an extra session
for so doing. I lean somewhat to the
opinion that postponing the considera
tion of the question may bring about more
by natural growth than if special action
were taken upon it. The trend is such
that currency reform Is coming very soon
by the inevitable progress of events,
whether a special session be held or not.
There is danger in extra sessions ot going
into matters that ought to be left alone.
I am not an adherent of over legislation,
and extra sessions have not been bene
ficial in the past. I am inclined to think
: that better results can be obtained at the
regular session of Congress in December.
I don't know, however, but that the ad
vantages of an extra session would out
weigh what we old veterans are inclined
to anticipate from such a course. There
Is no doubt that attention would be cen
tered on the subject if an extra session
is held. It would be a wonderfully great
educating influence, and possibly we
would after all obtain tÃe Dest legisla
tion that way. Good currency legislation
will restore confidence, -and if an extra
session -will carry out those conditions
then let us have It, for we will thus re
alize a direct benefit.
I am satisfied that the silver craze is
rapidly dying out and will never again be
a vital issue before the country. The
party that goes against the natural laws
of finance, if I may use that expression,
will be ground to powder. Let this Gov
ernment follow the example of the lead
ing nations of Europe and provide fqr a
stable currency, but not by the issuance
of Government bills, as at the present
time. Let legislation be of such a char
acter as to throw such safeguards around
our currency as to render it invincible.
Should Be Settled
Without Delay
Ex-Mayor Pond Holds That the
Party Pledge Should Be
Fulfilled.
Ex-Mayor E. B. Pond entertains positive
opinions on the subject of currency re
form. He says: "The currency system
ought to be settled without delay. The
promise made by the Republicans to the
people of the country should be redeemed.
In my judgment, an extra session of Con
gress, if necessary, should be called to
legislate upon the question. The adjust
ment should be madÂ© before the next
Presidential campaign. The gold Demo
crats expect a prompt solution of the
monetary question. They voted for Presi
dent McKinley on this ground, and they
have the right to urge that the promise
made to the voters shall be redeemed.
The Republicans, having a majority in
Congress, are responsible. The sound
money men expect that measures will be
taken without unnecessary delay to re
form the currency."
Foreign Policy of
the Government
Banker P. N. Lilienthal Is Not
Able to Judge Whether An
Extra Session Is Demanded.
P. N. Lilienthal, manager of the Anglo-
California Bank, believes that a perma
nent settlement of the monetary policy
of the country is desirable. He says:
"The currency question ought to bo set
tled, but whether an extra session of Con
gress ought to be called for that purpose
is another proposition. I am not able to
judge whether an extra session will be
required. Again, it must be taken into
account that man$ r questions of vital im
portance growing out of territorial ex
pansion may arise. Legislation in this
regard may assume so much importance
that an extra session bearing on the so
called foreign policy of the United States
will be demanded. I am not competent,
therefore, to judge what the interests of
the country will require. The currency
question, I admit, ought to be settled; but
whether it should be disposed of at an
extra session as the tariff question was
is another matter."
Settlement in
Regular Session
Thomas Brown Fancies an Ex-
tra Session Is Not
Needed.
Thomas Brown, cashier of the Bank of
California, says: "The question of cur
rency reform ought to be settled, but it
is not of sufficient importance to justify
an extra session of Congress. The ques
tion might be settled at the regular ses
sion of Congress next year."
Â»
An Advocate â¢ .
of Sound Money
Manager Grecnebaum o? the Lon-
don and Paris Bank Favors
Immediate Action.
Sigmund Greenebaum, manager of the
London, Paris and American Bank, is an
advocate of sound money and the immedi
ate adoption by Congress of a sound
money policy. He says: "The set
tlement of the currency question in
a proper manner will be beneficial to
the farmers and laborers, as well as to
the merchants. An extra session of Con
gress may not be required to settle the
question, "but it should be called if it be
comes necessary to the settlement. There
Is only one way to settle the monetary
policy for the good of the country, and
that way is to recognize sound money."
A Fair Degree
o? Prosperity
Banker James K. Wilson Doubts
the Advisability of Agitating
the Currency Question.
James K. Wilson, president of the San
Francisco National Bank, holds that the
promise of a sound currency should be
fulfilled, but doubts whether the inter
ests of the country would be benefited by
un<iue agitation of the question. He Bays:
"We are enjoying a fair degree of pros
perity at present, with indications of a
larger measure or prosperity. Agttation
of the currency question, such agitation
as an extra session of Congress on the
subject would cause, might alarm the
holders of money. When monetary legis
lation is discussed money hides away"!
Unless the holder of money is a broad
minded man of affairs he is apt to Keep
his cash idle, pending the settlement of
monetary issues. In my judgment a cur
rency reform measure in accordance .with
the pledges, made in the platform of the
successful party should be passed by
Congress, but I am not prepared to say
that an extra session should be called."
An Extra Session
Should Be Called
Governor Budd Holds That the
Currency Should Be Con
sidered Separately.
Governor Budd maintains that Congress
should settle the money question. He
says: "An extra session ought to be
called to consider currency reform. In
the 'hurly-burly' of a regular session,
pending, the monetary policy of the Gov
ernment cannot be properly considered.
Now the tir.ie of the regular session will
be taken up in the consideration of ques
tions growing out of the war. The dis
cussions will be animated, earnest and
perhaps bitter, by reason of wide diver
gence of opinion. In my judgment the
subject of currency reform should not be
thrown into the discussion when the
minds of members are engrossed in con
sidering the settlement of war issues. It
is desirable that stability should be given
to the currency of the country. An extra
session should be called to consider the
question of reform in our currency, and
the adjustment should be permanent as
far as possible under our institutions of
government. The Republicans pledged
in their platfrom that they would bring
about the desired reform, and by so pledg
ing gained the support of many gold Dem
ocrats. It is now the duty of the Repub
lican party to redeem the pledge."
Question of Vital
Importance
Victor Metcalf, Congressman-
Elect, Favors Prompt Settle-
ment of Vexatious Problems.
Victor Metcalf, member of Congress
elect from the Third District, advocates
prompt action. He says:
"I consider the money question one of
vital importance to the people of this na
tion. If not disposed of at this session
of Congress I believe that the best in
terests of this country would be sub
served by calling an extra session for
the purpose of permanently settling this
vexatious problem."

MEETING OF THE
DEMOCRATIC
COMMITTEE
State Organization in
Session.
â â â â â â
HEARST'S PLAN CONSIDERED
GALLAGHER AND FAY IN A
"i; WORDY SET-TO.
Some Small Embarrassment.: Caused
by the \Jnexpected Absence
of a : Few of , the \ "
â¢ â¢./Members, -â¢
A meeting: of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee was held at the California
Hotel yesterday afternoon, pursuant to
a call Issued about two weeks ago. It
was generally understood that the pur
pose of the meeting was the discussion of
a plan of reorganization of the party in
the city and State In accordance with a
proposal made by W. R. Hearst, pro
prietor of the Examiner.
Those present at yesterday's meeting
were J. L. Gallagher and Charles W. Fay.
In the absence of Chairman Mann, Mr.
Gallagher called Mr. Fay to order. The
secretary of the committee being absent.
Mr. Fay assumed the duties of the office,
and having called the roll found that Mr.
Gallagher was present. A slight delay
was occasioned by the non-arrival of
Treasurer Bart Burke, who has a great
head for figures and who knows the exact
amount of the deficiency that Mr. Hearst
is to make good in case he is allowed 10
reorganize the party on "not only raised
but nailed" lines. As soon as it became
apparent that Mr. Burke was at his home
in Santa Cruz Mr. Gallagher appointed
Mr. Fay to act as treasurer. Mr. Fay's
first official act was to fine Mr. Gallagher
25 cents, the same to be expended on
refreshments for the crowd. Mr. Gal
lagher, as chairman, remitted the fine,
but Mr. Fay appealed from the decision of
the chair and succeeded in making good
his contention by a vote of 1 to 0.
Mr. Fay created something of a Btir
in the meeting by introducing a motion
to the effect that no smoking be allowed
during the proceedings. A vote was
taken, which resulted in a tie, there being
1 aye and 1 no. A long and acrimonious
debate followed, which ended In a com
promise being effected by Mr. Gallagher
agreeing to allow Mr. Fay to smoke the
latter half of the cigar that started the
controversy.
A stir of expectancy swept over the as
semblage when Mr. Gallagher called Mr.
Fay to the chair and took the floor.
Mr. Fay rapped for order, and by way of
a precautionary measure stated that no
disturbance of any kind would be per
mitted. He then appointed Mr. Gallagher
to act as sergeant-at-arms and. instructed
him to preserve order. This course had
the desired effect, and as soon as order
had been restored Mr. Gallagher asked
permission to address the meeting. When
it was granted he said:
"Mr. Chairman, I move we adjourn
When the ripple of excitement that fol
lowed tnis speech had subsided, Mr. Fay
in "Do e ii d hear a second to the gentleman's
m There being no second to the motion it
was declare!! out of order. Mr GaJs-
Kher resumed the chair and Mr Fay
Claimed the floor on a question of per
sonal privilege. He referred to the motion
he had previously made regarding the
right of members to smoke during the
progress of the meeting. He then called
attention to the fact that the time had
arrived when his rights under the adjust
ment that had been made should be ac
corded him. , .Jr.' yJ
Mr Gallagher suggested that the mat
ter of the member's rights in the prem
ises be submitted to an arbitration com
mittee of two. of Which the chairman
should be a member. This was agreed to
and Mr. Gallagher appointed Mr. Fay as
the other member of the committee. A
recess of five minutes was then taken in
order to give the commute time in which
to meet and prepare Us report.
Mr Gallagher called the arbitration
committee to order. He then called the
attention of his fellow member to the fact
that there was very little left to arbitrate,
and that unless Mr. Fay had a cigar
holder an award in his favor would be
of small value- There was no combating
the logic of this argument and Mr. Fay,
wno is trying to stop smoking anyway,
consented to drop the' matter until the
question of the reorganization of the
party had been finally determined.
When the Central Committee reassem
bled Mr. Fay called the roll and found
Mr. Gallagher still present. Mr. Gal
lagher stated that in the event of two
members claiming the floor at the same
time he would decide in favor of the one
nearest the seat provided for the use of
the secretary-
Mr. Fay caught the eye of the chair
man,'and upon being recognized ex
plained that on account of the unavoid
able absence of Mr. Tarpey and others he
wns in favor of postponing the matter of
the reorganization of the. party until after
Judge Maguire has finished his self-ap
pointed task of reorganizing Father
Yorke. This seemed to meet with general
approval. Mr. Fay then moved that the
hall rent be charged to the deficiency that
Is to be assumed by Mr. Hearst. There
being no objection it was so ordered. Mr.
Gallagher then declared the meeting ad
journed until the robins nest again.
CUSTOM HOUSE DRAYING.
Manager Fuller Denies the Statement
Made by a Pair of Discon
tented Brokers.
"W. H. Fuller, manager of the Over
land Transit Company which does the
draylng for the Custom-house, is wroth,
over the statement of two brokers to the
effect that his company la not making
Its deliveries expeditlously. He would
like to ascertain the identity of the brok
ers for the purpose of convincing them
that they are mistaken. Mr. Fuller says
the delay in delivery of the cargo on
the Shangtung was caused by the break
ing down of the boilers in the basement
of the Appraisers' building, thus stop
ping the freight elevators for ten days.
He asserts that whenever the permits are
issued his drays promptly deliver the
goods, and that the complaints of the
two brokers are blasts of wind through
holes in their hats.
DENNERY OPENS HIS FIGHT.
Contests the Election of R. Porter
Ashe, State Senator-Elect.
Leon Dennery, confident that he was
counted out at the recent election, con
tests the right of R. Porter Ashe. who has
been declared elected to represent the
Twenty-fourth Senatorial District in the
next Legislature. Dennery filed his
grounds of contest with the County Clerk
yesterday, and the matter has been sub
mitted to Justices of the Peace Kerrigan
and Groezinger.
Dennery avers that Ashe was not le
gally nominated by the Democratic party
for the office of State Senator and his
name was printed as a candidate without
authority of law; that Ashe was not a
resident of the Twenty-fourth District for
one year next preceding his election; that
his certificate of nomination was not
properly filed; that Ashe and his friends
expended money far in excess of the
amount allowed by law; that contrary to
law the voting booths were opened be
fore sunrise and closed long after sunset;
that votes for Dennery were counted for
Ashe. and, in fact, the defeated candidate

STRUCK BY A TRAIN.
B. L. McDonald, a Laborer, Seriously
Injured on Channel Street.
B. L v McDonald, a laborer, was struck
by the return train from Ingleside late
yesterday afternoon and seriously in
jured. He was removed to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where Dr. Rinne found that
he had sustained a compound fracture of
the left leg, a contusion of the left elbow
and a fracture of the jaw. O. E. Alger,
the engineer, was afterward arrested and
charged "with battery. He was subse
quently released on his own recogniz
ance by order of Judge Joachimsen.
According to several eye-witnesses of
the accident, McDonald was walking
along the outer track on Channel street
when, in attempting to get out of the
way of a freight train, he ran in the way
of the incoming train. Fortunately the
train was going at a slow rate of speed,
otherwise he would have been killed.
COMMISSIONERS ARE THROUGH.
City Hall Will Come Formally Into
the Supervisors' Hands To-Day.
The mission of the City Hall Commis
sioners is almost finished. The last roof
ing that was covered over the big pile ex
hausted the available funds, and to-day
the Commissioners are ready to turn tho
building over to the Board of Supervisors
and San Francisco will come formally
into possession of its own.
Since the passage of the law authoriz
ing the construction of the building over
$6,000,000 has been spent In its construc
tion, and local history tells that a goodly
proportion of that sum is represented in
numerous San Francisco fortunes rather
than in the building itself.
The hall is not yet built to the full in
tent of the original specifications, but the
Commissioners have decided that It is not
Just the right time to go to the Legisla
ture for more money, and the building
will be turned over as.lt is.

Jealousy Was ths Causa.
The police are convinced that Mrs. Sel
inger was murdered by her husband.
Last evening Detectiv-e Wren had an in
terview "with Selinfcer, but he refused to
commit himself. At times he raves as it
his mind was giving way under the strain,
but the police are inclined to believe ho
is shamming insanity. The neighbors of
the dead woman say that her husband
was jealous of her, even to the extent of
accusing her of being- too friendly with
other men. A boy named Rossor heard
the couple quarreling the night before the
murder. Selinger. who seemed to be in
a rage at that time, threatened to shoot
his wife.

still others want street nets, while all are

The moving spirit of the idea in this

nnd the result was a call for a convention

"The crying need of the municipalities
of California," said Mr. Druffel yester
day, "is clearer it' not better Jaw for (he
Jittle places. The acts ihat have been
passed in this relation have brought no
relief, but instead in every case have been

HAD A WINE APPETITE
Frank Ricardo Charged With Swindling a
Number of Liquor Dealers,
FRANK RICARDO, whose
appetite for champagne
caused him to be arrested
on several charges of
misdemeanor, still lan
guishes In a cell in the City
Prison. Yesterday his case
was called in the Police Court,
and again continued. It is said
that other and more serious
charges will be placed against
Ricardo in a few days. His
alleged schc-me was to tele
phone to some grocer, and
after representing that he was
connected with the Press Club
or some other well-known or
ganization, order a case of
champagne. He would remain
outside of the club building
until the grocer or his clerk
showed up with the wine, and
after signing for it inform his
victim that he would settle the
bill the following day. Ricardo
would then take the wine to
his room, where he and his
friends would drink it. He
became so bold in his opera
tions that the police were no
tified and a concerted effort made to catch him.
(Mi November 17 Goldberf?. Bowen & Co. received a message from
the Cosmos Club for a sudplv of wine. Suspecting that the message
came from Ricardo, they at once telephoned to the California-street
station for an officer. The wine was given to a messenger boy to be
delivered, and accompanied by the policeman he started for the
headquarters of the club.
In front of the building was Ricardo waiting for the boy. He was
promptly placed under arrest and taken to police headquarters.
Since then the police have ascertained that he has worked at least a
dozen Srma in the same manner.
Another scheme of his was to telephone to a well-known club,
and after representing that he was a certain member, order a number
of bottles of wine sent to his room. He successfully worked this
scheme on several clubs.

is glad to get back. He left Manila on
November 15 on the Scandia and came to
Honolulu, where he took the Australia.
Captain Murphy does not hesitate to say
that the regular and volunteer troops are
opposed to the annexation of the Philip
pines, which ho declares will be a post of
isolation and one that will require great
diplomacy on the part of this Government
to hold and keep out of .trouble with the
other powers.
He has only words of praise for Colonel
Smith of the First California Regiment.
Captain Murphy says Colonel Smith is
considered one of the most efficient officers
now in Manila. At present he commands
the Second Brigade of McArthur's di
vision.
The health of the troops Captain Mur
phy says is bad. When he left, out of a
garrison <>!' 13,500 men, 1000 were in the
hospital and ximi were sick in quarters,
making over 14 per cent of the entire gar
rison unable to do duty. Much of the
sickness Captain Murphy attributes to
the exceses of the men. who eat and
drink anything they wish. He says It re
quires great care on any person's part to
keep in good health in Manila. The place
is full of malaria, and the soldiersâespeci
ally the volunteersâ do not seem to take
care of their health.

man and Rood and the policeman took
him to a bedroom and put him to bed.
Shortly after the policeman woke- him
up and took him back to Rood's saloon,
where he was compelled to take $73 and
was told to get away from there as
quickly as possible. He later went to the
Seventeenth-street station and reported
the case.
August Schwartz, clerk in the Valencia
Hotel, and Special Officer D. Murphy cor
roborate the old man's story In regard to
Blackman and Rood being with him and
being warned by Blackman to keep their
mouths shut. Both Blackman and Rood
deny their guilt, Blackman asserting that
It Is a case of mistaken Identity and Rood
asserting that the old man only gave him
$75 and he has witnesses to prove It.
Rood has only been in the saloon business
for a month, having previously been em
ployed as special officer by the Milkmen's
Association. Blackman has been on the
force since October 6, 1891. January this
year he was fined $50 by the Police Com

CAVALLO WAS
SOMEWHAT OF
A SURPRISE
Turned Up a Winner
at 30 to I.
SLOPPY GOING AT INGLESIDE
RENO TOOK THE PALACE HOTEL
STEEPLECHASE.
Morellito Was First in the Handicap.
Lord Marmion Had His Old-
Time Specd â Favorites Four
Times First.
As a rule some very warm things In
the racing line are unloaded in umbrella
time at the tracks, and between splashes
the crowd at Ingleside yesterday indulged
in some fancy gambling. The going was
sloppy, but not until the final number did
the expected long shot come to life. Then
Cavallo, with George Snider up, tripped
in first, backed from 30 down to 10. Four
of the other events fell to favorites in the
betting.
The Palace Hotel handicap for timber
toppers over the short steeplechase course
was the special attraction offered. It was
a noisy and very nervous betting thing.
Reno, this time ridden by T. Murphy, the
best of Andy Blakeley's aggregation,
finally closed favorite and won after mak
ing all the running. San Carlos was a
good second. Huntsman came to grief at
one of the jumps, shaking Shepard up
badly. While he was recovering the ani
mal was remounted by J. Boyd and took
third money. Jazebel was heavily played, i
but at the far corner jump both horse and
Jockey, Ellison, came to grief. It was a
sad accident; both escaped without in
jury. The more we have of these steeple
chase arrangements the more popular rac
injj will become in Manila when ti.at
country becomes civilized from a sporting
standpoint.
Barney Schrelfter's filly Good Hope was
the heaviest played of the two-year-olds
in the opening scramble. Ward messed
matters about, getting up In time to fin
ish second to Clarando, a 4VÂ« to 1 chance,
ridden by Jones. Banewor was third.
Ed Corrigan's gelding Major Hooker
captured the mile selling run for maidens
in a common gallop, with 7 to 2 offered
and refused about him. Sokombeo got the
place from the fast-coming Majesty.
The mile handicap was a good betting
event, resulting in Morellito being sent
to the post favorite. Mat Storm's very
useful colt headed his company on the
back stretch and led Topmast out by six
lengths in 1:42^. Morlnga took the show
honors from Highland Ball.
J. McManus' brown colt Lord Marmion
was possessed of all his old-time speed,
and th<; seven furlong run was easy for
him. He was a 6 to 5 chance, and made a
runaway race of it. Hard ridden, David j
Tenny secured the place from First Call/
Everybody bet on Wyoming to win the
last event, and, backed from 6 to 5 to 7 to
10, the big horse ran third. The outsider
Cayallo got up the last sixteenth anu in
a drive led Gratify out by a length or
more.

CHAMPIONSHIP GOES
TO BELMONT'S TEAM
The Lowell High School Succumbs
After a Hard Game Fought Out
in the Mud and Rain.
Belmont G, Lowell 0.
In mud and diminutive lakes the Bel
mont eleven wrested a victory from the
I,owells yesterday and thereby decided
the championship of the Amateur Aca
demic league for the football season of
IS9B. All the enthusiasm that the stu
dents of either institution could get to
gether was bottled up, carried to Recre
ation Park and let loose from time to
time In yells and whoops and screechings
unholy.
The mud of the gridiron wast of a soft,
oozing, mucilaginous consistency, which
soon destroyed all differences of facial
characteristics and left the players brown
plastered individuals. Tearing down tne
field the Belmonters by a ska,te or two
in the mud and by a stiff sidestroke
through the lakes carried the ball to
Lowell's one-yard line. But this was as
far as - Belmont went. A fumble at the
most critical moment . gave the pigskin
to the San Franciscans and it was kicked
out of danger. Neither side scored in the
first half.
In the second half the fierce playing be
gan.' Both teams wanted victory from the
soles of their wet feet to the crowns of
their mud-caked heads, and heavy marsh
and sea fighting was the order of the
battle. Back and forth the rushers ragei
until Belmont had the ball on the five
yard line of Lowell. Again were they
held and the High School boys got the
ball. It was passed to Hooper for a punt
out of danger. Hooper's drive was low
and the Belmont rushers broke through
blocking the kick. A mass of human mud
fell on the ball and Belmont had the only
touchdown of the day. Story kicked &
goal and the score read 6âo, at which it
stood until the close of the game.

THE WAR STAMP TflX CASES,
IF United States Circuit Judge Morrow desires to ren
tier the public a service in connection with the war
revenue stamp cases, which were submitted to him
en Tuesday, he will not let them get tangled up with
the application of the Attorney General to the local
c>u:!> for a writ of mandate. As in all cases where
attempts have been made to force the express compa
pay their war taxes by mandamus, the pro
ceeding of the Attorney General involves jurisdic
tional questions entirely foreign to the main issue.
! thoc suits have actually been dismissed
without ever reaching the merits of the litigation.
The Attorney General has already been turned down
by the State Supreme Court, and his application for
mandate to the Superior Court, having been trans
ferred to Judge Morrow's tribunal, cannot in the na
ture of things uive rise to anything but a debate over
whether or not the Federal courts can issue man
damus to compel the performance of duties enjoined
by State laws. While this is going on the public is
paying the war tax and the express companies are
paying attorney^ fees.
We do not positively assert that the people are be
ing robbed in this matter, but five courts have al
ready so decided, and the Attorney General of the
United States, one of his assistants, and the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue, have agreed' with
them. What the people now want Judge Morrow to
do is to tell them frankly whether or not he thinks all
these gentlemen have taken a correct view of the law.
The people have great faith in his legal learning, in
tegrity and perspicacity, and whatever he says upon
the subject, irrespective of what the Gircuit Court of
Appeals may say, will go far toward satisfying them.
In other words, the people look to Judge Morrow
to decide the question submitted in the Benhatn and
Johnson cases immediately.
Whatever the result, probably an appeal will be
taken, but Judge Morrow need not consider that. The
controverted point has been placed squarely before
him in the cases referred to, and the litigants are en
titled to the benefit of his opinion. If it shall turn
cut that in his judgment the patrons of Wells, Fargo
& Co. are required by law to pay this war tax. they
will have the satisfaction of knowing that the subject
has received the careful consideration of another con
scientious jurist, entirely free from embarrassing law
points and jurisdictional questions.
There is another point in connection with the
mingling of the Bcnham and Johnson cases with the
Attorney General's application for mandate which
should be considered. Mr. Fitzgerald retires from
office on January 2. and his successor. Mr. Ford, may
take an altogether different view of the law. He may
conclude that mandate is not the remedy and aban
don the ca=e. Judge Morrow should not await the
event of any such contingency as this. If the war
revenue law requires Wells. Fargo & Co. to pay this
tax. the people of Calfornia are being robbed of up
ward of $10,000 a month, and it is important that a
conclusion should be reached as speedily as possible.
When a man's pocket is being picked he is anxious to
know whether or not the process is legal. The
fleeced patrons of the express company will sleep bet
ti r after Judge Morrow rules, even though he rule
against them.
MR. MAGUIRE'S LONG RANGE LETTER
JUDGE MAGUIRE has written a very longi
tudinal letter to Father Vorkc, who is many
meridians of longitude distant, on the subject
of the hitter's appearance in the recent campaign.
All that Judge Majxuire puts in this too. too long
letter is summed up in the statement that it is to ius
ti;y his book on Ireland and the Pope, in which he
calls the Pope "the serpent of the Vatican" because
he forbade Irish priests to take a part in poli
tics. Maguire contended that the priests should be
free to go into politics. But in the same letter he
roundly abuses Father Yorke for going into politics,
and says. "I have a feeling, and a strong feeling,
against clerical interference in politics."
From all of this tiresome torrent of words we arc
only able io gather that Judge Maguire believes in
clerical interference in politics when it is for his side,
but when it is against him it is an outrage.
As he has lined up with the Pope in deprecating
political interference in politics, let him take to him
self also the reptilian character he ascribed to Leo
XIII and then quiet himself.
The Chronicle publishes an excellent picture of
somebody and labels it "General Brooke." As it
represents a good-looking man, Brooke has no rea
son for complaint.
So many young women jump from ferry-boats as
to suggest that the crew keep watch and essay to
cherk the manifest tendency to climb the rail.
THE SA]S" FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1898.
TbJE VfILUE OF THE PHILIPPINES.
OX December 2 this news telegram was sent
from Vancouver, B. C: "Advices from New
South Wales say that the steamer Culgon has
sailed from .Sydney with a cargo of provisions for
Rear Admiral Dewey's ileet at Manila. The cargo
consists of 5000 carcasses of mutton, 250 of lambs, 81
tons of onions, 125 tons of potatoes and 22 tons of
carrots."
This reminds the country not only of the incapacity
of the Philippines to furnish a food supply for our
navy and garrisons, but that the islands belong to a
different and distant system and lie nearer to other
productive countries than to us. This supply of food
for our navy is the first expansion of commerce felt
since we demanded possession of that archi
pelago, but it does not expand the trade of
San Francisco. Its benefits go to Sydney and
to the stock men and farmers of Australia,
while our stock men and farmers pay the taxes which
buy the cargo. The New York Tribune, commenting
on it. says: "The Philippines are 7000 miles away,
far nearer to other great powers or their possessions
than to us, and belonging to the commercial and
geographical system of another continent."
Their conquest presents features repugnant to
American sentiment and antagonistic to American
prosperity. What they produce in sugar, hemp, rice
and tnbncco enters into direct competition with the
production of American farmers, while climate and
distance seem to forbid that American farmers shall
supply ever, the army and navy stores needed to feed
tlic large force by land and sea which must watch and
tend them.
If we can force labor in the cane fields of the Phil
ippines as Spain did, those fields can readily crush
out sugar production at home. What that will mean
may be estimated by a study of our beet sugar pro
duction in the United States.
There are over twenty beet sugar factories in this
country, which produce this year 120,000,000 pounds
of refined sugar. In 1894 only five of these were in
operation, and their production was only 44,886.000
pounds. The industry has flourished and advanced
here faster than in any other country where it has
been established. In 1889 its production was only
4.000,000 pounds; the increase since then is 116.000,
000 pounds, in nine years.
It took France twenty years to reach a production
of 100.000,000 pounds of beet sugar. We have exceeded
it in nine years. This has been done by free, white, vol
untary labor in the fields and factories. It has added a
valuable crop for rotation to American farms.
The Republican platform of 1896 said: "We con
demn the Democratic administration for not keeping
faith with the sugar producers of the United States.
The Republican party favors such pr6tection as will
lead to the production on American soil of all the
sugar which the American people use, and for which
we are sending abroad annually more than $100,000,
000 to foreign countries."
The soil of the United States in 1896 was conti
nental soil. The labor to produce thereon all the
sugar consumed by our people was American white
labor, paid at white rates.
That party pledge is not kept by going forth on the
altruistic warpath and coming home loaded with spoils
in the shape of tropical islands, which can produce
every pound of sugar we use, which can do this with
the involuntary labor of the tropics, paid on a scale
that would starve voluntary white labor at home.
Well may the American farmer and laborer ask
what stake they have in imperialism when it obsoletes
the use of. their land and destroys the wages of their
labor, without even the compensating advantage of
furnishing mutton and potatoes to our imperial mili
tary establishment, required to hold our new posses
sions in subjection.
Perhaps no part of the country is hit harder by this
policy than California. The peculiarities of our cli
mate limit annual crops for rotation. We have much
soil adapted to the sugar beet that is not fitted for
other annual crops until beet culture has subdued its
refractory elements. The beet came to us as a reve
lation and blessing. Wherever sugar factories have
been planted community life has taken on a fresh im
pulse, lands have acquired a new value, commerce
has extended its operations and its profits, and the
commonwealth has gained. If all this be canceled
those responsible for its destruction will have a day
of settlement with the people.
OUR WINE IN MEXICO.
WE publish this morning a story from the Two
Republics of the City of Mexico to the effect
that thirty-three barrels of California wine
consigned to a dealer in that city have been seized re
cently by the Government officials and condemned on
the ground that the wine contained an admixture of
salicylic acid, which the Mexican authorities regard
as dangerous to health.
The story is given by the Two Republics with con
siderable detail and need not be repeated here. It
sufiices to say that the dealer in whose hands the wine
was seizedj makes no complaint of unfairness on the
part of the officials, but, on the contrary, declares that
an analysis made at his own instigation after the
seizure confirms the report of the officials and proves
that they were right in condemning the wine.
It is to be noted that the Two Republics adds that
the dealer who suffers in this case is not "the first
victim in Mexico of the contemptible business prac
ticed by California shippers in doctoring young wines
with salicylic acid." It gives the name of another
wine importing house that had a similar experience
about seven months ago, though not to so great an
extent as in the recent case.
This is a severe charge to be made against our wine
shippers, and it cannot be too promptly investigated.
The assertion that some of our dealers make a "prac
tice" of doctoring young wines with salicylic acid,
coming from a journal of such circulation as the Two
Republics, will seriously injure our trade unless it is
refuted, or the dishonest dealers so thoroughly ex
posed that they can no longer injure the general wine
trade of the State.
The importance of the issue can hardly be over
rated. Our wine industry is an expanding one. and
there is urgent need for an expanding market. Mex
ico and the other Spanish republics to the south of
us offer good opportunities for such a market, as
their populations are large consumers of wine. To
sacrifice that market for pure wine for the sake of
lotting some dishonest dealers make a profit out of
doctored wines would be a commercial blunder of the
first magnitude.
The issue is another phase of the old subject of pure
food laws. California is so large a producer of the
class of food articles known as luxuries, such as wine,
fruit preserves and olive oil, that she is seriously in
jured by every sort of food adulteration, and; unfor
tunately, their name is legion. A multitude of oils,
preserves, jellies, jams and wine, adulterated with
every mixture that cunning can devise arid greed make
use of, are sent abroad bearing California labels.
Against these our producers of pure foods and wines
have to contend, and the contest is a hard one.
However difficult it may be to deal with the prob
lem as a whole, it seems clear that in the special case
reported by the Two Republics something might be
done. The article gives the names of the dealer in the
City of Mexico and the shipper from California. The
opportunity for an investigation is therefore open.
The State Board of Trade, the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, and the two associations
representing the wine industry and trade of the State,
should see if they cannot devise some system of pre
venting such wrongs as that complained of and pro
tect the credit of our wines in the Mexican market.
BEYOND THE REACH OF LOW.
EVERY day intensifies the belief that in the
School Board are men who .are rogues, whose
proper place would be the penitentiary, and
fitting garb the stripes of felons. The wantonness
and brazen impudence of their sinning cause aston
ishment to mingle with indignation, for they go about
unmolested, and in their faces is seen no blush of
shame. They act as those having no fear of conse
quences.
Perhaps this latter condition of mind is nothing
strange. When a set of men elected to high office de
liberately and systematically begin robbing the com
munity which had trusted them; when the result of
their villainy is made palpable through depleted funds,
unpaid teachers, schools suffering for supplies: when
there are authentic tales of bribery and plain evidence
of corruption in other directions, it would appear at
first glance that the people would be given an oppor
tunity at least of securing the poor redress of seeing
punishment meted out.
There is no sign that the recreant Directors will be
made to suffer nor to disgorge their loot. The Grand
Jury, a body organized for the discouragement of vice,
tackled the godless outfit, questioned, probed and
dropped the matter. Now we are gravely informed
that an indictment under the one-twelfth act would
not stand. Even so. are there no laws against theft?
Is not bribery a crime? Is conspiracy to rob no
offense to be dealt with? The public may accept as a
sorry fact the condition that this rotten board is to
escape punishment, but it will decline to accept it with
â an approving smile, or to believe that a larcenous
School Director is more entitled to immunity than is
the footpad, the burglar or the pickpocket, either one
of whom, as a member of the present board, would be
in a congenial atmosphere, cheek by jowl with those
of his own kind.
NOSTALGIA IN ThfE PHILIPPINES.
WITH signing of articles of peace there is no
doubt the lingering glamour of war departed.
The boys who sailed from this port last
June shouting their enthusiasm are homesick now.
They sigh lor the cool, green hills of California, the
breezes sweeping in from the sea, the banks of fo.g
billowing in through the Golden Gate.
Nobody can blame them. They are in an unlovely
land, where the climate is laden with malady, the food
not adapted to the needs of people of a temperate
growth, the work hard and onerous, devoid of glory,
remuneration or hope. They feel that they have done
their full duty. One of the soldiers, an ardent and
patriotic American, among the first to enlist, and who,
with the other brave boys, faced Spanish fire and did
not flinch, writes to a friend on the staff of this paper:
"Get my discharge and transportation HOME.
Army life in the piping times of peace is several dis
tinct and well-defined kinds, sorts and conditions of
hell."
Without doubt this .represents the general feeling,
and, as it does so. there cannot be haste too great in
sending regulars to the relief of the volunteers. For
the most part the regulars are in some measure sea
soned. They are commanded by experienced officers,
and have acquired the knack of making the best of
every situation. Moreover, few of them have gone
into the service under the impulse of sentiment. To
them the army is a business and a means of liveli
hood They would go without repining wherever or
dered, and stay without regret, while their peril from
disease would be minimum. When men are thor
oughly homesick the ailment becomes physical. They
are unfitted for resisting actual disease, and they lose
ambition.
Perhaps a little brush with Aguinaldo would cheer
the boys up, but in the absence of a definite prospect
cf this, the most cheering message possible would be
one calling them back where friends and royal wel
come wait their coming.
LESSON OF THE NEW YORK FIRE.
AS a result of the great fire in New York, in
which were involved two tall buildings â those
of the Home Life Insurance Company and of
the Postal Telegraph Company â there has been an
extensive discussion in the East as to the comparative
advantages and disadvantages of the modern sky
scraper in case of fire.
The test to which the tall structwes were submitted
in New York was an extraordinary one. The fire
started in a five-story building which was full of in
flammable material. The wind was blowing a tre
mendous gale, equal to a speed of sixty miles an hour,
and the flames from the burning building were car
ried directly, with all the fierceness of a blast furnace,
against the walls of the Home Life. It appears the
windows of the Home Life were not provided with
iron shutters, and the flames were driven through
them to the interior woodwork. Yet the building
stood, the walls were not affected, and the iron work
was apparently not injured sufficiently to require any
considerable rebuilding. The Postal Telegraph build
ing escaped with very little damage.
The day after the fire the Chief of the Fire Depart- j
ment was quoted as having stated that no building !
should be higher than 150 feet, as it is impossible to j
protect tall structures, bnt on the following day, after \
a full examination, the Chief of the Building Depart
ment of the city stated that if it had not been for the '
two tall buildings the fire would have swept the whole i
block as far south as St. Paul's Church.
The discussion that has followed shows that the
weight of authority agrees with the statement of the
Chief of the Building Department. Indeed the con
clusion seems to be that the Home Life was not an
entirely up-to-date structure, and that, had it been so,
it would have stopped the flames at once. The tall
building seems, in fact, to be a protector to all the
property around it. It prevents the spread of flames
and localizes any fire that breaks out adjoining it. The
consensus of Eastern authorities on the subject is
that a tall building, modern in every respect, is vir
tually fireproof, and, as the Philadelphia Inquirer says,
"to destroy one of them, judging -by the New York
fire, would be next to impossible."
One of the Botkin witnesses from Delaware has
been frightened by the loud tones of Attorney Knight,
and not unnaturally. But in California that voice has
lest its power to intimidate and subdue.
There is not so much evidence that the Chicago
Aldermen experienced a moral reform as that the idea
of devoting their unhallowed persons to the decora
tion of lampposts was not pleasing
A GREAT INDUSTRY MENACED
The Two Republics, a newspaper published in the English language In
the City of Mexico, and having an extensive circulation, contrv â ' in Its
issue of December 6 a story to the effect that thirty-three barrels of Cali
fornia wine consigned to a dealer in that city have been seized by the official
wine inspectors on the ground that the wine contained salicylic acid, a sub
stance regarded by the Mexican authorities as dangerous to health.
As the story was published in the Two Republics it is safe to say it has
been published also in most, if not all, the Mexican journals, and it goes
without saying that the incident will be used by wine dealers of other
countries to discredit California wine in the Mexican market. The issue is,
therefore, one of vast importance to the State, and particularly so to all
persons engaged in the wine industry, whether as producers or dealers.
The great interests at stake justify a thorough investigation of the sub
ject by the State Board of Trade and the two associations that represent
the wine producers and wine dealers of California. We invite their atten
tion to the story, which as published in the Two Republics is as follows:
Thirty-three barrels of California wine consigned to Federlco Navarro, the
well known and popular young commission merchant and importer, have Just been
seized by the wine gaugers employed by the City Health Department on tne
ground that the wine was found to contain salicylic acid, a substance declared oy
Mexican authority to be dangerous to health. And that is not all the miscnier
which the recklessness of the Californians who shipped the wine have done Mr.
Navarro, for his customers are returning him all the same kind of wine he has
sold them before, in order to avoid seizure of the same on their premises and nne
and imprisonment for having adulterated wine in their stock of merchandise.
These returns amount to from one to ten barrels in each case. A few or Jir.
Navarro's customers have indeed already fallen under the law by Having stocK
purchased from Navarro seized. They are all looking of course to him tor re
dress. The measure taken by the authorities is stern, but entirely just, and only
the natural result or' the recklessness of the California shippers, who are in tne
habit of adding salicylic acid to very young wine to age it in order to be able to
class it as a higher grade. .
Mr. Navarro was seen last evening by a representative of the Two Repub
lics and freely admitted that the authorities had done nothing but what was
right in the premises, as the analysis made since the seizure by his own instiga
tion fully concurred with that of the health officers, and the wine should never
have been brought to Mexico.
"I associated myself," he stated, "with a couple of young business men in L.os
Angeles. Cal., for the importation of wines from that locality into Mexico, reel
ing convinced that with the display of push and energy a very good market could
be built up for the California product. We were just beginning to reap some
profit from the venture when It seems the exporter from whom we bought in
the best of faith conceived the diabolical idea to increase hia profits by J-h'P
ping us a doctored article instead of the pure article to which we were entitled
as we agreed to pay a higher price than is paid for any California wine brojgnt
to this city In carioad lots. The shipper in this case is Mr. "vV oollacott, and the
wrong he has caused is almost irretrievable, as he has not only cast discredit
upon the California wine business but also exposes myself and others to \er>
serious consequences. The law regarding adulterated articles is very strict in
Mexico. It does not only provide for the seizure and destruction of the adulter
ated articles but also imposes heavy money fines and imprisonment upon tne
unlucky merchant who offers the stuff for sale, not taking into consideration
whether or not the respective merchant was aware of the adulteration. 1 trust
that Mr. Woollacott is not personally responsible for the adulteration and that
he can make a satisfactory explanation of the fraud which has evidently been
committed, but thero is no doubt as to his responsibility from every standpoint
for the great wrong committed and thn costly damage done. I had just settled
the freight and duties on the shipment, amounting to $2120, which is, of course a
total loss. Upward of $2600 of outstanding accounts cannot be collected now be
cause the people who owe them are returning to me all the stock left on their
hands. Others who do not owe are returning their stocks also and are looking to
me to make good their losses. The value of the wine confiscated amounts to
about $3500. Of course I cannot now ostimatethe money damage this whole busi
ness has caused, but it is very considerable."
Mr Navarro is not the llrst victim in Mexico of the contemptible business
practiced by California shippers in doctoring young wines with salicylic acid.
Carlos Hirachberg head of one of the oldest wine importing houses in the city,
had a similar experience about seven months ago, though not on so large a scale,
as the seizure extended to only a few barrels, a sample shipment, and he was able
to stop a carload that was on its way. In that case the wine had been bought
from a sample which had been analyzed and found to be absolutely pure. Mr.
Hirschberg pot off with the payment of wines for himself and several custom
ers, whose poods bought from him had been seized, by showing his own absolute
innocence and that the shipper alone was to blame.
It is very much to be hoped not alone for the sake of Mr. Navarro but also
in the Interest of American trade with Mexico that Mr. Woollacott or whoever
else has been guilty of defraudinK Mr. Navarro and his customers by shipping
doctored instead of pure wines will make all restitution in his power, and that the
California win* 1 shippers will adopt some sort of system to protect their cus
tomers and their trade against the infamous fraud that has been practiced in
the present case.
The seizure has extended only to clarets, the Zlnfandels, RelsllnÂ«R, Muscatels
and Angelicas imported by Mr. Navarro being free from any admixture.

GAS WILL BE CHEAPER.
First Test of the New Opposition
Company Made Successfully.
The first test of the Equitable Gaslight
Company, the new corporation that has
been founded for the purpose of compet
ing with the San- Francisco I Gaslight and
Electric Company, was made yesterday
afternoon ' at the headquarters of the
plant at the foot of Hyde street, on the
site of the old Selby Smelting Works. The
exhibition of the power of the new com
pany and the many advantages to be de
rived to patrons of it was complete in
every detail, and was made before the
prominent business men of the 'commu
nity and many other invited guests. By
an improved* process the new company
can supply its subscribers with illumin
ating gas at a uniform price of $1 a thou
sand, cubic feet, which is 50 p,er cent less
than that now paid to the San Francisco
Gas and Electric . Company. In addition
to this reduction in price the gas sup
plied is far superior to that now used by
the public, as it is thoroughly purified
by improved machinery before it is al
lowed to : enter the mains traversing the
various sections of the city. '
In the process of manufacture gas is
used almost exclusively. It is burned in
the furnaces and afterward extracts it
self, as it were, from the coal.
As an exhibition of the quality of the
gas that will bo supplied to the public in
the near future at a rate much below
that now paid, a number of the various
lamps and burners supplied and used by
the San Francisco Gaslight Company
were placed for inspection before the vis
itors. The light as shown is > far supe
rior to that seen around the city both ii<
brightness and steadiness. The im
proved burners made specially to produce
a brighter and fuller light now supplied
to stores, etc., by the San Francisco Com
pany were also tested with perfect satis
faction. Where the patrons of the old Las
company pay an exorbitant price for the
use of gas through these burners the new
company makes a reduction in their us^
of j almost 50 per cent on the price now

NOW HELD A ROYAL PRISONER
RUSSIA IS ASSUMING CONTROL
OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
Grave Problems Now Confronting
England and America and a
Big War May Soon
Be On.
Among the^rurstr at the Occidental who
arrived on the seamer City of Peking,
is O. i"nx. He i om< from China
registered from Peking. Mr. Cox is
on Englishman and was b irn In Austra
lia, but hi -' thirteen
years In China, lie is now on his way
i never having y.et visited
that country. Mr. Cox's connections in
\vÂ«n- such that he is In a position
t" be exceptionally well Informed regard
ing the* affairs of that country, and es
pecially is ho well informed concerning
the International question of interest in
China. He talks in an exceedingly modest
manner. His version or the recent over
throw of the Emperor is best told in his
own words. Regarding this he said:
"The Emperor has not been murdered.
He i^ simply held a prisoner as it were
by his mother. He is confined in the
royal i alace. There Is no doubt but that
his mother usurped the reins of govern
ment, for the Emperor did not abdicate.
To me it seems strange that the other
nations recognize her as the lawful ad
ministrator of the affairs of the nation,
when they know that there has been no
formal abdication on the part of the Era
peror. The latter undoubtedly brought
about his downfall because of the radical
reform measures that he advocated. Many
of the high officials of the empire were in
the reform move with the Emperor, and it
might have been successful, but some one
of them, with the usual duplicity .of the
j race, gave the scheme away and the
Emperor's mother took immediate charge
and made things hot for the reformers.
â¢â¢The Emperor wanted to introduce
Western customs. He advocated the
wearing apparel of the white man and he
Treated his subjects to dock their queues,
and this was more than the Chinese
would stand for. Chang Yin Huan, for
mer Minister to the Court of St. James,
and who also attended the Queen's Jubilee j
where he was knighted, was one of the
reformers, and but lor the intervention of
Sir Claud Mac Donald he would have lost i
his head. As it was he was banished !
from the empire. Another high official
escaped by taking refuge on a British
warship. Tnere is no doubt but that, these
: prising reformers would have made
a clean sweep if their plans had succeed
ed. I believe that their zeal would have
led th^m to a free use of the ax, but their
following was not strong enough, so they j
failed.
"The most serious and at the same time !
tho most interesting question to the Eng
lish and Americans in China at present
i.s the attitude of Russia. There is no use
denying the fact or trying to disguise
the stern reality that Russia practically
controls the Chinese Government. This
must lead to international dissensions,
an*i I look to see in the next two years
a his war between England and Russia.
Something has to be done, for if affairs go
on as they have been Russia will control
the city of Peking in two years. England
and America are not looking after their !
interests as they should. Russia controls j
Xowchwang, a treaty port, which is 1
within 200 miles of Peking. In the district
of Manchuria, in the northern part of Chi
na. Russia is building railways. This is
the richest and most desirable part of
- China. While America and England are
' standing by looking on Russia is daily In
creasing her strength. From the port of
Newchwang America gets at least 70 per |
cent of Its China trade. Can this country
afford to allow Russia to control this i
port?
"I am not prepared to say what Eng
land and America combined could do In a \
war with Russia, It would be a hard ;
country to fight. America has no army, i
I admit you can raise a large volunteer
force, but you can't make soldiers in a |
day out of volunteers. Russia has her
best forces in China, and they have got to i
be met by men who have besides mere
bravery the knowledge of how to be sol
diers. The question is a grave and serious
one. and it is being carefully considered
in England. What will be the outcome I

From Australia â La Fontaine

"Cocker" Tweedie, the Australian
lightweight pugilist, who was defeated
at one of the Olympic Club entertain
ments by Jimmy Lawlor, returned yes
terday from the land of the golden
fleece.
Tweedie iÂ« very anxious to have an
opportunity of proving to the sporting
people of this city that he Is a much
better man pugilistically than many of
the local sporting men suppose. He
says that it was through carelessness
on his part that he was whipped by
Lawlor. He is ready now to sign
articles with any man of his weight in
America for a limited contest or a con
test to a finish.
The National Athletic Club hap signed
â¢Charley Tye, the clever pugiiiat of the
Reliance Club of Oakland, and La Fon
taine, a French-Canadian fighter, who
; arrived in this city recently, to box
ten rounds in Woodward's Pavilion on
the evening of the Green-Creedon

La Fontaine is said to be a very stiff

Compromised Their Claims.
The numerous architects who sub
mitted plans for the proposed City and
County Hospital have at last com
promised their claims. Each will receive
as compensation for his services, if the
Board of Supervisors will pass such a
resolution, the sum of $375. This .amount,
however, will not buy the plans. These
will be donated to th^ city free of all
cost. The city will either retain them for
three months or hold thorn permanently.
This arrangement was practically arrived
at yesterday when Supervisor Dodge,
chairman of the Hospital Committee, met
with the architects in the committee
room. The discussion was long and heat
ed, and a few of the architects did not
agree to tm- plan proposed, but it is
thought they will come round before the
final meeting is held on the matter.

WHO CAN KNOCK A "CHINK"
THE GREATER DISTANCE?
The Question Which Has Precipitated a Fierce War
â¢ Eetween the Members cf the Two Police
Squads m Chinatown.
THE war of the highbinders is not the only one being waged In China
town. The police sent up into the Mongolian quarter to put a stop to
strife are at swords' points each with the other. They have organized
their tongs, | ihelr knives, put now handles in their
hammers, and each officer Is a member of i separate knockers' club, the
object of which Is to <!â ; up some brother oil
The fn-een-eyed monster is th>- cause of the war. in which such venom
and bitterness is displayed that it bios fair to exceed in fierceness vie
battlo between the hatchettnen. The question which is agitating the po
lice is which cf th<-m is doing the most work. Each claims that no
one is working but himself, ajid that all the honor due for tlie existing
peace in Chinatown belongs to him. Each confides to his particular friend
that be can smash a door in quicker than his mates, and that when it comes
to knocking down a luckless highbinder found in a raided den the others
c;ii;nut come near him irs the precision with which he lands his blow on
:i of the Celestial's face, and the distance which the
"t hink" la huri'-.i by the force of hip Rood right swing.
itenante Price and Eeola (or ISsola and Price) have charge of the
special Chinatown Bquad. Which la senior in command is In doubt. When
the two lieutenants meet it la rumored that the atmosphere in their neigh
borhood congeals ami huge Icicles form between them. The forded friend
liness exhibited is amusing- to the initiated. Profound bows and Balaams
are given and returned, and one rot knowing would think that "Bill" and
"Fred" *re old cronies, but they are not.
When the Suey Bing-Suey ring trouble Started some months ago Detec
tives Gibson and Wren and Patrolman George McMahon were detailed to
keep peace among the highbinders, but the murders continued. Chief Leos
became wrathy, and being determined that the shooting should be stopped
placed an additional squu.il on duty. This did not exactly tickle the palates of
the three officers :irs! on the ground and there is a decided coolness exist
ing between them, the lieutenants and the members of their posse.
Sergeant McManua also has a thorn in his side. He has regarded
Chinatown as his particular hunting ground, and resents the presence of
the new posse, which Is poaching OH his preserves. It is rumored that the
members of his squad are not exactly satisfied with the sergeant, and that
there is also a split between the officers under him. With but few excep
tions the police on the special squad are bo unfriendly that they hardly
speak to each other.
While this bickering is going: on among the officers of the law the wily
Mongolian smileÃ. Peace reigns at present, but it is only because the
highbinders are not ready to strike. Hatchets are being sharpened and
pistols loaded. When the time is ripe the weapons will be used, and, aid
ed by the jealousy existing among the members of the Police Department,
the hatchetmen hope to escape detection.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THUHSDAY, IXECEMBEK 15. 1898.
THEY WANT THE
MINERAL LANDS
THROWN OPEN
Plans of the Miners'
Association.
13,000,000 ACRES INVOLVED
ALL NOW CLASSED AS '-AGRI
CULTURAL."
The Idaho-Montana Law desired :a
This Stateâ lt Would Bring
Activity and Pros
per, ty.
The proper disposition of the mineral
lands of California that are now held
as agricultural lands is a subject that is
particularly engaging the attention of
th<? California .miners' Association at
the present time. The vast area ( f lands
bearing minerals of various kinds that
are embraced in the grants of the South
ern Pacific Company and others, and
which should be classified as open to the
enterprise of the miner, is the prize the
association is striving to win.
During the last two sessions of Con
| gres? a bill has been under consideration
; to put these lands under the same rules
and regulations as those in Idaho and
Montana, There the conditions are such
that the miner has equal rights with the
farmer or stock raiser, and the results
have proved highly beneficial to the par
ties concerned.
In this State the enterprise of the pros
pector is checked by the fact that if
ho finds a good lead on land classified
as agricultural he must be possessed of
means to go into court and fight for the
right to develop the prospect or abandon
It to his mere fortunate successor. If
the aims of the California Miners' Asso
ciation are accomplished all this handi
cap will be a voided and there will be a
great impetus given to the mining in
dustry.
"The people of California will better
understand this matter when it is known
that within the lines of our common
wealth there are 13,000,000 acres of land
that are now classified as agricultural
that should be open to the industry of tue
man with the pick and shovelâ the wealth
producer; the man who dug out of the
ground the sinews with which the war
of the rebellion was conducted to a suc
cessful conclusion." So stated Julian
Sonntag of the Miners' Association yes
The Peculiar Death of Gaetano
Aleoto, an Italian Fish*
erman.
GAETAXO ALEOTO, an Italian fisher
man, whose home was in Vallejo,
was found dead in the cabin of his
fishing smack near Fishermen's
wharf at half-past 6 o'clock yester
day morning. Carlo Quartarra, an
other fisherman, went on noard to awaken
Aleoto. He found tho hatch closed and
the little cabin stifling with the fumes
from a small charcoal furnace used to
warm the cabin. Aleoto was dead. He
had lighted tho fire and had closed the
hatch on the evening previous for the
purpose of keeping out the cold. Quar
tarra found that the fire had burned out,
and so had the life of Aleoto.
The dead man was ony 21 years old and
â was unmarried.
terday In discussing: the Importance of I
the measure now pending in Congress.
"It is the desire of the mining men of
this State," said he, "that the Govern
ment create a commission of competent
men to classify our lands that are now
In dispute and that the decision of such
commission should be final. This has
been done in Idaho and Montana and the
plan has worked admirably. We cannot
see why the same regulations should not
apply to similar lands in this State. Un
der the application of the Idaho-Mon
tana act the cost was between 3 and 4
cents per acre and there is no reason why
it should be more here. The measure hag
the support of the entire California del
egation in Congress and our organiza
tion is working diligently to assure its
passage. We do not feel confident that
we will succeed at this session, but there
Is little doubt that the bill will become
a law in the long session.
"There are fifteen mining States in this
country and we are confident of our abil
ity to swing every one Into line on this
proposition. Of course, this will take
time, but our interests are practically
identical and we are bound to get to
gether on the proposition to demand the
appointment of a Cabinet officer to at
tend solely to the affairs of mines and
mining. Other countries give to this in
dustry the consideration and support to
which it Is entitled, but the miners of the
united States have been very shabbily
treated in so far as recognition and pro
tection are concerned. Now is the time
to adjust these matters and if the news
papers will stand in with us we will suc
ceed.
"The importance of the mining industry
of this State is not appreciated by the
public. If it were there would be more I
effort to assure it just treatment. There I
re Â°ii n Q 7^ ed . in thls work in California
o\er 19.000 miners, every one of whom is
a consumer. On the one-half basis of the
Chicago census we will estimate popula
tion two to one. At a low estimate each
will consume 50 cents" worth of supplies
each day. This would mean $19,000 per
Jav .â v<?r a half million dollars a month
and between six and seven million dol
lars each year. If this mineral lands bill
goes through this number will be In
creased to 25.000 or 30.000 men, every one
of whom would be a factor in promoting
the welfare of other industries of the
Mate.
mn s }?r? r fea * ure of the situation is the <
modest fart that California mines pro
duced 5G0.000.000 this year which can be
accounted so much contributed 10 the
wealth of the State. With the classifi
cation of the mineral lands many preat
mines would be developed and this im- !
mense output largely Increased. We pro- i
pose to have this recognition and will
keep on fighting until we get it. If it is i
necessary the great copper, silver, oil, !
coal and iron interests can be combined. I
\\lth such an interest brought to bear on !
Congress there can be no doubt as to the I
result. At the same time there should be i
no necessity for such strife to secure rec
ognition for one of the most Important in
dustries of the country.
"We must have a department of mines
and mining in the place of the Interior
Department, which necessarily cannot I
give us the proper attention. In addition
to this the men interested in such enter- '
prises should have the benefit of an offi
cial geographical map, showing the loca
tion of mineral lands, quantity and qual
ity of timber, water supply and the means
of transportation to reach such lands.
Other countries encourage the industry
by such means, and there is no reason
why the United States should not do so. i
There is untold wealth lying in the moun- i
tains of California, and every due en
couragement ought to be given to the I
men who have the enterprise to dig it '
out and contribute to the wealth of the
nation."
The California Miners' Association
hopes to accomplish some good work in
the next Congress, one part of which wJll
be to impress the Government with the
necessity of dredging San Pablo Bay and !
the Sacramento River, which are being j
made shallow by the erosion of adjacent \
lands. If France and Italy had not ener
getically pursued such work their rivers
would now be dry land. It is only a ques- I
tion of a short time when our lawmakers
will appreciate the vast importance of
these matters to the country at large.
The association may find it necessary to
send an able man to Washington to Bet be
fore the coming Congress the necessity
of establishing the new branch of gov
ernment. â _

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â Stocks rose fraction
ally to-day in many cases, while in some in
stances the gains were very considerable. After
an initial hesitancy decided support developed
In many spots. The boom in Americans in
London raused and there were realizing sales
from that quarter, but later became firm.
Sugar was feverishly heavy all day on a re
duction In the product and lost 2U. The de
moralization in this specialty helped the bears
to make an impression after midday and prices
dropped considerably, but actively ceased, as
usual of late, on a break and steadiness de
veloped. Tue VanderbUtS came into proml
riÃnce, Lake Shore rising IS points above yes
terday's price. The strength of that group
sympathetically affected the rest of the list.
Missouri Pacific crossed 46, which perhaps may
be attributed to reports circulated alter the
close that it would come Into possession of
the Chicago and Alton. Western Union de
rlined slightly on Its poor showing for the six
months of the fiscal year. Northern Pacific
â¢was etrong on the expectations of a dividend on
the common, which was subsequently an
nounced. Atchiaon continued its upward move
ment on board-room gossip of developments
expected at next wr-.-k's meeting. Consolidated
Gas, wnose plant Buffered a quarter of a mil
lion loss by accident yesterday, sold off sharply.
The railroad bond mark-t showed Irrtgulnriiy
In spots, but the underlying tone was very good
and mar^cu gains occurred In some Issues.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â The Commercial Ad

There was less business In the market here to
day, but the tone was firm. All Interest cen
tered in Americans. They opened dull under
parity, traders being Inclined to take profits,
then rallied on New York purchases of coalers,
but later New York realized, causing a dull
finish. Spanish bonds were 43H on a report
that the coupon will be paid, 3 per cent in

erable from the bank at 4 per cent on three
days, in view of the impending demands.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
| CHICAGO, Dec. 14.â At the opening and un-
I til after the noon hour wheat showed a good
| deal of firmness. Opening- was 'ie higher. May
advanced under good general buying to Q&%6
6G' 2 <\ Here realizing and some selling against
calls resulted in a reaction to l @66'>ic, .but
about 2 hours from the opening buying became
very good again, and hoisted to 66*Â»c. Early
cables from Liverpool were somewhat disap
pointing, but Northwest markets were strong
and Minneapolis and Duluth receipts continued
to dwindle. Clearances were 865,000 bushels,
large enough to be a bull factor. One decided
ly unfavorable feature was the inability of
shippers to procure cars from the railroads for
I new business. It interfered almost entirely
i with business from this point. After noon the
market became weak. The positive statement
was made that Russia was offering wheat more
freely and that Russian export stocks of un
sold wheat were much larger than expected.
This and the breaking of drought in California
brought large quantities of long wheat into
the market and sent prices down rapidly. Near
the end of the session Liverpool reported se
rious damage to the Argentine wheat crop,
but this had no effect in staying the liquida
tion, and the market was weak to the close:
May declined to 6o%!(2'6ciÂ»ic and closed at 65Â»ic.
Corn was rather dull. The market early
was helped by the wheat strength and higher
cables. As in wheat, the shortage of cars for
shipping business seriously interfered with
cash trading and this in turn depressed the
speculative market. The late weakness of
wheat also had un unfavorable effect, consid
erable corn bought early being put back on the
market. May closed >;c lower.
There was not enough trade in oats to make
an Independent market and prices followed
corn. May closed >Â»S^4c lower.
Provisions were active and quite irregular.
The market opened weak and lower, due la an
other heavy run of hogs, but good local and
outside support caused prices to score a good
advance. Packers were liberal sellers through
out and when the early demand had been sat
isfied the market lost all its strength and
prices slowly declined again. The close was
rather heavy. May pork, 2> c lower; May
lard, 2>^!(isc lower, and May ribs 2 : ii&.'.c lower

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Dec. 14.â The American Wool and
C tton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
w< 1 trade:
A large business has been transacted In wool
during the past week. This Is the result of
liberal purchasing by manufacturers, large and
small. There has also been some buying by
outside parties on speculative- account. The.
purchasing has been of a general character
and some good lines of domestic wools have
been taken. Including No. 1 washed . and un
washed fleeces, medium wools, spring Califor
nia and Texas wools, as well as good-sized
amounts of territory. Pulled wools have also
been conspicuous for their activity.
Prices show no improvement, however; in
fact, sales wore made last week as at low
figures as has been seen this year, and at no
time have fine fleeces sold at as low prices as
were paid for wools last week.
The sale of wools in Boston amount to
3.55,";.00n pounds on domestic and 3,336,000 pounds
foreign, making- a total of 5,219,000 pounds,
against a total of 3,037,000 pounds for the pre
vious week, and a total of 2,544, 400 pounds for
the corresponding week last year.

Waller Scores Superintendent Web
ster and Gallagher Passes a
Compliment or so to Grand
Juryman Irving.
ft wag a warm time from roll call to
adjournment at yesterday's meeting of
the Board of Education. Nearly every
body called everybody else names, and the
fight for the last of the year jobs was
Jim a little bit more than spectacular.
Directors Waller, Gallagher and Head fig
ured rather more largely than any one
else. Gallagher didn't like Irving, Waller
didn't like Head and Head didn't like
any of them, and none spared any words
In Faying so.
Pledges were kept to the teachers
whose names have been for months on
the substitute list. Eight of them were
given schools yesterday and the last two
meetings has cleared the list for the ap
pointments of thirteen, more before the
unhappy last of the year arrives. Four
teachers were taken from the unassigned
Hat and assigned to places that were cre
ated for them by the formation of new
classes. Two were relegated to the un
assigned list for a reason tersely put by
Director Sam Waller, "that the unas
signed list was for the Incompetent, the
non compos mentis and those who were
too old to work." Exception was taken
to Mr. Waller's definition of the list, but
It was only Incidental to the bickerings
and horse play that characterized the re
malnder or the meeting. Wl*
The fun began with the reading of the
minutes. The records of every meeting
since some time in the early part of last
month were to be read, and Secretary
Welch skipped through half of them be
fore he asked for any possible exceptions.
He had got along as far as November
30. when Director Head took exception to
his system, and said that he had some
objections up his sleeve and he wanted
a change to put them in operation. It
transpired that his objections â¢ were on
the mutes Of the 30th. It was at that
meeting that Director Gallagher paid
his compliments in no chosen English to
Andrew Irving, chairman of the Grand
Jury committee on school affairs. Mr.
Gallagher had said that Irving had frac
tured his oath and jeopardized his in
tegrity by giving out to the newspapers
matters that should have been only for
the ears of the jury.! . Mr. Gallagher had
-aid these things, but not with that di
plomacy that is looked for in public
â records, and Mr. Head got up to ask that
all of the Gallagher report be stricken
from the records of the board.
"It was an unwarranted attack upon an
official of a dignified body." said Director
Head "who, I believe, was doing his duty. ,
It was through him that the present dis- i
graceful state of this board's finances was
bruught to our attention and to that of ;
*ur creditors. Mr. Gallagher's language 1
was, to say the least, undignifiedâ it was \
moreâ it- was a flow of billingsgate that
should never be allowed to appear upon
the records of this body. It was the per
sonal opinion of Gallagher himself, and
was of no interest to this board."
Derham seconded and Gallagher got up
to make no pointed defense. Dr. Ragan
tried his best to pour oil on the. disturbed
waters by a modifying amendment, but he
couldn't find a second, and the motion
went through as it was proposed.
A previous engagement kept Superin
tendent Webster elsewhere than at the
meeting, but he had a report in that did
as well in the way of raising another ruc
tion. Mr. Webster has lately been inves
tigating the condition of things at the
schools. Among those he has visited are
Bernal Heights, Garneld, Monroe, Nor
mal, Sherman and others. In his report
he said that at these places he found the
janitorial and scavenger service in need
of harsh criticism at least.
"That's his game, is it?" yelled Waller;
"clearing the boards so that the next
gang can appoint its own janitors on hiÂ«
recommendations. Why isn't he here to
night? He sends his report, but he is too
cowardly to come in here to back it up.
He's afraid to stand for what he has to
Bay, so he sneaks this in."
Gallagher took, the "buck" from Waller
and charged the absent Superintendent
with every infraction of the consolidation
act that he could conjure from his mem
ory, and the row waxed warm until it
was quieted by the politic President Bar
rington. '
However, Waller had been charged since
morning with a roast for some one, and
.somebody or other had to hear it. He
paid his respects to the teachers. He said
they were fools and had put their col
lective foot in their mouth by presuming
to sue for their plundered salaries. He
rsaid that all they could hope to get from
the courts was a decision that their sal
aries were not statutory, while the board
had always admitted that they were. "If
they had waited," said Mr. Waller, "they
â would have got their November pay, any
way. As it is, they are now liable to lose
their December salaries also." Director
Carew also thought that the teachers had

Composition of the Famous New
Food.
: A wide spread interest has been
created ai. ng good livers as to the
composition of Grape-Nuts, the new
food that has come into popular use of
late. It has long been known to physi-
cians, chemists and food experts that
the starchy portion of entire wheat
flour ana barley is transformed into a
true ariu very choice sugar, by the act
of the intestinal digestion in the human
body. This sugar is identical with,
and is known as grape-sugar, and it
is in condition for immediate transfor-
mation I to blood and the necessary
%â â¢ iructurc from which the delicate nerve
centers are built up.
â¢ A food expert of the Postum Cereal

of which grape-sugar - forms the prin-

The n w food has a charming flavor
and can be served 'instantly- either cold
with cream, or by pouring hot milk or
cream over it, one has a hot mush at
once.
MOREHOUSE TO BE RETIRED
The Veteran of the Police Department Tires of
His Job.
POLICEMAN WILLIAM MOREHOUSE, the veteran of the depart
ment, yesterday sent in a written request to the commissioners to be
retired on a pension.
For years Morehouse has been a familiar figure at the crossing of
Sutter and Kearny streets. After being in the service for over twenty-four
years he has decided to lay aside the star and club to seek rest and com
fort In his old age.
Morehouse is now 75 years of ago. He was appointed a member of the
police department on October 9, 1574. Unable to do patrol duty on account
of his advanced years. Morehouse some years ago was assigned to the
crossing at Sutter and Kearny streets. Always gentle and courteous, he
soon gained the respect of the members of the fair sex, many of whom
will sincerely regret his retirement from the department.
It is said of him that he would purposely overlook a woman dressed in
silk to escort her poorly clad sister across the street.
The Pension Commissioners meet on the first of January, at which
timp Morehouse will be placed on the retired list.
Policeman Fred Smith has also asked the commissioners to retire him
on half pay. Smith was appointed a member of the force on April 24, IS7B,
and is 61 years of age. He has a host of friends, who will be pained to'
learn that he is about to sever his connection with the police department.
been hasty in thelfactlon and said that
he feared they had been led into a con
spiracy by which they would eventually
lose their vacation pay through a law
which it is now the scheme to get through
the next Legislature.
On top of all this Mr. Waller showed his
solicitude for the properly pilfered peda
gogue by introducing a resolution direct
ing Secretary Welch to prepare a state
ment of the school finances, which would
be mailed to each teacher. The resolution
passed.
Judge Belcher's recent decision reinstat
ing on the salary roll and in the good
graces of the Directors Mrs. Ball and
Miss Bradley, the teachers who were
summarily fired by the board, will be up
held. A resolution was Introduced yester
day taking them back into the depart
ment, but as there is a good bit of dis
cussion to come up it was held over until
next Friday, when the board will hold
another meeting.
J. J. Gallagher, who has been aaorning
the secondary substitute list, was by spe
cial resolution given a position as teacher
in the Mission High School.
The report of the elementary committee
was brought in by Waller and was adopt

DEAN WILL BE RELEASED.
One of the Nevada Bank Forgers to
Be Given His Freedom.
It Is an open secret around the District
attorney's oince that A. H. Dean of Ne
vada Bank forgery fame will be released
from custody to-morrow. A motion to
that effect will be made in Judge Wal
lace's court and it 1b expected that It
will be granted without opposition.
Both the police and the Bankers' As
sociation are inclined to the belief that
Dean Is the least culpable of the gang.
The conviction of Becker, the arch-con-
Bpirator, waa brought about through him.
as the dangerous forger feared that
Dean's evidence might land him in the
penitentiary for life.
Dean was deserted by Becker shortly
after the commission of the forgery, and
as he refused to return him the amount
he had subscribed to the "defense fund"
of the trio, he readily accepted the propo
sition to turn State's evidence. Dean has
been In prison for over three years.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1898.
MYSTERY STILL
SHROUDS HER
TRAGIC DEATH
No Trace of the Ferry
Suicide.
WHO OWNS THE UMBRELIA?
PARTIES QUIETLY SEARCHING
FOR A MISSING WOMAN.
They Wish to Conceal Their Identity
for the Present, as They
May Be Mis
taken.
The deep mystery which mirroundg the
suicide of the well-dressed woman who
jumped from the upper deck of the ferry
boat Bay City on its trip to Alameda on
Tuesday night, as narrated in The Call of
yesterday morning:, is still unsolved.
Late last night an elderly woman, ac
companied by an escort, called at the
Oakland ferry and tried to learn more of
the facts surrounding- the death of the
unknown. One of the men employed by
the Southern Pacific Company told her
that the umbrella, the only evidence left
Id by the suicide, had been locked up
he night, and as she was laboring
â¢ great stress of mind he described
js soon as she heard that it was a
silk umbrella with a wooden handle
d like a shepherd's crook she
into tears. Her escort tried to com
her. but without success. Through
eon she incoherently bewailed the
jf her darling sister. Out of respect
â ailroad employe did not ask the
and it was not volunteered. The
c thanked the employe and then
he depot,
was learned yesterday that the ac
of the unknown suicide attracted
ittention of passengers previous to
going on the boat. While In the
ng room she moved back and forth
| clenching her hands, straightening and
i unstraightening her hat and removing
and replacing her coat every few minutes
On good authority it is stated that the
glass of liquor that waa carried from the
bar to the upper deck was nat for the
young woman who jumped into the chilly
waters of the bay. An investigation im
[ mediately after the incident decided this
'â  fact, as the person who carried the glass
of brandy voluntarily stated that it was
for his wife. The story that foul play had
taken place was also proved to be a
canard, as many of the passengers- no
ticed that the young woman who carried
; the crooked handled umbrella was alone
This is also borne out by the statement
:of the witness to her rash act, who
swears that no one- was near ncr at the
time.

HONOLULU'S NEW YORKERS
SOLDIERS CHEER THE ALA
MEDA'S STEWARD.
Presentation to Captain yon Oteren
dorp and Chief Officer Rennie
by the Balmain Regatta
Committee.
The mail steamer Alameda arrived from
Sydney, N. S. W., via Auckland, N. Z.,
Apia. Samoa, and Honolulu, H. I. From
the latter port she brought 320 soldiers
of the New York Regiment and the fol
lowing officers: Major Emmett, Surgeon
McCullough, Lieutenants Oliver, Gresham,
Tucker, Boyce, Oothoudt, Wood, Board
man and Captain Ferguson, Sergeant Ma
jor Wright and Charles W. Yeomans.
A number of sick men who were return-
Ing from Manila on the troopship Scandia
did not like the bill of fare on that ves
sel, so they paid their way up on the Ala
meda. They are: Day S. Hutchins,
hospital steward on the Scandia; Sydney
Callan, Thomas P. Davis, Pat Doolay, P.
O'Donnell, Jacob Evans, John H. Grabb,
Isaac Levy, Charles Morton, William J.
McCreedy, Charles Saunders, John Sloane
(from the gunboat Bennington), W. H.
Stroud (from the gunboat Bennington)
and Tom Elllnger. The Scandia was to
leave Honolulu last Saturday, and will
probably reach here next Sunday. She
will bring up the remainder of the New
Yorkers now on the islands.
If the food, served out to the men on the
Scandia was not all that could be de
sired, the soldiers on the Alameda must
have fared well. As soon as the cabin
passengers were landed and the boys
came ashore they sent a delegation
aboard again to bring Chief Steward O.
N. Clark on the wharf. As soon as lie
put in an appearance one of the officers,
on behalf of the volunteers, thanked him
for the royal manner in which they had
been cared for during the voyage, and
then they gave three cheers and a tiger
for Mr. Clark with such vigor that the
onlookers ceased to have any more sym
pathy for the invalids. Then every one
of the soldier boys had to shake the chief
steward by the hand and wish him good
by, so he was a pretty tired man when the
ceremony was over.
Among the cabin passengers by the Ala
meda were John D. Connelly, who for ten
years has been United States Consul at
Auckland, N. Z. ; William Sherer Jr. of
the Winchester Repeating Arms Com
pany and Professor W. M. Woodworth
and C. L. Crehore. The two latter gen
tlemen have been to Samoa in the inter
ests of Yale University. In those islands
there is a wormâ the Falolo wormâ that
lives and dies in a day. Only once during
the year is it seen. Then It puts in an
appearance at sunrise and at sunset dis
appears for another twelve months. Pro
fessor Woodworth and his companion
were successful in studying the life and
death of the worm, and are returning to
Yale well satisfied with the results of
their voyage.
The McKee-Rankin Company also re
turned on the Alameda. H. 3ch ussier
of the Spring Valley Water Company and
Mrs. ScnussTer returned from a visit to
the islands, and W. S. Burzacott, a mer
chant of Sydnoy, came up on a business
and pleasure trip. The Alameda brought
up among her cargo 120 boxes of sover
eigns and 24 boxes of bar gold valued at
J3.510 ,00u. This is one of the largest ship
ments of gold that has come here from
Australia in some time. It represents the
balance of trade between England, Aus
tralia and the United States. Thus San
Francisco sends many cargoes of wheat
to England and England very little mer
chandise here, so that the wheat has to
be paid for in cash. It would be very ex
pensive to send the gold to New York and
then over the continent, so as Autsralia
is always in debt to the mother country
for merchandise, the matter is so ar
ranged that the money the colonies owe
England is sent here to pay for the. wheat
shipped to Europe. In this way everybody
is paid and a month's interest on $3,510,
000 is saved.
A notable passenger by the Alameda
was "Cocker Tweedie, champion bantam
weight of Australia. It will be remem
bered that when Tweeaie was defeated by
Lawler about a year ago he disappeared.
He took his defeat so much to heart that
he got on the Alameda the next day and
returned to Sydney. Since then he has
developed into an actor-pugilist, and lett
the Bland Holt Company to return to San
Francisco to retrieve his laurels. He and
Third Assistant Engineer -.George Brown
of the Alameda are great friends, and
Brown resigned his position as soon as the
vessel docked in order to be with the
champion.
While lying in Sydney harbor the Ala
meda was the flagship at the Balmain re
gatta. The Sydney Isews said of her:
Certainly one of the attractions of the carni
val was the line steamship Alameda acting as
flagship. Despite the fact that the Alameila
was engaged up till midnight of Tuesday In
the grimy occupation of coaling, the steamer
presented an excellent appearance, looking
more as If it had been specially prepared for
a pleasant cruise than If it had been subjected
so recently to the dirty operations incidental
to taking In fuel. Aboard the Alameda was the
genial Commander Van Oterendorp. who. aided
by his officers, did all he could to render the
stay of his vistiors on board as enjoyable as It
could reasonably be made. It Is estimated that
there wore about 2000 visitors to the flagship.
Before the Alameda sailed for San
Francisco the regatta committee, through
the Mayor of Balmain, presented the
captain with a silver fruit dish and the
chief officer with a gold ring as a me
mento of the occasion. On the fruit dish
was engraved: "Balmain Regatta, Prince
of Wales' Birthday, November 9, 1898.
Presented by the Committee to Captain
K. Van Oterendorp, Flagship R. M. S.
Alameda." On Mr. KennFe's ring was in
scribed, "Presented by the Balmain Re
gatta Committee, November 9, 1898."
Both officers were entertained at a lunch
eon after the presentation.
The steamer Alice Blanchard arrived
from Clipperton Island yesterday. She
brought up the Japanese who went down
some months ago to work the guano de
posit, and 300 tons of guano.

REAL ESTATE
STILL SLOWLY
ADVANCING
The Past Week Shows
Progress.
HINDERED BY THE WEATHER
MANY SALES OF ENCOURAGING
VALUE NEGOTIATED.
A Glance at the Records, Recent
Sales, New Building Contracts
and General Realty
Notes.
Real estate Is slowly progressing, not
withstanding the many obstacles thrown
in its way to retard its improving course
from almost absolute business stagnation
to a condition of healthy advancement.
Sales, although not of very encouraging
value, are still Increasing 1 in number
weekly and are maintaining a certain and
uniform value that brings encouragement
to the brokers of the city.
Building, considerng that it is now al
most the dead of winter, Is exceptionally
active. Contracts were let during the
week that exceeded in extent and value
almost the record of two of the past sum
mer months combined. One of the prin
cipal facts that the criterion of percepti
ble advancement is based on is that these
building operations are not confined to
any one section of the city, but are gen
erally scattered over and throughout the
entire city.
The only hindrance to advancement in
the general market seems to hinge on the
continuation of the adverse atmospheric
conditions that wrought havoc in the
"world of realty"' a year ago.
The record of mortgages and trust deeds
was unusually large for the past seven
days and involved an aggregate pledge of
nearly $200,000. The total value of re
leases and reconveyances was slightly in
advance of that for mortgages, amount
ing in all to $228,650.

More Damaging Testimony That the
Rope Was Put Around Lillian's
Neck After Her
Death.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, 1 >cc. 14.
W. A. Brandes will have to itnswer in
the Superior <"<>urt to the charge of mur
g his daughter Lillian. His prelim
inary examination has not yet ended, but
/v\RS.W.A^BP>AMDE=S
Principals in the Sensational Murder Case Now Being Tried in Oakland.
his attorneys have already announced
that they will not i>ut in a defense at this
time.
Dr. J. M. Shannon, who was present at
the examination of the- murdered girl's
body, was <>r. the witness stand to-day.
He followed closely along the line of tes
timony given by Dr. Buteau, and declared
it as his opinion that Lillian died from
blows on the head and not from stran
gulation. Then Mr. Bennett asked:
"Is li not possible, doctor, that all the
evidences of hanging may be absent and
yet that death may have been caused by
hanging?"
"Tea, that is possible," was the reply.
'â¢Then, all the evidences being absent in
this case does not necessarily prove that
death was not caused by hanging?"
"That might be."
"Then that fact destroys your reason
for Baying that death was not caused by
hanging'"'
"It does in a measure."
Prosecuting Attorney Allen tried to
have the witness justify this statement,
which was in direct conflict with other
medical testimony given in the case, and
was partially HuocessfuL
Dr Eastman, who was the next wit
ness gave very damaging testimony. He
stated positively that Lillian died of
meningitis induced by blows on the head.
and h< ; the idea of death being
caused by hanging. .
Brandea passes his time during the long
scientific examination reading the news
papers He reads every line about the
case that he can procure, and frequently
requests newspaper men to bring him a
paper. Although the proceedings were
Somewhat dull to the lobby throughout
the day, there is always something crop
ping up to connect the leather club rest
a.L on the Judge's desk with the little
mound in the graveyard where lies the
13-year-old victim of the tragedy. It is
brought up when the prosecuting attor
ney will in the middle of a series of ques
tions calmly ask, "Would these condi
tions apply, doctor, to a girl 13 years old?"
The Leather club which Brandea carried
to use on burglars or highwaymen that
he might meet In the Berkeley wilds flg
ured very prominently several times to
day it was handed to the doctor, with
the question, "Would an instrument like
this have caused the wound?" and the
answer would invariably be that just such
an instrument would most certainly
cause wounds similar to those found on
tbe head of poor Lillian.
The examination will probably end to
morrow. Prosecuting Attorney Alien said
to-day that the State had nearly linished
its case, ami that it will conclude to-mor
row. Attorney Sawyer, who is associated
with the defense, said to-night that they
will not waste any time making a de
fense in the Justice's Court. "We are
confident that Brandea will be held to
answer," said the attorney "and we see
no use in covering the ground twice. We
have a good defense, but we do not think
it advisable to mako it at this time. In
the Superior Court we shall be prepared
to show the innocence of the accused."
Mrs. Brandes is still as uncommunica
tive as ever in the County Jail. She per
sistently declines to discuss her affairs or
those of her husband with newspaper
men, and gives to all the same answer,
"What is the use of paying an attorney
and not following his advice? He has or
dered me to say nothing."
Mrs. Brandes. however, has shown at
times an Inclination to defend her hus
band. She admits that she chastised
Lillian and has made the remark, "Al is
innocent," to Jailer White. It is not yet
certain what use will be made of the
woman as a witness, or whether she will
be called by the prosecution or the de
fense. The proof of the legality of her
marriage is still kept in the background
by both the prisoners, who decline to dis
cuss the matter. Should she preserve her
present frame of mind there is no doubt
that she will not turn State's evidence.
Her imprisonment tells heavily upon her,
while Brandes appears fresher and fatter
every time he is brought into court.
ANOTHER UNKNOWN DEAD.
A Woman's Body Found Near a Box
of Rough on Rats.
OAKLAND, Dec. 14.â An unknown wo
man was found dead in a room at the
Avenue House, corner of Sixteenth street
I and San Pablo avenue, to-night. She is
: a stranger and was last seen by the land
lady on Monday last, when she asked
whether transient guests were taken. She
! secured a room, and when the landlady
! to-night went to her quarters to learn
whether s-he wished to keep the room
longer she found her lying on the bed,
] partly dressed and dead. On a small
I table near the head of the bed stood a
! box of "rough on rats, from which
I a good portion had been taken by the de
â  ceased. Nothing was found by which |
she might be identified.
The deceased was apparently about 3j
years of age. She is of medium build,
had a plain dark coat and dark skirt and j
black felt sailor hat. Her dark brown
):;iir is short and curly, and the left eye
, tooth is missing. Thu remains were taken
. to the Morgue.
There May Be a Widow.
OAKLAND, Dec. 14.â The remains of
O. A. Donohue. a veteran of the civil war,
I who died at the home in Yountville last
Monday, will be buried from this city
1 probably under the auspices of the G. A.
|K. The deceased lived here for many I
1 years and was widely known among the
oldi r residents. He was a native of
Massachusetts, aged 61 years, and in IS6I
and 1564 served under General Shafter.
Of late years he had been an intense suf
ferer from sickness, and on this account
w. Nt to the Soldiers' Home at Yount
ville. Had not his friends here heard of
his death in time the remains would have
been buried there. Some of these friends
: are interested in ascertaining: as to what ;
has become of Donohue's pension money,
! which amounted to $13 per month and
which, it Is claimed, has been collected
for a long time past by some woman in
San Francisco, who might claim now that
she is Donohue's widow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1898.
BABY SELLING
INDULGED IN
BY SOCIETIES
Sharp Says Daniels
Asks for Coin.
HENDERSON IS DEFENDED
IS A MINISTER IN GOOD STAND
ING.
Home-Finding for Children in Cali
fornia Seems to Be a Fit
Subject for Investi
gation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, .uec. 14.
The complaint made by the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children re
garding Rev. J. E. Henderson of the
American Home Finding Association of
W.A.BRANDES
the Pacific Coast, with its headquarters
in this city, has brought to light some of
the methods by which children are traf
ficked in throughout California.
The complaint made against 'JLc. Hen
i derson was published in this morning's
; Call and attracted wide attention in this
! city on account of the prominent people
i interested in and associated with the Oa^
! land society.
Jion. Cralgie Sharp, presfdent of the Oak
! land society, says that the charges maue
I in to-day's Call by Rev. F. Daniels of Sac
i ramento are largely unfounded, and he
j replies to them by making just as seri
; ous charges against Mr. Daniels.
There are several societies in Callfor
' nia. It apears, which make it a business
of findiiig children and finding homes for
them. They have solicitors going all over
the State collecting large sums of money
which are mostly spent for the salaries
of those running the society.
The Oakland society has for its board
of directors many of the leading minis
ters and merchants in this city, and, ac
cording to Its president, is doing work
that saves the State thousands of dollars
per month. It is managed by Rev. J. j E.
Henderson, who is assisted by three ladies
who solicit subscriptions all over the
State for the society and are allowed 50
per cent commission for their salary and
expenses.
"I have perfect confidence in Mr. Hen
derson." said President Sharp, "but I
know that Rev. Mr. Daniels has frequent
ly made a demand for money on people
with whom he has placed children. It is
this system that has led to the report that
home-finding societies sell children com
ing into their possession. I have here
proof from Petal uma that Mr. Daniels
placed a child with a familyldemanded $50.
and when it was not forthcoming the child
was turned over to us and we found it a
home. There are several such instances
which we can prove. Our society does
not do this, and I believe Mr. Henderson
is acting honestly and usefully. He is ndt
a disgraced minister, but is a member in
good standing of the Methodist Confer
ence. Regarding anything he may have
done at Angels Camp I know nothing.
"The two children which it is said we
took from Sacramento I know nothing
about, but I have no doubt that Rev. J. E.
Henderson has placed them in a tempo
rary home, and if they are wanted at Sac
ramento they can be sent there at once.
We have no home in which to place chil
dren, and the expense consists in taking
the children from one city to another. It
is true Mr. Henderson travels free and
can take his wards with him, but he has
to meet his hotel expenses, and although
his salary is supposed to be $7o a month
I know that he has not yet been able to
get that much from the society. This
matter in the paper is the result of jeal-
ousy.
"Orlgrlnally we were a portion of an
; other society, but they wanted too gTeat
! a percentage of the collections made in
1 this city, and we decided to organize inde
i pendently. We are now about to incorpo
1 rate, and our board of directors includes
â  many of the best men in Alameda.
County." . ..
Rev. J. E. Henderson is now in the north
ern part of the State, and Is expected back
to-morrow. President Sharp says he will
no doubt lay the statements of Rev. Mr.
Daniels before the attorney of the society
and will probably demand satisfaction.
M J. Keller, who is the treasurer of
the society, says he does not know any
thing about Mr. Henderson,- but he has
absolute confidence in President Sharp,
and knows that he would not be a party
to anything that was not perfectly
straightforward and worthy of support.
ALAMEDA DEMURS TO
A BIG DAMAGE SUIT
LITIGATION OVER THE DEATH
OF MRS. DAVOUST.
Question as to Who Was Responsible
for the Wire That Burned
Her to Death.
OAKLAND, Dec. 14.â The city of Ala
meda, through its attorney, Senator B.
K. Taylor, filed a demurrer this after
noon to the complaint of Martial Davoust
in his suit against the city, the Sunset
Telephone and Telegraph Company and
Pacific Postal Telegraph Company,
brought recently for the recovery of $50,
000 damages on account of the death of
his young wife, which was caused by a
live wire.
The demurrer is very elaborate. Its
iirst ground is the insufficiency of facts
to constitute a cause. Another point is
that the complaint is uncertain in that it
cannot be ascertained therefrom which
of the defendants Btretched or maintained
the "certain wire," or whether said wire
was a telegraph, telephone or electric
light wire; also that it does not specify
which, if any, of the defendants â¢'negli
gently and carelessly allowed" the wire to
remain upon the ground, or who devel
oped or conducted the electricity that
heavily charged said wire.
The fact that the complaint does not
specify what purtion of the alleged dam
ages was the result of the loss of ser
vices and society of plaintiff's wife, and
what portion is claimed for the bodily and
mental Injuries sustained by plaintiff is
another point urged in the demurrer. Also
that two causes of action have been im
properly joined. And finally that there Is
a misjoinder of parties defendant, in that
it appears from the complaint that each
defendant was operating a separate sys
tem of wiring, supported by the same
poles, that "a certain wire" caused the
injury, and It is apparent that as any one
wire was maintained by one defendant
only there is no cause for the joinder of
the other two defendants.
The city asks to be dismissed as a de
fendant.
ONLY THIRTY DAYS.
Short Sentence of F. B. Willey, a Con-
victed Burglar.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 14.
F. B. "Willey, a burglar of Kings county,
was brought to the county jail to-night to
be kept until he shall be taken to San
Quentln. Willey considers himself one of
the luckiest men in California. He has
to serve a sentence of thirty days, the
smallest sentence ever passed In Cali
fornia upon a conviction of burglary.
Willey and a companion named Jose
Estuardo were caught while engaged in
a burglary. When arraigned Estuardo
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to San
Quentin for five years. Willey pleaded
not guilty and put the State to the ex
pense of a trial, after which he was con
victed and, to the surprise of everybody,
he was sentenced to thirty days in San
Quentin.
The deputy sheriff who is bringing Wil
ley to San Quentin says that the whole of
Kings county is Incensed at the action of
Judge Dixon Phillips, who sentenced Wil
ley. He says it was confidently expected
that Estuardo's sentence would be mitt
gated In view of the fact that he pleaded
guilty, instead of which he received the
maximum penalty for burglary in the
second degree. The prosecution was con
fident that with the conviction of Willey
he would receive the same sentence as
his pal, but to the surprise of the Dis
trict Attorney and the whole of the coun
ty, he was let off with thirty days.
"It is not worth the expense of bring
ing him to the State's prison," said the
deputy, and Willey Jocularly says that
the trip is an agreeable excursion for
him.
Halpin's Death.
OAKLAND. Dec. 14.â The jury at the
inquest of Dennis Halpln, the aged gar
dener who was run down by reckless driv
ers last Sunday night on Moss avenue,
brought in a verdict to-night that "death
was caused by the fracture of several
ribs and vertebrae, the result of being
thrown from his wagon through some un
known cause."
Officer Kamp's Trial.
' ALAMEDA. Dec. 14.â The charges pre
ferred by Jacob Hoeck against Officer
Albert Kamp will be investigated Friday
night by the police committee of the
Board of City Trustees. Hoeck charges

fidence In giving information to a Call re
porter when the former had his little
sons incarcerated in the City Prison.

TRY TO SHOW
EVIDENCE OF
AN ASSAULT
Mrs. Mentel's Defense
Is Outlined.
BRUISES ON HER LEFT ARM
CASE AGAINST HER IS LACK
ING IN STRENGTH.
Prosecution Fails to Develop Any
Convincing Proof of Premedi
tated Murderâ Will Close
Friday.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Anna Mentel was continued before Jus
tiro of the Peace Morris in Alameda yes
terday morning, and the last but one of
the v. â  â  t the prosecution heard.
The remaining witness, John M. Dickson
of 1% Powell Btreet, Kan Francisco, tailed
to put In an appearance, and when court
adjourn. d at 3:40 p. m. the Jud
an order for him to appear at 10 o'clock
Friday morning. So far the prosecution
has not developed the strength it was
credited with, and th< District Attorney
apparently did not try to draw out his
witnesses, which, of course, was very
ng to the defense.
OnÂ« â  nse was on the
Dr. W. fc>. Porter, the
physician at the R> reiving Hospital in
nd, testified that he examined Mrs.
Mentel the morning after the shooting
and found black and blue marks on her
left arm and an abrasion of the left
â -. The latter injury may have been
caused by a blow or a fall, and was ex
nsitive to the touch. He did
: any marks on her body.
ant John Conrad of the Alamede.
Police Department testified that when be
arrived on the scene of the murder a few
minutes afu-r the shooting Mentel lay
Stretched upon the sidewalk, with his
riKht hand partly in his trousers pookt-t,
tl.e larger knuckles being in plain view.
Other witnesses had testified that the
hand was buried out of sight in the
pocket, and this has been reg-arded as
proof that Mentel had been stricken down
before he had time to defend hims.li",
and that therefore he could not have been
in the act of assaulting his wife when he
was killed. Hut the feature of Conrad's
testimony was the ivport of the conversa
tion he bad with Mrs. Mentel as she was
being conveyed to Oakland after her ar
r. .-t.
"I asked her," he said, "why she shot
her husband, and she answered:
'if you were a woman and a man
Btruck and knocked you down and threat
to choke you, wouldn't you shoot
him." "
The defense claims that this reply
given before the woman had an opportu
nity to concoct a story and while she was
Btill laboring under the nervous strain
caused by the tragic event Immediately
preceding, goes far to prove that she
had i ilted. Conrad also testi
fied that, in response to further questions
as to what her husband said or did to
cause the shooting, she said -t was "too
horrible to mention."
Detective Herbert of Oakland also tes
tified that he asked about the cause of
th.- shooting. Sne said her husband could
tell him all about it. She thought at the
time Mantel was alive.
Drs. Lubeck and Keyes of Alameda,
â who attended the woman and performed
the autopsy on the body of the deceased,
â¢â I similar answers from her. The
physicians also d< scribed Mantel's
wounds. The fatal bullet entered near the
left temple and came out about two inches
above the ear on the right Bide of the
head. The other bullet entered the left
breast near the breastbone and ranging
Upward passed out near the point of the
left shoulder, causing merely a flesh
wound. The skull was fractured in four
or five places, evidently caused l>y a fall
after the man was shot. The physicians
elso said there were powder marks on me
head and body, indicating that the shots
had been tired at close range.
Defendant's attorney endeavored to show
in the course of his cn.ss-examina
tlon of witnesses who handled the corpse
that th^ body had been dropped while De
ing put into the Morgue wagon, but Dep
uty coroner Fowler and those -who
; ted him were positive that nothing
Of the kind occurred.
Among other witnesses examined were
F. M. Looney, William Helmken, W. L.
Smith and J. N. AnsÂ« 1. the latter a
brother-in-law of the deceased, but their
testimony was unimportant, except as
corroborating that of witnesses who had
]'!â¢ c< ded them in regard to seeing the dy
ing man lying on the sidewalk. The case
â¢will be continued Friday at 10 a. m.
It is the intention of the attorneys for
the defense to ask to have the prisoner
admitted to bail when the court convenes
Friday. If this is refused a writ of ha
1 â¢ corpus will be applied for and tho
question argued in the Superior Court.

AND
FALLING HAIR
The purest, sweetest, and most effectird
treatment is warm shampoos with
(uiicuia
followed by light dressi ugs with Cuttcura,
purest of eniolli ent skin cures. This treat-
ment will clear the scalp and hair of
crusts, Bf ales, and dandruff, allay itching,
Boothe irritation, heal eruptions, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on thÂ»
hair, stimulate the hair follicles and sup-
ply the roots with nourishment and en-
ergy, thus producing a clean, wholesome
scalp, with luxuriant, lustrous hair.
Bad Scalp Humor Cured
I had a bad scalp humor, and thought 1
would go frantic with itching I lost consid-
erable of my hair (of which I had an abun
dance, and was very proud;. I tried several
remedies but they all proved a failure I tried
CtrncDÃA Soap, found relief immediately,
and that itchiug ia completely gone.

Falling Hair Restored
I was troubled with dandruff so that it made
my hair fall out so bad I got discouraged I
purchased a box of Ccticira and
a cake of Ccticcba Soap The former I
rubbed well Into the scalp twice a week, and
then shampooed with warm water and a good
lather of Cdtichra Soap once a week. I
am pleased to say that my hair is growing
out thick once more, and free from dandruff.

WALTER ROSSER'S TRIAL.
The Slayer of Henry Hildebrand Does
Not Remember the Tragedy.
The trial of Walter Rosser, the youth
ful soldier who killed Henry Hildebrand
on September 13, will probably conclude
to-day. When the case was again taken
up yesterday morning Rosser was called
to the witness chair. He told in substance
the same story as upon the former trial.
He said that after he left the Pine street
dive he remembered nothing of his actions
and of the tragedy he had not the slight
est recollection. He did not recover from
the effects (if some poison he believed was
administered to him until the next day.
After the prisoner left the stand sewrai
witnesses corroborated his story, and then
witnesses were called by the prosecution
in rebuttal.

THE RAIN CAME
JUST IN TIME
The Hearts of the Farmer, the Stock
man and the Storekeeper Are
Made Glad.
WEATHER FORECASTER HAMMON when seen yesterday said
that the rain which began to fall on Tuesday night has been
doing its duly. It has covered the entire State of California,
from Point Conception and north of Tehachapi, where upward
of half an inch has fallen.
"I am afraid," said Mr. Hammon, "that it will soon stop, al
though the storm may return to us with redoubled vigor. It has
rained nicely and evenly over the largest portion of the State. The
Sacramento Valley has had a little less than an inch, about three
quarters fell at the lower end of the San Joaquin and Stockton and
half an inch at San Luis Obispo. There has been a trace of rain at
Los Angeles, and the storm, which had Its source in the west of Ore
gon, is slowly moving to the southward.
"The rain has been of considerable benefit, especially to
stock. The shower has averaged about half an inch. It will start
the grass growing and this will come at what I might call a critical
point. When the last frost made its appearance it is a fact that the
stock all over the State did not have the strength to withstand it, and
at least 10 per cent perished. A stock raiser in Monterey County,
whose cattle were suffering, contracted for twenty cars to ship
them to Nevada, but the present rain may have the effect of keeping
his stock here.
"The wheat growers are also jubilant, but before good crops can
be insured there must be considerably more rain. I consider the
present visitation only as a 'good sample.' There is no conclusive
indexations that we will have more rain in the next twenty-four hours,
but if the storm off Oregon is strong enough it will probably send us an
other secondary storm like the first and we may expect rain again
on Friday morning. The only bad feature that I can see now is that
the wind is northeast, but if it veers around to the south, and there
Is no reason why it should not, we will have abundant rains. It is
clear at Red Bluff and Eureka to-night and the storm is drawing off
the coast to the west. Thursday night or Friday morning will most
probably see a return of the welcome visitation."
From all parts of the State come jubilant reports and the farm
ers, orchardists and vineyardists are happy and hopeful, while the
stockmen are open in expressing iheir intense satisfaction. San
Jose, San Diego, Sacramento, Fresno and Los Angeles have been
cheered by the downpour. The fall in Los Angeles has been com
paratively light, but .10 of an inch, although it was still raining
there last night. The local health authorities are also delighted,
for the rain has flushed many blocked sewers and has cleared the
atmosphere of the irritating particles which are held responsible for
the throat, nasal and pulmonary troubles with which Callfornians, as
a rule, are afflicted. Even the merchants are glad, for the prospect
for a dry winter made the outlook for holiday sales very black.
Purse strings will now be loosened and the interior merchants espe
cially will reap the benefits of the welcome rains. This means good
business all around and California's prosperity for the coming year is
assured.

of the prosecution, so both forces were

DEDICATION NEXT MONTH
IT IS A SMALL BEGINNING,
BUT IT WILL GROW.
Hopes and Plans of the Order
Explained by One of
the Prominent
Officers.
For many months a number of the
members of the order of Native Daugh
ters of the Golden West have worked on
the lines of establishing a home for the
members of the organization in which
such as desire may. when away from
their own homes, have a place to go
where thoy will find "all the comforts of
home" in the fullest sense of the phrase.
In the carrying out of this Idea the
Board of Relief of the Grand Parlor ap
pointed a committee of five, said com
mittee to have full power to plan for the
project in the manner they deemed best, of
which the following named ladies are the
officers and directors: Mrs. Tiny O'Kane,
the senior past grand president, who by
reason of the fact that she was the first
president of the Grand Parlor was given
the post of honor, that of president; Miss
Mac B. "Wilkins, past grand president,
vice president; Miss Clara K. Witten
nieyer, past grand president, secretary;
and Mrs. Carrie R. Durham, past grand
president, treasurer. Mrs. W. S. Leake
of Califa Parlor, Mrs. 11. M. Green of
Buena Vista Parlor, Mrs. J. A. Stein^ach
of Alta Parlor, Miss Minnie Coulter of
Santa Rosa Parlor and Miss Mollie B.
Johnson of Califa Panor, directors.
That step having been taken, the
ladles named occupied themselves In the
matter of Interesting the parlors, not
dnly of this city but of the entire State,
and by personal visits to such parlors as
they could reach, and by correspondence,
they laid their proposition before the
membership. Their labors were rewarded
by assurance of assistance. Buena Vista
Parlor voted $50 from its treasury to aid
the cause along, and a day or \wo after
Alta Parlor contributed $100, the Oro Fino
Parlor gave $50, the parlor at Buena \ en
tura gave $15 and Marguerite Parlor do
nated $10 and Forrest $20. Subsequently
Buena Vista added to its donation in the
shape of an offer to Tit up one room in a
building to be selected as a hospita .
Then there came offers of assistance
from a great number of the parlors, con
ditional to this extent: "If you have your
home in operation by the Ist of January,
lsy.t and there is a prospect that it will be
a success, then we will assist you in your
project " This was so encouraging that
the energetic officers held a meeting on
the 10th of September and appointed Mes
dames Leake, Green and Steinbach and
Misses Wittenmeyer and Wilkins a com
mittee to secure suitable quarters in
which to establish the home. After a
protracted search, house hunting on a
grand scale, the committee decided to take
a ten-room house at 925 O'Farrell street,
between Polk street and Van Ness avenue,
a pleasant, quiet neighborhood. This was
not however, until the latter part of Oc
tober. Then came a difficult task, the
renovation of the premises. The landlord
kindly offered to put It in good order, and
now the house is a very neat and comfort
able one, and while it is not very large,
it is sufficient for the time being.
After the painters, the kalsominers and
other artisans had vacated, Mrs. D. T.
Wilkins the mother of the vice president,
was appointed matron with instruction to
take charge of the place and see that it
was put in proper condition for the re
ception of guests. There came in the
first place, in the nature of a most pleas
ant surprise, a donation by Mrs. Leake of
carpets and furnitureâ almost enough to
furnish five rooms. This lady has taken
an unusual interest in this matter and
has done and is still doing much to makes
the home the grand success that it is, iv
time, bound to be. Buena Vista Parlor
also gave furnishing for a hall bedroom
on the upper floor, with the understand
ing that Jn case of need it shall be used
for hospital purposes. The other room
which is to be the hospital proper will
be furnished by that parlor in a few days.
Mrs. Wilkins added to the contribution of
furniture and at this time the ten rooms
are very neatly and comfortably fur
nished. There is on the half basement
floor a dining room, kitchen, pantry and
servants' room. On the first floor there
is a pretty, well-lighted double parlor and
matron's "room, while on the upper floor
are four bedrooms, one of which will be
the hospital, and a bathroom. There are,
of course, a number of things necessary
to adnrn the walls, in the line of pictures
and fancy articles that go to make up the
furnishing of a house complete, but there
is hope within the breasts of the directors
and officers that a number of liberally dis
posed Native Daughters and Native Sons
will in the fullness of their hearts send
a number of such articles as Christmas
gifts to the home. The mother of the sec
retary contributed 100 glasses of jelly for
the dining room pantry.
"What we propose to do," said Miss
Wilkins, the vice president, "is to give
notice to all members of the order that
any member of a parlor in good stand
ing who desires may come to the home
and there find such accommodations as
they can find in their own home and that
at a small cost. Such will be able to ar
range with the matron, if so desired, to
take meals at the home or take them ;
wherever desired. Take, for instance, i
members of the order who come to this !
city alone and do not wish to be a bur
then on friends or acquaintainces or do
not desire to go to a hotel or lodging
house; such can come to the home and .
there will have all the privileges they i
would enjoy in their own home, i
The parlors will be at their dis
posal, and occasionally there will
be home gatherings for social entertain
ment. We feel much gratified at the en
couragement we have received and we
hope that the time is not far distant
when we shall have to seek larger quar
ters and we look forward to the time
when we can own our own home and \
have the pleasure of seeing the Native
Daughters' Home one of the most promi
nent institutions of the State. We expect
that we will receive contributions of ;
books in order to establish a library for
the use of those who shall stop with us,
be it for a short or a long period."
It is hoped that some of the wealthy
people of the city and State who are na
tives thereof but not members of the or
der will, when they understand the new
institution, contribute to its support.
The home will be dedicated on the 2d
of next January.
TO WALK SIX DAYS
FOR CHARITY'S SAKE
BIG CONTEST TO START IN THE
PAVILION TO-DAY.
The attendance at the charity bazaar
has been gradually but steadily increas
ing, and hast night, in spite of the threat
ening weather, the attendance was as
laige as any night since the opening.
The great six-day walking contest in
the gallery of the Pavilion will start at
1:30 o'clock this afternoon. There were
fifty entries, but C. W. Doyle, who is
booking special attractions, cut them
down to twenty, selecting only the best
men. A five-foot tan bark track has been
laid around the gallery, and refreshment
booths will be put at each end for the
benefit of the contestants. The track is
seven laps to the mile, and each contest
ant will be given the privilege of an
hour's rest any time he sees fit to drop
out. The race opens at 1:30 o'clock each
day and continues until 11:30, a total of
ten hours in twenty-four.
Music is now being furnished by bands
from the various Native Sons' parlors,
which have entered into the musical con
test.
RATES APPROVED.
Railroad commissioners Accept the
Valley Road's Vegetable Tariff.
The Railroad Commissioners held their
monthly meeting yesterday. The most
important thing done by the board was to
adopt the special fresh fruit and fresh
vegetables tariff No. 1 of the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad,
which was submitted by that road. This
new schedule of rates Is lower than that
for grain given by the Southern Pacific.
It is for all points between Bakersfleld
and San Francisco, and gives a rate of
20 cents on the hundred. Similar rates are
also given between Bakersfield and
Stockton.
The consideration of the right of the
board to investigate the affairs of the
Pullman Palace Car Company went over
until the next meeting, the board deeming
it best to await the advice of the Attor
ney General, who has the matter under
consideration.
The report of I. H. Polk, expert to the
board, who, pursuant to a resolution
passed by the board on April 22, has been
investigating the subject of the regulation
of the rates of charges for transportation
of freight and passengers on lines in its
â¢jurisdiction, was read and filed. The
Southern, Central and South Pacific Rail
way companies were the ones dealt with
in the report by Mr. Polk. After review
ing the case, which hns been pendlnp for
a long time before the board, Mr. Polk
says in conclusion:
â¢'I wish to say that in this railroad case
we have gradually accumulated and are
accumulating a mass of facts and figures
which, when properly analyzed and tabu
lated, will, in my opinion, prove of Incal
culable value not only to your honorable
board in the pending and future inquiries
into the methods of this great labyrinth
of corporations but also to all other
boards and officers of this State whose
duties bring them into contact with rail
road companies."
CAPTAIN DE LA MAR IS HERE.
Made Famous by the Divorce Granted
Him From His Wife.
Captain J. R. de La Mar and T. M.
Clement are registered at the Palace. The
former is tho owner of many profitable
mines and is well known here, while his
companion is also a man of mining fame.
They are en route to Mexico to look after
some of their mining interests, and are
accompanied by Guy Anderson, an assay
er of Salt Lake.
Captain de La Mar is prominent the
world over not only on account of his
wealth but because, of the recent divorce
proceedings that he instituted in Paris
against his wife. She was a poor girl of
Parkersburg, W. Va., when he married
her and was said to have been, in the
language of the Parisian critics, a god
dess of divine beauty and grace. He took
her to Europe, where her beauty and
form attracted much attention. They vis
ited Egypt, and it is said that Mrs. de
La Mar was the recipient of marked at
tention from the Khedive.
This was the beginning of the end, and
Captain de La Mar instituted divorce pro
ceedings. It is said that he found in his
wife's possession letters from the Khe
dive of a compromising nature. He was
granted a divorce. This was five years
ago, and those who know the captain say
that he will never again take unto him
self a wife.
Mr. Clement, who is the general man
ager of Captain de La Mar's mines, be
came famous throuph his connection with
John Hays Hammond, with whom he
was associated in the Jamison raid in
South Africa. He was captured by the
forces of Oom Paul and only escaped
with his life through the interference of
the British Government.
