"BVT THE GREATEST OF THE IS CHARITY".
HE will of God Is
ace ompllshed. So
mote it be."
Charity â Masonic
charity â was exem
plified yesterday in
the ceremonies at
Decoto when the
words quoted above
were spoken In unison by the multitude
which had assembled to witness the
dedication of the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans' Home. Not charity extended
to those who are to occupy the home,
but that charity which was given by
those who have gone beyond and which
Is now returning â the bread cast upon
the waters;.
The BOlemn, Impressive and beauti
ful ceremo] lefl attendant upon this ded
lcation were emblematic of the good
of Masonrj -that unostentatious, ever
vatchlul charity of thought, word and
deed which upholds the weary brother
and stands between the widows and or
phans of the departed brother and the
rude buffets of a cruel world.
In the dedication of the home is seen
the F*aith fulfilled, the fruition of Hope
and the Charity which extends beyond
tiie grave to rhe boundless realms of
eternity â the sublime materialization of
the three supreme tenets of anctent
and accepted Masonry. Yet it was not
with vainglory and boasting pride that
the ceremonies were conducted. Hu
y of heart and thanksgiving to the
Supreme Being were the undertones
that dominated the entire assemblage
as it listened to the words which gave
the magnificent building as a sacrifice
on the aitars of the order. AVhen the
. in his nonage, the widow in her
weakness and distress and the ailing
brother in his dotage turn their steps
tals of the home situated on
the heights overlooking the broad bay
and beautiful valley there will come no
: : ancy, no heartburnings
: feeling of being the recipient
of charity, no abasement of spirit be
cause of the blighting touch of pov
erty â they will walk proudly into the
house furnished for th-inseJves by
themselves and with the consciousness
that the mystic mantle which covers
their ov. n
hands.
This was the spirit which animated
the m Ititude yesterday and which
gave a charm to the proceedings fai
: touching than the words of the
beautiful ritual which deeded the home
to its noble ends. It was not in the
variegated plumes and clanking swords
â n<>t in the ornate regalia and modest
apronâ not in the pomp and ceremony
that t â  >ness of the occasion
â was m I, but rather in that all
ling of brotherhood and
unity of purpose which marked the
day.
It was an imposing sight to witness
the hundreds of men as they marched
h the streets of the city yester
day morning preparatory to their tx
cursion across the bay and down the
valley. It was the symbol of strength
of the order and It left an Impression on
tlie crowds that thronged the pave far
:â¢ than the passing of armed bodies
of troops, for these men were marching
to the peaceful victory that m<
to the world than all the battles ever
fought aver religious creed or political
faith. As trainload after trainload of
people were unloaded at the little way
station until full 3000 people were con
gregated it was seen that there was
something more thanj pomp and show
Which stirred the hearts of those bound
by the mystic, tie. What matters the
details of the'processicn or ceremony?
What matters the how when thetwhy
predominated over all? The blai- of
band and sensate worda of the orator I
sank to nothing before the great, om- j
sent fact that God's noblest work
was being done. It was the communion
of humanityâ the outpouring of the
corn of nourishment, the wine of vir
tue and the oil of universal benevo
lence.
It was a splendid pageant which
marched across the fruitful valley from
the trains to the home on the hill. Led
by the grand marshal, Colonel William
Edwards, and his aids and pioneered by
a squad of police the two divisions
wound along the broad road made espe
cialfy for the occasion and up the ter
raced hill to the front of the building,
where the Tempters and the Scot
tish Rite bodies In their gorgeous
uniforms enfiladed to the right and laft
on the steps, permitting the main body
of the procession to pass through be

The stirring strains of the bands had j
scarcely died away when the grand â

of the portico and opened the ceremo- j

occasion. A new ritual was formed,
and It was with swelling hearts that
the lodge sang:

has the United States by the throat and
is determined to squeeze everything
possible out of her."
There Is no longer any doubt that ne
gotiations in Paris and Havana are not
proceeding with the smoothness which
the authorities desire. It is not meant
by this that there has been any serious
hitch, for such is not the case. But
Spain's persistency in making unrea
sonable demands and in sticking to
them is rather wearing, and when the
President returns there is likely to be
some sharp correspondence which will
bring the Spaniards to their senses.
So far as I have been able to learn
no instructions have been sent to Ma
jor General Wade, chairman of the
commission, regarding The refusal of j
the Spanish Government to discuss the !
points raised, but that officer will con- |
tinue to press Spain's commissioners to ,

such action Is clearly Impossible then
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1898.
Spirit of Truth and Love,
] descending from above,
Our hearts inflame,
Till Masonry's control
Shall build in one the wholeâ
A temple of the soul
To thy gnat name.
Grand Master Flint then briefly an
nounced the purpose of the gathering
and the general purpose of Masonic
dedication of halls and homes. Charles
L. Patton of San Francisco, chairman
of the board of trustees, then addressed
the grand master and presented the
edifice to the order. He said:
Most Worshipful Grand Master: The
brethren of this Jurisdiction, being ani
mated with a desire to promote the ln
terest of the craft, have erected this home
for the convenience and accommodation
ol" its widows and orphans. They are de
sirous that the same should be examined
by the M. \V. Grand Master, and, if it
should meet with his approbation that
it should be solemnly dedicated to Mason
lc purposes, agreeably to ancient form
and usage.
To this Grand Master Flint replied:
Worshipful Master and Brethren: I ac
cept with pleasure the important and in
teresting duty which you request of me.
In doing so, permit me to express to the
brethren of this jurisdiction my hearty
appreciation of the â¢nterprislng spirit
which has actuated them in the erection
of this structure, an "edifice which is a
credit to the fraternity as well as an or
nament to this State. In accordance with
â  the teachings of our institution, it is our
duty, before entering upon any undertak
ing, to invoke the blessing of God. We
will, therefore, unite with our Grand
Chaplain in address to the Throne of
Grace.
Grand Master Flint then called up
the brethren and the grand chaplain,
Edward Bentley Church of San Fran
cisco, offered the following prayer:
O Lord God! Source of light and love!
Supreme Grand Master, and Great Archl
| tect of the Universe! who from thy
i throne in the highest heaven, in mercy
I lookest down upon all the dwellers on
! earth, lend, we beseech thee, thine ears
I to the prayers and petitions of thy chil
! dren now assembled in thy presence; en
able us to properly comprehend and prac
tice the precepts of this sublime edifice
erected to thy holy and glorious name.
Pour upon us, and upon all the members
of thy mystic craft, whithersoever dis
persed throughout the world, the rich
blessings <>f thy providence. Give us
strength to overcome temptations, to sub
due our passions and to practice virtue.
Fill our hearts with reverence for thy
great and terrible name; with an affec
tion for thy divine goodness; with piety
toward thee; and with love for our fellow
man. Make us faithful to our friends,
and charitable to our enemies. Dispose
our hearts, O thou Great Jehovah, to re
ceive light and truth from the groat
source of light, that our steps may be di
rected In the paths of virtue. And whilst
we dedicate this building to thee, enable
it may be that the date fixed will be
a little later. Other matters will be
brought to the attention of the Presi
dent immediately upon his return and
instructions will be given which the
authorities with whom I talked say will
surely bring the Spaniards up with a
round turn.

CLEVER DIPLOMACY

Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA. Oct. 12.â General Parrado
has received from Madrid an answer
to the last note from the American
commission. The Spanish Government
again urges the impossibility of the
evacuation of Cuba by December 1, and
points out that such demand Is unrea
sonable. Madrid leaves to the Spanish
commission the final settlement of this
question. Regarding other points made
by the American commission the Span
ish Government makes a reply which
certainly does credit to its diplomacy.

that our lives are sincerely dedicated to
uur (Jod, and to the refief and well-being
of our fellow creatures. And. finally,
when our pilgrimage In life is ended, may
wo be admitted into that sublinv ana
eten al lodge where thou dost forever
preside. Amen.
The brethren rsponded, "So mote It
be?'
Chief Architect R. G. Hurlburt of
Kan Francisco, who superintended the
erection of the building, addressed the
grand master as follows:
Most Worshipful Grand Master: Having
been Intrusted with the duty of supervis
ing and directing the workmen employed
in the construction of this edifice, and
having to the best of my ability accom
plished the task assigned me, I now return
to you the implements committed to my
care when the corner-stone of this struc
ture was laid (presenting the square, level
and plumb), humbly hoping that the re
pult of our labors will be crowned with
your approbation, and that of the Most
Worshipful Grand Lodge.
To this the grand master replied as
follows:
Brother Chief Architect: The skill and
ability displayed in the execution of the
trust reposed in you at the commence
ment of this undertaking have received
the entire approbation of the Grand
Lodge, and they sincerely pray that this
edifice may continue a lasting monument
of the taste, spirit and liberality of its
founders.
Deputy Grand Master Frank Marion
Angellottl of Ran Rafael then said:
Most Worshipful Grand Master: 'ihls
edifice in which we are now assembled
and the plan upon which it is constructed
having met with your approval, it Is the
desire of the brethren that it should now
be dedicated according to the ancient
form and usage.
The choir, under the leadership of
Samuel David Mayer, grand organist,
sang the dedication hymn, as follows:
To this building, where we call thee,
Come, O Lord of Hosts, to-day,
And thy fullest benediction
Shed within its walls alway.
Here vouchsafe to all thy servants
That they ask of thee to gain;
What they gain from thee forever
With the blessed to retain.
Grand Chaplain Church then offered
the following consecration prayer:
Great Architect of the Universe, Maker
and Ruler of all the World: Deign from
thy celestial temple, from realms of light
and fflory, to bless us in all purposes of
our present ass.mbly. We humbly im
plore thee to give us at this and at all
times wisdom in all our doings, strength
of mind In all our difficulties* and tho
beauty of harmony In all our undertak
ings. Permit us, O Thou Author of Light
and Life, Great Source of Love and Hap
piness, to consecrate this edifice and dedi
cate it to thy honor and thy glory. Amen.
"Glory to God on high; on earth
The Americans set forth the military
evacuations meant relinquishment of
Spanish sovereignty in Cuba without
reference to the proceedings of the
commission in Paris or to the final date
set by the peace commission, and made
a second point that property described
as immovable should not be withdrawn
from the Island. In reply Sagasta says
he cannot discuss these mutters with
the Spanish commission in Havana.
They are only for the consideration of
the Paris commission. It can easily be
understood that this is a pcrlite way of
refusing to recognize the jurisdiction of
the American commission and really
places Wade, Sampson and Butler at
a distinct disadvantage. It is now for
them to formulate their policy, which,
according to all precedents, must be
answered in writing to Parrado and his
associates.
There will be more correspondence
with Madrid and further loss of time.
In the meantime this note from Madrid
gives practically to Blanco and Parrado
authority to proceed with disembarka
tion without reference to American pro
testa. Regarding the sanitary condi
tion of the city and the possibility of
an outbreak of yellow fever upon the
appearance of many Americans the re
peace, good will to men," was the re
sponse of the brethren.
The choir then sang the stanza:
Bring with thee virtue, brightest maid:
Bring love, bring truth, bring friendship
here,
While social mirth shall lend her aid
To smooth the wrinkled brow of care.
The grand junior warden, James
Foshay of Los Angeles, then advanced
and presented the vessel of corn, say
ing:
Most Vv r orshipful Grand Master: In the
dedication of Masonic buildings it has
been the immemorial custom to pour
forth corn as an emblem of nourish
ment. I therefore present to you this
vessel of corn, to be employed by you
according to ancient usage.
The grand marshal slowly uncovered
the emblem, and the grand master then
called up the brethren by striking the
emblem thrice with his gavel, and
poured the corn upon the emblem, say
ing:
In the name of the Great Jehovah, to
whom be all honor and glory, I do sol
emnly dedicate this home to Freemasonry.
The public grand honors were then
given once. The grand master then
seated the brethren, after which the
choir sang:
Bring charity with goodness crowned,
Encircled In thy heavenly robe.
Diffuse thy blessings all around.
To every corner of the globe.
The senior grand warden, Charles
Lewis Patton of San Francisco, then
advanced and presented the vessel of
wine, saying:
Most Worshipful Grand Master: Wine,
the emblem of refreshment, having been
used by our ancient brethren In the cere
monies of dedication and consecration, I
present to you this vessel of wine, to be
used by you on the present occasion ac
cording to ancient Masonic form.
The grand master then struck the
emblem three times, and sprinkled the
wine upon the emblem, saying:
In the name of the Holy St. John, I do
solemnly dedicate this home to virtue.
The public grand honors were then
given twice. The brethren were seated
and the choir sang:
To heaven's High Architect all praise.
All praise, all gratitude be given,
Who deigned the human soul to raise,
By mystic secrets sprung from heaven.
Deputy Grand Master Angellotti then
advanced and presented the vessel of
oil, saying:
Most Worshipful Grand Master: I pre
sent to you, to be used according to
ancient custom, the vessel of oil, an em
blem of that joy which should animate
every bosom on the confpletion of any
important undertaking.
The grand master struck the emblem

MANILA, Oct. 12.â Late reports from Hollo are to the effect that
the rebels have surrounded the city and are holding the Spaniards
strictly within their defenses.
The natives about Manila show no disposition to commit any
overt act against the Americans, although rumors of a Spanish cleri

three times and sprinkled the oil upon
the emblem, saying:
In the name of the whole fraternity, I
do solemnly dedicate this home to uni
versal benevolence.
Public grand honors were then given
three times.
The grand chaplain then advanced
and made the following invocation:
And may the Lord, the giver of every
good and perfect gift, bless the brethren
here assembled In all their lawful under
takings, and grant to every one of th^m
in needful supply the corn of nourishment,
the wine of refreshment and the oil of joy.
Amen.
"So mote it be!" came the response.
The grand marshal then made the
following proclamation:
By order of the most worshipful grand
master, I do hereby proclaim that the
home In which we are now assembled has
been dedicated to the purposes of Free
masonry in due and ancient form. Ali
persons interested will take notice and
govern themselves accordingly.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger, orator of the
day, was then introduced and pave a
resume of the work attached to and
the history of the erection of the home.
In the course of his address he said:
All great results have been a struggle,
at most times against the consent 01 the
majority, for the world, usually indis
posed to listen to progressive ideas, will
turn its face to the suggestion that, as
time goes on, the condition of man might
improve. And our noble structure, which
we consecrate to-day amid the benisons
of 20,000 Masons, is an exception to the
rule, but in this that we may well marvel
that its erection was but the result of six
years of labor. That was owing, most
worshipful grand master, to the splendid
disposition of the craft, to the magnifi
cent ability of that noble host of women
who share their husbands' and fathers'
sentiments regarding the noble purpose
of our order. Th.it was owing to the high
motives which every Mason places before
himself and permits him to execute the
mandates of his craft not only in obedi
ence to those who command him but with
willing sacrifice, because the constitution
which he obeys teaches him naught but
good. It is a testimony to Masonic char
ity that stands here for all time. It is an
eloquent expression that the tents of the
freat fraternity which we delight to
onor are deeply rooted In this far West
ern soil, and, as it stands, it is even a
promise that, while time shall abide, Ma
sonry in California shall ever strive up
ward and forward in order that it may
testify unto the world that the highest
mission Intrusted it by the Grand Master
above is a mission of love, a mission of
peace, a mission of humanity, a mission
to extend the hand of fraternity unto all
of God's children, unto all who
confess themselves by his name, unto
all who are weary and heavy laden, unto
all who themselves are imbued with the
love of God which shines in the heart of
man.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger next told of the
struggles made to establish the home in
the pastâ 'efforts which were, after
many periods of doubt and depression,
crowned with glorious success. He paid
a glowing tribute to Mrs. Frank Pifrof
and Mrs. Dr. Edna Field as the organ
izers of "the womanhood of Masonry
in its great work at the Masonic Fair."
In the course of his remarks Rev. Mr.
A"<Â»>rsanger paid this tribute to Charles
L. Patton:
Two years ago this vory day we laid
the cornerstone of this noble structure
amid the magnificent ceremonies
â¢which you doubtless still remember.
But for an entire twelve nmnths noth
ing could be done beyond laying the. foun
dation, there being no funds to prosecute*
the work to conclusion. The able and in
itiative Brother Patton at last year's ses
sion, in asking the Grand I>odp;e for a
gift of $20,000 to be paid over when thÂ«>
building waa completed was in reality the
beginning of the end. I desire to state
here that Brother Charles L. Patton's
stubborn perseverance, his able raanage
mant of difficult questions, his very re
markable courage In facing difficulties,
have, to my mind, been the main source
of the splendid activity of the past twelve
months, and it is to him in the first place
that the Grand Lodpe owes thanks for
the successful completion of the work we
consecrate to-day, as wel 1 as for the fu
ture possibilities with which this home is
endowed. This grant of $20,000 enabled the
board to make the necessary contracts
for the erection of the administration or
main building.
The speaker closed his address in the
following language:
And so we stand here to-day, most
worshipful grand master and breth
ren, with the work of organization
practically completed, the home finished,
its doors open and awaiting the call of
those who will need its protecting care.
It is meet indeed that before entering
upon the second stage of the work, that
is the practical care and maintenance of
our wards, being a great and important
undertaking, we should first Invoke the
blessing of him without whose aid no
work can prosper, for be it understood
and let there be no doubt about it, we are
but at the beginning of the second chap
ter We have written up- a glorious in
dlcatlon of a more glorious work, and its
success or failure will depend entirely
upon us. Shall we build upon these noble
foundations? Shall we emulate the elo
quent traditions here established from the
noble precedent here witnessed, or shall
we fall back upon laurels easily won
and contemplate the Joy of success that
was won by the workers who were en
eaeed in it? Brethren, the board of
trustees is still ready to go on with the
work but it finally commits the enter
prise'to your loving care. May you so
deal with it as you will be dealt with,
and may the finest sentiments of Ma
sonry obtain full swins within these
halls consecrated to Faith and Hope and
Charity. t , it
As Dr. Voorsanger stepped back the
applause which had punctuated his re
marks was redoubled and the grand
chaplain closed the ceremonies with the
benediction. The crowds spread
through the building and over the
grounds, and after inspecting the place
to their satisfaction wended their way
back to the waiting trains, and in each
heart throbbed the benison, "The will
of God is accomplished. So mote it be. *

BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Sept. â The story of the
taking of Manila is a tale that is still
being told in various ways. It is being
told, for one thin- in the rewards
dealt out at Washington to the soldiers
who are supposed to be deserving of
all honor â and dealt out, so far as our
meager information goes, as rewards
are always dealt out at Washington.
Dealt out, in effect, not to the men who
are most deserving. It is a long pull
that reaches from Manila to the dome
of the Capitol. To be effective, as it
seems to have been, it must of neces
sity be strong. We have been told out
here that Anderson, Greene and Mac-
Arthur have been made major generals
for the part they took in the battle of
August 13. We do not in the least ob
ject to that. Anderson was in command
on that day, and success, however won,
goes to the commander. Also, Ander
son is a good soldier and a good fellow.
He gave the command for California to
go ahead â and California went ahead.
She always doesâ save, perhaps, when
it comes to getting the reward of merit,
the throne.
Mac Arthur is likewise a good soldier
and a good fellow, and the fight he
made on the extreme right deserved
the honor he has won.
Again, nobody will object to
Greene's advancement. Greene built
the trenches before Malate, and
the boys in the ranks will remem
ber him kindly for that. He made
the approach on the strongest front of
I the enemy's works, in the traditional
\ way, approved by engineer . officers,
! since t>;e brutal pastime of war be
came a. science. 'i he lads who tolled
at those trenches under the burning
sun or through the torrential rains of
the tropics, the brave boys who kept
long ward behind the works through
the night hours while the searchlights
from the ships swtept up and down
over them, while Spanish sharpshooters
snapped at them from clumps of bam
boo, the widows and loved ones of
those men killed in keeping the trenches
where there was need for neither the
trenches nor the keeping, the dead
asleep by the lonely Paranaque, where
no American dead had need to lie, with
the voices of the living and the voice
less eloquence of the lead, will acclaim
Major General Greene. Let us get
down, for once, to facts. There was
no more need for trenches before Ma-
late, no more need for the loss of one
American life in the operations prelim
j mary to the taking of Manila, than for
! the whole blundering series of opera
tions out here since Dewey's great vic
tory to set free a people whose sole
notion of freedom lies in license to cut
the throat of a 'captured foeman. Dewey
knew this. He knew the city was at
his mercy at any moment he wished to
take it, and he knew, also, that the
rebels, so-called, a rabble handful of
half-clad natives, held the Spaniards at
bay waiting the good pleasure of the
great Admiral. I believe, moreover,
that General Merritt knew the lives of
brave men lost before the city fell were
needlessly lost â only, Merritt and the
Admiral are too well drilled to admit
too much.
Let us return to the rewards of merit
for victory. Colonel Van Volzer of the
Eighteenth Infantry, we are informed,
has been made a brigadier general.
Colonel Van Volzer is the senior colonel
of General Greene's brigade, and was
in the trenches with his men, on the
firing line, when the assault began. He
did not stay In front, but that was not
altogether his fault. Let us go back a
little to the land operations attending
the fall of Manila. The case of General
Mac Arthur, in command of the right
wing, we will consider disposed of by
his promotion. On the left wing, Greene
in command, the First Colorado and the
Eighteenth Infantry were assigned to
the task of holding those trenches be
loved of the general. The Utah Bat
tery had its guns in place then, and
the men fought them like demons. The
First California led the reserve, with
the Nebraska Regiment and the Penn
sylvanians, who had kept the trenches
the night before, thrown back in the
order named. The Colorado Regiment
had its band out with full equipment,
with the purpose of making a theatrical
entrance into Manila. I speak of the
things I saw. When the ships ceased
firing and the order to advance was
given, the Colorado men, under Col
onel Hale, and the Eighteenth, under
Colonel Van Volzer, leaped over the
trenches and made a break across the
poddy fields and bamboo thickets for
the Malate fortress of San Antonio
Abad. This spoiled the band effect
somewhat, a rush through difficult
country not being calculated to in
spire the average army musician with
enthusiasm, but General Anderson had
ordered the Californians forward in the
meantime and Colonel Smith, whose
band had been utilized to carry mus
kets, swept down into the trenches with
his regiment, turned sharply to the
right, marched out to the beach on the
double, rounded the old iron barge
which formed the extreme right of the
American works, and carried his men
along the beach into Malate, headed
by the Colorado band, playing "Hot
Time in the Old Town To-night. 1
Colonel Hale's Colorado troops
reached Fort San Antonio Abad first
and put up the American flag in Ma
late. That, after the Californians had
brought up their band in good order,
seemed to be glory enough for Colo
rado. What had become of Colonel
Van Volzer and the Eighteenth in the
meantime, I did not have time to find
out Colonel Smith had orders to go
ahead with the First California, and
he went ahead. I went with him. The
Second Battalion of the First Califor
nia, Colonel Smith and Major Slma
leading, passed the Colorado troops at
Fort San Antonio. They fought their2
way down the Calle Real to the walls
of Manila, they saw the white flag fly
5 ing over the old town as they crossed
the Luneta, they were drawn up in
front of the northern gate of the walled
city, were fired upon and lost two men
through a stupid rebel blunder, had
passed through and left behind them
2500 Spanish soldiers in arms, before
General Greene himself caught them,
and before the Eighteenth regulars or
any other American troops were any
where in sight. The Colorado troops,
so far as anybody at the front knows,
stayed at Fort San Antonio all the bal
ance of that day. Certainly they never
got within hailing distance of the
troops actually in Manila.
General Greene himself was surprised
to find the Californians so far ahead.
"How did you get here, Colonel?"- he
asked, as he overtook the victorious
Californians before, the walled city.
"I had orders to come ahead, Gen
eral," was the answer. "I came ahead."
And Colonel Smith kept going. He
advanced along the wide drive that
sweeps around the walled city, sta
tioned his troops upon the Puente Es
pana, cutting off the business part of
the city from the citadel, and upon the
t â Â°uente Colsante, or suspension bridge,
tT:us virtually securing command of the
Pasig, and made his way thence into
the fine residence district of Mala
kanan, virtually holding Manila at his
mercy. I rode across the Puente Es
pana and down upon the Escolta when
the Californians on the bridge were in
peril, because the citizens themselves
did not then know the city had sur
rendered.
And for all this glorious achieve
ment Colonel Hale of the First
Colorado- not Colonel Smith of the
First California, mark youâ is made a
brigadier general. Colonel Hale is the
same man. it will be remembered, who
alarmed the camp on the first night of
his arrival at Camp Dewey, causing
the California boys to turn out in the
rain because he had heard the insur
gents fire a few shots at Malateâ
Colorado man not being accustomed to
shootingâ and also caused General
Greene to leave his comfortable quar
ters on shipboard and pull for the
shore. Colonel Hale said, after he had j
thought the matter over for a few days, ;
that he had been giving his men prac
tice drill. The sentry who came pant- j
ins: into the California camp to give
the alarm was about the most badly
scared man I ever saw at practice
drill. If he was acting a part, he j
missed his vocation when he became a
soldier. So did Colonel Hale, when he
sent to the California Regiment for
help because the Spaniards were "driv- j
ing in his pickets." It happened that a ;
reliable officer of my acquaintance was
at the front that night, in the Insurgent
trenchesâ for this was In the days be
fore General Greene had pushed Aguin
aldo's men aside to make room for his ;
own pet earthworksâ this officer I
told me nothing whatever had hap
pened between the Colorado outpostsâ
and those outposts were back of the
rebel trenchesâ and the place where
Aguinaldo had possibly half a hundred i
men stationed to guard his smooth
bore guns. The Spaniards were more
than usually quiet, not relishing the
notion of a fight in the rain, and the
rebels were also saving their powder.
The Colorado sentry who opened the
rehearsal, so far as anybody could see. j
had shot at his own shadow and ran \
away as fast as his legs could carry
him." It was masterly practiceâ for Col
onel Hale's men. Still, it was not kind
to keep the CalMornians in the dark j
concerning what was about to happen:
and certainly it was most unkind to
cause the boys to lose their sleep in
that way on the very first night Col< -
rado landed, and after the generous
Californians had even shared their to
bacco with thÂ«i newcomers.
Mind I have no criticism to make j
upon this kind of practice. It is mas
terly, in its way, but it is not war.
Still", if it could be carried through with
out a disturbance of the peace of one's j
neighbors in camp, I do not know of a
better way to break men in to the rude |
"alarms necessarily incident to the ex-!
istence of a condition of active hositli
ties I knew when Colonel Hale sent
over to Colonel Smith for help that
night on the plea that the Spaniard.-? .
, had driven in his pickets, there were
some persons rude enough to assert
that the Colorado man had cold feet
and was panicky, but those were sim
. ply the malicious, always to be four d
Joining in the detraction of a man
wholly and entirely great. Also, Col
onel Hale made a full and complete ex
planation of the whole episode, after
be had time to think about it, by the
practice drill story, and about head- j
' quarters they were content to let it j
go at that. Possibly it was the gener
alship shown in achieving any kind of .
acceptable explanation at that lime
which won Hale his stars, and not the
part he did not take in the real advance
on Manila.
â  Or it may be that the tardy turning :
out of the First Colorado Regiment I
on the night of the real alarm, that
awful 31st of July, when the First Cali
: fornia went down into the trenches
i through a hell of flying bullets and
bursting shells, marking its path by its
dead, to the relief of the hard pressed
Tenth Pennsylvania, won the brigade
for the Rocky Mountain colonel. It Is
: sometimes better generalship to save '
than to sacrifice men. Colonel Hale
kept his in reserve, well out of the line j
of fire that night.
Whatever it was, it was not being I
the first to enter Manila that gave
Colonel Hale his honor. History will
record that Colonel Smith of the First
California led his men, fighting every
step of the way. to the walls of the
old town. That is a fact even the "pull" ,
is not strong enough to overcome.
Whether Colonel Smith is to be a vic
tim of the ingratitude of our own be
loved republic is a matter for the fu
ture to determine. Californians, at all
events, should unite to see that justice
is done. The fact remains the fact,
and the witnesses are living. Every
man of Companies B, D, H and I of
the Second Battalion of the First Cali
fornia Regiment, General Greene him
self, the correspondent of the London
Times, Mr. F. D. Miilett, knows that
the facts of the advance upon Manila j
are as here set down. Colonel Smith
of the First California had the city
at his mercy before the formal capitu
lation, and before even General Mer
rltt's representative, Colonel Whittier,
also made brigadier, and the represen
tative of Admiral Dewey had landed
from the fleet to receive the surrender.
If there is one man in all the American
army who Reserves recogn.tion for dis
tinguished gallantry at the taking of
2Â£?nlla that .man is Colonel James F
tomith of the First California Volun
teers. â  .

I.OS ANGELES, Oct. 12.â The match
race at the park this afternoon between
Toggles and Monterey was one of the
prettiest pieces of harness horse bric-a

the majority of speculators thought
Toggles might scratch in in the first heat,

arrived early 'and the latter horse was a
l-to-2 chance when the horses scored.
Even money and 6 to 5 for a little was ob
tainable about the Fresno horse and
Driver Clarke told his friends he didn't
think there was that much difference be
tween the horses.
Toggles drew the pole and started on In
his usual resolute way. The chestnut
horse came fast, very fast the last Quar

The Monterey coin was now thicker
than flics in a bakery and the bookies felt
shy about handling it. The result devel
oped the fact that good things sometimes
fail in the trotting business. Just as the
pair were given the word In the second
heat Monterey left his feet and before
Williams could get him down Toggles had
obtained a lead of a dozen lengths. He
went to the half in l; 03% and stepped to
the village in 2:09%. leading the red horse
past the judges over two lengths, amid
great excitement among the occupants of
the stand. Reinsman Clarke was the re
cipient of an ovation.
Aside from this little calamity the bet
ting fraternity fared extremely well.

straight heats and Elsie Smith, Celoso,

in the ring, escaped with the running

a prominent young reinsman, handled her
and his work could scarcely be improved
upon. In the second heat the drivers had
a little fun with the ring by playing Bas
tina off the boards for the place, but the
layers of prices took their medicine
gamely. Charley Bunch then changed
his gloves, and Don finished second in the
following two heats.
A ragged bunch of horseflesh started in
the first running dash, a live and a half

twenty pounds above the scale. Smyle

he gained at such a. great rate that he was
third when they had gone less than Fix fur

BROWN'S SLAYER CONFESSES.
Augustine Burtenier Admits the
Killing of the Bancher.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 12.â Augustine Burten
ipr has confessed that he killed Frank
Brown. In an Interview at the County
Jail, this morning, he said:
'â¢I killed that man. He tried to catch
me."
This is the first time the man has con
sented to talk of the crime. He would
say no more and refused to make any ex
planation, dropping into the sullen, silent
mood which he continually maintains
From the evidence before the Coroner's
jury it would appear that the man was
out for a hunt when he crossed Brown's
field, at which time the killing occurred.
NO CHANCE FOR
THE PENNANT
FOR BALTIMORE
Did Not Come Up to
Expectations.
PITCHERS PROBABLY TIRED
SOMETHING MORE THAN LUCK
FOR BOSTON.
The San Franciscos Cannot Win
League Honors, but They
May Play Good
Ball.
By Joe Corbett.
The Baltimore^ did not make the cham
pionship finish which I predicted some
few days ago.
The pennant is now lost to them, yet it
cannot be said that they did not make a
remarkable run for it.
With their present pitching: staff, which
I consider the greatest in the country,
much was expected of them. That they
failed to beat Boston during the last
series, I make no doubt, was no direct
fault of theirs.
Their fight for the pennant this year in
a great many respects resembled that of
last season. Many ups and downs were
experienced at unexpected places, and
pitchers, to keep in the race, had to work
unreasonably hard, and in consequence,
I fear, were not strong when the leaders
came along.
It happened so last season, and while I
cannot say that the pitchers this year
gave out as they did last, still they were
worked hard, and very reKu.arly, which
fact in itself is sufficient cause for me to
conceive them tired and anxious for
that day to come which will bring a
much-needed rest.
The Bostons, after their superb work
this year, â¢will be looked upon as a great
team. They won so many games tho pre
vious season that peopleâ and I arrons
themâ attributed their victories to luck
and not superior playing, for the reason
tnat contest after contest was won in the
? . v V lnln&> after they appeared irre
trievably lost.
As an illustration take one of the Bal
timore s games played at Boston. For
eight innings the above mentioned collec
tion held a winning lead, and after their
| half of the ninth inning they were four
i runs ahead. The Bostons took their last
! licks, and, with tv.o men out and two
i strikes on the butter, six bases on balls
and a single followed. Enough runs were
gathered to win the game, and after it
waÃ Â°,yer "11 I could hear and say was
1 U CX a
This is but one instance of the many
games won by the Boston club last sea
son in a peculiar manner, but now that
they have again demonstrated that their
championship aspirations are genuine, It
is to be hoped that the "luck" story will
pass into oblivion.
I for one have arrived at the conclusion
and without much deliberation that the
Boston club is indeed great, and I sin
cerely trust that the Eastern supporters
will do likewise. Surely when a team
wins the national pennant twice in suc
cession there must be some other ele
ment besides luck prevailing, nnd this
element is "good baseball." True, they
have had a fair smile from the fates, but
all teams are acquainted, to no little ex
tent, with the unforeseen, and, to be
frank, what would a team do if the smil
ing fates did not occur occasionally
Without any doubt the San' Francisco
team, as it lined up on Sunday last is
very good.
Iberg, as everybody knows, is one of the
very best pitchers in the league, an i
*''i h , a R ? llly on second to strengthen the
infield I feel at intervals that they are
invlncibles.
Of course, I do not always labor under
such unique delusions, but there are mo
ments, such as the present one, in which
I permit myself to think kindly of this
famous icecream collection.
The one complaint, however, lies In the
fact that when you call the Friscos a
clever aggregation they turn right around
on their next outing and put up a foolish
exhibition. I must, however, state, de
spite the fact that I am apprehensive as
regards the next exhibition the Friscos
put up, they are at present. If appear
ances go for anything, a great team.
The team, of course, has no chance for
the pennant; but this really makes no
difference, for the "rooters" would dearly
love to see them, as their representative
club, play just a few good games before
tho season closes. That they will I am
Inclined to believe, but I will not say so,
for an old adage ha 3it that "there is
many a slip iwixt the cup and the lip."
The Friscos, as I previously mentiom-d,
play In accordance with the above say
ing, and, being cognizant of the fact, I
cannot state anything regarding them as
being positive.
If they can just cling together, now tnat
they have a presentable organization, long
enough to prove that they are real, live
players, their faults of the past will be
forgiven, and the finale, providing it be
up to expectation, applauded.
The Oaklands are making a glorious
record for themselves this season, for
sure. Not content with being among the i
lesser lights as a ball team, they sought j
to win laurels by cheating a restaurant- j
keeper In Sacramento very recently-, and j
came out of the melee with the same ,
percentage as they now hold in the league
race.
It is strange what some players will do
to exalt the game.

DECLARES MINE OWNERS
ARE GUILTY OF MURDER
Governor Tanner of Illinois Scores the
Men Who Are Importing Negroes
to Replace Strikers.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.. Oct. 12.â 1n an Interview with Governor Tan
ner this: evening regarding the Virden riot he said:
"T. C. Louck, president, and Mr. Lukens, superintendent, of the
Virden Coal Company, at 12:30 to-day, made good their threats to land
a trainload of Imported laborers from the South and attempted to put
them to work in their mines at the point of the bayonet and the
muzzle of the Winchester, such laborers being drawn largely, if not
entii the criminal '-laps, ex-convicts who learned their trade
while doing time ) n the penitentiaries of Alabama, after having been
fully advised and having full knowledge that the landing of such im
port" Tfl would precipitate a riot. I had wired them that if
they brought thes< 1 laborers they did so at their own peril,
and, under the circumstances, would be morally responsible and
criminally liable for anything that might happen. From the informa
tion I can gather at this time the very minute the train stopped in
front of the coal shaft, where the doors of the stockade were thrown
n for the imports, i laborers to enter, the firing began. The killed
and wounded are largely idle miners who were on the outside. The
ers were the hired guards who were brought along by the coal
pany. Most, if not all, of them, were non-residents of Illinois.
There Is no means of learning their names or whereabouts, for the
reason thai they d them out, knowing, perhaps, that
ihey are criminally liable for mur . r. as they had no permission from
any oflicial In limioia ......; . ./.. putizing them to act as deputy
marshals or deputy sheriffs. Instantly on learning of the trouble I
dire* te<! Adjutant General Recce to order Captain Craig of the Gales
burg Battery and one company of the Sons of Veterans Regiment,
now stationed at I'ana, to proceed at once by the quickest routes to
the scene of the trouble. General Recce accompanied Captain Craig,
and I have instructed General Recce to quell the riot and maintain
order, protect life and property, to disarm all persons bearing arms
and to not allow imported laborers to unload from any train within
the limits of the city, nor to march in a body.
"These avaricious mine owners, who have so forgotten their duty
to society as to bring about thlÃ blot upon the fair name of our State,
have gone far enough; yes, too far, as they had fair warning from
me, by wire and telephone, that importation of labor which brings to
our Slate an undesirable class of citizens had to stop. And I say
now to such and all others that this is a thing of the past; that it
. shall not be tolerated in Illinois while I am Governor. These men,
the president and officers of thlp company, who participated in this
riot n >' the bringing of imported labor, are guilty at murder,
and should, and, I believe, will be, Indicted by the Grand Jury o f
Macoupin County and tried and convicted for this heinous offense."
REPLY OF THE MINE OWNERS.
CHICAGO, Oct. 12.â President T. C. Louck of the Chicago-Vlrden
: Company, who arrived at 9:."0 o'clock to-night from the vicinity
of the trouble, made the folh wing statement to the Associated Press:
"our position has been defined right along by the press, as the
public can ascertain, and we simply desire to state that our employes
arrived ai Virden at about 12:30 to-day. We stopped the train oppo
bo that the men could go from the train Into our works,
when Immediately the mob llred from all directions, and, very natur
ally, our men defended themselves. The consequences in full we do
not know positively as yet. As to our future ac|ion, we pro-pose to
follow in the future, as we have in the past, legal procedure in the
tainlng of our legal rights, and shall take proper steps to secure
redress against all who prompted, aided, abetted or participated in
the riot of to-day, whether they are miners, miners' officials. State offi
cials or others. We shall determine before we are through whether
the government of this State can clfifs our colored population as ex
convicts, scalawags, etc., with impunity, and whether the colored citi
zens of this country can have their rights under the constitution set
HPide at the whim and pleasure of the government of Illinois. We
shall determine for ourselves and others In this State Just how far a
Governor can annul and evade the duties placed upon him by the con
stitution and statutes of this State."
and night by vigilant miners deter
minedly awaiting their arrival.
To-day the Chicago and Alton lim
ited, due to pass here at 10 o'clock, shot
through en route to Chicago an hour
late, displaying flags on the rear Indi
cating that a special was following.
Immediately the word was spread and
a dense crowd of miners lined the sta
tion platform, while another collected
at the entrance of the stockade, half a
mil â  north of the station. D. B. Kiley,
a Chicago and Alton detective, stood
guard at the switch at the south end
of the station platform to see that it
was not tampered with.
At 12:40 the special train passed the
Station and signal shots were fired from
the south end of the train, announc
ing the spt-eiaJ's arrival. Immediately
shots were tired from the moving train
and outside and the battle was on. A
few moments after the train had passed
the switch where Kiley was stationed,
ami while he was talking with two citi
zens he threw up his arms and dropped
dead with a bullet through his brain.
He was the first man killed.
The train continued to the stockade.
the miners firing into it all along the
route, and the negro passengers re
turning the fire. The moment the train
reached the stockade th>- miners opened
a desperate fire with Winchesters, re
volvers and firearms <<f all descriptions.
The negroes on the train answered with
a steady fire. The miners and the train
were enveloped in a cloud of smoke
and the shooting sounded like a con
tinuous volley. Engineer Burt Tigar
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1898.
received a bullet in the arm and
dropped from his seat. His fireman
seized the throttle, pulled it open with
a jerk, and the train was under sueed
carrying a load of wounded negro pas
sengers to Springfield.
How many were wounded is not
known. The train stopped at the stock
ade but two minutes. Its departure did
not cause the firing to cease. The tower
df the stockade was filled with sharp
shooters, armed with Winchesters, and
they kept up a steady fire into the
crowd of union miners. Eye-witnesses
say that miners were killed after the
train had departed. It is not known
how many men are stationed behind
the walls of the stockade, but an es
timate is placed at between twenty-five
and forty. It is claimed that six within
the stockade were wounded, but those
Inside refuse to hold any communica
tion with the outside and nothing au
thentic can be learned. Word was,
however, sent from the stockade to the
physicians In town that their services 1
werÂ» needed.
The supply and provision store of the
Chicago-Virden Coal Company is
known as the Climax Trading Com
pany, with Superintendent J. F. Eyster
in charge. At 2 o'clock, after the firing
at the stockade had subsided, an at
tack without a parallel in the history
of the trouble, was made on TCyster in
this store on Main street, one block
from the depot, which will probably
cost him his life. He was sitting in his
store when his telephone rang and he
whs instructed from the stockade to
secure physicians and hurry them to
the place. Eyster jumped into his de
livery wagon and, securing two doctors,
rfkshed them to the mines.
He returned to his store, climbed out
of his wagon and was just entering the
door, when the cry was raise,! that
Manager Fred Lukens of the miners
was with him. With a rush a throng
of infuriated miners pressed toward
the store. Eyster ran behind a coun
ter with a revolver In each hand. The
miners pressed hard after him and as
Eyster sprang upstairs he and the min
ers began shooting simultaneously. He
ran to the top of his building and
Jumped behind a chimney, while the
miners ran into the street and opened
tire on him again. Chips flew from the
brick chimney and Eyster ran from
cover across the roof of another Ptor?.,
tiring into the street below as he ran.
From there he crossed to the roof of
the Rank of Virden, where he reloaded
Ills revolvers. Blood whs flowing from
a wound in his side, but with dogged
d< t< rmination, against terrible odds, he

continued his flight. Jumping to the ]
roof of the Rae & Glsh drug store, he j
halted behind a projection from the ;
roof of the building he had Just left
and emptied the twelve chambers of'
his two revolvers.
Then, springing from the cover, Ey- j
ster dashed ahead amid a rain of bul
lets to the roof of the Steed building,
the upper story of which is known as
Miners' Hall. He either fell or Jumped
through the skylight and landed in the
arms of a crowd of miners, who seized
him and carried him downstairs to the
street. Other hands seized the almost
unconscious man and dragged him into
the middle of the street. Local police
men drove back the crowd and carried
Eyster to the city square across the
street and laid him on the grass. Oy
ster was motionless and supposedly
dead. In a few minutes he was seen
to raise his hand and wipe the blood
from his face. Two men sprang at
him, and, with the ferocity of tigers,
began jumping on his body and strik
ing him on the head with stones. With
a yell the angry crowd charged into
the square to kill Eyster. The police
charged In a body and fought their
way to the center of the mob. where
they took a stand over the prostrate,
battered, bleeding man. A carrier was
procured and Eyster was taken to the
Buckless Hotel. He had been shot
through the groin and is terribly bat
tered up about the head. The physi
cians say that he has barely a chance
for recovery.
The dead miners were removed from
the vicinity of the stockade to hotels
and livery stables, and the wounded
miners were taken on litters to the sta
tion and taken to Springfield to-night
on the 8 o'clock train.
An Associated Press reporter secured
admittance to the stockade late to
night. The list of dead and wounded
inside the stocknde follows:
DEAD.
A. W. MOROAN, Chicago.
WOUNDED.
EL Gritgesell, shot In shoulder.
O. J. Snyder, shot in face and legs.
James Sickles, Chicago, shot In leg.
Frank Wilder, Chicago, shot In arm.
Thomas Mclntee, Chicago, shot in leg.
Two doctors were at work with the
wounded and communication with them
w;is prohibited.
The stockade surrounds about twenty
acres of ground in a square and is
made of pine boards a.n inch thick, pet
edge to edge about twelve feet high. On
each of the four sides, about midway,
is a small watch tower containing a
guard armed with a Winchester.
There are three entrances, which are
closely guarded by half a dozen armed
sentries day and night. The fight to
, day occurred at the east entrance.
There are about thirty-five big. strong
men stationed Inside the stockade to
night, each keeping watch through a
loophole. The four towers have been
deserted.
Manager Lukens remained at his
desk in the office all night issuing or
ders to his men.
Manager Lukens said to-night: "The
blood of every man shed here is on the
Governor's head. He is absolutely out
side of the law and has no justification
Whatever In refusing to Bend troops.
Ills public statement that the miner
had the same right to fight for his
property, which was his labor, as the
mine owner did to protect his property,
inspired the men to the action which
they took to-day in firing upon the
train as soon as it came into our town."
To-night Ed Oreen of Mount Olive, a
union miner, died of injuries received In
to-day's shooting. This makes a total
of eight dead.
WOUNDED MEN ARE
TAKEN TO SPRINGFIELD
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Oct. 12.â The
special train on the Chicago and Alton
which brought the Alabama negroes
from Virden had eight wounded nifn,
all deputies except one, who was a col
ored miner, who were taken to the
Springfield City Hospital. Of these one
man died to-night, William W. Carroll,
a deputy sheriff. He was shot three
times, c-ne bullet passing through his
neck from the right side, another pass
ing into the temple in the right side
and the third entering the brain over
the eye, crushing the skull. Another
train, which arrived at 9 o'clock to
night, brought up six wounded men,
vyho are at St. John's Hospital. Those
at Springfield Hospital are:
William Clarkson, an inmate of the
Old So-ldiers' Hume at Leavenworth,
Kans., deputy; ;;kull crushed; will die.
H. A. Kyger of Kloomingion, engineer
on train; shot through arm.
William Masser of St. Lou's, deputy;
shot through head, shoulder and hands;
will probably recover.
James Palmer, deputy; shot in left
side of face, arm and side; will recover.
Palmer had just been mustered cnit of
the Third Nebraska Kegiment. He re
i fuses to give his home.
.Patrick Mack of Virden, employed by j
the operators of the Chicago- Virden
shafts; bullet went through his thigh;
will recover.
Ernest Ryan, a colored miner from
I Alabama; "bullet went through his
! head; will recover.
John M. Hunter o-f Pontiac, the presl- i
j dent of the Illinois District of the I
United Mine Workers of America, lies
j at the Collins House in a critical condi- j
I tion. Mr. Hunter got on the train whi'-h
bore the colored minors to this city j
this afternoon and engaged in conver-
s ation with two of the colored miners.
Some of the deputy Bhertffs saw Hun
ter, and when the train was between
\ North Grand avenue and the North
I shaft, and was going at the rate of
eighteen miles an hour, it Is estimated, !
the deputies attacked Hunter and
pushed him off the train. A man who
happened along later in a buggy saw
Hunter lying near the track in an un- j
conscious condition and placed him in
his buggy and took him to the Collins j
House. He is still unconscious.
Governor Tanner to-night wired the
War Department, asking if the Fifth
Illinois Infantry could not be placed at
his disposal for use at Virden. Colonel
Culver, the commander of the Fifth,
has tendered his services and those of
the regiment to the Governor.

SACRIFICES GOLD FOR LOVE
SIMPLE CEREMONY IN A NEW
YORK HOTEL.
By the Terms of His Father's Will
the Young Man Deprives
Himself of $5,000,000
by Marrying.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â Howard Gould,
by the terms of his father's will, lost
$5,000,000 to-night.
Gould and Viola Katherine Ciemmons
were married at 9 o'clock in her apart
ments at the Holland House. Rev. Dr.
Wilton Merle Smith, pastor of the
Central Presbyterian Church of West
Fifty-seventh street, performed the
ceremony.
The bridal parlors were simply but
beautifully decorated with the rarest
roses, orchids and other flowers sup
posed to exhale the sweet language of
love. The bride was exquisitely attired
in white satin, trimmed with old point
lace, the finest to be found in all Eu
rope. Otherwise there was no display.
All was simplicity and beauty. No
gems adorned the radiant woman ex
cept a small diamond pin at the throat.
She wore no flowers but a simple cor
sage bouquet. There were no brides
maids nor any one to give the bride
away.
Preparations for the wedding were
kept a profound secret. No one dreamed
that the event was to take place ex
cept the few suddenly invited guests.
They we 5 Mr. and Mrs. John Kimble,
Mr. and Mrs. G. U. Fitzpatrick, Leroy
W. Baldwin, Captain W. G. Shackford,
captain of the Yacht Niagara; W. Bo
gardus and Mr. and Mrs. Sells.
It was a notable scene, an event to
be remembered through a lifetime, be
cause it meant so much. The loss of
$5,000,000. the possibilities of litigation
and grievous heartrendlngs and cruel
family dissensions were all swallowed
up in the Joy of the occasion. Howard
d.iuld stood up like a man who was
sure he knew what he was doing, gave
his hand to his bride and the clergy
man tied the knot in the language of
the service of the Presbyterian church.
After the ceremony the newly wedded
couple sat down to a wedding supper
served with royal elegance and com
pleteness In the "gilt room." Immedi
ately after the supper Mr. Gould and
his happy bride entered their carriage
and drove to the yacht Niagara. The
yacht shot into the stream like an ar
row and headed down the coast, bound
for Washington, Old Point Comfort and
other interesting places for honey
moon and loitering.
Mr. Gould urged Miss Clemmons to
marry him more than a year ago. Im
mediately members of his family ex
pressed opposition and by innuendo and
newspaper publications Miss Clemmons
was made to feel how bitter this op
position was. In accordance with her
wishes and out of respect to her Judg
ment Mr. Gould consented to wait, but
with many protests. But at last his
importunities prevailed, the wedding
taking place to-night.
Miss Clemmons answered her perse
cutors when she began su jt against a
New York morning daily and denied
that Colonel W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill)
had given her her dramatic education
or had advanced her a fortune. She
said he was only her dramatic agent
and as such had advanced her no funds
that had not been repaid.
Howard Gould said to-night that he
expected to return from his wedding
cruise in about three weeks. By the
middle of November he will be at work
in the swirl and roar of New York
business. Though Mr. Gould has pre
pared himself to accept the loss of %;>,
000,000, the forfeiture under the codicil
of his father's bequest, he will still have
left a snug little nest egg of $5,000,000
in his own right.

to stop the practice of towinpr immense ;
rafts of logs on the Pacific. It is shown
that these rafts are frequently broken

' HANFORD, Oct. 12.â tour of
Henry T. Gage and Colonel E. F. Pres
ton brought the distinguished Republi
can campaigners to Hanford at 9
o'clock this morning.
The success of the great mass-meet
ing at Visalia last night was the topic
of comment among all classes to-day.
Never in the history of Tulare County
was a Republican meeting marked by
such a display of enthusiasm and con
fidence as that exhibited at the Visalia
demonstration. Every hour adds to
the strength of Henry T. Gage in this
productive region of California. To
day the people of Kings County are
cheering for the Republican standard
bearer.
At the Hanford depot this morning
Mr. Gage and Mr. Preston were met by
a large throng of Republicans and es
corted to the Aborn House. The ar
rival of the next Governor was made
Known by the blowing of steam whistles
and the firing of anvil salutes. At the
hotel Mr. Gage received the people,
while the band played inspiring music.
Voters came from the stores, shops,
vineyards and orchards of Kings Coun
ty i" clasp the honest hand of the peo
ple's champion. The citizens of Han
ford and the surrounding country con
tinued to come in until Mr. Gage's
-;th was taxed. The one hour's
rest which he had planned to obtain
i re starting on the sfde journ<
visit . and address the people
â  had to be deferred in order to

to see him.
Kepublican State Central Com

into account the full measure of the
burden which Messrs. Gage and Preston
are obliged to sustain. It is the
standard-bearer's pleasure to meet the
at these informal daylight re

arose in response to the Intro
ductory words.
The standard bearer deemed it pru
dent to reserve his strength for the
greater- Kings County mass meeting at
panford Opera House to-night, so he
did not discuss political issues at
length. The address was in the style
of a man-to-man talk, and all who
heard him were Impressed by his man
liness and sincerity. In closing he told
the people that if they elected him Gov
ernor no railroad or other corporation
should dominate him. and that he would
administer the affairs of the office hon
estly and efficiently, according to the
Jaest judgment that God had given him.
E. F. Preston, followed in a brief and
rousing speech. His denial of the in
sinuation that the Valley road was in
dring- r of passing Into tho possession of
the monopoly wa.s received with tre
mendous applause. He paid a tribute
to the public spirit of the nvn who
planned and constructed the competing
road to Bakersfielu. He scored the agi

in quick succession greeted the bril

County. He gained the respect of the
audience at once and held the earnest
attention of his hearers to the finish.

Returning from Lemoore Mr. Gage
Visited the extensive raisin-packing es
tablibhment at Armona.
Hanford, the capital of Kings Counts',
to-night was alive with enthusiasm for
Gage and Neff. Long before T he time
appointed for the meeting at the Han
fora upera-house delegations from the
| country adjacent began to arriva. Sud
i porters of the Kepublican cause came
from Lemoore, Armona, Grangeville,
Lucerne and the vineyards of this
famous region. The house was packed
from the wings of the Btage to the foy
er and out to the space on the sidewalk
in front of the building- In honor of
the occasion the interior was beauti
fully dei orated, the red, white and blue
dominating In the display of colors. On
the stage were members of the Repub
lican County Central Committee, can
didates on the county and legislative
tickets, veterans of the Grand Army of
the Republic and members of the
Young Men's Republican Club of Han
ford. .
The vast and enthusiastic assemblage
was called to order by J. O. Hickman.
chairman of the Republican County
Committee. He named as president of
the meeting George B. McCord. Repub
lican candidate for State Senator in the
Thirty-second District, who presided
with tact and ability. The exercises be
gan with a song by the noted glee club
Hanford.
Henry T. Gage was presented as the
next Governor of California. When he
stepped forward to speak the applaud
â  c acclamaiton of the multitude was
an inspiration to the Republicans. The.
rounds of applause were repeated sev- â 
eral times. Mr. Gage spoke with earn
est eloquence and at once gained the
confidence of his hearers. His tribute
to thf common schools of this land j
evoked the heartiest applause. In a
direct and convincing manner he re
â¢ d the single-tax dogmas of the
"Little Giant" and Maguire's un-Amer- i
ican and unpatriotic attitude with ref
erence to the war revenue measure in
Congress. The position of the oppos
ing "candidate on the railroad settle
ment question was fully and fairly dis
cussed aril the Congressional Records
produced to sustain the declaration
that Maguire could have defeated the
settlement by the simple utterance ot
an objection. ,
In a general sense Mr. Gage adhered
to the line of argument laid down, in
his great speeches at San Diego and
Bakersfleld. The practice as a plat
form speaker which he has gamed In |
this campaign has improved the Style
of his delivery and now he speaks with
ready fluency and force, evoking from
his audience frequent commendations
of applause. The expressed wishes ot
the people for an explanation or the
dangerous scheme of single tax caused
Mr Gage to dwell at length on tins sub
ject. New points are presented on vari
ous topics of Interest at

Colonel Preston was greeted With
hearty applause when President M< -
Cord presented him to the citizens of
3 County. The colonel's allusions
to the Valley Road excited the wildest
applause. When it was remarked that
the road had done more to bruit,' relief
to the people of the San Joaquin Valley
than all the anti-railroad speeches de
livered during the past twenty years by
the Clan Maguire the people yelled their
approval of the sentiment. Co
Preston suggested that gold coin was
required to build a railroad. The jaw
bone of an ass would not do it. The
absurd rumor that the road was in
3ing out of the hands of
the people was pointedly denied and
the denial was cheered mightily.
Colonel Preston's speech was aloncr
the line of his masterly address last
night at Visalia. Maguire's
holding, salary-drawing, Bingle-tak
pleading record was held up for the
benefit of the Intelligent audience. The
cry of the "Little
classes were oppressing the mass -a
pronounced demagogic rot. The
names of the men who sprung from
the common people were cited to prove
that no one in the American land was
oppressed. It was dangerous and un-
American for a man to stir up di
among the people. It was hinted that
if the Maguires did not like our Ameri
can institutions they should seek some
other country.
An eloquent tribute was paid to the
valor and achievements of the Ameri
can soldiers and sailors, and mention
was made of the glorious adjustment
of all differences between Bections of
the country. The orator's eulogy of
William McKlnley elicited from the in
terested audience great demonstrations
of enthusiapm.
J. C. Needham, the Republican nomi
nee for Congress in the Seventh Dis
trict, was the next speaker. He review
ed national questions, touching the
tariff, sound money and the railroad
question. His able Bpeech commanded
th.- attention of the vast concourse.
11.- defined his own position on th>- rail
road question, -declaring that he would
vote for foreclosure : ;.g to the
terms of the settlement if the railroads
failed to comply with the law.
The great meeting adjourned with
mi-hty cheers for the Republican
cause. To-night it is the talk in Han
ford that Kings County will give an
increased majority for the Republican
ticket To-morrow Gage and Preston
will journey on the Valley road to
Fresno.

Boss Phelan Names His Men to Di
rect the Battle for Office.
The campaign committee of Boss Phe
lan's mutual admiration society of one
hundred job-chasers met last night In
executive session. They spent three hours
In discussing plans for the campaign, but
transacted little business.
Boss Phelan experienced no email dif
ficulty in securing a campaign committee
that would "programme" on every prop
osition. Some of the job-chasers realize
thai they were used as figure heads at the
convention and in consequence they were
mad. In not a few of the districts there
were signs of open rebellion and great
tact and diplomacy had to be used in In
ducing the warriors to take off their war
paint and get back into camp. After the
pipe of peace had been smoked, the great
mogul, Phelan, through his trusted
sachem, P. H. McCarthy, announced to
the tribe that in the hands of the follow
ing braves had been intrusted the conduct
of the war for office and soft billets:
Twenty-eighth District. J. D. Maxwell;
Twenty-ninth, L. Brannan; Thirtieth, P.
J. Tomalty; Thirty-first, C. J. Gallagher
(not of the Clan Gallagher); Thirty-sec
ond J. E. Buckley (vouched for as not
being related to C. A. Buckley); Thirty
third, R. 8. Curtis; Thirty-fourth, J. H.
Hanson; Thirty-fifth, John Reedy; Thir
ty-sixth, Edward Reddy; Thirty-seventh,
W H. kead; Thirty-eighth, Charles W.
Fay (the living, moving telephone of the
boss); Thirty-ninth, J. J. Coffey; Fortieth,
6. M. Van Wyck Jr.; Forty-first, Howard
Park of Susan Forty-first, Howard
Boland (who still has hopes of some day
becoming a Supervisor); Forty-third, T.
J. Pinder (who was "killed off" by the
Examiner for Recorder); Forty-fourth,
H. L. Rea; and Forty-fifth, M. H. Her
non of San Rafael.
Boss Phelan, in order that no mistakes
be made in the campaign work, "inti
mated" that his mouthpiece, Charles W.
Fay, be elected chairman. The "inti
mation" carried, as also did the "sugges
tion" that P. I. Boland be made secretary,
whereupon Colonel "Shoot-Low" Sullivan,
who was "Invited to attend" to see that
there was no hitch in the programme like
the one. that occurred at Metropolitan
Hall, Tuesday night, applauded.
The committee then adjourned to meet
to-night, when each committeeman will
be expected to report just in what partic
ular way his district should be organized.

The attorneys certified in writing that they

I neither sought nor asked for the Davis

ANSWER TO HIS
DETRACTORS
Rousing Rally in His
Support.
AN ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
ISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN ARE
ABLY DISCUSSED.
Colonel T. V. Eddy, Who Has Toured
the State, Predicts a Grand
Victory for the Republi
can Ticket.
There was a grand an d enthusiastic
gathering of the friends and supporters
of Julius Kahn, the Republican candi
date for Congress In the Fourth District,
at Metropolitan Temple last night. The
utmost enthusiasm marked the proceed
ings, and the .sentiments expressed by
the speakers were greeted with cheers
that were again and a-gain renewed.
Ex-Attorney General A. L. Hart pre
sided, and after a brief and appropriate
address introduced Julius Kahn as the
next Congressman from the Fourth Dis
trict. As the candidate stepped forward
the cheers were deafening, and it was
several minutes before he was allowed to
commence his speech. He spoke of the
progress made by the country during the
McKinley administration and of the bene
fits to be derive, l by the Pacific Coast and
particularly Sun Francisco by the annex
ation of the Hawaiian Islands. He urged
that a soild Republican delegation be sent
to Congress, so that measures urgently
necessary for the progress of the State
should be Insisted upon, mentioning a ca
ble to Hawaii and the Philippines, im
provement of the great waterways
throughout the State, and locally an ap
propriation for the completion of the new
postoffice. Jn conclusion ho referred to a
personal matter as follows:
"I had hoped to conduct an entirely Im
personal campaign, but i cannot allow
the remarks made by the Governor of
this State In Woodward's Pavilion last
Friday night to go unanswered. 1 have |
lived in this community practically since
my boyhood, and during all of that time
my life has been an open book. I have
never knowingly or willfully committed
a dishonest or dishonorable act. and tne
man does not live into whose eyes 1 can
nut look with entire frankness. I have
served this city in the Legislature of tnis
State during the session of 1893, and my
fellow-citizens; Irrespective of party af
filiations, have repeatedly commended my
course in that body. The facts regarding
my employment as attorney to represent
the University of California before i^e
last Legislature are these:
â¢'ln the latter part of December, 1898.
Mr. J. B. Reins tern; one of the regents of
the university, and whose Interest in the
welfare of that institution has never been
questioned, called upon me to consult with
me regarding a number of bills affecting
the university that he desired to have
introduced In the Legislature. I freely
gave him the benefit of what little experi
ence I possessed in such matters, and
finally, about the middle of January. 1897,
he telephoned me to tome to his otllce at
once 1 went there immediately, and he then
informed me that he had called a num
ber of the regents together and they had
concluded that it would be necessary to
have an attorney upon the ground at
Sacramento during the greater Part of the
session, that they would pay $2iM> for the
work but that all expenses would have to
come out of that fee. He asked me to
accept the appointment. I declined to do
so urging the fact that I did not care to
go away from my office just at that time
or a period of two months. Ho begged
me to accept the offer, pleading that the
interests of the university demanded the
close attendance during the session of
some one familiar with legislative pro
ceedings and legislative matters. I finally
allowed myself to be persuaded to be re
tained in the case, and there was no de
ception or misunderstanding as to the
ternis of the contract. I left for Sacra
mento almost immediately and remained
there practically during the remainder of
1 '''-There "were some four or five bills or
measures, affecting the university, passed
during the session; among them was the
one which enabled Mrs. Phebe A Hearst,
whom I may call the patron saint of the
University of California, to carry out her
magnificent ideas for the construction of
entirely new buildings upon an architec
tural plan that has brought the archi
tects of the world into the competition,
and their preliminary designs were opened
at Antwerp. Belgium, only last week In
the presence of Mrs. Hearst and Mr.
Keinstein. The last bill affecting the uni
versity passed the Senate on the last day
of the Besslon and went to the Governor
for his signature on that day. Of the
J2500 about 80 per cent went for expenses.
such as printing pamphlets and circulars,
clerk hire, hire of stenographers, tele
graphing, telephoning, postage, traveling
expenses and ho on. but not one dollar of
It was used dishonestly or corruptly. If
the claim had been an unjust one, if it
1 ad been a dishonest one would men of
the standing of Judge Slack. George T.
Marye. Arthur Rodgers, Colonel C. F.
Crocker I. W. Hellman. J. West Martin,
J. B. Relnsteln. Judge Wallace. John E.
Hudd, the Governor's own brother, and
the other members of the Board of Re
rents have voted to allow the claim and
to pay It? I say again, the employment
was not of my seeking, and the fee was
not fixed by myself, and every action of
mine throughout the transaction will bear
the closest scrutiny and the most search
ing investigation. ,_ Â± ,
"No man can question the honesty of
Mr. Barry, one of my opponents. During
the same session of the Legislature a bill
was passed to pay his claim for publish
ing the constitutional amendments In his
newspaper, the Star. It was a just claim
and .vis paid, and if any friend of mine
were to try and accuse him of a wrong
ful act in taking the money that he had
honestly earned, I would not for a mo
ment hesitate In resenting tho accusa
tion." â 
In the midst of the candidate's address
the uniformed corps of the Phenix Re
publican Club marched into the hall and
lined up in front of the platform. They
called for three cheers for 'Julius Kahn,
which were heartily given. Then followed
cheers for Gaga and the Republican
ticket. They remained till the close of the
dress.
Hon. Frank McGowan was introduced
as the next speaker. He spoke eloquently
of the issues of the campaign and se
verely criticized Judge Magulre's action
in Congress in opposing the appropriation
for national defenses and the bill for the
exclusion of socialists, anarchists and
nihilists, the last named having been
classed by Magulre as the Democrats of
Russia. He spoke of Julius Kahn's do
ings while in the Legislature, and said
that his reputation was unlmpeached and
unimpeachable, and in the fullest and
grandest sense he was an honest man.
Turning his attention to James H. Barry,
he read an article from his paper which
charged President McKinley with being
in league with "Butcher" Weyler to drag
the Cubans In the dust, and made a hit
by quietly remarking, "Wouldn't he he
a daisy in Congress?" He was repeated
ly cheered for his able effort.
Colonel T. V. Eddy was the last speaker
and he roused the audience to the wild
est enthusiasm. He said he had just
come from the country districts and
brought a message from there that if the
Republicans in San Francisco did their
duty not only would Henry T. Gage be
elected Governor of the State, but the
entire ticket would be elected by a ma
jority of from 25,000 to 50,000. Judge Ma
gulre and the Examiner had departed
from the platform of the Democratic
convention and had raised a false and
fictitious issue of Collls P. Huntington
and the railroad. He defied any Demo
crat to prove that any man on thÂ© Re
publican ticket was or ever had been
under railroad influence. He closed with
a brilliant peroration depicting the suc
cess of the Republican ticket If they
would only stand shoulder to shoulder to
defeat the common enemy, for if Maguire
were elected it would drive the wheels of
time back a quarter of a century.
During the addresses some people in
the hall asked "What about Patton?" and
called forth rousing cheers. At the con
clusion of the addresses the chairman

SERIES OF DEMONSTRATIONS
MASS MEETINGS TO BE HELD IN
EACH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT.
The Revolt of Democrats Against the
Mayor Spreading Daily and
Will Engulf the Entire
Ticket.
The. Republican County Committee Is
preparing to strew more thorns In the
path of Boss Phelan and his subordinates,
and bt :Y>re November 8 the man who
wears the Democratic party under his
Bilk tile will find it would be well to follow
the example set by some of his predeces
sorsâ Buckley, for instance â and not at
tempt to be a buss and seek office at the
Bame time.
The Republican committee met yester
day afternoon and resolved to take every
advantage of the revulsion of feeling that
has set in against the Mayor. From now
on the campaign will be waged with in
creased vigor, and among the plans in
view is one that includes the holding of
eighteen big demonstrations, one Ju each
Assembly district in the cty, at which all
the municipal candidates will appear and
thus become acquainted with all the vot
ers in the city. The dates for these meet-
Ings have not been decided upon yet, but
It is the expectation to begin them next
Monday night, which would give just
eighteen days before election, not includ
ing Sundays.
These mass meetings are to be held un
der the auspices of the county committee
and will be entirely independent of any
meetings that may be arranged by the
State committee, although a conference
between the two bodies will be held and
an arrangement perfected whereby there
will be no eoniiiet in dates. Of course,
if Mr. Gage or any others of the State
nominees are in town and wish to speak
at the district meetings; the county com
mittee will cordially welcome them.
These meetings will also be independent
of the club meetings that are now being
held and will continue all trie close of the
campaign, but the clubs in each district
are expected to attend their district meet
ing in a body.
Another event will be a grand ratifica
tion meeting under the auspices of all the
clubs in town at some date in the near
future to be decided upon by the county
committee. This meeting will be held in
some central locality, possibly the Me
chanics' Pavilion, and promises to be the
largest gathering of the campaign.
The members of the county committee
aro highly elated over the present out
look ami declare that the Republican mu
nicipal ticket will sweep the city, with
possibly one or two minor exceptions.
They say the revolt of the people against
Phelanism has grown to such proportions
and the sentiment against the boss is so
bitter that he will drag the entire Demo
cratic ticket down to defeat with him.
Certain it Is that every candidate on the
Republican ticket is receiving pledges of
Democratic support in large blocks, every
day.

THE PLATFORM
TOO NARROW
FOR HARMONY
One Independent Has
Made Trouble.
SAWYER A TRANSGRESSOR
JOHNNY TEAGUE SAYS KIND
WORDS OF METCALF.
An Incident at Lorin That Is Evi
dence of a Need for Much
Shrewd Diplo
macy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
i Broadway, Oct. 12.
Tho platform of the independents has
proved to be not sufficiently expansive and
clastic. It is a pretty broad platform,
but modern political history has not yet
recorded a buc :essful attempt on the part
of any man to build a platform that can
support Populists of two kinds, Demo
crats of two ways of thinking, Republi
cans of divided opinions and Prohibition
ists. Tills is what was attempted by the
im committee of the Independents,
ami it has partly failed.
The meeting at Lorin last night, at
which the independents made speeches,
was a success from some points of view,
and drew out a good-sized crowd, but
there was a little friction of a nature that,
unless great diplomacy be practiced in
the next three weeks, will seriously hurt
the chances of the independents.
K. W. Sawyer, who has been nominated
by the fusionlsts and indorsed by the in
dependents, and who first came into pub
lic notice as a Prohibition candidate, made
a speech in which he transgressed the
unwritten law of the Independents. It
w&s mutually agreed in the party that it
would support the entire biate Republican
ticket and that it only jumped the traces
in local Republican nominations because
certain bosses had done business in Han
Leandro. Much surprise wn-H, therefore,
shown when Mr. Sawyer undertook to
criticize and berate Victor H. Metcalf,
one of the leading attorneys of the Cali
fornia bar and Republican nominee f<>r
ress from this district. Mr. Sawyer
did not get very fur before be was re
minded that he was transgressing the
rules of the party whose Indorsement he
secured. Then up jumped Johnny Teague.
Teague has been a stalwart Republican
for thirty years, has held office and al
ways ran ahead of his ticket. Mr. Teague
called Mr. Sawyer to order very promptly.
â¢1 have known Mr. Metcalf for twenty
years " said 'league, '"and have always
found him to be straight goods. II- never
has wavered in his allegiance to Repub
licanism, and is a loyal supporter of
everything that McKinley stands for.
When we started this campaign it was
agreed that candidates should confine
themselves to matters r.f public Import
and should not say anything against their
competitors. We presume to be more
honest In politics than the men whom we
inxlous to defeat, and the public is
the best judge of their respective merits.
Mr TeagSe's Ben timents were very
clearly those Âf the audience, and it Is
laid that Mr Sawyer will not be again
fnvlted I to speak from the Independent

THE SXN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1898.
PILLAGERS READY
TO MAKE PEACE
Powwow Held at the
Hostile Camp.
BRAVES IN HIGH FEATHER;
SAY THEY WERE HAVING FUN
WITH THE WHITES.
Assert That Not One of Their Num
ber Was Killed or Wounded
in ' the Recent
Fighting.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL. Oct. 12.â A Walker (Minn.)
special to the Dispatch says: The Bear
Islanders, otherwise the Pillager In
dians, will surrender and war has been
averted. It only remains for the terms
to be arranged before the hostlles will j
come into the agency. j
Father Aloysius Homanutz, Gus H.
Beaulieu and Chief Gay-Gwa-Che-
Way-Blmung, the peace commissioners, j
who left on the Flora last evening for
the hostile camp, got back at 4 o'clock |
this morning. They reached the camp j
at Black Duck Point at the mouth of |
the Boy River, at 9 o'clock last night, j
Indians on watch responded to signals j
and the three commissioners went !
ashore in a skiff, carrying flour, bacon, |
sugar, rice, tobacco and canned goods. i
They met a large number of the Indians
back in the woods and were given a i
cordial greeting. Hands were shaken j
all around and the battle of a week ago
was talked over. The Indians alluded
to it as a "little fun." They asserted !
that none of their number were killed
or wounded.
Bug-Ah-Mah-Ge-Shig was not at the
conference, but his greetings were
shouted across the little bay between
him and the commissioners. He waited
all day for the emissaries to appear and
left for his house across the bay soon
after dark. When the boat got in sight
the Indians sent up skyrockets. After
landing a big fire was built and a con
ference held for three hours.
The Indians were familiar with every
movement of the troops. They asked
why newspaper men had not come out
and said they had expected them. When
it was explained that it was thought
advisable for only a few people to go
out the hostlles laughed at the fears
of the people and invited the corre
spondents to go out to-day. A report in
writing, to be sent to Indian Commis
sioner Jones, was received at a late
hour to-day. The emissaries refused to
make public their report until it had
been submitted to Commissioner Jones,
further than to say that the Indians
will come to the agency when a repiv
Is sent to the statements made by them
through the commissioners.
Mr. Beaulieu says that the council
last night lasted three hours. Chief
Gu-Ne-Won-Aush was very bitter in
denunciation of the manner In which
the Chippewas of Minnesota and Da
kota were being robbed by the lumber
men. The principal cause of the diffi
culty, he said, was not whisky nor the
arrests, but the manner in which the
Indian pine lands are being: stolen.
They had vainly appealed to Washing
ton for several jtars and had finally
taken matt* is In their own hands.
Indian Commissioner Jones left to
day to attend a conference with the
Pillagers. He was accompanied by the
members of the peace party which re
turned this morning with an offer from
the Indians to lay down their arms, but
asking a hearing of their grievances.
Commissioner Jones returned to the
agency this evening, having arranged
for a council at the agency to-morrow,
to which the Indians wll send a delega
tion. The Commissioner said:
"I think this matter can be settled
In a short time."
AGNEWS ATTENDANTS
INJ FIST FIGHT
SAN JOSE, Oct. 12.â The attendants at
Agnews Asylum are having more trouble
among themselves. On Friday N. E.
Biggy and Paul Pickertag engaged in a
fist fight, and both have been suspended
until an investigation can be held. The
matter was reported at to-day's meeting
of the Board of Managers. Pickering
was the only combatant present and af
ter he told his story to the managers the
case went over without a date being set
for the hearing.
There are several factions among the
attendants and there has be-on more or
less trouble evor since the big- whitewash
ing at the institution several months ajco
This culminated in the fight on Friday.
Pickering had occasion to telephone to
Biggy in one of the wards that day, and
Hlggy could not be found. Pickering re
ported this to Dr. Sponogle.
Later in tho day liiggy and Pickering
met. The former accused Pickering of
having run to Sponogle with tales. Pick
ering called Uiggy a liar, whereupon
Biggy hit him on the eye. The men
mixed things and before they could be
separated liiggy had given Pickering a
good thrashing. Dr. Sponogle then sus
pended both men until the meeting of the
board.
Yesterday Biggy and Pickering met in
a Second street saloon in this city and
reni wed their quarrel. Bystanders inter
fered and prevented a personal encoun
ter. Pickering then went before Justice
Klrkpatrick and had Biggy arrested for
battery. He was released on bail.
Uiggy Is a brother of Registrar Biggy
of San Francisco and was placed in the
asylum by Gould. Pickering is a rela
tive of Trustee Curnow. Both men will
probably be dismissed.
SAILED UNDER
SEALED ORDERS
Speculation as to the Objective
Point of the Battleships
lowa and Oregon.
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â The bat
tleships Oregon and lowa sailed
to-day with sealed orders from
Washington. There has been
considerable speculation as to
the destination of the battle
ships. It was first stated that
they would proceed direct to Ma
nila, but subsequent reports
threw some doubt upon this, and
Honolulu may be their objective
point, though from there they
may proceed to Manila to
strengthen Admiral Dewey's po
sition.
The United States colliers
Scandia and Celtic followed
the battleships out to sea.

MRS, ALLBRECHT
NUMBER THREE
Architect Claimed by
Another Woman.
WEDDED A SAN DIEGO MISS
SHE IDENTIFIES A LIKENESS
IN THE CALL.
Declares That She Was Deserted by
the Man Now Awaiting Trial
in banta Rosa for
Bigamy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 12.â Another sen
sation was developed here to-day in the
case of Charles Allbrecht, the San
Francisco architect, at present occupy
ing a cell in the County Jail and the ,
attention of the courts. A few weeks
ago Allbrecht was arrested on a charge
of having obtained goods by f-alse pre
tense, he having issued a fraudulent
check upon the First National Bank of
San Francisco to Brooks & Loomls, a
dry goods firm here, in payment of his
bride's trousseau.
The story of his arrest and the de
scription of the man published in the
San Francisco papers attracted the at
tention of a young lady he had married
about a year before in Oakland and as
a result papers which had been lying
in the desk of the Deputy Sheriff there
for several months because of inability
to locate Allbrecht were sent to Santa
Rosa and served at once. Allbrecht
was next charged with bigamy, after
which wife No. 2 began a suit for di
vorce. A few days afterward a charge
of perjury was lodged against him and
the officers began to think things would
quiet down in his line for a time at
least.
To-day's mail brought information
which shows that still other preempts
are to be heard from. In much the
same manner in which the wife known
till to-day as No. 1 of Oakland learned
of her truant husband's whereabouts
a previous wife living in -San Diego has
located him, and from her letter re
ceived by Deputy District Attorney
I>eppo to-day facts are gleaned which
show that thp ambitious architect is at
present the husband of at least three
women.
The letter states that five years ago
the writer, then known as Anna Chris
tianson, was married to Allbrecht in
Pan Diego and as yet has never been
divorced. The description tallies ex
actly with that of the man in jail here,
and the writer states that she recog
nizes the picture published in The Call.
She says there is no doubt as to the
man's identity.

that work, said to-night:

rates on the proposed shipment of silver I
bullion. There Is no hurry about this I

ciety Cables $1700.
THE HOSPITAL WAS DEPLETED
MORE MONEY WILL BE SENT
WHEN IT IS NEEDED.
j
The Soldiers Find It Much Harder
to Withstand Manila's Climate
Than the Spanish
Bullets.
Medicines, dainties for convalescent sol
diers and a whole lot of now hospital
equipment are needed by those heroes of
the conquest of Manila, the boys of the
First California. They have found it a
harder thing to stand up smilingly
against ravages of the inhospitable Phil-
Itppine climate than against the fierce
fusillades of Spanish bullets, and as a
consequence the regiment hospital and
pharmacy are depleted *J! the things most
net-ded.
On Monday a cablegram arrived at the
headquarters of the State Red Cross So
ciety from (>. H. J. Sc-hlott, the society"?
! principal ag.^nt in Manila, setting forth
the needs of the regiment and asking for
funds with which to provide them.
The response of the society was sub
stantial and prompt. It was nothing
more nor less than a cable order for
JlOOo, and Instructions to Mr. Schlott to
draw upon the London and Shanghai
Bank, at Shanghai, for 1700 more which
! is on deposit there.
This amount will be more than enough
. to provide the. boys of the gallant First
i with the things they need, and, as Mrs.
John B. Harrington said last night, "Just
< as soon as those boys want more they can
; have it if they will only let us know."
The funds sent Mr. Schlott will be
i used in the big Red Cross Hospital that
' has been established near the camp of the
First. The needs of the regimental hos
i pital will probably be taken fare of by
( the local society, if the Government does
S not in the meantime provide for its own.
GOING TO MANILA.
Major-General Merriam Formally
Assigns the Troops for the
Senator.
The formal order for the troops to em

who remain behind. Yesterday General
Miller Issued an order for the i irst Brig
ade to form on Lombard avenue, and Col
onel Funston a similar one to the Second
Brigade. The turning out of the two brig
adea is a token of respect to Colonel
Berry and his command. General Miller
also Issued yesterday a farewell address
to the regiment. In which he expressed
his high admiration of the faithful man
ner in which the regiment had performed
the arduous duties of camp life. He also
spoke of the friendly feeling that had al

gard lor it for Its general efficiency, and
for /the patriotic spirit that prompted it
to Answer its country's call, and that he
would always have only the most pleas
ant memories of the Seventh California.

Artillery who died at the post hospital
on Tuesday night, was buried yesterday.
His death was due to typhoid fever.
Lieutenant Colonel Wagner, recently
promoted to the Fourth Cavalry, has had

Solano Court Has Decided That Good
Templars' Home Is Entitled to
a Fortune.
A decision was rendered In the Superior
Court of Solano County on Tuesday
which sustains the provisions of the will
made by the late E. A. T'pham and de
chires that the Good Templars' Home at
Vallejo is entitled to claim any property
bequeathed to it by the testator.
In September. 189T, Upham died and dis
posed of an estate of $200,000 by willing
one-third of it to the Good Templars'
Home and the remainder to his nieces
and nephews, children, of J. M. and L. M.
I'pham. Two brothers of the deceased
soon afterward brought suit to recover
the entire estate on the ground that the
provisions of the will wore illegal. In
denying their claim Judge Buckles said:
"After a careful reading of the will,
and applying the law as I understand it
to be in this State, there seems to me to
be no legal objection to the bequests and
devices made by the testator. Neither the
device to the children of .1. M. or Li. M.
Upham nor to the Orphans' Home is in
violation of any law in this State or
contrary to any decision in the Supreme
Court. The manifest intention of the tes
tator is clearly seen, and is capable of be
ing fully executed by the executors.
Therefore, and as the applicants are not
devisees and the whole estate being dis
posed of by will, the applicants are not
entitled to a partial distribution."
Judge J. M. Walley and R. Thompson
conducted the case for the Orphans'
Home.

Held for Trial for Defrauding
Bomantic Grangers.
The preliminary examination of Isaac
W. Bain and Mrs. Grace Allison on a Fed
eral Indictment, charging them with run
ning a bunko matrimonial bureau, was
begun yesterday before United States
Commissioner Heacock. J. L. Duprey of
"Winters, Yolo County, took the stand and
told how, yearning for a wife to console
him with lier love and a little money, ho
had answered the gold-brick advertise
ment of the Bain Bureau and entered into
correspondence with Mrs. Allison, who
was represented to be a widow with $35,
000 in cash, just pining for a nice old
rancher to spend it for her. He made her
â i present of a $500 piano and valuable jew
elry and found that the lady did not love
and that he had gone up against a braeÂ©
him and that he had gone up against a
brace game.
William E. Looney. an ex-schoolmaster
from Kansas by way of Skaguay. narrat
ed how he had paid Bain $5 to be intro
duced to the widow and how. after two
unsatisfactory interviews, he had ceased
to woo her. He wanted consolation and
money too.
Rancher Duprey laughed heartily at the
testimony of Schoolmaster Looney. and
the latter was equally amused listening
to the rancher's story.
Commissioner Heacock held the defend
ants to answer with bail at 51000 each.
They at once furnished cash bail In the
sum of $2000 and were released.
MUST REFUND THE MONEY.
Judge de Haven Decides That Wil
liam J. Bryan Must Refund the
Money Stolen by His
Subordinate.
The United States Court of Appeals yes
terday affirmed the judgment of the Cir
cuit Court in the case of the United States
against William J. Bryan, as principal,
and Jesse D. Carr, W. F. Herrin and oth
ers, as executors of the will of W. W.
Stow deceased, to recover $93ii9 and inter
est from April 30. 1592.
The money was embezzled by Clerk
Kennedy of the Money Order Department
in the S~?.n Francisco postoffice during tho
administration of William J. Bryan as
Postmaster. Kennedy was convicted and
spent a termÂ»in the State Prison for thnt
offense. Bryan refused to make good the
amount stolen by the clerk on the ground
that Kennedy was not an appointee of his
and that he was under the civil service
system. The Circuit Court held that
Bryan was responsible for the acts of his
official subordinates, whether appointed
by him or serving under the civil service
system.
The decision of the Court of Appeals
rendered yesterday by Judge de Haven
was that the Postmaster was responsible
for the money of the office and that it was
his duty to exercise official supervision
over the clerk to ensure that all the
money was accounted for.

country show that there is still a menace from the

FOR COUNTY AUDITOR.
rOR the responsible office of County Auditor
the Republican party presents as its candidate
a thoroughly representative business man â Mr.
Asa R. Welis. This is one of the strongest and best
nominations of the year, and it cannot fail to have
the commendation and support of all citizens who
desire to provide for our county affairs an adminis
tration of sterling integrity and high efficiency.
Mr. Wells has long been identified with the busi
ness interests of San Francisco. He is one of the
leaders in our industrial and commercial activities,
and has for years taken a prominent part in the ad
vancement of the community. He has not, however,
confined his thoughts or his energies to business life.
He is one of those broad-minded, public-spirited men
who take a keen interest in the politics of the city,
State and nation, ar.d who work as energetically for
the public good as for the upbuilding of their private
fortunes. He has been an honored and sagacious ad
viser in Republican councils, has been zealous in sup
porting its principles and its candidates in every cam
paign, and. while meriting the suffrages of his fellow
citizens generally by reason of his fitness for the
office to which he ha* been nominated, has a particu
larly strong claim upon all loyal Republicans.
The importance to the county of a m2n of stanch
integrity and sound business judgment in the office of
Auditor is recognized by all who have any knowledge
of the duties of the office. Mr. Wells, by his natural
aptitude for matters of finance and the supervision of
accounts, and by the experience of his business train-
Ing, is peculiarly well fitted to render the highest ser
vice to the community in that position.
It may be accounted a good fortune that the county
has the opportunity of obtaining such a man for the
office. Hi? nomination is in accord with the general
desire to have business men of standing and repute
take charge of the affairs of the municipality, and
he ought, therefore, to receive the votes of all who
wish to bring about in San Francisco honest poli
tics, good government and municipal reform ;n; n the,
direction of honesty, economy and efficiency.
General Merritt will be pained to know that the
Spanish do not like him.
APHORISTIC MAGUIRE.
THE fusion papers in the country have broken
out with a smallpox of '"Aphorisms by Ma
guire." These aphorisms relate to equal rights,
special privileges, etc.. and are mainly extracted from
I etches in favor of land confiscation.
His diatribes against land-owners are*usual!y in
troduced by references to the rights oJ "God's chil
dren" and denunciations of monopoly. The fusion
papers print these texts or introductions, but care
rom exposing anything that follows in
the sennoi ; would find Maguire denouncing
their country subscribers, the rural land-owners, as
"cunning robbers, who have despoiled the weak and
undesigning." as "sordid extortionists" who make
"God's children pay tribute to them for the privilege
of inhabiting God's earth," and as wrongdoers
whose "investment in land must be destroyed." who
may "complain that to destroy it is a hardship, and
so it will be. but it .vill be just. "
The Placer Herald in its last issue quotes this
aphorism: "Give to all citizens equal rights in all
that constitutes the country, and disaffection, the germ
of dissolution, can never live within our countn'.
You cannot conceive of a time when, under such a
recognition of equal rights, sedition could be fo
mented or organized. â Hon. James G. Maguire.
speech on 'Free Homesteads,' House of Representa
tives, March 10, 1898."
If the Herald will print all of that speech on "Free
Homesteads" it will find it to be a declaration of war
against land-owners, whose lands, it declares, must be
taken from them to be given as free homesteads to
"God"? children.' In that speech Maguire said:
"Equity does not permit property in land; for
if one portion of the earth's surface may become
fully the possession of an individual and may be
held by him for his sole use and benefit, as a
thing to which he has an exclusive right, then all
portions of the earth's surface may be so held and
our planet may thus lapse into private hands.
Whether it may be altogether expedient to admit
claims of a csrtain standing is not to the point.
We have nothing to do with considerations of
conventional privilege or legislative convenience.
We have simply to inquire what is the verdict of
pure equity in this matter. And this verdict en
joins a protest against every existing pretension
to individual ownership of the soil and dictates
the assertion that the right of mankind to the
earth at large is still valid, all deeds, customs and
laws notwithstanding. Not only have present land
titles an indefensible origin, but it is impossible
to discover any mode by which land can become
private property. The world is God's bequest to
mankind. Ail men are joint heirs to it. You are
among the number, and because you have taken
up residence upon a certain part of it, subdued,
cultivated and beautified that partâ improved i%
as you say â you are net therefore warranted in
appropriating it as your piivate property. At
least, if you do so, you may at any moment be
justly expelled by the lawful owner, society."
There is tl* preached Ml lire in his
eh on "Free Homesteads." House of Representa
rch io. 1898." from which the Placer Her
rades ts text We invite the Herald
to print it all. and see how the land-owners who have
: beautified the Gateway from
Rocklin to Cisco like it. They will all declare that
the Government sold the land to them or their
grar.: that they ] . : their money for it and it
is theirs. In the same speech Maguire answers them.
He says: "How can this be done since we have sold
the land? Why. we sold it subject to the unlimited
right of taxation, reserved by the Federal and State
Gove- Exercise that right by concentrating
â¢ xes on lar.d values, and the only incentive men
>.aye to own land will be instantly taken away."
So the land-owr.ers of Rocklin, Loomis, Penryn,
Newcastle. Auburn. Appiegate and Coifs x. and the
ers of lowa Hill, Forest Hill and Dutch Flat, are
to be robbed of their holdings "instantly" by the
tax.
Will r e Herald print the speech and see how they
feel about this recipe for curing "disaffection"?
Chief Justice Marshall said, truly, that "the power
to tax is the power to destroy." It has been so used
-ants in all ages. Revolutions have been caused
by destructive exercise of the taxing power. Ma
guire simply proposes to use the taxing power to
destroy private ownership of land, to destroy in
srart'.y every dollar invested in land.
The Herald has taken up this issue by printing the
text, the aphorism, of the speech. It cannot decently
avoid printing the speech.
f?N EXAMPLE FOR FITZGERALD.
1 1 X PRESS companies in this country are not su
preme. This view may appear to President
- â * Valentine of the Wells-Fargo to be ultra
radical, but the law sustains it.
A test case was recently brought in the Circuit
Court of Michigan, and the Attorney General of that
commonwealth did not consider it beneath his dig
nity to appear for the people. He not only made an
argument, but his views wen sustained, and the man
damus prayed for was ordered to issue. The effect
of this was to make the American Express Company
receive and forward packages and affix to the receipts
a revenue stamp paid for by itself.
Out here the Welis-Fargo Company has made con
tentions similar to those of the American. It has
forced the customer to pay for the stamp, notwith
standing the specific provision of the statute to the
contrary. In most instances the imposition has been
submitted to. because the patron had no time to
bring the matter to an issue. In the solitary excep
tion the company was beaten, and appealed the case,
for delay to it is almost as good as actual triumph.
Attorney General Fitzgerald should imitate the
excellent example set by the Michigan official.
There can be no doubt as to the result. The Wefls-
Fargo people not only would be obliged to accept
packages and pay for the necessary stamps, but as
a common carrier, subject to wholesome regulation,
woftld not dare to make an extra charge for the ser
vice. The common carrier has a distinct place in
law. The conditions which obtain between private
parties to a contract are absent when a common car
rier is concerned.
Mr. Fitzgerald should at once proceed against the
Wells-Fargo Express Company. The law as well as
justice would be on his side, and he would have the
backing of a clearly defined and unassailable pre
cedent.

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1893.
JIM REA of Santa Clara, commonly known as
the "boss" of San Jose, has been giving evi
dence in the case of Jarman against Rea for
slander. He has made use of the occasion as an In
dian brave makes use oi the ceremony of the ghost
dance, to chant the war song of his deeds and his
virtues, to taunt his friends with over-candid words,
and to hurl a bully defiance at his foes.
Rea is not a poet, his song comes not in rhyme or
rhythm, but he displays such an exuberance 01 pic
turesque words and trumpeting phrases in the flow of
his swearfui prose as to prove he possesses a. true
dithyrambic fecundity. No one can listen to his
ghost dance song on the witness stand, or even read
it. without being aware that Jim needs only a higher
aspiration of soul and a better education to have been
quite a troubadour.
The reports of the proceedings of the trial tell us
that in giving his testimony 'Jim?y," as his loving
friends familiarly call him. "was very loquacious,"
and after a time his loquacity went so far "the court
was obliged to admonish the witness to confine him
seif to answering questions." The reports do not
tell us the e:tect of the court's action, nor was it
necessary they should. It goes without saying that
no admonition ever had any other effect on Jitnsy
than that of stirring him up and making him a little
inrlier and a little uglier than before.
When asked in what capacity he took it upon him
self to "run" the Common Council he chanted his
ghost song in this wise: "As a citizen of San Jose,
to protect the public treasury from the inroads of
scoundrels, and to see that honest and efficient people
are in public places. I never in my life received one
quarter of a dollar from any source whatever for the
appointment of any one. or for the advocacy of any
ire before a public body, and a man that does,
.pinion, is unht to be an American citizen."
A little later the brave went on to tell of a certain
job that had been put through the Common Council,
eh it appears some of the Councilmen got
a rake-off. He was then asked why he had not ex
posed that iniquity and prevented it. Whereupon he
sang in a minor key: "Oh, it was not a great wrong.
I did not consider it to be a great wrong. It was only
the amount of a few hundred dollars. I consid
ered it a wrong in the sense that it was being i
but I did not consider that from my position and the
position of my friends who are in this community it
would justify me in creating a public scandal, which
I would get the worst of in some way or other."
Then having in this belittling way made light of the
small steal and cast a pale shadow of suspicion on
his friend?, he resumed his louder tone and sang his
own praise again, while those shocked and astounded
friend? listened in amazement. "I am in politics,"
chanted Mr. Rea, "and whenever I locate a man who
if receiving money either as a public official or out
side of public office for his political influence. I mark
him about all the way from 75 per cent to zero, and
politics come up again I turn his picture to
the wall and proceed accordingly."
And now the people of Santa Gara County are
longing for a look in Jim's private picture gallery
that they may learn ju-t how many of the portrait?
of his friends are hanging face ontward to gladden his
honest soul when he looks upon them.
A LESSON FOR ThE HOME MARKET.
A VALUABLE lesson for Pacific Coast people
was recently given to a reporter of the Port
land Telegram by a New York commercial
traveler engaged in selling Eastern goods in the
Western market. The commercial man stated he
could sell New York woolen goods in Oregon at bet
ter prices than the Oregon mills charge, notwith
standing the Oregon goods are the better.
When asked for an explanation of this seeming
contradiction of the rule that the best goods at the
lowest co<t always get the trade, the Xew Yorker
said: "There is a certain prejudice against Western
manufactured goods. Anything from the East is
supposed to be all right. Therefore shoddy goods
can be sold as long as they bear the Eastern trade
mark. It is fashion that rules the trade world. We
work the prejudice strong for all it is worth."
On this showing it will be seen the prejudice in
favor of Eastern goods is a very costly one for the
Western consumer. It would be cheaper to support
two vices than that one single prejudice. To main
tain it the customer mustj)ay the freight on Western
raw material across the continent, and the freight on
the manufactured goods back again, and finally a
higher price for the imported article than he would
have had to pay for a better one made by home man
ufacturers.
The lesson conveyed in this statement of facts,
while pertinent to the whole of the Great West, is
particularly so to California. No State in the Union
suffers more than this from the folly of patronizing
Eastern made goods and neglecting those made at
home. We ship to the East large quantities of raw
material â leather, wool, hops, fruit, etc. â and buy
back manufactured articles made of these by East
ern mills when the same classes of goods of erual
and often of superior quality are manufactured here
and can be bought for less money.
For the upbuilding of our great commonwealth
and for the advancement of its industries and the wel
fare of its labor there is necessary a change in the
attitude of the purchasing public toward local manu
factures. California should have a home market for
the products of its industry.
If there is to be any prejudice in trade it should in
cline to the side of the home product. That would
be the application of the great principle of protection
to private life, and the principle would prove as berle
ficial in that way as in national legislation. To pay
high prices for Eastern goods when Western goods
are better is a folly of which no intelligent man ought
to be gtiilty. It makes the New Yorkers laugh at us.
China's Empress seems to be a terror. If half the
stories told of her are true, she is a disgrace even to
the antiquated old dynasty which has for so many
years declined to progress. While the greed of the
powers in reaching for pieces of China is shameful,
the virago on the throne will kill off any tendency
toward sympathy.
In the matter of avoiding taxes the rich and highly
respectable New Yorker can easily give the rest of
the world points. However, in communities in which
false swearing is regarded as in bad taste, the method
might not work smoothly.
One mistake about the war investigation seems to
have been that Julian Hawthorne was not selected to
be all the witnesses and the entire jury. Still, the up
roar of Julian is almost unseemly.
Count Castellane seems to have a business turn of
mind and to be devoting its full energies to getting
some of the gold Jay Gould heaped up by years of
honest toil.
Zola's home has been saved to him. a circumstance
showing him to have some friends, which is more
than his persecutors can boast.
JIM REfi'S GHOST SONG.
TROUBLE CAUSED BY A
SIMILARITY OF NAMES,
Attorney William H. Jordan Steeped
in Woe Because of the Political
Aspirations of the Master
of Ceremonies.
IT has been apparent for weeks that something was
wrong with William H. Jordan, the well-known at
torney, but until yesterday, when he unbosomed him
self to one of his friends, the source of his trouble
was a mystery. The friend had encountered a-delega
tion from the Ministerial Union as he entered Jordan
office in the Claus Spreckels building, and he attempted
a .-â¢arm- by asking the lawyer if he was a back
slider, and the delegation was trying to yank him back
into the fold. _Â
â No, 'Han't that.' and Jordan sighed wearil> .
"though I guess I'll be a backslider Cast enough if this
thing keeps up much longer."
"What's wrong, old fellow?" asked the other, his
sympathies fully excited by the look of misery that
overspread Jordan's features.
"Well, I'll tell you all about it. for I can't keep it
to myself much longer. It's just wearing me out; that s
what it is." - :i--.: i --.
Jordan heaved a sigh that told of long and keen

"Wfll-er-nâ that is, yes, once; but purely in the in

get a drink to compose my nerves when you came in."
"So Billy's going to promote the boxing industry, i=
he?" remarked the frK-nd.
"It looks that way. But that isn't all of my trou
ble; it's just an 'incident," and the harassed Jordan,
whose first name is aJso William, reeled off another
chapter of woe. "It's funny that none of the churches
ever think of holding fairs only in election years and
right during the campaign. I calculate that every
church in town is running from one to seven of these
cinch garrif-s right now. and I've invested in every one
< >f them. No. it's no use trying to explain. You know
how much chance a man has to make explanations to
an office full of women all talking at once and each
shaking a bundle of tickets in his face. There's only
one way to get rid of them; that's to inve?t. I'
vested until I'm behind in my household expenses, anJ
they're Btill coming.
"Then there's the ward politician, who comes in just
when I am engaged with my wealthiest client, and
wants to negotiate a block of votes, giving a written
euarantee that he can deliver the goods. He always
call? me 'Billy.' and spits on the carpet. There's lots
of him. and if the other Jordan is buying votes he can
get enough to elect him Governor. Th* corner grocery
hanger-on, who has only his own vote to sell, would
make an army. My office is overrun with them: the
watchman ha? to use force to drive them out of the
hall: the elevators are packed with them, and
time I pass along the street I head a procession of them.
It's awful. And the worst of it is, Vm *-â  ' â¢â¢â â¢-â *â¢
any peace at night. There's a regular ma.Â«s meeting
in front of my house at 111S Gough street every even
ing, while the sign painters and printers clamor for
my advertising; the tradespeople who want to put the
â Jordan hat' or the 'master of ceremonies' necktie," and
a hundred other toilet articles, on the market for a
suitable consideration, is appalling.
"Say. do I look like a man who would get into a
prize ring and ask the assembled gentlemen to please
refrain from smoking? This thing has got to stop.
I'm going down now and get a sign painter to scratch
my name off the door and then I'm going into the coun

old name ought to be good enough for him."
Then the long suffering Jordan left instructions with
the office boy to tell anybody who called to see mm

i ROMAN NTMERALS-Elaine. Elk, Cal.
This department has delved into ancient
and modern books in a vain endeavor to
discover how the Romans of ancient
times carried on their calculations with
the numerals. A French writer, who de- |
Clares that his hair turned gray in an
effort to ascertain how the calculations i
were carried on, wrote: "The Romans
assuredly had rules for calculating, but 'â 
they were for the simplest operation of I
the most terrifying complications." This
department has been unable to find any
mention of the use of fractions by the
Romans in their calculations, but if they
did use them then the complications must
have been more terrifying than those
suggested by the French writer. Five
hundred Is expressed by D. ISSS by ;
MDCCCLXXXVIII. and a million is ex
pressed by the letter M with a bar over i
it. The addition of these three sets of
numbers - would be represented by
MMDCCCLXXXVIII. the first M having '
i a bar over it. Another writer says that
"life is too short to attempt to ascertain ,
how the ancient Romans calculated, and '
it would be a useless waste of valuable
time as the cumbersome methods could
not be utilized." . . v
FITZGERALD'S
. GOOD RECORD
To the Editor of The Call: I Bee
with pleasure that in the inter- of
good government you urge the election
of General "William F. Fitzgerald, pres
ent Attorney General, to the place of
City and County Attorney of San Fran
cisco. It' ever a man deserved the
confidence and esteem of his country
men General Fitzgerald is thar*man.
When but 22 years of age. in the State
of Mississippi, he raised the standard
of the Republican party, and alone
went into every county in that Stati
championing the cause of Republican
ism, and he had the respect and es
teem of every man in the State.
He was nominated for Attorney Gen
eral against his wish, and had for his
opponent General Catching* one of the
foremost Democrats of the State, and.
although Catchinga was elected. Fitz
gerald ran 15,000 votes ahead of his
ticket so powerful was his oratory
arid so noble his conduct. He was
elected District Attorney of the \ lcks
burg District in Mississippi and se
lected almost without opposition. He
resigned and was appointed District
Judge In Arizona by President Arthur
without application on his part, and
with the earnest support of Senator
Laraar, a Democrat.
After a brilliant career there he some
sixteen years since came to Los An
geles, where he practiced law with
equal success for years.
He was appointed Supreme Court
Commissioner, as I happen to know,
without solicitation on his part or his
friends. He resigned that place to
practice law in San Francisco.
He was appointed to the Supreme
bench and was one of the best and
most popular Judges who ever sat on
that bench.
He was nominated and elected Attor
ney General, where be now is pursuing
a most distinguished and brilliant ca
reer.
He has never Bought office: it has
come to him without solicitation.
In the estimation of our most dis
tinguished lawyers and citizens he i 3
an id#al candidate for City and County
Attorney. A more honorable man. a
better citizen, a cleaner man in public
and private life does not live. I have
known and loved him since he was
9 and I 12 years of age. At this
time, when true patriotism should rule
the hour, this distinguished citizen,
able lawyer, brave soldier and pure
gentleman should receive the vote of
every true lover of his country.

PRESERVATION
OF THE FORESTS
-" The Call: Permit me to ex
my thanks for th- persistent man
ner in -which you advocate the protec
: <>ur forests from destruction by
fire. While camping near Mount Shasta
the past summer I was greatly im
pressed by the terrible effects of forest
fires. It ia bad enough to see the -
cut down so rapidly for lumber,
but it seems still Â« me I see the
rigs swept away by fire, leaving
the mountain* practically a desert.
By a wise supervision much of this
annual destruction could be prevented.
Forests might be separated into blocks
by the clearing of wide lanes, which
would act as barriers if a lire was once
startt- i N tksefl and warnings might
be posted extensively and fir<
might patrol the mure exposed d;
during the summer. I trust you will
kt-fp up the agitation and that th<* n^xt
iture Will take h-:<-;d of the :
in earnest. If our forests are burned
our State loses half of its wealth.

South 42aCHIEF LEES MAY
SEEK TO BRING
OTHER CHARGES
A Writ Will Not End
the Botkin Case.
SEVEN MORE COMPLAINTS
CrOVERNOR'S WARNING WAS IN
GOOD TAITH.
The Defense Recalls Significant
Threats Made by Lees
Before the Gov
ernor.
Chief Lees Is It.
Until yesterday he had not arrived at a
full comprehension of what that little
coup effected on Tuesday by the Botkin
defense meant to the prosecution.
Yesterday, however, he arrived. Ho
realized that Governor Budd's recent
warning to him was out of the, kindness
of the executive heart and in good faith.
When the extradition matter was first
officially noticed L>y the Governor he in
formed Chief Lees that, no matter what
decision was rendered, the course of vie
prosecution would be forced to the ends
of the defense; that Chief Lees' case was
in a bad liyht then and would be worse
after the decision. It is noticeable that
the Chief is of late seldom unadorned by
his glasses.
The scheme worked on Monday by the
defense which resulted in the habeas
corpus proceedings being thrown into the
Superior Court instead of the Supreme
Court- for final settlement robbed the
prosecution vi the right of any appeal.
From Superior Court rulings there is no
appeal In habeas corpus proceedings.
If Judj<e Couk and his colleagues; sit- |
ting in bank, grant the petition for a writ j
of habeas corpus, the one course remain- j
Ing to tho prosecution is the liling of a
complaint in this State upon whatever j
charge against Mrs. Botkin the Code j
permits.
Governor Budd is of. the opinion that I
she can be tried in California upon tiie. j
full charge of murder. Chief Lees ha-s
stated that in his opinion the only charges I
preferable here are attempt to murder j
an<l mixing poison with food. Whichever j
charge is possible, a writ of habeas cor
pus will finally dispose of any further
extradition possibilities so" far as the mur
ii.-r of Mrs. Dunning- is concerned. 1 here j
will still remain, however, the charge lor
the murder of Mr*. Deane, and it is
thought that, all else falling. Lees Will
sÂ«.-ek to hold custody of his prisoner by
resi?rtiiiK to the alternative charge.
The basis of this belief is in a threat i
ninde by Chief Lees Before Attorney Gen
eral Fitzgerald. He said: "There were
two people killed and seven of them poi
soned by eating that candy, and .1
George Knight tries to monkey with me
I'll bring charges on every case."
As it is apparent that "George Knight
has monkeyed" with the Cliief with some i
little success; the defense is of the opin- :
ion that the Chief intends to arrange '
with the Delaware authorities to have j
further charges brought and further ex
tradition asked for.

Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Oct. 4.â A little after 11
o'clock last night martial law was de
clared In Honolulu. Announcement of
the new dispensation was made by Sec
1 ond Lieutenant Merriain, U. S. A., son
i of -Major General Merrlam, command
1 ing the Department of the Pacific, in
, which is included the Hawaiian Islands.
t With Merriam was First Lieutenant
i WheelocVNew York First Regiment,
â  U. S. A.
1 Martial law was actually enforced by
! Merriam and Wheelock for two and a
, half hours. This was done without any
,' authority whatever, with utter disre
i gard to the civil laws and with an lg
'â  riorintr, or worse, of the police.
; Merriam and Wheelock conducted
themselves in a manner most astonish- I
' ing. Wheelock was provost marshal,
1 : in charge of the mounted infantrymen.
i Merriam may or may not have been on i
: duly. At any rate the officers assumed j
, | entire control, ordered citizens off the
! streets, then off the sidewalks and en
! forced their mandates through the
j mounted men. Army men, for manage
': merit of whom it is supposed that at
| least Wheelock was detailed, kept away
i from the neighborhood. â-
Both Merriam and Wheelock were die
' tatorial to the point of insulting citi
! Zens who happened to- be about. Wheel
i ock engaged in a brawl with some sail-
I ors from a merchant ship. He followed
I them clear down to the docks and had
- a pair of his patrolmen chase two in
ter-island steamer captains to box piles
!on the wharf. A customs officer was ,
: also made to scramble for safety.
About 1 O'clock General King was
i awakened from his slumbers at the
Hawaiian Hotel and told of what was
! going on. He seemed genuinely sorry
I anil was angry to white heat, in rela-
I tion to Merriam General King said that
I the young man had no orders what- |
I ever, and that he (King) would not
| have had the affair happen far $20,000.
i Merriam had used General King's name
i a number of times, saying that the ;
! commander in chief had ordered him to I
â¢take charge" at 11:30 o'clock and keep |
the streets clear.
General King had the two officers
rounded up and their martial law or
der was declared off. Both men were
I drunk. They will be court-martialed.
j Concerning the affair General King
said at noon to-day: "I have hard ;
â¢' words to tell you how inexpressibly |
sorry 1 am that such an occurrence
i should have happened. My friend,
Commander Taussig of the Bennmg
ton, was 'kind enough to come to my
room some time after midnight and let
me know what was going on. 1 at once
sent Captain Saxton, my aid, to inves
tigate, which he did. This morning I
; have had both officers before me and
I Captain Bowers of the police has told
:me what he witnessed. You must un
derstand that no complaint has been
made to me by any one, nor have the
civic authorities taken any action, j My
investigations show that Lieutenant
Wheelock was alone to blame. It is I
true Lieutenant Merriam was with him, i
but he was not on duty and cannot be :
â  held responsible. Wheelock was on j
duty and if Merriam was drunk and
disorderly he should have arrested him.
As I said before the responsibility was ,
on Wheelock, and 1 believe him to have '
been so drunk that he was not ac- j
countable for his actions. Having thus j
decided, I have ordered that Wheelock
! be relieved from duty and another man
put in his place."
"What does that amount to, general,
as a punishment?" was asked.
"Loss of pay and prestige for one
thing, besides the disgrace," was the
answer. "No, a court-martial does not
necessarily follow, nor Is it likely in this I
case. Unless some further complaint is !
made the matter may be considered as |
ended. I shall, of course, send a report
of the affair to Washington."
While thf Hawaiian planters have
; not made any overtures to the sugar
trust, the latter has made overttu
| the planters, and is now openly in the
field with an offer to contract for the
Hawaiian sugar crop Cor th" next three
years, expressly stipulating that the
; present arrangement with the new Cal
ifornia refinery shall continue, which
means that the Port Costa refinery is
to get 60,000 tons annually and the bal
anc< goes to K;mi FranclÃco or New
York, as the trust may* decide. ThÂ»
'present contract with Howard & Co, of
New York by which some of the sugar
â  goes over the Southern Pacific ami
some via Cape Horn expires on January
1 next, and it is V : that they (
waive any rights they have to a re-
I newal in favor of the trust. Howard j
& Co. have sold theii Bugars to the
trust at a profli this year, but why
the trust has allowed this is a mys-
This offer was under consideration
at a recent meeting, but nothing was
decided, owing to the absence of twon
prominent planters. it was decided,
however, that the California Beet i
r and Refining Company, in other
words tho new refinery at Port Costa,
will receive the same quota of sutrar
next year from Hawaiian plantations
as it has from the present crop, and
more of it if required. Another sub
ject under discussion was whether the
present contract with the new refinery
should be allowed to run on for an- I
other year or whether another new one
should be entered into for two or even
three years more. An agreement was
i ached for next year and will likely
be consummated in a few days, but
ay to the advisability of extending the i
contract fur two or three years, no de- !
cision was arrived at, and the matter >
is still in abeyance.

line, even if no heed is paid to the cur
rent gossip which imputes to some of
the ladies a desire to unduly interfere
in national politics by making Ul2 men
discontented with their lot. However,
be this as It may, General Kin^ has net
addtd to his popularity among a cer
tain officious class by addressing to the
ladies of the Ked Cross Society a very
complimentary letter, for they claim to
read between the lines expressions of
fcelinf of rebuke which the author per
tineiuly disclaims.
It was practically decided this morn
ing by the civil branch of the Hawai
ian (tc v. rnmeiit to give thÂ«? site re
quired by the naval arm for a front
age for their coai depot. This will a
tend irons the new China slip alongside
the Pacific Mail wharf to the line of
the Isishop estate, or about the King's
boathouse. This is almost Immediate
ly Â»n front cf the new United States
coalsbeds, in which there are now so.ne
tons stored, and will bt aaapta
ol'i for the largest vessels to C m
alongside and load at a saving tt at
(2 a ton and much valuable time.
Captain Tanner, U. S. N., and Consul
General Hay wood have engineered tlu.
matter with the Minister of the Inte
rior.
The United States transport Pennsyl
vania arrived in port laat night from
Manila, via Guam, to coal. She ex
pects to take on board about 400 tons
and to leave within two days. She re
ports mumps, measles and dysentery to
be prevalent at Manila, the last men
tioned being caused mainly through In
discretions of diet. The troop snips
Peru, Puebla, Newport and St. Paul
were expected to follow her in about a
week. Her visit U) Guam was caused
by her returning 'the Spanish doctor
removed thence by the Charleston
through inadvertence. They were
loudly cheered and deliriously thanked
for returning the physician. Her pas
sengers include Dr. Smith of **Â»â¢ Balti
more, whn is returning to undergo his
examination; four regulars, whose
terms of service have expired; two
First California men, invalided; a ser
geant major of the Montanas on fur
lough; three United States sailors, in
sane, and the quartermaster or the Bal
timore.
The Supreme Court having decided
that the Council of State may decide
tho parlous question of what an "emer
gency" under our constituitfm" and one
within their power to appropriate, Mr.
Damon, the Minister of Finance, has
decided that there Is no necessity to
go before them for the amount with
which to purchase the site for the new
Reformatory School, as he will fund
the money until the next Legislature
ts and appropriates it. The know.
alls have an impression that Mr. Da
mon has high political aspirations and
know how to pull the wires. He pulled
a strong one on Saturday with his fete
champetre at his country residence at
Moanalua, given fn honor of the army
and navy. It was one of the most
successful garden parties or entertain
ments ever givpn here. He rallied
around him all the old regime for the
first time since the death of the mon
archy, as well as the representatives of
the new order. Unfortunately, Ad
miral Miller had sailed and Mr. and
Mrs. Sewall were out of town. Since
his visit to England Mr. Damon is much
impressed with the English baronial sys
tem, and consequently, assisted by thÂ«
President and Mr. Dole, he received in
a lordly and generous fashion with
special trains, bands dancing pavilions
and all that the heart could desire at
his country seat, which, in course of
time. Mill be a marvelously beautiful
spot, full of rare collections In botani
cal, zoological and historical treas
ures.
Considfrnble unpleasantness has been
caused by Minister Cooper and his Su
perintendent of Schools publishing a
"by nuthority" notice calling upon thÂ»
school teachers and pupils to observe
October 19 as Lafayette day, and for
all the pupils to contribute as much a&
they can, or at least 1 cent, to the La
fayette memorial fund. This is re
garded by the poor Ha walla ns and the
children of all foreigners as being
rather Americanization by legislation.
Mnny children will ahsent themselves
from school on that day, although the
obnoXious circular has been withdrawn
from circulation.
As another Instance of the summary
methods of the men we do not wish
to have as rulers over us when we set
tle down to business Is the following:
For certain reasons, >- hich the street
alleges, but T do not c^re to repeat, the
regular quarantine physician was
called away from the quarantine sta
tion, and the port physician placed In
temporary charge, with the result that
the large number of Asiatics in quar
antine were discharged two days ahead
of their time, in order that they might
catch their special island steamers.
APOSTOLIC DELEGATE TO CUBA.
The Pope Has Appointed Archbishop
Chappelle of New Orleans.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â Cardinal Gib
bons, who is here attending the meeting
of the Arrhbishops at the Catholic Uni
rerslty, received a cablegram from Rome
to-day announcing that t.ie Pope had
appointed Archbishop Chappelle of New
Orleans as apostolic delegate to Cuba. He
wili retain his position at New 7 Orleaas,
his new field being a special mission.
Archbishop Chappelle is now at Rome.

ENCOURAGING
CONDITION OF
REAL ESTATE
Immediate Advance
Predicted.
MANY SALES NEGOTIATED
ASSOCIATION FORMED TO LESS
EN TAXATION.
Glances at the Records, New Build
ing Contracts and
General Realty
Notes.
The real estate market is still slowly
progressing, with every prospect of a
marked improvement before the end of
the present month. Although not as yet of
such a natuha as to bring universal
encouragement, still the advance made
is sufficient to make the brokers feel san
guine that the entire character of tne
"world of realty" will be changed from
long existent depression and a marked
tendency to deterioration, to a healthy
condition of progress before the lapse
of the remaining months of the present
year.
There is on foot a movement which, if
successful, will materially assist in bet
tering the condition of the realty market.
A new organization has been formed or
various real estate firms, the members of
which have subscribed to the following
resolution:
To the Voters and Owners of Real Property
of the city and county at ban Francisco:
Political parties in San Francisco nave be
come vile barterers. â 'â¢=>â '* : "
L,aws are not honestly enforced, the money of
the taxpayer Is squandered through the so
called political bosses that dominate the par
ties.
We believe the time for action has come;
that good citizens Irrespective of party fealty
should unite in a strong and determined ef
fort to suppress these practices by becoming
members of the Real Estate Agents" and Prop
erty Owners' Association.
This is a Keif-protecting proposition that re
quires our earnest attention; it "la a movement
at the present time that will mold the destiny
of this city. We want to place ourselves In
the hands of honest, reliable men and improve
the advantage that we now have within our
grasp. We should prepare ourselves tor the
reception of the new business opportunities
new thrown open to us by the now probable
acquisition of the Sandwich and Philippine
Islands also by the construction of the Nicara
gua canal. Wharves should be constructed for
the accommodation of commerce. Workshops
and factories should be constructed and oper
ated for supplying the wants of trade in thost*
countries.
Our desire is to create such conditions In
this city that all Idle houses shall be filled by
happy and prosperous families and .Induce idle
capital to invest here and in the vicinity. To
the above end you are invited to Join In con
vention to select such persons for office as will
bring the above much-desired results.
We, the undersigned property owners of this
city, pledge ourselves to become members of
the Real Estate Agents' and Property Owners'
Association, and we agree to meet In a con
vention to indorse worthy municipal candidates
from the nominations of the respective parties,
and promise to use our b<Â»st efforts In securing
the electlcn of such men as shall be Indorsed
by the Real Estate Agents' and Property Own
ers' Convention, which Is to be hÂ«ld on Octo
ber 10. 11 and 12. at a hall selected by the
president.
The obligation of this agreement is volun
tary; no fees are to be received for such serv
ices. With the object of good government we,
the undersigned, have subscribed our nam*a
to become members of this association.

city have signed the resolution.

I have a friend, in fact he is my brother-in-law, who is the outside
man for a New York crockery warehouse, a sort of salesman, purchas-
ing agent, collector and what not. He used to suffer from a catarrh
of the stomach. When he woke in the morning there would be a
gripping, a contraction, a tightness of the stomach, which, he said,
seemed to be clogged with a slimy, phlegm-like substance. Carlsbad
salts always did him some good, but now he uses a Ripans Tajbule. He
only takes one when occasion requires, just one now and then. When
this man, his name is Spalding, was asked to describe the effect of the
Tabule on him, he said : "Why, it brightens me up. It has an effect
like dry air; makes me feel something as I used to of a spring morning
when the air was crisp but tempered with sunshine. I don't know
how they produce such aa effect, but that iÂ§ the way the^ SPJJfJuXkW^"

THE NEW YORK MARKETS.
The circular of Henry Clews, under date of
New York. October S. says:
"The general commercial movement affords
no stimulus to the speculative spirit, but
rather causes some disappointment. Although
reports from the Western sections Indicate a
generally healthy condition of business and
foreshadow a pood aggregate for the fall trade,
yet there is a slowness and hesitancy tit move
ment that may be accounted for by the full
ness of the stocks of merchandise, which natu
rally produces a process of day to day buy
i")f â . turns out that the collapse In the ml.l
tary spirit consequent upon the close of the war
Ss accompanied by a corresponding abatement
of the speculative spirit, which, however
illogical it may seem, is by no means un
natural, for a relapse from any great excite
ment is apt to be attended by a general ieel
lng of quiescence. At the moment, the gen
eral situation seems to predispose the specu
lative Interest to taking a rest. The position
does not afford any strong inducements to
either bulling or bearing operations. ,
"The recent importations of gold have placed
the money market beyond any probability of
a relapse toward stringency. Owing to the low
rate of sterling exchange at Paris, It has been
found possible to ship hither about J2.5u0.0u0 of
gold from that city on London account, but ,
there is apparently little probability of any
further important importations of the metal
until there is an active revival of our exports
of grain, and, between the unsettled state of
the foreign wheat trade and the unwillingness
of our farmers to market their stocks, that
contingency can hardly be said to be within
eight. In any case, however, the condition of
the local banks has reached a point of plethora
In lending power which assures the money
market against any disturbance for the rest of
the year, if it does not foreshadow a period of
marked ease."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â The undertone of
strength which has been manifest for several
flays assumed the upper hand in the stock mar
ket to-day, ignoring the continued weakness
In acme of the specialties and driving the bears
to cover, thus putting an end to the decline in j
Borne of these stocks. Buying to cover short I
contracts played no email part in the rise all
through the list. It -was not the result of an
awakened public Interest in the market but
â¢was rather by capitalists or groups of finan
ciers interested in this or that property ac
cording inside support. It was selling by In-
Side Influences that sent Northern Pacific down
last week and sympathetically affected the
railway list generally.
-day's sharp recovery In Northern Pacific,
which extended to 1%, was therefore a great
relief. There was conspicuous buying also in
Union Pacific preferred, the Grangers and
some of the Southern and Southwestern roads,
the net gains for many stocks reaching a
jiolnt. Kansas and Texas preferred was a con
epl<:ucus exception, with a net loss of nearly
a point. The speculation in Tobacco and Sugar
ctntinued active and feverish and the move
ments of these dominant specialties were con
flicting. While Tobacco bi-oKe 4% in the early
trading. Sugar made a sharp recovery of its
recent decline, and while Tobacco rallied nearly
to last night's close in the late dealings, the
early gain in Sugar was more than wiped out.
There was quite a striking movement in such
gilt-edged issues as Chicago and Alton and
Great Northern and St. Paul preferred. There
â was no conspicuous development in the gen
eral situation to account for the changed tem
per In Wall street, unless it might be the con
tinued heavy demand for cereals for export
end the advancing prices for them in foreign
markets. Money conditions In London were
alÂ«o slightly easier, which brougnt some buy
ing for London account and there was appre
ciable evidence of the Increased supply of r jr
j.lus capital here. The closing of the market
showed quite a firm tone in spite of weakness
in one or two of the Inductrials.
Railroad bonds improved in sympathy with
stocks and closed generally higher. Sales 12 -

The stock markets here opened steady to-day \

the tone generally continued dull and lifeless.
Americans were especially good on New York

Kaffirs were easy on German realizations.
I Insurance risks In securities are reported at

per cent to the end of the year. These are i
really nothing but a few betting transactions ;
and Lloyds were so mistaken in their view as j

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. ll.â Opening transactions In
Wheat were on a larger scale than the pit
has Been In a month. The strength at Liver
pool and the enormous cash grain business
done here yesterday was the all-Important con
sideration. The Liverpool advance was nearly
as great aa the rally here, and the seaboard
started In reporting further large export en
j gagements. Before the opening crush had sub
; sided the trade wan apprised of fifty boatloads
! taken at New York. To add to the strength
j which the market displayed, there were Eng
lish cables reporting It probable that Russia
would prohibit exports of cereals. Though
these were promptly denied, the trade _ had
plenty of other bullish news to stimulate it on !
the buying side. Minneapolis put her sales of
flour yesterday at 133.000 barrels. Broomhall
cabled that the Australian crop had been dam
aged by drought, and there was wet weather
In the Northwest which promised to cut oft to
some extent the arrivals in that quarter. With
all this, the temper of trade was skeptical.
Some of the important interests here seemed
to range on the selling side, and there was
fairly free selling from St. Louis. Local ex
porters were bearish and claimed that the ad
vances here had carried them out <jX line so far
as exports from Chicago were concerned. The
actual clearings for the day were 40,000 bushels.
Primary market receipts were 8,672.000 bushels,
against 1.357,000 bushels a year ago. Though
I sales of December were made early around 65@
65% c, an advance over last night's close of %>&
?4c. there was a backset to 64%Â®64%c before
noon. Directly after that time reports of ninety
; loads of Wheat and eighty-seven of Corn taken
1 for export at New York started the price up
I to 65%e again. The weekly as well as the dally
i calls were In this vicinity and considerable
: opposition was experienced. During the clos
ing, however, the reports of export business In
New York were swelled to 100 loads of Corn.
j The resulting excitement was Intense enough
. ' to carry December Wheat up to 65>Â£c, where j
i 1 It was met by offerings of numerous people who
1 ' had good profits and were willing to take them.
Though the New York stories were supple
mented with reports of 150,000 bushels cash
Wheat and over 1,000,000 bushels of cash Corn
disposed of here, It did not lighten the load of
those on whom the property had been dumped.
And in their efforts to shift the -weight the
, market was slumped down to 64% c for Decem
ber and thÂ« close was at 6i\L@M?ic, U@*Jc
lower. Another depressing feature near the
close was a. decline of 114 c per bushel at Buda- :
pest to-day and - <*> the paÃt three days.
An enormous export business and higher !
cables caused a strong feeling in Corn, . which
left off unchanged.
A scattered demand from scalper* and shorts
Improved Oats early. The market yielded,
however, with the slump In Wheat and lost He.
More reassuring yellow fever news from the :

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Oct. 12.â American "Wool and
Cotton Review will say to-morrow:
The past week has been a very dull one.
Some negotiations have been pending which
may result in more business in the course of
a week or two, but the actual volume of sales j
has been even smaller than that of the pre- '
ceding week. One wool house reports that it :
could have done over $100,000 worth of business ,
If it had chosen to come down in Its asking
price, but it declined to do so.
Other Instances are cited Indicating the firm
ness with which wool is generally held by the
trade, although there are some spots where
holder* got more than they can take care of.
What demand there has been has mostly
ran to three-eighths and one-half washed
fleeces at 224j23c and Territory woola, the for- |
mer being used in army goods. Domestic fine I
wools have been very quiet, scarcely anything
having been done In this line of stock.
The sales of the week In Boston amount to
657 000 pounds domestic and 533,000 pounds for- !
eign, making a total of 1,190,000. against a total ]
of 1,543,000 for the previous week and a total
of 5,651.000 for the corresponding week last year.
Sales since January 1, 1898. amount to 88,112.
010 pounds, against 219,818,100 pounds last year
at the same time. -

PROSECUTION IN DESPAIR
CANNOT CONVINCE TRIAL JU
RORS OF GUILT.
The Court Grants a Motion to Dis
miss and the Witnesses
Are Released From
Jail.
" Oakland Office San Franciepo Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 12.
Constable Robert Dowling has nothing !
more to fear from the indictments al
leging perjury brought against him by the
Grand Miry. This morning, on motion of
the District Attorney, all the charges
were dismissed because of the failure of
juries to convict. When the cases were
called Mr. Snook informed Judge Ogden
that the former trials had been care
fully and earnestly conducted by the
prosecution, and that In each case the
jury had failed to convict. There is no
new evidence to place before the jurors,
and the inference being that they would i
fail to convict the third time, the Dis
trict Attorney could see no use in wast- ;
ing the time or the money of the State, j
Judge Ogdeu granted the motion to dls- I
miss.
Dowling was Indicted some months ago
on three charges of perjury. All of them |
were connected with swearing to bills I
against the county contracted in his ca- I
parity as Constable. When the first case '
was tried the defendant was represented [
by Attorney Emll Nusbaumer, and lie i
was acquitted. At the second trial two
weeks ago the jury disagreed, and it was
the retrial of the second case that was
before the court this morning.
The dismissal of the charges was wel
come news io the two tramps named
Kamsey and Carr. who gave the evidence ,
to the Grand Jury to furnish the basis
for the indictment. These two men have ,
b*>en held in custody since Dowling was '
Indicted, and to-uay they were released. '
PRIVATE MEADORS ON
TRIAL FOR HIS LIFE
JURY OF TWELVE HAS BEEN AC
CEPTED AND SWOKN.
Attorney Deuprey Outlines the Testi
mony by Which He Hopes to
Establish the Plea of
Self-Defense.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 12.
Self-defense is the plea on which At
torney Eugene Deuprey will try to save
the neck of James Xathaniel Aleadors,
who killed Private Jonas Ury at Camp
Barrett on August 16.
The trial, â¢which was resumed before
Judge Ellsworth this morning, is attract
ing much interest. The selection of a
Jury occupied the greater part of the
Rather an unusual feature of the trial
to-day v.as that after Deputy District At
torney Melvin had made his opening
statement to the. jury Attorney Deuprey
ariose and also made an opening state
ment, outlining briefly what the defense
expected to prove. It was here that the
Question of what the defense will be Was
iinally settled. He ?;ud in part: "V\ c
expect to t=how that the record of L'ry
in this county was that of a professional
pugilist and member of the prize ring;
that he was a man of remarkable stat
ure and a bully by nature; that he was
a companion i;i the lent at Camp Bar
rett with Meadors, and that ho had fre
quently assaalftd the accused with the
vilest epithets that could be uttered by
the tongue of man."
Attorney iJeuprey next recited the cir
cumstances immediately ;ndir?g the
killing-, by which he expected to show
that Mt-adors used his pocket-knife on
"\Ve expect to- chow," continued
Deuprey, "'that when Meadore re
turned from the kitchen In camp about
8 a. m., after he had obtained his coffee.
there was a quarrel going on in the tent
over the Question of who had been guilty
of making a certain muss in the tent.
Whet the matter was left to Meadors
he frankly .stated that Dry had done It;
that thereupon Cry called him a bald
headed â¢ and {.'rabbin^ hold of his
rifle threatened to knock out â â¢..â¢â 
of Meadors. When the officers came upon
the scene Meadors said, " "fcjergent, 1 hau
to do it.' "
The taking of testimony will begin to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock.

HEW WATER
SCHEDULE IS
BEING TESTED
First Bill Under the
Woodward Rates.
PAYMENT IS DISPUTED
WORK OF LAST MARCH MAY
GO INTO COU3T.
One Water Company Attempts to Col
lect for What Was Formerly
Done Free for the
City.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 12.
About three weeks ago a story was
published In The Call to the effect that
the water companies of this city Intended
to put into use in the near future the
schedule for water rates fixed by the
'"solid six" of the City Council last March,
and which brought forth such a storm of
public indignation. The story was denied
at the time by the officers of one of the
companies. â *
Tills morning, when the Police and ire
Commissioners met, a bill was presented
for payment from the Contra Costa Water
| Company for changing and repairing fire
J hydrants as arranged for in the new
j schedule. This Is the first attempt made
to collect under this ordinance, although
it became legal July 1.
In the Woodward ordinance, which
raised such dissatisfaction, it is provided!
that the water companies should be paid
for repairing and putting in fire hydrants
ordered by the Council. In the ordinance j
of the previous year, which was passed
before the two companies had "agreed," !
the work of repairing and placing lire I
hydrants did not cost the city anything.
"City Attorney Dow read the new ordin
ance stating that the city was to stand
the expense, but Mayor Thomas raised
the question as to whether the ordinance
was in force. It had been passed by the I
Council, but had bourn vetoed by him and |
had i.' â  been passed over his veto. By a ;
shrewd piece of manipulation at the time
rates were being fixed, a resolution was |
passed fixing the water rates, as the
charter provides that they can be fixed by
either resolution or ordinance. The- water
companies will probably hold that it is
legal. The Items comprise two lire hy- ;
drants, costing $44 each, and a number
of repairs to other hydrants. After some
discussion, the bill was turned over to
the Chief of the Fire Department for an
explanation. ,
It is believed that this bill Is in the
nature of a test to- see if a fight will be i
made against the Woodward ordinance.
MERCHANTS WANT A
LOWER INSURANCE RATE
THE EXCHANGE WILL SEEK A
CHANGE IN THE LAW.
Director Sohst Declares That There
Is Discrimination Against
Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway , Oct. 12
The Merchants" Exchange of this city
is now attempting to Impress upon mem
bers of the Legislature the necessity or
some change in the law governing inaur- j
ar.ee companies.
The views of the exchange are clearly j
set forth In the following paper which j
was read at the regular meeting by Direc
tor J. ii. W. Sohst.
Oakland Is considered a gold mine by under
writer*, andithere ta no lovel too low for them; i
but clown, down into the pockets of their un
fortunate victims they g r > and dig up the jroi<S
with which they erect palaces In London, Llv
erpoolj I'a.rls, Hamburg, KrÂ«>mra, <-tc, and pay
la\i.Â«h salaries to their presidents.
The rates on business property are the same
as they were fifteen ears aEO, and in many
instances have been raised and may be called
prohibitory. People caimut insure, but have
to run their cvi) risk.
Do the underwriters K-ot that the people of
Oakland expend nearly SiOO.OOO a year for fire
protection? I don't 'think the - do. The
last time they pÃ'<l our fair city a visit
was when the yir"*t sprinkling was done
by drivers and horses of the fire department.
This state of affairs existed for economical
reasons, but with a team a half a mile away
from the engine house the Insurance companies
jumped up thfc rates. The fire horses have not
been ur.ed for street sprinkling for fifteen years.
The underwriters thould be officially notified
of the fact and be asked to oome down with
the insurance.
But the only way to loosen their iron frrip
which they have on the people will be to in
struct our Senators nnd Assemblymen to pass
a bill at the next session which will liberate
the oppressed public. ; will further suggest
that our secretary be Instructed to communi
cate with boarda of tratfe and merchants' asso
ciations In other cities of our State so that
tney . bo pledge their legislators to pass laws
for the benefit of the peonle.
DENIED THAT HE
WAS THE DEAD MAN
O. F. KBIEG WAS NOT THE UN
KNOWN CORPSE.
A -Remarkable Case of Mistaken j
Identification Is Puzzling
Oakland's Coroner.
OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â The remains of |
the man recovered from the bay with a j
bullet wound through the head were ident- '
ified to-day by N. P. Reuss, the pro- !
prietor of bottling works, as those of
Oscar F. Krieg, an employe who worked ?
for him about two years ago, and resided j
in the Twenty-third avenue district. Dur
ing the afternoon four other men called
at the morgue and corroborated the ident
ification, all asserting positively that*
the dead man was none other that Krieg,
who of late has been a whisky drummer
for a San Francisco house.
To-night, to the surprise of Coroner
Baldwin and the morgue attendants, Os
car F. Krleg appeared personally and
positively declared that he was not the
dead man by any means, thus leaving
the Coroner still in the dark as to the
identity of the * genuine corpse. The
strong resemblance, however, is some
thing remarkable, but Mrs. Krieg and
four little Kriegs are happy in the j
thought that the husband and father is j
not he who lies cold on a Blab at the
morgue. â â¢?-* â -'
The watch of the deceased was exam
ined to-day by Jeweler T. M. Fry, 470
Thirteenth street, and he states It as his
opinion that the timepiece has recently
had a new case put on the old Waltham
works. The case is a gold-filled Cres
cent, and the works are fitted with the
Appleton & Tracy movement. This
might lead to an Identification.

THE SAN FRANCISCO Â« CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1898.
OAKLANDERS
MAY HAVE AN
"OWL" FERRY
Further Facts About
the New Line.
PROPOSED CENTRAL DEPOT
A DIRECT ItOUTE TO THE RACE
TRACK.
Promoters of the Big Enterprise Only-
Desire the Fair Considei-ation
and Reasonable Support
of the Public.
"An owl boat" to and from Oakland is
a subject that has for years occupied the
3 attention of the host of people who travel
t between San Francisco and the "Modern
1 | Athens." This idea of the all-night boat,
- a convenience which has been long prayed
5 for without success, grows out of the ofll
â¢ cial announcement made by representa
f I tives of the Realty Syndicate on Tuesday
1 i evening to a meeting of property owners
3 of Golden Gate, that they intended to es
tablish a rapid transit, exclusive passen
ger service ferry between Emeryville and
1 â  San Francisco.
: If the big company, which has bought
i j up seven-tenths of the street car lines
' I of Oakland and Alameda, and about 4000
! j acres of land within and. outside of the
1 corporate limits of the sister city, could
[ satisfy the public that such a great lux
[ j ury as the night service would be inaugu
[ rated, they would find themselves sup
â¢ I ported by an army of friends, who would
' ' otherwise not be deeply Interested in the
â  j proposition. Such a service would, ac
. : cording to the judgment of those best
j calculated to judge, encourage a good,
â  I lucrative travel and popularize the new
j line to a great extent. It would receive,
; I not only the solid support of the over-the
! i bay people who patronize San Francisco
| playhouses and have to start for home In
â  : the middle of the last act, but the theater
; I managers would rise up and call the man
! agement blessed. Incidentally they might
j take a few blocks of stock just to show
â  their genuine sympathy with the enter
' prise.
! In any other city where such a large
i : population demands proper accommoda
tions, night boats are supplied as a mat
ter, of business and necessity. But the
Southern Pacific monopoly, which has
owned the bay since the Central Pacilic
was constructed, has considered its own
convenience and refused to run the owl
boats lest there might be an occasional
trip when the receipts would be a few
j nickelis shy.
A feature of the night ferry service
, which particularly interests San Fran
| ciscans is the fact that if such boats were
, run it would necessitate the operation of
j owl cars on this side of the bay in order
ito accommodate the traffic. Any Institu
tion that would guarantee such an in
' novation in this city could pass around
1 the hat and secure fat contributions to
its building fund. In other words the
: promoters of the new lerry wou'd be
given additional and substantial encour
agement if it were an assured fact that
the owl boats would be operated.
In speaking of the idea of an all-night
service yesterday, F. W. Beardslee, gen
eral agent of the Syndicate Company in
j Alameda County, stated that it was one
! that would be earnestly urged upon the
company when the time came. If the
proper support were given this could be
made a popular feature of the service.
| One of the suggestions in this connection
lie that with such boats there would be
hundreds of San Francisco night work
ers who would have their homes on the
, other side of the bay if they could de
pend on early morning ferry service.
With reference to the proposed "dis
| tributing depot," Mr. Beardslee stated
j that the Idea was to locate it on the
j northeast corner of Holden and Buena
Vista streets and to have it occupy oner
half a block. One of the contemplated
features would be an inner court, orna
j mented with flowers, a fountain, etc., and
jto be used as a lounging room. The
building would also be arranged with
I waiting rooms, a restaurant, etc., and a
: part set aside for stores. It is also pro
posed to run a special track to the Cali
i fornia Jockey Club's grounds. Passen
gers from the city would not have to
transfer, as the large cars to be used on
the mole would be run through to the
: track.
; An accommodation asked for by the
] people of Golden Gate Is the construction
of a short line through their section on
Tenth street, which would make a good
feeder. Another line which will be con
structed will be from the depot to West
Oakland to connect with the Eighth
Twelfth, Fourteenth and Sixteenth streets
lines of the Syndicate, as well as the one
!to Alameda. The Berkeley line a to con
nect with the Oakland Consolidated, and
the Piedmont stem is to be bo arranged
as to give almost a straight line to that
! picturesque resort.'
"This series of meetings we have
begun," said Mr. Beardslee, "is for
the purpose of letting the people of
Oakland know what wo are doing and
how we are doing it. We have one
: of the best business propositions to be
i found any Are, and all we need is to
have the public investigate it to be sat
is 0^ of its merits. We have about
$7,000,000 worth of property for which we
paid only $3,000,000. We are in Al shape
and making money. If the people of
i Oakland would look into these matters
: they could satisfy themselves that our
enterprise means a great deal to them
lln the development of the city. And if
they want this competitive, up-to-date
ferry service in a hurry they can have
it by showing that they take a substan
j tial interest in it. It rests with them
I whether the construction is tp begin "at
i an early date or three or four years
hence. However, I will reiterate my
I statement that this new ferry will b->
built."
The report of the meeting of property
I owners held at Golden Gate pub
lin yesterday's Call created much
discussion in Oakland yesterday A
strange feature of the situation over
there with reference to the proposed new
i ferry Is the fact that there are so many
people who put themselves out of the
way to decry the enterprise and destroy
the confidence of people who would oth
erwise give it substantial support.
It is well known in Oakland that this
"back-heeling" comes almost, entirely from
the Southern Pacific Company, which
; compels its agents and employes to use
: every effort to discredit any enterprise
that might affect the revenues of the
great monopoly and at the same time
â  give the public independence. The ad
vancement Â«of Oakland Is not consid
ered.
The officers of the syndicate say that
they are not looking for fights or antag
onisms, but simply working- out a big
business enterprise, In which they are
j distributing $1000 a day In Oakland. They
i ask only Just consideration and fair treat
| ment by those who are benefited by their
effort?. â

Which Unites Miss Eva
Moody and Clarence
Breeden.
i
In a bower of white chrysanthemums
and true-lovers' knots Miss Eva Moody j
and Clarence Breeden yesterday after- |
noon plighted their troth in the presence j
of about seventy invited guests.
The handsome home of the bride's par- j
ents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph L. Moody, at i
the corner of Lombard and Jones streets, I
was the scene of the wedding ceremony.
The entire lower floor of the residence
was given over to those who assisted at |
the ceremony, and was profusely deco- i
rated with choice blossoms.
In the main drawing room, where the j
ceremony was performed, white was the |
prevailing tone of the decorations. The !
sitting room was in yellow and white. !
Red berries and ferns Â«vere gracefully ax- j
ranged in the hallway, and the dining \
room was in pinkâ American. Beauties !
and cosmos prevailing.
The large porch was inclosed In canvas, j
and here were arranged the tete-a-tete !
tables where the seventy guests sat down
to a bridal luncheon.
Exactly at noon the bridal party en
tered the drawing room. It was led by ]
the bridesmaids, Miss Eva Madden, Miss I
Bernie Brown and Miss Bertha Dolbeer. j
They were gownf-d alike in frocks of j
whit? moupseline de soie over slips of
green taffeta. Large bouquets of Amer- |
ican Beauties completed the costumes. |
Next came the maid of honor, Miss Mai ,
Moody, a sister of the bride. She wore |
a dainty dress of white dotted chiffon
over white taffeta silk. The bouquet she I
carried was composed of bridesmaid I
roses.
Following came the bride, leaning upon J
the arm of her father. She looked ex- i
tremely pretty in her wedding dress of
white uuchesse satin. The skirt was en
trainÂ© and elaborately trimmed In point

knots. The high-necked, long-sleeved
bodice was shrouded in white tulle and i
was finished with satin stock and belt, j

quet was of lilies of the valley.
A* the bridal party reached the bower

clergyman. Rev. Mr. Shaw of St. Luke's I

gratulations were in order, and later the |
guests eat down to a bridal breakfast, I
during which the bride and groom were '
toasted again and again.
Mr and Mrs. Breenden left last even
ing for Southern California, where the
honeymoon will be spent. On their re
turn they will reside at the Richelieu,
on Van Ness avenue.
The Pullmans Given Time.
The Railroad Commissioners met yester
day afternoon, the only absentee being
Commissioner Clark. I. H. Polk, expert
of the board, was also present. The spe
ciaJ object of the meeting was to investi- I
gate the affairs of the Pullman Palace
Car Company, which has been subpenaexl
to produce its books and make a showing
of its affairs before the board.
Several letter* were read showing the
great interest the investigation has arous
ed in different parts of the country. One j
of these, from J. I>. Miller of Wisconsin,
is as follows: "I notice your efforts to
reduce the rates in Pullman cars. Any
person can buy a berth in a Pullman from
Laredo to Monterey, Mexico, from 4
p. m. to 8 a. m., 10 hours, for 90 cents.
Also, Xl Paso to Mexico City, 48 hours, or
J224 miles, for $4; and the Pullman are
putting on cars in Mexico, whenever tho '
opportunity present* Itself. If the Pull
man can do this to Mexico, they can do it
to California.
"Four years afiro the railroad company
charged per tourist cars, per berth, with
the earne equipment as now $3, Omaha to
California. As soon as Pullman took
charge the rates were raised to $5."
A letter was also received from Talcott
Williams of the Philadelphia Press, ask
ing for particulars of the investigation.
T. C. Coogan, local attorney for the
Pullman Company, said that while hÂ© did :
not know what action the company would
take in the matter, he believed that it
would not contest the authority of the
board. Though the sentiment of the board
was against much further delay, Mr. Coo
gan was finally allowed two weeks in
which to find out the attitude of the Pull
man directors in Chicago, after which the
meeting adjourned.
An Eye to Improvement.
L. M. King, superintendent of the street
department of the Merchants' Association,
returned yesterday from a six weeks'
trip to the East, where he had been sent
by the association to gather information
us to the methods adopted in the larger
cities on the Atlantic side in the matters
ot sewerage, garbage, pavements, etc.
Mr. King: has visited every city of note
and he states that in very many respects
San Francisco is far behind the times.
However in none of the municipalities did
he find everything- perfect. One city would
excel in its sewer system, anothor in its
pavements and another in the matter of
aisposiÃg of its prartiago. He will have :
many valuable suggestions to make for
the benefit of this city in matters when
the association makes recommendations
to the Supervisors for public improve
ments.

ONE THOUSAND
DOLLARS ASKED
FOR A SLATE
Proposition to Santa
Clara's Boss.
WAS TRAPPED BY DELMAS
FORCED TO ADMIT EDITING AN
INTERVIEW.
All San Jcse Streets Paved With
Rock From a Quarry Partly
Owned by "Jim"
Rea.
SAN JOSE. Oct 12.â "Johnnie" Mac
kenzie's standing as a political boss
was given by Jim Rea to-day on the
stand in the Blander suit against him.
It was like drawing teeth to get any
Information from him in regard to his
trusted lieutenant, but Attorney Del
mas linally succeeded in obtaining the
boss' estimate of Mackenzie as a
'â¢leader." Rea s:iid Mackenzie con
trolled the Scotch vote of the Fourth
Ward. Ho paid Santa Clara County's
Game Warden many pretty compli
ments, but they were received with
gneers by the vast audience present.
This was Kt-a's third day on the
stand. His face wore the same eld
smile and he was inclined to be an jocu
lar as ever.
The defense will finish its case to
morrow forenoon and it is expected
that the arguments before the Jury will
commence either in the afternoon or
next day.
C. Sterlina, a fruit dealer at 35 Bas
sett street, heard part of the altercation
between lit-a and Jarman in front oi
Mrs. Knox-Goodrich'a on March 14.
He said Rea told Jarman that ha
thought he (.Jarman) got some of the
$450 paid to 9< cure the sale of the roller.
R. N. Castillo followed. He also saw
the trouble. il:s storj was similar to
that c/f the preceding witness.
When ciiurt opened this morning At
torney Delmas questioned Rea in re
gard to an interview published in the
Mercury regarding the charge he made
against Jarman. He .said in that inter
view that Maggard told him he had
used the $700 where it would do the
most good. Kea also said in the inter
view credited to him that he told Jar
man in regard to the $1000 demanded
by Krieg or witness for making a slate
of liremen and policemen. His words
to Jarman were: "You may or may not
have any part of it. If you
did not you are a fool, and if you did
you are a knave." Rea eaid on the
stand that he did not make this state
ment when interviewed, but that the
reporter had put words in himself. He
admitted, however, that the Mercury
had submitted proofs of the article to
him and he had corrected such parts of
he chose. He had lixed up the
article in the Mercury office, and he
had not setn tit to correct this alleged
mistake.
"What are your relations with John I
D.. Mackenzie?" asked Delmas. j
Ken's counsel objected and the court
sustained him.
Delmas refrained his question. "You '
have stated, Mr. Rea, that John D. |
Mackenzie was present at your house j
on the .Sunday evening the political j
leaders met there to name the police
and firemen of San Jose for the year.
Mow of what was Mackenzie a leader?"
â¢'He's a Republican." .But before
witness could get further his counsel i
Objected. Objection was overruled and
Rea pr< receded;
"1 uon't know as I can tell you. He's
got friends and he's a leader in his par
ticular way."
'â¢â¢Well, in what way?"
"Leader of the Scotch vote in the |
Fourth Ward."
"Is that all?"
"iso; he has other friends and votes." |
"Is that all?"
"Xo, sir."
'"1 ell us, then."
"The people who have confidence In
him, i suppi's--."
â¢Mr. Kca, have yc-u now answered
fully and completely according to your
knowledge the sense in which you used
the word leader in reference to John D.
Mackenzie?"
"Would you lik.' my estimate of Mac
kenzie?" a*sk'-d Rea, avoiding the guts
"l would," replied Delmas. "That is
just what i want from you."
"He's very Intelligent," answered the
boss, taking the opportunity to pay his
trusted lieutenant a compliment.
â¢'How much of the Republican party
does Mackenzie represent."
â¢â .About one six-thousandth part of
the Republican party of Santa Clara
County. "
This last answer was ordered stricken
out.
"How much of the Republican party
does Mackenzie as a leader represent?"
"I don't know."
"All or a six-thousandth part?"
â¢Fully that."
The cross-examination then turnefi to
the meeting at Mr. Rea's bouse, where
Rev. claims Councilman Krieg asked
him for $1000 for the privilege of mak
ing a slate to suit hiinseif. Rea said
this dialogue occurred between himself
and Krieg:
Krieg railed the bosa to one side and
asked, "Are you not on?"
"1 don't know as I am," Rea said he
replied.
â¢â¢You put up $1000 and you can name
the entire slate," Is the cold-blooded
proposition Krieg is alleged to have
made.
Rea asked: "Are Jarman and Main in
on this deal?"
"That makes no difference," answered
Krieg. With this the two returned to
the room where the others were.
Rea announced to the assemblage
that he was oppOÃed to the slate as it
did not represent either party or fac
tion. With this the meeting broke up.
Rea eaid trutt after Jarman returned
from San Francisco he went to him and
asked if he was to understand from
Krieg's demand for .'IOOO 'that he (Jar
man) was to receive $250 for his vote In
allowing witness to make up the Blate.
Witness said that Jarman told him he
had nothing to do with it.
The making up of a elate at Rea's
house was next discussed. He said Jar
man wanted James Reed for policeman
and would not take William Buckley
for the place, but would take anybody
else they wanted. Rea said Jarman re
fused to accept the men advocated by
the Battlefield Veterans. Jarman also
opposed the election of Charles Pfaw,
Joe Molting, John Horn and Perry Dun
ning as policemen on the ground that
they drank to excess and Ed Mangin
as fireman as he had insulted a woman.
The slate as read by Councilman Man
jrrum at the next Council meeting con
tamed these names, with the exception
of Dunning, and the slate was adopted.
Kea was asked why he thought Jar
man was to receive $250 of the $1000 de
manded by Krieg for the making of the
slate and replied:
"I did not think Jarman was impli
cated In the matter with Krieg at the
time the offer was made. I did not
think so when he went to San Fran
cisco with Krieg and Dlttus, nor after
his return, but after the next Council
meeting there was a Question in my
mind."
"Why then?"
"Because he was very bitter and
made, a speech in the Council meeting
denouncing the gang."
Kea admitted he named the delegates
to the city and county Kepublican con
ventions. He had consulted the corn
mitteea of the various elements in re
gard to the matter. Among the com
mittees were a "whole lot of preachers."
After a list of delegates was made up
Rea said he consulted the county cen
tral committee in regard to making a
flght along the lines suggested. The
meetings were so numerous he could
not remember just where they were
held, but the back room of the boss 1
real estate cilice was the scene of many
conferences.
Rea said he had Invited Johnnie Mac
kenzie to be present at the caucus held
at his house to make up a slate of fire
men and policemen. Witness stated he
had been informed by Fay or Molting
that Jarman had spent $180 of the city's
money in investigating the steam roller.
He said Fay and Nolting were both his
friends.
Kea was asked why ho had not ex
posed the matter of money being used
in the Council for the purchase of the
steam roller when he was so deeply in
terested in the purity of municipal af
fairs.
Kea said he did not say anything to
' Councilmen other than Fay. The
latter also made no attempt to expose
the matter. Witness said he had sense
enough to keep out of it. He said that
if he and Fay had attempted to utop
the sale of the roller they would have
been denounced as attempting to
blacken the character of gentlemen and
there would not be a witness to sup
them. Kea satd he never warned
Nolting of the crookedness about the
sale of the roller. He had warned Fay,
though, because he was close to him.
He had supported Fay actively. Nolt
ing was friendly to witness and he had
supported him the last time he ran for
Councilman.
Delmas then announced that he was
through with the witness.
Answering questions of his attorneys
Rea said the Gay quarry, in which he
was interested, never sold rock direct
to thÂ« city, but to all the contractors at
$1 25 per cubic yard. The contractors
all figured at The same price.
W. J. Leet of the firm of James W.
Rea a- Co. was the next witness for the
He said ho had charge of the
insurance branch of their business.
I Witness heard the conversation be
tween Kea and S. G. Tompkins on
March 11 last. He said Tompkins came
I along and he and Rea engaged in a
discussion of the various tickets. Tomp
kins asked: "What is the matter with
: the new charter ticket?" Rea ahs^
"1 don't like some of the loaders""
Tompkins asked, "What's the matter
with Jarman?" Rea said, "I don't like
the people he tmins with." The steam
roller matter was then brought up.
Tompkins asked Rea if he thought Jar
man had gut any of the money paid to
influence the purchase of the steam
roller. Rea answered, "1 could have
bought the roller for $900 less than the
city and that money went some place.
If Jarman is such an economist an ho
claims why did he not save this money
for the city." Leet did not hear Rea
say to Tompkins, "Jack Jarman, he
robbed the city while he was In the
. Council." \ritness said that Jarman
' until recently hud boen given all the
painting and work in which Rea & Co
were interested.
' >n cross-examination he denied that
hf had at the boarding-house of Mrs.
Erkson on Third street, in the presence
of Mrs. Clough, denounced Jarnian as
a boodler. He admltte-d, however, tru:
h<=> had said that Jarman's suit was a
political scheme, as it was brougnt
about election time.
D. C. Smith, an employe of the Peo
ple's Ice Company, gave similar testi
mony to Leefs. He said J. \V. Rea
and J. R. Chace owned the People's Ice
< Company.
J. IT. Shaw, n not her employe of Rea'c
corroborated Smith and I>> -t.

DELIVERS AN ADDRESS EX
PRESSING HIS GRATITUDE.
Unstinted Patriotism Displayed Dur

bration of the Peace
Jubilee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Oct. 12.â The third day of
Omaha's Peace Jubilee, which was
"President's day" at the Trans-Mlssls
sippl Exposition, opened with lowering
sky. About 10 o'clock, however, the
sun burst forth In all its radiance,
making the hearts of thousands of peo
ple glad. It was after 10 o'clcok when
the Presidential party, escorted by
President Wattles and members of the
entertainment committee in carriages,
started for the exposition grounds.
They were headed by a platoon of
mounted police, while the President and
party were escorted by the Board of
Governors of the Ak-Sar-Ben, mounted
and dressed in their regalia. The party
proceeded directly to the grand plaza
on the bluff tract of the exposition,
where on the music pavilion the formal
exercises of the day occurred.
President McKinley probably never
received a more enthusiastic greeting
than that which awaited him at the ex
position grounds. By far the greatest
crowd in the big Western show's his
tory, so large a crowd that its num
bers are almost impossible to be es
timated, thronged about the huge plat
form from which be made his address.
Hardly one sentence was spoken by
him which did not evoke from the peo
ple cheers upon cheers. After Presi
dent Wattles had introduced the dis
tinguished guests of the exposition it
was fully five minutes before the sub
sidence of the applause permitted the
President to begin speaking. Follow
ing are extracts from his address:
Gentlemen of the Trans-Mississippi Ex
position and Fellow-Citizens: It is with
genuine pleasure that 1 meet once more
the people of Omaiia, whose wealth
of welcome is not altogether unfamiliar
to me. and whose warm hearts have be
fore touched and moved me. For this re
newed manifestation of your regard and
for the cordial reception of to-day my
heart responds with profound gratitude
and a deep appreciation which 1 cannot
conceal, and which the language of compli
ment is inadequate to convey. My greet
ing not alone to your city and the State
of Nebraska, but to the people of all the
States of the Trans-Mississippi group par
ticipating, and I cannot withhold congrat
ulations over the evidences of their pros
perity furnished by this great exposition.
If testimony were needed to establish the
fact that their pluck has not deserted
them, and that prosperity is again with
them, it is found here. This picture dis
pels all doubt.
In an age of expositions they have added
yet another magnificent example. The
historical celebrations at Philadelphia and
Chicago and the splendid exhibits at New
Orleans, Atlanta and Nashville are now
a part of the past, and yet in Influence
they still live, and their beneficent results
are closely Interwoven with our national
development. Similar rewards will honor
the authors and patrons of the Trans-
Mlssissipp] Exposition. The contribution
will mark another epoch in the nation's
material advancement.
Continuing, the President referred at
length to the lessons of patriotism
taught by the late war, paying glowing
tribute to the gallant service of the
country's army and navy.
The inspiring conclusion of the
President's address wa.s the signal for
a Bcene of wild acclamation.
Bowing and smiling to the crowd of
enthusiastic constituents the President
Bat down and gave way to Postmaster
General Smith, whose speech came
next on the programme. Mr. Smith's
reception was almost as fluttering rb
that given to the President. He spoke
briefly along lines similar to those fol
lowed by his chief, dwelling particu
larly upon the magnitude of the expo
sition and the marvelous energy and
genius which the great West had de
voted to its consummation.
After Mr. Smith had concluded the
surging throng of humanity around the
platform clamored for more. Loud calls
for General Miles, Senators Allen and
Thurston and Governor Holcomb were
heard, and they advanced in succession
to the front of the platform and In re
sponse to the deafening cheers of the
people bowed and smiled their ac
knowledgments, but did not make any
remarks. Then the Chinese Minister,
the Korean Minister and Senor Quesa
da, the Cuban emissary, were brought
forward in response to the demands of
the crowd. Patriotic selections by the
band closed the exercises on the plat
form.
JESSE JAMES HAS A
FRIEND ON THE BENCH
Released by Order of a Circuit Judge,
but Promptly Rearrested by
the Police.
KANSAS CITY, Oct. 12.â .Tesp* J.-imeÃ,
the 21-year-old son of the notorious bandit '
of border days In Kansas and Missouri,
who was arrested yesterday for com- '
pllelty in the recent Missouri Pacific train
robbery, was brought before circuit .
Court Judge Henry this morning under |
habeas corpus proceedings, and the court
ordered his release. Judge Henry scored
the prosecuting attorney and the police
for having permitted the arrest without a
warrant. Ex-Governor Crlttenden. who !
was in the courtroom, denounced the ar- i
n hi of young James as a "greater crime ]
than train robbery."
The police put on a bold front, how
ever, and immediately after James was ;
released by Judge Henry to-day he was
arrested on a State warrant. Later i
James wns released under $25tX) ball.
W. E. Lowe, Andy Ryan and at least !
one or two other suspects are also under !
nrrest. Andy Kyan is a brother of Bill !
Ryan of the "old James gang, and was un
til recently in the Kansas City Pire De- |
j>ar!ment.
The police state that Lowe has made a
full confession, implicating James, Ryan |
and others and that they will be able to
Froduce evidence fully corroborating ;
jowe's statement in essential points.

CALIFORNIA KNIGHTS
RECEIVE VISITORS
Keep Open House at
Their Headquarters.
EASTERN TEMPLARS GREETED
PBOCEEDINGS OF THE GRAND
ENCAMPMENT.
One Proposed Amendment to the
Constitution Imposes Conditions
on Membership in the
Commanderies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Oct. 12.â This afternoon
the headquarters of California Com
mandery No. 1, in the Carnegie build
ing, were thrown open to all visiting
Knights Templar. To-morrow had been
originally chosen as the day for the big
reception by the Golden State Knights,
but in especial deference to Detroit vis
itors and others who wanted to leave
the city to-night the Californians de
cided to have open house this after
noon. .Long before the doors opened
there was a big crowd on the sidevsalk
in front of the headquarters and a
steady stream poured in and out of the
handsomely decorated rooms until
nightfall, when the reception came to
an end and the headquarters were
closed.
To-morrow a general reception to uni
formed Knights and their ladies will be
given, and in the evening there will be
a special reception. The Grand Com
mandery, assisted by California Com
mander; No. 1, will receive the officers
of the Grand Encampment, after which
the headquarters of California Com
mandery No. 1 will be closed.
With the exception of receiving the
members of Detroit and other com
mauderies that had to leave for home
before to-morrow nothing was done by
the Californians to-day. A few of
them spent part of the day visiting the
headquarters of other commanderies,
and in the evening th.-y went to the ball
of the Tancred Commandery in the
courthouse. Many of them will leave
for home to-morrow night. The party
will split, some going East to visit rela
tives, while others will journey h<mie
to California leisurely. The California
delegates are pledged to Louisville for
the next conclave.

PROCEEDINGS IN THE
GRAND ENCAMPMENT
riTTSBURG, Oct. 12.â The weather
to-day was very line. The effects of
yesterday's showers are all obliterated
and the successful carrying out of the
different features of the lengthy
Knights Templar programme for to
day was assured. During the day an
exhibition drill took place on the race
track in Schley Park.
The Grand Encampment Knights
Templar resumed its meeting to-day In
Carnegie Hall. Past Grand Master
James H. Hopkins of Washington, D.
C, proposed two amendments to the
constitution. In one It was proposed
to amend section 3 of article I, so as
to read: "A stated conclave shall be
held triennially in Washington, D. C,
on the second Tuesday of October, un
less the Grand Encampment shall at a
Stated conclave designate some other
time and place."
The other proposed to amend section
1. article I, by placing the Grand Pro
late next in line after the Grand Junior
Warden.
An amendment was also offered by
Past Grand Master William R. Bowen
of Nebraska to the code of st.-ttutes as
follows: â Membership in a command
ery Is dependent upon and coexistent
with membership in a lodge of Free
Masons. Any companion of the Red
Cross of Knights Templar who re
mains for six months unafflllated with
a lodge of Free Masons is lpso facto
siiHsÂ»nded in Knight Templary, such
suspension to be terminated by affilia
tion with a lodge."

Calls Millionaire Charles A. Williams, Her Former
Husband, a Coward and a Brute, and
She Warns His Fiancee.
Photograph Culled From Pinkerton's
Rogue Gallery â Sealskin Coat

Charles A. Williams placed
himself in communication with
Cheyenne yesterday in the hope
of inducing his former wife,
Mrs. Emma J. NagJe, to exoner
ate him from the charges pre
ferred against him as quoted in
The Call from the police records
of Luc low-street j*iil, New York.
W : liams need expect no help
from that quarter, as the follow
ing statement made last evening
by his ex-wlfe will show:
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Oct. 12.â "1 am
going to write to the young lady In San
Francisco and tell her what a villain
Charles A. White is," said Mrs. Emma
J. Nagle this evening. "I was his wife
for over a year, ano I consider It my duty
to warn any woman who may be under
his influence. Before I married him he
was apparently kind, considerate, cul
tured, generous and all that a man should
be. After I was murried to him twenty
tour hours I began to realize that he was
a fraud, and before I was his wife six
weeks I knew lie was a demon. 1 was
tnarriei! to White on August 31, l^yl. at
my residence here. Before our marriage
he informed me that he was a part owner
of the London Illustrated News and
owner of several books and that his In
come was $10,000 a year.
"I coon found out that he had no Income
excepting what he secured from me.
Within a few weeks after our marriage he
began to habitually use the most Indecent
and profane language to me In the hear
:ng of my frit ndfl and relatives. On June
X, ISS2, White, who had been East sev
eral months, returned to Cheyenne early
in the morning, and, without any cause or
word of explanation, commenced throwing
books and otlur articles at me, and fin
ally threw a water pitcher.
"On June 29 he struck me three times
m the fare with his clenched fist. That
night he kicked me in the side, inflicting
Severe bruises. On the Ist of July he
;hokiÂ»d me and bit me in the face, bo that
olood flowed from the wound. At the
same time he struck me behind the ear
BO violently that I whs ill for several
(reeks. During the same month he drove
3ie out of my house.
"In August he rushed upon me while at
:he dining table and was about to beat me,
when my son threatened to shoot him. In
the same month he struck me repeatedly.
Dn August 23 he had prepared a mortgage
apon my property and a promissory note
for $?â¢" 000, and requested me to sign them,
t declined, and he beat me violently and
threatened to kill me, and under the fear
Df his threats I signed the papers. After
this hit; abuse continued, and he told me
tie Intended to take all my property and
leave me penniless. He had, shortly after
marriage, secured from me a power of
attorney, a:;d under it had signed checks
Dn my deposits in the local banks, taking
altogether about $40,000. On September 6,
ISS2. White left, saying he was going to
New York and would not return.
"I was bo frightened and crushed by his
treatment that it was several days after
be had K"ne before I could even muster
courage to tell my story to a lawyer. I
commenced suit against him at once for
divorce and in my petition alleged what
[ have told you, and at the trial proved
the charges, the divorce being granted
me at
"I commenced civil suits against "Whit-3
to recover notes, money and securities
amounting to nearly one hundred thou
sand dollars. I recovered a considerable
amount, and had the slight satisfaction
of knowing that he spent fix weeks in
Ludlow street Jail pending the proceed
ings to bring him back here on the charge
Df embezzlement and larceny.
"White was not only cruel and abusive
to me but his habit.; were of the vilest
character. During the year of our mar
ried life a notorious woman who went
Dy the name of Zoe Owens, living in Chi
cago, came to the city and announced
that she was White's wife. When pro
ceedings were commenced against White

have me testify against him, but I re

of him from my mind, the year that I

WILLIAMS' RECORD
IN THE WINDY CITY
CHICAGO, Oct. 12.â Charles A. White,
alias Williams, who was engaged to
marry a Fan Francisco belle and heiress,
is well known as t>nderloin society Is
known, and some years ago had quite
a reputation as a rounder and money
spender among the demi-monde. At that
time he was supposed to be a Wyoming
rancher, and his periodical visits were
looked forward to with delight by saloon
keepers and disreputable women, with
whom he usf-d to consort on those occa
sions. Among the women favored by his
attentions was Zoe Owens, then reigning
queen of her class, upon whom he lav
ished cheap affections and costlier jewels.
He established her in sumptuously fur
nished apartments on Jackson boulevard
and Michigan avenue, and on several oc
casions took her to his Wyoming home.
His relations with her were kept up for
three or four years, when he suddenly
disappeared, his whereabouts remaining
a mystery even to the Owens woman,
who subsequently learned through a third
party that her erstwhile friend, whom she
spoke of to associates and Intimates as
"Prince Charlie," was in South Africa.
Soon after getting this information Mi.ss
Owens left Chicago without warning, and
it was supposed she too had gone to the
diamond fields, but about a year ago she
was found to have taken up her residence
in Brooklyn.
SENTIMENT OF PEOPLE
WHO ENTERTAINELHIM
In social as well as business circles the
Williams exposure continues to be the
sole topic of interest. It is a subject
which unites all classes on a common
platform that has for its insignia the all
powerful love of what Is timely news. *
Reflection and reason have brought a
new actor into the stirring social drama,
and into what now must be turned the
second act of the powerful domestic play.
Williams is relegated to second part, and
the man who is responsible for his in
troduction assumes the leading role.
"We do not care who this man â or,
what his name â White, Williamsâ is,"
says the select circle In which the alleged
mine-owner heretofore moved. "We don't
know him. Hut we do know youâ at least
we hope we do, and we want you to ex
plain what you meant by Introducing such
a character into our homes."
This asking for an explanation, how
ever, seems to be merely a matter of
form. Translated from the misleading
language of the select into serviceable
and sterling English, It says: "Mr. Spon
sor, socially speaking, you are a dead
man. Don't come and see us any more."
In direct measure as the sympathy for
the impoÃed-upon beautiful girl who was
to have been Williams' wife increases,
contempt and loathing for the impostor
augments. The friends and admirers of
the fair fiancee suffer with her, and yet
are cruelly denied the comfort that openly
expressed sympathy might bring. An in
nate sense of delicacy prevents them call
ing upon her, and written words are too
cold to picture the depths of the sincere
affection all those who have had the hap
piness of knowing her feel.
The outside world, the cruel observing
outside world, looks on at this drama
that almost proved a tragedy, and pro
pounds conundrums that no one can and
no one attempts to guess. Among other
things it asks: "Are there really dia
mond mines and millions galore?" "Will
the wedding ever take place?" And last
but hardly least. "What are they going to
do to Williams social sponsor?"
WILLIAMS SETTLES
THE SHERIFF'S CLAIM
Deputy Bherlff Richard O'Connor had
another unpleasant experience early yes
terday morning In attempting for the sec
ond time to attach the personal effects
belonging to Williams at the lutter's
rooms, 1105 Bush street. Accompanied by
Attorney Allen, from Mr. Rankins office,
the deputy presented himself, at 7:30 a. m.,
at the front door leading to Williams'
lodgings. A manservant responded, and
stated thut Williams was not at home.
"If he was, you couldn't come in," added
the man. "You might Just aa well clear
out." O'Connor Rave up the attempt to
serve the attachment, and reported to
Sheriff Whelan the result of his trip.
Williams visited Attorney Rankin, rep
resenting Btudebaker Brothers, yesterday
morning. He secured a copy of the com
plaint and went at once to his legal rep
resentative, Jesse W. Lilienthal. The
complaint recited that goods to the value
of $3<Xm) had been purchased by Williams,
and $730 of this remained unpaid.
"Mr. Williams explained t<> me," said
Mr. Lilienthal yesterday, "that, so far aa
he could remember the dispute arose
originally over the fact that some of tho
vehicles had defective springs. He thought
he was entitled to a rebate. Jtte felt It an

(Chicago, 1592.)
unjust claim, but rather than fight It he
instructed me to draw a check In settle
ment."
PICTURES TELL A
STORY OF DECEPTION
"Words may be juggled until they can
be made to fit. almost any required ver
sion of a tale. The camera, however,
bears mute testimony that cannot be con
troverted. The criminal and the crim
inal hunter acknowledge this fact.
When Mr. Williams posed before the
camera in Chicago to gratify the whim
of the exacting- Zoe Owens, little did he
think that that portrait, designed to
adorn the demi-monde's boudoir, would
find a resting-place in Plnkerton's rogues'
gallery.
Another unfortunate circumstance con
nected with the useful art of photog
raphy, from the criminal's point of
view, is the facility with which reproduc
tions are made. Mr. Williams, like
others, has cause to regret the fact. In
every branch office of the Pinkertons
throughout the world Williams' picture
Is tiled away against the day It may be
needed.
Williams' life, with Its series of pyro
technical displays and dramatic episodes,
is not one easily relegated to the recesses
of obscurity. They leave their Impress.
The Pinkertons, whose boast is that they
never sleep and hardly ever forget, need
no references to recall Williams' car' :r.
In 1592 Williams had his photograph
taken to distribute along the tenderloin.
A comparison of his appearance then
with his appearance now shows the grad
ual progression from the gold brick man
to the swell society impostor. They in
dicate the change of tactics with the
change of coat. The sealskin and expan
sive, shirt front of 1593 calculated to Im
press and capture the rural visitor is re
placed in 1898 by the Tuxedo, bait for
higher and more worldly game.
The first step into the real world was
his introduction at the Rand Club, Jo
hannesburg. South Africa. Adapting
himself to his surroundings, he gradually
doffed the chrysalis and came forth, the
butterfly. If those who knew him while
in Chicago could now meet him here they
would find In his changed appearance
much at which to marvel. He now pre
sents the well-groomed appearance of the
man of the world. It is a far, cry from
the sealskin overcoat of the habitue of
the Chicago tenderloin to Tuxedo even
ing coat of the present time.
DETECTIVE PINKERTON
VOUCHES FOR STOLL
"In the statements made for publica
tion by Williams," said Detective William
A. Plnkfrton yesterday, "he attempts to
cast a slur upon the character of Attor
ney W. K. Stoll of Cheyenne.
"I have had business dealings with Mr.
Stoll for twelve years," continued Mr.
Pinkerton, "and have found him a cap
able, a fearless and an honest man. He
bears .the highest reputation throughout
Wyoming, lie was District Attorney of
Cheyenne and was a bright, intelligent
official. Williams cannot hope to
strengthen his case by attacking tho
probity of that man."
PREPARING FOR THE
POLICE COURT ELECTION
CITY CHARTER AMENDMENT TO
BE VOTED UPON.
A Lively Contest Expected at the
Polls Next Saturday Between
Opposing Factions.
BERKELEY, Oct. 12.â A special elec
tion for the residents of the university
town has been called by the Board of
Trustees for next Saturday, October 15.
The election is for the purpose of deciding
whether or not Berkeley shall have a
Police Court. It will take the form of
voting upon an amendment to the city
charter, providing for the establishment
of a local Judiciary having jurisdiction
over violations of city ordinances and
minor misdemeanors.
The measure, however, is likely to en
counter a very serious opposition. The
bone of contention is an article of the
amendment calling for the appointment of
the Police Judge by the Board of Trus
tees. A very strong faction has devel
oped which is bent upon opposing this
system of appointment. They charge the
Trustees and the Town Attorney with
trying to railroad through a scheme
which shall make the Police Judge' a mere
tool in their hands.
The Trustees, individually, who passed
the amendment, the Good Government
Club, the North Berkeley Improvement
Club and the residents or the East End
generally are known to be strongly in
favor of the provision just as it stands.
The opposition is confined to certain sec
tions or the West End and the South End.

mourning- when the vessel docked yes

"Frenchy," the ship's mascot, died and
was buried at sea. Frenchy was the
sucking pig secured at the island of
Guam, where the Australia touched on
her way to Manila with troops. The
little animal became a great pet, and was
taught a number of tricks. After its
death the carpenter made a coffin for It,
and the chief officer placed the following

stuff in Whitehall boats.
ered a eulogy before the assembled pas
sengers and crew. The following are
Purser McComb's notes of the speech:
"Frenchy was born on the beautiful Isl
and of Guam, one of the Ladrones, about
' June 1 fast, and was there captured
! three weeks later by United States troops
while on a foraging expedition. Being of
a tender age Frenchy was raised on a
bottle, and it was not long before her
quaint manners endeared her to the en
tire crew of the Australia, more particu
larly to George Kittle, the carpenter, who
fed and cared for her. During her Ill
ness he made a bed of banana Teaves for
her, and stayed by her to the last, and
her spirit has passed over to him who
notes the sparrow's fall.
"Who dares to say, 'It did not?'
"What proof have you, mortal, that the
most insignificant of God's creation is not
endowed with the spirit which is the hie?
"The life of all things, animate and in

! Pale Angel to bring that life back to him:
; and so this pig, who owes its creation ana
life to him, also owes its death to him.
"Mortal, don't get a big head because
i you're not a pig, for you may be one and
not know It. Elevated as you are in let
ters, music, hypocrisy and pride, you may
forget how much more God expects of
you. being 'lord of creation,' than if you
were only one of the rank and iile of
creation. â¢ * *

The next day after the funeral the

While at Honolulu the troopship Penn
sylvania arrived from Manila, and was to
leave for San Francisco a couple of days
later. She will probably get nere about
Saturday, and as the Zealandiu is due
from Nagasaki on that date also, there
will be seven transports here getting
ready to take out troops. The ship Ta
coma will also probably sail a"-am for
Manila with horses. If she does, a new
donkey-engine will have to be put in, as
the one now on the vessel, which waa put
in by the Government, is too small.

Captain George Gibson and the gasoline
schooner Duxbury are in trouble. Overs
week ago the vessel started for the Â«erKe

she still lies on the mud flats, only half
discharged. Captain Gibson soon found
that he could not get up to the wharf,
and, after waiting four days for a mgn
tide, he tried to warp his vessel off into
deep water. This he failed to do, as the
Duxbury was hard and fast. After sev
eral attempts at getting the vessel off , he
came over to San Francisco and. securing
a Whitehall, went back and be Sf n n v "|Â£^:

Captain Gibson expects to get jrid of his

TEACHER SOPER
HAS SKIPPED
FOR MONGOLIA
i He Defrauded Four
: Brokers.
i SCHOOL BOARD DROPS HIM
; FACTS CAME OUT AT YESTER
DAY'S MEETING.
â  I
Plans for a Noe Valley Schoolhouss
Adopted, but Action on.
the Construction
Delayed.
A sensation developed at yesterday's '
| meeting of the School Board, when, with
! out warning, a resolution was presented
dropping 11. F. Soper from the roll of
teachers "for non-compliance with the
rules." The resolution was adopted with
out discussion, a statement of the facts
leading up to the resolution having been
! privately made to the members of the
I board In secret session as a committee
jof the whole. The story, as told by one
of the members of the board, Is substan
tially as follows:
Soper, who was a teacher In the Ham
i ilton Evening School, had left town,
after having swindled a number of war
rant brokers to the tune of several hun- :
dred dollars. He had gone to these per
sons and made out orders for his August
and September salaries, selling the
same at a small discount and pocketing
the cash. He sold his order for his $50
August salary to Solomon Kampe and
again to James F. Snelling. The same
tactics were followed on a more exten
sive scale with his September salary of
$50, which was in turn sold to Solomon
Kampe, August Weihe, James F. Snell
ing and the San Francisco Collateral
Loan Hank, each receiving an order on
the Treasurer lor the amount. Kampe
happened to present both orders several
days ago in advance of the other holders
and the money was paid to him without
a suspicion that fraud 1 had been com
mitted. Latter the regaining orders
turned up at the office of the clerk of the
Board of Education, and the swindle was
exposed. Inquiry for Soper revealed the
fact that he was missing. - It was sub
sequently reported that he had left on j
an Asiatic boat in the capacity of a
waiter.
The question of appealing from the re
cent decision of the Superior Court, rein
stating K. C. Kilpatrick as prlncipu.l of
the Business Evening School, furnished
opportunity to Director Gallagher to be
rate the Judge who rendered the decision.
"It was simply rotten!" shouted Gal
lagher, "and the Juilpe was biased by po
litical reasons. It was the most shame
less decision ever rendered in a California
court. We should appeal:" The board
coincided with Gallagher and decided to
file an appeal with the Supreme Court.
Another important matter was the se
lection of plans for a line new school
building at Twenty-third and Douglass
streets. The successful competing archi
tect was T. J. Welsh. His plans pro
vide for a twelve class room build
ing two stories high, with B]
rooms for principal, teachers and schol
ars. The building is s* arranged that all
of the class-rooms have an eastern ex
posure and plenty of light. The estimated
cost of the structure is Â£>0,000.
Members of the board stated after the
meeting that there was a strong probabil
ity that the new school building would not
be constructed this year, owing to lack of
funds. The matt' r has not, however,
been finally settle I
Miss Agnes McLa Jin was transferred
from the John Swett Grammar School and
elected principal of the new school at
Forty-third street and Point Lobos
avenue. Mrs. S. W. McPherson. teacher
of mathematics in Polytechnic High
School, was chosen head of the mathe
matical department of the same school.
C. H. Crowe!! of the Mission High S
was transferred to the High School Class
of the Horace Mann Evening- School.
Miss Rose Ryan of the secondary sub
stitute list, was elected a regular High
School teacher and assigned to the place
vacated by C. H. CroweU.
The board discussed at some length the
recommendation of the committee on
evnning schools that Myrtle Cerf, an ex
tra substitute teacher of bookkeeping in
the Spring Valley School, bo assigned as
teacher of said class, and that L. A.
Ramus, an extra substitute teacher of
bookkeeping In the Hamilton Evening
School, be assigned as teacher of said
class.
Director Head entered a violent pro
test, which was seconded by Carew,
against appointing any more teachers
when the board is confronted with a de
ficit in the school fund. Head read a
statement showing that the board has
already expended during the present
school year $254,267. and that at the pres
ent rate of expenditures there will be a
deficit at the close of the year of $200,0)0.
He stated that the board now has left
out of its appropriation a sum that will
only permit of the expenditure of $85,000
per month for the remainder of the year,
whereas the present salaries and ex
penses aggregate $93,500 per month. By
a vote of six to five the board decided not
to appoint the two teachers.
The four conspirators charged with
defrauding the city through false and
fraudulent bills presented to the School
Board for lumber, surrendered them
selves at the City Prison yesterday morn
ing. They had previously prepared thom
selvrs with bondsmen, and were promptly
released each on $1000 bonds.
Director T. A. Burns had as his sure
ties F. B. Lorigan. 843 Castro street and
Charles Campodonico. 1411^ Mason street
John J. O'Brien, Inspector of buildings'
had David Salfield, 61S Broderick street'
and P. F. Nolan, 812 Market street'
George S. Graham, assistant inspector"
had Thomas D. Riordan, 828 Montgomery
street, and School Director Burns Ed
ward D. Swift, contractor, had Edward
F. Franks. 9S Fillmore street, and F C
Mack, 423 Waller street. Burns and
O'Brien's bonds were accepted by Clerk
Kohlmann of Judge Mogan's court-
Swift's by Clerk Hayes of Judge Jo
aohimsen's court, and Graham's by Judge
Low.
The cases will be called in Judge Low's
court this morning, but a continuance
will probably be asked and granted.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
When a young woman sits down and
ponders over her future life, there is one
all-important subject which she should not
forget. In a day dream she may build
castles in the air with a happy home, laugh-
Ing children and a loving husband in the
fore-ground. At tkat moment she may be
facing death. Matrimony and motherhood
hold out no happiness to the young woman
who suffers from weakness and disease of
the distinctly feminine organism. The wo-
man who suffers in this way will be a weak;
nervous, sickly, petulant wife, an incapable
mother and an unamiable hostess. Xot
knowing the truth, her acquaintances will
not understand that she is deserving of
pity rather than reproach. .
Any woman may be strong and healthy
in a womanly way if she will use the right
remedy. Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription
is the best of all medicines for weak and
ailing women. It acts directly on the de-
licate and important organs that make wife-
hood and motherhood possible. It raake3
them strong, healthy and vigorous. It
banishes the dangers that surround ma-
ternity. It insures a healthy baby and an
ample supply of nourishment. Thousands
of women who were weak, sickly, nervous
invalids, are now healthy, robust wives and
competent mothers of heaith5 r children, as
the result of the use of this medicine.
Mrs. John M. Conklin, of Patterson, Putnam
Co., N. V., (Box 104), writes: "I am etroying
perfect health and have been since I took the last
bottle of Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription. I
had falling of thf internal orgaas, or female
weakness, and flowing caused by miscarriage,
and was very weak when I commenced taking
your medicine."
