Results in the Resignation of
General Boisdeffre, Chief of

General Sentiment That the Sensational Devel

of the Entire Matter.
PARIS, Aug. 31.â Lieutenant Colonel Henry, one
of tire most prominent witnesses in the celebrated
DreyFus case, who was arrested yesterday after
confessing to having forged an important document
used as evidence, committed suicide to-night by
cutting his throat with a razor.
General Le Mouton de Boisdeffre, chief of the
genera! staff of the French army, resigned on learn
ing of the confession of Colonel Henry, owing to his
misplaced confidence in the confessed perjurer.

PARIS, Aug. 31.â Nothing can de
scribe the stupefaction of Paris this
morning. Even the Czar's disarma

war, not peace, is in the air. So much
ink has been used, so much passion let

And Just when things reached this
stage a bombshell has burst. This is
the arrest and suicide -.of Lieutenant
Colonel Henry, who acknowledged that
he was the author of the letter that vir
tually convicted Dreyfus..
You will remember the dramatic
scene during the first Zola trial, when
Henry, with trejnbling voice, referred
to his service in Algiers, which had left
him with an incurable malarial fever.
This same man, who seemed the very
personification of integrity and who
made such an impression on the public
in court, is now by his own confession
a forger of the document intended to
cor."ict his brother officer.
The news of his arrest only leaked
out after midnight. It appears that
Colonel Picquardt, who has been a
strong supporter of Dreyfus' innocence,
had laid before M. Cavalgnac, the Min
ister of War, evidence which the law
of prlfessional secrecy prevented him
from making publicly known.

of the possibility of a judicial error
since his return. He has questioned one
after another of the officers whose
names have .been prominent in the
Dreyfus case. Yesterday morning he
summoned Colonel Henry to his office
in the War Department building.
â¢General Roger, Chief of the Military-
Cabinet, was present at the interview.
Colonel Henry was questioned upon thÂ«
way,' in ~ which this too famous letiw
came into his hands. Pressed to the
wall, he finally made a complete 1 con
fession, trying at the \ same . time j* to
show how necessary it was at that mo
ment to accumulate proofs of Dreyfus'
guilt. â¢ " V : '^7 .. â¢
One naturally asks why Colonel
Henry was not pressed to the wall by
pressing these questions long ago.
M. Cavaignac is said to be prostrat
ed by this discovery. It is not aston
ishing, in view of the stand M. Cavaig
nac has taken in the matter, and of
the declarations he has made, no
longer than July 8 of this very year,
when he said he was absolutely con
vinced of the guilt of Captain Dreyfus.
One of the things which led him to
this conviction was this very letter
which Colonel Henry now admits he
had forged. The speech which the
Minister of War delivered on this oc
casion had such an effect upon the
Chamber that it was ordered that it
be printed and posted all over France.

confession threatens to rekindle the
Dreyfus agitation more heatedly than
ever and seems likely to shake public
confidence in the army.
The scene of Lieutenant Colonel Hen
ry's avowal was most painful. When
he saw It was almost useless to deny
further his tongue grew so thick that
he was unable to speak. It was feared
that he would have an apoplectic
stroke. After his arrest he was permit
ted to visit his wife white on the way
to the fortress at Montvalerien. She
thought he really had had a fit. He
addressed her as "my poor wife," add
ing: "I am under arrest."
The officer accompanying him was
under orders not to lose sight of him
fur a moment, and, therefore, he could
not see his wife alone. All three pro
ceeded to his bedroom to get the nec
essary clothing. Henry then clasped
his wife in his arms and exclaimed i
"My conscience is pure and free from
every sting."
This exclamation is much comment
ed up, as going to show that he may
possibly have forged the letter under
orders from his superiors.
Colonel Henry was attached to the
War Department when Dreyfus was
convicted, and he was one of the prom
inent witnesses who testified unfavor
ably of M. Zola during the latter's sen
sational trial on the charge of libeling
military officials.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry cut his
throat with a razor he had concealed
In his valise.
During the late Zola trial Henry ac
cused Colonel Picquart of falsifying
telegrams. A duel followed, in which
Henry was wounded. The next scene
occurred In the Chamber of Deputies,
where Colonel Picquart proclaimed the
letter a forgery, and as a result was
arrested, while Henry's villainy was re
warded by his being appoints Colonel
Picquart's successor in the Intelligence
Department.
It is now evident that Henry forged
the letter with the express object of
paralyzing Colonel Picquart's efforts
HOW THE CONFESSION WAS
WRUNG FROM THE FORGER.
PARTS, Aug. 31.â When Lieutenant Colonel Henry was summoned
to the residence of the Minister of War Ihe found assembled there
Colonel Paty dv Clam, Count Esterhazy, General Bolsdeffre, Gen
eral Ropet and M. Cavaignac. The Minister of War had the sus
pected letter on his desk. He took It up and said to Henry:
"You did not mention the name of the agent who furnished this
letter. My attention has been called to the fact that on the docket
there is no name."
Colonel Henry beat his forehead and then said he had forgotten
the name in this case, but he would know the man If he saw him.
'â¢It is a pity you have forgotten," said M. Cavaignac. "We think
the letter a forgery and that you have been duped by a clever
forger."
Henry declared his belief in its authenticity, but in a very faint
voice.
"Come," said the Minister. "No agent ever gave It to you. You
wrote in pencil to disguise your handwriting the better. You are the
forger."
The colonel's speech grew thick, but he denied the charge. Then
it was repeated and he gave fresh signs of agitation. But his tongue
began to cleave to the roof of his mouth and it was feared that he
would have an apoplectic stroke.
."On your honor as a soldier," said M. Cavaignac, more gently,
"did you, or did you not write that letter?"
"Since you appeal to my soldierly honor, It was I who wrote it,"
replied Henry.
to expose Major Esterhazy and to get
a revision of the Dreyfus case. The
letter was written in bad French, a
fact which first led it to be regarded
as spurious.
It is said that if 'the Cabinet decides
upon the revision of the Dreyfus case,
M. Cavaignac, Minister for War, will
resign.
Colonel Henry was a peasant's son.
He was born in Pousey, la Marne, In
1848, and enlisted In a foot regiment
as his brother's substitute in 1863. He
had a good military record for bravery
and inexorable discipline. He was a
prisoner of war in 1870 and was wound
ed in the Algerian campaign. He re
tained much of the rough and ready
manners of a non-commissioned offi
cer. He was lacking in education,
spoke no foreign languages and owed

MAGUIRE SUED
FOR TAX BILLS
He Has Been for Several Years
Very Prominent as a De
linquent
City and County Attorney Gallagher Had the
Bills Paid Yesterday in the Hope of
Avoiding an Exposure.
The State treasury and the city and
county treasury will be slightly bene
fited by the candidacy of James G. Ma
guire. the Populist-Silver Republican-
Democratic nominee for Governor. His
delinquent taxes were paid yesterday
through James Gallagher, City and
County Attorney, and chief apologist
for any oversights on the part of the
"Little Pinto Giant" in paying the
government what he justly owes.
Apologist Gallagher has still another
task on hand befcre his work of "clear
ing" Maguire's record is complete. It
will be necessary for him to consult
Walter M. W r illett, special n-ttorney for
the collection of delinquent taxes, and
have the suits brought by Willett to
recover the unpaid taxes of Maguire
dismissed in the Justices' Court. The
"Little Pinto Giant" now has a clean
bill of health, so far as the Tax Col
lector's office is concerned, but not so
with the Justices' Court.
The suits are still on file and untried,
but it is probable that within the next
few days judgments of dismissal will
be entered and the head of the pinto
ticket will be at liberty to talk on tax
ation without blushing 1 . As every one
knows, Maguire has a pet hobby when
on the rostrum, and that is single tax.

He argues long and earnestly to con
vince voters that upon the success of
the single-tax movement depends their
advancement and prosperity. The re
cords in the Tax Collector's office and
Justices' Court bear silent evidence,
however, that Maguire is more strong
ly inclined toward a non-tax system.
If every one took the same view of tax
ation as does Congressman Maguire,
judging from his record as a delin
quent taxpayer, there would be 1 o
funds in the treasury to meet the ex
penses of the Government. The Po
lice and Fire departments would cease
to exist; the public schools would
necessarily be closed; the credit of the
State would be ruined and the local
government vould go out of existence.
No one better understands than cioes
Congressman Maguire that it requires
money to keep the wheels of govern
ment in motion. Still he is, apparent
ly, unwilling to contribute his mite to
ward paying the expenses of the mu
nicipal and State governments. Draw
ing a salary of $5000 a year as Con
gressman and also receiving an income
from his law practice, he has not paid
the light tax placed on his law library
in the Mills building.
City and County Attorney Gallagher
went to the rescue of Maguire yester
day and had the delinquent taxes paid
when he learned that The Call was
looking up Maguire's record on that
score. Under these circumstances no
credit is due Maguire because the word
"Paid" has been stamped opposite his
name on the delinquent rolls in the Tax
Collector's office. Gallagher in his good
ness of heart may also go to the rescue
of James H. Barry, "the logical suc
cessor" of Maguire in the Fourth Con
gressional District. If he does he will
have to draw heavily on his bank ac
count. Less than $15 placed Maguire
straight on the records of the Tax
Collector's office. In the case of
Barry, the footings show that it would
require $908 76 to settle his t x ac
count with the city and State. As
Barry says that he will not pay Apolo
gist Gallagher can hardly be expected
to Bhoulder the indebtedness.
In 1893 Congressman Maguire was as
seased for $300 on his library and $50
for his watch. The taxes amounted to
$3 61 for city and county purposes and
$2 02 for State purposes. Maguire did
not deem it necessary to pay the taxes
and his name went on the delinquent
roll. In due course of time Attorney
Willett, who looks after the collection
of delinquent taxes, brought suit and
the case is still on file in the Justices'
Court. The papers are numbered 183,
609.
It was the same old story in 1894.
Maguire was assessed for $500 and the
taxes, amounting to $7 83, were not
paid. Another suit was commenced. A
copy of the complaint in that case is
published in these columns. The suit
was brought against James Magruire
for taxes on the fixtures in his law of
fice in the Mills building and on his
library. In maklr.g out the assessment
the clerk drew the statement against
James Maguire instead of James G.
Maguire. The property assessed, how
ever, is the property of James Q. Ma
guire and was in his office in the Mills
building.
Maguire had another attack of "cold
feet" on the tax-paying proposition In
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
i 895, ana his name again went on the
delinquent tax roll. A suit in the
Justices' Court, No. 26,654, shows that
he did not pay $15 75 taxes. When he
was a candidate for Congress in 1896
it was suggested to .him that the de
linquent roll might be used against
him, so on August 14, 1896, the taxes
were paid. But the bills of 1893 and
1894 remained unpaid until a deputy in
the Tax Collector's office learned yes
terday that The Call was investigating
Congressman Maguire's non-paying
tax record. The news was hurriedly
conveyed to Gallagher, and ten min
utes later both of the old bills were
paid. The next move now to be made
will be the dismissal of the suits in the
Justices' Court.
Gallagher, when spoken to about the
matter last night, said that it was all
due to an oversight that the taxes had
not been paid before. "Congressman
Maguire is a busy man," said he, "and
the unpaid assessments were arbitrarily
levied. Don't think for a moment that
he intended shirking the payment."
"But why did he not pay them when
he paid the. '95 tax?" was asked.
"It was not called to his attention,"
replied Gallagher. "In fact we did not
know of the delinquency until I re
ceived information this afternoon that
The Call was examining the records.
Why, if I had known of the delinquen
cies I would have paid the bills myself
at the time."
"Who paid the bills this afternoon?"
"I did not pay them personally,"
answered Gallagher. "Is it not suffi
cient to know that they have been paid
and that an unfortunate mistake has
been corrected?"
"What will become of the suits in the
Jnstices' Court?"
"They will be dismissed of course,"
was the answer. 'Now let the matter
drop," continued Gallagher. "It is all
a mistake. Judge Maguire didn't
know of the tax bills being unpaid.
Had the matter been called to his at
tention before The Call commenced the
investigation he would have paid them
himself.* He daily gives away to strik
ers more than the amount involved."
Apologist Gallagher is evidently la
boring under a "mistake."
Walter M. Willett, special attorney
for the collection of delinquent taxes,
differs with Gallagher on the point
that Judge M quire did not know of
the delinquency. "I spoke to him about
the matter," said Willett, rather re
luctantly last night, "and he promised
to settle the suits. I heard late this
evening that the bills had been paid at
the Tax Collectors office, but by
wohm I do not know."
The apology offered on behalf of
Congressman Maguire by Attorney
Gallagher may seem sufficient to him.
but it will not satisfy the people. A
candidate who aspires to govern the
great and growing State of California
should be above such petty work as
endeavoring to avoid paying the tax on
his watch and library. If the majority
of the citizens were of the same caliber
as Congressman Maguire the Govern
ment would be in a chaotic state in a
very short time. Unless the taxes are
paid, and every one willingly and
cheerfully contributes his just share
what is to become of the schools, the
hospitals, the almshouses and oth^r
needed institutions? They depend for
existence on the payment by every one
of his share ot the taxes. Congress
man Maguire w has shown that while
he is anxious to take an active hand in
the management of the government he
is unwilling to contribute his just pro
portion of the costs of government. It
may be bis idea of single tax. but it is
not the idea of the majority of our citi
zens. That he forgot to attend to his
duty in the matter of paying his taxes
Is a matter that may be left to the
credulity of those who are now made
acquainted with the facts.

HISTORY OF THE
DREYFUS CASE
One of the Most Remarkable
Conspiracies That Has Ever
Been Brought to Light.
The news of Colonel Henry's sensational suicide, with its accom
paniment â the resignation of General Boisdeffre â will serve to recall
the celebrated Dreyfus case, which has now almost passed into his
tory.
Pome three years ago valuable papers were noticed to have dis
appeared frc/m the War Office in Paris. A system of espionage, es
sentinlly French, suggestive of the elaborate methods of Emile Ga
boriau or Sherlock Holmes, was set in motion, as a result of which
Captain Alfred Dreyfus a native of Alsace,, was placed under arrest.
Dreyfus was wealthy, and, apart from sundry affairs with women,
bore a good reputation. It was claimed that he sold Important docu
ments t< niching artillery modifications and fortifications to the Ger
man Embassy, and it was further stated that portions r-f missing
memoranda, with addenda in his handwriting, were discovered in a
waste-basket of the embassy.
General Boisdeffre was the man at whose instigation Dreyfus -was
arrested. The suspected captain was summoned to his presence in
October, 1894, but instead of meeting the general himself the supposed
traitor found himself closeted with Commandant Mercier Paty dv
Clam, who, under a pretense that he was suffering from a disabled
hand and was unable to write, dictated to Captain Dreyfus an ex
tract from the stolen document.
According to Tat'- dv Clam the effect upon Dreyfus was instan
taneous and such as to leave no doubt in the mind of the command
ant that the guilty man sat before him. He shuddered convulsively
and refused to take further dictation. He was immediately placed
under arrest. The sth of the following January Dreyfus was publicly
degraded in the Place Fontenoy. His military buttons were cut off,
sword snapped in two â this amid the shouts of an infuriated populace.
It is no exaggeration to state that had Dreyfus been accessible to the
mob his life \vould have paid the forfeit. As It was he was trans
ported to the Isle dv Diable, there to pass the remainder of his days,
caged and in exile.
All Paris rejoiced. Dreyfus was a Hebrew, and why not make him
a vicarious sacrifice? Was there not much to be atoned for? There
were the peculations of the Rouvier period, the commissary thefts of
the war of 1870, Reinach's shady transactions and the doings of the
Panama Canal clique â all attributed to Jews. Hence the Socialistic
press was loud in its satisfaction, and from Normandy to Nice arose
the shout: "A bas les Juifs!" (Down with the Jews).
But a change came. Many months after a man whose name in
France was regarded as the synonym of purity, and who was a mem
ber of the Academy and Vice-President of the Senate, M. Scheurer
Kestner, publicly asserted his belief in the innocence of Captain Drey
fus. In this belief he was supported by Clemenceau, editor of
L'Aurore, an intimate personal friend and great admirer. To these
two was added the name of Emile Zola, who, in an open letter to
L'Aurore, claimed not only that Dreyfus was the victim of a frightful
judicial error, but that the guilty party was to be found in a certain
Count Esterhazy.
A revision of l'affaire Dreyfus was demanded, without success.
Instead thereof Zola and Clemenceau were brought to trial and
sentenced to fine and imprisonment. Emulating the example of' his
literary progenitor, Voltaire, Zola fled to avoid his punishment, and is
at the time of writing in exile.
It is difficult within the scope of a few lines to estimate what the
effect of recent developments in Captain Dreyfus' case will be. Nor
1b it possible for the cool Anglo-Saxon brain t<- regard the matter
from the standpoint of the torrid Gaul. If Dreyfus was guilty his
punishment merited nothing short of death. But it is by no means
certain that he committed the act of treason attributed to him. The
mainspring of his action was lacking â a motive. He is connected
with the wealthiest families in Paris. Hence, is it likely that he
should have sold secret documents for financial reasons?
Whether the suicide of Colonel Henry and the resignation of a
high military official in the French War Department will lead to a re
vision of Dreyfus! casp remains to be seen, but from a knowledge of
"the ways that are dark" of French military tribunals it is to be
feared that the prisoner on the lonely Isle dv Diable will remain there
to expiate the crime of which he was convictedâ guilty possiblyâln
nocent probably.

REVISION OF DREYFUS
TRIAL A NECESSITY
Special dispatch to The Call and the New York J
Heral'l. cpyrlghted 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett,
PARIS, Aug. 31.â The Journal dee
Debats believes a revision of the Drey
fus trial an absolute necessity. Taken
separately, Colonel Henry's forgery
does not prove Dreyfus' Innocence.
"Still," says the Debats. "the fact
that one of the documents relating to |
the affair shows that forgery has been
committed, to prove after a trial that
the guilt of the condemned man is a J
matter of (--uch gravity that it must
necessarily provoke serious reflection
and call for a most minute examination
of other documents upon which the
case was built and of r>:oufs produced
openly or secretly in the trial."
The Journal, which is anti-Dreyfus,
says : The former officer's guilt was more
than ever proved during a scrutiny of
the evidence by the Minister of War.
wherein no forgery was discovered.
The Patrie makes, the stupefying de
claration that discovery of this forgery
is proof that other documents con
cerned in the case are genuine.
The Lantern says the man who pur
sued Piequart with the testimony
from the Assize Court to the Caoinet of
Judge d'lnstruction is a miserable
forger who has not hesitated at crime
in order to further some tortuous
scheme of the general staff.
The Petite Republique says: "The
confession of Forger He:\ry opens up a
denouement of the tragÂ«6y with which
France has been fighting for years in
darkneÃS."
The Rappel calls upon the Govern
ment to "at once place Dreyfus in a
position to justify himself before his
accusers," no matter what may come.
The Liberte, a strong anti-Dreyfus
organ, says: "It must cause the deep
est pain to all honorable men that offi
cers of such standing show such a lack
of moral sense."
The Temps this afternoon asserts that
the disclosures made to the Ministers
to-day have decided the Minister of
War to place Major Count Esterhazy
on the retired ltet.
STORMY SITTINGS
OF THE CABINET
PARIS, Aug. 31.â The Cabinet has
held two stormy sittings under the
presidency of M. Faure. It finally
arose between C and 7 o'clock, having
apparently failed to arrive at a deci
sion on the question of revising the
Dreyfus sentence, for the customary
official note was not issued.
It is possible, however, looking to the
excited state of public feeling, that the
Government deeme it advisable to pro
ceed cautiously and to conceal its de
cision for the present.
M. Delcasss, Minister for Foreign Af
fairs, is said to have been vehemently
attacked by his colleagues for having
been ignorant of the intention of Em
peror Nicholas to issue his disarma
ment proclamation, but in face of the
revival of the Dreyfus affair the dis
armament proposal has taken quite a
secondary place. It is alleged that sev
eral Ministers, including M. Brisson,
the Premier; M. Maruejouls, the Minis
ter of Commerce, and M. Tro,jilllot,
Minister of the Colonies, demanded a
revision and the immediate suppression
of several staff officers. Cavaignac,
however, remained firm, on the ground
that Henry's forgery had not altered
the case as affecting Dreyfus' guilt.
The only result thus far, therefore, is
that Esterhazy is cashiered and will
retire on a small pension.
Even after leaving the council the
Ministers continued to argue heatedly.
M. Faure has deferred his intended re
turn to Havre. It would be impossible
to describe the sensation that has
thrilled Paris, and it is not unlikely
that at the next meeting of the Cham
ber of Deputies the Government will be
defeated.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1898.
GENERAL BOYNTON
SATISFIED WITH
THE CONDITIONS
Reports on Affairs in the
Hospitals at Camp
Thomas.
Says " Ravings " of Patients Caused Sensational
Storiesâ Many Sick Soldiers Die En
Route.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â Secretary
Alger to-day received the report *bÂ£
General H. V. Boynton upon the state
of affairs in the hospitals at Camp
Thomas. The report is dated August
29. The general reports that he visited
all the hospitals in the camp without
giving notice of his purpose and adds:
Believing the death list of this camp
to afford an excellent standard by which
to measure its conditions as to health and
hospital service, a full report was ob
tained of all deaths in the camp and its
hospitals since its establishment in the
middle of April last. The result shows
a total death list of 198 up to the 22d of
this month, when the breaking up ot this
camp began. Betwet-n these dates, .In
cluding regulars and volunteers, fully
75.000 troops have been in camp in
Chickamuuga Park.
The report takes up in detail first the
two permanent hospitals, Leiter and
Sternberg, and then states with the
greatest minuteness the exact accom
modation afforded, by each. The first
is at Crawfish Springs, under charge
of Major Carter, and was converted
from a summer resort hotel into a hos
pital, receiving the worst typhoid cases
from the camp. Each patient has abun
dant room, woven wire and hair mat
tresses and abundant bedclothes. The
ventilation is perfect, plumbing en
tirely new and bathing facilities ample.
The* number of attendants, when all
are well, is entirely satisfactory, and
attendants are on the way to take the
places of those who are broken down.
Major Carter has secured a herd of
cows and has made arrangements for
pasturing them without expense to the
Government. He has sufficient money
from the hospital fund to buy what
ever is wanted in the way of milk, ice
and other delicacies. There has been
at this hospital full supplies of ice,
I milk, commissary stores and delicacies
such as the sick ought to have, and the
funds have enabled him to buy all that
i has been needed in the way of canned
and potted goods, soups, clam juice,
sage, malted milk, eggs, koumiss, jel
lies, preserves, relishes, ginger, oil,
apollinaris. champagne and claret. The
entire hospital Is furnished with dis
tilled water and toe ice used ia made
from distilled water.
Taking up the Sternberg Hospital, in
charge of Major Griffen, General Boyn
1 ton shows it is one of the most com
plete field hospitals ever seen, acoord
i ing to veterans of the last war. All the
tents are closely floored and they are
separate; at present only four men are
! in any. tent and in addition to the tents
I there are nine large board pavilions.
! Every tent and pavilion has woven
wire mattresses, iron bedsteads and
hair mattresses. There are special diet
cooks, five cold storage rooms for deli
cacies, separate refrigerators for each
row of tents and every proper measure
of sanitation is observed with respect
j to the sinks.
It is stated In addition that all the
; hospital refuse is burned In a crematory
i and, according to Major Griffen, all of
i the 200 patients now sick in the entire
! camp could be safely moved now. The
j diseases are more of a typho-malarlal
| character than of typhoid fever strictly,
! the death rate being very low, about 8
per cent of the worst cases.
The report states that in times when
the first division hospital under Major
Franke was crowded there was a lack
of nurses, the deficiency being supplied
by details from the regiments, which
were not as satisfactory as trained
nurses.
General Boynton shows that there is
a full refrigerator capacity for the hos-
I pital, porcelain-lined baths, sterilized
and iced water and every convenience.
In the malignant typhoid ward there
have been but two deaths out of thirty
cases in three weeks. He says that
both the medical officers and the hos
pital attendants at this hospital have
undoubtedly performed their duty with
energy and efficiency.
The next hospital inspection was the
Third Division Hospital, First Corps,
in charge of Major Thomas Clark.
Here the attendants were found suffi
cient, though in the earlier days there
were not enough surgeons or attend
ants. The grounds were in excellent
condition, the tonts clean, most of the
tents and all of the space between the
cots and aisles floored. For a time
the hospital was a week behind in ob
taining its medical supplies, but this
was before the Government had col
lected its medical stores in great quan
tities.
Taking up the last of the field hos
pitals, that of the Third Corps, Sec
ond Division, under Major Smith, the
report states that the fifty-three tents
are at present not all occupied, though
during the epidemic of measles they
were crowded. There were no Red
Cross rttirses and a detail of two la
dies from the Chattanooga association
has visited thp hospital daily to cook
the lighter food for the sick.
The report proceeds to treat the
whole subject of hospitals generally as
follows:
In two of the hospitals opportunities oc
curred for discoveries of what undoubt
edly originated many of the sensational
stories that have been printed over
the country to the effect that patient 3
in the hospitals lacked sufficient food and
in many cases had been on the verge of
starvation. In the wards where the con
valescent typhoid patients were lound
many of the men were constantly asking
for food, and as a matter of consequence
wore as constantly denied everything ex
cept the lighter forms of food which can
alone be safely administered to recover
ing typhoid patients. So far from be
lieving, as a result of my observations,
that medical officers have been heartless
or negligent. I believe that these officers
and the hospital attendants as a whole
have exerted themselves to discharge
their duties faithfully.
NUMBER OF DEATHS
AT CHICKAMAUGA
Of the 332 Men Who Expired in the
Hospital Typhoid Fever Caused
je'orty Per Cent.
CHICKAMAUGA, Ga.. Aug. 31.â A
list of the dead in the army at Chick
amauga from May 1 up to and includ
ing to-day numbers 332. This includes
the men who have died in the army
hospitals and in the hospitals and
private residences of the city. Of the
entire number probably 40 per cent
were from typhoid fever.
Five deaths were reported to-day.
Among them was Captain Ira Stowell,
Company M. First New Hampshire.

, NEW YORK, Aug. 31.â The transport
i Allegheny arrived at Montauk Point to
! day, having on board 500 men of the
! Ninth Massachusetts and the remainder
!of the First Illinois men, who sailed
! from Santiago on August 25. The hos
: pital accommodations are still unequal
I to the demands made upon them, and
last night 150 sick soldiers were obliged
to lie upon the bare floors instead of
being provided with cots.
A Brooklyn Eagle special from Mon
tauk Point says: The transports Alle
gheny and Panther arrived this morn
ing from Santiago. The Allegheny cast
anchor in the bay about 9 o'clock. She
left the sc-uth coast of Cuba August 24
and made a slow voyage. On board are
Companies A, B, C, D, E, F and H,
Ninth Massachusetts, in all 625, of
whom 145 are sick. Fourteen men died
on the voyage and all were buried at
sea. This is the largest number of
deaths at sea on any of the incoming
transports, and the deaths were mainly
in the cases of those who were critically
ill when placed aboard at Santiago. The
soldiers were in command of Captain
! Sullivan.
The Panther left two days later than
the Allegheny and got in shortly after
11 o'clock this morning, making a com
paratively fast trip. She carried 106
members of Companies I and M of the
Ninth Massachusetts and fifteen are on
the sick list. Private Daden of Com
pany ,M died and was buried at sea.
In explaining the fourteen deaths of
Massachusetts men while on the voy
age from Cuba the surgeons said that
the Allegheny brought all the seriously
sick of the regiment. Dr. Magruder
and inspecting officers say the Alle
gheny is a cattle ship not even fit for
well troops, much leas for sick sol
diers.
STARVATION AND
FEVER CAUSED DEATH
Lieutenant William Tiffany Not
Given Proper Food While Being
I Brought From Cuba.
NEW YORK, Aug. 31.â 1n connection
â with the general attack upon Secretary
Alger's management of the War De
partment the World has published a
dispatch from Boston, giving an ac
count of the death by starvation, as is
alleged, of Lieutenant William Tiffany.
Dr. F. M. Johnson, the attending
physician, says he was starved to
death. He 49! J to-nteht: "I stated
as the cause of death in the certificate
protracted fevers, due to war life In
Cuba, and starvation as far as the con
valescent stage goes. It was really
the result of different fevers â yellow,
intermittent and malarial â contracted
in Santiago, and starvation. I do not
mean to say that he did not have food,
but that he did not have food that was
suitable to the condition of a conva
lescent."
Lieutenant Tiffany's brother, Bel
mont, made only one statement to re
porters. It was: "My brother died
of starvation."
SUICIDE WHILE IN A

GOVERNMENT TROOPS
DEFEATED BY REBELS
Three Thousand Said to Have Been
Killed in Pitched Battles Dur-
ing the Last Ten Days.
LONDON, Sept. I.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai, dated Wednesday, says:
The Chmese Government troops, It is re
ported, have been defeated In two pitched
battles during the last ten days by the
Kwangsl rebels, losing 3000 men. The
rebels are saia to number 80,000 and the
provincial forces are against them.
A Governor of high rank has bf^n or
dered to lead his troops in person and
completely to suppress the rebellion with
in a month, under penalty of severe pun
ishment.
An imperial edict just issued strongly
censures the Governor of Kwangsl pro
vince for deceiving the Emperor in July
last by reporting that the rebellion had
been suppressed.
INSURGENTS BITTER
AGAINST AGUINALDO
Enraged Because the Chief Has Not
Been Able to Fulfill His
Promises.
MANILA, Aug. 31.â According to Span
ish advices, there is a strong feeling in
the provinces against Aguinaldo because
the insurgents' anticipations have not
been realized. They are said to have ex
hausted their funds, and the supplies ob
tained from the monasteries and to be un
able to obtain any relief from the insur
gent leader. It is added that Aguinaldo
is afraid to make his contemplated visit
to Bulacan owing to the fact that he is
unable to comply with the insurgent de
mands.
NO STAByATION ON THE TRAIL.
An Investigation Shows That Gold-
Seekers Have Plenty of Food.
OTTAWA, Ont.. Aug. 31.â A report was
published In many United States newspa
pers recently that some 3000 Americans
are starving on the Teslln trail between
Telegraph Creek and Teslin Lake. The
United States Government asked the Ca
nadian Government to investigate the
matter. This has been done and a report
received saying that only 1500 people alto
gether are on the trail and that they are
well supplied with provisions. There is,
therefore, no foundation for the report,
and the Washington Government will be
officially informed of this fact.
MUST FURNISH A
STUMPED RECEIPT
Express Company Can
not Dodge War Tax.
ATTORNEY GENERAL'SOPINION
GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DOES
NOT EXEMPT A CORPORATION.
"Taxes May Be Ruinous," Decides
Griggs, "but They for That
Reason Are Not Un
lawful."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Aug. 31.
Attorney General Griggs, in an opin
ion rendered to-day, holds that under
the war revenue act express companies
must furnish without extra charge a
stamped receipt for all packages trans
ported for the Government, and they
are not exempted from furnishing a
stamp by the plea that it would impair
the contract for carrying such pack
ages at a fixed price.
The case came up on the demurring
of the United States Express Company
to furnish stamps for the receipt
given for a package of money tendered
for transportation by an official of the
Government. This company holds an
exclusive contract with the Govern
ment to transport its money and se
curities, within certain territory, for a
fixed consideration.
The company contended that in
view of the fact that the amount of
its ..compensation for carrying each
shipment had been determined and
agreed upon in advance, tihe imposition
by the Government through an act of
Congress of a stamp tax upon each
shipment was in effect an impairment
to that extent of that contract, amount
ing to a violation of the contract obli-
gation of the Government, and, in fact,
an arbitrary and oppressive Â«ict under
the guise of taxation. It also contended
that money was not goods within the
intent of the law, but as this point has
already been decided in the affirmative
by the Attorney General it is not
treated in this opinion.
"But, ' continues the Attorney Gen
eral, "the provision of the Constitu
tion which forbids the passage of any
law impairing the obligation of a con
tract applies only to States; there is
no such prohibition expressly made in
relation to acts of Congress."
The Attorney General thus concludes
his voluminous opinion: "The pay
ment of taxes in any form is not sup
pose! to contribute to the profits, but
to swell the fi -ids of the Government.
Taxes may be ruinous, but they for
that reason are not unlawful. The
power to tax is power to destroy. As
long: as the contractor is uniformly
taxed with all others in the same line
of business upon the same transac
tions, and the tax is levied for appro
priate objects of taxation, he cannot
eornplain. merely because his compen
sation or the profits under his con
tract with the Government are there
by indirectly reduced. The contract
is not affected. The business of the
contractor is taxed and It is not ma
terial whether that business is with
private persons or with taxing the
Government itself. The United States
Express Company therefore, is not by
reason of its contract exempt from the
requirements of the war tax in the
transportation of money, securities,
etc., for the Government.
CONCERNED OVER
ARMY SCANDALS
President McKinley May
Soon Act.
HAS SHORTENED HIS VISIT
UPON HIS RETURN WILL DE
CLARE HIMSEL.F.
If There Is No Reaction in the Atti
tude of the Press and Public
the Executive Will Take
a Firm Stand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 31.â A special
from Cleveland to the World says:
"President McKinley is profoundly con
cerned over the army scandals. He has
the situation in hand and will act,
probably soon after his return to
Washington from his visit to Montauk
Camp, provided there has been no re
action in the attitude of the press and
public resulting from a belief that the
stories of abuses have been over
drawn."
This significant remark was made to
me to-day by a gentleman who has
seen and talked with the President and
his closest advisers here during the
visit of Mr. McKinley to Outlook,
Colonel Herrick's home in Euclid
Heights, a fashionable suburb of Cleve
land. Since his departure from Wash
ington the President has received ad
vic*s concerning this overshadowing
question which have caused him to
radically and several times alter his
plans.
It was his first intention to pass sev
eral days with his brother, Abner, in
Pennsylvania and a week here In
Cleveland, but the first stop was cut
down to one day and his visit here to
two.
To-morrow morning he will leave
for Canton where a stop of only a few
hours will be made and the Journey
to Montauk be resumed. The reason
for this is found in the remark quoted
at the beginning of this dispatch. The
President is profoundly concerned over
the army scandal and is moving with
all haste into a position where he can
declare himself in the matter.

WHY GREENE WAS
CALLED HOME
First of High Rank to Be
Mustered Out.
OWING TO A COURT-MARTIAL
EXCEEDED HIS AUTHORITY ON
THE TRANSPORT CHINA.
Proceeding's Against Five Privates
Who Were Tried and Convicted
Set Aside by the Judge
Advocate General.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Aug. 31.
Brigadier General Greene, who has
sailed from Manila bound for San
Francisco, under orders from the War
Department, will be the first officer of
such high rank to be mustered out of
the service.
While the War Department will not
make public the details of this order
it Is obvious that it has been brought
about by the court-martial convened by
General Greene aboard the steamer
China on her way to the Philippines.
In the opinion of the judge advocate
general, the command of General
Greene never ' having been designated
as a "separate brigade," he had no au
thority to convene a general court
martial. Five privates had been tried
by the court-martial on board the
China. The proceedings against them
are set aside by an order issued to-day.
New Yorkers, talking of General
Greene as a possible Republican candi
date for Governor of that State, are
sounding his praises as a most accom
plished scholar, a graduate of West
Point, and one who knows all alsout the
construction of "good roads." The ac
tion of the War Department in sum
marily mustering out General Greene
may debar these enthusiasts the pleas
ure of voting for General Greene for
Governor.
Orders have also been cabled to Ma
nila that General Babcock return to
San Francinco for duty as adjutant
general of the Department of Califor
nia, and that Major Simpson report at
Washington for duty In the adjutant
general's office.
The question of making an effort to
raise some of the ships sunk by Ad
miral Dewey's fleet in Afaniia Bay has
been before the Navy Department for
some time, but it is vehemently denied
by naval officials, as rumor had it, that
a St. Louis wrecking firm will get the
contract. Officials say the suggestion
is preposterous, and that should it be
deemed feasible to save some of the
Ei:ips bids therefor will be regularly re
ceived, with the chances that either a
San Francisco or Hongkong firm will
be awarded the contract owing to their
contiguity to the work.
TERRIFIC GALES ON
THE ATLANTIC COAST
Considerable Damage Done at At
lanta and Savannah and Is
lands in That Vicinity.
ATLANTA, Aug. 31.â The storm which
swept up the Atlantic coast last night has !
Interrupted communication near the !
ocean, and the extent of the damage is i
not yet known. The officials of the West
era Union Telegraph Company to-day say >
that communication with Savannah is
completely interrupted. The only places ,
reached by wire are Charleston, S. C, and '
Jacksonville, Fla. The telegraph com- |
pany has put on a force of extra men at I
Augusta, to which city all business for
Savannah is being sent. From there it
goes by train.
SAVANNAH, Aug. 31.â A heavy storm
is sweeping along the coast. The wind
at Savannah has been blowing a gale '<
since 6 o'clock last night, reaching a ye- '
locity of about sixty miles an hour at 3
a. m. Telephone connection with Tybes
Island is cut off, and nothing has been i
heard from there since early in the night.
There is much fear for the shipping there
and at quarantine. The low lands are j
flooded, and heavy damage to rice and '<
cotton will result. Railroad tracks aro j
washed out and the trains on. all roads i
are delayed.
At 4 o'clock this morning the wind j
reached a velocity of seventy-five miles |
an hour and rain poured in torrents. The
Btreets are filled with debris. The last re- j
port from Tybee, early last night, was j
that the wind was blowing seventy miles
an hour and the operator in the signal j
station was just leaving for the light
house for safety. The quarantine Btatlon
is believed to have been abandoned before
the escape of the occupants was cut off.
MYSTERIOUS SINKING
OF A HOSPITAL SHIP
FERNANDINA, Fla., Aug. 31.â The
hospital ship Olivette, which has been ly
ing near the Quarantine Station, through
some mysterious agency sank this morn
ing about 7:30 o'clock. Aboard of the
ship was the hospital corps of thirty-five
men and a crew of forty-five persons, all
of whom escaped without injury, but in
scanty attire.
The Olivette went down in about thirty
feet of water, her main deck being sub
merged.
No one apparently knows how the
calamity could have occurred, and as no
investigation has yet been made the mat
ter remains a mystery.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â 1t is stated
at the War Department that the sinking
of the Olivette was not the fault of the
United States officers. The steamship
company owning the vessel has already
offered to raise her. An explanation has
been asked for from the officer in charge
of the Olivette.

There has been considerable marauding
of late in the suburbs of Manila. Five
cases of abduction are already reported.
The English flour mills in the immedi

On this day, so important to you and

the splendid though weighty task where
to I have been called, and I feel myself
supported by your fidelity. Receive my

j to whom I am immensely indebted, set me
lan example by her noble and exalted
conception of the duties which henceforth
I devolve upon me. The aim of my life
will be to follow her example and to gov
ern in the manner expected of a Princess
of the House of Orange. True to the
constitution I desire to strengthen thd
respect for the name and flag of the
Netherlands. As to my sovereign pos
sessions and colonies, east and west, I
desire to observe Justice and to contribute
so far as In me lies to the increasing In
tellectual and mutual welfare of my
whole people. I hope and expect that the
support of all, in whatever sphere of of
ficial or social activity you may be placed
within or without the kingdom, will
never be wanting. Trusting in God, and
with a prayer that he give me strength, I
accept the Government.

INSISTS ON REPRESENTATION
DEMANDS SEVERAL PLACES ON
THE TICKET.
Lively Fight May Kssult When the
County Convention Meets
at San Jcse on
Friday.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 31.â "Jim" Rea is
making an effort to capture the Dem
ocratic County Convention, which will
meet at Turn Verein Hall on Friday.
All-night sessions are held nightly at
the California Club to devise ways and
means to make this coup. This is the
first time the "boss" has nut had a
hand in the Democratic County Con
vention, and the rebuff is not gracious
ly received. Besides, Rea and the
Mackenzies want to show the people
of San Jose they are still alive after
Rea's defeat at Sacramento, and the
"dressing down" he received from
Major McLaughlln.
The meetings at the California Club
have been lively enes. This organiza
tion is the rendezvous of all of Rea's
political schemers. The gang com
prises its entire membership, and the
first duty of a youngster is to join the
California Club. The Democratic con
vention is the sole topic there now.
Rea wants several places on the
ticket, but above all demands Vie
Scheller fur Superior Judge. ScÃeiler
is a prominent member of the Califor
nia Club, while Kittredue. his oppon
ent, has refused to have anything to
do with the ring. Rea has openly
boasted that the Democratic conven
tion must nominate Soheller for Judge.
The better class of delegates is for Kit
tredge and wants no man with a taint
of Rt-aism in his make-up. Rea is
also trying to force the Democrats to
name some one other than L. T. Chip
man (anti-gang Republican) for Coun
ty Superintendent of Schools.
Old-time Democrats say the conven
tion on Friday will be the most repre
sentative one held here by the Demo
crats in many years. They claim it is
almost solidly anti-Rea, and that the
ticket nominated will be a sure win
ner.
"Hoss" Rea Is. endeavoring to take a
hand In the shaping of a ticket by se
curing proxies of delegates. ' Police
Commissioner "Billy" Carmichael and
a few- more of the boss' henchmen have
already obtained proxies. Orders hayÂ«Â»
gone forth to get all of them possible,
and, if necessary, . to buy them. In this
way the boss hopes to have a repre
sentation, biit he â will not have
strength enough to demand recogni
tion..
Nicholas Bowden will be made chair
man of the convention,. which will be
composed of 220 delegates. The plat
form promises to be a warm one. The
pending- high- school trouble and Rea's
meddling in school affairs will be
touched upon. The Btudents will be
praised for the stand taken by them,
and the City Board of. Education cen
sured for having caused the trouble.
Freedom of the public schools from
politics will be demanded. Legislative
delegates will be pledged to the enact
ment 'of a primary election law that
will do away -with such frauds as were
perpetrated at the primaries here.
The nominees of the convention prob
ably will be selected from the follow
ing aspirants:
Superior Judge, A. R. Kittredge.

Clerk, H. A. Pfister.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1898.
MORSE BROTHERS
DECLINE TO ACT
Not Willing to Cause
Arrests.
CITIZENS NOW WILL MOVE
DETEBMINED TO AVENGE AGED
MBS. MOUSE.
Her Sons Having Refused to Form
ally Accuse the Suspects, the
Townspeople Will Appeal
to Governor Budd.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POINT ARENA, Aug. 31.â The mur
der of aged Mrs. Morse is to go un
avenged so far as her relations are
concerned. For want of evidence the
sons of the dead woman have decided
not to cause the arrest of suspected
persons. The detective who has been
here for some time vainly striving to
complete the chain of circumstantial
evidence will leave to-morrow for San
Francisco. He has made a lengthy re
port to the Morse brothers, and, while
he does not state positively who in his
opinion committed the crime, recom
mends that suspected persons be placed
under strict surveillance.
Now that the Investigation has been
abandoned leading residents of this
town intend to take the case Into their
own hands and endeavor to land the
criminals in jail. In a few days a com
mittee will be appointed to wait on
Governor Budd and request him to of
fer a reward for the apprehension of
the persons who were instrumental in
causing the death of Mrs. Morse. After
this is done the same committee will
appear before the Supervisors of this
county and ask them to add $500 to the
reward offered by the- State.
"We do not intend to brook any fool
ishness," remarked one of the leading
spirits in the movement to-day. "Jus
tice has been outraged and we demand
immediate reparation. The evidence
thus far obtained seems to me to be
sufficient to cause the arrest of the
parties under suspicion. It has been
apparent to me since the investigation
was begun that there was a determined
attempt on the part of some of the rel
atives of the murdered woman to shield
the guilty parties. Had we taken hold
of the case instead of relying on those
who are directly Interested the crim
inals would now be in jail awaiting
trial for the horrible murder."
Both of the Morse brothers will
shortly sell their interests here and go
to San Francisco, where they intend to
locate.
"We have done everything in our
power to locate the murderer or mur
derers of mother," remarked Le Grand
Morse this evening, "but our efforts
have gone for naught. It Is true that
we have found bits of circumstantial
evidence, but not enough to warrant
\is to cause the arrest of the suspected
parties. I am bitterly opposed to hav
ing any one arrested or. such a serious
charge unless the proof is positive. As
the evidence is wholly lacking in this
case I have decided not to proceed
criminally against the suspected par
ties, but hope that some day they wi'l
be made to suffer for the foul murder
of my dear mother."
ELOPEMENT ENDS
IN A PRISON CELL
Fifteen-Year-Old Los Angeles Girl
Arrested by San Jose
Police.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 31,â Ella Hoffman, a
fifteen-year-old girl, is being held here at
the police station pending the arrival of
ncr mother from I-os Angeles. The story
In connection with the girl's arrest Is a
romantic one. Until a couple of months
ago she was an obedient daughter and
resided with her widowed mother, Mrs.
Alice Hoffman, a dressmaker at 139 North
Qlive street, Los Angeles. About that
time she became acquainted with Charles
Murdock, a young hack driver. The young
people fell in love with each other, and
when, a month ago, Murdork told the girl
he was coming north to live in San Jose
she said she would come, too. Plans for
an elopement were marie, but Mrs. Hoff
man learned of and' frustrated them.
Murdock, who is just of age, finally
started for San Jose in a buggy- The
parting with the girl was a sad one. in the
presence of the girl's mother, who .was
led to believe the yuung couple had part
ed for good. But the lovers had re
arranped their plans. Murdock was to
start alone in the buggy, and the girl was
to join him at Ventura. Consequently in
a day or two Ella Bold a gold ring she had
and "bought a ticket for Ventura. There
she joined Murdock, and the two traveled
by team to this city. Mater Hoffman sur
mised that- her daughter was up this way
and telegraphed to have her arrested.
Murdock and the girl engaged lodgings
at the St. Charles Hotel on their arrival,
and there the police found them. The
girl's mother is expected to arrive from
Los Angeles in a day or two to take her
home.
lÂ£lla Hoffman is small for her age, and
does not look to be over 13 years of age.
She is bright and rather good looking.
The girl is deeply infatuated with Mur-
I dock, and even behind prison bars is Bet
In nor determination to marry her lover.
Murdock is now employed in an orchard
| near here. He has not called to see her
since the arrest.

School Principal Rails at
San Joseans.
HIS REPLY TO ACCUSATIONS
SAYS TH73 CITY IS FILLED WITH
PREVARICATORS.
Despite "Boss" Rea and His Under
lings, the Strike of the Stu
dents Continues to
Spread.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 31. â The High
School strike continues to absorb at
tention, and means of aiding the stu
dents in their fight are being discussed
by the people. No steps have been
taken yet, but it is asserted some of
the organizations of the city. will inter
est themselves in the crusade against
bossism in the public schools.
The strikers are pleased with the
Santa Clara school. The students now
go back and forth on the street cars.
So far about 120 pupils from this city
are enrolled there, and indications are
that the number will go above 150 as
soon as the fruit season is over.
At the San Jose High School . 213
pupils were present this morning by
actual count. Last term there were
341. Of the number now attending
ninety-six are new pupils, so in reality
there are only 117 old pupils. The gradu
ating class last year numbered about 40,
which would le^e about 300 pupils still
enrolled in the \chool. There should
have been ah Increased number of
scholars this year, making an attend
ance of nearly 400. As only 117 of last
year's pupils returned it shows that
fully 200 boys and girls have been
driven from the High School by the
disreputable tactics of Rea and the
Board of Education. The same students
that struck against the dismissal of
Professor Smith were instrumental in
securing the new $75,000 high school for
San Jose. Had it not been for their
work at the polls the bond issue would
have been defeated.
The teachers at the High School are
chafing under the criticism they are
receiving. This is especially true of
Principal Shumate. His uncouth man
ner and rowdy talk are more manifest
than ever and tend to bear out what
the students have already said of him.
When told to-day that it was talked
about on the streets that the register
of the school had been stuffed he de
nounced the people making the state
ments as "d d liars.' He also said,.
"San Jose is the greatest place for tell
ing lies on earth," and intimated that
if the man who started the report came
to him he would punch his head.
"Boss" Rea and the faculty of the
school are considering the proposition
to establish a weekly high school pa
per in order to enable them to state
their side of the case and incidentally
to aid in bringing the enrollment of the
institution up to what it should be.
Santc Clara College has offered the
usÂ« of its gymnasium to the pupils of
the Santa Clara High School. The
gymnasium at the latter place was
turned into a physical and chemical
laboratory to accommodate the new
pupils.
MADE A MANIAC
BY LOSS OF GOLD
Sad Result of the Recent Robbery
Aboard the Treasure Ship
Roanoke. .
SEATTLE,. Aug. 31.â A pathetic result
of the recent robbery on board the steam
er Roanoke is- the affliction of one ofl the
victims, Dr. E. F. Adams. He rcpro
â sented a Chicago syndicate In the Klon
dike and was returning with $800, mostly
in greenbacks. Since arriving here Adams
has assumed steadily increasing symp
toms of violent insanity. Last night he
raved considerably about his loss and to
day was taken to the Seattle General
Hospital. He soon became a raving
maniac and the physicians fear his rea
son is gone beyond recovery.
In his mutterings he bewails , the loss of
his money and talks of having commit
ted some awful crime. He repeatedly
calls upon God to relieve him from the
terrible pangs of conscience.
Adams registers from Now 'York, and
since March 16 has been twice into the

FATAL WRECK ON
THE SHASTA ROUTE
Freight Train Ditched
Near Redding.
FIREMAN SMITH PERISHES
ENGINEER HANSON BELIEVED
TO BE DYING.
, Accident Due to the System of Rigid
Economy Practiced by the
Southern Pacific
Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Aug. 31.â The worst
wreck of a series of six bad smash-ups
on tlje Shasta division of the Southern
Pacific Company occurred at 11:20
o'clock to-day at the Blue cut, about
sixty miles north of this city.
A special through freight from Port
land, known as "the cannon-ball spec
ial," was making the usual time down
Sacramento Canyon when the engine
left the rails at a curve and plunged
down the embankment into the river.
Fireman Smith, a resident of Sacra
mento, was instantly killed. Engineer
George Hanson, also of Sacramento,
was so badly injured that it is believed
he cannot survive. The train was in
charge of Conductor Terrill of Sacra
mento. He and the rest of the crew
escaped injury. â â -^
The place where the accident oc
curred is near the mouth of a tunnel
between Sims station and Chromite
siding. It has not heretofore been re
garded as a dangerous point, and rail
road men are at a loss to account for
the accident, except by the spreading
of the rails.
Besides the engine seven loaded
freight cars left the rails, two of them
plunging over the embankment and
crashing in on top of the wrecked loco
motive. Wrecking crews from Duns
muir are now at work clearing the
debris, but traffic will be delayed some
time.
Coroner Earnest left for the scene of
the wreck on a special north bound
freight late this afternoon. An inquest
wlll.be held on the remains of the dead
fireman, and the wounded engineer will
be taken to the railroad hospital at
once if he can stand the journey.
This makes the sixth or seventh
smash-up on the Shasta route between
this city and Dunsmuir in the last few
months, and each wreck was due to the
system' of rigid economy practiced by
the company. The route through Sac
ramento Canyon is a series of curves.
In repairing the track it is the custom
to change the rails from one side to
the other and to turn the cross ties bot
tom side up, using them as long as they
will hold a spike. When the heavy en
gine with a loaded train strikes a curve
there is a terrible strain on the ties,
and if there is a weak spot the engine
leaves the track, the train piling up be
hind.

The following, from the ground upon
which many notable contests will take
place during the next four weeks, will be
of interest to those having a fondness for
contests between game racers of the gal
loping persuasion:

Henry T. Gage, he deemed it prudent
and in line with party custom to in
vite the Judgment and counsel of lead
ing men of his own political faith in
making up the list. It is not wide of
the mark to say that Mr. Gage has
listened to a thousand suggestions, in
reference to the performance of this
duty since the adjournment of the
convention. Expecting to leave here ,
to-morrow for his homo In Los Ange- :
les hÂ» deemed it advisable to finish the j
work In hand before his departure
from this city. The closing confer
ences were held yesterday. At a
prolonged session of party repre
sentatives in the afternoon the
names submitted were considered
at length and a final selec
tion was made. The afternoon confer
ence was attended by many of the
party leaders.
It was the earnest desire of all those
participating, and particularly the wish \
of the nominee for Governor, that the j
executive committee should represent j
the agricultural, commercial, manufac
turing, mining and other ln
dastrtal interests of the State,
and that the men representing
these interests should be widely
known for their own worth of charac
ter as individuals. Opinions as to
the merit of men were expressed with
freedom at the conference, and while
there was much speaking to the point
no personal animosities were provoked, j
When the selection was finally made
the utmost harmony marked the con- â 
elusion of the work.
In due time the newly created execu
tive committee will be assembled for
organization and the creation of sub
committees.
At an early day a time may be desig
nated for -a meeting of all the candi
dates on the Republican ticket, and
also a time and place for a general
meeting of the entire State committee.
The first work in order is to notify the
men selected yesterday of their ap
pointment and request their immediate
acceptance.
The sentiment was freely expressed
last night by leading Republicans who
were apprised of the appointments that
the men named for the executive com
mittee were citizens of unquestioned
ability and integrity, and progressive
Californians, whose efforts to promote
the prosperity of the commonwealth
had long been recognized.
Henry T. Gage and Major Frank Mc-
Laughlln will talk over incidental topics
to-day. Each of the twenty-one Re
publicans appointed will be notified
this forenoon. The letter of notification
will be signed by Mr. Gage.

THE CLAN GALLAGHER ON GUARD.
IN SEARCH OF
A CANDIDATE
Democratsand Populists
in a Bad Predicament.
DITTMAR REFUSES TO RUN
NOMINEE FOR CONGRESS IN THE
FIRST DISTRICT QUITS.
Position Belongs to the People's
Party, but They Will Probably
Surrender It to the
Maguires.
. â¢â  . â  .
M. E. Dittmar of .Redding has decided
that It is Inexpedient tp make the fight
for Congress In the First District, and
now the allied Popocrat-Demullst forces
are casting about for another champion
to enter the lists against John A. Bar
ham, Republican..
Under the terms of the fusion agree
ment, the First Congressional District
fell to the Populists and those delegates
met during the Populist State convention
at Sacramento, and organized by the
election of John W. Keegan of Santa
Rosa, as chairman, but adjourned to meet
at the call of the chair, without making
any nomination.
When the Democratic convention met,
however, the delegates from the First
Congressional District, on the recom
mendation of the Populists, nominated
M. E. Dittmar the editor of a Populist
paper at Redding, with the understand
ing that he would be indorsed by the
Populists. Keegaji called a meeting of
the Populist convention of the First Dis
trict, yesterday, at 915% Market street, at
which the following letter from Dittmar,
declining the nomination, was presented:
REDDING, Cal., August 28, 1898.
To the People's Party State Executive Com
mlttee^-Oentlemen: The action of the People's
l'arty convention of Shasta County In declin
ing to accept a union with the Democrats of
the county, pieces me In a position where, In
order to occupy a course of consistency, I must
decline to accept the union nomination for
Tongress In the First Congressional District. 1
am Impelled to do this because I cannot oppose
Democrats In local affairs and expect their
support, nor can I oppose the action of the
People's Party In Shasta County and expect the
support of that organization.
while withdrawing my name for the con
sideration of voters In the First District, I
wish to assure your body that I shall not with
draw my support from the full union ticket
as It has been nominated by the several parties
who are allied against the encroachments of
plutocracy and the monopolistic tendencies of
the &ge. I shall support the Hon. James O.
Magrulre for Governor of the State by both
voice and pen, and hereby tender my services
to the union campaign committee to advocate
the cause of the allied forces before the people
of the State In the present campaign. Yours
very respectfully, M. E. DITTMAR.
There was also a letter to the Demo
cratic committee from Dittmar, declining
their nomination, hut offering to make
twenty speeches during the campaign in
the First District in support of the fusion
ticket. On receiving Dlttmar's letter of
withdrawal the Populists adjourned again
to meet September 10, when it is ex
pected they will nominate a straight-out
Democrat, thereby surrendering their
right to name one of their own people.
Their reason for this is that they fancy a
strong Democrat who can draw the full
vote of the allied parties can defeat Bar
ham, and they are willing to sink their
Identity still deeper in the Democratic
Quagmire.
Dlttmar'B letter of withdrawal discloses
the fact that all is not peace and har
mony in the Domulist-Popocrat camp.
The Populists of Shasta are opposed, to
the fusion proposition and will stand by
their own Idol, Shanahan, and the mid
dle-of-the-road ticket, to a man. They
have refused to fuse with the Democrats
on the county ticket *and Dittmar, by re
maining in the race for Congress, would
have been obliged to renounce all claim
to Popullstic proclivities and rely entire
ly on the Democrats for support, or else
fight the Democratic county ticket and
at the same time ask the Democrats to
fall In behind him. He chose the only
alternative and stepped out of the flght
entirely.

ulent Certificates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 31.
The Populist County Central Committee
met to-night In Judge Cliffs courtroom
and formulated a call for their coming
county convention. The date was left
blank, as the committee appointed to
confer with the Democratic County Cen
tral Committee had not been heard from
and as the fixing of the date at this time
might interfere with the fusion of the two
parties. The call provides for primaries
or mass conventions to be held not later
than September 20, at which time dele
gates to the county convention shall be
elected, apportioned one for every forty
votes cast in each Assembly district for
John V. Webster for Governor in 1894.
This gives the Forty-sixth Assembly Dis
trict 12 delegates, Forty-seventh 21 dele
gates. Forty-eighth 14 delegates and the
Forty-ninth, Fiftieth and Fifty-first each
21 delegates. The Forty-sixth, Forty-sev
enth, Forty-eighth and Fiftieth will hold
mass conventions in various places in the
respective districts. As to the Forty
ninth Assembly District, the voters of
West Oakland precincts will meet at Han
son's Hall, Bb7 Wood street, while those of
the old Seventh Precinct of Berkeley,
Golden Gate, Bay and Lorln will meet at
the latter place.
In the Fifty-first, Precincts 1, 2, 3, 4 and
6 of East Berkeley will be accommodated
at various places; Peralta, Claremont,
Piedmont and Temescal will meet at Paz
zola Hall, Temescal. The East Oakland
wards will meet at Dr. Childs' office, 631
East Twelfth street. Voters at these pri
maries must be signed members of some
People's party club; must affirm their al
legiance to the party platform as enun
ciatedv at St. Louis in July, 1896, as well
as the Sacramento platform, and support
the State ticket headed by Maguire for
Governor and Hutchinson for Lieutenant
Governor. The county central committee
men are delegated as judges of the pri
mary election in their respective districts
and must be satisfied as to the qualifi
cations of voters. Burdett Cornell re
signed as secretary of the County Cen
tral Committee and Charles Panpburn
was elected In his stead, with J. W. Dut
ton as assistant. Chairman F. J. Gregory
presided.
A ripple of excitement was caused
among the politicians to-night by a state
ment published in an evening paper that
District Attorney Snook had decided to
withdraw from the contest for State
Senator in favor of Assemblyman Frank
M. Leavltt. It was also stated that Mr.
Snook would be a candidate to succeed
himself.
Mr. Snook was seen by a Call represen
tative to-night.
He Bald: "There Is not a particle of
foundHtion for such a statement. I have
not changed my political course and am
at a loss to understand how such a story
could have found its way into print."
County Clerk Jordan has replied at some

documents, to the signature of Mr. J. B. Dean,

YOUNGBERG TO
STAY OUTSIDE
Excluded From the Rev
enue Office.
ORDERED FROM WASHINGTON
HIS CONNECTION WITH THE
WELBURN CASE.
The Secretary of the Treasury
Thinks That the Office Will
Be Better Without the
Captain.
Collector of the Port Jackson and Inter
nal Revenue Collector Lynch were noti
fied yesterday oy a telegram from the
Secretary of the Treasury at Washington
that the department would not allow
Customs Broker John E. Youngberg to
continue the pursuit of his calling on the
floor of the Custom House or In the In
ternal Revenue office. The officials were
Instructed to communicate this order at
once to Mr. Youngberg and to see that It
was carried out.
Mr. Youngberg received the notice with
his usual calmness of. mien, and an
nounced his willingness to bow to the In
evitable, but stated his Intention of Imme
diately protesting against the action of
the Secretary of the Treasury by an ap
peal to that official himself. He did not
propose to be deprived of his means of
livelihood without a hearing from his own
side of the case.
Both Collector Jackson and Collector
Lynch refused to discuss the matter.
They would not admit to newspaper re
porters that any order of that kind had
been received, and professed to be in the
most seraphic state of Ignorance respect
ing Captain Youngberg and the charges
that had been tiled against him, and upon
which the order of banishment had been
founded. As actors, expert in the con
cealment of the emotions of the human
mind, they have no equals on the stage.
But Captain Youngberg did not hesitate
for a moment to admit the fact of his ex
clusion from the Internal Revenue office
by an order from Washington directed to
Collector Lynch. It had been unexpected,
and he did not intend to let the matter
drop without a struggle for reinstate
ment, and with this end In view he would
at once draw up an appeal. Beyond this
he refused to speak on the matter. It
would be neither proper on his part nor
courteous to the Secretary of the Treas
ury to discuss or to criticize In the public
prints the action of that official.
It Is known, however, that Captain
Youngberg's expulsion or exclusion
from the office of the Collec
tor of Internal Revenue Is due
to his connection with ex-Collector
Welburn, now a fugitive from justice.
Youngberg was a close friend of Wel
burn and had the run of the office In
which he did considerable business for
Chinese and other clients, in connection
with registration certificates and in com
promising with the Government for vio
lations of the revenue laws on behalf of
his clients. Youngberg stood by his
friend Welburn through all the vicissi
tudes of that reckless man. It was sim
ply paying back the debt of gratitude
which Youngberg owed to the disgraced
Collector. But the officers of the Gov
ernment who had been set on the trail
of the defaulting official felt that Young
berg was in their way and in the way
of the Government in convicting Wel
burn on the triaJ, and charges not yet
made public were presented to the Secre
tary of the Treasury against Youngberg.
Whether those charges were for aiding
and abetting Welburn or for more seri
ous breaches of the internal revenue reg
ulations was n<Â»ver made known.
The fight between the honest officers of
the Government and the. friends of the
disgraced Collector became so bitter that
efforts were made by those friends to
have certain special agents removed from
this Jurisdiction, where they were mak
ing things decidedly hot for him. These
efforts, however, were abortive, and Wel
burn was obliged to leave the State se
cretly in order to escape further prose
cution for his crimes.
There is no doubt that the Welburn
matter had all to do with the exile of
Youngberg, for the telegram sent from
Washington yesterday states explicitly
that Captain Youngberg"s alleged knowl
edge of the fact that Welburn had doc
tored his pay roll, had made htm persona
non grata with the department, probably
because he had not effectively, assisted
the Government officers In procuring the
conviction of Welburn.
It Is not expected that the contem
plated appeal will change the minds of
the powers at Washington, unless the
captain Incorporates In It some Informa
tion that he had not given before that
might change the aspect of the present
conditions.

DUNNING'S SORRY PLIGHT.
ONE of the melancholy figures of the Dunning
tragedy is the man Dunning himself. It is his
province now to be silent unless he has testi
mony such as is vital to the determination of guilt.
There is no call for surmises from him. He is in a
light too unenviable, and his character has been too
openly portrayed to warrant the attaching of much
weight to anything he may say.
There was never a breath against Mrs. Dunning.
Her greatest misfortune was that she was bound to a
man who had no regard for the sacred obligations
he assumed when he took her from her home to share
his lot. He fell into evil associations and evil ways.
He betrayed the wife who had trusted him, and he
proved untrue to business obligations. The money
he should have turned in to his employers had been
squandered on the races, on fast living, on women
who had no right to his devotion who, when they
received attention from him were robbing the wife,
whom, it may be, one among them murdered.;
Whatever may be the truth about the taking off of
Mrs. Dunning, the widower is not in a position either
to excite sympathy or to demand respect for any
assertion he may make. If he condemn any of his
former comrades he must share in the condemnation.
There could have been no object in removing the wife
save that she might no longer stand between Dunning
and the sender of the fatal poison. It is natural to
suppose that the dreadful act would never have been
perpetrated except with some encouragement, how
ever indirect, from Dunning.
Therefore will his words have little weight and his
accusations be regarded as designed rather to shield
: the guilty than to declare the truth.
GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF RAIL
WAYS.
IN our editorial yesterday on Government owner
ship of railways, by an inadvertence dollars were
used instead of cents in comparing the average
rates per ton and per passenger per mile on European
and American railways.
The statement in correct form is as follows:
Passenger, Freight,
per mile. ton per mile.
United States 2.14 cents .97 cents
Prussia 2.99 cents 1.32 cents
Austria ...3.05 cents 1.56 cents
France 3.30 cents 1.59 cents
Belgium 2.25 cents 1.39 cents
England 2.20 cents 1.95 cents
SOME RAILWAY STATISTICS.
CALIFORNIA led the Union in the construc
tion of railways in the year ending June 30,
1897, and may be said to have distanced most
of her sister States. According to statistics just is
sued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, there
were constructed in this State during that fiscal year
210 miles of railway, in Arkansas 192 miles, in Loui
siana 161 miles, in Michigan 123 miles, and in Ala
bama 117 miles. In no other State or Territory did
the construction of new railways amount to as much
as 100 miles. '.;â â¢â â¢''â  â â â 'â '.â  'â ?â¢''..''â â¢â  :.'.:'"â â â â  :'â  ;â¢â¢.â¢â¢-
Taking the country as a whole the increase in lines
of railways reached a littlfe over 1652 miles, making
the total railway mileage. in the United States at the
close of the fiscal year 184,428 miles. Despite the b|r
crease in the extent of the roads it is noted that the
gross earnings for the year were actually less than in
the previous one by $28,079,603, the amount â being
$1, 122.089,773- :/-;â ;â¢ â ,;â¢â . â ,â â ...;â .â¢â¢-. â â â¢=â . â â¢ â  â â â¢ .â â â¢.â  \:
Some progress has been made toward the equip
ment of the roads with improved safety appliances
The report says: "Including in the term equipment
both locomotives and cars, it is found that the total
equipment of railways on June 30. 1897, was 1,333,
466; and of this total number 525,286 were fitted
with train brakes, the increase being 76.432; and 678,
725 were fitted with automatic couplers, the increase
in this case being 133.142" This degree of progress,
while good in itself, can hardly be called satisfactory [
for it is now full time that all our railway equipments
should include the best and most improved safety
br&kcs and couplers.
The railway accidents of the year resulted in the
dcntli of 6437 persons, of whom 1693 were railway
employes; and the injury of 36,731 persons, of whom
27,667 were employes of the roads. Among the
trainmen of the roads one out of every 165 was killed
and one out of every twelve was injured. That
record is in itself a sufficient condemnation of the
present method of equipping and running trains. We
have a just reason to be proud of our railway system in
many respects, but a ratio of casualties amounting to
one trninman injured for every twelve employed dur
ing a single year is so high that the need of better
methods Is clearly imperative.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1898.
BOLTER MAGUIRE.
IF the rank and file of a party take to themselves
the privileges claimed and exercised by Judge
Maguire for nearly twenty years there would be
no such thing as party cohesion or responsibility.
Beginning his public career as a Republican place
holder in the City Hall, in 1879 he joined the sand
lotters and aided in wrecking the Democratic party.
Just now his supporters are in full cry against the
Harney Democracy because it insists upon giving the
people a voice in party management. Maguire is
now pulling the string to his centicephalic jumping
jack, the committee of one hundred. When he was
sandlotting he was opposed to committees entirely.
He indorsed that celebrated dictum of his leader,
Denis Kearney, who began his speech against the
Democratic County Committee by saying: "Citi
zens! How was Rome ruled? Was it by a county
committay?"
In 1880 the Judge was a grcenbacker. In 1884 he
was one of those instrumental in the defeat of Has
tings, the Democratic candidate for Congress in the
Fourth District.
In 1886 he organized and managed a "labor party"
in San Francisco, in partnership with that laborious
idler, Carl B r owne, which beat the Democracy and
elected a Republican County Clerk. At the same
election he and Barry put up an independent candi
date again in the Fourth District and beat the regular
Democrat, McCoppin, who was one. of the best
Mayors the city ever had, and who would have been
a Congressman to be proud of. In 1888 Maguire
supported a non-partisan ticket in this city to defeat
the regular Democracy. His Non- Partisan party in
dorsed the Republican candidate for Congress
in the Fourth District and thereby beat Judge
Robert Ferral, the regular Democratic candidate.
By his bolt that year he elected a Republican Sheriff,
Clerk, Recorder and Tax Collector.
He dodged in and out of the Democratic party
at will. In 1887 he published his celebrated letter
permanently withdrawing from Democracy, State
and national, giving as his reason that it did not in
dorse the confiscation of land in private ownership.
He now takes the position that he is the only
honest man in the Democratic party and that it can
not be trusted to hold a primary in San Francisco.
His committee of one hundred appointed a delega
tion to make his nomination sure. When the Har
ney delegation, elected at an open primary, fell at
his feet and wanted the one word from him that
would have admitted it to the State convention he
put his heel on its neck and refused to enfranchise
it, though it humbly promised its support to his can
didacy.
Having chased every political rainbow that has
been seen in the last twenty years, having been by
turns a greenbacker, a gold standard man, free sil
verite, and now an advocate of "a more and fittener
currency," according to the Populist idea, his hope
of an* election must be in the party which he bolted
and defeated year after year, and in the voters whose
opinions he has held and abandoned.
AMENDMENT NUMBER SEVEN.
AMONG the constitutional amendments which
will be submitted to the people at the election
in November there is one which should be
given cartful consideration. We refer to No. 7,
whkh provides for splitting sessions of the Legisla
ture into two parts and assigning to each part a dif
ferent round of duties. The amendment referred to
proposes first to authorize a session of twenty-five
days for the purpose of introducing bills and dispos
ing of committee work. This session is to be fol
lowed by a recess of not less than thirty days, nor
more than sixty, at the end of which the members are
to again assemble and sit for fifty days. No bills are
to be introduced at the second session except with
the consent of three-fourths of the members of the
House in which offered.
It is urged in favor of this amendment that it would
reduce the hurry and rush of the present sessions,
and by giving the members thirty days or more in
which to consider bills, and the public the same time
in which to read them, a great deal of jobbery which
now prevails at Sacramento every two years would
be prevented. On the other hand it may be said that
a thirty days' respite would give the lobby a fine
chance to organize for the defeat of reforrr> measures
and the passage of crooked onesj. However, as no
good can be accomplished without opening a road to
some evil, perhaps this objection is no more valid
than the argument urged in favor of the amendment.
But the "bug" in connection with this proposed
change of system is found in the fact that the
amendment really increases the duration of legisla
tive sessions. At present members are not allowed
pay for a longer period than sixty days, and they sit
ten or twelve days without pay. So we now have
practically seventy-day sessions. The amendment al
lows pay for seventy-five days, which would probably
increase the length of the sessions from eighty-five to
ninety days.
Heretofore various attempts have been made to
increase the legislative salary limit, but all have been
voted down. The increase proposed in this case is
cleverly concealed under a change of system, but we
doubt whether for that reason it will receive the ap
proval of the people. There is no reason at present
to increase the duration of legislative sessions. The
work of the Legislature, in fact, is being constantly
cut down. After this year it will have no power to
tinker with the laws of this city or those of the va
rious counties of the State. This being the case, what
sense is there in lengthening the sessions? If any
thing, they ought to be reduced.
The average brewery wagon usually demands more
than an equitable share of rights on the highway, but
there will never be consent to its being engineered
by a driver who carries a large proportion of his beer
under his belt. The killing of a woman Monday
seems to have been the result of the drunken care
lessness of this sort of a driver, and the plea of intoxi
cation on his behalf is, just a little worse than no plea
at all.
It is an unfortunate thing for the cause of justice
that so large a part of the charges that American sol
diers have been subjected to abuse should have
emanated from such papers as the New York Jour
nal. The charges may be true, yet their source tends
to their classification as fakes.
Perhaps when California Democrats "oppose terri
torial expansion" and object to the "surrender of any
territory acquired by American valor" they have an
idea what they mean to advocate, but they were not
thoughtful enough to spread the knowledge abroad.
In all. the scandal raised about the War Depart

A STRONG COMMITTEE.
THE executive committee just appointed to take
charge of the Republican campaign is a thor
oughly representative one not only of the
party, but of the best citizenship of the State.
Every one of its members has a personal influence
and leadership among the people of the community
in which he lives, and is therefore well fitted to aid
in arousing and stimulating loyal Republicans to zeal
in behalf of the whole ticket, and in winning the fa
vor and support of independent voters.
It is a committee that means business in the fullest
and best sense of the words. It is composed of busi
ngs men who have long been eminent in the fore
most ranks of every important profession, trade or in
dustry in the commonwealth, and who represent
everj' section of its area. There is not a man on the
list who is not well and widely known and esteemed,
anrVwho has not attested his worth by the arduous
proofs of accomplished work.
Moreover, the members are as thoroughly represen
tative of genuine Republicanism as of the business
interests of the State. They are cordial supporters of
the principles and the policies of the party and of the
ticket that has been nominated. They have had ex
perience in political management and know the value
and importance of effective campaign work. They can
be counted on, therefore, to serve the party in the
coming contest with the same zeal and energy that
has won for them such success each in his chosen
vocation in the world of business.
It may be regarded as well assured that Major Mc-
Laughlin will be chosen chairman of the committee,
and certainly no better choice could be made, or one
that would give more satisfaction to the rank and file
of the party. His services in the past campaign have
proven his fidelity to the duties of that position, and
the success achieved under his leadership proves that
his ability as a party leader and organizer is fully
equal to his zeal and his untiring energy.
Taken altogether the committee is one on which
the party may well congratulate itself. It is seldom
that parties can find men of such eminence in the
business world to accept the onerous work of carry
ing on a political campaign. Such men merit the
cordial support of all Republican? and other good
citizens, and that they will have it is beyond question,
for they are among those who not only know how to
deserve success, but to achieve it.
BEWARE OF FALSE WITNESS.
SO widespread, so fierce and so vindictive has
become the attack on the War Department
because of the excessive sickness among the
troops at Santiago and in the various camps in the
Eastern States that it is evident something more
than a just indignation and a rightful desire to punish
wrongdoing animates the assailants. It is clear that
in some cases at any rate the stories of the suffering
among the volunteers have carried exaggeration and
misrepresentation to the point of falsehood, and the
public should be warned against being misled by
false witness or by sensational conclusions not sup
ported by facts. ... "
That there has been among the troops an excessive
amount of sickness may be accepted as proven; but
there is no sufficient evidence as yet to fasten blame
upon any particular persons or set of persons. It
must be remembered that the United States was un
prepared for waging a hasty war on a large' scale.
The regular army was small and the military staff
was not sufficiently large to handle the number of
troops the emergency called for. It was, neverthe
less, imperative that the advance upon Cuba should
be made at once or else postponed until next winter,
for the sickly season in the island was fast approach
ing when the war broke out. Under such circum
stances it was inevitable that mistakes would be
made and blunders committed, that supplies would
at times be inadequate, and that suffering would
enÂ«uc.
Some of the facts recently made public help to an
understanding of the subject. It is now known that
the sickness is confined almost wholly to the volun
teers, very few of the regulars having been affected.
As the two classes of troops were serving under the
same conditions, it is reasonable to draw the con
clusion that the regulars knew how to take care of
themselves and did so, by obedience to sanitary dis
cipline; while the volunteers treated campaigning
as if it were a picnic, and by careless eating, drink
ing and the neglect of proper precautions rendered
themselves subject to diseases they might have
avoided.
Another fact of importance to the problem is that
the transport Olivette brought home a number of in
valid troops, and it was found that all of them had
been well cared for, while the Mobile, another
transport that arrived about the same time, made an
exceedingly bad showing. In these cases the differ
ence between the two was found to be due not to
the administration, the officers or the men, but to
the fact that the Olivette had been constructed for
passenger service while the Mobile was built and had
been used as a tramp steamer devoted largely to
carrying cattle. . From this it appears that much of
the suffering among the troops was caused by the
lack of adequate transport ships, and this in turn was
the result of the neglect of Congress to build up an
American merchant marine in time of peace.
The evils that have befallen the nation through
the sickness of the volunteers are serious enough
without making them worse by assailing the War
Department and endeavoring to make people be
lieve our officials have been either dishonest or in
different to the welfare of the troops. There are
many important lessons for us to learn from the war
with Spain, and it is to be hoped they will not be lost
sight of for the sake of sensational attacks upon offi-.
cials. We must provide a larger army and a much
larger staff, we must subject volunteers to a strictly
sanitary discipline, and finally we must build up a
merchant marine that will save us hereafter from
having to send troops to war in cattle-ships.
The present is a little late for the Populists to be
crying over fusion. Everybody told them in advance
that they would do this. Democrats are feeling sore,
too, but neither is this emotion on their part a sur
prise. The- only satisfaction in store for these wicked
partners is that after getting licked in the fall each
can blame the other.
It would not be wise to send to the President a
peremptory demand that any particular regiment be
disbanded. As the head of the army Mr. McKinley
might nor like it, and as a mere matter of pride he
could not well hasten to obey.
Unless somebody shall be punished for the shame
ful mistreatment of soldiers, the next time Uncle Sam
needs volunteers he will not find brave young patriots
tumbling over each other to enlist.
While appreciating the disappointment of the Sev
enth California, as fine a regiment as mustered in, it
may reasonably be remembered that some other
States raised troops and never got ,a man to the
i front
A TALE OF MUSTAPHA MAGUIRE.
In the archives it is stated that many of these things occurred during the
reign of the cariph Jimbud, who ruled over a vast country on the Shores of
the western sea. '. 'â â  â 'â 
who became known as the Mustapna-
Ben - James - Gallagher - Maguire, who
was backward as a blacksmith and
forward as a jawsmith; and the people
knew him not, for he was any old thing
to suit the times.
This Mustapha one day by the beard
of the Prophet sware a round oath that
honest toll was the fool's portion and
no more would he eat his bread by the
sweat of his brow. And it was so.
"Behold!" he cried, "I will take
things easy and knock my living out
of the people with the jawbone of an
ass." And he knocked; and It was so
that he was called "the little giant,"
because of the mighty strength of his
Jaw. And he quoth that it was easier
to be a lawyer than a blacksmith, and
the people said yea, but that he was
neither. Mayhap this was bearing
false witness, for the lawgivers re
garded the Mustapha as a worthy
forger of iron, while his friends of the
forge averred that he perforce must
be a good lawgiver, because he was
worthless as a blacksmith.
Now it came to pass that in the great
city of the Golden Gate there was a
public garden known to men as "The
Sandlot," where the shiftless populace
reared strange and untoward products
â O'Dpnnells and Dunns and Maguires
and liars and anarchists and Denis
Kearneys and other things whose
names were also Dennis.
It was so that the Mustapha lusted to
i nrodurt of the Sandlot an^ ne Performed unnecessary ablution
and forthwith took his jawbone and t o!led wlth v -
Now behold! He got in the way o f Political Lightning and it smote him
with a magic wand for it also knew nim not - Whereof he was a sandlotter
and fed on the stores of the people for
four years and did not perspire.
And it later came to pass that the
people said:
"Behold! This Mustaoha is a
never-was. He has not yet begun to
commence to be anybody. "We will
have no more sand in our lot. We
will break bread with and elevate a
good Democrat to office to make our
laws." And it was so, and they told
the satraps to bring forth such a man.
Then the Mustapha lubricated his
jaw and his great promising machine
and foregathered with the satraps;
and it was so that he soon appeared in
the forum, bearing a mighty banner,
on which was written:
"I AM A DEMOCRAT."
It appeareth that there was a man
near-sighted man said:
brass who seeks high office and needs
a sign to tell the people what he is?"
A far-seeing citizen, who could look
through political millstones, replied,
saying:
"Hismllla, 'tis not a Democrat. It
is that same jawbone toller, Mustapha
Maguire, the sandlotter." ..
And the people murmured some more
and wandered homeward, saying:
"Behold! He is but the drifting
sand. "We will overlook him." And
they did, and while they Were not look
ing the Mustapha went by devious ww a ys and broke into the office with his
jawbone. And it was so, and the people were exceeding wroth and they
sware an oath that the aandslinger w a s no Democrat and that he could not
raise enough dust to blind their eyes again.
Now It was that the Mustapha Ben
Maguire smiled and muttered in his
beard: "I will cover their eyes with
wool again." And it was so.
In these days it so came to pass that
the Mustapha was troubled with low
temperature in his sandals; and he
went forth in the land and laid his ear
to the ground and listened, and, be
hold, he heard things of dire portent
and. he knew he could no longer work
the Democrat deception. So he forth
with toiled some more, and it was good.
The scribes relate that there was a
clan led by the "Whisperer," surnamed
"McNab the Nabber," who disguised
themselves as Democrats and betrayed
the childlike Bourbon maidens into the
arms of the people of the "willing
whiskers." These people always
walked in the middle of the road to
keep their hair out of the barbs of the
cactus. And they were made of
haughty stuff, for they were Popocrats.
It was so that the people sought a
new Caliph who was not. a Democrat,
and they gathered together in the fo
rum and strove much. Now it further
came to pass that they gazed afar on
the landscape and descried a rrjghty
cloud of dust and . they could not wot
what it was. But, behold, it came
nearer apace, like unto a sandspout on
the Sahara. It was a man looking for
work as a ruler, and he came before
the concourse bringing much dust,
perspiration and conceit; also, bearing a blazing shield, on which was graven:
"I AM A POPOCRAT."
And the people were- deceived muchly until they got the dust out of their
eyes, and then they were profane, and said:
"By the beard of the Prophet, it is the same old Sandlotter-Single-taxer-
Double-taxer-Gold Bug-Silver Bug-Democrat-Popocrat Mustapha Maguire
â  Bismilla! We will make his. way a weary one." And it was so; and after
: the Mustapha Maguire had got through pursuing the office and was sore dls
traught, the people made merry, scoffing him, shouting:
; "Who hath woe?' Who hath sorrow? Who Is sore of foot and hath no
; balm of Gilead? Who hath lost his sinecure by the brawn of his jaw and
j must henceforth eat his bread by the sweat of his brow? Behold it Is he
:of the changeful face and the devious recordâ -Mustapha-Ben-Gallagher
Maguire. He is no more of the people or for' the people. Let him be a
memory." And it was so. And there were peace and quiet in that fair land
fore ver_ more. MORTIMER WOOD.

LOYAL TO THE PABTY.
To the Editor of The Callâ ln the Issue
of the Chronlclo of the 25th Qf August
there appeared a communication purport
ing to have emanated from an organisa
tion known as the Dewey Republican
Club of this city, protesting against the
manner of selecting the delegates to the
State convention at Sacramento. The ar
ticle contains sentiments which certaln
lv are at variance with the character of
the loyal admiral of the navy, after whom
the organization is named. With the
factional and fault-finding sentiments ex
pressed in said article the Young Men's
Republican League has no sympathy and
the use of the names of several of the lat
ter-named organization's district cluba
was unwarranted and unauthorized.
The Young Men's Republican League
stands -for unity and harmony in the party
in the coming campaign. They present a
solid front to the enemy. They are all
birds of a feather, heads pointed one way,
uttering the same cry.

Benito, Cal. Mall for Manila is subject to
the same rate of postage that mail to any

NEWSPAPER ARTISTâ O. C. E.,
Stockton, Cal. To become a first-class
artist for a newspaper the individual must
have a good idea of drawing, of sketching
from nature, of portraiture, so as to re
produce the features and experssion of an
individual; he must be rapid in the execu
tion of his work. The duty of a first-class
artist in a newspaper office is to do the
work assigned him by the chief artist in
charge. There ia no fixed salary for a
first-class artist. His pay depends enJ
tirely upon his merit.

A man who would do so is a coward, and

three months persons in mourning should

be indulged in, but not an opera, theater

SEQUENCE IN CRIB-A Subscriber,
Sierraville, Cal. It is not necessary that
the cards forming a sequence in the game
of crib should be played in order. If A
plays a four, B an eight, A a six and B
a seven, B has a run of threeâ six, seven
and eight. If after the seven is played
A plays a five, he comes in for a run of
five; that is to say, four, five, six. seven
and eight. B cannot claim a run on the
last card played by A. A player can only
claim a run when he lays down a card
that will make a sequence. The players
huving played four, eight, six, seven, five,
the eight did not prevent the last player
from making a run of five, as it was one
of the sequence cards and not. an inter
vening card.

THE GERMAN LANGUAGEâ G. E.
\V.. Fresno. Cal. German was taught in
public schools in San Francisco ten years
ago. A school for teaching the French
and German languages was first insti
tuted in October, 1885, in a small build
ins? on which was subsequently built the
Tehnma-btreel school. In 1872 and I*7;
the instruction in the French and Ger
man languages was introduced in nearly
all of the public schools. The children in
the primary grades and those in the
grammar classes were compelled to study
either French or German, while in the
grammar uraclcs in the cosmopolitan
schools the pupils had to study both
French and German. In February, 1*74,
the study of all languages except the
L'nglish was abolished by the Board of
Education in all the public schools, ex
cept the Girls' and Boys' High School.
In July of that year the study of French
and German web again Introduced in the
North and South Cosmopolitan, Hayes
Valley and Valencia Grammar and In the
Storkton-street, Taylor-street and Silver
streetprimary schools. In 1888, ten years
ago, German was taught only in the
North Cosmopolitan Grammar, South
Cosmopolitan Grammar. South Cosmopol
itan Primary and Greenwich Primary.
During the first six months of that year
1461 pupila were studying German and
in the last six months 1443.

Numerous Changes and Transfers of
Teachers in the Various De
partments â Examinations
September 23.
The Board of Education held a lively
session yesterday afternoon. Consider
able business was transacted, but amid
a dir<> confusion that left many of the
members in doubt, at times, ub to what
was transpiring.
The board wrangled over the question
of purchasing forty typewriting machines
for the use of scholars in the evening
business schools, and it soon appeared
that every machine on the market had at
least one advocate among the members.
The committee on supplies had recom
mended threo of the leading machines,
but the board would not hear to restric
tion. Failing to agree as to which ma
chines should be purchased, the board
concluded to let the schools wait, and
gained time by referring the matter back
to the committee. The average price
quoted by the agents of the various $100
machines was $70 apiece.
The question of appropriating $3500 for
the school library for the present year
was discussed, but was tabled, pending
word from the Supervisors as to what
money could be had for the purpose.
The case of Mrs. Irene Reeves, teacher
in the Girls' High School, also figured
prominently. Principal Brooks had, In
his June report, reported adversely to
Mrs Reeves, claiming that she was de
ficient in scholarship and discipline.
Since that time no action had been taken,
although there had been much talk over
The committee on qualifications finally
decided that something must be done to
settle the matter one way or the other
and at yesterday's session had Mrs.
Reeves' name Included in the list of
teachers to be transfered. It was recom
mended that she be given a place in the
Polytechnic' High School. The proposed
transfer at once aroused acrimonious dis
cussion, two or three members trying to
talk at Once, while tho president of the
board pounded his gravel vigorously for
order. It was quite evident that the
teacher had both friends and opponents
in the board, but the preponderance of
sentiment could not be determined, as
the chair cut short the .discussion in its
incipient stage by declaring the talk out
of order.
â¢'No charges have been . preferred
against Mrs. Reeves before thia board,"
\v;ik his decision. Nevertheless It was
hard to suppress the matter. One mem
ber exclaimed: . â¢
"If there are any charges why not
spring them at once? Let us know all
about It."
"There is a boycott on In the High
School against Mrs. Reeves," remarked
another.
Again the gavel came vigorously down
and the tumult was finally quelled. Un
der the rules of the board any teacher is
given a second chance, as after the first
complaint by a principal she is allowed
to go to another school and take up
work. If the principal of this school also
makes complaint, then the board is
obliged to summon the teacher to appear
before it to answer to charges.
It was decided that the next semi-an
nual examination of applicants for teach
ers' positions should begin on Fri
day, September 23, at the San Francisco
Normal School.
Misa Kate E. Whltaker resigned as
head teacher of cooking In the schools,
stating that she had been suddenly called
to England and did not wish to ask for
a furlough, as she had recently been
away. Miss Mary Tilhnan was tempora
rily chosen to fill her place.
The Woman's State Federation for the
Public Hood presented a remonstrance,
through its recording secretary, Lila May
Kimball, against the growing* practice In
the public schools of calling on the schol
ars for contributions to various objects,
for the rental of pianos, for soldiers'
lunches, etc. THe practice. It was stated,
was wrong, inasmuch as many children
were too poor to contribute, especially
during the "hard times," and there were
many heart-burnings in consequence.
Tho federation hoped that the board
would put a stop to the requests for
money, lunches, etc. The remonstrance
wus favorably received, and the practices
complained of will be stopped.
It was decided to not grant the petition
asking that a private house be rented for
overflow purposes in connection with the
Noe Valley School. Incidental reference
was made to the fact that the board had
already asked for bids for the construc
tion of a new school building for this par
ticular district and that early action was
expected on the part of the Supervisors
in granting money for the construction.
Under the present conditions tho board
has no fund* available for school houde
building purposes.
The repainting of the Lincoln School
building was ordered. A. L. Mann
was granted a renewal of his High School
certificate, as was also Miss Eldora Sew
ell, teacher of bookkeeping.
Life diplomas in the grammar grade
were awarded to Miss Josephine Harri
gan, Miss Augusta Wright Hobe, Mrs.
Florence G. Osborne, and Miss Alice
Schendel. On recommendation of the City
Board of Examination grammar grade
certificates were issued to Miss Fanny
Levy, Mr*. H. A. Newhoff, Mrs. Frances
Qulnlan, Miss Elizabeth A. Leggett. Miss
Bessie F. Staehli, William H. Torpey,
Miss Nettie V. Erbbe, Nathaniel Sanders,
Miss E. E. Crookham. Miss C. Fenton,
Miss Myrtle I. Kratzer, Miss Margaret
Dowling.
The following changes were made in the
assignments of teachers: Miss E. T.
Ryan, assistant In Fremont Primary,
transferred to Golden Gate Primary; Miss
E. Tidd, assistant in John Swett Gram
mar, transferred to Fremont Primary;
Miss A. Breeze, assistant in Humboldt

Feeley, probationary in Emerson School,
assigned to Jackson Primary; Miss Net
tle Llpman, probationary In Irving Scott
School, transferred to Emerson Primary;
Miss E. Kline, of day substitute class,
transferred to evening substitute class.
It was decided to form a new school at
Forty-third street and Point Lobos ave
nue. A new class will be formed in Bar
rlngton School; also one in Crocker Gram
mar School. F. Hanley, of the day sub
stitute class, was assigned to Crocker
School. Miss Clara Dolan. elected teach
er, was placed In Adams Grammar School,
vice Mr. Zimmerman, transferred.
The committee on evening schools made
recommendations which were adopted, as
follows: Mr. Smith O'Brien was chosen
assistant in the drawing department of
Humboldt Evening School. The following
from the substitute list were made proba
tionary teachers: Miss Maude Hart, to
John Swett School; Mrs. M. Stewart, to

HYDRANTS IN
BUNCHES ON
VACANT STREETS
The Water Company
Piling Up a Bill.
FIRE DEPARTMENT EXPENSES
PROTECTION WHERE THERE IS
NOTHING TO BURN.
A Lack of System in Placing and Re
pairing Fire Â±"lugs That Ia
Costly to the
City.
I .
A matter which will be brought to the
attention of the Supervisors as soon as
the board reassembles in September is
the remarkable increase in the number
of city hydrants during the last six
months. There have been 107 new ones
placed at various points, some of them in
thinly settled portions of the suburbs, not
to mention eighty-nine old hydrants
WhlcJi were replaced by new ones, on the
allegation that they were worn out.
Grave doubts are expressed as to the ne
cessity for all of these additions and re
jjftwalÃ, eapecla..y in view of the fact
that a large profit therefrom accrues to
the Spring Valley Water Company. Not
a week has passed by of late but what a
number of hydrants were quietly added
to the already large supply, the grand
total at present being Â»mM-
Under the present arrangements the
ctiy pays |60 per year to the Spring Val
ley Company for each of these hydrants,
no matter whether some of them are used
or not, the revenue to the company from
this source being quite a respectable sum.
The fact that so many hydrants are being
located in sparsely settled districts, where
the requirements of the Fire Department
are practically nothing, and that these
hydrants are usually placed by the Su
pervisors after recommendation by the
Fire Chiefs, raises a question as to why
these things are so. Has the Spring Val
ley Company a mesmeric power over the
Fire Department, that it ia able to so
largely increase its number of hydrants
anil its revenues therefrom? This is a
question that is puzzling the mind of at
least one nf the Supervisors, and will be
raised at the first opportunity.
Not only does the water company de
rive a steady revenue from each hydrant,
but it is also allowed a good price for set
ting new hydrants and replacing and re
pairing old ones. The sum of $40 is al
lowed for each new hydrant located and
$22 50 for eaci. new hydrant replacing an
old one. Where old hydrants are re
paired, the compensation of the company
is on an equally liberal basis.
The city records bring out some inter
esting facts. In December, 1896, the com
pany charged $15,437 for the water sup
plied to public buildings, hydrants,
parks and squares. In December of the
following year the charge wat $19,993, the
Increase being directly traceable to new
hydrants. For the water supplied dur
ing July of the present year, for which
bills were rendered this month, the
charge amounted to $20,654 GT, revealing
the steady upward trend of the bills.
In addition to water money the com
pany received during the six months end
ing June 30, 1898, the sum of of $6254 50 for
new hydrants located and others reset,
not having had to supply any material,
as the Fire Department had furnished
the hydrants, etc., at a cost to the city
of $7341 TO. Thus the total cost of these
hydrants was $13,626 20. The city mains
were tapped in 107 new places, the bal
ance of the money going for renewals.
The fixed annual charge of $6420 will be
added to the city's water bills hence
forth as a result of the addition of the
107 new hydrants.
But not only have hydrants been placed
in isolated locations in the suburbs, but
hydrants have been grouped in bunches
I in the settled districts, as many as three
â  often being found on one corner. As an
Illustration Taylor street from Post to
Bush may be cited. At the three street
intersections and along and near Taylor
street, on the two included blocks, are
located fifteen hydrants, some of them
in pairs. At the intersection of Taylor
and Bush two hydrants are grouped on
one corner, while there is none on the
corner diagonally opposite.
The responsibility for the placing of the
hydrants rests with the Fire Department,
where a prodigality in expenditures is
shown in every branch of its work. It is
not generally known that the local depart
ment costs more, in proportion to the
number of inhabitants In the city, than
any other fire department in the United
States, but such is shown by recently
compiled statistics, now being circulated
by insurance journals. According to the
table San Francisco fire protection costs
$2 20 per capita, figuring on the basis of
325 000 population, shown by the last school
census. The cost in other cities, based
upon the latest school census, is as fol-

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. SI.â To-day's stock mar

Sugar and most of the â â¢railway shares" '.were
semi-stagnant all day. and moet of them closed
at small net losses and with outside flustua-.
tlons for the lav of only email fraction?. The
great combination of iron and. steel companies
â was one of the notable influences which caused
activity and strength in a number of stocks-:'

fchov.-ed strength all day and the common jind
preferred stocks of the American Steel â¢ and-'

report that a reserve surplus to Insure, the: pre
ferred dividend was In contemplation. People's
Gas was very largely dealt' In and gained. : 2H
ret. closing at the top on this; belief that con
flicting Interests had been adjusted. The. buoy
ancy of this stock at the close did' not save the.
balance of the lint from a sagging tendency.
There were conspicuous movements In*: number
of other stocks of leÂ«R prominence. Manhattan
â was a source of weakness all day' and -.lost 3
points at one time. The announcement of the
first gold imports imparted some vigor to the
market and did not check a further decline In

early in the day that foreign demand here for
Wheat for shipment ; was more active..' than * for
'some-time previous.- It was partly '.because of
the improved export demand,- but perhaps .
: on account 'of the early bullishness ..of Corn
that September.' and December-. Wheat at ' Chi
cago quickly . recovered the slight dip -It-made
at the opening. Cash Wheat was easy at about

NOTICE TO MARINERS.
Forecast of Wind and Weather in the North
Pacific Ocean for September, 18S8.
The cub-chart of isobarÃ and isotherms for
; September, which appears elsewhere on the
chart, shows an almost permanent high, slight
ly farther east and of somewhat smaller area
than the one during: August, the center being
near latitude 41 decrees north and longitude
146 degrees west. The trade wind limits will be
found considerably farther south than during
the preceding month, and these winds will be
found not so clearly marked.
In the zone between 35 degrees north and 50
degrees north gales, accompanied with rain,
may be expected with greater frequency than
during August. Out of 2311 observation* In that
part of the ocean Included between latitude 35
degrees north and 50 degrees north and longi
tude 125 west and 146 east, IS per cent give a
force of wind above 5, and 7 per cent above
6 (Beaufort scale), as against 10 per cent and
3 per cent, respectively, for the month of
August. In the China Sea and the vicinity of
the Philippine Islands rain squalls and thunder
storms may be cxpeited, especially in the vicin
ity of the western mast of the Island of Luzon.
Squally weather may be expected in the vicin
ity of the Hawaiian Inlands and on the coasts
of Mexico and Central America.
Occasional highs and lows will be found mov
ing in a general easterly dtrertlon across the
ocean. Generally, in front of the cyclonic area,
or low, the weather is damp, with thermometer
rising and barometer falling, while In front of
the anti-cyclonic circulation, or high, It Is dry.
cooler and the barometer rises. The "average
storm track" traced on the chart shows the
average path of the centers of these lows.
The average low over Asia will have moved
off the coast to thÂ° southeast, and a high will
be found forming to the northward. This con
dition brings thÂ» openlne of the northeast mon
soon season, ar.d thesr winds, though not fully
established, will probably begin to blow. In the
Formosa Channel and along the northern part
of the roast of China during this month.
Typhoons are expected more frequently this
month than last In the China Pea, as during
September the occurrence of tho^e cyclonic
storms usually attains a maximum frequency
In East Asiatic waters, probably first appear
ing to the eastward of the Philippine Islands.
The average paths of the different classes of
typhnons. taken from a study of 244 of these
storms occurring between ISS4 and 1537, are
shown on the chart.
After crossing the line coming north vessels
bound for the west coast of America may ex
pect heavy rain squalls and thunder storms,
and occasional wind squalls in passing through
the doldrums.
Fog and heavy mist will be found along the
Am-rlcan coast, though riot so prevalent as
lnat roonth. and north of the forty-fifth parallel
from the American coast to the Kuril Islands,
occasional fog may be expected. The coast of
China may be expected to be comparatively free
from fog this month.

CHRIS BUCKLEY
IS COMING BACK
EX-BOSS EXPECTED FROM THE
EAST TO-DAY.
Christopher A. Buckley is coming to
town. . â â¢'.-. â â -. ; .'.:;. â¢â '.". :â¢:.'.
Democratic circles are In a turmoil over
nnounceroent that the biind boss of
other days will arrive in the city from the
â¢ lay. and speculation Is rife as to
I â  :i !i <.Â«!" a figure the blind boss will
â¢ lit In the present campaign. Buckley's
r some who consider themselves
hi.^ fi that lie is out of politics
for good ami all; that with the turning
down of Rainey his last political dream
was fui;il!ed, and he is now content to
:...- Livermore foot-juicery
!':,e fruits of his long and ac-
i ret r. â¢â¢'.. :;â¢ : . ; .
But tht-re are othersâ and they, too, as
sert strong claims, to the Buckley corifl-
â -rt that before the cam-
fi ia much older the erstwhile boss
will be very much in evidence. It is
worthy that these claimants are di
; m opinion as to which camp of
â  crats "Buck" will pitcn his tent.
This may 3eem strange, but It is none the
li ss a fact that both factions are hoping.
Thy l'htlanites take it for grantea mat
he vi.il line un with them in the big rush,
and their reasons for this arc- many and
obvious.
the other hand the Harneyltes re
call the days when Buckley did politics
Â«it tht? nld stand, and his inordinate fond
ness for primaries. Primaries, they say,
were a: ways "Bucks'" strong point. If
there was any one part of the game he
liked more than another it was the good
old Democratic primaries, wtth the ac
companying mussed up countenances and
cap'tiwed ballot boxes, to say nothing of
an occasional attendant job for the Coro
ner.
And recalling this, the Harneyites argue
that Buckli y would not feel at home with
a' crowd that eschewed primaries, but
V...H11 find it much to his liking to mix
with themâ Ralney Includedâ take a fall
out of the committee of. one hundred and
â¢.iiiiish the dear old .primary system.
H'lWi-v.-r, Buckley will sonn be-on the
field ami it will not take him long to let
the world know "where he is at."- ' ..-
Th. re Is every prospect of a pretty lit
tle ijght In the Twentieth Senatorial Dis
trict. Eugene F. Bert is up for re-elec
tion, rmd againÃt him in all probablity
will be Henry C. GUSKford. Bert is sure of
the Republican nomination if he will ac
e.jit it. and there does not seem to be.
any material opposition to Gesford. Both
are Native Sons and- stand high In that
order; bdth are well-known, lawyers and
both nave scores of warm personal friends
who will make every exertion to win out. ;
It will be a contest well worth watching,

ventlonÃ: It was partly due to his wife's
thrift that he accumulated such a com

was taken with her last sickness/ and
prior to her death : Sturgis engaged a mu

two. years ago. In consideration of tak

he deeded this property to the Englishes,

turned from a. trip to Los Angeles., he was
â¢ constantly with this interesting and pretty

She â is now divorced from her ' husband, . all

property on Sutter street, between La
guna and Octavia, that h*r held as se
curity for the payment of $10,000 duo him
as the legal adviser of Mrs. Theresa Bell
and "Mammy" Pleasant. The plaintiff
in the suit against Solomons was Mrs.
Rebecca J. Boone, who claimed the prop
erty and alleged that Solomons simply
hf Id It in trust for her. Her claim was
supported by the evidence of "Mammy"
Pleasant, but the negro's testimony that
the property belonged to the plaintiff,
Mrs. Boone, was not consistent with
proved facts and documentary evidence.

The Largest Freshman Class Thr.t
Ever Entered the Academic Col

BEBKEL.EY, Aug. 31.â f he recorder of
the University of California has prepared
a j.ist of all those who have entered
Berkeley' this year, which goes to show
that the class of 1902 is the largest that
has ever been known in the university's
history;: :"
Ip to date over 600 applications for ad
mission nave- been received, of which â 
sixty were from graduate students. The
remainder, roughly estimated at 550, form
the greatest number of undergraduate
students that have ever been admitted at
one single time. :
It is noticeable also that this year the
proportion of women students to men stu
dents is smaller than that of the year be
fore. At that time the womfn students
formed about 50 per cent of the entering
clap.s. This year the percentage has
dropped to below forty.

WHISKY AND LAUDANUM.
William Russell* a carpenter living at

num. Russell leaves a widow and two
young children totally unprovided for.
Russell had not been working regular
ly for some time, the la.st job he was em
ployed on being at the Irish Fair. His
lack of work made him despondent and
he drank heavily to drown his sorrows.
Tuesday night he went to Root's drug
store at Sixth and Howard streets and
purchased a bottle of whisky, a bottle of
laudanum and a bottle of soothing syrup
for his younger child. He went home
about 10 o'clock, and after drinking a por
tion of the whisky he pulled the cork out
of the bottle of laudanum and was swal
lowing It when his wifu, becoming sus
picious, took it away from him.
Mrs. Russell was not aware of the fact
that her husband had taken poison until
yesterday morning, after making inquiry
at the drug store, and she at once noti
fied the police, and he was sent to the
Receiving Hospital. Dre. Weil and
Rinne did everything possible for him,
but he died about 2 o clock yesterday af
ternoon. The body was removed to tho
Morgue.
Chief Steward Bucher, of the hospital,
notified the police that the bottle of laud
anum had been procured at Root's drug
store without a physician's prescription,
and a warrant* will be sworn out this
morning for the arrest of the proprietor.

MEYEftHOFF'S DEATH. ,
The Coroner will make an investigation
into the death of Martin Meyerhoff , who
died suddenly in his grocery store on
Seventh Btreet Monday morning. It was
supposed at the time that death was
due to cerebral apoplexy, but his friends
have since received an anonymous letter
hinting at foul play.
No reason is known why any one
should have attempted to injure Mr.
Meyerhoff, nor is their any reason why
he "should have committed suicide. The
letter has worried h%s friends, however,
so they made arrangements to have the
body taken to the Morgue this morning
and an autopsy performed. The letter
was turned over to Chief Lees.
EXPERIENCE
NOT DESIRED
An Oakland Surgeon Is
Given a Surprise,
GENERAL STERNBERG'S IDEA
THIRTY YEARS IS TOO OLD
FOR ARMY SERVICE.
Dr. Arnold Says It Is Not Cause for
Surprise That So Many Sol
diers Suffer From Sick
ness.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â .;;â  : 908 Broaway, Aug. 31.
Dr. Rawdon Arnold of this city believes
he has discovered one of the reasons why
there has been so much dissatisfaction
regarding, the treatment of sick soldiers.
Dr. Arnold wrote to the War Department
offering his services to the surgeon gen
eral, and as he had large experience dur
ing the Civil War he thought his applica
tion might be to. some purpose, He ha 4
received a. letter from Surgeon General
Sternberg which has caused him much
surprise, for it states that no. regular
army surgeons are appointed unless they
are under 29 years of age. This limit is
said to be comparatively ridiculous when
it is considered that an army surgeon,
removed from the privilege of consulting
with other surgeons, should certainly be
a man of mature experience. ;
In his letter General Sternberg says:
"The surgeon general highly appreciates
the patriotic motives which have, induced
this offer of services, ifl many instances ;
by men prominent in the profession and
enjoying a lucrative practice, But the la
bor of answering these letters Interferes
with the hecesisary work .of. the office,
which has been greatly increased by the
exigencies connected with equipping the
regular and volunteer armies for field ser
vice. .
"No appointments are made in the reg
ular army except after examination by
an army medical examining board, and
all applicants must be graduates In medi
cine and less than 29 years of age. All
applications and offers of service will be
placed on file for future reference and for
selection of the most available persons
for the special duty required in case of
need."
"I do not wonder that there is such dis
satisfaction among wounded soldiers,"
said Dr. Arnold, "after learning of the
method in which surgeons are appointed.
I should think that experienced surgeons,
even though they be somewhat over the
youthful age of 29, might be of some ser
vice to the United States army."
"LORD ATHOL" SENTENCED.

duties of entertaining the members and of keeping up the nigh standard
of athletic supremacy won by the club In the past. .... ]
It is the intention of Mr. Hammersmith, if elected, to devote his time
and experience in building up the club's athletic reputation, which has
been fn a state of stagnation during the past year. During his leadership -

still flows in, and is devoted to fitting up
the building which is to be a home for
the recovering soldiers.

SEEKING FOR
EVIDENCE IN
SAN FRANCISCO
Detectives Striving to Trace
Here the Death Gift to
Mrs. Dunning.
The Prosecution Will Use the Grand Jury as
an Instrument With Which to Obtain
Necessary Testimony.
The mystery that surrounds the mur
der of Mrs. .Dunning and Mrs. Deane has
not yet been solved, although the police
authorities of this city and of Dover have
been at work upon the tragedy for weeks.
After a thorough and very exhaustive in
vestigation in San Francisco and in dif
ferent parts of the. State Chief of Police
Lees can fay no more than that Mrs. Cor
delia Botkin must explain certain ap
parently (significant facts before. she will
be allowed to go at liberty. There is at
present nothing to show the guilt of the
accused woman. That she was Intimate
with Dunning no one denies. That the
anonymous letters written to Mrs. Dun
ning before her death place Mrs. Botkin
in a peculiar position every one admits.'
Beyond this the police have nothing ex
cept the belief .of . Dunning . that : the
anonymous letters were written by Mrs.
Hot kin and formed part of the dreadful
conspiracy that ended In the death, of the
two women. â â¢., â¢ '
This extraordinary condition of affairs
became apparent yesterday when the au
thorities made public one of the anony
mous letters received by Mrs. Dunning,
and Detective McVey declared- that the
husband of the woman had unhesitatingly,
declared that the anonymous letters had
been written by Mrs. Botkin. These ad
missions revealed the startling fact that
the police authorities, of this city and of
Dover have been acting at cross purposes.
When Detective McVey started from
Delaware the only practical information
be possessed was Dunning^ expressed
belief that Mrs. Botkin had written the
anonymous letters to his wife and had
penned the address on the death-laden
package that had crossed the continent
through the mails.
The authorities of Delaware believed
that the police of this city had traced the
box of poisoned candy to its purchaser. It
was represented to them that the clerk of
the i andy store had positively identified
Mrs. Botkin- as the woman who bought
the candy. It was said that the postal
clerk who sold the stamps cculd remem
ber the woman and establish her identity
as tU*t of Mrs.' Botkin.. The Eastern
authorities were >conlldent- that the mur
deress had been found, but they did not
know that the police : of this city had
found nothing with which to connect Mrs.
Botkin with the crime. The purchase of
the box of candy had not . been . traced. â¢
The local police do not know who '-Hold it
or who .bought It. They. uo : not know
whether it was 'bought In this city or in
Btockton, and they can not tell at which
postal station it was mailed.
This fact was demonstrated yesterday:
by two incidents. A local detective.' was
sent from, candy store to candy- store
seeking to discover where . the. â  box ' of
Bweetmeats had been sold. 'He had with
mm the box of poisoned candy and pho
tographs of the box and its. wrapper. The
quest was unsuccessful. No one could tell
where the box had been sold. Later in the
day the Chief of Police, several detectives
and Postal Inspector win visited 'â¢ the
ferry postal station in an effort to fix the
time when the box had been mailed. This.
Journey was also without purpose. The
police are utterly at a loss to trace the
box or .to discover Its purchaser. They
wer>? dismayed yesterday by the assertion
of Frank Gattrell that the box he sold to
the mysterious woman had no silk ribbon
boys upon It. The box that carried death
to Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane was
marked by two dainty silken bows. This
discrepancy has addÂ»d a new lelment.of
doubt that Investigation has been unable
to silence.
It is in this condition that the authori
ties are resting until the application for
extradition arrives from Delaware. Chief
Lees has telegraphed to the Eastern au
thorities to present the strongest possl
ole case against Mrs. Botkin. This in
struction, elaborated with a series of ex
planations and cautions, has been carried
put to the letter, and a necessary delay
nas been the result. Chief of Police Lees
loes not wish to try the woman In this
i?t.-ite. He has not the evidence with
svhich to go to trial. a.nd he seems un
ible to obtain It. He is now moved by a
new iiit-a. When he discovered thai 'an
indictment of murder by the local Gratid
Jury would be a fatal mistake he decided
to use the official machinery of inquisi
tion to force unwilling witnesses to talk.
Several people, men and women, have
been be-fore the Chief and reiterated
their insurance that they knew nothing
:hat might shed light upon the murder.
The Chief of Police does not bPlleve them.
md ho will ask tho Grand Jury to assist
him where he has failed. He does not
wish an indictment fur murder, but he
hill set on foot a judicial inquiry simply
:o lf-arn what summoned witnesses have
:o tell. The Grand Jury investigation has
Jeen Bet for to-duy, and if an indictment
must be found the poiice will ask that
Mrs. Botkin be charged slmi ly with a
nisdemennor for having sent poisoned
;Â«ndy through the mails. Tf such an ln

A MOTHER'S SWORN STATEMENT
My little daughter May's head and face
broke out in one solid mass of bleeding sores,
and one of her ears was bo affected, that the
doctor thought that it would slough off. Her
suffering was intense, getting no rest at all,
unless under the influence of opiates. The
physician tried every known remedy, but in-
stead of getting better, they seemed to get
worse all the time. Distracted with her con-,
dition, I was advised to try Cirnccn a Reme-
dies. I administered Citticura Rksolvext

t dlctment should be found it would inter
| fere In no way with the extradition of
1 Mrs. Botkin. me more serious ailega
| ton of murder would take precedence. In
i this way Chief Lees hopes to assist the
! authorities cf Dover.
As already indicated the only material
â¢ evidence in the cuse Is that supplied by
I John P. Dunning-, the husband of one
,of the murdered women. Dunning do
: clares his belief that the anonymous let
! tors were written by Mrs. Botkin. Of
j the address on the box of poisoned candy
and the note in the box he ventures no
opinion.
There is very little donbt that Dun
ning*s testimony will be shaken by his
own shameless admission that he deserted
a lovable wife and child for the com
pany and daily association of drunken
womon. The defense will not forget that
Dunning squandered the money stolen
from employers upon women who made
the race courses their headquarters and
the "tenderloin" their home. When the
husband appears on the stand as an ac
cuser of Mrs. Botkin or of any one else
he will find that he is called upon to
defend himself quite as much as to ac
cuse. Yet his testimony is the only vital
element of fact that has yet entorod Into
the case. The prosecution views this sit
uation with sincere regret, and effort and
energy aro being devoted to gather evi
dence independent of what the husband
may ray or do.
The quest will be continued as long and
as persistently as possible. This city as
well as o'hers in the State are l>e.lng ran
sacked for clews. Ever>- witness will be
closely questioned and when Mr... Botkin
is placed on trial for her life all that may
be done will have been accomplished.
DUNNING SAID MRS.
BOTKIN WAS GUILTY
With the consent of Chief Lees. Detec
tive McVey talked of the Dunning case
yesterday. The Delaware officer gave the
details of a conversation he had with J.
Fac-Simile of One of the Anonymous Letters That Dunning
Says Was Written by Mrs. Botkin.
P. Dunning just before he left for San
Francisco.
McVey says that Dunning positively
and unhesitatingly declared that the
anonymous letters received by hl3 wife
were written by Mrs. Botkin and that the
note lnclofed within the candy box was
written by the same hand.
Immediately after Dunning's return to
Dover from Porto Rtco Detective McVey
went to him with two of the anoriymous
letters. Dunning examined them closely
for several minutes and then said, with
an intonation of surprise:
"Where did you get those letters?"
"Your wife received them from Ban
Fram-lsco."
"Dunnlng^trien told mo," said McVey,
"that he had been led to believe that Mrs.
Louise Beeley was the author of the -tet
ters. He said his wife had sent a similar
letter to him whiie he was in Salt Lake,
and that he had sent it to Mrs. Botkin in
San Francisco. According to Dunning,
Mrs. Botkin wrote to him saying that
Mrs. Seeley had written the letter.
"The letter Dunning received from his
wife was only a copy. She kept the origi
nal and It never left her possession, fie
was startled when handed the Original. I
asked him If he recognized the handwrit-'
Ing and he replied that it was Mrs. Bot
kln's. He wns very positive, and said he
was thoroughly familiar with her writing,
DUNNING SAYS MRS. BOTKIN
WROTE THE ANONYMOUS LETTERS
DOVER, Del., Aug. 31.â Dunning late to-night was shown a telegram
from San Francisco stating that Detective McVey had made public cer
tain anonymous letters written to Mrs. Dunning and declared that they
and the Mrs. C. note were In Mrs.Botkin's handwriting.
"I identified the handwriting in the anonymous letters as tha* of Mrs.
Botkin." Dunning said, "but, mind you, not that 1 on the cu.idy-box
wrapper, nor the 'Mrs. C note. Of these I cannot talk to-night, be
cause Detective McVey himself had forwarded the wrapper to Chief Lees
before I could see It. On the note I shall talk later. I think it no harm
for me to tell that I made an affidavit for Magistrate Cooper yesterday
accusing Mrs. Botkin, but not on thestrength of the 'Mrs. C note. About
one year ago my wife received two anonymous letters, the contents of
which ought not to be made public, and which I will not make public in
deference to Attorney General White's wishes. The handwriting I iden
tify as Mrs. Botkln's. I am reasonably familiar with it, and can Identify
It among that of many persons."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1898.
as he had received 200 or 300 letters from
her. Dunning then examined the note,
'With love to yourself and baby. Mrs. C.,'
and also declared it was written by Mrs.
Botkin.
"I then asked Dunning who he thought
sent the poisoned candy to his wife, and
he replied, 'I am convinced that Mrs. Bot
kin did it.'
McVey refused to disclose the amount
or character of the evidence the Dela
ware authorities had secured against
Mrs. 80-tkin. He referred all the news
paper men to Chief Lees. He would not
say whether or not any evidence had been
withheld. All that could be got out of
the visiting officer was:
"Personally I would have no hesitation
In giving everything we have to the, pub
lic, but Chief Lees holds a different opin
ion. The case Is entirely In the hands of
the local Chief of Police, and it would
be discourteous in me to act contrary to
his wishes. The Delaware authorities de
pend on the San Francisco Police Depart
ment to ferret out the criminal, and I
sha.ll be guided by Chief Lees' wishes in
the matter of interviews.
"In the East we. have a afferent mthod.
There everything the police secure In a
criminal case 's given to the newspapers.
"The system of putting a prisoner in
jail and not disclosing a particle of evi
dence against the suspected person until
the trial begins has been abolished. Some
time ago I read in a New York paper a
statement by the District Attorney of
that city that the old secret system had
been done away with and that the public
would be informed from day to day in
regard to criminal cases.
"This is only fair to the accused per
son, and the public is entitled to know
what Its servants are doing," concluded
Detective McVey.
COMING TO EXAMINE
THE CANDY BOX
STOCKTON, Aug. 31.â Chief Gall this
morning received the following telegram
from Chief Leea of San Francisco: "Send
Gattrpl land Miller with evidence."
Chief Gall had tried to arrange matters
so that the box brought from Delaware
by Detective McVey might be brought to
this city, but he was unable to do so.
For comparison the clerks took with
them some candies, such as Gattrell put
into the box for a woman whom he and
Miller supposed to be Mrs. Botkin. The
boys left on the evening boat and will
meet Chief I^ees at his office to-morrow
morning.
COMING FROM MANILA.
Dr. Bethers of the First California
Will Be Here Soon.
A cablegram was received yesterday
from Dr. Rethers, one of the surgeons of
the First California Regiment at Manila,
stating that he would leave for this city
on a transport sailing yesterday on the re
turn voyage from Manila.
Dr. Rethers was a partner of the late
Dr. Morse and a cablegram was sent
notifying him of the doctor's death and
urgin-g him to return. He must have ap
plied to the War Department for leave
of absence and procured it as shown by
his cablegram received yesterday. He
will be her*> in about three weeks. He
held the rank of captain along with Dr.
O'Brien, the ex-Health Officer, Dr. Mc-
Carthy being the surgeon major.
COLE IS IN
AND SPOTTS
GOES OUT
Many Changes at the
Mint.
DAN WILL NOW MAKE MONEY
TWENTY GIRLS REMOVED WITH
A SWOOP.
The August Coinage Breaks All the
Mint Records of the United
States in Turning Out
Money.
A revolution in the Mint of the United
States at San Francisco began yesterday,
and to-day a new order of things will be
established.
For one thing, that old and short Dem
ocratic warhorse, A. T. Spotts^ dropped
Uncle Sam's dies as coiner of the. na
tion's greatest mint, and this morning
that old and tall Republican . â warhorse.
Dan T. Cole will spit on his hands, pick
up the dies and go to hammering ont
the golden millions that bear the -eagle.
Yesterday ended Coiner 9potts' four
years of office, and to-day begins pan
Cole's career as chief money-maker for
Uncle Sam. The event brings a certain
degree of sadness to all political circles.
In the Republican camp It will be re
gretted that this valjant old stager's po^
litical activity will possibly be circum-
Bcribed by his new and very important
Job. However, the course of business af
fairs at the mint promises that after to
day Dan Cole will be doing more to up
hold the gold standard than anybody
else in the nation. '.':
It is interesting to observe that the
retiring coiner, Mr. Spotts, has during his
term broken the United States record of
coinage efficiency in more than one par
ticular, and his record is that of the effi
ciency of the San Francisco Mint. The
laws and regulations governing the mint
allow a certain small percentage of cost
due to unavoidable wastage, excess of
operating expenses, overcharges, and so
on. During his term Mr. Spotts has
made a record for the San Francisco
Mint of the lowest cost on this basis of
ail the mints in the country. The supe
rior efficiency of the San Francisco Mint
has also been shown during his adminis
tration by the greater relative output of
coin compared with wages paid and oth
er expenses.
It fs not generally realized that the
San Francisco Mint puts into circulation
In this country more money than all the
other mints of the nation combined Mr
Spotts 1 four years' record as a money
maker is practically that of one admin
istration. The records show that during
the four years ending yesterday tho San
i ranclsco Mint coined $153,697,834 worth of
money, of which over $125,000,000 was of
gold of Pacific Coast production and
poured into the nation's business chan
nels.
About 50 per cent of the refined bullion
which reaches the coiner is delivered by
him in the form of money, the rest being
cuttings which go back for remitting and
return. Hence Mr. Spotts and his 120 or
so employes have in four years handled
over $300,000,000 worth of bullion. During
his term Mr. Spotts has coined about
37,500 000 pieces of money, and each piece
of whatever denomination is handled 160
times in the coiners' department. As
the work of the mint Is expanding so
rapidly Mr. Cole has probably a still big
ger four years' job ahead of him.
Each morning the cOiner at the mint
turns over to the superintendent the
coined money on hand. The star day's
record of the last four years is $620,000,
'Which is a pretty good: day's work on
$20 pieces, yesterday the money and
bullion in the coiner's possession was ex
actly reckoned, and Superintendent F. A.
I,each gave Mr. Spotts receipts which
ended the responsibility of himself and
bondsmen. The vaults were sealed and
this morning Mr. Cole, who was present
yesterday, will hlmsolf break the vault
seals and then his responsibility will be
gin. â¢ . â¢.
The retiring coiner to-day steps into a
new position and into ex-Mayor EUert'3
recently vacated shoes as manager for the
California Title Insurance and Trust
Company, a position offered to him be
cause of his familiarity with real estato
matter gained as Recorder of San Fran
cisco and elsewhere and because of his
wide experience with banking and flnatir
clal matters.
The transfer of office yesterday neces
sitated an early suspension of. coinage
operations. It came about 1 p. m., when
Dan Cole was around and the genial new
Coiner asked the available Mint forces to
go out and have a drink. The new Coiner
headed the procession from the. Coiner's
department, and began the march with
silent concern for tl^e small army of girl
adjusters left behind. Chief Clerk Day
and a lot of other recruits were quickly
mustered, and at 1:09 p. m. a. jolly squad
of forty-eight left the building.. No %en
eral orders as to destination, were issued,,
but the handy resort of Phil Crlmmins, at
Fifth and Market, was naturally in Mr.
Cole's mind. But the Coiner's force is
mainly composed of Democrats, who ;
froze fast to their jobs under Cleveland's
civil service administration, and near the
head of the procession was "Bull" Col
lins, late Democratic pillar of the Thirty
sixth District, and more of "the boys."
"Buck" Geggus, recently of the Mint, is
Just opening a saloon on Stockton street,
and the procession was skillfully and
easily guided there. Mr. Geggus' free
lunch was quickly destroyed and the new
Coiner received a vote of thanks.
Dan Cole has a presidential appoint
ment and a very nice job, but he will
have his troubles from his first day of
duty.
Twenty girls were discharged from the
Coiner's department yesterday and twen
ty new ones are ordered to report for

The coinage record: of trie San Francisco
Mint for August was . closed, yesterday,
and it is a phenomenal one, breaking all
the mint â¢ recoTds â¢of the United - States.
During August -the coinage amounted to
$8,160,000. This is at the rate of . nearly
000,000 a year. The Increase is due to
the great receipts of gold, the. normal Par
cine Coast receipts having been so largely
Increased by receipts .of gold, from .the.

DANNY NEEDHAM'S
WIFE SHOT AT
Three Bullets Whiz
Through a Window.
VICTIM OF A JEALOUS SUITOR
SHE HAS LONG LIVED IN FEAR
OF HER LIFE.
The Pugilist's Better Half Knows
Her Assailant, But at Present
Refuses Postively to
Nome Him.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Aug. 31.â Mrs. Danny
Needham was shot at late to-night, and
three shots whizzed past her as she was
preparliig to retire. She was standing In
a room in the rear of her home at; 671
Tenth street shortly before midnight
when several bullets were fired through
the window at her shadow on the window
shade. Two of them went close by her
arm and were buried In the mirror, and;
a third was Imbedded In the table on the
other side of the Intended victim^ ,
The murderous attacn. was not alto
gether a surprise to the wife: of the ex
pugilist, for e\er since her husband went
to the Klondike some months ago she has
been in fear Of her life. On some occa
sions she has been threatened by letter
and at other times; on the street by an in
fatuated lover named Louis Gillmeyer,
Whose advances she has persistently re
pulsed. : Some months ago Mrs. Needham
reported to the police that she was being
pursued by Gihmeyer, but she did noc
care to have the notoriety that must fol
low having her tormentor arrested.
This evening she was about to retire
and was In the dtning room in the rear of
the house on the lower floor. The window
was closed and the.: shade was down,
showing her shadow upon It. The would
be murderer aimed at the shadow, and
but for the fact that the lamp threw her
shadow. at an angle Mrs, Needham would
now be in the Morgue. The bullets went
all around her tout: did hot touch her, al
though one. grazed: her dress about the
â arm, ' ". /â¢.. ; ..' :..â â  ;
The shooting was heard .all over the
neighborhood, and Officer Hines was soon
at the house, but as there is a: vacant lot.
in the rear of the. little yardi it wafe very
: evident, that : the. assassin -had every op
portunity to make a quick escape. Officer!
Hines. went. into the house, and found the
three bullets; which are now .In trie v>uf
. session of the police, and. will be ..held as ]
evidence. They are badly flattened,;, ahd.
either one, had the shadow iic>t been.at Uri
angle, would have. 'caused .murder.. :
Mrs. Needham first told of her.: fears to
Officer Slahl three nrionths agoarid he ad
vised her to ewear out.a warrant; but she
hesitated. She said .'to-night that she is
confident she knows the man who tried
to murder her and says she;: will spe.nd
her last cent to bring him to; justice. She
declares there Is only one man who la
likely to have done such a deed, and al
though she will not positively mention his
name, she says she has no doubt in her
own mind.
Lotus Gillmeyer is about 25 years of
age and is the brother of a saloonkeeper.
