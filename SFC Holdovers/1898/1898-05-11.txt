MINISTERS WANT
PEACE, BUT DARE
NOT DEMAND IT
Spain's Cabinet Would Throw the
Responsibility of the War
Upon Parliament.
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, May 10.â It is only in
directly that attention is paid to the
progvess oi the war by the people
here. For the time being every one
is engrossed with consideration of I
the Ministerial crisis. Upon its solu
tion depends the immediate action of
Spain. If the Cabinet weathers the
storm it will emerge from it either
instructed to prosecute the war vig
orously or else empowered to take
steps for the re-establishment of
peace with the least possible delay.
From careful consideration of the
Cabinet's action ever since in- i
vestment with the powers of office,
it is more than probable â even mor
ally certainâ that the latter solution
would be more in accordance with its ;
members' personal desires. The ques
tion is, will they be able to follow
their desires? Their position is a
difficult one. They know only too
well that the longer war is prosecut
ed the more severe will be the loss
to Spain. It was perhaps their reali
zation of the nation's financial em- I
barrassment that made their efforts
for peace so decided as to call out
the accusation that they were ready
to accept it at any price â with dis
honor even â so long as war was
averted.
As it is only natural the Ministry
could not proclaim publicly in the â 
face of an enemy who was pushing it
to the â wall, more and more deter
mined as the negotiations continued,
that war for Spain meant ruin. Now
the opposition ij taunting them for
the reticence which was dictated by
the commonest patriotism, and in so
many words accusing them of having
entered into the war light-heartedly.
Nothing could be more unjust, nor
could anything throw a clearer light
upon the strength of political passion
in this country than this turning of
the danger which menaces the na- j
tion's very Â«xistence into a tool to
serve party ends.
It is manifest that the Government
is trying to throw the responsibility
for the continuance of the war on '.
Parliament. It is also manifest that
the opposition it trying to -jmbarra-ss
the Government by refusing to accept
that responsibility without, at the
same time, giving the Ministry any
ground for : aying, later, that peace
was concluded by the will of the na
tion's representatives and not by that
of the Government's party majority.
In fact, the position is this: The
opposition will not help the Govern
ment to secure peace, as later it may
overthrow the Liberals upon this
ground. Wn.ch of the two parties â j
the Ministerial or the opposition â :
will be stronger, is the one subject
of interest at present, and this is
why I say the progress of the war is
only indirectly occupying public at- ! '
tention. One thing is certain, there !
is growing a current feeling that to j
pursue this disastrous war, now that I '
it has been proved that, while Spain
courage is always equal to any test,
her financial, military and naval re
sources are inadequate to cope with Â«
an adversary so vastly her superior *
i s America, amounts simply to mad- i 1i 1
ness.
One of the most prominent bankers Â£
here said to me that to escape from j
total ruin is becoming more and more ,
difficult every day the war is pro- \ j
The San Francisco Call
i longed. People who talk about war
to the death are in general people
who run the least risk of dying or
even taking part in the war. They
are in Spain what the jingo Con
gressmen are in America â promoters
of trouble, with no danger to them
selves. But the people who have al
ready suffered in the short time the
war has been going on are beginning
to reflect that the man who can take
his dinner at the principal restaurant
of Madrid and who can drink his
favorite wine, still can afford to talk
; in a lofty strain about vindicating
national honor at the expense of the
last drop of his blood and his last
centime, but it is the working man
who finds n.mself confronted with
; the tangible proof of what war
means. In fact, he is already pay
ing about twice as much as formerly
for a loaf of bread, that plays such
an important role in his nourishment,
and is beginning to get desperate.
There have been explanations of the
! risings that have been and are still
taking place all over the country.
Laborer, mechanic, as well as trades
man understands the intricacies of
the problem, but he knows that life
is becoming impossible for him, and
it may be that it is even now very
near the point when the exporter of
every bag of grain becomas his
enemy, and the speculator who is
storing breadstuffs in hopes of a
further rise is a man to be dealt with
as a noxious reptile.
At Linares on Sunday a mob in
frenzy fired upon the civil guard,
who finally replied with a volley that
killed twelve, according to some re
ports, and several according to
others, and seriously wounding a

in Brenes Albacete, Albu.-ique, Oli
veniza, Villa Kobleda, Cartag \a,Ali-
cante, Ceuna, Palma, Villa Franca,
Ciudad- Heal and other places. Some
of these disorders amounted to little
more than noisy demonstrations, but
all indicate a spirit of desperation
due to the dearness of bread, and in
consequence a widespread misery
With the people in this excited state
it is comparatively an easy task for
the Carlist and Republican political
agitator to gain acceptance of the
most absurd theories. These agita
tions have naturally not been lack

disturbances is only the minor one
The real cause is stern suffering and

DON CARLOS
SUMMONS HIS
FOLLOWERS
The Pretender's Sympathizers in
America Ordered to Depart
for Europe.
NEW YORK, May 10.â Senor de la Costina, the American repre
sentative of Don Carlos, left New York last night to join his leader in
Europe. Before going Senor Costina said that his departure was due
to a summons from Don Carlos and that all the other American Car-
Hsts had already left or were about to leave to assist Doii Carlos in
his next effort to regain his throne. Senor Costina, according to the
Commercial Advertiser, said that, Judging from the events of the past
few days, Don Carlos would probably be established before he (Senor
Costina) arrived in Europe, but that in any event the presence of the
American Carlists was desired at this moment.
"With our knowledge of the United States and the American people
we will be able to advise Don Carlos as to the expediency and the '
best method of carrying on the present war. <
"It is possible, certainly," said Senor Costina, "that some way may <
be found to settle the difficulty when Don Carlos is King; the Ameri- â 
can Carlists will endeavor to bring this about. Should Don Carlos, Â«
however, consider that the honor of Spain or the interests of the Span- â¢
ish people would be compromised by a peace he will certainly carry the -
war on to the end. He will be in a better position to wage war than <
is the present Government. Besides his own immense fortune, which <
amounts to about $30,000,000, he inherited a large fortune from his first <
wife, and his present wife, too, is very rich. Besides this, he can com- <
mand the entire fortune of every Carlist in Spain, France or anywhere <
else. <
"Don Carlos is already forming his ministry, and although it is not <
yet completed, I can safely say that at least three of the Ministers <
have been decided on. The Marquis of Cerralba is to be President of <
the Council; General Weyler, Commander-in-Chlef of the Army, and <
Don Juan Vasquez de Mella, who was recently expelled from the Cortes, <
will occupy a high position, probably that of Secretary of State." <
rifles of the soldiers and for the Gat- '
ling and Hotchkiss quick-fire guns
were backed upon the tracks along the |
wharves, and the work of loading them
on board ship was commenced.
General Shafter spent most of the
afternoon at the port inspecting the
work, which will continue night and
day until completed. To-morrow each
transport will have mounted one or i
more of the Hotchkiss guns, while the
Gatlings which will be taken along will
be placed on the lower decks. The
Orizaba, now at the quarantine station
near Egmont Key, w r ill arrive here on
Thursday, and will be put into the slip
at once for coaling and loading sup
plies and ammunition. Soldiers and
officers are quietly preparing for orders ;
for the breaking of camp. Practically ]
all their belongings except such things
M are absolutely necessary have been ,
packed away, and when the orders
come but little will remain to be done ;
except to take down tents and load the
â wagons.
The mobilization of the State troops
at Tampa will commence to-morrow,
and by Thursday nearly a thousand
volunteers will be encamped here.
The ordering into Tampa from
Chickamauga of the Third and Sixth
cavalry regiments and all the infantry
regiments yet remaining there will
swell the total number of regulars at
this point to over 12,000 men, and, with
the State troops and the Cuban volun
teers, 16,000 soldiers will be encamped
here.
REPUBLICANS READY
TO FORM A GOVERNMENT.
An Assertion in Spain's Parliament
That Caused a Great Com
motion.
MADRID, May 10.â The Chamber of
Deputies had a prolonged sitting this
evening, with a view of passing the
current political measures, giving the
Government way to procure funds to
continue the war.
Senor Salmeron, the republican
leader, alluded to the rumors of the
Queen Regent's abdication, and de
clared the republicans were ready to
form a Government forthwith. His
remarks evoked a storm of protests,
and Senor Salmeron was unable to pro
ceed for fully ten minutes. Monarch
ists and republicans shrieked at each
other and bandied threats.
The president's voice was completely
drowned. When he finally obtained a
hearing, the president, Marquis Vega de
Armljo, requested Senor Salmeron to
withdraw the calumny. Senor Sal
meron refused, whereupon the presi
dent named him and threatened to
name him thrice if he continued his at
tacks upon the throne. As a result of
this caution and of the persistent mon
archist interruptions, Senor Salmeron
was compelled to desist.
Senor Sagasta, the Premier, then
rose and asserted that any one trying
to sow disunion among the Spaniards
when the nation was engaged in an in
ternational struggle was unworthy of
the name of Spaniard.
Senor Salmeron shouted, "I am a good
Spaniard."
This declaration was greeted with
monarchist shouts of "No, no; out with
him." Senor Sagasta appealed to the
patriotism of members and prayed the
House to vote the "funds so necessary
to conduct the war." His appeal was
greeted with the general cry, "We will
vote immediately."
Senor Silvela, leader of the dissident
conservatives, said his party would ab
stain from further discussion and was
ready to vote the urgent war funds im
mediately, but he claimed the right to
debate the other budget as such meas
ures.
TWO ATTEMPTS TO
POISON SOLDIERS.
Sacks Containing Cotton Saturated
With Arsenic Placed in the
Water.
ATLANTA, May 10.â A special to the
Constitution from Mobile says: A sec
i ond dastardly attempt to poison the in
j fantry regiments at Camp Mobile has
! been made. Six days ago some soldiers
found in the creek which runs along
side the grounds a sack filled with ab
sorbent cotton, which had been satu
rated with arsenic and tied down be
j neath a rock which juts out into the
i stream at a point just above the place
where the soldiers get their drinking
water. By accident a trooper detected
the trap, removed the sack and upon
j the contents being revealed, reported
his find to the commanding officer.
! Strict orders were given not to mention
| the incident and so the matter was
| hushed up. Since that day, however,
j the creek has been closely watched and
! vigilance was rewarded when Corporal
John Sullivan of Company a. Ninetenth
Infantry, found a poison bag loaded
with arsenic and anchored down just
as in the first instance.
The officers will not discuss the mat
te: , but among the privates, feeling is
running high, and they do not fail to
exp ess themselves. Spanish spies are
lnown to be lurking in the neighbor
hood, where a number of Spaniards re
side. They are all under strict scru
tiny.
Movements of the Temerario.
NEW YORK. May 10.â The Teme
rario arrived to-day at Maldonado, a
Uruguayan port on the Atlantic, and
Bailed immediately, direction unknown.
NEW PLAN
ALREADY
OUTLINED
Quick and Vigorous Blows Ex
pected to Terminate the
War.
Congressmen Discussing the Disposition
of Cuba, Porto Rico and the
Philippines.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 10.
It was assumed in these
dispatches last night that the
Cape Verde fleet was yet on
the other side of the Atlantic,
and that based upon such as
sumption, if not upon actual
knowledge of its where
abouts, the department would
direct Admiral Sampson to
commence the bombardment
of the batteries of San Juan,
Porto Rico.
Dispatches were to-night
sent to Sampson via Port au
Prince, Hayti, informing him
that reports to the State De
partment finally located the
Spanish fleet at Cadiz, and for
him to commence operations
against the batteries imme
diately. The President, Sec
retary Long, all of the Cabi
net and army and navy offi
cials were greatly relieved
when, about 3 o'clock this
afternoon, reliable advices
from Madrid stated that the
Cape Verde fleet of seven
vessels had returned to Ca
diz. Not because the fleet Is
feared, but because the un
certainty as to its where
abouts has prevented the
formation or execution of any
well defined plans for either
the army or navy.
But now that it is defi
nitely ascertained that
the Spanish war vessels
are on the other side of
the Atlantic and could
not cross within ten or
twelve days' time this
Government will strike
vigorous blows from
which Spain will be un
able to recover.
In the first place San
Juan is to be taken. This
will not be a difficult
matter for the powerful
vessels in Sampson's
squadron.
The city of San Juan is on
a promontory, standing out
into the sea. The entrance to
the anchorage is narrow, but
the water is navigable to ves
sels of large tonnage. The
city is surrounded with walls,
and a reef of half-sunken
rocks, extending over about
two-thirds of the whole cir
cumference, makes another
barrier. The walls are solid,
but would very easily yield
to modern ordnance. Until
early in last year the only
battery of any consequence
was a new one placed toward
the east coast, designed ap
parently to protect the city
from anticipated attack on
the land side. The battery
mounts several Krupp guns
of medium caliber. It is be
lieved that several more of
these are mounted in Morro
Castle at the other end of the
town. The remainder of the
ordnance in San Juan along
the walls until very recently
was of a very obsolete pat
tern and guile unserviceable.
When the batteries have
been reduced several of the
vessels in Admiral Sampson's
fleet will be left to harass the
Spaniards if they attempt to
remount their big guns. With
the other vessels he will re
turn to Havana, and by this
time 60,000 or more regular
and volunteer troops will
have been landed in Cuba at
a point known only to the
War Department.
Blanco will be called
upon to surrender Ha
vana under penalty of
having the city shelled.
He will, of course, send
a defiance as his an
swer. The batteries at
Morro and Santa Clara
and other fortifications
will then be bombarded
and reduced, and if
Blanco still refuses to
yield Havana will be
shelled by our fleet,
while th c American
troops and the insur
gents attack from the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
rear. This is the plan as
outlined by an army of
ficer to-day, and he is
confident that Havana
will be taken before
June 1.
If the combined Spanish
fleet crosses the Atlantic to
Blanco's relief Sampson, re
enforced by Captain Schley
and his flying squadron, as
well as the magnificent bat
tle-ship Oregon, the Marietta
and the Nictheroy, will meet
and destroy it before it arrives
off Porto Rico.
In the minds of naval offi
cers there is not the slightest
doubt of the outcome of such
a battle royal on the high seas.
In the two American fleets
there will be sixty-four war
vessels, battie-ships of all
kinds, viz.â battle-ships, pro
tected and unprotected cruis
ers, monitors, torpedo boats,
gunboats, rams and one dyna
mite hurier.
The combined Spanish ar
mada would contain one
formidable battle-ship and a
large number of first-class ar
mored cruisers equal to our
second-class battle-ships. In
addition to these there would
be six torpedo boats and six
destroyers.
Practically the entire reg
ular army will invade Cu
ba, and it is believed that
20,000 of them will be
landed on Saturday or Sun
day. They will be under
the general command of Gen
eral Miles, who leaves for the
South to-morrow, but active
operations in the field will be
personally directed by Gen
eral Shafter.
. The determination of the
President and his Cabinet to
send such an immense body
of troops to invade Cuba in
stead of a mere handful to
convoy provisions, arms and
ammunition to the insurgents
and to establish a base of
supplies, was influenced by2
the following considerations:
First, to follow up the Ma
nila victory with a blow at
Havana that will speedily
terminate the war.
Second, to drive Blanco's
troops from Cuba before the
rainy season, so deadly to un
acclimated troops, sets in.
Third, a growing impres
sion that the insurgent troops,
while capable enough in the
defensive or guerrilla warfare,
are disorganized and not dis
ciplined for aggressive war
fare such as the siege of Ha
vana will be.
Taking it for granted that
within a few weeks Spain
will have yielded, after hav
ing lost the Philippines, Porto
Rico and Cuba, Congressmen
are busily engaged in dispos
ing of the several islands in
this way:
Cuba is to be handed over
to the insurgents, as a free
and independent State.
The Philippines to be re
tained by the United States
for their commercial as well
as strategic value.
Forto Rico will be kept by
Uncle Sam for a coaling sta
tion, which we have so long
coveted in the West Indies.
SPAIN'S NAVY MUST
BE ANNIHI'ATED.
With This Accomplished It Is Be
lieved Enduring Peace Will
Come.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â It is hard
to tell whether the naval officers were
relieved or disappointed by the news
that came late this afternoon to both
the Navy and State departments to the
affect that the Spanish flying squadron
had arrived at Cadiz, Spain. The safety
of the Oregon from attack is now com
pletely assured and the way is clear
for military operations in Cuba, with
out running the risk of having the oc
cupying army's line of communication
cut off. On the other hand it is be
lieved that no enduring peace can be
secured until the Spanish navy has
been destroyed, and it now appears
that to do this our sailors must make
up their minds to go after the Span
ish, a task very much more difficult
than that of meeting them near our
own shores.
It was suggested by some of the
members of the War Board that there
was Just a possibility that the Spanish
squadron might take a quick passage
into the Pacific through the Suez canal
and attack Dewey at Manila. It is
said that, contrary to the common un
derstanding, the Suez canal is open to
the warships of belligerent powers, and
that if the Spanish choose to take this
course they will have a long start
of any pursuing fleet from our side of
the Atlantic. It is scarcely believed,
however, that the Spanish are willing
to take the great risk of exposing to
our attack their own home ports by
the withdrawal of so considerable a
proportion of their naval strength as
would be required to overmatch Dewey.
Nothing was heard from Sampson to
day, but there is a confident expecta
tion that interesting news will be com
ing from his squadron within the next
twenty-four hours. Whether this means
an attack on Porto Rico or not can
not be learned.
One effect of the retreat of the Span
ish fleet has been to hasten even mora
the preparations already under full
headway for the dispatching of mili
tary expeditions to Cuba. It also has
caused a complete change in the conÂ»
centration plans. Time is now be
lieved to be the great factor. There
Is no longer any opportunity to indulge
in extensive drilling and- practice ma
neuvering. The regular army troops
do not need these and are to be thrown
at once into the fray.
- Many of the regiments of the Na
tional Guard which are entering the
yolunteer service are felt to be suffi
ciently trained from a military point of
view to follow the regulars immedi
ately, and the department indicated its
purpose to-day of dispatching these
volunteer troops to the gulf coast for
shipment Instead of sending them to
Ch ickamauga.
This disposition was shown by the
changes In the new orderÃ issued to the
troops, although there may be a return
to the original programme of concen
tration if the plans show signs of weak
ness as they develop. The quartermas
ter-general has already got under
charter 27 merchant steamers for the
transportation of the troops, and,
roughly speaking, these should carry
about 20,000 men. Others are being pro
cured as rapidly as possible.
The plan of the War Department Is
to have these vessels assemble at the
different gulf ports, Tampa, Mobile, New
Orleans and Galveston, to take on
troops which will be sent there. The
Navy Department Is expected to fur
nish convoys to the transports, which
would be absolutely helpless against
Spanish attack. At this point there are
signs of friction. First the transports-)
will be obliged to await Admiral Samp- I
eon's return in order to secure proper !
c nvoy, and secondly, the navy objects
very decide* 1 *- to undertaking the task
of convoying s. number of transports.
It insists that to assure the safety of
the convoy of the troops all the trans- f
ports should be gathered in one fleet
to start from Tampa, and the navy is
likely to prevail in this.
Now that Major-Goneral Sewell has
be<*n assigned to command the concen
tration camp at Falls Church, prepara
tions are beln â¢â¢ rushed to put the
grounds there into shape for the recep
tion of the volunteers.
NO CONFIRMATION OF
THE RETREAT TO CADIZ.
LONDON, May 10.â There is no con
firmation of the report that the Span
ish fleet from the Cape Verde Islands
has returned to Cadiz, but It is gen
erally regarded as the most likely
movement to be made, and as an indi
cation that Spain has decided to let
her West Indian possessions go.
The question is generally asked:
"What possible use has Spain for con
linuing a hopeless struggle, as it is con
sidered next to impossible that she has
my alternative plan or that the re
reat of the squadron hides some strat
sgic design."
WARRANT FOR
WARDEN AULL
Sacramento's First Blow
for a Pure "Water
Supply.
Prison Official to Be Arrested
at the Instance of Trustee
Paine.
Will Test the Law's Power to Pre
vent the Pollution of m. Stream
by Sewage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. May 9.â To test the
power of the civil authorities to prevent
the pollution of American River by
sewage from Folsom Prison, a warrant
will be issued to-morrow for the arrest
of Warden Aull. The warrant would
have been issued to-night but for the ab
sence of the District Attorney. It will
be sworn to by City Trustee Paine.
The State Board of Health will join
The Call in its efforts to procure for the
people of Sacramento a remedy against
thÂ£ evil now threatening them. Doctor
Matthews, a member of the State
Board, in speaking of the crusade
against the pollution of the Ameri
can River said to-day:
"I am pleased to see the stand taken
by The Call in this matter of river de
filement. It is a service the people will
some day appreciate, if they do not
now. There is no subject before the
people to-day more vital than this one
involving the purity of the water used
for drinking purposes in municipalities.
I am credibly informed that there are
more cases of typhoid fever in Sacra
mento than have ever been known here
before, and I am not surprised at it,
when such practices prevail as those
described in The Call. The State Board
of Health stands ready to aid in seek
ing deliverance for the people of Sac
ramento from the peril which is threat
ening them."
When asked what remedy he would
apply the doctor answered: "There is
a State statute which covers the ground
and in my opinion should be invoked.
The authorities at Folsom should be
held amenable, and if they have no
means of caring for their sewage, the
Board of Examiners, in conjunction
with the Prison Board, should make
some arrangements whereby the money
could be raised to construct such a sew
age plant as the Warden has recom
mended. There was a bill introduced
at the last session of the Legislature
which failed to pass. This bill, I be
lieve, provided for an appropriation of
$15,000. Now, if it requires that amount
it should certainly be secured in some
way. How can you expect the board to
enforce sanitary regulations against
cities, towns and private individuals,
when the State itself maintains a nui
sance more dangerous than all the oth
ers combined?
"Any citizen can ask the enforcement
of that law I have spoken of, and the
District Attorney of Sacramento would
no doubt gladly see that the law was
enforced if his attention should be
called to it. You may say that the
State Board of Health has declared the
sewage of the prison at Folsom a men
ace to the public health, and whatever
evidence the District Attorney may re
quire will be furnished by. members of
the board."
Frank D. Ryan, the District Attorney
of Sacramento County, when asked if
the law could not be invoked against
the Warden of the prison, replied that
it could, and if any reputable citizen
would bring the complaint he would
prosecute the persons arrested just as
he would any other person charged
with a violation of the law. Mr. Ryan
said he had succeeded in convicting
private citizens of violations of the
section referred to. There had been
one case in the Superior Court where
he had convicted a person for dumping
a dead animal into the American River.
TO COMMAND THE
CONCENTRATION CAMP.
An Indication That General Sewell
Will Accept His Military Com
mission.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â Major Gen
eral Sewell has been assigned to com
mand the concentration camp near
Falls Church, Va. This is taken as an
indication that the general has con
cluded to accept his military commis
sion, risking his tenure of office as a
Senator thereby. The order issued from
the War Department to-day reads as
follows:
The following-named officers should be
ordered to report to the adjutant-general
for duty with the troops to go into camp
at Washington, D. C. : Major-General
Sewell and Brigadier-Generals Poland,
Kent. Young, RandaJl, Schwan and J. C.
Bates.
None of the corps commanders have
yet been assigned finally, although the
entire list of commands has been pre
pared. The three civilian major gen*
erals are not to receive such commands,
but are assigned to divisions, Generals
Lee, Wilson and Wheeler going to
Chattanooga for duty and General
Brooke will undoubtedly command one
of the army corps.
The War Department officials ad
mitted to-day that all the regular
troops now at Chickamauga had been
ordered away. They refuse most posi
tively, however, to tell the destination
of the troops, contending that to do so
would be simply to invite attacks by
Spanish naval vessels upon the trans
ports which will convey them.
The volunteers will take up the camps
abandoned by the regulars In Chick
amauga Park. Nine of the new brig
adier generals have been assigned to
duty under Major General Brooke and
will "lick the raw recruits into shape"
at Camp George H. Thomas. They are
Brigadier-Generals Briggs, Compton,
Burt, Sumner, Henry, Lawton, Chaffee
and Davis. Brigadier Schwan, one of
the brigadier-generals assigned to duty
at the Washington concentration camp,
is at present principal aid to Adjutant
General Corbin and has just been pro
moted to the rank of brigadier general.

BELMONT'S
OFFER TO
UNCLE SAM
Will Lend a Swift Dynamite
Torpedo Boat During
the War.
The Only Condition Is That the
Patriotic Millionaire Be Placed
in Command.
NEW YORK, May 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Mr.
Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont of New
York has offered to lend the Govern
ment a dynamite torpedo-boat, provid
ed he be permitted to command it dur
ing the war with Spain. His propo
sition was carefully considered this af
ternoon by the Naval Board of Con
struction, and as a result a letter was
submitted to Secretary Long, suggest
ing that the offer was patriotic and
should be accepted. The Secretary's de
cision will be announced within the
next few days.
If the Secretary accepts Mr. Bel
mont's proposition, work will at once
commence on the proposed boat at the
Crescent shipbuilding yard, at Ellza
bethport, N. J. Mr. Nixon, repre
senting the Crescent Shipbuilding Com
pany, explained Mr. Belmont's ideas to
the Construction Board. The boat will
be very similar to the Rodgers, now on
blockade duty in Cuban waters. It
will have a displacement of 150 tons,
will be about 160 feet in length and 10
feet beam, and wlllhave\a draught of
five feet. Its armament will consist
of dynamite guns, built under plans
prepared by Mr. Nixon. These guns
will be able to fire large shells loaded
with high explosives, and it is declared
that no danger will be experienced.
Small charges of powder will be em
ployed, so arranged as to burn slowly
when first discharged and to gradu
ally quicken its consumption In order
to generate a large body of gas with
out shock to the explosive in the pro
jectile. It Is appreciated that consid
erable elevation will have to be given
the guns in order that they may fire a
satisfactory distance.
Mr. Belmont's proposed boat will be
"DEPORT OTIS TO MANILA,"
SAYS THE LOBOR WORLD.
LOS ANGELES, May 10.â The prospective appointment of H. G.
Otis as brigadier general of volunteers is regarded by the citizens of
this place generally as one of the worst moves the administration
could possibly make. Otis is not popular here and never has been.
The people of this city know him thoroughly and know that he does
not possess a single qualification which fits him to hold the position.
Organized labor is opposed to Otis to a man. At a meeting of the
County Council, which will be held to-morrow evening, strong resolu
tions will be adopted in relation to Otis' appointment. Senators White
and Perkins will be held personally responsible if Otis is named.
Speaking of Otis' appointment the Labor World, the organ of the
working men of this city, says:
"There has been some talk of Otis being appointed to the position
of military governor 6f Manila. As far as organized labor is con
cerned, this would be a satisfactory appointment, for the labor unions
could then say, with subtle ambiguity, that
"He left his country for his country's good.
"To have authority over a horde of semi-civilized mongrels wbuld
suit the peculiar genius of Otis and afford him a field for the exer
cise of the latent Weyler in his nature. To be able to back up his
authority with cannon is Just what Otis would like. By all means
deport him to Manila."
fast, her speed being twenty-six knots
an hour. This is better than the Rod
gers can do. Mr. Belmont desires to
command her, but he will expect the
navy to place on board a regular blue
jacket crew and an executive officer
who will be an officer of the service.
He believes that the boat will be use^
ful either against shore batteries or
against armored ships.
It was estimated by the department
officials to-day that the cost of such a
boat as Mr. Bolmont proposes to con
struct will be in the neighborhood or
$100,000. Hi 3 proposition specially
states that he does not intend to give
the vessel to the Government, but will
lend it during the existence of the war
between the United States and Spain.
DRUNKEN SPANIARD
AT MARE ISLAND.
Wants to Visit the Yard, but Con-
eludes It Would Be Better

VALLiEJO, May 10.â A drunken I
Spaniard, claiming to be an American i
citizen, who expressed a loud desire to |
enlist in the United States navy and !
indulged in lower asides to the effect j
that the Spaniards were a brave peo- :
pie, created a disturbance on the |
Southern Pacific wharf this afternoon ,
by his Insistence in a purpose to go
across to the navy yard. A Jack tar,
who cheerfully drank with the Span
lard in the saloon at the end of the
wharf, succeeded flnall- in discourag
ing the Spaniard in his purpose, but
not until there had been an exchange
of strong language and a rather too
free use of the ugly little word "spy"
to please the man of Spanish extrac
tion.

REDDING, May 10.â Judge Chauncey
A. Horr, 71 years of age and a para
lytic, a few years ago came into pos
session of a small fortune in Bloom
ington, Illinois. The income from his
property was sent to him by Eastern
relatives through Judge Aaron Bell of
this city. The aged man was boarding
and lodging at the home of Mrs.
Chance, a widow living on California
street in this city.
A few days ago Judge Bell got word
from his client's relatives In the East
that a deed had been placed on record
in Bloomington, transferring title to
nineteen acres of valuable land, the
consideration being "love and affec
tion." Upon receipt of this informa
tion Judge Bell at once applied for let
ters of guardianship on the ground of
his client's incompetency.
On Monday night, while Judge Bell's
petition was still pending in court, City
Attorney Braynard, the notary who
had certified the gift deed, went to the
County Clerk's office and procured a
marriage license for Judge Horr and
Mrs. Chance from Clerk Cunningham,
who had been absent from the office
and knew nothing of the application
for guardianship. When County Clerk
Drynan returned he at once notified his
deputy of the true state of affairs.
Clerk Cunningham hurried to the home
of Mrs. Chance to forbid the cere
mony. He found that Rev. J. B. Hart
sough, an aged man, had been sum
moned to officiate at the wedding, but
had refused to proceed when he saw
the helpless condition of the prospec
tive groom. Judge Bell arrived later
and took his client away from the
Chance house.
The affair has created a sensation
here and an investigation is now under
way. ______________ _____
STEAMSHIP BRATZBERG
STILL A WAR PRIZE.
Case of the Norwegian Vessel Will
Be Settled Without Interna
tional Complications.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 10.â The Nor
wegian steamer Bratzberg, which ar
rived this morning under the convoy of
the Mangrove, is still a prize of war,
pending the decision of the United
States on the question. The affair
bears many features of resemblance to
that of the French steamer Lafayette,
but, like that case, it will be settled
without any international complica
tions.
About two weeks ago the Bratzberg
bound from Progreso, Mexico, for Ha
vana with 800 head of cattle, was
warned off the Cuban coast by the
blockading fleet. She put into this
port and remained a couple of days,
when she sailed, ostensibly for New
York to find a market for the cattle.
She was piloted out of this harbor
April 27, and was not seen again until
yesterday morning, when the gunboat
Newport sighted her about twenty-five
miles off Havana. Captain Tilley
knew she had once been warned out,
and, observing that she was floating
easy and with cattle pens apparently
empty, he hailed and boarded her. Cap
tain Thorson stoutly denied that he
was attempting to slip past the block
ade, but he cou!d not satisfactorily ex
plain the disposition of his cargo and
was sent in under the Mangrove's es
cort.
NEW YORK, May 11, 12:80 a. m.â The
Norwegian steamer Bratzbenr. brousrht
in here yesterday, will be released.
United States District Attorney Strip
ling said to-night that she could not be
held.
OFHCERS WHO ARE
PHYSICALLY DISQUALIFIED.
Some Accepted by Special Dispensa
tion, but They Cannot Expect
Pensions.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â The War
Department officials to-night authorized
the statement that no orders have been
issued to mustering officers directing
that they accept all regimental officers
of volunteer troops appointed by Gov
ernors of States, regardless of physical
disabilities. In a few cases, where
Governors were particularly anxious to
commission certain officers who ordi
narily would be rejected on the ground
of physical disability, the mustering of
ficers have been instructed to accept
the services of the officers; but In each
case a special dispensation has been re
quired and a special notation of the dis
ability has been made for the benefit
of the Government. Hereafter it will
be difficult for the officers so accepted
to secure a pension, as they will have
to show clearly that the disability for
which the pension may be asked Was
due to their service in the present war.
War Department officials are very
much averse to the acceptance of any
men or officers who are not perfectly
sound physically and the exceptions
that have been made were in the face
of protests of the department.

Troops Being Concentrated
for the Invasion of
Cuba.
General Miles Will Superintend the
Embarkation and May Lead
the First Expedition.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 10.
By Friday morning the commanding
general of the United States army,
Major General ? tiles, will have assem
bled his staff around him at Tampa,
Fla. He leaves Washington to-morrow
night, taking with him Colonel Mich
ler, Colonel Maus, Colonel Greenl^af,
Major Osgood, Major Humphreys, Cap
tain Seyburn and Captain Scott. Only
one member of the staff. Captain Davis,
â¢will remain ; t headquarters and he
â¢will follow the general within two or
three days or as soon as he can turn
over the care of the business at army
headquarters to an officer to be desig
nated for that duty. Unless plans are
changed the r neral will go with the
first military expedition force to Cuba,
He is not expected to relieve the ma- i
jor generals already selected for the
conduct of the campaign, b" both in
Florida and in Cuba will exercise the
same general superintendence over the
campaign that h now does from his
headquarters in Washington.
.he arrangements for the move upon
Cuba are being hastened with such en- |
ergy that it is evident to any observer
that the beginning of the campaign is
imminent. It is expected here that
within a week the first troops will be
on their way from the United States to
Cuba. The only delay will arise in the
difficulty of securing the necessary
number of transports and the Quarter
master's Department is making great
efforts to assemble a sufficient number
of these ships at the gulf ports in time
to receive the troops, who are even now
on their way there. Orders have been
given for 10.0 CO hammocks to be fur
nished for the army and to be de
livered, beginning immediately, within
the next fortnight. Experts have re
ported that a hammock Is an absolute
necessity in a Cuban campaign. It is
the only means to escape the vermin
which otherwise make sleep Impossible
to the soldier and it is the only way he
can escape the fatal moisture of the
damp, rich soil.
Engineers from the War Department
met in the neighborhood of Falls Church
and located definitely the great camp
upon which will be concentrated from
36,000 to 40,000 United States troops
within the next week or two. This
tract embraces about 1400 acres of
splendid land, well watered and wood
ed, and will afford accommodations for
all the soldiers comprised within the
President's first order.
Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn to
day chartered about thirty ships, with
a capacity for 25,000 men. They are to
be used to convey troops to Cuba and
the Philippines.
The following is a list of vessels
which have been chartered by the War
Department to be used as transports
to Cuba and the Philippines and for
other purposes: Mallory lineâ San Mar
cos Conchi, Rio Grande and Leona;
Ward lineâ Vigilance, Seguaranca, Ori
zaba, Yucatan, Seneca, Saratoga, San
Diego, City of Washington and Man
teo- Miami Steamship CompanyâMat
tewan; William P. Clyde & Co.âCher
okee and Iroquois; Oceanic Steamship
Company â Australia; Pacific Mail
Steamship Companyâ City of Sydney.
It is understood at the War Depart
ment that important changes are con
templated in the points of moblizing
th â  volunteer army. Fewer troops than
contemplated w. - be sent to Chicka
mauga, it being the desire of the de
partment to concentrate them further
south. Many of the Western troops
originally intended for the East will be
â¢sent to California, and general changes
may be made in the scheme of mobil
ization.
TAMPA, Fla., May 10.â The Gussie
sailed for Cuba shortly after 1 p. m.
with two companies of United States
troops.
At 1 p. m. orders came for the de
parture of the Gussie, and shortly after
?he cast loose from her moorings and
started on her long Journey south a
large crowd of soldiers had gathered on
the docks to see their comrades depart,
and as the beat steamed slowly away
hearty chefrs were sent after the for
tunate boys in blue on her decks.
CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK
(Ga ) May 10.â Major-General Brooke,
commanding the United Stat# regular
provisional army corps at Chickamauga
Park, to-day received orders from the
War Department directing him to send
all the cavalry and infantry troops now
in camp at Chickamauga Park, about
6000 in all, to Tampa, Fla., without de
lay.
The order is accompanied with In
structions to provide the men with a
full supply of ammunition for sixty
days. There are five regiments of in
fantry now in camp â the Second, Sev
enth, Eighth, Twelfth and Sixteenth â
all of which are ordered to Tampa un
der command of Colonel Guy V. Henry
and Colonel A. R. Chaffee.
Two regiments of cavalryâ the Third
and Sixthâ will at once proceed to
Tampa under General S. S. Sumner.
These troops will march from the park
to Ringgold to-morrow afternoon and
take the Western and Atlantic train
at that point. The distance Is about
eight miles and it has been decided
that this march could be relieved by
the Chattanooga, Rome and Southern,
po that they could move the infantry
with more dispatch.
The Second Cavalry, under Colonel
Hunt, has been ordered to Mobile, and
they will march to Rossville and be
loaded on the Southern at that point.
The First and Tenth cavalry will go
to New Orleans under command of the
senior officer, Colonel Baldwin, march
ing to this city and taking the Ala
bama Great Southern here to-morrow
afternoon.
All regiments began preparations to
move to-night, and by morning it is
expected each regiment will be ready
to move. General Brooke and staff
remain here to assist in the organi
sation of the volunteer army, should it
*be ordered here. The signal corps has
also been ordered to remain here until
further orders.
The medicel corps of each regiment
was to-day provided with medical sup
plies for sixty days. The medical force
la .to be Increased from fifteen to
[ twenty-five men as soon as the regl
! ments have been increased to their war
: strength. All recruits will be ordered
! to report to Tampa, New Orleans and
i Mobile. A large number arrived to
day and were provided with the neces
sary equipments.
There will be very little delay In
transporting the troops, all the rail
roads having provided the necessary
cars in expectation of hurry orders. ThÂ«>
loading of the supply trains began this
afternoon and a number are ready foi
shipment.
The Second and the Seventh Infantry
will leave in the morning at 6 o'clock,
and the Eighth and Sixteenth Infantry
to-morrow afternoon. The Twelfth may
not get off until Saturday morning.
Owing to the unexpected orders to
move received to-day General Brooks
made a hurried reorganization of the
infantry forces, annulling a division
heretofore formed.
An order immediately followed form
ing the Fifth, Twelfth and Sixteenth
regiments of infantry into a brigade
to be commanded by Colonel Guy V.
Henry, Fred A Smith, assistant adju
tant general, and Lieutenant Stafford
of the Eighth Regiment, brigade quar
termaster. This brigade is ordered to
proceed at once, "fully equipped for
field service, to Tampa, and report to
the general commanding at that point."
The same order also formed the Seo
ond and Seventh Infantry into a bri
gade. Brigadier General A. R. Chaffee
in command, who is also ordered to
proceed as early as possible with hia
brigade to Tampa.
The quartermaster's department has
been completely overrun during the af
ternoon, as each regiment commander
had been ordered to report at once as
to the number of men in each com
mand, estimates of their necessities,
etc.. for sixty days' rations, ammunnl
nltion, supplies, etc., so that these
might be issued without delay.
Quartermaster General Lee stated to
night, however, that he has everything
in his department in readiness for the
departure of the troops at once. In re
ply to a query to-night Adjutant Gen
eral Sheridan stated that before Fri
day night all the troops will have been
moved south;
DEWEY'S FLEET WINS
A VERY RICH BOUNTY.
By the Destruction of the Spanish
Vessels About $187,000 Is Se
cured for Distribution.
NEW YORK, May 10. â A dispatch to
the Times from Washington says:
Rear Admiral Dewey and his men will
not have been fully rewarded for the
victory at Manila when they receive
the thanks of Congress and the medals
ordered to be struck for them. Under
the law they have become entitled to a
rich bounty. Unless the numerical im
portance of the fleet of Admiral Montijo
has been overestimated and its losses
overstated, the officers and men of the
Asiatic squadron will be entitled to
share among themselves something like
$187,000 bounty money.
According to the reports from Manila,
the Spanish fleet destroyed by the
Americans consisted of ten or eleven
cruisers, gunboats and torpedo-boats,
with crews amounting in all to 1872
men. At $100 for each man of the Span
ish naval force, accr/rding to the bounty
law, the amount to be divided among
the American sailors will be $187,200.
The $187,200 will be distributed to the
fleet under section 4631 of the Revised
Statutes, relating to prize money. Ad

PRAYERS FOR PEACE AND
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
WASHINGTON, May 10.â The Archbishops of the Catholic church In
the United States have agreed upon a letter addressed to the clergy
and laity of the country. The letter bears on the war with Spain and
will be read in all the churches on Sunday. It is indorsed by Mgr.
Martinelli, the Apostolic Delegate, and is as follows:
"To the Clergy and Laity of the Catholic Church of the United
States â Greeting: The events that have succeeded the blowing up of
the battle-ship Maine and the sacrifice of 266 innocent victimsâ the pa
triotic seamen of the United Statesâ have culminated in war between
Spain and our own beloved country.
"Whatever may have been the individual opinions of Americans
prior to the declaration of war, there can now be no two opinions as
to the duty of loyal Americans. A resort to arms was determined
upon by the executive of the nation with the advice of both houses
of Congress and after consultation with his Cabinet officers, but not
until every effort had been exhausted to bring about an honorable
and peaceful solution of our difficulties with Spain. The patient
calmness, the dignified forbearance, the subdued firmness of Presi
dent McKinley during the trying time that intervened between the
destruction of the Maine and the declaration are beyond all praise
and should command the admiration of every true American. We,
the members of the Catholic church, are true Americans, and as
such are loyal to our country and our flag and obedient to the high
est decrees and the supreme authority of the nation.
"We are not engaged in a war of section against section, or of
State against State, but we are united as one man against a foreign
enemy and a common foe. If, as we are taught by our holy church,
love of country is next to love of God, a duty imposed upon us by all
laws, human and divine, then it is our duty to labor and to pray for
the temporal and spiritual well being of the brave soldiers who are
battling for our beloved country. Let us faithfully beg the God of Bat
tles to crown their arms on land and sea with victory and triumph,
and to stay unnecessary effusion of blood, and speedily to restore
peace to our beloved land and people.
"To this end we direct that on and after the receipt of this circular
and until the close of the war every priest shall, in his daily mass,
pray for the restoration of peace by glorious victory for our flag. We
also direct that prayers for the brave soldiers and sailors that fall in
battle may be said every day after mass. These prayers shall be
said aloud with the people, and shall be, 'Our Father" and one 'Hail,
Mary' and the 'De Profundis."
"We pray that God may bless and preserve our country In this
great crisis and speedily brine victory, honor and peace to all our
people."

VICE-ADMIRAL MONTIJO.
MONTIJO SAID
TO HAVE BEEN
PUT TO DEATH
Report That the Spanish Adn)iral
Was SlaiQ by the Populace
of Manila.
LONDON, Mst 10.â A special dispatch from Shanghai says it is re
ported there that Admiral Montijo, the commander of the Spanish
fleet, who escaped from Cavite by running along the shore to Manila
with his two sons, was killed by the populace of the latter place.
It is added that the hospital of San Rogue. filled with Spanish
soldiers, was set on fire by shells from the Boston and that Sisters
of Charity were killed while removing the wounded.
Massacres are reported to have occurred outside of Manila, the
insurgents butchering even the Spanish women and children.
HONGKONG, May 10.â A fresh example of Spanish treachery seems
to have come to light. It is said here that the priests and Sisters of
Charity of the Cavite hospital, in a procession bearing crosses, etc., pe
titioned Rear Admiral Dewey not to massacre the sick and wounded,
which, naturally, he did not do. The Spaniards, it is asserted, there
upon thanked the Americans for their humanity and repaid them by
informing them of a narrow channel, which, they said, waa not mined,
while the broad channel, they explained, was fully mined. An investi
gation on the part of the Americans, however, revealed the contrary to
be the case and the mines were blown up by the sailors of the Ameri
can fleet.
Roar Admiral Dewey, it is said here, finds the Insurgents growing
dangerous. It is added that he cannot control them, nor can he en
able the Spaniards to do bo. There Is one Japanese warship at Ma

the whole amount of bounty money
awarded to his command. That will
give him $9300. If he has a floet cap
tain, or what passes for one. the latter
will' have a share of something like
$1800. There will be left to be distrib
uted to the vessels of the fleet, accord
ing to their payrolls, about $175,000.
This will go to seven ships, and in
about the following shares: Olympia,
$45 000- Baltimore. $40,000; Boston, $25.
000- Raleigh, $22,000; Concord, $20,000;
Petrel $12,000; McCulloch, $9000.
To the commander of each single ves
sel there will go one-tenth of the
amount assigned to that vessel. After
the amounts mentioned have been de
ducted, the residue will be distributed
to the lesser officers and seamen of the
ships in proportion to their rates of pay
on the day of the engagement. The
amount to each seaman, it Is believed,
will be in the neighberhood of $50.
GENERAL BLANCO'S URGENT
REQUEST FOR SUPPLIES.
MADRID, May 10.â The Government
Intends to insist that the Cortes sit
continuously until the war measures
are adopted. The Minister of Finance,
! Senor Puigceiver, declared that until
: the credits were voted it was impossl
1 ble to meet the demands for ammuni-
I tion and provisions for Cuba, Porto
j Rico, the Balearic Islands and the
; Canary Islands, or to establish the ne
i cessary stocks of coal.
Captain-General Blanco has cabled
an urgent request for considerable sup
plies of provisions, which the Govern
ment cannot dispatch until the Cortes
have voted the war measures.
The authorities here are greatly con
cerned about the provisions for this
city. It is estimated that the stock of
wheat will be consumed inside of a
month and measures are being taken

Case Against J. J. Lakin and Wife of
San Rafael to Be Dropped.
SAN RAFAEL, May 10.â For reasons
[ best known to himself. District Attorney
Martlnelll intends to dismiss all the
charges in the famous Lakin-Gllleran
controversy. Botfl J. J. Lakin and his
wife were arrested o-n charges preferred
by Mrs. Michael Gilleran, the first for
disturbing 1 the peace and the second for
assault and battery. Mrs. Gilleran also
made an affidavit containing some sensa
tional charges about the alleged brutal
treatment of a partially demented brother
of Mrs. Lakin. With regard to this story,
J. J. Lakin Pays:
"Mrs. Gilleran's story is inspired by
animosity. She rented one of my cot
tages and got in arrears in payment, and
though we let her keep her furniture
stored free of charge for three months
she refused to pay anything, and would
not take the furniture out on demand.
"My wife did not attack the woman,
and simply defended herself against as
sault. I have never carried a pistol, and
never showed one to Mrs. Gilleran. The
Jamison boy has always been treated
well, and I hope this affair will be hushed
up. It is true that he has never been
taken out much, but there are reasons of
a private nature for that."
Lakin's version Is corroborated by his
wife, who insists that Mrs. Gilleran is of
a quarrelsome nature.

home at the time of death. He was well
known among the pioneers of this county.

WAR MEASURES
PROMPTLY PASS
The Senate Authorizes the
Additional Army
Work.
Enlistment of Volunteer Signal
Corps and the Immune
Bill Also Approved.
Postorfiee Appropriation Aggregating
Ninoty-Nlne Millions Finally
Disposed Of.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â Four war
measures were passed by the Senate
to-day. One of them provided for carry
ing on the additional work in the ad
jutant-general's office; the second au
thorized the enlistment of a volunteer
signal corps, two-thirds of the mem
bers of which must be expert electri
cians or telegraphers; the third was the
so-called "immune bill" passed by the
House, and the fourth was a measure
suspending the existing law so that ad
ditional hospital stewards can be ap
pointed.
The postoffice appropriation bill, car
rying appropriations which aggregate
more than $99,000,000, was passed after
a debate which has lasted for several
days A determined effort was made
by Butler (Pop.) of North Carolina to
cut off the sum appropriated for the
fast mail service between New York
and Washington. Atlanta and New
Orleans to provide for two commit
tees to investigate postal affairs, but
it was unsuccessful, all amendments
except those offered by the Committee
on Appropriations being voted down.

bate the resolution submitting to the
Legislatures of the various States an
amendment to the constitution of the
United States, changing the date of the
beginning of the terms of the Presi
dent Vice-President and members of
Congress from the 4th of March to tht,
4th of May was adopted.
SPANISH STORY OF
BLOCKADE RUNNING.
From Madrid Comes the Assertion
That the Montserrat Has
Beached Havana.
MADRID, May 10.â A dispatch re
ceived here from Havana this aternoon
says the Spanish steamer Montserrat,
which, with a valuable cargo, troops
and a large sum of money, intended for
Havana, escaped the United States
fleet and entered the port of Cienfue
gos, has again run the blockade of the
American squadron and has entered
the port of Havana in safety. It is
claimed here that this proves that the
blockade of the Cuban ports is inef
fective.
The Spanish mail steamship Mont
serrat, which is alleged to have run
the Blockade at Havana, reached Cien
fuegos on April 27, with 1000 Spanish
soldiers, $500,000 in silver and eighteen
puns of large caliber, in addition to a
very valuable cargo, including a quan
tity of ammunition. The Spaniards
claim the Montserrat was sighted by
an American man-of-war which fired
on her. The mail steamer, it is al
leged, mounting guns as an auxiliary
cruiser returned the fire and eventually
reached Cienfuegos.
So many utterly false reports have
been given out in Madrid recently that
American confirmation of the arrival of
the Montserrat will be required before
the story of the blockade running is
accepted as truth.

MUNITIONS
AND MEN TO
LEAVE HERE
Preparations for the Relief
of Admiral Dewey at
Manila.
The Charleston to Leave Before
the End of the Present
Week.
NEW YORK, May 10.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Relief and reinforcements are to be
sent to Admiral Dewey as fast as steam
can carry them.
As Spain has no more naval vessels
In the place it has been decided that it
â¢will not be necessary to escort the
transports and supply vessels with a
naval vessel, and accordingly the
cruiser Charleston is to be dispatched
at once, leaving the other vessels with
troops and supplies to follow as soon
as they can be made ready.
The Charleston, in addition to carry
ing a full supply of ammunition for
her own guns, will carry a large quan
tity in boxes for the ships of -Admiral
Dewey's squadron now in Manila Bay.
She will also carry a full complement
of men for her own crew and a large
number of blue jackets and marines to
fill out the crews on the other vessels.
With the men she will take out Admiral
Dewey will probably be able in an
emergency to land over 1500 men,
though it is not expected that he will
attempt any land operations before the
arrival of troops, unless it should be
absolutely necessary.
It is the intention of the Navy De
partment to get the Charleston to sea
before the end of the present week, and
she will steam as rapidly as possible
all the way across. She is to stop at
Honolulu for coal, and if she should
average twelve knots an hour all the
way across and allow two full days for
coaling she ought to arrive at Manila
Bay in twenty-six days after leaving
San Francisco. She may be able to
make better time than this.
The military and supply expedition
will not be able to get away so quick
ly as the Charleston.
Secretary Alger to-day chartered the
steamer Australia of the Oceanic line
at a cost of $20,000 per month, and the
steamer City of Sydney of the Pacific
Mail line at a cost of $1000 a day.
These vessels are to be used as trans
ports, carrying in their freight space
SENSATIONAL BREAK
IN WHEAT PRICES.
Rapid Fall on the Chicago Board of
Trade, Followed by a Quick
Recovery.
CHICAGO, May 10.â The feature of to
day's wheat market was the sensational
break and recovery in July. New high
price records were made in both the May
and July, at $1 S5 and $125 respectively,
bat it was the break that caused the ex
citement. It was an excited, uncertain
market, with price quotations a cent
apart for the same delivery in. various
parts of the pit for nearly an hour after
tne opening.
Selling was more conspicuous than the
buying the conditions of the previous day
being reversed. From $1 25 July worked
back to $1 16. from which point a -enuine
panic carried prices down 1 and 2 cents
at a clip to $105. Purchases of wheat
were made at this price, although $1 u>
was the low price generally quoted. The
top price for May wheat was made on the
purchase of 25,000 bushels, said to repre
sent part of the Lindblom business which
had not been transferred. The move
ments of May and July were not closely
allied May never sold below the opening
figure, $173, and closed at the top price,
$1 85 The offerings of the July break were
from all directions, and Leiter brokers
were said to be bidding for September at
the time the July break started. At $1 06,
which was the price of calls, the market
turned and worked back to a close at *i 14.
There were no failures to clear n the
morning, although the action of Leiter in
furnishing financial assistance was no
doubt responsible for the prevention of
at least one failure. Leiter reported sales
of 150 000 bushels abroad In small lots.
ST 'LOUIS, May 10.â July wheat broke
14 cents a bushel about an hour before the
close of the regular market to-day It
was the biggest drop in the price of wheat
that has occurred since Civil \\ ar times.
One of the wildest scenes ever witnessed
on tho floor of the exchange resulted. The
decline represented tremendous losses to
many of the traders, and they became
panic stricken. From $1 14% the price
dropped to $1 00Â»Â£. May, September and
December followed July wheat in its de
cline There was little trading in each of
these options, and their decline was not
so sharp.
Just before the close of the session a
reaction set in and July slowly rose to
$106, the final figure for the day. May
showed no change from yesterday, while
July was !V>e, September 43; c and Decem
ber I%C lower than yesterday.
TRAGIC DEATH OF
CHARLES T. HAVEMEYER.
Although He Shot Himself a Coro
ner's Jury Returned a Doubt
ful Verdict.
NEW YORK, May 10.â Charles F. Have
meyer, son of the late Theodore Have
meyor, committed suicide last night at
his home in Koslyn, L. I. He shot him
self through the brain. Mr. Havemeyer
was 35 years of age and leaves a widow
and two children. No motive for the
suicidal act is known.
Havomeyer had been to New York dur
ing the day and had seen several friends.
Shortly before the shooting he had been
playing with his boy, apnrently in his
usual good spirits. There has been noth
ing in his manner that would lead to a
suspicion th.it his act was premeditated.
The Coroner's jury rendered a veruict
that Havempyer came to his death by
the discharge of a pistol in his own hands,
and that there was no evidence to show
that it was not accidental.
NOW RELEASED FROM
MATRIMONIAL BONDS.
Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett, the
Novelist, Secures a Divorce From
Her Husband.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â Judge Hagner
late this afternoon signed a decree grant
ing Frances Hodgson Burnett, the novel
ist, a divorce from Dr. S. M. Burnett, a
â well-known oculist of this city. She is
permitted to resume her maiden name of
Hodgson.
supplies and ammunition for the expe
dition.
Secretary Long has also given the
crew and passenger space of the City
of Peking, chartered by the Navy De
partment, for troops. This vessel will
carry as freight supplies for the navy
and repair material for ships. The
plan of fitting her up as a machine
shop has been abandoned, as Admiral
Dewey's dispatches indicate that It
would not be necessary-
These three vessels can easily carry
the entire military force of something
over 5000 men, which will be sent out
together with the field guns and horses
for the cavalry and artillery. There
will be no unnecessary delay in getting
them started, and they will steam as
fast as possible all the way across, but
it is probable that it will be more than
a month from the present time before
they are in Manila Bay ready to ef
fect a landing under cover of Admiral
Dewey's guns.
The commander of the Charleston
will make arrangements at Honolulu
to have coal and fresh provisions ready
for the troops when they arrive at that
port, so that there need be little de
lay there.
The troops, which are to be command
ed by Major-General Merriam, are now
being concentrated at San Francisco,
and Commissary-General Eagan has
given orders for 1,000,000 rations which
will be ready for shipment at San
Francisco within the next three days.
Should subsequent dispatches from
Admiral Dewey indicate the necessity
of sending more than 5000 men to Ma
nila additional troop ships will be
chartered at once and they will be sent
after the first detachment as soon as
possible.
What the admiral needs most of all
at this time, however, is ammunition,
and it is for this reason that the
Charleston is to be sent ahead of troop
ships. There is no uneasiness on the
part of the authorities as to Admiral
Dewey's ability to hold his position in
the harbor of Manila indefinitely with
his present force, but it is realized that
if he should have to undertake any
operations for the protection of the
â¢city against either the natives or the
Spaniards he would need more ammu
nition.
ATTACK UPON A SHASTA
COUNTY STAGE DRIVER.
Badly Wounded in a Fight With a
Stranger Upon the Top of His
Coach.
REDDING, May 10.â "Billy" Conery, a
driver on the Redding and Bieber stage
line, drove into town this morning with
his face powder burned and bleeding and
with a most extraordinary story to tell
in explanation. In front of the Corbin
farmhouse on Churn Creek, about three
miles east of this city. Conery heard a
noise behind him, as though some one
were crawling on top of the stage. The
driver thought the strange noise was
made by Â«a passenger and paid no atten
tion to it at first.
The noise recurring caused Conery to
turn his head, and as he did so he was al
most blinded by the flash of a revolver.
Two more shots followed in rapid suc
cession. Conery fought back with the
butt end of his whip. His unknown as
sailant dropped off the roar boot of the
stage into the bed of Churn Creek and
disappeared.
One. shot knocked out two of Conery's
teeth and tore into the roof of his mouth.
The ball dropped down and was spat out
by the injured man. The second ball cut
his upper lip and the third just grazed his
cheek. He was badly powder burned.
There is an air of mystery about the
matter that is puzzling to the officers.
Conery is a man of family.

NOGALES IN FEAR
OF AN INDIAN RAID.
DENVER, May 10.â A special to the
News from Nogales, Ariz., says: "Word
was received in Nogales from Fort
Huachuca that 100 Indians, composed of
Apaches, Papagoes and Taquis, had
banded together and were moving in the
direction of Nogales. The Citizens' Home
Guard and Company C of the Arizona
militia were immediately notified. The
streets were patrolled all night, and
guards were stationed on the surrounding
hilltops to give warning of the approach
of the Indians. No disturbance occurred
during the night, but a sharp lookout will
be kept to-day and to-night. Another
company of the Home Guards will patrol
the streets to prevent a surprise similar
to the Yoqui outbreak which occurred a
few nights ago.

GROWTH OF
THE REVOLT
IN ITALY
The Government Seems to
Be Unable to Cope With
the Situation.
Rebels Are Besieging Milan and
There Are Frequent Clashes
in Provincial Towns.
LONDON, May 11.â The Milan cor
respondent of the Daily News, tele
graphing Tuesday night, says: "I am
unable at this moment to send you
more than a few words. Fresh and
more rigid measures have been adopted
in the censorship of telegrams. Th.c
forced silence is most ominous. Any
official acts of the restoration of order
must be received with all reserve. The
rebels are besieging Milan."
The Rome correspondent of the Times
says: "It is believed that matters are
steadily growing worse. The Govern
ment is clearly unequal to the difficul
ties of the situation and great anxiety
prevails in political circles."
The Rome correspondent of the Daily
News, in the course of a dispatch, a
large portion of which was evidently
suppressed by the censor, says:
"The problem is much wider and
more deeply rooted than the question
whether the Cabinet is to remain or
fall, or whether this or that party is
blamable. The responsibility must be
laid on the system which for a quarter
of a century has ground down the coun
try. The outbreak is an attack upon
the unity of Italy.
"Two Cabinet councils were held to
day, and Ministers were unanimous in
the resolution to stick to their posts
and continue the policy of repression at
all costs. Perfect calm prevails here,
but the patrols of troops continue, and
all gunsmith and cutler shops are clos
ed by special order."
The Daily News publishes a dispatch
from a point beyond the Italian frontier
confirming the censorized telegram
from its Milan correspondent, as to the
fighting at Milan. According to this
communication between 100 and 200
were killed on Saturday, more on Sun
day and still more yesterday (Mon
day). Hundreds are wounded and dy
ing, the new bullet used by the troops
I having tne effect of explosive balls.
* ROME, May 10.â The Italian Cabinet
has decided to recommend to King
Humbert that Parliament be pro
rogued. The police are reported to
have seized correspondence, showing
that the recent riots in different parts
of Italy were the result of a plan of
revolution, but it appears that the
movement broke out prematurely. Mar
tial law has been proclaimed in the
Province of Naples.
The rioting at Naples yesterday was
widespread. It was started by big
I bands of students armed with sticks
and revolvers, who operated in various
quarters. They were soon joined by
others, and stone-throwing became
general. The police frequently charged
\ and dispersed the rioters, who, how
ever, re-formed and overturned horse
cars, with which they attempted to
build barricades in several streets. The
rioters made several attacks upon the
soldiers, using stones and revolvers,
and the troops fired, killing or wound
! ing a number of the rioters. Disturb
ances are also reported from various
points in the Province of Naples.
A state of siege has been proclaimed
in the Province of Florence and at
Livorno, Pisa, Sinea, Massea and
Grosseto, and also in the town of Spez
zia, the naval port of Spezzia being ex
cepted from the decree.
At Messina a crowd of women and
children proceeded to the town hall de
manding food . They were dispersed
by the police and the crowd then began
breaking street lamps and tried to sack
a provision store. The proprietor shot
one of the rioters with a gun, which in
creased the disturbance. Troops are
now occupying the town.
The Premier, the Marquis dl Rudinl,
| has sent a circular to the authorities of
| Milan, Naples and other affected dls
i trlcts and to the commander of the
army corps, declaring that though the
agitation may be spreading, it is less
intense, pointing out that the tranquillity
I of Piedmont, Sicily and Sardinia is a
; factor of the highest importance in
I "discouraging the agitators of disorders
i and encouraging those who are wishing
' to maintain the integrity of the father
land."
Continuing the Premier urges the offi
cials not to harbor exaggerated fears
â  and to avoid constant demands for
I troops/as if the whole army were used,
i it would put the country in a state of
war. The Premier added:
"The senseless agitations show the
existence of unreasoning, aimless
masses, yet the constitution is not en
dangered and will emerge triumphant
through the grievous trials in the midst
of which the fatherland is now pass
| ing."
In conclusion the Premier says all
'' civil and military functionaries are just
'â  "employing inflexible rigor in promptly
j repressing disorder."
LUGANO, Switzerland, May 10.â The
' Italian Socialist Deputy Rondani has
arrived here from Belinzona. He de
clares the Italian revolutionists desire
to found a federal republic like the
Swiss republic.
The riotous demonstration at Luino
began on Sunday. The mob leaders
demanded a reduction in the price of
bread, which the local authorities con
i ceded. To-day the rioters attacked the
! carbineers In their barracks and also
I attacked the prison. The police fired on
the mob, killing several persons and
wounding a number of others.
The workmen of Creva, near Luna,
numbering several thousand, struck
work to-day and a fight occurred with
the cuÃtoms officers. The Duke and
Duchess of Saxe-Melnlngen weredrlving
to-day through Luino when they found
themselves between the rioters and the
customs officers as the latter fired a
volley. The Duke and Duchess were not
hurt, but a dozen of the rioters fell.
The ducal party returned here at a
gallop.
BERNE, Switzerland, May 10.â The
news of the uprising in Milan has
greatly excited the Italian workmen
who abound in Switzerland. At Lau
sanne this moring 1000 Italian work
men paraded the streets, carrying a red
flag draped with crepe. As the proces
sion passed through the streets the men
sang the "Marseillaise" and cheered for
the revolution. The outbreak at Milan
appears to have been fully organized.
One of the leaders here exhibited a
telegram announcing:
"The^ revolution is triumphant in
Turin. * The city has been turned."
The men who took part in the demon
stration appear to have plenty of
money. Many Italians have started for
the north of Italy in response to a cir
cular bearing the words:
"To the frontier. Let us start for
Italy."
Advices received from Milan to-day
give details of the arrest of 200 rioters
in a monastery there. It appears that
the students from Pavia who joined in
the disturbance entrenched themselves
in the monastery, and while a detach
ment of troops was passing fired upon
them. The military authorities sent
two field guns to the scene, opened fire
on the monastery, made a breach in
its walls and entered the building, but
the students escaped. All the monks
were arrested and they will be im

Forty Thousand Mustered In.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â Reports re
ceived at Adjutant-General Corbin's
office up to this morning show that
34,354 men had been mustered into the
volunteer army of the United States.
It is probable, however, that by this
time the actual number mustered is
about 40,000 in round numbers.
MEN
Who treat nature in an unfair way
have to suffer. Then many of them
do not seek relief. They sit down and
get full of gloom and do not try to get
back the old time fire and vigor. That
is more folly than the abuse of nature's
first gifts. Where a helping hand is
held out it should be promtply grasped.
"Hudyan" extends it to all weaklings.
"Hudyan" is the great remedio-treat-
ment of the Hudsonian doctors. Its
grand work is to restore confidence to
men who are afraid of their inability
to do anything and everything that
men
WHO
Are self-respecting may at any time be
called on to accomplish. If you can-
not do a good day's work "Hudyan"
will enable you to. If you are filled
with misery "Hudyan" will make your
life bright and well worth living. Do
you wonder whether this is truth or
not? If you do, is it too much trou-
ble to ask for absolutely free circulars
and testimonials, telling you what has
been done. You will get them at onee â
quite possibly next day. They will
show you the sort of way in which
20,000 people speak of "Hudyan." Why
let your life go farther to

SAN FRANCISCO'S charitable peo

sonic Festival at Mechanics' Pa
vilion yesterday, and all seemed
to be actuated by a desire to add
their silver and gold to tho fund that
will build a home for the homeless
widows and orphans. In the big build
ing out on Larkin street there is much
to see, and when the eyes grow weary
there is music and entertainment to
complete a day of enjoyment. In the
spacious gallery last evening but few
seats were left unoccupied, and as they
are raised to a generous height all that
occurred in the far recesses of the
building may be observed by the pleas

Yesterday afternoon the hammers of
busy artisans rang through the hall and
the "ring kept up till the night fell. Sev
eral od the booths are as yet incom
plete, but this afternoon will see them
completed and the fair on a smooth
sailing way. Among the completed
booths the most Interesting, if not the
most artistic, is that of the Puritans,
situated in the southern portion of the
building opposite the band stand. With
in the walls of the llttie booth are
many homely belongings of those peo
ple who were driven to Plymouth Rock
by the persecutions of the English cen
turies ago. The old tables, ancient
chairs and spinning wheelsâ relics or
the dead pastâ set here and there, and
past year there were three new lodges
instituted, as against one the previous
year and that two which had disbanded
were relnstituted. The order has invested
in hall property $1,824,983, and in other se
curities $486,875.
One of the important reports presented
to the grand body was that of the board
of trustees of the Odd Fellows' Home at
Thermallto. This sets forth that during
the year the actual cost of maintaining
the inmates of the home "as brothers,
not as panpers," was $17,555. or a per cap
ita of about $4 per week. This includes
food, clothing, medical attendance, etc.
Fred J. Moll, the superintendent, and his
wife, the matron, are reported "as pecu- ,
liarly adapted for promoting the happi
ness of the residents of the home." E. A.
Kupsel of San Francisco, the physician, is
commended. The board announces that
In accordance with the order of the Grand
Lodge of 1597 it dispensed with Chinese
in the laundry and built a steam laundry
at a cost of JSOO, which has since been
maintained by a monthly expenditure of j
$60. The statement is made that the home
now has ninety-four residents, that there i
is a demand for more room, and that to
accommodate those who apply the attic
of the new wing should be completed.
The board suggests that the appropria
tion this year should not be less than 70
cents per capita on the membership of the
order, which would yield a revenue of a
little more than $21,000. The report will
be acted on this afternoon.
At the afternoon session the finance
committee presented a report which
shows that the receipts during the year
wre $34,420 and the expenditures were
$40,906, and that the balance in all the
funds at the close of the year was $9497.
The grand trustee reported having in
trust property valued at $1800 belonging
to defunct lodges in Markleevllle, Win- :
ters and Havllah.
The Grand Lodge took a recess until 10
o'clock this- morning.
CAPTUBED A BUBGLAB.
Pete McCoy, a Sneak Thief, Landed
Behind Prison Bars.
"fete" McCoy was arrested by Detec
tives Ryan and ODea last night and
lodged in the tanks on a charge of burg- i
lary.
About two months ago he entered the ,
room of a Mr. Landers at 224 Fourth ;
street, and donned one of the latter's i
suits, leaving his own, and took with him
two costumes. In his husry he forgot to
remove a pawn ticket that was in the
pocket of the discarded suit, giving the
detectives a clew. Landers recognized
the clothes as belonging to McCoy and :
reported the matter to the police.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 11, 1898.
a faithful representation of a huge fire
place, clean and comfortable, keeping
watch over all, compose the little
home. From this booth, when the fair
is on, ladies in quaint Puritan gowns
go out among the crowds to sell their
wares â all in the cause of charity.
The Japanese tea garden is without
doubt the most artistic booth in the
fairyland within the hall. Delicate
walls of bamboo, from which pay lan
terns hang and garlanded with the
flowers of the apple tree, girls robed
in true oriental style and matrons to
stay them when they wish to stray
from duty complete the garden the lit
tle brown men builded. Another fas
cinating spot is where the lottery wheel
spins busily away, each turn bringing
in its bit of silver for the home of the
poor. "We're natural born gamblers,"
the comely "spielers" shout in treble
voice, and then away goes the wheel
again on its mission of charity. No
gambling spirit reigns at that booth.
It matters little to the players whether
they win or lose, as the money is Hot
lost, but will bring its cheer to many
a cheerless heart.
The musical programme rendered
both afternoon and evening by Ben
net's band was exceptionally good. A
multitude of people hovered around the
stand where the musicians - performed
and applauded each selection.
At' ll o'clock the ring; of. a great bell
heralded the closing of the day's festiv
ities and the band struck up the national
anthem, "America." Ten thousand voices
caught up the tune and .swelled it until
the big Pavilion trembled. The anthem

Connell, were found dead from carbon
monoxide poisoning at their home on
Bay street, near Powell, last evening, and
just how the gas came to be turned on,
whether by accident or intention, is not
known and probably never will be.
The dead people were missing all day
yesterday, and in the evening Officer Ir
vine broke open a door and found the
dead bodies. Mrs. Connell was lying in
bed and her husband was in a kneeling
posture on the floor beside her. Both had
been dead for about sixteen hours.
The old couple had no relatives in this
city, but had a number of friends of
whom they thought as much as if they
were relatives. Among these were Mr.
and Mrs. C. McFeely, who lives at 1324
Montgomery street. A cousin of theirs
died at Los Angeles recently and his body
is in the city at present. A funeral was
held Monday night and Mr. Connell at
tended it. He returned home about half
past five 5 o'clock yesterday morning and
that was tue last time he was seen alive.
Adjoining the Council residence is the
property owned by the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Light Company, where Mr.
Connell is employed as watchman. Mrs.
McFeely went to the premises about 10
o'clock last evening and being unable to
get in notilied the police â 
The old people were quite well off finan
cially as a HilH-rnia bank book with
14245 9^ credit showed. Only $5 was found
in" the house, which leads the friends of
Mr and Mrs. Connell to believe that
there has been foul play for the purpose
of robbery. They claim that Mrs. Con
nell never had less than $500 in the house
and often kept more than that about her.
As nothing seemed to have been disturb
ed in the rooms the police believe that
there were no persons in the house be
fore it was entered by Mr. and Mrs. Me-
The position of Mr. Connell kneeling at
his wife's side gives color to one theory
of the deathâ that Mrs. Connell either in
tentionally or accidentally turned on the
gas, and when her husband returned early
in the morning and found his wife in an
unconscious condition he tried to save
her and was himself overcome by the
poisoned air, or finding her dead thought
he would follow her and allowed himself
to be asphyxiated. The fact that the two
gas jets in the parlor were turned on full
force lends color to i-he belief that if the
foregoing is true the opening of the jets
was intentional. Another theory of the
r;isc is that Mr. Connell returned from
the funeral and accidentally left the jets
open. The friends say that he never
drank to excess, and if he had not been
In an intoxicated condition it is not prob
able that he would have left the gas
turned on. Apparently there was abso
lutely no reason why the couple
should take their own lives. They had
lived very happily together for thirty-five
' Mr and Mrs. Connell were both born
in Ireland, where they were married, and
were in the neighborhood of 60 years old.
They came to this country about twenty
years ago and have lived in San Fran
cisco ever since. They never had chil
dren and no relatives live in this coun
try, but it is said that there are some in
Ireland.

HUNTINGTON
MAKES A
PREDICTION
Says His Secrets Are
His Own for Years
to Come.
Discourages Attempts to
Ascertain Profits and
Expenses.
Is Not Particularly Zealous in
the Pursuit of the
Truth.
CHAPTER FROM HISTORY.
Good Proapaots for an Early and
Fruitless Ending of the Present
Examination.
C. P. Huntington professes to believe ;
that If he sits up nights and works hard ;
every day for the next 102 years he may
be able to prepare answers to all of the j
questions asked him yesterday by Attor- â 
ney -General Fitzgerald. The fact that \
the Attorney-General thinks the ques- i
tions could be answered within a very j
few days if the persons who possess the \
desired information cared to make it
public, brings about a situation upon
whicb 'will probably hinge the outcome of
the proceedings in the suit now being j
heard by United States Commissioner
Heacock.
The questions put by the Attorney- j
General contemplate a detailed statement j
of the earnings of each of the various 'â 
roads of the Southern Pacific system in i
this State, as well as a detailed statement
of the expense of operating these roads
during each of the years from 1892 to 1897. j
"How long do you think it will take you
to get this information?" was asked.
"I don't know," replied the magnate, ]
"but I suppose it will take years. At a !
rough guess I should say that it will take ;
100 men at least a year. It appears to me j
to be a bigger undertaking to get this in- i
formation than it was to build the |
roads."
"But you must understand, Mr. Hunt

lngton," put in Attorney Hayne, that
this is in the pursuit of truth."
"Well, if you overtake it I will be much
mistaken." was the reply.
At the beginning of the examination
yesterday Huntingdon was asked to give
a detailed history of the various organi
zations having in charge the building of
the Central Pacific Railroad, as well as
the construction companies to which the
work was intrusted. The reply was in
teresting, but not wholly instructive,
mainly because the witness persisted In
giving too much prominence to such as
pects of the case as served to throw into
bold relief his own goodness of heart and
greatness of mind. When asked what in
terest the principal stockholders in the
railroad company had in the construction
companies, the witness admitted that tne
owners of the one were also the owners
of the other.
"What is the present value of the
road?" was asked.
"That is a hard question to answer.
At the time the road was built its value
was somewhat prospective. We expected
to have to wait for it to become valuable.
Of course, it cost us a great deal more to
build the road then than it would now,
on account of the difference in the cost
of material. I remember having paid $120
a ton for iron rails in those days."
"Was that the market price?"
"I never paid more than the market
price for anything in my life."
"Did you not rush the road to comple
tion forthe purpose of sooner getting con
trol of the Government subsidy?"
"That may have been true in the main;
but you must understand that I took a
great pride in rushing the work to com
pletion. Every man, woman and child in
California wanted to go home and see the
old folks, so I hurried up the road to ac
comodate them."
When asked what he had to say regard
ing the sworn statement of Mr. Stow
j bridge, chief of construction of the On-
I tral Pacific road, that the road could have
been built for half the money that was
paid the witness, seemed very ill at ease.
He sÂ«U<l he had no means of knowing the
nature of the information upon which
Stowbridge based hiÃ calculations, and
was, therefore, unable to Judge of the
worth of his deductions. Because of this
lack of knowledge, he said, he did not
feel Justified in entering into a discussion
of the subject.
At the request of the Attorney-General,
Huntington promised to produce in court
: to-day the annual reports of the Southern
; Pacific Company covering the period from
18S2 to 1597.
It is more than probable that the pres
! ent examination of the railroad magnate
will not extend beyond to-day, because of
I the evident intention of the railroad com
i pany to resist all attempts to get at the
; facts regarding the expenses and profits
!of the roads under its control. Huntlng
i ton declarer that he cannot furnish the
! information within tho limits of the pres
i ent century, and any attempt that may be
made to bring the books of the corpora
tion into court will be the signal for the
inauguration of litigation intended to de
lay and thereby defeat such a purpose.

CLERGY BID
FOR CALIFORNIA
An Effort by the Episcopalian*
to Bring Their Conven
tion Here.
Rev. Dr. Moreland Advocates mx%
"American Church"â A United
Evening Service.
An effort Is being made to have the
next Episcopalian Convention of tha
United States in this city, and for that
purpose resolutions were adopted at the
convention of the diocese of California,
now being held at Trinity Episcopal
The general convention will meet in 1901,
and the clergy present stated that they*
would do everything in their power to
have the affair "here, so that the new cen
tury might begin gloriously.
The California Convention opened yes
terday morning with the holy communion
service and a very pleasing sermon by
Rev. W. H. Moreland, rector of St.
Luke's.
Mr. Moreland spoke en +he "American.
Church." and concluded: "There must
be an American type of worship, aa
American ritualâ no imitation of the Ro
man nor slavish copying of the Anglican,
which would be like flying the Spanish,
flag in place of the stars and stripes. Next
this national American church must draw
its financial support from the mass of Its
members, cutting looso from any trans
planted Influences of the endowment or.
the church establishment ideas, and do
ing away with fairs, bazaars and all
worldly methods for tho support of
Christ a kingdom. Finally the laymen or
the church must realize the trust reposed
in them as guardians of public worship,
as helpers of the priesthood and mana
gers or the financial affairs."
The afternoon was given over to the
business portion of tho convention and.
reports from the various officers. Right
Rev. W. F. Nichols presiding and Rev. M.
D. Wilson acting as secretary.
In the evening there was a united serv
ice in the: interest of the Brotherhood of
St Andrew and the Daughters of the
King. Many prominent speakers gave
short addresses, followed by a few re
marks and the benediction by Bishop
Nichols.
BEGISTRATION CLOSED.
More Than Seventy-Three Thousand
Names Down on the Books.
Registration for the charter election
closed last niprht, and Registrar Bigxy re
ported a grand total of 73,4.".9 rejristrations.
which will be subject to verification and
revision. A loss in the vote is expected,
owing to the changes caused by the re
moval of troops.
Registrar Biggy has been warmly con
gratulated on his work during the past
few days. Yesterday his office handled
no less than 1116 registrations, including
357 originals and 759 changes of residence.
Mr. Biggy said h'-st night that while
the registration was heavy for the short
space intervening between the general
elections, there was nothing to indicate
how citizens regarded the proposition for
or against a new charter. Any activity
might be construed :is either a predilec
tion for a new constitutional law or a
determination to defeat any undesirable
change.

THE MASONIC FAIR.
BY common consent of all who have been present
at either or both of the two nights since the
opening, the Masonic Fair at Mechanics' Pa
vilion affords one of the brightest and most attractive
entertainments ever provided in this city. The in
terior of the great structure has been decorated and
adorned until it glows with splendor, and the presence
of music and fair women gives to the festival every
charm needed to make it a scene of genuine delight.
Even if it appealed to the people as a festival for
pleasure merely, the fair would well repay the attend
ance of all. It makes, however, another and higher
appeal. All the work of decoration and adornment
which has resulted in so much beauty was not done
solely for esthetic enjoyment. The motive which
prompted the undertaking of the fair and animates
every movement of its energies is the outcome of the
spirit of charity. By that spirit it appeals to the best
sentiments of the human heart and will win a response
from all who have generous instincts and kindly
feelings.
The Masonic order stands and has long stood as
one of the most beneficent institutions of human so
ciety. Knowing neither class, nor creed, nor na
tionality, nor race, it recognizes only humanity and
serves the welfare of the world in a thousand ways.
One of the distinguished h .tures of its good work
in the world is the care it exercises over the widows
and orphans of those who in life were worthy and
working members of the craft, earnest supporters of
the cause in which it has so long engaged. It is for
the purpose of providing a home for these unfortun
ates that this fair has been instituted. This is the
charity whose spirit pervades the entertainment, and
certainly none has a better claim upon the helpfulness
of all.
Members of the Masonic order are ever among the
first toaidandhelpin all generous undertakings for the
good of any class of people, and by reason n. this they
are deserving of popular support in the work in which
they are now engaged. Every citizen who can
afford to do so should attend the fair, and in propor
tion to his means contribute to the fund for the pro
posed home.
There is in store for all the double pleasure of aid
ing a good work and enjoying evenings of rare de
light amid a joyous company, in scenes of beauty and
to the sounds of sweet music.
DIPLOMACY'S DELICATE PROBLEMS.
IN these troublous times the diplomats upon whose
judgment must rest the destiny of the nation cer
tainly have much to keep them awake o' nights.
They were prepared for many contingencies, but they
could not foresee that just at this critical juncture the
Monocacy would be stuck in the mud.
For a score of years this vessel has upheld the
American flag and American honor in Chinese waters,
being stationed in the harbor of Shanghai. Nobody
ever thought of disturbing it. The wild idea of send
ing it to sea never occurred to mortal man. Now
the stern demand of neutrality is made that the Mon
ocacy must get out. This is cruelty to junk. But
it can't get out. For two decades it has settled into
the mud and is likely to stay there. An attempt to
move it would be costly, and it could not be safely
moved. Probably the average ferry-boat crossing San
Francisco Bay would be a safer craft upon the briny
deep. Even if the Monocacy could be yanked from the
mud there is no assurance that it would float. If it
would float there is no way of telling in which direc
tion it might choose to drift.
To make suggestions may be presumption, and yet
the fact is clear that something must be done. Per
haps it would be well to give the old thing to China.
This act would constitute no loss to the United States
and might please the Oriental, while Chinese seaman
ship is surely equal to managing a craft so securely
embedded in the mire that a typhoon would not rock
it at ks moorings.
Some surprise has been expressed that the yellow
journals have been able to secure news when all the
cables between themselves and the seat of action had
been severed. There is no occasion for surprise. Ac
cess to a cable would not only have been an expense,
but would actually have hampered the yellow boys.
It can hardly be believed that 50 per cent of the
militiamen of Montana were physically unfit to be
come soldiers, even if the medical examiners did so
decide. Montana is neither an infirmary nor a resort
for the one-lunged.
When the correspondents affirm the Government to
be ignorant of the whereabouts of the Spanish the
thought does not occur to them that possibly the
Government is not taking correspondents fully into its
confidence now. " "-~~-
AS TO MONKEY BUSINESS.
THAT there is no need for a Mission "zoo" no
question will arise. That the people of this city
do not desire the establishment of such a con
cern is certain beyond all doubting. That devoting
a quarter of a million to the purchase of a site for
such an affair would be robbery of the taxpayer for
the benefit of the realty shark is a proposition con
cerning which the shark and his accessory will be the
only disputants.
For a time it seemed that the iniquitous scheme had
been crushed, that exposure had killed it, but its
friends were at work, and the effect of their efforts
was apparent at the last meeth.g in April of the Su
pervisors. On that occasion supervisor Clinton de
nounced the project as "a clean steal," a rather an
omalous term, which seemed fully to meet the ex
igency of the case. He showed that the land for
which the city was asked to pay a sum perhaps as
great as $300,000 was of no such value, that a vain
effort had been made once to give it away, and that
for years it had been hawked without a bidder. Now
it was to be unloaded upon the public, which neither
needed nor wanted it, and at a price satisfactory to
the speculators who had originated the job. Such
wanton betrayal of the people would, he thought, be
a crowning scandal. Evidently the Supervisors were
willing to accept such a crown. Nine of them voted
themselves worthy of the shameful decoration.
There is every prospect that the present year will
see "hard times." There are to be no abundant crops
to stimulate trade and keep money in circulation. It
is meet that every citizen harbor his own resources
and a similar rule should apply to the municipality.
It is no season for waste. Yet the Supervisors pro
pose to waste a preliminary quarter of a million. Out
of this expenditure there can come no possible good;
none is expected; such is not the object. The only
purpose is to put the money of the people into the
pockets of the schemers. With the tax levy this year
there is certain to be a deficit All the money which
can be raised is needed in legitimate improvements,
in the streets, the schools, the sewer system, the Po
lice and Fire departments. Why trifle it away on a
monkey ranch, a seminary for poll-parrots?
There can be no claim made that the Mission needs
a "zoo." That section of the city has free access to
Golden Gate Park, now one of the most beautiful in
the world, and yet one in which improvements must
go on for many years, and to which economy denied
this year a sufficient appropriation. San Francisco
will not patiently endure the spectacle of its world
famous park being crippled for lack of funds when
money is thrown away needlessly by the same author
ity which withholds it where it should be freely
granted. If necessity existed for a "zoo" Golden
Gate Park was the place for it. There it would have
been common property, no ground would need to
have been purchased at ridiculously exorbitant fig
ures, and the only cost would have been for the ani
mals themselves. If the Mission is entitled to a park
of its own, so is the Western Addition, so is North
Beach, so is the region around Rincon Hill.
As a matter of palpable fact the Mission "zoo" was
conceived in fraud, is wholly without merit of any
sort, is an unmitigated imposition. If carried through
it should contain a few cages devoted to the detention
of the school of realty sharks who have so zealously
and unblushingly advocated the steal, ostensibly for
the benefit of the Mission, really with the design of
looting the public treasury.
AN INCOMPETENT GRAND JURY.
PROBABLY the dismissal of the present Grand
Jury for incompetency is about as good a dis
position as can be made of it. For some time
it has been evident that it has not intended to do any
thing toward purifying the local political atmosphere.
Its investigation of the ferry depot scandal, in which
proofs of criminality were abundant, stamped it as in
competent. Damning evidence of fraud in the con
struction of this depot has been swept aside in re
sponse to the "pull" of the criminals, with an in
difference to public interest which was simply ap
palling.
But the scandal in the School Department capped
the climax. The jury was utterly unable to con
sider with calmness the facts in that matter brought
to its attention. The school "pull" "completely de
moralized it. Instead of indicting the lumber thieves
of the department the members fell to abusing each
other. Every effort has been made to suppress the
truth concerning the thefts of lumber, and there has
never been a prospect that the rascals would be in
dicted. In fact, it has long been plain that if the
jury found true bills against anybody they would be
returned against those among its members who have
been trying to bring the scoundrel politicians of the
city to book.
One need not look far afield to discover the source
of the internecine troubles of the Grand Jury. Four
or five members have insisted on investigating crook
edness and finding indictments. The whole power
of the local boodle machine in both political parties
has been exerted to prevent action. The members
of the jury have not got at loggerheads because they
disagree in details, nor because some of them are
"cranky." They have failed to do their duty because
a majority is opposed to apprehending political
thieves.
It is, therefore, probable, as we have already said,
that Judge Belcher's action in dismissing the jury in
disgrace is the best disposition that can be made of it.
Certainly the body is no longer of any use to the
public, and the sooner it is retired the better for the
credit of the city and its people. Perhaps the im
panelment of another Grand Jury will not solve the
difficulty. From the new panel all virtue may be
absent. On the other hand, fate may project into the
box nineteen citizens who will be determined to clean
out the political rascals who now infest the city. ' In
any event, the effort to get a competent Grand Jury
is worth a trial. Things cannot continue on the pres
ent basis forever. There must be a revival of civic
virtue or San Francisco will have ultimately to be
abandoned to the predatory classes.
It will be remembered that the Vigilance Commit
tee of 1856 was preceded by two futile efforts on the
part of grand juries to indict influential scoundrels.
James King of William was himself foreman of one
of these juries and was personally assaulted for his
aggressive conduct.
Yellow journalism has added to its list of fake in
terviews one with Sagasta. To have had a signed
statement from the gentleman would have been as easy,
and carried with it the privilege of advertising him as
a member of the staff.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 11, 1898.
THE change of a municipal scheme of govern
ment for a large city is a very serious matter.
The change proposed by the new charter
framed for this city is so great as to cause well de
fined misgivings. Perhaps no plan ever proposed for
any civilized city ever deprived the people at one
stroke of as much as this tak^s from them. We don't
know why a majority of the Freeholders have been
moved to such profound distrust of the people as
seems to be the prime motive of the charter.
The people are permitted to elect one man and he
does the rest. They elect the Mayor and he appoints:
A Board of Public Works.
A Board of Education.
A Board of Police Commissioners.
A Board of Health.
A Board of Election Commissioners.
A Board of Park Commissioners.
A Board of Fire Commissioners.
Civil Service Commission.
These boards control about 83 per cent of the pub
lic patronage of the city. They are not elected by and
are not accountable to the people. Their creator is
the Mayor. When once this machinery is put in mo
tion the voice of the people and their influence in their
government will become less and less. We must take
human nature as we find it. In this country it has al
ways proved dangerous to center all power and pat
ronage of a large city in the hands of one man or of a
few men. The statute of the New York Legislature
which turned the city of New York overto Tweed was
a "reform measure." It created a small non-partisan
or bi-partisan board and gave to it powers that were
beyond the reach of the people. The scheme cost the
taxpayers $30,000,000 stolen outright. While it is true
that the people frequently elect dishonest men to
office, as they have done here, yet the net result of
all experiments is that the peculations arc less than
under schemes for taking power away from the peo
ple and giving it to a few men or to one man.
The new charter for San Francisco seems to have
been influenced by Mayor Phelan's profound distrust
of the people. He appointed the original charter con
vention, a body unwieldy in numbers and incongruous
in its elements, representing every fad extant. The
more grotesque part of its work has been grafted
on to that of the Freeholders. The result is a charter
which calls upon the people to surrender all the power
they have now and create a guide, philosopher and
friend called a Mayor, who will take to himself all
the power and patronage and dictate the policy of the
School, Fire, Police and Health departments.
If it is the conclusion of Mayor Phelan's brief ex
perience in public life that the people are unfit for
self-government, the charter is a proper expression of
his personal belief. But one swallow does not make a
summer, and he should not be hasty in accepting his
own election as evidence of the incapacity of the peo
ple to govern themselves.
A NEW FORM OF REFERENDUM.
IT will be remembered that a short time ago the
people of Oakland undertook to restrain certain
members of the City Council from raising water
rates, by making a demonstration which threatened
something like a personal castigation of the offend
ing Councilmen. The effort was unsuccessful, but
the moral effect was such that reason exists for be
lieving that had it been carried to the extent of put
ting the threat into practice a different result would
have been obtained.
This view is strengthened by reports of the check
ing of a boodle scheme in Peoria, 111., by the adoption
of the Oakland plan on the part of so large a number
of determined citizens that the offending city fathers
were left in no doubt of what would happen if they
persisted in legislating against the will of their con
stituents.
It appears that the Legislature of Illinois enacted
last year a law authorizing a City Council to grant
street railway franchises irrepealable for fifty years.
The act was bitterly denounced at the time of its pas
sage and has been generally regarded as a boodle
measure concocted in the interests of corrupt cor
porations and passed by means of bribery. The Coun
cilmen of Peoria recently undertook to grant a fran
chise under the law, and at once the people set about
defeating the scheme by putting into practice the
plan the Oaklanders invented.
According to the story, as it comes to us on the
authority of the Chicago Times-Herald, the gang
planned a coup to take the public unawares. A spe
cial meeting was tailed to pass the street railway
ordinance. The citizens' safety committee heard of
the project and filled the town with "war bulletins"
warning the people that another attempt would be
made to grab the streets of the city. Banners were
hastily painted advising honest men to attend the
meeting armed with clubs. One of the gang who was
terrorized by these preparations hastily left the city
before the meeting, and the final attempt of the cor
poration to secure a fifty-year franchise was a
failure.
This method of calling in the people as a mass to
check the acts of City Councilmen has manifest de
fects. As a system of referendum it is coarse and
crude and liable to internal explosions likely to in
jure the innocent as well as the guilty. Nevertheless,
as it is of Californian invention and had its origin in
that classic city known as the "Athens of the West,"
we cannot wholly condemn it when practiced in Illi
nois. Moreover, like a good many other things in
politics, it is to be judged by its fruits. These in the
case under consideration seem to have been good,
and, as the main object of civic patriotism throughout
the United States at this time is to put a check on
boodling, the new referendum evidently has merits
which entitle it to serious consideration.
For openly expressing contempt for the American
flag a Spanish sympathizer was recently forced to
kiss the emblem and t*ake a thumping besides. Such
treatment may have been impolite, but the sympa
thizer may draw some consolation by contemplating
what an American in Spain would have got for in
sulting the Spanish flag.
Weeks ago announcement was made that the Span
ish would devote themselves to the specialty of cap
turing American yachts. Either these boats are too
swift for them or they have changed their minds, or
concluded that a yacht would be too dangerous to
tackle.
Several gentlemen are yielding to "the pressure of
friends" to an extent impelling them to consent re
luctantly and patriotically to become candidates for
Governor. And the strange part of it is that the
friends had never suspected what they were doing.
That the Philippine insurgents need killing about
as thoroughlyas theSpanishat Manila is a melancholy
conclusion which cannot well be avoided.
Blanco has cabled for supplies, but he will have to

ESTIMATES OF YELLOW JOURNALISM.
WHERE TO GET THE NEWS.
From the Examiner of May 9.
The superiority of the Eaminer's news service has been amply dem
ons trated by the battle of Manila and the movements on the Atlantic
coast. The Examiner has had the first, the most complete and the most
reliable accounts of the mi'.itary inovenierts that have been undertaken.
The people have shown likewise, in the most practical manner, that
they know where to get tin news. They have bought the Examiner
and have subscribed for it in such numbers that give it by far the
largest circulation in its history.
The people can depend upon it that the Examiner will gtve them the
news first of all the papers, and in tbe mcst complete and reliable form
that is possible at the moment of publication.
From the Chicago Record of May 9.
Sunday morning the New York Journal printed an alleged cable
gram of great length from Hongkong, attributing it to Mr. McCut
cheon, claiming him as its own staff correspondent. How the Record
was imposed upon and lied to by the Journal, and how that faking
sheet attempted to gull the public, let the Record tell in its own words,
in the editorial referred to. It says:
Mr. Carvalho of the New York Journal told the managing editor of
the Record over the long-distance telephone yesterday that the article
in question was manufactured from about 500 words of a cablegram
which the Record permitted the Journal to have on Saturday, as a
matter of courtesy, on the express understanding that it was not to be
published until this morning.
The rest of the article, Mr. Carvalho said, was made up of a patch
work from various sources. The name of the Record's staff correspond
ent was signed to this mess of stuff simply because he was known to
have witnessed the battle. The Record, which gets its cablegrams at
cable rates, leaves the honest American public to judge of the merits
of such journalism.

A story Is going
i around of an mi
i cident which hap
: pened In a West
ern theater a few
1 weeks ago. At a
1 performance of
1 "Romeo and Ju
liet," In the midst of great enthusiasm
bowed acknowledgment, a wag called
"author," which was quickly picked up
and the house rang with the cry
"author!" Presently the joke dawned on
the enthusiasts and all wound up in a
hearty laugh.
Robert Mantell tells a similar tale. He
says: "I was playing 'Hamlet' in a Col
orado town, small but extremely prosper
ous and enterprising. During the day I
had met the treasurer of the theater, a
very charming girl of about 19, pretty,
educated and as bright as a new silver
dollar. She spoke enthusiastically of the
certainty of a big house at '$2 per,' and
how delighted the camp was at the pros
pect of seeing a real Shakespearian play.
In the evening of course the house was
duly counted up and my treasurer came
back with the receipts, also the young
lady. With some pleasant words she
proffered three slips of paper filled out on
printed blanks, such as we get in metro
politan theaters â one marked 'manager,'
one 'Robert Mantell' and the third for
'Mr. Shakespeare.' Thinking it a Joke, I
told the pretty treasurer that she was
quite a wit, but her serious look satisfied
me she saw nothing funny in the transac
tion. Referring to the third copy, I asked
her why she tendered it. With a face as
sincere as t have ever seen she replied
that it was for the author. 'You know,'
said she, 'all the fine companies want a
statement for the author.' I asked her
if she knew Shakespeare had been dead
about 300 years. At this she appeared
somewhat surprised, but said doubtless
hie heirs would require a copy.

THE AMERICAN SONG.
What song shall America sing,
Yi>ung heir of the elder world,
Whose knee ne'er bent to tyrant king.
Whose banner defeat ne'er furled?
A song for the brave and the free.
No echo of antique rhyme.
But a shout of hope for the day to be.
The light of the coming time.
From the dark lowlands of the Â»ast,
Swelling loud o'er the victim's cries.
The hero's shout sweeps up the blast
Where wounded Freedom dlea.
The drum's dull beat and the trumpet's blare
Fmm the far-off years are heard;
But the paean of kings is man's despair.
And the hope of the world deferred.
'Tis the song of the free we sing;
Of the pood time not yet born.
Where each man of himself is king,
Of a day whose gladsome morn
Shall see the earth beneath our feet.
And a fair sky overhead;
When those now sad shall find life, sweet.
And none shall hunger for bread.
Sing then our American song!
'Tis no boast of triumphs won
At the price of another's wrong.
Or of foul deeds foully done.
We fight for the wide worliTs right.
To enlarge life's scope and plan.
To flood the earth with hope and light.
To build the kingdom of Man!

THE CALL-HERALD SERVICE.
Al! of tlie accountsof the buttle of Mar.ila
substantially agree, but that to be lound
in The Call yesterday, written by the
New York Herald correspondent., was the
best In minor particulars. The corre
spondent stood on the bridge of the- Olyrn
pia with Dewey and his executive officer.
His= account is not entirely free from ref
erence to himself, but anybody who stood
on the bridge of such a ship, in such com
pany, and through such a fight, is entitled
to indulge in the first person, singular, in
h's written account of what happened. It
couldn't have been the most tranquil
place in the world. The correapjndent's
name is Joseph L. Stickney, and he Is an

salute you! â Alameda Argus.
For a clean-cut pen picture of one of the
mightiest naval duels the world ever -saw,
the account given by the Herald-Call cor
â i-e.spoiident surpasses anything we J.ave
ever keen. The limitations of the cable
and of- time made it imperative that the
narrative should be boiled down to a
close compass. Fortunately, th-3 corre
spondent was evidently a master of the
art of condensation and description,
and as a result we have in small
compass a complete and graphic
account, which leaves nothing to be de
sired. Of course, the minor details will
be Interesting, but after one has read
that story he will have a picture of the
combat in his mind which is complete.
In other battles where there are a mul
tiplicity of correspondents and a great
number of published accounts, it is diffi
cult for the reader to draw from the mass
of the verbiage a clear picture of the
affair. This will be illustrated doubtless
in the coming fight with the Spanish fle%t
on the Atlantic. But the Herald-Call
writer had the field to himself at Manila,
he was in a position to see the entire com
bat, and being gifted with the power of
expression in few words, he has drawn a
picture which is without parallel in these
days of padding and verbosity.â Alameda

HOW TUB NEWS COMES FROM MfINILA.
News of the fighting in Manila, on the
other side of the earth, travels more
than 14,000 miles, over a dozen or more
cables and three or more overland wires,
before it gets to this city. Very few per
sons, among the thousands who watch
the bulletin boards these days, stop to
think, when a Manila dispatch is posted,
that the message was repeated over and
over again, as it was sent from cable
office to cable office, in the long Journey
from the Philippine port to the ..Vnvr
ican shore. It traveled across seas, gulfs,
bays and straits, mountains, valleys and
plains. But the news that Commodore
Dewey was ready to bombard Manila wat
known in this city thirty-five minutes
in actual time after the British operator
at Manila opened his key. The cables
were rushing- things.
Ihe Eastern cables are owned by Brit
ish companies, the Eastern Telegraph
Company and the Extension, Australia
and China Telegraph Company. The two
companies are controlled by the same
men. Across the China Sea, from Hong
kong to Cape Bolinao, on Luzon Island,
in the Philippines, a cable was laid in
18S0. The cable is 529.11 miles long. From
Cape Bolinao across the island to Manila
is a telegraph line about 100 miles long.
All the news we have received from Man
ila has been first telegraphed from Man
ila to the cable station at Cape Bolinao,
and from there sent on by eabia tv Hcng
keng.
The news that Commodore Dewey had
demanded the surrender of Manila and
was about to bombard the city was soon
afterward followed by a short cable dis
patch from the office of the Eastern Ex
tension Company in London reading:
"1 lie cabi.-* between Hongkong a.nl Man
ila is interrupted."
Only surmises could be made here as
to the cause of interruption.
Without the aid of the Cape Bolinao-
Hongkong cable, dispatches from Man
ila must be carried by boat across the
China Sea and there put on the cable to
the south. From Hongkong to Boston a
message has an interesting, course. From
the Chinese port it is first sent down
the China Sea over a 4GO-mile cable to
Saigon in Cochin China. Another cable,
G3O miles long, conveys it to Singapore,
on the Straits; or it may be sent to tho
island of Labuan, Borneo, and then to
Singapore. From Singapore it runs around
the Malay Peninsula to the island of
Penang, on the western coast of Lower
Slam, a distance of 388 miles. Across the
Bay of Bengal from Penang to Madras
the message is repeated on a cable 14JS
miles long, â ..-..., . -Â - .
In India the message reaches the nrÂ«t
land to- .-graph line after leaving the isl
and of Luzon. Across India to Bombay
the'rinbai;' runs over 80} . mites "I wire.
Then it is put on a cable again to cross
the Arabian Sea to Aden, on the Gulf of
Aden, a distance of 1851 miles. Up through
the Red Sea to Suez is another long cable,
1403 miles. Again the message goes over
land over the 200 miles of wire from Suez
to Alexandria. . - ,
The Mediterranean has no direct cable
from Alexandria to Gibraltar. The mes
sage must be sent over a '9l3-mile cable
to the Island of Malta, and then repeated
over the Gibraltar cable, 1126 miles furth
er. From Gibraltar to Carcavellos, near
Lisbon, is a short cable, 837 miles long,
connecting the Mediterranean port with
the 856-mile ocean cable from Lisbon to
rthcurno, the cable station at Land's
End. England. ;.â ':>_
â¢ Kte\en oci'fn cables connect the Enc-
Jish, Irish and French cable stations with
America, and the message from | Manila,
upon reaching Land's End, may be sea:
over any of these cables.

Light Canvas Clothing to Be Issued to
the Men Comprising the Philip
pine Expedition.
THE concentration of troops at the
Presidio is going forward with
commendable promptness. The
space on the reservation between
the tents of the Fourteenth
United States Infantry and the Seventh
California Regiment of Volunteer In
fantry will soon be occupied by the
First and Second battalions of Califor
nia Volunteers and regiments from
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and
Montana. Three more companies of
the Fourteenth Infantry, and perhaps
BeveraJ troops of the Fourth United
States Cavalry, will arrive before many
days.
Major-General Merriam was at Van
couver Barracks yesterday, arranging
for The equipment of Washington and
n volunteers. He will probably
be in San Francisco before the end of
the present week. Brigadier-General
Anderson is said to be en route to this
tity. It is understood at the Presidio
that he will take command of all the
troops on the tented field of the reser
vation as soon as he arrives.
The greatest activity prevails at de
partment headquarters of the United
States army in this city. Captain Os
car F. Long, acting chief quartermas
ter of the department, was busy yes
terday arranging the details for the
loading of ships recently chartered by
the Government for the proposed ex
peditions to Manila. Dispatches from
Washington announce that the steam
ships Australia, City of Peking and
City of Sydney have been secured. It
is understood that the Peking will be
the first ship to sail and that her cargo
will consist mainly of supplies and na
val stores for Admiral Dewey's fleet.
The other two vessels will carry troops.
The fact that the Secretary of War
has ordered quite a number of volun
teer regiments to be concentrated at
the Presidio is accepted by the troops
as an assurance that the volunteers as
well as the regulars will join the expe
ditions to the Philippines.
The volunteer troops of California
now concentrated in San Francisco con
gist of seven companies of infantry
from the San Joaquin Valley and one
company from Sacramento, comprising
the First and Second battalions; the
Seventh Regiment of Volunteer Infan
try from Southern California; the First
Regiment of Volunteer Infantry from
the city and four batteries of heavy
artillery volunteers â one from Sacra
mento, one from Los Angeles and two
from San Francisco.
CAMP OF THE
VOLUNTEERS.
Men o? the First and Sev=
enth California Ea^er for
Service at Manila.
The First an- Seventh regiments have
now become thoroughly settled in the
routine of camp life, and the men and
officers are rapidly rounding into soldiers.
The non-commissioned officers were busily
engaged yesterday in drilling the raw re
cruits of the different companies, and the
companies were also put through com
pany drill. Guard mount took place at
7:45 o'clock yesterday morning, and the
guard made an excellent appearance,
while the playing of the band showed
such noticeable improvement as to call
f. irth unstinted praise from Colonel Smith
and his staff.
Colonel Smith and his field and staff
officers were the guests of Captain Lock
ett yesterday morning at 8:30 o'clock, and
they rode to the golf grounds of the Pre-
Hklio, where they witnessed a battalion
drill of the Fourth Cavalry, under the
command of Captain Lockett. The bat
talion was put through all the field move
ments that troops are called upon to ex
ecute in time of war. Scouts were thrown
out and an imaginary enemy was
i harged. Colonel Smith and his officers
were greatly pleased and instructed by
the drill.
From the way the new soldiers are
wrkir.g to get into shape, from the col
onel down to the line, it can be easily
that they are all anxious to get
away to Man.la. The men s.-em imbued
with but one spirit, and it is that they
may be prepared when the call comes,
for there is hardly any doubt that the
First will be one of the volunteer regi
ments chosen by the Government to go
to the support of Admiral Dewey. If it
goes. Colonel Smith declares that his
command may be relied on to give a
account of itself and to do its duty !
under all circumstances.
The First an<! Seventh regiment camps
were thronged with visitors yesterday,
and especially waa this true of the camp
of the former. All of the families, friends
and relatives of the men who are to go to
Manila came out to see how near their
sons, brothers and husbands had ap
proached the stage of veteranship. Idle
curiosity was superseded by ardent ad
miration, and willing feminine ears lis

tened eagerly to the stories of camp life
that the boys had to tell.
Lieutenant NÂ«aU, Fourth Artillery,
united States army, who has been ap
pointed acting chief quartermaster of
the volunteer regiments, was busy yes
terday looksig after the needs of the two
commands. He instructed Colonels Smith
ana Berry to ascertain just exactly what
they needed, so that they ni'.ght be aoie
to make the proper requisitions upon his
department. Lieutenant Neall said that
tho troops were well supplied in the way
of rations as far as was necessary to keep
them in camp from day to day, but that
they yet needed many supplies before
they would be in shape to go to Manila.
He remarked that it would take at least
ten days to equip 10.000 troops. The am
munition is expected here in the near
future. Some of the troops that will go
to Manila with the volunteers have not
yet been recruited. Upon a conservative
estimate, it can be safely said that the
regiments will not be in shape to leave
before the 20th of this month.
A. W. Kimball has been commissioned
by Governor Budd to be tirst lieutenant
and regimental quartermaster of the Sev
enth Regiment. He was mustered into
the service by Captain Carrington yes
terday afternoon and immediately took
charge of his department. He formerly
held the same ofllce in the Fifth Regi
ment.
The adjutant -general of the Department
of California Is In receipt of the following
dispatch:
"Vancouver Barracks, Washington,
"May 10, 1898.
"Adjutant-General, Department of Cali
fornia: If troops go to Manila each man
should have a suit of brown canvas cloth-
Ir.g and two white suits, medium light
woolen underwear and barrack shoes.
Canvas clothing as now issued for fatigue
wear will answer. Take preparatory ac
tion. Merriam, Brigadier-General."
In the Seventh Regiment 155 men failed
to pass the physical examination and
they will be sent back to their homes at
the expense of the Government. In Com
pany D all of the commissioned officers
who came with the company from Los
Angeles failed to pass the physical exam
ination. They were Captain Thomas and
Lieutenants Reynolds and Phillips. H.
T. Matthews has been appointed captain,
J. A. Eason and Samuel Crawford lieu
tenants. All of these officers have seen
service in the National Guard and have
excellent records.
Captain Farrell, one of the assistant
surgeons of the- First, relieved Captain
Rethers yesterday. The two surgeons
will be in command of the hospital corps
upon alternate days while the regiment
remains in camp. The camp inspection
of the First was made yesterday by Cap
tain Sutliffe and Captain Rethers.
One hundred and eighty men were
treated at the hospital of the volunteer
command at the Presidio yesterday.
There is one serious case of fever which
the surgeons are watching closely.
A committee of native daughters of
California visited the volunteers at the
Presidio yesterday and arranged to sup
ply each soldier with a housekeeper's kit.
THE QUOTA IS
IN THE FIELD.
Prompt Work at State
Headquarters Highly
Commended.
The turning over to the United States
of California's quota of volunteers called
for by the President's proclamation was
completed by Governor Budd yesterday,
and with the exception of a few minor
details the executive of the State of Cali
fornia will have complied with every de
mand in connection with what is one of
the memorable events in the history of
the State.
The furnishing of California's quota of
troops was done with such remarkable
expedition that it has called forth words
of commendation from the War Depart
ment at Washington, from General H. C.
Merriam, commander of the department
of California and the Columbia, and from
many other sources.
Upon General Barrett will devolve the
work of clearing up the clerical end of
the great undertaking and looking after
the State's interest with the general Gov
ernment, in which both Colonel Fred Bur-
I gin and Colonel Phillip L. Bush will con
j tinue their valuable services until the
decks are cleared.

the appointments made by the Governor
yesterday and which completes the full
quota of officers called for:

Very respectfully,
A. W. BARRETT, Adjutant-General.
The Southern Pacific Company has re
ceived instructions from its Eastern con
nections to nialje arrangements for the
transportation of 1200 volunteer troops
from Denver and 300 from Salt Lake, who
will come by way of Ogden. It is also
highly probable that many more will
come from Boise, Idaho, Helena, Mont.,
and St. Paul, Minn., probably by way of
Portland, though arrangements may yet
be made to bring them via Ogden also.
The number of volunteers is not definitely
known, but it will no doubt amount alto
gether to some 4000 men.
SOLDIERS AT
A BANQUET.
Magnificent Testimonial to
the First and Seventh
Regiments, Califor
nia Volunteers.
The banquet tendered by Major General
Dickinson and staff to the field, staff and
LEADER OF THE FOURTEENH
Major Charles F. Robe, the Commander of
the Washington Regulars,
medical officers of the First and Seventh
regiments, United States California Vol
unteers, at the California Hotel last night,
was a magnificent affair, and the success
was all the more noteworthy by reason
of the fact that the event was arranged
in a single afternoon, for at 2 o'clock yes
terday General Dickinson and staff con
ceived the idea of bringing the officers to
gether Who had enlisted to defend the
country's flag and honor. The invitations
were sent out by telephone, the menu was
given in the hands of the printer at 3,
and at 7 in the evening guests to the num
ber of seventy-eight sat down to an elab
orate repast, and in five hours all the pre
liminaries had culminated in one of the
grandest affairs of that description ever
held in this city.
The banquet hail had been decorated
profusely with Old Glory, as If those sev
enty-eight loyal hearts and true were
bent on showing how dear to their hearts
is the dear old star-spangled banner. Flow
ers were in abundance also, and the won
der is that a banquet so complete in every
detail could be gotten up at a moment's
notice. All the guests were in fatigue
uniforms, with here and there a civilian
in full evening attire.
General Dickinson was toastmaster, and
on his right sat Adjutant General Bar

pride of the Seventh Rfgiment; Irving
M. Scott, Hugh Craig, Captain Curring

attend and sent their regrets.
Patriotism was also manifested in the
menu card, and such dishes as "Polsson

BROWN SERVED
BY A MARSHAL
Defendant In Mrs. Humphreys'
Breach of Promise Case
Is Found.
His Letters Show a Strange Mingling
of Business and Love
Making.
Cyrus Elwood Brown, president of the
Gowanus Mining Company, who has been
sued for $100,000 by Mrs. Alta Humphreys,
was served by a deputy United States
Marshal yesterday. He was much wor
ried over the suit, which he denounced
as blackmail.
ErnmoQS & Emmons, attorneys for the
plaintiff, say that their client is a busi
ness woman whose reputation is untar
nished. She is accompanied by her son,
a boy of 13, who takes a great deal of in
terest In the suit.
A perusal of some of the sixty-two let
ters which Brown is said to have written
the plaintiff shows that he was master of
the art of mixing love and business. In
several of his letters he dwells for a page
on his Idea of love, marriage and women,
after which he suddenly digresses with j
expressions purely commercial. One let- |
ter ends as follows: "My little charmer, |
I believfe in love and do not believe In
marrying for money or position. The hu
man heart criea out for congenial com- |
panionship. Inclosed you will find a |
prospectus of the mining company. You
can interest your frionds in it. I would
not ask you to do it, except that I know
you are a business "woman."
He speaks of his life as a recluse, say-
Ing that he has deserted society since his
wife's death sixteen years ago. But the
unfortunate fact for Mrs. Humphreys is
that the .wife spoken of as dead, la alive]

and ringing cheers.
There were no set speeches, but almost
all present had something to say to con
tribute hie quota to making the affair the
success that it was. Among those who
responded were Colonel James F. Smith,
Colonel John Berry, Colonel Hopkins, Ma
jor Rice and Colonel Macdonald.

WILL CARRY
NO TROOPS
The Navy Department Will
Make a Supply Ship
of the Peking.
The steamer Peking will be clear of her
cargo this morning, and she will be
turned over to the Navy Department at
once. Her first trip will be to the dry
dock, and then she will be loaded with
supplies for Dewey's fleet at Manila.
I Supplies are already being purchased.
! so the work of loading will be commenced
as soon as the vessel is in the water
i again. There will be stores for the ves
| sels of the Asiatic squadron and ammu
nition to take the place of the powder and
: shell that did such good work in Manila
i harbor. The Navy Department is not do
| ing anything about coal, however, and the
i supposition is that Dewey has all he
; wants. It is known that there was a large
; amount of coal stored at Manila, and this
I must now be in Dewey' s hands, so the
; Government is not worrying about the
j coal supply in Asiatic waters.
So far no provision has been made to
i transport troops on the Poking. At tho
navy pay-office it is given out that the
i navy is fitting her up as a supply ship
! and is doing nothing for the accommoda
j tion of troops on board. The transporta
i tion of troops and the chartering of yes-
I seb3 for that purpose belongs to the army,
j and so all arrangements of that kind have
been left to the army quartermasters.
Admiral Miller, who arrived here on the
Peking on Monday night, has reported to
', the Navy Department, but had received
!no orders up to last evening. It is his
â  intention to ruiye his flag on one of the
! vessels here â probably the Montereyâun
j less orders from Washington interfere
The Monterey is tho only vessel here with
accommodations for a fkig officer, and
even then he will have to take the quar
i ters of the captain, for as yet there is no
I captain on board the Monterey.
Twenty men were passed by the naval
recruiting officers yesterday, and all were
sent up to the navy-yard to the Indt;
pendence last evening. The office at
I present is shipping only first-class ma
i chinists, first-class firemen, seamen and
i ordinary seamen. As the Charleston will
I take away nearly all the available men

I Philadelphia and Yorktown will both need
1 full crews, it is expected that before long

time. She is now visiting in Brooklyn,
where she has been for several weeks.
FLOWEBS AND MUSIC.
Eighth Annual Exhibition and Bose
Show of the State Floral Society.
The war excitement will not prevent the
California State Floral Society from giv
ing its annual show, although there has
been some talk of dispensing with it this
year for that reason. The management,
however, has concluded that home indus
tries should not be let drop on account of
the international excitement.
The show opens in Golden Gate Hall on
Thursday at 1 p. m. and closes Saturday
at 10 p. m. Although conditions have been
somewhat against them this year the
management expects that this show will
be at least equal If not superior to any
former one. There are already about
forty exhibitors entered on the list, and
some of the counties have yet to be heard
from. The management has prepared a
splendid premium list and $400 in prizes
| will be distributed. An orchestra has
been engaged to furnish music through
out the show, and all arrangements have
I been made to comfortably accommodate
I the public. Following is the committee
of arrangements:
John Hinkle, manager; Mrs. W. H.
Wiester, secretary; Mrs. B. E. Hendrick

Mrs. C. D. Friedman and Mrs. M. Groth

Mrs. Dorette Heinrich, who was arrest
ed last Saturday night on a charge of in
sanity preferred by her husband, B. Hein
rich, an engineer In the employ of the
Electric Light Company, was discharged
from custody yesterday by order of
Judges Hunt and Troutt. The examining

WANTED THEIR
OWN OFFICERS
Company L of the Seventh
Regiment Objects to
Political Leaders.
Mutiny broke out in the ranks of the
Seventh Infantry, California Volunteers,
on Monday, and for a time it looked as If
though Colonel Berry would be short one
entire company at least.
The trouble, according to the state
ments of some of the officers and all the
men, and nobody has seen fit to deny
them, was due to an attempt of one offi
cer to pay off some political obligations
at the expense of certain officers of the
regiment. Vague rumors of the scheme
were in circulation before the regiment
left the south, but nothing definite was
learned until just before Captain Car
rington began to muster the companies
into the volunteer service.
Company L from Santa Ana wanted
Lieutenant Walter Greenkaf in the place
of N. A. Ulm. and the latter finally re
signed in Greenleafs favor, to the great
satisfaction of the company.
The* other officers of the Seventh who
were summarily dropped were Lieuten
ant Allen, Company A; Lieutenant
George, Company C; Lieutenant Saye,
Company E; Lieutenant Sloate, Com
pany K.
One of the officers of the Seventh who
failed to pass the physical examination
was Major Bangham. His place will be
filled by Lieutenant Colonel Welch of
General Last's staff.
Regulars Arrive.
Headed by the splendid regimental band
four companies of the Fourteenth United
States Infantry landed at the Market
street ferry at 10:30 o'clock on Monday
morning, and without pomp or ceremony
marched up Market street to Golden Gate
avenue, out that thoroughfare to Van
Ness, to Lombard street, to the Presidio.
Major Robe commanded the battalion,
with First Lieutenant Hunt acting as ad
jutant, and First Lieutenant Krauthoff,
Quartermaster. The battalion is composed
of Company D, Captain McCommon, Sec
ond Lieutenant Burnslde; Company F,
First Lieutenant Mitchell; Company G,
Second Lieutenant Miles; Company C,
First Lieutenant Biddle. It averages
sixty men to the company, while the band
numbers twenty-three men.
War Incidents.
Brigadier General M. W. Muller, Third
Brigade, National Guard of California,
seems to stand as good a chance as any
other officer to be appointed brigadier
general of volunteers from California.
He is a candidate for the position on his
merits as a soldier, but has no political
pull in his behalf. He has had twenty
four years of service with the militia,
and many officers of the regular army
regard him ua the most capable officer
in the National Guard. He was appoint
ed brigadier general of the State troops
by Governor Markham in IS9I, and was
reappointed by Governor Budd.
P. H. Bernays, manager of the San
Francisco branch of the Pope Manufac
turing Company, makes this announce
ment:
Any person now employed at the home or
branch offices of the Pope Manufacturing Com
pany, Hartford Rubber Works Company, Pope
Tube Company or Motor Carriage Department,
who shall enlist before May 20 into the volun
teer service of their country In the war be
tween the United States and Spain, will be in
sureil to the amount of $1000, one year, at the
exiÂ«-ns<e of the above company. Upon honorable
discharge from such service the opportunity to
return to the employ of the above-named com
panies will be given to all persons who have
thus volunteered.
It was the intention of the Governor to
send the Sixth Infantry Intact, and he re
grets that there was any misunderstand
ing on the part of Company F of Fresno,
who offered their services conditionally,
the provisions of which he was unable to
accept, and which he was powerless to
carry out. He was therefore compelled to
select a company from some other regi
-mont to fill the quota called for to make
up the First Battalion.
In justice to Company F, Governor
Budd desires it to be stated that since
the matter has been explained to the men
they have made every effort to enter the
service unconditionally, and deplore the
fact of having unintentionally made the
error which forced them to remain be-
Adjutant-General A. W. Barrett yester
day received a telegram from General A.
W Greely, chief signal officer of the
United States army, stating that he re
gretted that no Quota for signal corps
had been called for from volunteers,
hence he could not accept the proffered
services of the signalmen of California,
but in case a corps was made up, Cali
fornia's well-trained signalmen would be
the first called.
The citizens of Stockton will present a
etand of colors to the First Battalion of
Infantry as soon as the flags are fin
ished. The presentation will be made at
the Presidio, where the battalion is ex
pected to be encamped.
Arrangements are being made to s'ipply

It is the intention of the Governor to re
organize the National Guard at once, and
General Dickinson, under whose super
vision the reorganization will be made,
says the work will begin as soon as he
learns the exact status of affairs. Great
care will be taken to make the National

will be required to pass a rigid physical

eating contest, a guessing contest for the
ladies, and many other events.

No Cable Interruption.
To the Editor of the San Francisco
Callâ Sir: Referring to the notice in this
morning's paper stating that in conse
quence of a break in the cable between
Montevideo and Buenos Ayres tele
graphic communication is interrupted as
far as Buenos Ayres, the impression con
veyed is incorrect. The break in the cable
from Montevideo does not interrupt or in
terfere with the transmission of mes
sages to any point, either Montevideo or
Buenos Ayres.
The Western Union, In connection with
the Central and South American Cable
Company at Galveston, Tex., still main
tains telegraphic communication to Val
paraiso, Montevideo, Buenos Ayres and
all points on Brazilian lines. Yours truly,

Alger Dislikes Mosby.
It has come to light that one of the
reasons that Colonel Mosby has a hard
time to get recognition at Washington is
that he made himself active by hanging
a number of the men under Secretary
Alger, who was a captain of Michigan
Cavalry during the war. According to a
book called "Mosby's Rangers," a num
ber of Union soldiers were engaged in
burning houses at Castlemans Ferry on
August 14, 1564. They were under Algei.
Mosby was sent after them and he killed
about twenty-five of the number, for
which General Lee commended him. It
is said that Alger has never been able
to forgive the deed and that he has al
ways done all he could to block Mosby in
his ambitions.

: INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
Of an lowa Lady Who Was Cured of .
Dyspepsia After Suffering for
Twenty-Five Years.
.Mrs. Sarah A. Skeels, an estimable
lady residing .at Lynnville, Jasper â 
County, lowa, was ; for twenty-five :j
years a sufferer from Dyspepsia, â¢ and ]
her ' complete restoration :to health ;is j
so remarkable that we present the facts "
In the case for the benefit of our read- '
ers, many of whom have doubtless suf- j ;
fered in the same manner and will, 7-
therefore, be interested in learning how
all stomach troubles may be avoided
and cured. Mrs. Skeels says: I used
only one package of Stuart's Dyspepsia ;i
Tablets and I received such great " and ;
unexpected benefit that I wish to ex- I
press my sincere gratitude. ,In fact, it '
has been six months since I took the
medicine and I have not had one par-
ticle of distress or difficulty since. And 7
ail this in the face of the fact that the '
best doctors I consulted told me .my
case was incurable, as I had suffered
for twenty-five years. I want half a,,
dozen packages to distribute among my
friends here who are very anxious to >'
try this remedy. Yours truly, '
MRS. SARAH A. SKEELS. I
, The . reason why : Stuart's Dyspepsia ;
Tablets are so successful in curing in-
digestion and stomach trouble and the
reason why it never disappoints those
who need it and use it is because noth-
ing is claimed for it except what it will
actually perform. It is not a cure-all
and no such claims are made for it.'
It is ; prepared for the sole purpose of
curing Dyspepsia and the various forms f
of indigestion. 6Â£9PpS6999Â»ij
There is scarcely a patent medicine
made but what is claimed to cure dy- â
spepsia, as well as a hundred other
troubles. When, as a matter of fact, a
remedy to cure Dyspepsia must be pre-
pared especially for that and nothing
else; and among all the remedies, pat-
ent nostrums, bitters, etc., so exten-
sively advertised you will find .that'
Stuart's Dyspepsia , Tablets is the only %
one advertised as a cure for Dyspepsia '
j and nothing else. The remedy is pre- .
| pared by the Stuart Company of Mar-
shall, Mich., and for sale by all drug-
gists at 50 cents per package, and if -''
you suffer from any form of stomach
derangement or indigestion a trial will
not disappoint you.
A little book on stomach troubles
mailed free. Address Stuart Company,
Marshall, Mich. '

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, if any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours, j
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal i
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied j
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres- !
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied !
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually !
first appear on the Washington coaÂ«t. When !
the pressure is high in the interior and low i
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and aouth along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of I
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is lm- j
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of I
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Call- '
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and oolder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 10.â The stock market was
largely influenced to-day by the wheat market,
the movements in which unsettled the tone In I
all speculative markets. No doubt successful
speculator! of j-esterday In wheat immediately â 
placed a part at least of their profits in the .
Mock markets. This kind of support had no '
Hinall part in the undertone of strength In
stocks yesterday. To-day the wiping out of \
paper profits and the tumbling of prices in |
wheat resulting In the uncovering of margins
Induced liquidation in the stock market. The
market during the early part of the day ab- j
sorbed a very large line of offerings to liquidate
profits and the selling for London account was
also heavy again, total sales for that account
being estimated at over 25,000 shares. The gen
eral demand for stocks through commission
hotnes was sufficient to take up these offer
ings at a well-sustained level of prices. There
was evidence also of the operation of bull
pools here and there in the list, notably in
some of the low-priced stocks which are usually
almost Inactive and immovable. The strength
Imparted to these stocks helped to sustain the
market and with the rally from the opening
weakness in the wheat market there came a
period of aggressive strength in stocks which
iWted prices substantially above last night's 1
level. The late decline was effected on a much
smaller volume of offerings than was well ab- i
â orbed in the morning's dealings. Short selling
by the bears was conspicuous. A slump of I
over four points in Tobacco also had its effect
In the late weakness. There were fractional I
recoveries before the close, which was firm at
net losses of over a point in some cases.
SUae loans were offered to-day at four pe^l
cent np to four months and prime mercantile
paper was also quoted lower at 5 to 6 per cent.
There was nevertheless a decline In the rates
for Sterling Exchange amounting to about one
half of yesterday's gain. This development in
Sterling Exchange in face of the easier ten
dency of money, large selling of securities here !
for foreign account and the announcement of i
the shipment from Australia yesterday of |
$2,500,000 in gold for San Francisco is highly
significant of the continued strength of tIM
country In the world's international exchanges.
The market for railroad bonds showed a re
actionary tendency in sympathy with stocks,
but the business was not large. Total sales, .
12,000,000.
United States new 4s coupon sold at a decline
of >4 from the last sale. Bid prices were tin
changed.

Spain is said to be buying silver.
I learn from a good source that a Russian

There was a sharp fall in Russian exchange,
which, together with Berlin exchange, has
been affected by the reports of a Kussian loan.
The report that the Spanish July coupon has

NEW YORK WHEAT MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 10.â The bears In wheat
had a chance to retaliate to-d.iy. Had did po
with a vengeance, particularly in the last
hour, when their persistent attains upon the
market resulted in a wholsale tumble of \:il
ues, July losing nearly 10c a bushr.l in a half
hour's time. From the standpoint of flucua
tlons the market was by far the wildest seen
In years. Speculative trade was not viuitt; co
feverish as yesterday, outsiders bains gener
ally absent, although there were hea/y nal
lngs in the last break. There were fr-quent
changes in the market of a half cenl a bu.shel
between traders all day. The immediate open
ing was SV-c lower at $1 23 for July, based on
i a severe reaction in the Liverpool market.
This depression did not last ions, however, as
' the crowd was very nervous and yiÂ»ldci laiily
to a strong bull movement which excited
i heavy covering, and rushed July in quick
: stages up to $1 31%, which was the: top lor the
i day. From that figure there was a tieady
. downfall until July sold at $1 13%. Then tf>Â«ie
was a quick reaction to $1 23, .vim $1 11 the
â¢.â losing figure. On the curb further selling pull
!ed the price down to $1 20&. Tie feature in
May was a late advance to $1 91, exce<xt!Xkg ttie
previous high point by lc a busjjl, the close
' being the top for the day. and o^c .liglier than
: last night, although July and the lai'er

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. May 10.â Intense â  excitement In the
wheat pit- marked the day from the very start.
Liverpool showed a decline jat the opening of
Rio a bushel for May and 2c for September.
, This was offset by a preliminary Jump o*. 9%0
In July. But the second cables showed a sud
den slump In July also. This , unlooked for
; procedure on the part of the English market
caused a weak opening here. July began with '
I declines of 2@3c. ' Trades were on a range of :
$1 17@1 18. Four subsequent j quotations re
! duced the price to $1 16. Here the supply of j
wheat suddenly vanished and quotations j
I steadily advanced to $1 25, the highest point j
! yet reached by the July option. May wheat ,
j was only heard from at long Intervals Trad- ,
ing In it began 2o lower at $1 73 The suo- | |
I ceedlng sales were at $1 75. $1 80 and $1 85. It
I had occasional reactions to $1 _ SO. but was not j
I picked up. It was about 11 o'clock when July j
touched $1 25. It rebounded to $1 24. rallied to |
11 25 and then took a steady downward course^
Stop orders on long wheat seemed thick and
close under the market. The downward flight
was checked temporarily at around . Â»1 17.
Trade was narrow and ordinary *.?^**
hard to execute. A quarter of an hour before
the close a flood of wheat broke loose. The
selling was based largely upon the presumption
i that to-day's Government crop report might do
bearish. Scalpers ventured to put out short
lines. July slumped In a couple of minutes
i from around $1 18 to $1 05. Most of the trades
! were a full cent apart. When the liquidation
I was exhausted, shorts tried to even up. and
j the market rushed up again to $1 15. closing
at $1 14. a net loss of 6%0. May sold between
$1 73 and $1 85. closing 10c net higher at $1 85.
September, which sold early at 93% c. tumbled
to 88c and closed at 90Â»4c.
Trade in corn was moderate. Fluctuations
followed wheat on a small scale, July closing

WINTER WHEAT OUTLOOK.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â The May returns
to the statistician of the Department of Agri- j
' culture show the acreage in winter wheat to |
! be 6.7 per cent greater than the acreage last I
year, the comparison being not that with the ]
acreage harvested in 1897, ; but with that sown j
in the fall of 1836.
While there is an Increase of 26 per cent In I
Kansas, ' a more or less increase In every East
i crn and Southern State and some Increase also
'â  on the Pacific Coast, the large expansion thus
Indicated is to some extent offset by a decrease
of 2 per cent in Indiana, 3 per cent in Ohio,
12 per cent in lowa, 13 per cent In Missouri and
16 per cent in Illinois. The average condition
of winter wheat is 86.6, against 80.2 on May 1 of
last year. in the nine States with 1,000,000
I acres or upward in â¢ this product the average
areas follow:
.Kansas, 105; Pennsylvania, 96; Michigan and
Tennessee each, 95; Missouri, 88; Indiana, 87;
Illinois, 86; Ohio, E2. and California, 26.
Correspondents agree in reporting the crop
of California . to be one of the smallest ever {
raised in the State. On the other hand the
crop of Kansas bids fair to be the largest in
its history.
The average ' condition of winter rye Is 94.5,
i as compared with 88.0 on May l of â¢ last year.

WHEAT â The scramble for Breadstuff In
England and on the Continent continues and
prices are steadily rising there. But this mar
ket Is largely governed by Chicago, which Is
in the grip of young Mr. Letter at present, who
is pulling and hauling It all sorts of ways, as
suits his Interests. Thus, yesterday. It opened
at $1 17 for July, rose to $1 25, declined to
$1 07 and recovered to $1 1L while the local
bzrokera were watching the blackboard with
bulging eyes, and yelling themselves hoarse
on the calls between times. Of course, when
the market bobs around like this it is almost
Impossible to give accurate quotations, but
those below are not far from the true figures.
The mhillers are about the only buyers at
the moment, and are getting supplies wherever
they can, but chiefly from Oregon and Wash
ton. The shippers are doing little or nothing.

LADIES WORK
FOR FABIOLA
Declare They Fear No 111
Effect From Recent
Criticism.
Some of Dr. Dille's Remarks
Are Still Arousing Tart
Replies.
One of the Features of the Day Will
Bo at Race for Gentlemen
Riders.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 10.
Notwithstanding the criticisms of Rev.
Dr. Dille, the ladles of the Fabiola Asso
ciation are going ahead with the selling
of tickets for their benefit next Saturday,
and feel assured that its success will be
as great as that of past years.
It has been decided to have a gentle
man's race, and the following amateur
riders have entered for the mile contest:
William OB 161. C. B. Bates Jr.; Zarro
161. E. A. Howard; Tortoni 158, H. M.
Barry; Metalre 158, S. T. Blake; Wawona
lis. F. T. Dieckmann; Monita 158, A. A.
Moore Jr.
Mrs. J. E. McElrath, a local society
leader, said to-day that Dr. DillÂ© evi
dently lot his enthusiasm run away with
his judgment. "I should have have no
fault to find," she said, "with his remarks
had hÂ© confined himself to a denunciation
of gambling; but when he went out of his j
way to malign some of the best women of
Oakland he went too far. The ladies who
direct Fabiola are among the purest and
most lovable to be found anywnere. His
inference that ladies who would patronize
a benefit day for Fabiola are as bad as
though they went behind a bar and mixed
drinks is not true, I cannot express too
much abhorrence of gambling, but Dr.
Dille said altogether too much."
Mrs. George W. Morrow cannot under
stand why Dr. Dllle should have singled
out Fabiola when so many other institu- j
tJons have received similar benefits from i
the racing people. She says his remarks j
regarding the ladies are severe and un
truthful, but she has no fault to find with
his strong language directed against the
evil of gambling.
Next Saturday many of those who have
isne teams intend to decorate them and go
out to the track and make as much of a
lloral display as possible. There will be no
organized procession, but everybody is in
vited to use as many flowers as possible
and to make the day as gay and profit
able as it has been in former years.

ranger read the following rpbuke:
"It is with regTet that I feel compelled
to call to the attention of this order the
unlawful action of one of the accredited
representatives in issuing to subordinate
courts a misleading and scandalous cir
cular, calculated to cause distrust among
our new courts. This circular is false and
malicious, and is calculated to bring the
officers of the order into contempt I
earnestly recommend that this bromer be
dealt with according to law, in order that
6uch political chicanery may cease in our
order.
This evening the conference exemplified
several degrees. The cessions will last
several days.

WORDS OVER
EDWARDS DAVIS
Warm Discussion Between
Rev. F. J. Butler and
Mr. Sawyer.
The Latter Says That the Clergy Is
Too Slow With Its In
vestigation.
The discussion of the Edwards Davis
case Is warming up, and at the ministers"
meeting on Monday Rev. F. J. Butler and
Mr. Sawyer of the First Christian Church
of Oakland engaged in a wordy war re
, guxding that gentleman.
As moderator of the Christian Minis
ters' Association Mr. Butler found him
self called upon to read several letters
from Mr. Davis protesting against any
! investigation being held without giving
i him a chance to be present and defend
! himself. Mr. Sawyer then arose and ac
| cused the convention of trying to "white-
I wash" Davis, and said that one might
judge from the way In which they were
acting that Davis was the only holy man
j in the crowd and all the rest were sin
â  ners. He claimed that when he came out
, here he was told that the Central Church
j had a congregation numbering 250. In
i stead of that he had found an aggrega
! tion of about 250 with a membership of
about 100.
Mr. Butler took exception to all of these
remarks, and, calling Rev. F. S. Ford to
the chair, took the floor. He vigorously
denied that any of the brethren were try
! ing to whitewash Davis, but admitted
j that perhaps the ministers were acting
I slowly, as they were fearful of making
! any mistakes. Then followed a warm al
; tercation between the two men, Mr. Saw
j yer bristling with accusations, which Mr.
Butler was as ready to deny.
The meeting ended by the appointment
! of a committee consisting of Rev. F. S.
Ford, Dr. Berry and Mr. Hathaway to
arrange with the representatives of the
Central Church for an investigation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 11, 1898.
SHE SURPRISED
ALL THE CLUB
No One Expected That
Mrs. Bunnell Would
Resign.
Many Incidents Contributed to
Induce the President's
Action.
Several Candidates for thÂ« Vacant
Chair of Oakland's Leading
Club.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
7 908 Broadway, May 10.
The publication in The Call to-day of
the resignation of Mrs. Bunnell, presi
dent of the Ebell Society; was a great
surprise to the majority of the members. j
So quiet had the incident been kept that j
it was hardly known outside the board j
of directors. i,.; ;
At the luncheon to-day at the Ebell
Temple, Mrs. Bunnell's resignation was
the leading topic of conversation. There
has been a conflict of opinion in the club
since Mrs. John Russ returned rom \ the
East some months ago and read a paper j
that reflected somewhat, by comparison, |
upon the club. Then came Mrs. Swift of
San Francisco, and her remarks are still '
the subject of much discussion in the ]
Ebell. Her reference to the lack of in- j
terest shown by OaWand ladies in the j
Woman's Congress, and her statement j
that if the Congress were not equal in j
point of merit to a Melba concert It was ,
certainly as good as a pantomime or a |
circus, are still rankling deep in the 1
i Ebell's inner circle. At former congresses i
I Oakland ladies have taken a part, and j
a year ago Miss Ray Frank and Miss :
I Mollie Connors, two of Oakland's most in- ;
j tellectual women, had places on the pro- |
i gramme. This year Miss Connors was on
â  the programme, and it was known that
; her paper was prepared. But after Mrs.
i Swift's remarks a change evidently came
! over her, for her place in the congress
! was filled by some one else. - -j
Mrs. Bernard Moses, wife of the univer
! sity professor, who was also present at
'â  the meeting addressed by Mrs. Swift at
; the Ebell, figures In the present incident
that is agitating the attendance at the
white temple. Three years ago Mrs. Moses
was not pleased with something that
transpired at the Ebell, and the occasion i
! of Mrs. Swift's visit was the first time
1 since the unpleasantness that Mrs. Moses
I had attended. No one will ever know
1 jilst how much Mrs. Moses was effected
i by the remarks of Mrs. Swift, but at the
' meeting Mrs. President Bunnell announced
! that the ladies who were down on the
programme at the Ebell for the following
Saturday would not read their papers and
that there would be a change of the pro- j
ci Mrs m Bernard Moses was to have read
one of the papers and so far no one knows
I why she withdrew her name. These mat
! ters have been very freely discussed ,
' among the ladies, and there are a few :
who in some unaccountable manner are
; trying to fix in some degree upon Mrs.
: Bunnell the responsibility for the remarks
iof Mrs. Swift. As the speaker was the
guest of the Ebell, It has been decided
unanimously that no action should be
â¢ taken in the way of correcting the im
j pression made.* which the Ebell members
! think unjustifiable.^ the Red Cross So- !
The organization of the Red Cross So
i ciety, which is credited with being partly j
i responsible for the sudden resignation of |
â  President Bunnell and Mrs. Plnney, was
i in some measure due to the action of sev-
e ral prominent members of the knell. Al
' though it has been laid down as a rule
I many times by the Ebell that it would
not as an organization take up . any line
of work that is not directly connected
with its curriculum, still on some occa
sions the knowledge that a movement re- '
i ceives the moral support of the Ebell has
I been of marked benefit. The Red Cross
Society was organized in the Ebell Ter
n! pie and has drawn to itself considerable
i importance and popularity. Mrs. Bunnell
1 is supposed to have desired the election
i of Mrs. John Russ to the presidency of ;
' the Red Cross Society, but instead Mrs.
, Abbott was elected. The majority of the :
! members are positive in their assertions
! that Mrs. Bunnell is not actuated by any
j motives as this would seem to imply.
I But all agree that her resignation being
I tendered within a month of her election i
; for the ninth time shows that she has
1 been deeply moved at some occurrence
of which all are not aware. \ . ~'.
"Mrs. Bunnell's resignation we hope
! will be recalled," said a prominent mcm
i ber of the Ebell this afternoon. "The â 
ladies declined to receive it when tendered
last Friday, fully appreciating that the :
Ebell owes a great debt to the energy
and faithfulness shown by Mrs. Bunnell
during the past ten years. Certainly no I
small motive has caused her to take such ;
a step, and bo far the board of directors
has refused to even consider it. It will be i
more difficult for us to induce her to with
draw since the matter is made public,
i but she is necessary to the organization,
and I do not think any one wishes to see
her resign. The remark 3 of Mrs. Swift,
about which so much has been said, were
perhaps a trifle pointed, but there is no
doubt that our guest had in , mind the
progress of woman's work and wanted to
see Oakland doing its full share. Mrs.
Swift undoubtedly gave us the benefit of |
her candid opinion, and she . certainly, Is |
one of the most , conscientious women ;
workers in this State. I think It most j
probable that Mrs. Bunnell's resignation
was tendered because, she believes a i
change * would be desirable, : and for no i
other reason." â 
The candidates for the vacant presi- j
dency are Mrs. Frank Pierce. Mrs. A. W.
Bishop and Mrs. Prentlss Selby. , .
MISS WILDER SAYS IT IS FALSE.
Denies the Rumored Breaking Oft of
Her Engagement to Frank
linger.
Among the arrivals at the Occidental
Hotel on Monday were Mrs. J. L.
Travis, Miss Mary Johnson and Mis?
Helen Wilder, who came up from Hono
lulu on the R. P. Rithet. It will be re
membered that Miss Wilder is the lady to
whom Frank Unger has plighted his
troth, and only lately fhe latter gentle
man sailed for the islands to wed the
maiden of his choice. As soon as It was
known that the fair lady in the case had
reached this city, merciless dame rumor
attributed Miss Wilder's departure from
her island home to the fact that her en
gagement to Mr. Unger had been broken
off; that phe had not found the gentle
mnn all she expected him to be, etc.
Miss Wilder lastnight indignantly denied
the rumored breaking off of her engage
ment. She said: "The fact of the matter
IB that I came to California to recuperate
my temporarily failing health, which has
not been of the best of late, and that is
the only reason for my coming. Some of
my friends here, who came to see me im
mediately on my arrival, told me that
they heard that I was going to Europe
for an indefinite stay, and this probably
gave rise to the unkind rumor. I pro
pose to locate at Ben Lomond for most
of the time while here. In the course of
two months, by which time I hope to be
fully restored to perfect health. I shall
return to the islands and Mr. Unger and
myself will be married almost imme
diately after my arrival there."
Oyama Kenichi Deported.
Oyama Kenichi was turned over by the
United States Marshal yesterday to act
ing Japanese Consul Slgawa and left for
Japan in the afternoon. He was clerk
in Yokohama for a French contracting
firm. Pavre & Co., and induced his em
ployer to sign a Japanese paper on the
representation that it was a statement of
account with the Japanese Government,
for which the company was doing work.
It turned out to be an order on the Gov
ernment for 16.000 yen, equal to $7500,
which KenJchi appropriated. The sum of
$2014 in gold was found on his person, and
this sum was also handed over to the Jap
anese Consul.
CHAMPION OF MUSICAL ART
/^ x ISS EMILIE FRANCES
f I | BAUER, who is connected with
Ilia musical periodical of New
I*l York in the capacity of musical
r critic, and a recognized au
thority on music, is In the city
to Inquire into the conditions of mu
sical affairs on this coast Miss Bauer,
who has an Interesting personality and
Intellectual power far beyond the
ordinary, had some interesting things
to say to a "Call representative upon
the subject of the American music and
music in America, which she claims
to be two distinct phases of muÃic at
the present time.
"If you have been following the cru
sade of my periodical," she said,
"you will not need me to tell you any
thing, for you will know why those
who see things as they are are work-
Ing with their full strength against
conditions which, in a comparatively
Bhort time, must wreck all desire of
any ambitious native to go further in
his art.
"The enterprise which brought me to
this coast is an earnest endeavor to
better the condition of the American musician and to put him on a plane
with his foreign brethren. It is a recognized fact that an American artiÃt
Is without honor even in. his own country, unless, forsooth, he has received
a foreign veneering. I claim that It Is absolutely unnecessary for him to
go to a foreign country for his musical education, because we have lnsU
tutior.t in our own country where he can become equally as well educated
in musical art. My prime object, then, is the proper recognition of the
American musician and American music. This last is also, with a few ex
ception?, not properly recognized, and it is time that It should be.
"The work on which I am engaged is one that will reach not only the
musicians but the world, and will show a complete history of what Ameri
cans have done In tlie musical line, what their hardships have been and are,
the possibility of restoring things to a normal condition; who the American
workers are, what they are and where they are."
Miss Bauer further says that she finds a healthy tone in musical cir
cles in this city, a due appreciation of music being especially noticeable;
but even here she would wish to see a little more recognition of American
merit in that regard. She will have a fine San Francisco representation
in her work, and only of such men and women of whom the world ought
to know.

FIRST CHOICES
TOOK A HAND
Four Favorites Scored
and the Talent Got
the Money.
Rey del Tierra Beat His Field
in an Impressive
Style.
DukÂ« of York in Rare FormâWhale
back Finally Came AroundâHu
midity "Won in a Hard Drive.
A liberal list of entries and the prospect
t>f some more "uncorkings" attracted an
other good sized crowd to the races at
Oakland yesterday. While some out
siders showed to advantage in the differ
ent races decided it was a favorites' day,
four choices finishing in front. The bet
ting was brisk enough to suit the most
exacting penciler, and the talent more
than held its own.
The Kylo mare Wenoma was unloaded
for a good thing in the opening dash at
five and a half furlongs, and with Piggott
In the saddle led all the way, winning
ridden out from Celoso, the second
choice. The winner was backed down to
favoritism at post time.
A big field of twelve went to the post
In the four and a half furlong scramble
for maiden two-year-olds. The betting
favored Jimmy Coffe-'s -air, St. Kristine
and Violence, but Whaleback was in
front all the way and downed the former
filly two lengths. Martillo was coupled
with the winner in the betting, the pair
ruling second choices. â Â«.Â«.#
For the five furlong selling sprint tor
two-year-olds the Burns & Waterhouse
filly "Humidity closed a slight lavonte
over E. Come, the entry of the Montana
turfman, H. L. Frank. Woods managed
to keep the first choice in the lead from
the start, and hard ridden at the end got
the verdict by a neck in BS seconds flat.
Distance finished in the show.
Ed Purser's bay horse Rey del lierra
warmed up like a wild horse and was
rightfully installed a 2 to 1 favorite for
the mile and a sixteenu. selling run, de
cided under selling conditions. Clawson
managed to get him away from the post
poorly, but when straightened for home
ran through his field, and catching the
leader. Polish, below the paddock, led
the latter past the judges over two
lengths. Sweet Faverdale was a fair
third.
Mocorito was dished up as a redhot one
for the seven furlong selling affair and
after leading her company into the
stretch began stopping badly with Woods,
and ended up in fourth place. Clawson,
on the 6 to 1 chance Duke of York, came
with a rush the last sixteenth and beat
out the second choice, imp. Missioner,
four lengths. Bonnie lone, with EnosÂ» up,
and a 100 to 1 shot in the ring, heavily
played to get the show, finished third.
The last event of the day, a mile selling
run, proved an easy thing for the 2 to 1
favorite Fortuna. with Mike Hennessy
in the saddle. The old mare showed her
heels to the bunch from the start, and
though inclined to stop at the end, lasted
long enough to down Rapido a head.
Navy Blue, a 40 to 1 chance, badly crowd
ed on the rail, was a bang-up third, but a
head further away.

De La Montanyas Remarried.
There is a big rumpus in the De La
Montanya family of this city in conse
quence of the remarriage of the son,
James, with his divorced wife, the daugh
ter of Judge Spencer of San Jose. The
wedding took place in Napa last Satur
day but the plan of the young folks to
have the incident kept secret for a while
accidentally leaked out. The desire for
secrecy was caused by the fear of the son
that his father would disinherit him.
The troubles of the couple date back four
years when there was a divorce granted,
the father being awarded the custody of
the little boy and the mother that of the
daughter. Since then the case has been
in the courts of two countries, the father
having obtained another divorce in the
courts of France, which gave him the
custody of both children. Upon returning
to this country another fight was made
for the children, who were awarded to
the grandparents. A while ago the prin
cipals came together and adjusted their
differences, and decided to elope and get
mail ltd.

CLEVER BURGLARS
PLY THEIR TRADE
The Establishment of Gallagher
& Peters Entered by
Thieves.
After a decade of uselessness, except aa
a fixture that lent dignity to a neat lit
tle office, a small safe was put to use
in the establishment of Gallagher & Pet
ers, Bryant street, near Fourth, last Sat
urday night and $61 35 graced one of the
interior coffers. Yesterday morning, how
ever, the money graced the pockets of
some industrious burglar or burglars, and
the beauty of the safe was considerably
impaired.
Saturday evening James Gallagher, one
of the partners of the firm, placed the
money in the safe to pay several little
bills that fell due yesterday morning.
When Mr. Gallagher and his partner re
turned to their work after the Sabbath
rest they were followed closely by a col
lector, and Gallagher went to the safe
to get the money. He opened the out
side door, which showed no evidences of
a burglar's visit, without difficulty when,
to his surprise, he noticed that several
drill holes disfigured. the face of the steel
money box. He unlocked it. however,
reached his hand Into the box for the j
coin, but it was gone. An investigation I
disclosed the fact that after the box had |
been removed it was broken open with I
some sharp instrument and its contents
taken.
Just how the burglars entered the es
tablishment is a mystery, as all the doors
were securely barred in front and the
windows as far as can be ascertained
were not disturbed, but in any event they
found an entrance. The case was re
ported to the police, and detectives are
searching for the safe crackers.
Bejected Native Sons.
Eight Chinamen who claimed to be na
tives of San Francisco, who arrived on
the Peking, were refused a landing by the
Collector yesterday.

WILL QUIT
AS BELCHER
H AS ASKED
The Grand Jurors Had
Many Lively Inter
necine Wars.
Could Not Agree on the
Indictment of Many
Accused Persons.
Some Roundly Denounced by
Others as a Band of Use
less Inquisitors.
NEW JURY TO BE CALLED.
JudflÂ«s Hope That the Next Body Will
Proceed to Business With
out Delay.
Foreman Gerberdlng has decided
that he will not accept Judge Belcher's
suggestion that the Grand Jury meet
between now and Thursday, and indict
such persons as it had on the list.
In spite of Judge Belcher's caustic
criticism of the jury for its failure to
indict men high in power there are
many members of the jury who refuse
to resent the aspersions of the wearer
of the ermine.
A number of jurors refused to dis
cuss Grand Jury matters yesterday,
and most of them were glad Judge
Belcher notified them to come into
court and be discharged.
The language which some of the
prominent Grand Jurors are reported to
have used concerning others of
the same august body is decidedly unfit
for publication. From the outset of
the jury's investigations it became ap
parent, so some of the members say,
that there would be frequent disagree
ments in matters that concerned prom
inent offenders in the School Board and
the Harbor Commission. In spite of
that fact the jury succeeded on Mon
day night in getting an admission
from a prominent man that he had no
account of the lumber sold to the
School Department. Some of the ju
rors say they would have succeeded in
getting out a true bill had they been
allowed to proceed, but when the
Judge's summary order came to them
Monday night they resolved to adjourn
without delay and give up the work in
disgust. Their original programme will
not be varied.
Another interesting feature of the
deliberations of the indicting body that
did not indict is the fact that they es
tablished a sort of trial court early
in their proceedings. Whenever a man
was charged with some grave offense
they not only heard all that was to be
said against him, but they extended to
him the benign influence and protec
tion of the doctrine that gives every
body a hearing. This resulted in parti
sanship in the jury room, for all cases
have some phase that will win friends
in a panel of jurors.
It is Judge Belcher's intention to call
another Grand Jury at an early date,
and it is the general hope of the public
that the new jury will be able to agree
on several important matters now be
fore the attention of the authorities.
USED CUPID AS
A HANDY BAIT
Matrimonial Agent Fecker
Must Answer a Crimi
nal Charge.
Joseph Neuman Think* He Was
Bunkoed Into Buying a Bad
Business.
The Interesting suit wherein Joseph
Neuman charges C. Fecker with obtaining
money by a bunko scheme will be heard
by Judge Low to-day. It is a suit that
will throw some light on the way mar
riage bureaus are conducted in this city
by some of those who serve Cupid in the
capacity of agents.
Fecker sold Neuraan a half Interest in
his business for $200. He represented, so
Neuman says, that he was making a
great deal of money out of psychology
and matrimony. Neuman was caught
by a drag-net business card, which con
tained the following conglomerate an
nouncements:
C. Pecker, principal of the California In
stitute of Psychology; also professor of the
Principles and Practice of Human Magnetism,
Hypnotism and Suggestive Therapeutics. Lec
turer at the .California Psychic Club. Editor
of the California Hypnotic Journal. Eleven
yearn active practice In San Francisco. Office
hours from 10 to 12 a. m. ; S to 5 p. m., and 7
to 8 p. m. Instructions private or In classes.
Free clinic for the needy from 10 to 11 a. m.
dally. Real estate and general business brok
ers. Patents of all kinds handled and put on
the market. Businesses of all kinds sold and
exchanged. Insurance solicited. Lodging
houses a specialty. T-ioans negotiated. Our
mottoâ square dealings. Partners and mort
gagee secured. Correspondence In English. Ger
man and Scandinavian languages. All pur
chasers are held responsible :or our commis
sion If money !s not paid through this office.
Neuman says that he was soon dis
gusted by the small returns and by the
fact that Fecker wanted his wife to act
ror the bureau. He asked her to meet
men who advertised for wives and pre
tend that she was anxious to get mar
ried. Hp will claim that the business was
a bunuko affair and that he swallowed a
bait in the form of a half-interest
swindle.
"SPUDS" FOR THE BALDWIN.
Mrs. Klahoney Tells How the Million-
aire Came to Borrow Money
From Her.
Justice of the Peace Carroll yesterday
hc-ard testimony in the suit brought by
the widow of the late Senator Mahoney
to recover $65 from E. J. Baldwin. Mrs.
Mahoney testified that In 1895 F. B. Dex
ter. Baldwin's brother-in-law, borrowed
$100 from Mahoney and $20 from her to
pay a vegetable bill for the Baldwin Ho
tel". Baldwin had since repaid $56, but all
her efforts to collect the balance were
fruitless. Dexter testified that he bor
rowed the money on his own account and
not for the hotel.
Baldwin swore the money was not for
hotel purposes, but that he had agreed
to pay $60. Of this he had paid $55 and
still owed $5, which he was willing to pay.
The attorneys will submit briefs, each be
ing allowed five days to do so.
Father Yorke to Lecture.
The Rev. Father Yorke will lecture at
St. Teresa's Church at 7:30 o'clock on
Sunday evening. May 15. The subject
â will be "Catholic and Protestant Coun
tries Compared." The proceeds will be
devoted to liquidating the expense of
frescoing the church of St. Teresa, .
TOTAL LOSS

IN YOKOHAMA IN DISTRESS.
After Having Been Repaired She
Sailed to Her Doom on
China's Coast
The British tramp steamer Amara
poora, which was in such a peck of
trouble when she was on this coast, has
THE UNFORTUNATE AMARAPOORA.
She was the most unlucky tramp that ever came to this coast. Hard
luck followed her from Panama to Puget Sound, and when she was not
libeled in the courts she was in trouble with the customs authorities.
After being In the repair shop at Yokohama for six months she sailed for
China only to become a total wreck in the Shan Tung Peninsula.
been wrecked on the Shan Tung Penin
sula, China, and will be a total loss.
The fate of her crew is as yet unknown.
The news came- in a cable to the Mer
chants' Exchange yesterday, and was
the one topic amongr shipping men on
the water front.
The Amarapoora came to this coast
about two years ago, and from the time
she dropped anchor in San Francisco
Bay up to her wreck she was almost
constantly in trouble. There is hardly
a port from Panama to Vancouver but
what she has been libeled in. In San
Jose de Guatemala Captain Cameron
was in trouble over his cargo of coal.
In Mexico he was at outs with the cus
tom house authorities, and his vessel
was seized on two occasions in this
port, the crew libeling her for their
wages. In Tacoma and Seattle she was
held for weeks at a time on different
occasions because the money was not
forthcoming with which to pay the
merchants who fitted her out. In Octo-
her last the Amarapoora left San Fran
cisco, after satisfying a Judgment In
the United States District Court, and
went to Puget Sound to load lumber for
Tientsin, China. She was ; In trouble !
there again on < account of money due 1
the crew, but finally got away, and on
November 20 put ' into Yokohama in j
distress. That was the beginnings of
the end. Things went from bad to
worse, and on 1 January 19 last the sur
veyors refused to give, her a certificate
of seaworthiness. Finally her cargo of
lumber, was â¢ discharged and another
survey was held, which resulted inner
boilers being ordered ? overhauled and
considerable work being done on the
hull. While the repairs 1 1 were g being
made the men in the engineers' de
partment were constantly fighting
among themselves, and I the result was
several cases in the British â  Admiralty
Court in.Yokohama. ,
When the 'â  Peking sailed . from Yoko
hama on April IB last the Amarapoora
was still In that port, but she was ! ex
pected to get away. in a short time. The
surveyors must therefore have; given
her a certificate of : seaworthiness, ( and
she must have made another start for
Tientsin. 1 The chances * are : that * she
must have; been caught in a typhoon in
the Yellow Sea and driven on the rocky
shore of Shan .Tung. The Amarapoora
was built in 1874 at Greenock, England,
and was owned by J. W. Adamson. She

She is 1344 tons net burden, 285 feet

inches deep and was built in England
in 1896. Upon receipt of telegraphic
instructions she followed the fleet to
Manila and after discharging her coal
would probably return to Hongkong
for further supplies. The name of the
second vessel purchased by Admiral
Dewey as a storeship was not brought
over by the Peking.
The gold hunters who came from the
East on the schooner Lev! Woodbury
received a letter from Boston yester
day which gave some of them a scare.
It contained news to the effect that the
schooner Julia E. Whalen, which left
Boston 145 days ago with another party
of fortune seekers, had been captured
by a Spanish cruiser. When they came
to think it over, however, the men re
membered that the Whalen, Concord
and Woodbury had passed out of the
Straits of Magellan in company, and
as there have been no Spanish cruisers
heard of in the Pacific since Dewey
captured the Manila fleet they came to
the conclusion that the story was with
out foundation. The chances are that
both the Whalen and Concord have
been delayed by strong headwinds
which have prevailed along the coast
for some weeks past.
The steamer Gaelic sailed for Hong
kong via Honolulu and Yokohama yes
terday. She took away an unusually
large cargo and a considerable quan
tity of treasure which the Chinese mer
chants here were afraid to ship in an
American bottom on account of the
war.
Boys broke into the Tiburon ferry
depot last Monday night and raided the
fruit stand. They broke a pane of
glass and passed the smallest of their
number through. When he got inside
he passed out nearly all of the cigars,
cigarettes, chewing gum and candy In
the place and made his escape. Ser
geant Tom Mahoney is on the trail of
the culprits and expects to make some
arrests to-day.
The most impatient man on the water
front yesterday was Captain White
side of the bark Northern Light. He
fully expected to get away for Kotze-
bue Sound early In the morning, but
there was such a continuous rush of
freight throughout the day that he had
to postpone sailing until this morning.
POLICEMAN MURPHY
IN DEEP DISGRACE
When Caught in a Saloon He
Threatened to Assault
Sergeant Brophy.
Lieutenant Hanna Allowed Him to
Patrol His Beat, Knowing He
Was Intoxicated.
Policeman Joseph F. Murphy of the
southern station will have to answer
to a charge of drunkenness at the next
meeting of the Police Commissioners.
Several nights ago Sergeant Brophy met
Murphy and concluding that he was un
der the influence of liquor he requested
him to accompany him to the Southern
station. Lieutenant Hanna was in charge,
and notwithstanding, it is claimed, that
he at once detected that Murphy had
been drinking, he sent him back to his
beat with the admonition not to "touch
another drop."
A short time afterward Sergeant Bro
phy discovered Murphy in a saloon on
Brannan street. He was under the in
fluence of liquor, and when Brophy called
him to account Murphy became belliger
ently indignant and defied his superior
officer to prefer charges against him. As
Murphy was in an ugly mood and rather
than cause a scene Brophy again visited
the Southern station and reported the
facts to Lieutenant Hanna. As the lat
ter showed a disposition to protect the
erring officer Brophy waited until Mur
phy reported off duty.
Shortly after 6 o'clock he staggered into
the assembly room of the Southern sta
tion. Captain Spillane happened to be
present and he at once ordered Brophy
to prefer charges against him.
It is not unlikely that Lieutenant Han
na will be called upon by the Commis
sioners to explain his action in sending
Murphy back to his beat knowing at the
time that he was under the influence of
liquor.
Captain Spillane was indignant when
he heard of Hanna's error, and severely
"roasted" him for what he termed his
blundering methods.
Widber's Bondsmen Sued.
An attempt will be made to recover on
the $100,000 bond given by the Fidelity
and Deposit Company of Maryland to
guarantee the faithful performance of his
duties by A. C. Widber, City Treasurer,
who is $117,000 short in his accounts. The
guarantee company has refused to pay
the bond, and suit was commenced yester
day in the name of the people of thg. 2Â»Â£iÂ£

Thefts, the Officers Consult
Chief Lees.
VALUABLES ARE TAKEN.
One of the Men Relieved of a
Diamond Ring and His
Watch.
The soldiers at the Presidio are indlg
| nant over the loss of many valuable arti
cles which were stolen from them by
some clever thieves. A private named
Carlson was robbed of a gold watch and
his papers while he was asleep in his
tent. Several other privates were robbed
in a similar manner, and as they are
anxious .to catch the thieves they decided
to enlist the services of the police. Last J
night one of the officers of the garrison
visited police headquarters and invoked
the aid of Chief Lees In finding the cul
prits.
HÂ© gave a description of the property
taken as far as he knew, and requested
the Chief to do all in his power to arrest
the thieves.
Since the militia went to camp at the
Presidio the members have been syste
matically robbed of their valuables. Sev
eral suspicious characters were arrested,
but as nothing of an Incriminating nature
was found on them they were released.
In view of the frequent losses of the sol
diers the officer in charge has issued or
ders not to allow any person to pass the
gates unless he is known.
A private named Riley mourns the loss
of a diamond ring, a purse containing $14
and a silver watch. He was asleep in his
tent, when the thief cleverly relieved mm
of the valuables. Suspecting that one of
his bedfellow soldiers had taken the
valuables, "just as a joke," as he ex
pressed it, Riley questioned them; but as
they professed ignorance of the where
abouts of the money and jewelry, he be
came alarmed, and notified the captain of
the regiment. The following day another
private, named Becker, was robbed of a :
watch and a small amount in money. As
the thefts continued, the men in camp
grew justly indignant, and informed their
superior officer. Instructions were issued
to the sentinels not to allow any person
to enter the tents unless they had the
password. Despite the vigilance of the
sentinels, the soldiers continued to lose
their valuables. As the last extreme, the
commanding officer decided to inform the
police, with the hope of locating the cul
prit.
After learning of the numerous thefts
Chief Lees at once detailed De
tectives Silvey and Graham to make an
investigation and, If possible, arrest the
thieves. Last night they recovered a por
tion of the stolen, property In several
pawnshops, where it had been disposed of
by the pilferers.
As they have a good description of the
men, they confidently expect to arrest
them.
EXCITEMENT IN
THE WHEAT PIT
Harry Wise Buys BOOOTons of
December in a Single Trans
action.
A Prediction That Prices Will Rule
Still Higherâ No Friends for
Barley.
Yesterday's wheat market was one of
extreme excitement from the opening un
til the gong sounded closing the day's
trading.
The local market acted in keeping with
that of Chicago. Early Liverpool cables
quoted wheat futures 6 cents higher.
Paris showed an advance of 1 franc.
Foreign markets were less excited than
traders generally had anticipated, and
this caused an easy opening. July started
at $1 17@1 18, against $1 27 on the curb the
afternoon previous.
At the opening, commission houses
bought freely. Much of the trading was
said to be for foreign account. The price
jumped 1 cent at a time until $1 25 was
reached. May sold at $1 87. Armours
brokers sold auout 2,000,000 of July over
$1 20. The local market was presented
with all kinds of newsâ bearish, bullish
and otherwiseâ before the opening. Prices
at the start were only fractionally lower
than those at the close Monday. The
weakness in closing English cables caused
long holders and shorts to sell freely. By
noon December wheat had sold down to
$1 72>4, with one or two faint rallies.
The Government report issued at noon
yesterday was regarded as bearish by the
trade. The report makes winter wheat
acreage 6 per cent and the condition 7 per
cent greater than on May 1 last year. The
effect of this report gave an easier feeling
to wheat in Eastern markets, the weak
ness being reflected in the local trading.
During the afternoon session December
sold at $1 71 at the opening to *1 72^4 at
the close. The late strength was caused
by Harry Wise bidding for wheat. After
he left the pits shorts began hammering
the market. On the curb $1 71^i was
asked.
Prices may temporarily work somewhat
lower, but everything points to much
higher prices before many weeks pass by.
Barley appears to have no friends. Few
buyers were to be seen. December found
no buyers at $1 31, against $1 33 yester
day. The demand for spot has fallen off to
comparatively nothing, heavy imports of
corn from the East being the chief cause.
The largest single transaction executed
on the call board In the past year was
the selling of 5000 tons of December wheat
at $1 79 by E. A. Bresse to Harry Wise.
Sugar in Abundance.
The annual meeting and election of offi
cers of -the Hutchinson; Sugar. Plantation
Company was held r yesterday \ afternoon,
and the yearly report of President Burke
on the ; condition . of , the company â  for the
I past i year, including c the assets v and ; lia
bilities and the prospects for the future,
was presented. The total amount of sugar
received from â  the plantation : for '; the < fis
cal \ year - ending t March â¢ 31, ' 1898; was 7939

BENEFIT
Tickets on Sale To-
Day at the Orpheum
Theater.
Great Performance Prom
ised by the Volunteer
A rtists.
Business Men to Meet To-Day
at the Chamber of Com
merce.
FUNDS ARE BADLY NEEDED
Much Encouragement Is Being Given
the Ladles With Subscription
Lists.
The sale of tickets for the benefit per
formance to be given at the Orpheum for
the Red Cross Society on Thursday after
noon commences this morning at the box
office of the theater. Seats in all parts of
the house on the main floor will be 50
cents and in the gallery the seats will be
sold at 25 cents. The managers are pre
paring for a rush, and they believe more
than half the house will be disposed of
during the first day. The performance as
arranged will be one of the best that the
house has offered for many weeks. Every
one of the performers is immensely in
terested in the work of the Red Cross So
ciety, and many of them have friends
who are now in the tents at the Presidio
waiting for the order to move to Manila,
and they do not propose to let them go
without doing at least some little act that
will bring them comfort should they be
come ill or wounded while in the distant
islands.
Every cent that will be taken in at the
box office will go to the fund of the Red
Cross Society. The managers of the the
ater have placed the house at the disposal
of the organization, and the performers,
the members of the orchestra and the
mechanics and stage hands have gladly
volunteered their services. Many persons
talented in the art of entertaining have
volunteered to assist the members of the
company of vaudeville artists now billed
at the theater, and a most unique and in
teresting performance will be given.
The collecting committee of the Red
Cross Society were hard at work yester
day, and when the rooms of the society
in the Claus Spreckels building were
closed for the day the bank account of
the organization had been doubled as a
result of their worâ The Bank of Cali
fornia gave a check for $250 and Anton
Borel added a like sum to the fund. Louis
Sloss, G. Niebaum, Lewis Gerstle, J.
Downey Harvey and L. E. Johnson each
gave $100. Daniel Meyer sent a check for
$50 and Mrs. Henry L. Dodge and Mrs.
Cyrus Walker gave $25 each. Fred S.
Johnson and E. H. Horton each gave a
big twenty-dollar gold piece. The chil
dren of the Washington Grammar School
added $40 to the fund and the Philomath
Club sent a check for $53 that its members
hal contributed to the work of the so
ciety. The London, Paris and American
Bank, the Anglo-California Bank and the
London and Lancashire Fire Insurance
Company swelled the fund by $100 each.
The Manual Training Club and the kin
dergarten school of the French Christian
Union sent $10 as their union subscription
to the work of the society.
Mrs. J. G. Clark, who attended a meet
ing of the Red Cross Society that was
organized in Vallejo on Monday, reported
to her associate workers that much sub
stantial support could be expected from
them. Mrs. Xewcomb was the president
of the organization, with Mrs. George H.
Peabody financial secretary, Mrs. Alice
Holt recording secretary and Rev. Mr.
Williams vice-president.
Word was received during the day that
Colonel Otis of Los Angeles would take
the initiative to organize a Red Cross so
ciety in the lower part of the State, and
he promised that the people of Los An
geles would respond handsomely to the
call to assist the work of the Red Cross
among the soldiers who have been called
from this State.
A special meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce has been called for this after
noon at 2:30, to take some action to assist
the work of the society. All the busi
ness men of the city are invited and are
e.x"pected to be present. Persons familiar
with the work of the Red Cross on the
field of battle will address the meeting.
The ladies of Seven Pines Circle, an
auxiliary to the G. A. R., have made a
cash donation to the Red Cross League.
When the trouble with Spain began they
forwarded a set of resolutions to the
President, expressing confidence in the
administration, and received a very
pleasing answer. â_. ,
The fadies of St. Stephen's Episcopal
Church met In St. Stephen's Hall yester
day afternoon to discuss plans for aiding
the Red Cross Society in its work. Ihe
rector. Rev. E. J. Lion, presided at the
mo"t!np and suggested that ladies work
independently of and in concert with the
Red Cross organization. His suggestion
was taken up by the ladies present, and
they decided to appoint a committee to
visit the headquarters of the league and
ascertain in what manner they could
give the most assistance. A list will be
procured of the articles of which there is
the greatest need and each of the ladies
will endeavor to procure as large a quan
tity of these as possible. Supplies will be
received by the Ladies' Aid Society of the
church, who will send them to the head
quarters of the society for distribution.

REGENTS SHOW
PATRIOTISM
Decide to Allow a Professor
Full Pay During His
Enlistment.
Additional Compensation to Bo Paid
Attaches of thÂ« Stato
University.
j- The Regents of the University of Call
1 fornia paused in their arduous labors of
discussing the report of the committee on
i finance and audit yesterday to give vent
to their patriotism. The departure was
brought about by Judge Wallace moving
that Lieutenant A. P. Hayne, an assist
ant professor in the department of agri
culture, be allowed half pay during his
i absence as a volunteer soldier. Regent
! Halllday forgot the scarcity of funds and
i enthusiastically amended the motion by
! making it full pay. Regent J. E. Budd
added his voice by saying that if any stu
dent or professor in the university de
sired to enlist in their country's defense
he should be given leave of absence and
full pay.
At another time during the session the
spark of patriotism was again fanned
into flame. Regent Budd was speaking
in favor of raising the salary of Professor
Syle of the department of English to
$1800. This was discussed at a previous
meeting, at which time Regent Houghton
opposed the raise on tne ground that the
professor had uttered unpatriotic senti
ments in a lecture at Berkeley. Budd
read letters of professors who had attend
ed the lecture, in which they declared
Professor Syle had been grossly mis
quoted by tne press. He then defended
the latter and spoke in glowing terms of
his ability and worth. In defending him
j self Mr. Houghton said that the remarks
he had made were based on reports he
had read in the morning papers, in which
the professor compared the United States
with the Roman empire, and that Syle
had been reported as saying that the
i vices of the Roman empire were preva
lent in the United States, and the end
of this country would be like Rome.
Regent Black indorsed the lecture as
one of the most patriotic he had ever
heard, saying iV was along the line of
Kipling's great poem, ".Lest We Forget."
Judge Foote eloquently defended Berke
ley's representative, saying that one
brought up under the shades of Berkeley
could not be disloyal.
After the wave had passed the members
agreed to advance Professor Syle's salary
if Professor W. D. Armes of the same de
partment received the same treatment. A
compromise was easily effected and both
professors will receive $1800 per annum.
Herman Schussler, Colonel Walker and
Gustav Gutch were appointed emeritus
professors at the university without sal-
ary.
The following attaches of the university
will receive additional compensation for
their services: E. W. Davis, Rebecca
Meyerstein, May L. Cheney, R. H. Jones,
J. D. Layman, *C. K. Jones, J. Gillick, F.

THE SEWER EVIL.
Board of Health Takes Steps to lies-
sen the Imminent Danger Caused
by Deadly Gases.
A conference was held yesterday be
tween the Board of Health and the mem
bers of the former Sewer CommlMion
for the purpose of abating, if possible,
the danger of contagion arising from thÂ«
present defective sewer system. There
were present Drs. Morse, Fitzgibbon.
Hart and Williamson and Professor
George Davidson. Marsden Manson, Her
man Schussler and George F. Allardt ot
the former Sewer Commission. Professor
Davidson said the chief danger was from
diphtheria caused by sewer gas. He said
the sewers were ventilated chiefly through
connections with residences, and he ad
vised that all vent holes be closed to
prevent the escape of gas. The sewers
should also be thoroughly flushed from
time to time.
Mr. Schussler said the flushing should
be done under the personal supervision ot
the Board of Health, and even the most
thorough flushing would not entirely
eradicate the evil, owing to the faulty
construction of the sewers.
Mr. Manson said that of 240 miles of
sewers inspected by the commission less
than five miles were properly constructed.
It would cost $4,000,000 to build an effi
cient sewer system for the city.
It was finally decided to ask the Super
visors to take some action toward abat
ing the evil, and that the two boards co
operate for the improvement of the sewer
system.
