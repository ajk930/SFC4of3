western end of the field the panorama
*â¢Â£Â» different. Stafford** warrlon
h&d been surrounded by their support
ers, who ministered to them the con
solation that goes with defeat. Gently,
silently, they. . too. led their scarrred
heroes from the white-lined arena. I
saw the plucky cardinal weep its first
tears. The Bight was new to the Stan

they cried, nor % realized that It was
nature's remedy to meet the reaction of
their tenaioned faelings.
The day was fine and the field fit.

Captain Fisher chose the eastern goal
and California took the ball.
At 13 minutes to 3 o'clock Ref
eree Goodwin blew his whistle and the
annual contest was on. There was a
deathlike silence when Kaarsburg sent
the bell down Into Stanford's territory.
There was a brief exchange of punts
and then â yes, strange but true. Cali
fornia withstood three terrific on
slaughts on their line. It was their ball
on downs. That woe the beginning of
the end.
Kaarsburg and Hall,""" on r two- runs,
skirted tfeÂ« cardinal's ends for seventy
> yards and tlsair smypoTrers went wlia.
Steadily the ball was forces down by
[ line plunges and rwlft skirts cf Stan
\ ford's end until It retted a yard from
i the goal line. California was cheering
. -wildly. Stanford was client. Then came
Â» the star play of the game from a. spec
. â¢ tacular point. Hall was sent at th*
center and fumbled. It was Stanford 1

I kicked the ball straight up Into the

THE University of California men clearly outclassed the Stanford
team more than the men of the latter outclassed us last year. We
looked for a much harder game than the one we played. Murphy
vvas outpunted by Kaarsburg, which was a surprise to some peo
ple. In the first half our men were a little nervous and played
too careful a game. After they sized up their men they did better.
The team work, whkh won the game, was drilled into the boys by

We hope next year's team will be able to win. The players have a

hearts thumping at their ribs. The toe
of the California fullback swung to
ward the pigskin and instantly the
gridiron battle of 1898 was on.
The action that followed was defense,
offense, quick sallies here and there;
flank charges, massings on the cen'*v;
brilliant dashe? around the ends, all
serving to crumble one side in the dust
and raise the other to a pinnacle erf
temporary fame. First it was Hail
who would skirt the Stanford line, and,
with diminutive Thane interfering, pass
line after line until downed by gallant
Murphy of the red, bleeding, frenzied
and ashen with despair. Then Smith,
the freshman, or, as his sobriquet runs,
"Locomotor," would find gaps that
Pringle toTe apart and both would go
down the field together. "Like a genu
ine eight-wheeler," some one remarked
on the side lines, and the Stanford
team, wrecked from the onslaught.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1898.
looked as if it had just passed through
a tete-a-tete with an iron horse.
Thane would give thu signal and
away the team would rush at the cen
ter, either tackle or arÂ«mnd I,he ends.
When California had the ball ground
gaining was assured. Do what they
would neither Wilson nor liush, on
whom Stanford had built its hopes,
could stem the tide. California's united
efforts, concentrated attack, vimful
plunges kept churning and churning
the red men and leaving in its wake
heart-sore disappointment, shattered
hopes and supine athletes.
Undoubtedly the day was unilateral.
The score is a false register of a com
parative estimate of the teams. Were
it not for fumbles and momentary team
dissolution the blue and gold would
have added other points to their twen
ty-two and the cardinal would have
other bitter doses of touchdowns and
goals to swallow. The master hand of
Garrett Cochran was back of it all, he
with his refined sense of football wis
dom. The well-ordered attacks, the
catapultic rams, the precision of the
play and the hand-to-hand support left
Stanford for the first time a beaten
team, dying hard in fierce struggle.
What impressed the spectator most
was the chagrin and wonderment that
filled the Stanford players when the
blue and gold began Its battery fire.
Parker, Ray Smith, Wilson, Rusk,
Forrest Fisher and gritty "Chet" Mur
phy, veterans of noble achievements
on the gridiron, saw defeat before
them. It was novel, an experience to
which they could not adapt themselves,
and they floundered in the deep sea of
indecision. Their efforts to repel the
forceful buttings of the strategic on
slaughts proved impotent, yet they
worked on and on, knowing only too
well that scarred, inky defeat was their
portion of the Thanksgiving feast.
Like the Black Tyrone, California
had seen its own blood and the demon
was in the men. Their coach politely
told each man of the team that if he
saw any signs of slowing-up he would
commit eleven murders during the j
evening. Whether It was the fear of
the realization of this threat â for
Cochran is a serious young man â or
the spirit that was in them it is hard
to pay. Certain it is they did play foot
ball in fierce, reckless style.
Now for the game.
Kaarsburg's kick-off gave the ball to
Murphy on Stanford's 30-yard line.
Then the cardinal tested California's
line. Twice the red men hurled them
selves' against the blue - and gold.
Twice were they repulsed, and a great
cheer went up from thousands of on
lookers. Murphy was forced to punt,
but it was not his old-style, quick
kicking for great distances. .Smith and
Hall were used for plays on tackle and
then.lvaarsburg fumbled, surrendering
the -coveted pigskin to rth^v-;. cardinal
forty, yards from the California goal.
Again Stanford assailed the California
bulwarks, only to meet with failure,
and again Murphy was forced to' punt.
"Billy" Harrelson, stanchest of â¢ Stan
fordites, said it was all off with the
cardinal, and Code's heart was sore.
California had demonstrated. its ability
on the defensive, and the eye of the
expert realized the conditions.
Hot was the fight, and the battle
raged fiercely on the California "J."
yard line when one of the many fum
bles was allowed a chance to work. For
the nonce the god of cardinal warriors
whs with them. It was the Stanford
ball twenty-five yards from the stick
ing place. Could they do it? was the
question everybody asked. Cochran
crouching on the lines and Crops pray
ing between closed teeth, ground their
finger nails into their hands. Hot and
full Went Fisher against the phalanx
before him. No gain, and the blue and
gold sections were instinct with sudden
life. Another try at honor. Dole was
selected, but his efforts were choked In
their infancy and he staggered to earth
without the gain of ground. One more
chance remained. Would the ends of
California waver? The left was tried
and the discovery made. California's
line was a fortress and the blue and
gold secured the ball.
The pent-up enthusiasm of seven
years was given a chance to split thi;
heavens in twain, for the backs of the
blue and gold were called into action.
Kaarsburg, with the leather tucked un
der his arm, started down the field be
hind good interference. Thane put Ray
Smith out of the play, and away went
the fullback like an 'explosion. He was
discovered on the California 50-yard
line. Percy Hall repeated Kaarsburg's
fleet run and the crowd went wild
again. "Ten to five on Berkeley." yelled
a bettor in the pack behind the fence.
The bet was not taken.
Kaarsburg was given the ball, with
the scent of victory in his nostrils. He
was too anxious, fumbled it after he
broke through the opposing line, and
Murphy became the possessor. Then
thf Stanford men drew their breaths.
Words of encouragement came from the
captain â "Steady, now. boys; steady
and we will win." For the first time
California's line weakened and gains
were made through the left side, but it
was only of short duration. Hardly had
eight yards of territory been covered
when the blue and gold held their oppo
nents, and Murphy was forced to kick
again.
The pigskin belonged to the Berkeley
men on their own 40-yard line. Seventy
yards separated them from a touch
down and it was now or never. Captain
Hall exhorted his team to play ball
nnd not to conduct themselves like chil
dren. An off-side play of Stanford gave
the blue and gold a present of ten yards
of the Recreation Park, but not for
keeps. Dashing, smashing. Percy Hall
was itching for a run. Around Ray
Smith's end he sailed, riding the seas.
Toppled-over red shirts marked his
track of twenty-five yards, and the blue
and gold bleachers became animate
"EARNEST FOOTBALL WON,"
SAYS COACH COCHRAN.
1 HOPED for such a result, but feared it would not happen. I have 4
nothing to say but words of thanks to the boys who played Stan- â¢*
ford to a standstill. They were a team, playing hard, earnest -â¦
Football every minute. What annoyed me was the inexplicable -i
fumbling which I cannot understand. Captain Hall is deserving of -i
the credit of the victory which was obtained by hearty co-operation -4
and by the men working together every minute of the day. The H
game was full of excitement for a time, but after a certain period of â¢<
the second half there was only one team in the field. Stanford fell â¢>
to pieces when we recovered from stage fright and began to work - 1
as a team. â *

I again. The touchdown: xnat was vie <
thing, and Hall bucked again. Five 1
yards nearer was he to five points, s
Pete Kaarsburg went over the center, j
high up in the air, a gymnastic feat, for \
another five yards. "Bang," "Smash, i
"Puncture," "Perforate," came the i
commands from the grandstand. "Lo
comotor" Smith tried to do it all at ]
i once in five yards' running. 1
The pigskin rested peacefully on the f
Stanford five-yard line, and it was the 1
treasure of California. "Fight, you red
devils!" roared a Stanford graduate.
Hall came at the Stanford line with a
whack. A single yard was his meed.
He tried again. The two lines closed and
tussled and pushed.
It meant victory for one side and de
feat for the other. Stanford again held
the Berkeley charger. One more try.
The quivering athletes in red, well
nigh sending their teeth through their
jaws and into their heads, bent low for
the supreme effort. Murphy cheered
his men; slapped some on the back,
! told them that they were heroes. Again
j came the wizard of Berkeley, and lo!
!he fumbled. Hall, the- hero of a dozen
battles, actually dropped the ball two
yards from the gc^al line. The fumble
was not costly, however, as the Stan
ford men held the Berkeleyites for the
third time and the ball became red a
foot from the cardinal's goal.
Stanford's magnificent defense on
their goal line was only a small meas
ure of sensation compared with what
followed. "Chet" Murphy received the
ball to kick out of danger. The ball
sailed skyward, none of that long, driv
ing kind that usually comes from the
toe of the Stanford quarterback, but a I
slow sky ball. It was anybody's j *
spheroid, but Murphy wished it all for j c
himself. He caught it and away he | f
went on the bound, a Mauser bullet, *
toward the California goal. The field Â«
was clear; there stood the posts silhou
etted against the black mass of in- t
clined humanity. Who could catch this r
fleet man, reputed the fastest on the Â£
field? Hall and Craig started in pur- t
suit. The more Murphy turned trrward c
the middie of the field the closer be c
came toward the pursuers. He had a t
fair start and it was a touchdown, for c
a case of wine to a glass of beer. t
"Not so," said Hall and Craig. There t
was no quitting. Chase they must, 1 t
though the world laugh at them. j c
Murphy felt the hot breath of pant- I c
ing Percy Hall full upon his neck. He j 1
increased his speed. Twenty-five yards ] a
was covered. There remained a full j t
eighty-five more before all was safe. | s
Click, click, went his cleated shoes as
they rebounded from the earth. The
second twenty-five yards were covered
and he was yet safe, but his course
was being turned toward the side lines
and Craig and Hall still in hot pur
suit. The crowd was frantic and the
tension snappy. On and on went Mur
phy and now closer and closer came
Hall, (ilory and kingdoms were shout
ed to him as he went, but his hopes and
ms chances were suddenly chopped off.
Twenty-five yards from the goal line
CAPTAIN FISHER HAS NO EXCUSE.
I CAN only say they had a better team and by better play they won.
They had more team work. We had as good a team as could pos
sibly be put up, but we suffered from a lack of material. Our
coaching could not have been better, and we had the spirit of
the university behind us; in fact, better than ever before.
Chester Murphy played one of the best games I have ever seen. The
more Berkeley went against him the harder he played. There was
not a quitter on our team. The only reason for our defeat is that
they had a better eleven. I am glad to say that Berkeley put up a
good, clean game. I think that Cross, Clemens, Harrelson, Franken
heimer, Downing and Code deserve a great deal of credit for putting
a team in the field from the material we had. We have no excuses. We
were beaten fairly and squarely. We hope, however, to retrieve our
defeat next year. I have played on two winning teams, and know
what it is to be victorious.
FORREST S. FISHER, Captain Stanford Eleven.
Percy Hall dove into the air and "Chef
Murphy came to earth, exhausted, sore
of heart and bruised. The tackle, the
fierce run and the excitement of it all
left Murphy limp and sodden, a wound
ed man.
The twenty-fi - c yards left were twen
ty-five yards too much for Stanford to
make and the result was that California
secured the ball after three tries of
the cardinal. Then followed an inter
change of punts, in which Kaarsburg
did some rare fumbling. It was a
touchdown pretty soon for California
or not at all this half. In unison, like
the wheels of a machine, the blue and
gold team began the work that made
them the victors. Hall shot around
one end. Thane worked a double pass
and Kaarsburg went over the center.
Then Smith was brought into the play
and how he played. Head down and
teeth set into the Stanford line he went
and nothing seemed to stop him. With
the ball on the five-yard line, the Stan
ford team cro-chlng for the phalanx
rush, Hall tried for a touchdown. Three
yards he made. A quick line-up, a
quick pass, he shot through again, this
time for all he he'd dear on earth, a
touchdown which he knew meant vic
tory. Kaarsburg failed to kick a goal.
Soon after the half closed and the score
read: California, o; Stanford, 0.
The Stanford team came out in thÂ«
field a much bedraggled set for the sec
ond half. James at left guard was re
tired and Freeman put in his place;
Clinton at right hnlf made way for
Dole. The two tackles. Wilson and
Rusk, who were counted on for so
much, had been outclassed by Pringle
and Whipple of California: the Stan
ford ends were outplayed by their op
ponents: the backs were unable to
fortify the weak center, and Stanford's
team entered upon the second stage of
the game a defeated eleven. Murphy
kicked off to Kaarsburg. who ran the
ball in fifteen yards. Then California
began a punting game at which Kaars
burg proved the eriual of Murphy. Re
lentlessly the California backs, young
Smith in particular, punctured the
Stanford line for any amount of gains.
Smith, time after time, broke through
their rushers, following Prinele. who
was a war-horse in his smashing work.
When a gain was wanted through the
other side of the line Whipple wag
called on for the hole-making, and he
succeeded. Yard after yard the blue
! and gold advanced toward the Stanford
j posts, but there was a check put in the
course fifteen yards avay from the
scoring point.
Then came the evidence of Stanford's
weakness. Murphy, limping and battle
stained, punted, and the bail only wentREFEREE GOODWIN ON THE GAME.
THERE is no doubt In my mind that the better team won. I do
not think that Berkeley's team was quite as fast as the team
that represented Stanford last year. Berkeley's slowness near
ly proved fatal to them at various times during the game. I
think the team that opposed the cardinal representatives this
afternoon was far and away ahead of any team Berkeley has ever
put forth. The superb manner in which her ends played their game
bespoke a large amount of hard coaching. As to the line men I think
Berkeley's forwards ran up quicker and followed the ball better than
their opponents. Stanford repeatedly got off side and were penalized
time and again, but not as much as they might have been. There was
too much attempted coaching from Berkeley men on the side lines.
The ground on which the teams played was in excellent shape, but it
to me th* 1 enclosure was too small to accommodate the large
of spectators who attended. Everything passed off Bmooth
ily until rear the close of the second half, when the crowd poured on

twenty yards. The Pringle ram and the '
Smith locomotor were then brought |
.into action. .. i
Both together, one interfering, the t
other looked with him, perforated the
Stanford reds until the cardinal j
drooped and wilted. Whipple also ran
with the ball, and good gains were the
result. Smith with the entire team
back of him carried the ball to the two- ,
yard \lirie over a distance of ten yaros. '
Thei/Pringle, harnessed in a shoulder;
protection, strong as Hercules, was
given the ball and carried it over _f
the second touchdown. W Hson of Stan- ,
ford lay on his back, looking up to see
if it were carried over, curses flowing
quite prettily and the tears in his eyes.
Stanford was on the zero side of 10-0.
and a minute late the score became
11-0.
Stanford kicked-off again and the
same play was continued. The work
In t.he line was fierce. The cardinal ;
was defeated, but the red men could ;
not understand it. Ray Smith twisted
an ankle and retired. Kick after kick
â¢ and a fumble gave California the ball
on the enemy's 45-yard line. The Cali
fornia ends, Craig and Womble, were
everywhere, down on kicks, putting :
their team off side when it was to their ,
advantage, tackling and downing the j
Stanford backers in their tracks. Then |
began a series of plays which brought
touchdown three. Hall, Smith and .
Fringle by runs or line bucks wrought
the approach to a higher score. Kaars- :
burg took a high dive over the pack
and Whlpple shot through for another
â¢ touchdown. Kaarsburg kicked another
goal and the score was 17-0.
The succession of touchdowns in the .
second half was disheartening to the
cardinal, hut they played on. Hall !
skirted the ends again for- varying dis
tances. Smith churned the Stanford line
and Pringle ran like a plunging horse.
It was agony for one. but delight for
the other until Fringe shot over the
line for the fourth touchdown from j
which no goal was kicked. Score. 22-0.
The same tn < tics and the same result
was seen in the next try for a touch
down by California, but this time their
wild, fierce plunges did not net a score.
Time was called before they covered the
last twenty yards that separated them
from another score.
Cochran's t m was a revelation in >
football to the followers of Berkeley.

IN MIRTH AND MELODY
California Adherents Celebrate
The:r Signal VictoryâStan
ford's Gloom.
A wildly enthusiastic audience path- i
erort at Odd Fellows' Hall on Seventh
Btroot last night to assist the Berkeley
Students in celebrating the great foot
ball victory. There was not a vacant
seat in the house, and the vast con
course of people waved blue and gold
banners, yelled loudly at frequent in
tervals and applauded to the echo the
frequent stage hits at unfortunate
Stanford. It was a badly overworked
atmosphere, and the ear-splitting
pounds ejected into it and transmitted
to all parts of the hall caused much
molecular friction, rolling and rubbing
the particles of air together in a most
rasping fashion.
The programme for the evening, not
mentioning the yells of victory, which
occupied fully one-third of the time,
was as follows:
Overture, Berkeley Orchestra, U. C. Band;

praise for the work he did. I have only the highest praise for Mr.
Cochran. He certainly deserves great credit for developing the
team. The material was not as good as in former years, but from it
I developed the best team I could. I do not expect to ever return

where kindly words were spoken of the
players who saved the day for the Uni

was the hero of the occasion.
Stanford's boys arc hard losers.
After the same members of the team
went to the Pleasanton and sat around
â wirii "two-by-fourteen" faces, talking
of what might have b^en done ifâ and

no mirth, no merriment. Occasionally
an optimistic collegian would drop in
and essay a Jest, but the only response
would be a melancholy, sickening
smile that disappeared like an icicle
in a July sun, then tho stillnens of
death would again overtake the gath

Finally somebody suggested that
Stanford challenge Berkeley to a shuf
fle-board tournament. Just what would
have happened him had not mino host
made the announcement that dinner
was ready is not known. Tho an
nouncement was the most encouraging
thing of the day and the little band of

the dining-room, where the bunches of
cardinal ribbon stared from every dish
' â a death's head at the feast.
L.ater on in the evening the spirits of i
the vanquished revived considerably, j
and players and laymen visited the Co
i lumbia to witness the performance of
"Gay Coney Island." Once Inside,
â where cardinal reigned, an air of gay
ety was assumed, but tie observant
said it was only superficial. Great
bunches of cardinal ribbon were every
where seen, flying- flags with the white
"S" were flaunted above the hea<is of
the audience and " 'Rah, 'rah, Stan- ;
ford." made the welkin ring. The ac- \
tors, in keeping with the spirit of i
things, were also liberally decked in !
cardinal and were freely applauded ac
cordingly. During the first act the boys
made such a din that at its close they :
were requested to be less noisy, in order ;
that the audience might be able to hear
a little of what was going on on the |
stage for a change.
Crowds also collected In the adjoin- i
ing saloons and it was found neces- I
sary to call In the police to keep the I
roof on the house. Everybody realized, j
however, that the football game comes !
but once a year and Stanford's defeat j
is the exception at that, so the noise
was takfn for the most part uncom
plainingly and the boys who tried to
drown iheir sorrow with cheering cor
dials and wear a mask of gayety were
forgiven.

I BELIEVE the better team won. Berkeley's men displayed fiplen- -

victory. It was a pleasure for me to officiate, as both teams played -
clean football. Although defeated, Stanford should not feel down- -
cast, as the men who composed the defeated eleven played pluck- -<
ily. The cardinal Beemed to place too much reliance on their bril- -
llant quarterback. Murphy by far played the host individual game. -
His team depended too much on him, however, and did not combine In -
their plays as did Berkeley. As to the linemen of both elevens, I <t
think Berkeley was superior, although Stanford's center was equal to -

Final Answer.

Dons Thinks That Twenty Million
Dollars Is Not Enough for the

Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
LONDON, Nov. 25. â The
Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Mail says: The Cabinet
will take a final decision Friday,
but it is agreed in principle to
authorize Senor Montero Rios,
president of the Spanish com
mission, to sign a peace treaty,
although the commissioners may
be instructed to insist upon its
ratification by the Cortes. It is
believed this decision will pro
voke an Internal crisis.
PARIS, Nor. 24.â The Spanish Com
missioners at noon to-day had not
fixed upon the day to submit their
final answer to the American proposi
tion, but It is deemed most likely that
Saturday will be the day appointed.
The opinion gains ground that the
Spaniards will accept the proposals of
the United States. A significant indi
cation of this view of the situation
was a remark by Senor Aberzusa of
the Spanish Commission to-day that
they expected to remain here about a
fortnight longer.
The secretary of the Spanish Com
mission. Senor Ojeda, said to-day that
the instructions from Madrid were not
sufficiently matured to enable them to
appoint the next meeting.
The correspondent of the Associated
! Press asked Aberzusa If the commis
i sion would be able to leave Paris next
week with the treaty. He responded.
! with a sidelong glance, as though to
I observe whether his questioner noted
the significance of the reply. "I sup
pose we shall be here for another fort
night."
"Why," the Spanish Commissioner
was asked, "is the opinion expressed
so emphatically by a portion of the
Paris press that you will decline the
j $20,000,000, but will sign the treaty with
i a protest that you do so only under the
! pressure of superior power?"
"Well, it does seem that $20,000,000 is
not very satisfactory."
This was the semi-evasive manner in
which the Spanish diplomat answered
i the question.
His questioner continued, "Then it
has been affirmed that Spain will re
: fuse to sign the treaty, decline the
money offered and make a protest to
European powers and that her Com
missioners will go home. Is that the
â  most likely result?"
"Ah, but we should not anticipate;
1 we should know day by day what hap
, pens day by day."
"And so you anticipate more daily
' developments here?"
"Ah. yes, we will be here a fortnight.
; Perhaps some affairs may Ibe1 be attended
; to in that time."
The Petit Bleu reaffirms to-day as a
certainty that the Spanish Commis
! sioners will refuse the amount offered
of $20,000,000 for a treaty cession of the
I Philippines.
MADRID, Nov. 24.â An official dis
i patch from Manila says that reinforce
ments of American troops, numbering
4000 men. have been landed in the Phil
ippine Islands.
The Madrid newspapers comment bit
terly upon the peace conditions of the
United States and upon the landing of
American reinforcements in the Philip
pine Islands. The Imparcial expresses
th" belief that "the American exac
tions arÂ» becoming harder and harder,"
and adds that there "appears to be a
European plot in favor of might against
right."
WOULD PURCHASE
ADDITIONAL ISLANDS
Belief That the Administration
Wants tne Carolines, Ualan and
the Pelew Group.
NEW YORK. Nov. 24.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs : There is no reason to be
lieve that the administration would be
willing to purchase from Spain not only
the Philippines and Ualan Island, but
all of the Carolines and the Pelew
group.
Much regret is felt in official circles,
particularly among naval men, at the
failure of the President to insert in the
peace protocol a provision regarding
the Caroline and Pelew islands similar
to that relating to the Philippines. It
is no longer a secret that during the
war the Naval War Board and Com
mander H. B. Bradford, chief of the
bureau of equipment of the Navy De
partment, Btrenuously urged upon Sec
retary Long and the President the
seizure of the Carolines. In fact, I un
derstand that one of the monitors sent
to Manila was selected by the board for
this dut3', but the President failed to
approve the proposition. Behind the
proposition to buy Ualan lies the hope
in some quarters that Spain will make
a counter proposition for the cession of
the entire group and Pelew Islands for
an increased compensation. The belief
prevails here that the Germans will
bring pressure to bear upon Spain to
prevent her from selling the Carolines
to the United States. Such action
would undoubtedly be looked upon as
cause for a breach of friendship.

series of gales during the entire voyage.
The Farallon brings news of the mis
fortunes of the steamer Utopia, Cap
tain White, embracing both fire and
storm. On the north-bound trip of the
Utopia, during a severe gale off Cape
Fanshaw, thirty miles from Wrangel
Narrows, fire broke out in the forward
cabin, which rapidly spread, and for a j
time bid fair to consume the vessel and
consign all on board to a watery grave.
As a precautionary measure Captain
White gave orders to lower the boats
and rafts with instructions for no one i
to enter them until the word was given.
A passenger whose name is unknown
became greatly excited, and as soon as
the first boat struck the water jumped
into it, and at the same time a high
sea struck the boat, capsizing it, and
the unfortunate fellow was drowned,
despite the heroic efforts fnade to save
him.
Through the almost superhuman ef
forts of the captain and crew the fire
was extinguished after It had burned
the pilot house, wheel and forward part
of the cabin.
In this condition the Utopia pro
ceeded on her voyage. When off Cape
Arden, the northern extremity of Ad
miralty Island, during a heavy gale, on
the night of the 2t)th. she lost her pro
peller, and while drifting at the mercy
of the wind and wave and being car
ried toward the rocky shore, the Far
allon came along, and, hearing her sig
nals of distress, went to her assistance
and with much difficulty succeeded in
getting a line aboard at a time when
all had given up hope. At the place
where she was picked up there was no
anchorage. The Farallon towed her to
Juneau. Her cargo is considerably
damaged, and several passengers lost
their entire effects.
Skaguay has again been visited by
fire. On the night of the 17th the en
tiro offices and buildings of tho White
Pass and Yukon Railroad Company
were destroyed. Th<- loss of buildings
is light, compared with the contents,
consisting of maps, surveys and other
valuable papers, which requir.e consid
erable time and outlay t<> replace.
A large livery and food stable situ
ated in the center of Skaguay was
burned on the night- of the ISth. The
loss was quite heavy, as the stable was
wrli ailed with hay and grain. Three
horses were burned to death.
DULY OBSERVED BY
AMERICANS AT BERLIN
BERLIN, Nov. 24.â A Thanksgiving
dinner, attended by 200 Americans, was
given at the Kaiserhof this evening.
John B. Jackson, Secretary of the
American Embassy, presided at the
banquet and proposed toasts to Presi
dent McKinley and Emperor William,
both of which were received with
cheers.
I 'resident M. E. Gates of Amherst
College made an address upon the sig
nificance of national holidays, after
which Mr. Jackson introduced Major
Central Frank Whoaton. U. S. A., re
tired. In the course of his remarks Mr.
Jackson said v great German chief,
upon reading the report of the battle of
Santiago, expressed unqualified admira
tion of the spirit of the American sol
diers who, though knowing that the
enemy was armed with better weapons,
never for a moment doubted that they
would win the victory.
General Wheaton, in his address, said
he hoped Congress realized the fact that
the United States needed an army com
mensurate with the requirements of a
great nation. The dinner was followed
by a dance.
At Glen Park.
A large crowd visited Glen Park yester
day. The new vaudeville tent has been
completed, and an interesting entertain
ment was given under its cover. After
the performance the balloon ascension
and parachute jump by Professor Conlan
was successfully ar-compllshed. There
was a strong wind blowing at the time,
and it carried the professor close to the
Ban Mateo County line. The new rustic
restaurant was opened yesterday.

TACOMA. Nov. 24.â Puget Sound
University of Tacoma and the Oregon
University of Portland, both Methodist
institutions, were consolidated in Sep
tember by the action of a special edu
cational commission of both, of which
Bishop McCabe and Dr. Payne, secre
tary of the Methodist educational
board, were prominent members. The
consolidated university was located at
Portland, after a sharp contest be
tween Tacoma and Portland, the latter
city agreeing to furnish buildings and
a site free of debt, besides paying off
$40,000 indebtedness of the Puget Sound
University here.
After two months of intermittent ef- ,
fnrts in that direction Portland has I
failed to pay this indebtedness or keep !
her promises in other respects. This
course has greatly exasperated the
trustees of the Puget Sound University, I
who were morally responsible for its j
indebtedness. The climax was reached ]
to-day when the Puget Sound Uni
versity trustees voted to disobey j
Bishop McCabe and the special com- !
mission by withdrawing from the con- j
solidation plan and continuing the I
school here. Pledges of liberal sup
port locally and from wealthy Eastern |
Methodists have been received.
The university will be reopened in
January, and an appeal will be made
to the Puget Sound and general confer
ences from the action of Bishop Mc-
Cabe's commission.
Superior Judge Carroll, who Is one of
the university trustees, says the com
mission was plainry wrong from a legal
standpoint, and that the university
must be maintained in order to fulfill
the promises made to local contributors
toward its support. The university has
grown steadily since it was established
in IS9O, with Rev. F. B. Cherington.

management never required guests to
produce marriage certificates; the
house has long been the headquarters
of the moneyed sporting people, while
it has been exceedingly popular with
members of the gentler sex.
It has been asserted tha < ertain pa
trons were favored by being placed on
a private register, thus avoiding the
publicity i.f having their names appear
on the public record. Certain it is that
the management has Bhown a reluc
tance to produce its books since the
flre, and one employe informed a re
porter thai they were in the vault. This
does not agree with the statement
made by Night Porter Joseph V. Mc-
Carthy to The Call last night, for Mc-
Carthy said he gathered up the cash
ier's and all the other books, excepting
the public register, and removed them
himself to the Emporium, leaving them
in charge of the night watchman
there. He would have taken the regis
ter also, but Night Clerk Scott said it
was not necessary.
Puring the c a Call reporter was on
â the fourth floor assisting in arousing
the slumbering occupants of the rooms,
when he heard an employe of the hotel
shout out to another employe: "For
God's sake, get those drunks out; get
those drunks out!" It was very late
when the arÂ« broke out and habitues
of the tenderloin are prone to convivi
ality between dinner and the hour of re
tiring. The hails and corridors of the
Baldwin extended at many angles and
were confusing at best. Filled yith
blinding smoke and pitch dark, it
would require the hand of Providence
to guir*3 somes of the guests to safety,
particularly if they were in such a con
dition as the hotel employe's warning
shout would indicate.
Then again, from the statements of
attaches of the hotel themselves, it is
shown conclusively that the night
force, that is the force on duty be
tween midnight and 6 a. m., is entirely
Inadequate. The night porter, in addi
tion to keeping a general lookout with
the night watchman, was required to
act as bellboy for every room in the
house, and he, with the watchman and
one elevator boy, were the only em
ployes on duty on the upper floors.
It is after all these facts are taken
into consideration that the authorities
form the opinion that the death roll
will grow to appalling proportions.
Moreover, some of the dead will never
be identified, they say.
One story told yesterday that seemed
to have considerable foundation In fact,
may be recited in support of this asser
tion, names only being withheld. This
story is t<< the effect that the wayward
daughter of a family highly honored in
the city and State whose name has
tarnished by the breath
andal, is known to have occupied
â¢ ;i iii the Baldwin that fatal night.
She has not been seen since then, and
her friends believe she lies somewhere
in that blackened, watersoaked heap of
ruins. Rather than brave the disgrace
they have smothered their grief and
concealed their child's disappearance
from the world, fearfully awaiting de
velopments.
Should her body, when found, be
possible of identification, then conceal
ment will be no longer possible; but if
th>- llames have obliterated her fea
tures then there will be a burial of the
charred remains of some unidentified
dead in th? city's plat, the wretched
ts will give out that their daugh
ter has gone to Europe, where they
will soon follow her never to return,
and the erstwhile social favorite will
drop out of the minds of her San Fran
acqualntai
The frightful rapidity with which the
flames enveloped every part of the huge
building astonished even the expe
â¢ I firemen and that all but a half
dozen or so of the 800 or 900 people
;, lgâ¬>d beneath its roof should make
their way to safety would prove little
short of miraculous, handicapped as
they were by tortuous passageways,
total darkness and stifling smoke in
addition to the bewilderment attendant
at such a period.
To-day the work of tearing down the
tottering chimneys and walls and the
grewsome delving among the wreckage
for victims will begin in earnest.
DEATH CAME WHILE
HE WAS ASLEEP
Remains of Purser Leithead
found in a Bath
room.
The blackened body of James M.
Leithead was found yesterday forenoon in
the bathroom adjoining his apartment on
the fifth floor of the Baldwin Hotel. From
the position in which the body was found
it was apparent that death came upon
him unawares.
The popular young purser of the Pa
cific Mail steamer City of Sydney was one
of the many victims of "Wednesday morn-
ing's fire, but his death was robbed of
much of the horror of the occasion, as it
must have occurred before the flames
reached the Ellis-street side. The dis-
covery of the body jarred the nerves of
Manager Lake, who had gone to the top
of the building to his own apartments in
search of sdme valuables he had left
there. Cautiously picking his way over
the debris, Manager Lake nearly reached
his room, when curiosity prompted him
to push open the door of the bathroom
connected with Leithead's room. Sitting
in a chair in a position of repose was the
nude body of the unfortunate man.
Portions of the body had been scorched
by the flames, but this must have ta*Â»en
place long after life was extinct, for there
was no sign of suffering on the face. One
leg was crossed over the other, and the
head reclined on the left haÂ«d, the arm
renting upon a small table. The eyes
were cloned as if in sleep, indicating that
Leithead had retired to the bathroom
weary and sleepy, had sat down for a
minute or bo to rest and fallen asleep.
He was not aroused by the noises in iue
haliway and was aaphyxiated.
Leithead had attended a dinner party
In the Western Addition In the evening,
and the last seen of him was when he
left the hack and went to his room Boon
after 2 o'clock in the morning. For many
years it had been the habit of the purser
to take a cold bath Just before retiring.
The MorKue officials were Immediately
notified and Deputy Coroner Hallett per

formed the unpleasant duty of removing
the dead from the ruins.
Deputy Hallett made an inspection of
the dead man's room and found his
clothes, trunk, etc. Tbe pockets in Leit
head's clothing- contained nothing of
value. althoiiKh he was always well pro
vided with money when ashore. The
trunk contained. only clothing. Manager
Lake, who assisted in the search, found
a draft for $50 drawn in favor of the dead
man's mother, who is believed to be in
N< w York. The trunk was sent to the
Morgue. Miss Susie W. Nicoll <>f 62s
Haierht street, an intimate friends of Leit
heaa. who is employed in the office of the
steamship company, called at the Morgue
and identified the body.
The body was removed at once to an
undertaking parlor. It is very likely it
will be sent to his mother in New York.
Deceased was a native of Montreal and
wa3 about ",2 years of age. He had been
employed by the Pacific Mail Steamship
Com pun v for the X<nat five years and was
one of tho most efficient and popular offi
cials in its employ.
IDENTIFIED AS
A. J. PRYOR
Charred Head and Trunk
Recovered From the
Debris.
Yesterday afternoon the debris reluc
tantly gave up a portion of a burned and
mutilated victim of the BalSwin fire trap.
While workmen were engaged in removing
broken timbers to get a jeweler's safe,
which had fallen through the floor of 842
Market street, they uncovered a horrible
sight. The shriveled head and trunk of
a human being were lying there, the pain
distorted face telling of an awful agony
before death came. The body had been
severed from the lower extremities and
the whole top of the skull was gone. Be
tween the clenched teeth a crisped tongue
protruded, and the vacant eyesockets and
hollow nasal cavity left but little expres
sion by which an identification could be
made.
A. S. Levin saw the awful sight first
and called it to the attention of the work
men. Though strong men it was more
than they could bear and with blanched
faces they turned away and left their
work. The Coroner's office was notified
by telephone and Deputy O'Brien soon ar
rived. The approach of the Morgue
wagon sent a shudder through the great
crowd which filled the south side of Mar
ket street from the car track to the
buildings. Impelled by morbid curiosity
the mob rushed en masse toward the en
AN OVERTURNED LAMP WAS
THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE
A Drunken Orgie of Cooks and Waiters in tlie Kitchen Said to Hare Led to I
the Awful Loss of Liie and Property.
o o
O Xâ^ INCE the disastrous flre in the Baldwin Hotel on Wednesday morning the air has quivered with query o
Â° as to Its cause and the location of its origin. The latter point seems to have been settled, however, be- Â°
O /^N yond a reasonable doubt. It started in the kitchen. The Investigation made by the Fire Department, as- O
o VÂ«*/ stated by the owners of the hotel, tends to prove this, and the evidence of one particular person who is O
O connected with the theater, If correct, leaves no further room for inquiry. The party referred to is the o
O stage carpenter, and he claims to have been on the stage of the theater after the fire had been burning in the o
o hotel and after the alarm had been sounded, and that at that time the showhouse was not on fire.
A persistent rumor, with the color of truth, went the rounds in this city yesterday. It attributes the or
Â° igin of the great fire to the gross misconduct of waiters and cooks of the hotel. According to rule the kitchen Â°
Â° should be cleared and vacated by 12 o'clock, but a number of cooks and waiters who desired an evening to them- Â°
Â° selves entered the steward's apartments and secured a quantity of wines, which they proceeded to open and con- o
O Eume in the kitchen. _ m *^_. / . o
Their orgies occupied three hours and the wine made a number or them boisterous. Fighting began, and in
Â° the tussle a lamp and some oil was overturned. Realizing the danger, but frightened at the situation, they at- Â°
Â° tempted to extinguish the rapidly increasing flames themselves, but after several minutes the futility of their o
Â° efforts dawned upon them. In terror they took to their heels and failed to warn any one of the fearful damage Q
Â° they had created.
O The rumor is based upon statements made by some of the parties who bear the responsibility of the awful Â°
O catastrophe upon their heads. During the day and yesterday they, wishing to drown their sorrows in drink, in- O
o dulged, and in consequence loosened their tongues to such an extent that they confessed to the crime. Matters q
are expected to develop in a short time, as so many were present that their mouths cannot always remain
Â° sealed to the public.
Â° The conclusion arrived at by Chief Marshal Towe is that the blaze started in the kitchen, and he attrib- p
O utes It to a defective range. He has not secured any direct evidence, but has arrived at the most possible con- 6
O elusion in the absence of any. O
The Baldwin Hotel at the time of its construction was provided with no bridging between the studding, and _
the flames were free to creep directly from the basement to the roof between the walls without any bulkhead or
Â° interruption. There may have been no draught in the lower portion of the aperture, but this draught was prob- Â°
O ably found at the fifth story, where the flames burst forth. O
O Whatever develops in connection with the rtraor depends upon It being probed to the very core. People q
o who have expressed themselves agree that it is true and that a sensation may be expected. The Information
' comes from very responsible sources, but no names are permitted to be given at the present time.
The Fire Wardens will meet to-morrow at the City Hall. The meeting haÃ been called for the purpose of Â°
O attending to matters in connection with the Baldwin fire and to take steps toward ordering the removal of the o
O ruins. The hour named Is 11 o'clock. o

stumbling into the ruins, regardless of
the danger of injury and possibly death
from a falling wall.
In response to a request by Deputy
Coroner O'l-irien, District Engineer M
Klssi.k ordered several firemen to remove
the broken timber so that the body could |
be taken out. Care was taken In clearing ;
a space around the body. Tt was thought

which might aid In establishing the Iden

large iron pipe, which either burned or

in. The remainder of the body was n<
found though it may be underneath tl
mass of iron and brick near which it

At the Morgue a closer examinatioT
was made and the sex was establishet
by the size of the head, the chest an
arm. It was decided that it had one
been a man.
A number of men employed at the rac
track visited the Coroner's office las
night, and after the body had been viewec
by them some said it was that of Judg
J. J. Carter and others H. A. Pryor.
The most positive identification, how
ever is that of W. J. Mosley. the book
maker who says there is no doubt in h
mind that it is Pryor. He has been i

Pryor, who resides at 2301 A Walnut stre

Before Mosley visited the Morgue the on
gold filling noticed was a crown on

the Deputy Coroner that Pryor had cap
on the tee"th of the right upper and le
lower jaw and two fillings in the uppe
jaw. Examination of the remains prove
that the teeth corresponded with this d
scrlption Harry Corbett also identified
the body as that of Pryor.

Pryor that the body of her husband had
been recovered, and the remains will be

were of 'the opinion that the body was
that of Judge J. J. Carter. They based
their belief on the high cheek boms,
prominent nose and square neck.
Pryor occupied room 476 on the fifth I
floor and was awkened, but did not es
cape from the burning- hullding. He was
seen in the hallway by three nf his fellow
guests after the Hames had pot into the
corridors. He had lost his bearings and
was wildly running about seeking the
stairway. Men who Baw Pryor last say
he was in the Market street hall, near
the angle of the Powell street hall. He
asked how he could get out and the men
told him to follow them. They turned
around the next instant to see if Pryor
was coming and he was running east" in
the Market street hall. This incident al
most establishes the identification of the
dismembered trunk at the Morgue as that
of Pryor. It is presumed that he ran
into the thickening smoke, was overcome
and died of BUffocatlon before the flames
reai bed the spot when- hÂ»- fell. The loca
tion of the body when found substantiates
this theory.
JOHN McCARTHY
REPORTED MISSING
He May Have Perished in the
Baldwin Fire.
John McCarthy Is supposed to be among
the missing, and it is feared he met a ter
rible death during the great conflagra
tion that destroyed the Baldwin Hotel.
The missing man was registered at the
well-known caravansary and since the
fire his absence has been noted b,y his
friends and they are anxiously trying to
ascertain his whereabouts.
McCarthy arrived from New York a few
weeks ago and stopped at the Baldwin.
He came to this city as the representa
tive of a large wholesale liquor house of
New York City.
A Mr. Goroux, advance agent for the
Seven Sutherland Sisters, has been in
quiring everywhere for his friend, but
without success. It is thought his body
will be found amid the charred ruins of
the destroyed structure.
FRIENDS COME TO
BALDWIN'S AID
Although he has a great many plans
under consideration Baldwin has not yet
decided whether or not he will rebuild.
As was expected many of his old-time
! friends sought him out with offers of as
i sistance and submitted plans to him, but
I none have passed the consideration stage.
Several consultations were held during
the day with officials of the Hlbernia
Bank and agents of companies anxious to
purchase the site outright. It Is under
| stood that the officials of the hank offered
I either to buy the ground or assist in the
! erection of a new building. There is a
| diversity of opinion. Some favor the
i erection of a first-class hotel, while oth
i ers suggest a handsome opera house and
; a block of buildings, but it will be some
days before any definite conclusions can
i be arrived at.

The Swaying Walls a Menace to

Loosened Pillars and Tottering Chimneys
May Fall at Any Moment â Thou
sands View the Ruins.
Countless thousands took advantage
of the Thanksgiving holiday to visit the
ruins of the Baldwin Hotel. From
early morning till late at night hun
dreds of police officers were on duty on
Market, Powell and Ellis streets, keep
ing the curious and morbid from
rushing beneath the swaying walls.
Every few moments extra officers had
to break Into a crowd to keep the peo
ple moving. The police had the hard
est work on Powell street. A moving
stream of people passed and repassed
on the west sidewalk, and they were
kept on the walk only by great effort.
Occasionally a jam would occur, and
those on the outside were forced into
the street. Then the police would clear
them out. Similar scenes were enacted
on Ellis street.
Many former guests who lost prop
erty in the hotel secured permits from
the fire wardens and employed firemen
and civilians to search for thelf be
longings. Considerable property was
recovered, but the owners did not gain
much, as every article of wearing ap-

parel was ruined by smoke and water.
Some saved a few trinkets and memen
tos, which were all they cared for. Sev
eral men were engaged all the after
noon in digging out the baggage in the
dressing rooms of the theater, which
belonged to the members of the "Secret
Service" company.
The underwriters' big pumping en
gine was at work all day taking water
from the hotel basement. It was sta
tioned at the corner of Powell and Mar
ket streets, alongside the curb. An
immense suction pipe was run into the
main entrance to the grotto and the big
machine kept a flood running all day.
When the pumping commenced, night
before last, there was nearly six feet
of water in the cellar. Last night eight
een Inches remained on the tiled floor.
Some idea of the amount of water
thrown on the fire can be obtained from
the fact that the pump discharged 1500
to 2000 gallons a minute for twenty-four
hours. Over 2,500,000 gallons of water
has already been pumped out. This im
mense quantity of water weighs 20,000
tons.
A great danger, which imperils life,
exists on all sides of the wrecked build
ing. Chief of Police Lees thoroughly in
spected the ruins yesterday, and im
mediately issued imperative orders that
no persons be allowed in or about the
place unless they had business there,
and further that all men employed to
look for missing valuables should be
warned by the policemen on duty of
the chances they were taking in work
ing around the walls. Considerable ap
prehension Is felt for the safety of
passengers on the Powell-street cars,
and as a precaution passengers ought
to alight at the corner of Ellis street
and not ride to the turntable. Any
instant a mass of debris is liable to
fall from the top of the waving wall,
and a catastrophe would result if a car
happened to be passing. Near the
corner of Ellis, over the entrance to the
bar, an iron ladder twenty feet in
length hangs over the street. It is held
to the cornice by only a thin piece of
tin. On the fifth floor, directly over
the main entrance to the hotel, a loos
ened pillar fifteen feet long leans in
securely against the wall. A sharp
gust of wind wHI send it hurtling to the
ground. Its weight would crush a
streetcar and kill every inmate.
On Ellis street, opposite the Golden
West Hotel, an immense block of
cornice swings to and fro, ready to
drop. It is suspended by a sheet of
roofing, which will not long bear the
weight and strain upon it. The Market
street walls are bulged out at the sec
ond and third stories, causing the un
supported chimneys and crumbling?
walls to lean inward at the top. Until
these dangers are removed no work
should be done In the ruins, as the
laborers would be taking their lives in
their hands.
The complete destruction of "Lucky'
Baldwin's great property cannot be
realized without a survey inside the
skeleton walls. Here the thorough
work of the destroyer Is apparent. Piles
of broken, partially burned Joists, heat
twisted iron pipes and plaster rise
in chaotic mass to 20 and 30 feet. Broken
bits of marble, crockery' and glass fill
in the interstices in the mass, leaving
only projecting timbers in sight. Hang
ing in shreds to the slivered wood and
scattered about th^ ruin are books and
charred articles of clothing, which
were left in the rooms by the pan'c
stricken guests.
The inside of the Market and EWa
street walls and the firewall which sep
arated the hotel and the annex, arÂ»
burned smooth. The fire was extin
guished before the street rooms on
Powell street were completely burned.
All these rooms are open at one end,
the hall partition having been burned
away, and looking in that direction one
sees an immense stago setting. Noth
ing remains of the interior of the thea
ter except a few dressing rooms which
were underneath the stage. Every ves
tige of decoration which adorned the
walls of the playhouse was obliterated.
In the center of the ruin stands a
shattered brick wall rising like a mon
ument over the entombed victims of
the fire god's wrath.
MORE MISSING
REPORTED SAFE
Five of Those Thought to Be
Lost Heard From.
Five more names were yesterday
stricken from the list of missing. Mrs.
Andrews of Salt Lake, who with her two
children was reported missing, was not a
guest at the hotel. She had called therÂ«
in the afternoon upon F. C, Bowman and
wife of Salt Lake, but left early In the
evening. The Bowmans escaped, but lost
everything they had.
F. C. Andrews, cashier of the Baldwin
Grotto, was found at the San Francisco
Lodging House, and he also accounts for
W. W. Benchley, another Grotto em
ploye, who was also on the list. Mr.
Andrews occupied a room on the light
shaft on the fourth floor, to which he
retired at 2 o'clock on the morning of the
fire.
"I've been missing because I've been
asleep," said Andrews. "I was wakened
by the flames shooting up the light well
and I got up, packed my things and went
down stairs, gathering up a crowd of
women on the way. I didn't stop to see
the fire, but came over here and went to
sleep, and I've been asleep ever eince.
Concerning Benchley he saya: "Benohley was working on the day shift and did !
not stop at the hotel at all, and he had
aÃon to be there at that time. He
will probably turn up as soon as ho dis
that he is being sought for."
Miss Mary Hart, a domestic of the ho
â  been soon since the fire and
sister, Sadie Hart, also an employe.
Is dead among the ruins.
5 inquiry has been made for her,
but. her whereabouts has been dis
covered.
F. Weatherbee and wife of Haverhill,
Mass., who were reported missing, are
safe. They secured other apartments af
ter escaping from the tire, but could not
communicate with their friends at once.

Bumm srfield, a bookmaker at the Oak
land track, was also erased from the list.

RESCUED BY AN

Ralph Harris' Miraculous Es

Fifth Floor.
Ralph Harris would like to meet the
fireman who rescued him from the
doomed building just as be was about to

Mr. Harris is a wealthy wholesale milli
ner of New York, who is spending the

Oa.i'.'.-.-rnia street fur the purchase of
the Towell-strcet block occupied by the
Orei n brothers, proprietors of the Colum
b a cafe. The building was directly oppo
site the Powell-street entrance, to the
Baldwin, and as an Income producing
tment Mr. <;unst considered It well
worth the $122,500 asked for it. The trans
action had progressed ta the extent that
Mr. Gunst had agreed to take the proper
ty by 10 o'clock on Wednesday morning,
and on Tuesday night Attorney Ach was
on hand and ready to turn over to Mrs i
Clarke a check for her property But i
Gunst played In Jus customary luck and
told Ach not i" hurry, but to play the
limit and wait till morning.
"â A Wl i t thins* may happen in
a dozen hours, said Gunst, and develop
ments of the ensuing night demonstrated
.that a "hunch" often has \-alu<*. outsid<- a
game. The big hotel burnr-d. and
values on surrounding real estate suf
fered a slump it will lake several months
over from. Gunst took advantage
of the time limit, and Mrs. Clarke still
owns the property.
"1 had been negotiating for that prop
erty for a month," said Mr. Gunst, "and
consider it a splendid piece of real es
tate. Of course, as soon as the hotel
burned I let the deal go, for until a new
building goes up values will be reduced,
and I felt that 1 could put the amount ot
money that 1 had figured with to better
profit for the present. The property is a
good one right now. and 1 may yet decide
to take. it. I certainly should if any one
would guarantee to me that there would
be another hotel on the Powell-street cor
ner within the next two years. That see
lion will be the heart of the city for years
to come, and though the destruction of
the Baldwin will distribute the large
trade that centered in that district pretty
much all over town, particularly along
Kearny street, it will return there as
soon as a new hotel goes up. I know that
section, and have faith in it. People told
me I was crazy when I established the
Baldwin cigar store where I did, but it
soon got to be the most popular retail
place I was connected with. This deal is
not off exactly, but I am going to await
developments."
THE LUCKY ESCAPE
OF W. A. BALLARD
Saved a Woman Who Was
About to Jump From
the Fourth Story.
Among those who are thanking their
stars that they are alive is W. A. Bal
!ard, mining engineer representing Mines
and Mining of Scranton and Denver. He
came here to attend the Miners' conven
tion in the interest of his magazine. His
escape from the burning building was at
tended by an act of heroism that passed
unnoticed in the excitement of the occa
sion. Ballard moved from the Palace Ho
i tel to the Baldwin Tuesday forenoon
taking his vnlisc and leaving his trunks
at the Palace. Mr. Ballard retired early
and had been asleep several hours when
he was aroused by the cry of "fire" in the
hallway. His room was in the fourth sto
ry on the Powell street side. Stepping to
the door he saw there was no time to be
lost in getting out.
"I also saw there Was nn use in trying
to escape through the halls, which were
filled with smoke," said Mr. Ballard. "I
hastily dressed and threw my effects into
my grip and went out upon the ledge in
front of my window, knowing that In
time the firemen would come around and
I get a ladder up on that side. On my left
the smoke was rolling up between the
windows and It was so dorse that 1 could
see but little in that direction. Several
i times I look into my room and after a
1 while saw the fire was beginning to con
, sume the woodwork around the transom
and doors, and it was getting very hot
whore I was standing.
"On my right the air was comparative
ly clear." and I worked my way around
for a short distance, but could see no i
means of escape. There Beemed nothing i
for me to do but to stay where I was un
til help fame, and a.s there was less lire
in my room than in the others I had ;
passed I wont back again."
Mr. Ballard said it seemed to him that
he was destined to be burned alive, and
he was thinking of his folks in the East
very earnestly. Suddenly there was a
scream on his left, and. turning quickly, I
w a woman, scantily attirod, pre
paring to leap to the sidewalk. The
smoke that had boon rolling up from the
floor below lifted for an instant, and Mr.
Ballard shouted to her not to jump. He
moved along a little further to the left.
and to his great relief discovered the iron
Ore escape, which he had not seen before, j
The mining man worked his way around
to the same ledge on which the woman
was standing. Encouraging and com- I
manding by turn, Mr. Ballard got her to j
the fire escape*, and together they slow- !
ly made their way to the ground.
A bystander wrapped his coat round the
woman, and she was quickly hurried to
a place of safety, and that was the. last,
Mr. Ballard saw of her.
"I looked up to the window of my
room." said hp, "and seeing the flames
coming out in a mass I concluded that I
did not want my valise bad enough to
go hack for it. I would Ijkt.- to see the lady j
again, but. to toll you the truth, I cannot
gfvt. the least description of her, wheth
er she is old or young, fair or homely.
One thing I do remember is that she had
blonde hair, which kept blowing into my .
face and eyes when I was assisting her
down the lauder. it whs no pasy task,
for she was inclined to faint every few
seconds, and once or twice she let go
her hold on the tire escape, and I had to
speak very sharply to her to make her I
keep her senses.'
Mr. Ballard is congratulating himsolf
on having [eft his trunk, which contained
considerable valuable material, at the!
Palace Hotel.

FOUND MAYER'S
MISSING TRUNK
!t Had Been Left Unopened
in a Saloon.
Detective Cody yesterday afternoon
found the trunk which belonged to Louis
Mayer, who died of heart disease soon
after he had escaped from the burning
structure.
After his body had been taken to the
Morgue his friends noticed the valuable
diamonds which he had worn were miss

was missing, as well as a wallet contain
ing considerable money.
Detective Cody was detailed on the c.tsp
but It was not until yesterday that he
succeeded in locating the trunk. It was
found in a sadoon ai 101 Powell street
where It had been taken by two strangers
for whom the police arc searching. The
contents, which consisted of some cloth

They were found in a lodging-house over

TEACHER'S BICYLE SKIRTS.
The "tyrannical" acti -- of Cleveland's
Superintendent of Public Schools in fix
ing the lengths of the school teachers'
bicycle skirts came up the other day
before the Chicago Board of Education,
which is being heavily bombarded by
beyond-the-wall teachers, who want to
ride into town on their wheels. "Is it
I proper," asked these nineteenth cen-
I turv Dianas, "to wear a short skirt in
the schoolroom, and if so, how short?
Just where comes the line of demarca
tion?" The Minervas of the schools are
answering "No" to the first question,
but the board hesitates. In Cleveland
tl s protesting parents of pupils were
quieted fay the edict, "Teachers may
wear bicycle skirts, but they must not
wear them shorter than is proper." But
Chicago will have no dodging. Dr. An
drews says, "Bicycle skirts are to be
worn while riding a bicycle â not to a
school any more than to a dinner."
"But," protests Mrs. Caroline K. Sher
man "what difference can be made by
an inch on a woman's skirt? Why
should a working woman wear a gown
which sweeps the floor." On this the
women of the board were agreed, but
as to the precise length they were hard
ly united. Mrs. Sherman wanted it half
â  wav between the knee and ankle. This
I shocked Mrs. Young, who wanted
j them "not above the ankle." while Mrs.
O'Keeffe, who rides, fixed the line at
the knee.â Philadelphia Press.

session had begun and the various fac
tions were using every possible influ
ence they could command. It mattered
no-thing what the character of this in
fluence was, honest or dishonest. If
courts or commissions could be bribed
the conspirators were ready to resort
to bribery. Great Interests were at
stake in the decision and it was natural
that the wreckers should fight stub
bornly and bitterly for co-ntrol. When
Frank McDonald wrote the remarkable,
letter that will follow- he and the other
members of his family had been thrown
out of the bank.
Moses H. Sherman, the arch-con
spirator of them all. was determined
that he would wind up the final affairs,
not only of the Pacific Bank, but of the
People's Home Savings Bank. He was
not satisfied with having practically
ruined both institutions through his
wild schemes, but he was determined to
secure whatever valuable property he
had pledged for the funds of the banks.
He had in both institutions pledged
some valuable property in Phoenix and
he wanted this property hack. He
wanted to clean up his gigantic con
spiracy and manipulated to control the
final liquidation of the banks. His.
cousin, John E. Farnum, had been put
Into the institution and other friends
were in authority. Frank V. McDonlad
discussed this situation most bitterly.
He wrote a remarkable letter In which
he handled his enemies, and particu
larly Sherman, without mercy. The let
ter is also a most unusual one from a
literary point of view and is as follows:
"Justice or law, which is it? The Pa
cific Bank an interesting study. Its
old officers and attaches gone. The
only responsible parties dispossessed.
Mephisto Harumscarum Sherman, the
Arizona freebooter, and his minions in
charge. At the vice president's desk
sits A. F. Johns.
"The cashier's desk is represented by
Baggett, worthily typifying his name,
and like a lean and hungry Casslus
plotting and conspiring for an opening
for profit; but sadly different from his
Roman prototype in remaining faithful
to no cause, his only end being to see
where he can catch on. To-day repre
senting the lone, erratic, insignificant
shareholder Cogswell, the next day pro
teanlike appearing for Director Sher
man, whom the day before he attacked
as a scoundrel, and lastly pretending
to represent our vacilating Attorney
General, whose position he had previ
ously most violently assailed. Ah!
Baggetl, thy nameâ well, certainly not
Constancy, but of course he is learned
In the law, and some say still more
learned in bookkeeping accounts, but
all admit he is famous for bulldozing
the courts, and is beloved of Sherman,
the fair and the good.
"Whom have we next? Why, surely
J. E. Farnum, the immaculate, who
suspiciously floats about from pillar to
post, but whose motives, of course, and j
deeds are always above suspicion. It j
does seem strange how such a virtuous
man could be chosen as a midwife and
wetnurse of this crazy Sherman's plots
and plans, but then they are cousins,
and Sherman has been a good friend
to Farnum in financial stresses, and
Farnum in turn has not forgot to back
Sherman's schemes for raising money,
however objectionable they may have
been, and the operations of these
Siamese twins in financial matters have
been the principal cause of the mis
fortune to the Pacific Bank.
"But how did the honest John Far
num acquire such power? Why he is
the son-in-law of Bank Commisisoner
Knight, the venerable patriarch who is
now ruling the destinies of the Pacific,
and who, like a blind Oedipus in despair,
with nothing but Antigone Farnum and
Ismene Baggett, two frail and slender
beauties, to console and guard him, is j
now trying to grope his way out of the
follies of his own creation; and any
one can readily see that suggestions
from Sherman to Farnum and from
Farnum to those whom he wished to
coerce, backed up by intimations of
what good Papa Knight could do and
might do and would do, generally suc
ceeded in accomplishing the desired re
sult.
"And who Is the moon-faced, smooth
tongued willieboy that scatters his
promises broadcast like the golden
leaves of autumn and that smiles and
blinks and frowns and lords it over
all? Why, it is the general, chosen for
his spotless record and striking fitness j
by the Commissioners, to act as re- j
ceiver in defiance of the bank act and*
the rights of the stockholders and de
positors; but a $150,000 in receiver's
fees and years of expensive litigation
and all the other rich perquisites do
not grow on every bush and are not to
be lightly cast aside, not even by as
affluent a man as the virtuous Gen
eral Willey.^They are worthy of a con
test and should be captured at any
cost, the law or no law, while as for
justice, she is so far back as to be
nothing more than a tradition. And
are these all the worthy representatives
of the law that are striving so zeal
ously to feather their nest and keep the
officers of the bank from arranging
with their creditors for full payment,
and open the bank and going on with
the business? Oh, my, no; but these
] are a few of the worthy clique, and in
I due time the beautiful, consistent arts
iof the Commissioners and Attorney
j General and others will be duly en
! larged upon.
! "But in this noble band o; conspirators
j let us not lose sig-ht of M. H. --.erman,
the general, the grand and noble rep
resentative from the wilds of Arizona,
! the man who, through his dishonest
j ma.nipulatio.i of schemes, has prac
| tieally wrecked the Pacific, and who,
! although until the other day a director
of the Pacific Bank, now brings suit
against his fellow directors, indicting
| them for allowing him to wreck it and
j further insists tt at they are vile and
he and his beloved band are the only
true and good men who should be in
trusted with 11 V ~ duty of winding up
this institution. Unless the present
board redeems its character by assent
ing to the monstrously dishonorable
proposition of paying him $15,000 in
money and his attorney, Bagsrett, $5000
! and surrendering him guarantees and
j obligations that he through his counsel,
j Raggett, proposed, than which few
propositions of a more disgracefu. char
acter could be imagined.
"Yet this good Sherman of whom
we shall have much more to
say hereafter struts about in
'â  glory and joins the beauty of
| legal triumph. He pretends to own the
i power to do almost anything, to influ
â  ence courts, especially the higher, to
| swing the whole power of the Southern
! Pacific system through his kind father
i in-law, whom by the way he worries
to death; and he distributes passes ga
lore over that system and provides
| positions thereon and on the Los Ange
les Electric Road to every one he
wishes to use and spends prodigally
' other people's money for purposes of
his own and practically plays Prince
Bountiful, asserting that anybody and
1 anything can be bought; and this is the
| man to whom the court has so wisely
| turned over the Pacific Bank, and pray,
[ fur what? To be ruined unless he and
i his friends are further allowed to help
â  themselves to whatever they may find
j that pleases them and with his usual
diffidence about helping himself â of
course, there will be plenty left for the
others when he gets through. But
enough said for to-day."
One of the most vitally important let
ters that was ever written in connec
tion with the history of the Pacific
Hunk was penned by Frank V. McDon
ald shortly after the foregoing epistle
was written. In his second letter
Frank McDonald goes more minutely
into a discussion of Sherman's great
plot to control the affairs of the Pacific
Bank, even after it had failed. Sher
man had placed his cousin J. E. Far
num into this hank as receiver. Far
num had forced the McDonalds to take
from Sherman 166 bonds of the Valley
Street Railroad Company of Phoenix.
! The cost of this road at the very out
f side estimate was not more than $35,000,
but Sherman had foisted upon the Pa
cific Bank sixty-six bonds of the de
nomination of $1000 each. This transac
tion in itself, even {f the Pacific Bank
took absolute control of the railroad,
would represent to the bank a dead loss
! of $25,000, but Sherman was not satis
j fled even with this ill-gotten gain.
He made an additional $100,000 bond
Issue and John E. Farnum forced the
| Pacific Bank to accept the bonds. Sher
man had given with each bond his own
personal guarantee, and after the Pa
j cific Bank failed he determined to get
out of the possession of the bank this
guarantee and several other obliga
tions. To do this. John E. Farnum was
I placed in the institution. These trans
i actions In the later history of the
banks are of the utmost importance and
constitute one of the most startling ex
poses in the whole secret history of the
j defunct concerns. In the following letter
| Frank McDonald exploits thoroughly
| the efforts of Sherman and his con
federates to cheat the Pacific Bank out
of documents that would now be worth
| $166,000 if they were in existence:
"In addition to the legal phases of
| this question we call attention to the
fact that the practical working of the
same would be very difficult. The
Bank Commissioners have to super
vise banks all over the State, are only
a short time in any one place and could
not give much attention to the actual
management of liquidation, therefore
they must necessarily choose deputies,
and in the choice of those deputies
there is a large chance for grave mis
takes, furthermore there *is no direct
responsibility in this case.
"The Bank Commissioners are under
no special bond for the management of
this bank, their deputy under no bond
| whatever, and they have no direct per-
I sonal interest In the matter nor has
the deputy, and as a further proof of the
I likelihood of irregularity in this case
jwe cite the fact that the present
choices that have been made are all
unfortunate. First, the temporary re
ceiver, H. I. Willey, that they chose was
I a man whose record was anything but
I such as to qualify him for the position
j and whose business ability and experi
ence were not of a kind for the hand
j ling of this class of business.
"The present man, John E. Farnum,
| is absolutely disqualified, for the rea
'â  son that he is almost entirely under the
control of a certain M. H. Sherman, in
whose behalf he is willing at almost
any time to do anything, especially in
the way of securing money or of re
leasing Sherman from obligation. It
was this same Farnum that forced
upon the Pacific Bank one hundred and
sixty-six bonds of $1000 each against
the protests of the cashier and presi
dent of the bank, and it is the same
Farnum that is now working to re
lease M. H. Sherman from the guar
antee on these bonds and otherwise to
get out his obligations and papers
from this bank, and only recently said
M. H. Sherman has tried in a dishon
orable way to get the release of this
$166,000 and to get the officers of the
institution to stipulate that he should
be released from his guarantee and be
paid $15,000 in cash and be allowed
$5000 for his attorney, Baggett, and
have sundry other papers turned over
to him, in return for which he would
draw out from this fight and stop op
posing us and permit that the bank be
liquidated under the directors and Bank
Commissioners as it should be, he
(Sherman) being practically the person
who is making the most trouble and
opposition.
"And It is a matter well known to any
one who has given the subject any at
tention that Farnum and Sherman are
working together in all matters, and
that this same Sherman was until re
cently a director in the Pacific Bank
and has now turned around and is at
tacking his fellow-directors, hoping
that he may be thereby released from
his obligations and may otherwise
profit from the liquidation of the banks.
"It must, therefore, be very clear
that said Farnum Is entirely an im
proper person for the responsible posi
tion that he Is now filling. Again, the
Attorney Baggett first appeared in con
nection with the Pacific Bank as attor
ney for Dr. Cogswell, a shareholder of
ten shares, and on those occasions he
attacked the Attorney General and his
position, the bank directors and their
position, of which M. H. Sherman was
one. Soon after we find Baggett ap
pearing as attorney for Sherman and
then assisting the Attorney General and
now he is supposed to represent the
Bank Commissioners, and, in other
words, he is simply a turncoat shifting
around to see where there is most for
Baggett.
"We also find that they have chosen
in their employ a Mrs. Graham as
stenographer, who is the daughter of
a Mrs. Crocker, who is associated with
Edminster & Co. of New York City,
which firm is now bringing a fraudu
lent suit against the Pacific Bank and
trying to rob it of over $20,000 of its as
sets, and we know that between the
daughter ani mother the most intimate
relationships exist, and that the mother
and daughter have been working
against the directors and in favor of
said Farnum and Sherman, and we
therefore say that she is not a proper
person for this position.
"Now, again, we understand that H.
I. Willey. as receiver, by authority of
the Bank Commissioners, did make a
demand on the First National Bank of
this city for certain bills receivable
that were turned over to its president
for collection, to be paid on account of
the Indebtedness of the Pacific Bank
as per agreement with said Pacific
Bank to the said National Bank of
Commerce of New York. These notes
have always been held In the Pacific
Bank as the separate property of the
said National Bank of Commerce and
were ordered by said National Bank of
Commerce, were delivered to the presi
dent of the First National Bank of this
city, and we understand that said H. I.
Wiley has notified the makers of these
notes not to pay the same to the First
National Bank of this city. This is
a monstrous mistake of judgment, for
the National Bank of Commerce of
New York holds other large and valu
able securities on the same indebted
ness, and if it elected, could sell those
securities in open market and slaughter
the same, there being at present no
sale and no market for these securities,
and thereby the Bank of Commerce
could come back against the Pacific
Bank for a deficiency judgment which
would involve a loss to the Pacific Bank
of at least $100,000.
And the only reason the Bank of
Commerce has not made such sales
heretofore has been for the kindly feel
ing toward the Pacific Bank and the
hope that it might be able to arrange
with Its creditors and reopen its doors.
Therefore, this act of Receiver Willey
and the Bank Commissioners is enough
to disqualify them from thus adminis
tering upon the affairs of the Pacific
Bank, irrespective of others that might
be cited, and it should not be forgotten
that said Farnum and Willey, Mrs. Gra
ham and Bank Commissioner Knight,
who is the father-in-law of Farnum,
are practically under the control of M.
H. Sherman, and this Sherman is the
one who has wrecked the Pacific Bank.
Therefore, we submit that for the Pa
cific Bank to be wound up under these
persons would be a great injustice to
the creditors and the stockholders."

ANGLO-AMERICAN
LOVE FEAST HELD
Thanksgiving Banquet
in London.
UNDER TWO NATIONS' FLAGS
PRETTY SPEECHES MADE BY
THE ENGLISH GUESTS.
Sir Edwin Arnold and the Earl of
Harlsbury Tell How Uncle Sam.
and John Bull Could Defy
the World.
Special Dispatrh to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 24 âThe Thanksgiv
ing banquet of the American Society in
London which waa held at the Hotel
Cecil this evening, was fur a glorifica
tion of Anglo-American friendship.
Three hundred Americans and their
English guests sat at a table under the
entwined flags of the two nations. Two
notable speeches were made, one by
Mr. Henry White, American Charge
d'Affaires, and the other by Sir Edwin
Arnold, who was supposed to be nearly
at the point of death from paralysis,
' but who dragered himself to the banquet
j hall aaginst the orders of his physicians,
leaning on the arm of his Japanese
wife, and supported by a cane.
J. L. Taylor, president of the society,
proposed toasts to her Majesty, the
Queen, and to President McKinley, and
Mr. F. C. Van Dusen, the secretary,
read President McKinley's Thanksgiv
ing proclamation. W. M. Osborne, the
American consul General, in proposing
the health of the Charge d'Affaires, paid
a high tribute to Mr. White's long serv
ices.
Mr. White, responding to the toast,
"Thanksgiving day," evoked enthu
j siastic cheers by reference to Colonel
| Hay, formerly American Embassador
and now United States Secretary of
State, whose eloquence, he said, had
! been the chief attraction of the gath
j erings of the society. Speaking of the
j "first foreign war in fifty years which
' Americans had been compelled to wage
in the interests of humanity and civil
ization," the- Charge d'Aftairs ongrat
j ulated the nation that, as in a previous
contest, it had been guided by a Presi
dent possessed of the wisdom and cour
age to surmount the difficulties of the
crisis. The war had proved "that the
fire of patriotism burned as brightly in
the hearts of our citizens as it ever did,
! and that sectional differences have dis
appeared. We have emerged from the
conflict a united people among the na
tions of the earth, ready to assume the
responsibilities unexpectedly thrust
I upon us."
The speaker referred to the change
which had come over the feelinfes of
the two nations with respect to each
other, "as based upon n<> alliance at
present, nor, I hope, to come, but upon
unity of feeling." It would be diffi
cult, he said, to foretell the conse
quences should the two countries ever
decide upon joining action in any part
!of the world. It would be a combina
j tion difficult to defeat and tending to
I the advancement of the human race.
The Earl of Halsbury, the Lord Chan
cellor, extolled Anglo-American friend
ship, which, he .^aid was netc t "vain tin
sel, but what the race believed was a
duty to be done.' These two nations,
he declared, had destroyed the ideas
that it was right for one man to make
another his property. The American
people, at the risk of tearing asunder
the great empire they had founded, had
determined that every man under the
stars and stripes should be free. The
two nations together might defy the
world. Their alliance might be an Idea
and a dream, but it was a noble idea
and a splendid dream.
Sir Edwin Arnold concluded the
speech-making with an address, the
manner of which was so eloquent that
it could not be reproduced. No man,
he said, could visit America and not
express the gratitude, attachment and
hopes that filled his heart. He conclud
ed:
"Tour guests salute you. Only onÂ©
â who has known Holmes, Emerson,
Longfellow and Whitman can tell how
secretly and shyly Englishmen love
America."

NOT c VITAL ISSUE.
WHILE -it is true that Stanford lust the football
game, it is not true that the occasion is one for
mourning. The defeated might as well be
isophical. In former years Berkeley has been
the one to suffer defeat, and Berkeley has borne it like
i collective man. with never a whimper. It was a
good contest, well fought on both sides, and neither
set of player? emerged from it with any shadow of
discredit. There is no occasion for tears. The player
from Stanford, standing amid the dust and blood
of the arena, the brine rolling adown his begrimed
countenance, and falling to the ground with what Bill
Nye would have called a loud report, was unduly ex
cited. There was no vital issue at stake.
Stanford had no claim on an unbroken series of
victories. The personnel of the clubs shifts so from
year to year that no assurance is left that a team
bearing the same name as that of the season before
has a cinch on the bigger score. While there is a
natural pride in the success of an eleven representative
of one institution, the rooters of the vanquished in
stitution have the satisfaction of memory or the balm
of hope.
Both Stanford and Berkeley are big universities.
The team oi each has a proper pride, and yet they
can enter the yearly contest certain that while both
cannot win. both can put up a good struggle. If the
result were always in favor of a particular side inter
est would wane. People in general are rather glad
that Berkeley carried oft the honors this time. In the
face of defeat its players had not lost heart. It wai
their turn.
ThjE STANDING fIRMY PROBLEM.
THE great problem which in the near future is
going to confront the advocates of '"imperialism,"
and its necessary consequence of a large stand
ing army, will be the difficulty of securing for enlist
ment a sufficient number of able-bodied Americans to
make a respectable force. Last spring Congress
authorized an increase in the regular army to 61.000
men, but up to the present time the total number se
cured has not come within 10,000 of that limit.
Plenty of men have offered themselves as volun
teers, but few seem to desire to serve in the regular
army aside from a limited class who can find nothing
more profitable to do. The pay and allowance of a
regular soldier exceeds that of a volunteer by several
dollars a month, and yet General Greely is quoted as
saying that enlistments are rapidly falling off, and
that unless something is done to encourage soldiering
the regular army will never reach 61,000 men.
The suggestion that Congress will either have to
increase the pay of privates or lower the physical,
mental and moral standard demanded of the men has
been thrown out by no less an authority than Sena
tor Hoar, who thinks that if the policy of "imperial
ism" is finally adopted the regular army will have to
be increased to 150,000.
The fact seems to be that first-class Americans will
not enlist for any other purpose than to fight. They
want adventure, glory and distinction, and they do
not wish to be sent to foreign countries to do gar
rison duty. This is shown by the fact that applica
tions for discharge among the volunteers are numer
ous, one day recently having produced action by the
War Department on as many as ninety. The enlist
ments fell off from 6500 in July to 2800 in October,
and there are no signs that the regular forces can be
recruited any faster than they have been.
Nor \i it at all clear that raising the pay of privates
will tempt men to enter the service. The present
wnges of a volunteer are $13 a month, and about $15
for a regular. It is thought that an increase of $25
to $30 would draw into the service able-bodied men,
but this is doubtful when it is considered that being
Fent away from the country is objectionable to nearly
all men in the service, regular and volunteer alike.
But if the United States is to have colonies and a
large standing army the problem must be solved in
some way.
One mysterious feature of life at the Baldwin was

OUR FRIEND THE PUGILIST.
IN years long passed into history the pugilist was
at lea?t an honest man. He went into the arena to
win, knowing that if fortune turned against him
the dainty beauties looking on might point their
manicured thumbs down, and thereupon be joyed by
the spectacle of seeing the victor jab him in the neck
with a debilitating, triple-headed spear. So he
fought his best. There were no jobs put up in ad
vance. There was no prearranged division of box
receipts. The gladiator was regarded as an animal.
Times have changed. The gladiator has gone. In
his place is the modern pugilist, a fake "fighting ma
chine," a man who dons thefgloves with only the
simple object of swindling the spectators. The
prize-fighter is above all else a fraud. As a mere
swindler, his place is in jail. Following his profes- %
sion according to rule, knocking out opponents,
bruising and maiming the other brute in the ring
with him, there would be nothing about him to ad
mire, nothing to encourage. He would deserve con- I
dign punishment as a loafer and a thug. But the
prize-fighter as he is, is even more despicable than
as he is supposed to be. There is about him and his
calling no element of good. He should be suppressed.
That Corbett and Sharkey entered into a deliberate
scheme of bunko there can be. no reasonable ques
tion. This ought to be their undoing. Their kind
should never again be permitted to achieve notoriety,
j for notoriety means illicit gain. It might be thought
that these toughs would be e uided by "professional
pride," but they never are. Probably the pugilist
does not live who would refuse to be conquered if
by so doing he could reap a greater harvest of dollars
than through a victory. If there are honest men
among them, they are in bad company, bad business,
and the sooner they can be expelled from it the bet
ter. The only way to expel them is to make prize
fighting a felony, and, having framed the law, en
j force it.
San Francisco's reputation has been soiled by prize
fights in open defiance of the statute as now con
stituted. Officials have given consent to the holding
of brutalizing and bogus exhibitions, the bribe of a
ticket being sufficient. Again and again has the pub
lic been swindled, and the city disgraced by these
events, presided over by the police. The Corbetts
and the Sharkeys are a set of knaves. The only ones
to profit by their nefarious trade are themselves and
a rascally lot of promoters, gamblers, touts and on
hanging vagrants. Because of the strange power this
riff-raff has obtained "sporting" affairs in the United
States have become a reproach throughout the world.
AGAINST SHAM RACING.
THE purpose of racing is to produce a speedy and
useful animal. When the racetrack becomes
nothing but an appliance of gambling, its ad
junct the poolroom, its patrons dupes of a confidence
game, the time has arrived for racing to be checked.
It becomes a menace to the community, a standing
temptation, a harvest for the gambler.
San Francisco has a climate devoid of winter cold.
There is a possibility here of conducting out
door sports while the tracks of the East are buried
in snow and the frost has penetrated the earth to the
depth of many feet. The lamentable result has been
that racing is here carried on throughout the year.
It is no longer a pastime; it becomes a business, di
rected by unscrupulous men, and depending for
patronage not upon people who can afford it, but
upon dupes. Silly speculators take their wages and
bet them on horses in the wild hope of gaining. If
they have no money of their own they often take the
money of an employer. The end is disappointment
and disgrace, ruined reputations, blighted homes.
More than one domestic tragedy which has startled
San Francisco in recent years can be traced directly
to the track. "Betting on the ponies" has been re-
sponsible for defalcation, theft, suicide and murder.
The lure held out is so captivating and continuous
that the weak cannot resist it. Players do not stop
to think tint they are going against a game in which
the professional gambler who opposes them must
always win in the end. If it were not so the profes
sional gambler would not be there to subject his
money to apparent risk. The bettor has no chance.
He is handicapped by the methods of the professional.
Races are so managed that the fairness of them is a
plausible pretense. The unsophisticated amateur
might as well throw his money into the fire and ex
pect to realize on the ashes.
The Call does not wish to be understood as oppos
ing legitimate racing. It does wish to be understood
as opposing the mock racing which goes on here
month after month, its only purpose to fleece the
public and its only conclusion the undoing and degra
dation of those foolish enough to become its victims.
A COMING ISSUE.
SOME surprise is expressed by members of the
Senate Committee which is investigating the
affairs of the Harbor Commission that under
Democratic rule the payroll of the board should have
increased over $5000 a month. It is explained that
much of the increase has been caused by the opening
of the new ferry depot, which requires the employ
ment of a large number of superintendents, janitors
and machinists; but after the compensation of all
these additional employes is subtracted from the total
there is still an increase of $2000 a month in the ex
penses bf the commission.
There is no occasion to be surprised at this con
dition of affairs. Indeed, we are surprised at the sur
prise of the Senate Committee â at its extreme ver
dancy, as it were. It is a rule in California that when
ever an administrative board or bureau or an office
to which there is patronage attached falls into the
hands of the Democrats it is immediately loaded
down with "'reformers." This is the case with the
Board of Education, the Board of Supervisors, the
Street Department and other bureaus of this city,
and it is evidently what has happened to the Harbor
Commission since it fell into the hands of the De
mocracy.
At the late election the "reform" element of the
party in State and city laid a deliberate plan to cap
ture the entire government. They nominated their
own men for all the offices â State, county and Con
gressional â and prepared to introduce into all depart
ments their idea of reform, which is simply a thorough
distribution of the spoils and the creation of as much
more spoils as the law will allow or the people will
stand.
What would have happened to the taxpayers had
this "reform" movement been successful can scarcely
be imagined. Four years under a Democratic Harbor
Commission and two years under a Democratic Board
of Education and Board of Supervisors merely gives
us an inkling of the fate which confronted them. The
cost of maintaining the schools has run up $5 per
pupil in two years, and the payroll of the Harbor
Commission has increased $2000 a month in four.
The other day State Treasurer Green apologized for
suggesting in his biennial report to the Governor that
several officials who now handle the State's money
in the various counties be abolished. He said it was
almost treason in California to hint that an office
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1898.
should be dispensed with. So it may bring down
upon The Call the maledictions of the reform De
mocracy to suggest that a large proportion of its
membership should be cut off the payrolls of State
and city and made to go to work. Yet that is just
what we think. Moreover, we believe that one of the
great issues of the future in California is certain to be,
How shall Democrats be kept off the payroll? By
law or by physical force?
A MOVEMENT has been started by the New
York Chamber of Commerce to bring about
through the action of our Government an in
ternational agreement that private property on the
sea as well as that on land shall be granted immunity
from spoliation in time of war. The promoters be
lieve the present time is propitious to the movement,
inasmuch as all the principal nations of the globe
have now so much capital invested in commerce that
it is to the interest of all to secure it from the peril of
the wars which now seem imminent. ,
The principle is one for which our Government has
contended on every occasion when there was any
hope of obtaining its acceptance by the powers of
the world. The international conference called by the
Czar for the purpose of providing for disarmament
will afford an excellent opportunity for again bring
ing the issue before the nations, for in its conse
quences the proposed protection of private property
on the sea would be almost as important as disarma
ment itself.
There is hardly a great nation on the globe that
would not derive benefits from the adoption of the
rule. Certainly it would be of more advantage to
European nations than to us. As naval armaments
stand now, any nation of Continental Europe that
went to war with Great Britain would have its com
merce driven from the sea within ten days after war
was declared. On the other hand, Great Britain,
while virtually mistress of the seas, has so much at
stake in her commerce that it would well repay her
to have it safeguarded by international agreement as
well as by her navy.
The proposal is moreover in the line of the historic
development of civilization. There was a time when
private property on land as well as on the sea was
regarded as the rightful spoil of an invading army.
A great step was made in the growing good of the
world when that old rule was changed to the present
one now respected by the troops of all civilized na
tions. The proposed step will be in the same direc
tion and hardly less beneficial.
It will be a notable accomplishment for us if our
increased influence in the world resulting from our re
cent victories shall bring about this great ameliora
tion of the evils of war. The New York movement
is, therefore, well deserving the support of the coun
try at large. Over the world hangs the shadow of
war. Crisis after crisis â arises in which the sagacity
of statesmen and diplomatists is taxed to the utmost
to preserve peace. It is to the common interests of
all, therefore, that this additional step be taken to
protect the private property of individuals from
spoliation when nations go to brittle.
WHERE INJUSTICE IS DONE.
A RECENT incident of life in Providence,
Rhode Island, reveals in our law a defect whicu,
while hard to remedy, works such a palpable in
justice that it would be worth while to attempt to
find a remedy, difficult as the task may be.
The incident as told by the Providence Telegram is
this: A workingman who was earning $3 a day be
came angry at his wife, and in order to get revenge
on her he quit his job and committed an offense by
which he succeeded in getting himself arrested and
sentenced to prison for six months. By this process
he gets his shelter and board at the public expense
for the winter, while his wife, being deprived of her
support, will have either to starve, beg, or get her
self arrested.
It is possibly only in Rhode Island that men have
sufficient Yankee ingenuity to devise such a scheme
of revenge on their wives. In all parts of the United
States, however, the same injury falls upon many wive?
without any intention on the part of the husbands to
inflict it. Whenever a married man gets drunk, or
turns vagrant, or commits any offense which entails
imprisonment without hard labor, it is upon his wife
the punishment really falls. She is left without sup
port, and it is not easy for the wife of a convict to get
employment. Therefore, while the offending hus
band has no other hardship to undergo than that of
imprisonment, the wife has to bear the breaking up
of her home, destitution and a considerable amount
of physical and mental suffering.
It is because of these consequences resulting from
the imprisonment of the husband that so many wives
who have their husbands arrested for ill treatment go
before the courts and beg that the offender be re
leased. The average American woman is high spir
ited and would not submit to beatings or other forms
of ill treatment from a man if it were not that she is
dependent upon the wages of the man for bread.
The subject is one which has from time to time
occasioned a good deal of discussion among persons
ii.terested in prison management and the punishment
of minor criminals, but it has never been a matter of
much interest to the general public. Most people
have believed that imprisonment is after all a pretty
hard punishment, that no man would go to jail will
ingly, and therefore that the law, while somewhat un
just in its indirect effects, does not directly tend to
injustice.
The Rhode Island case, however, shows that a man
may deliberately take advantage of the law for the
purpose of injuring his wife. With this fact in view
ii is clear that some legislation should be devised to
reach such cases. The affair may prove in its results
tc be one of those incidents in which Providence per
mits the accomplishment of a glaring wrong in order
to compel the world to reform its laws.
The umbrella-maker who was sent to prison for three
years for boasting that he had been chosen by lot to
kill the Kaiser got off cheaply. Three years seems a
long sentence for a lie, but if the fellow spoke truth
imprisonment for life ought to have struck him as
mild.
We are proud of the navy, of course, but the chaps
who disabled the Buffalo and the others who deserted
the Maria Teresa seem to have got into the depart
ment by mistake.
Just while the city is a little nervous about fire the
Salvation Army might be wise to doff its flaming red
uniforms. Somebody with a hose may mistake it for
a conflagration.
While Spain is determined to "hold out to the last."
her attention is respectfully called to the fact that she
does not seem to know the last when she sees it.
What a noble triumph it would be for the Super
visors to furnish the Hall of Justice without a scandal.
Brazil has a new Cabinet, but this hardly puts her
into the class with Spain, France or Italy.
COMMERCE AND WAR.
THE SONG OF THE
FLAG SENTINEL
"L.es ames dcs trespasses sommeillent dans ses pits."
("The souls that have passed away sleep within its folds.")
Le Desastre, P. and V. Margueritte.)
I watch alone yet not alone,
The guarded and the guard;
I hear a plaintive undertone
The while I fend and ward!
A whisper steals along the woof
And siirs the silken warp,
Unheard by they who stand aloof â
As thrill of spirit harp:
"We are the souls of those who fought and passioned,
Of those who blazoned honor on the flag;
We are the souls whose pride and courage fashioned
A nation's legend out of silken rag;
The nation's love our banner safe will keep
The while within its folds we sleep,
We sleep."
I stand and dream when languid Peace
Wings flight across Earths plains.
When Commerce shears her golden fleece
Or counts her hoarded gains,
When lucre seems the nation's prize,
Dishonor's bought and sold;
'Tis then I hear a whisper rise
Athwart the chink of gold:
"We are souls who fainted in sore travail
While bringing Truth to birth, but what are these?
Men who the we/) of Honor would unravel,
Misuse its sacred threads to work their ease;
What hearts remain our fla& to guard and keep
The while within its folds we Bleep,
Wo sleep."
I stand at arms when word of war
Comes creeping on the air,
When nations catch its din afar
And list the trumpet's blare;
When pulses pale, proud hearts beat high.
Calm valor steels its nerve â
I hear a trembling, eager sigh
Float round the flag I served:
"We are th*Â» souls -who sought nor self nor glory,
Poured forth Earth's life to save the flag from stain,
We wrote our names upon the nation's story.
Signed in our blood, say, did we sign in vain?
Must we the vigil round our banner keep
Lest those who live be lulled to sleep?
â¢ To sleep."
I stand at guard on battle eve
When lesser passions flee,
When wives and mothers plain and grieve,
Or plead on bended knee.
When comrades clasp in last farewell
And turn to face grim death,â
I see the flag's fair texture swell,
I hear a struggling breath:
"We are the souls that erstwhile fouerht and vanquished,
Fling loose the flag, we pant within its folds!
Soul calls to soul, the faith that sometime languished
Spreads out strong wings and warriors enfolds.
Fling loose the flag! Our battle watch we kpep
O'er those who soon with us shall sleep,
Shall .Â«Wp."

APPROPRIATE ADDRESSES
SOLEMN HIGH MASS SAID AT ST.
MARY'S CATHEDRAL.
Dr. Voorsanger's Eloquent Discourse
Before the Congregation at
the Sherith Israel Syna
gogue.
"Tears have elapsed since greater rea
sons have existed for our rejoicing."
This truism, quoted from the President's
proclamation, was uppermost in the mind
of the entire nation yesterday from the
time the annual day of Thanksgiving first
dawned until it finally passed into a
memory.
Probably in no other State in the Union
was the day more fittingly celebrated than
in California. The enthusiasm was gen
erally manifested not only In pub
lic but also in private life and in the
home. In this city, however, the cele
bration of the annual holiday was ob
' served with a combined demonstration
! seldom, if ever, equaled in the past. From
early morning until long after the last
glimmer of the electric lights at midnight
Market street was crowded continually
with people from all sections of the city
who were in pursuit of some form of
recreation or pleasure.
One of the main characteristics of the
celebration yesterday was Its observance
in nearly every place of worship through
out the city. Protestants, Jews and Cath
olics alike offered up prayers. Addresses
' were delivered from a hundred pulpits
Iby the ablest of clerics. Special pray-
I ers of thanksgiving were inserted in the
I general form of worship and were offered
up with fervor and Blncerity by thou
sands of devot* fs.
In the Catholic churches, without ex
ception, masses were solemnized in the
morning. At St. Mary's Cathedral solemn
high mass was celebrated at 9 o'clock be
fore a large congregation. The Rev.
Father Byrne of the Secular Order of
Cuthollc Priests was the celebrant of
solemn high mass at St. Ignatius Church.
Tin- members of the Gentlemen's Sodal
ity associated with the same church com
memorated the day by offering special
maun for the repose of the souls of de
iiii:.<(l associates who have gone to their
eternal reward during the past year. In
addition to these prayers special devo
tluiiH were observed.
Solemn high mass and thanksgiving was
Hunt' at 8 o'clock yesterday morning at
St. Uomlnic'a Church by a specially aug
mented choir, under the direction of Rhys
Thomas. The singers were Mrs. P. \\\
McGlftde, Miss Clara Atkins, Miss Lena
Qore, soprano*; contraltos, Mrs. Harry
Clark and Mrs. Madden; tenors, Rhys
Thomai <i i â < l Robert Stantini; bassos, Rob
ert Lloyd and Charles Schwertfeger; ac
companist. James Hamilton Howe.
Immediately after the last gospel the
officiating priest delivered a short ad
dress appropriate to the occasion. In it
he Instanced th.> many reasons why Cath
olics should be thankful, both for the be
stowal of many blessings upon their
church and upon their country. He re
quested that in addition to the prayers
of thanksgiving a special prayer for
the repose of the souls of departed friends
and relatives be said during the remain-
Ing celebration of mass.
At the First Congregational Churcb, on
Post and Masnn streets, an interesting
service was given under the direction of
the pastor. Rev. G. C. Adams. After the
recital of the various prayers of thanks
giving an eloquent address was delivered
In honor of the occasion and In commem
oration of the clay.
At Calvary Presbyterian Church the
Rev. John Hemphlll conducted special ser
vices nnd spoke to the congregation <->n
the subject of how we should celebrate
one of the most memorable thanksgiving
days in the history of the nation. Tn the
address he emphasized the many reasons
why the people of the country should
combine religion in the general observ
ance of this day in thanking God with
the sacred offering of prayer and devo
tion in' addition to the State and public
celebration of a national holiday.
At the congregations Emanu-El nnd
Rherith Israel religious demonstration of
thanks was held and a special service
nÂ«lded to the general form of worshln.
The ceremony commenced at 11 o'clock,
and was participated in by an immense
congregation of Jews from all sections
of the city. It was conducted by the
Rev. Drp. Voorsanger and Nieto. assisted
by Cantors Stock and Davis. An eloouent
and inspiring oration was delivered by
Dr. Voorsanger.
In the evening a religious ceremony
was held in many of the churches, partic
ularly In the Catholic.

orated tables. Mayor Phelan was a
specially Invited guest, but being unable
to be present sent a letter of regret.
Joseph E. O'Donnell was toast-master, \
and after the good things placed before j
the guests had been disposed of, he in
troduced the honored guest of the even- j
ing in a neat speech in which he refered j
to the fact that twice Pioneer Council had !
had the good fortune of having selected !
from Its ranks the supreme president, the
other being John J. McDade, who was
also present. Mr. Kierce responded In an !
eloquent manner. A trio rendered vocal
selections, after which Grand President
Haskins responded to "Our Order," Past
Supreme President John J. McDade re- !
sponded to "Pioneer Council." \\ illhim j
Finne sang, Judge Frank J. Mu.-askv le- |

to. John T. Greany and others addressed
the assemblage, and it was a late hour
before the orchestra, which during the
evening played favorite airs, rendered :
"Home, Sweet Home." The affair was in
every way a great success, and was under j
the management of E. R. MyricK, John J.

The little ones of the Sacred Heart. St.

of the Sisters of/ the Holy Family at
the convent at the corner of Hayes and
Fillmore streets yesterday afternoon. The
little guests did away with about forty
big turkeys, an equal number of chickens,
200 mince pies, 25) squash pies, besides un

sauce, mashed potatoes and the other
good things, without which no Thanks

Great, long tables wore set in the base
ment of the convent and loaded almost to
the breaking point with the dainties pro
vided for the feast. Gayly colored paper
rings, the handiwork of the little ones,
were strung along the walls and garland
ed the supporting columns and chande

these bright decorationsâ their contribu

At half-past 2 tne little ones in charge
of the Sisters of the homes reached the

Singing kindergarten songs they marched
to the tables and then bowed their little
heads in Htleut reverence while Rev.

to Induce the guests to fall to and eat.
"Eat all you want to: all you can," was

were followed to the letter by a busy,
silent multitude. There was no gayety
at the tables; no glad voices chanting the
praise of the good things; only busy
hands, busy mouths and great shining
eyes that made the many belles who did
such excellent service as waitresses
keep a steady watcn so there should be no

The British ship Fannie Kerr took eighty-nine days to come here from Newcastle, N. S. W., while the
British bark Inverlochy made the same run in sixty-eight days. Th^ latter left Ausvralia nearly three weeks
after the Fannie Kerr and beat her twenty -four hours into port. The winds were so light all the Kerr could
do was from twenty to thirty knots a day, while the Inverlochy with the same breeze made from eighty to one
hundred and passed her rival as though she were anchored.

FRENCH CONSUL GENERAL
He Is a Nephew of Genejal de Trobrland and a Man of
Wide Diplomatic Experience.
A. de Trobriand, the newly appointed French Consul General at
this port, is a man of much culture and wide diplomatic experience.
A native of Brittany, he held his first official position in 1872, when
he was appointed an attache to the French Consul General in New
l'ork, an office he held f r four years. His next appointment was as
Vice Consul at Charleston, S. C, where he remained one year, serving
afterward in the same capacity in Calcutta from 1876 to 1879. His
other ofT-ial experiences, prior to hi., present appointment, include
several years In the Department of Foreign Affairs in Paris, and con
siderable periods of service as Consul in Swansea and Cardiff. South
Wales, and at Gibraltar, at which latter point he recalls with pleas
ure his meeting with Admiral Walker and Captain Chadwick of the
American navy.
As an evidence of the high esteem in which he was held at Car
diff he was presented upon his departure from that town after eight
years' service with a highly prized testimonial from the municipal
authorities and inhabitants.
"I asked to come back here," he said yesterday, "because of a
liking for American people and American institutions, and because
several of my relatives are living in New York. One of these is
Mrs. Charles Post, daughter of General de Trobriand, my uncle, who
died in New Orleans a year ago. In 1873 he commanded the United
States troops in Utah Territory and subsequently in Wyoming. I
hope the relations between France and the United States will con
tinue, as in the past, of the most friendly nature "
Mr. de Trobriand is accompanied by his wife and four childrenâ
the latter, three girls and a boy, ranging from 6 to 17 years of age.

MRS. ESQUEDA DIES
FROM BRUTALITY
HER HUSBAND MIGUEL IS NOW
CHARGED WITH MURDER.
In Septemoer Last He Subjected Her
to Such Fiendish Treatment
That Peritonitis Set In.
Mrs. Soledad Esqueda, after over two
months of terrible suffering, died at
Mount Zion Hospital yesterday morning
and her body was removed to the Morgue.
Her husband, Miguel Esqueda, was
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
murder.
It was in the beginning of last Septem
ber that Esqueda, after starving his wife
in their rooms, 1317 Powell street, for
four days, subjected her to fiendish abuse.
The sole reason was because he had spent
all his wife's savings and she was unable
to meet his demands for more money.
They had been married two years. She
was 32 years of age and he was her junior
by several years.
She was taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal and later to the City and County Hos
pital. Then she was removed to her
brother-in-law's house on Vallejo street,
near Montgomery, but on October 29 she
was sent to Mount Zion Hospital, where
she died from peritonitis, the result of
her husband's treatment. When at the
City and County Hospital Bhe made an
ante-mortem .statement In the presence
of her husband.
Hsqneda fled after the commission of the
crime, but was arrested by Policeman
McMahoo on September 2-. He waa
charged with assault to mur.lt-r and baa
been in prison sine, the case having been
continued from time to time owing to the
precarious condition of his wife.
When told yesterday that she was dead
he said he was sorry. He declined to
make a statement, as he said he had al
ready talked enough.
Fractured His Skull.
T. Natterville. 1715 Scott street, was
seized with an epileptic fit on Polk street
yesterday morning, and in falling frac
tured his skull. He was taken to the Re
ceiving- Hospital.

Recollections of the
Civil War.
By CHARLES A. DANA. With por-
trait. Large 12mo. Cloth, gilt top,
uncut, $2.00.
The late Charles A. Dana's "Recollec-
! tions of the Civil War" forma one of the
most remarkable volumes of historical,
political and personal reminiscences which
have been given to the public. Mr. Dana,
was not only practically a member of the
Cabinet and In the confidence of the lead-
I ers of Washington, but hÂ« was also the
chosen representative of the War Depart-
ment with General Grant and other mili-
tary commanders, and he was present at I
' many of the councils which preceded move- |
{ ments of the greatest importance. Mr.
I Dana was selected to sit in judgment upon j
charges of treason, bribery and fraud, and ;
; he was familiar with all the inner work- ]
| ings of the vast machinery which was |
set In operation by the war. The im-
portance of this unwritten history is ob-
vious. Furthermore, Mr. Dana's own
narrative is reinforced by many letters
I from Grant, Stanton and Sherman.

8 painful adventures of the Skipper,

and Cynthia. By MRS. SCHUY-
LER CROWNINSHIELD. Illus-
trated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.
Mrs. Crowninshield's first novel is a
book which will be read and talked about.
The local color is fresh and captivating,
and the interest of novelty attaches to
the historical background, including as it
does the pirates and voodoo worshipers
of the early part of the century in Hayti,
and the strange figure of King Christophe. j
The unflagging interest of the adventures
which are encountered is accompanied by
a constant vein of delightful humor.
Foot-Notes to
Evolution.
A Series of Popular Addresses on the
Evolution of Life. By DAVID
STARR JORDAN. Ph.D., President
of Leland Stanford Junior Uni-
versity. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.
This book is a popular review of the
evolution philosophy of to-day, consid-
ered more especially in Its biological as-
pects. The essential unity of all organ-
isms, both plant and animal, the fact that
! progress in life consists solely of adapta-
tion to environment, and the relation of
heredity and degeneration to the evolu-
tional scheme, are among the points of
special interest dealt with in the volume.

shipman Farragut," "Commodore

$1.00.
In this graphic and spirited story Mr.
Barnes tells of Perry's adventures as a
boy on the frigate General Greene, and
conducts his hero through the exciting
scenes which attended the battle of Lake
Erie. It is a story which illustrates the
resourcefulness, energy and dauntless
courage which have characterized our
naval heroes from Paul Jones to Dewey
and Hobson.

teenth Century. By WILLIAM O.

Smoke," "Crowded Out o' Crow-
field," "On the Old Frontier; or,
The Last Raid of the Iroquois,"

tle, but it is also an Informing presenta-
tion of life in England and some phases
of life in France in the fourteenth cen-
tury. The hero is associated with the
Black Prince at Crecy and elsewhere.

IN THE MIDST
OF AN EXCITING
CITY CAMPAIGN
Los Angeles to Elect
New Officers.
CHARTER ALSO AN ISSUE
STRONG TICKET NAMED BY
THE REPUBLICANS.
Frederick Eaton Nominated for
Mayor by Acclamation Pculiar
ly Qualified for the Re
sponsible Position.
Special Dlapatch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 24,-Thls city is
now in the midst of a most exciting mu
nicipal campaign, which will come to a
final issue on the sth of December. An
entire set of municipal officers is to be
chosen, including a Mayor, a City Attor
ney a City Clerk. Auditor. Treasurer,
Engineer. Tax Collect*. Assessor Su
perintendent of Streets, nine Councilman
and nine members of the Board of Edu
cation. , .. â
In addition to this the voters of the city
will be afforded an opportunity to adopt
or reject a new charter which has been
formulated by a board of fifteen free
holders. In the event the new charter
should prevail the officers chosen at the
forthcoming election will serve for onl>
one year. But should the charter be re
jected they will serve for the full period
of two years. *'v-i_
The greatest Interest is manifested in
the contest for the position of Mayor
The Republics - have nominated a \er>
BtFong city ticket. The opposition to the
Republican party is combined under the
Term -Union Party." and includes the
extraordinary political mixture of D mo
rratÂ« Silver Republicans and Populists.
For' the first time in a long period of (
years the Republican candidate for May
or was named by the city convention bj ,
? name Is Frederick Ea
ton He was bom and raised in this
his career has been a most successful one.
He his been connected with the public
works of this city for something like fif
,uiU will prove <.f great advantage to
local sewer system, and also gave ad
vice and directed the initial steps that
were taken, some eight or nine years
ago in the matter of municipal ownership
of the water distributing plant.
Mr Eaton's record as a citizen and an
official has not been assailed in any way
and it cannot be. He stands squared
on the platform adopted by the Republi
can City Convention in relation to the
water question, which is and will be un
til it is settled the most momentous pub
lic issue before the people here. The
declaration of the Republican platform
in regard to municipal ownership is
plain and unequivocal. It is absolutely
devoid of any verbiage or unnecessary
clauses, and declares that me city
and the city only should own, control and
operate its water distributing plant.
Mr. Eaton's experience as City M
eineer will prove to be valuable for the
?eason that during the next two or
three years the city will be involved in
litigation with the water company In the
â settlement of the disputed propositions in
volved in the transfer of the company s
rights and property to the city. me
Mayor will, of course, to a large extent,
direct the legal struggle which the mu
nicipality will be compelled to maintain
in order to protect and assert its rights.
His intimate acquaintance with the plant
of the water company in its most minute
details, as an expert engineer, specially
qualify Mr. Eaton at this time to nil the
position he is seeking.
Two years ago Los Angeles city gave
Mr. Bryan a plurality of something like
450, but* this year Mr. Gage and his asso
ciates on the Republican State ticket
obtained a plurality of about 1500, -which
is the normal Republican plurality the
city gives under ordinary circumstances.
In this municipal contest now on there Is
absolutely no division in the Republican ;
forces; they are united as they never were !
before, and the best of judges are of the
opinion that the ]500 plurality of Novem
ber will be increased to 2500 on the oth
of December.
The candidates on the Republican city
ticket with Mr. Eaton are all men of ex
ceptional strength, and there does not
Eeem to exist any doubt of their election.
The nominee for City Clerk is Lafay
ette Martindale. a veteran of the Civil
"War, who left a leg upon the field of
battle. Captain Martindale has resided
in Los Angeles for quite a period of
years, and Is in every way qualified to
iill the position of Clerk.
Walter F. Haas is the nominee for
City Attorney. Mr. Haas is a young man,
who was educated in this city. He has
been for many years a practitioner at the
bar. and has succeeded In establishing
himself as an attorney of no mean abil-
Itv. During that time he has handled |
162 cases in the Superior Court (and has j
lost only nineteen of them), In addition to j
considerable Federal practice and pro- I
bate matters, which he has attended to. I
The only point that is being made against
Mr. Haas is that he is a young man. This
his friends admit, but they refer to the
gentleman's record as an attorney, and
it certainly goes to establish the fact that
he is fully qualified to fill the important
position as the city's legal adviser.
The present Superintendent of Streets,
John H. Drain, has been renominated.
This position Mr. Drain has filled for two
years and he is the first man to occupy
it who has not had his administration
stained by a defalcation. The position ;
is a difficult one to fill and Its duties re- |
quire a man of extraordinary mental I
equipment. It can truthfully be said
that Mr. Drain has given better satisfac
tion than any of his predecessors in of
fice.
The nominee for Tax Collector is Wil
liam A. White. Mr. White has filled sev
eral official positions in this county most
â¢creditably. He has served as financial
secretary of the Los Angeles County
Council of Labor, and his nomination was
to a certain extent a recognition of or
ganized labor.
Tne nominee for City Treasurer is W.
A. II art well. He has filled the position
two terms and was given a renominatioiv
In recognition, not only of his own effi
cient service, but as a veteran of the
Grand Army of the Republic.
â¢The nominee for City Assessor is Ben
]â¢". Ward. For seventeen years this gen
tleman has been engaged in securing
Eastern capital for investment in South
ern California. He is well posted upon \
values and for this reason would make
a most competent Assessor.
The nominee for City Engineer is Frank
H. Olmste.ad. This gentleman has a rec
ord as a consulting engineer second to
no one In Southern California. He has j
been engaged in several important engi
neering works in this part of the State I
and as City Engineer there is no doubt
that he would give satisfaction.
For City Auditor E. A. Carson, a native
of Los Angeles County, is the nominee.
Mr. Carson is a young man and has
served for four years past as assistant
clerk of the Board of Supervisors.
The Republican nominees for the City I
Council this year are exceptionally !
strong, and there exists not the slightest
doubt as to the election of six of the nine
nominees of the party.
W. H. Pierce in the First Ward, Fred
L. Baker in the Second. Louis F. Vetter
in the Third, Herman Silver In the
Fourth. Charles H. Toll in the Fifth and
E. L. Blanchard in the Ninth are be
lieved to be certain of election. Messrs.
Baker, Silver. Toll and Blanchard are
members of the present City Council. In
the Sixth Ward George E. Edwards, as
the Republican nominee, is making a no
ble struggle, but the ward has In the
past been inclined to elect Democrats to
the City Council. The Seventh and Eighth
Wards 'are the two Democratic districts
FREDERICK EATON,
Republican Candidate for Mayor of Los Angeles.
of the city and will undoubtedly return
Democratic Councilmen.
As far as the School Board is concerned
there is practically no partisan contest.
In the Fourth Ward Charles C. Davis, the
Republican nominee, has been indorsed by
the Democrats and Silver Republicans.
He I? the present head of the Hoard of
Education. In the Seventh Ward the
Democrats and Silver Republicans have
named a negro, Rev. S. W. Hawkins, for
the School Board. Th>> gentleman never
declined the honor, but after his nomina
tion took the stump for Gage. The Dem
ocrats will not vote for him and he re
to permit his name to be taken
from the ticket, so the chances are that
the Republican nominee. H. I. Jones, will
b e elected from that Democratic ward.
Thus far the campaign has been con
ducted upon the most pleasant lines. No
personalities have been Indulged in and
the Issues of the struggle will be decided
upon their merits, unless there should
me material change- of policy on the
part of the candidates during the days
interevning between now and the elec
tion.
MYSTERY SURROUNDS
A VETERAN'S DEATH
Before Expiring at Salinas Harry
Holmes Told Conflicting Stories
About His Injuries.
SALINAS, Nov. 84.â Whether Harry
Holmes was killed or died from accidental
causes may never be known. Last Sun
day the deceased was 7S years old, a vet
eran of the civil war and a pensioner. He
was discovered by officers wandering the
streets bareheaded and acting strangely.
He was arrested and was about to be
locked in a cell for insanity when it was
noticed his eyes were blackened and his
face bruised.
He was taken to a doctor, who at once
or '.ered him conveyed to the County
Hospital. He was thoroughly examined
and It was found that he had a large
contusion on the head, his face was con
siderably bruised, his eyes blackened and
he had serious Injuries about the lower
part of the abdomen. Holmes claimed
that early last Saturday morning he was
pushed down a cellar by hoodlums, pear
Fourth and Towns^nd streets, San Fran
cisco. Again when delirious he said hr>
fell down a hole there. He continually
stated he had been put aboard the cars
in San Francisco and sent to Salinas by
parties who found him where he fell, and
further that his money had been taken.
He became worse, and finally died this
morning from gangrene of the abdomen.
The deceased was a well-known character
In Monterey County, having resided here
twenty years. He Berved during the war
in Company I, First United States Cav
alry, where from his height, being over
six" feet, and splendid build, he was
known as "Handsome Harry." An In
vestigation will probably be made by the
Coroner. The deceased will be buried to
morrow by Stedman Post, G. A. R.
REMARKABLE SUCCESS
OF A TORPEDO BOAT
The Davis Exceeds the Official Re-
quirements by a Full Knot
During Her Trial.
PORTLAND, Nov. 24.â The torpedo boat
Davis, constructed at the Wolff & Se
wlcker Iron Works of this city, was given
her official trial trip on the Columbia
River to-day. Not only did the Davis
make her official trial of two hours suc
cessfully, but shÂ« made an average speed
of twenty-three and a half knots per
hour, a full knot in excess of require
ments. Lieutenant Commander F. J.
Drake, president of the naval board, this
evening sent the following dispatch to
Secretary of the Navy Long:
"PORTLAND, Nov. 24.â John D. Long,
Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.
C. : Davis Is the first torpedo boat on the
Pacific Coast to make one knot more tnan
contract speed. Revolutions averaged 352.
No undue friction of engines or excessive
vibrations of hull. Two hours, consecu
tive ruin; no turn. DRAKE."
Lieutenant-commander Drake expressed
himself as highly satisfied.
"It Is unusual." he said, "for a boat of
this kind to make a success before four
teen or fifteen trips. This is the Davis'
second official trial and her performance
is remarkable. Only good workmanship
and capable management could make
such a thing possible."
INSISTS ON ARGUING
A CASE IN RHYME
Peculiar Controversy in an Indiana
Court That Is Without a
Precedent.
ANDERSON, Ind., Nov. 24.â The attor
ney for the defendant in a case in the
Circuit Court served notice that he would
present his argument in poetry. The at
torneys for the plaintiff protested and
the court arose in dignity and said that
he would not admit poetical arguments.
The matter led to an argument about
the right to employ poetry in law, and
it was found there were no precedents
or statutes against such a method and
the poetical attorney was obdurate. The
court refused to let the case proceed on
this basis and it was postponed until
January 2. The attorney for the defense
insists that he will present and argue his
case in rhyme nnd there seems to be no
way to head him off.
FOLLOWED BLANCO'S LEAD.
The Colonial Government of Havana
Tendered Its Resignation.
HAVANA, Nov. 24.â General Blanco's
resignation being officially announced, the
Colonial Government likewise resigned at
its session this afternoon. General Blanco
accepted their resignations, at the same
time requesting them to remain until the
next Captain General shall appoint a new
Government.
Blanco Praised by the Queen.
MADRID, Nov. 24.â 1n the decree &
ceptlng the resignation of Marshal Blanco
as captain general of Cuba, the Queen
Regent eulogizes the zeal, intelligence
ana loyalty with which the Governor
General has fulfilled his functions.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1898.
BEET SUGAR
INDUSTRY MAY
BE ENDANGERED
Senator Caffery Airs
His Views.
GIVES REASONS FOR THEM
DECLARES THE "OPEN DOOR"
POLICY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
The New Question Is Being Widely
Discussed by Statesmen at
the National Capi
tal.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 24. âThe Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the fol
lowing: Serious constitutional questions
are raised by the proposition of the |
American Peace Commissioners at Paris!
to incorporate In the treaty of peace with
Spain a provision that the "open door" |
policy shall be put in force in the Philip- i
pine Islands.
This policy means that all nations are
to be given equal privileges with the Uni
ted States as to tariff charges, port
charges and all regulations respecting
commerce and shipping.
This involves the imposition of a tariff
on goods shipped from the United States
as well as from other countries, and it al
most necessarily involves the imposition
of a tariff in the Philippines differing
from the general tariff of the United
States.
The question of constitutional construc
tion involved is whether Congress Is pro
hibited from doing this under the provi
sions of the constitution providing that
duties, Imports and excises shah be uni
form throughout the United States, and
prohibiting duties on interstate traffic, or
whether Congress has power to do It un
der the clause of the constitution giving
it power to dispose of and make all need
ful regulations respecting territory and
other property of the United States.
< me of the firmest believers In the un
constitutionallty of the "open door" for
the Philippines or of any tariff for any
of the possesiona of the United States
differing In any way from the general
tariff of the United States Is Senator Caf
fery of Louisiana.
"I have no doubt that It -would bo wholly
unconstitutional," he said to-day, "as I
understand the constitutional provision
that duties, imposts and excises shall be
uniform throughout the United States
means that the same duties must be
levied at every port of the United States
whether that port is one of the States or
in territory held by the United States."
I suggested to Senator Caffrey that It
was held In some quarters that the pres
ent Hawaiian tariff established by au
thority of the annexation resolution was
regarded as a precedent for the proposed
"open door" policy in the Philippines, and
possibly in Cuba and Porto Rico. I asked
him if he regarded the Hawaiian tariff
as unconstitutional.
"I do," he replied. "I regard it as mere
ly one feature of a wholly unconstitu
tional transaction."
Then the Senator made the startling
statement that in his opinion, whatever
be the form of government giveri by the
United States to Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, they would have stable
Governments, and with stable Govern
ments and American capital and Ameri
can supervision, their sugar production
would be increased so enormously as to
completely break down the beet sugar
industry not only of the United States,
but of the world.
BLANDIN MAY BE
CITED FOR CONTEMPT
His Attack on the Judiciary Has
Stirred TJp the Legal Pro
fession.
CLEVELAND, Nov. 24â The sensational
finish in the disbarment proceedings
against State Senator Burke yesterday
has stirred the legal profession of this
city to its foundation. Ex-Judge Blandln,
who so severely arraigned the members
of the county bench, is receiving con
gratulation;; from all over the State for
his fearless stand in the matter. The
Common Pleas Judges will undoubtedly
! take some action in reference to the mat
j ter, but whether to resent it by bringing
j Judge Ulandin up for contempt or to
i make a statement through the press has
not yet been decided. Many attorneys,
however, believe that Judge Blandln will
be cited to appear for contempt of court.
It is said that Judge Ong may take the
initiative in this direction to-morrow
morning.

CORNELL IS
DEFEATED BY
PENNSYLVANIA
Twelve to Six the
Final Score.
VICTORY GAINED IN THE MUD
STRAIGHT FOOTBALL UNDER
UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS.
During a Snowstorm the Quaker
Kickers Force the Carnelian and
White to Flay on the
Defensive.
\
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 24.â 0n a
field knee deep with mud the University
of Pennsylvania football team this aft
ernoon defeated the Cornell eleven by
the score of 12 to 6.
It Is doubtful if ever a game has been
played under more unfavorable condi
tions, both as to the field and the
weather. The wind, which had been
blowing strong from the northeast
nearly all day, suddenly shifted to the
west a few minutes before play started,
and instead of the persistent drizzling
rain a snowstorm of almost blizzard
proportions set in and continued with
out a let up until the game had been
concluded.
When the Cornell team trotted on
the field at 2:04 o'clock it was seen that
Charlie Young, who played such a bril
liant game with the carnelian and
white last year, was in his football togs
and was down on the card as one of
the halfbacks for the Ithica boys.
From a spectacular standpoint the
game was a weary one to look
at. The wretched condition of the field
made it almost an impossibility to exe
cute long runs, and Coach Woodruff's j
famous "guardback" formation was j
rendered almost useless, simply be- j
cause the men could not get enough
solid foothold to get under way. Then,
too, it was absolutely impossible to
prevent fumbling and to do accurate
kicking. Hare's two dismal attempts
at kicking the ball out of danger when
It was within a few feet of the red and I
blue's goal line in the first half caused j
the first score, and C. Young's kirk,
which went almost parallel with the
yard lines right into Hedges' hands,
was responsible for Pennsylvania's sec
ond touchdown. Hedges had a clear
field and the touchdown was easy.
The first half closed with a score of
6 to 0 In favor of Cornell. Durln- the
last few minutes of the first half the
ball had been kept in Pennsylvania's |
territory because of Hare's failure to \
punt more than fifteen or twenty yards, j
C. Young, who did the punting for the
visitors, gained from ten to twenty
yards in this half on each exchange of
punts.
In the second half things were differ
ent. When the Pennsylvania players
went into their dressing room they ex
changed the wet, heavy suits they had
been wearing for new, dry ones, and
when they reappeared on the gridiron
with their dry clothes and the wind
in their favor every one expected they
would redeem themselves. This they
did In a measure, carryine the ball i
down the field by steady plunges,
varied with an occasional end run to
Cornell's 25-yard line, from where Out
land carried it over for a touchdown
in a delayed pass.
The play durintr the second half was
almost entirely In Cornell's half, the
carnelian and white being forced to
play on the defensive nearly the en
tire half. Both teams relied almost on
straight football.
For Cornell Sweetland, Starbuck,
Lueder and C. Young did the best work.
Thi- former, in particular, put up a re
markable game. Outland, Coombs and
Hare were the best ground-gainers for
the Quakers.
The rou^h weather had no aâ <arent
effect on tho attendance at the game,
and by 2 o'clock there were 20,000 peo
ple in tho huge amphitheater. Neither
did the severe storm dampen their ar
dor, for there was an Incessant yell
from the time the ball was kicked off
at 2:09 until time was called for the
end of the game.
The teams lined up as follows:

PAT ODEA IS THE
KING OF KICKERS
Puts TJp One of the Greatest Per-
formances on Record During the
Game at Evanston.
EVANSTON, 111., Nov. Wiscon
j sin, 47; Northwestern, 0. Pat ODea If
king. He demonstrated to-day in the
game between the elevens representing
the University of Wisconsin and North
western University and before one of
j the largest crowds ever assembled at
â¢ Evanston to witness a football game
j that he is one of the greatest kickers
| ever seen on a gridiron. Standing on
j the fifty-five-yard line he kicked a goal
I from the field. The ball went high
j above and squarely between the goal
i posts. Twice he missed a goal by the
4 narrowest of margins from the sixty
i yard line and he made another from the
| thirty-yard line. His punts averaged
| over fifty yards. His all-around play-
I ing showed a vast improvement, the
! firm footing giving him an opportunity
to show his sprinting and dodging abil
j ities. His tackling was hard and sure
' and his return of the ball after a kick
was equal to Herschberger's. Wiscon
sin's exhibition of team work was beau
tiful. At the close of the first Wiscon
sin had a score of 21 and Northwest
ern 0.

MICHIGAN WINS THE
WESTERN CHAMPIONSHIP
Before a Big Attendance the Maroons
of Chicago Go Down Before the
Maize and Blue.
CHICAGO. Nov. 24.â The Western
football championship goes to Michi
gan. On a field that was simply perfect
for fast football and before a crowd of
fully 12,000 the maroons of Chicago
went down before the maize and blue
at Michigan to-day by a score of 12 to
11. Michigan's score represents two
touchdowns, goals being kicked In each
instance. Chicago made one touch
down, a goal and a goal from place
ment. The reversal of form shown by
the Michigan men since they barely
succeeded in defeating Northwestern
was something remarkable. The Michi
gan line, in which big holes were torn
by the light Western team, was simply
impregnable to-day, with the exception
of about ten minutes in the second half,
when the Chicagos, with defeat staring
them in the face, pushed their oppo
nents aside with apparent ease.
The styles of play adopted by the two
teams were altogether different. Michi
gan, with the exception of one or two
double passes, relied almost altogether
on straight football, line bucking and
run? around the ends. Chicago, on the
contrary, used trick plays throughout.
Several substantial gains were made
by double passes, but in several in
stances the plays, on account of the
good work of the Michigan ends, Ben
nett and Snow, resulted in actual krss
of ground. Team worK of a high order
was shown by both elevens.

TALK ONLY INCREASES
THE FAKE'S RAWNESS
Corbett and Sharkey Can Never In-
dues People to Believe They
Fought on the Square.
NEW YORK, Not. 24.â People were
still talking to-day of the fiasco indulged
in by James J. Corbett and Tom Sharkey
at the Lenox Athletic Club on Tuesday
night. Instead of decreasing, the bad
look <>f the affair is increasing, notwith
standing the vigorous denials of those
supposed to be in the "job." The state
ment of Referee "Honest John" Kelly,
made to-day in refutation of one of Cor
bett's remarks, serves only to give the as
pect of affairs a worse appearance.
"Honest John" strenuously denied that
Corbett or any of his seconds either by
word of mouth or look asked him to de
clare all bets off. And the referee of the
contest made the denial as emphatic as
it could possibly be made. It was the gen
eral opinion to-day that the explanations
and denials of Corbett. McVey and all the
rest aro so flimsy and contradictory and
transparent that the restoring to sight of
a blind man would hardly be necessary
for him to see through them.

BE IMPROVED.
Bural Free Delivery Eas Proved a
Success and Its Extension Rec
ommended, by the Post
office Authorities.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, X >v. 24.â First As
sistant Postmaster General Perry
Heath has completed his annual re
port, except the portions relating to
military postoffiees at the army camps
ami in the islands of iht_- Philippines
an.rl the runil free delivery districts,
both of which await more advices.
The genera- business of the depart
ment shows en increase of over $6,000,
000 during ttik fiscal year. In all de
partmenta of -the business the prosper
ous times have made themselves ap
parent. This year there were 27,798,
tiTs domestic money orders issued,
against 26,169055 last year; the amount
carried was 2191,354,121, against $174,
â¢i^-.t>76. Ther'i were 235S new money
order offices established.
The reconu lendations for Congres-
Bional actior are numerous and in
teresting. ]\],r. Heath recommends that
clerks in pojbtofflces be classified and
placed upon" a fixed scale of salaries,
similar to tHat of letter-carriers, so as
to give a fair prospect of advancement
ana certainly of compensation. At
present thert> is no rule or system for
the grading of clerks at postoffices. It
is contended- that an efficient postofflce
clerk is the peer of a letter-earn
there shoulu be no discrimination in
the pay or privileges accorded to either
The hours of labor Of a letter
carrier are limited by law to eight
hours a day and he is ailowed liueen
days leave cf absence per year. Post
clerks have no limitation on their
hours and no vacation without loss of
salary. An appropriation of $60,000 is
requested for the employment of sub
stitute clerks to allow vacations. An
appropriation of $11,800,000, an increase
of $700,000 over this year, is recom
mended for the next fiscal year for
. hire. Congress having appropri
ated $-00,000 less than the department
estimate for clerk hire during the past
fiscal year, considerable embarrass
ment has ensued in meeting emergen
cies incident to the great increase of
public business.
The consolidation of postoffices is
again recommended. Congress is asked
to repeal the law forbidding the aboli
tion of a postofflce located at any
county seat by a consolidation of post
offices. The abolition of small post
s contiguous to a large office hav
:ee delivery and the establish
ment of stations and sub-stations in
lieu thereof, Mr. Heath says, has been !
found to result not only in a vastly J
improve! public service but in substan- I
tial saving in expenses, and he desires
authority to continue this plan.
Authority Is asked to make the clerk
hire appropriation apply to all < I
ces. At present an alloy _
erk hire can only be given to first
:. i class postmasters. Many
third-class postoffices # which onl:
by a few hundred dollars of re-
B from being included In the sec
ond class have so much business that it
is impossible for any one pera
properly attend to it and the postmasÂ»
ters are constantly compelled to pay for
such clerical help as they need out of
their own salaries. There are ir.'lO third
- postoffices, 790 second class and
IT'S first class. One result claimed is
that it would remove the temptation
for postmasters to pad their receipts or
to fraudulently increase their apparent
revenues, so as to get into the second
class.
Free delivery was extended during
the fiscal year to fifty-nine offices. Ad
ditional offices entitled to free delivery
number 110. Dining the current fiscal
year service has been established at
thirty-four of these offices, leaving
seventy-six to await the consideration
of the department.
The First Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral recommends a modification of the
el!?ht-hour law as applied to letter-car
so as to provide for the eight
hours for six days' work and only as
many hours on Sunday within the
eight-hour limit as are absolutely nec
â¢ Bsary for the requirements of the ser
vice. This recommendation is in ac
cord with the views expressed by the
convention of postmasters recently
held at Detroit, and it is believed Its
adoption would meet the approval of
the letter-carriers themselves.
Mr, Heath recommends an additional
grade of carriers, to be known as car
rier sergeants, in all cities having fifty
carriers or more, and that these posi
tions be assigned by competitive exam
inations among carriers who have
served five years or more. The duties
of these sergeants would be to super
vise the work of the letter-carriers on
their routes and to investigate com
plaii â 
He asks an appropriation for salaries
of arriers at established offices for the
next fiscal year of $12,697,200; for the
salaries of letter-carriers at new offices,
$60,000; for horse hire allowance, $410,
i ;ir fare and bicycles. $195,000; all
other Incidentals. $150,000, making a
pi and total for this service of $14,512,
200.
He recommends a repeal of the law
requiring the use of the present form
of money order in the interest of safety
and simplicity, and also authorization
for the use of a postal check payable
to bearer.
A detailed report of the operations of
the rural free delivery will be presented
within a few days. Congress increased
the appropriation for this purpose from
$60,000 to $150,000, and Mr. Heath rec
ommends, in view of the success it has
given, that an appropriation of $300,000
be made foT rural free delivery during
the next fiscal year.
ANXIOU3 TO BECOME

NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â General Fred

Brooke as Military Governor of Porto
Rico. Grant's friends on the island are
striving hard to get the place for him.
This information was obtained to-day
when the transport Mlnnewaska brinKlntf

SHE IS ONE OF THE "BANK" LINE.
The British ships Springbank, now lying at Green-street wharf, and Hawthornbank, loading at Port Costa for
England are sister ships to the Laurelbank, now so long overdue at Astoria from Shanghai. Monday 90 per cent
reinsurance was paid on her, but since the captain of the schooner Prosper reported that he saw her late In October
the rate has dropped to 70 per cent. The Laurelbank was in the typhoon that nearly wrecked the Zealandia and the
ship Heathrteld, and as she has not been seen since the chances are against her ever being heard from again.
Another of the overdues was heard from yesterday. The Scottish Hills, now out IS2 days from Hamburg for
San Francisco, and on which 8 per cent reinsurance was paid, was spoken in latitude 42 south, longitude 34 west, on
August 22. " This news caused the rate on her to at once drop to 5 per cent.
home in January. Grant's friends expect
he will take hold then.

EXHIBITION DRILLS OF
THE SEVENTH REGIMENT
Broad Acres of Agricultural Park the
Stage for a Series of Interesting
Maneuvers.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 24.â A tremendous
crowd gathered early this afternoon at
.Itural Park to witness the exhibi
tion drill of the Seventh Regiment. It was
the finest military exhibition ever seen in
this city The broad acres of the park
were the stage for a series of spirited
maneuvers, wlm drills in company, bat
talion and regiment, a skirmish drill and
sham battle, in which Company C acted
on the defensive against Companies A.
F and I, and was triumphantly van
quished after climbing three fences.
There was also a parade review and some
physical exercises to music. One of the
most unique features was the staking out
of a camp with the shelter tents.
The companies as they marched In re
view at the end of the pa.rade and at the
review by General C. F. A. Last were
.1 by thunders of applause, each line
being as straight as a broomstick.
One of the hits of the exhibition was the
performance of the band, under Princlnal
Musician Hcydenreieh, in "pounding off"
with Sousa's "Semper Fideles Maroh,"
with the bugle accompaniment. It was a
great Thanksgiving day for the regiment
and for its friends. One or two of the
companies had a moderate holiday feast
sent in from their townsâ a pleasing
change from the camp fare.

Whites of Anniston, Ala.. Incensed
and the Disturbing Element Is
Being Arrested as Fast
as Possible.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANNISTON, Ala., Nov. 25.â Rioting
between white and negro soldiers be
gan yesterday, and was kept up at in
tervals until the present time â 1 a. m.
So far two negro soldiers have been
killed, five white ones wounded, two
desperately, and a number of negro
soldiers are known to be wounded, but
have been hidden by friends.
The provost guard is unable to check
the rioting. A battalion from each
regiment is now under arms, and the
city is covered by a close picket line,
surrounding the entire negro camp.
The most serious riot occurred on
Fifteenth street, a tough part of the
city, where the provost guard detail
was attacked by several hundred negro
soldiers. The guard was not supplied
with cartridges until after several en
gagements. The armory of the Wood
stock guards was broken into by citi
zens and 2000 rounds of cartridges and
fifty guns were given the white sol
diers.
Rioting is still in progress, and the
gravest fears are entertained that an
encounter will take place between the
negro regiment and the whites. Feel
ing is running high, and the white sol
diers are terribly incensed and may kill
many negroes before morning.
An ambulance has just come to the
provost camp, bringing one dead and
one dying negro. Saloons have been
closed by orfler of General Frank, and
will remain closed until the trouble
Every negro found to-night is being
arrested and locked up on the general
charge of rioting, if no more specific
charge is filed. Nearly every one of
them is armed, and they are sullen and
vicious. Not less than 1000 soldiers are
now on guard, and officers are making

Services at Bush-street
Synagogue.
Rabbi Meyer preached yesterday at the
Thanksgiving services held in the Bush
street Synagogue. He chose for his text:
"Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good."
In part he said:
The =pirit of ancient Israel has evidently en
tered the hearts of the people of America. To
day millions of our fellow citizens are offer
ing thanks to the great Benefactor for mani
fold blessings Bhowered down on this eurthly
paradise. All animate nature forms one chorus
ol praise In thanking: the Creator of all. How
n u.-h more should man. the high priest, feel
thankful tn God for his mental and spiritual
powers anil ior his capacity to love even as
<:'"i himself.
The Jews in this country should feel grate
ful for enjoying civil and religious liberty and
for dwelling in a land where all men are recog>
nized, more nn<i more, to brothers to children
of the same heavenly Father.
Y. M. C. A. Thanksgiving Dinner.
The seventeenth annual dinner of the
Young Men's Christian Association was
given at the Association building yester
day. There were present many young- men
who were strangers to the city, and they
all enjoyed themselves immensely. They
were the guests of the Mothers' Club of
the association. Mrs. D. C. Wright pre
sided during the day. About 400 were
present, including many students of Stan
ford and Berkeley universities. After
dinner speeches were made, and many
S>i> asant reminiscences of past days in the
association work were related. Ladles
from all the churches participated in the
reception. There was a homo gathering in
the evening, at which speeches, recita
tions, songs and music were in order.
Made the Poor Happy.
The ladies of the Young Women's Chris
tian Association, 1259, through the kind
ness of numerous friends and many of the
leading merchants, were enabled to pro
vide Thanksgiving dinners for over 100
families who are without means. Many of
them had not had such a dinner for
years, and it seemed impossible for them
all to express fully their gratitude for the
thoughtfulness of the ladies. The ladies
taking an active interest in the work
were: Mrs. W. O. Gould. Mrs. A. R. Bald
win, Mrs. 1. N. Morse, Mrs. H. J. Sadler,
Mrs. W. Gunn, Mrs. G. W. Prescott, Mrs.
J. Spruancf. Mrs. J. L. ilartel, Miss L.
Reed and Miss M. Farquharson.
Native Sons Entertain.
Bay City Parlor No. 104, Native Sons of
the Golden West, gave a merry minstrel
show and dance in Native Sons' Hall last
night. Assisted by the Knickerbocker
quartet and the line of Jokers, strength
ened by Louis Van Vllet and Walter (.".
Feisel, prominent amateur comedians.
Bay City Parlor entertained the large
gathering royally. Every one who at
tended the entertainment went there in
search of fun and did not go away dis
appointed. When the black-faced min
strels announced the conclusion of their
entertainment the hall was cleared of
chairs, and the dance began and did not
conclude until after midnight.
VERT OLD WORDS.
Take the words corn and storm.
These words were spelled in the year
700 precisely as they are spelled now,
having preserved their apparent form
(with the loss of the trilled r in South
ern England) for 1200 years to our cer
tain knowledge. Hence these words
must be of extreme antiquity, and it be
comes difficult to limit the time of their
origin.â Walter W. Skeat in Notes and

occasion, fone^day, 'to^dictatejfto a stenographer in the business 6fficÂ«
of one of the treat Philadelphia newspapers, I remarked that his duties must bÂ«
tiresome and di..icult from l>eing obliged to write down notes of what so many differ-
ent persons said and, therefore, compelled to accustom himself to all sorts of articula-
tion. "Yes," was his reply, "very few people realize the exacting labor such a
position entails. A clear head is absolutely necessary and the least illness often
seriously affects the correct performance of my work. For instance, I at one timo
suffered from a stomach trouble brought on, I suppose, by eating cold lunches hastily,
as is necessary with me, and I finally felt that the trouble would break me up. You
know a disordered stomach is invariably the root of any head trouble and of all
things a stenographer's head must be clear. I finally found an effective remedy in
RIPANS TABULES which I saw advertised in our paper. They are magical in their
effects, and, by the way, did you ever see anything of the sort put up in such superb
shape ? I have found that they seem to rectify nearly every ill, for several of my friends
have taken my prescription .of a Tabule now and then with results for which they hava
heartily thanked me. The dull, heavy headaches I sometimes had are all gone now.
If I take dictation from a man who annoys me and makes me nervous I always take a
Tabule at the time, and if his breath is not sweet I give one to him."

TAYLOR OR
TIFFANY MAY
BE PROMOTED
Bishop's Resignation
a Big Surprise.
PASSENGERS ARE ANXIOUS
A CHANGE MAY CAUSE AN
INCREASE OF FARE.
Many Reasons Given for the Change.
Present Condition of the Iloads
Needs a Manager's Con
-';ant Attention.
Oakland OffiVe San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Nov. 2i.
The 700 streetcar men of Oakland, Ala- j
meda and Berkeley who are employed by
the Realty Syndicate were greatly sur
prised to learn tjiat on December l there
is to be a change of general managers
and that Ira Bishop had already resigned.
On account of the prominent part taken
by Mr. Bishop In City Council matters re
lating to franchises and also to the Lako ,
Merritt dredging matter his resignation was
generally thought to â¢>:\n that he would
remain in control until the many changes
he has inaugurated in the syndicate sys
tem had been carried out. It was an
nounced to-day that Mr. Bishop would re
tiri on the first of next month
No intimation has yet been given by
of directors as to who will sui
Mr. Bishop, but it is understood that Oie '
choice if between Assistant Manager Tif- j
fany Superintendent Potter and Secre
tary Sam Taylor, while ex-Chief of Police
Charles E. Lloyd is also mentioned.
The change of general managers is an ,
event of great interest to the thousands of
people who daily travel over the syndi- i
li: ., s, as v may moan that there
will be no more 4-cent fares. It is said ;
that on.- of the reasons why a change
will be made is that there is a desire on
the part of the directors to recall thai
system of transfers which permits a pas
â¢ to ride from the entire easterly
end of Alameda to the heart ol Berkeley
for o, â  I his riae was formerly 10
cents but until two weeks ago it was but
t ' s on November l the general man
leer Btopped the Bale of tickets, and 6
cent fares are now paid. An official ol the <
CO â¢?ils y immense system of roads, em
nloving over 7"" men, reaulresf the <â ""-
Btaht attention of a general manager. Mr.
Bishop has so much other business to at
tend to iii San Francisco that It Is impos
sible for him to give the necessary lime
to the railroads. During the past year
the entire system has been broken up,
and tlie various branches now need a
Mention. Ther.' has been
much complaint of cars not running fre
quently enough, of lines being abandoned |
and of there being no connections at
transfer points.
"All these are naturally the result of ;
the" many changes being made in the ;
- and the rearrangement of fran
chises and they demand close attention to
bring them up to a point of perfection.
When the syndicate acquired the various
liius none of them were paying and Gen- I
oral Manager Bishop started in to put I
affairs on an economical basis and his plan
is very comprehensive. He has it pretty
Well laid out now. but, of course, it is not j
an agreeable task, for the public is bound !
to kick. Mr. Bishop realizes that he can
not give the necessary time to it, so he |
has resigned/"
THANKSGIVING IN OAKLAND.
All Denominations United in Praise
Services.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, Nov. 24.
The local .churches united to-day in j
holding general Thanksgiving service?, j
under an arrangement decided upon at a .
recent meeting of the Ministers' Union, :
held in the Galindo Hotel. Union services ;
â were held at the First M. E. Church,
where Rev. Charles R. Brown delivered an i
interesting sermon, while Rev. J. K. Kno- j
bell presided over similar services in the
Tenth-avenue church.
There was a grand-demonstration by the
Salvation Army to-night, including a very
creditable street parade, and Dr. Coyle's
First Presbyterian Church was crowd d to
the doors with a throng eager to listen to ;
the words of Mrs. Booth-Tucker, who de- I
livered a stirring address. j
The 289 Inmates at the County Jnfirmary
had special reasons to be thankful. All
seemed happy and fairly well to-day as
they satisfied the inner man with nineteen j
roast pigs and apple sauce, topped off
with mince pie.
At the City Prison the festive roast tur- ,
key is never served, and the twenty-nine i
prisoners shared almost the same fare as i
the forty-live Incarcerated at the County ;
Jail, where the substantial dish consisted
of cornbeef and cabbage.
The patients at the Receiving Hospitalâ !
at least those whose -condition did not
'spoil their appetitesâ fared bjest of all, for
the matron. Miss McDonald, prepared tur- I
key stuffed with oysters.

BRANDES NOW
BREAKS DOWN
AND WEEPS
Realizes His Serious
Predicament.
DEUPREY MAY DEFEND HHVI
ATTORNEY AND PRISONER
HAVE A CONSULTATION.
The Accused Man Spends Thanks
giving in Sorrow and Tears
While Mrs. Brandes Im
proves.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
POS Broadway. Nov. 24.
William A. Brandes, charged with the
murder of his 13-year-old daughter. Lil
lian Brandes. is manifesting a realization
of the seriousness of his predicament.
When Brandes was first placed in a
cell at the County Jail he talked without
.heck. He charged that his enemies in
Berkeley were trying to railroad him to
the penitenltiary or to the gallows. He
had every hope apparently that the Coro
ner's jury would exonerate him of the
charges that had already been openly
made against him, and when the verdict
finally pointed to him as his daughter's
cruel* slayer he decided to talk no more.
But to-day Brandes wept. He wept bit
terly and long. Instead of pacing up and |
down the smooth floor of his cell, as he
had been wont to do since his incarcera
tionâhe lies down most of the time and
sobs and moans, and finds no solace In
thought or rest and peace in sleep;
grumpy when the jailer seeks to
minister to his needs, and deter
mined to talk no more about 1 .. the
crime which tills his mind. His health Is
not the best; in fact, he Is considered as
getunl into "poor shape" for the ordeal
of a preliminary hearing and trial.
It is Quite likely that Eugene Deuprey,
who eft no stone unturned and no point
in law untested In defending Theodore
I urrant and only recently saved the neck
of Nathaniel Meadors, who was acquitted
of murdering Jonas I ry at ( amp Barrett,
will appear in Brandes 1 defense.
Attorney Deuprey called at the County
Jail to-day and held a long consultation I
With the prisoner, and when he left the
Impression prevailed that he would de- 1
fend Brandes, though the latter is gen
erally supposed to be penniless.
Later in the day Wickliffe Matthew ar.d
still later Attorney Bennett were closet
ed'with the prisoner, but the latter had
nothing to give out as to whom lie had
retained as counsel.
Mrs. Brandes. who is charged with be- \
ing an accomplice, is daily improving and
regaining her former composure, She Js â 
no longer Qdgety and nervous and ap- j
pears to be refreshed after her night s
sleep Since her husband's arrest she has |
not seen him or been allowed to com- |
municate with him in any way.

DEVOTEES OF
RACING OUT
IN NUMBERS
Mr. Hobart Won the
Gentlemen's Race.
ROSINANTE FINALLY SCORED
THE WEATHER AND CROWD
JUST SUITED ZAMAR,
Favorites First on Three Occasions.
Amasa Outsprinted a Field of
Fast Ones, Proving a Sur
prise â Magnus Wins.
An old-fashioned holiday crowd found
its way to the races at Ingleside yester
day. The grand stand was overflowing
with feminine loveliness bonneted and
gowned according to fashion's latest de
cree, and the betting ring was a surging
mass of the sterner sex. 'all bountifully
supplied with coin. Many of the latter
backed the long shots because they
wanted quick and handsome returns.
These fortune-hunters wore doomed to
disappointment, for outsiders In the bet
ting never got their heads above water.
Thoughts of fatted farm turkeys, old
fashioned dressing, mince pie and the hour
.if 6 o'clock prevented any outbursts of
enthusiasm, the scanty, half-dressed card
not admitting of such.
The favorites held their own, that was
all, taking three purses. Eddie Jones
and "Skeets" Martin divided the sadcue
honors, two winners being placed to the
credit of each.
Mr. Ilobart won the race for gentlemen
riders, and society, which was there in
limited numbers, cheeredâ twice. . Mr.
Hobart now owns two-thirds of the silver
competition cup, .and probably has a
mortgage on or has been promised the
other third. The conditions of the race
said a handicap. Mistral was not treated
badly, and the ring installed him a 1 to U
chance, llf won easily by a quarter of a
dozen lengths. In a hard drive with Mr.
Hume, on Flou, Skinner succeeded in Ki
ting second place with Stan Powers. Wil
liam 08, the only horse at the weights
with any chance of beating the favorite,
was turned the wrong wuy when the bar-
Vier flew up.
Yentoro, the likely son of Golden Garter,
had matters pretty much his own way in
the six-f.urlong dash lor two-year-olds,
which opened the day's sport. The brown
youngster was a 1 to 4 choice, and won
from the start. Driving hard, Piggott,
astride Limewater, got the place by a
head from Espionage.
The chances of Daisy F looked most
rosy to win the seven-furlong run, de
cided under selling conditions. The mare
reigned a pronounced choice in the bet
ting, and after running a trim and game
race for Jockey Woods was beaten a
nose by Magnus, the second choice, ridden
to perfection by "Skeets" Martin. Octu
ruck passed a" quiet forenoon, finishing
third. , . _,
The mile handicap proved easy for Ro
sinante. Cnffey's mare was a 4 to 5 favor
ite and ran away from Yankee Doodle
through the stretch, winning with several
pounds to burn, in 1:43%. lankee Doodle
outgamed the light-weighted Rosormonde,
securing the place by a head. Storm King
was backed, but was not ready, never cut
ting much of a figure.
In the fifth extravaganza Zamar II
made his debut as a winner. He started
before and his last performance entitled
him to be a 30 to 1 shot. The bookies,
however laid 4. and he was backed down
to 3 He won. Lady Britannic made the
running and then finished second. Polish,
after a tempestuous voyage, got the show.
The muchly improved Amasa was never
headed in the final six furlong trip. As
good a 8 Eft to 1 was chalked about him.

REVISION OF
PENSION LAWS
Advocated by Secretary
Bliss.
ALASKAN AFFAIRS DISCUSSED
SMUGGLING OF LIQUOR DIFFI
CULT TO CHECK.
Urgent Appeal for Land Laws for
the Settled Portion of the
Great and Rich Terri
tory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â The an
nual report of Secretary of the Interior
Bliss, made public to-night, reviews in
detail the progress Qt pension, Indian,
land, patent, educational and territorial
affairs. Reviewing the gradual diminu
tion of the public land area, Secretary
ed $100,000.
Of three hundred and odd million acres of
desert land requiring irrigation to render
them valuable farming lands, the avail
able water supply is suiflcient for only 71,
60U.WU acres, leaving 2W,67U,u00 acres suit
able only tor grazing purposes. There are
thirty forest reservations, embracing an
estimated area of 40,719,474 acres.
Reviewing pension matters, Secretary
Bliss reports 635,000 claims of all classes
pending, and says a separate division
has been organized for the adjudication
uf claims growing out of the war with
Spain. These soldiers will receive their
pensions under the general law for per
manent disabilities contracted in the
service.
He also concurs in the recommenda
tion for the creation of a commission
to revise the pension laws and regula
tions in the interest of a future relia
ble, intelligent and uniform practice.
Early legislative enactment for the
taking of the twelfth census is urged
in view of the necessary large amount
Of work preparatory to the enumera
tion of the population.
The advancement along educational
lines is outlined by an increase of over
a quarter of a million of pupils in the
United States for the fiscal year 1896-97
over the previous one, but yet the aver
age amount of schooling per individual
for the whole United States, measured
by the present standard, does not quite
equal five years of 200 days each for
each inhabitant. The total number of
school pupils in the country in ele
mentary public and private schools,
colleges universities, high schools and
academies, is put at 16Â£55.093.
The reindeer and Lapland drivers in
Alaska have largely passed into the
service of the PostofHce Department :
and are now being distributed for car- j
rying the Yukon mail up and down the !
valley of the Yukon through a thousand
miles of scattered mining settlement in
the wilderness.
The report makes no mention of the
recommendation of Commissioner of
Railroads Longstreet for the Govern
ment construction and operation of a
new trans-continental trunk line from
Kansas City to San Diego.
Secretary Bliss, summing up the re
port of Governor Brady of Alaska, calls
attention to the difficulty of preventing
the smuggling of liquor into Alaska, it
being impossible to enforce present reg
ulations without a fleet of revenue cut
ters and steam launches to patrol the
tortuous channels of Southeast Alaskan
waters.
Smuggling prevails and saloons are
open in all of the towns and mining
camps. The Governor reports a con
sensus of opinion in favor of a strin
gent high license law which would tend
to stamp out smuggling and liquor sell
ing to the natives. The application to
Alaska of the liquor laws in force in
the District of Columbia with several
minor modifications is urged as meet- i
ing a majority approval. The Governor j
believes that Alaska should and can
pay revenue into the United States
Treasury.
Under a high license law he estimates
that the liquor traffic would yield an
annual revenue of not less than 5200,000;
a tax of a few cents per case on salmon
would produce from $25,000 to $50,000;
10 cents a ton of wharfage collected
during the past year would have yield
ed Â§100,000.
He recommends, however, that any
system of taxation for the Territory be
deferred until land laws shall have
been provided.
Many sections of Alaska*, It is shown,
are suitable for agricultural purposes.
With proper care cattle can be raised
In the milder districts. It cannot be
doubted that in the course of time
herds of reindeer will cover the plains
of Northern Alaska and a few thou
sands of dollars spent now in helping
the Esquimaux to obtain herds will
save the expenditure of many thou
sands in the future.
The fur seals are doomed to extinction
unless all pelagic sealing can be stop
ped. The branding of female seals has
proved a success. The brands render
the pelts valueless and show that the
United States has a property right to
the animal.
The raising of blue foxes is becoming
an important industry.
The hunting of the sea otter has been
so unremitting that few are now left.
The Governor recommends that the
| killing of them be prohibited for a long
time.
Representation in Congress for the
'â¢itlzens of Alaska is strongly urged.
An appropriation of $60,000 far the
education of children in Alaska is
earnestly recommended.
Attention is called to the fact that
the rapid increase of the number of
vessels plying in Alaskan waters ne
cessitates the erection of many light
houses. Other recommendations include
a monthly mall service between Sitka
and Unaiaska; cable connection be
tween the United States and Alaska;
enlargement of administrative author
ity and extension of the land laws to
at least the settled portions.
The other territorial reports all claim
material progress and urge immediate
recognition as States.
Assistant Secretary of the Interior
Webster Davis, in his annual report,
says the 122,681 appeals from the Pen
sion Bureau and 626 motions for re
consideration ,flled during the year
make up a number unprecedented in
any one year or two years in the his
tory of the Hoard of Appeals. The pro
portionate Increase still continues and
on October Ist last there were 11,820
such appeals ..nd motions pending, and
Secretary BUM concurs in Assistant
Secretary Da is' recommendations for
providing for three additional members
of this board; for additional legislation
amending the act of August 1, 1887, re
lating to marriage legislation; regulat
ing the payment of pensions to soldiers
who deprive their families of- the use
thereof because of immoral habits and
incompeteney; and a legislative amend
ment in behalf of widows whose hus
bands died while in the service, death
not being the r suit of any violation of
any law, regulation or rule of th - mili
tary or naval service; death under such
conditions to be held to be equivalent
to an honorable discharge, as now re
quired. ______________

GREAT INCREASE
OF WORLD'S GOLD
America Makes the
Largest Production.
THIS IS THE BANNER YEAR
EXTRAORDINARY COINAGE RE
PORTEP BY THE MINT.
An Interesting Argument Is Also j
Hade in Support t>f the Main
tenance of the Single
Standard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON Nov. 24.â 1n his an
nual report George F. Roberts, Director
of the Mint, says:
The most important events of the fiscal
year in the world of Government rinance
have been the consummation of the long
p'anned resumption of specie payments
oy Russia in gold, the reorganization or
the monetary system of Japan with gold
as the standard and the refusal ot the
Government of India to co-operate with
the Governments of the United States and
France in an eifort to establish bimetal
lism by international agreement.
The gold coinage of the world in 1898
was the largest recorded, amountng m
value to $4;n,7iy.-'M:i, against 5195,899,517 in
1896. Of the former sum <14ti,02J,W4 was
recoinage, and approximately $2H1,u97,14s a
net addition to the stock of gold coins.
The principal coinage was by the United
States, Great Britain, Russia, Germany,
Austria-Hungary, France and Japan. The
extraordinary coinage of the year is ac- j
counted for uy the preparations of Rus
sia, Austria-Hungary and Japan for
their monetary reforms. In the case of â¢
Russia particularly, gold, whiph has been ;
accumulating for years, much of it in
bars, was passed through the mints to
prepare It for circulation. The comple
tion of Russia's plans for monetary re
form and the opening to the uses of
commerce of her great gold reserve, sys
tematically gathered year by year until it
is the greatest single hoard of treasure I
the world ever saw, is in itself a most not
able event.
The development of Russia, her position
as an exporter of breadstuff?, her policy !
of developing home manufactures, will all !
tend to protect her stock of gold and :
make use for more: but her own produc- !
tion is increasing, and unless she is about
to enter a period of unprecedented activ
ity and development seems likely to sup
ply her needs.
Throughout the world, among all peo
ples who are sufficiently civilized and am
bitious to have international intercourse,
there is manifest a desire to bring their
own currencies into definite and stable re
lations with the money of the peoples with i
whom they trade. The exporter desires !
that the money with which he buys at
home and the money with which he soils
abroad shall have a common unit of ralue.
The manufacturer who Is competing In
foreign markets desire 6 that the money
! with which he buys raw materials and
labor at home and the money in which be
i must quote prices abroad shall have a re- '
lation to each other upon which he may
rely and calculate. If the monetary sys
tems of these countries have no common ;
unit â if each nation, in ignorance or mis
led independence, prefers "an independent ;
system of its own"â they will inevitably i
vary in value to each other, and the
profits of the International transaction we i
are considering are subject "to these varia- j
tlons. Such variations are, therefore, a i
barrier to the trade between countries. ;
It was to escape from such fluctuations .
of the Russian currency, which in i*:c
reached 9.6 per cent and in IS9I 28 per cent I
that the Russian Government has tix< <l :
its paper money at the sold standard. For !
the same reason Austria-Hungary and
Japan have lately done likewise. For
Che same reason India closed its mints
to the unrestricted coinage of silver, and
has been struggling since to hold its ru- j
pee at the fixed value of 16 pence. It is !
for this reason that even Peru, with its \
comparatively small foreign trade, has
closed its mints to the unlimited coinage
of silver. It is for this reason that trie i
Government of France, while friendly to
an international agreement upon the bi- j
metallic money standard, will not enter- j
tain any proposition that involves a pos- i
sible separation of her own currency ;
from the standard used by the other im- I
portant commercial nations of the world. |
The enterprising peoples of the world \
are not voluntarily assuming or remain
ing under conditions which put them at
a disadvantage in the keen rivalry that
salesmen find in every market. Tne en- I
lightened judgment of time condemns !
such a meaningless and burdensome re
straint upon the exchanges. Nor is there
any merit in the plea sometimes made i
that inasmuch as most of a country's
business* transactions are domestic and j
only a small percentage of them interna- I
tionul, therefore, the relations of its :
money to the money of other countries !
is of equally small Importance. The truth
Is that prices In all domestic sales are |
related to prices In international trans- j
actions and cannot be separated from
them. The values of all goods that enter i
into the common consumption of man- â¢
kind are international and cannot be. ef
fected by money legislation. Legislation '
can alter the value of a local currency, ]
but the owner of goods of world-wide de- j
mand simply raises or lowers his price
to correspond with the coinage value of
the money.
Clear as these principles seem to be
there are those everywhere who protest '
against all measures to enforce them, i
Certain narrow objections and sophisti- j
cal doctrines become familiar. Some as
sert that the depreciation of a country's
money has a good effect by stimulating i
its exports. The shipper sells his products !
abroad for gold, converts the gold into !
the currency of his country, and as the
latter declines in value of course he gets ;
more of it. Th" net gain depends upon !
his opportunity to work this depredated
currency off on somebody else at its old i
value. In some countries the exporters
claim to have succeeded in doing this, and
they are pleased and pronounce it a good !
thing. It is said, for instance, that in '
India, while the price of wheat and tea
In silver currency has advanced, the plan
ters can still hire labor at about the i
same wages as before. Evidently if the '
wage-earner consumes wheat and tea he I
is not sharing the good thing.
It is said that in Mexico manufacturers
and planters have enjoyed prosperity by
reason of the rising prices of their pro
ducts in silver while wages have ad
vanced but little. The question natur
ally arises. Who buys these products?
Who consumes In those countries cotton
flour, sugar, shoes, meat and the other
things which in any country are certain to
rise as the Local currency declines'.' It is
i evident that the stimulus to enterprise
which these countries have enioyed has
been precisely such stimulus as the United 1
States would have if the wage earners ''â 
of this country would agree to
gether to accept a % or 60
per cent reduction in their favor. That
might truly stimulate the export trade
for a time. As a matter of wage reduc
tion, a depreciating currency may be ac
cepted as effective. As a policy to stim
ulate exports it Js in Pome cases effective
but temporary, for if it ceases to depre
ciate wages and Other expenses will
gradually withdraw themselves to It, the
importer losing his premium, while if It
continues to depreciate it will eventually
become worthless and all its influence,
beneficent or Otherwise, will perish with i
it. As a policy upon which to build a na
tion's trade and prosperity it begins in
fraud and ends in failure.
Reviewing the efforts of the Wolcott
International Bimetallic Commission
the Director says the sentiment in fa- i
vor of a bimetallic money standard i
supported by international agreement j
had found expression not only by the j
legislative bodies of France and Ger- j
many, but of Great Britain, and It had, |
therefore, seemed opportune that a
conference should be had with a view
to ascertaining what concerted action
might be agreed DpCfl Mr. Roberts
adds:
A single nation acting alone is certain j
to lose the dearer metal entirely and re
tain only the cheaper as Its standard.
Thus, in any country under present con
ditions to open its mints to n.e unre
stricted coinage of both gold and silver !
at I<s to 1. or any thereabout ratio, would
be for it to lose what gold it possessed.
because that metal would surely go where J
it was rated higher. If. however, there*
was no country in the world where it was
legally higher, there would be no place
to which it might go for monetary use
Allowing that the ratio originally agreed
to was approximately the market ratio,
the valuation thus coinciding with iha
judgment of the commercial world, there
seems every reason to believe that such
an international agreement would accom
plish its purpose. Although the efforts ot
the commission were brought to an wl
by the refusal of the Government of In
dia to join the movement the director con
siders the failure indirectly due to a
growing feeling that the rapidly increas
ing product of gold has radically changed
the situation from what it was ten years
ago, when the gold product seemed to be
at a standstill or declining. It has chang
ed to indifference or opposition to the at
titude of many who feared a depreciating
standard, but who are quite as much op
posed to a depreciating one.
Great as was the world's production of
gold in 1898, amounting to the value of
,<;â¢:,: ;.'i4.800, and exceeding that of IS9B by
$34 822 500. it is, judging by the returns
already at hand, certain that the product
of 1898 will bo still greater. The returns
from South Africa for ten months show
that at the present rate of production its
y\> iv will exceed the yield of 18tf7 by $21.
s.">U.iÂ«o. The returns from Australia indi
cate th.it its product in 1898 will exceed
the product ofISOT by $10,335,000.
From July l."i last to November 15 the
receipts of gold at Seattle and San Fra;i
â  â¢isc ip from the Canadian Yukon aggre
gated about (10,000,000, and on this basis
the Increased product for Canada in 1893
is estimated at $8,500,000.
The increase in the United States can
hardly fall below $5,000,000. The total of
these estimates is $45,687,000, which. add< '1
to the figures of 1S!)7. would Indicate a
world's product in 189S of J283.192J
the remaining countries in their aggregate
are unchanged. The product of 1891â
$130,000,000â will be more than doubled, and
the. combined value of the gold and silver
product ten years ago exceeded by gold
Stocks of gold in sight in European
banks and Government Treasuries fmm
December, IM>2 to December. 1897, increas
ed about $650,000,000 or over 40 per cent
The stock of gold in the United States in
creased in the five years $85,457,000 The
increase In the gold holdings of the banks
of Australia, Canada and South America
was about $15,000,000. Total gold thus ac
counted for $960,450,000.

Many bets were made on the size of
Gage's majority, and the announce
ment of the result has brought joy to
B' me gentlemen of sporting proclivities
and woe to others. Chairman Frank
McLaughlin of the Republican State
Central Committee is perhaps the sad
dest man who backed his opinion with
his cash. The major was confident that
Gage's majority would exceed 20,000
votesâ so confident, in fact, that he
made a wager with W. W. Foote to the
effect that the official returns would
Bhow Maguire to be at least 20,000 votes
behind his more popular opponent.
This was not an ordinary wager, as
will he shown wLon its conditions are
stated. It was agreed that the loser
6hould purchase for the winner one
complete outfit of wearing apparel to
cost not less than $500 â the outfit to in
clude shoes, socks, underwear, linen,
one suit, neckties, gloves, overcoat and
hat. The specifications called for a silk
hat of the finest make and latest block;
an overcoat lined throughout with the
finest quality of silk and to have deep
cuffs and collar of the best and most ex
pensive Russian able; underwear of
knitted silk to cost not less than $27 a
suit; a dozen pairs of socks of as fine
a texture of silk as ever came from the
loom; and shoes of patent leather, hand
made and warranted t' shine un
dimmed for many moons. The balance
of the outfit was of course to be in
keeping with the articles named, and
all to cost not less than $500.
Major McLa-> ghlin is nothing if not an
optimist. "When the returns came in
after election he was so certain that
fiage's majority would reach 20,000 that
he went out and gave the order to have
Â£]1 of the beautiful and expensive arti
cles mentioned in the bill of particulars
of the stipulated wager between him-

above the medium height andâ must it
be said?â somewhat corpulent. Mr.
Foote is several inches shorter and
does not boast of so great a girth.
There factsâ ordinarily of little conse
quence and not calculated to detract
from the individual style of beauty of
either gentlemanâ was brought vividly
to the notice of the major when the of
ficial returns were announced, and he
realized that he had lost the wager.
Having ordered the outfit for himself,
he now realizes that he will be forced
to take it because the articles of which
it is comprised will not fit Mr. Foote.
This does not relieve him, however, of
the necessity of paying for another and
similar outfit which has just been or
dered by Mr. Foote. To add to his sor
rows the winner threatens to dress
himself in the new finery, patent
leather silk tile, sable trimmed over
coat and all. and hire a special train to
carry him to Santa Cruz, where he in
! tends to spend one entire day strutting
up and down in front of the major's
palatial residence on Beach Hill.
There has been considerable specula
tion during the past few days as to
who will be selected for the position of
chief clerk of the Assembly. During
the last two sessions the place was held
by S. J. Duckworth. It is asserted in
many quarters that the place will
probably be given to Charles W. Kyle,
the well known attorney, of this city.
During the campaign Mr. Kyle
stumped the State in the interests of
the Republican State ticket, and his
services as a campaign orator were
Invaluable.

FEAST AT THE ALMSHOUSE,
One Thousand Unfortunate Inmates
Enjoy a Thanksgiving Dinner.
One thousand aged inmates of the Alms
house sat down to a royal feast at that
charitable institution yesterday. These
old people, many of them helpless, scores
of them crippled and emaciated from the
ravages of disease, see but little of life's
enjoyment, but yesterday there were not
many among them discontented with their
lot. although some were saddened by the
memory of Thanksgiving days they had
known when they were not dependent
upon charity and feasted by their own
firesides. their families and friends
around them. It was a generous bill of
fare these old people enjoyed. Turkey, of
course, cranberry sauce, mince pie, cakes,
mashed potatoes and green vegetables in
plenty being among the good things
placed before them. At the conclusion
of the dinner those who were able went
to the chapel, whore Rev. D. A. Kelly
held services. Services over all returned
to their quarters happier for the good
time afforded them.

It Is said that the prisoner used the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1898.
SOME NOTES
ABOUT THE
STAR PLAYERS
Pitcher Russell Meets
With an Accident.
LOHMAN'S GREAT THROWING
HE DEMONSTRATES A PBACTI
CAX POINT.
Pitcher and Catcher Must Work in
Unison to Consummate Such
Plays â Lange's Long
Hit.
By Joe Corbett.
Pitcher Russell, the star twlrler of the
Oakland club, met with a most serious
accident on Monday last and in conse
quence will be out of the game for at
least six weeks. A weight weighing many
pounds fell on his leg and tore that mem
ber from the calf to the ankle, and not
satisfied with the damage already in
flicted smashed his ankle in a horrible
manner. The doctor said it would be six
weeks and possibly longer before the
great pitcher will be able to take his
turn in the box.
Russell began pitching in the middle of
the season and was a success from the
start. His mark, however, at the begin
ning was not so good as it was a month
later, for he had a few faults which took
time to overcome. He mastered his de
ficiencies in much quicker time than the
average player takes and was. Just before
his sad misfortune, one of the very best
twirlers in the league. Manager Cal
Kwlng 1 feels greatly depressed over the
loss of his great standby and says it wyi
be a hard task to replace him.
Pete Lohman's worth as a catcher
struck baseballdom with terrific force on
Sunday last. The old veteran many were
inclined to believe had seen his best days
behind the mask or chest-protector, but
their minds were changed for good and
all time after Pete's superb exhibition of
throwing to bases in last Sunday's mem
orable contest.
Time and again I have expatiated, with
an occasional bit of acrimony, on the
question that a baseman had no more
right to steal from first to second with
a man on third without being molested
than he had without this runner being on
third. My efforts to spur catchers on to
consummate this play met with iittle or
no success. Each game caw runners
walking from lirst to second, until last
Sunday Ldliman surprised everybody by
catching those runners every time tney
started but once. And even his one man
who escaped did so because Hanley failed
to be at the bag.
Lohman's great work was received with
thunders of applause. Even the most
disinterested spectators knew that this
work of Lohman's was out of the ordi
nary, and therefore the treat was a glori
ous one. I myself felt quite Jubilant, al
though it made but little difference to me
whether Lohman threw to second or not.
1 was persistent in Baying this play could
be made and that no runner had a right to
walk to second base under any circum
stances without some attempt being made
to catch him. My arguments failing to
convince, Lohman's practical demonstra
tion of the play will in all probability
meet with approval. It should, at any
rate, and all catchers in the future should
make the play, for if Lohman can do so
I see no reason why the other catchers
cannot.
The pitcher plays a most important
role in the consummation of this play;
and I really consider him as responsible
as the catcher when the play is not
brought to a satisfactory termination.
The idea among the pitchers of the Pa
cific Coast League is that they, like the
majority of backstop?, labor under the
impression that the runner on first, with
one on third, is entitled to second. They,
therefore, in view of the fact, pay but
little attention to the man on ilrst, and in
consequence he secures a lead that the
TWO CLEVER RING GENERALS.
Lavigne and Traeey, Who Are to Fight Twenty Rounds This
Evening in Woodward's Pavilion.
AT 9 o'clock this evening the two clever exponents of the grame of fisticuffs, George Lavigne and Tom Traeey,
will enter the ring In "Woodward's Pavilion to contest twenty rounds. It can be safely said that the men will
fight on their merits and that the best man will be awarded the decision. The National Club, be It said to Its
credit, has up to the present time the honor and credit of giving first-class fistic entertainments, and it goes
without saying that the contest of to-night will in all probability give better satisfaction than any of the twenty
round bouts which have been carried off under the canopy of Woodward's Pavilion in many moons.
Those who are conversant with the game are well aware of the fact that Traeey and Lavigne are two of the
most expert boxers and ring generals in the fighting business, and as a consequence the lovers and admirers of
high-class sport will doubtless attend in large numbers. The preliminary to the event of the evening will consist of
a ten-round bout between "Speck" Smith and Willie Cole. Smith is the champion feather-weight of the Olympic
Club, and his opponent is champion feather-weight of the Manhattan Club, x rices of admission are |3, $2 and $1.
greatest catcher in the world could not
overcome. Now on a play of this kind
the pitcher and catcher should work in
unison. The first named individual
should hold the runner as near the base
as he would if there were no runner on
third. By doing so the catcher is en
abled to get the ball to second in time,
whereas if the runner on first secures a
good lead it is almost impossible for any
catcher to head him off.
I should like to see all catchers and
pitchers make this play. It cannot be
done always; and, again, a bluff throw to
second will occasionally catch the man
on third napping. A blurt in the proper
place is a good play, but until Lohman
proved my assertion the catchers did
nothing else but bluff. The bluff is all
right in its place, but a continuation of
this thing brings but little good. Once
again I desire to compliment Lohman on
his superb work and upon the lesson he
has taught players who have let such
golden opportunities slip by. There can
hardly be an excuse offered in the future
by any battery for permitting the runner
to walk to second. He must be checked,
for Lohman has clearly demonstrated
that he can be.
Rib Bill Lange has accomplished many
great things during his career as - star
ball player, and the following extract
shows that Bill continues to do these
great things in a surprising manner:
BUI Lange has a record for the season of 1898.
He was the first and only man that hit a
ball over the fence at Cincinnati Park in a
championship game in 1898. Bill made the
rrcord-cracker. His hit was the longest way of
the grounds. It was a high fly, and was car
ried before the lively breeze that was blowing
until it went over the fence at the extreme
northeast corner. In other seasons balls have
been hit over the fence at other points. The
only other base hit In a game that cleared tho
boards was made by big Bill Phillips, now of
the Indianapolis team. Big Bill was then a.
member of the Reds and his hit cannot r>e
compared to Lange 1 s because It was made off
un amateur pitcher. It was a hit in a game
the Reds played against the Cincinnati Gyms.
Lange did not seem to throw his whole force
Into the hit. On the contrary It went off the
bat without the "woody ring that generally
symbolizes a terrific drive. That Elmer
Smith's Judgment of a fly ball is very keen
whs shown by his action on Lange's home run.
Elmer ran two or three tteps when It was
first hit and then stopped. He saw long before
any one else did that it was useless to go after
the ball. Â ...
The ball took a curious course after It hit
on the outside. One of the park policemen
gave the heavily-swatted sphere a chase. The
ball first struck the hard granite blocks on
Western avenue. It bounded nearly as high
as the three-story building on the other side
of the street. It took two or three more
bounds and then caromed Into the door of
Kehoe's liquid emporium near the corner of
York street and Western avenue. The ball
struck a mirror and broke it Into smithereens.
Then It caromed again and roiled under a
table where a half-dozen men were playing
cards The barkeeper ducked down behind
the bar and then broke for the door. The card
game broke up precipitately. The occupants
of the saloon were under the impression that
the place had been struck by a bolt of light
ning The sky was overcast at the time, and
thin strengthened their belief. They soon
found the cause of their scare and the ball was
given to the Cincinnati Park policeman who
made his appearance a few seconds later.
Those who are Inclined to be superstitious
found room for reflection from the disastrous
course taken by Big Bill Lange's home run.
"Break a looking-glass and you will have seven
years of bad luck." No one believed that Bill
Lange was going to have any such a direful
time but carrying out the superstition a little
farther the Chicago's had seven runs to the
Red's nothing. This looked like a forlorn hope.
yet the Reds came up from behind, made up
all the lost ground and won out In the ninth
by one run. The superstitious Insist that had
not Lange broken the mirror the Reds would
never have closed up that big gap.
BARNES NOT A CANDIDATE,
He Says He Has No Desire to Be
Adjutant General.
Captain William Barnes of the Eighth
California Regiment declares that he is i
not a candidate for the office of adjutant
general of the State, as reported. On this j
subject he said yesterday to a Call rep
resentative:
"I am not a candidate for the office, nor
would I have the office under any con
ditions. Since it was announced that I
was seeking the place I have received
letters from all ovÂ«# the State in regard â¢
to It and have heon exceedingly annoyed
by them. 1 would like my friends to \
know how I feel on this matter, and that j
I do not desire the office even If it was In
their power to give it to me."
Thanksgiving at the Prison.
The inmates of the City Prison were
treated to liberal supplies of turkey, pies
and other delicacies yesterday at the
dinner hour. They ate so much that whi>n
asked if they wanted more they had to
decline Sergeant Wolf was determined
to signalize his first Thanksgiving in
charge of the prison in good style, and
he succeeded. Judge Conlan was consid
erate enough not to discharge the
"drunks" until after they had partaken
of their dinner.

GAME PATRIA
A WINNER OF
FIRST PRIZE
Splendid Coursing at
Ingleside Park.
THE HARES WERE VERY FAST
MOONDYNE DEFEATED PRINCE
HAL IN A LONG BUN.
The Successful Competitors of the
Meeting in the Final Rounds
Were Patria, Billy Glad
stone and Lawrence.
Standing room only was the order of
the day at Inglesido Coursing Park yes
terday.
Everybody expected to witness great
coursing, and everybody who saw the
sport left the grounds highly delighted
with the entertainment, as it was of the
very best quality. The hares did justice
to themselves. They were in prime con
dition and they ran like demons. In fact,
better coursing could not be expected on
the famous plains of Merced, where runs
of from one to four miles are not by any
means exceptional occurrences.
The dogs received such gruelers from the
first to the third rounds of yesterday's
meeting that, as will be seen by the re
sults, two of the most promising candi
dates had to be withdrawn in the second
round.
Judge Grace, who Is unquestionably en
titled to the dictinction of the nonpareil
judge of American coursing, acknowl
edged that it aaa been many days since
he had witnessed bo many long and pun
ishing courses as were run yesterday at
Ingleside Park. Doubtless the sharp
north wind had something to do with it,
as there is an old adage that "Nothing on
four legs can beat a March hare."
Yesterday was feelingly, so to speak, a
March day and although â¢â¢white" hares
were not in evidence the natives who ap
peared in every day dress Indigenous to
the country which is seldom visited by
general snow, ran with dash and bril
liancy seldom witnessed within the con
fines of an inclosed park.
The course between Old Glory and Vic
tor was a driver on the dogs, which, after
going to the escapes at the extreme ends
of the field, were brought back to within a
few yards of the place of slipping, and
the spectators had a magnificent view of
the finish, which was immediately front
ing the grand stand.
Prince Hal and Moondyne had also a
grueler. The Prince, owing to his indis
position to kill, will never prove a. good
dog to wager on. Moondyne ran a re
markably game course and remained
with his hare until the end.
The winner of first money. Patria, is
one of the gamest dogs that ever shot
from a slip. She proved her good qual
ities at Merced, when, after two most
punishing courses, in the finals she again
entered the slips with a comparatively
fresh opponent, and would have doubtless
won the course had she not killed too
soon. The results of the meeting of yes
terday are appended:

AT UNION" PARK.
Green Valley Maid Carries Off the
Big Stake.
The coursing was good at Union Park
yesterday. Green Valley Maid, who won
the stake, was In fine condition, and show
ed g-ood speed. She was steady on her
game, and Thornhlll was not able to
score much" In the final. Thornhlll ran
pretty well, and beat several good dogs
before he met defeat.
The sensational course of the day was
the one in which McKinley was beaten
by Maid of Ball, a puppy.
There were short enders everywhere,
and the talent could not well call it their
own day. Rock Island Boy went down
when slipped with Van Cloie, a 5 to 1
shot. Rock Island Boy easily led the
hare, but laid off, and Van Cloie, by
steady working, piled up a score which
made the game hers. Hurricane, a re
cently imported dog, was awkward in the
working of the hares, and was beaten by ]
Van Oloie, The following are the re- j
suits: i
