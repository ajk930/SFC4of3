LONDON, Dec. 31.â A

the Times says there is the
greatest activity in the
naval - yards there, while
profound secrecy is main
tained. The movements of
the British fleet and its
whereabouts are not known
at Hongkong. The cruiser

LONDON, Jan. I.â According to a
special dispatch from Shanghai, a sud
den stiffening has taken place in the
attitude of the Tsung Li Yamen toward
Germany, resulting in a demand for
the evacuation of Kiaochau and lead
ing to the belief that Great Britain is
bringing pressure to bear upon Peking.
A dispatch from St. Petersburg says
that on Thursday Emperor Nicholas
granted an audience to the Minister
Plenipotentiary, Yang Yu, who handed
the Czar a personal letter from the
Emperor of China. It is reported that
the conversation turned on the pro
posed Chinese loan.
The St. Petersburg Herald announces
that some Russian vessels have left
Port Arthur and gone into the harbor
of TaMen-wan, with China's consent,
the harbor at Port Arthur being too

vessels.
A special dispatch from Paris says
that M. Roume, head of the Asiatic

BERLIN, D.-c. 1.-The German first

yesterday at Kiaoc, au Bay.
The Norddeutscht Allgemeine an
nounced in big type t_ nignt that Em _
peror William arrive unexpectedly
from Potsdam and had onferred with
Prince Hohenlohe. the Chancellor, the
inference being that the rieeting was
of special importance. Th paper a i so

PARIS, Dec. 31.â The official news

French occupation of Hainan Island by
Admiral de la Bedolliere are absolutely
unfounded.
RUSSIA AND ENGLAND
AGREE TO COMPROMISE
ON KOREAN FINANCES.
This Will at Least Re mo k e One of the Causes
Leading Up to the Present Difficult
Situation.
PEKING, Dec. 31.â Advices Just re
ceived from Seoul, the capital of Korea,
say a compromise has been effected by
an agreement according to which J.
McLeavy Brown, the British customs
agent, and M. Alexieffi, the Russian
agent, to make room for whom Mr.
The San Francisco Call
Brown was removed, will work the
Korean customs together. The British
warships which were present at Che
mulpo and Seoul are there in order to
give moral support to Mr. Brown.
It is regarded here as significant that
Queen Victoria should have bestowed
the Order of St. Michael and St. George
upon Mr. Brown at this time.
Although desirous of obtaining a
British loan, the Chinese Government
refuses to agree to foreign control of
the internal revenue, either immediate
or in case of default. Li Hung Chang,
however, is disposed to favor the con
trol of the internal revenue in case of
default.
In the event of a loan not being pro
curable. China will not pay her war
indemnity until 1902, in acocrdance with
one of the provisions of the treaty of
Simoneski. The final decision is post
poned until after the holidays.
Further German missionary trouble is
reported from the Shantung province.
It will prossibly delay and complicate
the negotiations.
SEEKING TO CONTROL
THE TRADE OF CHINA
TO EUROPE'S ADVANTAGE.
That Is Perhaps the Whole Purpose of the
Present Warlike Demonstration
in the Far East.
NEW YORK, Dec. 31.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: "Civilized
nations have equal rights in opening
the trade of China to the world, and
those powers that attempt to accom
plish it by war and conquest will do no
more than to strengthen the Chinese
wall."
This warning is given by Consul John
France, in a report which has just been
received at the State Department. Mr.
C. Covert, who is stationed at Lyons, j
Covert says four great nations â Eng- |
land, France, Germany and Russia â '
are each engaged in a determined
struggle for the trade of China. While
the great nations of Europe are fight
ing for Chinese territory, it is probable
that the most widespread conquests

may be achieved by peaceful methods.
American business men will leave
nothing 1 undone to advance their inter
ests in the empire. The advantage that
France has- consists in her open fron
tier through .Indo-China. which will
furnish a short route when the Red
River is dredged. Another advantage is
possession of an abundance of cheap
capital.
Mr. Covert transmits a statement
from the report of the French commis
sion which recently returned from
China, where it made a two years' in
vestigation of trade conditions of the
empire, and the report is important as
showing just what nations of Europe
are contending for the Chinese market.
France sent a commission to China
some years ago, and upon its return
published its report. England saw the
advantages set forth in the report more
quickly that the French, and as a re
sult England reaped a better harvest
in the way of additional Chinese trade
than did the subjects of the Paris Gov
ernment.
'The last commission," Mr. Covert
states, "found that the Germans had
become formidable rivals of the Eng
lish in China; that they and the Rus
sians had established cotton factories,
tanneries and feather-cleaning shops,
and that the Russians had established
tea factories and wore growing coffee.
The commission states that the coun
try is rich in copper, iron, lead, silver
bearing ores, tin, zinc, native silver
and immense deposits of coal. The de
velopment of these mines will open a
great field for the use of French tools
and machinery and furnish employ
ment for thousands of French mechan
ics. The commission made a thorough
investigation of the silk industry, and
brought back over thirty specimens of
silk absolutely unknown heretofore in
the Lyons market. The commission
styles Ou Tchang, capital of llawp, the
commercial heart of China.
"It has a population of 1,500,000 in
habitants, is the central market of
about 70,000,000 people, the seat of a
number of industries conducted by
Europeans, and will soon be united to
Peking by a railroad now in course of
construction by the Belgians.
"The commission sees a great com
mercial future in store for Tonkin,
Cambodia and Cochin China. It re
commends the establishment of mills
and factories in China, co-operation
with Chinese in the opening and~con~
duct of mines, the development of cer
tain lines of agriculture, the opening
of better wagon roads and the build
ing of railroads by French companies.
An effort will be made to make Indo-
China into a workshop for China and
an entrance way for French goods des
tined for the Chinese market. The aim
of France will be to make China pro
j ductive, so that her 350,000,000 inhab
j Hants may have something to sell and
the wherewith to buy."

BLEW OUT THE OLD,
BLEW IN THE NEW
Noise! More noise! Still more noise!
All kinds of noise. Tinhorn noise.
Noise of bells. Noise of rattles.
Any old kind of noise, Just so it was
noise. San Francisco noise. Noise!
That was the impression gained by
a walk along the streets last night. It
was New Year's Eve, and with one
accord the whole population seemed
imbued with an overwhelming desire
to be heard.
That was the impression obtained by
degrees of intensity. There were cow
bells, dinner-bells and gongs. There
were tin whistles, tin drams and tin
horns. There were, rattle boxesâ well,
if there is anything that will make a
noise that was not on the streets of
this city last night it was because it
has never been heard of in this part of
the world. Even the Chinese residents,
who are noted for their peculiar kinds
of noise, were amazed at the varied
assortment of sounds produced by
those who were eager to notify the
world in general and their immmediate
neighbor in particular that they were
glad the old year was going and the
New Year was coming.
Market street was the favorite
stamping ground of the sound-pro
ducers, and from away up toward the
City Hall down to Montgomery street,
sweeping out Kearny over the hill to
the Latin quarter, there was a roar
which came from the conglomeration
of sound heard nowhere else in the
world than in San Francisco. Other
peoples have their ways of expressing
their happiness, but here the manner
is particularly sui generis. It is San
Francisco's own way of telling 1 every
body that she is enjoying herself.
Humanity has divers and various
ways of showing its enjoyment. Some
times men get drunk and think they
are happy. Sometimes they make a
noise. Last night was the night for
noise. The intoxication came from the
volume of sound and not from the
alcoholic stimulation. That part came
later â after the noiÃe had stopped.
Early the crowd was only noisy; later
it became boisterous*. There grew a de
sire to do more than make a noise. The
inevitable horseplay followed, and then
it was time for the ladies to go home.
Man is a peculiar animal. There are
times when he seems to forget all that
is due to others, and even to forget
PRICE FIVE CEXTS.
that he is supposed to be human. That
is what occurred last night after the
first boisterousness of the noise waa
over. The rudeness followed.
It was entirely useless to get angry
last night. That but made matters
worse. The crowd was eager for a
victim, and when a man was mad he
was immediately the target for every
horn within reach. The country cousin
who was down seeing the sights was
the victim until he, too, fell into the
custom and purchased a tinhorn and
made a part of the immense volume of
sound that roared up from all parts of
the city.
San Francisco has one night to howl,
and that night was last night â and she
howled. It was a hot time, and every
body enjoyed it except a few pessimists
who can see nothing in this return to
savagery except foolishness. That sort
of man can never appreciate the in
ordinate desire that sometimes takes
hold of one and makes him turn him
self loose, so to speak, and announce
to the world â through a tinhorn â that
he is happy.
It is peculiar, perhaps, but it is the
way San Francisco shows her joy over
the birth of the New Tear.2

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Dec. 31.â Nearly all
of the members elect of the Legislature
have arrived in this city to-night, and
the senatorial skirmish is at its height.
Not since the senatorial election of six
years ago, when the Sherman-Foraker
contest was on, have there been so
many politicians in the city at one
time. Many have come merely out of
curiosity, but a large number are here
to take active part in the contest be-
tween the Hanna and anti-Hanna Re
publicans. To the Republicans at
large the situation is inexplicable. The
anti-Hanna Republicans actually In
evidence are so few in number that the
uninitiated can scarcely comprehend
â why there should be such a struggle.
Charles S. Kurtz, who is the leader
of the opposition to Senator Kanlna,
to-day assumed personal charge of the
anti-Hanna headquarters at the Great
Southern Hotel, and a small army of
workers, mostly appointees of Gov-
ernor Bushnell in the State's depart
ments and the State institutions, be
sieged the rooms. The activity at the
Hanna headquarters at the three lead
ing hotels was even more formidable.
The developments of the day were
decidedly favorable to Mr. Hajina, on
the surface at least. The arrival of
Mr. Hanna on the scene during the af
ternoon seemed to turn the tide slight
ly in his favor. His arrival was a sur
prise to those not in touch with the
managers of Mr. Hanna's interests, as
he was not expected, according to pre
vious announcements, until Sunday.
This change of programme was con
strued by some to indicate that Mr.
Hanna's managers considered the s^tu
iition desperate but there was nothintr
* to tm4tet*ta thar this surmise was well
founded. On the contrary, Major Dick
and his coworkers at the Hanna head
quarters were in the most cheerful
spirits and took a more hopeful view of
the situation than yesterday.
There was some rejoicing over the
public declarations of Representatives
Redkey of Highland County and Smith
of Delaware County that they would
vote for Mr. Hanna. Both of
these Representatives had been claim
ed by the opposition. Mr. Redkey
comes from a county where it was
expected the majority of his party
would indorse his stand against Mr.
Hanna, if maintained. Representative
Smith had a war of words with Mr.
Kurtz as a result of his desertion from
k, the anti-Hanna ranks. Representa
tives Mason and Brambley of Cuyahoga
now stand practically alone in their
open opposition to Mr. Hanna, al
though they do not represent the
strength of the anti-Hanna Republi
cans. The others have, up to this time,
kept closely under cover. Represen
tative Mason is the avowed candidate
of Mr. Kurtz for Speaker in opposi
tion to M. Boxwell.
S. nator Jones of Youngtown arrived
this evening. He was reported to have
said that Mr. Hanna would be defeat
ed. In an interview he said: "I am
here to do my sworn duty under the
constitution. I shall preside at thÂ»- or
ganization of the Senate, and think
there will be no trouble. As to the
Senatorial contest. I know nothing
about it, neither do I propose to take
a hand in the matter. It is my place
and duty to be strictly neutral, and
that is the position I will eccapy. I
hope everything will come out satis
factory to the Republican party. What
more can I say?"
Hanna badges were conspicuous
about the hotel lobbies to-night. Tht-y
bore a picture of Mr. Hanna and the
words, "For Senator, the party's
choice." The Senator was besieged by
callers all the evening, but accorded
a correspondent an interview. In re
sponse to an inquiry as to what he
thought of the situation he saifl:
"The contest between the Republi
can and Democratic parties was set
tled hy the people at the polls last
November. Tho verdict was in favor
of the Republican party and it? plat
form. Since then I have not said any
thing or given any good reason why
th>- verdict .should be changed.
"The Toledo convention recommended
the whole State ticket and indorsed the
administration of President McKinley
and Governor Bushnell. The platform
was adopted by the State convention
by unanimous vote. It contained an in
dorsement of my candidacy for the
United States Senate, and so far as the
party could do in the State conven
tion it v.as committed to my election
to the high office to which I aspire.
That combined action was a part of the
platform of the party, and therefore
Republicans all over the State think
the fruits of the victory obtained by
the success of the Republican party at
the polls means nothing less than that
the will of the voters, as expressed last
November, shall be carried out by their
representatives in the General Assem
bly. I know of no reason why there
should be any change in the pro
gramme adopted at Toledo, and having
faith in the loyalty and patriotism of
the Republicans of Ohio I have no rea
son to doubt, the fulfillment of the
pledges made to the people."
"What do you think of the action of
Mr. Kurtz?"
"I do not see any occasion why I
should indulge in personalities. I con
sider that my own personality in this
contest is insignificant as compared to
the importance of this issue, as affect
ing the future welfare of the Republi
can party. I will merely state that I
am confident that the attempt to de
feat the will of the party will not be
successful."

OAKLAND'S CREW MAY
HAVE BEEN PICKED UP
BY THE LAURA MAY.
Unusually Large Number of Men Seen on
the Little Schooner by a Passing
Pilot.
ASTORIA. Or., Dec. 31.â What prom
ises to be the solution of the disap
pearance of the officers and crew of
the bark Oakland, wrecked near Cape
Flattery recently, has just been
brought to light. The two schooners
which arrived in .the lower harbor on
Thursday were the Laura May and
the Jewell. They anchored near Sand
Island, the Jewell being still in the
harbor, but when they dragged their
anchors, as reported on Thursday, the
Laura May, being nearest the mouth
of the river and unable to get under
control, drifted out to sea again, and
was not seen in the offing to-day.
Shortly before these schooners
dragged their anchors the German
ship Henrietta came in, in charge of
Pilot Malcolm, and anchored in the
lower harbor. Malcolm reported that
as the May was drifting out he count
ed eleven men on her deck. She carries
a crew of only three or four men, and
he thinks it probable she picked up the
men from the Oakland. Malcolm, who
was outside for a week, says the
weather has been very nasty. Three
days ago they passed an American
ship, south bound, under full sail,
name unknown.
The German ship Henrietta, Captain
Seemann, from Yokohama on Novem
ber 22, barely saved her charter by ar
riving up from the lower harbor be
fore 6 o'clock to-night. The captain
says he was thirteen days off the
mouth of the river and was very much
alarmed when he was anchored below
on Thursday night. He had a rough
but uneventful voyage.
The British ship Drumburton, Cap
tain Spurring, which sailed from
Swansea, Wales, on July 8, with a car
go of coal and coke, arrived in yester
day afternoon. The captain reports a
rough voyage, with every variety of
we.-ither. In the lower Pacific he spoke
a Norwegian bark bound from Panama
to the Sound.
The big tug Fearless, Captain Clem
Randall, arrived from San Francisco
to-day and has been placed in service
here in place of the Relief, which will
proceed to San Francisco on Monday
for repairs. The Fearless is perhaps
the finest tugboat on the Pacific Coast,
with the possible exception of the Can
adian tug Lome.
NEW YEAR'S WISHES.
Oakland, Dec. 31. 1897.
Rev. Robert F. Covle, D.D.â
A new park for Oakhnd ; pros
perity in business interests ; right
eousness in municipal administra
tion, and great prosperity for our
churches.
Rev E. R. Dilie, D. D.â For
California a golden jubilee marked
by a revival of prosperity and
manufacturing interests. Fo r
Oakland improved streets, a Sun
day closing ordinance for saloons,
the purchase of Adams Point and
the Jordan Tract for a park
worthy of our fair city. For Oak
landers religious quickening en
thusiasm foi humanity; applied
Christianity.
Rev. C. M. Hill, pastor Tenth
avenue Baptist Church â I should
like to see the city improved in a
material way â the streets repaved
and some new boulevards built,
and a large, centrally located park
secured. I should like to see
more factories here, so that more
of our people could find employ
ment My programme would also
include moral improvement, such
as stopping all disguised lotteries
and games of chance in connection
with business, a closing of all
the saloons, or, failing of that,
closing of as many of them as
possible. In a word, 1 should like
to see in the new year a revival in
business, morals and religion.
H. M. McKnight, pastor of
Asbury Church â My first wish
for Oakland is not attainable dur
ing the new year. But this one
is possible nowâ fair and honest
dealing, at living pric;s. 1 pledge
my influence against the credit
system and all forms of gambling,
whether with slot machines,
coupons, stamps or gifts. Let us
be honest or nothing.

NEW YORK, Dec. 31.â The citizens
of New York, which to-morrow be
comes the second city of the world, en
ter then upon what is believed to be
the greatest problem of municipal gov
ernment ever presented. With the last
stroke of the clock at midnight an
nouncing the advent of the New Year,
there will be born a city such as the
Emperors and Kings of history would
have deemed great for an empire.
For six months, unless the machin
ery of the new municipality gets into
motion, the Mayer of New York has
the power of an autocrat. He may ap
point officials with salaries running in
to the thousands with as lavish a
hand as ever Emperor treated his fa
vorites.
The Mayor will appoint every de
partment head in the city except the
Controller, who is elected for four
years. He will appoint all commis
sioners. Justices of interior criminal
courts, all the members of the school
boards, with the exception of the Com
missioner of Education, the Justices of
special sessions and the police magis
trates, and is given the power to re
move any official in New York and ap
point his successor.
There are five boroughs in the
Greater New York, namely, Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Rich
mond. The municipal legislature is
composed of the Council with twenty
eight members and a Board of Alder
men of ; Â«.y members. The president
of the Council was selected by the peo
ple. The Board of Aldermen will be
chosen by the members of that body
Mayor Van Wyck is given power to
veto any ordinance or resolution of
either body of the municipal assembly
unless five-sixths of the members of
both houses declare otherwise. Each of
the five boroughs has a borough presi
dent, but his principal duty is to pre
side over the various local bodies in his
borough.
The exit of the old year and the in
auguration of Greater New York was
celebrated fittingly to-night. One of
the events that marked the occasion
was a grand parade.
Notwithstanding the warring ele

the early afternoon that the carnival
and parade would be postponed, a
great crowd of merry-makers, mask
ers, wheelmen and members of various
societies with numberless floats, met at
the rendezvous around Union Square
ready to march through the rain and
mud to honor the old city and welcome
the new.
An hour before midnight bombs
placed on the lawn gave the signal
and the parade was approaching, and
just a little later the first of the pro
cession turned into the park. A huge
balloon with trailing light was sent up
and as it swept across the park a
blazing American flag floated down
and remained burning until the bal
loon went out of sight.
The drizzling rain had turned to
snow, but the great crowds remained
surrounding the paraders, who had
gathered in the park for the chief cere

At exactly 12 o'clock the search
lights on the neighboring buildings
were turned upon the flagstaff of the
City Hall. As the hands pointed the
exact hour a little white ball was seen
to climb the staff slowly. The Mayor
of San Francisco had touched the but

furled flag of the city of New York to
the top of the staff. Here it broke out
and swung into the breeze. Then bed

were thrown into the air, sending
down their showers of blazing stars,
and the salute of 100 guns was fired by
the Second Battery of the National
Guard. Soon after the crowd dis

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31.
It has been discovered, on careful in
spection of the permit granted by the
British Government for the taking of
supplies into the Klondike country
En B of duty, that the exemption ex
tends only to such goods as are gra
tuitously distributed. Under the terms
of the act of Congress the Secretary
of War is permitted to give supplies' to
such persons as are unable to pay for
them, but the act seems to require that
where the miners are able to pay for
food the money is to be applied to de
fray the expenses of the relief expedi
tion.
A strict Interpretation of the Brit
ish permit would not sanction this ac
tion. Still, as the permit was in the
shape of a letter from Sir Julian
Pauncefote, the British Embassador.

cence by the Governor-General of Can
ada, and since it was sent the Cana
dian Secretary of the Interior has con
ferred with Acting Secretary Meikle
john, with a full knowledge of the in
tention of the War Department, it is
believed that the Canadian Govern
ment will not interpose any objeetlon
to our Government recouping itself as
far as possible by selling supplies at
cost to miners able to pay for them.
It appears that tne plan of using
reindeer as a means of transportation
from the seaboard to the Klondike
does not promise success owing to the
inability of the Government agent, Mr.
KJellmann, to get the animals from
Lapland in time trÂ» be of any service
this winter. It is the present purpose
of the War Department, therefore, to
push through with the mule pack
trains as far as possible, and old cam
paigners assert that they can get to
Fort Selkirk at least, leaving the rein
deer to follow up the trail if they come
alone: at all. The dee'- would be of the
greatest use if they could be gotten
through to Dawson, even without a
pack load, as they could be slaugh
tered for fresh meat.

ENGLAND'S
IRON HAND
IS SHOWN
Continued from First Page.
state of public feeling in the Mikado's
empire over the complications of the
Far East, centering in China, is shown
l>y the last preas advices received here
from Japan. That the Government it
self has an eye to the gravity of the
question is shown lÂ»y a statement of
the Prime Minister, made in the course
of a reply to a delegation. He said:
'With affairs tending toward dan
gerous developments, as is now the
case in the East, wÂ« shall not hesitate
to ask the Diet for 30.000,000 yen, or
even 40,000,000 if necessary."
This was said only a short time be
fore the Premier was forced to resign
because of a public feeling that the
Cabinet was too weak to deal with the
descent of the European powers upon
China and the probable dismember
ment of the latter country.
The Jijo Simpo, the most Influential
paper in Japan, contains a scathing
arraignment of Germany's course,
declaring the occupation of Kiaochau
shows that the laws and tenets of in
ternational morality have ceased to be
anything more than specious pretense
with European powers and that tho
rule by which their conduct is really
regulated is "the fi>sh of the weak is
the fond of the strong." After declar
ing that Germany thrown off th<?
mask and haa tak.-n thÂ«* lead of the
western powers in the struggle to de
\our China, the paper adds, as to the
attitude of Japan:
â¢The conflagration is on the other
side of the river, but the river is a
narrow one, and the- sparks may easily
fly across. The le.sson for Japan is
that a country's security depends solely
on its strength to resist aggression, and
that aggression haw come to her own
gates. It will not suffice that she
Hh->uld be merely on the defensive. To
preserve what one already has it is
sometimes necessary to add more. A
crisis in the Orient now confronts
Japan, and her undivided strength
must be devoted to guarding against
the perils that menace her."
The Nichi Nichi Shimbun takes a
similar view, declaring that it is a part
of the plan of encroachment of Euro
pean nations upon the East. It adds
for Japan that it has the greatest in
terest at stake in these operations, and
must prepare herself for the emer
gency.
The Nippon Fays the crisis calls for
a resolute foreign policy by Japan, and
avers that nothing tends to impair am
ity more than tame submission to in
sult and wrong. The course of Ger
many is arraigned as a flagrant vlola
tioon of international law.
The Pohuo declares that the time for
tho partition of the Chinese empire has
arrived and adds:
"What shall Japan do? Shall she Join
in the scramble for pieces of the doom
ed State, or shall she oppose its parti
tion? In such a crisis, the like of
which has not occurerd since the res
toration, the portfolio of foreign af
fairs is in the hands of a man in whom
the nation has no confidence."
The TokJo Shimpo takes the radical
position that it is Japan's duty to suc
cor China at this Juncture, on the
ground that the boasted civilisation
and Christianity of the western world
Is slowly tramping down right and
justice in its descent upon the Orient.
Aside from the excited discussion of
the problem in China, the Japanese
press is mainly concerned in the coun
try's extensive naval and military de
velopment. The expenditures on "ar
mament expansion" this year will be
80,645,721 yen and next year 63,250,000
yen.
Brilliant field maneuvers have been
executed by the two army corps of the
north and the south, in the presence of
many foreign diplomats and military
experts. The battle ship Yashima has
Just arrived from the English ship
yards. She is the second of the big
battle ships added to Japan's new
navy, the first being the Fuji. They are
sister ships of 12,517 tons displacement
each, of 20 knots speed and in arma
ment and general appearance much
like the United States battle ship In
diana. The Yashima is the largest war
ship that ever passed the Suez canal,
and it was found necessary to unship
the heavy guns and take off some of
the outer armor to get through the
canal.
â¦
RUSSIA AND JAPAN.
Something of a Comparison of the Soldiers
of the Two Powers.
The magnitude of operations In Asia
is not understood by many people of
the United Stat<r3. It seems now to be
accepted as a fact that Russia has oc
cupied Manchuria with the consent of
the Chinese empire. This province, or
state contains a population exceeding
12.000,000 inhabitants. The country Is
rich, and the people, measured by the
standard of Chinese intelligence and
progress, are advancing: in the march
of civilization. It is in the line of prob
ability that the railroad extending
from the main line of the trans-Siber
ian railway will be constructed to deep
water near Port Arthur. According
to the original plans of the Russian en
gineers, Vladivostok was selected as
the Pacific terminal point of the great
line 7000 miles in length from St.
Petersburg eastward, but changed con
ditions in China following the late war
with Japan gave Russia concessions in
Manchuria which will permit the con
struction of the line to an open port
much further south than Vladivostok.
Every Russian enterprise is guarded
v ith so much secrecy that it is exceed
ingly difficult to obtain actual informa
tion as to the number of miles of road
to be constructed in order to complete
this great work. The road is in opera
tion for a long distance east of Irkutsk
and for 400 miles west of Vladh-ostok.
Water transportation is available
through much of the country between
the eastern and western terminal
points. The work may be so far ad
vanced from Irkutsk eastward and
Vladivostok westward that troops and
supplies from Russia in Europe can be
readily dispatched to the expected
scene of conflict in Asia. Contracts
were awarded to American builders for
the construction of large steamers to
navigate the immense lake in the
mountains oÂ£ Siberia. These boats were
built to carry trains in about the fash
inn of the transfer steamer at Port
CocUl It is quite within the line of
probability that Russia Is in position
to march troops from the eastern'-to
the western terminal station. It is
known that an immense quantity of
army supplies has been stored at
Vladivostok, and that point is destined
to be the bu.Â«e of Russian operations in
a war with Japan.
There is a powerful Russian army at
Vladivostok, but its strength in num
bers is known only to the Russian
authorities. Judging from the number
of troops on transport steamers calling
at Nagasaki for coal during the past
two years, it is estimated by observers
that the force approximates 80,000.
Japan is in position to throw a much
larger army than this to the front in
Korea with very little delay. On the
water as the fleets float to-day Japan
is the stronger of the two, but Russia
cannot be dislodged from her positions
in Manchuria and Korea by warships.
Korea, containing a population of fif
teen million people, is practically un
der the immediate control of the Rus
sians. Seoul, the capital, a. city of
300.000 inhabitants, is only t.wenty-flve
miles from Chemulpo, the principal
sea port of Korea, The military stu
dent would say that England and Ja
pan combined should be able to land
a force at Chemulpo, which would be
ample to capture Seoul in a short time.
The British had experience with the
Russians in the Crimea and there
learned that the soldiers of the Czar
are -not to be despised, henc* a small
British army would not be sent on that
mission.
The popular impression that the Ja
panese army of to-day knows some
thing of war is erroneous, although
many writers on current affairs speak
of the Japanese soldiers as veterans.
The Japanese conquered in the late
war because the Chinese refused to
fipht and ran away. The entire loss
in battla of the whole Japanese army
throughout the entire war with China
was less than the losses sustained by a
single division of the Union army at
Vicksburg in tho assault on the 22d of
May, 1863. Japan may be a nation of
warriors, but her present army knows
nothing of actual battle in conflict
with trained and effective troops. The
Russian troops are exceptional In their
ability to preserve order and discip
line under withering tire. The Japan
ese may be equally resolute and ef
fective, but no opportunity was pre
sented in the late war between Japan
and China to indicate what the Japan
ese army would do in the event of vig
orous resistance.
There is a quickening of commerce
between San Francisco and the Orient
since the concentration of warships in
Asiatic waters. Large quantities of
merchandise, presumably fleet sup
plies, have been shipped to Asia. The
bulk of supplies go the other way
through the Suez canal, hut when a
particular line of provisions must be
had at once San Francisco is the near
est point for the supply. The Cana
dian Pacific and the connecting Hne of
steamships at Victoria are active bid
ders for the transportation of goods.
Chicago is right in the race with San
Francisco for the trade. The Cana
dian Pacific .is giving a very low rale
on through consignments from Chicago
to Hongkong, but not lower than the
rate which San Francisco merchants
obtain from the steamships sailing
from this port to the Orient. The ap
prehension of our merchants has been
excited, however, by the figures which
Chicago houses competing for this new
trade are able to quote.

Copyright, 1897, by James Gordon BenneU
PARIS, Dec. 31.â The Herald's Euro
pean edition publishes the following:
To the Editor of tho Herald: Several
days ago there appeared in the columns
of the Herald what was purported to be
an interview with me. It contained so
many statements that are absolutely In
correct that I think I am justified in
tailing your attention to the matter. I
may say, in the first plate, that the
treatment I received in England from
both jockeys and trainers was courteous
and friendly; that it would have been
trOTM than a breach of good taste to
make ;iny criticism upon them, even had
I had any to make, which iÂ» far from be
ing the case. In the second place I
never stated that I had received offers
to ride next season, either for Lord Wil
liam Beresforrl or the Prince <>Â£ Wales.
Indeed, it in highly improbable that I
can riiie in England next season, as my
exchange contract* in America seem
likely to take up the whole of my time.
Should I be able to arrange it I may
ride for Lord William Beresford and
Mr. Pierre Lorillard. but this is a ques
tion that it is impossible for me to speak
confidentially about until I have been to
America.
The two items will be sufficient to
show you how your correspondent has
been mistaken In the remarks he at
tributed to meâ remarks, I repeat, that
I never made â and I beg you will give
these few lines of correction the same
prominence that you gave to the original

SHARKEY SHIES HIS CASTOR.
Proclaims Himself World's Champion and
Wants a Battle.
VALLEJO, Dec. 31.â The Vallejo
Morning News of to-morrow morning
will publish the following challenge
from Tom Sharkey:
VALLEJO, Cal., Jan. 1, 1898.
To Robert Kitzsimmons, Esq., so-called
Champion of the Worldâ Dear sir: As
the columns of the leading papers in the
United States have been used during the
past few days to give expression to the
views of yourself, your brilliant man
ager, Martin Julian, and James J. Cor
bett, ex-champion of the world, in re
gard to pugilistic matters, 1 deem that
it is not impertinent In me to ask that I
be considered before this championship is
finally done up in elegant tissue paper,
tied with pretty silk ribbon and handed
about with scented kid gloves between
you and Mr. Corbett.
The history of tho prize-ring will bear
out my claim to be the first man that you
should meet, now that you have decided
to re-enter the ring. It is a well-known
fact that Corbett had the police interfere
to stop the light when I had him boaton
in B&n Francisco. It is a fact known to
you that I received a decision over you
in that same city when we met there,
and, atide from all contention, you know
that you fairly lost the contest by foul
fighting. However, I am willing to let
that pas*, and to show to the world be
yond dispute that I am your superior, I
challenge you to a fight to verify the de
cision given in my favor in 1896. I am the
undefeated champion of the world, and
there is no need of you and your brilliant
manager looking about for new worlds to
conquer till you show beyond cavil that
\<u are clearly entitled to the champion
ship that you claim.
I now challenge you to meet me In a
finish fight at the earliest possible date.

WANTS CATCH WEIGHTS.
"Parson " Da vies Submits an Ultimatum to
McCoy for Choynski.
CHICAGO, Dec. 31.â "Parson" Davies,
manager for Joe Choynski. the heavy
weight pugilist, to-day issued the fol
lowing ultimatum in answer to "Kid"
McCoy's announcement that he would
meet the Calif ornian at 162 pounds:
"Joe Choynski will fight "Kid" Mc-
Coy at catch weights at any place and
at any time for a purse of $5000. He will
agree to no particular weight."
Prospects for a meeting between the
two pugilists, therefore, are not very
bright at present. McCoy's first propo
sition to Choynski was a meeting at
158 pounds. He afterward agreed to
allow Choynski to enter the ring at 162
pounds, but Parson Davies will not lis
ten to any proposition limiting the
weight of Choynski.
"Heretofore the question of weight
does not seem to have bothered McCoy
so much," he said to-day. "Now, why
is he so particular in this instance? He
fought Creedon at catch weights, and
Dick O'Brien, and when he promised
me a match with Joe after the Long
Island City match, he said nothing
'bout 162 pounds. "VVe will not agree
Â« pull the fight off at Carson City just
tÂ° please Dan Stuart. That is too far
aw *y. and we won't postpone the
nn J at 'h until next summer either to
pleas, McCoy and Dan Stuart."

BRANDISHED A REVOLVER.
Novel Mear)s Employed by a Berke
ley Landlord to Collect
Rent.
BERKELEY, Dec. 31.â John Hart of
2219 Dana street tried to collect rent
from Mrs- Margaret C. Sullivan and
her son Charles at the point of a re
volver yesterday, and In consequence
the warlike landlord is under $2000
bonds to answer a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon.
Hart was formerly janitor of the
mechanical building at the university.
Yesterday he demanded $48 of the Sul
livans for the premises, 2417 Allston
way. The Sullivans tendered $24,
claiming that was all they owed. Hart
swore that they should pay the $48
before moving a stick of furniture
from the house, but the Sullivans
w^re equally determined and started
to move their belongings. An express
man was called, but when he attempt
ed to move the furniture Hart drew
and began to brandish a revolver. Mrs.
Sullivan immediately set out to secure
a warrant, and soon Hart was arrested
and taken to Jail. Later he secured
his release on bonds to the amount of
$2000, furnished by W. F. Woodsun
and D. O. Kane.
In the meantime Mrs. Sullivan had '
again sent for the expressman, and
the moving proceeded without further
interruption. Hart's case will come up
before Justice Clift next week.

RETIRE FROM
OFFICE SOON
Owing to His Enfeebled
Condition the Secretary
of State Will Leave
the Cabinet.
/
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31.â -Jhe cat was let out of the bag to-day re
garding the future relation? of Secretary of State Sherman with the
administration. Mr. Sherman, it is stated positively, will leave the
Cabinet as soon as the Ohio Legislature definitely decides the Sen
atorship for the coming six years. He will retire whether Hanna wins
or not, giving as a reason his enfeebled condition, making it impos
sible after a long public career to give further service to the coun
try, and recognizing the necessity of giving way to a more active
man to cope with the numerous important foreign problems which
now confront the United States.
It is explained that Secretary Sherman has long contemplated re
tiring, and only remained in the Cabinet on the urgent remon
strance of the President and his advisers against a retirement dur
ing the last few months, which it was feared might be construed un
fortunately and have the effect of antagonizing the powerful Sher
man following in Ohio to the administration.
It was believe.: that the impression would go forth that Sherman
had been forced from the Cabinet, and that his friends would show
resentment at his supposed humiliation by retaliating against Mc-
Kinley's fr: n<f, Mark Hanna. Now that that danger is considered
past, the scheme for Sherman's retirement is no longer concealed.
It is further stated authoritatively that Judge Day will not be pro
moted, but that a new man, not now in official life, will enter the
Cabinet.

BRUSH FORMS
THE ROADBED
Novel Experiment Being
Tried by the Valley
Railway.
Costly Foundation for Its Line
Over Marsh Land Near
Stockton.
Two Layers of Fascines to Be Placed
Before the Gravel Covering
Is Laid.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Dec. 31.â The construc
tion of the Valley Railway's roadbed
from Stockton to Richmond Point be
gan at Old River, under the supervi
sion of Contractor J. D. McDougald.
The bed oÂ£ the road is being laid
in a novel manner, and to some ex
tent the work is experimental. The
spot selected for commencing opera
tions is in the worst stretch of marsh
land between here and Brentwood.
Borings show the depth to solid ground
to be thirty feet. To support the rail
road embankment a bed of brush
seventy-five feet wide will be laid,
and, for the initial work, 500 cubic
yards of brush have been cut. It has
been done up into fascines fifteen in
ches in diameter, and each bundle be
ing bound tightly with wire.
These fascines will be laid as com
pactly together as possible, breaking
joints to make the bed firmer. There
will be two layers of fascines, the top
layer to be covered with a few inches
of earth, when lies and rails will be
laid on it, forming a temporary track.
Over this road bed trains will eventu
ally be run from the vicinity of Brent
wood, hauling sand and gravel for the
permanent embankment. The brush
support is intended to remain perma
nently where it is placed, the earth
hauled in from Brentwood being
dumped on tup of it.
Contractor McDougald left for the
scene <<f operations this morning. He
took down with him on a barge a lot
of earth dredged from Mormon chan
nel in this city, to be used as a cover
ing.
The brush has already been cut on
Old River and bound into fascines.
Twenty-two head of horses and half a
dozen wheel -scrapers to be employed
in taking the earth from the barge to
the brush bed were sent down on the
vessel this morning.
This method of railroad construction
is very costly, as may be judged from
the fact that at the opening of the bids
at Sacramento not long ago for fur
nishing fascines to be used in the work
on the Sacramento River the lowest
bid was 80 cents a cubic yard and the
next lowest $1 10. How much Con
tractor McDougald is to receive from
the Valley road is unknown. The cost,
however, is less than if piles had to be
driven into the marshy ground to sup
port the rails.
Vast quantities of sand and gravel
are obtainable in the vicinity of Brent
wood, and, as the material for the em
bankment is to be obtained from that
side of the Tule basin, it is probable
that the Valley road intends to change
its base of opprations to Brentwood as
soon as th* 1 stretch of roadway begun
to-day is finished. Mr. McDougaM's
'ontracts call for only 100 feet. The
work was evidently begun in the worst
part of thp swamp to make sure that
su< h a roadbed is feasible. As soon as
thla is demonstrated similar work will
be commenrrd on the Brentwnod side
of the basin and continued across the
tules to Ptor-kton, gravel and sand be
ing hauled on the brush as fast as the
fascines are laid.

Are to Be Affected by the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Dec. 31.â The action of the
cotton manufacturers in New Bedford
and Rhode Island in deciding to join
the movement to lower the wage Kale
In January, which was inaugurated
by the big corporations of Fall River,
makes the reduction practically a gen
eral one throughout the New England
States. Cotton mills In Fall River,
Lowell, Manchester, Salem, Suncook,
and a number of smaller places
have already posted notices of a
reduction amounting to from 10 to
11 1-19 per cent. In New Bedford it is
understood the cutdown applies to the
cloth mills only. As far as known the
reduction in aii the mill centers applies
to treasurers, superintendents, over
seers and clt-rks, a* well as to the spin
ners and ether operatives.
PROVIDENCE. K. 1., Dec. 31.â After
delaying their decision to the la*, in
the hope that in the meantime condi
tions might change so as to render the
step unnecessary, the agents of the
leading cotton manufacturing corpora
tions in this State decided to-day to
reduce wages. The cut down will
average about 11 per cent. It will take
effect January 17, and notices to that
effect will be posted next Monday.
J. W. Danielson of the yuinnebag
Company Lockwood Manufacturing
Company and other corporations
with mills In Eastern Connecticut, said
the reduction would also take effect
at his mills on January 17. although
thÂ» amount of the reduction had nut
yet been decided on.
The other Eastern Connecticut cor
porations will take similar action and
mills operaiing about 2000 spindles in
this State, Connecticut and Massachu
setts and the earnings of between 30 -
000 and 35,000 operatives will be af
fected by this decision of the Provi
dence agents.
Colonel R. H. I. Goddard. in discuss
ing the cut-down to-night, said: "I
should have preferred to keep the
wages where they are and run shorter
hours for. say, four months, Afct as
the rest decided to run full Mm ye
shall be obliged to do the sarnfT No
doubt the first action, taken in Fall
River, was largely due to Southern
competition.
'The low wages and the standard of
living, with th-e longer hours there,
make it hard for us to compete with
them. I do not think the cotton manu
facturing business will ever leave New
England for the South but things will
have to equalize themselves."
Robert Knight said: "We have got
to do It to put oursolves on a level
with the other manufacturers. It will
only bring us 10 per <o n t nearer the
Southern manufacturers. This is the
key to the whole situation, and where
to-day the Southern mills are Fold up
and can go on making and selling at
a profit, we are carrying stocks and
when we sell cannot get back a new
dollar for an old one."

Copyright, 1537, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Dec. 31.â General Pando's
campaign in Orient has been brought
to an abrupt halt. Owing to the im
possibility of continuing an aggressive
campaign in default of the receipt of
supplies and munitions, repeatedly de
manded, the general and his staff have
left the scene of operations on Cauto
River for Santiago City, where it is
said there intention is to take ship and
return to Havana to impress upon
making any impression on the rebel
General Blanco the utter futility of
stronghold in the east until the Span
ish forces are re-enforced and supplied
with all essentials to carry on the
campaign.
The Herald's correspondent in Orient
reports that General Pando found the
troops in a deplorable condition. Many
were ill, food was short and the men
were in a condition of general demor
alization. In spite of this he made a
brave effort to carry out offensive
operations, but failed completely. By
h. rr.ic efforts two gunboats forced a
Ift up the river, but the object of
the expedition, to relieve isolated in
land garrisons, was frustrated on ac
count of the activity of numerous
rebel bands and the difficulty of oper
ating in the countiy districts.
It is rumored that Colonel Cepero,
the rebel leader, with fifteen hundred
men, has crossed from Matanzas prov
ince into Havana province to assist
the rebels there.
MADRID, Dec. 31.â The Imparcial
calls upon the Government to "repel
every action of the United States
savoring of intervention in Cuba," and
;i'Hs: 'There exists a widespread
sentiment against the conduct of the
United Sta fÂ», but we do not think
General W< yler is the most acceptable
exponent thereof."
Continuing, the Imparcial criticizes
the Government for stopping tele
grams referring to the general's pro
test to the Queen Regent against the
wording of President McKinley's mes
sage to Congress, and expresses the
opinion that it would have been to the
Government's interest not to hinder its
publication.
The Tiempo is of the opinion that
General Weyler's protest demonstrates
a lack of discipline in the Spanish
army.
General Weyler and other generals
were the guests of Senor Robledo to

this and hint at possible ill results.

the apostolic delegate, Mgr. Sebastian
Martinelli, by the citizens of St. Paul
i in the Ryan Hotel. An address of wel
come was read to him by the Hon.
Daniel W. Lawler.
Mgr. Martimlli in response spoke at
considerable length. After referring to
the Pope's recent encyclical letters on
marriage, on the constitution of civil
society, on the labor question, and
other great problems and questions of
the day, he stated that the Pope
strives to promote the prosperity and
welfare of society, as well as of the na
tion, pointing out the means to be used
for attaining that end, and indicating
the evils which lead to its destruction
or ruin. Thei^ whs no need he said,
for him to speak of the Pope's love for
the United States or its institutions
nor the interest he takes in the pros
perity, nor of the hope he entertains
of its future.
In conclusion he paid a warm tribute
to Archbishop Ireland. â¢

The San Francisco Scottish Thistle

"Hogmanay party" last evening in
Laurel Hall of the Shiels building, 32
OFarrell street. "A Guid NfW Year
to Ane and A' " -was their motto, and
they upheld it by having a good, old
fashioned social time, such as would
have delighted the heart of a High

The grand march for the dance began
at 8:30 p. m., and dancing wasjkept up
until 11:30 o'clock, when all adjourned
to the banquet hall and gave the inner
man a chance to start on the new year
with a full stock.
The dances were interspersed with an
impromptu literary programme, in
which the members were assisted by
the Militia male quartet. J. Hill was
the chairman of the reception commit
tee, and W. Grunt acted as floor man
ager.

BOSTON, Dec. 31.â When the case of
John Reed, the notorious confidence
man, charged with innumerable bunko
Rames all over rural New England,
came up in the Police Court in Lowell,
Mass., this morning, the defendant
failed to appear. This is his second
default.
Accordingly Reed's bond was de
clared defaulted by the court, and
there is a certified check for $7000 in
the Prescott National Bank from Bail
Commissioner W. B. Thompson of
Cambridge to satisfy the wounded dig
nity of the law. The disposition of the
money will be made by the Superior
Court, and Farmer Charles Sweetser
hopes to get back what he lost, as
George F. Penniman did some seven or
eight years ago, the money he invested
in a bogus gold brick
This is the climax In the remarkable
case of a mysterious unknown bunko
man backed by unlimited capital. The
authorities have no doubt now that
Reed has deliberately jumped his bail,
or that the bail arrangements were
made deliberately with the view of
paying cash down what the court de
manded for his liberation. This was
the first assignment for trial due him
since he was bailed in Brockton and
settles the point as to his intentional
absence. Had he appeared here proba
ble cause would undoubtedly have
been found and he would have been
ordered to the Grand Jury, possibly in
increased bonds, a fact which partially
explains the hustling movement his
friends got on to go the rounds of the
places where complaints were pending
and put up the money and permit him
to get away before the court got down
to work on his case in real earnest.
Charles Sweetser, who was the victim
of Reed and a fellow who insisted on
calling himself "Tennessee Sam," and
nothing more, was in court this morn
ing with his two sons. Mr. Sweetser
is not very communicative about the
case.
' That's the last we will see of Mr.
Peed, I guess," said he this morning
n-hen the case had been disposed of.
Mr. Sweetser lost $3500 to Reed.
The non-appearance of Reed was not
a surprise to any one, as it was an
open secret that after he had been
taken to Boston from Brockton, where
he was last arrested, he had been again
liberated from the Sheriff's custody by
a neat legal trick and had left for
parts unknown. Reed, up to the time
of his departure, hail deposited as bail
for his appearance at Cambridge.
Clinton, Brockton and Lowell a total
amount of $31,500. It is now an ac
cepted fact that this large amount was
virtually paid as the price of his lib
erty, and now that he has gone there
is little chance of his appearing at any
of the other cities or towns to answer
to the charges against him. Farmer
Martin Wood has just received the fol
lowing letter from Reed:
"Martin Wood, the Gambler: How
much will you take now to settle the
Reed case? There will be some more
gamblers after you. The money you
gave the detectives helped to bail out
John Reed. They are all partners.
When they trap a soft thing like you
they give your name to their partners
and they come around and take an
other fall out of you. For sporting you
won't do. SLIPPY IKE.
'Tare Klondike. Ha! ha!"
After losing his $4500 Wood paid a de
tective $300 to find Reed for him. The
detective was one of the gang.

The Society of California Piorjeers
Give a New Year's Eve
Reception.
The old year was bidden farewell and
the New Tear welcomed in by an in
formal reception given by the Society
of California Pioneers at their hall last
evening.
Dancing, interspersed with a musical
and literary programme, was the en
tertainment offered the members of the
society and their families, and the
amusement was kept up till the year
IS9B was several hours advanced. A
few minutes before midnight the floor
master announced the lancers as the
dance, and at the stroke of 12 the musio
struck up and with numerous "Happy
New Years" the dance began. Stately
gentlemen led their daughters through
the mystic mazes of the old-fashioned
dances, while silver-haired mothers
were guided by their sons, and the
elders were as sprightly and graceful
as the youngsters.
Blanchard's orchestra furnished the
music for the dancers, and Misses
Florence Fairchild, Nellie Bowlin and
Lulu Flemming furnished the musical
and literary entertainment.

GENERAL SIR HENRY HAVELOCK-ALLAN.
CALCUTTA, Dec. 31.â The mutilated body of General Sir Henry
Havelock-Allan, it is announced from Ali Musjid, has been found and is J
being conveyed to Peshawur. /
Sir Henry Havelock-Allan left his command the day before yester- '
day, and when he did not reappear a search was organized. It resulted
in the finding of his horse, stripped and shot, with Sir Henry missing. It
was then feared that the distinguished officer had been killed, which the
late discovery proves to have been the case.
It appears that after visiting Lundi-Kotal Sir Henry Havelock-Allan,
coming from Ali Musjid with an inadequate escort, left the latter in order
to hurry to Jamrud. Sir Henry was always prone to take rash chances.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. 31.â Ballard, the
lumber and shingle mill suburb of this
city, was the scene this evening of a
double tragedy that is shrouded in
considerable mystery. The shooting
occurred shortly before 7 o'clock and
was probably participated in by sev
eral men who were seen running away
from Charles Ross' saloon, in which
the affray occurred.
Mrs. Ross, startled by hearing four
pistol sh^ts in rapid succession, rushed
Into the saloon and there witnessed a
ghestly sight. Her husband was lying
behind the bar, blood streaming from
a bullet hole in his forehead.
On the other side of the bar was a
stranger, almost in the last gasp of
breath, as a result of a bullet wound
beneath his left eye. As the distracted
wife bent over the prostrate form of
her husband he raised his head, say
ing:
"They tried to rob me."
He then fell into a state of uncon
sciousness, from which, it is supposed,
he will never recover.
The stranger is supposed to have
come from Montana, His real name is
unknown, although for several days he
has been begging around Ballard.* He
died fifteen minutes after the shooting
occurred.
The authorities have been at work
on the case, but as yet have not been
able to locate any of the living par
ticipants to what they consider was an
attempt to rob Ross but ended in a
tragedy. Ross is a German about 50
years of age. It is supposed that the
bullet from his revolver ended the life
of his probable murderer. The latter
fired but one shot, indicating that two
others were fired by his fleeing confed
erates. At the hour when the shooting
occurred but few people were in the
neighborhood, although a crowd soon
collected. Ross was brought to the
hospital, but the physicians have little
hope of his recovery.

Roadmaster William Garliepp of
Mountain View and other exposes
made by The Call are worthy subjects
for their consideration.
PENTECOST CHURCH.
Rev. O. C. Miller's Little Flock. Cel
ebrate Christmas With Song
ar>d Music.
The little church on Jackson street,
between Laguna and Buchanan, known
as the Church of the Holy Spirit, of
which the Rev. O. C. Miller is the pas
tor, belongs to the Evangelical Luther
an branch of the English sect. In ad
dition to the tenets of this particular
sect being expounded by the pastor to
his usual Sunday congregation, he has
attached to his charge the Pentecost
mission, in which a diversity of in
structions are imparted, to not only
adults, but also to numerous tots rang
ing from 4to 16 years of age. There is
also a sewing school attached to the
mission located at the corner of Leav
enworth and Pacific streets, where girls
who have been neglected in their home
lives are taught the useful branch of
needle-work. The material is furnished
by the mission, and, as an inducement
to the girls, they are permitted to take
home that which they make into gar
ments.
It was these girls and the little chil
dren of the mission who so befittingly
celebrated Christmas week in the
church and at the mission.
During the earlier evenings of the
week the church on Jackson street held
its Christmas celebration. At this ob
servance the indefatigable minister
was not forgotten by the members of
his congregation, as Santa Claua
found, among the many good things, a
purse well filled with gold, which waa
labeled for the minister. The celebra
tion yesterday afternoon and evening
was for the smaller children of the
mission in the afternoon and the larger
ones in the evening. At the afternoon
entertainment there were over 160 tots
from the summit of Russian Hill and
portions of Pacific street.
The evening exercises were for thÂ©
larger children and the sewing class
belonging to the Pentecost Church and
mission. At this meeting there were
present over 300, all of whom enjoyed
the programme prepared for them by
the minister and the ladies who so
kindly assisted him.
The usual Christmas tree was there,
as also a present for each child. Rev.
Mr. Miller's popularity among the
members of his congregation, large and
small, was made manifest during the
past week by the courteous and kindly
manner in which they flocked about
him to wish him a happy New Year.

afternoon a football match will be
played by the Olympic lightweight
eleven, formerly the Y. M. C. A. light
weight championship team, and the
Green C eleven, formerly the champion
team of the League of the Cross Ca
dets. The latter players will have an
advantage of about twenty pounds to
the man in weight, but the light
weights, in addition to a remarkable
three years' record of victories, have
this season scored as follows: Six to
Army and Navy 6, 6 to Stanford fresh
men 4, 0 to California Freshmen 6, 10
to Petaluma Athletic Club 0, 19 to Im
perial Athletic Club 0, 4 to Centerville

will meet the Centerville Athletic Clvb 1
in their second game of the series for i
the football lightweight championship
of the State, each team weighing, ac
cording to agreement, not over 140
pounds on an average to the player. En

SAX DIEGO. Dec. 31.â The steamer
Albion, which arrived this morning
from the lower Mexican coast, brings
the story of the man-of-war Demo
cratas 1 trip to Clipperton Island to in
vestigate the alleged seizure of the
island by the British. Instead of find
ing Britishers in possession of the
island the American flag was found
flying- gayly there, and the incident
raised, if any, was between the United
States and Mexico instead of between
Mexico and Great Britain. The Demo
cratas landed a few marines and dis
placed the American flag with the tri
colored banner of Mexico, with her eagle
standing on an uncomfortable footing
of cactus barbs while swallowing a ser
pent. But there was no bloodshed, and
the guano poachers there acquiesced
without any spread of jingoism. A
passenger on the Albion tells the story
as follows:
"On our return we took on a sailor
at Acapulco, and from him I learned
that he had been brought to that port
by the Mexican gunboat Democratas
from Clipperton Island. He. with two
other men, had been employed by a
guano company to take charge of about
4000 tons of guano that was stored in
the warehouses on the island, and
when they were landed there some
nine months ago they hoisted the
American flag and notified the Secre
tary of State of their actions.
"On December 14 the Democratas
dropped anchor a short distance from
the island and Bent a boat's crew of
marines to the island. On attempting
to land the boat was dashed against a
coral reef and suffered considerable
damage. Fmally the marines were
landed, and, after an official ceremony,
the stars and stripes were hauled
down from the flagpole that had been
erected by Americans and in its place
the Mexican flag was hoisted. Having
taken formal possession or the island,
the marines withdrew and notified the
man who remained on the island not to
allow any one to take away the guano
under penalty of imprisonment under
the Mexican laws.
"The island is about 800 miles off the
Mexican coast, almost due west of
Acapulco. and is known as an atoll or
coral reef. It is about four miles in
circumference, with a large sized lake
in the center. Two palm trees con
stitute the sole vegetation of the is
land, which is made the home of mil
lions of sea fowls. Thousands of ton.-*
of the richest guano is to be gathered
on the island, and this represents its
sole worth apart from the value of the
coral.
â¢When the marines landed to take
possession of the island on behalf of
Mexico they were fully armed and
prepared to do battle with whatever
resistance might be offered."

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 1, 1898.
MYSTERY STILL VEILS THE SONOMA SUICIDE.
SONOMA, Dec. 31.â Word has been received from Coroner Young that
the undertaker who has the contract to bury all indigents for the county will
be here to-morrow and take the remains of Suicide Johnson to Santa Rosa
for interment. The affair still remains a mystery and is the topic of conver
sation upon the streets. The idea that at some time Johnson was a prominent
man has not been relinquished. His education, dress and manners justify this
belief. His clothes were of tailor-make, but no marks upon them can be
found to lead to his identity. It is rumored that at one time he was in the
employ of the Government in the secret service.
It was reported that Sheriff Sam I. Allen could throw some light on this
belief, but no report has been received on this subject from the Coroner, who
was to interview the Sheriff at Santa Rosa. The officials were wired to-day
from Chief Lees of San Francisco for information, but nothing could be given
that would lead to a clew.

His Skull.
Special Dlipatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Dec. 31.â Harry Hes
sey, who escaped from the Clackamas
County Jail, was shot and istantly
killed at The Dalles at 4 o'clock this
afternoon by Night Watchman Julius
Wiley and acting Deputy Sheriff Wil
liam Spencer.
Hessey and Frank Williams met at
Troutdale and tramped it to The
Dalles, reaching there yesterday morn
ing. From the conversation of his
companion Williams became convinced
that he was the man who escaped
on Sunday night from the Clackamas
County Jail, and last night Williams
informed a policeman of his suspicions
and asked if a reward was offered. A
telegram was sent to the Clackamas
County Sheriff, and the description re
turned tallied with that of Williams'
companion.
This afternoon Officer Wiley, Coro
ner Butts and William Spencer start
ed for the east end of town, where
Hessey and Williams were camped.
Just beyond the Wasco warehouse the
officers came upon the men, and after
some short parleying -ordered Hessey
to throw up his hands. Hessey imme
diately drew his revolver and leveled
it at Coroner Butts, but before he
fcould discharge the weapon Wiley and
Spencer both shot, and the Jailbird fell
to the ground dead, with a bullet-hole
near each temple.
In his pocket were found a mask
and other articles of disguise. Hessey
was wanted for robbery in Woodburn.
No blame can be attached to the offi
cers, as every act of Hessey showed
that he was desperate, and that he
meant to sell his liberty dearly. A re
ward of $40 had been offered for his
capture.
LIFE WENT OUT

An Unknown Woman Killed
by an Electric Car on
Kearny Street.
She Fell on the Track and the Motor
man Was Unable to Prevent
the Accident.
Mrs. Rose Kenness, wife of William
Kenness, a baker, was run over and
killed at the corner of Jackson and
K< urny streets by Mission car 1176
southbound about 9 o'clock last even
ing.
When she was f taken up by the
policeman she was found to be stili
alive, and the patrol-wagon was called
to take her to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital, but she died before it was
reached. Her body was badly crushed,
and death probably resulted from in
ternal injuries. There were also some
ugly bruises on the head.
Â»'. L. Skelley, the mntnrman, was ar
rested and booked at the Central police
station on the charge of manslaughter.
Skelley's account of the accident is
corroborated by Frank Kennedy, living
at 807 Folpnm street, who whs stand
ing near the woman when she was
struck. According to Umm two m. n
there was another car going north
Just before the BfloMtÃt, and, after it
had ptMd, the woman made an at
tempt to cross, and full directly in front
of Skolley's car. When he saw her ly
ing on the track the niotorman re
versed the car, but was unable to stop
it before the woman was struck. The
reversal of the lever prevented
the car passing over the body, but the
front wheels struck the woman and in
ilicted the injuries which caused her
death.

Thirteen Heavily Laden Freight
Cars Pass Over the Young
Man's Body.
Distressing Accident Occurring at
Night on the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway.
Special DlFpatch to Tfce Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 31.â John Con
boy, a brakeman on the San Francisco
and North Pacific Coast Railway, met
a frightful death this morning at
about 4 o'clock. Thirteen heavily laden
fn-ight cars passed over his body,
crushing the bones and tearing the
flesh into shreds.
Conb-jy was employed as an extra
brakeman by the railroad company,
and his home was in Petaluma, He
was only a lad, not having yet reached
the age of 10, and th<: manner in which
he came to his death while In the per
formance of his duty wus sad in the
extreme. The brakeman was wit!. En
gineer Donohue and Conductor Cum
mings, and had charge of the thirteen
cars which passed over his body. Just
before reaching San Rafael a hill is
encountered.
Owing to the heavy train last night,
it was cut into two .sections, as is cus
tomary when the hill is reached and
the engine shoved the first section ol
thirteen cars to the top of the grade.
Then the cars were allowed to descend
the other side by gravity, while the en
gine went back after the second sec
tion.
Brakeman Conboy was given charge
of the first section. The night v.as dark
and foggy and cold, and it was while
the cars were going down the grade
that he met his death. No one naw the
accident, but the supposition is that
Conbay, after cutting the engine off,
and while the cars wÂ±r.> going down the
grade, climbed to the top of the cars
and walked over the roofs toward the
first car. In the darkness and fog he
My stepped off the first car, think
ing there was another one ahead of
him, and that he plunged down upon
the track, while the cars, one by tme,
passed over his body.
When the seron-1 section came r.long
Conboy'i lifeless body was found lying
beside the track.
Oonboy was well liked by the em
ployes of the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railway. The funeral will take
place in Potaluma.

BOSTON, Dec. 31.â More arrests are

murder case. Herman Sach has been
acquitted of shooting Bertram Hotch
kiss, the KlUlngworth game warden,
but who did the deed?
The State of Connecticut will inves
tigate Btill further. Sach gave to-day
one of the most sensational statements
ever made in a murder case. It is sub
stantially as follows:
"Early last spring I went to work
for Bertram Hotchkiss and worked
there about five months, and left
him early in August. At three differ
ent times his wife asked me to kill her
husband for her. and I told her if she
asked me again I would give her away.
Bhe told me Mr. Hubbard sent out
some poison to poison skunks and
woodcocks that were stealing his
birds. After I left there she told me
she had the poison in the house still
One day in the latter part of July I
went down there to her house. When
I got to the door, I saw Bert Hotch
kiss, and he asked me if I would drive
up to the doctors for him. I then went
down to the barn to hitch up his horse
He could not walk.
He wanted me to go to Darien for Dr
Markham. When I went down to hitch
up the horse his wife came down and
told me not to hurry ur dr-ve fast I
said: -What's the matter? 1 She said:
I will tell you when you come back â 
I drove as fast as I could, however to
Dr. Jlarkham's. The doctor hitched up
his own horse and tame down after me
\\ hen the doctor had gone she said she
had given Bert that which the doctor
could not find out.
. 'â¢"What did you do?' I asked. She
said: -I nut poison in his coffee at
breakfast.' I went home the next morn
ing. Before I went home she said to
me: 'I will fix him next time; he will
not see the poison in his coffee again.'
Afterward, when I went there again,
she/jtojd me she had given him the
polaqfc again in ginger tea, but he
would not take it. I went up to work
for Hoffmann after this, and every time
I passed the house and Bert was away
she would call me in. A few days be
fore Bert was shot she asked me if I
would kill him. I told her I would not.
I worked for Hoffmann all day August
27, the day of the , murder, until ten
minutes past 5 in the afternoon. Then
I went down toward my home."
LESSONS TAUGHT BY TIME.
Impressive Serrrjon by flrcrjbishop
Riordan at St. Mary's Cathe
dral.
A New Year's eve vesper and bene
diction service was held last night at
St. Mary's Cathedral, on Van Ness
avenue. After the singing of the ves
pers, "Adeste Fideles," "Magnificat"
and "Emitte Spiritum" by the choir
and a quartet, the Most Rev. Arch
bishop Riordan delivtred an impres
sive sermon on the New Year and the
thoughts it should bring with it. He
said that the old year was one of the
resting-places in the journey of life.
He said that it was the duty of all to
look over the year that had passed
and see if. the pages were not marked
with deeds and acts that might have
been better performed. He urged that
profiting by the experience of the past
every one should have clean pages in
their life history when the year now
dawning was ended. "It was a timo
for earnest thinking," said he, "aud we
n<nv stand on the bank of the river of
life and see time bearing every
thing before us. The New Year is a
time for solemn thought. Let us all
profit by the past and lead lives that
will insure us peace and rest when we
reach the next milestone in our jour
nÂ»y. Let us be sorrowful for the mis
takes of the past and hopeful for the
future."
The services concluded with benedic
tion and the singing of the "Te Deum"
by the congregation.

BOSTON, Dec. 31.â T0-day The Call
correspondent met the warm, cordial
smile of Secretary John D. Long, home
for a flying visit, only to wind up the
holiday recess. He returns immediate
ly to Washington. Referring to the
matter of the Charlestown navy yard,
involving Major Meade and the post
tradership and the succession of the
command of Major Pope of Mare
Island, the secretary said:
"In respect to the matter the depart
ment acted with the utmost considera
tion and care, and with sole regard to
the interests of the service."
The conversation was given a fresh
query as to how the new change in the
navy personnel, contemplated In As
sistant Secretary Roosevelt's report,
the synopsis of which in the morning
papers aroused at once so keen an
intrest among resident naval officers.
"Mr. Roosevelt is to be much con
gratulated upon the force and excel
lence of his report," said Secretary
Long. "His service in the matter is
illustrative of the man and a perfect
answer to those who predicted that he
would be an impracticable assistant. I
was asked to-day if it was true that
there had been differences of opinion
between Mr. Roosevelt and myself.
"I was happy to answer that there
had been a great many, and. that it
would argue that we were a pair of
chuckle-heads if there had been none.
These differences have always been
settled by discussion, and strange to
say, where Roosevelt has been right
I have given in and where I've been

thing has gone along with a harmony
and smoothness and a common shoul

of their families are at stake. Hitherto
all attempts at an agreement as to a
reorganization have failed. In this in
stance a large board, representing line
and staff, age and youth, conservative
and radical, was appointed, and Mr.
Roosevelt put at the head of it. bo far
from showing impracticability, he has
presided over the board with such dis
cretion and ease and good sense that
the result, although covering different,
delicate and important questions of
personnel, is practically unanimous.
â¢The three great objects sought
wei-e: Firstâ The consolidation of the
line and engineer corps, the time hav
ing now come when the captain of a
ship must be familiar with the engines
which are its motive power, ju?t as old
Isaac Hull was just as good a sailor in
the rigglQC as he was a fighter at the
gun* Secondâ The quicker flow of pro
motion and the bringing to the top of
the best deserved and the highest
merit, and third, the introduction of
the machinist as a warrant officer, the
time having come, with the immense
amount of engineers Aboard the ship,
Mhen those who have their hand di
rectly upon the lever should he thor
oughly competent for their duties.
"The bill is now in my hands for re
viaion, and then to be transmitted to
Congress. I am heartily in sympathy
with its purpose and general effect,
although there are some minor matters
of detail which I held for further con
sideration.
â¢â¢The only risk the bill will encounter
is, in my judgment, the increase of the
cost, which Mr. Roosevelt estimates at
something like half a million dollars.
"As to this it is to be said that it
only gives naval officers the same pay
which is now nriven to officers of the
army and marine corps; nor is half a
million dollars a very large increase to
pay for active present service when we
are paying $150,000,000 a year* for serv
ices rendered a third of a century ago.
But in all these points I commend you
to a careful reading of Mr. Roosevelt'U
report. For vigor of statement, clear
ness of presentation and earnest en
thusiastic devotion to the service in
which he is engaged it is a splendid
performance."
THE SCHEME FAILED.
Turner, the Convicted Real Estate
Agent, Wants Frenna Arrested.
J. B. Turner, the real estate agent
who was recently sentenced to eight
years in San Quentin, tried hard yes
terday to outwit J. P. Frenna, the com
plaining witness against him.
Turner has obtained a writ of proba
ble cause, and it will come up for argu
ment on Monday. Meantime he is out
on bonds.
Yesterday, accompanied by Attorney
George D. Collins, he called upon As
sistant Prosecuting Attorney Mann of
Judge Campbell's court and presented
a warrant for Frenna's arrest for
threats to kill. Mann's indorsement was
wanted to the warrant, and, he says,
he was led to believe that the trouble
was about a civil suit that would come
up for hearing on Monday. Nothing
was said a"bout the writ of probable
cause.
Mann ascertained that Turner had
attempted to get Judge Conlan to sign
the warrant, and he went to him and
learned why he had refused to sign it.
Mann was angry, and freely spoke
his mind to Turner, when he (irmly told
him that he would not indorse the war
rant, as he believed it was simply a
scheme to get Frenna arrested so that
he could not testify Monday.WHAT DID

Then there is another matter .upon
which there might have been a little
enlightenment and that is whether Mr.
Mills remembers the Salvation Army in
his prayers, or; in fact, whether he
prays or not. :..;â '"â 
All these questions were directly, ask
ed by Major Winchell, and as to., the;
manner of the asking and the wording
of the replies there is a divergence of
opinion that is surprising when the
well known characteristics of the two
men involved in the altercation â rather
controversy â is remembered.
Both ayrre--' as to the questions asked.
The divergence of recollection comes in
on the latter part of the interview.
Major Winehell is certain that his
manner was suave and mild; that there
was none of the church militant about
him. He admits that there was con
ible of the "fortiter in re" in his
"suaviier in modo." but he insists that
he broached the delicate subject in a
manner that was entirely unobjection
able â that is, if such questions could
be unobjectionable to a man of Mr.
Mills' well known temperament.
On the other hand, Mr. Mills is equal
ly certain that he treated the major
â with all the deference due to one of so
exalted standing, and was even cour
teous to a degree that is beyond his
usual wont. True, according to Mr.
Mills, the language and manner of the
military man were not exactly what
one might expect from a commander
in the army of the Lord, yet the astute
and mild-mannered railroad man re
trained himself â actually held back
that flow of language for which he is
noted in letter writingâ and gave cour
teous answers to all the questions that
asked. Perhaps his answers were
not exactly full of the information de
sired by the major, but they were an
swers and that should have satisfied
the military man.
It has always been a matter of -won
der that two men shouid so widely di
verge in recollections as to tell dia
metrically opjc site stories regarding
matters In which both are deeply inter
ested, but The world is full of instances
in kind, hence the present difference
between M- WibcheU and Mr. Mills
should not arouse 'â¢â¢â¢"onderment.
According to Major Winchell he vis
ited Mr. Mil with the avowed and
fixed determination to learn from that
gentleman's Up 8 whether or not
he, Mills, wa.- spona/ble for the edi
torial in the P .-â¢ and also whether or
not the Souther;. Pacific Railroad own
ed the Post. Ma Winchell Is not the
lirst man who has had a yearning to
have these gui solved, but like
all predecessors he is still in the dark
so far as direct i'::,rmat:on is con
cerned, but in his o, n mini he firmly
believes that Mr. Mills, by his manner
and tone of negation, :. ;i lly .lid mean
to affirm and acknowledge th< soft im
peachment. If the wort of the major
is to be taken in this verity 'contro
versy, then the manner of Mx Mills
was anything but genti-manjy, an <j
the major had occasion t., so ii nnormn f orm
the railroad man before living. Yet
by his own acknowledge . n t Win
chell confessed that he ti ]? h t tne
head of the land departm* : o f lne
railroad was a good man, for on lie
parting from the interview he ask-d
for the prayers of Mr. Millsâ j,rnidii,g
Mr. Mills was a praying man.
It is of record that Mr. Milis j s a
praying man. But probably he does
not consider that the Salvation Army
belongs to that same class of Christ
ians as compose the church to Which
Mr. Bryan belongs. It will be ren in
hered in his letter to a certain up-cvun
try editor regarding a certain j>,i ss
upon which Mr. Bryan is said to fakve
ridden, that Mr. Mills spoke glowin?. .
Df the "aristocratic" membership of Ms
church. The Salvation Army does ny
go much on its aristocracy and pro>>
ably herein may lie the key to tbn
â¢whole situation as regards the differ
ence between these two estimable gen
tlemen.
Mr. Mills avers that when he was
called upon by Major Winchell he
treated the gentleman with all due de
ference, and notwithstanding the ab
rupt and even harsh manner of ap
proach on the part of the visitor, he
demeaned himself in a most forbearing
manner and even soothed the ruffled
feelings of the major to such an ex
tent that upon the close of the interest
ins meeting the major was so far con
vinced of the great goodness of the
man upon whom he first looked as an
adversary, that he besought his pray
ers for thp welfare of the army in its
present work.
On this point, as well as on the tenor
of the questions asked, there is no dif
ference of opinion between the two
gentlemen, but as regards the subject
matter of the intervening time there is
a broad chasm.
Winchell says that Mills tacitly
admitted that the Southern Pacific
road owns the Post, and that he
(Mills) wrote the editorial in ques
tion.
On the other hand, Mills states that
he told Winchell that Ms questions
â were of a nature that should not be
answered, and that he informed him
positively that the Po*t did not be
long to the railroad, Vut to the man
who was the ostensible head of the
paper.
There the matter nrust rest.
In railroad and Sjrtvation Army cir
cles these question* must take rank
! with the one whici agitates theatrical
circles regarding the exact punishment
inflicted upon G2a.dys Wallace by T.
Daniel Frawley. . : â¢ '.' f' ..â¢
Whether the major was blustering
and militant as is averred by Mr. Mills,
1 or whether. tie railroad man started.
i to throw the major out, as is averred
by WincheM, must forever be an open
question that will go down the ages
alongside jf that other questionâ who
I owns the Post: and who writes Its edi

The annual reorganization of the
Board of Education, which includes
the election of the president and the
changing of the committees as the ex
periences gained during the past year

t ernoon next at a meeting that has

The law requires that such metting

and that the president during the
month shall announce the committees
for the ensuing twelve months.
The reorganization that is to take
place will be such in name only; as the
only changes that will be made will
be in the chairmanship of one or two
of the committees.
President Harrington is believed by
all to be the proper presiding officer
for the board and will be re-elected
without opposition. The only real con
test that is now going on is in regard
to the chairmanship of the committee
on Supplies, now held by Director

ited the prison, but was unable to iden
tify the suspect.
"He is not the right man," replied
the junk-dealer, as he carefully sur
veyed the prisoner. "I could not be
mistaken." The Chinaman then re
marked that the robber was a trifle
taller than the suspect and wore dif
ferent clothes. He is positive he can
identify him if he is arrested.
Several storekeepers in the virinlty
of the junkshop also got a good look at
the robber. Before entering the place
he looked around, evidently to see
whether a policeman was in sight.
Their description given of him tallies
exactly with that given by the junk

DURRANT LOSES
THREE POINTS
Federal Courts Do Not
Hear a Habeas Cor

The Supreme Court Refuses to
Issue a Writ of Probable
Cause.
How Attorney Boardman Missed See
ing Judge de Haven â Grounds
of the, Petition.
It now appears more probable than
ever that the case of Durrant, "the
criminal of the century," will see its
end next Friday when the condemned
man is sentenced to expiate his crimes
; by the rope within the gloomy walls
jof San Quentin Prison. Not only did
! the Supreme Court deny the applica
â¢ tion by his attorneys for a writ of
i probable cause yesterday, but the
U.. S. Circuit Court, Judge Hawley
presiding, refused to entertain the
I reading of a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus, and Judge de Haven
of the United States District Court
avoided consideration of the question
by adjourning court at a time when
Attorney Boardman was busily en
gaged in the United States Marshal's
office. ' *. â ';â¢'.'
At 11 a. m. Attorneys Deuprey and
Boardman walked into the Circuit
Court room. Only Judge Hawley, the
clerk and the bailiff were present in
addition to the attorneys. : Acting, as
spokesman, Deuprey said: :â¢*"â¢â¢ '
"If your Honor please, we have here
a petition for a writ of habeas cor
pus in Durrant's case which we would
like to have you consider." â  'â .
Judge Hawley said that he would
not listen to the matter on account
of the fact that he was not familiar
with the case and had made prepara
tion to leave town at once. Boardman
; then tried his hand at persuasion,
i with no better result, except that
' Judge Hawley consented to leave
court open until the afternoon, with
the expectation that Judge Morrow
! would make his appearance.
At 1 p. m. Judge Morrow had not
appeared, and the bailiff, acting under
instructions, wanted to close the court
room, but Marshal Baldwin waited
with the attorneys until 1:15 p. m.
No Judge appearing court then stood
adjourned until next Monday morning
at 11 o'clock. Judge Hawlev had con
sented previously to an understanding
that the application had been formally
presented.
The next resort of the attorneys for
the condemned man was to the Dis
trict Court. The manner in which
they failed to get the petition heard
then is interesting, to say the least.
Attorney Boardman learned from the
bailiff that Judge de Haven would ap-
I" ;n in all probability in the court
room at 3 p. m. Accordingly he laid
all his papers down on the desk and
retired into the room of the United
States Marshal, across the hallway.
He was there busily engaged in tele
phoning when Judge de Haven walked
into the court and took his seat.
"Is there any case to be brought to
the attention of the court to-day?"
he inquired of the bailiff. On receiv
ing thf answer that the book was
blank he remarked:
"The court will then stand adjourn
ed until n^xt Monday at 11 a. m."
With those woids the Judge made
his exit from the room, and it was
closed to intruders by the bailiff. At
ten minutes before the hour Attorney
Boardman started for the courtroom.
He was met in the hallway and assured
that the court had adjourned. His
surprise and bewilderment were evi
dent, but he lost no time in leaving for
General Dickinson's office as soon as
the bailiff had unlocked the door and
permitted him to regain possession of
his papers.
The application for a writ of habeas
corpus was based upon the facts that
Judges Morrow and De Haven had re
fused even to file a petition for a writ
of "habeas corpus, the contention being
that the law gives the right of appeal
from a refusal to issue such a writ,
and further. th:it an appeal is pending
before the United States Supreme Court
arid the Supreme Court of the State.
These were the principal points made
in the document.
The Justices of the Supreme Court
yesterday denied the application of
â  Durrant for a certificate of probable
cause, the denial being signed by Chief
Justice Beatty and Justices Van Fleet,
M< Farland. Henshaw and Temple.
; Thus is shattered what is believed to
be the last hope of the murderer to
1 stave off the fatal day, January 7, on
which, according to the sentence of Su
perior Judge Bahrs, he must be hanged.
In the petition settled by this dcci-
sion the petitioner assailed the Juris
diction of Judge Bahrs, holding that
he had no right to pass sentence while
there was an appeal still pending in
the Supreme Court of the United
States. This assumption was based on
the fact that shortly after the former
appeal was decided by the highest tri
bunal Durrant was taken before the
Superior Judge, who passed the death
sentence before the remltiitur of that
court arrived in the Federal court in
this city. The defendant's attorneys
made an attempt to get out a writ of
habeas corpus, which Federal Judges
Morrow and De Haven refused to is
sue, and Judge Morrow directed the
clerk of the court to refuse to accept or
file the documents in an appeal from
this decision. The prisoner's attorneys
clnirrW that that appeal existed,
whether the clerk accepted or filed the
papers or not, and that while this al
leged appeal existed the Judge of the
Superior Court had no jurisdiction.

has been a prisoner his mother was not

! Mrs. Durrant remained at the death
chamber for about an hour. She com
plained at not being able to greet her
son in the usual way, and told the
guards that she and her husband had
planned to bring over a New Year din
ner to the prison, and the three would
enjoy it together. She was told that it
would do her no good to bring it, as
her son would not be allowed outside
the cell, and she could get no nearer
him than she was to-day. Mrs. Dur
rant said she still had hopes of keep
ing her son from the gallows, but she
said it with a despairing sigh.
Durrant chatted with his guards all
day long in the same unconcerned way.
He reviewed some of the evidence that
was given in his trial, and told of dis

has hopes that he will not be led to the

FORTNICHTLY STEAMERS.
Change of Schedule by Oceanic
Steamship Compaoy That Will
Benefit Australia.
A decided change in the time-table
is soon to be made by the Oceanic
Steamship Company plying between
San Francisco and Sydney and touch
ing en route at Honolulu, Apia and
Auckland. The steamship Mariposa,
that was to have sailed from here on
March 3. will, by inauguration of the
new schedule, leave here on February
24. And all succeeding sailing days of
other boats of this line will be simi
larly adjusted to the new arrangement.
The new plan will make it possible for
the steamers leaving here to carry
European mails brought to New York
by the fast Campania in time to catch
the Australian steamer here and make
close .connections.
The proposed change of schedule is
most effective at the Australian end of
the line, where for a long time the
Oceanic Steamship Company and its
competitors, the Canadian-Australian
line, running from Sydney by way of
Wellington, New Zealand, Fiji Islands
and Horfolulu to Vancouver, has had
sailing days that coincided, that were
close' together or that were otherwise
variable as competition dictated. The
Australian Government has recently,
however, made such regulations with
respect to the Canadian-Australian
line that hereafter the sailing days of
that company's steamships will be
every twenty-eight days, alternating
every two weeks with the Oceanic
Company's steamers. Thus there will
be established from Sydney and from
New Zealand a regular fortnightly
steamship service with the Pacific
Coast of North America, By this new
plan there will be fewer conflicts, less
injurious competition and for Austra
lia a much more satisfactory service
The course of the Oceanic Steamship
Company's line from Sydney to San
Francisco is 7210 miles. The com
pany's steamers are the Moana, Ala
meda and Mariposa.
The course of the Canadian-Austra
lian line's steamers, the Warrimoo
Miowera and Aorangi, from Sydney to
Vancouver, is about 7600 miles in
length.
TWO BAD SMALL BOYS.

TaKe a Horse and Buggy.
George Jones, 13 years of age. and
George Bird, 11, were arrested yester
day afternoon by Policeman O. Gorman
on the charge of driving off with a
horse and buggy without the consent of
the owner.
Joshua Hendy left his horse and
bupgy yesterday morning in front of
the Mechanics' Pavilion till he went in
side for a few minutes. When he came
out the rig had disappeared. He noti
fied the police, and Gorman saw the
two boys with the rig on Market

It from a man on Haight street, but
they did not know the man.
A lot of pumping apparatus was

REASON FOR GRATITUDE.
THE public doubtless feels duly grateful for the
enterprise of yellow journalism in publishing
a picture of the tooth brush and the hair brush
for which a condemned murderer is not much longer
to have need. The^e has been in the community a
panting unrest, not for a sight of these articles them
selves, for human ambition has limits. To have the
privilege of seeing the actual brushes would be too
much to hope, and in the absence of this possibility
what so soothing as their artistic portrayal? After
r<ll. the brushes have much the aspect of other
brushes, but think of the association! The ordinary
brush, smoothing the locks of the uncondemned or
imparting to his incisors a pleasing luster, has no
power to enthrall. And only for the thoughtful and
painstaking idiocy of yellow journalism this genera
tion would have passed away not knowing what sort
of brushes the prisoner used! Nay, not even know
ing him to be addicted to any, but, misled and un
enlightened, borne to its several graves an idea that
he employed his hair mostly to tear and his teeth to
gnash.
THE PROSPECTS OF THE YEAR.
BRIGHT and full of promise are all the pros
pects of the new year for America, but gloomy
and threatening are those which confront the
nations of Euiope and Asia. Here we need exercise
only the most ordinary prudence and industry to
achieve prosperity, but in the Old World there will
be required the utmost care and watchfulness to
avoid widespiead war and almost universal disaster.
Fortunately the outlook in even the most menaced
portions of the world abroad is not so bad as to
weaken the sanguine hopefulness with which we can
go forward to the work that awaits us. The power
known as the "concert of Europe" understands too
veil the dangers of war to permit any single nation
to lightly disturb the existing peace. More than
once in recent years complications as serious as
those which now fill the nations with fore
bodings of immediate war have been solved by the
concert and peace maintained, and an equally good
result may be expected in the settlement of the con
flicting claims of the Orient.
Even if war breaks out it will not prove directly
injurious to us. Our industries are largely indepen
dent of European or Asiatic conditions. The articles
we export to those lands are mainly of prime neces
sity and will be needed by their consumers in times
of war not less than in times of peace. Both our in
dustries and our commerce, therefore, are as safe, as
human affairs can be, and the outlook of the year is
full of promise for them, notwithstanding tlie menac
ing situation elsewhere.
The revival of industry following the enactment
of the protective tariff has been the most salient fea
ture of the past year in the United States, and as
tariff issues are now out of politics confidence has re
turned to the people and new enterprises are under
way in every section of the Union. All that is lack
ing to a complete assurance of business is the settle
ment of the currency problem, and that may be rea
sonably expected in the near future.
For California and all the Pacific Coast the pros
pects are unusually bright. The wonderful stories of
gold discoveries brought from Alaska last summer
and confirmed by reports that continue to come in
have attracted to this coast and to gold mining the
attention of the entire civilized world. Thousands
of enterprising capitalists, bold adventurers and
hardy miners are coming West, and San Francisco
will be the point of rendezvous and outfitting for the
great majority of them. This means a stimulus to
our commerce, a demand for our products, a new
era of development in our mines and an increased
activity in all lines of industry.
Well assured of good legislation at Washington
and of good conditions for trade in ail sections of our
country, we can without fear of disaster go forward
in all avenues of advancement that are open to us.
It is a year of opportunity for California, and the
only responsibilities it imposes are those of enter
prise, diligence and the continuous manifestation of
a spirit of harmony and mutual co-operation.
That too much zeal may be exercised even in so
worthy a cause as the sale of second-hand goods
there is no doubt. Two clerks in St. Louis have as
certained this fact at some cost. They dragged a
man into the store, determined he should purc.iase,
and he had to shoot them both to get away. As one
of them will die and the other has a bullet in the
arm, reform is sure in the first case and probable in
the other. Yet the method of the reformer will
strike as severe the conservative who happen to have
escaped being shanghaied by a street clerk.
Too bad an expert cannot be employed to analyze
the gas bills as minutely as the gas itself is to be ex
ploited. They are not exactly deadly, but they are
enough to make a man sick.
THAT "SEPARATE LOW."
AND Prudent Dole said. "I believe the United
States will give us a separate law, by which
we can get laborers here."
Referring to executive document I, part I, Fifty
third Congress, we get an idea of the kind of '"sep
arate law " expected by President Dole to fit the
"peculiar conditions and needs of labor" referred
to in President McKinley's message. In an inquiry
made into the form of labor required by the planters
this revelation occurs:
"Suppose a contract laborer is idling in the fields,
what do you do?"
"We dock him; we give him only half or three
quarters of a day, and if he keeps it up we resort to
the law and have him arrested for refusing to
work."
'What do you accomplish by putting him in jail?"
"For the first offense he is ordered back to work
and he has to pay fhe costs of court. If he refuses
to obey orders he is arrested again and a light fine
Is inflicted, which the planter can pay and take out ot
his wages, or else he is put on the road to work.
For the third offense he is likely to get three months'
imprisonment." : ... : .
Now the laws of the United States make it un
lawful to prepay transportation or in any way assist
the importation of any alien under contract, parole,
express or implied, to labor in the United States.
The thirteenth amendment to out constitution, which
abolished slavery, provides that: "Neither slavery
nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
for crime whereof the party shall have been duly
convicted, shall exist within the United States or any
place subject to their jurisdiction."
Now the kind of law which Dole believes will be
given "separately" to the islands provides for in
voluntary servitude, for it compels the performance
of labor under penalty of imprisonment.
President Dole's laws now in force are perhaps
the best definition of what he believes will be per
mitted by the separate law necessary for the islands.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald, who has been in
Washington lobbying for annexation as an agent
of Dole's purposes, in his report made last summer
on returning from his Hawaiian junket says offi
cially:
â¦*"â¦!> investigations through the Ha.
waiian Island* have brought to my a Men
lion 111:111 y new conditions and phases ol
labor, the most important of which is the
Asiatic hordes that now infest the islands
and predominate in numbers upon the
plantations!. I have seen 30,000 bare,
footed laborer*, half of* whom work un
der a penal contract ; I have seen rewards
offered for their arrest when they violated
their contract and deserted the planta
tion, with their number printed across
their photograph in convict style."
Let it be remembered that every law now on the
statute books of Hawaii has been put there by Dole
or remains there by his sufferance. He has been the
supreme oligaich of that country for four years. The
penal contract law and the involuntary servitude
under it are therefore regarded by him as necessary
to the industries of the islands, and their continuance
is what he believes will be permitted by a separate
law of the United States after annexation.
If the plantations could be run on any other sys
tem he has had four years in which to demonstrate
it. He has had four years in which to abolish in
voluntary servitude. Lincoln began and closed a
war for preservation of the Union and freed 4.000,000
slaves in four yea/s. But in that time Dole has not
been able to abolish penal contracts for labor, and
now believes they will be continued by the United
States.
We repeat this matter must be looked squarely in
the face. Either the planters, on whose estates white
labor is impossible, are to be cheated and ruined or
the constitution is to be violated by a separate law
compelling the stars and stripes 4 to wave over in
voluntary servitude in Hawaii. Which is it?
THE PASADENA FETE.
ASADENA, by holding an annual festival of
Proses in the open air on January i, does much
to make known to the shivering East the win
ter charms and attractions of California. In some re
spects, therefore, the rose fete is a matter of more
than ordinary interest to the entire commonwealth.
It is a Californian glory in which all Californians
have a right to share.
The festival is the more appropriate this year be
cause it follows so closely after the stories of the
frost in that section of the State. It will carry to the
East full assurances that Southern California has not
been blighted by the cold wave, that her roses arc
still in bloom and her people in a mood to make
merry and rejoice among the brilliant blossoms that
adorn their gardens.
From the preliminary reports that come to us it
appears evident that Pasadena understands the value
of making an exceptionally fine display this year.
The parade and tournament today promise to
be the largest and most attractive ever made on a
similar occasion. It will be something more than
the perfunctory observance of a customary holiday,
and unless the weather by some extraordinary freak
proves wholly unpropitious, the celebration will be
a most auspicious opening of the season of floral
festivals throughout the State.
It is fortunate that at least one city in the com
monwealth celebrates New Year's day in this way.
Jt serves to emphasize the difference between life in
California and that in any other portion of the
Union. New Year's observances in the East are not
widely dissimilar from those which are common in
England and France. The customs of celebration
there have been brought from the Old World. It is
not so in this land of winter sunshine and January
roses. We have a climate unique in the Northern
Hemisphere, and it is fitting that our pleasures as
well as our labors should be adapted to the advan
tages it gives for open air fetes at all seasons of the
year.
Hardly is it reported that Li Hung Chang has lost
his yellow jacket than information comes that he is
again high in royal favor. It must be these
intervals represent the times when the garment has
been in the rcnovalory.
It is unfair to accuse Ezeta of trying to raise an
agitation in Salvador. The last heard of him he was
trying to raise the amount of a month's rent in Oak
land.
Chicago should not boast so much about its low
death rate. Everybody knows the reason to be that
Chicagoans are not prepared to die.

THE SAN FKA^CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JAXUATCY 1, 1898.
A PLETHORA OF NORMAL SCHOOLS.
IN his address before the California Teachers' As
sociation Samuel T. Black, State Superintendent
of Public Instruction, expressed the opinion that
California has not a sufficient number of normal
schools. At the present time it maintains three of
these institutions, and another will be opened within
a year. Mr. Black says that California, with her
160,000 square miles of area, should be thickly dotted
with normal schools. He does not say anything
about the expense of maintaining them, but he thinks
if such schools were smaller and more numerous
they would do a deal more good than the lim
ited number now in existence are doing.
As we understand it normal schools are designed
for training teachers. The general education of
teachers is obtained in the grammar and high
chools. It is the normal institution which puts the
finishing touches upon the individual who is sent out
to instruct the young idea how to shoot. Therefore,
normal schools are no part of the general system of
education. ; ; :; ; '".;.':
California has a population of about 1,500,000,
one-fifth of whom are children. Unless everybody is
going to go to school and the entire State is going
to be devoted to education it would seem that the
four normal schools in existence and on the way
ought to turn out a sufficient supply of teachers to
satisfy the most exacting. It is said that statistics,
if compiled, would show that in California at least
â  one out of every three young women graduated from
the normal schools never teaches at all. They either
fail to get into the School Departments of the State
or they get married.
Of course education is a good thing, but it can
hardly be maintained that the taxpayers should pay
for educating the wives of the State. Nor can it be
successfully established that they ought to pay for
educating any more teachers' than are necessary to
provide the schools with instructors.
The truth of the matter is, probably, that Super
intendent Black, like most men engaged in an ob
sorbing occupation, has been carried away by his
business. He undoubtedly thinks that normal
schools are the salvation of the country, and that
without them we would speedily relapse into a state
of dense ignorance. As a matter of fact, however,
teachers are born, not made. Normal schools never
can make pedagogues out of some people. Some
of the best instructors ever known never saw the in
side of a normal school.
No one desires to abate the educational system in
any respect, but the taxpayers ought to have some
thing to say about the creation of normal schools.
We do not want a normal school in every county.
One well equipped institution would undoubtedly
supply a sufficient number of teachers. Four ought
to be enough for the next fifty years.
/""'Â» ONGRESSMAN LOUD has given notice of
I an iitention to press the enactment of his bill
providing for the amendment of the postal
lsws relating to second-class mail matter, and. as a
result, the opponents of the measure are engaged in
a vigorous agitation against it. It, therefore, be
hooves the friends of the measure to be equally ac
tive in order that the much desired reform may be
accomplished.
The issue is one that has been long discussed and
is generally understood. The bill proposed by Mr.
Loud is in the interests of economy and fair dealing,
and has been well received by merchants and other
business men throughout the countiy. The object
is simply to put an end to abuses practiced under the
law by which the revenues of the government are
diminished and the postal service rendered a burden
upon the government instead of being self-support
ing.
The bill as reported by Mr. Loud admits to the
mails as second-class matter all newspapers and peri
odical publications which are issued at stated inter
\als and as frequently as four times a year, but pro
poses to prohibit the admission of books or reprints
of books and to abolish the sample copy privilege to
newspapers.
The amendment is as necessary to justice between
citizens as to economy of service. At the present
time the publishers of cheap and trashy books issue
them as parts of a so-called periodical library and
get low fates through the mails while the publishers
of standard works have no such advantage. The
government is thus put in the position of promoting

FIGHTING POSTAL REFORM.
Interesting Astronomical
PHENOMENA
THE astronomical occurrences for the year 1898 include three lunar and three
solar eclipses, but the Pacific Coast is debarred from usual interest in nearly
all these phenomena, being on the sunny side of the gobe when the moon
passes through the shadow projecting from the opposite Â»ide, and within this
shadow of night when two of the solar eclipses occur, and too ' ar north for obser
vation on the other occasion.
However, on the evening of January 7 the moon will rise lÂ«fore the partial
eclipse of that date is fully past, the earth's shadow lingering on the western side
of the disk until 5:23 V. S. T.. when it is Several degrees above he northeastern
borteon. A nearly similar glimpse will be obtained of the lunar ec'ipse of Decem
ber ISOS, a year hence, the total phase being past when it rises l-ito view. The
intermediate lunar eclipse of July 3 is invisible here. In 1852 three Uinar eclipses
also occurred, the greatest number possible in one calendar year, i'.ut the most
important astronomical event will be the solar eclipse of January 21 ;-tkl 22, when
the moon will completely obscure the sun's disk along the path of totality in
Africa and Asia. Though California will then be in the midnight hours, it has an
especial interest in the event as the only American expeditions are those from the
Lick and Chabot observatories. The duration of this temporary gloom wheh gives
such choice glimpses of the sun's surroundings will vary from about one to two
minutes, according to the position of the place of observation. As railroao.^ from
both Calcutta and Bombay are convenient to the line of totality, desirable stations
will be easily selected, the west of Hindustan being especially favorable. Weather
reports indicate the probability of a clear sky in January, and there are . *ood
grounds for anticipating valuable information as to the solar corona, the c^ief.
object of observation. Professor Campbell of the Lick Observatory is equipped for
speetroseopic work, and Mr. Burckhalter of the Chabot observatory will test his
ingenious instrument for photographing the corona with an exposure graduated to
suit both the brighter and fainter luminosity.
Another interesting event in the beginning of the year will be the occultation
of the Pleiades by the slightly gibbous moon on the evening of January 30. This
will be more favorable for Pacific Coast observers than elsewhere, as the well
known little group will not bo far west of the meridian when it commences to dis
appear behind the uniHuminated side of the lunar disk. The diagram, in which the
mythological names of the principal Pleiades are given, conveys an idea of this
| occurrence, which affords an opportunity for a useful and interesting observation
\ that can be made even without magnifying power.
In the evening skies of spring and autumn the planets Venus, Jupiter and
Saturn will be conspicuous objects. Venus glides past the sun in the middle of
February, and transfers its luster from the morning to the evening sky, where it
will gleam in the west until the enÂ« of November. September 22 the greatest east
i crn elongation occurs; in other words, the planet will be higher above the western
iiorizon and longer visible after sunset than on any previous or subsequent even
ins during the season. At this time it may be seen in the afternoon near the
meridian long before sunset. In February Jupiter appears in the east at 10 P. M.,
i Saturn rises about the same hour in May toward the southeast, and Mercury wili
j glimmer in the western sky for a few days about April 10, August 8 and Decem-
I ber 3.
In November, 1893, meteoric .showers may be looked for with more confidence
than in previous years, as a return of Temple's comet is due early in 1899, and the
Leonid shower, with which it is mysteriously connected, may appear in advance
as on former occasions; and Biela'B lost comet, if it still exists, will be also ap
proaching, and its attendant meteors may appear in unusual numbers; but such
Phenomena defy prediction. The same applies to the new comets and new stars
that may perchance gleam down on us during the coming year.
ROSE O'HALLORAN.
FALL AND WINTER LITERARY FASHIONS.
An interesting showing of the mental pabulum on -which San Francisco has
' Loon feeding during the fall and early winter has resulted from some special re
; bt arches into their records of circulation just made by George T. Clark and A M
Je:i:son, the respective librarians of the public and the Mechanics' libraries.
I Perhaps it is not an exact use of words to lump it as "mental" pabulum for
; half the enormous amount of "reading" supplied to the people of this metropolis
i by these two great literary storehouses Is fiction, and serves mainly as emotional
{ pabulum. The great flood of novels pours forth unceasingly and reaches thousands
lof homes, grand and lowly, by way of every street and alley in the city from
j Richmond to the Potrero. This tide of fiction goes forth to satisfy the hunger of
the imagination, to tickle the fancy, to touch heart strings as it may be given the
player to do, and to enrich lives that may seem commonplace to those who live them.
These novels are not read for the dash of science or philosophy that may be in
thÂ«-m, but because they minister to the emotional interest in human life. Weakly
j or well, they daily bring before a legion of people in varied form the great realities
of life-its ripht and its wrong, its impulses, emotions and passions.
Whatever the waste or the profit of It, these two libraries alona supply nearly
| :W).000 .novels a year to the San Francisco public, including juvenile fiction, and
I this is but a part of the total annual novel consumption.
It is interesting to note as a partial measure of current public taste what works
I of fiction rise from amid the mass as the ones in greatest demand, and it is this
I scale of popularity that has been approximately figured out by these two librari
ans. The taste of the thousands borrowers from these libraries Is fairly repre
sentative of the general average of the taste of the whole fiction-reading public
At the free public library Mr. Clark had compiled a list giving in sequence ac
cording to the number of times issued, the hundred novels of greatest circulation
during the preceding eighteen weeks. It is not a perfect measure of the demand
because the demand did not have free play owing to variations in the number of
copies and the inadequacy of the number of those most wanted, but it serves its
i purpose very well.
The most popular novel during that period was Anthony Hope's "Prisoner of
Zenda," sixteen copies of which were issued 230 times. And Hope with his
Phroso.'.' holds second place as well, 132 readers being: able to enjoy the nine
copies circulated. Dv Maurier's "Trilby" is third on the list, and then begins the'
interesting showing of how strong a hold on the reading public the favorite old
masterpieces preseil c, for "Ben Hur" stands fourth and "The Count of Monte
Cristo" is next. Just preceding that favorite of the day, "The Choir Invisible"
eight copies of which went to 103 borrowers. . iuviwoie.
Â»â¢. As ,i he L ist runs on in the very- gradual decline of the scale, the alternations of
the old and the new are very interesting to note. Here are the next twenty ii

Stirling, "The Scarlet Letter," "Saraclnesca" (Crawford), "Soldiers of Fortune"
(Davis), "Second Wife" (Wister), "Romola." fortune
The showing at the Mechanics' library is not so exact, because members have
free access to the shelves, and clashed records are not kept. ThT only exact
figures are .those of the registrations of requests for the new and popular books
which may be kept for one week only and which are issued to members in the
order of registration. A difference follows, too, from the difference In the natures
of thÂ« two institutions. The Mechanics', depending for prosperity on the dues of

MR. FILCHER EXPLAINS.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 27, 1897.
To the Kditor of The Callâ Sir:
Referring to an editorial article which
recently appeared in The Call re
latins to the publication called "Califor
nia, the Land of Promise," and referring?
to the article on "Transportation" found
therein, permit me to say that the mem
bers of the board are conscious of the
omission of the names of many railroad
companies from that article. The San
Joiiniiiii Valley road, the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe, thes San Francisco
and North Pacific, the North Pacific
Coast and various small branch lines in
the State are not mentioned, and the
only mention made of the Southern Pa
cific Company is incidental.
The point taken by The Call is in a
sense Just, and the members of the board
â¢will accept It in the spirit In which it
waa written. It is due in exact Justice
to the board find its work, however, to
say that the editor of the book. In plan
ning an article on transportation, sought
simply to present the relation of the
ocean to the great valleys of California.
Mr.' Curtis, the able author of the ar
ticle, was asked to write it. and he him
self suggested. the value of that nioÂ«
harbors existed at short "nte^rvals Jon*

was to show that the ocean if Mow and
will remain a controlling facto in the
transpprtation of ti.e future. /
The article was not intended as an ad
vertisement of the Southern mcific Com
pany, or thÂ« Atchison. Tope** and Santa
* c, or the San Joaquin â  v alf : - nor was
the omission of the names the latter
railroads intentional. But f>r the . inci
dental mention of , the So^hern Pacific
Company no railroad by is titlo would
have b en mentioned. -. E^Â«n . the mention
of the Southern Pacific ennpany : as In
tended to dissipate the iljurious impres
sion which â  has been s/read â¢ broadcast
/
through the land to the effect that the
transportation facilities of California
were so monopolized that its develop
ment was obstructed, if not wholly ar
rested. The purpose of the article on . ,
"Transportation" was to remove this in
jurious impression. . *". .... "-. â 
The work performed by the editor, or
the book was very onerous, and no mem- Â»
ber of the board, nor in fact any mem
her of the community, will question his
patriotic motives. The board decided on
the publication of the book only a snort
time previous to the coming of the
Christian Endeavorers. Each writer was.
assigned a subject and given an outline
of its treatment, and the outline given
to the gentleman who contributed tne
article on "Transportation" is herein .
above set forth. Â° ... .. _
The board has secured the publication
of a second edition of ,10.000 copies In
doing this if contracted to furâ¢
stereotyped plates of the book as oiig- â¢

typing feature which 1 as reproduced the

Convoy of the Cruiser
Leander.
Both Are British Warships for
the Pacific Coast Sta
tion.
Called Here on Their Way From
England to the Esqtiimalt, B. C,
Navy-Yard.
The Rritish cruiser Leander and tor
pedo-destroyer Virago arrived from
England en routo to Esquimau, B. C,
yesterday. This is their first visit to
this port, and they will be followed in
a day or two by the cruiser Phaeton
and torpedo-destroyer Sparrow Hawk,
all of which vessels are intended for
the re-enforcement of the British
squadron on the Pacific. The Virago i*
the first vessel of her class ever Beeli in
the bay of San Francisco, and every
wharf along the front was crowded
with people anxious to get a look at
her. The Leander is not a mod m ves
sel, and simply came out as â â â  C âºn'vbj?
for the Virago. They both left Ply
mouth, Eng., some months as", and
came here via the Straits of Magellan
stopping at a number of ] "its tot coal,
on the way. Their last stopping place
was San Diego, Where the Leander took
on 400 tons and the Virago ninety tons
of fuel.
Captain Fred F Fegan had consider
able trouble In finding an anchorage
for the two warships. He first of al!
steamed slowly up as far as Hunters
Point, and then, changing his mind,
came slowly back again. Off the lYr
ries both b ats came to a stop for a
few minutes %\hile a consultation was
held. While this was going on the
ferry steamers Garden City and Oak
land' had also come to a stop, and their
ins, finding that the Britishers
v> .â : â â¢â¢ likely to remain at a standstill for
a while, they made a circle around tlv-
Leander and made their landing in
that way. Next the Virago got in th>
v. ay of the T3ay City and Encinal.
They also had to stop their eng
and go astern, but, instead of having
to go around the torpedo- Ltetrbyer, the
latter gut out of their way. At one time
there were three scows, three ferry
boats, a collier and the two warships
all in a bunch, and trouble was mo
mentarily :. but none came.
Finally the Leander was brought to
anchor off Jackson-street wharf, and
the Virago anchored astern of her.
The Leander is a second-class cruiser
of 4300 tons, or a little larger than the
Charleston, but not so modern. Btie
was built in LBB6, and is 300 feet lojig,
40 feet beam, 20:6 feet draft, and has
room in her bunkers for 1000 tons of
coal. Her maximum speed in IS knots
and her average nearly 13 knots. Sh"
carries ten 6-inch breech-loading rifle
guns, six 6-pounders and a number of
machine guns. She carries a crew of 321
men all told. Her officers are:
tain. Fred F. Fegan; first lieutenant.
Louis P. Hutchins; navigating officer,
Lientenant Danreuther; lieutenai
P. Mansel. George J. Todd, Walter <\
Buxton; chief engineer, Henry Wallis;

The Virago is a most peculiar-look
ing craft. Forward sh^ has the ap
pearance of a miniature whaleback.
â¢while aft h^r row of four smokestakes
gives h^r a most unwarlikf agpear
an.ee. Her engines are able to develop
6000 horse-power under pressure, and
she is said to be able to beat thirty
knots an hour. The vessel is 211
long, 21 feet 7 inches broad and 10 feet
deep. Her displacement is 420 tons.
Fhe moves through the water without
a ripple and raises no foam before her
nor leaves any in her wake. She cuts
the water like a knife and apparently
without any effort. She carries sixty
six men a!! told. Her officers are:
mdc . Baird; lieutenant-com

Pounds, and chief gunner. Weeks. The
two vessels "ill remain in port a few
days and will then proceed to British

FIRE MARSHAL
INVESTIGATING
The Seal Rex* House Fire
Might Have Beerj Due to
an Accident.
The supposed in ndlary fire at the
Seal Rock House T > -la, night, told
exclusively in yesterday's CUI, was in
vestigated by Fire Marshal Towe yes
terday.
The Fire Marshal telephoned to
Henry Dnsher, the prÂ» tor. to call
at his office. Dosher di -, terday
morning, and said the Story i n The Call
was substantially correct.
Dosher accompanied T< f the
premises, and Towe began his Investi
gation thoroughly. It never occurred
to Dosher or his wife or any one of the
others that the fire might have b- Â»n
accidental.
Mrs. Rose M. Alldack, "wife of Dosh
er's stepson, called at the resort early
in the evening and wanted liquor,
which was refused. She went away,
returning later, and it was thought at
tempted to burn down the place b_y set
ting fire to the curtains in the room in
the upper floor. It was supposed she
had done so because she had been re
fused liquor, and also because her hus
band had commenced suit for divorce
from her. *Â»\ '
All the circumstances pointed to fhe
conclusion that she had deliberately
set fire to the curtains. Her flight froia
the room after the curtains took flr\
was in itself a suspicions circum
stance against her. .
The lamp was on a small table be
tween the curtains. She was seen after
placing the lamp on the table to walk
toward the door and close it, and it is
just possible that, the draught caused
by shutting the door might have made
the flame in the lamp leap up and set
fire to the curtains.
No action will be taken until the Fire
Marshal has an opportunity of ques
tioning Mrs. Alldack, who" is only 20
years of nee.

trial, for the whole lurid history of
the Gold Ridge mine, the murders it
has caused, and the blood that hap
been spilled over its hidden treasure,
will ail be brought into the light of
day.
The Injunction was originally issued
to prevent the levying of an assess
ment on the stock of the mine, on thr
ground that the officers who had levied
the assessment had voted themselves
salaries that, if applied to the develop
ment of the mine, would have rendered
the levying of an assessment unneces
sary., Sylvester, the president of the
company, moved to dissolve the tem
porary injunction issued, but that was
denied, and the injunction must re
main until it is made permanent or is
dissolved forever.
The troubte is the outgrowth of the
changing owners and officers which
has made the history of the mine one
of crime and death. It was a year ago
New Year's eve that the first murder
was committed. The mine was then in
the hands of officers elected as the re
sult of a pool of the stock of three of
the largest stockholders in the concern.
These were Henry Sylvester, W. H.
Lillie and Richard Phelan. The pool
was the result of an attempt to feel! the
mine to an Eastern syndicate for $100,
000, which was opposed by the men
who formed the pool.
Originally the mine was in the hands
of W. C. Ralston. It was located in
1862 in one of the wildest sections of
Nevada county. Ralston sunk a shaft
in one of the claims with a view to a
sale should the result meet expecta
tions, but after going down thirty feet
the gravel was found to be so rich as
to lead to the suspicion that the mine
had been saited, and this delayed pro
ceedings until the death of Ralston put
an end to the deal.
Tho mine lay idle until in 1891 the
Gold Ridge Company was formed, with
L.illie as president. During his admin
istration an attempt was made to bond
the mine for $100,000 to an Eastern syn
dicate, but Lillie, SylveÃter and Fhe
lan refused to go in. After they had
formed their pool and blocked the
bonding of the mine they elected Syl
vester president, and soon after levied
a.n assessment to start developing the
property. This assessment was op
posed by Mark Strauss, one of the
stockholders, and an injunction re
straining the directors from assessing
the stock was granted by Judge Troutt
in 1895. This case is now on appeal to
the Supreme Court.
Tlv-n another assessment was levied,
and this time it was opposed by Kelly.
In the meantime the directors had
been supplying the money for the as
sessment work which had to be done
to hold the mine, and over this work
there came a conspiracy to seize the
mine on the ground that the necessary
work had not been done and hold it
Under the name of a new company.
I'aul Mullor was then the superin
tendent of the mine, and he got wind
of the fact that an attempt would be
made to relocate the property. He ex
j.< cted trouble, and prepared himself
hy barricading the cabin where he and
his m< n Ji vÂ»-<l.
It whs New Year's eve when Rich
l.'ird Phclan, Dan O'Connor and Owen
YvVhite came to the claims. The night
v as Btormy, and the snow lay so thick
|Â«m the ground that the men had to
i â â¢! on snowshnes. They tried to
: Ater the cabin, but the men inside re
i siWr-d and held their place. In the
cabin with Mullcr was Jim O'Connor,
a Vothcr of Dan, and through him
a Mi-lfy was agreed upon and the in
vades were allowed to enter. They
got Â» farther than the door, however,
for -when the door was opened their
weapwH were roady and at once the
duel lÂ«gan. Several shot* were fired
in rapi Bttoceâ ton, and when it was
over Pi|il Muller was dying and Jim
O'Conmfr, who had fought manfully In
defense \of the cabin, was badly
wounded"-.
Phelan and his men waited until 12
o'clock tht| night, and when New Year
came in 1% promptly relocated the
claims for. the Marguerite Mining
Company. He was taken â¦Â« TVnairae
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 1, 1898.
TORPEDO-CATCHER AND CONVOY.
and tried for murder, but he was ac
quitted by the Coroner's jury.
The relocation had no effect upon the
Gold Ridge Company, for it went right
on, ignoring the new organization and
the treachery of Phelan, although the
members of the new company put in
several thousands of dollars in devel
oping the mine.
. Last October the dead body of Dan
O'Connor was found on the road near
the mine, and Phelan was arrested for
the crime. He was tried in Downie
ville. Sierra County, and was con-:
victed. and is now serving a sentence
of twenty-five years in the State
Prison. It was shown that he waited
for O'Connor, and when he rode past
Phelan fired upon him from behind a
tree. Why it was done was never
really found out, but the old miners
refer to that deadly duel on the hill,
and say probably O'Connor knew too
much. _____________
"THE FIRST BORN"
A HEAVY-WEIGHT.
Clever Burlesque of the Famous
Chinese Drama at the
Verein.
Excellent Musics and a Book That
Abounded With Local
Hits.
S. L. Ackerman gave his fellow mem
bers of the Verein and their friends a
taste of his keen wit, good-natured fun
and all-round cleverness in his bur
lesque of Francis Powers' celebrated
Chinese drama, "The First Born," pre
sented as the piece-de-resistance at the
entertainment in -honor of the New
Year at the Verein Club rooms last
evening.
Ackerman told the tender little tale
with all the conciseness of the great
Powers, only he omitted the tender
ness and the "little" parts. His Chang
Toy had arrived at the age of discre
tion when he no longer counts hiÃ
years, and when his "too too solid
flesh" had to be hauled from off the
fatal roof by the eminently picturesque
apparatus employed to lower a thou
sand-pound safe from a sixth story
window.
The touching tale of oriental life was
told for the moat part in song. E. M.
Rosener composed the music and in
vested his subject with a true "Chi
nese spirit."
The play was mounted with the origi
nal scenery that was used at the Alca
zar in the initial production, and the
Chinese supers who traveled all the
way to London to show the Cockneys
how we do things out West, again as
sumed the parts they had created.
Ackerman gave his conception of
the role of "Chang Wong," and Dr.
Newman won golden laurels as little
"Chang Toy 1 " the first born.
Joseph Sloss had to get a messenger
boy to carry off his "mash notes," he
was so "cute" as "Lol Tslng," the slave
girl.
Joseph Dinkelspiel scored a marked
triumph as the villainous "Man Low
Yek."
Between the acts of the burlesque
there was an excellent vaudeville pro
gramme, to which the clever club mem
bers contributed.
At midnight an elaborate supper was
served, after which dancing was in
augurated and continued until early
morning.
Four hundred and fifty guests en-
Joyed this fashionable club's hospi
tality.

HOFF'S DEFENSE
NOW IN ORDER
The Case for ttie Prose-
cution Concluded
Yesterday.
Important Testimony Given b
Drs. Bunnell and Gal
lagher.
The Shpemaker.Goepel, Distinguishes
. Himself by Making "Contradictory
The prosecution closed its case yes
terday afternoon in the charge of mur
der against Albert Hoff and a continu
ance was granted the defense till next
W'.ilnrsilay morning.
The first witness yesterday was Wil
liam Haynes, a carpet-layer, who was
at work in the house 863 Guerrero
street on the day of the murder. James
Donahue, who was working with
I Haynes, was then called and testified
j that Hoff was with Mrs. Clute when
i he left the house at five minutes to 5
I o'clock.
('. W. Marks, a schoolteacher, testi
fied to being called by Mr. and Mrs.
Legg, and going with them to the room
: on the imin i Bat and iinding the dead
! body. Ho went for Dr. Inman, who
looked at the body and pronounced life
extinct.
Deputy Coroner O'Brien testified to
taking charge of the body and remov
ing it to the Morgue.
Dr. Bunneil of the Receiving Hos
pital testified to examining the wound
in the palm of Hoff's left hand, and
thought it could have been caused by
the jagged edge of the coupling pin.
He saw the coupling pin at the time
and there was blo<-d on it. The doctor
was subjected to a long cross-examina~
tion as to the nature of the wound and
what he knew about blood.
Dr. Gallagher, autopsy physician, de
scribed, as the result of his post
mortem examina.tif.-n, that death had
been caused by punctures of the skull.
The organs of the deceased were all in
good condition. The coupling pin could
have caused the wound a.
Henry Mieneycr, proprietor of the
Lindell House on Sixth street, wh_ere
Hr.-ff roomed, identified the carpet bag
as belonging to Huff, and testified that
Hoff did not occupy his room on the
night of the murder. He also recol
lected Hoff getting a card from Freyer,
th*> saloon-keeper at 119 Sixth street,
asking him to- call there.
C. H. Clarke, brothtr-in-law of the
murdered woman, was called and tes
tified to having identified the body of
his sister-in-law at the Morgue.
R. (Joepel. the shoemaker, on Van
Ness avenue, made a very unsatisfac
tory witness. He is slightly deaf and
is not v* ry conversant with the idioms
Of the English language. He contra
dicted himself several times as to dates
and caused no end of heated argu
ments between thr> attorneys and the
Judge. He contradicted Decker, the
cigar man, who testified Thursday that
when Goepel, H^ff and a young man
were in Dlerks' saloon on the morning
after the murder and Decker asked
Hoff if he had been in the house 803
Guerrero- street, Goepel said to Hoff,
"You told me to say nothing about
this, and you talk all the time." He
denied saying that.
Policeman E. C. Robinson was the
next witness. He testified to finding
the coupling pin in the house, and that
it wag almost covered with blood.
The coupling pin and carpet bag were
put in as evidence against the objec
tion of the defendant's attorneys.
Hoff is indignant over the claim of
the police that ho in inhuman.
"About a yenr ago, " he said laat
night, "I was fishing off Washington
street wharf when a man named
RoHewalter, who was despondent,
jumped in the bay a few feet away
from me. I went to his rescue, and, af
ter considerable trouble, pulled him
out of the bay.
"The credit of saving him was given
to a policeman. This shows whether or
not I am inhuman."

QUEER LEGAL
COMPLICATION
' Some Fine Law Points
in the Estate of
Waters.
Attorneys Must Prove the Un
soundness and Soundness of
Mrs. Waters* Mind.
Two Cases That Require Opposite Tes
timony From the Same Side
at the Same Time.
By order of court yesterday the de
position of Mrs. Catherine Woods of
Ness, Kansas, was opened and its con
tents were made public.
Mrs. Wood! is the niece of the late
Arthur Waters who died in this city,
December 31, 1592, and over whose es
tate there has been so much bitter liti
gation. The deposition opened yester
day was taken in the case of Marga
ret Mulcahey against Hezekiah Dow
and others, to secure a portion of the
estate of Arthur Waters, her deceased
brother; she was Joined by Mrs. Woods,
who is the daughter of Thomas Wat
ers, a deceased brother of Arthur Wat
ers.
Arthur Waters died Intestate, and
when his estate came into the Probate
Court it was distributed to his widow,
for it was shown that there were no
living relatives of Arthur "Waters other
than his widow. Mrs. Waters died
about a year after the death of her
husband, and when her will came to
probate her nieces and nephews as
sailed it, and it was set aside on the
grounds of Incompetence and undue in
fluence. A new trial was granted, how
ever, and the case will come up again
In the latter part of January.
In January of 1896 the sister and the
niece and nephew of Arthur Waters
learned of the death of their relative,
and at the same time they learned that
while he had died intestate, his en
tire property had been distributed to
his widow, although the law allows her
but one-half when there are other rel
atives living. They sued for their
share, but as Mrs. Waters had long
been dead they made her executors de
fendants in the case. Their claim is
that they were never notified of the
death of their relative, although it was
well known at the time that they were
living in the East. They therefore seek
to have set aside the decree of distri
bution and their proper share of Wat
ers' estate allotted them from the es
tate of Mrs. Waters. That case, too, is
set for the end of January.
In her deposition, Mrs. Woods tells
h'>u she knew of an uncle named Ar
thur Woods, who was living in San
Francisco, and who frequently corre
sponded with her grandmother who
lived in Burlington, Vt. He had also
sent her grandmother money on dif
ferent occasions, and she had heard her
grandmother say that her brother
should visit him when he went West.
She says, too, that her brother did
visit her uncle on one occasion when
he went to San Francisco.
She tells further facts to show that
she was Indeed the ni^ce of Arthur
Waters, and that at thÂ» time of his
death she was entitled to a niece's
share of his estate. She also sets forth
that she did not know of his death
until early In 1596. when she learned
the news from a friend, A. A. Enright,
in Burlington.
The two cap-^ present a peculiar le
gal complication. The Dows, execu
tors of the estate of Mrs. Waters, are
contesting the suit of Mrs. Mulcahey
on the ground that the widow at the
time the estate of Waters came up for
probate was of unsound mind, and
that she did not, in fact, know that rel
ntives of her husband were alive. They
are at the same time trying to uphold
the will once broken on the ground of
unsoundness of mind, which was made
at the same time she was probating
her husband'? estate. If they prove
F-ho was of sound mind, and there
fore establish her will, it will natur
ally follow that she knew of her hus
band's relatives and must allow them
their share of the property. If it be
proved, however, that she was of un
sound mind and sn did not know of the
absent heirs, then her will must fa!i
before the assaults of her own rela
tives. The two cases will come up in
the Superior Court before Judge Slack,
the orlglnnl case on January 17, and
the will case on January 20.

THE END A
FITTING ONE
Close of the California
State Teachers' Con
vention.
It Was Marked by Excellent
Music and Some Able
Addresses.
The Concluding Oration Considered
One of the Beat During ihe
Convention.
The last (session of the Teachers'
Convention in Metropolitan Temple
yesterday morning was a fitting close
for such a successful gathering as this
has been. It was opened with a chorus
of fifty San Francisco Normal School
girls, under the direction of Miss E.
Carpenter, who sang "Freedom, Sweet
Freedom." They were accompanied on
the organ by John C. Howe.
The report of the committee appoint
ed to investigate the charges made
against Superintendent Greenwood was
then read. It completely exonerated
him from all blame.
R. H. Webster made an interesting
address on "The Proposed Celebration
of Lincoln's Xatal Day by the Public
Schools of California." After giving
a short histofy of the life of Lincoln
he said:
"The Lincoln Monument League, of
which W. W. Stone, principal of the
Burnett School of this city and county,
is promoter and president, intends to
perpetuate Lincoln's memory by the
erection of monuments in the cities of
the country and by commemorating the
anniversary of his natal day, February
12, with appropriate exercises in the
schools of this city and State and other
States of the Union, until Lincoln's,
like Washington's, birthday, becomes
fixed In our calendar as a national holi
day. The Board of Education of this
city and county has declared It a holi
day and provides for its proper cele
bration.
"It is now earnestly hoped that every
teacher, every board of school trustees
and every city and county board of ed
ucation will unite and co-operate to
make this celebration universal."
An address on "Humane Education"
was to have been delivered by Miss E.
M. Gay, State Superintendent of hu
mane work, but as she was unable to
be present the address was read by
Miss Eliza D. Keith. She spoke strong
ly on the necessity of teaching chil
dren by practical methods to be kind
to the dumb animals, and that to tor
ture a dumb animal Is the crime of a
coward, and that he who does it is
capable of almost any crime not re
quiring courage.
"Tyranny," she said, "is the crime of
the strong against the weak, and all
cruelty, when not the result of ignor
ance, is the wicked expression of con
scious power, always demoralizing to
those who exercise it. Humane educa
tion includes sympathy and helpful
ness. The human* child will become
the benevolent, public-spirited man,
equally averse to cruelty to animals,
child labor, human sweatshops, injus
tice to women, oppression in any form.
Since the public school is the nursery
of American citizenship, humane edu
cation must find a place In its curricu
lum.
"Do not let our children know that
the buffalo in the humane paddocks in
Golden Gate Park are the last of their
race, a race all but exterminated in
sheer wantonness, shot down for a mo
ment's sport, as the Grand Duke
Alexis, the guest of the nation, shot
them from the platform of an overland
car, leaving the carcasses to rot where
they fell. Oh, never let our children
know that American men were guilty
of such cowardly brutality."
An original poem on "Educational
Progress, Its Foibles and Its Fads"
was read by Professor Charles H. Allen
and Mrs. Eva Tenny and Mrs. Emile
Parent sang a duet entitled "The Gyp
sies," and for an encore "The Nightin
gale and the Robin."
Professor E. G. Grigrgs of Stanford
University delivered the closing ad
dress, which was considered one of the
beÃt of the whole convention. His sub
ject was "Education for the Art Life,"
and, although lengthy, held the atten
tion of the audience till the close. He
said that life was divided into two
great chapters â business and personal
relations. Men should work persistently
through all discouragements. Only the
educated can appreciate the beautiful.
He believed in equalizing the school
system and picking teachers who knew
life in all its phases.
RESCUED FROM A DIVE.
Carrie Janscn Will Be SÂ«r)t to Her
Mother in Watsonville.
Carrie Jansen, a pretty, innocent
looking Rirl, was arrested Thursday
night in the Mascot dive on Kearny
street and charged with vagrancy.
She was released on $300 bonds?.
When the case was called in Judge
Conian'B court yesterday the Judge
was told that the girl's mother, a
widow, lived in Watsonville, and was
breaking her heart over the wayward
ness of her daughter.
The Judge questioned the girl, who
said she left home about two months
ago, but soon after she got here was
taken to one of the dives. She was
willing to go back home.
The Judge ordered her into custody,
making her bonds $1000, and the police
have sent for the girl's mother.

TURF GOSSIP
OF THE
PAST FEW DAYS.
It would Indeed be a treat to attend a'
sale of yearlings where every sale was a
bona-lide one. Anent the recent Macdon
ough sale of St. Carlo youngsters, where
the high average of nearly* $1000 was set
for the eleven head, the get of this prom
ising young sire disposed of, it is now:
gossiped about that the sale was a pad
ded one; that several of those which
brought phenomenally' big c prices have;
been simply â "farmed out" â a common'
practice resorted to nowadaysâ and that'
a major portion of their winnings on the
turf, if they prove successful 0 ,/ will find
its way back to the breeder. Breeders in
this part of the country are very apt to
prize horseflesh too highly. If a product
of their establishment c happens to turn i
out a crack colt or filly ,Â°as the case may.,
be, they expect' every yearling offered'
for sale by them "the coming spring-.. to 1 â¢
bring a fabulous figure /when led into,
the sale ring. Then, too; most, of the'
yearlings these times have been." tried
before being, catalogued, for the 1 market,.
and prospective .purchasers on the- Inside
receive the straight tip. The green one'
in the business is accorded the privilege
of bidding on those supposed â¢ to be. a
minus quantity. The Baldwin sale,--some
days ago, was a lizzie," and there- .is -.no-
reason why it- should have been.. other-;
wise. The. yearlings shown .were for- the
greater part the get of untried' "oÂ» un-
successful sires. Ihey were led into the'
.ring and acted like old campaigners
the selling turf, put up at au'eu-on 'after
having won a' race. People, like .to. specu
; late on tho uncertain, where, one- is": as.
apt to get a Hamburg. or a .lien/Brush.

English turf writers now ascribe much
of Tod Sloan's success in the saddle to
his experience' in getting away from 'the
barrier, an art the English jockeys are

country to discover that the Australian
was not impregnable was Henry Shields.
When the barrier was an early comer
here. Shields Invariably got his mount'
away in advance of the others, and
Sloan, not slow to perceive the trick,
quickly caught on and took his mount
back a length or so, with the result that
he was very often noted in the form
book as away first. This is not the only
caper probably that Tod showed his
cousins across the pond, for he went over

A WEEK OF SPORT
FLEET HOUNDS
AFTER
HEAVY PURSES.
. . The coursing men open the Now Year
at ingleside to-day with feelings of much
encouragement, enthusiasm and two ex
ceptional stakes. Their encouragement
arises from the fact that," With all the
great strides the sport.has taken during
the past twelve months, 1896 promises far
greater advancement. 'Their enthusiasm
is due not only to this but to the actual
evidence in hand, which evidence, is
shown in the increase of the purses of
fered to-day. The chief stakeâ if.suchlit
may be calledâ is an open all-age* event,
and to the total entrance money. jio less
than $200 has been added. The second
feature is a puppy sprint, and â¢to .this!
has been added $100. Never before in the
history of coursing on the coast" or in
America has the sport attained a" like
plane or anything approaching; it. Both'
stakes will be carried . through the run
down to-day and the ties run off. to
morrow. ..'--â  -'.â ;â  .Â° =. Â»*
-j Judging it from paper, the entry of both"
events to-day seems likely to develop
many surprises. At the same time. The
Call has "picked 'em" beforeâ two" weeks
ago "picked 'em ' all. The selections will
be found below for to-days run down. â¢
The Orient kennels will properly. , ob
serve the New Year by moving into, new'
quarters on Broadway, near Montgom

needs of their string have been in -course
.of construction for several weeks, and in

; The importance of careful handling and
scientific training of greyhounds was
never better exemplified than last Sun
day. It has long been recognized that
. the Curtis kennels of Santa Clara always
brought their dogs to the slips in condi
tion. They have always done so. Lately,
â too, they have employed McCaffery, late
of St. Louis, to aid them in training., and
â¢last Sunday they landed first and second
.money with Blackette, who has not won
a stake in many months, and Rosette,
.whose entry at all surprised many, : she
â¢ having been reported a sufferer with 'dis

GAME FISHES
IN THE
RUSSIAN RIVER.
Steelhead fishing in Russian River is
first class now. The bar at the river's
mouth was opened last Tuesday, and the
game' lishes have been running up tne
â river since then. As stated in yesterday's
Call, two Deputy Fish Commissioners
i three nets on Wednesday, and that
practically puts a stop to net-fishing in
the river for some time.
This morning a party of anglers will
leave here for Duncan's Mills, and, un
less a sudden change in the weather
takes place, good sport should result.
-\ : tiers who have not heretofore pros
: for steel heads on Russian River
should keep in mind, that the very best
of tackle is. indispensable. The reel is a
very important part of an angler's outiit.
It must be in tirst-class running order, as
frequently the fish run out from 50 to 100
yards of line, then leap into the air, scor
ing a double somersault, and sometimes
fr> eing themselves from punishment by
smashing a leader or line with a swift
slash of tlfe tail.
The steelhead* of Russian River are
exceedingly game, and consequently af
ford the lovers of angling grand sport.
In fishing with a spoon you must troll
d< i;> and just keep the boat moving.
When bait-fishing use large red flies
baited with cooked shrimp. A good
bunch of worms on a hook will sometimes
prove very killing.
During the last week or so W. R. Mc-
Farland and Al Wilson have had grand
sp.'rt on the Russian. MeFarland hooked
twenty-one fish and landed eighteen.
Wilson booked twenty-two and landed
twenty-ooÂ«, all on a leader made by him
self. iw> is still fishing- and enjoying
grand sport.
ihead fishing at Point Reyes will not
be *. i until something is -done to stop
the netting of fish at. the mouth of the
creek, and also the spearing of steelheads
by Indians and whites.

DUCK HUNTING
OVER
SALT MARSHES.
Since the arrival of the cold snap duck
shooting has been very pood on the east :
shores of the bay. Down about Mount
Eden and Alvarado hunters have been en
joying very good sport. In the salt ponds
where shooting is not prohibited large
bags of sprig, widgeon, spoonbill and teal
ducks have been made. The morning and
evening shooting is particularly good, as
the birds then fly from pond to pond,
thus affording t the "blind" sportsman an
opportunity to exercise, his muscles in gun
lifting and trigger ; pulling. jj â;; Â° â  Â°
J Last Sunday the -hunters who camped Â°
on the mudbanks of Midshipmans slough,
.longing and hoping for a chance to swing
their guns on fast-flying "cans," met
with disappointment. Karriey and Burns
were puzzled to know where the royal
birds had 1 taken wing, but when they
.figured upon the numbers of a ducks that
; have, been killed on Tubbs Island and
vicinity since the season opened they did
â¢ not wonder at Mr. Can's absence. . Â»
â  But the canvasbacks are on the north
east shores of the bay o in thousands* and
during sunlight they - , loaf . and sleep,
and when darkness sets in. they seek the
marshes and bay â¢ flats, where they wax
.fat on small, crabs and shellfish. â  â¢ "â¢ ,
V , A good stiff blow from the south is all
that is needed to drive the "cans" into the
marshes. But, then, duckshdoters can
not complain, as they have 1 had good
sport since the season opened. Â°"Â° *
The Blackjack Shooting Club expects
to enjoy first-class sport to-day, and to
morrow on the Sherman Island preserve.
Latest intelligence from Antioch is to the
effect that the ' birds were returning to
the ponds and that the outlook c f or good
up-river shooting was excellent. â¢ Â° zl
Sly, the crackajack" duck shot of An
tloch, defeated W. Remfree Jr. last Sun
day in a pigeon shoot. Sly made a clean
score," grassing twelve o birds. Romfree's
friends are of the opinion that c their fa
vorite had partaken too- liberally of Eng
lish plum pudding- and was to a slight
extent out of condition.
Two prominent members of the Black
Jack Club have challenged any two men
of Antioch to a live-bird shooting match.
Doubtless the defl will be accepted.
Henry Stelling of Davisville, who re
cently defeated Henry Ruhstaller of
Sacramento in a 100-bird pigeon race,
has issued a challenge to Otto Feudner
of E. T. Allen Company. The challenge
has been accepted on condition that the
challenging party shall post a forfeit.
i-eudner wants a 100-bird match, the
shoot to take place near this city on any
of the club grounds. â¢ , . . J
The Sportsman's Club of Uklati is de
serving of unstinted praise for the good
work it has been accomplishing in the
way of game protection. Recently the
president of the club was Informed that
market hunters had been slaughtering
deer for their hides, and he lost little
time in unearthing the camping grounds
of the poachers and bringing them to
justice, as the following letter to the
sporting editor will attest:
c â¢ >, â, o UKIAH, Dec. 29, 1597.
Sporting Editor Call: The Sportsman's
Club of Lkiah, consisting of its best citi
zens, including every prominent -attor
ney in town, has succeeded in apprehend
ing four men north of Ukiah in the
vicinity â¢of Sanhedrin Mountain, wan
tonly slaying deer, regardless of age or
sex, , and by continued, zeal and energy
the club found witnesses to the depreda
tions. â¢ .warrants of arrest were sworn
out and constables sent to bring the men
in. One law-breaker was found with a
doe actually across his shoulder. The
four .poachers were brought into Ukiah
and placed in jail, and on a hearing be
;fore the Justice they pleaded guilty and
were hned $50 each.
If ; the sportsmen of other towns where
the game laws are being constantly vio-
. lated -were as determined to enforce the
law as the gentlemen of the Ukiah
bportsmens Club there would not be
much use for the State Fish and Game
Commission,, which really does not pre
tend to enforce the lawâ that is so far

WHEELMEN NOT
AFTER
CENTURY RUNS.
It is evident that the average road-rac
ing cycler of nowadays prizes very light
ly the heretofore coveted honor of ac
complishing the first century ride of each
successive year. ''
In years gone by it has been the wont
of a large number of sturdy road riders
to start at midnight on New Year's eve
and cover the relay course of 100 miles
laid out by the California Associated
Cycling Clubs, from this city to San Jose
and back to Alameda on the other side
of the bay. He who finished first was
proclaimed the rider of the first century
of that year. Many strove for the honor,
let the weather be what it might, and on
stormy occasions from twelve to twenty
hours' plugging through mud and rain
have been required, to â¢ the ruination of
one's wheel and the jarring of his con
stitution.
J Note the "lessening interest this year.
But five men have announced their inten
tions of making the trial. They are
"Trilby" Fowler, Bay City Wheelmen; L.
H. Smith and J. H. Nash, Olympics; F.
Jugwetz, Acme, and M. G. Curti?, Ala
meda. And yet the weather is perfect
and the roads all that could be desired.
I expected there would .be a list of halt
a hundred. â¢
L. 11. Smith, one of the Olympics' best
road riders, explained to me his reason"
for not taking much interest in the ride.
"What's the use?" he said. "You get- no
credit for it. Last year I rode what
â afterward proved to be . the- first century
made in the United States in 1897. It was
made under V trying conditions, through
mud and slush, and I turned up at the
clubhouse" on Post street dead to the â¢
= world. Did they toss me a laurel wreath .
and praise me for it? Not much. Cap
tain Hadenfeidt said I was a fool for
making such an. ass of myself; that I'
would have been better off home In bed. .
And he was ti... captain of my club.
"Well, I wouldn't have minded that so
much, until I heard that 'Trnby'. Fowler,
who made almost as good time as I did,
went around "â  to the Bay City Club, of.
which he was not even a member, and
they made a lion of him and praised him
to the skies for his great ride. If I
make the ride this year it will be for my
own satisfaction and not for club glory."
I don't think the ' Olympics thoroughly
appreciated the merits of Launcelot
Smith's ride at the time or until after it
was too late to properly recognize it, for
they are always mindful of worthy per-,
formances on Â° the part of .their racing
men and reward them accordingly. For .'
instance, only last Tuesday night Ed !
Kragness was presented with a beautiful
gold watch for his century record of 5 :
hours IS minutes, arid Kragness, Nash
and Loos o received gold medals for their
o triplet record made at the "' Olympic meet
at the Velodrome October 3 last. So you
see in Mr. Smith's case it was apparently
an oversight.- 0^ . Â« â¢"â = V "-- â¢ ":, ' â¢â¢" â¢'â -" â¢
The Encinai Cyclers of Alameda 'will
entertain the board of governors of the
C. A. C. C. for the first time next Satur
day night. The clubrooms-are located in
the second story of the building formerly
occupied by the Alameda Public Library,
on the west side of Park .street, be
tween Santa. Clara and Central avenues,
about equidistant from .both the broad .
and narrow gauge railroad lines.' Pas
sengers'should- alight at Park street (the .
= station, bears the = c same name on both â 
lines)' and in the case of the broad
gauge it marks the terminus of the road.
Delegates should- take the 7:30 narrow
gauge boat from this side, as most of
the officials will go over at that time. .
- There promises to be a "hot time" at
this meeting ; over the Kraft matter,
there" seeming to be an inclination on the
part of the delegates to reverse their ac
tion of last meeting * reinstating him.
Inconsistent as it may seem in the face
of such action, however, there Is a de- "
cided feeling that Birdsall and Theisen
and Percy Mott should be reinstated. â¢ â¢
Arthur' C. Thornton, who was captain
of the Olympic Club Wheelmen for two .
terms and who has lately had his head
quarters at Portland, is in the city for
the holidays, renewing old acquaintances.
"Ike" says it rains; too much up there to
make good wheeling at this season of the
year. ....... .* ' ". i -.-.-f--v--j-

Lloyd Conkling, who took Sharick, Jones
Whitman and "Trilby" Fowler to Hono

had considerable trouble. Conkling
worked hard for the interests of his men,
securing them concessions ati-i advan
tages which his experience had taught "â 
him, and even going so far as to rub
down Sharick for all his races. Instead â¢
of rewarding him, Conkling writes that
"he skipped out of town, leaving several
bills behind and saying I would settle
He also told around town that Desky and
I had beat him out of $100. Now, Desky â¢
is the best sort of a man, and has done
everything in his power to make us com
fortable and happy. He has done every
thing he promised, and more, too. I had
to commence suit against Jones yester
day for what he owes me." â¢ â â â¢
Desky is the owner of the Cyclomere :
track at Honolulu, who took the profes
sional riders down there. Sharick and
Fowler have returned, and Conkling
Jones and Whitman will stay. Conkling
says in his letter that Fowler treated him
all right and that Whitman Is as square
as a die. Sharick has escaped Kirn by
leaving, but he is going to stop Jones'
passport if he â¢ attempts to leave â¢ the
islands until Allan squares up with c him "

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MTUHBAY, JANUARY 1, 1898.
A GAVEL TAP
BRINGS DISMAY
Chairmaii Moserop Sud
: dtefUly Enciis the Drum
mers' Trial.
Scores a " Prosecutor" and
Calls the Proceedings
: "Disgusting."
VVith Certain Recommendations a
Verdict of Acquiital Expected.
Spicy Repartee.
"We have heard enough of this kind
of evidence. What has been brought
before us is disgusting:, and the matter
might as -well end here."
With these sententious words Chair
man Moscrop brought to an untimely
close the proceedings so far instituted
against those members of the Califor
nia Commercial Travelers' Association
who stand accused of endeavoring to
disrupt the San Francisco commercial
travelers. It now looks as if the ver
dict to be brought in by the investi
gating committee at the meeting of the
latter organization next Tuesday will
be one of complete exoneration from
the charges preferred by President
Dunn against the "famous eight."
Thursday evening's session of the
investigating committee was replete
with sensations. At a previous meet
ing Mr. Grilling had testified that he
was informed by another member that
Jumts K. T. Mershon and Henry
l-ichtenstein were the men who hud
furnished The Call with the informa
tion which led to the court of inquiry.
A firm stand was taken against the
introduction of this testimony as evi
dence on the ground that it was hear
say evidence, but it was agreed that
the testimony might go if Mr. Gritting
would admit who was his informant.
He refused, bat Thursday evening
said it was Sherman T. Blake.
When iilake was placed on the stand
he admitted that he had heard the
thing to be true, but in turn refused to
say who had told him. On being cross
examined, he admitted that he had
"given away" some things happening
at a session of the San Francisco
Travelers in his eagerness to pre
judice the cause of the accused
men. Then it was thai Chairman Mos
crop, whose eminent fairness is ques
tioned in no particular, remarked that
he would be surprised to hear of any
member doing this, but in the case of
an ex-pres;cient like Blake he thought
it especially questionable.
At another time Dunn referred to
the "positive evidence" introduced as
regards the publication in The Call.
when the chairman corrected him with
the statement that all the "proof" so
far introduced had been denied by the
Interested p> r?Â»ns and had generally
come from an unreliable source.
Over thirty members of the Pacific
::miercial Travelers' Assocla
tion have applied for membership in
the "inner circle" as a sign that they
have the moral support of the strong
est organization of its kii.d in the
State.
The Retail Grocers' Advocate has
als â < come out warmly In th-Â»ir favor,
and in general term? has characterized
the charges with reference ti Dunn by
saying that they were preferred by

A REVIEW OF THE CENTURY.
Dr. Vborsanaer Delivers an iQterr
.: . estirjg Lecture oq 1898.
Dr. Voorsanger's lecture at the Tem
ple Emanu-El last night was entitled
â "1898," but it could have been easily
called "1798," for he dwelt more par
ticularly on the past than, the future.
He commenced his lecture by saying
that the remarks he was about to
make had been suggested to him by
the dawning of the year 1898. "The
future," he said, 'is being influenced
a great deal by. the foundations we are
now making. Take for instance the
past hundred years. . Some one has
said that more history has been made
and written in the. last century than
for the past. 6oo years, and It Is so, but
the causes that made the changes have
been accumulating for. ages."; He. then
reviewed the historical events of the
past years, and spoke of the advance
ment that has been made in all things/
particularly religion. ... .;â â :..

Doekery Will Look

They May Cause Trouble

Scientists Blame Oysters for
the Recent Glasgow
Epidemic.
DR. CLINTON IS ALARMED.
On Information He Received Abroad
the Board of Health Will
Act.
Moses in his wisdom forbade his
people to eat of those living creatures
of the sea that nature had left bereft
of fins and scales. The philosophy of
that law is at this late day just begin
ning to be appreciated by the scien
tists in this most se4entinc age since
human nature began to remold and
reconstruct a planet that once was an
appalling wilderness. In consequence
he that traps unhealthy shrimps must
suffer. Dockery within the next few
days will turn his thoughts from milk,
sardines and beef-fat butter and con
fine his knowledge to the creeping,
bearded crustaceans of the briny deep,
that from the healthy he may separate
the diseased and place within the firm
grasp of the law those who profit from
the latter kind.
Dockery's efforts to force from tlu
market shrimps that before their de
mise were ailing from various causes
will be under the direction of the
' Board of Health. This plan to further
insure the health of San P^rancisco'b
people hfcs been determined upon since
: the return of Dr. Clinton from hiÃ trip
j abroad. While in England Dr. Clinton
learned that an epidemic of typhoid
fever was raging in Glasgow, and that
' the scientists were making strenuoup
efforts to ascertain the cause of the
pr-valence of the ofttimes fatal dis
, ease. Prior to leaving England the
physician learned that the scientiFts
bad < "inpleted their investigations ana
had placed the blame on that luseiou>
, bivalve the oyster. Quantities of oys
ters were found reeking with the
germs of typhoid fever, and they were
lemned and destroyed. Shortly
after this action was taken the disease
bewail to loosen its hold upon the peo
ind it Mil soon stamped out.
This experience caused Dr. Clinton
to determine that a like result should
not exist in San Francisco if it could
if avoided, and on his return he began
.his investigations. The physician
found that shrimps reared nnd tak. i,
, from the bay in the neighborhood of
the San Bruno road were white and
mushy, diseased and disease-breeding.
More research along the same line
demonstrated the fact that the. most
edible, by reason <>f vigorous health,
came from San Pablo Bay, where -each
change of tide brought them fresh
water and food. The shrimps along
the Ban Bruno road found sustenance
alone on the foul refuse of vari >us
hone works, sundry soap factories and
rha.ny 'butchering-places. There was
not hing healthy or. calculated to even
arpease the appetite of a hungry
shrimp. In consequence the creatures
became unhealthy arid perhaps may be
responsible, for a. great deal of illness
among: those who consumed them.
No cases of disease have as yet been
directly traced to the shrimp, but in
vestigations may prove that they have
been responsible for many an illness
and many deaths. In any Â«vent dis
eased shrimps will -he kept out of the
market, and, even though they may
not be t^ie allies of "tti& reaper," they
shall not be placed where they can as
sist him, as he wields his sickle of
death.

MUST HAVE A TRIAL.
Minors Carrot Be Arbitrarily Sent
to the Whittier School.
By a decision rendered yesterday by
the Supreme Court the statutes rela- ,
tive to sending minors to the Whittier
Rf form School were practically de
clared unconstitutional. Section 13 <>f
the act of March, 18Â»3, relating to the
Whlttjer State School, amended sec^
lion 17. This amendment provided that
an accusation tit. the commission of a
crime by a minor under .18 years of
age presented to the Grand Jury may
by that body be dealt with in this man
ner: Instead of finding an indictment
against the â '.'â¢ offender; an information
should be presented' to the Superior
Court; The latter tribunal, upon being
satisfied that the information is cor
rect and that the accused is a suitable
person to be sent to the Whittier
School, may order a commitment to
that institution, and examination mji&
be waived by the offender's parents or
guardians. :
Johnnie Beeknell, 13 years of age, of
Merced County, was committed in such
a manner, the Grand Jury and the Su
perior Court being satisfied that he
was guilty of .the crime of burglary.
The boy'B parents objected and peti
tioned the Supreme Court for a writ
of habeas corpus. That tribunal grant
ed the writ and ordered the discharge
t>f the lad, holding that a minor cannot
be imprisoned as a criminal without a
trial by jury.
ITALIANS CELEBRATE.

happy and full of fun and merriment.
The affair was exclusively for the
members of the Garibaldi Guard Mu

the sons and daughters of sunny Italy.

THE COAL TRADE.
REVIEW OF THE PAST TEAR AND PROS
PECTS FOR THIS.
The annual circular of J. W. Harrison thus
review? the coal trade in :- â ?:
The fuel consumption of California this
Is about 7 per cent greater than in 1596,
which evidences that the outgoing year has
bees a fatrly profitable one for some of our
ir.a nuf acturiiig branches. Consumers were fa
vored with low priced coal the first half of
this year, hut the IMngley tariff went into ef-
f fi t in July, causing an advance on all grades
e>jual to the change of the duty: this change
cuts a small figure with housekeepers and
Email consumers, but it is serious detriment to
those industries where fuel is the principal
factor In their expense account. Coal freights
trim Australia and Great Britain have ruled
high for several months past, thus aiding to
sustain full figures, as our coast colliery man
agers regulate their scale of prices by the im
port cost of Colonial and Knplish; hence th^
year has proved a very pr ritable one for our
Northern coal fields. It is a query how the
local coal market will shape itself in 1SS8;
there is no doubt as to the ability of British
Columbia and Washington to fully supply us
with all the fuel we may need, in case for
eign shipments should diminish, but the ear
marks are visible of probable labor troubles
when the Klondike exodus commences, and the
writer predicts that all grades of laborers will
catch! the fever. Even If no trouble emanates
' from that source, there will certainly. â¢ be a ;
spkrsity of vessels for ; transporting coal, !as
they will assuredly drift into the' more profita
ble 'business of carrying freight and passen- ;
gers toward the Alaskan gold fields. , It .is true
this will last for only a few months, : but of
: sufficient duration to materially, affect ; fuel
values . within that : brief period. Prudential
managers should provide against such contin
gencies; a lack of foresight is . sometimes
costly... : - '.â ..-â â -â  â -.':. . ,â â 'â  --.- ; : : " ; r- ;:r -â ; :.: â .â¢;â :':.:â¢..

BANK CLEARINGS IN' 1897.
THEY SHOW A MARKED INCREASE OVER
THOSE IX ISM.
Local bank clearings this week were $15,
171,627, against H2.66t.ttl for the same week in
IK. For the month of December they were
$71,119,761, against $61.627,7!Â»6 in December, 1896.
For the year IS'.<7 they- were $750,789,144, against
$653.22'J,5!Â«9 in 18%.
THE BROKERS DEFIED THE BOARD.
The edict of the directors of the Produce
Exchange that the brokers should not be al
lowed to celebrate the close of the year wfth
bombs and firecrackers was utterly disregarded
yesterday, for after the sample session was :
over the fun broke out in several places and
pandemonium ensued. The usual crowd was
attracted to the spot by the uproar and :
smoke, and for an hour or so that part of town !
was the noisiest quarter of the city. A $20
fine is apparently nothing to a Produce Ex
change broker.
COINAGE OF THE MINT.
The, coinage of the local mint for the year
IM'7 shows an increase of nearly $4,000,000.
The total pold coined was $33,522,500, of
which $29,405,000 were double eagles, $2,347,500
in eagles and $1,770,000 in half eagles.
Toe total silver coinage was $6,561,791.65. of
which $5,825,000 were standard dollars. $466,950
half-dollars, $135,557.25 quarter-dollars, and
JK14, 284.40 dimes, making a total of gold and
silver, $40,084,291.65.
WOOL TRADE LAST YEAR.
Robert J. Morrison gives the Wool crop of
California last year at 32,534,230 pounds, the
smallest production since 1887 except in 1896,
when it fell to 27,195,550 pounds. The spring
clip was If), 163,030 pounds, the fall clip 11.175,-
MB, and there was 2,195,640 pounds of pulled
wool. The stock on hand December 31 is given
at 8,000,900 i>ounus. The exports were over
29,000,000 pounds.
SALMON PACK IN 1597
The pack of salmon on this coast In 1537 is
given by a local trade journal at 2,929,200 cases,
against about 2,300.000 cases in 1896, distributed
as follows: Alaskan, 556.800; British Colum

by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually

been replenished by additional amounts on this
account each day of the week, and although '
rates for money have been pretty : stiff, there!
has been no stringency. The hardening .of ex

The â¢ Government . has deposited. In"- New ' York ;
banks over $33,000,000 of the Union Pacific pay
merits. It is not Intended to draw upon any
â¢of this for ; the Government's January â¢ inter-- :

thus, offsetting the final payment of the Union
Pacific syndicate, which comes due on : Jah-i' '

The Government deposits will be left in New I
York banks until they desire to surrender^
them, â  which, in the natural course of things
will be as soon as the money market shows
a tendency to become easier. The season's
enormous trade balance In our favor has left
us large credits abroad, which are available
resources in the event of any great need here. ;
But- this balance has been' modified by the re- I
ceipts in San Francisco since August X of $11.- ,
8-0.000 in gold from Australia, which largely

REVIEW OF THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dec. 31â Bradstreefs Financial
Review will nay to-morrow: Aside fnm the
activity of some of the local stocks there has
been little in the market entitled to descrlD
tion. "
A holiday feeling prevailed throughout and
in the ; early portion of the week the contin
uance of slightly higher rates for call loans
and the fear that a flurry might occur in the
money market before New Year's day tended
to still further restrict trading. Lortdon has
sold a little stock. â â  but , the market there was
utterly inactive on account of the firmness of
money and the possibility. of foreign complica
tions in connection with the Chinese situa
tion. Our own . public has been indifferent to
the stock market, and commission houses were
lit no time prominent in the transactions. Pro
fessional operators^ were to some extent influ
enced by the extreme dullness, and s.lline of
long stock by such interests caused some con
cessions in prices. On > such ; occasions, . how
ever, the belief, that -a' better market is liable
to develop with the New Year asserted Itself

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 31. -It was a typical holiday
market in Wheat. Notwithstanding the lact
that it was settlement day, the session marked
the close of one of the most gigantic deals in
actual Wheat on record, there was not a
trace of excitement either in the cash article
or in the speculative futures. May Wheat was
Quite linn at the opening, starting VÂ»c higher
The feature of the early firmness was the sur
prising strength shown by L,ivÂ«rpool which
showed '-d advance. Some of the strength too
was carried over from yesterday's war scare'
After a little show of activity around the open
ing the market oegan tv feel the effect of the
holiday spirit and became exceedingly dull it
is calculated that the entire amount ot con
tract grade wheat lb now 9.000,wu bushels
There were no shipments of Wheat from Ar'
gentina this week. Beerbohm estimated tuat in
consequence ot having imported earlier in the
season in excess of immeuiate consumptive re
quirements, the weekly needs of foreign Wheat
and Flour in Kurope for the remainder of the
season would be 6,960,uu0 bushels and telcu
lated that the available surplus in exporting
countries to the end of the crop year would n-t
come within 1,000,000 bushels a week of sun
plying the requirements. The exports from the
Atlantic ports were again surprisingly Ulmt.il
equal to 657.U00 bushels. me market became
stronger on tills. May advancing to iÂ»3\ic
About 1 o'clock the price was down to 9"uÂ«j
92>4c on liberal offerings. There strength again
developed and in the last few minutes' trad

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Dec. 31.â Bradstreet's . to-mor
row wl>!-say: Holiday quiet and stock taking
close a : year which while not fully realizing
the ;< most â  sanguine v expectations, certainly
contained much that was gratifying and more
that is full of promise for the year 1898. Fol
lowing a series of years ' of alternate panic,
stagnation and slow and. even painful revival!
1597 presented a large volume of bust tiers, done
as a whole at prices which, - while not alto
gether satisfactory, resulted in a total of trade
larger ' than . in â¢ any â¢ previous â¢ year - since ' 1592.
Tariff " changes restricted demand but . encour
aged speculation and heavy; imports in . the
first part of 1897, while I the enlarged foreign
demand for American breadstuff* and for some
varieties of manufactured articles bettered thÂ»
condition of the' American farmer and. there

.. NEW YORK. -;b*^.- 31.â The Financier say's:'
The statement! of the ' associated: banks of
New York city far the' week ending. December
31 Is an argument In favor of easier- money
.rate*;".. the . banks,"' since December 24. : have
: gained -â  in cash $5,746,200; and . their net â¢â  de-.
. posits: have, expanded nearly $6,000.600... Asth*.
gains In- cash â¢ and deposits | were almost iden
tical; the reserve has* increased in proportion;
that is, it is about' 75 per â¢ cent .of the- total
cash expansion. The' result is that the mar
gin .of excess reserve has been . Increased
$4,2"65,300-, and at the close of the week stood
aC .$15,788,750. In view of v this showing all
fear of stringency over the close of the year
must be dismissed. During, the next week the
Union Pacific committee will make another
$8,000,000 payment into the Treasury, and
there is no likelihood that it will have any
more effect on the market- than Mast week's
settlement of a. similar amount caused. This
will end a transaction which had an import
ant bearing on money ' affairs â  for ' some time,
and a normal period will 'succeed it.

CLARA'S NEW
YEAR'S GIFT
Found JSTot Guilty of the
Killing of Charles
Ladue.
The Dead Boy's Mother Vows
That She Will Be
. Revenged.
The Girl Says the Verdict la Just What
*m';:-. She Expected From
the First.
Oaicland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 31.
Clara Fallmer, the 16-year-old al
leged murderess of Charles Ladue, was
found not guilty of the crime by a
jury this afternoon.
This morning Attorney Prick resum
ed his argument* and was followed by
District Attorney Melvin, who cJoiidd
for the prosecution. In Mr. Metvin's
remarks he referred to the preju
dicing of the jury by the court in the
ease of Frank Thompson, whom Judpre
Ogden had ordered arrested for an al
leged felony while giving his testi
mony; Mr. Melvin said he did r.ot
wish to criticize the court, but he
would say that no court couM ;â !
thie prerogative of the jury U in.- s-.i
judges of the evidence. They had that
privilege and they alone could pass
upon it, and they would weierh it
without interference from the qaatii&e.
He said. he did not wish th.- jury to
find the prisoner guilty of murd.r in
the first degree witli capital punish
ment. He Would be satisfi.t l w 1 1 h . a
v.rdi-t carrying imprisonment for life.
If the jury saw fit It could brfng in a
veTdkt with lesser punishment, but
that the prisoner was entitled to pun
ishment was unquestionable.
Judge Ogden in charging the jury
said: "Insanity is a disprdered or a
diseased mind from disease or defect
of the brain. It is a condition in
which the intellectual faculties or
moral sentiments, or both of them,
have their free action destroyed by
ilisease. Insanity '.'&&. ; ' recognized in this
State means such at disease and <1 â¢â 
ranged condition of the mental facul
ties as to render the person incapable
CLARA FALLMER Listened Intent y to the Charge of Judge Ogden.
of distinguishing between right iand
wrong in relation to t.hie 'â¢: acts with
which he or she is charged; in trials
for crime the defense 'of. insanity is
often interposed, and "thereby . be
comes a subject of paramount Im
portance in criminal jurisprudence. A
due regard for the endi of justice and
the peace and welfare of society, no
U'PK than of mercy to the accused, re
quires that it should be thoroughly and
carefully weighed. It is a plea some
times resorted to where aggravated
crimes have been committed under
such circumstances as afford full proof
of the overt act, rendering hopelCM all
other means of avoiding punishnn-nt.
While I do not desire to be understood
as intimating that the cans* at bar
is one of the cases coming within this
category, yet because of this act the
defense must be carefully scrutinized.
"This defendant is charged with
murder, and her character for virtue
Is not in issue, except as it throws
light upon her mental condition at the
time the fatal shot was fired, and all
testimony introduced with reference to
her character for virtue will bo con
sidered by you for no purpose except
as tending, if it does so lend, to throw
light upon her mental condition at the
time she fired the fatal shot. What
ever the character of this defendant
may be, if she was insane when she
fired the fatal shot you should find her
not guilty."
The Jury retired, and in about half
an hour returned into court with a
verdict of not guilty. The verdict was
received with some applause by the
[obby.
Mrs. La.due, the mother of the mur
dered boy, was exceedingly agitated
when the verdict was announced, and
openly stated that she would have re
venge for the death of her son if it
took her twenty years. A gentleman
close by her said that he heard her
remark that nothing but the girl's life
would satisfy her.
Clara Fallmer, her mother, father
and sisters after the trial went to the
County Jail followed by a large crowd.
They went to the eel) thfe girl had re
cently occupied, where she rigged htpr
self out in a new dress, packed up her
personial ieffetts and went home.
To a Call reporter . Clara Falliher
said: "The verdict is just what I ex
pected right along.. 1 certainly did
hot know what I was doirig at the
time." One of her attorneys, ,. -George
Reed, said that it is a fact tt^at she
took the gun tdr the purpbse of trying
to kiM herself, which she attempted to
do after the murder of Ladue. and it
could also be proved that earlier in
the day of the murder she bought
poison with the same intenti

MISS TRELEASE SPEAKS.
QAKLAND, Dec; 31.â Miss Mary
Treleaae, . who hÂ«s : been frequeritly :
mentioned in connection; /with a recent
City Hall \vedding; made the following
statement to-day:
"Seeing the statements made In the
papers about me in connection with
the Hall case, I wish to deny them* In
the fiitet place, I did not furnish the
money for the marriage license. It is
true, I handed it to the clerk at the
I City Prison, but the money belonged
|to Hall. It had been In my hands for
I some time, and when he had need of
I the f2 I took it to him and gave him the
remaining $4 when he was released. I
wish to deny that I held any confer
' ence with Harry Hall while he was in
prison. I did not even see him in the
i prison, and I never stated that I in
tended to have a voice in the matter
and did not request to be present at
the wedding, but wan mvlted in by the
Captain of Police. The statement was
also made that It was possible that I
would marry him after he obtained a
: divorce. I wish to state that Ido not
j intend to marry Harry Hall at any
\ time."
OBJECTS TO THE BONDS.
OAKLAND, Dec. 31.â Suit has been
filed against the Fruitvale School Dis
trict and E. E. Hunt. R. B. Bain and
F. Herrold, the trustees of the same,
by N. A. Acker, a taxpayer, to restrain
the board from disposing of the recent
issue of bonds. He alleges that the de
fendants threaten to sell bonds which,
if ..hey are sold, will place a cloud upon
the title of his land and embarrass
him in his attempt to sell the same.
He claims that the bonds will be a lien
upon his property and keep him from
using it as security. District Attorney
Snook has filed his answer, denying
that the sale would work the hardship
complained oi, or any other hardship.

i\ : , BEKEL.EY. Dec. 3i.-^President Mar^ ;=
tin Kellogg has set .his foot down em
phatically against Sunday football by
: any eleven purporting to represent the [
University of California. The president â¢â¢;
learned this morning : that - ;i the team
which left to-day for Fresno to play
with the Fresno ' Athletic Club to-mor
row, while â  organized '; as the Peerless
. team, was being advertised as the Uni
versity of ; California eleven, : ; and : ; had .-,

I President Kellogg immediately wrote
to Regent Chester Rowell of Fresno
asking him to. see Manager Allen of me
: football' team- and. warn him against
: representing the eleven as a university
: aggregation. '"Sunday contests are not
allowed upon the college campus," said
the president in explanation of hii ac- â â :
tion, "and we shall use every effort to
prevent any organization from enter-
I ing a; Sunday contest as a represehta- .
tive of the university.
"The question of whether it Is right
or wrong to engage in Sunday athletic
contests is not involved 'directly," con
tinued President Kellogg. ultu lt is the
use of the university name that is ob-
Jectlwnable. Sunday football played by
' a college organization would alienate
from us the support of a large body of
the best people of the State.
! "Eastern universities have had sfmi
[ lar troubles athletic teams and
I Other organizations which usurp the;
college name. A football team; from
Yale traveled through the South last
year, and its actions did anything but
reflect credit upon the university.
"While as Individuals the football
men have a right to play on Sunday :
if they choose, they will not be allcwed
to scandalize the respectable people of
the State and bring the college into
disrepute by playing on Sunday as a
'University of California football
team.' " :â '"â â  7 '.- v.â  â . /"-..'.â  '.â¢â¢â¢â  â '.'"â ':'.' '."
[ r The football players cornposinJK the
teanv in question left San Francisco on .
the: Stockton boat this evening. They
will arrive in Fresno tpTm.or.row: morn
ing. The players who compose th 3
team are as.fojlows: P. H. I>unbar,
center; H. LÂ». Cornish and 'T.. McX>er
mott> guards; Paul Casteihun (captain)
ahd !F. E.Dfckson. tackles; R. N.
Baugh and N. Thompson, ends; R. \V.
Bender, quarter; F. R. Ellis and J.
Hopper, halves; P. G. Allen (manager),
fullback; J. A. McGee and O. Wolf,
substitutes.
Should the football players refuse to
heed the president's warning: they will
probably be severely dealt with by the
university authorities. President Kel
lopff stated to-day that in such an
event the faculty would meet and take
action in regard to the matter.

eron:has only lived with her husband
one day since they were married, about
three years ago, and the testimony of
the suit is tinged with: romance, de
spite its sorry nature. .: \
Mrs. Cameron was first heard of four
years ago, when as Miss Gunther she
was found in a paroxysm of grief at
her mother's grave in Mountain View,
after being missed for a couple of
days. Some time later, while Elwood
Cameron was still a minor, he was
married to Miss Gunther, but the day
after the marriage he deserted hen A
child was born some time afterward,
and when only two days old it died,
and the father called to see it in its
coffin at the Chabot Home.
About a year ago a sister of Cam
eron was married t0 ..-.'-a young attorney
at the First Presbyteriah Church, and
Mrs; Lottie Gameron and her husband
hoped that a. reconciliation could be
effected, but the filing of divorce papers
a few weeks ago proved that the hope
was not fulfilled. Cameron has noth
ing to suppport his wife, who has been
earning Tier own living in a shirtmak
lng establishments â ;â¢;
The only occasions on which Mr. and
Mrs. Cameron met were at their wed
ding, at their child's funeral and at
the marriage of his sister. ; \

WAS NOT HIS ATTORNEY.
Reuben Kj- Lloyd Deoics paving
Acted in Trjat Capacity for
Vulicevich.
The Htnteim-nt that Kouben H. Uojrd
acted as counsel for Mark Ynlieevii h.
tlie man who appeared before Jink'-
Campbell Oil Thursday for a warrant
for the well-known attorney's arrest.
la I mistake. Mr. l.loyd never artod
as his attOfney, but did represent the
estate of John lv.nu uvi, h. against
which Yulicovich had a olaim for slan
der.
Slander being â  "tort," the ri^ht of
action died with the individual, and
therefore no claim could he maintained
aK'iin^t Hie estate. The claim was
handed back t>Â« Mr. dndwohi, his at
torney, who acknowledged th-- rejec
tion as correct Subsequently Byron
Waters appeared for Mr. Vulicevlch,
and on in\ -est igat ins the claim arrived
at the same opinion.
But in the meantime, says Mr.
l.loyd. Yulieevitch be, ame unbal
anced in his mind and imamn-d
.\ct\bod\ w.is trying Ib wrong him.
He lit upon Mr. l.lo\d as one of those
who were keepittg him out 6f his lust
rights. He frequently visited the law
yers otlice and became so aiin>yinp
that he had to be ordered <>ut. llence
the attempi to have Mr. l.loyd arrest
ed for battery.

CANNOT SHIP
TO THE ORIENT
Fourteen Thousand Bales
of Raw Cotton Await
ing Steamer Space.
Heavy Shipments of Flour De
layed to Facilitate Transpor
tation of Cotton.
Stflria of Industrial Activity in Japan.

A fact nlgrniflcant of the industrial
activity of Japan comes to light in con
nection with the demand for steamer
s|i:u Â«â  on tin- ships of the Pacllle Mail
and O. & O. Steamship compani.-s.
There is now so much cotton from
Texas In San Francisco awaiting ship
ment to the Orient that heavy .ship
ment r of Hour destined for the same
market cannot obtain steamer space.
TÂ£e quantity of cotton at present (n
the i fty warehouses and in cars on this
bide ami across the buy amounts to
H,oim> hales, each bale containing fÂ»00
pounds. To v New Orleans merchant
this would seem to be a small lot, but
is sullii nut to indicate an increasin-;
<i. niaiid from Japan. The cotton spiu
ii' rs of Japan use the American pro
duct nlonK with cotton gyOjWU in India
and shipped from Bombay. Formerly
it was the custom to ship piece goods
to Japan, but now the raw cotton
goes there and the piece goods are sent
t-' * 'hina.
U. I*. Sehwerln. viee-prcsi<lent and
K'lieral niiinaÃtT of the I'acitn- M.ul
Steamship Company, says it is a fact
that Hour shipments have been delayed
by reason of the demand for s^ace to
carry the cotton, but he fancies that
the delay is only temporary. His re
cent visit to the Orient and the obser
vations which he there made convinced
him that Shanghai was takiiiK thÂ« lead
in the manufacture of cotton X"'"l- S - As
Japan was accepting a gold basis the
indications were that the Japanese
would not be able to compete In the
markets of the K.ist with the Cheap
production* of China. The present ac
tlvlty in the shipment of cotton from
Texas to the Orient indicates to Mi.
Bchwertn that growera in this conn*
ti\ arc anxious to jret their products
to market and receive as e.uiy as pos
sible bills of exchange in payment of
the articles sold.
All sinns indicate n great quicken
ing 0! the commercial relations be
tween San Francisco and ports of
Asia. It is not settled that the fleet*
of the Pacific Mail and the ( Â». a. <>. will
be enlarged to meet the Increasing de
mands for transportation. The fact
is accepted thai the new Oriental
Steamship Company, a line establish. -Â» 1
by the Japanese, will have ships m the
trade by the Ist of next S, pteiiib.r.
The population of Japan now ap
proximates MrOOO.OOQ inhabitants. Pro
press in all departments >>!" industrial
development is noted by students and
travelers. The advance of Japan In
what is commonly called civilization
lims ci'-ated amonp the people of tha*
country new demands and d. sires for
articles in i-vi-rj -day use throughout
America and Bttrope, hence Japan has
not >et fairly entered the markets of
the world as an active competitor
against the English and German man*
ui'acturcrs. So much energy is em
ployed to meet the home demands that
gtea.l attention is not turned to the
manufacture >>f fabrics for export.

The above named members of the
Police pepartment â¢will be placed on
the retired list at the next meeting of
the Pension Commissioners. The Com
missioners will hold their regular quar
terly meeting on next Monday, when
the men whose names are on ihe
"slate" "will be asked to resign. They
will then be placed on the retired list
and allowed to draw the pensions al
lowed them by the Legislature.
Among those who will be retired the
best known, probably, is Sergeant
Shields. He has been a member of,
the Police Department for over twenty
years, and is held in high esteem by
Chief Lees and the members of the
commission. For a long time he acted
as patrol sergeant, and made a oni
liant record. As old age began to tell
on him he was transferred to the City
Prison, where he acted as booking ser
geant. Several months ago Captain
Robinson, who has charge of the City
Prison, preferred charges against hirri
on the ground that he was physically
unable to attend to his duties. .He
â¢was tried by the Police Commissioners
and acquitted. As it was apparent
that there was a feeling existing be
tween Shields and the captain of the
prison, the Commissioners decided to
transfer the former to the North End
station, where he has been doing duty
ever since. It is understood that he
has requested the Commissioners to
add his name to the pension list. Ser
geant Martin has been a member of the
department for a long number of years.
He is at present acting as hack in
spector. Always courteous and .kind,
he has endeared himself to every .mem
ber of the department, and it will be
â with regret that they learn of th? Com
missioners' intention to retire him. Mar
tin is over 60 years of tge, and bears
an excellent reputation as a polt^e ser
geant. He will, in all probability, foe
succeeded by Owen Gorman, wh > for
a number of years has served th^ de
partment in the capacity of assistant
hack inspector. Gorman now tanks
as corporal of police.
Sergeant Fitzgerald, the next on the
list, is well known on the water front.
where he has been stationed for a num
ber of years. He, too, is well thought:
of by the Police. Commissioners, but on
account of his advanced years they
have concluded to dispense with his
services.
Policeman McNulty has been on the
force for nearly twenty-one years. Re
cently his eyesight has become impair
ed, and he has been unable to do police
cuty. He has. asked to be retired.
Policeman Anderson is stationed at
the O'Farrell street station. Shortly
after the opening of the new station,
which was. about .a. year ago, he was
taken to his bed, and has been con
fined there ever since. Like McNulty,
he is anxious to be retired on a pen
sion. . â . V
Patrolman Knnis 1s connected with
Captain Spillane's division. He has
been incapacitated for some time, and
'iyHl hail with, delight his retirement,
as lie mximieint^rily feared that his
name would be ; dropped from the roll
On .account of sickness.
It. was first ; intended to make some
changes in the detective department,
but fer some reason the plan failed.
Chief Lees, it is understood, is anxious
to reorganize the. department, but in
order- to-do this it w<>uld be necessary
to reduce, to the ranks several detect
ives who in past years did excellent
work. The Chief iÂ« opposed to return
ing them to the ranks, and in obedi
ence to his wishes the Commissioners
have decided to. keep their hands off
the detective department, so to speak.
There is a vacancy in the detective
department, caused by the promotion
of Captain Bohen, wfiich, it is expected,
will be filled at the meeting of the
Commissioners on Monday night. Cor

CRUSHED BY A CAR.
Howard R. McNichol Severely In
jured at EleveQtr; arjd Mis
siorj Streets.
Howard R. McNichol, an agent for
the J. S. Kimball Steamer Company,
Mission-street pier 2, was run down
and seriously injured by Mission
street electric car 1165 at 8:30 o'clock
last evening. Mr. McNichol, who lives
at 201 Eleventh street, was returning
home, and had just stepped from the
outgoing car when the incoming: car
strmk him, and he was forcibly
thrown to the pavement and rolled for
several feet. Frank Behan, the motor
man, stopped the car as soon as pos
sible and the unfortunate man was
drawn from beneath the wheels and
removed to the Receiving Hospital,
where his hurts were dressed by Dr.
Fitzgibbon.
When examined at the hospital it
was discovered that he had sustained
a severe wound on the right groin, as
well as several abrasions of the back
an<l scalp. His wounds are supposed
to be fatal. J. R. Shock, a bookkeeper
for Kimball, who lives in the same
house with the injured man, identifie.l
him as the agent for his company. K.
Trelut, the conductor of the car, was
under the impression that it was an
unavoidable accident.

BEARDED THE JUDGE
AND GOT LECTURED
Richard Linehan Addresses the
Flowing "Whiskers of
Campbell.
But He Makes the Error of Doing It in
the Court of Judge
Cook, :
Judge Campbell's whiskers got tan
pled in court machinery yesterday, and
the wheels of justice came to an instant
stop, for the nonce hopelessly clogged.
The incident occurred as Superior
Judge <"ook was weighing the merits
of a little row between Police Judges
Campbell and Low, and projected it
self into the situation through a hole
in the skylight. Richard Linehan was
responsible. He was arrested, fined
$10, the fine being remitted, and the pen
alty of listening to a lecture from the
bench substituted. Whether Linehan
gained or lost by this change is a deli
cate matter, which forms no part of
this story.
The clogging hereinbefore mentioned
happened in thuswise: Proceedings had
up to a certain point been conducted
with seemly dignity, when suddenly a
voice from above called out, "How are
you, whiskers?" All eyes were turned
to the ceiling, and everybody knew that
the Campbell jungle of beard was the
Innocent cause of more trouble. Then
followed the arrest and lecture and a
promise from Lanehan not to do it
again. But if he doesn't somebody
.â will, Cot there are temptations not to
be resisted. ; .:
At last the wheels were : unclogged
and business resumed, but for the rest
of the day Judge Campbell wore a puz
. zled J expression. .:. He cannot under
stand 'why peace and dignity so often
j get the worst of it when they come in
I contact with his whiskers,: to him not
j alone an ornament but ..i.; scarf, a
I badge of office, a pride arid endless joy.
' â  The case at bar was the habeas cor
pus matter of Sydney = Kellett. It was
submitted â¢ " after' \ considerable â¢ argu- .
ment, and early in the afternoon: an
opinion was filed. Judge Cook held that
after ' conviction the magistrate con
victing can alone release, the prisoner
. on bail.- -This- opinion makes void the
order, issued by Judge Campbell for the
release of Kellett pending the outcome
of his appeal, as he was convicted be
fare- Judge Low, and that magistrate
alone can accept, bonds. for his release,
or it may be done by some Judge of a
court. After the' filing of the opinion
Attorney Mack, who represented Kel
lett,. stated that he would, appeal to the
Supreme Court for a writ of habeas
j corpus. -. ' .â¢-.- . â â 'â .. â ' " 'â '

A wreck, Just now.
Out at Larkin and Sacramento
streets, where Dr. Mulligan lives, there
is a little sufferer with an aching jaw
done up in plaster. He did not even
greet the glad new year with a ki-yi.
He couldn't in the first place, and he
did not feel like it in the second. To
this sufferer hangs a tale; also a tall,
the latter of comparatively little im
portance. As to the patient's name be
ing Skippy, that is mere supposition on
the part of the poet, and shall be lived
up to by the prose artist.
Skippy is a Scotch terrier of respecta
ble lineage, a pet in the Mulligan fam-

i the sunshine of the household. Latter
ly Skippy has been showing signs of
1 indigestion, has been less kissable than
I before, and a breath once suggestive of

j deteriorated; sadly in quality. Some
j thing had to be done. So Skippy's ills
I were diagnosed by a veterinary sur
geon, who said that the teeth of the
; doggy were in /need of attention. He
> attended to one or two. but there was
I one obstinate canine tooth which re
piptf'd the efforts of the surgeon to WOO
: it forth. The master was con:
: that the patient be taken to a <*.*ntist,

not seem overjoyed, but when the lover

the terrier were- made clear to him he
consented to perform with the forceps.

PREPARATIONS FOR THE SALVATION ARMY'S GREAT BARBECUE.
The lot at the corner of Market and Larkin streets presented a busy scene yesterday afternoon consequent on the preparations for the barbecue to
m given by _ the fealvation Army for the benefit of the poor. Three dressed beeves stood looking with anticipations which could hardly be considered joyful
which was being prepared for their reception, while alongside them stood eight plump sheep, already spitted and awaitihg; the time w hen . they
uouid sizzle and sputter over a roaring fire in an adjoining pit, and later be handed out in appetizing chunks to the hungry multitude to-night "- : â  'â â 
me balvation Army has always been in the custom of providing liberally for the poor and wretched on holidays, not only for the assistance of the
needy but as appropriate thank-offering for the blessings showered on them during the year. This year, perhaps, the Army has; especiar reason for
thankfulness, for it has seen the successful launching of the colony at Soledad, the happy consummation of months of arduous toil.
v, a u U i 6 Â°i_ rlock ] f st nlsht the P lts were completed, the animals properly stowed, and the huge fires lighted, presenting a weird and attractive
scene which drew hundreds to the spot, and the odors arising promised well for the supper of the Army's beneficiaries to-night. The distribution^ of food
which will take place on the lot, will begin at 6 o'clock to-night, and, while a great many tickets have been issued, there will be an abundant supply for all
and perhaps some left over for those who have not been fortunate enough to secure tickets. There are three beeves ranging in weight from 65a to 700
pounds, and eight sheep averaging about sixty pounds each, all from the market of William Schrader. The barbecue is in charge or William Keech,
two pieces. This is what alls him now.
Nothing known to medical science is
too good for Skippy since. Indeed, the
patient intimates that nothing is quite
good enough; but his judgment is be
lieved to have been yanked bias during
the dental operation. At present his
pulse is normal an? his temperature
not such as to excite alarm. He is re
ceiving every possible attention, and
some that people not wrapped up in
love for ancient Scotch terriers might
not have deemed possible. That he
may not be disturbed request hat? been
posted up for people to not knock, but
walk right in. This was told the poet,
but he failed to catch the idea.
Dr. J. J. Leek disclaims having
used any unnecessary force in separat
ing Skippy from his troublesome biters,
and expresses a doubt that the jaw was
broken. His theory seems to be that
Skippy has a pessimistic disposition,
and is making too much fuss over an
experience likely to come to any man.
Unless there should be a sudden
change for the worse on the part of
Skippy there is nothing more to tell,
and the narrative will b*> rounded off
by the first stanza of a beautiful and
' appropriate song, the other stanzas hot
having been written: â¢:-. .; '-.[:' â¢ -.;;

it was caused by one of the lodgers
falling against the : knob, he paid no
attention to it and again fell asleep: The

was unable to understand how a. stran

stolen his valuables, he became sus

had the money in his possession, when
he entered the room, and that it miys

He could not explain how it was taken.

they had retired. He said that he 16ft
