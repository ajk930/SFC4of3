A fight for life if being made by the
Society for the 'Prevention of Cruelty to
xAnimals. According to the reported state'
mints of Captain Ddany of the Health
and Police Committee of the "Board of\
Supervisors an attempt has been made to
blackmail the society out of $500. The
directors have decided to resist the unlaw- '
ful demand for money. t/Js a result of
this refusal and of the refusal of Secretary :
Holbrook to release impounded animils j

divs of the past.
Assistant Secretary E. L,. Wadham
Wot the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals makes the start
line accusation that he has been ap
proached by Chairman Delany of the
Health and Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors in a way that ,
â would do justice to a Black Bart.
"By the way, can you put me on
how to er^-t J500?" is the delicate way
the chairman of this responsible com
mittee is reported to have made known
his corrupt and criminal desires. This
was also told to Mr. Charles Bauer.
"This lanp-uae-e was reported to the
directors of the society." said Director
Samuel Seymour, "and we decided to
pay no attention to it further than to
resist any attempt to coerce or black- |
mail the society."
The language reported to have been !
used in this way to Wadham and
othersâ twice to Wadhamâ is enough
to warrant an investigation into the
methods of the chairman of this im
portant committee. If the charges are
true they constitute the most shamrful
case of political and official hlackmail
that has been reported in many years.
This language becomes the more
serious when it is recalled that a
petty spite has existed against the so
dfity by various Supervisors ever since
Secretary Holbrook first refused to re
cognise the requests of Supervisors,
â which are quite numerous, that animals
held in the pound be "released with
out cost to the city."
In the old days when impounding an
imals was carried on as freely as rob
bing in the regions of the Alhambra. it
as a common thing for Supervisors
ro flood the pound master with these
requests to favor every political heeler
in the neighborhood. Printed forms
showing the shameful extent of this
abuse still exist and are used daily,
though the secretary, acting under le
gal advice and the interpretation of
the clerk of the board, has refused to
recognize any such orders. He takes

Misconduct in Office.
this stand because there is no provi
sion that the cost of paying , for the
care of such animals and the cost of
their capture be paid, except in the
regular. way by fine of the delinquent.
It has been decided that Mr. Hoi- j
brook will resign as poundkeeper, an
office which pays him nothing in addi
tion to his salary as secretary of the !
society, and that he will be succeeded j
by Mr. Seymour. It is the general
opinion that this will be a compromise ;
measure, as the Health and Police
Committee has recommended. that the '
impounding of animals be taken away j
from the society rand - put into politics
again. .
If this should be done there is a '
great likelihood that there will be a
repetition of the disgraceful scenes of
the past acts of cruelty and corruption'
that caused the society to take hÂ«>M
of the matter some years aRn. It la
also reported that ex-Pcund Keeper
Osborne will under no circumstances be
appointed to succeed Mr. Holbrook.
Tnder the corrupt system that some
of the supervisors suggest there is no
guarantee that private citizens will not
again be subjected to the petty black
mall and insults that thrived in the
wicked past. There is also no assur
ance that animals will not be sto-len,
turned out of owners' lots and abused,
as in the past, that disreputable wield
ers of the lariat and dog catching bas
ket may again grow fat by corrup
tion.
The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals has gone into the ,
animal question in a thorough and sci-
entiflc manner. Their plant for the
care and final destruction of condemned
dogs has been pronounced the finest in
the United States. Rev. Dr. Clark,
founder of the Christian Endeavor So- ,
ciety, visited their plant at Sixteenth
and Alabama streets when he was here,
and his opinion was that the plant and
the methods pursued were incompara
bly ahead of all such institutions in
the United States. It is the general
opinion of those who have investigat
ed the matter that the methods of this
society are in every way creditable, and
that the Board of Supervisors will ,
make a great error if they do so rash
a thing as to place the care of animals
in the hands of ward politicians again.
The society does not desire to see its
plant become worthless by an <rrder of
the Board of Supervisors, made through
Jealousy. It absolutely refuses, how
ever, to contribute a cent to the fund
as demanded by Chairman Delany.
'When I become pound master," said
Mr. Seymour, "I shall abide by thedeci
sion of thedir'i-tf.rs.,f the society as to
whether it is my duty to heed orders of
release issued by supervisor*. As the
supervisors get so little patronage of j

poor fellows a chance to release some

Assistant Secretary Wadham sticks
I to It that the Supervisor made some
vr tv pointed remarks, amounting prac

a written statement to that effect.

coaxed to talk, could phi â¢omethSng
even more definite and damaging upon
Delany.
"I am perfectly familiar with that
$500 proposition," said Holbrook last
evening, "and have heard of It several
times. I was given very pointed hints
on numerous occasions that money
would be required to hold the pound,
and that was some time before "Wad
ham reported to us what Captain De
lany had said to him. Wadham's re
port was not. therefore, news to me nor
to several offirers in the society. As
Mr. Seymour will tell you, for he and
I consulted several times in refer
aooe to the $."00 proposition. we
decided to pay no attention to
the matter, but to -'ami our ground
and refyse to be held up in this brig- i
andish manner. 1 have been told sev
eral times by friends of Delany that
the Supervisor was only jdking when
he said he wanted $500, but that was
a serious matter, in my estimation, to
Joke about.
"Delany made the proposition, and
nobody knows it better than himself.
Ifr. Seymour and I have got proof to
show if he insists on denying it."
DELANY DENIES IT.
Says He Did Wot "Talk Busi-
ness" With W.adham.
Supervisor Delany was seen at hts
residence last evening and denied that
any overtures had been made to the
officers of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals regarding
the control of the pound.
"I know Mr. Wadham," he said, "and
asked him regarding the manner in

adopted re<Â«>luTions last night
calling upon thp members of
Congress from Illinois to vote
and work apainst the Hawaiian
annexation treaty.
CHICAGO. Jan. 29.â At the annual
| banquet of the Commercial Club, which
j was held to-night at the Auditorium,
i Professor vnn Hoist of Chicago Uni- |
versity delivered the principal address
Of the evening, his subject being the
"Annexation of Hawaii." His remarks,
which were greetP'l with every mani
festation of approval, were as follows:
"What is th>- criterion for deciding;
the question. < night Hawaii be an- '
nexed by the United States?' Not the i
wishes or interns; t the islands. It is
not only the rig} â¢ but also the 1m- ;
perative duty of the American people
to be guided solely by their own inter- \
est.
"The great fertility of th" islands no- j
body gainsay*. TJiu ttftl is the less .
reason to annex then,, bcause all the
! economical advantages to be derived
from them are secured already.
"As to the military side of the ques- [
tlon. Captain Mahan, our leading naval j
authority, has exploded the naive no- j
tii >n that the islands confer by them
selves control over a body of water. To
be of military value we must have an
adequate navy, and to bÂ« adequate our
â¢navy would have to be much larger
when Hawaii Is ours: for It would have
to protect not only our coasts and our ,
shipping but also Hawaii, which would
: surely be a principal object of attack
; in a war with a first class naval power.
Now we are practically invulnerable.
Is It rational to acquire without any
need a spot at which an enemy can hit :
'. us infinitely harder than anywhere
else? We would annex not a source of \
strength, but of weakness. And it !
would be a step tha\ could not be re- '
i traced. To make the best of a bad job
j would he all that is left to us.
"That we act under compulsion, be- ;
cause some other power â probably
either England or Japan -would take
the islands if we refused the gift, is an
: assertion which is not and cannot be ;
i substantiated, as it has never before
; been substantiated, though the cry has
been raised every time we were after
â OHM territory. Wo can at least afford >
to think enough of our power, as
well as of our dignity, not to let the
cry, England,' have the effect upon us
that the red cloth has upon the bull.
Ever since UK the declaration of the
United States that they will not 'allow'
or 'permit' certain territories to be ;
taken by any other power has proved ;
a sufficient curb upon the covetousness .
of the leading states of Europe. Does i
it then permit of any doubt that their
peremptory 'Hands oJT!" would now be
respected?
"An even graver consideration than '
1 those mentioned thus far Is that the I
annexation of Hawaii would not mean
the annexing merely of Hawaii. We .
would annex temptation, and it Is r..>
cause of this that annexation is so
enthusiastically urged upon usâ the
temptation to annex other outlying
territories and the temptation to piss
behind us the warning counsels of
Washington in his farewell address,
and enter upon a new era as to our
I international policy.
"Weighty as all thfse objections are
they dwindle into insignificance com
pared with the two that have thus far
not even been alluded to. In the Dec
laration of Independence the nation
has officially based Its existence upon
th<- principle that governments 'derive
their Just powers from the consent of
the governed.' If annexation is ef
fected In the manner proposed this
fundamental principle? will be tram
pled under foot, the unanimous ratifi
cation of the treaty by the Hawaiian
Senate notwithstanding. For the over- [
whelming majority of the population
has virtually had no voice in institut
ing this government; though now the
lawful government, it actually repre
sents only less than 4000 out of about
110,000. Even if the remaining 106.000
were to pray as ardently as the 4000
for annexation we ought to shut our
door against them, because according
to the unanimous emphatic testimony
of the small minority, posing as the
Hawallans. the 106.000 are utterly and
permanently unfit for self-government, ,
which Is more than the life breath,
which Is the very structural principle j
of this republic."
The resolutions by which the club de- {

VOICE OF LOS ANGELES
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29.â These are the resolutions voicing the
popular sentiment on the water question:
Resolved, That, inasmuch as the subject matter of water Is one of
vital importance to each and every citizen to the end that an entirely
adequate and complete system may be obtained at as early a date as
possible, under municipal control and operation, it is therefore deemed
advisable that permanent organization be secured to represent the citi
zens directly in this all-important matter, and to co-operate with the
Council to bring about the result without any unnecessary delay. There
fore a committee is hereby named, to be known as the "Citizens' Com
mittee on Municipal ownership," said committee to consist of one mem
ber from each ward, the chairman of this meeting to be ex-offlcio a
member of the committee, and to name such crmmittee within a rea
sonable time.
Resolved, That we extend our thanks to all public officials who
have thus far in this struggle upheld the rights of *'\e people and re
mained true to their trust and their pledges, and we extend our thanks
to all newspapers, whether published here or elsewhere, that assisted
the people in this contest.
clared Itself against annexation call
upon the Senate to vote against the an
nexation treaty. They were introduced
before the club by F. B. Peabody, in
substitution for a briefer and more
general resolution to the same effect
that had been offered by Melville E.
Stone. The resolutions as adopted
read:
"Resolved. That it is the deliberate
sense of the Commercial Club of Chi
cago that the annexation of Hawaii
would be a source of weakness and
danger to the United States. It would
present almost impossible problems of
government. Th? population of which
not exceeding 5 per cent are white and
the remainder chiefly semi-savages and
Orientals can never become assimilated
with Americans nor be submissive to
the rule of constitutional law. A de
fense of islands 2000. miles distant from
our remotest border would involve, in
case of war, a larger navy than is ra
quired for the defense of our whole
seaboard. No advantage to the United
States can be obtained by annexation
that cannot as well be gained by
treaty. Hawaii is a friendly power,
and no reasonable request for coaling
or telegraph stations would be refused
us. The United States are dealing with
and must always meet political ques
tions of sufficient gravity to tax the
powers of the highest Intellect and
most devoted patriotism. It would be
a mistake, if not a crime, to add to our
perplexities the government and de
fense of an alien people living in the
mid-Pacific, with whom we have no
common interests.
"Resolved, That our Senators and
Representatives are respectfully re
quested to cast their votes against the
ratification of the pending treaty of
annexation.
"Resolved, That the secretary for
ward to our Senators and Representa
tives a copy of these resolutions."
Resolutions were offered immediately
following the address upon the ques
tion delivered by Professor yon Hoist.

NEW YORK. Jan. 29.â General H. H.
Boyce, formerly of Los Angeles, Cal.,
who was accused before the investi

LOS ANGELES. Jan. 29.â The people
of Los Angeles, without regard to poli
tics, assembled to-night in mass-con
vention to express their views upon the
water question, and they did so in un
mistakable terms. Not only did they,
by a unanimous vote, record their sen
timents upon the manner in which the
City Council had proceeded in regard to
the matter, but they also gave ex
pression to their feelings as regards the
syndicated local press â the Times, Ex
press and Heraldâ which three daily
newspapers have steadfastly taken up
the defense of the water company in
the contest which is now on with utter
disregard of the rights of the people.
And as soon as the muzzled and man
acled local press was me-itloned by a
speaker this evening the audience
broke forth in one loud acclaim and the
cheers and the applause were long con
tinued.
The citizens who had assembled real
ized the truth of the assertion that
they could neither expect nor hope for
aid in the water fight from the local
press. Therefore, when they heard
the truth from a public platform, they
were not slow in approving of its re
lation.
The mass-meeting which was held to
night was one of the most successful
non-partisan gatherings that have ever
been convened in this city to discuss
a great public question. It is ona
phase of the battle The Call is mak
ing to assist in obtaining for the peo
ple of Los Angeles their full rights in
the matter of a water-distributing
plant, without permitting her citizens
to be robbed of two million dollars in
the interest of the fifty-two stockhold
ers of the water company.
To this end the mass meeting was
deemed advisable. It was felt that
there was nothing to be done by taking
fruitless straw votes. The Call, acting
for the people of Los Angeles, and in
order that the citizens might be en
abled to express themselves upon the
great question, in order that a perma
nent organization might br- formed to
conduct an organized battle for the
people's rights, lent its voice to them
in calling a mass convention when the
local press was paid for silence.
All that was hoped to accomplish and
more has been brought about as a re
sult of the people congregating to-night
at Music Hall. The permanent organ
ization to conduct the water fight in
their interest has been secured, con
sisting of one member from each of the
nine wards of the city.
The people have also taken a very
decided stand which, if anything on
earth will move it, will have a tendency
to cause the Council to take action
along the line of preparing to buy the
water company's plant at the expira
tion of the contract. As yet the
Council has done nothing in this mat
ter.
The meeting also decided that it was
against public policy to permit the
water company to make unnecessary
improvements to its plant now which
are non-essential and which are made
solely for the purpose of endeavoring
to compel the Council to make a re
valuation of the company's improve
ments to the city's plant at the expira
tion of the contract.
Mayor Snyder, Councilmen Grider
and Hutchison and The Call fend the
Record, although not specifically men
tioned, were all thanked for the ser
vice they have rendered the people In
this matter.
The vast throng that gathered at
Music Hall this evening was a most
intelligent audience. It was made up
of all classes and included some of the
first citizens of Los Angeles. As proof
of the assertion that all deemed the
subject that was to be discussed one
of vita! importance it is only necessary
to relate that many citizens brought
their wives with them. The enthusi
asm, while it was kept within orderly
bounds, was certainly deep, and the
men realized that they were brought
together for a business purpose.* This
purpose they accomplished. As presid
ing officer ex-Mayor Hei.ry T. Hazard
was warmly received. Mr. Hazard's
two terms as Mayor have convince^2
the people of his honesty, and when
A. W. Fisher, who called the meeting
to order, presented Mr. Hazard he was
given an ovation.
After quiet had been restored Mr.
Hazard announced briefly the object of
the meeting. He said the people had
gathered, not as partisans, but as citi
zens, fighting lor their homes and fam
ilies. They had gathered, he said, not
to destroy anybody's property or to
make any attempt to take from any
man or corporation his or its legal
rights. Then, taking Up the water
question, Mr. Hazard aid that if the
city was going to bu> the water com
pany's plant it was about time for citi
zens to know where the money was
coming from to buy with. As yet noth
ing in this direction had been done.
"The Â« Ity," said Mr. Hazard, "want*
to give th< water company every dol
lar that is due it, but it does not pro
pose to pay $5 for a piece of pipe that
is not worth 50 cents. We are here.
though, to deprecate taking from the
company anything which is not ours,
or which, if it la theirs, we will not pay
for. But if the plant is only worth
one million we are not going to pay
three million for it."
Mr. Hazard then introduced the
Mayor of the city, M. P. Snyder. Mr.
Bnyder spoke as follows:
Fellow Citizens, Ladles and Gentlemen:
This mass meeting called to-night for the
purpose of discussing the water question
1b one of great importance. The water
quest. that is near the hearts of
all good citizens. Even now they look to
the time when the city will set possession
of its plant and control it in the interest
of the people, with abundance of pure
water at a respectable cost. During the
last <-ity campaign the War cry of all po
litical parties was "municipal ownership
of water works." That was the issue of
the campaign, and when the people went
to the polls to cast their ballots they
voted for the men whom they believed to
be honest, whom '* they believed to be
closely identified With the int. -rests of the
and who would stand by the
people.
It is Indeed an unfortunate situation
that a citizen, it matters not whether he
)Â«> May< r or a man In the private walks
of life, should be referred to as a dema
ofaying to the galleries
when â â  ors to . carry out the
: atfonn on which he was
fl. I say it is an unfortunate situa
tion for the city ot Los. Angeles that
when a man a ands for the people
; ins he should be ac
of being a confiscator.
On - â :' last July I sent a special
message to tl â¢â  council urging that body
to see to It tl it nothing be left undone
ownership of water.
My posjtion was immediately criticized,
se I was urging the Council to
am â¢ â -<â  to secure ;i!l the information to
be obtained as to the value of the plant
and at s possible arrive at an
agreement as to the price to be paid to
The water company for its improvements
at the expiration of the contract.
For taking that position I was repre
sented to the public as playing to the
ries, and I know not what else. My
position on the water question, I believe.
U) bo well known that such comment
would have no weight, and I pass that
by. Tin between the water
company and the city will expire on the
next July. Only about six months
n in which to act, in which we have
time to carry out our contract. I do not
wish to be considered as advocating the
policy that the water company has no
rights in the controversy, but to the con
trary I maintain that the water company
has certain moral if not legal rights un
der the thirty year contract .which should
be respected by the city: and I also claim
that the city has certain legal rights
â which must and shall be respected by the
water company. [Loud and long contin
tiw'i ;ip;i!':
If xhf city does not assume an aggres
sive policy this water controversy will
continue indefinitely. In the event that
the city, after doing everything within Us
power, fails to bring about a settlement
ason of the water company refusing
to appoint its arbitrator, there is but one
course to pursue, which it cannot get
around, and that course is that at the
expiration of the lease the city's interests
cted. It will be the duty
of the city to take possession of the
water company's plant and everything
that goes to make up the system. [Ap
plause.]
There Is not a single word in the con
tract that the city shall not get posses
sion of its property at the expiration of
the lease. But that contract does say
that the water company will make such
Improvements as are mentioned in the
contract, and keep them in repair for a
period of thirty years, and then turn the
works over to the city.
I claim that the city of Los Angeles ib a
solvent corporation and that the water
company can recover fr.m the city every
â  it is entitled to under the contract;
and I claim that the City Water Corn
is simply acting as trustee for th.c
city, and in that capacity it has nothing
to say in regard to the operation of the
water company's plant after the expira
tion of the contract. All the claim that
the water company has against the city
is for the value of the improvements.
Remember, fellow citizens, that should
the water company continue in posses
sion of that plant after the expiration of
the lease the revenues, which amount to
a great sum of money, would go Into the
pockets Of '-'.holders instead of
into the city treasury, where they legally
belortfr.
I believe that the Council should be in
a 'position to-day to say whether or no
they are Koine to arrive at the price to
pay the water company at the expiration
of the lease., r believe they should have
taken legal steps weeks ago. If they are
Hot* going to be able to arrive at the
price, then. I claim, in order to carry
out tho contract it is the duty of the
Council to proceed under that contract to
appoint an arbitrator and notify the wa
i'-r company, of their action and ask the
water company to also carry out the con
tract by naming their arbitrator.
I have not said one word about confis
cation. What is there to confiscate? The
city owns the water plant and has al
ways owned it. 'Applause. )
I have always held that it is the duty
of the city to pay the water company the
value ot Its improvements and no more.
If they are ready to accept that, that is
is all there is to the question. I am exer
cising every effort to bring about a fair
settlement of the question at issue and
I shall continue to do so while I fill the
position I now hold. It matters not if
every paper from Siskiyou to San Diego
calls me a demp-gogue and an anarchist.
(Enthusiastic and long-continued ap
plause.)
City Engineer J. H. Dockweller was
the next speaker. Mr. Dockweiler was
warmly received. He made a brief talk
1n which he gave some detailed infor
mation concerning the water plant.
The City Engineer placed himself
squarely on the same platform with
the Mayor in the battle for municipal
ownership. In 1891. Mr. Dockweiler, as
<ity Engineer, made the first report on
the Water company's plant and its con
dition and value. He reviewed his past
work in this connection, and then
turned his attention to the late report
on the value of the plant which was
made under his supervision.
Mr. Dockweiler made a telling speech,
and his popularity was attested by the
hearty applause with which his re
marks were received.
Councilman L. M. Grider, one of the
two faithful Councilmen. was the next
speaker. He was warmly received by
the people, who understand his posi
tion and. who were not at all slow about
recognizing it as well as the gentleman
himself. Sir. Orider's remarks were
merely a review of the effort he and
his colleague has made for municipal
ownership in the Council.
The next speaker excited the most
enthusiasm of any citizen who ad
deressed the meeting. It was Milton
Carlson, who is an instructor In the
city High School. Mr. Carlson took
up the subject of the muzzled press,
and his reference to the attitude of the
Times, Herald and Express and his
comments thereon met with popular
approval. He was cheered to the echo.
Among other things Mr. Carlson said:
"We have here in Los Angeles a muz
zled press on this water question. It is
impossible for us to secure any advice
or instruction through it, as to our
rights, or interest in this water com
pany controversy. It is all a question
with these three papers, as to whether
or not the water company will get its
rights or not. That is all that seems
to worry those sheets. Lord pity the
SOME PRIZE-WINNERS AT SACRAMENTO'S BENCH SHOW..
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29. â The attendance at the poultry and bench show to-day was much better than that of yesterday, the attention of the
public seeming to have been more strongly attracted to the tine exhibit and the milder weather also making it more pleasant for those who attended
It was expected that the dogs would be judged for special prizes this afternoon, but it was concluded to defer it until 1 p. m. to-morrow, in order to give
a large number of people a chance to witness it. Quite a large number of special prizes have been offered in the various classes by business men of this
city. The poultry show will be continued until Mmiday night at 1 o'clock.
The following additional awards have been made for pigeons, closing the list: Largest and best collection of pigeons, G. T. Marsh; second largest
and best collection, A. N. Bayley; best collection of runts, H. E. Whitman; best collection of pouters, G. T. Marsha; best collection of white fantails, J. J.
Tompklnson; best collection of Jacobins, G. T. Marsh; best collection of turbits, A. N. Bayley.
poor inhabitants of any city if they
have newspapers like ours."
And then the audience did break
loose and cheer. In closing Mr. Carl
son made mention of the attitude
The Call had taken in this controversy,
and that was another signal for ap
plause.
Before resuming his seat Mr. Carl
son offered the following set of reso
lutions, and moved their adoption:
Whereas. All the political divisions in
October, 1596, pledged their several nomi
nees for municipal offices to work for the
public ownership, control and operation
of the water-distributing plant now held
by the Los Angeles City Water Company
under lease; and whereas, a provision
should be made whereby the city will be
enabled to purchase the betterments to
its plant at the expiration of the con
tract; therefore be it
Resolved. Firstâ That he citizens of Los
Angeles, in non-partisan mass-meeting
assembled, deprecate the division in the
City Council on the policy that should be
pursued in making preparations for the
purchase of the improvements placed in
said water system by the water company.
Resolved, Secondâ That the Council be
requested to forthwith legally notify the
water company that the improvements
placed upon the system beyond what is
necessary absolutely for the maintenance
of the same until the expiration of the
lease is contrary to public policy, and as
many of the improvements are entirely
unnecessary for the said purpose Of
maintenance and do not accord with the
plan for the water system for the mu
nicipality as outlined by the engineer in
charge.
Resolved, Thirdâ That the council be
requested to invite the Mayor and the
City Engineer to participate in all fu
ture negotiations with the water com
pany.
Resolved, Fourthâ That inasmuch as
the subject matter of water is one of
vital importance to each and every citi
zen, to the end that an entirely adequate
and complete system may by obtained,
at as early a date as possible, under mu
nicipal control and operation, it is deemed
advisable that a permanent organisation
be secured to represent the citizens di
rectly in this important matter and to
co-operate with the Council, to bring
about the result without any nnnecess . ry
delay. Therefore a committee is hereby
named, to be known as the "Cltlsens 1
Committee on Municipal Ownership."
said committee to consist of one mem
ber from each ward and the chairman of
this meeting to be ex-ofnelo a member of
the committee and to name such com
mittee within a reasonable time.
Resolved, Fifthâ That we lend our
thanks to all public officials that have
thus far In this struggle upheld y^he
rights of the people and remained true
to their trust and their pledges, and that
we extend our thanks to. all newspapers,
whether published here or elsewhere, for
assisting the people in this contest.
Chairman Hazard, as soon as the
resolutions were read, asked if there
was any discussion or suggestion in the
way of amendment.
There was absolutely none, but there
were loud cries from all over the hall,
"Adopt them, adopt them." This was
then done.
The next speaker Introduced was Ed
ward L. Hutchison, the Councilman
from the Eighth Ward. Mr. Hutchison
took a pronounced stand in favor of
the Council at once taking the neces
sary action to have at hand the money
to buy the water company's improve
ments to the city's plant at the expira
tion of the lease. The speaker re
ferred to the abuse which he and his
confrere, Councilman Grider, had been
subjected to by the water company's
'oeal press for their efforts to cause
the corporation to come to terms under
conditions of their contract.
Mr. Hutchison said: 'The Times.
Herald and Express do not seem to be
worried about the people, but they are
worried for fsfcr the Water Company
is not going to be accorded its legal
rights. If every paper In the city will
simply fight for the rights of the
municipality you need not have one
bit of fear about the water company
enforcing every right that is guaran
teed it under the contract. The local
press need not be alarmed on this
score."
And then there was tremendous ap
plause.
At this juncture Chairman Hazard
announced that he had had some ex
perience in the manner in whit h the
water company secured defenders. He
said when he was Mayor of the city an
endeavor was made uÂ« defeat an issue
of sewer bonds and the water company
had actually secured the Attorney-
General of the State to come from Sac
ramento and defeat the will of the peo
ple. The Attorney-General. Mr. Haz
ard said, afterward admitted to him
that he had appeared here in the mat
ter at the instance of the secretary of
tin* Los Angeles Water Company.
"This," said Mr. Hazard, "shows you
how easy it is for the water company
to secure defenders in high places."
Ernest Abs Hagen, the civil enerin
eer, was the next speaker. He first
quoted the following statement printed
by the Times: "The present water
system of the city is the result of far
sighted sagacity and enterprise. Evcrv
feature of this system represents the
most serviceable material and mode of
construction obtainable; the service for
all purposes never fails."
Commenting on it. Abs Hagen said:
"This Is the statement of the water
company's advocates, who counsel de
lay in acquiring the same for city pur
poses. Let us look at the other side
of the picture, and we find that the
sizes of ihe mains are below the mark,
that the condition of the mains la ex
tremely bad, that poor and cheap ma
terials were originally used, that the
service is inadequate for any demand
thereupon. These results were found
by the city's investigation, which
proved that out of 308 miles of mains
not less than 241 miles are mains of
two, three and four pipes, or a total of
79 per cent. It must be borne in mind
that a water plant, complete in all its
arrangements, has a main of not less
than six inches, while the present
plant has 170 miles oC twxMnch pipes
TJIE SAX FI? AXCISCO CAIA,. SUXDAY, JAXT'ARV 30, ISOS.
out of a total Of 308 miles. Do ynu
wonder why Messrs. Snyder. Qrtder
and Hutchison take issue with the ad
vocates of the water company's in
terests?"
The meeting closed v ith a few re
marks from Professor AS*, c Bowman.
Chairman Hazard, before the adjourn
ment, said: ''Citizens. I wish to tell
you that the moment the city of Los
Angeles sticks a pick In the ground
and has th" money at hand â and she
can get it â that minute will she have
a water system."
Tais sentiment met with long contin
ued applati.-e.
The meeting adjourned subject to the
call of the chairman of the committee
<>n municipal ownership. Chairman
Hazard will not be able to name the
committee for several days.
The consensus of opinion was that
the mass convention was the most suc
cessful as well as the most fruitful that
has been held in Los Angeles for some
time.
REPLY OF ENGINEER
DOCKWEILER TO ABS
HAGEN' S AFFIDAVIT.
Answers in Detail the Sworn Statements
Made by His Former Sub
ordinate.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29.â city Engi
neer Dockweiler, who was yesterday
made the subject of an affidavit by
Abs Hagen, has given to The Call cor
respondent the following clear and
lucid signed statement as so the affair:
In reference to the published affidavit
of Aba Hugen, recently an employe of the
city of Los Angeles as a subordinate In
my office, I desire to make the following
brief statement: -' â¢ â ' v,
Abs Hagen, in connection with the
other engineers, was employed by me to
compile from official and water company
data an estimate to enable me to place
a valuation on the Los Angeles City
Water Works. In compliance with in
structions received from me and working
under my personal supervision, At â 
Hagen assisted in the compilation of the
report now on Die in the office of the
City Clerk of Los Angeles. â¢
In the affidavit mentioned Abs Hagen
states that I visited the work only three
times. This statement is absolutely
false. I kept myself fully Informed as
to the progress of the work and felt in no
wise obligated to report to Abs Hagen
or- any other of my subordinate engi
neers.
In characterizing the report submitted
by me to the City Council as being es
sentially his own work. Mr. Abs Hagen
is correct, "in so far as the work was
done under my Instructions and passed
under my personal supervision and final
review In my capacity as city engineer-
In reference to the allegation made by
Mr. Abs Hagen that on July 22, 1597, I,
in . consultation with him, reviewed the
itemized estimates and insisted upon
raising the figures therein contained,
thereby Increasing the amount of the to
tal estimate J156.000 over .-md above the
alleged "true estimate" previously made
by Mr. Aba Hagen. I have only to say
that there was no estimate until my re
port as city engineer was filed.
In response to Mr. AM Ilagen's state
ment that I brought forth no good reason
for such Increase of figures I have only
to say that the increase fixed by me and
incorporated in my final report to the
City Council speaks for Itself, and is â 
matter of public record. 1 saw no neces
sity at the time, nor do i now see any
reason for making a detailed explanation
of my actions to Mr. Abs Hagen or any
other of my subordinate engineers. I
will further state thai the Increase was.
in my judgment, made as a matter of
equity and simple justice to the water
company and" in the line of my doty as
a servant of the people of Los Angeles
City. .
Reference to my report to the City
Council will verify the statement that my
figures, as submitted, will show a reduc
tion of $1,809,345 on the valuation of $:(.
000,000 as fixed by the water company as
its valuation of the Los Angeles City
water plant.
"Reference to my report will reveal the
fact that the deductions from the figures â
by courtesy designated as Abs Hagen's â
nlus the other items in the schedule of in-
fcreased valuation, reduces the sum total
of total Increase to $23,480. which amount
plus 10 per cent for contingencies, makes
a. sum total increase of $126,965, every
item of which is legitimate and just from
an engineer's standpoint.
The allegation made by Abs Hagen that
I consulted with Mr. Mulholland, super
intendent of the' water company, * and
with ex-City Engineer Fred Eaton, is cor
rect. I consulted with each of the gen
tlemen named in my official â¢ capacity as
city engineer, to the- end that I might
acquire such expert testimony as would
place me in a position to best conserve the
Interests of the city.
In this relation I desire to emphasize
the fact that Mr. Abs Ha gen was himself
in constant communication with Mr. Mul
holland, a circumstance rendered imper
ative by the complex and intricate nature
of the work in hand, a fact which will be
attested by every competent engineer.
By way of addenda I will add that Mr.
Abs Hagen exceeded his authority as my
subordinate In consulting with Mr. Perry
the president of the Los Angeles Water
Company, at the latters residence, rela
tive to matters whioh properly belonged
to the city of Los Angeles. These facts,
comirtg to my notice after the filing of
the report, influenced me to dispense
with the services of Mr. AbR Ha*rÂ«-n.
.The report, as made. by me- to -the City
Council, is a matter of record. It is mi
nute as to detail and. is the best, in fact
the only legitimate answer to the idle
vaporing* of Mr. Alii Hagen.

IRELAND'S FREEDOM
FROM ORDINARY CRIME.
Vices Which Are Common in England Do Not
Exist Among the People of South
west Kerry.
NEW YORK, Jan. ?9.â A special
from Dublin to the World says: The
moat striking testimony to Ireland's
freedom from ordinary crime, even in
what are called by her British rulers
the disturbed districts, has just been
borne voluntarily by E. T. Lloyd, for
merly Chief Constable "f York. He
was appointed six months ago Stipend
iary Railway Magistrate at Cahirie
reen, County Kerry. Speaking from
tlie bench he said:
"I should like to congratulate the
public and the police of this district on
the fact that after four months of con
stant attendance as Resident Magis
trate in this portion of Ireland, com
prising an area of 1000 square miles, I
have never yet had before me a single
complaint of theft and not one case of
criminal assault. iioth these classes
of cases are terribly common in Eng
land. I say so as an Englishman,
and I have lived all my life in Eng
land until quite recently. It speaks vol
umes for the people of Southwest Ker
ry that they should be so strictly up
right and honest, considering their
great poverty and the hard times they
are so patiently enduring."
CROKER'S BROTHER
FIGHTS STRIKERS
As a Railway "Manager He In
augurates Bluffing
Tactics.
Special Dispatch to" The ""all. '
' NEW YORK. Jan. 29.â A dispatch to
the World from Dublin says: The 1 in
dustrial world is having an object les
son in the Bismarckian masterfulness
of the Croker family. It has attracted
general attention to an otherwise in
significant strike on the Cork, Bandon
and South Coast Railway.
Richard Croker's brother is the man
ager of that railroad. The . men had
scarcely left work on a strike when
he gave them an unexpected taste of i
his quality. Instead of negotiating for \
a compromise Croker issued instanter a
statement declaring that they had acted
illegally and to the danger and injury
of the public by quitting work without ,
notice. He warned the men that they
would all be prosecuted with the ut
most rigor; that their places would be
filled immediately, and that no one, un
der any circumstances,' would be re
instated in the company's service. â¢ " .
As a final blow, when the chief sec
retary of the Amalgamated Society of
Railway Servants of Great" Britain
went especially to Cork to negotiate
with the company, Manager Croker ab
solutely refused to see him or to recog
nize the right of the society to inter
fere.
These high-handed and Draconian
measures have excited the intense ad
miration of Croker's fellow railway
managers, ami if he can carry out his
daring programme he will have inau
gurated a new era in the history of
railway strikes. Up to the present time
he has not succeeded in filling the
men's places, but all traffic is kept up
on the railway, the clerks acting as
guards and porters. Croker himself is
working night and day in that capaci
ty, actuated by his firmly expressed
resolution to fight the strikers "to the
bitter end.'

BROWN MUST GIVE PROOF.
Berkeley Man's Charges Against Eastern
Athletes to Be Investigated.
NEW YORK. Jan. 39â President Oliver
Shiras of the Intercollegiate Athletic As
sociation said t<>-day that the executive
committee of the association would call
on Captain Brown of the athletic team of
the University of California to substan-
tiate the charges of professionalism he
made againFt Eastern college athletes.
The matti-r of demanding proof from
('aptain Brown will come up at -a meet
ing of the executive committee of th*
association on February 25. Mr. Sbiras
says that If Captain Brown fails to sub
stantiate the charges he has made, and
which are a serious reflection on the am
ateur standing 1 of athletes of leading
eastern universities, he will be disci
plined.
The executive committee Is composed
of President Sbiras, A. T. Klrby of Co

are indignant becauseof Captain Brown's

Special Dispatch Â»- The Call.
PORTLAND, Or.. Jan. 29.â Paul
Ducleo, a farmer living near McMinn
ville. was shot and killed at 10 o'clock
this morning by Fred Clemens, a young
man 20 years old. The killing was the
result or" an old feud which has in
volved the two families for a long time.
The Coroner's inquest disclosed facts
which are corroborated by the resi
dents of the neighborhood as to the
cause of the shooting. Young Clemens
was summoned and told the story sub
stantially as follows:
' I started to go hunting through the
field to the line between our place and
that of Mackay, and from there I went
down the hill to L. Baker's place,
where I saw Dulceo approaching from
thf direction that I had come from.
When he was within fifty yards of me
egan to abuse me, swearing at me
and threatening to kill me. As he
drew near he pulled off his mittens
and began to iiraw his gun. I tried to
evade him and said that I did not want
to have any trouble with him. Ducleo
k^pt cominir and then began to raise
his srun. When he had raised it to the
level of my head I fired."
The Btory Bema to show that Ducleo
did ma intend to shoot Clemens, but
was trying to intimidate him.
Thf trouble between the Ducleos and
the Â« "â¢â¢:r.< ns family nearly reached a cli
max lust fall, when riemens and his
father and the two Ducleo boys were
fighting. Since then the bitterness has
been more intense, and the Ducleo
boys have threatened the lives of the
( 'k-nifMises. Ducleo's revolver was found
by his side, cocked ready for act4on.
The Coroner's jury fully exonerated
Clemens. The latter was perfectly cool
ami told a straightforward story of the
Bhaotlhg. He is a fine-looking young
man Â»and has a large circle of friends
in WcMfimvflle.
Ducleo was living with his brother
on their farm adjoining the farm of
the Clemens family. When his brother
heard of thp shooting he raved like a
madman, and it is feared that the
P* trouble is not yet at an end. Both the
Clemenses and the Ducleos are well
to do.

the Government will grant him a

NEW YORK. Jan. 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
"The Captain General has returned
my visit. Everything Is tranquil. Un
doubtedly the effect of the Maine's vis-
it has been to Increase the friendly
feeling toward the United States. No
restricti'm Is now placed on officers of
the vessel â¢with respect to going
ashore."
This in effect is the contents of a ca
blegram received at the Navy Depart
ment to-day from Captain C. D. Sips
bee, commanding the battleship Maine,
which is lying in the harbor of Ha*
van a.
The administration authorities were
prepared for this dispatch. I learned
to-day that soon after the arrival of
the Main** in Havana harbor Captain
Sigsbee cabled to the department, stat
ing that the presence of the vessel has
increased the favorable regard felt for
Americans by the Spanish authorities
in Cuba. Furthermore, he has informed
the department that he and the offi
cers under his command have been
treated with the greatest cordiality,
and that every courtesy that could be
desired had been extended to them.
It is felt by the authorities that the
moral effect of the Maine's visit has
been excellent, and will benefit Ameri
can interests, just as Captain Sigsbee's
dispatch indicates it has already done
to some extent.
"With such good results following the
visit of the Maine to Havana, the ad
ministration officials say that the
jingoes of the country and Congress
have no further ground for ureing in
terference by the administration in the
Cuban question. It was said at the
Navy Department that it has not yet
been finally determined when the
Maine will leave Havana, although it
is said to be highly probable that the
vessel will, with the battleship Texas,
represent the navy at the Mardi Gras
festival at New Orleans on February
21. Orders sent by the department to
Rear Admiral Sicard direct him to as
sign two vessels to this duty which shall
reach New Orleans on February 17. As
there is no intention on the part of the
authorities to keep the Maine at Hav
ana more than two weeks, because of
the sanitary condition of the port, it is
expected that she will be relieved by
Rear-Admiral Sicard. her place in Hav
ana harbor being taken by one of the
smaller cruisers.
HOW ARANGUEREN
WAS BETRAYED BY A
TORTURED PRISONER.
Spanish Soldiers Led to the House Where
the Cuban Was Visiting and Indulge
in a Wanton Massacre.
HAVANA (via Key West). Jan. 29.â
The following details of the death of
General Nestor Arangueren, who was
killed fin Thursday last, have been re
ceived: It appears that the column un
der Colonel Aranjare, who had been
operating: in the neighborhood of Cam
po Flnrido, raptured a negro named
Morales, whom they tortured in order
to extort from him information regard
ing the insurgents. For a long time
the prisoner bore the torture, and re
fused to make a statement, but finally,
upon being promised a reward of $500,
he agreed to betray Arangueren.
General Arangueren. the negro said,
was in the habit of visiting the house
of a paciflco, called Cajagal. who lived
in the Tapaste Heights, between the
town of Tapaste and Campo Florido,
with his family, which consisted of his
wife, a grown daughter, of whom Gen
eral Arangueren was enamored, and
several younger children.
Colonel Aranjare, with three col
umns, numbering about 1000 infantry
and cavalry, proceeded under the guid
ance of the negro. Morales, to the hut.

UNDER ICE TO
THE NORTH POLE
Alfred Riedel of Baltimore Sub
mits a Scheme for Making
the Voyage in a Sub
marine Boat,
NEW YORK. Jan. 29.â A Baltimore special to the Herald says: Al
fred Riedel, a young Baltimorean. held conference to-day with Daniel C.
Oilman, president of the Johns Hopkins I'niversity, and members of
the faculty, with reference to an expedition to the north pole by
means of the liake submarine boats. Aftor listening: to Mr. Riedel's plans
the faculty expressed the opinion that they deserved consideration.
Mr. Riedel explained that after a close study of the reports of sci
entists and explorers he believes that there is no land at the pole, and
that the sea there is not open, and is covered with ice of moderate
thickness. He believes that climatic conditions at the pole are differ
ent from what the popular belief would have them. Because Dr. Nan
sen encountered a bear and other life, he argues there must be open
water, to some extent, for without it their food would not be obtainable.
If these ideas are correct, he says there will be no difficulty in carrying
a boat like the Argonaut, beneath the Ice to the much sought for pole.
He plans that the vessel will be taken to Spitzbergen and there
tried beneath the ice, such changes in the boat as would then be sug
gested being made. From Spitzbergen the boat would proceed along
the path of the Fram to the front, where it was frozen in the ice, which
is estimated about 650 miles from the pole in a direct line.
Submerging the boat at this point, the submarine voyage would
begin. The vessel could proceed 100 mflfÂ»s without the necessity of a
renewal of the air supply. Within this space, it is believed, a clear sea
would be encountered. If it was not. the projector says it would make
no difference. An auger-like screw would be used in such case to
bore a hole through the ice and air could be pumpfd through this into
the storage batteries of the boat, or, if it was necessary, a torpedo
would be fastened to a point under the surface of the ice, the boat
backed away to a safe distance and a hole blown in the ice. The same
tactics could he pursued at the pole.
which they surrounded. When the hut
had been completely surrounded a
squad of men was ordered to advance
cautiously, arriving near the entrance
before being seen. A child about eight
years old was playing outside the door
way, when she discovered the soldiers,
and screaming in alarm ran toward the
hut to Inform the inmates of the pres
ence of the Spanish. A volley from the
squad stretched her lifeless on the
ground, and then a general firing was
ordered by the Spanish commander,
which resulted in the wounding of
Arangueren in the leg. the killing of
his servant and the mortal wounding
of his sweetheart and another woman.
the latter of whom fled toward the
woods and fell dead a short distant
away- Arangueren's sweetheart died
from the effects of her wounds while
being taken to Campo Florido.
Arangueren was in bed when the
Spaniards arrived, and. hearing the
alarm given by the child, ran out of
the hut. only partly dressed, crying,
"I am Arangueren." and apparently
meaning that lie ought not to be killed.
His captors s'izfd him and made a
Close search of his clothing for docu
ments relating to the death of Colonel
Ruiz, whi' h they secured. They also
ohtained a verbid declaration from
their prisoner on the same subject and
then a bullet was fired through his
breast and lie fell. l>ut not dying in
stantly, a bayonet was thrust through
his h<;t'i. the weapon entering near the
mouth, ending his life.
The Spaniards captured a man be
lieved to be the dynamiter of Aran
goeren'fl band, and two boys who said
tho knew the location of the grave of
Colonel Ruiz.
The boys, in charge of a Spanish col
umn, have left f<jr the place where they
say the grave is located.
While Arangueren's death Is consid
ered just vengeance for the execution
of Ruiz, the killing of women and chil
dren when they might have been taken
alive, is generally condemned.
A number of prominent persons at
tended the funeral of General Aran
gueren, wh<> was buried in the private
tomb of his family. Among those who
acted as escort to the body were three
generals of the insurgents In the last
war.
The horse and saddle of Colonel Ruiz
were seized when Arangueren was
killed.
DECLARES THE SPANISH
FLEET IS NOW WHOLLY
UNFIT FOR SERVICE.
Unpleasant Things Said by the Organ of the
Carlists in Discussing the Visit of
the Maine to Havana.
LONDON, Jan. 29.â The Correro, or
gan of the Carlists. discussing the visit
of the United States battleship Maine
to Havana, expresses the belief that thÂ«
Spanish public is justifiably alarmed,
adding: "As a fact, it is the Govern
ment Itself which is seriously alarmed,
though every effort is made to disguise
it. In spite of the official statement of
that, Cervaras, the admiral of the lleet,
on Tuesday last, at a conference with
the Minister of Marine, asserted that
the recent evolutions had demonstrated
the perfected condition of the Spanish
fleet, Admiral Cervaras, in reality, re
ported that there was not a ship ready
fur Ml Vice; that the vessels not actual
ly in drydock ought to be there; that
many of the boilers were defective, and
that some of the ships were not yet
armed, and that most of the vessels
require cleaning. In view of the per
fidy of the United States, it is not sur
prising that such neglect and helpless
ness create alarm."
According to the same paper, great
importance is attached to the confer
ence between M. Patâ¬notre, the French
Minister to Spain, and Senor (iullon.
the Spanish Minister for Foreign Af
fairs, who, it is said, discussed the ac
tion <<f the United States, "as It is well
known that there is great alarm in
France at the course of events. The
1 fact that M. Patenc-tre is intimately
convei'â lit with United States affairs,
lends additional importance to the mat-
I ter."

Frightfully mangl. ; ,mo eaten by rats,
the body of Mrs. Fanny Rathburn was
found frozen in a pool of blood on the
floor of her cellar this afternoon. Near
by was a bloody ax. in the bedroom
abova her 12-year-old daughter was
found dead and frozen, with her throat
eat, and with every evident â¢> of having
been criminally assaulted. Life had
been extinct for a week.
Mrs. Rath burn lived In a frame house
in an isolated district. She was a
widow with two children, Mary the
murdered girl, and Frank, who is in
thÂ»- reform school at BSdora, lowa For
a week the neighbors had noticed a
deserted appearance about the house
but Â»upposed the women had gone on
a visit to Greenbay Township, twelve
miles south of the city, where they oc
casionally visited.
To-day a messenger boy called at
the house and found the front door
standing ajar and snow drifted in upon
the carpet. He told a neighboring wo
man of the fart and she told Charles
Patterson, who went to Â»he house and
entered.
Nothing seemed wrong until he
opened the door into the cellar, when
he was confronted with the horrible
sight of Mrs. Rathburn lying dead and
frozen in a pool at blood on the floor.
A bloody ax stood near. Turning from
the sickening tight Patterson pursued
his investigation till he arrived at a
small bedroom off the parlor, where
he found Mary's dead body on the floor
near the bed, with hÂ»r throat cut. The
appearance of her clothing, which was
torn, and of the bed, which was cov
ered with blood, indicated that a dread
ful struggle had been enacted, and that
the purpose of murder was to assault
the girl. Four or five men are under
arrest, one. Abe Storms, and a brother
who both live near where the woman
visited south c* town, are charged with
the crime, having been seen at the
house Sunday night last. It Is said
Mrs. Rathburn had refused them the
house several times, and had said she
was afraid they would kill her. The
most damaging clew is a black and
white necktie, which the girl had torn
from the neck of her assailant. Every
effort is being made to fasten the guilt
on the right parties.

IN HANCOCK'S
LIFE HISTORY
The Revolutionary
Patriot Was an
Embezzler.
Failed to Account for the
Harvard College
Funds.
Finally Ousted From His Posi
tion as Treasurer of the
Institution.
A FOE OF WASHINGTON.
His Greatest Desire Was to Be the
Colonial Army's Commander
in-Chief.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 29.â A startling his
torical discovery has just been made
here, showing that John Hancock, the
famous patriot and merchant prince,
was not only an embezzler, but a bitter
enemy of George Washington. His let
ter book, just found, shows the follow
ing facts:
A typical instance of his yearning for
power was his desire to be commander
in-chief of the Continental Army. It
is probable that he never forgave
George Washington for having been
appointed to this post, and thus car
ried off the military glory which Han
cock really believed to be within his
own reach. The well-known and scru
pulous exactitude which Washington
exhibited in financial matters was In
marked contrast to the methods of
Hancock. The latter's career, as treas
urer of Harvard College, instances
these methods. Its history is most
readily accessible, and it was hoped his
letter-book would cast some condoning
light upon it, if this indeed be possible
in the face of the many records and
letters still extant.
In 1 7 7 :> the college corporation elected
Hancock as treasurer. He qualified and
received the college funds, but at the
proper time he rendered no account.
When he continued in default a meet
ing between him and the corporation
was appointed for March 21, 1775. On
that day, instead of Hancock and his
accounts, came a letter from him. No
accounts or payments were forthcom
ing then or thereafter, though often
asked for, and, moreover, Hancock
caused all the papers and securities to
be taken across country from Boston
to Philadelphia, where they were at
great hazard from the enemy.
At last the college, in great and war
ranted fear of losing not only the in
come but the principal of its funds,
sent a messenger for the securities, be
cause Hancock, pressed in the most
delicate but urgent manner, refused to
resicn. He was removed from his of-
Bee .is treasurer in 1777.
Meanwhile, the college funds had
been much reduced in value, but this
loss the college was willing to assume,
and even to pay Hancocks salary dur
ing his term of office. It sought noth
ing but an accounting, which it prayed
for in the most humble and patient
manner, though its rights and necessi
ties would have justified far different
language.
Hancock became angry at the college.
Constant attempts at settlement were
made by the college, and votes were
passed to put Hancock's borfd as treas
urer in suit, but nothing more was
done, especially when Hancock became
Qo*etnor, and as such presided over the
meeting of the overseers of the college.
Hancock's incumbency and his offices
prevented his prosecution, which would
otherwise have followed; but his con
tinued resentment undoubted'y caused
much of the coldness which, during his
administration, grew up between the
commonwealth and the college, which
had hitherto been closely allied.
When about to resign his Governor
ship until the troubles culminating in
Kay's rebellion should blow over, he
settled an account acknowledging an
indebtedness on his part of over Â£1000.
Two years after Hancock's death, his
h<irs paid nine years' simple interest.
and in six or seven years the principal
of the bond was liquidated.
Hancock left a large estate, much of
which was in cash or its equivalent.
The most charitable view to take of his
conduct is that of President Quincy â
that the causes of his unjustifiable neg
lect were his great wealth and his un
bounded popularity. These accidents
of fortune, together with his peculiar
temperament, doubtless led him to feel
that he was above the law and the ob
ligations binding ordinary persons, and
thus h^ was seduced into pecuniary
slackness. This was manifested also
in other pai â¢t'l-jla;!'.

AT THE MERCY
OF BOODLERS
Raids on the San Jose
Treasury Not Yet
Checked.
Four Councilmen Who Are
Not in Accord With the
People.
Vote Solidly on All Deals and Brazenly
Set Mayor Koch's Veto at
Naught.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PAN JOSE, Jan. 29.â San Jose is at
the mercy of its boodle Councilmen,
end unless drastic measures are adopt
ed to check them in their extravagance
they will have looted the treasury dur
ing the next two months that they are
to be in office. At present there is $53,
r>."7 in the city treasury, and the four
Councilmen have evidently banded
themselves together for the purpose of
spending all of this they can get their
hands on. Never before have Council
men of this city so recklessly expended
the people's money, and never before
have charges of boodle been so openly
made.
The disclosures of Irregularities in
city affairs, made by The Call some
weeks ago, is being verified. At that
time the local press took the part of
the city officials, but now the work of
the Council has become so "rank" that
the papers and people of the Garden
City are on the verge of taking steps
to remove the four Councilmon before
the treasury Is entirely depleted.
A few months ago the Council was
dividedâ Fay and Nolting on one side
and King and Dittus on the other.
While they thus opposed each other,
nothing 1 was accomplished, and theciti
zens felt that the treasury was secure,
as, thus divided, it was impossible for
them to vote away the money. But the
four Councilmen patched up their dif
ferences a few weeks ago, and now all
Is serene at their meetings. They vote
solidly on all questions, and announce
insolently that if Mayor Koch vetoes
their jobs they will pass them over his
head.
The first outrageous act of these four
worthies after combining to plunder
the <ity was the awarding of the street
sweeping contract. In this it was in
tended to mulct the city to the sum of
about $4000 a year for three years. The
Council railed for bids for doing the
work and received five. They were
from L. Hewlett, Richard Farrell, M.
C. Cheney, Nash & BlcÃeynolds and D.
A. Bollinper and Thomas F.odley.
L. Hewlett's bid was the lowest, and
Nash & McÃeynolds the highest. The
two bids were as follows:
Nash <fc lCcHeynoldsâ .oQ62BS coins per
square yard per month, six tlm< s a week
for two-year contract; .002641 three timei
c. week. Two per cent discount for a con
tract for three years. These contractors
promise not to send any 01 the money
out of San Jose.
L. Hewlettâ .oo397s cents per square j
yard per month, six times a week, two
year contract; one-half of the above
amount f<T three times a week. Two per
cent off for three-year contract.
Instead of awarding the bid to L.
Hewlett, the lowest bidder, the Coun
cil, by unanimous vote, gave It to
Nash & McÃeynolds. The only reason
it gave for its action was that Hewlett
was only a speculator bidder, but this
is not so. Anyhow, there were the
bids of Richard Farrell, M. <\ Cheney
and Bellinger & Bodley, all lower than
the figures of Nash & McÃeynolds, and
they are all residents of this city and
taxpayers.
Under the present contract the city
sweeping is done for $395 a month. The
contract was let three years ago to L.
Hewlett, but a few months later the
contract was transferred to Nash &
McÃeynolds by Hewlett. The bills
each month are made out in Hewlett's
name, but Nash & McÃeynolds draw
the money. At that figure there are
euch profits In the street sweeping that
Nash & McÃeynolds pay Hewlett $75
a month for the contract. This leaves
them $520 a month, and this is con
sidered a good price and one from
which a fair profit can be realized.
Under the contract recently awarded
them it would cost the city about 14000
a year more than under the old con
tract.
It was plain that some one was going
to get that extra $4000 if the contract
stood.
Following right on this the Council
decided to let a contract for a new fire
alarm system. Bids were called for
and figures were submitted by the
Gamewell Company and the United
States Police and Fire Alarm Com
pany. The United States company's
bid was for $2400, not including $200
worth of extras that would be needed.
The Gamewell Company's bid was
$3300. Instead of going according to
the bids the Council gave the contract
to the Gamewell Company for $3900.
The four Councilmen â Fay, Dittus,
King and Nolting â at first wanted to
give the bid to the Gamewell company
at $3300, but Mayor Koch refused to
sign the contract. Bids were then
called for. and after receiving a bid
from the same company for $3300, they
awarded the Gamewell company the
contract for $3900, $600 above its bid,
This would not be the only cost of the
fire alarm system, for the city would
have to be rewired and new batteries
purchased at the cost of additional
thousands of dollars.
It is believed that $1000 of the $3900
contract awarded to the Gameweil
company was to be placed where it
would do the most good. The contract
ls now in the hands of the Mayor.
The latest job is the making of ar
rangements for the purchase of a com
bination chemical engine and hose cart.
The price ls understood to be $2500. The
arrangements are all completed, and
before the wave of Indignation swept
over the city it was agreed that the
resolution for the purchase of the ma
chine should be introduced next Mon
day night.
Mayor Koch stated to The Call repre
sentative to-day that he positively
would veto the street sweeping con
tract, which would be returned to the
Council Monday night. The fire alarm
contract will receive the same treat
ment at his hands.
Although the Council has boldly as
serted that it will pass these over the
Mayor's head. It is thought it will not
dare to in the face of public opinion. If
the officials do, it ls stated that the
New Charter Club will take steps look
ing to their removal. Not only that
but Mayor Koch says that he himself
will stop them in their rash expendi
tures by injunction. This desire by
Mayor Koch to hold the thrifty four in
check is meeting the approval of the
citizens, and in whatever action he
takes he will be strongly backed.
The four Councilmen have but a lit
tle over two months yet in office be
fore the new charter goes Into effect,
and five new Counrilmen are to be
elected. The time is short, and the of
ficials seem bent on making hay while
the sun shines.
LIBELS A SHIP
FOR HIS WAGE
Seaman Hindsgaul, How
ever, Fails to Win
His Suit.
It Is Decided That Ho Could
Not Draw Pay While
in Prison.
Was Detained in Australia for As
saulting the Lyman D. Fos
ter's Master.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Jan. 29.â 1n the Federal
Court yesterday Judge Hanford ren
! dered a decision on a point that has
no parallel in the history of marine
practice. It was set forth in dismiss
ing tho libel of Seaman Nil R. Hinds
paul against the schooner Lyman D.
Foster.
Hindsgaul is a resident of San Fran
cisco, and on December 11, 1^96. made
arrangements with Captain D. O. Kill
man of the schooner Lyman D. Foster
to make a cruise with him as first
mate. Hindsgaul went from San Fran
cisco to Port Hadlock, where the
schooner was anchored loading lum
ber, and on December 14, 1898, was
shipped under duly signed articles to
go to Freemantle. West Australia, and
back to some port in the United Statt-s,
at a salary of $50 per month. It was
stipulated that the cruise was not to
exceed sixteen months.
Passing over the merits of the case,
it can be stated positively that when
the schooner arrived in the bay at
Freemantle, Captain Killman and Mate
Hindsgaul had a row. Htndsgaul
claimed that the captain hit htm with
a heavy marine glass, while the cap
tain claims that Hindsgaul struck him
on the eye, inllicting an ugly cut,
which was sewed up by a Burgeon.
Captain Killman made complaint to
the American consular agent. The case
was then taken before the resident
British Magistrate, who issued a war
rant for Hindsgaul's arrest on tfv>
charge of assault. Hindsgaul was tried,
convicted and sentenced to twelve
weeks in jail. The consular agent de
manded of Captain Killman the wages
due Hindsgaul up to the time he was
convicted. Captain Killman paid the
amount due and took the agent's re-
ceipt.
Before Hindsgaul was released from
prison the schooner sailed on her re
turn trip. After Hindsgaul was re
leased he returned to the United States
at an expense, according to his claim,
of $1)35. His lawyer instituted a libel
against the schooner Foster to recover
the amount of wages alleged to be due
Hindsgaul on his uncompleted contract
with the Foster. He also asked to be
reimbursed for the money spent in re
turning to the I'nited States.
After the evidence and argumentshad
been heard yesterday Judge Hanford
rendered his decision. He said that
the certificate of the consular agent,
with seal, establishing payment to the
consular agent of the wages due Hlr.ds
gaul up to the time he was convicted,
was equivalent to payment to the li
belant. The libelant having placed
himself in a position, through his own
act, where he could not complete his
contract, the ship was not responsi
ble for the unearned wages.
In dismissing the lihel Judge Han
ford taxed the costs of the suit to the
HhHant, who, however, is without
money and not a responsible person.

LOST HIS SACK
OF VIRGIN GOLD
Klondiker Stanley of Se
attle Poorer by Twenty
Nuggets.
Story of a Robbery Committed
Months Ago Just Made
Public.
Treasure Carelessly Left on a Bureau
Found Missing by Its
Owner.
Pperlal Dlpr."t'h to The Call.
SEATTLE. Jan. 29.â The detectives of
this city have about given up the
search for a weighty bag of gold nug
gets that disappeared some months
ago. The loss of twenty magnificent
nuggets, brought down from the Klon
dike by William If. Stanley, has Just
been made public. These specimens
were part of ihe $112,000 brought last
July on the treasure steamer Portland.
It was in March. 1896, that Stanley
first set sail for the golden Mecca. He
returned to Seattle on July 18. and went
to the bosom of his family, taking with
him his little sack of gold nuggets,. the
bulk of his treasure being placed in a
vault. When he drew that ordinary
buckskin sack with its twenty speci
men* of virgin gold from his pocket
and exhibited it to his family and
frlenda there were murmurs of won
drous surprise.
Afler a while the novelty of carry
ing around chunks of the precious met
al \\<>re off. It was not necessary to
guard them with Winchester rifles.
Stanley relaxed his vigilant watch over
the nuggets and left them in a little
box on a bureau one morning in the
early part of August, and thought
nothing more of them until he decided
to show a friend the relics of his search
in a land of frozen sand, which finally
resulted in making him a millionaire.
With a smile on his face he went after
the nuggets. When he reached for
them they were not there. As the
rouph characters of Dawson City had
vanished from the face of the earth,
never to be heard of again, so had
Stanley's golden nuggets taken wings
and sailed away.
The best detectives have worked on
the cue, but the mystery remains un
â olved, and all that Stanley has to re
mind him of his golden baubles is a
picture which he had taken of his
treasure.
NORWAY AND SWEDEN ARE
ON THE VERGE OF WAR.
Tension Fast Approaching the Snapping
Point and the Arming of Both Par

LONDON', Jan. 29.â The news from
Christlania on Friday last that the com
mittee appointed to draw up proposals
for the better regulation of the relations
between Norway and Sweden has been
unable to reach an agreement indicates
that the tension between Sweden and
Norway is fast approaching: the snapping
point, and it is stated that on the frontier
the arminp of both parties is rapidly pro
gressing, both sides preparing for war.
THE CORONA
MAY BE SAVED
Damage to the Vessel Not
as Great as Was
Reported.
It Is Thought She Can Be Raised
and the Cargo Got From
Her Hold.
News Brought From the North of
the Sinking of the Ferry
boat Alaska.
Special Dispatch to The CalL .'
SEATTLE, Jan. 29.â Later reports
from the wreck of the steamer Corona
indicate that the vessel is not so badly
damaged as at first reported. After
she struck she was six hours in filling,
which would indicate that the damage
to her bottom was not so great as had
been surmised. Her bow is on the
rock, her stern only being submerged.
It is now believed that unless greater
damage is sustained through heavy
: seas the vessel can be raised and again
put in commission. It is believed that
her freight and baggage will be saved,
though in a damaged condition.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 29.-The
steamer Danube which arrived here
early this morning from â  Alaska

to the wreck of the steamer Corona al

tory news of the report that the steam
er Coquitlam of Vancouver had run
upon a rock south of Fort Wrangel The
Coquitlam was not floated until a part
of her cargo was jettisoned. She re-Â«
mained on the rock about five hours.
When met by the Danube at Fort
Wrangel, the Coquitlam was taking
from fifteen to twenty, inches of water
an hour. The pumps were able to
keep the water down and the captain
of the Coquitlam proposed to continue
his trip to the mouth of the Stickeen
: River.
The third accident was the sinking
of the little ferry-boat Alaska, which
runs from Fort Wrangel to the Stic
keen River. The Alaska settled down
on some rocks with the falling of the
tide, and several holes were punched
in her side. She was towed off, but
sunk in deep water. No lives were
lost.
In his report to Messrs. Rithet & Co
local agents of the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company, Captain Pierce of the
wri-c ked Corona says:
"The steamer Corona, under my com
mand, struck on an uncharted reef on
the southeast end of Lewis Island on
Monday morning. She ia hard and
fast, stern under water, for<=>hold dry
at low water; passengers and livestock
landed and made as comfortable as
possible while awaiting steamer A!-Ki.
which is due in about twelve hours, f
do not think the ship is badly dam
aged, as she was six hours filling.
"O. H. PIERCE, Master."
ORDERED BACK TO PORT.
PAN DIEGO, Jan. 29.â The monitor
Monad nock crossed the bar at 12:50
p. m., bound for Magdalena Bay for
target practice and forty minutes later
! Captain Clark of the Monterey re
| ceived a telegram from the department
j at Washington ordering him to inter
| cept the Monadnock and bring her
j back to port. It was then too late to
j do this, so Captain Clark reluctantly
; decided to send the order to Ensenada
and the Monadnock will be notified if
she puts in there. No cause is given
for the orders from Washington.
CYCLIST ELKES THE WINNER.
PITTSBURG, Jan. 29.â The finish of the
big 72-hour bicycle race was exciting and
was a desperate effort between the two
leaders, Wailer and Elkes. to carry off
the big end of the purse. Elkes won by
two yards, having gone 1322 miles, 6 laps
and 60 yards.
Five minutes before the finish all of the
other riders left the track, giving the two
hifrh men a clear way to fight for the
honor and mosey. Elkes was In the lead,
with Waller lapping his wheel. A lively
pace was set at once. Many times Wal
ler put an all of his powr to pass his
young opponent, but each time Bikes'
reserve force proved the better, and amid
the wildest kind of enthusiasm he kept
the lead to the end. The final score was:
Elkes, 1322.6 60 yards: Waller. 1.Â°>22.6 58
yards: S^hinneer, 1314.6: Hale. 1311 8; Wal
ters. 1309.11: Dench, 1129 miles: Gannon
1115.2; Ruckel, ltlO: Henshaw, 878.
The race is said by experts to have
beon one of the best of its kind on rec
ord, and. barring the rather small attend
ance during the week, was a success in
every way. The record made by Waller
last yearâ l22l miles and ?, lapsâ was
passed by five of the riders at 6:18 p. m.
Certain Lands Exempted.

CHARGED WITH
STAGE ROBBERY
Young Marshall Naylor of In
dependence Held
for Trial.
Accused of Having Stolen Over Two
Thousand Dollars From
Wells- Fargo.
Special TMspntrh to The Call.
INDEPENDENCE, Jan. 29.â 0n the
night of November 24 last Rhine's stage,
carrying Wells-Fargo express, was held
up by a solitary highwayman about one
mile from town, and the box, containing
something over $2300, mostly tax money
consigned to the County Treasurer, v.a^
broken open and relieved of its contents.
Beyond the theory that the crime was
the work of local persons, no suspicion
attached to any one. as far as the
genera] public could learn.
Last week a young man named Mar
shall Naylor was arrested on a warrant
sworn fo by O. C. Harper, the driver of
the express team, and at the preliminary
examination held on Friday Harper
swore positively that Naylor was the
man. He said that he had recognized
him. but had no! said *o at the time oÂ£
the robbery because he thought it would
be improper.
Naylor was reared in this vicinity, and
has never been in trouble before. He
was about t<> leave for Bakersfleld when
arrest. (1. He was released, pending trial,
on 15000 bonds. Detective White, one of
Wells-Fargo'a officers, is working on the
case.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Jan. 29.â The Introduction
of the Socialist bill for the extension of
the limited right of coalition of work
ingmen and the debate on the matter '
are regarded as being of special import
ance. Herr Geyer cited cases showing !
that different Governments, notably the
Saxon and Prussian, do not scruple to i
violate the slim political and trade
rights of the working people. Baron
yon Stumm, at one time an intimate I
friend of Emperor William, leader of j
the reactionists, favored additional!
curtailment of these rights. There is j
not the remotest chance of the Reich
stag adopting the bill or of the Bundes
rath approving it, and that the Govern
ment recognizes this is evidenced by j
the fact that not a single Minister at
tended the debate on Wednesday. The
matter is important, because the So- ;
cialists propose to make it an issue at
the coming elections.
It is learned at the Foreign Office that
owing to the sugar bounty conference
at Brussels the reciprocity negotiations j
between Germany and the United
States are at a standstill, and it is
doubtful whether they will be resumed,
as Germany has about concluded that;
nothing tangible will come out of them.
It is understood that the sugar confer
ence will formally discuss the Dingley
tariff law.
The Foreign Office next week will di- i
rect the attention of the Chamber of
Commerce to the South American com- 1
petition, especially in cottons, growing
up in South American countries, where
German importers have so great inter- \
ests. The officials of the Foreign Office
are preparing a suggestion of the best j
way , to combat this competition.
The 1 peculiar appositeness of the text ;
of the sermon of Emperor William's
birthday, namely: "Be Still and Know
That I am God: I Will be Exalted
Among the Heathen," has attracted a I
great deal of attention, and it is now!
explained that the Emperor himself se- I
lected it. It is suggested that the add- i
ing of the word "Chinese" would make
the passage perfect.
Among the Emperor's birthday
edicts is one dealing with the regula
tions of rowing in the public schools
of Berlin. His Majesty decrees that
the pupils in rowing be invariably su
perintended by masters acquainted
with the sport and by a physician.
Matches must not be rowed in . the i
presence of any but the friends and
relatives,, and members only of the j
two upper forms may race. Genuine i
racing boats are not permitted, and the \
course must be limited to 1200 meters. !
The Emperor announces that In order
to carry out these reforms he has !
placed 35,000 marks at the disposal of 'â 
the Minister of Education, toward the
acquisition of. a water course, a boat
house and boats, and he promises to !
give two annual prizes for the fastest
boat and the most skilled .crew.
An article recently in the Hamburger
Nachrichten, on the occasion of the
Emperor's birthday, bears unmistaka
bly the ear marks of Friedrichsruhe
and expresses Prince Bismarck's
views. It says: "The monarch has
stepped into the foreground of public
far more than his ancestors did. The
policy of the empire and of Prussia
bears mark of imperial origin, and the
strong individuality of the sovereign la
ever perceptible in the most different
spheres. He not only governs, but
rules and is in reality the actual leader
of the nation and disposer of the des
tinies of Germany. if Germany is
now animated by a higher spirit than
a short time ago, If the confidence of
the State Government visits by in
creases: if the spirit of enterprise is â 
impulsed, we attribute it mainly to the 'â 
fact that the Emperor has known to
find ways whereby distinct ends are
attainable."
The article concludes: "The gloomy
visions which formerly troubled us on !
the Emperor's birthday have begun to
disappear and we venture to hope that
the future will not bring us fresh dis
illusions such as to again make acute :
old antagonisms in public life. For
mistakes which are not made a second
time, we count on the high intellectual
qualities of the monarch and the per
ception of what is useful and what is '
harmful to Germany, as well as on the
psychological elements which influenced
him."
The most severe criticism has been
aroused throughout the country at the
sentence of two months' imprisonment
in a fortress imposed upon Herr Tro
jan, editor of the Kladderadatsch on
Tuesday last, for cartooning the Em- :
peror, in December last, by represent
ing Frederick the Great, Napoleon Al- |
exander the Great, and Leonidas read- i
ing the speech of Emperor William de- I
livered on November 18, when he swore
in the Guards' recruits, upon - which 1
occasion his Majesty remarked that it !
was necessary to be good Christians in ''â 
order to be good soldiers.
Even the conservative newspapers
prom/unce it an atrocious sentence, and
It is said to be directly due to the Em- j
peror's Influence, as his Majesty was i
furious at the cartoon, and has given
strict Injunctions that Herr Trojan be
confined at Weichselmunde, situated in
a fever-laden district, where Herr i
Wrede, another critic, encountered the
most severe malaria.
Kladderadatsch's issue of to-day was
confiscated, owing to the publications
of a cartoon in which Herr Trojan sa
tirically criticized his sentence. He
also published two poems to the same
effect in to-day's issue.
Herren Schmidt and Walther, two
Alsatian editors, were also imprisoned
during the past week on the charge of
lese majeste, for publishing an ironical
article on the Emperor's birthday. Herr
Stadthagen, a Socialist member- of the
Reichstag, has also been sent to prison
for nix weeks for lese majeste. â " 'â ""â  "â  I

ENGLAND IS
SOLVING THE
PROBLEMS
And as Usual Things
Are Coming Her
Own Way.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, Jan. 29.â Aft^r an un
usually prolonged pf-rind of extreme
tension, all signs p< i-.it to an early im
provement in if not a complete solution
of the various international political
problems agitating the nerves of Great
Britain. The Foreign and Colonial of
fices are beginning to see daylight
through the darkness which has l>>ng
been enveloping the Far East. West
Africa, the T'pper Nile and India; and
unless signs fail ai.l information from
the best Informed circles is faulty, the
Marquis of Salisbury and J">=^ph
Chamberlain. Secretary of State for the
Colonies, will divide the honors and
Great Britain v.lll secure about all she
asks. So far as China is concerned.
th;s view, in connection with the speech
of Mr. Curzon, the Parliamentary Sec
retary for the Foreign Office, on Tues
day, and the reported acceptance of the
British loan, is generally regarded as
correct. Mr. Curzon foreshadowed the
probable success of the loan negotia
tions, the achievement of Great Brit-
am's purpose in keepinig the ports free
to the whole world and the mainten
ance of treaty rights whereby "spheres
of influence are rendered impossible."
The Russian proposal of a loan on
the same terms as Great Britain was
not taken seriously. It is understood
that she has not the money herself
without drawinr: upon her war reserve
funds.
France is daily showing less inclina
tion to burn its fingers in a game in
which, even if successful. Russia would
be the only gainer: while Germany ap
pears to have set completely around
to the British side. Throughout, the
situation has never been so alarming
as sensationalists attempted to paint
it. Hence the Czar's peaceful assur
ances and Lord George Hamilton's
statement in his speech on Tuesday
that relations with Russia were
tirely satisfactory will not have sur
prised America.
Turning to West Africa, an official
of thf Colonial Office states that the
impossibility of securing witnesses
from the West Coast f-arlier is the rea
son for the delay in the Paris negotia
tions. Some of the most Important
witnesses arrived only last week, and
they are now in Paris. Thus far all
the British demands have been con
e'eded nominally, and "provisionally
r.g the result of the ((invention,"
but Mr. < "hiimberlain is perfectly sat
isfied that the British dalirus will be
upheld, and that the Frenrh will be
confined westward of a line prolonged
from the presr-nt Lugo? - Dahomey
frontier to the Niger and along th^
right bank of the Niger to Say.
In the meantime he does not propose
to risk being caught napping by a
probable adverse decision of th" con
vention, so he is pushing troops and
supplies to the front as rapidly as pos
sible. A new regiment of 2000 Hussars
has been enrolled at Ibaden during the
last few weeks, and detachments will
be sent to the front as soon as the men
become efficient.
In regard to the Upper Nile the in
teresting news which Mr. Curzon
dropped on Thursday to the effect that
the ratifications of the treaty between
(^reat Britain and Kint,- Ifenellk of
Abyssinia have been exchanged and
that the Government hopes shortly to
have an accredited representative at
the Abyssinian court has given the
greatest satisfaction as helping to
solve the question of the Upper Nile.
The terms of the treaty will not be di
vulged until it is presented to Parlia
ment, but the hints dropped at the
Colonial office indicate that the agree
ment is based on the principle that
friendly Abyssinia on the Upper Nile
is preferable to hostile France.
Therefore King Menelik will be allowed
to gratify his ambitions in the equa
torial Hinterland in a manner not in
terfering with the Anglo-Egyptian
plans
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JA&UABY 30, 1808.
FRANCE'S
VOLCANO IS
NOT EXTINCT
Slumbers While Pop
ular Opinion Re
mains Excited.
Copyright, MM, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS. Jan. 29.â Although the Drey
fus crisis has been less acute during
the past week, popular opinion is still
very excited over the matter. The vol
cano is not extinct; it Is simply slum
bering. One point which has tended to
excite the public is the fear of compli
cations with Germany, although there
seems to be little ground for expecting
any. M. Henri Rochefort, in a discus
sion of the .matter this morning, said:
"I don't fear complications with Ger
many. What, however, is certain is
that were any to arise, the Jews will
be the first to suffer from it."
This puts the matter in a nutshell.
Rightly or wrongly, popular feeling is
against a revival of the Dreyfus case,
and is bitterly opposed to the people
advocating it. It is felt that the case
cannot be opened to the public without
such details being discussed as might
endanger the peaceful relations of
France with other nations. This feel
ing can only be realized by likening it
to the state of mind of the entire na
tion at the time of the French revolu
tion. In fact, the history of S7 seems
to be repeating itself in a remarkable
way. Then a mere frivolous matter
about a diamond necklace played a
prominent part in the furor and led
to an important event.
To-day it is a question of military
trial, which, as M. Kdmond Drumont
points out, concerns no one but mili
tary â  dicers. As he says officers in the
army are there of their free will and
Boldiers by compulsion. There may be,
therefore, some reasi.-n for disputing the
authority of the COUrt-martlal in the
case of a common soldier, but there can
be none in the rase of nn ofnVer, see
ing that he has voluntarily placed him
self within its Jurisdiction. .Vow. just
as 1793, when popular feeling was ex
cited to an extent that led to the most
terrible e\ents that ever occurred, is
added the threatened intervention' of
foreign nations in France's domestic af
fairs. And, again, to-day dread of in
tervention on the part of Germany
over the Dreyfus matter hfis embittered
the feeling against those whom the peo
ple consider guilty of bringing about a
possibility of this intervention. It is
useless blinking at the fact that the
nation looks upon this attempt to re
habilitate Dreyfus as the result of a
radical combination. If the result
should lead to difficulties with any for
eign nation ii would be Just the'same
as in 17M. That is to sny. first, the
fury of thÂ« populace would be spent
upcm those accused of causing it. Re
cent events in Algiers proved this. If
the Prussian and Austrian armies* had
not been summoned to the frontier in
the early days of the first republic
Louis XVI might have retainer! his
head, but at the first breaih of foreign
interference all other sentiment seems
to have been swept away by rage and
fear, and the aristocrats whom the peo
ple believed to be guilty of calling for
eign ni<l had to bear the onslaught of
tb<- trended nation.
To-day at the first idea that Germany
might intervene, owing to the Influ
ence of what the nation at large
chooses to call the Jewish syndicate
the people would get into a dangerous
state of excitation, and the Jews would
bo in a precarious situation were any
international difficulties to spring out
of the present agitation.

PREVALENCE OF CANT
CAST thy burden on the Lord; he will sustain
thee.
So quotes the Clark woman, a creature
whose life has been exposed by process of law, who is
as vile as degraded humanity has learned to be, who
while parading as one sanctified has been living in
unspeakable shamelessness, and who being caught
clings to the canting phrases she had committed to
memory- It is this particular phase of infamy which
is irritating to the intelligence. The openly wicked
may be guarded against. As a protection there is the
police. The decently and frankly wanton may be
reasoned with and perhaps brought to correct views
of existence and proper methods of living. But what
shall be done with the immeasurable moral outcast
who, while being all that is despicable and foul, yet
mouths praises for having been rescued from the
paths of sin? The Mrs. Clarks and their kind con
stitute a problem for the solution of which nothing
has been evolved from human experience.
THE RAILROAD COMMISSION.
AN evening contemporary which usually takes
the railroad side of every public question de
clares that we wore mistaken in saying the
Railroad Commission possesses legislative, executive
and judicial functions, and it cites us to the constitu
tion for proof that the commission is compelled to
enforce its decrees "through the medium of the
courts." The phrase quoted is used in section 22 of
article XII of the constitution in connection with the
judicial powers of the commission. It has nothing
to do with the framing of passenger or freight
schedules nor with their enforcement.
The argument of the article reviewed by our con
temporary did not relate to the side issue which it
has discussed, but it was directed to the fact that the
Railroad Commission is a failure and ought to be
abolished. We did not advocate wiping the commis
sion from the statute books entirely, because the
principle upon which it is founded contains a germ
of public utility. Besides, to abolish it entirely would
return the power to regulate railroad abuses to the
Legislature, where it was for many years a source
oi a great deal of political corruption. It was and is
our idea that if the present body were converted
into a railroad court and kept always open for the
hearing and determination, according to the rules of
law, of complaints against railroad corporations, it
would in the course of time render the State a great
deal of valuable service. In some of the States judi
cial processes have resulted not only in the correc
tion of railroad abuses, but in the virtual regulation
of fares and freights.
Notwithstanding the opinion of our contemporary
that .t would be inadvisable to remodel the Rail
road Commission, we think that body is no longer,
of any use It is true the courts have not denied'
it the jurisdiction to enact and enforce schedules of
freights and fares, but they have qualified its powers
in such a way as to effectually clip its wings. The
courts have held that the commission must allow a
railroad a reasonable rate of interest on its invest
ment before reducing its charges. This means that
it must allow a dividend. Practically, therefore, the
power to regulate is curtailed, for there is scarcely a
railroad corporation in the country that is paying
dividends on its watered capital. Some of them do
not even pay interest on their bonded indebtedness.
We can understand why the Southern Pacific doe 3
not want the Railroad Commission abolished. Its
elimination would restore the power to regulate its
charges to the Legislature, and that body every two
years would levy blackmail upon it. As we recall
the history of the commission it was established
mainly because the Legislature had proved recreant
to its trust in railroad matters. But why the corpora
tion objects to the establishment of a railroad court
such as we have suggested is not so clear. Is it possible
that the corporation does not want a judicial tribunal
to pass upon its acts â to deal out to it justice as
justice is dealt out to ordinary people? Will our
contemporary answer this question?
Policeman Gardiner, who has just been sworn in,
is a son of the man recently killed by an officer who
labored under the impression that he was shooting
at a burglar. It is almost safe to predict that Gar
diner will cultivate the habit of not shooting until he
has a definite idea as to the way his gun is pointed.
As to the changes contemplated at the pound, it
may be said in general terms that they will not be
satisfactory. Nothing will be recognized as approach
ing a state of perfection at that institution until ef
fective provision has been made for the impounding
of a few Supervisors:
If Swiftwater Bill arid his wife are to part, as in
timated by both of them, we hasten to extend such
congratulations as may be due, these to be divided
between the happy pair.
THE TELLER RESOLUTION.
AS was expected, the Teller resolution passed
the Senate by an emphatic majority. It is
a concurrent resolution, which if it pass the
House requires the signature of the President to be
come obligatory upon the Government. There is no
doubt that the President's speech in New York on
Thursday night was inspired by the certainty of its
passage in the Senate. He felt the necessity for a
counter declaration in support of the public credit,
and made it so emphatic that securities were
strengthened at once and the action of the Senate
was amply discounted. The bond and security mar
ket was buoyant because of the Presidential assur
ance that the resolution would die in his hands.
The resolution itself, while following the general
direction of the Matthews resolution of 1878, takes
on a different purpose entirely because of the entire
change in the situation. In 1878 silver was verj
nearly at par with gold on a ratio of 16 to 1. Now
it is oscillating at an average of 50 per cent beiow
par. Under these circumstances the enforced exer
cise of the Government's option to pay the national
bonds in silver would no doubt seriously affect its
credit and at the same time destroy its capacity to
maintain the parity of the two metals. Such an op
tion when the metals differed by a fraction "below or
above 1 per cent could have been used wisely to re
store parity. But when attempted with a difference
of 50 per cent it would simply increase disparity and
weaken the public credit.
The verbiage of the Teller resolution thrown into
the present condition raises a more serious issue
than the mere option to pay bonds in silver. It re
cites that the bonds of the Government arc payable
in silver dollars of the coinage of the United States
containing 412V2 grains of standard silver, " and that
to restore to its coinage such silver coins as a legal
tender in payment of said bonds, principal and in
terest, is not in violation of the public faith nor in
derogation of the rights of the public creditor."
This is a square expression in favor of the free
coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1. Counting the
pairs the vote against this was only thirty-seven in
the full Senate.
While the country is led to feel, for the present,
secure in the position of the President, the political
effect of the Senate's action is of the first conse
quence. It is notice to the fiatists that they have
a majority in the Senate to the end of this admin
istration, and the effect no doubt intended by the
free silver leaders is to redouble their efforts to
elect the House to be chosen next November. They
would then, for the first time since the issue was
made, have control of both houses and have the
ability to lay out the programme for 1900 in the
form of free silver bills. These would of course
meet the Presidential veto and the issue would be
made up. The Congressional elections of this year,
therefore, become more than ever the opening of
the next Presidential campaign.
There is no chance to secure a two-thirds majority
in either House to override the Presidential veto,
and the philosopher in politics may content himself
with the certainty that a fiat House in the Fifty
sixth Congress, with a concurring Senate, will alarm
all the business and industrial interests so thoroughly
that they will rally again in 1000 as in 1896 and defeat
the programme now outlined. But the wage payer
and the wage earner will meantime be suffering be
tween the upper and nether millstone. Therefore it
behooves the men who stand by financial stability
and who want peace and prosperity to see to it that
no fiat House is elected and that the two years be
fore the next Presidential election are given to the
national increase in basket and in store.
THE FIGHT FOR THE RIVERS.
IN the rush of other things we must not overlook
the fact that California has an important issue at
stake in the various bills that have been intro
duced into Congress making provision for the im
provement of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers. The proposed improvements will affect
either directly or indirectly almost every industry of
the State to a greater or less degree, and the strug
gle to obtain them ought therefore to be shared by
all who have the means, the energy or the influence
to help in the contest.
We must not leave our delegates in Congress to
make the fight alone. This Congress? is going to
practice economy. There is a heavy deficiency, left
over from the Democratic regime, to be made up in
the treasury, and although the Dingley tariff now
promises to yield ample revenues for carrying on the
Government and internal improvements, there will
be serious objections to undertaking any new work
until the deficiency has been straightened out and
the ample revenue is at hand as well as in sight.
Under these conditions the task of obtaining the
appropriations needed for our rivers will be a diffi
cult one. Comparatively few Eastern Congressmen
understand the importance of the work. A veritable
campaign of education will have to be carried on to
convince them of the great benefits that will accrue
from a prompt completion of the desired improve
ments. That campaign should be undertaken and
maintained by virtually the whole people of Cali
fornia, for if left solely to our delegates in Congress
the Congressmen from other States will conclude it
is' not a matter of much public interest nor of great
public concern since the people at large and indus
trial and commercial organizations are not showing
any ardor or energy in promoting it.
California has failed to obtain her due share of
appropriations for public improvements because she
has had a double handicap at Washington. In the
first place she has changed her Congressmen too
often, and has lacked in the Capitol the service of
experienced men with a large circle of friends among
the members of both houses. In the second place
she has never backed up her Congressmen with dele
gations from home as Eastern Congressmen are
backed.
When anything is wanted from the Government
for Boston, New York or Chicago a host of influen
tial men from chambers of commerce, boards of
trade and labor organizations in those cities go to
Washington and urge a favorable consideration of
their claims. Thus with experienced Congressmen,
strongly backed by forces at home, the Easterner
wins appropriations for works of comparatively little
importance while California loses in issues of great
moment.
We must overcome these handicaps so far as we
can, and the contest for river improvement is a good
opportunity to make the effort. All the political
energies of California should be exerted to win, and
exerted promptly.
Senator Lindsay of Kentucky is not embarrassed
by any doubt as to the course his constituents desire
him to pursue. The unanimity and force with which
they direct him to resign is so clear as to relieve his
mind of any uncertainty, albeit it may leave it bur
dened with various other things almost as discom
forting.
THE SAXFEAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JAXUARY 30, 1898.
THE FAIR FIND THE KLONDIKERS
IN addition to its general interest as an exposition
of mines and mining throughout the Pacific
Coast, the fair now open at Mechanics' Pavilion
will be of special value to all who are preparing to
enter the Yukon country as miners, or in any busi
ness whatever. In no other place can be seen such
a collection of articles and supplies of all t kinds
adapted for the climate of Alaska, and this in itself
would make the fair notable even if it lacked all
other exhibits and attractions.
Alaska is so completely unknown to the general
public that mere verbal descriptions convey but a
vague idea of what is needed by those who intend
to enter its gold fields and remain there during a
winter. Only by object lessons can the intending
prospector learn accurately what he needs and what
will be best suited for his comfort and his industry.
In this respect, therefore, the opening of the mining
fair is most timely and opportune. It supplies a real
need of producers and consumers. It will save money
and prove profitable to every intending visitor to
Alaska who attentively studies the exhibits and
posts himself on the quantity and quality of supplies
he will require and on the place where he can obtain
them on the best terms and in best condition.
Public attention, however, should not confine itself
ro the exhibit of Alaskan goods, nor even make that
the chief object of study. Despite the excitement
over the rich discoveries of gold in the frozen north,
there are reasons for believing that California re
mains the best mining country on the globe. Here,
at any rate, is the best field for the investment of
capital in mining enterprises on a large scale. In
this State the production of gold has ceased to be
a speculation and has become a legitimate industry.
Never were California mining investments safer than
at this time, and never were better inducements of
fered to men of wealth and enterprise to engage in
them.
San Francisco can safely invite visitors from all
parts of the Union to this fair, being well assured
that all will find in it either entertainment or instruc
tion sufficient to repay them for the visit. No other
exhibition of the year can compare with it in attrac
tiveness or in value to the business of the time. To
those who are going to undertake trie Alaskan ad

DESPITE the revelations made in the Mor
drnint divorce case and the baccarat scandal,
the Prince of Wales, according to his latest
biographer, possesses many of the attributes of a
good citizen, and since he sets the fashion for so
many Americans of means and manners, it will be
well to direct attention to some of these good quali
ties in the hope that he may be imitated in them as
well as in others not so excellent or so serviceable
to the general welfare.
To begin with, the Prince is a strict supporter of
home industries. He does not go abroad for any
thing made at home, nor patronize foreign mer
chants when home merchants keep the same goods.
He carries this principle to the degrtc of purchasing
all the supplies for his Sandringham home from the
shopkeepers cf that town instead of sending to
London for them, making it an : .' solute rule, we
are told, that all orders about San^ringham shall be
given to residents of the place in preference to em
ploying or bringing in outsiders.
Secondly, the Prince pays his way. He accepts no
free passes from either railroads or theaters. His
traveling expenses are heavy. He has to go up and
down the country, laying foundation stones, opening
public buildings, patronizing charity bazaars and at
tending festivals and ceremonials of one kind or an
other almost continually. On all occasions, how
ever, he pays his way and accepts nothing in the way
of expenses either from the railways . over
which he rides or from the committees that have in
vited his presence.
Again, the Prince pays his taxes and pays them
promptly without seeking a reduction. His resi
dence in London is not exempt as a royal palace,
but is assessed as a private house, and he pays his
parish taxes of $5000 a year like a good citizen and
never attends mass meetings or signs remonstrances
of protest against local tax rates.
The Prince, moreover, observes the Sabbath day
and respects his mother. Once while in Paris he
was invited by the President of the republic to at
tend a grand race at Longchamps on Sunday. It
was to be an occasion of state and all the digni
taries of the capital were to be present. The Prince
desired to go out of courtesy to his hosts and the
French people, on the principle that when one is in
Paris he should do as the Parisians do. He did not
venture, however, to act on his own judgment, but
sent a telegram to London and asked his good old
royal mother what he should do. She told him to
go to church, and he went to church.
As a supporter of home industry, a patron of local
merchants, an employer of neighborhood labor; as
a citizen who pays his taxes and does not bee: free
passes; as a grown man who follows the advice of
his mother, the Prince is a fairly good model for the
American millionaire. We regret to say, however,
it is not in these things that he is followed. His
biographer tells us it is in the matter of dress that
the Prince sets the fashion, "especially in America,
where every trifling change in his costume is im
mediately reported and imitated." It avails little
to be a model if one's clothes and foibles are copied
all over the world and one's virtues are left un
noted save by the villagers of Sandringham.
Public interest in the trial of the citizen arrested
for the slaughter of certain cats will not be lacking.
The point may seem small, and yet so many people
have felt themselves torn by an ardent wish to kill
a few of the howling felines that they would like
to know how they stand in the eyes of the law.
New York is hard to please. When there is a ball
there of a howlingly immoral variety people yell for
the police. When a ball is expected to be very bad
and turns out to be decent the people crowd the
box-office trying to get their money back, and the
papers make intimations of false pretenses.
The general sympathy with the Cuban cause will
not cause a widespread grief over the death of Aran
guren. He will be remembered as an officer who
ordered the execution of a friend who had come
to him under a flag of truce, and, war or no war,
nobody ever admired him for it.

Whether or not Professor Schenk's
theory of controlling the sex of gener
ations yet unborn has any sound basis
cannot yet be told. I hope fervently
that it has not, that Schenk is merely
the meddlesome crank he gives symp-
Toms of being, and that the people who
have purchased his right to relieve the
Creator of responsibility have paid for
a gold brick. The prejudice against
girl babies is one of the most wide
spread of heathen fallacies prevailing
among people partly civilized and prid
ing themselves upon being entirely so.
We have never gone to the length of
throwing the feminine infant to the
crocodiles, providence having in its
benign wisdom checked us by with
holding a supply of crocodiles. If
Schenk methods come in vogue they
must in time produce such a social
state that the girl will be at a premium
such as her brother can never hope
to touch. The brother develops to a
condition of usefulness. He consumes
cigarettes, is an ideal hoodlum, and in
instances makes a satisfactory con
vict, his inferior sister not being in the
competition. Anybody who can look
upon the girls of California, fair, ath
letic, queenly, and then vote for con
stituting a Schenk a subcreator is a
bigger fool than I am, a statement
which. I am assured by friends, reaches
the climax of emphasis. I can see no
beauty in a scheme to make women so
scarce that men must be depended on
for every duty short of wetnursing.
And some new Schenk may rise up in
the fullness of time to announce that
by a patent system of his own devis
ing he can equip them for this delicate
office.

The proposition the gentlemen in
charge of the Miners' Fair have made
to the ministers strikes me as having
many points of excellence. They would
have the ministers close their churches
at least, two Sundays while the fair is
in progress, and not only give their
parishioners a chance to attend, but at
tend themselves. The very fact that
such a proposition has been made in
good faith shows a broad and fraternal
spirit. I do not see how the ministers
can decline without confessing to
narrowness and tacitly declaring that
they do not wish to be fraternal. The
preachers, accepting, woul* come into
contact with men of affairs, but men
who 'seldom go to church. They would
acquire an influence among these by
showing a recognition of the half-for
gotten truth that there are ways* of
worshiping God outside the formal ser
mon and prayer. It seems to me the
ministers could not find a better way
to achieve popularityâ not in the vul
gar sense known to sensationalists, but
a genuine esteem â than to become the
guests of the miners. The miners would
feel hurt to have their hospitality
viewed in any light save that in which
it appears to them. They meet the
ministers more than half way. One of
their plans is to show the pastors just
what a mining camp was like in '49.
Could not the pastors draw from this
exhibition a lesson? Would not it send
them back to their pulpits with new
ideas of the progress of the church and
be an inspiration? The minister needs
keep in touch with a world which in
some instances is growing away from
him. Here, apparently, is an oppor
tunity. It may be there are preachers
who will not only decline to attend,
but will even object to having the fair
open on the day they have come to re
gard as their own. Happily, such min
isters are few, and growing fewer.
They are the spiritual filurians, and
people, growing: better as they mentally
expand, have left them behind. These
ministers hang at the rear of the ad
vancing throng, and moan of wicked
ness which they have trained them
selves to imagine. California prefers
the kind that keeps up with the pro
cession. I am mistaken if the ministers
do^not take the miners at their word
and the result be mutually profitable.
Probably it is with a pan? of regret
that the Examiner occasionally prints
the truth. It tells of many things
which never happen; and yet some
things do happen of such importance
that it canot ignore them. Its ordinary
fabrication is recognized at a glance to
be what Is technically known as a
"fake," and this, I take it, la the pur
pose of that noble sheet. One of its
gaudy lies can be detected as far as
the eye can reach. Therefore, there is
no reason for following it up with an
affidavit â the Examiner sign and sym
bol of fraudulency. The affidavit has
its proper place according to the yellow
standard. Let a story be veracious,
reasonable, credible, and over the Mis
sion-street Hearstlery there passes a
shudder of apprehension. What if
somebody should see and believe? To
be caught telling the truth! Horrible
thought! To meet an emergency like
this*, the affidavit mill is started, the
truth is sworn to, and then there falls
over it the comforting shadow of dis
trust, and happiness reigns once more.

were swooped down upon by 30,000.
Alas! how could they know that the
people of that carnivorous municipality
go wild at the sight of fresh meat?
How could it have been borne in upon
them in advance that Denver becomes
intoxicated at the prospect of a square
meal and gets delirium tremens if the
meal is to be free? When the horde
attacked the barbecue they simply
walked through it. In their enthusi
asm they did not pause to eat. No
body had time to eat. Did one get a
slice of beef another snatched it, and
in ensuing fights the flower of the city
was bathed in the steaming marrow of
the beasts slain to make a ho-liday. The
dull thud of the ham bone as It pelted
in the gaping countenance of the rash
and hungry, the smash of a hunk of
sirloin against the breasts of the brave
was sickening. Strong policemen look
ed and then turned around, deeming
it better to get swatted in the back
than to have their bosoms mussed with
gravy. Even the militia, accustomed
to- scenes of carnage, stole away on the
dead run. A barbecue in Denver might
be a success if the guests were but
chained to posts first and fed by means
of pitchforks. I fear that comely town
is degenerate. It has always been re
garded as proper there to raid a Chi
nese procession graveyard-bound, and
snatch the funeral baked meats, but I
supposed this was due to racial preju
dice and the sheer joy of stealing, and
at times when I have witnessed such
affairs, being there in the capacity of
society reporter, observed that the gen
tlemen engaged had the presence of
mind to eat what they stole. They
were enthusiastic, but not frenzied. I
can imagine a barbecue to be more en
ticing than a solitary roast pig, and
the people flocking thither licking their
chops. But I cannot imagine why they
refused to eat. Perhaps Denver is get
ting too refined. The absence of nap
kins from a function so dignified may
have proved irritating.

Not possessing scientific knowledge, I
confess with shame an entire inability
to see any sense in grafting one insect
upon another. It is a peculiar thing to
do, of course, and novelty has charms.
It is. true that when bugs are thus
united till death do them part, their
blending into a beauteous whole makes
one bug where had been two bugs be
fore, certainly a theoretical improve
ment; yet the fact must not be disre
garded that the one bug is a whopper
apt to have a double set of incisors. To
equip a biting bug with twin heads or
bestow upon the hornet the boon of a
pair of tails may be scientific, but I
should think science would rather be
doing sonjething else. Perhaps, how
ever, the hornet is not classed among
insects. It may be a bird. The flea is
an insect, beyond question, and even
now is a thing of terror. Give the flea
an extra set of legs and springs, an
extra lot of augers, chisels and drills
and would life be worth living? If the
man of science can divorce his atten
tion from the creation of freaks a mo
ment I would like him to answer. There
is an intimation that the experiments
tend to open an endless field. If the
mortal part of a bug can be amputated
from himself and annexed to something
else, there appears no reason why in
the exuberance of investigation the sci
entist should not soon have the ele
phant wearing the camel's hump, given
in exchange for a trunk. And there
does not flash on the startled intelli
gence reason why a scientist of a Jo
cose disposition might not catch a
friend asleep and cause to spring from
his head a donkey's ears, to be a last
ing Joy. To get back to the starting
place, I do not like bugs, but so far as
the association Is inevitable, I believe
the old-fashioned bug would be my
choice. The scientist may bend his en
ergies to the manufacture of new
fangled ones, but I remain true to the
Junebug of memory, the striped
beetle of youth, the warm and enter
prising wasp of long ago.
Several prospectors among the
crowds now going to the Klondike are
In search of a river of gold. In the ab

would be worth finding. Gold brought
down In a tank steamer and drawn off
Into barrels would be a pleasant varia
tion. Some there are who regard these
enthusiasts as over sanguine, but there
is not one In the lot of scoffers who
knows whether or not there is such a
stream. The mere fact that they have
never seen it Is no evidence. Nobody
ever picked up gold from the foot of a
rainbow, yet the existence of the metal
there has not been disproved. Indeed,
It seems not unreasonable that the
rainbow gold constitutes the source of
the river now being sought. Each suc
ceeding rainbow depositing its aurifer
ous accumulation, there would in time
be a vast supply. As the bow is so con
structed that it must shed water, the
probability that it would start a stream
can be recognized, and this would na
turally wash away the gold, and there's
your river. But if a transitory rainbow
ap do a thing like this, the capacity
>t the aurora borealis, a more station
iry affair, can hardly be calculated.
The gold must slide ndown its perpen
dicular sides in vast quantity. The
lurora. however, presumably springs
from the northern sea, and has been
loing it for, quite a while. The logical
conclusion is that the water there
abouts must be a sea of gold. This is
what the gentlemen should try to find.
I would not- advise them to monkey
with a mere river.
The Clark creatures who have come

of the man and woman which is worth
taking up, because there have been of
late so many instances similar. I re
fer to the maudlin professions of re

terms with Christ, to be "saved." I
would like to know what they have
been "saved" from, so as to be able
to take steps to avoid being likewise

a grave mistake made by good but en
thusiastic people when they visit such

George Clark, fresh from the murder of
his brother, reeking of a deeper guilt,
to lead in prayer: think of him clasp
ing his hands, kneeling and making

cause of religion and check a natural
respect for evangelistic zeal than can
be overcome by the thunder of the

Last week I found It necessary to
write a paragraph concerning the fa
cility with which Arthur McEwen for
gets such friends as may no longer bÂ«
of use to him, and cited a few Illus
trations. The paragraph gave him
full credit for ability, and I have seen
no occasion for modifying it In the
least. McEwen's letter this week
bears out my estimate. The latest
friend whom he has deserted is Judge
Maguire in extolment of whose vir
tues he has expended much ink. It
is true that while here McEwen wrote
something in disparagement of the
Judge, but he wrote at the same time
much more forcefully in his praise.
The encomium was supposed to be
heartfelt, and the contrary to be in
response to the opportunity to make
space rates, an anomalous course
which McEwen is ever ready to defend.
Yet in the present instance he is less
at fault than would appear. He did
nothing more than briefly insult his
old friend, by insinuation more than
by actual word. The graver fault was
that of the paper which published the
letter. This paper is under the disad
vantage of being misconducted editor
ially by a brainless blackguard, and
naturally there is little to be expected
of it. The letter was so set forth in
large type as to create a false impres
sion relative to its character. It really
contained much of interest, and the
Maguire reference was only an item.
I would be glad to see McEwen suc
ceed in the East and do not question
that he is competent to do so. But he
cannot expect to retain any reputation
for sincerity if he continues to make
his hero of one hour the villain of the
next.

The note of warning sounded by The
yesterday morning regarding the
'- danger of a raise in Oakland water
rates met with a responsive chord in
the city across the bay. The people re
alized the danger, and were earnest in
their commendation of The Call for its
exposure of the combination to raise
the rates.
F. Girard, who has always stood by
the people during his incumbency in
the Council, was especially pleased with
the fact that The Call had taken the
matter up. "There is something up,"
said he. "It is plain that there is a
move pn foot to raise the rates, and the
action of The Call in calling the atten
tion of the people to the conditions will
do much to prevent the combination
" from hurting the people. I have been
appro-ached too much by people from
the water companies telling me how to
do and how to act, and I am tired of
. It. I know my own business, and don't
belong to either company, and shall
work for the people all the time. I
don't want any of their bluffers com- ',
ing around telling me what to do. My
record is plain, and they should know
that lam always for the people. I
shall be in favor of a reduction of rates
rather than a raise, and when the time
come? 1 will see to it that the people
do not get the worst of it. The people
pay me my salary,' and I am working
for them."
This interview Indicates the danger
that was noted in the article in yester
day's Call. There have been "bluffers"
at work on members of the Council,
telling them what to do in the water
rate matter. Just whom they have
been to. cannot be told, but it is certain
that influence has been brought to bear
(on some of the members in the hope
of having something done that would
assist the water companies in getting
back some of the money that has been
arted In the fight which has been go
ing on for the past three years. While
the officials of the company are stren
uous in their denials of any intention
of having the rates raised, and while
they say that all that is intended is to
- have a "little readjustment" of rates.
it is evidently the intention to have the
Council, or at least the committee to
â¢which is referred the matter, investi
gate the question of values and make
a- new rating on a new basis.
According to Councilman Henneber-
TT. who is chairman of the Fire and
Water Committee, there is at present
no legal rate. He says that the fact
that the retiring Council did not pass the
ordinance last year in February, but left
It for the incoming Council to pass, vi
tiated the ordinance, and the result is
now the whole thing is wide open and
the companies can charge what they
please. : *l
Frank K. Mott, who was chairman of â

last Council, was much pleased with ,
the action of The Call in showing to !
th/? people of Oakland the danger '
which menaced them. He said that It j

which would mean a raise all along
the line. Mr. Mott said that when the ;

Ing, and availed themselves of the first
opportunity to reduce them to a fair
basis, thereby saving hundreds of
thousands of dollars to the people of
the city.
"After a thorough investigation of
the cost, value and revenue of the
i Contra r*osta Water Company," said
! Mr. Mott, "it was clearly shown that
; a great reduction in the existing water
: rates could be made, and should have
: been made many years before. Our
; committee made a very careful ar.d
I searching Investigation relative to the
i value of this company's plant, and we
found that there were many items in
the company's estimate that had no
bearing whatever on the value. We
cut out everything that did not belong
| there, eliminating a lot of land that
; had been bought to keep other com
panies from obtaining water rights,
and also eliminating properties that
j were plainly investments. The result
was that instead of a valuation of more
than six million dollars we reduced it
i to below two million, and then, to set
off any possible mistake, we added
enough to make it reach $2.424. fif.9 SI
On this valuation the rates were fixed,
giving the company 5 per cent income
annually. If they have lost money, it
is because they have cut the rates to
such an extent that they could not
make anything."
While there Is a general feeling
among the people of Oakland against
making a fight on the water compan
ies, or on any other corporations, for
that matter, it is thought that the rate
cutting that has been going on be
tween the two companies has done
more harm to the city than the saving
has benefited the Individuals. There
has been much of politics In the fight,
and the Board of Health was brought
into it to the extent that a special
committee of that body made an in
vestigation into the water supplies of
the two companies, with the evident
intent to show that the Contra Costa
Company got its water from sources
which were deleterious to the health
of the city.
The report of this committee strongly
condemned the water supply of the
Contra Costa Company and praised
the good water of the Oakland Com
pany. This report was printed in
pamphlet form and scattered broadcast
over the city, and also sent out over the
State. In it was suggested that the
prevalence of zymotic diseases in the
c-ity was due to the use of the Contra
Costa water. "While the people of Oak
land understand the animus of the
attack, and knew that.it was inspired
by an effort to aid the Oakland Water
Company, the report was utilized by
the enemies of Oakland to the disad
vantage of that city. In other cities
the real estate dealers kept files of the
Oakland papers, and also numbers of
the Board of Health pamphlet, on hand
for the inspection of Eastern visitors
who contemplated the purchase of
property and who had a desire to visit
Oakland before buying.
The startling statements regarding
sickness and disease which were thus
sent broadcast had the effect of turn
ing many away who otherwise would
have investigated the advantaees of
Oakland before settling down elsewhere
in the State.
While the water companies were re
sponsible for these statements they
forgot that Health Officer Dunn was
not a politician and so did not look af
ter his report which was published
January 11. In this he showed con
clusively that the report of the spe
cial committee had been biased and
without foundation, for instead of Oak
land being an unhealthy city it is one
of the healthiest in the country. He
says in his report:
"Comparison with other cities shows
that the death rate in New Orleans is
23.34 per thousand. In New York 21.r>2,
San Francisco 17.08, Sacramento 15.60.
while in Oakland it Is 12.22. The very
low death rate from zymotic diseases
wns a marked feature in last year's
report."

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 30, 1898.
MOROSCO'S NOVELTY IN ARCHITECTURE.
Designs have been prepared for Walter Morosco, the well-known theatrical man, for a cottage that will be
a novelty in its way. It will be built at Geranium Place, three miles east of Fruitvale, on plans by Victor de
Prosse, a local architect of note and designer of the Pabst Cafe building. The handsome structure will be located
on a gently sloping hill, where all its salient features will be cast into bold relief. In style the building will be
modeled after the European mountain houses and will oocupy a space 85x130 feet.
The interior will be divided into a grand hall, to which the owner also attaches the adjective "somber," large
parlors and dining rooms, library and other features of a modern mansion. The plumbing and other accessor
ies will be of the very best pattern extant. At one end of the "somber" hall, the room in which guests will be
entertained, will be placed a magnificent organ. Opposite is to be situated a fourteen-foot double staircase,
with elegant Italian wood-carved figures surmounting the columns. Another feature of Interest will be a nine
foot bowlder and clinker brick fireplace.
It will thus be seen that the popular theatrical man is not content with driving an eight-tandem team
through the park with his own single-line arrangement, but must needs have a country residence to do a little
entertaining at odd hours.
In water rates to the detriment of bus
iness methods of the city, the water
companies have furnished false argu
ments to the enemies of the city with
which to drive away possible purchas
ers of homesteads. It is this fact that
causes the people to feel that while
they have no fight to make on corpor
ations they have a desire to see the
water companies suffer for their own
misdeeds and recoup themselves for
their losses by a return to legitimate
business methods rather than by a
raise in rates at the expense of the
people.
While it may not be the intention of
the two companies to form a business
alliance it is evident from their actions
that they have determined to form an
alliance having for its object the rais
ing of rates to a figure that will per
mit them to recover some of the money
recklessly spent in vain endeavor to
run each other out of business. It is
this combination that threatens dan
ger to the people, and should the mem
bers of the Council see fit to make a
change of basis upon which to fix the
rates for the coming year it would
mean that a series Of juggling would
take place which would end only when
the water companies got a figure that
would restore much of the 'lost ground.
The Call has warned the people and
has shown exactly wherein the danger
lies. It is for the people of 'Oakland
to save themselves by a strong and
determined stand against any juggling
with rates. If the rates now in vogue
were satisfactory to the companies for
the past three years while they were
fighting they are certainly high enough
to be satisfactory now with an in
creased population and no additional
investment on the plants. This is the
position taken by the conservative
members of the Council and this is the
position which will be maintained by
the people.
The water companies have had their
friends at work trying to bring argu
ment and influence to bear on the
members of the Council which is a
sure indication .that something is in
tended that needs bolstering. The peo
ple, knowing this fact, will watch
closely the action of the Council in or
der to prevent. If possible, any "re
adjustment" which will mean a heavy
tax on the users of water.

referred to as the "Dago." The "Dago"

so unsophisticated a being as the

possibly have the. cunning to circum
vent two such wise persons as bin
tormentors. A little circumstance that
occurred the other day, however, has
rather shaken their faith In their' own
acuteness and the simplicity of the
"Dago." The "Dago" had purchased a
ticket in the lottery, and with his ac
customed faith In human nature had
shown it to his friend "Dutchman." The

Of sunny Italy came out to the front of
the cigar stand to clean up. as usual, and
as he set about the work he handed' the
man behind the counter a list of the win
ning: numbers that he had Just received,
telling that person to glance over It and
see if there was anything doing, as he
himself had not yet had time to look.
The first number that Charlie sought for
was the one he remember. to have seen

cast his eye down the column and found
that it had drawn an approximation

luck of some people who haven't enough
savvy to come in but of the rain. "Have
1 anything there. Charlie?" asked the
"Dago." as he continued to push the mop
over the floor. "Not a thing, old man,"
answered the wily German, "but I hate
to see you come out at the short end

chance to help you out. A fellow came
in here and said that every ticket in the
city had been sold and that we could not
purchase one for love or .money. We bet
him $10 we could. Now. if you keep your
mouth shut about the matter we will give
you $2 50 for your ticket, which is no
good to you now." The transaction was
made and the "Dago" went Inside, leav
ing Charlie and Skinner laughing over
the way they had fooled him at the small
expense of $1 25 apiece.
Just then the lottery agent came by

for. collection. "This ticket Is worth
nothing," said the seller of chances. "The

"Dago" and found by careful inspection
that the last figure of the fatal number
had, by means ;of â¢ a little ink, been
changed from a 6 to an S.
This story got out bocause the "Dago"
was so simple that ho could not keep

SAYS THE BEER
WAS DRUGGED
John C. Traynor Robbed
in a Barbary Coast
Dive.
His Purse and Watch Taken
From Him While He Slept
in a Chair.
Picked Up by a Policeman and
Charged With Being
Drunk.
J- C. Travnnr, whn lives on Na
toma street, near Fifth, claims he
was drugged in a saloon on Jacks- >n
street, below Kearny, Friday nierht.
and robbed of $22 50. Last evening he
visited police headquarters and in
formed Chief Lees of the occurrence.
Traynor is employed as a laborer on
the new ferry building. Friday even
ing he was naid off. and. being
anxious to make some purchases, he
walked along Jackson street to
Kearny. Meeting a friend, he invited
him to have a drink, and together they
entered the saloon in which he claimed
he was drugged. Traynor called for
a glass of beer, and after drinking it
he became drowsy and fell asleep.
When he awakened, some time after
ward, his purse, containing $22 50. was
gone, as well as a cheap silver watch
which he carried in his vest pocket.
Realizing he had been drugged.
Traynor accused the bartender of
having robbed him. The latter, he
says, seized him by the throat and
after severely choking him threw him
in the street. In the struggle he lost
his hat. Traynor wandered around the
streets until he was picked up by
Policeman Minnehan. who took him to
the City Pris.-n, where he was charged
with being drunk. Judce Campbell, on
lc.:rning his story, promptly released
him.
To Chief Lees last night Traynor
said he- was not a drinking man. He
emphatically denied that he was under
the influence of liquor at the time he
entered the saloon.
"I had Just quit work." he remarked
when telling his story, "'and as I was
anxious t<> tret some provisions I
walked up Jackson street as far as
Kearny. It whs there I met the friend
who accompanied me to the saloon.
After drinking the beer I felt rather
queer, and turning to my friend told
him of my suspicions. I then fell into
a chair and went to sleep. What be
came of him Ido not know. lam con
vinced, however, that he knew nothing
of the robbery."
After listening to the story Chief
Lees detailed Detective Tom Gibson to
Investigate the matter. Gibson visited
the saloon where Traynor claimed to
have been robbed, but the proprietor
emphatically denied having seen him.
Traynor says he will to-day swear out
a warrant for the arrest of the bar
tender charging him with robbery.

CONGRESS AND SILVER.
QUIETUS ON
THE TELLER
RESOLUTION
Leaders of the House
Decide to Lose
No Time.
Adverse Report Will Be
Made by Ways and
Means Committee.
And To-Morrow the Matter
Will Be Disposed Of With
out Delay.
PROMPT ACTION IN ORDER.
Representatives to Show the Country
That They Are Not Ready
for a Silver Basis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 29.
The determination was reached by '
the leaders in the House of Representa- i
tives to-day that the Teller resolution '
for the payment of bonds in silver,
passed by the Senate last night, should
be disposed of by the House on Mon
day, in order that the attitude of that
branch of Congress might be placed be- :
fore the country immediately. This
conclusion was reached after numerous
conferences between Speaker Reed, ;
Chairman Dingley of the Ways and |
Means Committee, Dalzell and Hender-
Bon of the Rules Committee and other i
Influential members of the House. Late ,
In the day the resolution, which had j
ccme over from the Senate, was re
ferred by the Speaker to the Ways and ]
Means Committee, and Chairman Ding- \
ley at once gave notice of a special
meeting of the committee at 10:30 Mon- j
day morning. At the same time he |
notified Democratic members of the ]
committee what his general purpose
was, substantially as follows: The reso- j
lotion will be considered by the com- i
mittee on Monday and an adverse re- j
port made on it. No amendment or '
change in the phraseology will be made. ''
but the adverse report will be on the
resolution as it stands. This will be I
Bubmitted to the House when it con
venes on Monday, and plans made to
dispose of the matter before the day's
session closes.
As to the procedure on the floor.
Dingley made no prediction, beyond
paying that it was proposed to dispose
of the subject on Monday. This will '
doubtless require a special rule as to i
debate. A basis for such a rule was
presented to-day by Dalzell in the form !
of a resolution providing that the reso- I
lutlon be considered immediately after '
the report of the Ways and Means !
Committee. The committee will prob
ably be ready to report by 12 o'clock,
so that under the Dalzell resolution the !
debate will begin shortly after noon.
It is probable that before the House
assembles the Dalzell resolution will be
so arranged as to shape the hours erf
debate and set a time for a vote.
The determination to bring the sub- j
Ject to an immediate issue gave gen- j
eral satisfaction among the majority ;
of the members. Some had desired to i
put aside all other business to-day and
vote down the Teller business before
the week closed. Representative
Johnson of Indiana took the lead in \
urging this movement. It was finally i
concluded, however, to let the reso
lution go to the Ways and Means
Committee with the direct assurance
of Chairman Dingley that the issue
would be pressed to a conclusion on
Monday.
Soon after Speaker Reed reached the
Capitol he was called on by members
of the Rules Committee, with a view to
determining what course should be
adopted. Chairman Dingley, the floor
leader, favored a reference to the Ways
and Means Committee, and gave assur
ances that prompt action would be
taken, doubtless by an adverse report j
to the House. This view was shared j
by Dalzell and Henderson of the Rules
Committee.
A strong feeling developed, however,
for Immediate action without the usual
reference to a committee. Represen
tative Johnson of Indiana, a member
of the Currency Committee, called on
the Speaker and urged this line of ac
tion. He said that the House should
act to-day, thus giving an immediate
answer to the country to offset the ac
tion of the Senate last night. Delay
even for a few days, he urged, would j
permit the silver majority in the Sen
ate to secure a prestige before the
country, which they would not have if
the House acted immediately. He
asked that the views of the other mem
bers on that proposition be secured,
and Johnson interviewed a number
who favored prompt action.
In the meantime the resolution came
over from the Senate and was laid
aside temporarily until a definite line
of action could be agreed upon. The
current of sentiment was for a refer
ence to the Ways and Means Commit
tee, the understanding being that this
committee might not wait until the
usual weekly meeting next Wednesday
but would have a special meeting eariy
In the week in order to make an ad
verpe report.
There was some talk that the reso
lution offered gave the opportunity to j
engraft upon it an amendment clearly i
defining the views of the majority in !
the House, and some urged that this
course should be pursued. This did not
meet with favor, however, as it threat- â 
ened a possible division in the major- I
lty, while it was said that the solid Rp. j
publican vote, not including the avowed
Silver-Republicans, would be given to
an adverse report.
After further conference Dalzell In
troduced the following resolution:
"Resolved, That immediately upon
the report to the House by the Commit
tee on Ways and Means of the Senate
concurrent resolution No. 22 (Teller
resolution) it shall be In order to pro
ceed to the consideration of said re
port."
This was referred to the Rules Com

AT THE FORUM CLUB RECEPTION.
Fashionable Crush in Which Club and Society
Women Were Well Represented.
The ladies of the Forum Club entertained their fellow clubwomen and
friends at a reception in their new quarters, In Central block, yesterday
afternoon, and the result was a fashionable crush. In which were mingled
all the representative clubwomen as well as the prominent social leaders.
It was a delightfully genial crush. The ladies came early and remained
late. They partook with affable grace of the elaborate refreshments of
fered for their delectation, and ceased at regular intervals the merry hum
of conversation to listen tc and applaud the excellent musical programme
arranged for their approval and delight.

lines that have long been the aim of all women's clubs. The rooms are
large, comfortable and airy, and furnished with that artistic touch that
makes even the stiffest corner cozy and inviting. The large lecture-room
is easily converted into a reception-hall. The clubrooms proper, with the
adjoining blue and white tearoom, are open all day. Writing material Is
nt hand, tea always ready to be Fervr-d in fetching delft, and a dainty
maid is in attendance to offer the hospitality the club affords to all Its mem
bers
Yesterday the bright and pretty rooms were gay with fragrant blos
soms. Cordons of greenery and bright red berries lent a festive appearance
to the rooms, and lamps and incandescent lights, all shaded In red, shed a
soft, entrancing light over the brilliant scene.
The ladies of the club acted as a reception committee, and were all
gowned in modish reception costume.
The hours of the reception were from 3 till 6 o'clock, during M'hich fully
1200 ladies were entertained.
Miss Boyan, Miss Edmunds, Mrs. Martin Schultz, Mr. Rolk^r, Mr.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, BFKDAT, JANUARY 30, 1898.
ALL KINDS
OF TALK IN
THE HOUSE
An Abatement of the
Political Debate
Not in Sight.
Wide Range of Discussion
on the Appropriation
Bills.
But It Is All Merely a Struggle
for Political Advan
tage.
ACRIMONY IS DISPLAYED.
Statesmen Not in Accord on the
Subject of the Return of
Prosperity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, Jan. 29.
There seems to be no prospect of an
abatement of the political debate
which has been In progress In the
House during the consideration of the
appropriation bills. Again to-day al
most the entire session was consumed
in the discussion of political topics.
The controverted question . as to
whether prosperity had arrived at
tracted the most attention and inter
est, and testimony pro and con was
offered throughout the House. At times
considerable acrimony was displayed,
but as a rule the debate was pood
natured, both sides seeming to recog
nize that it was merely a struggle to
score political advantages.
At the opening of the session 'of the
House a bill to permit the building of a
bridge across the Mississippi River at
Coon Rapids, at the northern limits of
the city of Minneapolis, was passed. ..â¢
Immediately afterward the clerk of
the Senate appeared and transmitted the
Teller resolution, which passed the Sen
ate last night The announcement was
greeted with a terrific outburst of ap
plause from the Democratic side of the
House. No motion was made at the time
and the resolution remained on the table.
The fortification appropriation bill was
referred, and, on motion of Grout (R.)
the House went into committee of the
whole and resumed the consideration of
the District of Columbia bill. â¢---
The general debate was not confined to
the subjects dealt with by the bill. It
covered a wide range. The Teller resolu
tion, the Cuban question, the Hawaiian
annexation, the tariff and other pollClcal
topics were discussed. â  -'. ; â - v
At the conclusion of the general debate
the bill was taken up for amendment
under the five-minute rule.
King (D.) of Utah raised a laugh by
offering an amendment to appropriate
$50,000 for the improvement of the white
House, "to make It a suitable abode for
Hon. Mark Hanna." The amendment was
ruled out of order.
Simpson (Pop.) of Kansas commented
upon President McKinley'a speech at the
manufacturers' dinner, in New York, say-
Ing that the attempt to make all the ob
ligations of the United States payable in
the dearest money in the world was
"dress coat anarchy." He said it was
now the fashion for Republicans to sneer
at "backwoods statesmen," and he re
minded the majority that all the Republi
can heroes of the past had come from the
rural district. The Republican party, he
declared, had at last become the open
defender of plutocracy.
Tongue (R.) of Oregon, in a spirited re
ply, denounced the Populists and Demo
crats for being responsible through, the
passage of the Wilson tariff bill for the
depression and poverty of the farming
classes.
The discussion became very animated
when the topic of prosperity was reach
ed. Richardson (D.) of Tennessee pre
cipitated it, and Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio.
Cochran (1).Â» of Missouri. Hopkins (R.)
of Illinois. M lhany (R.) of New York and
Fitzgerald (D.) of Massachusetts took

part. The latter again brought up the
New England cotton strikes, which have
played considerable part in the - debate
on previous days. Simpkins (R.) of Mas
sachusetts, in the course of his reply,
drew a round of applause from the Dem
ocratic side by stating that he frankly
confessed that, in his opinion, there were
likely to be more strikes under a protec
tive than under a free trade system. The
applause ceased, however, and arose on
the other side when he added that this
was because under a free trade sustem
men would have no work, and when they
did it would be for what they could get.
For some time the debate was confined
to the business situation in Massachu
setts, Knox, McCall and other Republi
cans of that State contesting: the position
advanced by Fitzgerald that prosperity,
had not come to the commonwealth un
der the Dingley law.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa created some en
thusiasm on the Republican side when he
read the Dun Trade Review as an an
swer to the Democratic critics as to the
effects of the Dingley law. Members of
the House, he said, no matter what their
politics, have no right, in attempting to
score a little cheap political capital, to
become the libellers and slanderers of
their country.
Allen (D.) of Mississippi enlivened the
proceedings with one of his witty
speeches. He said he was tired of hav
ing Dingley get up every day and explain
why his bill had not met the expectations
of the country. It was very absurd, he
said, but it was with the same serious,
solemn mien with which the Jewish
clothier explained to him how he was
able to sell goods below cost. In the
course of some remarks in a more serious
vein Allen aroused the Democrats to ap
plause by quoting the following from a
speech delivered by President McKlnley
in the House in 1890, when the McKinley
bill was under consideration: "When
merchandise is cheapest men are poorest,
and the most distressing experiences in
the history of our countryâ yea. in all
human historyâ been when every
thing was the lowest and cheapest meas
ured by gold, for everything was higher
and dearest measured by labor."
After some further remarks by Dins
more (D.) of Arkansas and Pitney (R.) of
New Jersey. Todd (D.) of Michigan and
Hawley (R.) of Texas, the House at 5
p i 12' f . ter completing seventeen pages
of the bill, adjourned.
ENGLISH PLANS
IN NICARAGUA.
They Contemplate the Entire
Commercial Control of the
Country.
Oreat Britain Anxious to Secure a
Railroad to Parallel tho
Canal.
Copyright, !Â«?', by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, Jan. 29.â Advices just re
ceived from the Herald's correspondent
with the Nicagagua Canal Commission,
under date of Managua, state that if
English plans succeed the entire commer
cial control of Nicaragua will be in Eng
lish hands.
According to these advices the British
Atlas Company has offered $5,000,000 for
the Government railroads and steamers.
The Government wants $6,000,000. An
agent of the Atlas line has left London
to come here to try to make terms. Ger
many, through her Consul, promises a
bid from â  German syndicate, and asks
that the Government wait. The Gov
ernment will not close with England be
fore receiving the German bid. It would
pr f<r an American bid for the three
â teamen and the 109 miles of railroad to
be sold. Such a purchase would prevent
any other syndicate from operating in the
country.
If the Atlas Company gets the road It
will have through lines from the Atlan
tic to the Pacific. The Atlas bid is taken
here as an indication that the canal will
be built, and that England will have a
way across the country practically paral
lel with the canal.
NO OPEN RUPTURE BETWEEN

VALPARAISO, Jan. 29.â Senor Mor

tween Argentina and Chile. It now de
relopa that Senor Moreno, the Argentina
Boundary Commissioner, is only on two

RUFFIN`S SENTENCE COMMUTED.

BACRAM&NTO, Jan. 29. â Governor
Bvdd to-day commuted the sentence of
K. W. Ruffin, who was tried and con
victed of defrau<ling an innkeeper in San
I'rancisco last October. The reasons set
f.irth arc that at the time he assumed
his oblipati.il to the innkeeper whom he
v. as convicted nf defrauding; he believed
himself to be of sufficient l.nancial abil
ity to discharge the same. Rufttn has a
wife and child dependent upon him for
support, and his- pardon was asked> for
by the Judge before whom he was tried
and the Prosecuting Attorney, besides
the complaining witness, who has been
given a promissory note covering the
amount Ol the indebtedness.

Washington, Jan. 29.
Representative Loud of California. ; *
chairman of the Committee on Post- i
offices and Post Roads, was inclined to }
be amused to-day at the publication of <
a story charging that he had called the i
delegation of Brooklyn citizens who <
came to "Washington to see him about \ i
a proposed reduction of the letter car- ', i
rier force "asses." j i
"I doubtless did criticize their ac- I 3
tion," said Mr. Loud. "I did say to \ i
them that I was surprised that men of i
their intelligence and reputation should ; <
be engaged in holding meetings to pro- ! )
test against something when they had ! 'i
not investigated the subject and did j i
not know what they were protesting j <
about. They denounced me as chair- i ;
man of the Committee on Postoffices i !
and Post Roads for an act of purely \ ]
departmental administration. That <
was all that I said, and if the grentle- ]
men have gone away and said they <
were characterized as ' asses.' it <
must have been from an overpowering <
sense of the fitness of things." <
NEW YORK, Jan. The World .
prints the following editorially: "There , <
is another Congressman with a mouth. :
His name is Loud. It is a name that ; <
is curiously apropos. Loud is chair- ,
man of the House Committee on Post- j i
offices. It has been his task to ex- ! ;
plain and defend the stupid proposi- ! j
tion to cover a deficiency by reducing ,
carrier forces and consequently the ;
incomes of great city postoffices. In :
explaining this policy Loud revealed j
the fact that the deficiency had been j
caused by political maneuvers in mak- j
ing places as carriers for Republican j
'boys' in localities where no carriers ;
were needed. Presumably Loud has
been taken to task for his little slip, ;
and the scolding has made him ill- I
tempered. That presumption will ac- j
count for his turning on the delegation !
of Brooklyn business men yesterday
morning and calling them a 'pack of
d d asses' for . coming to argue
aginst the proposed crippling of their â 
city's mail service. But accounting
for Loud's brutal impertinence is not \
excusing it. The man guilty of this I
outbreak is an insult to the national
decency and intelligence bo long as he
sits in Congress. Cannon, of Illinois :
was punished by his own State for a !
scarcely worse offense than this. What j
will happen to Loud of California?"

ments of coal have not relieved the
market to any appreciable extent. Very
few of the black diamonds found their
way into yards, as retailerstookthecoal
away as quickly as it was discharged
out of the colliers. The withdrawal of
steamers and sailing vessels from the
trade in order to carry passen;;
Dyea and Skaguay has caused all tin
trouble, and there will be no relief for
the consumer until the rush tv the Yu
kon is over.
The ship Yosemite is to be turned into
a passenger vessel. All her" spars are
to be sent dowr and she will be towed
between Seattle and Dyea. Captain
Thomas Gattenby, formerly mate of the
vessel, will go out as master, vice Cap
tain Fullerton, who takes command of
the ship Harry Morse. The Yosemite
has been sold to E. F. Sweeny of Se
attle.
The bark Forest Queen Is also to Join
the Klondike fleet. She will go from
here to Tacoma to load lumber for San
Diego, after which she will be turned
Into a passenger b^at. She will be
built up- and on her arrival at Dyea
will be turned into a hotel. She will
have first-class accommodation, and
the chances are she will not lack pat
ronage. The Eclipse will serve as a
floating hotel at St. Michael, and Dyea
and Skaguay are not to be behind in
that respect.
The steam schooner Sunol has been
Fold by the L. E. White Lumber Com
pany to C. A. Hooper <S: Co. Tt is not
settled as to whether she will run to
Dyea or remain in the lumber trade.
J. R. Hanify is building a new
Bteamer for the lumber trade, and Cap
tain Johnson of the steam schooner
Scotia will command her. The Scotia.
in command of Captain Hansen, will
sail for Dyea and Skaguay via Seattle
next Tuesday.

Learning that some remarkable

a cancer. Later one appeared in the

of and visited Dr. Chamley and was
Immediately impressed with his. method.
In August, 1597, i commenced treat
ment. Within twelve days from that
time the cancers dropped out without
any pain. The sores healed rapidly,
leaving very little scars. I cannot
â peak too highly of Dr. Chamley and
his treatment."
A second call was made upon Mr.
Thomas F. Fish of room 29. Nevada
block, who said: "A few years ago a
little sore appeared on the lower lid of
my eye which proved to be a cancer. It
affected the eyeball and I lost the use
of the eye. A friend in Los Angeles
wrote me to go to Dr. Chamley and be
cured. In twenty days the cancer
came out. I recommend his cure to
all."

CHARLES W. WILLEY'S WRECKED LIFE.
Charles Walter Willey, a young man who recently broke his father's -will,
and was awarded property of the value of 5125,000, was found dead in his
bed yesterday morning in his room at 1145 Mission street. A gas jet turned
partly on and the presence In the apartment of a suffocating quantity of
gas told the story of the sad ending of a wrecked and wasted life.
The deceased was 26 years old, the son of the late Amasa P. V\'illey, who
died in this city on February 16, 1893. He was the only child, but was a
grief instead of a blessing to his parents because of his appetite for liquor.
In 1892 he married Miss Georgietta Stevens, both being under age. and they
took up their residence with the parents of the groom. His mcrther died
soon after, and left her son the income of a piece of property on the cor
ner of Powell and Clay streets, amounting at that time to about $160 per
month, but at present it is not yielding more than $30 or $40 a
month. Young Wil'ey's wife subsequently obtained a divorce from him on
the ground of habitual intemperance, and was awarded $50 per month ali
mony. He never paid It except under compulsion, and on one occasion
he was confined five days in jail for contempt of court for refusing to pay
it. There is now due Miss Stevens about $1000 for alimony.
Amasa Willey left a will in which he bequeathed his property to trus
tff-s to be distributed by them to distant relatives in the East and to vari
ous charitable institutions, part to be distributed immediately and the re<
mainder after the death of his ft n. to whom he left an income of $500 per
year, with the proviso that if hi son should contest the will the allowance
should be stopped.
Shortly after his father was buried young Willey called an auctioneer
Into the house and sold all the furniture, and on the day he became of age
he mortgaged his income from his mother's estate for $1000, and squandered
the money in dissipation.
For several months past the young man has been rooming in the
house of Mrs. Harvey, his aunt having paid the rent for him. He had been
drinking more heavily than usual for the past week or so. It is not be
lieved that he committed suicide. He had undressed and had gone to bed
and presumably to sleep, for the bed clothing had been gathered around
him, and he was in the position of one in a natural sleep. The gas stop
cock was turned on about half way.
The deceased succeeded in breaking the will of his father, but the trus
tees have appealed to the Supreme Court.
A Curious Occident.
F. Anderson, an employe of the Bibb
Lumber Company's planing mill, Bay
and Stockton streets, met with a curious
accident yesterday afternoon. One of the
belts broke and a copper rivet was pro
pelled with such force that It struck his
boot and â went through Into his foot. HÂ«
was taken to the Receiving Hospital in
the ambulance, where the rivet was ex
tracted by Dr. Fitzpibbon.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with

OPENING OF THE MINING FAIR
AND CLOSING OF THE JUBILEE.
THE Golden Jubilee celebration is
â â  and the Mining Fair has
opened. President McKinley sent
an electric spark flashing at
the continent and at his touch a
bell in the Mechanics' Pavilion
tolled the end of one event and i I
a welcome to another. Fifty taps were
given on the bell. One for each year
of the fifty that California has pros
pered since Marsh; i the- tirst
Bpeck of gold in the State at Butter's
Mill.
Over six thousand people crowded
into the Pavilion and cheered the Ju
bilee celebration as it closed and

cheered again when the bell announced
the opening of the fair. The first tap
on the bell started the machinery of
the fair In motion.
The opening ceremonies were simple.
A miniature tower had been construct
cl in the center of the great floor of the?
pavilion, and in it were three bells.
One had over a century ago tolled the
advance of civilization to the aborig
ines from the walls of the old Mission
Dolores. Another had rung the signals
of danger when lawlessness was rife in
Ban Francisco in the early days of the
city when the Vigilance Committee ad
ministered quick and effective justice.
!The other was a new bell, and on it
President McKinley announced the
closing of the Jubilee and th
of the Fair.
Close to the tower was erected a
small platform nn which as
sembled a few minutes before
tli" hour* for opening tri^ fair the
officers of the Jubilee celebration; the
Mining Fair committee, the Miners'
Association, and J. E. Brown. John W.
P.iqler, Azriah "White and William M.
Johnson, who were with Marshall when
the first nugget of gold was picked ui>
in California.
Immediately after the bell announced
the opening of the fair, the following
dispatches were sent direct to Presi- j
dent McKinley, from the Pavilion to :
the White House in Washington:

message was handed to the Mayor by
the operator:

Jubilee. WILLIAM M'KINLEY.
The invitation and souvenir spoken
of in the dispatch were s^iit to the
Prr-Fident by express about a week ago.
It was a handsome little gold tablet on
which was engraved an invitation to
take part in th" .Jubilee.
Ernest A. Denicke. president of the
board of management of the fair, acted
as the chairman for the occasion. When
the bell had struck the last of the fifty
strokes he recited the origin of the
movement to celebrate the discovery of
gold in California and the efforts to
give a fair illustrative of the mining
industry of the West. Mr. Denicke
th-n, on behalf of the M- ehanics* In
stitute, turned the responsibilities of
thÂ« fair over to the Miners' Associa
tion, of which Jacob N't ff is president.
Mr. Xeff in accepting the trust said:
Mr. Preside m and Members of the Me
chanics" Institute; in accepting on Jtahalf
of the California State Miners' Assotia
t!<>n the trust that you have bo courte
ously ami eloquently ; I, the occa-
Bion dtmands a few words In addition to
th<- formal acceptance of the Golden
Jubilee Mining Fair. It has l>e>-n my
pleasure ami my privilege as executive
the California State Miners'
Association, since its organization six
years ;mo. to note a const gnltion
<m tin- part of the M> Â« hanics' Institute of
S.in Francisco of the Importance of the
mining industry of California, and It has
been a source <pf support and satisfaction
that so old and Influential an Industrial
organisation has been so iâ¢â  â  erful a fan
tor in the rehabilitation of what many of
us deem the most Important Industry of
this . immonwealth. When the
â¢ creating this mi- Ing fair was
originated we miners fi that only
through the active 00-opei tim of the
Mechanics' Institute could It be made an
assured success, and it is with pleasure I
make this public recognition of the fact.
As I stand here to-night, one of the
oldest active miners in the State, the
mists of memory rise, and as the shad
owy procession "of the years goes by I
realize that we are beginning a new era.
The past fifty years have pone into his
tory, with the men who made it. To
their achievements all honor; to their
success be great praise; let their mis
takes be measured by a most merciful
spirit of criticism. It is for us to press
on In the van of scientific mining, with
the latest discoveries, the most Improved
processes, the most Intelligent appli
ances, and keep California, as in the past.
In the lead of all other mining communi
ties and a State to which in generous ri
valry all other sections shall continue to
look for inspiration nnd example.
And now. as president of the California
State Miners' Association, on behalf of
that body I accept the tendered trust
and proclaim the Golden Jubilee Mining
Fair open till March 5. 1898, and. invite
miners everywhere to come and see the
exhibition of how gold mining is done
in California, and how San Francisco can
abundantly outfit the miner, whether he
seek for gold within our own borders or
journey to the Klondike.
" Mayor Pholan then Introduced the
four companions of Marshall, and In
his address said:
The city of San Francisco, as a labor
of love, decided to appropriately cele
brate the fiftieth anniversary of the dis
covery of gold In California. It is a mat
ter â¢ of congratulation that the heroic
menâ the pioneers of Californiaâ who had
the courage and Intelligence to improve
a golden opportunity have been so fit
tingly honored.
The Jubilee may be regarded as being
preliminary to the opening of the Min
ing Fair and leading up to it. Here the
miners have brought from the mountains
outcropping* of the wealth of California
and laid them before the people of the
State. On the seal of the city and county
of San Francisco are the words "Gold
In Peace and Iron In War." Gold signi
fies civilization and luxury. Iron fortitude
and courage. Those words tell the story
of our past. Over a hundred years ago
the old Mission bell, which you see before
you. called the 'Golden Bell." * told the
aborigines in musical language of the ar
rival of christianizing and civilizing in
fiuence and recalls the more than fifty
years of pastoral quiet which preceded
the gold discovery.
The other bell was a clarion call to
arms when the life of the community was
threatened before law had firmly assert
ed her authority daring the turbulent
days of the formation of the common
wealth. The Golden Jubilee bell, new,
bright and beautiful. Is the voice of the
present. Its sound falls upon the ear of
a prosperous and enlightened people, en
joying all the arts of peace in a city
which ranks with the great capitals of
the world.
California has been singularly honored
on this occasion by the President recog
nizing the great work which this State
has done for the Union during its lifty
years of existerce !>y consenting to open
this exposition, which he has done to
night. As late a.s 1546 Daniel Webster
doubted whether this remote country
could over be made a part of the Union
and William H. Beward, in the
Senate, aa late aa IBSO, In demanding the
admission of <alifornia as a State, said
thru her resources wen* such that if de
admlssloa it might he that she
would set up an Independent empire.
On account of her remote position It
might I>^ reasonably urged that there
was nothing in common between the East
and the W,. st . < 'alifornia was admitted
in that m<-moral>:<- year, but it was not

fact. BOCh b.-it.g the difficulties of commu

m..t. borders "f the republic. This gra
.' I of President BfcKlnley tells bet
ter than any language can describe the
progress civilization has made during the
last fifty golden years.
There is no State in the union that has
greater reason to rejoice than California,
and no city acting aa the mouthpiece of
the State and proclaiming its resources
to the world has been allotted a prouder
task.
A letter was read from Governor
Budd announcing his inability to be
nt <in aiTnunt of illness and ask
ins: Mayor Pttelao to represent him on
tl)-- occasion.
An excellent band has been secured
to be in attendance daily at the fair,
and last night the programme was as
follows:
Overture, "Jubilee" (first time)
(I-indpainter); Xylophone solo. James
Reed; Qimnd American Fantasie (new)
tStrauss): cornet solo, W. <5. Rogers;
Hungarian Khapsodie No. ?, (Lisst);
Idyl, "Evening Bells" CKilenbers);

( Rogers).
The pavilion has been handsomely
decorated, and every detail Jn the ar
ranging of exhibits carried out in good
taste. In addition to the elaborate ex
hibits of machinery and practical meth
, ods of mining it is proposed to have a
1 series of lectures <?n various subjects of
: Interest to miners, and there will also
be a daily amusement attraction.
Charles G. Yale. S. B. Christy and A.
| M. Hunt, who were appointed as Judges
to make awards for the best exhibit on
I the opening night, reported that the
first prize should be given to Nevada

! vorably spoken of by the Judges.
THE PRESIDENT PLEASED.
Mrs. MeKinley Honors Califor-
nia With Her Presence at
the Opening Ceremony.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29â At 11:07
o"elock the President touched the but
ton opening the Jubilee Mining Fair.
The answers to his greetings were re
ceived in eight minutes. There were
present the President and Mrs. McKin
ley. Justice and Mrs. MrKenna, Mrs.
and Miss Stanford. Senators White and
Perkins, Representatives Maguire,
Loud. De Vries, Hilborn, Barham,
Barlow. Castle, and Mrs. Castle. Mrs.
De Vries. Mrs. Maguire, Mrs. Hilborn,
Miss Hilborn and Miss Loud.
Senator P3rkins called upon Senator
\Vhjte. as the senior Senator, to thank
the President for his kindness and
courtesy. Senator White, addressing
the President, thanked him on behalf
of the people of the State of California.
The President responded briefly, saying
that he enjoyed the decasion as thor
oughly as any other party present, and
\\:is pleased to have had the privilege
of sharing in the Golden Jubilee cele
bration.
In speaking of the occasion Judge
Maguire said: "The ceremony in* the
White House to-night was in many re
spects the most Impressive and inter
esting I have ever witnessed. Standing
| here with a group of enthusiastic Cali
fornians, surrounding the President of
the United States, while in an instant
of time actually rang the Jubilee bell in
the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Fran
cisco, 3200 miles away, impressed me
more than ever before with the truth
that intellect has conquered time and
space and that the chief magistrate of
this great nation is indeed in close
touch with the remotest sections of our
country.
"I venture to say that the audience
assembled in Pan Francisco which
, heard the bell answer to the touch of
the button here and which applauded
the President's beautifully framed and
sincere greeting was not more enthusi
astic than the California audience
which applauded the responses here.
We all feel that we have actually par
ticipated in the opening of the Jubi
lee fair, and we feel pleased to have
had the privilege of so doing. To the
President himself the occasion was
more than perfunctory. It was mani
fest that he was deeply and sincerely
interested, and really* enjoyed his share
I in the occasion.
"The unexpected presence of Mrs.
McKlnley gave an additional interest.
We regarded her presence as a very
; high compliment, since being a con
firmed Invalid, she rarely ever taxes
h-'!- strength to attend such functions.
j On the whole, the affair was very pleas
ant and highly gratifying to the just
and reasonable pride of Californians in
I the affair and the fame of the State."
CHILDREN AT DRILL.
The Young Folks Join in the
Jubilee Celebration.
Fifteen thousand children made
merry at Golden Gate Park yesterday.
It was children's day of the jubilee
week's festivities, and the young men
and the young ladies of the rising
generation â the children in frocks and
the tots just beginning to walk, as
well as scores in carriages exclusively
their own â joined in the celebration.
Children were at the park as soon as
the sun began to shine, and by 10 o'clock
the children's playground was crowded.
The merry-go-round did not stop from
the arrival of the first boy until dark
ness set in. except to change the loads
on the rocking wooden horses. The
donkeys and the goats were kept mov
ing In double-quick time all day, and
there was not a child in the park who
did not have a ride.
Captain Thomson and his squad of
park police and Sergeant Tobin and
twenty of the city policemen were on
hand early In the day to keep some
semblance of order among the boys
and girls; but the officers did not for
get that they were children themselves,
and the biggest buys in the park dur
ing the day were Captain Thomson
and Sergeant Tobin. The children just
mauled the policemen, and the police
men liked it. They laughed with the
little folks, and everybody had a good
time.
A lunch and candy and popcorn were
given to all the litle visitors. There
was a crush at the doors of the lunch
rooms all the afternoon, but no one
went hungry. It was a great effort for
G. H. Murphy, the superintendent of
the children's playground, to give
benches to so many.
The Calaveras band, with its mem
bers in the garb of the present-day
mlner. furnished plenty of music for
the occasion.
The competitive drill of classes from
the public schools was the attraction
of the day. A handsome silk banner,
given by the Jubilee committee, was the
trophy. Drilled classes from six schools
competed for the prize. The Mission
â¢Grammar School had a class of boys
and a class of girls that were anxious
to compete. The girls' class numbered
only thirty-eight, rank and file, and it
seems it warn the rule that there should
be a full company of fifty-six. George
Mehling, who had charge of the affair,
refused to allow the class to compete.
The girls of the class remonstrated
but Mehling was obdurate and replied:
"What do you want to compete for?
You won't get a prize, anyway."
The class of boys of the same school
had the requisite number in its ranks
and it was considered one of the best
drilled of the school companies Jn the
city. Its members refused to march
on the parade ground unless the girls'
class was allowed to Compete. The re
sult was that the drill was carrier! on
without a representation from the Mis
sion School.

verslty was the Judge of the contest.
The points he considered in reaching a
decision were: Timely arrival on the
grounds; the personal appearance of
the boys and girls of the companies;
attention in the ranks; ability of offi
cers; alignment, wheeling and march
ing in fours and in platoons.
The six companies that competed
were from the Horace Mann, Pacific
Heights, Hamilton. James Lick, Ever
ett and Crocker. The girls' drill corps
of the Horace Mann School was de
clared the most proficient, and it car
ried off the banner. The girls wore
neat-fitting blue uniforms, with yellow
trimmings and white leggins. The
corps was captained by Georgia Barnes,
with Ethel Simpson and Lena Williams
as lieutenants.
The boys' drill corps of the Pacific
Heights School was given the second
prize. Sheldon Parker was its captain,
and his lieutenants were Stanley Prior
and Frank Peters.
The third prize was awarded to the
girls' corps of the James Lick School.
The girls wore unifc-rms of white, with
red sashes. Their captain was Pearl
Bryan.
The boys' class of the Hamilton
Grammar School was captained by Al
bert Mohun, with Curtis Lindsley and
Charles Eager for lieutenants. Annie
Murray was the captain of the girls'
class from the same school, and her
lieutenants were Ida Finlay and Hilda
Katy.
Frank McGovern was the captain of
the corps of the Everett Grammar
School. The lieutenants were James
Campbell and Clarence Jeffreys.
The two classes of the Mission Gram
mar School and the drill corps of the
St. Charles School gave exhibition
drills and they were almost as much
applauded as the winners of the
prizes.
FLOWER SHOW CROWDED.
Thousands of Visitors View-
California's Pretty
Blossoms.
It was estimated at the lowest fig
ures that at least 50.000 people visited
the floral market during the three days
that it was opened to the public. Of
this number 30,000 visited Union Square
yesterday. From the time the market
opened In the afternoon until it closed
at 10 o'clock last night, it required the
efforts of a dozen policemen to handle
the crowd.
Early in the day it was found neces
sary to form in line those who wanted
to pass through the large tent. This
line stretched almost half way across
the square.
The music last evening was furnished
by the band of the Holy Cross. They
did not play In the band stand, but took
a position directly in front of the mar
ket tent. They were much praised for
their music.
The Wild West Show.
The Wild West Show repeated its pro
gramme at Central Park yesterday, ami
will do so again this afternoon. The
lassoing of the steers was not interfered
with by the Society for the Prevention
-of Cruelty to Animals. The only thing
that was not down upon the pro
gramme was the falling of one of the
horses in the coach holdup act. Xo
one, however, was hurt by the acci
dent. When it came to the lassoing of
the steers one of the animals made a
sudden break and came near getting
mixed up with a cowboy. There will be
some rough riding to-day for a wager.
George Sweitzer has bet J'Â«e Watkins
550 that none of the cowV-.v* ran ride
his horse, Jack the Ripper. Watking
says that he is willing to lose if he
cannot produce a cowboy from one of
those now in the show who can stick
on the back of the horse.
The Mechanics' Pavilion was lierhted
throughout \\'ith "Welsbach Incandes

WILL OFFER UP
PRAYERS FOR RAIN
The Archbishop Will Have
Mass Said in the Catholic
Churches.
Weather Prophet Hammon Explains
the Cause of the Continued
Drought.
Tnless the weather takes a decided
change and rain sets in before the end of
two weeks the entire wheat crop of the
State will be ruined, at a loss to the
farmers uf between $10,000,000 and $17,000,
000. There is at present sufficient moist
ure in the ground to keep the crops alive
for the coming fourteen or fifteen days,
but unless they receive more before the
expiration of this time utter and absolute
ruin may be expected.
Dp to the present time there has been j
but 5 Inches of rain, representing not
quite 25 per cent of the ordinary and usu
al amount necessary for the production
of a successful crop.
The Carmen are anxious and are pray
ing that a sudden change in the weather
will come soon, but owing to the contin
ued drought a pail seenu to be thrown
over their hopes of obtaining anything
like a fair success with their wheat
crops this season, or that their prayers
will be answered by a divine providence.
*x. Mr - Harnmon of the United States Wea
ther Bureau says that the chances for
Immediate rain are slight and that he
â ks entirely given up hope of a rainfall
l?J the Immediate future, as indications
point to a continuation of the present
dry condition of the atmoephere.
Owing to the favorable conditions of
atmospheric pressure last Friday morn-
Ing he predicted that there would be im
mediate rain, but claims that he had no
sooner telegraphed the report to the dif
ferent stations on the coast and had no
tified the farmers in the interior of the
State than the barometer took a sudden
rise and ho was compelled to raise the
flag as an Indication of the return of the
undepired fair weather. He says that
there is not a weather chart in existence
rtrat records such a drought as Is now
being experienced in this State.
Mr. Hammon gives the real cause of the
continued holding off of the rain, and
the present dry condition of the atmos
phere, as the result of a bank of dry
air which is now hanging over the in
terior States, rendering it impossible for
a storm to penetrate Its way to the Paci
fic 81ope.
"There is a mass cf dry air of
exceeding high temperaturo," said the
prophet, "hanging over Utah. Nevada and
Southern IJaho. This air has been lo
cated in this same position constantly for
the past two months, preventing any
storm conditions fiom appearing on thlp
coast from the westward. Instead they
have been forced either to the north or
south of this region, thereby preventing
rain in Northern California.
"On Thursday last a moderate storm
appeared In Southern California, which
tended to dissipate this area of high pres
sure, or at least the southern portion of
It. Moderate storm conditions also ap
peared off the Oregon coast, and at the
time showed signs of penetrating its way
through the south side of the area to the
northern part of the State. It never
reached here, however, but pasped In a
northerly line over British Columbia."
Owing to the prolonged dry weather
and the consequent Injury to the various
interests of the State, His Orace, Arch
bishop Rlordan, has addressed the fol
lowing circular to all the pastors of Cath
olic churches throughout this archdiocese;
Rev. Dear Sir: I request you to an
nounce to your people on Sunday next
(that is to-day) that a high mass will
be celebrated in all the churches of the
archdiocese on Monday next, at an hour
convenient to you and your congregation
with the Intention "Ad pluviam peten
dum." You will exhort yoiir people to
be present at this service. Yours truly

ALL HIS COIN
Unpleasant Experience of
Donald McLeod, a
Miner.
He Came From Western Aus
tralia to Go to the
Klondike.
ThÂ« Robber, â¢ Who Was Arrested.
Even Relieved Him of His
Ticket to Alaska.
Donald McLeod, a miner on his way
to the Klondike, appeared as complain
ing witness in a case in Judge Joach
imsen's court yesterday and told a
story chowing how easily a stranger
can become the dupe of men who make
it a business to fleece the unwary-
McLeod arrived from Western Aus
tralia, where he had been mining, by
the steamer Alameda about ten days
ago. He had heard of the fortunes
being made at the Klondike, and he
determined to try his luck there. Soon
after his arrival he purchased a ticket
for the gold fields and was to leave by
the steamer Walla. Walla last Thurs
day. S'. : V
Tuesday night he was drinking on
the water front and made the acquain
tance of Patrick O'Donnell, who gives
his occupation as a sailor. They struck
up a friendship and O'Donnell sue
gested to McLeod that he would like
to show him the sights of the city.
They visited several of the dives on
the Barbary Coast and McLeod ad
mitted that- he swallowed more liquor
than was good for him. About 1 o'clock
next morning O'Donnell got him to a
dark spot on Spear street, near Harri
son, and robbed him of everything he
had in his pockets. He had thirty
eight English sovereigns, about $70 in
American money, two gold rings and
his ticket to Alaska, One of the
rings had his Initials engraved on it.
McLeod was too intoxicated to offer
any resistance, but after O'Donnell
left him he had sense enough to no
tify the first policeman he met that
he had been robbed, and was able to
give a good description of O'Donnell.
Policemen Bean. Castln and Clifford
started in search of O'Donnell and
were not long in finding him and plac
ing him under arrest. John Hessing.
a sailor, was with, O'Donnell at the
time, and he was also arrested. A
charge of grand larceny was booked
against them.
When O'Donnell was searched the
English sovereigns, about $40 in coin
and one of the gold rings bearing M -
Leod's initials were found in his
pockets. He claimed that he had re
cently arrived from England and that
was why he had the sovereigns, but
he could not explain why he became
possessed of McLeod's ring. McLeod
swore that O'Donnell was the man who
robbed him and the Judge held him to
answer before the Superior Court in
52000 bonds. As there was no evidence
to connect' Heasii with the case he
was pet at liberty.
McLeod's ticket uld not be found
and the police notified the steamship
company to cancel â¢ and arrest the
man who presented it
MRS. GILMORE
TO BE REMOVED
Action Taken by a Committee
of the Board of Su
pervisors.
Mrs. Walsh Will Be the New Matron
of the Receiving Hos
pital.
The Finance Commute r.f the Board
cf Supervisors has comludod that it is
necessary to make a change In the posi
tion of matron of the Receiving Hospital,
and will offer a resolution to the board
on Monday next that Mrs. Gilinore, now
in charge of the institution, be r.-moved.
and that Mrs. "Walsh he given her place.
The chanpe is based on charts made
by Frank Kane, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Vice, and a number
of girls, who claim to have been unjustly
treated while under Mrs. Gilmore's
c-harpe. The report of tho committee,
which contains no reference to the accu
sations against Mrs. Gllmore, is as fol
lows:
â¢ Tour committee has Investigated the com
plaints made as to the duties and the obliga
tions resting upon and devolving upon the ma
tron of the City Prison, and desire to state
that this Is a peculiar and arduous position,
requiring matronly rare and sympathy with
the unfortunate girls â who arc arrested and con
fined in the City Prison, and while some are
thoroughly degraded, others are simply un
fortunate, and therefore great discrimination
should be exercised in the treatment of such
persons.
The present Incumbent has been In the posi
tion many years, and it is human that, amid
the varied and annoying scenes caused by the
profligate, unless the matron has com
mand and perfect self control, her surround
ings should have had an effect to Interfere
somewhat with her usefulness.
Your committee, .while appreciating the
â ' many arduous duties imposed upon th* ma
; tron/ are of the opinion that the position now
' filled by Mrs. Ollmore should be declared va
i cant on and after February Ist. and that Mrs.
Walsh should be appointed matron to fill the
vacancy.
Supervisor Rottanzi will present the
resolution at the next meeting, and it is
understood that it will be supported by a
majority of the members.

NEW TO-DAY.
TO CURE NERVOuTIIYSPErm
To Gain Flesh, to Sleep Well, to Know
What Appetite and Good Digestion
Mean, Make a Test of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Interesting Experience of an Indianapolis
Gentleman*
No trouble is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People having it think that their nerves
are to blame and are surprise! that
they are not cured by nerve medicine
and spring remedies; the real seat of
the mischief is lost sight of; the stom-
ach is the organ to be looked after.
â¢ Nervous dyspeptics often do not have
any pain wl .tever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the usual symptoms of
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspep-
sia shows itself not in the stomach so
much as in nearly every other organ;
in some cases the heart palpitates and
is irregular; in others the kidneys are
affected; in others the bowels are con-
stipated, with headaches; still others
are troubled with loss of flesh and ap-
petite, with accumulation of gas, sour
risings and. heartburn.
Mr. A. W. Sharper of No. 61 Prospect
street, Indianapolis, Ind... writes as fol-
lows: "A motive of pure gratitude
prompts me to write these few lines
regarding the new and valuable medi-
cine. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I
have been a sufferer from nervous dys-
pepsia for the last four years; have
used various patent medicines and oth-
er remedies without any favorable re-
sult. They sometimes gave temporary
relief until the effects of the medicine
wore off. I attributed this to my sed-
entary habits, .being a bookkeeper with '
little physical exercise, but I am glad
to state that the tablets have over-
come all these obstacles, for I have
gained in flesh, sleep better and am
better in every way. The above is writ-
ten not for notoriety, but is based on
actual fact. Respectfully yours, ;>~-Â« : :
"A. W. SHARPER,
"61 Prospect street, Indianapolis. Ind."
It is safe to say that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets will cure any stomach
' weakness or disease except cancer of
stomach. They cure sour stomach, gas,
loss of flesh and appetite, sleeplessness,
palpitation, heartburn, constipation
and headache. *

NEWMAN'S LIFE
Deserted a Young Wife
Two Score Years
Ago.
Now She Is Here and Claims
the Estate of the Dead
Man.
It Is the Belief That the Mystery of
the Trestle Will Never Bo
Solved.
. Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, January 29.
When George Newman died he left an .
estate valued at about $20,000, and he
also left behind him a romance which
Is gradually being unfolded before the 1
Superior Court at Martinez. Newman
for many years prior to his death was
a resident of Antioch, and was well
known in both Alameda and Contra
Costa counties.
He engaged in several trades during
his life, and accumulated his snug es
tate by thrift. He spoke very little of '
himself or his past, but occasionally
enjoyed a hilarious time, and while on
one of these sprees he met death in a
mysterious manner. By the river bank
at the edge of tidewater his corpse was
found. The body was under the rail
road trestle, and whether he tumbled
from the track or whether he was mur
dered and robbed may never be known,
but there is much to support the latter
theory. â¢..
At the time of his death Newman's
keys were found on the railroad track,
his pockets were rifled, but his watch
was not touched. One man was sus
pected of knowing how Newman might
have died, and he has since been found
and placed in the lunatic asylum.
In addition to the tragedy and mys
tery of Newman's death, now comes a
romance in his early life. It was al
ways supposed that he had a wife liv
ing in Rhode Island, and when the Pub
lic Administrator took charge of his es
tate he found some letters from his
wife, and she was sent for. A few days
ago she arrived at Martinez, and at
once claimed the right to administer
the estate as the widow of the de
ceased. Her story is that Newman
married her over forty years ago when
she was but 16 years of age, and that
three weeks after their marriage he de
serted her and came to California. They
kept up a casual correspondence until
four years ago, and since that time
only a few letters have passed between
them.
In all these forty years Newman sent
her but trifling sums of money for her
support, continually claiming poverty,
notwithstanding he was in very com
fortable- circumstances. Her last let
ters were pitiful, pleading advancing
age and feebleness, and are said to
have met with no" response.
The contestants claim that the wom
an* not Newman's wife at all. A
cousin of the deceased, who- is a resi
dent of Stockton, is one of the contest
ants, and declares that Newman's wife
died four years ago, and that he can
not have a widow now living. The
matter is in the Superior Court of Con
tra Costa County, where the conflict
ing testimony will be straightened out.
The man who was last seen with
Newman on the night before his death
is named Griffiths, and has relatives in
this city. After Newman was found
dead Griffiths disappeared, and turned
up in Fresno, where he has a wealthy
brother in the real estate business. He
attempted to kill his brother with a
knife, and was arrested. While under
arrest he was brought from Fresno to
Antioch to testify at the inquest on
Newman. The Ccroner would prob
ably have taken some action had it not
been proved that Newman was a peri
odical lunatic, and had frequently been
in asylums. He was sent back to Ag
news, was discharged about two weeks
ago as cured, and yesterday was rear
rested at San Jose in a demented state
of mind, walking around in the cold
barefooted and with only half his
clothes on.
POISONED
BY CANDY
Mrs. J. K. Porter in a Critical
Condition From Eating
Gumdrops.
She Was Hurriedly Taken to the Re-
Csivincr Hospital for
Treatment
Mrs. J. K. Porter, who resides at
1930 Ellis street, was presumably acci
dentally poisoned in the Grand Opera
house last evening while witnessing the
play in company with her daughter.
After the first act Mrs. Porter bought
a small package of gum drops, and
after eating one or two of them .she
was taken with severe pains in the
stomach. She told her daughter of
the agony she was undergoing and the
daughter notified the management of
the affair.
The ambulance was hurriedly sum
moned and the suffering woman was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
ii v. as discovered that she had been
poisoned and was in a critical condi
tion. It is the opinion of Miss Porter
that the prumdrnps were the cause of
the trouble. After <. a ting the gumdrops
Mrs. Porter endured the pain for a
time, but later on it became so intense
that she nearly fainted. When the
ambulance arrived at the hospital the
victim of the poisoned candies was in
an exceedingly weak condition and had
to be supported while eroins into the
ward for treatment. The doctors ex
pressed the opinion that the candles
sold by the messenger boys in the thea
ter had been the source of pain, as
they were without doubt poisoned.
A NOTED CONSPIRATOR.
An firrest in China Recalls an
Incident in Sar> Francisco.
Recent news from Hongkong says that
the notorious Dr. Sun Y.it Sun, the arch
conspirator against the Chinese Govern
ment, has been arrested by the Hong
kong authorities and handed over, to the
Chinese Government. About eighteen
months ago this noted . revolutionist fled
to San Francisco and was for several
months domiciled in Chinatown, where
he succeeded in " organizing a society
called the Hing Chung Oey, or "Reform
China Association." Its professed object
was to bring about reforms in the" Gov
ernment of China by peaceful methods
if possible, but if necessary by force. ; .
Dr. J. F. Masters of the M. E. Chinese
Mission says that one morning he .found
In the mission a very modest looking,
well educated, well dressed European-.
tzed young man â¢ who was introduced to
him as the. Chinese -physician, Dr. Sun. 1
He made many friends by his pleasant,
gentlemanly, well bred manners, and he
was invited to come again. .Sun went in i
and out among the mission people for a
couple of months. - One day Dr. Masters
met the Chinese Consul,' who expressed
his surprise and regret that the mission
wns harboring one of the greatest â¢ Chi
nese rebels of modern times and that he
had already succeeded in winning to his
cause numbers of the Christian young
men of Chinatown. Dr. Masters hurried
to .the . mission and found that Dr. Sun
had left a few â¢ hours before,- and had
boarded the eastbound express. The plot
had been exposed and Dr. Sun remem
bered he had business' elsewhere.
Dr.. Sun visited Eastern cities and nt
every place he followed the same tac
tics. He went quietly about among his
fellow countrymen and organized local
chapters of the Hing Chung Oey. When
the Chinese officials got on his track he
suddenly disappeared. At last he turned
up in London a year ago last October,
and the world was startled by the news
that he had been kidnaped by the Chinese
Legation in London and that Sir Halll
day Macartney was arranging for his
passage to . China as a prisoner of the
Chinese Government. -V- ?

BOY BURGLARS

Policemen and Caught.
They Are Supposed to Eelong to a
Gang Thpt Has Been Robbing
Telephone Boxes in Stores.
The butcher shop of M. R. O*oske. 905
Folsom street, was entered by William
Hennessey and Lawrence Estes. two boys
17 years of age. at an early hour yester
day morning. They tore the telephone
Vox from the wall and carried it away
with them to. steal the nickels in the re
ceiver.
They were observed by Policeman Ifen
ihan. and he blew his whistle and started
on the run after them. At Sixth street
they dropped the box and continued their
night south on Sixth street. Ifenihan
was Joined by Policemen McEntee and
O'Connor, and McEntee tired a shot in
the air from his revolver to Intimidate
the two youths, but it had the effect of
Increasing their speed. The chase was
kept un until Columbia square was
reached', and there the fugitives were run
to earth. They were taken to the City
Prison and charged with burglary.
They were arraigned in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday and the hearing was con
tinued until Tuesday. A representative.
of the telephone company was in court
and stated thai within the past three or
four months about M 0 telephone boxes
had been stolen In different parts of the
city and destroyed to get at the nickels
in "the receivers, and he believed the
company had lost about $l"00 in this way.
The police say that Hennessey and Es
tes are members of a gang that has been
making it a practice to break into stores
and steal the telephone boxes and any
thing else they could lay their hands
upon, and they consider the capture an
important one. Hennessey is a had boy.
He has served a term for petty larceny
and has been arrested for vagrancy.
LABOR MAKES PROTEST.
Objections to Charter Amerjdroeot
Call Fort!} a Vigorous Response
of tbe Executive Board.
The following extracts are from a man
ifesto fssued by the executive board ot
the San Francisco I>abor Convention, of
which E. W. Thurman is president,
George Lafayette vice president, K. J.
Corbett secretary, T. J. Browning treas
urer and J. K. Phillips financial secre
tary:
"There seems to be a strong effort to
deceive the people of San Francisco, as
It s.-f-ms to us and especially the laboring
class, who demand recognition of their
rights in the new charter, to put them
off with the pretense that the charter
can be easily amended. This is not so.
The pretense that a clause can be in
serted by which upon petition of 15 p< r
cent of the voters an amendment can be
submitted is absolutely not so.
'â¢The constitution, which is the supreme
law. provides for the making of the
charier and also provides the only meth
od by which it can be amÂ»ended after it is
so made."
The objection generally is against the
stand taken by the Examiner, the board
asserting that the moneyed classes are
always opposed to the intf-rosts of labor
and that "no one can say that a require
ment for a three-fifths vote is an easy
amendment. It la just the contrary, and
labor will not be hoodwinked in this
way."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, STJXBAT, JANUARY 30, 1898.
THE ORDEAL
IS AVERTED
Oakland Society May Be
Spared Much Anx
iety.
May Never Have to Receive
Mr. and Mrs. Swiftwater
Bill.
" A Splendid Fellow," Says Hie. Broker,
"and a Welcome Addition
to Oakland."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Jan. 29.
Oakland society is relieved. Since It
first became known that W. C Gates,
also known as Swiftwater Bill, had
purchased the Henshaw residence in
the heart of the local aristocracy, and
had paid a goodly figure for it, there
has been much speculation as to how
Mr. and Mrs. Gates and their $1,800,000
which he says he owns should be re
ceived.
It was not so difficult for Oakland so
ciety to outline a reception for $1,800.
000, but there are certain lines drawn
on this side of the bay by society which
would make it difficult to determine
the status of the millionaire from Daw
son City.
It was known that Mr. Gates was
ambitious, and gossips had circulated
the story that the purchase of the
mansion carried with it an unwritten
but implied understanding that the
Gateses should be admitted into the
(harmed circle of other residents of
Oakland who owned $25,000 mansions.
This was horrible, and now the little
domestic infelicity Which has broken
out between Mr. Gates and his bride
has somewhat relieved the embarrass
ing situation.
Oakland society has not said much:
as a rule it docs not talk, but it thinks
and acts and its actions are of that
nature that speaks louder than words.
The question of the admission of Mr.
Bwiftwater Bill and hi.s wife into so
ciety was considerably complicated by
the fact that he owned so much money.
There is a lot of society on this side of
the bay, but there is not any too much
money, and $1,800,000 is quite a sum.
With the purchase of the residence
and the prompt manner in which it was
paid fcr there were many who felt in
clined to receive Mr. Gates with open
arms, for although his pedigree did
not precede him and his coat of arms
has not yet been registered, a gnat
deal of respect was felt for a man who
would pay (25.0 Mm cash for a house
and show proof that he still had $1,775,
000 left.
It now appears, however, from the
stories of both Mr. and Mis. dates,
that their married life ig. nearly at an
end. for she says that there are other
things than money necessary to happi
ness, and hÂ« says that as he has all the
money he is not going to "chase her."
quently local society feels con
siderably relieved.
William Laymanoe of the company
which induced Mr. Gates to invest in
Oakland says that he never heard of
any social inducements being held out
to Mr. Gates When the transaction was
closed.
"Mr. Gates Ip a very shrewd eentle
man," said Mr. Laymnnoe. "and is
making some particularly good ir
ments. He is the kind of man we want
in < â¢akland, and he will be a desirable
acquisition to any branch of society.
He intends to reside in his fine house.
and will no doubt make other invest
ments on this side of the bay. Person
ally Mr. < 'tales is very affable and a
perfect gentleman, and we hope his
little difficulties will soon be settled."
STILL UNDER
DARK CLOUDS
L. M. Henry's Name Connected
With Rumors of
Theft.
His Disappearance Cannot Be Ac
counted For und a Search
Is Going On.
The disappearance of 1... M. H* nry. the
collector for the Spring Valley Water
Company, bocomes more mysterious n.
thc days go by. No member of his fam
ily Is aware of his whereabouts, but each
Is of the opinion that all will be well in
a few days. Just what he is up to, or
where he has been for the paÂ«t week is
as much a mystery to them as to the de
tectives and the members of the com
pany. Lorenzo Henry, a brother of the
mltisinK man. stated last evening that his
brother had given io Intimation of his
going, but he thoroughly believes that
not ever, a ]<i-o<>nt piece will be missed
when the books and accounts are linally
checked up.
It waa rumored that Henry had left the
city, but no proof has as yet been found.
The fact that he was a frequenter of the
race course does not seem to have any
effect on the case, aa it has been already
stated by members of the company that
tt would have been impossible for Henry
to be in the company's debt for more
than two days' collections, but aa a mat
ter "f precaution they will check up ac
counts for the past two or three years.
The Pacific Surety Company, which is
on the bond of the collector, is not
alarmed at his absence, nor has it been
asked to make pood the agreement of the
bond. It will not be known for a day
or two what will be developed by the
cheeking of the accounts which were
controlled by Henry. The most myaterl
ous portion of the affair seems to the.
public to be the secrecy maintained by
the company which has lost its collector.
Chief Clerk Booker is the only employe
who has the slightest idea of the stand
ing of affairs, and he has been sworn to
secrecy. A diligent search is still going
on for the missing man, and the rumor
which had gaineu ground that he had
made away with himself while despond
ent from drinking is ridiculed by both
friends and family.
After the accounts have be^n thorough
ly investigated if a shortage is discovered
the Pacific Surety Company will be held
to tho agreements of the bond, which
was given for OMB.
DEATH OF MRS. DOANE.
T^c Deceased Well Known as a
Pioneer Resident and for
Her Kindly flcts.
Mrs. I,ncy J. Doane, widow of the late
General Charles Doane. died at the fam
ily residence on Friday evening, after an
illness of several months. Mrs. Doane
was among the early pioneers and was
actively interested in all movements for
the welfare of the city and a supporter
of her husband In the trying times of
'56, when as Sheriff of the city he was
called upon to perform some of the most
important and trying duties that often
fall to the lot of a public officer.
Mrs. Doane's death recalls with much
vividness the trying times through which
the city then passed, and those who were
here then can well recall the tciportant
duties which fell upon the Sheriff.
General Dnanc was noted for his cool
ness, clearness and decision of character.
It is paid that to his efficient administra
tive abilities Sun Francisco was indebted
that anarchy was not permitted to run
Coming to the city from New Orleans,
he was supposed to be a Southerner, and
was approached by those of Southern
sympathies, with a view of securing him
us a leader of their cause. His loyalty
to tlie country probably served in a great
degree to hold the p cession interest in
check and to help save California to the
Union.
General Doane served the city four
years as Sheriff, was an active leader and
promoter of the State Militia in its in
fancy and was Brigadier-General of the
Second Brigade at the time of his death
in 18*52.
Mrs. Doane was Wfll known for her
many kindly nets and her deep interest
In the public welfare.
The funeral will take place from her
lnte residence, corner Hawthorne and
Harrison streets, on Tuesday next.
The Order of Golden LtnKs.
Mrs. John Pettee of this city, a lady
whose works of charity are well known,
is getting up a benefit for the Order of
Golden Links, to come off at Foresters'
Hall on the eve of Washington's birth
day, February 21. at 8 o'clock. * The Order
of Golden Links is a society composed of
hoys from 12 years of ago upward, one of
the main objects of which is to procure
situations for and help young men and
boys along in life. Some of the best tal
ent have offered their services and the
affair pr-mises to be a great success.
Choral Evensong.
The Vesper service this evening at St.
Paul's Episcopal Church, on California
street, near Steiner, will be a choral
evensong, the entire service being ren
dered by s vested choir of fifty men, wo
men and boys. The rendering of the

An Intore'tiniT Jubilee Letter From
the Daughter of an Eminent
First Settler.
During the Jubilee week many letters
and messages wire received from loyal
Callfornlans who could not arrange their
affairs so they could visit the State. An
interesting letter was received by Colonel
\V. H Bnaedberg from May Fourgeaud
Haskell, Wife of Captain Haskell, IT.l T . S.
A., and daughter of Dr. Victor J. Four-
I, an eminent physician of the early
times in San Francisco and a well-known
pioneer of CmiMomUL in writing from
Fort Ntobrara, Nebr., she says: "Cap
tain Hask-ll nr.'l 1 have been reading
lately with mv. h interest of the prepara
tions for the Golden Jubilee in San Fran

the attention I v. tuld like."
Mrs. Haskcll loses a copy of the
resolutions in memory of her father,
which were adopted by the California
Pioneers in January, 1575. The memorial
tribute Is signed by Arthur B. Stout,
Alexander Campbell ana Emll V. Sutter.
The fact is mentloj 1 that in the organ
ization of the Society of California Pio
neers the name of Fourgeaud stands
sixth on Its record. October 14, 1847, Just
six months after he had left his first
camping ground near Independence, Mo..
Dr. Fourgeaud landed at the foot of Clay
street a few yards below Montgomery
street. â¢ â 'â 
The resolutions adopted by the Pioneers
embrace this Interesting paragraph:
"In the latter part of March. 1848. Dr.
Fourgeaud received from General Butter
a small specimen of what was supposed
to be gold with the requesi that he should
list it. He pronoun -ed It pure metal.
This was the first gold ever scientifically
in California. They endeavored to
keep this discovery a profound secret.
but in a short time it was rumored in San
Francisco that large amounts of gold
ha<i been found in the neighborhood of
Butter's mill. These report* received little
nee until the first sacks of the pre
cious metal were brought down to pur
chase merchandise with. Two weeks af
ter this San Francisco was almost de
serted. Men. women and children rushed
to the '[placers." "
In th-- <'alifornla Star of April 1 1843
Dr. Fourgeaud published an extended ar
ticle on the "Prospects of California."
His vision of the future was almost
prophetic.
The dream of Nina, published In the
Californlan of De -ember s, 1547, was a
Vision which came to the wife of Dr
Fourgeaud. It was a drvam picture of
Pan Francisco in 1Â»7 , as a great metropo
lisâa city of lofty buildings, beautiful
streets and magnificent residences.

With Only One
Pastor.
A Committee Now Seeking a
Site on Which to
Build.
Rev. Davis' Resignation MÂ«y Lead to
the Formation of One
Body.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 29.
Another effort is to be made to unite
I the two ChriÃtlan churches in this city.
| The resignation of Rev. Edwards Davis
I has left matters in such a condition
| that a consolidation is said to be not
only possible but desirable. There has
i been no pastor secured to preach t<>
! morrow at the Central church, and the
Rev. Mr. Davis' announcement last
Sunday night that Dr. C. EL Garrison
would occupy the pulpit has caused a
little feeling between the Central and
First churches. Dr. Garrison has no
idea of preaching in the Central church
to-morrow night, having been pre
viously invited to preach at the First
Christian Church, and he is at a ln?s
to understand why Mr. Davis should
have announced him at the Central
church.
lSlder Kennedy of the First Chris
tian Church said to-day that a large
majority of both churches would like
to see a consolidation, which would
mean one strong church instead of two
struggling ones.
"We have a few thousand dollars in
our building fund," said Mr. Ken
nedy, "and a committee is now looking
for a site on which to build. A few
months ago the two churches were
nearly united, but the plan was
blocked by the efforts of a few friends
of Mr. Davis. A majority of the First
Church and a great portion of the
Central were in favor of a union, and
since Dr. Butler has come to the First
congregation this feeling has strength
ened. So far as I can see, the only ob
jection to the union would be that the
Central Church should pay off its debts
of about $.rioo. r ioo before we join hands, as
it would not be fair to saddle that obli
gation upon our members. The Cen
tral Church claims 300 members; we
have 250, and, consequently, with a
new building and by encouraging the
spirit which seems to have come with
Dr. Butler, we could soon have a first
class, strong church, out of debt and
doing a grind work."
Dr. Garrison is said to be one of the
few men who ever made any money
out of a rolisnous publication. He did
this in the East, anil now lie has pur
chased th.' Pacific <'hristian, the organ
of the Christian church on this coast,
and will at once assume its editorship.

Farm Laborer's Desperate
Struggle With a Murder
ous Robber.
Though Badly WoundÂ«d Ha >..Â»v.?s
Himself From Being Hurled
From a Train.
Fperi.it TUsratch to The Call.
KKKSNO, Jan. 29.â William Helman, a
farm laborer, was brought to the County
Hospital here this afternoon in a badly
battered condition. Hfl was suffering
from a crippled shoulder, two long scalp
wounds, a gashed wrist and numerous
bruises and contusions, the result of a
fierce fight which he had with an un
known man for whom he had. acted in
the role of a benefactor. The scene of
the encounter was the top of the blind
baggage car of the southbound train, on
which the two nun had started to ride
to Bakersfield.
Helman made the acquaintance of the
stranger in this city and paid for his
lodging and meals and also bought him a
supply of cigarettes. On Thursday even
ing th-- two left for Bakerstield on the
blind baggape. When about half a mile
south of Tipton the stranjeer struck his
benefactor on the head with a coupling
link, and then struck him three or four
more blows, knocking him senseless.
Then he robbed him. taking all the
money he hadâ about Â£>.
When Helman recovered consciousness
the robber tried to knock him off the car,
and tht- two ram then engaged in a des
perate hard to hand fight. Finally the
stranger drew a razor, and Helman
climbed down on to the tender of the en
gine. When the fireman had been told
what the matter was he started after
the robber with a coal hammer, but the
fellow Jumped from the car and made
his escape.
The facts of the robbery were reported
to the officers at Uakersfleld and a de
scription was given of the ruffian. He is
described as being about 5 feet 2 inches
in height and wore a black mustache.
He had two sweaters under a dark coat.
He also wore a brownish Fedora hat.
Helman Is badly injured, and it was
feared he had suffered from concussion
of the brain. He is a well-spoken young
fellow, who had worked for about a year as
a farm hand near Hornltos, Mariposa
County.

MERTENS DISCHARGED.
His Violation of Law Only Tecb-
nical and He Had Received
Great Provocation.
United States Dlstrlot Judge Do Haven
yesterday, dismissed the charge against
A. F. Mortens on motion of United States
Attorney Foote. The motion was as fol
lows:
"I hereby enter a nolle pros In the
above entitled case on the ground that
the offense Involved herein consists
In sending through the postoffloe estab
lishment a threatening postal card. The
offense is merely of a technical character,
and in the opinion of the postal authori
ties the evidence Is noj. sufficient to au
thorize a conviction."
Mertens Is a respectable merchant, deal*
ing In spices, coffees, etc., on Dnimm
street. About a year or bo ago, Mrs. D.
Keller, doing business in Bakersrteld, ob
tained some goods from Mertens' place on
credit, and subsequently removed to
Placerville. Mertens requested her sev
eral times by letter to pay the bill, and
she proceeded to harass his feeling* by
using mourning paper and ironically con
doling with him over his inability to col
lect the bill. One day he saw a dispatch
in The Call dated at l.os Angeles, an
nouncing that John Smith had "skipped
out" of that place leaving his creditors in
the lurch. He cut out the article, pasted
it on a postal card and wrote under it.
"This is a case similar to yours."
When the humorous lady recelred the
postal she became angry. She afterward
received another with a alip about anoth
er defaulting debtor, and she became en
raged, and complained to the postal au
thorities, who arrested Mertens.
Postofflce Inspectors Erwin and Munro
said yesterday that they had recommend
ed the dismissal because Mertens had
been guilty of only a technical offense, if
guilty at all, and that they did not be
lieve that any jury of business men would
convict the accused. He certainly had
great provocation.

Plain Talk From Governor
Budd and W. W. Foote in
a Caucus of the Party.
SACRAMENTO HANDICAP.
W. H. Mills Is Making H. M. La Rue's
Fight for Governor to the Ad
vantage of Capital.
The Democratic State Central Com
mittee met at the California Hotel yes
terday morning, and those who expect
ed to see a big â¢" were disappointed.
Borne thought that all of the members
who did not pay the 530 assessment
levied durii.g the last campaign would
be dropped from the roll for good, but
more pacitic measures were adopted.
Out of the list of fifty-three delin
quents, forty-seven were reinstated,
and the sinning six, who reside here
and are generally found rallying around
the standard of sub-boss Lanigan, were
given until the next meeting to repent
or, in the words of the resolutions
adopted, "show cause" why they failed
to contribute toward the cause of
Bryan and silver.
When Chairman Alford called the
meeting to order, he said that it would
be the duty of the committee to fill
fifty-three vacancies caused by the
dropping of that number of members,
because of their neglect to respond to
a call for financial aid during the last
campaign. "We found ourselves with
out money to make a fight,"' said Al
ford, "and it was suggested by the ex
ecutive committee that each member
of the State Central Committee be as
sessed (30 to defray the expenses of
battle. The members were not asked
to contribute that sum from their own
purses. The right was given them to
collect the money from the districts
they represented. Fifty-three of them
failed to respond, and they were noti
fied that unless they did so their names
would be dropped from the roll. It is
for the purpose of filling the vacancies
so created that the meeting was called
to-day."
Gavin McNab, in reply to the state
ment of the chairman, said that he had
a set of resolutions to introduce that
would, in his opinion, satisfy every
member of the committee. He then read
a Bet ( f resolutions providing for the
reinstatement of forty-seven of the de
linquent members, because of the ser
vice rendered by them to the party dur
ing the campaign.
W. W. Foote moved the adoption of
the resolutions, and they were carried
without a dissenting vote
The instant adoption of this resolu
tion marked the defeat of the Exam
iner and E. L. Fitzgerald, Labor Com
missioner, but It is in place now to
state th^ inside fa<ts concerning
the conspiracy that was hatched l>y
â which the Examiner hoped to get con
trol of the Democratic State organiza
tion and use it to punish Senator White
and help annexation.
The whole plan to drop fifty-three
members from the committee was put
up by the Examiner and Fitzgerald.
They thought the committee, with the
vacancies filled by appointment of
their own suggestion, would readily
adopt a resolution favoring annexation
of Hawaii. Leading Democrats of
the State got an inkling of what was
g-oing on and therefore decided to
checkmate the game. Friday morn
ing last a caucus of some of thfÂ» lead
ers, among them Governor Budd, W
TV. Foote, W. H. Alford, Frank Gould
and A. Caminetti, was held to consider
the subject. At this meeting Gover
nor Budd let daylight Into the conspir
acy and put down his foot firmly
against the scheme to drop the delin
quent members. In stating the facts
he did not mince words, but went
straight to the mark, declaring that
NEW TO-DAY.
When the appetite fails there is no use in '
trying to tempt the palate with delicate food. I
No matter how good and well-cooked and '
'appetizing" the food may be, it cannot,
give any nourishment unless the stomach is I
able to digest it. Nature indicates the state |
of the constitution by the loss of appetite j
This is an unfailing indicator. It -shows !
that something is fundamentally wrong I
with the nutritive functions.
The only true natural relief must be as
searching and fundamental as the trouble it
aims to overcome. It is the thorough deep- I
searching character of Dr. Pierces Golden '
Medical Discovery, which causes the mar-
velous efficacy in all bilious and digestiv
difficulties. It creates that healthful vitality I
of the entire digestive and nutritive organ !
ism which produces both the natural desire j
for food and the organic capacity to assimi- !
late and transform it into nourishing, reviv-
ifying blood and healthy tissue. It gives
appetite, digestion and sound sleep, and
builds up solid muscular strength and
vital nerve - energy.
H. H. Thompson. Esq.. of P. O. Box 4. Kipple
Blair Co.. Penn'a. writes: "I had been troubled
with extreme vomiting in mamer season, al-
ways after eating; had to be very careful at times
to get anything to stay on my stomach at all; had
been taking other medicines, but without effect.
I heard a friend speak of Dr. Pierce* Golden
Medical Discovery, and thought I would give it a
trial. I used about five bottles of it and think it
is the only medicine that did me any pood as I
have a splendid appetite now. and afn uot using
any medicine at all and don t thiuk I need auv
more.'"
A man who is suffering from the evil
effects of constipation doesn't feel like
work, and can't even enjoy his leisure
hours. Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets are a
sure, swift, safe, and permanent cure for
constipation. They are tiny, sugar coated
granules. One little "Pellet" is a gentle
laxative, and two a mild cathartic. They

get you to take a substitute for the sake
Hi the added urofit
the proposed removal of committee
men was a scheme concocted by a cer
tain designing element In the party to
put Senator White in a hole and fur
ther the plans of annexation.
The Governor was ably sustained by
W. W. Foote, who declared that the
Democratic party aa an organization
had pronounced against annexation.
He asserted that nothing but party
misfortune and demoralization would
follow if the State Central Committee
should declare In favor of the annexa
tion scheme and seek to instruct Sen
ator White to change his position on
the question. Other speakers addressed
the caucus in the same spirit of resist
ance to the Examiner-Fitzgerald pro
gramme.
When the conspirators heard of the
meeting and perceived that the real
motive of the proposition to remove
committeemen was understood by the
party leaders, and would soon be made
known to everybody interested, they
began to hedge. The pressure to re
move members was slackened and
finally withdrawn. The Examiner
began to throw dust in the eyes of the
public and cry "Rainey. The big list
of fifty-three members plated for dis
placement was reduced to six follow
ers of Lanigan, who were pimply sus
pended and cited to show cause why
they should not be removed. There is
not a single follower of Rainey on the
list of suspended. As a co!d (act,
Rainey never cut any figure in the cas.>.
The mention of his name was an after
thought or ruse of the Examiner to di
vert suspicion from its scheme to get
possession of the works.
The outcome is one of the Examiner's
beautiful victories, in which it lost ev
erything in sight, and was not able to
control a single vote in the State Cen
tral committee. The programme
mapped out by Governor Budd and
other Democratic leaders in thc> cau
cus was not deviated from in the com
mittee.
The people erf Sacramento seem to be
surprised that steps wore not taken by
the State Central Committee of the
Democratic party to designate that city
as the place for holding the next State
convention of the party. This is the
n the subject was deferred: It
has come directly to the knowledge of
leading Democrats that W. H. Mills of
the Southern Pacific is making, through
C. F. Montgomery and other agents,
an active canvass to secure the nomi
motlon of 11. M. La Rue for Governor.
Men of political sense and keen intelli
gence saw at a glance that the selec
tion of Sacramento as the place for
holding the convention would ot- a gun
Bred by the committee in the interest
of Mills and La Rue. and bo it was wise
ly determined to defer the question of
selection until another time. 'The ad
vantages of Sacramento as a conven
tion city were appreciated by the com
mittee, but the candidacy of La Hue
backed by William 11. Mills, handi
capped the town.
Frank Gould of Stockton next intro
duced a resolution authorizing the
chairman to appoint a committee of
five to look after the interests of the
party in the event of the Stratton pri
mary law being upheld by the Supreme
Court. There was no objection raised
and the resolution was unanimously
adopted.
Gould next introduced another reso
lution, empowering the chairman to
appoint a committee of seven to attend
to the organization ( ,f the party
throughout the State He said that it
was the opinion of many leading Dem
ocrats that such a committee should be
appointed, so that the work of organ
ization would be well in hand b. i-., r .
the meeting of the State Convention.
W. I. Brobeck opposed the appoint
ment of the committee. He said that
he did not believe in attempting to per
petuate a committee. "When the next
State convention meets," said he "a
new State central committee will b^
elected to succeed this committee. Thar
committee can select from its body a
sub-committee to look after the mat
ters contemplated by the resolution. I
do not believe that the present com
mittee should adot)t any such meas
ure."
Kinney of Los Angeles supported the
resolution in a lengthy speech. He be
lieved that the committee Â«hould i
pointed to look after the party Inter
est before the State convention. "Be
fore the convention meets." said he. "we
can have the State thoroughly organ
ized and the party in a position to at
once continue the Avork of the conven
tion."
Byron Ball of Tolo paid that he fa
vored the resolution If the members of
the committee were appointed from the
State central committee.
<;.>u!d replied that hÂ»- had no objec
tion to an amendment of that nature
and the resolution, as amended, was
adopted.
Ex-Congressman Camlnetti then
moved that the State central commit
tee hereafter meet monthly.
After a short debate it' was decided
to hold the monthly meptings. but not
before the Supreme Court passes <> n thr
question the validity of the new pri
mary law.
The committee then adjourned to
meet at the call of jhe chair.
The members not included in the res
olution of reinstatement and who have
been cited to "show cause" arc- T. W
Doyle, Thomas E. Scully, Chfirl^s Wit
' beck, E. P. Mogan, J. J. Byrne and
John J. Lynch.
Chairman Alford stated after the
meeting that It would probably be two
weeks before he would announce thÂ»
; committee to look after the organiza
| tiftn of the party. "It is a very Impor
tant committee." said he, "and I want
J to pick frut the best men on the State
j committee and thr,pp T know will at-
I tend to the duty intrusted to them."
MIT WITH A SWORD.
James Lucy, a Saloonkeeper,
Charged With Assault With
a Deadly Weapor).
Charles E. Durning, m% Harriet street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday for the arrest of James
Lucy, a saloonkeeper at 819 Bryant street
on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon. He stated that he was in a
saloon on Harriet and Brannan streets
Friday night playing solitaire, when Lucy
came In and using an offensive expression
mado a Mow at him with a Japanese
sword. He dodged, but received a slight
cut on the head.
Lvc Â£ T a ? a T res t*a'- and his version of
the affair is that a friend presented him
with a Japanese sword Friday and he
went to tne saloon to show it to- some
friends. Burning and he had not been
friends, as Durning owed him mom-, and
when he asked him for it he used a' vile
expression. Lucy struck him with his
fist. He denied using the sword. He was
released on bonds.

THE SA>* FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JAXI'ARV 30, 189 S.
GOLDEN HOPES DASHED.
Carrie Behr, the Actress, Who Would to Klondike Go.
The golden Aurora bnrealls of the Klondike has lured, with Its flit
tering rays, all sorts and conditions of people from thÂ» comforts of civili
zation to the icy hardships of the north. The vessels bound for that des
olate region have- carried in their complement of passengers business men
and adventurers, prize fighters and parsons, millionaires and bums, corre
spondents and saloon-keepers, nuns and Gussle La More, but the first ac
tress to become dazzled by the splendor of those Alaskan beams that
stretch around the world is Carrie Behr, at present playing with "The Girl
From Paris" Company at ih<> Baldwin.
A day or bo ago. so th^ story runs, Mr. "Warmington. manager of the
company, upon opening his morning mall brought to light a bill from one
of the city's large outfitting establishments. It was made <ut in the name
of the company and called for a Klondike outfit of much elaboration. An
immediate investigation was commenced, which shortly resulted in the ap
pearance of the charming Carrie, who coolly informed her employer that
she had come to the conclusion that there was more money to be made on
the Yukon than on the stage, and consequently she Intended going there.
The scene which followed this announcement is said to hav<- hf>en one in
which the principal features were an angry man and a tearful woman
grouped around the shadow of a broken contract, with a civil suit for dam
ages in the background.
Mr. Warmington when spoken to on the subject said: "I had not the
slightest suspicion of Miss iu>hr's Intentions until I received this bill. I
looked at It and wondered which member of my company intended sur-
I rising me by appearing in a new role, and sent for my property man to
see by whose orders the purchase had been made. He told me he knew
no more of the affair than I did. I finally went to the place where the
goods had been bought and found that Miss P.>-hr was th* 1 young lady who
had been investing in fur pants, dogskin bonnets and other things equally
useful on the northern circuit. I called her to account and was told that
she intended going to Alaska, as she had saved about M 0.90 md mw no
reason why she should not invest it In good paying mining properties in
the north.
"I explained to her that there was a written reason, commonly called a
contract. In my possession, and that If she attempt* d t<> i ike any trip
she would find it rather hard to get away without pas- g through a
court. After some trouble she took a reasonable view of the matter, so
the affair ended."
'No, this is no advertising dodge." said Miss Behl-"a= she sat discuss
ing an oyster stew after the performance, through the f am of which her
beauty shone with the dim splendor of a star in the milky way. "I have
friends in the far north, and I have money h-r.-. I wanted to go up and
try to turn over some of my capital and make eno-ierh to allow me to re
tire. I realize that I might hav^ been disappointed in my mining ventures;
but it would go hard if I did not get back with more than I took up.
"If the worst came to the worst, well, Swiftwater Kill is not the only
nugget in the diggin'sâ see.'
"I don't care to n>.-ak about my trouble with Mr. Warmlngton; he Is
a tyrant to dash the only really good chance I ever had and I don't be
lieve he would have done it if that miserable Ward, our advance agent, had
not filled his head with the horrors of a broken contract and got him to
threaten me with th^ whole of th<- police department However, they need
not crow over their victory, for I may fool them yet. "
With which comforting reflection Miss Behr again vanished behind
the mists of her stew.
CAPTAIN EDE'S
LATEST DEAL
Pays $130,000 for More
of Market- Street
Property.
It Is Situated Between Barron
Estate Parcels, Near
Powell.
This City, He Thinks, Has a Future.
A. M. Speck 4 Co. Were the
Brokers.
Captain William Ede is at it again.
The captain is a capitalist too well
known to need any pedigree airing.
But "at It again," to quote the ex
pression of a local realty broker,
means investing in more real estate.
In fact that seems to haw developed
into a hobby with the capitalist, to
the long list of purchases already
made by him being added a week or
tw r o ago that of the Auzerais property
on the corner of Powell and Ellis
streets.
Now comes another investment.
Yesterday, through his brokers. A. M.
Speck & Co.* Ede consummated a deal
by which he pays $150,000 for property
on Market street, near Powell. It was
a pure cash transaction and the seller
was Mrs. Jane Reilly.
The property is situated at 101 C
Market street, 161:4% feet west of
Powell, on the northwest lint, and
extends through to Eddy street. The
Market street frontage is 28:4 feet
and the frontage on Eddy street is
23 feet. The property lies between
the gore corner of the Barron estate
and a trapezoidal piece of the same
estate.
In addition to this and the Auzerais
property mentioned in the foregoing.
Captain Ede possesses valuable prop
erty on Market street near the Phelan
building and other smaller landed
interests throughout the city. He is
what may be termed a "speedy"
buyer, Speck & Co. taking only three
days' time to consummate the Auzer
ais deal, the price in that instance
being $152, 000, while the latter pur
chase was made in a few days.

ESCAPED FROM
A PADDED CELL
The Stranrje Disappear
ance of an Insane
Patient
Daniel Doherty Preferred Lib
erty to Being Sent to the
Agnews Asylum.
How He Mannged to Get Out of Hi*
Cell in the Receiving Hospital
Is a Puzzle.
The escape of an Insane patient from
a padded rel! in the Receiving Hospital
yesterday is shrouded in mystery, and
. is causing the attaches of the hospital
i and the Sheriff's deputies no end of
worry and surprise.
Daniel" Doherty. a young man living
at 1917 McAllister street, is a victim of
the morphine habit to such an extent
as to make him irresponsible for his
actions. He was arrested Friday night
, on the complaint of his brother on a
i charge of insanity, and locked up in a
padded cell in the hospital.
Yesterday morning he was taken be
fore the Insanity Commissioners and
i committed to the Agnews asylum. Two
deputy Sheriffs took him back to the
padded cell, and it was their intention
to take him and another patient to the
asylum in the afternoon.
i When the deputies went to the cell
about 2 o'clock, to their surprise they
found it empty. A search was made,
but no trace of Doherty could be found.
No one had seen him leave the hospital,
and it dawned upon them that he had
made his escape, preferring freedom'
to being confined in an asylum.
How he succeeded In getting out of
the cell was a mystery. The deputies
were sure that they locked the padlock
on the door, but when they examined
it it was unlocked. No one had visited
the cell after the deputies had. as they
thought, locked it. There were only
two conclusions to arrive atâ either
that the deputies were mistaken in
I thinking they had turned the key in
the padlock or that Doherty had some
friend who secretly got into the hos
pital and opened the padlock with a
false key.
It is only a Week ago since Martin
Cavin, another insane patient, made
his escape from the hospital, but after
sleeping all night in a freightcar he
thought the padded cell preferable, and
next morning surrendered himself.
ATTEMPTED
TO MURDER
AND ROB
Four Men Are Found
Looting a Cigar-
Store.
J. Falck Attacked and His
Property Packed for
Transportation.

The Front Door Torn From the
Casing and the Shelves

ESCAPED IN THE CROWD.
Detectives Put On the Case, but No
Arrests Have as Yet Been
Made.
One of the most daring attempts at
robbery, according to the police the
ory, ever brought to their attention
took place early yesterday morning.
Four men, whose descriptions have been
given to the police, entered the cigar
store of J. Falck at 113 Second street
about 6 o"clock, and had it not been
for the arrival of the proprietor the
store would have been completely loot
ed, as the men had packed up valua
ble pipes, tobaccos and cigars near the
door preparatory to their departure.
When Falck arrived at the door of
his establishment he noticed nothing
wrong, but on putting the key in the
lock, the whole door, which is of heavy
glass, fell inside on top of the case
which is placed in the center of the
store. Immediately two men who
were standing on the sidewalk, started
to run down Second street, and two
others, who had been operating Inside,
jumped to their feet and struck a
heavy blow at Falck. with a Mack
jack, as he stepped back.. When the
door fell in Falck realized that some
thing was wrong and was consequent
ly on his guard, and to this fact he be
lieves he owes his l!f*\ or at least es
cape from severe injuries.
As the men rushed past him Into the
street, the proprietor, who is an old
man, raised an alarm and immediately
the store was crowded with people who
were not aware of what had happened.
In the confusion th^ burglars made
their escape, carrying with them in
their por-kets several dollars' worth of
pipes aivl cigar-holders. When the
excitement subsided an examination of
th<- premise* brought to light the fact
that the whole door casing had been
torn out with a sharp tool, and after
the men had entered the store the door
was propped up in its original posi
tion.
The case was reported to the South
ern station and afterward to the Chief
of Police, and detectives were detailed
on the case, but bo far have beea una
ble to get any clew to the burglars,
although it is thought the men are old
"timers." The burglary was ex
ceedingly daring as a noise must have
been made while tearing down the
door and as the people were constant
ly passing on their way to business it
is thought remarkable that the men
were not discovered before the proprie
tor arrived.
All suspicious characters are closely
questioned by the detectives on the
case, and it is supposed the men who
committed th*Â» burglary are well known
and will soon be under arrest. Dur
ing" thp day two men who were ap
parently watchinp: the store were taken
aside and questioned, but they were
again released. All efforts will be
made to capture the men who at
tempted robbery and possibly murder.

I ctrensth to the sexual orsii* ca * th * n4The Race to Capture the Soudan
THE Trench have suddenly
evinced a desire for conquest in
the Soudan, and, if report be
correct, have advanced across
the African continent, regard-
less of the treaty rights of other
powers, until they are pretty close to
Khartoum itself. If they occupy Khar
toum, the trouble will begin, for Great
Britain is not likely to submit tamely
to the capture by a foreign power of
this most Important strategical post.
Khartoum is the key of the Soudan.
the nation holding it controls the Nile,
along which all the traffic from the im
mensely rich regions of the Equatorial
Soudan must pass. Millions of money
and thousands of lives have been lav
ished on this oasis of the desert. Egypt,
to whom the territory nominally be
longs, has proved herself, even with the
aid of Great Britain, unable to hold the
land against the forces of fanaticism
controlled by the Mahdi, and since the
annihilation of Hicks Pasha's army in
ISB3, the whole district has been aban
doned to all the horrors of barbaric
Mohammedan rule.
To-day, just as there is some pros
pect of the Egyptian expeditionary
force, now on the Nile, breaking down
the already weakened power of the
Mahdi, the French appear on the scene
to complicate matters. No one can fore- |
see the outcome of this international j
embroglio, but it is probable that the {
difficulty will be settled in the diplo
matic courts of Europe, rather than on
the burning sands of Egypt. Two great
nations, such as France and England, are
not likely to fight over the Soudan, and
even if they did. the scene of war would
promptly be shifted nearer home. Great
Britain would meet France, not by
Binding troops to the East, but by pre
venting the French fro-m doing so. The
first Napoleon's designs upon the British
possessions in India "Were frustrated by
the vigor with which Nelson's fleet
swept the Mediterranean, his expedi
tion to Egypt was converted into a dis
astrous failure, and the battle of the
Nile left the great general helplessly
stranded on a foreign shore. The same
plan of campaign would certainly
be adopted by Great Britain to-day.
Meanwhile the little French expedi
tionary force in the Soudan is likely to
have enough of desert campaigning be
fore it has finished. One experience of
this kind is sufficient to satisfy even
the most ardent military enthusiast.
The difficulties attendant upon moving
large bodies of men in this arid climate
are almost insuperable, the water ques
tion constantly presents itself in new
and trying phases and the problem of
transport has never been satisfactorily
solved.
It fell to my lot. by one of those ac
cidents which occur now and again in
every man's life, to play a humble part
In one of these African campaigns. The
expedition was not long, nor was it
particularly bloodthirsty, and conse
quently the world, by this time, has
forgotten all about It.
T happened to be in Australia in the
early part of 1885, when the news of
Khartoum's fall and the tragic death
of "Chinese" Gordon sent a thrill
through the civilized world. One of the
best and brightest of British soldiers
was gone, his loss was distinctly
traceable to the fatal policy of pro-
crastination characteristic of Glad
stone's administration. Gordon might
have been saved had the Nile expedi
tion, then almost within reach of Khar
toum, started on its long and perilous
Journey but a week or two earlier. As
it was. Sir C. Wilson with a small force

reached Khartoum by steamer but two
days after the fall of the town, only |
to find that the place was in the hands
of the Mahdists and that nothing could
be done to remedy the fatal error made
by the English Government.
It is no wonder that the British peo
ple were indignant; a wave of warlike
enthusiasm passed over the land, and
no cry was heard but that of revenge
for the untimely death of "Chinese"
Gordon. The manner of his life, its
austere virtue and strange military
piety, had always placed Gordon on a
different plane from other soldiers of
the crown. The manner of his death,
after holding to the last with unflinch
ing courage a famine-stricken and be
leaguered town, raised him almost to
the heights of martyrdom.
At least that was the popular feeling
of the day, and it is no wonder that
the sentiment spread to the colonies
beyond sea. Australia caught the con
tagion pretty badly, and the Govern
ment of the colony of New South
Wales, to show in a practical manner
its loyalty to fhe crown, volunteered
to dispatch at its own expense a con
tingent to aid the British forces j n
wiping out the disgrace of Gordon's
death.
There was a good deal of humor in
the proposal, for New South Wales,
though owning a large and wealth
producing territory, had but little over
a million inhabitants. Great Britain,
with her huge Indian army to draw
upon, had obviously no need for aid
from such a Liliputian source. Still,
for some unaccountable reason, the
suggestion struck the fancy of the En
glish Cabinet. Perhaps it was to give
the world an object lesson as to the
solidity of the British Empire; perhaps
merely to gratify the vanity of a valu
able colony. But whatever the cause,
the British Government accepted the
offer.
No one was more surprised than the
Colonials. Such a thing had never
been heard of before. It had become
quite fashionable, whenever the Eng
lish nation -was engaged in a little
war, for the colonies to offer a portion
of their diminutive armies for service
at the front. The thine did no harm
and helped to advertise the colony, to
keep the world aware of its existence.
There was hurrying and scurrying
and unbounded patriotic enthusiasm
when the news reached Sydney. The
worst Russian scare which had ever
afflicted the colony was nothlnp to it.
New South Wales was pledged to dis
patch within a fortnight a fully
equipped regiment of five hundred in
fantry and two hundred and tlfty field
artillery, guns and all. To the "credit
of the colony, the promise was faith
fully fulfilled.
Th<>re was no difficulty about the ar
tillery. A permanent force of some
five hundred men is always maintain
ed to garrison the harbor defense bat
teries which make Sydney one of the
best protected ports in the world. All
that was necessary was to call for
volunteers, and the whole force at once
signified its willingness to go.
With the infantry it was different.
There was no standing army to draw
from, only a couple of thousand par
tially paid volunteers, or militia men.
And when it came to leaving their
homes and families for the desert wilds
of the Soudan these men were not es
pecially anxious to go. Some three
hundred or so volunteered, but of
course a new regiment had to be form
ed, and material was drawn from all
quarters.
There was no trouble in obtaining
recruits, civilians of all classes were
only too willing to join. Bank clerk*
and civil servants, old soldiers and
sailors, policemen and wharf laborers,
men of every occupation and charac

ter, all flnrk^d to the recruiting office,
and. providing they could pasa the
medical examination, were enrolled.
Some of these men had never had a
rifle in their hands before, did not
even know the rudiments of the goose
step, but the old stagers pulled them
through, and in ten days they were
sent forth, clad in the traditional red
jacket of the British army, to fight the
mother country's battles in Egypt.
But despite its heterogeneous char
acter the regiment soon proved its ca
pacity. Three weeka on board the
troopship, with constant drilling and
strictest of discipline, brought it Into
a compact and serviceable form, and
when we landed at Suakim the British
officers, knowing nothing of the hap
hazard oriein of the contingent, were
surprised at the character of the troops
Australia was able to turn out.
So was Tommy Atkins, who was
soon on the friendliest possible terms
with his brother from across the sea.
For one thing the Australian youth
had a proficiency in swearing which
was the envy <>f the Britishers, and
when the English regiments returned
home they took many new and forcible
cuss words with them, which, even at
the present day, impart a strangely
Australian flavor to many an imperial
barrack yard.
Suakim, when the Australians land
ed, was one of the busiest ports. The
shores of the little lagoon were fairly
encircled with great ocean steamers. j
Men-of-war were dotted here and j
there, their guns commanding the far- i
away ranges behind the camp where
the rebels clustered; a magnificent P.
and â¢ >. liner, with wide, open ports and
clean, well ventilated derks. proved
the care and attention which awaited
the sick and wounded. The town, which
is on an island and can be reached only
by a well -guarded causeway, fairly
hummed with military life. Every
where there was the orderly bustle of
a well-regulated camp, and strangest
of all there was the BriMsh navy,
with his vast bulk of beef-fed flesh.
The navvy, who. except when drunk,
is generally a man of peace, seemed
strangely out of place amid such war
like surroundings. But he was there
strictly on business. He was to build
a railway after the soldiers had paci
fied the hostile tribes with rifles and
machine guns. And at the time we all
fondly believed that our mission was
to take that railway right across 200
miles of desert until it struck the great
river at Berber. Thus, though it was
too lato to save Gordon, we were to
solve the Central African problem and
insure the pacification of the I'pper
Vile region.
The railway would have heen made
right enough, though at what cost of
menandmoneyl know n<>t, had not the
British Government, with characteris
tic vacillation, withdrawn from the en
terprise before it was well begun All
the material for the railway, even to
the depots and name boards, was on
the spot: dozens of steamers freiphted
with rails and construction plant wen
in the harbor, waiting to discharge, and
had the line gone through the map of
Africa might have been colored in a
very different way. At any rate Cen
tral Africa would have been opened to
European trade and the fanatical fol
lowers of the Mahdi would have found
sudden reason to mend their ways.
The flat, sandy shore of Ruakim Bay
was one vast camp. The soldiers were
not quartered in the town; the place
was much too small, but were camped
on the plain, protected only by a
i slight trench and a thin line of Vn
i tries from the attacks of the hostile
Soudanese. And Fuzzy-Wuzzy. as
Kipling has christened him. is a terri
bly treacherous enemy, especially on a
dark night. His tricks are endless,
he can sneak through a line of the
most vigilant sentries, and at one time
his nightly visits used to cause great
alarm in the British camp.
The soldiers slept in large tents of
! the Tndian pattern, each holding forty
or fifty men. And at night-time, when
all were quietly sleeping, Fuzzy-Wuzzy,

having in some miraculous manner
passed the line of sentries, would sneak
into a tent. The light would go out,
there would be a shriek, and before the
suddenly awakened soldiers could
seize their arms and grope their way
out of the tent the assailant would be
gone. And all that would be left to
Indicate the visit would be a dead sol
dler, a spear through his heart, Ptrirkm
down in the midst of his comrades.
This practice was so greatly feared
that when we moved out of Suakim
and started railway-making in the
heart of the enemy's camp, the troops
were actually forbidden to sleep in the
tents at night. In the daytime they
were used as a shelter from the sun,
but at night no man was safe within
a tangle of cordage and canvas.
The Australian contingent saw the
tail end of one of the biggest engage
ments which have occurred near Sua
kim, but fortunately for themselves,
they arrived just two days too late for
the heavy fighting. The affair at To
frik, when the Soudanese made a de
termined attack on MacNelll'fl zareba,
very nearly ended in a disaster.
Osman Dlgna, who commanded the
Mahdi's troops in this region, sud
denly concentrated a large force on
the British squares, but though one of
the Indian regiments gave way for a
time, the attack was eventually re
pulsed.
The loss, however, was very heavy,
a large portion of the transport was
cut to pieces by the enemy, and when
we marched over the spot a week
later, we had good reason to know that
a hattle had been fought th^re. If
there is one smell in this earth which
is worse than another It is that of a
defunct camel. And when you take
not only one but hundreds and hun
dreds of the much deceased beasts, and
scatter them along: the track, you will
realize the awful atmosphere we
marched through. TVnrpe still, it was
not an uncommon thing to come across
a human arm or leg sticking bolt up
right out of the sand. Rome poor fel
low was hastily buried here, with but
a thin layer of soil above his corpse, a
covering too light to secure rest for his
remains. Another time, in some out
of the way nullah or dry creek bed, we
would step over corpses which had
never been buried at all. and which
would remain until they became as the
bones which whitened the plain all
around.
These things were not pleasant to look
upon, but at the moment, so absorbed
werp we in our own occupations, we
missed the horror of it all. We were
marching through burning sand, the
sun like a ball of fire overhead, to at
tack Osman Digna in his stronghold at
Tamaii. to teach him that these vio
lent assaults upon the British forces
could not be made with impunity.
General Graham, who was then in
command, had determined to do thÂ«
thing thoroughly, so he took out near
ly all the troops at Suakim, British,
Australian and Indian. Some ten thou
sand strong we marched in a huge hol
low square, or rather oblong formation,
but, if safe, it was weary work. We
had to carry supplies of every kind,
including water, with us, for the coun
try would yield nothing, and the cen
ter of the scfuare was a seething mass
of unruly transport animals. Camels,
horses and mules, ambulance wagons
and water carts, camp followers of
every nationality, were crowded to
gether, and cur rate of progress was
necessarily the rate of progress of the
transport.
We marched four deep, with fixed
bayonets, on each side of the square,
and every now and then would come
the order to halt and face front. It
might be a threatened rush by the
enemy, who were constantly hovering
in the surrounding bush, or it might
be only some unfortunate camel which,
had dropped its load. As it meant sud
den death fur either man or beast to
fall behind the guarding fringe of ri
des, the whole force had to halt until
the mischief could be repaired.
Thus it took us all day to reach
Tamaii, a distance of fifteen or sixteen
miles, and after all there was no bat
tle. Osman Digna, wisely enough, con
strued discretion as the better part of
valor and tied before our force could
get at him. A few of his bravest war
riors, however, remained hidden be
hind the hills at the back of the little
town, and as we approached Reming
ton bullets, fired from some invisible
spot, came dropping from the skies
among us.
It was annoying, because we could
see nothing to fire back at, and we
were most anxious to prove our skill
in rifie practice. But perhaps the man
most annoyed stood right in front of
me. One of these mysterious drop
ping bullets punctured a nice, clean
hole through his right shoulder. I re
member watching the red stain on his
kharkee tunic where the bullet came
out, and wondering what caused it. It
was not until I saw the stain spreading
all over his back that I realized the
man was wounded, and then I think
he realized the fact himself, for he
went off to the rear and provided the
ambulance corps with a little occcu
pation.
After this we burned some huts and
filled up some wells, and the battle was
over. lam sure we were all very glad,
for we had not the slightest desire to
be shot, nor did we wish to face a

adequate presentation of the problems
involved without reference to the en- j
tire question of production and distri
button, with some thoughts on co-oper
ative profit-sharing as a remedy which
will finally be brought about as a re
action from trusts.
It may be said that wealth is dis
tlibuted when it Is created, and that
the tendency in this country and age is
for the instrumentalities of accumula
tion to go into the hands of fewer and
fewer persons. There are relatively
fewer employers than then- were in the
old days. As a result we have pam
pered arrogance on the one side and
pauperized subserviency on the other.
This becomes bad fur the independence
of the American citizen, who is warped
from his independent sovereignty by
reason of the struggle for a livelihood,
desiring to favor the capital, corpora
tions and trusts for which he labors.
As the trust restricts profits to the few. ]
so It has a bad influence over the i
many. As the tendency is toward the
aggregation of wealth in relatively
few hands, it stands to reason that the
boy starting out in the world has a
smaller chance to become an employer
and original tradesman. Whereas he
once had something like one chance in
three, I doubt whether he now has one
chance in twenty to become an em- i
ployer of other men. It is by specula- j
ting in and controlling other men's i
labor that wealth is produced for a
few.
It is well to note that the silent ag
gressions of the trust and the wild cry
of tho anarchist lead practically to the
same ultimate misfortune â the inse
curity of property, and, as a corollary,
to the insecurity of human life and the
destruction of the general welfare, j
While it is true that the general con- j
dltlon of labor has been vastly im- !
proved and that there was never a '
time when the successful man had so
much to make life comfortable, it is
also true that there is more produced
than can be consumed under present :
conditions. This leads to the growth
of an unnecessary class of men out of
employment. Let me illustrate: One
man has forty thousand acres and
Jives on it with his family. It is un
necessary to say that there Is but one
woman on that tract who can buy a
piano and the general accompaniments
of culture. But if you were to divide
that land .imonpr two hundred thrifty
people behold how enormously you
would multiply the power of consump- !
tion, how you would extend the call
for labor, and how the blessings of
wealth would be distributed over a
wider area of country and to a larger
proportion of the population.
A general and thorough education is
in a way a remedy, but when it comes
to solving the direct question. "What
shall I do with my boy?" it becomes a
knotty problem, for his chances are not
â¢uhat they were before the present sys
tem. There is no reason for a pessi
mistic outlook, but there will be suffer
ing during the working out of the
remedy by readjustments and co-op
eration on some equitable basis. Co
operation is the goal of labor.
Trusts engender other trusts and the
tendency of all trusts is to minimize
the number of employers and augment
the number of employes. How far the
tendency in -this direction can go with
out creating such estrangement be
tween the classes as to produce the
danger of collision I am not prepared
to say.
Great wealth as an incident to pros
perity is tolerable; but great wealth
supervening upon a general condition
of adversity and the impoverishment
of the masses, or the common life of
the country, is dangerous in the ex
treme. It is a menace to the repose of
free Institutions.
But the reactionary point from the
condition of a trust relation of all la
bor and the tendency which such
trusts have is to co-operation of labor.
Co-operation would minimize the num
ber of employed and augment the
number of profit sharers or employers.
It Is hard to say what will be the

ing decade or

average boy as very promising. I
know that the tendency of business is
to go into fewer and fewer lines, Just
as the tendency is to limit houses to a
small area by building them very high.
Take architecture as an exnmple: It
is a fact that in this city as well as in
every other one a few architects do all
the business. I suppose it is safe to
pay that there are a few hundred firms
of architects in every city of the size

that a few firms in the law do all the

In a given city it is a very small num
ber that do any business to speak of.
Now, if this is the tendency of all
lines of human industry, it is plain to
be seen that while business was never
80 good for the successful it was never
80 bad for the many who do not get it
to do. The success of some and the
failure of others from a monetary
point of view is not due to a difference
in their abilities either, for I know
great architects who have failed, men
who really knew their business in the
most thorough manner. I can name a
man who had money and ability and he
was at one time the greatest of all the
architects in Boston, yet he is to-day
the editor of a great weekly paper. It
is hard to say why he failed in his
chosen business. I think a boy has a
splendid chance to succeed well if he
succeeds at all. but it seems to me that
the number who are to succeed in a
given vocation is becoming smaller and
smaller. Almost every trade and pro
fession is overcrowded.

BASIS OF DR. SCHENK'S THEORY OF SEX
DR. EISEN'S VIEWS.
To mv mind Dr. Schenk's theory is perfectly plausible from a physical
point of view. Biologically though, it amounts to nothing, for the life be
gins long before the creation of the cell.
NOT since the discovery of the
X-ray by Professor Roentgen,
about two years ago, has any
thing so interested the scientific
and medical men of San Fran
cisco as the announcement of Dr.
Schenk of Vienna that he has discov
ered the secret of sex. Wherever two
or more scientists or doctors chance to
meet It is the one subject talked of,
and theories and opinions are freely
exchanged.
The medical men as a rule do not put
much faith In Dr. Schenk's statement,
but rather Incline to the belief that the
success attending his experiments has
been due to mere coincidence. The sci
entists, on the contrary, say that the
idea Is perfectly feasible, but think
that the Importance of the discovery,
from a scientific point of view, has been
greatly overrated. These men have
gathered from the published state
ments of Dr. Schenk the impressjon
that he held that he had made a most
Important biological discovery. This
they deny and say that whatever he
had discovered It only points to physi
cal facts, and has no bearing whatever
on the theories of the origin of life.
Although It is of greater importance
to the world, it is no more a biological
discovery than was the discovery that
rubbing the body produced warmth. It
is simply the controlling of certain un
known forces to produce a certain de
sired effect.
Like all theoretical subjects, this one
has many sides. There are many rea
sons why Dr. Schenk's theory is cor
rect. There are also many reasons why
it Is wrong. Some physicians cham
pion Dr. Schenk and say he Is the
greatest man of the time, while others
pooh-pooh his Ideas and laugh at his
assertions. When learned men reach
such opposite conclusions It is hard for
the lay mind to comprehend the sub
ject at all.
Reasoning from Dr. Shenk's prem
ises his theory must be correct but it
so happens that he has stated as facts
things which the scientific world has
not yet accepted as such. He may be
right, but proof of his assertions has
not yet been forthcoming.

"The most generally accepted theory
at present is that two germ cells, male

"It is fairly well established that the

female, and in most species the germ
cell is so accurately balanced that it
will turn in one direction just as readily
as the other. A slight stimulus suf

turns the germs to masculinity; cold in

Doubtless any force which may act on

that always, as now, the winning boy
must be eager, open-eyed, determined,
unconquerable. But added to these
personal qualities our young man must
know his subject and its relations
(whether in theoretical or in practical
fields) in more complete detail than
was formerly essential.
Not only must equipment for voca
tion be more complete, but it must
come to be recognized, as always it
was true, that men are needed at all
posts in life with an overplus of power
for their work, and that of such men
only can anything like success be pre
dicted. You cannot pour a man into
an occupation as you can pour wheat
into a half-bushel and make exact
measure of him. If he does not round
up he will be scant. If he is to win
the trained man in him must overrun
the outline of his occupation. From the
scavenger to the college president the
man must be superior to his calling.
Success hinges on the mastery between
the two. If the man is master he is
safe. If the occupation is master the
man Is lost.

Competition is growing keener in every
line of industry. Take the learned pro
fessions â they are overcrowded. The
few succeed, the many simply exist.
Take the skilled mechanic â he is con
stantly being supplanted by newly in
vented labor saving devices. Take the
clerkâ woman is rapidly invading his
territory. Take the farmhandâ he must
retire before the advance of improved
agricultural implements. Take the
merchantâ what chance has he with
his limited resources against the mod
ern department store, with its immense
capital and practically unlimited cred
it? Take the manufacturer, covered as
he is by the Aegis of protection â even
he succumbs to that power of aggre
gated capital, the "trust," and retires
from the field disheartened, broken,
bankrupt.
The last generation witnessed a
struggle for wealth; this generation
witnesses a struggle for existence.
Salaries are decreasing â the cost of liv
ing increasing. Legislation is power
less to remedy the evil. It may delay
the inevitable conflict between capital
and labor, but sooner or later social
revolution will come.
The proper field for a young man to
day is in a new country. There lies
his opportunity. England's statesmen
have always recognized the advantages
newly opened territory offers. For hun
dreds of years they have been found
ing colonies for British subjects in all
quarters of the globe. The other Euro
pean nations are beginning to pattern
after England. Africa is already well
partitioned among them â Asia will be
the next scene of colonial aggrandize
ment. On our own continent the gold
fields of the Klondike are just now the
promised land, and within the next
decade hundreds of young men to
whom the future looks dark and for
bidding, pioneers in far, frozen Alaska,
will become rich and successful be
cause of the opportunities offered in
the development of that new country.

"I've lost my hat," he said, piteously,
U they rushed upon him: "Please find

incoherently^ The expression on his
face was thiit of a troubled child. Later
it became less intelligent. The lines
which made the face seem firmly
molded appeared to relax and to give
the effect of uabbiness.
In the face there was no trace of hor
ror at any time, only one of trouble
and bewilderment. "Willie" Gipp ex
isted no longer.
Some mental derangement had slain
him before he killed his mother. In law,
there was no one to expiate the crime,
so they moved the helpless creature to
the State Hospital for the Insane and
waited for him to die.
They who wonder about the soul may
wonder about the immortal part of
Gipp during the long trance which was
so like the sleep of death in its destruc
tion of memory and unconsciousness
of surroundings. Prom the moment of
his apprehension he relapsed quickly
into coma, as one who is utterly weary
and must rest.
They lifted him into a cot as if he
had been a patient under ether, and
thenceforward volition seemed to have
left him forever. He never spoke. He
never moved, except when the attend
ants forced him to and guided his
limbs. For perhaps half of the time he
lay on his back, his eyes fixed upon
the ceiling, but with vacant gaze. A
child would have followed with his eyes
the strategic marchings of flies upon
that ceiling, vaguely, but consciously.
Gipp, it seemed, saw nothingâ certain
ly not the kitchen of his home, from
which they had carried out his mother.
No; he had forgotten even the hat he
lost when he became a child that day.
Wonderful as it appeared to the doc
tors, who expected that he would waste
away and die, he neither lost nor
gained weight. Physically he remained
what he was when they carried him to
his cot. In the matter of food he swal
lowed what was placed in his mouth
and ceased to swallow when they put
in no more. That he had" any feeling
in the matter no one could say.
Some who saw him held the theory
that his sense of motion and speech
was chained, but that he was aware
Of all that passed about him, remem
bered the killing of his mother and lay
there day after day, month after
month, going over and over the ter
rible events, unable to do anything but
think. This the doctors said was not
possible under the circumstances. He
did not think at all. they said, his con
dition being one of anesthesia, due to
shock.
On January 8. last, three years and
two months after the tragedy, "Wil
lie" Gipp awoke. The brain for a time
almost readjusted itself into the per
fect machine it had been before his
crime.
An attendant busy in the dormitory
at 5 o'clock in the morning heard an
unexpected noise behind him and, turn
ing suddenly, saw Gipp walking toward
him. His face wore a bewildered ex
pression. His hands ran through his
hair and rubbed his eyes. His glance
swept the room wonderlngly, as one
never seen before.
The attendant gazed at him in won
der and fear, he was so like one risen
from the dead. The boy's eyes fixed
themselves upon the nurse's face, and
don't let anybody overcharge you sim- :
ply because you can afford to pay.
When the shave is completed Mr.
Rockefeller knows his daily income has
passed the $477 10 mark.
Then he breakfasts, breakfasts plain
ly on a chop and potatos, as plain, but '
better served, as those munched by his
thousand and one clerks.
If the morning is pleasant one or two
of his daughters accompany him on the
drive in Central Park. He goes a
bracing pace till 10 a. m., when he is off
he said in a low, hesitating tone, as
one unused to speech:
'â¢Where am I?"
The attendant made no reply, but
ran in search of Drs. Frost and Bow
errrtan. All three returned in a minute
and found Gipp walking about the
room, examining its contents with in
terest. The physicians led him to his
cot and seated him upon It.
"Do you know where you are?" a
doctor asked.
"No; but I guess I am sick," he re
plied.
"What is your name?"
Rubbing his head as if to refresh his
memory, Gipp looked at the doctors for
a few seconds and then replied, "Willie
Gipp."
"How old are you, Willie?"
"Why," he said, "I'm twenty."
He appeared to wonder why they
should ask him these things, and yet
he had difficulty in finding a reply.
He is twenty-three, but his mind had
taken up life some time before the
tragedy when he was twentyâ before
the sequence of events m his life was
broken by the brain lesion which made
him an insane matricide.
Again he dropped off to sleep. The
physicians issued orders that no- one
should disturb him or attempt to test
his memory further lest what nature
herself had done and the hope built
upon the momentary lifting of the
cloud be destroyed by untimely inter
ference.
But on January 10 the doctors
thought it well to admit the boy's anx
ious sister, Gussle, and she was al
lowed to go to his bedside. He lay
on hie back, staring at the ceiling, in
complete apathy.
"Willie!" the girl said, eagerly.
He looked at her, but in his eyes
there was no gleam of recognition.
"Don't you know me, Willie?" she
asked, brokenly.
He did not know her, and the fact
seemed to trouble him: He searched
her face long and sadly with question
ing eyes. Then he shook his head.
"I am your sister, Gussie," she said.
"I am your sister." he repeated, mo
notonously, as a child repeating part
of a lesson beyond its comprehension.
He could talk, but memory had fled
again. His father and brother came,
but he did not know them. To the rel
atives the physicians said they could
net decide for a week or more whether
there was a chance of permanent recov-
cry.
Medical men have been keenly inter
ested in the case. What puzzled them
most is the prolongation of the state
cf anesthesia, for it was their belief
that the boy would recover complete
consciousness or die in a few months.
Dr. William C. Krauss, an eminent
alienist, who has watched this case
with interest, said of it: "Gipp was
undoubtedly insane when he killed his
mother. It was a sudden seizure, prob
ably brought about by worry over the
interference he expected from his pa
rents in the marriage upon which he
proposed to enter.
"He passed from the violent state
into anesthesia, a condition usually
due to some injury or great shock. The
shock may have been a momentary re
alization of his crime. That would be
sufficient to throw him into the condi
tion in which he has existed ever since.
"I think it is questionable whether he
will ever recover control of his facul
ties, and he seems to be relapsing into
a state of coma once more."

Once seated at his office desic ha
plunges into work, the work of making
his giant income pile up faster.
At 1 o'clock he trots out to luncheon
and eats with a zest that shows he haa

might he, for his income has been
romping skyward the while.
Then comes more office work till 3:30
p. m., when the multi-millionaire is
helped on with his top coat aoid starts
to walk home if the weather is pleas
ant.
Dinner is announced at 7 o'clock. Not
a drop of any alcoholic liquid is served,
for the family is rigidly opposed to wina
and every sort of intoxicating drink.
Only a plain dinner is had, consisting
perhaps of oysters, soup, a roast, vege
tables and pudding, with coffee and
iced water.
It is 8 o'clock w-hen the family rise
and go into the drawing-room. There
are four pianos in the house, for Mr.
Rockefeller is fond of music, and no
one could charge him with extrava
gance even if he had a piano in every
room, and an organ, too. After his
daughters have played several classical
selections Mr. Rockefeller will take up
his violin. He is no mean performer,
though he makes no pretense of being
a finished musician, and before one is
aware of it the clock in the library has
tinkled 10 on its sweet cathedral
chimes. This is bedtime. The mem
bers of the household bid one another
an affectionate good-night and retire to
their several rooms.
Each year Rockefeller gives most
generously to the poor, to the cause of
education and so forth; dissipates
enormous sums in maintaining and im
proving his estates, enlarging his vast
business enterprises and so forth; yet
the golden stream rushes on, threaten
ing to encompass him, a veritable gla
cier, imperious, overawing omnipo
tent.
"God gives me wealth." he says.
Then he adds, 'Wealth does not bring
happiness, for many reasons." Then
men whose fortunes have been wrecked
to multiply Rockefeller's riches, the
crippled rivals, the poor deprived of
sustenance through mills, refineries
mines, railroads stilled by the power
of this one man, without title or
throne or scepter, smile grimly and
think of Midas and his fate.
WHAT
HAS
PHOTOGRAPHY
DONE?
Has photography accomplished any
thing? Yes, it has cheapened art
greatly. It has lowered the standard
with a public that instinctively pre
fers the sham and the machine made
and the microscopic; it has reduced the
artist to a demoralizing struggle with
the amateur simply to get his bread
and butter. In the beginning of the
century England was celebrated for
its beautifully illustrated books, in
which the greatest artists, engravers,
and printers collaborated to produce
a perfect whole. To-day the place of
these books has been taken by The
Strand Magazine and The Sketch,
thanks to the service of photography.
In the making of books, however, the
tendency has always been toward the
survival of the cheapest, and the
cheapestâ usually the newestâ has al
ways interested artists for a while,
though for other reasons than its
cheapness.
Steel engraving succumbed before
wood engraving and lithography, and
they, in turn, have succumbed to the
cheapness of the process man. In.
many ways, until lately, process was a
great advance upon any other form
of reproduction. Now, process- block
makers are mostly photographers, who
are killing each other in the race for
cheapness. Ido not want any one to
think I would imply that photography
is not useful to the ar?:st. On the
contrary, it is, and especially in illus
tration, since it preserves the illustra
tor's original design for him. It en
ables the architect to get, at small ex
pense and without the trouble of go
ing to see and draw them, bits, of de
tail in foreign lands, though this is a
questionable advantage. The world's
greatest architects managed very well
without it. One critic has said that
if photographers would turn their at
tention to the recording of historic
events like the Jubilee, .Â«r of vanishing
buildings, they could do an immense
service to art. In one way this is true;
in another it is not.
Surely this critic would be the last
to suggest that the cinematographic
"pictures"â the whole of them,
shown at the Empire, I think â are
equal to one picture of a procession by
Carpaccio, painted centuries before we
had any photographs. No doubt 22,000
artists would be required to secure as
many views of the Jubilee procession
as m ere obtained by the cinematograph
and their employment might have been
too much of a good thing. But if, say,
half a dozen accomplished artists had
been commissioned, and allowed to do
what they wanted, might we not have
had a record of some artistic impor
tance? As to the photographing of
old buildings, which would the archi
tect rather have, an etching by Pi
ranesi or a photograph by one of the
most revolutionary of the "Salon" pho
tographers? â Joseph Pennell, in Con
temporary Review.

they were none the less human beings.
You might have had some difficulty in
realizing this could you have seen them

hopeless, squalid dejection. And they
were bought, body and soul, for the
period of one year. The State sold them
to four contractors, who had mad.- the

SNAP-SHOT PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN OF A STEAM VESSEL SINKING AT SEA
Below are a set of pictures taken from snapshot phb
tographs of the foundering of a bis: ocean steamer. A
very interesting series of incidents led up to the taking
of the photographs, according to The Strand Magazine.
Here" is the whole story: The Osaka Steam Naviga
tion Company of Japan placed an order in England for
the construction of a passenger steamer of elegant lines
and high speed. This ship, afterward named the Tal-
Hoku. was built as Sir Railton Dfcksoa's yard at Mid-,
dlesborough, and engined by Kichardsons of Hartlepool.
In due time the vessel was ready to be handed over to
her owners; and accordingly she was provided with a
British captain and enough hands to take her over to
Antwerp, where she was to pick up a mixed cargo, con-
Fisting largely of cast-iron pipes. The Tai-Hoku was
also under orders to take up the remainder of her crew
at Antwerp. Altogether, there were forty-nine hands,
including Japanese, negroes, Belgians. Swedes and Ger
mansâa very mixed lot indeed.
The fifth day out from Antwerp was the on? on
which the disaster occurred. It was a Sunday, and a

It was not until nightfall that the

man was employed to check off the
names and keep the record of the con
victs as they were chosen by the con
tractors. This man was Alexander
Campbell, who is serving a life sen

pretty Mamie Joseph, at St. Augustine
several years ap:o. The tragedy was
one ,)f the most shockinp that has oc
curred in the history of the state, the
young pirl being pursued in the shrub
bery at her home and shot down.
Campbell pleaded insanity and he
saved his life to spend It in penal ser
vitude.
Finally the convicts were divided into
four lots, according to the choice of
their respective owners. And the next
day they were still further divided, as
they were apportioned off to the suh

THERE: are people in this world
who live and move and have
their being on stilts.
This is a whole community of
people, and not a community of
small boys, cither, moving about on
extra-lorig wooden I< ga for the fun of
the thing. They live seriously and ear
nestly, and go about their business in
town and suburb elevated on stilts. The
place of their living is in France, and
is called the Landesâ a bit of grim hu
mor, as there is not a particle of good
land anywhere about it. It consists
chiefly of vast prairies and marshes
covered principally with heath, furge,
â¢reed, bracken and broom, and varied
with clumps of sea pine, acacia, oak
and cork. The character of the country
is suc-h that the Inhabitants discovered
very early that they could get over it
and around it very much better on
stilts than they could afoot. Hence
their high life.
It is a strange sight to see the post
man advance to the door, towering
several feet above the proper height,
and gravely bearing the mail, and
walking calmly and without difficulty
over the gate post in his leaving, and
the peasant woman, her market bas
ket carefully stowed out of the way
and her stilts properly adjusted, goes
proudly down the streets in search of
cabbages and potatoes with perfect
ease and confidence. The shepherd,
high in the air on his long stilts, fol
lows his Hock in the same fashion;
the children go to school on stilts, and
the resin collector, as he passes suc
cessively from each pine forest, takes
his walk in the prevailing fashion. In
short, everyone goes about on stilts.
If a man, woman or child isn't on stilts
in Landes everybody turns around to
look at him or her as some sort of a
freak.
In Landes there are fashions in stilts
just the same as there are fashions in
shoes in the ordinary world. Generally
all are of equal length, so that no man
nor woman, walking along th*: streets
of Landes, can look down upon his fel
low, but the richest and the poorest
must be of the same height. This is
as it should be, for when one Landes
citizen meets another on the street or
afield he wants to meet him on the
level, even if it is high up in the air.
When on their native heath the long
stick carried by the stilter becomes a
third leg, fitting into the stilters back
and supporting him on a sort of trip<*3.
whilst with his disengaged hands he
rapidly knits one of the footless stock
ings peculiar to the Landes. These
fellows have great distances to cover;
hence the stilts. The bracken and
heather are often wet and the plains
swampy; hence, again, the stilts. The
sheep are often concealed among the
undergrowth; henceâ for the third time
â the stilts.
Naturally this daily life on stilts has
bred a sort of rivalry in stilt walking,
running and jumping, Just the same as
ordinary foot exercise in ordinary lands
has led" to six-day walking matches,
100-yard dashes and other kinds of ped
al athletics. Anyone who is a novice
in stick wear and the use of stilts has
no idea what a man or woman can ac
complish after spending several years
reaching over the earth with them.
Jack in his seven-league boots would
haw a hard job trying to keep up with
an indiarubber stilt expert trying to
get half a dozen refractory hogs into
a Landes pen.
In 1592 the first of the great annual
stilt races began. It has grown in
popularity ever since, till now the day
la an occasion for a grand fete, and
curious outside mortals as well as the
excited inhabitants of Landes travel far
and eagerly to see it. Men, women and
children take part in these races, di
vided into the three classes.
In the eventful and record race of
1892, which has been followed in out
line ever since the course for men was
from Bordeaux to Bayonne and Biar
ritz and back to Bordeaux (302 miles);
and for women, from Bordeaux to Ce
rons and back (37 miles). The first
prize in the big race was 1000 francs and
a silver-gilt medal; the second, 500
francs and a medal; and the third, 250
francs and a medal. To these must be
added any number of class medals and
money prizes offered by institutions
and clubs, and a vast quantity of mis
cellaneous goods offered by tradesmen
with an eye to advertisement.
The committee decided, first, that the
stilts might be as long or as short as
the competitor pleased. Second, he
might carry a stick, clothes, provisions,
repairing implements, or a change of
stilts. Third, he might dismount now
and then, but in such cases he must
carry his stilts, and must, moreover, be
mounted on them when he presented
himself at the "control posts."
There were control posts (generally
cafes or hotels) established at twenty
two villages en route, and each of these
stations was manned by cyclist volun
teers belonging to various great clubs.
These gentlemen received the stilters
as they passed through, taking signa
tures and recording times. Doctors
were in waiting at some of the control
posts, and there were also representa
tives of â¢first aid" societies to attend
to stilters with cut or swollen feet.
Owing to the gTeat number of entries.
It was arranged that each Landais
commune should elect Its champion and
pay his expenses right through. An ex
pense fund was, however, started later
on, so that each competitor was at least
sure of receiving his railway fare to
and from Bordeaux.
The interest taken in the race was
manifested by the great crowd, who not
only filled the streets, but also the bal
conies and windows of private houses,
cafes and hotels.
Here is an idea of the magnanimous
way in which shopkeepers offered
prizes: A tailor on the Cours d'Alsace-
Lorraine, announcing himself as a lover
of all sports, offered 'his finest suit of
clothes made to order." Other sar
torial artists followed suit until at
length it looked as though the peasants
from the Landes would all return home
in new clothes. The municipality of
Bordeaux contributed 100 francs and
two medals. One, Pelala, a merchant
of Bergerac, offered "twelve bottles of
my nourishing Anisette." A man at
Barsac would give a glass of Haut
Sauterne to each stilter, whom he would
not detain more than five seconds. A
bronze medal was offered to all com

the starting point, after having accom

The number of medals offered by va
rious bodies increased at quite an
alarming rate. There was one for the.
youngest stilter who accomplished the
journey in the specified time; and an
other for the oldest. There were med
als offered by various towns en route
for the first stilter to arrive there: and
there were medals for the champion of
the Departments of the Landes and Gi
ronde. .
One enterprising firm, not to be out
done, offered a prize of 50 francs for
the last stilter who should arrive at the
post before the closing of the race. The
keeper of the Anglo-American bar of
fered to each competitor "two excel
lent ham sandwiches." A private en
thusiast placed at the disposal of the
winner a gorgeously furnished flat,
with the use of bathroom and masseur.
Watchmakers, perfumers, bootmakers,
hatters, and, in short, tradesmen of all
kinds, sent along or promised speci
mens of their wares to the valiant stilt
ers.
There were in all eighty-one entries
and sixty-nine starters: thus twelve

terval between the first announcement
and the race, intending competitors
had gone into training. When at length
all competitors were marshaled in line
a pistol was fired, and the queer caval

ful Cours de l'lntendence, or Regent
street, of Bordeaux.
Although the men had bits of rubber

also sore and chafed feet. Every care
was taken of them, however. At Biar
ritz. Pierre Deycard of Rilos (the first
prize winner), was treated with an eau
de Cologne and brandy friction by the
head controller, who happened also to
be a doctor.
During the progress of the race there
â was but one question on the lips of the
Bordelais: Who will win? It was
doubtful all through. Dominique Rou
megoux of Ychoux held the lead for
a long time and was terribly anxious
to win, his master having promised
him, in that event. 100 francs over and
above everything else. On arriving at
Dax, Roumegoux had Â« noticeable fix
ity of expression, through lack of
sleep; whil> his immediate rivals,
Dugrand and Peyserre. arrived quite
gay, the latter dancing a pas seul on
his stilts, after signing at th*> control
post, and exchanging news with great
volubility and vivacity. Poor Jean
Cailliard, th^ oldest man who took part
in the race, was utterly done up when
NEW USE FOR THE BICYCLE.
The newest use of the bicycle is as a surveying machine. Not merely a ma
chine to carry a surveyor from point t.i point, but aa a mwrhlm which performs in
itself the mechanical part- of thÂ»- surveyor's work. Tht- United State* army is con
sidering the advisability of adopting this machine as an adjunct t<> tactics Hv
nie-an6 of an attachment the exact topographical characteristics of a road may be
ascertained, with no other exertion on the part of the surveyor except a ride along
the road in question. The rider may travel aa fast as be likes or as slow as he
likes, but when he has finished his trip, every gradient, hill or hotlow will have
been accurately marked off on a long strip of paper, which is part of the attach
ment in question. On thiÃ strip of paper the exact height of the hills and depth
of the hollows are indicated.
The Importance of the invention in military practice can be easily appreciated.
Hereafter a general contemplating a march can order his chief engineer to find
out the exact topography of a road over which the army is to pass. The engineer,
taking his wheel, can ride on ahead and return in a short time with an exact pro
file of the road so that every obstacle in the way of heavy ordnance or supply
wagons can be known and provided for lons before the troops even start on their
way. Or while the army is on the march the engineer can ride ahead and leave
his records at various stations alonp the road, his general thus being able to have
placed before him, en route, the exact description of the road ahead of him.
Under orders from General Gobin of the Third Brigade Pennsylvania militia,
a survey of the Voad around Hazelton, Perm., connecting all the camps and the
strategic points, was recently made. A method of rapid road sketching was
adopted, and 49.22 miles were surveyed by means of a bicycle equipped with a
cyclometer and a compass. It required nineteen hours to do this alone, and the
distances and directions were then drawn out on paper. The elevations were all
derived from barometric levels. This work occupied a great many hours, and yet
the 'survey was so quickly made a-Â« to establish a new record for rapid work.
The device is the invention of John Riddell. the mechanical export of Sche
nectady, N. Y. It is simple enough. It consists primarily of two parts, a cylin
der revolving mechanism to carry the strip of paper on which the record is made,
and a device to make the record. The cylinder revolving mechanism is a slender,
horizontal shaft. The cylinder is turned by means of a belt attached to the crank
axle of the bicycle. As the cylinder turns the strip of paper Is unrolled from a
spool. The marker, hanging by means of a pivot and controlled by a complemen
tary mechanism, adjusts itself to the position of the bicycle. When the bicycle
runs down a hill, the marker moves toward the lower edge of the paper strip.
when the bicycle mounts a hill, the pointer travels toward the upper side of the
paper. Naturally, the movements of the paper are in proportion to the size of thÂ«
prominence or declivity along which the bicyclist is moving". The paper on which
the record is made is marked off Â»in parallel, horizontal lines. The scale is gauged
so that every foot marked off on the paper represents 7fC feet of road. The ver
tical scale is 400 to one. so that if a hill shown on the paper strip Is one inch high,
the real hill of which the marking Is a miniature picture, is 400 inches high. It is
thus very easy to calculate the distance and height of every grade passed over.
he arrived at Orthez. 183 kilometers
from the starting point. He hustled
off to bed, poor chap, and went home
by the 4 o'clock train next day, weep
ing; over his fate.
There was a vast deal of excitement
in Bordeaux from day to flay during
the race. The offices of the daily pa
lters were besieged day and night by
a surging crowd, which eaeerly read
the telegrams and betted on the out
come.
Sometimes the stilts broke, al
though they were made of strong ash.
The men would then halt for repairs
and seize the opportunity of taking a
mealâ soup and fried eggs, perhaps,
with coffee and white wine. The whole
race was a triumphal progress for the
lucky Landais, who certainly never be
fore had had such a good time. First
arrivals at various control posts were
presented with bouquets. laurel
wreaths and more substantial tokens
in the shape of free rations and money.
Others frankly touted for contributions
in the towns, and made a grand thing
of it.
Lafont won a silver gilt medal and
500 francs, and Dugrand a medal and
250 francs, besides a substantial share
of miscellaneous prize money and
goods. Roumegoux, the Landais shep
herd who strove so earnestly to win,
received a consolation prize of a medal
and 125 francs. Lafont. at the close of
the race, sold his stilts (which ha
made himself, as they all do) to a shop
keeper on the Cours de l'lntendance.
Clearly the unsophisticated peasants
"knew something." At any rate, La
font had cove-red on his 112 kilometers
in sixteen hours. His number was
nineteen, and of courseâ like the rest â
he carried a book of rules for his guid
ance, as well as a map of the course.
Lafont is 28 years of age. He finished
the race on May 30 at 9:38 p. m., his
time being 108 hours 16 minutes.
Dugrand, Lafont's companion for the
greater part of the way, reached the
winning post at twenty minutes past
2 In the morning of the 31st (112 hours
fifty minutes). He arrived on his stilts
with a firm and rapid step. He was ac
companied by a crowd of cyclists and
pedestrians, who sang and cheered him
alternately.
Dubet had rather a bad fall through
the breaking of his left stilt when only
a few hundred meters from Villan
drant. He was delayed some time
making the necessary repairs.
Pierre Deycard of Bilos, commune of
Salles. department of the Gironde, the
first prize winner and champion, won
the most valuable of all the many
medals, besides 1000 francs and the
lion's share of the minor prize money
and gifts in kind. His number was
fifty-one and his age 31. He arrived
on May 30, at two minutes to 5 in the
evening, only a few hours ahead of La
font. His time whs 103 hours 36 min
utes, and his average 4 kilometers 938
meters an hour, including stops. His
progress was a veritable tour de force.
He was terribly anxious to win. His
short snatches of sleep were broken by
dreams, in which he seemed to be buy
ing cows with the prize money and set
tling down to married life with his
sweetheart. At St. Vincent de Terosse
he was followed by musicians, who
played "La Marseillaise" with so gr%at
an effect upon the crowd that one gave
him M francs, another 20, and so on.
At Dax he found great crowds waiting
for him. He was too fatigued to no
tice them, and had to ask his cycling
escort U) mar at him in order to keep
him awake. He even dozed on .his
stilts, still striding mechanically. Cam
phorated brandy frictions were tried,
to get rid of the cramp that threatened
him. Young girls came out to meet
him with laurel wreaths and bouquets,
and he was given a general triumph
and escorted home by his jubilant stilt
walking friends.
It was the greatest day in the history
of stilt walking. Landals and even the
stilt walking baker still talks about it
as he delivers the bread to the stilt
walking servant girl.
A MINISTER'S LIFE
IN
PIONEER TIMES.
By Rev. S. H- Willey.
RKV. S, H. WILLEY. for
many years past a resident of
San Francisco, was the first
Presbyterian clergyman to come
to this State. He was a passen-
ger on the steamer California
on her first trip up from the Isthmus,
and landed at Monterey, then the seat
of the Territorial Government, the
headquarters of a. detachment of the
regular army, and the most important
town on the coast, February 23, 1849.
Not many months after this he married
the charming sister-in-law of one of
the army officers, and for forty-eight
years the two have lived and labored
together. Retired from active service
now, they are spending the twilight of
their days in an ideally happy home.
An hour spent in their entertaining so
ciety gives one a very realistic idea of
California life fifty years ago, as it cen
tered about a clergyman and his fam
ily.
'When I came to Monterey," says
Mr. Willey, "there was no Protestant
church in all California, and do scnool
other than Mission instruction. I held
services in a hall with a small congre
gation, composed for the most part of
women, the wives of officers and sol
diers, and a few civilians. The gold
fever was of course very high, and the
soldiers gave their superiors a great
deal of trouble by deserting at every
opportunity and going to the mines.
Supplies were very costly, and the cir
culating medium was nuggets and
goose quills filled with gold dust.
"In September of that year (1849) the
Constitutional Convention to form the
State Constitution was convened in
Monterey, and the session lasted for
thirty days. I was chaplain of that
convention and took a great interest in
its work, the result of which endured
for thirty years.
"The capital being changed to San
Jose and the army post being moved to
Benicia caused a general exodus of the
English-speaking people from the
pretty little seaside town, which had
been so full of life and business, and I
came with others to San Francisco.
"This city was the busiest place
imaginable for the next few years. No
one had any time for anything but
money-making in some form or other,
and the population was composed of
excited crowds of strangers, constantly
changing as to personality, and inter
ested in each other only as means to
the desired end of financial success.
"In May, 1850, I started the Howard
Presbyterian Church in a building sit
uated on Natoma and Jane (now New
Montgomery) streets, in what was then
known as 'Happy Valley.' This was a
sort of an oasis, a pretty little resi
dence quarter in a setting of trees and
chaparral and grass, sheltered from the
winds, and separated from the business
portion of the town, by the immense
sand dune which extended from what
is now Haitcht street to beiow Second.
"The houses were what is known as
"knock-down' affairs, ihe frames being
made and accurately fitted in the East
and then sent out here in conveniently
portable form ready to be set up al
most as easily as children's block
houses. W. D. M. Howard, Captain
Folsom and Samuel Biannan were the
men who had them made and brought
here, and it was an excellent invest
ment for them, for, although they con
tained only seven small rooms, they
rented for $150 a month and were never
empty.
"One of the advantages of life in
Happy Valley was its immunity from
the disastrous fires which from time
to time swept over the other parts of
the city. The business portion of the
town was composed of flimsy wooden
buildings lined with cheese cloth, and
many tents, and a fire once started was
apt to run for blocks. Four or five
times the central part of the city was
burned completely over, at a loss of
hundreds of thousands of dollars, and
an alarm of fire struck terror to every
heart.
"I well remember the second Sunday
after our church was opened that just
as I had begun service the fire bells
started ringing and every man in my
congregation rose and went out, leav
ing me in the midst of my prayer. I
remember, too, that as soon as that
prayer was ended I left the church my
self and spent the rest of that day
fighting fire with ail my might.
â Gambling houses were a great fea
ture of the city at that time. Three
sides of Portsmouth square were <
bounded by such establishments, and 1
they were crowded day and night right '.
along. Miners and adventurers of all 1
kinds frequented them, and enormous !
sums of gold changed hands there con- 1
stantly.
"Much of my time was spent in local ]
hirme missionary work, for, plenty as
gold was, there were many cases of ac- :
tual distress. There were not a few
families whose breadwinners were at
the mines, and many sick, unfortunate
and disappointed persons who had no
friends to care for them. To search
these out was my special task, and I
am glad to say that I never lacked for
means to carry on this work. Those
who were prosperous were only more
than willing to give me funds to dis
tribute to the needy. They had no time
to attend to such things themselves,
but they had money in plenty, and they
gave it freely.
"Another part of my work was visit
ing the dying and burying the dead.
No matter how reckless and even wick
ed a man's life might have been if he
had any time in which to prepare for
death hfÂ» always wanted a clergyman
beside him at the last, and made a dy
ing request for Christian burial, and I
did my best at all times to carry out
their wishes. During the cholera vis
itation in the fall of 1866 my work in
this line was very onerous. A remark
able thing about that cholera season
was that the generality of San Fran
ciscans did not seem to be at all alarm
ed over it. They were too busy and
preoccupied to give the fact of its ex
istence fan their midst more than inci
dental attention, but many poor fellows
died of it and of the fevers which were
so prevalent during those years of ex
citement, personal carelessness and un
sanitary conditions.
"In 1850 the Protestant Orphan Asy
lum was started by Mrs. Dr. J. H.
Warren over in Happy Valley to care
for the children whose parents had died
in crossing the plains, and the institu
tion was well supported from the first.
People could afford to be generous
when the most incapable household
help commanded $20 a week and more.
"One peculiarity of a minister's life
in those days was that he had to attend
not only to spiritual but to material
matters. He had to take a leading and
practical part in the affairs of every
daylifeand was kept as busy in his own
way as the merchants and miners and
gamblers were in theirs. We took an
especial interest in politics, for the rea
son that the affairs of the city drifted
into the hands of the worst class in the
community because of the indifference
of the better class in regard to civic
matters. They 'hadn't time to attend to
anything but their own private busi
ness': that was the excuse of the mer
chants and solid men of the town, and
it was the clergymen's self-appointed
work to combat this state of things and
put matters on a better basis.
"There were seven or eight Protest
ant clergymen in San Francisco after
the first, and we all worked together in
perfect harmony for the moral, educa
tional and personal wellbeing of her
citizens.
"All the memories .of the unrestful
stir and confusion and feverish excite
ment which made the life of those ear
ly days are overshadowed by the mem
ory of the good deeds that were done,
the good institutions thai were founded
and the good spirit that prevailed
among the exponents of different
creeds, who met here on the broad plat
form of real love and true benevolence
to their fellow men."
The origin of the term 'â¢deadhead"
is thus accounted for in Leopold Wag
ner's volume on "The Significance of
Names":
"Fifty years ago the principal ave
nue of the city of Detroit (U. S. A.)
had a tollgate close to the Elmwood
Cemetery road. As the cemetery had
been laid out some time previous to
the construction of the plank road, it
was arranged that all funeral proces
sions should be allowed to pass alone:
the latter toll-free. One day, as I >r.
Rice, a well-known physician, stopped
to pay his toll, he said to the gate
keeper: 'Considering the benevolent
character of our profession, I think
you ought to let us pass free of
charge.'
" 'No, no, doctor,' replied the man.
'We can't afford that; you send too
WONDERFUL POWERS
OF A BABY SEERESS
Only three years and a half old and she makes strange predictions of
coming events.
LITTLE Winifred Cline of Chi
cago is one of the most remark
able babies of the age. Although
only three and a half years old
she is a psychic wonder, possess
ing powers of foretelling events
with an accuracy which is little less
than marvelous. Her prophecies have
been confined entirely to the home cir
cle, and it must not be imagined for
an instant that little Winifred is be
ing exploited as a public character. No
public exhibitions of her strange pow
ers have been made, nor are any likely
to be made.
She Is simply a little girl to whom the
mysteries of the future are as an open
book. During the late Presidential
campaign, |ays the Tribune, Winifred
employed her prophetic powers in pre
dicting the election of Major McKin
ley. Mr. Cline and Mr. McNally, his
father-in-law, were ardent supporters
of the cause that the majority sub
sequently decided to be mistaken. Like
all Bryanites, they felt and expressed
the utmost confidence that their can
didate would succeed. With the Cline
home full of unopposed Bryan argu
ment and prognostication, and Wini
fred never hearing any question made
as to the correctness of the statements,
it occasioned her family some little sur
prise when she took it upon herself to
champion the cause of McKinley.
"Mr. Bryan will not be elected," she
firmly asserted. "Mr. McKinley will
be the next President." They tried
to talk her out of the idea, but she
persisted in it resolutely. At the time
when she first made the statement she
was just completing her second year.
Mr. Cline's business not infrequently
calls him out of the city. During such
absences it is his habit to write to his
family at regular and frequent inter
vals. In one case not long ago the
letter was not received when It was
expected. Mrs. Cline was disposed to
be anxious, and told Mrs. McNally that
she could not understand why "Sam"
had not written. Mrs. McNally as
sured her daughter that pressure of
business was undoubtedly the cause of
Mr. Cline's failure to write the night
before, and expressed confidence that
they would hear from him the next
morning.
"But he wrote last night." objected
Winifred, who was listening.
The two ladies said that if he had
done so the letter would have reached
them with the first delivery in the
morning. The child refused to alter
her statement, whose truth was
proven in the letter received that af
ternoon. The writing had been done
on the previous evening, as was shown
in the letter. There had been a delay
in mailing.
On another occasion Winifred in
formed her grandmother that they
would go together that day to visit
Mrs. Charles Vail, an acquaintance of
the family. Mrs. McNally said the
visit would be impossible, as Mrs. Vail
had lately moved and had not yet told
Mrs. McNally her new address. This
did not disconcert Winifred in the
least. She did not say that she
thought she and her grandmother
would go to Mrs. Vail's; she was se
renely and unshakably sure of it. A
few minutes after the discussion, the
postman, on his morning round, de
livered a letter. The letter was from
Mrs. Vail, stating that she was set
tled in her new home and inviting
Mrs. McNally to bring Winifred to
spend with her the day on which the
letter was received. Acceptance of the
invitation verified the augury.
In general appearance Winifred Cline
is anything but the seer described by
tradition. She is plump, rosy and pret
ty â an image of perfect health. She
does not go into long trances or shut
herself off from the company of other
people. On the other hand, she is vast
ly interested in dolls, picture books and
the rest of the fixtures of a well-regu
lated child's life. Her predictions often
are made in the midst of play. She
will pause a moment, assume a serious
expression, deliver her statement and
continue her sport. The entire Inter
ruption seldom c-ccupies as much as
two minutes.
many deadheads through here as it
is. 1
"This story, as related by the doctor
himself to his friends the same even
ing, soon traveled far and wide, and
ever afterward those persons whose
occupations entitled them to travel
free on railroads, steamboats and
public vehicles, or to admittance to
places of amusement without charge,
received the name of 'deadheads.' "
W. A. Dougherty, secretary of the
Chicago branch of tho The-isophical So
ciety, after hearing a description ot
Winifred's performance, without hesi
tation declared her gifted with psychia
power.
"Such cases occur," said Mr. Dough*
erty. "where the subject meets exact
ly the necessary conditions, spiritual
and physical. The conditions require %
certain perfect harmony between a per-,
fectly sensitive spirit and a perfectly
healthy body." Mr. Dougherty had not
been informed of the child's exception*
al health. "When the gift is properly
cultivated it develops into a source of
almost indefinite power. 1\ the chilcl

THE WORLD
OF BOOKS
A CHAT ABOUT ANTHONY HOPE.
WHEN Rudolph Rassendyl be
came a being of modern fic
tion then the world knew that
it had a new novelist. At first
many pood people of literary
proclivities would not
"The Prisoner of Zenda" because
It was much talked about and, therein.
not a thing on which to waste time. But
finally they did read it. And then the
ambition of Mr. Hawkins to become a
great politician or a great lawyer was
destroyed. In fact. Anthony Hope Haw
kins, who had given George N. Curzon
Buch a hard fight for the place qf Mem
ber for the Southern Division of South
Bucks, disappeared and the world only
knew Anthony Hope.
America appreciated Anthony Hope be
fore England did; but that is hardly
â worth recording, for they are rather slow
of appreciation over there of late. An
thony Hope Hawkins is the son of a
clergyman of the Episcopalian church,
and his father used to keep school in one
of the London suburbs. Anthony was
brought up to look forward to the law
as his walk in life, and. after being at
an English public school and at Oxford,
duly followed out the course marked
down for him and was admitted to the
bar.
He did not have many clients, and In
one of the first cases he had, which was
a criminal case, his nervousness con
victed the whole batch of his clients.
Then he went in for politics and practiced
law "on the side." When he was IS years
oldâ that is. in ISS9â he first began to write
for publication. Why he wrote he him
self does not know, for when he offered
his book for publication he was still of
the idea that he was destined to make his
mark as a lawyer or a politician, or both,
and his principal literary food had been
"The Pilgrim's Progress." This book he
used to take to bed with him when he
was a child; and it shows the pow<>r that
is inherited in every one of rising above,
the influences of their youth, that he
should ever have been able, after such a
handicap, to write the "Prisoner of
Zenda."
When "Anthony Hope" was at the.
Marlborough school and at Oxford he was
a first-class football player. He- did not
stand high at the preparatory school, but
did pretty well at Oxford. His first book.
"A Man of Mark," he had to publish at
his own expense, and it was not a finan
cial success at the time. When fame
came to him, however, he republished the
book, and more than got square with the
world, financially, for its former lack of
appreciation.
In 1890 he published his second book,
"Father Stafford," which also fell flat at
the time and is now much admired. The
lack of financial success in the matter of
literature did not dautit Mr. Hawkins,
and he went to writing short stories. He
had lost money on his books and he did
not get rich on his short stories. In ISO 2
he published "Mr. Witt's Widow," and
that was his first success. But that was
not a glaring one. Then he wrote "A
Change of Air" and 'Half a Hero," and
finally "The Prisoner of Zenda."
After that he became a fixed star in
the literary firmament and has reluctant
ly given up the idea of being Lord Chan
cellor or Prime Minister except in such
kingdoms as Ruritania. After "The Pris
oner of Zenda." he wrote "The Dolly
Dialogue," "The God in the Car" and
"The Indiscretion of the Duchess." all of
which were well received. Mr. "Hope"
does not find time to do much reading,
but when he does read he prefers r.
and his favorite authors are George Mere
dith, Kipling and Stevenson. As to p -try.
he rarely reads it. and, still more won
derful, has never written any.
His work room, where he thinks and
writes. Is far away from his home, anil
. he goes to it every morning as a lawyer
would go to his office. His "den" is in an
old house at No. 16 Buckingham street,
London, and he reaches there every week
day at 9:45 and works until 4 or 5 in the
afternoon. He does not set himself any
fixed task for the day. but writes what
he feels in the best mood for, taking, as
he says, "anything 1 that the Lord sends."
He never rewrites, but corrects his manu
script carefully.
Mr. "Hope" received several offers to
lecture In America soon after the success
of "The Prisoner of Zenda," but kept
saying to his tempters, "I will go to the
States some day; there is plenty of time
for that." Now he has yielded, and Is
with us.

been absolutely descriptive. As he car- ]
rlea you back to the past days of tyr- '

good many time-honored beliefs and pre

Fisher with startling energy, but none
receives such a complete cudgeling as
the faith in the suffering meekness of the

WHAT A MAN CAN SEE IN A YEAR.
It is wonderful, when one comes to think of it. what a man mnv see in
a year. Given money and leisure, the modern facilities of travel will ena
ble a traveler to visit every important place on the round globe, and if he
times his tour well, to witness many strange and wonderful sights. It is
not every one, however, who has the pood fortune of Mr. Davis.
As a globe-trotting journalist, within the twelve months between May,
1806. and June, 1807. he attended the coronation of the Crar at Moscow, the
inauguration of President McKinlev at Washington, the millennium celebra
tion at Budapest in Hungary, and the Queen's Jubilee in London. He also
found time to pay a visit to Cuba, and to go through some exciting ex
periences with the soldiers of young Greece. Of all these things Mr. Davis
writes fluently, with the ease of a trained journalist, ami if he does not aim
at high literary effects, his style at any rate is much superior to the aver
age journalese to be met with in our daily papers and monthly maga
zines.
Then it must be remembered that Mr. Davis, in the first place, was
writing for ephemeral publication, dashing off pen and ink pictures on the spur of the moment, amid all the
hurry and excitement of the jrreat events which he was portraying. Considering the circum=tances the work
is wonderfully well done, and most of the sketches will doubtless be familiar to the general reader, as they
appeared at the time in Harper's and Scribner's magazines.
Perhaps one of the most vividly realistic scenes with which Mr. Davis presents us in the execution
of the patriot, Rodriguez, in Cuba. On a chill, misty morning they lead Rodriguez to the plains without the
city, and did him to death in the presence of .100 soldiers and many curious civilians.
Here we have an admirable sketch of the patriot as he stood waiting for the fatal volley â "he made a
picture of such pathetic helplesÂ«ne>s, but of such courage and dignity. that he reminded me on the instant of
that statue of Nathan Hale, which stands in the City Hall Park, above the roar of Broadway, and teaches a
lesson daily to the hurrying crowds of money-makers who pass beneath. The Cuban's arms were bound,
as are those of the statue, and he stood firmly, with his weight restinsr on his heels like a soldier on parade, and
with his face held up fearlessly, as is that of the statue. But there was this difference, that Rodriguez, while
probably as willing to give six lives for his country as was the American rebel, being only a peasant, did not
think to say so, and he will not. in consequence, live in bronze during the lives of many men, but will be re

GEOGRAPHICAL SMATTERINGS.
AUSTRALIA AND THE ISLANDS OF

Boston. New York and Chicago: Sil

This volume makes the eighth book of
"The World and Its People" series pub
lished in the Young Folks' Library, for
the young folks' educational develop
ment. It is, however, very doubtful
whether the growing mind has any rea
son to be grateful to authors and pub
lishers who cram it with this style of dry
and somewhat slipshod information. The
title of the book Is enough to suggest Its
careless construction, islands having a
natural affinity for the sea wherever they
happen to be located. Why the little con
tinent of Australia should be huddled to
gether with all the known Islands, from
the Faroes to the FriÂ»ndlies, from Hayti
to Tahiti, does not appear; apparently the
idea Is to "rush" the young person
through the less populated regions of the
circle, we are conscious of things strange
ly 'Hmiliar, not In the writings of his bi
ographers, but his own. Like many an
other author with irrepressible vitality,
Dickens has put himself into many of his
favorite creations; and the man who
romped with his children, took dancing
lessons from his daughters, played ath
letic games with his friends, spent hours
on Christmas eve in the toyshop, adored
his doss and his birds, fldeeted over
Christmas pudding decorations and organ
ized Now Year festivities, is the man we
have known and loved, under a dozen
guises, in the pages of the beloved 'Boz."
The book teems with recollections of hap
py childish days, family gatherings, con
vivial doings, merry jests, kindly actions
kindly sympathies, above and beyond all
an overpowering tenderness for the home
cjrele; if there is one thing Mamie Dick
ena more especially insists upon, it is her
fathers intense devotion to his children
his capacity for home life, his craving for
home appreciation, as man and as author.
Next in interest to the children came
the pets; there is one delightful anecdote
after another of dogs, cats and birds
among whirh Dickons' favorite tale of
"Of" the Newfoundland is perhaps the
most irresistible: "He came from Oxford

Of a truth this hath the genuine Dick
enslnn ring.
But there is one impression which the
authoress quite unintentionally leaves
upon the reader, that Dickens, with all
his home charms, must have frequently
heen a home nuisance. When not shut
up in his study or absent-minded at meals
he was figeting about in an appalling
manner. Home interest is all very well
but Dickens seems to have been a mas
culine Martha, troubled over many things
usually left to the cook and housekeeper
A man who must have his finger in ev.ry
pie, who worries over everything, from
the menu and the table decorations to his
daughters' bedrooms, who goes the morn

and taking evil note of dust and crumbs
this is the sort of man who would pro

hold; and the fact that Dickens' women
folk bore the burden joyfully speaks vol

spired.
The truth is Charles Dickens had not

his sympathies were all with the steady!

MY FATHER AS I RECALL HIM-By
Mamie Dickens. New York: E P
Dutton & Co.
JUBILEE POETRY.TO the philanthropy of the Hon.
O. N. Denny Oregon owes her
plentiful supply to-day of the
most beautiful and gamiest game
bird on the face of the earth.
From less than one hundred individuals
brought into the State in the early
eighties they have increased until their
numbers are beyond any estimate, and
they have spread out over the State
from the crcean beach to the summit of
the Cascade Mountains in such a man
ner as to shew that they are capable of
adapting themselves to widely different '
conditions of life. Like all new inno
vations, the Denny pheasant has found
a few willing to depreciate its value by
laying at its door accusations of de-
Etruetiveness to crops and orchards, be
sides the minor crime of whipping the
farm yard rooster, an accusation to
â which I am afraid he must plead
guilty, although the statement that he .
afterward espouses the whipped roos
ter's harem is without foundation.
Whether the introduction of the Den
ny pheasant is detrimental to the inter
ests f-f the farming community or not,
this article, founded on the writer's ac
quaintance with the bird almost daily
since its introduction into the State of
Oregon, is intended to show.
The Denny pheasant belongs to that
order of birds known as the "Gallina,"
â which order embraces all birds that
scratch the ground in search of food,
and it should be unnecessary to state
that the food of all such birds is largely
composed of insects, and the bird in
question is no exception to the rule, for
It is absolutely impossible to raise
young pheasants without a plentiful
supply of insect larvae of some kind,
and the mature birds are particularly
fond of grasshoppers and locusts.
By following the birds month after
month throughout the year their food
and general habits may best be shown.
January finds them seeking shelter
from the snow storms along edges of
the woods where the brambles are
thickest, scratching among the dead
leaves for grubs and beetles or eating
the berries of the wild rose and other
â¢wild species, perhaps, paying an occa
sional visit to near farm yards to
Scratch a few grains of wheat from the
chickens' feed.
At this time the sexes may be seen
together, but as February draws to a
close the hens become more timid and
are very seldom seen.
March is the mating season and the
males may be seen everywhere, bold
and def\ant as if proud of their gorge
ous plumage, which is now at its very
best.
The food is much the same as in Jan
uary, but by some it is claimed that, at
this period they pull up and eat the
growing grain: this may be true, but
they also consume many thousands of
cutworms and in that repay a hun
dred fold for the small damage that it
Is claimed they do.
The mating continues during April,
and at this time the males are most
pugnacious, fighting among themselves,
racing up and down the furrows and
crowing constantly.
In regard to this it may be well to
Btate how the experienced breeders
ha\v ff.und that the best results are
obtained when males are killed off un
til they reach the proportion of one
male to every three females.
Toward the end of April or in the
first part of May the nest is made by
tht- female. It is simply a depression
scratched in the ground and lined with
a few dead leaves, dry grass or fern,
always well hidden from the sight of
man and generally in some fence cor
ner or bush pile. Nests have been
found both earlier and later than May,
owing, no doubt, to the fact that all
birds are governed largely by climatic
conditions as to the time selected to
make their nests, and not by the calen
dar months established by man.
The number of eggs laid ranges from
fifteen to twenty, and the period of in
cubation is twenty-four days from the
time the last egg is laid to when the
hen leaves the nest with her brood. By
many it is claimed that two broods are
raised in a season, based on the fact
that young chicks have been seen very
late in the fall. In the opinion of the
writer but one brood is raised, the fact
of young chicks being found in the fall
being due to the first batch of eggs
having been destroyed by skunks, wea
sels, rats, crows, cats or man, all of
whom are inveterate enemies of the
pheasants at this period. The food in
early summer consists largely of in
sects, chiefly grasshoppers, locusts,
beetles, flies and worms, while the
young consume large quantities of
aphids. They are very fond of peas,
but the damage done is merely casual,
and, as to the assertion that they dam
age the orchards by flying through the
trees, knocking off the blossoms or
Iruit, It is entirely without foundation,
as everyone who knows anything about
pheasants (quail or grouse, sometimes
called pheasants in many localities, are
not referred to here) knows very well
that they always fly well over timber
or run through it, and their habit of
flying directly upward when flushed in
the timber has given rise to the term
"rocketing."
During the months of July and Aug
ust, while the grain is in the field, it
forms at least two-thirds of their food.
Fully half of the grain thus consumed
Is picked from the ground, and would
be a loss to the farmer in any event.
It has been often claimed that the
birds damage the standing grain by
running through it with wings spread
and thus knocking it down. This state
ment is too ridiculous to be worthy of
eerious consideration. Others state
that the birds light on the shocks of
Wheat and thrash out the grain with
their wings. This certainly does not
occur very often and may be easily ex
plained. The bird trying to perch
upon the shock finding an unstable
perch, he endeavors to gain his
equilibrium in the same manner
as does the farmyard rooster
on a loose fence rail, and
flaps his wings in so do
ing.
The case of the
Denny pheasant in
Oregon may be
summed up as
follows:
For ten

A HEW GAME BIRD FOR CALIFORNIA
PHEASANTS TO BE PLENTIFUL
Now that the State Fish and Game Commission is stocking the southern and middle part of Califor
nia with Chinese phoas:mts there is a likelihood that soon there will be a plentiful supply of these beauti
ful birds in all sections. While the importation of the Chinese pheasant into Northern California has not been
as successful as in Oregon, there is good reason to believe that in the new localities they will do better. The
talk about the birds becoming pests is untrue, as the accompanying article by Professor Bretherton will show.
Nor is there any danger of their increasing at "an alarming rate" here, as the long, dry summers of the in
terior are not so favorable to them as the more moist climate of Oregon. It is to be hoped that this last at
tempt at stocking will prove successful and so secure a plenty of game birds for the future.

itive benefit to .the farmer by de
stroying Injurious insects; for two
months he consumes the grain in about
the same proportion as does the do
mestic poultry, much of which would
be lost in any event.
To offset this depredation it should
be remembered that a full-grown Den
ny pheasant furnishes fully as good a
meal, if not better, in quantity and
quality, as does the average chicken
of the ordinary farm.
It is often asserted that the Denny
pheasant is driving out the native
grouse. This is not true. Before the

Oregon the native birds were steadily
decreasing as the country settled up.

HUNGRY JIM'S
GREAT SACRIFICE.
AWAY back in the early fifties Cal
ifornia was ruled by very little
law but a great deal of Justice.
To-day the conditions are re
versed, but in those stirring times,
a short shrift and a long rope
were the means to the end of m%ny a
man who. in the simple annals of his
far-away birthplace, was counted among
the "missing" forever after. Bulger's
Bar, on the upper Xuba, was no exception
t.. the generality of the primitive mining
camps in its administration of affairs.
Faro was winked at. but the theft of a
ham or a bag of beans was a crime de
manding a penalty V>f not less than > \
pulsion from the camp: the shooting down
of a human being, if there was but the
semblance of a cause, was but a mis
demeanor beside the rifling of a sluice box.
The logical successor of the wittena
gemote of the Anglo-Saxons, the vigilance
committee, was composed of the best citi
zens of the Bar, and at its head stood
Hank Dunn, the proprietor of the Red
Light saloon, and easily the leading citi
zen of the community.
Of late the committee had been some
what lax in the performance of its s>if
imposed duties. It is true that one un
fortunaie who had been discovered in the
possession of one more ace than the law
allows to any well-regulated deck of cards
had been escorted from the camp astride
of a very sharp rail, but capital punish
ment had not been Inflicted for upward
of six months. Meanwhile Red I><>g had
hung two men and Bulger's Bar had
begun to complain of the apathy of Us
vigilance committee which had thus al
lowed an inferior neighbor to gain .such
ascendancy in the eyes of the world. The
times were ripe for an uprising, and when
"Hungry" Jim. the most conspicuous
ne'er-do-well of the Bar. was caught red
handed in the act of stealing a can of
dust from the cabin of "Lucky" George,
it was felt, even in the air, that Bulger's
opportunity for self-assertion had arrived.
The committee was speedily summoned
to convene and the wretch was quickly
trk*d and condemned. Upon the adjourn
ment of the court, he was escorted in
sMlenee a quarter of mile down the canyon
to a large tree which had more than once
done its duty In the history of Bulger's
Bar. The rope was carefully adjusted
around "Hungry" Jims neck, the other
end thrown over an outstretched limb,
and twenty men grasped it while awaiting
a signal to pull.
"Now. Jim," said Hank Dunn, while a
hush fell on the assemblage, "you have
been accused of the worst crime in the
calendar o' Bulger's Bar; you have been
fairly tried by a iury of your peers and
found guilty; you have been sentenced and
the sentence is about to be executed If
you have anything to nay. say it now,
and may God have mercy on your soul "
Sometimes, in the presence of death, the
most worthless of beings acquires a dig

"Hungry" Jim know his time had come
and he did not qunver. He drew himself
up to his full height and spoke simply
"Friend?, for You have been my friends
I know the law and I shall not beg- for
mercy. Since I've bf-on in .this camn
perhap I've been shiftless, perhaps PvÂ«
been worthless, as some of you have
intimated to-day. I prefer *to tell
the plain truth and say I've h*-Â«Â»u

make no other excuse, for
I have none. If it were

However, I presume I

you may do your duty.
Good -by, friends, and may you
never regret your act of to-day"
He was sil<-nt and every hand on
the rope tightened its prrasp in the
expectation of a word from Hank
Dunn. But at this instant, a tall.
broad-shouldered man pushed his way
through the little crowd and stood
beside the condemned criminal. II
was John Harper, better known in the
community as Yankee" John. He had
not been a resident of Bulgers more than
WONDERFUL POSSIBILITIES OF A NEW WILD OLIVE.
IT is a pity about Noah's dove. If
she had only waited until this
century and come to L,os Angeles
County she might have had all the
wild olive she wanted instead of
one measly little sprig. If she had
taken a fly over Antelope Valley she
would have found hundreds of olive
bushes scattered in shady places. But
as it is, in default of her being here.
Dr. A. Davidson of this city, in com

owns land in the district, made the
discovery which may now lead to the
finest olive production that this State
has yet known.

six months, and was taciturn to a fault,
but on more than one occasion he had
not hesitated to vigorously condemn what
he termed the "lawless methods" of vig
ilance committees. It was generally con
sidered by many of Bulgers' best citizens
that he was too outspoken in his denun
ciation of what they deemed to be their
bounden duty, but he had come to be
known as an uncompromisingly honest
and upright man. and their respect for
his virtues had hitherto deterred them
from doing what many thought neces
sary, namely, teaching him a needed les
son. In fact, they had hurried the prep
arations for "Hungry" Jim's execution
because they knew Harper had gone to
Marysville, and while they did not fear
any active opposition on his part to such
a procedure (some of them even thinking
from his peaceable ways that he was
lacking in courage), yet they had no de
sire to needlessly offend him. But he
had unexpectedly returned that after
noon and now stood before them, white
and stern in his anger.
"Are you savages that you would not
grant to the meanest criminal that mercy
that everyone of you would beg for in his
position?" he cried in indignant tones.
"Would you take a human life in pay
ment for the petty crime that this man
has committed?"
"It ain't no petty crime," said Hank
Dunn, sullenly.
"No, it ain't," shouted a dozen voices.
"It is petty compared with the penalty
you would inflict,' said Harper. "I have
not lived long among you, it is true, and
God grant I may never hold my residence
here long enough to be as lost to reason
and humanity as are you. 1 come from
a State where in obedience to the divine
law, a life is demanded -for a life, but
not for a lesser consideration. Such acts
as you men contemplate doing to-day are
in contravention of human rights and in
mockery of Justice. ,This execution shall
not proceed."
"You ain't got nothin' to say about it,"
shouted Hank Dunn. "String him* up,
boys."
Then the sleeping lion became, aroused.
John Harper pulled a navy revolver and
aimed it directly at the line of men whose
hands were on the rope. â¢
"Pull that rope one inch and I pull the
trigger." he cried.
A half-dozen revolvers leaped into the
air: but another (orm. lean and wiry, had
gained the center of the mob, and stood
beside Harper. It Vas Bill Griggs, the
nerviest faro-dealer on the Yuba.
"By God! I'm with you, Yank! I admire
your pluck!" he cried. He had a der
ringer in each hand, and as he looked
around at the angry men he continued,
in a cooler and more even tone: "See
here, men. you all know Bill (iritis.
There ain't a man here but has won
money from me. and you know the mean
est check guerrilla on the Yuba couldn't
never steal a copper from any of you
while 1 was dealin' bank or looktn' out.
You're all friends of mine, but I believe
â¢Yankee' John is right, and I'm goin" to
stand by him. Give this cuss one more
chance, for I believe he'll be honest.
Yank and I will keep cases on him. and
If any man here ever loses a cent by
him I'll not only give a stack of reds
for every splitter he steals but 111 be
the first "man to pull the rope o.n that
occasion, Is that fair?"
There were still same muttered
remarks indicative of disappoint
ment and disgust: but when
"Lucky George announced that he
was satisfied. Hank Dunn was
forced to give in and order the
criminal released. Thus did Bul
ger's Bar lose its chance of re
gaining its lost prestige, and many
and deep were the consolatory
potations served in the Red
Light that night.
"Hungry" Jim walked back
to the camp at the heels of
John Harper, who said not
a word until the two were
cafe inside his little cab-
In. Then he turned to
the man who had been
rescued from the val
ley of the shadow of
death.
"See here, Jim, '
I'm a man of
few words." he
said sternly.
"You will
never hear
me brag
over any
t h.i n g I
have done
to-day, nor
will I ever re
mind you of any
Indebtedness you
may owe me on
account of It- I
shall only expect you
to be honest for the
future. I feel a sort of
responsibility for your be
ing on earth, though, and
I will give you something
to do. I need help on my
claim. You may go to work
in the morning at regular
â¢wages, and you may have one
end of this cabin to live in. That
Is all."
From that' day "Hungry" Jim was
a changed man. He toiled in Har
per's claim early and late, and proved
himself fully worthy of his hire. There
seemed to be no task too difficult, no
labors too onerous for him to undertake.
Gradually he lost his hungry, shiftless
look and an appearance of respectability
settled upon his face and figure. He was
a handy man about camp, and many
were the odd Jobs- he din for his erst
while would-be iynchÂ«*rf>. steadfastly re
fusing remuneration for his services, and
the leading citizens began to conclude
that, after all, he did have some good
qualities.
Between his employer and him spoken
words were few and far between. Ono
was naturally reticent and the other re
spected his silence. â¢ But a bond of friend
ship grew Up between them, which was
cemented ' still closer by Harper's illness,
which came a few months later. For four
weeks he tossed between life and death
in a slow, wasting fever. The miners,
rough, but tender-hearted, performed
such little services as they could: but
Jim was a whole hospital. He developed
unexpected qualities, both as a physician
and a nurse. Day and night, without re
moving his clothes, he watched by the
bedside, and finally when the crisis was
past and John was recovering strength,
the congratulatory miners told him that
even as Jim owed his existence to him,
he owed his life to Jim.
Harper called Jim to him one day and
endeavored to express his gratitude.
"You know, Jim, I'm not a man to say
Pouthfm Pacific lies an uninterrupted
track over the smooth Stretch toward
San Francisco. Toward the southern
edge the flat ground has been caught
up and huddled into bumpy little
mountain ridges that organize creeks
to water^he valley. Here, at an ele

frequent, Dr. Davidson stumbled upon
a modest shrub that boasts of nothing
big except its technical name.

learned doctor calls it â that is. he is
willing to call it so if you wish to
know, although his discourse is us

rovnd scientists in this part of the
State. The bush is not commonly
more than six feet high, although it
now and then reaches as much as

much," he said with* a fond look, "but
I owe my life to you, and from this time
on, you are a full partner in my claim.
That is all I can do."
"Nonsense," responded Jim, huskily. "I
only did what was right, for I owed you
more than 1 could ever pay. You took
your life in your hands when you saved
me; what I did was easy."
"Don't magnify my little act so great
ly," said Harper. "If you will have It
so, we will call ourselves square now, but
you must take half the claim."
Jim protested and muttered that they
were not square yet by a long shot, but
Harper's was the stronger nature and
Jim finally consented with a mental reser
vation that Harper should lose nothing by
his generosity.
"Why, Jim, the boys have been telling
me all about you," continued Harper in
grateful tones. "You've been as kind and
tender and careful as any woman could
be â that Is, any woman except one. Ah
Jim, I've never mentioned her to you nor
to any one else, but I feel like talking
about her to-day.
"Is she your wife?" asked Jim, softly
"No," responded Harper, with a deep
sign that told of the suffering within
"Perhaps she never will be, but we liv*. "

ness of each other's love. She Is
married, or at least, she was
married, but wheher her hus

knows. I don't think there
ever was much love be
tween them, and six years
ago he deserted her for

after, and she had a

John paused, and as his musings took
shape, the li^M of love and hope in ins
eyes vied with the bright rays of the
spring sun that came creeping through
the window pane.
"I never knew her husband," he con
tinued. "I first met hÂ«T when she < ame
to our little town in the East in search
of a location. She has considerable mus
ical talent and soon found pupils enough
to keep her from want. Sh<> was surh a
bright, self-reliant woman and withal so
tender, so pretty and so sweet that I
could no more resist loving her than I
could resist the warmth of the sun. I
thought she was a widow, and only
learned the truth when I asked her to
marry me. She could not conceal her
love for me. but I then learned of her
husband and knew my cause was hope
less."
"Why didn't she get a divorce?" inter
"Of course I could not stay there after
that, so I came to California with the
next party from my vicinity. Some flay
we may be happy together. T'ntil that
time we can only hope and love with a
love that will last until eternity."
He turned on his side and was silent.
He had mentioned no twmi>s and Jim
asked no further confidence, but stole
quietly from the cabin.
Harper was out of bed In a few days
and rapidly gained strength in the warm,
life-giving California sunshine. .Tim
worked harder than usual, and the added
dignity of partnership In a good claim
gave him such importance in the eyes of
the community that he was beginning to
be recognized as one of Bulger's leading
citizens. Although ho traded no longer
with Hank Punn, even that worthy was
one day constrained to observe that
"John Harper and Bill Griggs nev^r done
a better day's work in their lives than
when they stopped that lynching, even if
Red Dog did thereby get the laugh on
Bulgers. 1 '

Harper went to Marysvflle. expecting to
return a couple of days later. On the ev
ening of his departure. Jim was potter
ing around the cabin engaged in the pre
paration for his supper and accidentally
knocked a tin can from the table. As it
clattered to the floor, a letter fell out. It
half protruded from the envelope and as
he stooped to pick it up he caught a
glimpse of the date line. For several
minutes he hesitated, with the letter in
twenty feet under favorable condi
tions. It is a dwarf even to its fruit,
but a sturdy little native for all that,
and if it can be brought to infuse
some of its vigor into its cultivated
cousin then will California produce
such oil and pickles as will make an
epicure's mouth water.
The plant puts forth a leaf smoothly
elliptical like the orchard-grown olive,
but hardly more than half an inch
long. The blossom that appears is an
insignificant greenish affair, unassert

amount to much anyway and had no
excuse for forcing itself. True enough.
The fruit is as small as a peaâ similar
to the haw in appearance. It grows
thick on the branch, but it is appar
ently as useless a little specimen as
ever lived, being almost all seed and
skin. The color is a dark pl^m shade,

"Your wife!" How blissful
and sweet the words sound.
Well, perhaps they may be

God speed the time. I

P. S.â l am getting along famously with
my classes, and I enclose my latest card.
You see, I am quite business like.
At the conclusion of the reading, Jim
mechanically picked the card from the
floor where it had fallen and read:
MRS. J. H. WESTON,
Teacher of Vocal and Instrumental Music.
Then he walked outside and gazed for a
long time at the stars that were beginning
to peep out in the blue sky. Finally, he
walked inside, wrote a long letter to. Har

Sased, Harper turned and saw the letter
which he had read through, while for the
first time in years tears rolled down his
cheeks. "
Then he went to Hank Dunns and call

them a long story, concluding with the
information that immediately after Jims
funeral he intended to go East. He kept
his word, and Bulger's Bar saw him no
more, but for many months the leading
citizt'ns took ail their visitors to the lit

eye of genius, thought he had good
reasons for believing that it deserved
a better fate than to be fed to the bird.;
and it was therefore carefully planted
and tenderly watched all through that
New England summer of 1874 â and
millions of his fellow men have the
benefits wrought by the prescience of
a youthful enthusiast then on the
threshold of renown in his chosen field
of science.
When the hazy Indian summer came
the plant had done its work, and three
and one-fourth pounds of the most
beautiful white potatoes which had
ever been seen were the product of the
little seed.
The tubers were planted and replant
ed, and when the second season had
passed two tons was the crop which a
prominent Eastern seedsman pur
chased and introduced to the public in
the spring of 1876.
The new potato was such an evident
improvement upon any tuber of its
kind ever known theretofore that it
immediately sprang into favor in all
parts of America, and it was not long
ere its superior qualities became
known in all other countries where the
potato is grown.
Such is the genesis of the Burbank;
potato â named in honor of its origina
tor, Luther Burbank of Santa Rosa.
The young New Englander who mad<Â»
this fortunate experiment so many
years ago has since become famous
among the world's savants in the aama
line of scientific experiment. Many
times has he thrilled the scientists of
the vegetable world by the announce
ment of a new and distinct speciesâ*
the creation of such being the principal
aim of his professional life â and rich,
have been the honors showered upon,
him by his fellow scientists and tha
world at large for his brilliant achieve
ments in the propagation of new
fruits, flowers and vegetables, but it
is safe to say that no product of hi 3
genius has wrought so much of ma
terial good to Christendom as has thu
potato, which bears his name.
More than two hundred million
bushels of the Burbank potato are now
grown every year, and by a most care
ful and conservative estimate, made
from reliable statistics, the amount of
this variety which has been grown,
since its introduction is considerably
more than two billion seven hundred
million bushels, or one hundred and
sixty-two trillion pounds â enough to
give every inhabitant of this eartli
nearly two bushels.
From the figures quoted above it will
be seen that enough Burbank potatoes
have been produced (counting one
pound laid lengthwise to measure one
foot) to reach twelve hundred and
twenty-seven times around the worlfl,
and more than one hundred and twenty
times the distance to the moon.
The price paid the young propagator
for this potato, which is yet in its prime
and which has added to the wealth of
all nations and will doubtless augment
the wealth of nations yet unborn, was
Sir.o. The reader may ponder the con
sequences to the race if T>y careless
ness or ignorance this little seed had
been lost or destroyed.
Mr. Burbank now handles, nearly
every day, seeds as precious in poten
tialities as was the subject of this
sketch â seeds which hold within them
selves forces calculated to stray tha
destinies of mankind and even to af
fect the weal of nations.

THE COUNTRY COUSIN.
"AVt.-11, I hear*! something just terrible
about your friend, Mrs. Gay one." said
the Country Cousin, as she came in from
a "tea" and sat down opposite the So
ciety Matron.
"Oh, what was it. Cousin Prue? Do
tell me all you heard. I knew it was the.
mistake of my life to stay at home to
ds y. but 1 wouldn't have gone for the
world In such a subdued hat as my mil
liner' sent me. 1 just telephoned and
asked her if she thought 1 would wear a
bat composed of two shades of one color.
when everybody else is wearing three or
four shades of all the colors. But what
about Mrs. Cayone?"
"I've a food mind to tell the poor
Woman." said the Country Cousin,
"and Rive her r chanco to "refute the
slander. I declare it's terrible the way
people talk in society."
"Now, Cousin Prue, don't abuse society.
Children cry for it. debutantes cater to it,
old maids cling to it. mothers adore it,
arid sons don't abhor itâ no matter what
they may tell you. 1 assure you. But.
before l die of curiosity, what did you
hear cf Mrs. Gay one?"
"T heard." said the Country Cousin, Jn
a carefully lowered tone, "that she
smoked cigarettes and had cocktails
s. r\. d before dinner."
"Oh. is that all? " said the Society Mat
ron, and the Country Cousin wondered if
she were disappointed. "Well, Cousin
Prue." she added, brightening up. "you
know I'm a thorough bohemlan, too."
"A Bohemian!" exclaimed the country
Cousin. "There isn't a drop of that vag
abond blood In the W%OlÂ« family. What
are you talking about? You're an Ameri
can through and through."
"But bohemlan In my ideas, actions and
tastes," added the Society Matron.
"And what's bohemian In your taste?"
asked the Country cousin. "Anything
like sugar in your tea or noodles in your
;â ""
"It's to be free and easy." explained the
â¢y Matron, "artistic, careless, re
gardless of conventionality, with no
thought of the morrow. happy and poorâ"
"Noodles in the soup, then." said the
Count ry Cousin. "I suppose a bohemian
would talk smug."
"It's the thiriw to be nowadays," said
the Bociety Matron. "1M m* roll you a
cigarette, and as you lie back and blow
the smoke in the air you can imagine
yourself rich, famous, beloved and_ the
muses will hover within your reach."
"Enough!" cried the Country Cousin.
"If that's bohemianisnr it isn't the thing
| for Prudi nee Verdure."
"But it isn't entirely necessary to
smoke." said the Society Matron, putting
away her cigarette case. "If you really
want to be bohÂ»-mtan. you can follow
many different paths, and tlnd that you
will "r.ach the goal, as we all have.'
"Well, tell me the strjtlghtest path,
said the Country Cousin.
"Picturesque nttire is a step in the right
direction." began the Bociety Matron.
"Wear your hat a little to one side:
sometimes it takes me a half an hour to
get mine at the proper angle. A velveteen
jacket Is also conducive to the coveted er
and a neglige shirt and a cravat,
a carelessly tied cravat; why I've seen
Mrs. Gayone do hers over and over fully
twenty tirtr-s.
"You musi nee my studio, when it is all
finished. Cousin Prue." she continued, af
t. r â  pause. "It's way up in the attic
ai d you'll have to climb a dirty flight
of stairs to p^t there, but you won't mind
that. It will be, the true thing when once
r.ached."
"What do yon mean by 'way up in the
attic?" asked the Country cousin. "Tour
attic is only just above your bedroom."
"That's so," assented the Society Mat
ron, reluctantly.
"And can't you have your stairs
swept"" added the Country Cousin.
â¢â I could." said the Society Matron, "but
I can't bother about household matters.
I'm as free as a bird. I can't b conven
tional: dirt roesn't affect me. or. in fact,
any of the mat. rial cares of life."

that's part of it."
"It is." said the Society Matron with
dignity, which was somewhat broken by
a yawn. "Excuse me." she said, "I

some weeks, and I'm beginning to feel j
"Well. T call that downright dlssi
p.-ued." said the Country Cousin.
"Oh. we turn nipht into day." said th*Â»
Society Matron. "The owl is our em
blem. I have one in my studio and It
will make the Bohemian Club men feel ,
so at home. They just come and gaze at
that owl."
"I don't think owls are near as pretty
ns peacocks," said the Country Cousin.
"Why don't you have a peacock for your
emblem?"
"Oh, but peacorks nre such silly things."
said the Society Matron. "( iwls are wise,
and they love the night. It's a short life
we have to live and we must make it a

the tea myself and cut the bread and

as bohemian as It can be. A studio does j

I'm going to give a bohemian lunch. I :
went to one Monday, and I'll never be |

just lovely. Cousin Prue. They had oil- !
cloth on the table and the queerest things !
to eatâ sandwiches, and crab legs, and j
shrimps, and beer in big mugs, and paper I
napkins. It was simply perfect."
â¢â¢But last week you were raving over
pink lunches, and green lunches, and
yellow lunches." suid the Country Cousin,
"with subdued lights, and cut glass, and
elegant damask, and liqueurs. and terrapin j
andâ"
â¢â¢{'gh." said the Society Matron, with a '
shudder. "How could' I ever have been I
so commonplace? You must come to my
bohemian lunch, and Bee how inspiring
it is. I have bought some awfully pretty
easels. On one is a canvas with a lot of
purple pansies strewed carelessly on a
table. I have a friend who did the table
for mo. On another easel is a bunch of
pansies in a big yellow bowl. The same !
friend did the bowl. He's so versatile.
On the third rasel is a life-like represen

A "HAND HARNESS" MADE OF GEMS.
WHEN* the dictate apninpt gloves went forth, the new "harness" for the
hand was evolved from some brilliant brain, and it is the ultimate bar
barism. It isn't really so badâ it's not even expensive for those who al
ready own gems, set or unset; but the jeweled tfarness is the thing to wear
when bare-handed at the theater.
This is what it is lik.: On every finger is worn a ring, with emeralds, rubies, dia
rponiks and any Â«ther stone th~t happens to belong to the fortunate owner. Even the
thumb has a ring, and all thjse on the fingers are joined together like the old-fash
ioned brass knuekk-.
From each ring there runs a fine gold chain that connects it with the large tur
quoise ornament in the center of the back of the hand, and then the chain runs along
through this jewel, which la set around with large diamonds, something- like a
brooch, and connected with the bracelet beyond on the wrist.
It completely covers the hands and forms a biasing armor that will flash and
dazzle the eyes in the pit when the hands are raised in applause in the box. You
would think the stars had dropped down from the sky and consented to do duty
a while, when you behold this ornament in all its magnificence.
The harness, when finished and adjusted, resembles nothing so much as a glove.
the delicate short chains torming the stitching. Some women want the harness for
only one hand, claiming it is in better taste, though both hands may be encased in
this golden chain armor if there are jewels enough in the family safe deposit vault
to ten around.
There is another design for the newest new in jewelry, and that Is made by run
ning the spun gilt chains from each ring- down the back of the hand to the wrist, and
there attaching it to the bracelet. When this style is adopwd the chain is set with
round semi-precious stones, the topaz, garnet, carbuncle amrsome others forming a
rope or twist where every color of the rainbow is to be found.
The triple rings that go with this affair are curiosities in themselves. They are
evidently made In this shape in order to facilitate the donning of this somewhat
complicated bit of daintiness. That is. it is complicated when the harness is off the
hand and lying in its purple satin nest.
The greater display of glittring stones the better every well-regulated girl likes
it, and in the harness t.here is immense latitude in the matter of preference for cer
tain gems and the way gems are set. The designs can be multiplied indefinitely al
most, and in the invention of the harness there is ample room for individual choice
and originality.
For those who please, there may be added to this already glorious vision of splen
dor "gold caps" for the finger tips. These are shaped something like a thimble and
are closely set with emeralds and diamonds and all the rest of the list
They can. as well as the bracelet below, be joined to the rings with chains That

Cousin Prue. you've, no idea how hard it
is; but my teacher does the turns. Then
I have a lot of canvases standing all
around, with their faces to the wall. You
see, there's nothing on them yet: but the
effect is elegant. Well, then everybodj
arrivesâ a jolly crowdâ journalists, paint
ers, musicians; and it's very free and
easy, and formality is unknown. You
must have a few art phrases pat, and
talk of technique, and chiaroscuro, and
tone, and detail, and color. It always
sounds well, and you'll find that it's as
easy as pie to get along. Then somebody
will sing. Bohemians always sing. The
song will have plenty of color, though it
may be a little off: and there will be .
jolly chorus, in which everybody joins,
and "
"Gracious me!" said the Country Cousin,
interrupting her. "It sounds terrible.
What next?"
'â I don't know," said the Society Ma
tron. "I'm somewhat hampered by do
mestic ties, andâ"
"Stop!" cried the Country Cousin. "I'll
hear no more. It's shocking to hear you
talk like that."
"Well," said the Society Matron, as she
glanced at a card brought her by a neat
maid, "I won't shock you any more to
day. I would say I was out. Cousin Prue,
and not have your visit interrupted, but
this is an engagement I made to have a
background painted for my next pansy
scheme. Will you excuse me. and do

And the Country Cousin promised.
J. K.LATEST NOVELTIES IN FASHIONS FROM PARIS
HTAiK is a description of a pretty
and graceful indoor dress mad
Savoye. It is of sky blue
vet. The skirt is rather long and
is close fitting like a fourreau in
the upper part. Down the center of
the apr-n, from top to bottom, is a
band of wide Valenciennes lace, edged
on each side with a string of Imitation
pearls. The skirt is cut in very nar
row breadths at the top, and each
breadth is edged with a n.w of pearls.
Round the front and sides, just below
the waist, are three chevrons, com
posed of roll pleats, which extern
beneath the hips. Tho corsage is high
necked, a blouse in b!
down the center with insertion in the
same style as the skirt, and lik- it,
edged with imitation pearls on â¢ l( b
side.
A row of pearls also run down to the
waist. On the left Bhoulder is a oo
quille of Valenciennes, which falls half
way down the corsage in a frill. In
the center of this trimming is a larKt
bow of maize taffetas ribbon, which
ribbon is continued down to the waist
and forms a waistband, rather narrow
and round. The neck trimming is of
Valenciennes lace over white satin, and
surmounted by a fur collar. The si
composed of broad Valenciennes
insertion over white satin, and each
band separated by a string of imitation
pearls. The epaulets are of Valen
ciennes lace, and beneath each is a
pendant composed of five sable tails.
Although this pretty dress is high in
the neck it can be worn at a small din
ner party. Here is a description of an
other, which is very convenient for this
style of dress and has the advantage
i C b( Ing â¢ aailv made. The skirt is of
plain bia'k Qeur de velours or moire,
with n corsage of black Bpangled tulle,
slightly open in front and very slight
ly draped. The front is ornament
each side with spangles in curves,
somewhat resembling the shape of a
bolero. Beneath the black tulle at the
neck of the cordage is another layer of
colored tulle that ran b^ seen through.
The , c leeves are inÃde with lezes of
black spangled tulle, showing tho arm
through; the effect of the dress Is
heightened by a waistband of colored
niolro or satin to match the tulle.
The princ-esse shape 1b much adopted
for this form of dress, very much tuk'-n
in, in the style in vogue twenty-five or
thirty years ago. Trimmings of em
broidery, fur or braid are used, but the
fit is quite tight. I have seen a num
ber which were of princess shape be
hind only, and the corsage made with
lapels, or else a blouse or bolero.
Another pretty costume by the same
firm is a tea & , earl gray china
crape, over a white satin ground. The
r-kirt is long all round and forma a
short, train, and ia edged with fur. A
second row of fur is laid on above the
border, and encircles a series Of designs
embroidered in white floss silk, which
are repeated on each breadth all round
the skirt, above the two bands of sable.
The front opens over a wide apron of
white mousseline de sole, beneath
which is a ground of white satin. This
apron is made in small pleats set in
vertically and edged with thread lace
insertion. On each si do of the apron is
a flounce of Kngiish application lace.
forming a cascade and turning round
the dress at the bottom, where it faJls
over the underskirt of white satin.
The neck is trimmed with a frill of the
same lace, which appears as if f^p-ened
on the left side by a bow of cerise taffet
aÃ. The shoulders are covered by a
large collar of Venice guipure in high
relief, edged with a narrow bnnd of
sable and forming epaulets. The neck
trimming in a narrow band of fur which
J**aves the head perfectly free. The
res are straight and tight; they are
; composed of small pleats of white
-eline de soie, in circles round the
arms, each edged with live rows of
thread lace insertion. At the shoulders
arc maneherons of pearl gray china
crape edeed with fur. The corsage is
a kind of blouse, fastened at the waist
with a band of cerise taffetas, which
runs beneath the lace frill and reap
in the center in rr\n:t. This waist
is fastened by a bow of the same
material, with long ends.
In this establishment I have
some short vests resembling to
extent what are known as coiffeusi
matinees, but more dressy and better
fitting. .These are made in tine linen.
Tea jackets are now faking the place
of tea gowns. They are embroidered
velvet or velvet embroidered with gold,
of satin nr damask, trimmed with fur
fare or embroidery in chenille. This
is a most convenient kind of garment;
it takes the place of the corsage and
can be worn with any kind of skirt.
At Gaston Vaille's I have seen a cor
sage of sky blue taffetas covered with
five rows of white English application
insertion over white taffetas. Thes â â 
insertions are encircled with narrow
chicorees of white ribbon, which run
in scallops around the front. The neck
trimming is of sky blue velvet, draped.
The sleeves are very tight and are
trimmed at the shoulders with puffs of
sky blue taffetas covered with man
( herons of turciuoi.sn relvet, edged with
a repetition of the trimming on the
front. Beneath each maneneron is a
design in English application lace w-r
white taffetaw, forming a triangular
point. The wrists are lined with tur
quolse relvet and < dped with chlcoreea
of white taffetas. This is a very pretty
corsage to wear indoors.
II- â  ription of n very simple
yet pretty design from Mme. Henri
ette's. Jt is a Jacket of navy blue cloth,
a blouse in shape, with panel basques,
each embroidered uith a light pattern
in black braid. This Jacket is orna
mented with shawl lapels, ending in a
point, edged with claret velvet cut on
the cross. The waistband is made of
tlv same velvet, fastened in front with
,n stress buckle. The ne.k trimming is
.similar, but embroidered with black
and surmounted with a plain blue
cloth collar edged with claret velvet.
The sleeves are tailor made, slightly
puffed in the upper part and close from
[bow t'> the wrist, wh< re they are
led with a light pattern in black.
The hat worn with this Jacket is r,f
black felt, with a broad velvet ribbon
draped around the crown and a tuft of
four feathers, the two lower ones con
fined by â  str.iss buckle.

in bloomers and a leather apron, and
are turning out some dainty forgings.
A new philanthropy has been started

FROM COACH HOUSE TO CORONET
One of the many romances of the
British peerage has just reached the
stage 'if a happy denouement, and its
hero finds himself transported from !
the coach house to an early succession j
to fortune and a coronet.
R. D. (t. Fitzgerald was an Oxford
undergraduate of some distinction
when he succeeded to a fortune of I
Â£35,000, on which he established him- '
self as a sporting squire, master of a j
pack of hounds, and owner of some !
valuable racehorses. The turf, how
ever, quickly absorbed his patrimony,
and young Fitzgerald, at the time an l
army captain, found himself penniless. |
( He volunteered for foreign service, and
went through campaigns in Egypt and '.
Bechuanaland.
Without the means to support his
position in the army he resigned it. and
migrating to Victoria drifted from bad
to worse, until he was glad to act as
"station hand" in South Australia.
Later he drifted to Adelaide, and was
in the last stage of destitution when
a clergyman, who had known him in
his palmy days, got him employment '
as gardener and coachman to a mem- !
ber of tho Legislative Council of South :
Australia.
He was discharging these humble dv- I
ties when a cablegram reached him '

LEIGHTON'S TRUE ART.
An eminent American artist, who is now
an old man. has never forgotten the les
son he learned from Sir Francis Leigh
ton in his youth. Leighton was then a
brilliant and fascinating young painter,
whosf future was still before him. He
was at worts upon an Italian landscape,
or upon a picture with an Italian back
ground. In that background he waa
anxious to introduce an olive tree. He
remembered a tree which he had seen
in the south of Italy, and remembered It
quite distinctly enough to reproduce it,
but he was not content to trust his mem
ory.
The American artist remembers how
I.eighton came into a cafe in Rome on
his way to Southern Italy, making the
long Journey from England for the ex
press purpose of studying that olive tree
and of taking homo an exact sketch of it.
and he remembers also how, four or five
weeks la tor. the ardent young English
man, brilliant, enthusiastic, versatile, but
with a capacity for taking pains, reap
peared with a wonderful sketch of tho
olive tree, upon which he had spent days
of unbroken observation and work. From
this little incident the American student
learned a lesson which he never forgot,
and which went far to secure the suc
cess which came to him in later life. The
story illustrates the great quality which
lies behind all real success, alike for the
man of genius and the man of talent.â

CRUISE OF THE CALIFORNIA.
[Synopsis of preceding chapters.â Btmrie and
Kemoca have traveled with the savage chief.
K<". i. and the other savages 'ib" had been
held captive by the skull-hunter. Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee, and have reached the land where the
people and villages of the dead chief, Mah-
Coh-Gah, are. Koti has promised that an
army of savages will march through the
country of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee With Binnie -and
Kemona to the rescue of the German, who is
held captive, although their king, by the Afar
kise. a nation of savages who live in the
country adjoining Ghoor-Ghee-Tee' s realm.
While drawing near the chief village of Mtih-
Coh-Gah's people lilnnie and Kemona hear
â with astonishment that their savage allies
â¢wish Kinnie to be their war chief in the im
pending war with Ghoor-Ghee-Tee. They
â¢jvish him to teach them how the white men
fight in battle.]
CHAPTER XIV.
BUT Binnie was not to become
war chief without opposition. The
son of Mah-Coh-Gah, the chief
who had been killed in the duel
on the beach with Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee, hÂ»ard of the coming of
Einnie and frowned. He rallied air his
friends, many of them chiefs in small
villages, to support his claim to be the
head of his people. Nightly there were
6lgnal fires burning upon the surround
ing mountains, and the chiefs in all the
country saw the signals and gathered
at the call of Peloto, Mah-Coh-Gah's
son.
Not less active was Kotl In favpr of
Binnie, and, as he had many friends,
he succeeded in getting half the party
of chiefs on his side. Pending th^ ques
tion who would be the chief, Kemona
â was busy and brought daily reports to
Binnie.
"It Is about an even chance whether
we get away from here alive, Binnie,"
Kemona said one night.
Binnie was sitting on the ground
â¢watching his dinner, which was cooking
In front of the grass-thatched hut that
he and Kemona had built with their
own hands. Kemona, looking every
Inch like a native chief, stood near
holding his war club.
"I am determined to be the war chief
Jf I can," answered Binnie, "because
there is no other way for us to reach
and rescue the white King of the
Afarkise."
"That is right, Binnie. But Peloto Js
very angry and you must look out for
him. If he was out of the way our
course wo-uld be clear. As he is here,
the only sure way for you to become the
chief is to show them enough tricks of
the white men to astonish them and
make them a little afraid of you."
"Very well. I will first challenge him
to show to the chiefs who is the better
marksman, and I will stake my chances
on that test."
Peloto laughofl savagely when he
heard of this. He at once agreed. He
came with bows and arrows and spears
and slings and handed them con
temptuously to the white boy.
"I will try him first with bow and
arrows," Binnie told Kemona.
"But you are no match for Peloto
with a bow."
Binnie smiled. He had passed two
summers among the Muscogee Indians
when his father was an army officer
and he was confident that he would
cive a good account of himself and of
his teacher, a great Muscogee chief.
Peloto fixed an arrow on his bow
string and aimed at an eagle that flew
overhead. Binnie was changing the
feathers on his arrows but looked up
to see the eagle suddenly stop in hia
course and fall toward Peloto. Quick as
thought he hart an arrow and twang
went his bow. When the eagle fell there
were two arrows through its body, one
of which was Binnie's that he had shot
when the bird was dropping through
the air with the speed of a rocket.
"Huh, huh, huh:" said the chief,
looking at Binnie favorably. Peloto's
eyes flashed fire.
Again he aimed an arrow and
twanged his bow-string. The shaft
flew high, fell in a curve and pierced
the body of a small squirrel, which it
pinned to a tree. Binnie had another
arrow ready and lot fly. He was more
careful about his aim. His arrow
struck the one shot by Peloto squarely
on the end, splitting the shaft.
A murmur arose among the chiefs.
They had never seen any shooting line
this. Peloto threw down his bow in
anger.
"Arrows are the playthings of boys."
he said, "but what will the white boy
do when the battle rages? Will he lead
our braves with the spear?"
"Ha, ha," laughed Binnie, when this
was repeated to him. "Peloto would be
a poor man for me to meet in battle if
he knows no more about a spear than
he knows about the bow and arrow."
"Dog, dog," growled Peloto, darting
forward, half crazed with rage, but
thinking now that he would speedily
end white boy rival.
Kemona was frightened as he saw
Binnie step forward with a spear to
meet Peloto's onward rush; but the
look of alarm on the Australian's fare
changed as he saw Binnie, with his
spear, take the position of "guard" in
the bayonet drill. Kemona having been
a British soldier in India knew that in
skill Binnie. by his show of confidence,
must be the superior of Peloto In such
a game.
Peloto's first lunge was met by Binnie
with a sharp parry. To the savage's
surprise and also to Kemona's, the
white boy stood for some time on the
CAPTAIN IVOR WALLIS
The Five-Year-Old Soldier of Marysville.
IT IS g nerally conceded that the young, the world over, show. In one way
or another, a leaning for the glitter and array attendant on the position
in life of the soldier, but it is seldom that this characteristic is to be
noted in such a marked degree as in the case of little 5-year-old Ivor
Wallis, the midget mascot of Marysville's military company, whose pic
ture, true to life, is here presented.
Attired in his trim-fitting uniform, and carrying the sword with which
his admirers about The Call headquarters have presented him. Master Wallis,
or rather Captain Wallis, as he prefers to be called, allows no one to outdo
him for martial courage and tread. He also has a gun, with which he exe
cutes the manual of arms in a finished way that puts to blush many of the
recruits of the N. G. C. Strange to say, this lad has also given evidence
that he will one day make his mark at shooting. A book without the pic
tures of soldiers or scenes of war times possesses no attraction for him. On
the other hand, he will ponder for hours at a time over a volume devoted to
the battlefield and its illustrations cf heroes. Company Dis quite proud of

defensive and once more showed that
life around a garrison, with Boldiers as
well as Indians for instructors, has its
advantages. Peloto could not strike
Binnle, even when exerting his strength
with his utmost fury. Binnie stood
quietly, but with his blue eyes wide
open and watchful, awaiting each new
attack.
The savage chiefs were more sur
prised than before. They saw Peloto's
fronzy. Peloto would have plunged the
â pear through Binnle if he could have
done so. He tired himself out with his
rage and violence, only to see Binnie.
with quick, skillful motions, prove the
savage to be really unskillful before the
eyes of all the savages.
"Strike him, Binnle," shouted Kemo
na, "you must do it to win the day."
Binnio's face flushed. Soon the point
of his spear grazed Peloto's arm, then
his shoulder, then his body and then
scratched his cheek. That Binnie could
have dealt a dangerous blow if he had
willed so to do the chiefs who were
I",. kins: on fully understood. Finally.
when Peloto was off his guard, Binnie,
by a quick, dexterous movement, actu
ally disarmed him and Peloto stood at
the mercy of Binnie. Th.' boy stood a
moment with his spear held as if to
st'ik.', then he laughed and dropped his
spear on the ground.
"Quick. Kemona, a revolver," said
the boy. as a shadow crossed his hand
some face. A small bird was soaring
so high above him that it seemed only
a speck. The savages shouted with
surprise and some alarm at the report
of the revolver as he fired, for most of
them knew nothing of firearms. Swiftly
sped the bullet on high and the bird,
which had been beyond the range of
any bow and arrow, fell.
Peloto was defeated but not satisfied,
nor could he conceal his wrath the fol
lowing day when the chiefs, with one
voice, asked Binnle to teach them the
art of war and to lead them, as their
great war chief, against Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee.
The following few weeks were filled
with business. Kemona formed the
savages into battalions and taught
them to perform some marching move
ments. They were made to see that
breast guards of the bark of a swamp
tree was proof against arrows and
spear thrusts. They learned to obey
orders- and when they were on a
"bayonet charge" they looked formida
ble even to Kemona as thoy dashed
forward on a rapid run. tall, black,
athletic, shouting fiercely their native
war cries.
They were as teachable as children.
Binnie learned enough words to com
mand them to do whatever Kemona
had taught. Every day they were put
through the movements. Every night
Kemona was prouder of them. They
grew more impatient daily to man h to
attack Ghoor-Ghee-Tee.
It was wiser to go forth to attack
than to wait until all the hostile tribes
of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee could be brought
into the land of Mah-Coh-Gaa in one
army. A council of the chiefs, each of
whom would command the people of
his own village, was held with Binr.ie
and Kemona. It was agreed by all that
It was wise to march at once.
"Forward," shouted Binnie In the
dialect of the savages the next morn
ing.
"Forward," repeated thÂ«Â» great chief
who commanded the twenty battalions
Into which the 10,000 fighting men had
been divided.
So they marched In dusky procession
with Binnle, the San Francisco boy, at
their head and with Kemona at his
right hand as adviser and second in
command. They Corded streams,
climbed mountains and crowed valleys
in military order. The savages already
acted like soldiers and were evidently
proud of what they had learned. In
many ways they showed that tin y
were devoted to Binnie, whom they
promised to follow through all dangers
where he would lead.
"To-morrow," said one of the chiefs
to Binnle, "we will see the Marwise
River. On the other sl>!>* Ghoor-Ghee-
Tee has his greatest vilUge."
The body of savag runners, who
were doing duty as ecouts, was dou
bled, bo that there w re 200. At night
a scout brought word to Binnle that he
had. from a high hill, sighted the Mar
wise at a short distance of some miles,
and had seen some war canoes in mo
tion.
"The time has come for you to shnw
your skill. Kemona," said Binnie.
"You wU have to cross the river to
night, under the cover of darkness, and
learn all you can about Ohoor-Ghee-
Tee and his plans. Yoi will take with
you a strong body of picked men, who
â will wait for you at the river's edge.
They must not build any fires. Should
you need help send across the river at
once. I will keep a picket line all the
way from our camp to the river, ami
pn will know in a few minutes what
happens. Now pro."
Kemona neod^d no second command,
but was off almost before Binnieceasod
ppeaking. The army of savages was
halted in a denpo forest. Amonjr them
Binnie walked with the brotherly and
chlvalric feeling: that belongs to true
soldiers on the pve of battle. When the
Favages saw that Binnie was cool and
calm and that he evidently did not fear
Ohoor-Ghee-Toe's thousands of black
sklnned warriors, they were filled with
enthusiasm, which they manifested in
low rries of "pood." But Peloto said
nothing, and in his eyes burned a bale
ful light, which did not escape the
seemingly careless but really keen
glance of Binnie.
"Peloto may yet be more of an enemy
than Ghoor-Ghee-Tee," the boy mut
tered.
"White snake." said Peloto. beneath
his breath, as Binnie passed.
That night Pelnto stole out of the
camp, swam across the Marwise River,
and began his career as a traitor to
his own people, to revenge himself
upon them and upon Binnie.

WILLIE WINKLE'S WIND WAGON
WILLIE TWINKLE. 12 years
old, lives at Bernal Heights.
In a valley at the Heights
almost any day coasters
driven through the thor
oughfares by sails may be
seen. No doubt, Willie Twinkle pot the
idea for the invention that has made
him famous from these sailing: coasters.
But the Wind Wagon is as much bigger
thing than the roasters as a cirrus in
three rings, with half a dozen elephants
to Jump over and three clowns, is
bigger than an exhibition of two buck
ing goats at the wind-swept summit of
the Heights.
In order to understand Just what hap
pened to Willie Twinkle and his Wind
Wagon, it may be well first to describe*
his invention. Billy Bluster, who works
in a machine shop, helped to make the
machinery. First there were four
spidery-spoked wheels, light and strong
but with flanges on them to run on the
street railroad tracks without slipping
off. Then there was a floor or deck,
supported by the running gear. X'nder
the deck were several small wlwela for
ropes to run over. Looming up above
the deck were three masts and above
these were topmasts, fore, main and
mlzzen. At the front end of the deck
a bowsprit and Jibboom extended. It
needed only sails to make the "Wind
Wagon look like a three-masted fore
and-aft schooner, and these it had. The
likeness was completed by shrouds, an
anchor and a long sweep-like affair
that stuck out behind, which Willie
Twinkle made for a steering oar. It
was really a drag.
The masts were stout enough to stand
a gale. The sails were large. They
were made of pieces of old carpets
which Willie Twinkle and Billy Bluster
had collected and sewn together with
pack twine for thread. Charlie Capstan,
whose father is a sailmaker, cut and
Bhaped the sails and helped to rig the
tackle to holHt the sails. Ropes run
ning over the wheels under the deck
pulled all the sails up at once.
"Great!" said Willie Twinkle as the
sails were hoisted the first time by the
forward motion of the wagon, which did
the work of hoisting the sails itself.
This was the most ingenious invention
of all, and it played an amusing part in
Willies adventures.
Willie Twinkle was made captain.
Billy Bluster was the first mate and
engineer and Charlie Capstan was the
second mate. As they were all of the
crew and all were officers they got
along very well together, as might be
guÂ«ssed. Tommy Traddles offered to
ship as foremast hand, but when he
found that he would have to mind three
officers at once he gave it up at the end
of one afternoon.
The wind wagon was tried at Bernal
Heights and was found to work well.
The thr^e boys made occasional trips
along Mission street for short dis
tances. Then an ambitions idea came
into Willie Twinkle's head. He whis
pered it to his officers and crew, and
they took it up at once. Soon after
that a lot of little girls and boys in the
Bernal Heights district rpceived invi
tations, which read as follows:

P- S. â Bring your lunch along.
A score of boys and girls came. Min
nie Llghtfoot brought her Christmas
doll, and so did Mary Needles. All the
boys had on sailor caps, on the
front of which were the words: "Red
Rover of Bernal Heights." Tommy
Traddles found the name in a book
about pirates and all the boys liked it.
There were more boys than girls who
were ready to sail. They all had lunch
baskets. When all was ready Willie
Twinkle pushed his Wind Wagon into
view, and the youngsters greeted it
with "tree cheers," which made Wil
lies face blush like a red rose.
The sails went up when the wagon
moved, and, as the wind struck them,
it was all that the boys could do to
hold the Wind Wagon until the girls
could get on. They sat with their feet
hanging over the sides, their dolls be
tween them and their lunch-baskets
carefully stowed near the masts.
RUTH PEMBROKE'S SACRIFICE.
It was a week before the Xmas holi
days that little Ruth Pembroke's
mother caught the severe cold that
confined her to her bed for a season.
The doctor had been there that
morning, and his parting words are
still rinsing in her ears.
"Ha\f this prescription filled out at
once, Mrs. Pembroke, rest quietly in
bed for another week, and I think you
will soon be well and strong again."
How little the good doctor knew
what a bitter prescription he was
leaving. It was hard indeed to rest
quietly in bed, when It was her busy
needle that kept herself and little
Ruth from want. Ruths father was
dead. He had died two years before
the beginning of this story, whr-n Ruth
was -nly 4 years old.
The child .till remembered the pret
ty home In San Francisco they had
given up at his death. The happy days
when mamma and herself were al
ways merry and glad, with hosts of
friends.
Niw they lived in two little rooms,
with few comforts and fewer friends!
One other memory Ruth has of those
happy days is a sad one, of going to
say "good-by" to papa when he was
so 111. and how he took her in his arms
and whispered. "Take care of mamma
for me, dear little Ruth." His parting
words to the child have never been for
gotten, and they have colored all her
life.
Her constant thought and care of
her sweet, pretty mother has made her
old beyond her years. And there Is
Annabel, her beautiful doll baby, that
she loves with all a mother's devotion.
While the doctor was holding con
sultation with her mother that morn
ing little Ruth was having a most
serious conversation with Annabel In
the corner.
"Annabel," whispered Ruth. "I can
not give quite so much time to you
now, my dear, for I am very busy in
deed. As soon as rtie doctor goes I
must make tea and toast for mamma,
and then if you are a very good child
you may go out with me to buy her
medicine."
But after the doctor had departed
poor Ruth was doomed to disappoint
ment. She made the tea and toast, but
when she offered to go for the medi
cine her mother said: "Ruth. dear. I
am afraid we cannot afford the medi
cine Just now, I have so little money;
I am afraid to spend it until I am sure
of earning more. I think, however,
darling, that Annabel and yourself had
better go out for a little walk, for you
are looking quite pale from being shut
up with me so long."
Sadly the little girl departed for her
walk, with Annabel dressed in gay at
tire.
Some small boys did not succeed in ;
getting on to the Wind Wagon, as it
now darted forward. They rolled in <
the dust and cried. Willie Twinkle and >
his crew were all aboard. The boys
stood up and held on by the rigging. â 
So, with a fresh wind, and all sails, in- '
eluding topsails and Jibs set, the Wind 1
Wagon rounded into Valencia street !
and bowled rapidly along, to the ad- J
miration of many spectators.
The officers of the Market-street rail
way, hearing what had happened, hu
manely telephoned to have all cars held '
at the foot of Market street, for fear !
of collision, and sent a force of police
men to the junction of Market and Va
lencia streets to stop the queer sailing
rolling craft there if they could.
Meanwhile Willie Twinkle was the
hero- of. the hour. Only once he com
promised his popularity by describing
the wind as "a spanking breeze."
Several boys looked a little shame
faced until Captain W'illie said that he
had heard a sailor say this and that it
meant only that the wind blew very
hard. Then the boys breathed easier.
The Wind Wagon fairly flew along Va
lencia street. Willie Twinkle stood at
the helm and all went well. He already
had dreams of going into business in
competition with the Market street
railway. The first real excitement was
at the turn where Valencia street joins
Market. The wind had steadily grown
stronger and the Wind Wagon had a
high rate of speed.
"Stand by to wear ship," yelled Wil
lie to Billy Bluster and Charlie Cap
stan, as the blue-coated police officers,
who were lined up on both sides of the
track, came to view.
This called all the crew to the steer
ing sweep. Could they round into Mar
ket street? They were all strong and
cool-headed and they made the turn in
ship shape fashion.
But they noticed with horror that the
bowsprit had impaled a fat policeman
â¢ who had been in the middle of the car
track, and there he hung at the bow of
the Wind Wagon like an apple on a
pointed stick. Nor was this all. for the
wind suddenly shifted and all the sails
with their heavy booms swept across
the deck like a flash, knocked over
board half of the little girls with their
dolls, rolled the others off and mowed
down a whole squad of policemen, who
lay in the street in a blue row as the
Wind Wagon swept on in its mad
career.
There were wailings of children and
the sound of gruff police voices in the
air. Willie and his crew were scared,
but they nevertheless felt proud of the

BY MARY MORRIS LLOYD.
Only a few squares from home is
a business portion of the city. Here
she takes Annabel to look in at all
the gay windov.s. The druggist's win
dow interests her more than all the
others. So many bottlesâ surely there
must be something there to make
poor mamma well. She gazes long and
earnestly at all the labels. At last
with a sigh she passes on. Nearly
every window offers a prize of some
sort on purchases made within.
One window exhibits a large doll
dressed as a bride. She studies the doll
with interest. "Annabel, she is not
half as beautiful as you are, my pet."
Suddenly a thought enters her head
that almost makes her little heart stop
beating, and causes her to clasp An
nabel more tightly in her arms.
"Annabel, can we do it?" she whis
pers. "We both love mamma very
â¢ " What can Ido for you, little girl; is Dolly ill? "
dearly and we must make her well."
She does not pause to think. Hur
riedly she retraces her steps to the
drug store. The druggist is filling out
a prescription for a customer. When
he hears the door open, looking up, he
sees a little girl enter who wears a
bright-red cape and a little red cap
resting on her curly head. In her
arms she carries a beautiful doll. As
she reaches the counter he notes how
white her face is. and that her eyes
are filled with tears. "What can I do
for you, little girl? Is dolly ill?" said
the druggist.
"No, sir," said little Ruth. "Anna
bel is well; but poor mamma Is very
ill, and she has no money to buy med
icine. If I give you Annabel to put in
your window, would you give me some
medicine for mamma?"
The druggist's face was a study, and
I think there were tears in his own
eyes, as he picked little Ruth up and
seated her on the counter and made
her tell him all about it.
"And if you put Annabel in your
window, may I come every day to see
her? For you see she has never been
separated from me before," said the
child.
The kind-hearted druggist agreed to
everything, and even allowed her to
arrange Annabel in the window to
her own satisfaction. With a look of
pride and a kiss she departed, run
ning all the way home for the pre
scription. Fortunately she finds her
mother asleep. With the little slip of
paper held tightly In her hand she
runs all the way back, entering the
drug store a second time with cheeks
as red as roses.
When Mrs. Pembroke was awakened
from her nap she found Ruth seated by
her bedside with such a smiling, happy
face, and both hands clasped behind
her.
"Mammie, you must not ask any
just astern and the sails were full.
Billy Bluster moved about arid paid
out on the ropes so that the sails drew
as hard as possible.
There were several narrow escapes
from collisions going down Market
street. Suddenly the wind died out op
posite the City Hall. Willie pulled his
sails down in a trice. Out rushed some
policemen and jumped on the deck.
They pushed the wagon just enough
to raise tfie sails a little bit. A puff of
wind started the wagon faster. An
other policeman was in trouble. The
machinery that hoisted the sails caught
him and he was mastheaded. The
other policemen fell off.
"We're off again," shouted Willie
Twinkle with the spirit of a true
yachtsman.
A dense crowd had gathered between
the Baldwin and the Palace hotels that
not only lined the sidewalks and all
the windows overlooking the street but
also filled the street out to the car
tracks. Into this crowd with a police
man fastened on the bowsprit and an
other policeman held a captive at mast
head the Wind Wagon dashed.
Away down the street a solitary bob
car was cori-.ing up.
"Gracious." said Willie Twinkle to
Billy Bluster, "we must run down that
hay-bunker sure, unless we make quick
work. Hurry and help me put the helm
to port."
Billy and Charlie Capstan seized the
sweep along with Captain Twinkle.
The effect on the crowd was magical.
The sweep felled them like a row of
tenpins.
"Starboard, starboard," yelled 'Willie,
seeing that the Wind Wagon would
not go as he wished.
The result was the mowing down of
additional scores of spectators. Then
the Wind Wagon left the track just
in time to have its bowsprit graze the
bob-car and take out its windows,
dropping the policeman on the roof of
the car. But Willie steered it back In
great shape.
"Throw out the anchor," he cried.
The anchor fell into a cable slot, but
dragged a while. Then the Wind
Wagon was near the long line of cable
cars, which were held up at the foot
of Market street.
"Hi, yi!" shouted the crowd.
"Get off the track!" screamed Willie
Twinkle.
But the anchor stuck fast. The Wind
Wagon was brought to an instant stop
and the air was full of flying boys.
Willie and his crew flew so high in the
air that they struck on the roof of the
ferry sheds.
"Hooray," yelled Willie Twinkle,
"we made the trip as advertised!"
"We did, we did!" answered his crew,
with glee.
But the Wind Wagon was a wreck,
with a policeman still at masthead.
questions. I have earned your medi
cine," and, drawing her hands from be
himl her. "here it is."
Mamma did ask a great many
questions, but Ruth steadily answered,
"Will tell you all about it when you are
well, mamma."
Some way an account of little Ruth' 9
brave sacrifice crept into the daily pa
pers, accompanied by a picture of Ruth
and Annabel, for she went every after
noon and sat for half an hour with her
dear dolly. And when the druggist an
nounced that the doll, and a large per
centage on purchases made at his store
the following week were to be donated
to little Ruth, it proved to be the best
advertisement he had ever made in his
life, for the kind-hearted people fairly
flocked to his store.
Mrs. Pembroke steadily grew better,
and at the end of the week was sitting
at her window trying to do a little sew
ing, when some one rapped at the door.
The druggist's clerk was there with
Ruth's doll in his arms and a letter
pinned to its sleeve addressed to Ruth.
Without a word of explanation he de
posited the doll on a table near at hand
and departed. The mother quickly
summoned Ruth from the adjoining
room, and when Ruth saw dear Anna
bel lying on the table she looked as be
wildered as did her mother.
"Let me read the letter, dear," said
mamma. Opening the letter out fell a
check for $100. The letter was as fol
lows:
"A slight testimonial of love and af
fection for a brave little girl. From ad
miring friends in San Francisco."
And there was still another note for
Ruth's mother from the druggist with
a full explanation of all that she did
not understand.
It was a happy day in the little home,
but after Ruth was in bed and fast
asleep that night a still greater happi
ness came to them. There was an
other knock at the door. At the sum
mons to enter a tall, white-haired old
gentleman stepped into the room.
Mrs. Pembroke looked into his face.
"Uncle Edward?"
"Yes, dear, it is Uncle Edward, and I
have come all the' way from Boston to
see little Ruth. I read a full account
of her brave little sacrifice in one of the
San Francisco papers, and knew she
must be your child, for the picture was
so like you. Alice, I was hard on Ruth' 3
father; I could not forgive him for tak
ing you away from me; but I am now
an old man, and feel that perhaps I
have not many years to live. For the
sake of little Ruth forgive the past.
And so little Ruth brought peace and
happiness into two lonely lives, and fn
Uncle Edward's beautiful Boston home
they will live a happy life, free from
want and care.WHAT "THE GIRL FROM PARIS" NEEDS
IS A LIVE, PALPITATING PRESS
AGENT.
It strikes me as rather important
that "The Girl from Paris," which Is
planned especially for the entertain
ment of the worldy, which is now near-
Ing its 1000 th performance in London,
and in its second season in New York,
should come all the way to San Fran
cisco to no better purpose than to
make a hoosiers' holiday. During the
first part of the Golden Jubilee week,
while our country cousins were with
OB thousands strong, the Baldwin was
a place to be crushed and stifled in;
but now, as the town resumes some
thing of its normal size and taste, night
by night the rows of empty seats
creep closer to the stage. This is not
an encouraging outlook for a three
weeks engagement, and unless some
thing extraordinarily compelling is
done in the way of advertisingâsome
thing that will make the show so
talked about that the people who have
not seen it will not be able to stay
away from itâ l am sure that we will
pet another black eye in New York,
where already we are considered un
certain, coy and hard to please.
I do not see where the critics can be
of further assistance; for the ones who
write fiction and say that this is a love
ly show are so prosy and unimaginative
in the manner of their prevarication
that they do even less good than the
ones who tell the truth about the pro- j
duction and give credit to the little in '
it that is good. (I do not mean to be
disrespectful to any of my colleagues:
therefore it seems safer and wiser and
politer to imply that they prevaricate
rather than that they really think "The j
Girl from Paris" is all they crack it up j
to bo). What is needed is a press agent \
of electrical enterprise who will seize j
upon the sensational *> ssibilities of the
piece and the company and hypnotize
the editors of the local newspapers into
the belief that the performance de
serves the attention of the press.
A brilliant press agent would have
little difficulty in convincing the av
editor that things happen in
"The Girl from Paris" which deserve
long columns of moral rebuke; some
editors would even permit him to write
the moral rebuke himself and set it off
with photographic corroboration. The
mere praise that the disinterested crit
ic lavishes on the funny German of
Harry Hermsen, the firecracker major
.->f J. C. Marlowe, the quartet of fresh
ly scrubbed and tailored young men
the good-looking young women is
sufficient to lure the town from
Its fireside these chill nights. A press
â  : is needed who will tell how near
"The Girl from Paris" approaches the
limit if the law, why some of the jokes
nn-1 fime of Edpar Halstead's lifelike
s in the Scottish kilt would make
â  r blush, where the clever French
and his cane and his kisses pass
The bounds of niceness, and how many
ards of lingerie and legs are used* in
W he entire performance.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It is upon the lively amplification of
such details as these that success de
pends. You or I might discuss at
prave length the fatty degeneration of
the drama that lurks in hybrid musi
cal vaudeville farces and never be the

lif has a vague idea that the press is

At all events "The Girl from Paris"
will have a slim season if something is
not done, and done soon. Per
haps the Baldwin management
can unearth some gifted ama
tour who will turn out inspired
"copy," some dilettante journalist who
will know just bow to touch oil the
tenderloin charms of the performance;
or perhaps one of the clergy might be j
induced to condemn it; or a rumor
might be floated that the supposedly
real lace worn by the quartet of danc
ing girls Is nothing less than fllagreed
asbestos; or Herr Bosworth might be
importuned to do for the musical num
bers of the piece what he did for Bee
thoven's fifth symphony: or, as a last
resort, one of the managers might write
a letter something on the order of this ,
one. which is written by good old B. F.
Keith, the vaudeville king, and sent to
me by his trusty press agent:

Since the complete text of that ter
rible Clement Scott interview, which
fired the indignation of the players of
England and America, has reached
this country the retaliatory attacks on
the London critic have in a measure
abated. Principal of what Scott says is
this:
"It is nearly impossible for a woman
to remain pure who adopts the stage
as a profession. Everything is against
her. Temptation surrounds her in
every shape and on every side; her
prospects frequently depend upon the
nature and extent of her compliance,
and after all human nature is very
weak. These drawbacks are the things
that render it impossible fur a lady to
remain a lady. But what is infinitely
more to be deplored is that the woman
who endeavors to keep her purity is
almost of necessity foredoomed to fail
ure in her career.
"What I have said to you will prob
ably give great offense to certain peo
ple, but they are Just the people I
should not care about in the least, and,
after all, they need not put the cap on
unless it fits them, and I should think
if they do find it fits they will at least
have the good worldly sense to keep
such a fact to themselves."
Julia Marlowe's new romantic play is
an adaptation of Rudolph Btrats'a "The
Tall Prussian," under the English titlo
of "The Countess Valeska." Its scene
is laid in Poland in 1807; its action is
supposed to pass on the evening of a
battle; it presents an episode in the ex
perience of a noble young woman who
is in sympathy with Napoleon, but in
love with a Polish officer. She har
bors the officer on the night of the bat

attempting to poison Napoleon. Wil

"All plays, I am coming to believe,
have the same story," writes Vance
Thompson. "There are two lovers,
united in the first act, separated more
or less widely and by various means !n
the intermediate arts, only to come to
gether in the last act (this is comedy),
or to remain separatedâ and this is
tragedy. If you think it over you will
discover that this is the story of al
most every play, and so â If you will
permit me â I will reduce M. Polti's
thirty-six dramatic situations to one."
One night during her recent tour of

found that a song which attacked her
art and personality had been liberally
circulated among the audience. Walk

"Ladies and Gentlemen: On reaching
your village I find that a song hostile
to me has been distributed in the thea
ter and elsewhere. The poet doubtless
realized his injustice, for he did not
sign his work. But, to show that my
contempt for such anonymous vulgari
ties is equaled only by my good humor,
I ask your permission to sing you these
verses of a man who, perhaps, in his
whole life will have but this one chance
to be applauded. "

art cannot make such a heroine any
thing but repulsive to a healthy-minded
person," he writes. "The psychopath
ology of the French drama does not
include anything more morbid and un
real than this consumptive harlot sac
rificing herself for a lover. The whole
story is so silly that, with or without
music, it is high time that it should be
banished from the stage. Future gen
erations will marvel at our coarse
taste in tolerating such mawkish rub
bish. 1 '
William Archer and Misa Diana
White have completed a translation,
from the Danish, of Dr. Georg BrandeÃ'
critical study of Shakespeare. Dr.
Brandes is by many Europeans re
garded as the most important dramatic
critic of the day.
TiVoli.
The Tivoli promises an Interesting
production to-morrow night in "The
Pearl of Pekin," a light operatic piece,
the music by Charles Lecocq, to which
has been added several solos and en
sembles by Gustav Kerker; the book is
from the French of Suru and Chivot,
Englfshed by Charles Alfred Byrne.
Both Mr. Byrne and Mr. Kerker are
Americans, and the American popular
ity of the piece is in no small measure
due to their work.
Edwin Stevens, whose vacation ends
with to-night's performance of "Brian
Boru," has the elaborate part of the
great Tyfoo. a mandarin and the Gov
ernor of Pekin; Miss Walcott is his
daughter, the Pearl of Pekin, and Miss
Edith Hall is Finette, a vivandiere and
the wife of Petite Pierre, the French
quartermaster, who goes in for inn
keeping in China. Finette is really the
heroine, although her name does not
give the title to the piece.
The law of Tsing, which prevails in
the plot, prescribes that if a stranger
once sees the face of a Chinese girl he
must forthwith marry her, or else be
impaled. The Pearl of Pekin strays
from home, and is seen by Petite Pierre,
the French innkeeper. When Tyfoo
hears of this he buries family pride,
and insists that Petite Pierre shall
marry his daughter. The wedding
takes place, to the immense wrath of
Finette, who arrives tou late to stop
the ceremony. The unwilling bigamist
tells her that as soon as he can he
will escape and join her. This, how
ever, does not satisfy the jealous Fi
nette. who plots with the Pearl of Pe
kin to take her place and personate her
on the wedding night. The scheme is
successfully carried out, and Petite
Pierre and Finette (disguised as a Chi
nese lady) are conducted in state to
the bridal chamber. But the trick
played by Finette is dlsco-vered by Ty
foo the next day, and, always in obedi
ence to the laws of Tsing, Petite Pierre
is brought up for trial. The council
condemn him to be impaled, but be
fore the sentence can be executed Fi
nette attends to it that everybody gets
full of champagne. Then the crew of
the French man-of-war arrive, and all
ends happily in a Franco-Chinese cho
rus.
Phil Branson has been cast for Pe
tite Pierre, a part which he played in
the first production, and Thomas Leary
has a good chance as Sosoriki, the com
ical factotum of Tyfoo.
A Chinese ballet and orchestra, new
scenery by Fest, new costumes and a
liberal interpolation of new music are
promised in the production.
Fritz Scheel has been engaged to
conduct a series of popular matinee
concerts at the Tivoli, commencing
Saturday. February 19. The band will
be composed of the entire Tivoli or
chestra and about twenty-five extra
musicians.
Alcazar.
Henry Guy Carlton. who wrote Nat
Goodwin's "Ambition" and John
Drew's "The Butterflies," will be rep
resented at the Alcazar this week in
"Victor Durand," a melodrama in four
acts that was first produced at Wal
lack's twelve years ago. This is the
plot:
Victor Durand and his friend, Paul
Dean, leave Monte Carlo together,
where Dean has made 3 big: winning
at the tables. Near Paris Dean is dis
covered in a railway carriage, mur
dered and robbed. Antonio Sparza, a
tool of the real criminal, testifies that
i Durand committed the crime, and the
' hero is sentenced to the galleys for
; life. After two years, however, he
' escapes and goes to Rome under an
assumed name, where he begins a new
! life, and eventually marries. On the
. wedding journey his wife induces him
Ito stop in Paris. His desire to shun
j society creates suspicion, and at the
j instigation of one the Baron de Mer-
I sac, his identity is discovered. He is
finally saved through the efforts of his
wife, who, with the assistance of de
tectives, fastens the crime upon none
other than the haughty baron.
â¢ Wright Huntington, Frederick Paul
. ding and W. H. Pascoe, who has be
come a regular member of the Alcazar
company since the expiration of his
contract with Morosco, will be promi
nent in the. cast.
The play was last seen here during a
: Frohman engagement at the Baldwin
about ten years ago, so it will be a
novelty to many theater goers. "Char
: ley's Aunt" is :in preparation to fol
low.
Baldwin.
"The Girl From Paris" has two
; weeks more to run at the Baldwin, in
| eluding Sunday nights, after which
' time come th* Bostonians. It has net
i as yet beni settled whether these oop

the musical director, and our own little

veloped into one of the cleverest wo
men in comic opera.
Galifomia.
To-night is the last chance to see
Marie Dressier at the California in
"Courted into Court." Miss Dressier
has scored a personal hit of magni
tude in San Francisco, and it Is to be
hoped she will call again every season.
Mr. Sparks and Mr. Kruger will be re
membered, too, for their clever work,
and let us hope that this brilliant band
of farce-comedy players will follow the
example of May Irwin and forswear the
terrible McNally.
Commencing Monday the California
will be darkened for six nights. On
Sunday night it will be double dark
ened by the Black Patti's Troubadours,
who will then commence an engage
ment of two weeks. The organization
numbers fifty singers, dancers and
vaudeville specialists, and is said to ba
the best assortment of Afro-American
ginger that ever went on the road.
Ernest Hogan, the composer-comedian,
is of the company, and will give us tha
authentic ragtime coon song at first
hand.
Morosco's.
"Down In Dlxey," a melodrama of
the South, will be the new piece at Mo
rosco's. A sensational escape from
death in a cotton press and the flames
of a burning building will be the most
exciting of the situations; a pickanin
ny band and the introduction of songs,
specialties and buck and wing dances
will furnish the local touch and the
contract to the thrilling and romantic
motive of the plot.
Mortimer Snow has been cast for the
part of Jack, the heroic son of Judge
Calhoun, the Southern planter, and as
Georgia, the humble "work-out" with
whom Jack is violently in love. Miss
Hall should be at her characteristic:
best. Landers Stevens, Fred Butler,
Julia Blanc are prominently cast. The
scenery will play its usual conspicu
o-us part.
Orpheum.
The Groat Gautier and his trained
horses promise to contribute the par
ticular sensation to the new bill at the
Orphcum. This' act, it is said, is not
the usual one of marching and drilling,
but something swift, dangerous and al
together different from anything ever
given outside of a circus tent.
Among other new people are the
Jacksons, who do a colored grotesque
comedy sketch; the Nawns, who have
been seen here before, in a new skit
that givos Tow Nawn the part of an
Irishman; and the Brothers Damm,
who execute acrobatic feats that are
said to be unprofane and thrilling. The
biograph will have a new set of pic
tures.
The hold-overs include Al Wilson,
the German monologuist, who is very
popular with some of the audience;
Dollie Cole, in new baritone songs, and
Carletta, the great contortionist. Al
mont and Dumont have returned for
an extra week of musical specialties.
Golumbia.
The scars of fire and stains of water
are rapidly disappearing in the Colum
bia, and it Is expected that this popular
theater will reopen about the middlo
of February with Harry Corson Clarke
and a new company in Broadhurst's
farce, "What Happened to Jones?" Af
fie "Warner will be prominent in the
company.
Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall manage
ment announces the continuance of
Kirchner's Ladles' Orchestra, and a big

Chiquita is happy at the Chutes. The
spacious theater is packed every after

performances. The programme for the
week includes nearly everything in the
variety line, from a tight-rope walker
to a high art soprano.

CAN PROVE SHE IS 138 YEARS OLD
Remarkable life of Marie Durand, saiJ to be the oldest person on earth.
The oldest living person In the world is Marie Durand.
who lives In the village of Auberive, Department of Haute
Mama, France. She is 138 years of age.
This may seem incredible, but it is absolutely authen
tic, and there are records to show it. It is not necessary
to take Mme. Durand's word. There are the church rec
ords, which place the date of her birth as September 22,
1760. The Mayor of Auberive, Jean Baptiste Bachasson,
has made affidavit to the effect that he has known the
woman for forty-six years, and that she was very old
when he first saw her. The centenary of her marriage
was celebrated in 1886, and no one has ever duubted for a
moment that Mme. Durand is as old as she claims to be.
The great-granddaughter of Mme. Durand keeps a shop
for the sale of charcoal and wood in Auberive, and the old
woman lives with her. She spends most of her time hud
dling over the fire, but is always glad to see visitors and
to talk of the bygone years of her life.

the merest wreck of humanity. But such Is not the case.
Marie Durand is able to sit upright in a chair and her face
is wonderfully free from wrinkles. The greatest signs of
age appear at the corners of her mouth, which are drawn
down at the sides, the prominent face bones and the watery
and nearly sightless eyes. She has hardly any hair.
Nor has Marie Durand's memory deserted her. She can
remember nearly every event of her life. The Incidents of
the meteoric career of Napoleon I are as clear to her as if
they happened yesterday. "He was a grand soldier, but
also a great villain." is the way she deauÂ«Des him. Nor
has she lost track of her numerous family. Her children,
grandchildren and three times great-grandchildren are all
known to her, and she can call the names of each. She
takes an interest in each and every one and loves to
fondle the babies.
In spite of her great age, Marie Durand says she ex
pects to keep out of the cemetery for many years to come.
If you ask her if she expects to celebrate her next birth
day, she replies quickly: "Why not?"

THE IDEAL SUMMER RESORT
FROM Lob Angeles to the sea, the
most direct route leads to Santa
Monica, and at the rapid rate the
larger city is growing westward,
the two places will soon clasp
hands. ,',"\; â 'â â 
What coney Island is to New York,
Santa Monica is to Los Angelesâ the
natural place of resort that Its people can
reach, with -little effort and at small cost,
and having reached, can find adequate
provision for their enjoyment in almost
every variety conceived by man.
A finer building site for a town could
not be imagined. "With enough grade. to
make storm drainage easy and complete,
the land slopes to its terminating pointâ
the edge of the bluff a hundred feet above
the sea. â¢ .
Looking from the bluff the view is su
perb. In the north .he foothillsâ the
Santa Lucia range â make an effective
background, gradually sloping into Point
Duma, -which constitutes the northwest
ern boundary of the bay. '"..{'
On the other hand, the beautiful curve
ends in Point Vincent. To the west of
Point Vincent lies Catalina Island, usual
ly clear and distinct. Occasionally, how
ever, the sea mist or haze or setting sun,
and possibly a combination of these
causes, bring about a transformation and
you seem to see a castle with rampart
and turrets.
On exceptionally clear days glimpses
ran be had of Santa Barbara Island,
sixty miles away.
The rtrst sale of lots in Santa Monica
was made in 1875, and while the city's
growth has always been steady, the past
few years has seen material progress.
Now the population numbers sr,no i which
in the summer season increases 1
or 10.000.
In 1886 the Arcadie Hotel was built, and
since that time, several hotels of smaller
size, wiih numerous handsome boarding
houses, have asked their share of public
patronage, sure of being: filled during the
summer, and. besides this, Santa Mon
ica has her friends among the Eastern
tourists, and increasing numbers of them
are coming every year to spend the winter
here, where they can write back to their
snowbound friends startling reports of
gathering flowers, eating strawberries,
and bathing daily in the Pacific Ocean.
The temperature of our bay varies scarce
ly ten degrees during the year and bath
ing in the surf is a popular diversion
every month in the year.
The Arcadie Hotel has its own bath
house and pavilion, while North Beach
has its magnificent new bathhouse, equip
ped with all modern conveniences, its
r> unge being 50 by 160 feet in size, with
all necessary adjuncts for athletic ac-
2 uat iâ¢ s Ports. This bathhouse can care
for 9000 patrons a day. and during the
summer months is often taxed to its ut
most capacity.
Our city government is vested in a
Board of Trustees, which now consists of
Messrs. Norman A. Roth, Robert C. Gil-
ll ;Â», JJ SS h X Ca m Â° and M. S. Hostctter,
with Robert F. Jones as president.

The site on which Santa Monica stands
is a portion of the San Vicente ranch
three-nuarters of which is owned by Sen
\fri a P -/ On , es and one-quarter by
Mrs. Arcadia de Baker. The ranch com
prises 32,000 acres, of which some eighth
ten thousand is tillable. This land is
rented and farmed mostly to barley, the
fcchee brothers having: 1750 acres und"r
cultivation. They have had wide ex
fhl lo^h '? nd cm P h atically declare that
mX d/Â£ not excel^ d in the State, as
high as thirty-two centals of barley to'
the acre having been raised, while the
a\ erage is from eighteen to twenty. . The
many beautiful canyons in the foothills
make charming places to drive, and ob-
J Â»fvo lv r e olnt % tor ioU y picnics, and giant
me oak and sycamore trees, with the
TasT a 5, a lUa - make them most picturesque.

In Rustic Canyon is situated the Stats
Forestry Station, on land donated to the
State by Messrs. Jones and Baker On -
account of the excellent climatic' condi
tions many valuable experiments are be
ing carried on under the experienced di
rection of J. H. Barber, in charge
under direction of the State University.
Trees, plants and seeds are experimented
with .and grown for distribution, and
much valuable data relative to the flora
of the State recorded. â¢â¢
The many, pretty cottage homes are a
prominent feature of Southern California
and especially -so of Santa Monica. In a
climate where seven-tenths (or more) of
the days can be more pleasantly enjoyed
out of doors than in, excessive house
room is only additional needless care..
And the outsidÂ«B and grounds of these
homes can be made so charming, for in
spite of the salt sea breezes all plant life
grows luxuriantly here, some of the moro
dolicate flowers especially. â .
Fuchsias attain a wonderful growth and

Heliotrope, that most delicate "f Bow
ers, is in blossom ;u all times of y<-ar, and
nowâ the middle of Januaryâ is especially
beautiful. One bush particularly, that
we can show, is ten feet high and rilled
with bloom.
While no specialty Is. made of fruit it
grows well. Oranges attain good size and
are of One Savor. The few lemon or
chards that \vÂ» n- planted almost as an
experiment sin- successful beyond the
most sanguine hopes 'â :" the owners. Ba
nanas are grown here, more as a pleas
ing experiment, however, than any value
atached to it. And small fruits are won
derfully prolific.
The summer season brings an Influx of
visitors from all over this State, with a
large contingent from Arizona and New
Mexico, and then the days are scarcely
lons enough for the gayetles planned.
Besides the usual routine i>f bathing,
dancinpr. driving and other everyday di
vers:..- Â» the rummer brings a regular
programme of â ports, chief and usually
firs; among them comes the annual tennis
tournament, which always bring* a crowd
of Its devotees and arouses mu< h local
and enthusiasm, for Santa Monica
has always produced a champion or two
to uphold her honor in this popular grume.
Lately golf has claimed a share of pop
ular favor, and extensive links have been
laid out and an enthusiastic club formed.
' >r,i- of the very few polo clubs in Cali
fornia has its headquarters here and
tliT-o'ich the season meets In most excit
ing combat. Occasionally a horse and
rider go down with a crash, sometlm â¢<
\<-r. but the plucky players d
to mind it much, and as nothing
us than a broken bone or two
baa ever resulted, it has not dampened
their ardor in the game.
In September comes the annual hor?*
given by the Polo Club, which ar.>
always largely attended. All through
the season are given open air con
usually twice each week by some â¢
ent brass band engaged by the different
interests. On the edge of the bluff a band
stand and seats lkTe provided, and this
proves an attraction to manr
i-rom the band stand north, for three
blocks, along the bluff, the eitv is layli c
out a park. Here is a pleasant walk un-
der the large trees, while alternating fan
and date palms align Queen avenue.
Beds of flowers and of curious cacti have
been planted. l .
Three railroads have their terminus
here, the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific and
the Pasadena and Pacific â  Electric â¢ line.
Through the summer months cars arrive
and depart every fifteen minutes, and are
crowded to the utmost capacity. This
winter the open air concerts have been
continued and prove a drawing 1 card on
every pleasant Sunday.
Probably the most notable feature at.
Santa Monica is the mammoth wharf
called Port Los Angeles, built 'by the
Southern Pacific Railroad at. a cost of a
million dollars. It was finished in 1893,
and Is 4720 feet long. The approach is
3120 feet long by 20 feet wide. The main
part of the wharf is tin feet long and 130
feet wide at the end. On the north side
are coal bunkers 81G feet long, M feet
high and 36 feet wide, with a capacity of
12,000 tons. It Is divided into four de
partments With 67 chutes. At the end of
the bunkers is the engine room and power
house containing .the necessary powerful
machinery. Opposite the bunkers are the
depot and restaurant. At all times the
wharf is a busy, interesting place, and
when some of the many foreign ships that
touch there are in port it is doubly so.
Along one side of the wharf a footpath is
partitioned off, and here the uisciples of
Izaals .Walton congregate with hook and

There are eight of the large barracks
and numerous othf-r buildings. Including
the hospital and annex, the administra
tion building, the new assembly hall and
library, the laundry and engine-house
and others, besides the residences of
the governor of the home and other of
ficials.
Governor Andrew J. Smith is in charge
of this branch of the National Home, and
he has the intensr of his charges at
heart. Many innovations hav<> been in
troduced fur their welfare. His adminis
trative capability is working needed re
forms.
of necessity the hospital is a center of
Interest, for with the increasing age and
Infirmities of the home numbers, it is
only a Question of a short time when
thi- \vhole institution must come un
der this department. N*.)\v there are
lit-nts in the hospital and annex.
With flÂ» more for daily- treatment, and
more lof-m must be afforded. Dr. Hasse
is surgeon-ln-charge, with a force of
three asslstani physicians, twenty-seven
male rim', six female nurses.
AtnoiiK thÂ« hospital inmates are a num
most Interesting cases. One. Jack
Turkington. a Maine man. is the oldest
man enrolled here. He is ;'7 y^ars old.
Another man is totally blind, and
yei to him is intrusted the delicate opera
tion of sharpening surgical Instruments,
for his sense of touch is marvelous.
Governor Smith has also instituted ac
ceptable changes in the burial services,
which are conducted with full military
honors.
The roll of members shows 14 survivors
of the war of ISI2. and 119 of the Mexican
wax, the balance from the Civil war.
The new Shaw memorial hall is nearly
completed, which contains an auditorium
to seat MX), with convenient stage ad
juncts. All entertainments are to be free
to the members of the Home.
The headquarters building contains the
offices of the Governor; also of the Treas
urer, Major F. K. L'pham, and the Quar
termaster. Captain E. J. Rising.
The library contains 192Â« volumes and
many magazines and newspapers. The
supply, however, is not equal to the de
mand, for there are many readers among
the Home members. The percentage of
illiteracy is very small. The Home has
two chaplains, the Rev. J. M. Merlin
jones. Episcopal, and Father Hawe,
Catholic. Besides, tho other denomina
tions hold services. All are very well at
tended.
The grounds are laid out in artistic
form, witli broad walks and drive ways.,
Much handsome shrubbery is growing.
The new water supply is contracted to
furnish ivxt.ftfo gallons per day. ,â¢
Visitors are at all times welcome and
â¢very courtesy is extended to them.
Particularly interesting is the garden,
where is grown nearly the whole vege
table'produce consumed. Last year 97.00")
pounds of onions were used. This one
item may give some idea of the extent
of the agricultural part of this work.
Small fruits and berries have been ex
tensively planted, and lemons, oranges
and figs in plenty are in bearing.
Thirty-two cows supply the necessary
milk, and the supply of pork is also
raised on the grounds.
The engine-room contains machinery
of enormous power, which performs nu
merous duties, among them being the
steam-cooking system that is used in alt
the kitchens, also the electric light plant
and the power used in the manufacture
of ice.
An excellent brass band gives a con
cert every afternoon, and plays at other
stated times. Everything possible, neces
sary to the comfort and happiness of
these men, who so bravely went to their
country's aid, is done. It is a small trib-
ute. gladly given by the United States, to
its defenders.
To the south, four miles away, lies Bal
lona Lake. With its marsh lands, it cov
ers about 1200 acres. It is a source of de
light to local sportsmen, for here, in sea
son, ciimt' ducks in countless numbers,
teal, widgeon, sprig, mallard, gadwell,
redhead and the famous canvasback.
while wild geese and brant are sometimes
to be had.
All the available land has been leased
by the gun clubs, of which there ar^
three with headquarters in thrs vicinity,
the Santa Monica and the Alta, both
composed of Santa Monica men. while
the Recreation Club numbers most of its
roll from Los Angeles hunters.
Each club has its own clubhouse, boats
and necessary belongings, and the Re
creation clubhouse Is the most elabo
ratelj equipped of any in the State. It
has its billiard parlors, library and read
ing-room, its kennels and everything
mat can add to the comfort or pleasure
of it* members.
Although ;i part of Santa Monica, the
south side has its own especial interests,
nmi deserves a separate mention. The
growth here has been remarkable. The
sound of the hammer and saw Is con
stantly in the air. It has its own stores
and markets, schoolhouses and churches,
also its; own water supply. The Santa Fe
Railmad has erected a pleasure wharf at
its terminus, and a second one will be
built this spring along with the outfall
sewer.
The south side generously allows camp
ers the^ privilege of its water front, and.
through the summer months a city of
small cottages and tents fringes the wa
ter's edge.
The south side has its Nob Hill, where
its choice residence location is. A trifle
farther out are rolling fields, where, in
their season, great quantities of Cali
fornia golden poppies and dainty anemo
nes grow.
The south side. too. is the dwelling
place of Santa Monica's oldest citizen.

division, where millinery goods are
examined and appraised. All sorts of
birds and feathers are examined by
this division. Within a few days sev
eral large boxes were examined, each
containing something like 500 stuffed
paroquets. A box was opened this
week in which it was estimated there
were nearly 3000 Japanese swallows.
These little birds are caught by the
Japanese in immense numbers by
means of nets. Their plumage is very
plain, but their wings, which are ex
traordinarily long, make them especi
ally valuable to milliners. The birds
when imported are rudely stuffed with
cotton, and each one is made up into
a little roll about the size and shape of
an ordinary cigar. Before being used
they are twisted into various shapes
and dyed, the wings spread and new
feathers added, and they are made
into gay and fancy birds.
The most valuable kind of feather
goods that passes through the ap
praisers' hands Is undoubtedly the
aigrette. This feather is worth more
than its weight in gold. The aigrette
is obtained from a bird called the
egret, found in China, Japan, Egypt
and South America, and sometimes in
Florida. Some of these feathers come
directly from South America, where,
along the upper waters of the Amazon,
the Indians shoot the birds with blow
tubes and small arrows. But Paris is
the market of the world for aigrettes.
just as London is for ostrich plumes,
and the greatest part of the imports
come directly from the French capital.
Within the past two months aigrettes
to the value of $30,000 have been im
ported.
There are two varieties of the
aigrette, the long and the short, and
their value is in inverse proportion to
their size. The short variety, which is
obtained from a smaller bird. Is ex
tremely delicate and fine, and is worth
from $22 to $25 an ounce. Only a few
feathers on each bird are valuable,
and It is estimated that fifty or sixty
birds would have to be killed to obtain
an ounce of the shorter aigrette. t The
long aigrette is worth not much more
than half as much.
These feathers are looked after as
carefully by the appraisers as are
precious stones. They are imported in
soldered tin boxes, and are locked up
and guarded until they are examined.
They are invoiced in the Brazilian
unit of value, reis, which is very small,
so that figures giving the values of the
imports are often startlingly large.
One importation of these feathers was
recently invoiced to the value of
5,283,600 reis, an amout which in
American gold is equal to about $100.â

Since the institution of cotton mills
at Shanghai the wheelbarrow has
been extensively used as a passenger
vehicle, especially for carrying work
women to and from the mills. One
man can wheel six women for a dis
tance of about three miles, morning
and evening, the charge being Is 5d
per month. The average earnings of a
wheelbarrow-man are about S^d per
day. About 4000 licenses are issued
monthly to the same number of wheel
barrows plying for hire in the street*
of the foreign settlements at Shang
hai, where, being under the municipal
regulations, they are. perhaps, the best
in China. Sometimes as many as fifty
barrows may be seen in the streets,
traveling one behind the other, each
carrying two barrels of English Port
land cement and pushed by one man.
Very frequent! y a load is carried on one
side of the barrow only, and it is ex
traordinary to see a Chinaman skill
fully balancing and propelling it. The
upsets and accidents are remarkably
few, when it is considered that about
4000 of these vehicles are in use in the
streets, in addition to a large traffic of
other kinds.

TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS
OF
CALIFORNIA
AT last the day has arrived in
San Francisco when the idea
that the study of cooking and
sewing is as important and
should be placed on an equality
with all the other branches of
â work in cur public schools is
steadily gaining ground. Let us hope
that it will spread throughout the
State. To be sure, we have as yet only
eight schools in the city where these
two branches of study are included in
the regular course, but it may be safe
ly prophesied that at the beginning of
the new school year many of th^ other
grammar pchonls will have fallen into
line.
Some of the principals are inclined to
pooh-pooh the scheme, asserting that
the girls should learn such domestic
arts at home; but how are they to be
taught when the mothers, especially
among the poorer classes, have little
or no time to impart systematic train-

ing, even if in many respects they are
not woefully ignorant themselves?
There are no children in our schools,
no matter what their social position or
future circumstances, who will regret
their cultivation of these most useful
branches. The placing <>f these sub
jects in the school course is a distinct
&d vantage, since it tends to elevate
them in the eyes of the children, and
rio away with a certain amount <>f
disgrace which is often attached to
them by the latter.
Some five years ago Mr. Kennedy,

board's consent engaged Miss Kate

Toomy. who has attended Pratt Ins*ii
tute and taken a course in chemistry
at the Lowell High School, is placed in
charge of the cooking classes of the
seventh and eighth grade pupils in the
Broadway and Hancock grammar
schools, and in the Adams Cosmopoli
tan. Miss Paxton teaches cooking in
the Franklin, Rincon and John Swett
grammar schools, while Miss Coyle has
charge of the work in the Denman aVid
Clement. Altogether there are about
1015 girls in the combined classes of the
eight schools. At present there are
only fiv^ cooking outfit's, which necessi
tates considerable "doubling up" of
classes. It is to be hoped that in the
near future the number of class rooms
especially fitted up for teaching cook
ing will be materially increased. The
"work of the seventh grades generally
averages two hours a week, and that of
the eighth from an hour to an hour
and a half a week.
Miss Tocmy is an excellent teacher
and creates in her pupils an intense mi
i :. st in their work. At th? beginning
of the course the children were given
short talk- on the composition ol foods,
their v.lue and practical use in plain
cooking. The blackboards are covered
with charts aid tables for irÂ«*m*ra: ref
erence, such as time =>nd teint-Vrature
for oak':!/, boiling;, broiling, -tc. For
recipes Mrs. Lincoln's cookbook is
largely used. â¢
After a general talk on foods, the
subjects of fuels and five or six of the
most important elements were dis
cussed. Then followed in turn simple
lessons on preparing and cooking pota
toes, vegetables, cereaN pud
dings, beverages, meats: lessons in
baking, broiling, preparing fisti and
using up "left overs."
In the Hancock School a number of
the gas fixtures were furnished free
by one company, and the flour, spices,
etc are kindly contributed by certain
grocery firms.

ing: class of this school are of foreign
parentage, and their superstitions and
ideas on cooking in general are often
amusing. Their teacher was solemnly
informed that fish kept in the moon
light would spoil, and this she found
to be really true. The children also de
clare that the eating of fish makes
brains. When asked what to do to save
the "eyes while peeling onions seven or
eight voices piped up: 'Hold a pin in
your mouth:" one little girl timidly
asked if "consecrated" milk was to be
used in a certain soup: while another,
who had been instructed to write a
short composition on the advantages
of her own study of cookery, averred
that it had been of great benefit, be
cause it enabled her to help her mother
cook her father's "vitals" every day.
"When asked what people were noted for
their use of oats, a third child, who
probably lived in front of a sign
covered fence, replied, "The Quakers!-"
In the Franklin School, where Miss
Paxton, a graduate of the Philadel
phia Cooking School, of which Miss
Rorer is president, proves such a cap
able and interesting teacher, being
thorough mistress of every department
of her work, the following sentiments
hang framed on the wall:
"What Does Cooking Mean?"
"It means the knowledge of Medea
and Circe, of Calypso and of Helen,
and of Rebekah and the Queen of
Sheba.
"It means the knowledge of all herbs
and fruits, and balms and spices, and
of all that is healing and sweet in the
fields and groves and savory in meats.
â It means Inventiveness and willing
ness, and watchfulness, and readiness
of appliance: it means the economy of
your grandmothers and the science of
modern chemists. It means much tast
ing and no wasting.
"It means English thoroughness,
French art and Arabian hospitality;
and in fine it means that you are to be
perfectly and always ladles' loaf
givers, and you are i.> see that every
one has something nice to eat.
"J<Â»HN KI'SKIX."
Miss Paxton uses Mrs. Rorer's cook
book in her work, which she has so ar
ranged that each child takes part in
turn. Miss Paxton has herself prepared
a typewritten course of study with
rules and recipes attached. During
each lesson one of the latter is copied
in the pupils' notehooks and then dem
onstrated before the class. In review
the scholars without aid demonstrate
some lesson previously learned.
COOKING CLASSES.
CERTAINLY no more interesting
spectacle can be witnessed than
at the Franklin Grammar School
at Eighth and Harrison streets during
the hours for Instruction In <â¢<Â«. kin^.
In the whole school there are 12". schol
ars, all girls, in this course. These are
divided into classes of about twenty
five each. All are equipped with
aprons, armlets and holders, and the
elementary classes are regularly drill
ed in the Mes "t th.se attachments.
Step by step the pupil advances, be
ginning with Instruction in the most
elementary principles and the more
simple preparations of food, and end
ing with those more elaborate dishes
in which a good housekeeper delights
t<> display her accomplishments as a
r< M,k. As the staple article or food, in
the ordinary family, is meat, the pupil
is carefully drilled in, first, the selec
ti'in, and afterward, cooking. LÂ«es
sons are Riven in the anatomy of beef
and carefully drawn pictures are dis
played with each part duly labeled and
from this pictorial representation the
pupil learns all that can be imparted
about the different qualities which
each portion of the carcass affords.
The chemical constituents of each
class of the food supply is carefully
impressed into the minds of the pupils,
thus combining the scientific with the
practical. The wholesome onion is
largely composed of sulphur and the
carrot combines Iron in an appreciable
degree, and thus in every other impor
tant article of consumption their in
gredients and effects are learned.
"Eggs should always be cooked at a
low temperature, otherwise they are
indigestible." w;is 'me of the opinions

dispensation was obtained, and he was
elected. On the night of his installation
he conferred the second degree in a man
subject of demonstration of the lesson.
Eggs boiled, fried, baked, made into
omelets, poached and sauces of eggs.
Each pupil sat at her desk taking down
the clear and concise directions of the
teacher. This done questions were
asked showing how carefuliy this part
of the lesson had been performed. Then
the demonstrations began. The tem
perature of the fire, conditions and
choice of the implements, proportions
of the ingredients, were all ascertained.
Few understand how to break an egg
so as not to mix the yolk with the
white, or how to beat the white into the
snowy mass that is so delightful to eye
and palate. Through every move of
the pupil the injunction "to be clean"
is always and forever dictated. One
learns that a spoonful of sugar and
pepper are entirely different quantities.
Exact directions are followed relative
to the using of the different ingredi
ents, the time in cooking and even to
the manipulation of the mixture and
the proper handling of the spoons and
forks. Each direction is given with ex
actitude and with a positive certainty
that absolute results will surely follow.
The breathless interest with which this
class of girls followed the development
Of each effort was delightful and satis
fying and proved that to learn was not
necessarily drudgery. The lesson was a
success, and every dish turned out as
sightly and appetizing as the youthful
fabricators expected.
The school department is generous In
the supply of all the paraphernalia of
the cooking class. The kitchen at the
Franklin is the highest room in the
building, and is provided with the
latest improvements in ranges, gas
stoves and implements from a stew pan
to an egg beater. Everything is beau
tifully dean and in sharp contrast to
many homes of the poor. To prove how
general among families is the benefit
arising from education in cooking, the
teacher asked a number of pupils to re
late how they applied the instructions
received at school to their home life.
"I boiled the potatoes to-day," said
little Bertha Fleming. Rachael Isaacs,
a pretty miss of 12 years, had made an
omelet and cream potatoes for break
fast. Flora Kan, Alice Sprigel, Lottie
Meyer and a dozen others had each
demonstrated at home their capacity
for sharing with their families their
school accomplishments. Miss Lottie
Townker is admitted by all the class as
the best cook In It.
SEWING CLASSES.
IT was in 1893 that the principal of
the Franklin Grammar School. Mr.
Kennedy, received permission from
the Board Of Education to introduce
sewing into his course as an ex-
periment. Mrs. Kennedy was ap

ninth. Finally sewing was also taught
to the very smallest girls, and this plan
hasted for two years. At the end of this
time Mr. Kennedy addressed 300 circu
lars to the parents of the girls, which
read as follows:
"Mrs. : At the beginning of the
school year of 1593 the Board of Educa
tion introduced sewing into the Framk
lln School as an experiment. We would
be pleased to have you express your
opinion of the work accomplished.
"1. Has the introduction of sewing
been an assistance to your daughter in
performance of her domestic duties?
"2. Has the introduction of sewing
proved an important factor in the de
velopment in your daughter of habits
of neatness and order?
"3. Are you in favor of teaching sew
ing in the public schools? If so, why?"
All these questions were unanimously
answered in the affirmative, and "Be
cause she fixes her etothes" was a fair
sample of anspvers to the latter part of
the third question.
Beginning with the use of needle,
thread and thimble the girls were
taught the different stitches, and then
in turn patching, mending, drafting
and cutting of simple garments, and
then the finer stitches, and more elab
orate making of underwear and dresses
in the upper grades. Together with ail
this came lessons on the kinds of
needles to use, how to keep them from
rusting, the quality of material to buy
and the different kinds for different
purposes. When the girls first did
their own shopping cheap and poor
material was palmed off upon them,
but after Mrs. Kennedy's lessons on
the subject such cheating never hap
pened twice.
The result of all this teaching had
a wonderful effect upon the clothes of
the pupils. There was a regular stock
ing clay, dresses were patched, aprons
stripped off and mended, and shoe but
tons appeared as if by magic in the
places they had long forsworn. One
little girl begged permission to brine;

The advantages of this study were
shown, not only during the school life
of the pupils, but afterward, for, al

THE NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
It was a subject of remark at the grand
reception by the Native Daughters on
last Tuesday afternoon and evening, in
Native Sons 1 Hall, in the parlors of which
Miss Minnie Klevesahl of La Estrella
Parlor, the queen of the Jubilee, attired
in her robes of state, received those who
came to pay her court, that only one of
the parlors was distinguishable from the
others by a distinctive badge, and that
was Fremont Parlor, the members of
which wore a neat and artistically ar
ranged small bow of red. white, blue and
orange ribbon. It was pretty and very
attractive.
THE NATIONAL UNION.
Last Tuesday night Golden Gate Coun
cil initiated two candidates and took the
preliminary steps to give an entertain
ment appropriate to the day on the even
ing of the 22d of February. This council
has under consideration" a proposition to
start a reserve fund by setting aside
quarterly a small sum for use in case of
emergency.
THE AMERICAN GUILD.
San Francisco Chapter of the American
Guild, at its meeting in Balboa Hall. N&
ond to the ninth are taken. The rooms
are suitably furnished with low tablea
and chairs, and each child makes her
self a red sewing baj, on which hep
number and initials are etched.
Some of the work done by these pu
pils, most of them under 15 years,' is
remarkable. In the fifth grade they
begin with the making of small gar
ments â either for dolls or small broth
ers and sisters. They learn the differ
ent kinds of seams, how to gather even
ly, to patch, darn tears and the vari
ous methods of catch-stitching, felling,
hemstitching, bias-binding and the like.
Later undergarments are made, sim
ple dresses cut and fitted and a little
embroidery and drawn work taken up.
Along with these lessons the teachers
give talks on the raising ef cotton, the
manufacture of wool, the use of the
spinning jenny, and during the fair
called the children's attention especial
ly to the weaving done there. At the
end of the first year no one repeats the"
mistake of the little girl who said that
Abraham Lincoln invented the cotton
gin, and when the definition of "sel
vage" is asked no one answers a sec
ond time, "It's when you have a whole
lot of nice things and keep 'em all to
yourself."
The expense to the Board of Educa
tion is light. It furnishes needles,
thread, scissors and darners, and per
haps a bolt of cotton on which to
learn. But the rest of the material is
entirely furnished by the pupils them
selves. Flour sacks come in especially
handy, and in one school a hundred
neat little hemstitched handkerchiefs
were made out of some salt sacks. In
most of the schools the sloyd work, or
samp'ers. is disliked by the children,
who wish to make something which can
be used. In the Rincon Grammar and
Horace Mann there arc 4?,0 girls each,
these bÂ£ing the largest classes in sew
ing. In the Irvii^ Scott the girls were
so eager preparing for the exhibit
which took place just at Christmas
time that for three weeks before they
begged for extra time, often arriving
in the early morning- before the teacfter
li^rself. One girl, hitherto noticeably
indolent, was completely change 1 by
her sewing lessons. After she hid com
pleted her first garment she v>'>uhl
come to school at 8 o'clock in order to
.get a few moments in which to sew
before schooltime, as the work is not
allowed to be taken home. When the
parents saw the completed sewing at
the exhibit some could not believe that
it was really the work of their chil
dren. One lady grasped the teacher's
hand and said: "Oh, you are doing
such a splendid work here! Thank you
so much for what you have done for
my daughter;"
This sentiment is re-echoed by pa
rents in all the schools. The doubtful
ones become almi.-st as enthusiastic as
the girls themselves when they see for
themselves the work which their chil
dren have accomplished. Many moth
ers declare that they wish they them
selves might learn to sew as well.
It was Lillie Bjorn < f Bryant street.
a child 11 years, who took the second
}>rize of $15 offered by the recent doll
snow at the Palace Hotel for the best
handmade doll suit by a girl under 15.
Lillie Is a pupil of Mrs. Graef at the
Columbia, where she has been studying
sewing only two years. Her costume
was composed of six pieces of delicate
white lawn, with drawn work, feather
stitching, hemstitched ruffles and lace.
This work took her just a year to com
plete in school.

ing arrangements to give a social in the
course of a few weeks for the entertain
ment of its friends.

IMPROVED ORDER OF RED MEN.

EASTERN MARKETS.
XEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.â At the opening the
' stock market to-day looked as though the or
ders accumulated by commission houses to sell
and take profits. First sales were very gen
erally at a fraction below last night's prices
and 2000 shares of New York Central thrown
from the market drove the price of that stock
down %. The market steadied almost imme
diately and recovered gradually to above last
night's level, net gains being, however, un
equal. Lake Shore was most conspicuous, ris
ing 6'<Â» points, 194%, on the reported plan to ex
change $200,000 of New York Central 3 per cent
debenture bonds for $100,000 of Lake Shore
stock. New York Central ultimately tended
strongly upward after wavering somewhat.
There was also some taking of profits on the
advance due to doubts as to how far the stock
would be allowed to benefit from Lake Shore's
â  surplus earnings, which, It was rumored,
would be applied to a sinking fund for the
bonds issued In payment.
Pacific preferred continued to advance on
well defined rumcrs that an additional dividend
. . Is in prospect. D. & R. G. preferred and a
number of less prominent stocks showed no
table gains. These elements of strength served
to sustain the market and to counteract some
of the tendency to sluggishness and heaviness
Â»T 10 the general line, so that net gains were
achieved in most stocks, though they are
small outside the special cases mentioned.
Quotations from London this morning shuwed
Borne depression In the market for Americans
there, which was attributed to the apprehen
sion awakened In the British mind by yester
day's vote on the Teller resolution.
The week opened with a continued tendency
toward a reaction and the hesitating tone in
the dealings on Monday gave way to very pos
itive weakness upon the announcement that
the Maine had been ordered to Havana. This
sharp decline seemed to clear the speculative
situation by giving the shorts an opportunity
to cover and by shaking out the weaker nar
row margined holdings, who were regarded as
a menace to the success of any movement for
an advance.. The week's statements of rail
road earnings have been, as. a rule, very favor
able, notably Northern Pacific and Pennsyl
vania, published to-day, the latter being re
garded as an especially reliable Index of the
country's railroad business. All of the secu
rities of the Kansas and Texas Company hare
been very strong during the week on the im
proved financial condition shown by reports tor
the year thus Car
The bull operators made use of reports In an
ticipation of the President's 1 peed! on Thurs
day niÂ£ht and some of Friday' Helling was
due to realizing upon the delivery -of tile
speech. The market's advance was helped
very materially by the large buying for Lon
don account on Tuesday and Wednesday, but
the almost equally heavy selling on the suc
ceeding days from the same source made it
- evident that , the speculation was only for a
.. short turn.
The tone of the money market worked easier,
â  notwithstanding the withdrawal from banks
of the first 10 per cent Installment of the Gov
ernment deposits of Union Pacific payments.
It is evident also that the Increasing abund
ance of the money and ease of rates Ist all
that prevents larger imports of gold, as the
supply of exchange is constantly increasing
and rates for money in London and Uerlin
are again hardening.
With sales of bonds for the week of a par
valuo of over $26,000,000, business In that de
partment of the exchange exceeds all prevlou>
records both for a week anil for a month on
the business thus far In the month.
The extreme gains have been somewhat re
duced by pront-taklnc but prices are , ma
-. terially higher on the week.

THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.
NEW YORK. Jan. 29.â The Financier says:
The statement of the Associated Banks for
j the week ending: January 29, whils It does not
I show the enormous Increases of the previous
j week, indicates that money Is still flowing
heavily to this center. The gain In cash for
j the week was $6.337.10<>, of which nearly $2,500,
j 000 was specie. The latter represents Western
j receipts to a large extent, following Australian
remittances. The Increase In deposits amount
ing to $3,011,400 tied up over $2,000,000 of the
. cash received, so that the surplus reserve Is
i only $4,334,200 heavier than one week ago.
I There is no doubt that the expansion of $2,395,
j OOu in loans reflects legitimate mercantile and
| stock exchange transactions, Instead of special
! operations and the technical manipulations,
| such as have been in evidence since the Union
Pacific sale. The loan Increase 18 scattered
through a larger list of banks than usual. It
is worthy of note that the bank which has
! been most prominent In financing the Union
'â â¢ Pacific deal reduces its loans $4,000,000, follow
â  Ing the retirement of overdue currency sixes
held by the Treasury on its account against
1 deposits. All the special depository banks paid
to the Treasury 10 per cent of their hold
ings last week; otherwise the gain In cash
would have been heavier.
As It is, the deposit items of the banks do
ing the largest business with interior banks
show the highest percentage of gains.
: The future. In view of the continued piling
up of Idle money in New York, appears to fa
vor easier money. It should not be forgotten,
however, that considerable of the surplus cash
In banks belongs to the Treasury, and Is sub
ject to its withdrawal. The commercial de
mands are also heavier, and whereas the loans
of the banks during January. IM7, remained
Stationary, while the surplus reserve Increased
$26,000.0C0, the loans in the same period this
year have expanded 118,000,000, while the ex
cess cash shows a gain of $20,000,000. Thus,
while the supply is in excess of demand, the
latter Is lmmeasureably more pronounced than
at the beginning of last year. It is difficult to
see, however, where the hope of a much firmer
money market this season finds foundation.
If Interest rates go beyond a defined line, gold
imports must follow. The exchange situation
Is now under strong control, but some Inter
esting developments In the way of unseasona
ble international transference might be pos
sible.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 29.â Wheat showed some
strength at the opening, principally because
Liverpool had responded fairly well to yes- ]
| terday's advance here. Holders of lines al- j
j ready heavy were good bidders at the start,
which was at 97>>iCrP74c for May, an advance of
'if/*ic. A good deal was for sale at those
I prices, but the selling did not depress the
price lower than 97c, and shortly after a gen
eral buying movement set In. which carried
the price up to 83c. That advance, however,
raised a short selling breeze of such strength
that In half an hour the advance had melted
i away, the decline not stopping until May was
down to 96% c. The heavy dumping of lung
lines late yesterday made many traders afraid
to rliÂ«k their money In wheat at prices above
I 97c. and this fact had a good deal to do with
| augmenting the liquidation which carried
i prices down. Most of the routine news was
bullish. Bradctreet's made the week's clear
! ances of wheat and flour from both coast* 5,
| 110.624 busfieU. compared with 3.925.000 bush
i els the previous week, and 2,515,000 bushels the
corresponding week of last year. The total
i receipts at Western primary markets were
1 324.000 bushels, against 205.000 bushels the year
I before. The day's clearances from Atlantic
; ports were heavy, amounting In wheat and
j flour to 695.000 bushels. This latter item in
, jected temporary strength Into the market, but
It soon fell back again under renewed offer
ings. Shortly before the close the market
was given support, Lelter brokers being cred
ited with good buying at the bottom figures,
and May advanced to 96"ic, where it closed. -
Corn was barely steady. May closed 'Â«''
lower.
Oats were firm at the start, but became weak
later on realizing. May closed 'Â«c lower.
Provisions were very dull and prices kept
within exceptionally narrow range. The close
was unchanged from yesterday.

THE DOG'S BARK.
As to barking, there are a great number
of different sorts of harks, the meaning
of each of which is well known.
For example, there is the barking
which at night is meant to call master's
attention to the iact that some burglar
or other evil-doer is hovering around the
premises. When I heur my Landeeer
Newfoundland or my splendid St. Bernard
giving warning in this way 1 turn on my
other side, and do but sleep the sounder,
well knowing that no evil-doer would
dare to enter my premises or even my
grounds. Some years ago every house in
Twyford was entered by burglars except
my own. With jimmiesthey had already
opened a lower window of my villa, when
they had to fly. The bark ofwarning has
doubtless descended through long genera
tions from the d.ays when wild dogs hunt
ed in packs, and it was then as useful in
recalling siragglers as the bugle of a regi
ment.
Next, there is the bark of joy, when
a dog. fur instance, meets again a kind
and loving muster, who may have been
absent fur a few days. No mistaking
this. It is the bark of pleasure and ex
citement. Sometimes mv beautiful St.
Bernard, "Fair Helen of' Troy," mingles
a little friendly scolding with this, for
after licking my cheeks and ears she
bai ks astern, and with her head cocked
funnily to one side, barks me a lecture.
"Why didn't you tak<- me with you?"
she seems to say. "It was cruel, and I've
been wretched all the time. But I'm
happy now. Don't ever, ever leave your
Helen again."â Gordon Stables, in " the
January Our Animal Friends.
COST OF RUSSIAN CORONATIONS.
Alexander 111 was parsimonious. On
his deathbed he advised his son to lo
strictly economical. His own corona
tion, he said, had only cost 13,000.000
rubles ($6,500,000), but the coronation
expenses ought to be and could be fur
ther reduced, to 7,000,000 rubles. Ni
cholas II has preferred, on the con
trary, to squander on that unfortunate
display more than 60.000,000 rubles ($30,
000.000), taken from the already over
burdened state budget.
Strict economy in state expendit ne
was the rule during the previous reign,
and this must be said of Alexander 111,
that he succeeded in putting an end
to the wholesale plundering of Russia
which was going on during the second
half of Alexander ll's rule: he undoubt
edly created a certain atmosphere of
honesty iti the management of the
state's moneys. Under the present Czar
the watchword is, on the contrary:
"Do just as you like! Steal, and plun
der, but don't worry me!"â Prince Kra
potkin in The Outlook.

VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION
A Necessary Supplement
to a General Culture
Course.
Professor Brown Discusses an
Interesting Pedagogical
Problem.
The Need of Improving Present
Methods of Teaching Reading
Emphasized.
Professor Elmer K. Brown of the de
partment of Pedagogy at the Univers
ity of California, in the third of a series
of talks on secondary education yester
day, emphasized the need of a course
of vocational training to supplement
and round out a college course in gen
eral culture. In his remarks, Profes
por "Brown said:
"In a strictly unified educational
system all the work of the grammar
school -would lead directly to the high
school, and all the work of the high
school would lead directly to the uni
versity. Is such a system possible? In
early secondary schools there was a
common foundation in the elementary
pr-hool. The high school offered several
different courses â one, the classical,
leading to the university, and the
others ending with the secondary
schools. A question that is being asked
n<>w is, 'Should every high school
course have a university course cor
related to it and a continuation of it?'
At present a larger part of the high
pchool courses than formerly reach to
the college. To have a fully unified
system, a university course correspond
ing to each high school course, the col
lege entrance requirements must be
broadened and the weak high school
courses strengthened. The question
whether there should be a university
course corresponding to each high
school course is an important and un
settled pedagogical question. Should
there be a college course, for instance,
corresponding: to the present high
school commercial course? The mis
understandings that have arisen in dis
cussing the problem are due in large
measure to the failure properly to dis
tinguish between vocational ajid gen
eraJ culture education. Our colleges of
letters and social science are properly
colleges of general culture. Our courses
in agriculture, chemistry, engineering
and medicine are essentially vocational.
The Lick School and the Commercial
High School of San Francisco are ex
amples of vocational secondary schools.
"Too little importance is at present
attached to vocational education. We
have been afraid of substituting vo
cational learning for general culture,
and this fear is well grounded. But
there is an absolute and pressing need
of training every individual for some
vocation. For the vast majority of
people the course of education is not
completed till it has been rounded out
with strictly w>oational training.
"Below the nigh-school grade voca
tional education is not desirable. If
all children were able to go beyond the
high school, I would be opposed to vo
cational training in the high school.
But many cannot go beyond
or even through the high school,
and hence the necessity for vo
cational training in the high school.
"A good commercial college is need
ed in the community, although I be
lieve the course of such a college should
be strengthened."
Professor Brown resumed his histor
ical survey of secondary education in
America, tracing its evolution from
its first form, the Colonial grammar
school, into its secondary and transi
tional form, the academy of the early
part of the present century.
Mr. T. L. Heaton continued his crit
icisms upon reading as at present
taught in the public schools. He said,
among other things:
"The work of the first two years at
school should consist largely of read
ing. At present too much time is spent
in reading subjects which children do
not understand. It is not sufficient
that the child should be given practice
merely in articulation and pronuncia
tion â he should read understanding^-.
There is such a thing as reading arith
metic, reading an example. The read
ing of an example should not be a mere
mumbling of words, but there should
be emphasis, intelligently placed upon
the important things in the example,
the things given and the thing or
things to be determined. So it is with
geography, history and grammar: until
the pupil can read well he cannot un
derstand well. It is of the utmost im
portance, therefore. that reading
should be thoroughly taught in the
lower grades, in order that other stu
dies may be intelligently studied in the
grades above.
"Punctuation marks are not pauses
in reading, as many still think The
punctuation marks indicate grammati
cal relations, and, while these gram
matical pauses often coincide with the
pauses in the reading, teachers should
be careful not to allow pupils to pause
in the reading every time they encoun
ter a punctuation mark. To assist the
pupils of the lower grades in learning
to pronounce letters and syllables the
letters should be marked phonetically
and the children made familiar with
these phonetic marks "
OPPOSED TO REDUCTIONS
Merchants' Association figainst
Cutting Down the Local
Postal Service.
The proposed reduction of the postal
carrier service in this city and otherwise
crippling the postofflce department was
one of the principal subjects of discussion
at the meeting of the Merchants' Asso
ciation yesterday. The proposed reduc
tions were bitterly opposed by the mem
bers. As a result, the following resolu
tions were adopted and the secretary in-
Ftructed to forward copies to the Post
master General and the California mem
bers of Congress:
Whereas, Information reaches us that
there may be some failure on the part of
Congress- to appropriate sufficient mon
eys to meet the present wants of the pos
tal service; and, whereas, we believe, bas
ing our belief upon personal knowledge
and reliable Information, that a failure
to provide sufficient funds to meet the
needs of the service will necessitate cer
tain reductions and curtailments which
In our judgment, would be detrimental to
the interests of this community and not
compatible with the times; and. whereas
It is the belief of this body that the pos
tal facilities of the country should be in
creased rather than diminished; therefore
be it
Resolved. Th.it In our Judgment the
pest Interests of the community require
that the amounts asked of Congress for
the maintenance of the postal service, as
per estimates made by the First Assistant
Postmaster-General In his last annual
report, should be allowed
Resolved, That we ask our Delegation
Congress to use Its best Influence and
exertion to secure the appropriation of
sufficient moneys to conduct the postal
service without deficiency or reduction.
JUDGE AND LAWYER DISAGREE.
Mas the Former the Right to Dis- j
bar the Latter?
Has a Judge of the Superior Court the
right to disbar an attorney? This is a i
question that will have to be settled by j
the Supreme Court within the next few j
days. It was raised yesterday by an ap- j
plication by ex-Judge E. V. Spencer for j
a writ of prohibition to restrain Superior |
Judge F. A. Kelly of Lassen County |
from pursuing contempt of court proceed- !
ings against the petitioner. A short time
ago the Matthew Haley estate case was
before Judge Kelly, and Spencer made a
motion for a new trial. Accompanying j
his motion was an affidavit, which he
filed, setting forth that be believed that
the Judge had been influenced and im
properly persuaded in favor by counsel ;
for the' opposite side. Also that W. N. j
Goodwin, the counsel referred to. had ar- ;
gued the case before the Judge in pri
vate and in the Judge's chambers, so that j
a fair presentation of the matter was j
not had.
This affidavit aroused the anger of
Judge Kelly, and he cited Spencer to ap- '
pear before him in court on February 1 \
and show cause why he should not be
disbarred. The attorney does not propose
to submit to any such proceedings, and
he filed a petition for a writ of prohibi- j
tion. He contends that the Judge of a
Superior Court has no jurisdiction in dis
barment proceedings: that no cause for
disbarment has hpen shown, and last,
that Judge Kelly has no jurisdiction lnas- j
much as he cannot assume the dual posi- !
tion of prosecutor and Judge of the case, i
GLENBEIGH ATE
POISONED MEAT
What Dr. Creely Found in the
Stomach of the Famous
Pointer.
Howard Vernon Is Now Hot on the
Trail of the Poison
Fiend.
Member? of the Pacific Coast FipM
Trial Club and the sportsmen who wit
nessed the trials at Bakersfleld, just com
pleted, regret very much that the fam
ous pointer. Glenbeigrh. which was poi
soned a few days before the commence
ment of the trials, was not alive when
the all-aped stake was being contested.
As already stated in The Call, there
were not a few people who thought that
some unfair means wore taken with the
object of disposing of the Â£rand old dog,
and it goes without saying that if the
miscreant who poisoned champion Glen
beigh be discovered he will he given ex
cellent cause to remember the field trials
Of IS9S.
It is a well known fact that the sheep
men who cast out poison for coyotes on
the plains of Bakersfield use strychnine
because of its hasty action.
Those -who scouted the idea' of the dog
having been poisoned by some wretch
who was bribed for that purpose by men
of unscrupulous and degraded minds will
be surprised to learn that chemical analy
ses by Dr. Creely and Mr. Harrington
have disclosed the fact that the dog was
poisoned by arsenic, and Dr. Creely has
stated that it may be half an hour or
two hoursâ according: to quantity â after
the dog had partaken of the meat before
he would have shown symptoms of poi
soning.
Howard Vernon, who was the owner of
Glenbeigh. intimates that he has a line
on the man who poisoned the dog,
and that if he can obtain the proof he is
now in quest of a grand expose will re
sult, which may implicate people who are
now above the remotest suspicion.
Dr. Creely has stated that he found one
single piece of poisoned meat in the
stomach of the dog. and Chemist Bar
ringrton. who had also analyzed the
stomach, reported that he found four
large pieces of poisoned meat.
Vernon fairly idolized the dog. He will
spare no expense in bringing to Justice
the person or persons who had committed
such a dastardly act. The remains of
old "Glen" were placed in a coffin and
buried within close proximity of Ver
non's residence. The skin is being mount
ed by a taxidermist.
Many of the sportsmen who were pres
ent at the trials did not hesitate to say
that Glenbeigh alive and well would have
added fresh laurels to his large Dumber
of victories by winning the all-aped
stake. His son. Alec C. who is a counter
part of the past champion of champions,
won the derby in handsome style and
should have been honored with a place

Joe Choynski is training at the Olympic
Club for his fight with "Tut" Ryan on
the evening of February 10. Ryan is at
a station near the ocean beach, and ac
cording to all accounts he is getting into
splendid shape. The knowing ones, who
are credited with picking winners, are of
the opinion that Ryan will put the Cali

Empire Club is sanguine of having a big
house when "Tut" and Joe shake hands
before the gong sounds for the start.
Tommy Ryan, who is matched by the
National Club to meet George Green will
leave Syracuse, N. V., this evening, and
the club expects to have the pleasure of

NEWS OF THE MINES.
Great Proclamation of
Several Wide-Awake
Mining Counties.
There Are Good Prospects for
the Industry in Wash
ington and Likewise
in Oil Fields.
Several of the mining counties have he
stirred themselves in an intelligent way
to reap all the benefit possible from the
great advertising opportunities of the Min
ing Fair and their big exhibits will be one
uf the chief attractions. Nevada Coun
ty has used $300 of the $2000 given by the
supervisors to publish an illustrated de
scriptive pamphlet. 1^ Is a pity that some
of the best and liveliest newer mining
sections are poorly represented, if at all.
The general central truth which Ne
vada County, with a total gold product of
$212,000,000, will keep to the front with a
wealth of detailed information attending
it Is thus expressed by the Nevada City
Transcript:
Notwithstanding the fact that no
other por ion of the world of equal
area has produced as much gold dur
ing the past forty-nine years as has
Nevada County, no other section offers
so majiy Inducements to-day for the
safe and remunerativs investment of
capital in mining. * , Â».
There are miles upon miles of rich
gold-bearing quartz and gravel depos
its that have been scarcely prospect
ed Good timber abounds on every
hand. Ditches carrying an abundance
of water for power and washing
thread their way at frequent intervals
through every district, and electric
power is supplied to many of the
mines of Nevada City and Grass Val
ley, in which districts one of the larg
est electric power companies in the
west is operating with marked success.
This can be said of a mining region in
this State nearly 1000 miles long, and the
proclaiming of it to the world is the chief
end of the great Mining Fair.
THE MINERS WAIT MORE HOPE
FULLY ON CONGRESS NOW.
Prospects gradually brighten for those
three chief matters of national legisla
tion in which California miners are inter
eg t e< 3_a department of mines and mining,
the debris dams and the mineral lands bill
âbehind all of which the active forces of
the California Miners' Association are at
w.irk.
The members of the Trans-Mlsslsslppl
Congress committee on a department of
mines failed to appear last week for the
conference called by Chairman Tlrey L.
Ford. Mr. Ford and the local commit
tee have, however, been meeting, and
an argument showing the need of a de
partment of mines will soon be printed.
Hon. Lafe Pence, of the similar commit
tee appointed by the International Gold
Miners' convention, is laboring for the
measure in Washington. The friends of
rhe measure In Congress are endeavoring
to make terms with the friends of the
measure to create a Department of Com
merce and Industry, and their trading
strength may help the cause. There Is
~very prospect that there will be a bu
reau of mines. If not a separate depart
rvnt, within a year.
The committee on dams, of the State
Association, will soon forward to Chief
if Enginers Wilson a communication ex
plaining the misunderstood relations be
tween the State and Congressional appro
priations. It seems probable that during
the year the government engineer will
ffect the gratifying progress of getting
he plans for the restraining dams ready.
HE OIL FIELDS OF CALIFORNIA
SEE THE BEGINNING OF
GREATNESS.
The present year promises to see a very
large development of the oil and asphalt
production of the State. The oil fields !
are already second in mineral impor
tance in this State, with but a small be
ginning in their development. During the :
year prospecting for oil has been three
times as active as two years ago. and
boring for oil all along the coast will be i
one of the features of IS9B.
California petroleum is chiefly valua
ble as a fuel, and the future market for
It in Pacific regions where coal Is dear is |
limitless. The establishment of beet j
sugar factories :s one thing that is stim
ulating the search for oil. Prospecting |
for oil is being eagerly pursued about the
Chlno factory, and the factories of Mon
terey County arc spurs to the search in
that region. The Southern Pacific and
the Santa Fe railroad companies are both
vigorously prospecting on the railroad
lands in Southern California in search of
a cheap fuel supply. The manufactur
ing Industry' of Pan Francisco and the
bay region presents a future market for
an immense output. ' The trouble with
the market in this direction Is that until
the supply becomes adequate and perma
nent and there Is an assurance of stable
prices manufacturers will not risk the
expense of adapting their power plants
to oil consumption. When producing
fields are multiplied, production made
abundant and supply and price can be
safely calculated on San Francisco will
undoubtedly become a great consumer of
fuel oil. which should cost but half as
much as coal per horsepower. It already
consumes several thousand barrels a
month.
Oil deposits occur throughout the coast
region from i umboldt County south in
conjunction with the widespread sand
stones and unaltered shales. Oil seepages
may he observed throughout this region,
but in so few places onve prospecting
drills been put down that oil experts are
Justified in saying that prospecting has
hardly begun and that the present annual
product of about 1,000.000 barrels Is slight
compared with the certain production of
the future.
The original Indications, which, when
followed, resulted In the discoveries of
the Los Angeles and Summerland fields,
were no more noticeable than hundreds
of others yet disregarded. Boring for
water discovered the oil supply at Sum
merland. A slight oil seepage in the city
of Los Angeles prompted a man to bore
a little way for luck. His results prompt
ed boring elsewhere, and an oil excite
ment followed. It cannot be doubted that
many reservoirs of oil as great or greater
than that under Los Angeles are hidden
along the coast range awaiting the lucky
blows of drills.
The chief discovery of the year has
been near Coallnga. Fresno County,
which is already producing quite largely
from three or four good wells. About
$150,000 has been expanded in drilling
there, and Oil City probably has a large
future. The Los Angeles field keeps up
its production and Is being extended. The
Oil Producers' Association there is suc
ceeding well in keeping the price up to
$1 a barrel and in retaining most of the
producers in its membership. The re
ceipts of oil by the trustees In December
were 39,340 barrels. Storage capacity for
60.000 barrels will soon be ready. Ship
ments from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco are now about 10.000 barrels month
ly. The Standard Oil Company is report
ed to be trying to secure contracts for
the delivery of oil. and there !s specula
tion as to the intentions of the monopoly.
THE FARMER-MINER AS HE FLOUR
ISHES INT A CALIFORNIA
PARADISE.
One of the items of mining news re
ported in the interior papers during the
week relates to more gold nuggets, and
also to that interesting and often blessed
class of people scattered through the au
riferous mountains, the farmer-miners.
The National Bulletin of Quincy. Plumas
County, says: "D. M. Butterfield of Squir
rel Creek recently brought to Quincy ten
gold nuggets, taken from his mine, one
of them worth $41.
This Mr. Butterfield used to be a plain,
working miner, living in Oroville. and
earning wages at his trade as he could.
He wisely concluded to be independent
and away up on Squirrel Creek, in the
sierras of Plumas County, twelve miles
from Quincy. h.j found a â¢ atch of creek
bottom, which, with bits of abutting
mountain side, he has made into a fine
mountain ranch, and where he has es
tablished a romantic and comfortable
home. The ranch bountifully supplies
the cabin table and he has had plenty of
time for prospecting. He has found profit
in working a placer mine, as is evidenced
l>y the ten gold nuggets he has just
brought to town to help pay for sugar
and coffee, ammunition, fishhook?, and
likely enough new boots for the boys.
This is just a little commonplace in
stance, illustrating one Interesting phase
of the mining Industry in California. Be
cause the mining regions of California,
all along the Sierras and across the
northern part of the State, are splendidly
wooded and watered, are blessed with
fine climate, and present fertility in every
cubic yard of alluvial soil, thousands of
people have found such homes, while
turning to mm :ig as their chief hope and
business. Some are located near markets
and sell something of the products of
farm and orchard, while pegging away at
some little placer or quartz mine; "but
thousands more have and want no mar
kets.
Here and there along swift mountain
rivers and rivulets flowing through nar
row canyons are little homes wherever a
few square rods or a few acres of bench
or bottom land have been left by a wind
ing stream. Just a little hard work
means an abundance of vegetables and
fruit for the home and hay for a horse
and cow in winter. They are ten to forty
miles from a town, often as far from a
wagon road and near or far is the next
neighbor. From mountain roads or moun
tain trails that wind high along canyon
slopes one looks far down on these se
cluded, picturesque little spots nestling
by a foaming stream and shut In by tow
fring heights. There is trout by the door
and game in plenty in the hills.
It Is a miner or prospector who lives in
such a royal home. The fruit and wheat
markets trouble him not. He and the
wife and the boys tend to the agricul
tural business as it suits them and to
the fresh meat. Once in weeks or months
there is a trip to town with a pack mule,
perhaps. From this home the lord of the
cabin goes out through the surrounding
hills prospecting and doing assessment
work on claims that have been located
or to dig In a placer claim that he Is
working, or to wield pick and drill in a
quartz claim he is working away at in
a small way. The dust and nugget*
cleaned up from the placer are stowed
away in tin cans in cracks or behind
the wood-box by the "old woman." and
they are worth about $18 an ounce at any
store or bank. ' If operating capital is
small, perhaps enough gold to keep things
going is pounded out of quartz ore with
a mortar and pestle. Some such miners
are operating in partnership with a neigh
bor, and others operate on a scale that
enables them to hire one or more men
for wages.
This Is the life of hundreds of Califor
nia prospectors and miners. Many have
been at it this way for yearsâ hunting and
working, working and hunting. The hone
of a strike Is never-failing and reasonable
and it often comes at last. Whether the
mine and the little fortune comes alone
or not, there is comfort In the home and
clear eyes, strong limbs and bounding
blood for all the family. There is peace
and hope, opportunity, pleasure and com
fort that struggling poor in town and city
do not know. *
Away back in the wooded and watered
mountain slopes of Kern County there
has been living ami working alone for
thirty years an old cook, who left the sea
to go there. Ho has a mine or two of
low-grade quartz, a crude arrastra. cabin
a potato patch and a burro. He is vet
pegging contentedly away, grinding out a
few dollars for coffee and tobacco and
expects to die there alone. Such bachelor
miners are many. On the other hand
hundreds of women In such homes go out
to prospect and mine. too. and hunt
There are more women prospectors and
miners in the , hills than ', most people
dream of.
Three years ago a man by the name of

There are many miner-farmers who can

This is especially a practice In Southern

opportunities which the mining regions of
California offer to any industrious and in

NOTES OF THE FIELD.
The bis Golden Jubilee edition of the
Mining and Scientific Press, which was
issued yesterday, is one of the handsom
est special numbers ever issued by a tech
nical journal and is of exceptional inter
est to the general reader as well as to the
expert miner and the pioneer. Inside the
artistic cover the pages are filled with
illustrations, some interesting as exposi
tions of mining processes and many being
reproductions of old woodcuts illustrating
the mining life of the Argonauts. Two
pages are given to a valuable paper on
"The Mother Lode of California," by Ross
E. Brown, and the origin and evolution
of the California stamp mill is described
by C. P. Stanford. "Recollections of Cali
fornia Mining Life." bountifully illustrat
ed, runs through seven pages, and among
other features of special interest are,
"The beginning of Quartz Mining In Cali
fornia." by Almarin B. Paul, and "Gold
Formations in California," by W. H.
Storms. The reliability ajid high charac
ter which have given this old journal a
world-wide reputation provide a large
part of the value of this special number.
The Boston and Fantasma Milling and
Mining Company's now ten-stamp mill at
Victor, San Bernardino County, is com
pleted.
During the week kinetoscope pictures
of actual operations of some big hydrau
lic and quartz mines in Nevada County
have been taken. These life-like repro
ductions of mining scenes will be one of
the features of the Mining Fair.
The Manzanita hydraulic mine at
French Corral, Nevada County, has se
cured a permit to operate from the De
bris Commissioners, and is actively re
pairing the old restraining dam in Sweet
land Creek and otherwise preparing for
resumption.
I. Haas of Nevada City has bought a

placer mine in Nevada County.
The new mill at the Kirkham mine. Ne

A milling test of ore from the Round
Mountain mine, Nevada County, gave $12
a ton in free gold, and the* mine promises
to be a valuable one.
One of the developments In Calaveras
County last week was that of $50 rock
taken out on the Ayers ranch, on the
Nixon road. Three tons crushed gave this
promise of another good mine. A tunnel
: will be run to tap the vein at a depth
of 150 feet. '

JUMPED OVERBOARD.
Unknown Man Sought a Refuge
From Despondency in the
Waters of the Bay.
As the ferry steamer Kncinal was
abreast of Goat Island on her 2:25 after
noon trip across the bay yesterday a
man jumped off the deck into the water.
The alarm was at once given, and C. R.
Palmer, mate of the steamer, manned a
boat with a couple of sailors and re
