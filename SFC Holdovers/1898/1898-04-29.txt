MANY KILLED AT MATANZAS
THE CITY ALMOST RUINED
BY THE AMERICAN GUNS
Engagement at the Mouth oF Matanzas Bay on Wednesday Last Between the American War Vessels New York,
lincinnati and Puritan and the Spanish Forts on Both Sides of the Entrance, in Which the Latter
Were Entirely Silenced, With a Loss of 100 Men.
HAD ORDERS TO
RETURN THE FIRE
OF SPAIN'S GUNS
Rear-Admiral Sampson Knew
What He Was Doing When He
Silenced the Batteries at
Matanzas.
NEW YORK, April 28.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Hostile shots from American gun 3 will hereafter reply to the barring
of Spanish weapons mounted on the fortifications of Cuban ports
other than Havana. It was in accordance with instructions giving
him discretionary authority to return the fire of Spanish batteries
that Rear-Amiral Sampson bombarded yesterday the fortifications of
Matanzas. These instructions were formulated by the Naval War Board
and approved by Secretary Long.
Spain can blame herself for the destruction of the Matanzas bat
teries. Had the guns at that point not fired upon the torpedo-boat
Foote while she was steaming along the coast the bombardment might
never have occurred.
Rear-Admiral Sampson reported several days ago that the Foote
was fired on by a masked battery. The Cincinnati, hearing the boom
of guns, went at once to her aid, but Captain Chester, believing the or
ders of the department did not permit him to return the fire, simply
directed the Foote to get out oi range.
Bear-Admiral Sampson's report was at once referred to the War
Board, which gave him this:
"With the exception of those in Havana you are
given discretionary authority to return the fire of
any Spanish batteries. Keep your vessels out of
range of Havana guns until further orders."
Secretary Long announced at the close of office hours this after
noon that he had received no official report from Sampson. The Her
ald's magnificent description of the bombardment was received with
the greatest interest by American authorities, and in lieu of official re-
ports was regarded as most interesting.
It as the expectation of the department thai. Rear-Amiral Sampson
telegraph to-night or to-morrow, and his report will be at once
laid before the War Board. The intelligence officers on board the ships
which participated in the fighting will be required to give in a3 much
detail as possible the result of the bombardment, in order that the
War Board may determine its effect upon the plan they are preparing.
Profound ignorance is professed by the authorities as to the rea
son of Admiral Sampson's reconnoissance in Matanzas harbor, but they
say he must have desired to retaliate for the firing on the Foote and
also to destroy the batteries which were being erected for the protection
of the port-

Next Week, Probably at
NEW YORK, April 28.â A Washington special to the Herald
says : Brigadier-General William R. Shafter armed in Washington
last night and spent the day in consultation with officials of the War
and Navy Departments with regard to the expedition which he is to
lead to Cuba as soon as possible. It has been determined to land
next week a body of 15,000 regulars at a port to be decided
upon as available from the point of view of naval and military expe
diency.
It has been understood until to-day that the port to be selected
would be Bah/a Honda or one of the other harbors to the eastward of
Havana and outside the trocha.
The Herald's news of the reduction of the batteries at Matanzas
by Admiral Sampson's fleet may, however, materially affect the plans
of the War Department, and the possibility of Matanzas being made
the base of the first land operations was considerably discussed here
to-day.
The troops to compose this expedition will be the four regiments
now at New Orleans under command of Colonel Overshine, the infan
try brigade under Colonel Van Horn at Chickamauga and General Wade's
command at Tampa.
The port at which these troops will be embarked is not yet de
cided upon, but General Wade's division will undoubtedly set out di
rectly from Tampa and the other forces will be transported from either
New Orleans, Mobile or Pensacola.
General Shaffer will garrison the ports on the northern coast of
Cuba as fast as they are reduced, and will establish communication
with the insurgents under Generals Maceo and Gomez. He will also
take with him a large and efficient force of commissaries, who will
arrange for the transportation and distribution of supplies to the re
concentrados.

WASHINGTON, April 28â The Navy Department does not ex

LONDON, April 29.. â The Hongkong correspondent of the Daily Mail, telegraphing
Thursday, says : "There are no advices from Manila as to the whereabouts of the Amer
ican fleet. Large sums are being paid by people anxious to leave Manila.
'The strictly neutral attitude hitherto observed by the public toward the Hispano-
American dispute has been changed by the absurd proclamation of the Governor of the
Philippines, and public opinion is now favorable to the United States.
"The China Mail says : 'The proclamation will go far to alienate the last vestiges of
sympathy for the Spaniards,' and the Daily Press says : 'English sympathy is naturally
on the side of America.' "
According to a dispatch from Singapore to the Daily Mail the French steamer
Saigon and the Spanish steamer Espano have arrived there from Manila, both crowded
with refugees.

ON BOARD the Herald-Call
dispatch-boat Somers N. Smith,
Key West., Fla., April 28.â That
rare and almost unheard-of thing,
an exclusive report of bombard
ment, has been accomplished by
the Herald-Call without any ef
fort of an unusual character on
the part of its war correspond
ents.
The Herald-Call's cMs
patch boat Somers N.
Smith is sharing with the
lucky ships of the fleet the
honors of the day.
The navy is delighted that the
Herald has scored so handsomely,
because the Herald is the navy's
favorite newspaper, and wherever
naval officers have gone to-day
the Herald's correspondents have
been congratulated on their mag
nificent "beat."
It was not luck that gave the
Herald-Call this long lead of all
contemporaries. It was merely
the pursuit of a systematic plan of
campaign.
While rivals called in their
pickets from the blockading fleet
the Herald-Call continued all ef
forts, despite the discomforts that
the hellish commotion in the gulf
stream causes occupants of small
boats, and the day the Matanzas
batteries were peppered saw both
of the Herald-Call's dispatch
boats with the fleet.
One boat, the Albert F. De'vey,
came into Key West to bring the
routine news and get coal, while
the Somers N. Smith, the pride
of the Pensacola pilots, whose
boat she is, remained on guard.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
When the flagship went
to Matanzas the Somers
N. Smith followed her.
The correspondents on board
had no intimation from the ad
miral or any one else that he
contemplated firing a shot that
would be heard around the world.
1 had a long conversation with
Admiral Sampson just before the
flagship started, and no hint fell
from his lips that the powerful
blockade might be broken.
So that it was a fair fiela for
all newspapers, and the Herald
was lucky enough to be in at the
death.
After the engagement the Her
ald-Call boat offered to bring in
the admiral's dispatches, and
waited with the flagship tor let
ters from all the ships engaged,

STRENGTHENING
THE NORTHERN
PATROL SQUADRON
Will Be Prepared to Meet Any
SpaQish pleet Tl}at May Come
Across the Ocean. â¢
NEW YORK, April 2S.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Commander HowelTs command, officially known as the northern patrol
squadron, has been further increased by the addition of the ram Katah
<lin. which is now at Provincetown, Mass. As at present constituted, the
patrol squadron consists of the cruiser San Francisco (flagship), the
cruiser New Orleans, the ram Katahdin and the auxiliary cruisers Yan
kee, Dixie, Prairie and Yosemite.
On account of the poor condition of the defenses of the harbors of
Massachusetts, there is reason to believe that the Katahdin will re
main in these waters, for the present at least.
The flying squadron has received an addition in the shape of the
converted yacht Scorpion, formerly the Sovereign, which will serve with
Commodore Schley's command.
In order that the magazines of such ships as may participate in the
bombardment of any Cuban port shall be fully charged, Captain Charles
O'Nell, chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, has given instructions for the
collection of ammunition at New York and Norfolk, from which points
it will be shipped to Key West for distribution to the vessels of the
North Atlantic squadron.
On account of the necessity of fitting out the many auxiliary men-of
war that have been purchased, it has been found impossible to co-llect
much ammunition for the smaller cruisers' Kuns, but there is an am
ple supply on hand for guns of 8 to 13 inches caliber.
Members of the Board of Constructions have, finally determined up
on a type of battle-ship to ccmstruct in accordance with authority
granted under the pending naval appropriation measure. A circular
will be prepared which will require that bids be submitted within three
weeks of the date of its publication. The vessels will be similar to those
of the Illinois class and their completion will be required within three
years. Their speed will be sixteen knots each and their batteries will in
clude four 13-inch and fourteen 6-inch rapid-firing guns.
fine dispatch describing the fight
from the bridge of the New York.
It is a far cry from Matanzas to
Key West against a strong north
west gale, and the Somers N.
Smith sailed most of those eighty
five dreadful miles under water.
While she fairly tunneled her way
the Herald-Call's reporters penned
the story as best they could, and
I o'clock (New York time) this
morning found them filing about
4000 words at the cable office.
The wires were clear and
that is why the readers of
the Herald=Call had the
news of this most impor
tant event since the blaw=
ing up of the Maine before
them at their breakfast
table.
Some of the newspapers
here who did not cover
things thoroughly and
knew nothing about the
engagement learned of the
event through the indiscre=
tion of a telegraph messen
ger. These papers hastily
faked dispatches, which
were printed in New York
as having been written by
correspondents on the
spot. At 3 o'clock this
afternoon not a newspaper
In the United States except
the Herald and The Call
had a single line about
Matanzas brought in from
the fleet by its correspon
dents.
The behavior of our men-of-war
in action was splendid. The news
got trom the flagship that the men
were just as cool as though they
were at target practice. This is
also true of the Puritan and the
Cincinnati.
It is also true, however,
that the men on the Puritan
and Cincinnati wept during
the ten minutes when the
New York was engaged
alone, while they had to
wait for orders.
Then, while the Puritan engaged
and there still came no orders for
the Cincinnati to fire the grief of
Captain Chester's crew was al
most unbearable.
Finally, when the Cincinnati got
orders to engage, she steamed at
first broadside on and then took a
position where the Rubal Cava
batteries could not strike her. She
fairly enfiladed the batteries and
her men exclaimed with every
shot:
Take that for the
Maine."
There was no rejoicing, no
cheering. Everything was carried
out with an earnestness of pur
pose which showed a sensation of
which joy was not a part. The
men felt the pleasure of conflict
pulsating in their veins, but not the
pleasure of killing tor killing's
sake.
Too much cannot be said of the
gunnery of the men on the ships,
nor can too much be said in praise
of the discipline which prevailed.
Just here 1 would like to tell the
TORPEDO FLEET

ST. VINCENT, Cape Verde
Islands, April 28.â Spain's fleet is
still coaling here, but it is now
probable that at least several of
the ships will sail to-morrow.

story of two cadets. Their names
| are Boone and Pettingill. They
were graduated from the Annapo
11 is Naval Academy ahead of time,
j about April i, and hurried off tc
; the flagship. Cadet Pettingill took
i alarm at the prospect of the New
York being ordered out of these
waters and fearing he would then
j miss the fighting asked to be trans
ferred to the Puritan. Cadet
| Boone remained on. board the New
I York and it was he who fired the
first shot in yesterday's bombard
| ment. Cadet Pettingill was in the
fight too, on board the Puritan,
and had the pleasure of sending
the shell into the Spanish batteries.
They were both very happy "wa
ter babies," as their friend Captain
Goodrellof the marines calls them,
j but Cadet Boone is the happier.
The lesson the artillery experts
! draw from the engagement is that
the Spaniards have no batteries
that cannot be destroyed by an
attacking force. To be success
fully defended the Spanish must
have recourse to their favorite
weapon â the submarine mine.
No shots were fired from shore
yesterday from larger guns than B
inch. A very .few shells were
fired. Most of the missiles were
solid shot and came from the guns
of 4or 5 caliber. At the time the
New York began to fire the Span
iards were mounting some io-inch
cannon, made at the Hontoria Gun
Factory. If these can be got in
position the Spaniards will have
some really serviceable weapons
against our cruisers.
The Spanish cable announcing
the total of the casualties of the
enemy as one mule was read to
day with a smile of incredulity.
Those who witnessed this engage
ment are satisfied the Spanish suf
fered great loss. The famous long
shot from the Puritan was seen to
dismount the gun that fired the
last Spanish shell, and everything
around flew into fragments from
the bursting of the monitor's mis-
sile.

Powder Works at Dover, N. J.,
Blown Up, Six Men KjHecl
and Buildiogs Wrecked.
EASTON, Pa. April 28.â The town of Dover, in Morris bounty, N.
J., and the country within a radius of twenty miles was startled this
afternoon by a series of terrific explosions, the first of which occurred
at 2:10 o'clock. The explosions occurred in the Atlantic Powder Com
pany's w â¢ and the plant is now a mass oi ruins.
Six workmen were killed and four others were seriously injured,
some probably fatally* The remains of the dead have not yet been
recovered. The dead are:
ALFRED RARICK, WILLIAM FTUMFF,
CASPER RA , DAVID SCHEER,
WILLIAM HAYCOCK, ELIAS- A^ERS.
All the killed were married and leave families.
The works were situated in an isolated spot seven miles from Dover,
in a rough country. There were ten buildings in the group and all
have been destroyed. The first explosion occurred in one of the pack
ing houses. The concussion set off the explosives in another packing
house near by. Debris and burning timbers of the wrecked buildings
were carried high into the air and fell in a shower ovr- the remain
ing buildings, sotting fire to the main factory and the other five pack
ing houses and the two shell houses. In a brief time the explosives in
these buildings were set off and left death and destruction in their
wake. The works have been running night and day, turning out rush
orders for the Government and a large amount of ammunition ready
for shipment was stored in the parking houses. This, with all other
explosives, was completely destroyed. The scene presented at the place
was terrible. People who felt the shocks and saw the flames of the
burning structures flocked to the place for miles around, but could ren
der no aid to the injured. The people were terrified and held back in
constant fear of other explosions. A few men- who were in the build
ing managed to escape and they ran about the country bewildered.
They could give -o intelligent account of the cause of the explosion.
When the families and relatives of the emnloyes of the factory ap
proached the burning buildiner the scene was heartrending.
It was nearly 5 o'clock before the ruins had cooled off sufficiently to
be approached and before the onlookers could be induced to go near
the spot.
The bodies of the dead were terribly mangled. Many of the injured
were cut and maimed so badly that some of them cannot recover.
The loss cannot be learned at this time.

give a graphic pen picture of all that oc
curred, with every essential detail. The
news was brought with all speed by the
Herald boat to the nearest wire at Key

this office. It was the only account that
was or could be received at Key West
from the scene of the action, for the rea

It has not only been read with avidity
by the general public on both sides of

important light on interesting problems

"This, however, is but one illustration,
signal though it be, of the efficiency of
the Herald's war news service, covering
the entire globe, and is what the public
may expect from the Herald right along.
Yesterday, for example, we published
also the latest and fullest reports from
every stirring news center in the world,
including timely special cable dispatches
from Cape Verde, Hongkong, Cadiz,
Gibraltar, Madrid and Paris, which
shows that if you want the war news you
must have the Herald."
STORY OF OLD GLORY.
AS a natidn we are the most pictorial
in the world, writes M. C. Rayne in
the Chicago Times-Herald, and we
began early to read from symbols,
our first standard of independent rule be
ing the design of a rattlesnake cut in
thirteen pieces, representing the thirteen
colonies, bearing first the motto "Unite
or Die." and later the significant warn
ing, "Don't Tread on Me," the rattle
snake being typified in an attitude pre
pared to strike. Rude as the device was,
it had a terrible significance, but one in
which, science, history and power held
formidable parts, ana " was a motive of
wise statesmanship that gave it as a
warning to foreign pressure, when that
pressure developed into tyranny.
Dr. Franklin, seeing the emblem one
day, wrote of it in. cnis admirable expla
nation:
"On inquiry and from study I learn that
the ancients considered the serpent an
emblem of wisdom, and in some attitudes
of endless duration. Also that countries
are often represented by animals peculiar
to that country. The rattlesnake is found
nowhere but in America. Her eye is ex
ceedingly, bright and without eyelids
emblem of vigilance. She never begins an
attack and she never surrenders â emblem
of magnanimity and courage. She . never
wounds even her. enemies until she gen
erously gives uiem warning not to tread
on her, which is emblematical of the
spirit of the people who inhabit her coun
try. She appears apparently weak and
defenseless, but her weapons are never
theless formidable. Her poison is the en
cessary means for the digestion of her
food,- but certain death to her enemies â
showing the power of American re
sources. Her thirteen rattles, the only
part which increases in number, are dis
tinct from each other, and yet so united
that they cannot be disconnected without
breaking them to ieces, showing the im
possibility of an American republic with
out a union of States. A single rattle
will give no sound alone, but the ringing
of the thirteen together is sufficient to
startle the boldest man alive. She is
beautiful in youth and her beauty in
creases with age. Her tongue is forked
as the lightning, and her abode is among
the impenetrable rocks."
This magnificent apostrophe to a rat
tlesnake reads like an improvise don from
the Book of Job or the Psalms of David,
and, connected as it is with every epoch
of American liberty, it should be" as im
mortal in its sentiments as the Declara
tion of Independence.
It will soon be the one hundred and
twenty-first anniversary of the American
flag, or rather its adoption by Congress,
George Washington being chairman of
the committee which gave the order for
the thirteen stars and stripes. The patri
otic women of that day did not immor
talize themselves by making the flag witli
their own hands, but the expert needle
woman who drew the threads and did tho
fine stitching on Georgv "Washington's
shirts made our first national banner, and
wl.thm late years her house, which is still
standing, has become a resort for the pa
triotic. It has long been designated "tho
Betsey Ross flag." so it goes down to
posterity with a woman's name attached
as a factor in its being.
It was succeeded by the flng of fifteen
stars, which will come to bp known aa
the "Francis Key flag." our national an
them. "The Star-spangled Banner," hav
ing been written under its fokls, or rather
it was the flag which Key saw while in
diting his poem.
I have had the pleasure of hearing from
the lips of one who knew the history of
the name given to our flng in recent
years. "Old Glory." the incidents of the
occasion. The narrator, George W. Bates
of Detroit. Mich., a gentleman of unusual
information on ail topics, and an ardent
patriot, says that it was applied to the
flag of the X'nited States for the first time
by Captain Stephen Driver, an old sea
captain who was living in Nashville
Term., in 1562. In order to k^ep the flag,
which had been presented to him whilo
abroad by American friends, he hid it in
a quilt and slept unuor its folds without
its enemies bei.ng any the wiser. On
awakening in the morning he would
ascribe his good sleep to the concealed
flag, which he called by the pet name
"Old Glory." and when the Federals en
tered Nashville he flung "Old Glory" to
the breeze and told the story everywhere
The name is now as national as the flag.

ALGECIRAS, April 28.â During the
early hours of the morning the torpedo
boat destroyer Destructor and the tor
pedo-boats Habana and Barcelona were
sent away without a word of notice.
We had left them moored within two
hundred yards of our pier last night.
When the earliest riser awoke they
were gone. la the afternoon the two
torpedo-boats returned, taking their
moorings at Sandy Bay, about three
miles away from here. In tne evening
they returned here.
The Destructor was out all day re
connoitering 1 . She has now her full
complement of hands, two torpedo ex
perts and sailors having arrived from
Cadiz yesterday. She has now been in
cessantly reconnoitering for two days.
There is great curiosity as to her mo
tive. Another Spanish cruiser passed
here at 3 o'clock this afternoon. It was
probably the Alfonso XIII going west
and surely bound for Cadiz. It is con
firmed that the ship which passed last
evening going that way was the Pelayo.
Much excitement was caused here
last night by a sudden call for the crew
to join the British cruiser Charybdis.
She promptly started out and orders
were given to get ready for action.
The report was that an encounter was
about to take place, the British being
determined to manitain the neutrality
of their waters. At the same time the
special land guard was mounted and
all preparations were made. Her guns
were trained and the Charybdis fired one
shqf to warn any trespassers happen
ing to be about.
The action of the two torpedo-boats
and the torpedo-boat destroyer are the
subjects of much comment here. ' The
latter keeps unceasingly recormoitering
on the other hand for the Fleur de Lys
an American yacht, and on the other
for a warship su : . osed to have been
purchased by the United States from
Italy, and also for ships carrying
sulphur to the United States. Several
of the latter have been instructed to al
ter their course so as to avoid all dan
ger.
The Fleur de Lys, according to a no
tice received here, has put into Lisbon,
having been warned of the danger
awaiting her. It is stated that the De
structor stepped several merchant
ships at the south of this point. It is
said that an American merchantman is
expected to run in here. If that is true,
she will come in during the night. Once
here or within three miles she is under
British protection, which will be rig
idly maintained. â¢ - ,
DOWNFALL. OF THE PIRATE.
(Written for Little Alfonso.)
Thore was once a Black-hearted Pi-rate.
He spoke on-lv in fierce Thun-der tones
and he Kill-ed Lit-tle Chil-dren. He car
ried a Knife be-tween his Fe-ro-ci-ous
Teeth, and he do-ted on Blow-insj up
Shins in the Night. Wo-men Trem-bled
be-fore him, and when he saw that, he
us-ed to Swrll with Pride, and say a-loud:
"What a Great and Cru-el Pi-mte I am!
I am- the Cru-ell-est that ev-er was. I
am not a-fraid of the babe at the mo
ther's breast. I kill sick peo-ple and am
not tim-id. that is, if they are ve-ry sick."
But one day a tall White Mar. took the
Gru-el Pi-rate by the neck and kick-ed
him till he co-uld not see. Then the Cru-el
Pi-rate drop-ped his glea-niinp: Knife and
wept and screa-med: "I am not a Cru-el
Pi-rate. I am Good and Peace-able. Will
no kind gon-tle-man help a Poor Old
Crip-ple a-cainst this Ruf-fian?"
But all the peo-ple lau-g-hed and said:
"Kick him a-gain."
And the Tall White Man was ve-ry
strong and a good kick-er. and when he
had kick-ed the Cru-el Pi-rate a-bout
three thou-sand milts there was a Great
De-mand for Man-tel-pie-ces in Spain at
Meal times.â New York Press.

Men on the Terror and

Into the Guido.
While Trying to Run the Cuban
Blockade the Spanish Steamer
Is Given an Ob|ect Les=
son and Captured.
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, April 28â When the
great Spanish freight steamship Guido
of the Fletcher line came into port
early this morning in charge of a prize
crew from the monitor Terror and the
gunboat Machias the starboard side of
her pilot-house was shattered into
kindling-wood, her compass and binna
cle were smashed into a thousand frag
ments, and her brass binnacle standard
was clearly pierced in three places by
six-pound shells.
These wounds were a tribute to the
superb marksmanship of the men be
hind the naval vessel's rapid-fire guns.
The Guido had not stopped her en
gines quickly enough when ordered to
do so. She paid the penalty, and her
good captain. Julien Ormaccea. who
stood just forward of the pilot-house,
had the novel sensation of hearing a
six-pounder shot whiz past his head at
a distance not more than two feet.
Poor Manuel Rivas, a sailor, who stood
at the wheel, was not so fortunate.
The shot which shattered the compass
and binnacle showered him with broken
glass and metal.
The next and last shot fired from the
Terror entered the starboard side of the
pilot-house from a slanting direction
aft and drove into Rivas' breast several
long, jagged, wooden splinters, one of
which penetrated to the pleural cavity.
Rivas was this afternoon removed to the
United States Marine Hospital. His
condition was regarded as critical,
though hopes are entertained of his re
covery.
The shot fired by the Machias pierced
one of the steamship's whaleboats as it
hursf from the davits, and, exploding,
rent long, rough holes in the- boat's
sides. Only four shots were fired at the
ship altogether, one by the Machias
and three by the Terror. Every one
reached its mark with deadly accuracy.
This kind of marksmanship, together
with the exhibition of artillery skill
given yesterday in front of the Matanzas
shore batteries, is likely to inspire an
increased respect in the Spanish breast
for the skill of our naval gunners.
The Terror and Machias at half-past
3 o'clock Wednesday morning over
hauled the Guido ten miles off Cardenas
and identified her as a Spanish ship
bound for Havana. One F.hot was fired
across her bows by the Terror, but the
Guido did not stop, and apparently
forged ahead. The other shots then fol
lowed in quick succession. They were
not aimed across her bow, but at her
pilot-house. Then Captain Ormaccea
pulled his bells so violently as to stop
the engines and then to reverse them.
A prize crew, consisting of twelve men,
under the command of Lieutenant
Qualtrough of the Terror and Ensitrn
Willets of the Machias, was put aboard.
Everything was done first of all to as
sist the wounded sailor, Manuel Rivas,
and then the ship was headed for Key
West. She arrived off the bar late last

night and entered the harbor this morn
ing.
Captain Ormaccea is a philosopher.
He speaks English fairly well. His
first surprise after entering this port was
when his captors moored him directly
alongside the steamship Pedro, a sister
ship of the same line, and commanded
by Captain Ormaccea's best friend. The
Pedro was the second prize of the war.
She was captured after a long chase by
the flagship New York. Now the two
captains are companions in misfortune
and captivity. Captain Ormaccea
smiled grimly this afternoon when I
asked him if he had deliberately tried
to run the blockade. He said he had
no knowledge that war had been de
clared, having sailed from Liverpool
April 12 and afterward touched at Co
runna. When he first saw the signal
lights of the United States monitor he
believed her to be a Spanish warship,
but the vicious shot that promptly went
across his bow soon apprised him of his
error.
The captain says he rang to stop im
mediately after the first shot, and thinks
he was used a little harshly afterward.
He is grateful to be alive, however, and
not disposed to find fault. He and
Lieutenant Qualtrough, the prize mas
ter, shook hands in a most manly
fashion this afternoon after drinkine a
glass of wine together in the cabin of
the captured ship. Lieutenant Qual
trough and Ensign Willets then turned
over their charge to Prize Commander
Julius Otto. United States District At
torney Stripling and United States Dep
uty Marshal Atchinson. The naval offi
cers then withdrew, leaving the marine
guard. Captain Ormaccea told the Fed
eral officers he had little sympathy with
the present war, and cared little what
disposition was made of him except
that he hoped he would not be put
ashore in Cuba.
REGIMENTS
OF IMMUNES
Troops for Cuba Who
Have Had the Yellow
Fever.
These Will Not Be in Fear
of Spain's Strongest
' Ally.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 28.â Senators
Caffery and McEnery of Louisiana,
Se onatrMallory of Florida and Repre
sentative Davey of Louisiana have
been consulting with reference to the
raising of regiments of yellow fever
immunes in Louisiana and other South
ern States for service in Cuba. The
Secretary of War has been most fav
orably impressed with the idea, and
has already signified his intention of
j accepting the regiments of immunes
I raised in Louisia. 1 by the son of Gen
eral Hood, the famous Confederate
commander.
The Senate Committee on Military
Affairs agreed upon a favorable report
on the bill re: oving the limitations or.
toe supplies the quartermaster's de
partment of the army may purchase,
and also upon the bill permitting the
enlistment of a brigade of engineers.
Itoth bills were amended, the limitation
bill so as to authorize the Secretary of
W r to make purchase of supplies
abroad. The engineer bill was amend
ed so as to permit the enlistment of
10,000 yellow fever immunes in the
army.
The bill was also amended so as to
extend the removal of limitations of
purchases to all bureaus of the War De
partment and to all branches of the
army, instead of confining them to the
quartermaster's department.
The provision of the engineer bill for
the enlistment of yellow fever immunes
was inserted practically in response to
the President's request, which was
made known by Secretary Alger. The
President and the Secretary both think
these troops will be especially useful in
a campaign in Cuba. They think there
will be comparatively little difficulty
in securing the number required.
The general phraseology of this
amendment is similar to the provision
in the previous act, except that the
"special qualification" required as spec
ified is to be "immunity from diseases
incident to tropical climates."
Mormons Ready to Respond.
SALT LAKE. Utah, April 28.â The
Deseret News this afternoon publishes

Wells. The letter refers to the bat
talion of 600 Mormons that enlisted to
take part in the Mexican War, and
says: "War has been declared and our
citizens are called upon to enlist. We
trust that the citizens of Utah, who
are latter day saints, will be found
ready to respond with alacrity to this
call which is made upon our State."

try. Although the speakers represented
all four of the different political divi
sions, no reference was made to politics,
and the unanimous voice of all was that
the administration should receive the
unqualified support and assistance of
the entire American people at this time.
After calling the meeting to order,
Cole introduced the chairman of the
evening, Judge Murphy, who delivered
a patriotic address. He said that every
volunteer who enlisted for the service
of his country need have no fear about
his family being cared for yi his ab
sence. He added that while the volun
teer soldier received but $13 a month
his family would be given four times
that amount if it was necessary to pro
vide for them during the time the son
or father was absent at the front fight
ing his country's battle.
Mayor M. I*. Snyder, a Democrat, de
livered an abie address covering the
existing condition of affairs, which was
loudly applauded. Judge J. W. Mc-
Kinley, one of the best known Repub
licans in Southern California, followed
Mayor Snyder. George S. Patton, a
Democrat, Judge J. N. Phillips, a Silver
Republican, and I. E. Messmore, a
Democrat, also spoke along the same
lines.
Strong resolutions were adopted un
animously indorsing the present steps
taken by the administration in carry
ing on the war. Committees were ap
pointed to take in hand a permanent
organization to exist as long as the war
lasted on all matters appertaining to
the public good, defense and welfare in
Southern California. The* meeting was
a great success in every respect, and it
was the first expression of public opin
ion in the shape of a mass-meeting that

PALO ALTO, April 28.---The proposal

to the fitate encampment at the Pre
sidio the recruits are being drilled by
Captain Harkins of Menlo Park. On
Monday it is thought they will be
called to go to the Presidio,
where, after one month's drill, they
will be subjected to a physical ex
amination and if accepted enlisted in
the United States Volunteers for two
years, or less should the war end with
in that time.
Those who have enlisted up to date
are: David C. O. Bigelow, Chester A.

Secretary Alger and Adjutant-General

of the most Important of the auxiliary
forces of the volunteer army will be
two regiments of riflemen to be raised
in the Western States. In issuing the
call to the States from whose quota
these regiments will be formed, Secre

should all be good riders and shots, and
should be selected from the rough rid

ed at the War Department to-day that
these regiments would be enlisted as
rapidly as possible so a? to be hurried
East to form the scouting and light
cavalry force of the first volunteer
troops to go to Cuba.
Colonel Torrey, who will command
the First Regiment, is now in Washing

STEAMERS CHARTERED
TO CONVEY TROOPS.
It Will Not Be Long Now Before an
Army Is on the Way to
Cuba.
WASHINGTON, April 28.-A rather
striking sign of the imminence of the
invasion of Cuba was contained in the
chartering to-day by the War Depart
ment of eight large steamers, of an
average capacity of about 2000 tons, and
able to carry from 500 to 1000 passengers
each. These are to be used as trans
ports for the conveyance of the first
military expedition to Cuba. The names
of the boats are the Olivette and th^
Florida, of the Plant line, now in the
Gulf; the Southern Pacific Company's
steamer Aransas; the New York and
Texas Company's vessels Comal, now
at New York, and the Malamo, now en
route to the Gulf, and three fine ships
cf the Boston Merchants' and Miners'
line in Baltimore â the Allegheny, the
Berkshire and the Decatur Miller. The
price paid for these vessels is from
$10,000 to $15,000 for the thirty days for
which they are engaged. They will be
taken charge of by the quartermaster's
department at the earliest possible mo
ment.

reported to have been captured by the
Spanish, arrived here safely this after
noon. The tug Rathlin met the ship
off the south coast of Ireland and towed
her to Pc!nt Lynas for $1500, as the
commander of the Shenandoah was un
willing to risk her being intercepted
Her cargo, owing to the advance in the
price of wheat, is worth $150,000
The members of the crew of the
Shenandoah were greatly excited when
the tug Rathlin informed them that
war between Spain and the United
States had broken out. Captain Mur
phy says that on Monday evening last
he sighted what he believes were two
Spanish cruisers, Lut the vessels were
too far distant for him to be certain
that they were warships of the enemy. â¢

LISBON, April 28.â The Offi
cial Gazette will publish to-mor

the neutrality of Portugal in the
conflict between Spain and the
United States.
WASHINGTON. April 28. â The
French Embassy has received a cable
dispatch from the foreign office at
Paris, announcing that a decree of neu
trality as to the United States and
Spain has been issued and that a de
tailed copy will be forwarded by mail.
RUNNING THE BLOCKADE.
The Spanish steamer Montserrat, which was turned back while attempting to make Havana, succeeded in landing the 1000 soldiers intended
for General Blanco at Cienfuegos on the southern side of the island.
On the receipt of the dispatch the
French Embassador, M. Cambon, wrote
to the State Department, informing
it of France's neutrality. The cable
notice is brief, stating only- that the
decree follows the treaty of Paris of
1856. The State Department has also
been informed that Mexico, Argentine
Republic, Korea and Belgium have pro
claimed neutrality. Korea's neutral
ity is considered important, owing to
her proximity to the Philippines.
The State Department has heard
nothing from Germany, but this causes
no apprehension, owing to the strong
assurances Germany has given that she
will observe strict neutrality between
the two belligerents. This assurance
was conveyed to Embassador White
and is looked upon as practically equiv
alent to a formal declaration of neu
trality. Germany Austria and Portu
gal are the last of the important Eu
ropean nations to declare their attitude.
The apprehension as to Portugal's
course was considerably removed to
day by the call of Viscount de Santo-
Thyrso, who gave strong assurances to
the State Department that Portugal
would remain strictly neutral. The
Portuguese Minister expects the official
declaration almost hourly. Although
Portugal explains her delay, on the
ground that the declaration ot war was
not made until the 24th inst., yet Great
Britain declared neutrality with un
usual promptness. The effect of Great
Britain's speedy action was to force
the United States fleet to leave Hong
kong, while the effect of Portugal's de
lay has been to permit the Spanish fleet
to remain at the Cape Verde Islands.
This speedy action in the first case was
harmful to American interests, while de
layed action in the second case was
equally harmful to American interests.
Attention is now being centered on
the course of Austria. lj.er delay in
declaring neutrality causes no material
inconvenience, as Austria has no ports
at which Spanish ships can take refuge,
but it discloses that Austria's strong
tendencies are with Spain, owing to the
dynastic relations between the thrones
of Austria and Spain.

"Washington, April 28.
The Republican members of the Ways
and Means Committee held a meeting
to-day at which fifty amendments to
the war revenue bill were agreed to.
These will be offered in the House to
morrow. Many of them are mere ver
j bal amendments, but some are of con
siderable importance. One of these ex
cepts mutual and co-operative life in
surance companies from taxation. The
tax on insurance companies is trans
ferred from the policies to the prem
iums. In this the amendment conforms
to the law of 1866. The tax on marine
and fire insurance companies is ex
tended to cover employers liability as
sociations, title insurance companies,
glass and all other such insurance com
panies, of which many classes have
grown up in the past few years.
Railroad telegraphic messages and all
other leased wire messages are ex
empted by an amendment limiting the
tax on messages "on which the com
panies' charges are to be paid or to
be collected." The tax on chewing gum
I is reduced from 1 cent on a 5-cent pack
age to one-quarter of a cent.
The tax on beer is extended to in
clude beer "stored. The amendment
was deemed necessary to cover beer in
storage. The license of dealers in leaf
tobacco is reduced from $24 to $12 on
those whose sales do not exceed $10,000
per annum and from $48 to $24 on deal
ers whose sales exceed that amount.
The most important amendment was
: one which levies a tax of 1 cent upon
all pay telephone messages costing be
low 25 cents. Vhe original provision ex
empted messages from a distance be
low thirty miles. Tawney of Minnesota
estimates that this amendment, which
will cover all city and suburban busi
ness, will raise $5,000,000.

THE PRESIDENT
NOT DISPOSED
TO ANNEXATION
He Prefers at Present to Let the
Senate Decide the Future of
the Hawaiian Islands.
NEW YORK, April 28.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald sends the following: At the White House this evening an impor
tant conference was held in the interest of the annexation of the Ha
waiian Islands. The friends of annexation were represented at the
conference by Senator Davis of Minnesota, chairman of the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations; Senator Morgan of Alabama, senior member
of the minority of that committee, and former Secretary' of State
John W. Foster.
This delegation called upon the President by special appointment
and discussed the subject for nearly two hours. They urged the Presi
dent to exercise his executive authority and order the American flag
to be hoisted over the islands. The Hawaiian Government and its rep
resentatives here earnestly advocate the annexation of the islands by
the United States.
President McKinley, while favoring annexation, is not disposed to
take the step suggested without the advice and consent of the Senate.
He would much prefer that the treaty now pending before the Senate
should be ratified. He was assured that in view of the present condi
tion of affairs in the Pacific two-thirds of the Senators would vote for
the treaty. He was also informed that the opponents of annexation in
the Senate are strong enough to delay action for an indefinite period.
While the President recognizes the force of the argument submitted
by the friends of annexation he cannot see his way clear to take the
step proposed. He has no desire to become involved in further inter
national complications, which he fears might result from the forcible
occupation of Hawaii.
The war with Spain Is not being waged for the purpose of acquir
ing additional territory and although the importance of having a base
of supplies at Hawaii is not denied, he prefers to consider the subject
further before rendering his final decision.

TO SEND
FOOD TO
CUBANS.
President McKinley Is De=
termined to Aid the
Starving.
Captain=General Blanco Asked
to Give Permission for the
Red Cross Society to Dis=
tribute Supplies.
NEW YORK, April 28.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent telegraphs:
President McKinley has not abandoned
his plan of providing relief for the con
centra dos of Cuba. Notwithstanding
the injurious effect, from a military
point of view, -which the shipment of
supplies into Cuba would have, the
President believes that it Is the duty
of the United States to relieve, as much
as possible, the sufferings of the starv
ing Cubans, providing that the Span
ish authorities will permit the distribu
tion of supplies under the direction of
the American Red Cross.
I learned to-night from a high ad
ministration official that the President
has been advised that the steamer City
of Texas, which is loaded v.ith all kinds
of supplies, is awaiting orders al Key
West to proceed to Havana. The ad
ministration plan contemplates. I un
derstand, the dispatch of the vessel to
that port, just as soon as it has been
learned that Captain-General Blanco
will permit a distribution of the sup
plies.
It is possible that the communica
tion which Rear-Admiral Sampson sent
to Captain-General Blanco by the
Spanish officers whom he captured and
subsequently released may have re
ferred to the purpose of the President
to ship supplies into Cuba.
The authorities have not much hope
that Captain General Blanco will ac
cept the proposition of this Govern-
ment, especially as it is coupled with
a statement that the distribution of
supplies must be personally made by
the American Red Cross, but it is felt
that the responsibility of further
deaths among the reconcentrados â will
then be on his shoulders and not upon'
those of this Government. Should Cap
tain General Blanco permit the en
trance of supplies and then seize them
for the use of his forces, the odium
which would attach to such action
would be sufficient condemnation, the
officials says, of his proceedings, and
would be another ground for withdraw
al by the world of any sympathy It
may feel for Spain.
In case of refusal by Captain General
Blanco to permit the shipment of sup
plies into Cuba, it is proposed by the
President, immediately after the occu
pation of the proposed Cuban base,
which the navy will take, to send food,
medicines and clothing to that point,
and their distribution will be made to
any sufferers who may be reached. It
is expected that the insurgents will aid
in this distribution.
Military officers regret the determin
ation of the President to send supplies
to Cuba. They say that Captain Gen
eral Blanco will permit the entrance of
supplies; that he â would be a fool if
he did not, and that at least 90 per
cent of them will be secured by the
Spanish. Naturally, they say, the more
food the Spaniards get the longer they
will delay capitulating.

Charles A. Cole, Charles Miller, James

unknown men â were taken to the ar
mory, where public funeral services
were held. The ten caskets were
1 in a row in front of the plat
form and the loving hands ut friends
placed floral tributes and buried the
caskets of all with blossoms.
The long platform at the end of the
hall was banked with callas by hun
dreds, roses and other flowers in abun
dance. The reading desk was a mass
of blossoms, but beneath all this it was
a sad sight to witness. At 2 o'clock,
when the services commenced, the ar
mory, the largest buiiding in the town,
was crowded with at least 2000 people.
Although the front seats were reserved
fur the many mourners, it seemed that
the entire populace were mourners,
even the strongest-hearted giving way
to their feelings. The pall-bearers and
employes of the California Powder
Works were occupants of the front
scats across the aisle from the mourn
ers.
Seated on the platform were the j
clergyâ Rev. H. M.-Namee of the Cath- I
olic church. Rev. C. O. Tillotson of Cal
vary Episcop&l Church, Rev. E. Hay
den of the First Baptist church and I
Rev. Thomas Filben of the Methodist |
church. The choir was composed of
member* from the choirs of the Cath
olic, Episcopal, Baptist and Methodist
churches. The Impressive services
were opened with the hymn "Sweet
Peace, Gift of God's Love" by the choir. I
Rev. Father McNamee then spoke very
appropriately and read the solemn
prayers for the dead according to the
ritual of the Catholic church.
Rev. Thomas Filben then, in a few j
words, gave a brief biographical sketch i
of the life of each of the known de

rial service was read by Rev. C. O.
Tillotson from the fifteenth chapter of

In view of the prospective departure
of the Spanish fleet from St. Vincent,
the authorities are also hopeful that it
will not molest the Oregon and Mari
etta, hut they appreciate that the
Spanish plan of campaign may iigure
upon the destruction of the American
battleship and her consort by armored
cruisers at Cape Verde Islands. The
War Board has been carefully consider
ing the safety of the Oregon, and the
department will cable instruction to
Captain Clarke, commanding: the battle
ship, in line with the recommendation
which it will make.
According to Information received by
the Navy Department the torpedo-boat
destroyers and torpedo boats which are
operating in the vicinity of Gibraltar
are the destroyers Destructor, Pluton
and Propperina and the torpedo boats
Barcelo, Habana and Halcon. None of
these vessels has any extensive steam
ing radius, so that it will be impossible
for them to enter the Mediterranean
Sea or to steam to. sea for any distance.
Concerning the Temerario, the Navy
Department officials are puzzled.
Forced to move by Argentine's procla
mation of neutrality, official advices
state that the torpedo gun vessel left
Buenos Ayres this morning. Dispatches
to the Herald state that she put in at
the port of La Plata, a few miles down
the river. It is the expectation of the
officials that Spain will keep the Tem
erario in South American waters as
long as it is possible for her to obtain
coal, for the purpose of picking up any
American vessels that she may meet.
There are a number of American
steamers, shins and schooners plying
in South American waters and it would
be an easy matter for the Temerario
to capture them. As her coal supply
will soon be exhausted, however, she
will have to depend upon the neu â¢ality
charity of Argentine, Uruguay and
Brazil to obtain fuel, and her usefulness
in her present cruising grounds will
eonsquently be limited.
and Rev. Thomas Filben each made an
impressive address. The service then
closed with the sinking: "Nearer My
God to Thee" by the choir.
The funeral procession was then
formed. Two hearses and three
â wagons carried the dead to the last
resting place. The pallbearers were
all chosen from employes of the powder
works. The cortege was preceded by
the Odd Fellows, the Percy Webber
Society and employes of the California
Powder Works. The funeral proces
sion was the largest ever held in Santa
Cruz, there being over 200 carriages.
During the journey to the cemetery the
bells of the churches tolled a solemn
funeral dirge.
At the cemetery nearly the whole
city's population gathered. The ten
bodies were placed side by side. The
choir sang "Nearer My God to Thee "
The service for the dead was read by
Rev. C. O. Tillotson. The Odd Fel
lows' service was read for the late
member, Charles A. Cole, and the bene
diction was pronounced by Rev.
Thomas Filben.
AN AGREEMENT ON
THE NAVAL BILL
Conferees of I"Duse and Senate Will
Now Report the Appropriation
Measure.
WASHINGTON, April 28.â The con
ferees of the two houses reached an
agreement on the naval appropriation
bill before adjourning to-night. All the
Senate increase in the way of moni
tors and torpedo boats were adopted.
These increases included four monitors
at $1,250,000, and sixteen instead of
twelve torpedo boat destroyers. All the
other important additions made by the
Senate are retained. The language in
regard to the enlistment of seamen was
changed so as to provide for 1000 more
marines. A provision was inserted giv
ing the Secretary of the Navy author
ity to enlist volunteers up to the rank
of commander. This was done so that
the department could avail itself of the
service of the officers of the American
liners chartered by the Government.
The conference will report to-morrow.
WILL HOLD THE
LARGEST WARSHIPS.
Welcome Official Information Re
ceived by the Navy Department
From the Port Boyal Dock.
WASHINGTON, April 28.â The Port
Royal drydock, according to welcome
official information, will be accessible
to our warships, even the biggest in the
fleet, should they meet with accident
during the campaign. The report from
the constructor in charge shows that
the entrance to the dock is now dredged
and clear. The work of dredging the
basin is still in progress, and while this
is not absolutely necessary it is ex
tremely desirable in order to insure the
safety of the ships. in docking, and the
department is endeavoring to hasten
the contractors in their work. They
estimate that about fifteen days more
will suffice to complete it.

SESSIONS OF
GRAND PARLOR
Plenty of Pleasure, but
Very Little Business
Transacted.
Native Sons Pay Visits to the
Famous Mines at Grass
Valley.
Native Daughters Entertain and Pre
sant Visitors With Beautiful
Quarts as a Souvenir.
Special Disriateh to The Pall.
NEVADA CITY, April 28.â Very littlfi
business was transacted by the Grand
Parlor of the Native Sons to-day, the
greater part of the day being devoted
by visiting delegates and their friends
to sightseeing. The honor of acting as
entertainers was divided between Grass
Valley and Nevada City, it being the
wish of the citizens of the first named
I town to be given the opportunity to
; act as hosts for at least one day.
State Senator Prisk of Grass Valley,
assisted by John Caughlin and others,
took charge of the party that left here
in the morning for Grass Valley and
were chiefly instrumental in providing
for the visitors the most enjoyable day
of the present session. Arrived at Grass
Valley the visitors were treated to a
sumptuous luncheon at the principal
hotel, after which they were escorted
to carriages and driven to the Massa
chusetts Hill mine, said to be the larg
est and best equipped mining property
in the State.
A visit was made to the extensive
underground workings of the mine, and
then the visitors were shown through
the mill where forty stamps are kept
g'.ir.g night and day crushing the rock
as it comes from the workings far
under ground. Many of the Native
Sons remained in Grass Valley during
the evening to participate in the cere
monies attending the initiation of can
didates for the Argonaut dj^ree of the
order.
Those of the visitors who remained in
this city were taken for a drive to the
National mine and the Delaware mine,
a short distance from the city. All who
desired were permitted to visit the
underground workings before return
! ing to the city for dinner.
At this morning's session of the
Grand Parlor quite a spirited contro
versy was precipitated by the effort of
some of the delegates of the San Fran
i cisco parlors to hold a caucus, having
I for its object the selection of two can
didates for the office of grand trustee.
There are several candidates from San
Francisco parlors and much rivalry has
been the result.
The promoters of the caucus scheme
invited to the conference one delegate
from each of the city parlors, an ac
! tion that at once brought about a vio
lent protest from those delegates who
had not been asked to Join the caucus.
I The result was that the only object
I attained was the revival of the old
I spirit of antagonism between city and
country delegates. As the situation
now stands there is every prospect of
a division on these lines when the vote
is cast for grand officers to-morrow,
and if some -sort of a truce is not de
clared in the meantime the contest will
be lively.
Hereafter the sessions of the Grand
Parlor will not extend beyond four days
instead of five days, as has been the
practice for a dozen years or more.
At to-day's session it was declared to
be the sense of the Grand Parlor that in
future the entertainment programme
provided by the Native Sons and citi
zens of the town where the session of
the body Is to be held be so arranged
that the business of the parlor may be
concluded in four days. This under
standing will be heeded by the Native
Sons of Salinas, where the next Grand
Parlor will be held.
This evening the Native Daughters
of Laurel Parlor gave a reception and
entertainment to visiting Native Sons
at Armory Hall. A pleasing feature
of the entertainment was the presenta
tion tn each visitor of a beautiful speci
men of gold quartz as a souvenir of
their stay in the richest mining county
in the State.
To-morrow will be the closing day of
the session. The election of grand of
ficers to serve during the ensuing yenr
will occur. This will be followed in the
evening by a grand farewell banquet
at Armory Hall.
BUILDING IN SAN RAFAEL.
Large Brick Block to Be Erected
at Fourth and B Streets.
SAN RAFAEL, April 2S.â The south
west corner of Fourth and B streets, con
sidered by local real estate men the most
desirable piece of business property in
town, has been, purchased from William
H. Jewell by George P. McNear of Peta
luma, nephew of George W. ICcNear, the
grain merchant. The property has a
frontage on Fourth street of ninety-four
feet and on B street of 150 f-et. The price
is withheld, but is understood to be fair.
On the location at present is a livery
stable, which will soon give place to a
two-story brick building, with offices
above and stores below. All the brick
used will be brought from San Pedro.
TERRIBLY INJURED
BY STELL HOOKS
B. T. Wilson of Red Bluff Is
the Victim of a Peculiar
Accident.
Appliances Used for Snaking Logs
Break, and Fearfully Lacerate
His Fnco.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, April 2S.â B. T. Wilson, a
resident of Red Bluff, had his face fright
fully mangled "Wednesday afternoon
while at work in the woods near the
Terry saw mills in the vicinity of Mont
gomery Creek. With a crew of eight men
Wilson was at work building a logging
chute. A steel cable and a donkey engine
were used to snake logs to the line of
the chute. Heavy steel hooks on the end
of the cable were fastened into a log
that was being drawn toward the chute.
When the cable was drawn taut the hooks
broke and flow backward toward the en
gine, one of them striking Wilson on the
right side of his face, just below the
rhctk bone. His upper jaw was terribly
fractured, brokpn bones protruding mi his,
mouth for fully three inclns. His face
was otherwise frightfully lacerated and
bruised, turning livid within a few minutes.
The unfortunate man was taken to this
city, and as he was anxious to reach
Home before submitting to a surgical
operation, he was taken to Red Bluff on
this morning's local train. It is feared
that he will not survive his injuries. Wil
son is a prominent member of the Odd
Fellows' lodge at Red Bluff, and will be
cared for by the order.
WILL NOT HOLD
THE ROSE CARNIVAL
San Rafael Adheres to the Decision
That Owing to the War Festivi
ties Must Be Abandoned.
SAN RAFAEL, April 2S.â The expected
has happened. San Rafael's rose carni
val has been abandoned. At the meeting
of the executive committee of the Ten
Thousand Club to-night T. H. Rush, who
made offensive remarks at the last meet
ing, was requested to resign as secre
tary. He refused to do so and was re
moved. George T... Richards was ap
pointed In his place.
Director-General Newhall reported that
50 per cent of the money collected for the
carnival could be returned to subscribers.
After some further discussion it was de
cided to return the money and abandon
the carnival for the reason stated at the
last meetingâ war time not being a proper
season for festivities.
TONNAGE TAX
ON SHIPPING
The Owners of Foreign
Vessels Will Be the
Sufferers.
Will Cost Twenty Cents a Ton
Every Time They Enter
a Port.
Effect May Bo to Divert Trade to the
Canadian Seaboard
Cities.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 28.
Foreign Governments, through their
representatives in Washington, are be
ginning to show much concern over that
feature of the war tariff bill now before
Congress which increases the tonnage
tax on transatlantic shipping to 20
cents a ton. It is said this increase is
about 800 per cent, the present rate be
ing about 3 cents per ton, and that
nearly the entire burden of the 800 per
cent falls upon the transatlantic ship
ping of Great Britain, Germany,
France and one or two other commer
cial nations. A leading diplomat stated
to-day that, roughly speaking, the At
lantic trade was carried on by about
100 American steamships and about
4000 British, French, German and other
foreign steamships; also, that the
heavy tonnage tax would be practically
insignificant as against American
steamships, while it would be very
onerous against foreign shipping.
A transatlantic liner of 10,000 tons,
he said, would pay 20 cents per ton, or
$2000 every time it entered an American
port Thus far, however, no official ac
tion has been taken on the subject by
foreign nations, and it does not seem
likely that such official action is pos
sible, as the heavy-tonnage tax is a
war expedient which foreign ships
must bear so long as they use Ameri
can ports. There are intimations, how
ever, that it may have the effect of
diverting shipping away from the
American ports to Halifax, Montreal
and other Canadian ports.
In other respects the war tariff bill
attracts little attention in foreign coun
tries, as the main increase of taxation
is on articles of domestic consumption,
while duties on foreign imports re
main practically unchanged.
NAVAL OFFICIALS
FEAR A DISASTER
No News Received of the Transport
Panther and the Cruiser
Montgomery.
NORFOLK, Va., April 28.â N0 news
of the transport Panther and the
cruiser Montgomery have been received
here. Officials at the navy-yard fear
disaster if the ships were delayed on
the Hatteras coast, but the most ex
perienced navigators unite in saying
that they ought to have gotten well
out to sea before meeting the storm.
Run on Spanish Banks.
LONDON, April 29.â A dispatch to
the Financial News from Madrid says:
The run on the provincial branches of
the Bank of Spain continues. It is
supposed to be a plot by American
bankers to ruin Spanish credit. In
some towns the students and mobs have
prevented the public entering the bank
ing houses to change the notes. Senor
Puigceiver, the Minister of Finance,
says he is confident of being able to
provide the resources necessary.
PROVIDING
THE SINEWS
OF WARFARE
Repeal of Limitations Upon
Purchase of Quarter
masters' Supplies.
Members of the House Support
the War Revenue Bill to
Supply "Men, Bullets
and Cash."
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 28.
Before the debate upon the war reve
nue bill was resumed in the House to
day an urgency war measure was
passed by unanimous consent to repeal
the limitations upon the purchase of
quartermasters' supplies -Â» .ri..g the ex
isting war with Spain.
Payne (R.) of New York, a member
of the Ways and Means Committee,
was the first speaker on the war reve
nue bill to-day.
In the course of his remarks Payne
said that in dit iplined armies and sea
soned soldiers SDain at present had the
advantage, and that it was therefore
the part of prudence to supply the Gov
ernment ..iti all the pecuniary moans
necessary to recruit and prepare our
army for the field. He combated the
opinion of Sayers that $300,000,000 would
be sufficient. Our war preparations
were costing $25,000,000 a month. With
armies in the field the expenditure
would be much greater.
Wheeler (D.) of Alabama, a member
of the committee, announced his oppo
sition to the bond provision, but said
if it was not stricken out he would feel
impelled to vote for the measure.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri discussed
the condition of the treasury. He ob
jected to the leaders of the majority
side picturing to the country a bank
rupt treasury in order to lay a founda
tion for bond issues.
Dalzell (R.) of Pennsylvania, in sup- j
port of the bill said that the loans pro- i
posed to be floated by the pending bill
could not be avoided. He regarded the
bond provision of the bill as its most j
beneficient feature.
McMlllin (D.) of Tennessee criticized
some of the internal revenue features
of the bill as especially onerous upon
the poor, and argrued that the wealth
of the country sl.ould bear a greater
proportion of the war taxes. He quoted
Secretary Gage as saying that $500,000,
000 was sufficient to prosecute the war.
As there were now in the treasury
5200,000,000 he contended that a bond
authorization was unnecessary.
Hopkins (R.) of Illinois commended
the bill as the best that c0..1d be framed
to raise extraordinary revenues. Over
$55,000,000 would be obtaineu from beer
and tobacco, articles of voluntary con
sumption. The remainder would come
from tonnage taxation and from the
stamp tax. ** nioh would fall mainly
upon the classes able to pay. The bond
feature of the bill had been urged, he
said, by the patriotic administration
which was to prosecute the war. He
derided the income tax proposition of
the minority and was especially caustic
in his criticism of the proposition to
issue $58,000,000 of greenbacks. In one
year of the civil war the greenbacks
had cost the Government $300,000,000.
FORECLOSURE
PROCEEDINGS
Griggs Will Soon Begin
a Suit Against the
Central Pacific.
Now the New Attorney-Gen
eral Intends to Collect the
Money Due Uncle Sam.
So Beforo the War Is Over thÂ«
Treasury May Be Augmented by
About Sixty Millions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 28.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: Ef
forts to secure a postponement of the
foreclosure proceedings against the
Central Pacific Railroad will not avail.
Attorney General Griggs assured me
this afternoon that he was giving the
subject his earnest attention, and that
within less than a week a Government
attorney for instituting necessary
proceedings will be appointed and re
commendations made to- the court for
the appointment of a receiver.
But for the extraordinary amount of
work devolving upon him in connection
with the pending war the Attorney
General would have acted before this.
He now has all the papers before him
and hopes to complete a case for the
action of the courts by the first of next
month. He has decided upon the per
son who will be selected to represent
the Government, but he is npt yet pre
pared officially to announce the ap
pointment.
There has been some hope among
Congressional advocates of refunding
the Central Pacific debt that the bill
now pending in the Senate providing on
its face for the sale of the road by a
commission could be passed during the
present session. The opponents of this
scheme, however, declare that the bill
in question would practically give the
commissioners power to refund the debt
and might leave the Government in no
better position than would the passage
of a straight refunding bill by Con
gress.
Senators Morgan, White and Harris
and Representative Maguire and other
opponents of the refunding scheme are
determined that the bill pending in the
Senate shall not be acted upon, and in
view of the promptness in which the
Attorney General intends to move there
is every reason to believe that the re
sources of the Government will soon be
augmented by nearly $60,000,000 derived
I Mann (R.) of Illinois made a brief
speech in support of the bill.
McClelland (D.) of New York, a
member of the Ways and Means Com-
I mittee, said that the great mistake
j that we always made in the past when
I confronted by war had been to under
! estimate the magnitude of the task be

Henderson (R.) of lowa made an elo
quent appeal to the members to lay
aside party politics and give cash with
out reserve to the Government to pros
ecute the war. He had believed that
there would be no war, but it had come.
He despised war. but the chief exeeu
| tive had unfurled the flag, and all his
! brain and heart and energy should go
jto its support. Thus far politics had
! been kept to the rear. Together both
I sides had declared war and rallied the
i young men of the country.
"Let us not," said he, "hurl them
I into the ranks of battle and the jaws
I of death with the sound of dissensions
| ringing in their ears. I care not how
I we provide the sinews of war, so that
: they are the least burdensome. But
taxation there must be. This step
we have taken has already cut down
i our revenues. All our estimates are
I gone. We need men, bullets and cash.
! Let us move up like brothers. Let there
be no this side, nor that side, no Re
publicans, no Democrats. Let us fold
up our campaign speeches and back
up the steps we have taken by giving
; cash without reserve." (Applause).
Representatives Lovering of Massa
; chusetts and Russell and Sperry of
! Connecticut also spoke. Lanaham
j of Texas said he had no serious ob

I and the internal revenue tax would
! provide sufficient revenue for all prac

I of Kentucky and Fitzgerald of Massa*
: chusetts, the latter making a strong de
! fense of the income tax provisions pro

Representative Sherman moved that

which was agreed to.
The committee then rose and at 5:40

from the sale of the Central Pacific
Railroad.
Y/ASHINGTON. April 28.â The Eng
lish stockholders of the Central Pacific
Railroad Company, through their New-
York attorney, have written Represent
ative Maguire and placed in his hands
a number of documents to be used in
pressing the foreclosure of the Gov
ernment's lien on the railroad, stating
that they see no way of protecting their
interests except by co-operating with
the Government in forcing the fore
closure of its mortgage anC the sale
of the property. They state that upon
foreclosure sale the road would bring
a sufficient price to pay the entire
Government lien and the first mort
gage, and assert that hundreds of thou
sands of dollars are being improperly
disbursed that should go primarily to
satisfy the Government claim and leave
a considerable margin for the stock
holders. They suggest their willing
ness to purchase the property for
enough to pay the Government claim,
if no other bidder can be found to pur
chase the property for what they think
it is worth.
Attorney-General Griggs in a letter
dated March 21, 189 S. said: "I have
been engaged for several weeks in pre
paring- to file a bill for the foreclosure
of the Government's lien on this prop
erty, and shall proceed to do so as soon
as I can make the necessary' arrange
ments and prepare the case."
In a letter dated March 31 he said:
"The subject is under way, and as soon
as I am able to confer with the Presi
dent with reference to the choice of
counsel the preparation of the case will
be expedited/]
BLANCO REPORTS
A WARSHIP AGROUND.
Says One of Sampson's Fleet Is in
Trouble, but the Story Is Not
Confirmed.
MADRID, April 2S.â An official dis
patch from General Blanco says:
"Part of the enemy's squadron has
gone eastward. One of the American
ironclads has grounded opposite Dimas,
province of Pinar del Rio, and three
other ships are working to float her.
Spanish volunteers are watching on
shore."
A dispatch to El Imparcial from Ha

Artemisa, Pinar del Rio province, but
were repulsed.
WASHINGTON. April 28.â N0 infor
mation of the grounding of one of our
warships was received either by the
President or the Secretary of the Navy
to-night, and so far as could be learned
no such dispatch reached the Navy De
partment. An examination of the best
Cuban map in the War Department
fails to show any point on the coast
called Dimas, the nearest approach to
it being Point Diamente, on the north
ern coast of Pinar del Rio province, a
short distance west of Havana and in
the blockaded zone. No advices from
Captain Sampson regarding the bom
bardment of Matanzas were received
up to a late hour.

THE EXAMINER AS A LARCENIST.
IT is neither in anger, sorrow nor surprise we call
attention to the fact that the Examiner has once
more been indulging its larcenous tendency. To
be explicit, it has been stealing again. This has come
to be expected. The Call as a public journal feels
bound to record the circumstance just as it chronicles
an instance of burglary, the picking of a pocket or the
latest confidence exploit of a Soapy Smith. The Ex
aminer is the Soapy Smith of journalism.
Yesterday The Call was enabled, through its un
equaled news facilities, to print a full and particu
larly graphic account of the storming of Matanzas.
Arrangements were perfected long ago whereby
every phase of possible battle was to be covered by
the Call-Herald service. Trained correspondents
were dispatched to all available points, tugs and
ocean-going steamers chartered, and the question of
cost permitted in no measure to hamper the com
pleteness of the plan. From a Call-Herald boat cor
respondents witnessed the action off Matanzas. No
other papers had risen to the occasion. The journal
istic world was beaten by The Call-Herald combina
tion. It has been beaten from the firsL There is
reason to suppose that in the future this combination
will continue to show other papers the way. And all
the matter is copyrighted, which adds to the theft
an element of danger. But the Examiner had only
one way to get it. This was by waiting for The Call
to appear, securing an early copy and clipping out
the story. So it was done. The enterprise which
rises to the height of the deliberate expenditure of
5 cents to get the news should not be passed un
noticed. It naturally interests the public; it ought
to interest the police.
Of course the necessity for waiting for its war news
until able to steal it delayed the i = sue somewhat, and
the Examiner with its booty was not on the street
before The Call had satisfied the demand for the la
test information from the front. The belated larcenist
also missed the mails, an incident for which the peo
ple in outside towns have reason to feel grateful but
probably will not.
The position of the Examiner is little less than
pathetic. Long had it clamored for war. Then The
Call scooped it on the explosion of the Maine, while
thellrrald treatedthe Journal the sameway. Forwceks
its editorial room ran ankle deep with bright red
gore. Indeed, occasional splotches of this same gore
have appeared in the paper, labeled as scenes by
special artists. Yet when war actually began in
acquiescence to the demand of the Examiner, that
paper was not there, and could only by the exercise
of its justly celebrated dishonesty form connection
with any one who had been there.
With all its practice the Examiner ought to be less
bungling in method. It ought not, for instance, have
dated its stolen matter from Chicago, when no Chi
cago paper had it. However, it had the judgment
to steal good stuff. We cheerfully give the devil his
due, and to his visible agents on earth extend a sim
ilar courtesy.
The story of the storming of Matanzas as presented
in The Call of yesterday was a graphic portrayal of
the first real action in a war upon which the interest
of the world is now centered. It is also notable in
that there was no other paper having it except the
Herald of Xew York. It is true that other papers
by holding back their forms managed to print tardy
and mutilated accounts of the engagement, but the
fact that they had stolen from The Call-Herald serv
ice was apparent. The publication of an exclusive
story was a striking triumph here. It was even
greater in Xew York, for the Herald is supposed to
have rivals.
An evening paper sets forth that big type does not
make news. In the same issue it has as a headline
the word "Battle" in type three and a half inches
high, so placed (hat when the paper is folded there
is little else visible. And there had been no battle at
the time of the issue. Verily, while big type does not
make news it can make a bluff.
Admiral Sampson's men have been remembering
the Maine. If they got ioo Spaniards they made a
very good start. But it will require 166 more to
square the account. Then the interest must be ex
acted also.
Bunko men who boast of a pull with the Police
Courts are inconsiderate. The least they could do in
decency would be to quietly enjoy the pull without
boasting, as this draws attention to a Police Judge,
who is prone to avoid notoriety.
The brand of neutrality Portugal is displaying
sÂ«e"u to have been cut bias.
THE WAR OUTLOOK.
r\ MERICANS do not misunderstand the situa
/ \ tion and its responsibilities. Other nations are
in a condition of waiting anxiety. The strug
gle may soon broaden and we should prepare for it as
if intending to fight it out alone. Hostility of the
Continental nations is to be expected, and if Spain
had their respect she would not lack allies from the
beginning.
One feature is of deep significance. The South and
Central American nations are silent. It was reason
able to expect from their people evidences of en
thusiastic sympathy. They all owe much to the
United States. They have not turned to us in vain
heretofore for friendship in the complications com
mon to their turbulent and truculent people. We
guaranteed Nicaragua in the Corinto affair. The
Monroe doctrine delivered Mexico from Maximil
ian. We lifted Venezuela out of a difficulty with Eng
land of sixty years' standing. We supported the con
stitutional government of Brazil against the re
actionists of 1894. We have offered them a profitable
market on terms fairly reciprocal, and American cap
ital and enterprise have developed their resources and
energized their industries. Yet they are silent while
we mass our battalions and squadrons to ex
pel from the hemisphere that Government against
which the most of them rebelled. Later on
they will see more clearly the stake they
have in our success. Granting that we, as the
Primate of this hemisphere, have challenged every
power but one in the other, our purpose is not to add
a rood to our territory nor a dollar to our treasury.
We win for the elevation of government and its
higher adaptation to the happiness of the governed.
But suppose the struggle rises to a duel with Conti
nental Europe, can our American neighbors maintain
a silent indifference? If in such a struggle we fail,
every national frontier from the Rio Grande to the
Straits of Magellan is in danger of European invasion
and every national standard from Mexico to the Ar
gentines may be summoned to surrender.
It is no strained forecast of such a possibility to see
that within five years the Continental allies may be
treating with each other for a partition of Central and
South America, and the political geography of this
hemisphere will undergo changes as acute as have
taken place in Europe within the last two centuries.
We hold to these countries south of us the same
relation that England held to the Continent during
the menace of Napoleon's career. When his shadow
was cast from the Skager Rack to the Pyramids the
German, Latin and Russian peoples had to turn to
the Anglo-Saxons of the British Isles to protect their
autonomy and break the Corsican's scheme of uni
versal empire. They had no time to consider the
prejudices of race or religion. Self-preservation
sponged out all such issues. Americans are now
sneered at in the Continental press as dollar worship
ers. So Napoleon sneered at the British people as a
nation of shopkeepers. These epithets only mean
that the two nations by law so protect person and
property rights that their people thrive.
There is a wide difference between a people who
fight to protect the winnings of their industry pro
moted by their government and one that fights simply
to change the angles of its misery and distress. Men
get dollars and have the profits of trade and shbp
keeping only where they are the least hindered by bad
government. The countries in which such men are
found are continually enriched and strengthened by
the immigration of the enterprising from lands where
fortune and enterprise will never be pointed to as a
reproach, for they do not exist.
Spain is an illustration of the decay of a people who
stew in their own juice â of a land that attracts no
immigration.
Our South American neighbors will learn in good
time that they have national existence only because
the United States are planted here, and that if our flag
had not been in the sky theirs would never have been
given to the breeze.
The American spirit rises as the scene is disclosed.
Suddenly embarked in the most majestic military en
terprise in history, made so, not by the formidable
resources of our enemy, but by the issues of right we
have undertaken to establish by the sword, we move
on toward the conclusion, without allies and asking
none, confident that the ship that is freighted with the
hopes of man and bears the destiny of unborn mil
lions, cannot be made to strike her colors.
THE PRIVATE CITIZEN.
DAVID BENNETT HILL, who for some time
past has been known as a statesman without a
job, has made his debut in a new role â that of
after-dinner orator, and according to reports has
achieved on his first appearance a distinguished suc
cess. The scene of the event was a banquet of the
Utica Chamber of Commerce, and the toast assigned
to the ex-Senator was the very appropriate one, "The
Private Citizen."
The speaker has never been noted as a wit or a
humorist, and he made no attempt to rival Chauncey
Depew. His address- was directed rather to the coun
try at large than to the banqueters around him, but
even with them it found cordial approval and respon
sive cheers. He spoke of the character of American
citizenship and of the quality of manhood which the
responsibilities and liberties have developed in the
United States, and, rightly enough, found the best
and most fitting illustration of his words in the man
ner in which private citizens are now confronting the
issue of war.
"Never," said Mr. Hill, "was the true grandeur of
the simple citizen better illustrated than during the
recent crisis of our country's affairs, when with pa
tience, fortitude and hope he awaited for several
weeks the decision of the momentous issue committed
to the determination of those vested in authority,
calm when officials were excited, resolute but not
boisterous, and whether the outcome was to be
righteous war or honorable peace, he was disposed to
accept the conclusion as a wise and just result, having
confidence not only in the laudable earnestness of'
Congress, but in the sincere discretion and caution of
a patriotic President."
This description of the attitude of the private citi
zens of the United States- toward the Government
and the crisis will stand the test of a more critical
scrutiny than is usually given to after-dinner orations.
It accurately portrays the fact. Some yellow journals
and some demagogues denounced the President and
blustered about the delay in Congress, but the great
mass of the people were calm, firm and confident of
the outcome.
Nor is the private citizen disturbed now that war
has come. He is as calm in action as he was during
the weeks of waiting. He relies, as Mr. Hill said,
upon a "patriotic President," and the President can
with equal confidence rely upon the private citizen.
If the Spanish in Mexico really want to take to the
warpath, Texas seems to be just the sort of State to
have along the Rio Grande border.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 29, 1898.
BRING OUT THE FACTS.
ALL good citizens will sincerely hope, now that
United States Circuit Judge Morrow has
paved the way for an exhaustive inquiry into
the accounts of the Southern Pacific Company, that
the Board of Railroad Commissioners will do their
full duty. For a long time the impression has been
general that this corporation is frequently black
mailed by newspapers and politicians. It is not within
reason to assume that it willingly pays out its money.
If it did so it would be an anomaly among human in
stitutions. In fact, everybody knows that the rail
road monopoly corrupts only those who desire to be
corruptedâ those who, like Poo Bah, continually
hold out their hands for bribes.
For proof of this we need inquire no further than
the "advertising" contract between the Southern Pa
cific Company and the Examiner, What rational man
believes that the former agreed in writing to pay the
latter $iooo a month for thirty months on any other
theory than that the money would purchase immunity
for the corporation during that period? Even if there
was no clause in the contract stating in terms that this
was its purpose, the purpose would be plain upon the
face of the instrument itself. What need has the
Southern Pacific to advertise? Does it not already
monopolize every means of transportation in the
State? Why should it seek to induce people to
patronize its roads by "advertising" when they are
compelled to patronize them or walk?
There is reason to believe that the Southern Pa
cific's inability to pay dividends arises largely from
the fact that it is forced to give large sums annually
to blackmailing newspapers and their instruments, the
boodling politicians. Whether this is done to pro
tect the corporation's property from spoliation or not
is immaterial. The question is. Is it done? We
know for a fact that it was done in the case of the
Examiner. We further know that ever since C. P.
Huntington cut off the Examiner's subsidy that paper
has vilified him personally and misrepresented the
corporation of which he is the head, evidently for the
purpose of forcing him to resume business relations.
Now that Mr. Huntington is here he should be made
to tell all about this affair. Moreover, he should be
compelled to show to what extent the inability of the
Southern Pacific to pay dividends on its stock is due
to similar blackmailing operations.
As we understand it, rates of freights and fares on
the monopoly's lines cannot be fixed by the Rail
road Commission so long as it does not earn a rea
sonable interest on the money invested in it. This
is a jurisdictional point which has been settled by the
Supreme Court of the United States. It therefore
becomes the duty of the Commissioners to ascertain
âwith a view to cutting them offâ to what extent the
dividend paying capacity of the corporation has been
impaired by illegitimate expenses. We hope this
work will be taken up by the board at once and prose
cuted to a speedy conclusion.
The public is tolerably familiar with the transac
tions between the Southern^ Pacific and the Exam
iner, but it would like to have further details from
Mr. Huntington's own lips. If his corporation has
been blackmailed at other times by the Examiner, or
by other newspapers, the public would like to hear
about that also. A full investigation should be made
while Mr. Huntingdon is here.
THE FEARS OF EUROPE.
SIGXOR CRISPI, former Premier of Italy,
being now out of office and virtually ou,t of
politics, feels at liberty to talk a little more
freely than other European statesmen, and accord
ingly has been giving his views on the war between
the United States and Spain with a frankness that re
veals some of the inner thoughts of the diplomatists
of the Old World, and therefore helps us to under
stand why in this emergency the sympathies not only
of the Italians and the French, but even of the Ger
mans, are on the side of the Spaniards.
Crispi, in discussing the probable outcome of the
conflict, conceded the success of the United States,
and then went on to say: "It is to be feared that the
Americans, intoxicated by an easy victory, will throw
haphazard all their energy against the European colo
nies left in their neighborhood. Canada assuredly
will be one of their first victims, unless an Anglo-
American alliance is established between London
and Washington â and that would offer to my mind
dangers for the peace of the world."
Abundant evidences exist that the fear of American
growth and development as something menacing to
the peace of the world is not confined to Crispi. To
a greater or less extent it is shared by all Europe.
It shows itself in matters of industry and commerce
as well as in questions of politics and war. The great
nations of the Old World have f>egun a far-reaching
struggle for dominion over the globe, and the con
test is already under way in Central Africa and in all
parts of Asia.
The combined powers of Continental Europe feel
quite capable of driving Great Britain from the field
when the time comes for them to act in concord and
demand the partition of China, the evacuation of
Egypt and the division of Africa, but what if there
appear another Richmond in the field? What if the
United States, a mightier and stronger nation of
Anglo-Saxon blood, rises to take part in the fight?
This possibility of the appearance of the United
States as an active competitor in the world for its
markets and its powers is what alarms the Caesars
of Europe. They cannot be persuaded that the Amer
icans are an unaggressive race. They see our farmers
sending produce to undersell European farmers in
their own markets. They see our manufacturers
gaining trade under the very walls of their own fac
tories. They feel the crushing force of our industrial
and commercial competition in their very capitals.
Seeing and feeling these things, they are frightened
by the prospect of what is to come, and in the new
display of our energies to drive Spain from Cuba
they behold "a menace to the peace of the world. *
Whether these fears are well or ill founded only
the future can make certain. The United States at
present aims at no conquest. We are quite satisfied
with the extent of our territory and have no thought
of aggression, even for the annexation of Canada.
We have, nevertheless, been forced into this war, and
may be eventually forced into another. Europe, in
her aggressive schemes for the partition of the world,
has therefore some reason to fear the growing power
of the United States.
We are drifting, says Crispi, "toward the un
known." This is true, but that unknown which is to
increase {he prestige and influence of the United
States will not mean a menace to the peace of any na
tion that acts rightly, carry aggression into any
fields save those of industry that increase the welfare
of mankind.

THE SUNDAY CALL.
THESE are war times and the boom of big guns has already been
heard. Of course it must follow that when death-dealing missiles
are flying about promiscuously somebody is going to get hurt. For
those who give up their lives for their country there is nothing to be
done except to perform the last sad rites, but not all who fight will
be killed. Many will be only wounded.
It is to look after these that the Red Cross League was formed some
years ago. At a certain peace congress the big nations of the world all
agreed to respect the "Red Cross" whenever it appeared on a battle-field.
A Red Cross brigade is soon to be formed in California, and of course you

their places with a lot of Spanish trou

of servile peasantry, had offered them
selves for the paltry sum of $50 a week.

"There lived some few years ago, and
may be living yet for all I know to the
contrary, in an isolated portion of South
eastern Oregon a gentleman of a saturn-
me disposition by the name of "Jackass"
Cassidy. Cassidy was a tender of flocks
on the honey-scented slopes of the afore
mentioned country, and had earned his
sobriquet by certain characteristics which
had been noticed In his composition by
his numerous frienas and admirers.
"Some thirty miles from the habitat of
Mr. Cassidy there dwelt a gentleman of
large landed acquirements, who owned
bunches of cattle that were wont to stray
through the fences surrounding the domi
cile of "Jackass," thereby causing that
individual much labor and mental dis
comfiture. Jackass thought over the
matter for some time, and concluding tnat
the trespass must cease began to de
liberate on the best manner of bringing it
to an end. After considerable thought he
figured out that the surest and most
satisfactory way to settle the whole
trouble was to kill the owner of the
cattle. Accordingly one fine morning
Cassidy loaded up his six-shooter axid
saddling up the old gray mule on which
he always traveled he rode thirty miles
to the house of his neighbor, and, finding
him at home, Jackass dismounted, tied
his mule to a fence and entered the ranch
house to finish the job as soon as pos
sible, as he had promised to sup and
sleep at the house of a friend as soon as
he had concluded his business. He got j
inside the door, when the owner of the j
ranch hit him on the head with an iron
cuspidor, and then, carefully beating him
into a jelly, threw him outside where he
would bleed in the dust and not soil any
thing.
"Jackass came to in about an hour and
going over to the fence where his mute
was tied, unfasfened that patient animal,
and mounting returned to his. pastoral
home."

who had listened to the story, "but what
has that to do with the capture of the

"I have told you the story," said hts

ALIFORXIA has placed her
purse, her time and her best efforts
.at the disposal of the Red Cross
League and Sanitary Commission.
To the women of the State particularly
this movement is of the closest interest.
Philanthropic women, business women,
society women, are all equally ready to
volunteer in a cause which appeals so
strongly to every loyal heart. For
though she may have turned her atten
tion to charity, to politics, to business
or to society, woman's ruling passion,
which displays itself so admirably in
every crisis, is the mothering one.
The women of California look upon
the stern-faced soldiers who marched
away from the Presidio the other day
with a collective sort of mother love,
that is not content with providing for
their necessities while they are here, but
follows them on, smoothing the difficul
ties that lie in the way. cheering and
comforting them with the assurance of
a tender forethought that is never
weary, never satisfied.
The nurses of the State continue to
volunteer â nurses of all ages and con
ditions, from the woman who realizes
fully what the offer of her services as
war nurse implies to the young hos
pital graduate, whose pretty fair head
is turned with emotions of pity and love
and patriotism.
% "But what about your family?" a
graceful, well-dressed girl was asked
who came volunteering her services,
glowing with enthusiastic unselfishness.
"Oh, they don't like the idea." she
answered, nervously fingering the
slender gold chain that hung about her
neck. "But I'm in earnest and they
know it. So they will have to be re
conciled, for I intend to go. Will you
tell me just when I'll be wanted?"
This question and all others that agi
tate the minds of the ardent, helpful
people who are eager to begin active
operations will be answered just as soon
as the Sanitary Commission can meet
and decide upon the course to be pur
sued.
As to the financial side of the ques
tion, these people recognize that that
is a thing which need not be delayed a
moment. So while the generous offers
of personal services in any and all ways
must for the present remain un
answered, the checks which attest the
fullness of California's generosity and its
interest in the commission are timely
and very welcome.
The next meeting of the commission
on Monday next is awaited with the
deepest interest. In the meantime,
though. California is not idle. Clubs,
societies, individuals all over the State
are putting themselves in readiness to
respond to the President's appeal when
wit shall be made. Whether the call
;.hall be for women's hands to sew or
to nurse, or whether supplies in ma
terial or moiey be required, there can
be no doubting the response that will
come. California's men have filled to
overflowing the measure of soldiers i
demanded by President McKinlev.
California's women are actuated by the
same spirit of generosity, of loyalty and
of fidelity.

THE CALIFORNIA
WOMEN'S CLUB
Largely Attended Meeting at
Which the Charter Roll
Was Closed.
Addresses by John P. Irish and Sev
eral of the Ladies of
the Club.
The Bpaclous upper hall of the Callfor
rla Hotel was crowded to the doors and
beyond yesterday afternoon, the occasion
being the first public meeting of the
newly formed California Club.
It was foretold of this organization at
It? inception that its- pian of action would
attract to it tl>e most prominent and
representative women, and the prophecy
has been fulfilled. Society leaders, ar
tists, musicians, writers, teachers and
â¢women foremost in the philanthropic
work of the community have gathered to
gether and joined forces for the perform
ance of the practical work which is the
object of the now society's being, and tho
meeting yesterday was a brilliant one In
every respect.
John P. Irish, the orator of the after
noon, was introduced by a few well-chosen
words from Mrs. Lovcll White, the presi-
t" the club, and delivered a most in-
ting and inspiriting address on the
t, "What V.'omen May Do in Munl-
Qovernment." Mr. Irish's remarks
were frequently applauded.
The speaker advised the ladles to read
the new charter attentively from begin-
ring to end, to think about it and Its pro
visions seriously and to familiarize them
selves, at least theoretically, with the
requirements and workings of the differ
ent branches of municipal government,
with a view to Intelligently and wisely ex- j
â¢â¢rung their influence toward the better
ment of existing conditions. A charter
â  commission, in which' were three or four
of our brightest and best women, would,
he declared, make a success of a most
difficult undertaking.
At the conclusion of the address Mrs.
Ramon Wilson, head of the department
of art. literature Â«uid music, briefly but
clearly outlined the work which she pro
posed to do. with the co-operation of her
fellow-members, in these lines during the
coming year.
Mrs. XV. H. Mills followed with a very
able paper on the proposed work of the
association as a whole, the special place
which it will endeavor to till in our social
structure and the real need that exists
for the accomplishment of just what it
; aspires and fully intends to do. In the
â¼course of her remarks she gave a con
fdensed history of the famous Chicago
Woman's Club, the shining example
which the California aims to follow and
.excel if possible, and; told of vie great
. benefits that have already accrued to that
â¢ municipality through the wise and help-
the usefulness of the Red Cross League
and Sanitary Commission.
"I was at Harrison Landing on the
James River during the war," he said,
"and it was perhaps the most unhealthy
location in which our command was
camped during the whole Civil War
struggle. It was during the hottest time
of the year and the food served out to us
was not of the kind men live to eat. It
was then that I learned what the Sani
tary Commission could do. That society

membership can now be secured only by
application and Indorsement.

the great lumbering wagons rolled in
through the lines of sentries, protected by
the red cross and carrying the ordinary
garden truck that tasted sweeter than
all the fancy foods ever invented by the
celebrated chefs of the world. Besides
the garden truck that was on those
wagons there was always something for
those in the hospitals. Jellies and jams
and little toothsome delicacies from the
kitchens at home were in those boxes for
the sick, and they were guarded most
jealously. Many a time I have seen big,
strong men stand and gape at a little jar
of jam that was unloaded from one of
those wagons, then follow it clear to the
hospital tent. I do- not deny that any one
of those men would have liked to have
some of the jam just to know how it
tasted, but their interest in it was more
than that. It was from home. Perhaps
not their home, but from a home where
there were loving hands and anxious
hearts for some one at tlie front.

A NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY
The Question Discussed by the
Washington Memorial
Association.
The Necessity of a Oreat School
of Statesmanship and Poli
tics.
A meeting pt the George Washington
Memorial Association was he.- in Golden
Gate Hall last evening, and many stirring
speeches were delivered on the founding
of a national university on the lines pro
mulgated by George Washington. The
hall was well filled and much enthusiasm
was manifested by the audience.
The opening speech was made by Martin
Kellogg, who spoke on the relation of a
national university to State universities.
He pointed out the great and growing
need of a university on the lines of that
suggested by Washington, and thought
that it should naturally exist at the na
tional capital, where its good work could
be effectively carried on without interfer
ing in any manner with the State insti
tutions.
Irving M. Scott spoke on our national
defenses. He referred to the elaborate
systems of defense in times of war pro
vided by Congress, but held that a national
university, properly conducted, would
educate our statesmen above the needs
of these defenses, that they could be so
well grounded In diplomacy at such an
Institution that battles might easily be
won without the assistance of giant guns
or ironclad ships.
Professor Bernard Moses was the
orator of the evening. He "spoke of the
proposed national university as a na
tional school of hisfory and politics. It
would be a place, he said, where the
records of Congress, the diplomatic mes
sages and all which go to make up the
history of a country could be system
atically gathered together. There is no
such collection at present available, and
it would be impossible to secure in any
place other than the national capital
where all these records are kept on file.
With such ;i storehouse of political and
historical information as this our diplo
mats might easily be the best informed in
the world, and could easily cope with and
settle any international complications
which might arise without plunging the
country into warfare.
Dr. Voorsanger spoke of the great
benefit such an Institution would be in
political education, and pointed it out as
a means of raising the standard of
politics above- ring work and "corruption.
To Change the Track.
On the order of General Manager
Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pacific Com
pany work was commenced to-day on the
laying of the third rail which will convert
the narrow gauge track from Alameda
mole to Oakland into a broad gauge track.
They worked under splendid discipline,
and they did much for me while I was
there. From what I saw there I know
women as nurses in the hospitals and at
the front can do much toward making a
soldier's life an easier one to bear during
the times of war. I do not believe much
could be done by untrained volunteers or
the spasmodic efforts of morbid senti
mentality. But If nurses are sent to the
front under the direction of the Red Cross
League and organized for practical work
under the direction of the medical de
partment of the army, it cannot but meet
with appreciation and be a means of pre
venting much suffering and be the means
of saving the lives of many of those who
go to defend their flag and the honor of
their country.
"To lessen the sufferings of the sick and
wounded in time of war is a noble work,
and when such work is systematfted in
accordance with needs and in harmony
with military authority it cannot fail to
prove one of the wisest forms of patriot
ism."
SPOKE OF ITS
NOBLE MISSION
Daughters of the American
Revolution Commend
the Work of Mercy.
A meeting of Sequoia Chapter of the
Daughters of the 1 American Revolution
was held yesterday afternoon at the
Sorosis Club for the purpose of organiz
ing a branch of the Red Cross League.
Many donations were received and gen
eral enthusiasm and patriotism prevailed
during the entire meeting.
Rabbi Voorsanger, who was a guest of
the chapter, in outlining the duties the
members of the league would be -called
upon to perform, said:
"It is very difficult to say what might
be required of the members of the Red
Cross League in the future. The present
we know. The future Is veiled in dark
ness which can only be penetrated by the
I
passing of ttme. It the worst comes and
the dread carnage of war proves Inevi
table, let us hope to meet Its horrors with
a co-operation of effort and tend to lessen
the sufferings of our California boys by
providing for them some comfort when in
need, and nursing them wnen sick or in
jured. In the institution of this Sanitary
Commission, which shall have for Its
purpose the prevention of the spread of
disease and the caring of the soldiers who
have gone from here to fight for the dig
nity and honor of their country, we must
have as one of its prevailing features
tender and loving sentiment. We cannot
\ stop the bullet, but let us hope that our
efforts may prove successful In saving
the life where that bullet has not already
carried death on its cruel mission of hate.
"The greatest danger we will have to
contend with in the present war is not
Spanish bullets. Yellow fever is the
danger. We can defend ourselves one
man against another; ship against ship;
but we cannot frustrate poison. Cuba is
the hotbed of yellow fever, and there is
a serious doubt whether the army will
be able to flsrht it.
"The horrors of the Austrian war in
1566 from the ravages of choleraâ its most
fatal consequence â need hardly be recall
ed to put you in mind of the necessity
of your organization In the present crisis,
as they are familiar to the mind of the
student and those living who survived
the awful plague.
"We should not defer another day In

THE FREE MARKET.
Its Opening Is Recommended to the
Harbor Commissioners.
The committee which was appointed on
February 13 at the suggestion of the
Harbor Commissioners to collect informa
tion and make recommendations regard
ing- a free public market submitted a re
port to that body yesterday afternoon.
The committee had attempted first to
secure a conference with the commission
men, but failed to do so. They then met
representatives of the transportation
companies and found them agreeable to
the proposition, provided sufficient wharf
room could be obtained at one central
point. They then visited the ground, and
it is considered that the Jackson, Wash
ington and Pacific street wharves will
afrord ample room for the vessels to dis
charge their cargoes.
It was recommended that in aJlottingthe
space the first choice of location be de
voted to public traffic and space for
perishable goods. If it is found that
there is room to spare after this it may
be leased out to any merchant or com
mission men who want it, on the condi
tion that it be surrendered if it is after
ward needed for public accommodation.
The following rules governing the
market were recommended:
1. Licenses to sell to be issued only on the
signing of a written agreement to comply with
the regulations.
2. That the orleinal entries of sales in
the market shall be In Ink and show the name
of the person for whose account the saie Is

Should Children Begin the Study of
Drawing?"

mothers will be present to listen to Miss
Ball's interesting address and get poinis
on the education of their offspring.
A GOOD EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW.
preparing ourselves against such fatal
consequences. Now Is the time, and we
should grasp at the opportunity, meeting
the ravages of yellow fever with a do j
fense that must prove Impregnable to ad
vance. I think the step taken by you
to-day in this direction Is one of the
noblest acts of a woman and a mother.
"We' have two distinct duties to per
form during the war. The duty to our
country, which always comes tlrst, and
then our duty toward our boysâ our Cali
fornia boys.
"The impression that has gone forth
about my son expressing a wish to enter
the army is true, and I feel proud of him.
The badge with the letters "U. S." has
been placed over his heart, and he is
now ready for the front, as he received
his enlistment papers last evening. That
he will leave for the seat of war is hard
ly probable, as I think that before the
Government demands him as its servant
Spain shalj have returned a cripple and a
u.sgrace to itself.
"That my son will leave does not say
that 1 will necessarily abandon him to his
fate. I want to be with him when he
needs my care. I want to nurse him
when sick, and I want to lessen the rigors
and trials of camp life. You are mothers
and you know that if they must go they
shall go; and if they go we must go with
them even if we stay here. We can only
hope to accomplish this through the min
istry of the Ked Cross in the camp and
on the battlefield. With It must go our
love, our devotion and maternal care.
"The surgical service of the National
Guard of California needs extension, as it
Is thoroughly inadequate. This deficiency
is attributed to lack of funds, and if we
want the necessary equipment we have to
demand it of the Governor, who will deny
it on the basis that the money is needed
more In other directions.
"In the time of war we do not want to
wait, and In fact we cannot justly wait
for legislation, in order to carry on the
sanitary work that we know is absolutely
necessary for our sons. We want to pre
pare it ourselves. They will need am
bulances, surgical instruments, under
wear, medicines and various other ar
ticles; and this entire humane work de
pends upon you and upon your efforts.
"You must of necessity uphold the tra
ditions created by your ancestors and the
Hag instituted by your fathers. You must
see that the Stars and Stripes do not take
a step backward.
"The same logic that made the Ameri
can Colonist free should free the Cuban
from his oppressive bondage. No matter
what mongrel he might be he has a right
to and should be free.
"When the sacred banner, the emblem
of liberty and freedomâ the stars and
stripesâ is uplifted we must remember
that personal feeling must cease.
"We must identify ourselves aa mem
bers of this organization with the Ked
Cross banners on the field, and when our
boys leave us we must 'follow them on
their way and tend to our children across
tho Gulf of Mexico and on the unhealthy
soil of Cuba with the same tenderness,
the same care that we would extend to
them were we there by thefr side."
Dr. Voorsanger's address was followed
by another upon the same subject by the
Rev. C. E. Cooke of Trinity Episcopal
Church. He said:
"There is absolute need of such an or
ganization and the work which it alone
tan do. The one great danger that will
have to be contended with is disease â the
yellow fever. In view of this fact we
want our boys to feel that when they go
out and away from us that they will De

"I hope that by the grace of God war
and it^ attendant horrors will soon be at
an end and that the California boys will
never, reach the poisonous and mephitic
atmosphere of Cuba."

treatise on the subject of patriotism. She
concluded with the hope that the out
come of the war would result in the
Americanizing of America and forever
blotting out the descriptive adjectives
that half the inhabitants of this country
use in alluding to their nationality. This
should be a country of Americans and as
such should not recognize foreigners who

IMPATIENT
Delay in the Enrollment of
Volunteers Causes Some
Clamor in the Ranks.
Motives of the Governor Misunderstood â Of
ficers of the Guard to Be Retained.
Steps Taken to Hasten the Enlist
ment of Troops.
Governor Budd dropped In at head
quarters yesterday shortly before noon.
Ilf smiled a "good morning" to his
staff, shook hands with General Bar
rett and disappeared into his private
office, closing the door behind him with
an ominous bang.
His arrival was the signal for re
newed activity among the officers pres
ent. Colonel Bush rang for ice water,
while Colonel Burgin immediately pro
ceeded to tell the same joke that he
has recited each day for the past week.
During the forenoon there was a con
stant stream of callers at headquar
ters who came to offer their services
and lives. Prominent among these
was Captain T. G. Cunningham of
â¢any X of the National Guard,
who reported to General Barrett that
he had enlisted thirty students from
Stanford University. The men were en-
I by Captain Cunningham on Wed
lay night, and this recruits Com
pany Kto its full strength. The col
lege soldiers will be given diplomas of
graduation by the faculty as soon as
they are mustered into service.
Governor Budd is displaying the most
laudable judgment and conservatism in
his administration of military af
fairs. He is giving his ear to all, but
his speech to none. He is prepared
to act when the time comes and to act
promtply, but until then he is not go
ing to divulge his intentions to any
one. He said yesterday:
"There has been no change in ths.
;t status of affairs. I am pre
t. and at present am simply
awaiting orders. lam here, not to is
sue instructions, but to obey those
given by the Government."
"Have you received an answer to the
dispatch you sent Secretary Alger ten
dering him the services of a fourth reg
iment?"
"Yes, but I do not care to give it
out."
""Will you say if it was favorably con
sidered?"
"All I can state at present is that
I do not think California's quota will
be raised."
"Have you any idea as to whom the
President will commission as brigadier
ral from California?"
"I have not the slightest idea of
dent McKinley's intentions in the
matter."
"Will you accept the office if it is
tendered to you?"
"I must decline to answer the ques
tlon."
"Have you decided what officers you
wi',l appoint to the colonelcies of volun
teers?"
"Yes, but I have no idea of giving out
their names. A great deal depends up
on the nature of my orders from the
"War Department as to how they desire
the officers to be appointed. I know
what I am going to do, and exactly
how I am going to do it, but until the
time comes for me to act I will make
no statements for publication."
Later it was learned from the adju- '
tant-general that the War Department
had declined the offer of an additional
regiment.
Governor Budd has under considera- !
tion the plan submitted by General
Dickinso-n for raising California's
quota as provided for under the Presi- ]
dent's call, but he has taken no action I
upon It.
lonel James Smith's letter to Gov- j
ernor Budd, which was published in |
lay's Call, was a general topic!
of discussion in military circles yester
day. It seems to be the prevailing
opinion that Colonel Smith's letter fit- i
tingly echoed the sentiment of every
man in the National Guard, especially
those of the rank and filf, who are j
most anxious to keep their present or- i
ganization intact and to be commanded
by their present officers, to whom they
are deeply attached.
T. H. Goodman, general passenger
agent of the Southern Pacific, was clos
eted for a long time with the Governor.
It is presumed the object of his visit j
was with reference to the transporta
tion of troops over his line.
A FALSE ALARM
ALONG THE LINE
National Guardsmen Are
Disturbed by Idle
Rumors.
Governor Bu-!d Firmly Resolved to
Oi\jc Officers and Enlisted Men
the Preference.
T)!spatrhca received by The Call last
night from several points in the State
â how that National Guardsmen have a
wrong impression of Governor Budd's
I â  and intentions. In order to re
move the falsa impression The Call is
authorized by Adjutant General Barrett
i" state that tliÂ»- Governor has firmly re
solved to give the officers and men of the
National Guard the preference for enroll
ment in the volunteer service. In the
appointment of officers to command the
I the officers now holding commis
sion will be retained provided they pass
the; examination required. Should they
fail in this respect their places will be
-r uiiir.-rs of the guard
until that source ot supply is exhausted.
The Governor has steadfastly declined
to promise commissions to any other than
officers of thy National Guard although
very many applications bearing the high
est indorsements have been presented to
him.
In this city and throughout the State
last night there was great activity In
National Guard armories. The period of
delay In calling out the troops is now
about at an end. The mustering ofHcer
ajfd the eiuminins: surgeons should be
full of business in a day or two. As proof
of the Governor's intention to give the
Sixth Regiment a chance, the fact is cited
that arranarenienta were yesterday made
with transportation companies to bring
tlit- men of the regiment to San Francisco,
the i>!ace appointed for rendezvous.
EXAMINING BOARD.
Captain C. E. Haven and Lieutenants
C. H. Holmes and W. C. Bean of Com
pany E of the Fifth Infantry, .N. G. C,
who were recently re-elected to their
present offices, were examined as to their
fitness and ability last night by the mili
tary examining board, composed of Col
onel J. F. Smith and Captain George Fil
mer of the First Infantry, and Major J.
P. Hayes of the Fifth Infantry. The ex
amination was held at the California
Hotel.
IN OPEN REVOLT.
Sixth Infantry Boys Say
They Won't Play.
STOCKTON, April 28.â Companies A
and B, Sixth Regiment, are in open re
volt against going to the front under
any officers other than their own. The
feeling has been running high all week,
as It is contended that the Governor's
apportionment is calculated to break
up the regimental organization. Base
political motives are ascribed to the
Governor, and several hot telegrams
were sent to him from former friends
here. The feeling culminated in a joint
meeting of the companies to-night,
when in caucus they decided to volun
teer in a body, with a proviso that their
own officers be retained; otherwise they
will refuse as a body to be mustered
into the United States service. With
this distinct understanding the muster
roll o-f the companies opened. Full
membership of the companies, 206, with
the exception of a few absentees, ten
dered services. The officers worked
very hard last month, drilling raw re
cruits nightly, and not^ discouraging
men in the attitude taken.
If ever an official came in for a be
rating it is Governor Budd, who. it is
claimed, is disorganizing the militia
by dilatory tactic?. Yesterday the full
membership of the companies could
have been turned out on three hours'
notice; now it will take twenty-four
hours, as many members from the
country got disgusted and went home.
Men say they will not go out of the
State under either political or West
Point officers. The agreement signed
to-night leaves a loophole in case men
wish to back out and in such case they
will act as a unit. Men also say that
the Governor tried to give them a "long
distance jolly" in giving out the im
pression that the pay was to be J2.
Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson is now
directing the affairs of the regiment.
It is understood that Colonel Berry of
Fresno, who is in Alaska, cannot pos
sibly reach here till after the companies
have been sworn into the UnitÂ»d States
service in case they decide to go.
Colonel Johnson has not been con
sulted anyway, and the men regard the
proceedings as giving the Sixth a cold

shoulder all around. Reports from
different cities to-night, where other
companies of the regiment are located,
are to the effect that they followed
largely the action of the companies
here. The officers refuse to talk for
publication, but they talk freely with
the men, and it is not hard to learn
that they think they have been badly
treated. It seems that about the only
remedy for preservation of discipline
and good feeling is an early call to ac
tion.
The Fifth Infantry.
OAKLAND, April 28.â This was a
busy night at the armory of Company
A, Fifth Infantry. The enrollment
pledge, as ordered by Colonel Fair
banks, was opened and signed by all
the members present. The roll Is head
ed as follows:
"We, the undersigned members of
Company A, Fifth Regiment, Second
Brigade, N. G. C, hereby severally en
roll ourselves for muster as United
States volunteers and will present our
selves to the United States officers de
tailed to receive us whenever notified
by the Governor of California to appear
for muster."
The special order also says: "All offi
cers who wish commissions as affi
cers of United States volunteers must
immediately forward written applica
tion with medical certificate showing
physical condition."
The local companies are confident of
marching out with full ranks.
ARTILLERYMEN.
A Number of Applicants
ListedâMedical Examin
ation o? Officers.
The all-absorbing topic of interest at
the headquarters of the First Infantry of
the National Guard last night was the
examination of thirty-four of the forty
six commissioned officers of the regiment.
The examination was conducted by Mav'-r
W. D. McCarthy and Captains P. J. 11.
Farrell and Theodore Rethers of the
surgeon-general's staff, under instruc
tions received from Governor Budd yes
terday, in which it was stated that all
commissioned officers of the National
Guard cf the Slate must, if desiring a
commission in the volunteer service of
the army, first file their application and
appear for medical examination. The ex
aminations made last night are said to
have been very thorough and will havo
to pass the scrutiny of Surgeon-General
Hopkins.
The â â ffieers of Company F. First In
fantry, were busily engaged until a late
hour last night listing applicants for
membership in the company, and a large
number of men already elected were
sworn jn.
The center of attraction, however, was
at the headquarters of Captain S. L.
Naphtaly, recruiting officer of the heavy
I artillery, corner of Tenth and Market
streets, where 105 applicants were listed,
bringing the total for the two days dur
ing which the office has been open up to
I 232 men, a large number of whom have
! seen service in the regular army and in
I the National Guards of California, Mon-
I tana, Missouri, Texas and Utah. There
I are also a number who have served in
the armies of foreign countries.
Late yesterday afternoon Captain S. I*
Naphtaly, recruiting officer of the heavy
artillery, notified all newly enlisted mm
i in that'branch of the service to report at
| the armory, corner of Tenth and Market

SAN FRANCISCO
HUSSARS.
At a council of officers of troops A and
B, San Francisco Hussars, held Monday
evening at 403 Market street. C. L. Stahle,
formerly of the United States cavalry
service, was appointed a corporal in
Troop A. All other appointments were
left over until the next council. This
evening- the enlisted men of the two
troops will be sworn in at Armory Hall,
Pythian Castle, and a general invitation
to be present has been extended to those
desirous of enlisting.
.Â«. .
READY FOR SERVICE.
At a recent meeting of the Austrian
Military and Benevolent Association a
resolution was unanimously adopted to
the effect that the members of the asso
ciation stood ready to tender their serv
ices to the United States Government
whenever called upon. The association
numbers 200 men, all well drilled, and
many who have Been service iv Europe.
"Samson" as an Oratorio.
Salnt-Saens' "Samson and Delilah," ah
opera that never, even under the most fa
vorable dramatic auspices, has been called
an oratorio, was sung as an oratorio
last night by the San Francisco Oratorio
Society at the Odd Fellows' Hall. Rhys
Thomas was the Samson and Miss Yves
Remyngton the Delilah; S. Homer Hen
ley "doubled" in the parts of the High
Priest and Abimelech; Charles L. Parent
Jr. "doubled" as An Old Hebrew and the
Second Philistine; Arthur Mesmer was
the First Philistine, and Clarence Wendell
the Philistine Messenger. The orchestra
was seldom in tune and behaved badly,
and the good vocal material in the chorus
was made but little of under the tame
direction of James Hamilton Howes.
It would be impossible to fairly criticize
the Saint-Saens music through such an
interpretation. Of the soloists, Rhys
Thomas alone did notable well.
Coolies to Be Deported.
A company of twenty-one luckless
coolies In charge of six Deputy United
States Marshals were taken to the County
Jail last evening, where they will be held
until Saturday, when they will be de
ported. Five of them were brought up
from New Mexico under charge of C. M
Foraker, and the remaining sixteen came
from Texas in charge of a posse of
Deputy Marshals headed by R. H. Mer
rem. All of the Chinese entered the
country along the Mexican' border. Unit
ed States Commissioners Maxey and Mar-
shall are the Magistrates in whose courts
the Chinese were ordered deported.
Box Factory Fire.
An alarm was turned in from box 152
at 5 o'clock last evening for a fire in the
American Box Factory at 815-825 Bran
nan street. The damage amounted to
only $25, but a serious blaze was avoided
by the prompt work of the Fire 'Depart
ment. The blaze started over the boilers
in some sawdust which had collected, and
became ignited from overheating the
boilers.

Lost His Bicycle.
Mose Morris, Thirtieth and Noe streets,
' swore to a complaint in Judge Joachlm
; sen's court yesterday for the arrest of
â¢ Harry Fee, a bicycle agent on Market
I street, on a charge of embezzlement,
i Morris alleges that he took his bicycle on
j March 14 to Fee's store to be repaired,
i Since then he has been unable to get it
back, Fee claiming that It was stolen
i irom his store.
Her Skull Fractured.
Elsa McFarland, a girl about 3 years of
age, living with her parents at 418 Golden
Gate avenue, fell or was run over by a
team in front of her parents' residence
yesterday afternoon. She was found un
conscious on the sidewalk by her mother
and taken to the Receiving Hospital. Dr.
Weill found Ihat there was a lacerated
wound on her forehead and that her
skull was sliphtly fractured.
Knocked Down by a Team.
George H. Barsche of San Mateo and
his wife were crossing Market street at
Fifth yesterday afternoon, when he was
knocked down by a passing team. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where a lacerated wound in his scalp was
stitched and dressed. He also complained
of internal injuries.
Fractured His Leg.
John J. McCormack, a carpenter em
ployed by the San Francisco Launcn
Company at North Point, had both bones
of his right leg broken yesterday after
noon and was taken to the Receiving
Hospital. A heavy log of wood fell a
distance of three or four feet, striking
him on the leg.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST INFANTRY. MILITARY SPECIAL,
En route to New Orleans, April 25. IS9S.
To the Editor of The Call, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir: In behalf of
the officers and enlisted men of the First United States Infantry I desire
to express through the columns of your paper their high appreciation of
the patriotic demonstration of the citizens of San Francisco during the
march of the regiment through your city April 20.
We do not flatter ourselves that the demonstration was an expression of
the feeling of friendship toward the individual members of the regiment,
but rather the patriotic sentiment for the flag we carry, and which we
have sworn to cherish and defend.
Though we were not able to show our appreciation, our hearts were
touched by the flowers and good wishes, and of all the many pleasant
souvenirs engraved in our hearts' memory the march through San Fran
cisco will be ever among the dearest and most enduring. With esteem,
esters will be aided In their work by the
Companions o-f the Forest. There will be
gate and game prizes.
The committee of 1898 has been busy in
Oakland for some time past making
preparations for the entertainment of the
delegates to the Subsidiary High Court,
which is to meet next month in Oakland.
There will be an exemplification of the
new ritualistic work by a selected team;
then there will be a banquet.
IMPROVED ORDER OF RED MEN.
Great Sachem F. A. Whipple during the
past week in company with Charles F.
Burgman, great chief of records, and
other chiefs, paid official visits to Grey
Eagle, Teeumseh and Ah-Wah-Nee tribes
of Oakland, Pawnee Tribe of Alameda
and Pocahontas Tribe of this city. In
each wigwam the visiting chiefs were cor
dially received and were pleased to note
that each was in good condition. During
the current week the great sachem will
visit as follows: Monday, Mincloa Coun
cil and Mctamora Tribe : Redwood
City; Tuesday, White Eagle Tribe, this
city; Wednesday, Oshone Tribe, this city;
Thursday, Sotoyome and Modoc tribes,
this city, and Friday, Winnemucca and
Arapahoe tribes, this city.
The great sachem has issued a circular
in which he urges the membership to cap
ture palefaces, reinstate suspended mem
bers and confer with those members who
are ncaring the suspension limit that they
may be retained in the order, so that the
reservation of California may, during the
jubilee year, make as good a showing as
any of the other reservations.
Cocopah Tribe, after the close of Its last
held council, gave a smoker in Its wig
wam that was attended by many Red
? T en and by palefaces who spent a very
pleasant evening.
Reports from Slsklyou Tribe of Scotts
River are flattering and show that the
membership is active and striving hard to
Increase its numerical strength.
WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
'iiie logging bee of Calumet Camp,
given In Red Men's Hall last Tuesday
night, was a very enjoyable affair. There
were present a number of members of
other camps, who, as well as invited
guests, were treated to an evening's en
tertainment of oratory, music and song
and a collation.
YOUNG LADIES' INSTITUTE.
The hop recently given by Young La
dies' Institute No. 7. in Native Sons" Hall,
was a delightful affair, and there was a
large attendance. The grand march was
led by Miss Mac Stein, president of the
institute, and Samuel Haskins, grand
president of the Young Men's Institute.
Miss Stein wore a handsome corn-colored
taffeta silk, trimmed with turquoise vel
vet, and she carried a bouquet of reseda
roses. The march included the beauti
ful and intricate figures of the cotillon,
and was a very pretty sight.
THE THIRD BRIGADE.
VISALIA, April 23.â The patriotic mil
itary fever is strong here at this time.
A few days since Captain Ward, com
manding Company E, Sixth Infantry,
posted a notice at the armory announc
ing that he desired men to bring up his
company to the maximum wimber, 103,
rank and file. In less than tivo days he
secured more applications than he re
quired. Several of the high school boys
enlisted. One of these wno could not ob
tain the consent of .his parents to join the
company went home in diSRUSt and ex
pressed the hope that some Spaniard
might "do him up," for he wanted to
fight for his country, but was not al
lowed to.
A number of the business men of this
place who are members of the local mili
tary company have for some time past
been putting their affairs in order, so
that if called into service, they may be
able to leave at a moment's notice.
Captain Fred W. Ward, whose term as
captain of Company E has just expired,
has been appointed adjutant of the Sixth
Regiment, vice Othello Scribner. This is
a promotion that has come to a worthy
officer.
George W. Stewart, who succeeds Cap
tain Ward as commander of Company E,
has decided to go to the front with his
men whenever ordered. He was lately in
stalled as registrar of the United States
land office, and as a Federal officer would
be exempt from service. He will, how
ever, put a substitute in his office instead
cf in the ranks.
Company E was Inspected on the 22d
inst., and the men made a very credit
able showing. There was more interest
manifested at that inspection than there
has been at any for many years past.
Colonel T. J. Hay of Fresno was present
during the inspection.
Samuel T. Hulen and John L. Bowen
have been appointed corporals of the
local company, and they are engaged In
drilling the awkward squad.
RIFLE PRACTICE.
This afternoon there will be a meeting
in brigade headquarters of the several In
spectors of rifle practice in response to st
call from Colonel Park Henshaw, inspecJ
tor general of rifle practice. While it Is
not known what portion of the guard will
be selected for service under the call fo*
California's quota of volunteers, it is thi
desire to establish rules and regulations
for rifle practice that the balance of thi
guard may fully comprehend at the nexfc
State shoot. It is expected that the ex
isting rules and regulations will be ra
vised so that those who will be calleli
upon to face the targets, in order to pef
fect themselves in the art of marksmaifi
ship, will know just what is expected of
them. The time has come when every
man in the guard should know how to
shoot well, and the men declare that the
rules should be such as to encourage
them instead of hampering them as do
the present rules.
THE NAVAL MILITIA, j '{':
Active work is being kept up cm board
of the ' Marlon and no one, not members
of the National Guard or of the United
States' army or navy, is' permitted to
board the vessel. The same rule is en
forced on board of the Pinta at San

GUNNERS ALERT
AT FORT POINT
Artillery Troops Are on
Duty Day and
Night
Work Ready for Volunteer Ar
tillery Men Under Cali
fornia's Quota.
Suggestion That thÂ« Naval RÂ«Â»erT9
Should BÂ« Used for Patrol
Duty Outside.
Colonel M. P. Miller, Third Artillery,
commanding the defenses of San Francis
co harbor, has withdrawn the garrisons
from Angel Island and Black Point and
re-enforced the garrison at Fort Point.
The formidable battery of 12-inch
breech-loading rifled guns at Lime Point
and the auxiliary battery of smaller cali
ber guns are manned by Captain Birk
himer's Battery L of the Third Artillery.
The guns at Alcatraz are handled by
Captain Hobbs' Battery X, Third Artillery.
The mortar and dynamite batteries and
the modern 12-inch and 10-inch disappear-
r lng rifles at Fort Point are manned by
Battery A, First Lieutenant Rumbough;
: Battery H, Captain James O'Hara; Bat
tery I, Captain Danes; Battery G, First
Lieutenant Randolph; and Battery E,
Captain Pratt.
The Presidio Is garrisoned by a squad
ron of the Fourth United States Cavalry,
Lieutenant-Colonel Morris commanding.
Troop X is commanded by Captain Ben
son, Troop I by Captain Lockett, Troop
C by Captain Gale and Troop B by First
Lieutenant Neall.
Constant vigilance is maintained day
and night at the reservation to guard
against the intrusion of suspicious char
acters. Strangers and unauthorized per
sons are not allowed to approach the
magazines or guns.
The force at the outer works was aug
mented yesterday by the arrival of Bat
tery E from Fort Mason and Battery G
from Angel Island. The men are at the
guns day and night, and are therefore
ready to open fire on any suspicious craft
seeking to enter the bay. So far as can
be ascertained, Colonel Miller has not
been advised that the naval force is main
taining a vigilant patrol outside the
heads. A sharp lookout is maintained,
however, from the shore, and a vessel of
the enemy could not approach without
some warming signal. It seems strange,
however, (that the excellent naval re
eerve Is not placed on duty to patrol the
Â° HMs just possible that the naval
authorities, trusting to the remoteness of
San Francisco from the scene of active
hostilities, are serenely taking it for
granted that no Spanish cruiser or gun
boat would dare come to this harbor.
The appointment of Colonel Miller to
command the defenses of the harbor Is
regarded by army officers as timely. They
figure that he will take the necessary
precautions to prevent surprise by stealth
as well as to resist open attack. The
presence in the bay of the Monterey, com
manded by the gallant Carlin, is contem
plated with much satisfaction at this
1 From this on until the close of the war
the soldiers of tne Third Artillery' â¢will
live on the tented field. The distance from
the Presidio Barracks to the guns at Fort
Point is too great to be traversed In
event of attack, hence the tents will be
pitched near the guns. _.._-. .. âÂ«,
There is not the slightest doubt that
plans of the workÃ commanding the har
bor of San Francisco are in the posses
sion of the Spanish military and naval
authorities. Captain Casa. military at
tache of the Spanish Legation at Wash
ington, was in this city last winter for
several weeks, the guest of the Spanish
Consul, and while he was here had ample
opportunity to stroll about the works. He
was here before the Maine was destroyed
and before the orders were Issued prohib
iting strangers from strolling In the re
gion of the batteries. Knowing the for
midable character of the defenses, ha
would probably advise the Spanish Gov
ernment to beware of attacking this city.
Since he left these parts the defenses
have been materially strengthened by the
addition of rapid fire guns. The location
of these guns has not been made public
The Lime Point position has been made
exceedingly formidable in many ways
during the past month.
Inasmuch as the Government has with
drawn from the forces in this harbor the
battle-ship Oregon, the monitor Monad
nock, one regiment of infantry and two
light batteries of artillery, there should
be no delay in recruiting for immediate
use the four batteries of heavy artillery
called for by the Secretary of War. It is
obvious to the officers of the united
States army that California was called
upon to furnish four batteries of heavy
artillery in order that the force of rol
diers for the defense of this harbor
should be Increased. The proposition is
advanced that the first battery of volun
teers should be mustered in as soon as
the required number of men respond to
the call. The muster in of the others
should follow as soon as they are re
cruited.
Major Davis, United States engineers,
has been placed in charge of the light
house service of the Pacific.
Upon recommendation of the chief sur
geon of this department, Major William
H. Corbusier, surgeon, will, in addition to
his present duties, render medical attend
ance to the garrison at Fort Baker.

FOR DUTY AT THE

Some River Vessel Will Be Armed

PORTLAND, Or., April 28.â A Wash
ington special says: It is the intention
of the Navy Lkepartment to have one
auxiliary naval vessel stationed at the
mouth of the Columbia River for its
protection or in case of necessity. The
probabilities are that one of the mer
chant vessels which has been in the
â  service in the Columbia River will be
used for this purpose, or some vessel
that can readily be obtained in the
Columbia. She will probably be
manned with six-pounders and rapid
fire guns. The Oregon Naval Reserve
Will probably be mustered in for ser
vice as a crew. But it is desired that
men familiar with the river and the Pa
cific Northwest be in command or in
position to render service on board the
cruiser.

in the country; in next Sunday's
Call.
MR. HOBART NOW
IN THE CHASE
Scored a Win Astride
William OB in the
Gentlemen's Race.
In a Fierce Drive O'Connell
Was Beaten a Nose by
Tripping.
Four Choices Toppled Over â Hunts
man First In the Steeplechase
at Odds of 13 to L
Another gentlemen's race has been de
cided, and one more name finds a place on
the beautiful silver trophy offered by the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club to be given to
the rider thrice successful in finishing
first. Mr. Skinner, Mr. Dunphy and Mr.
Walter in the past have each scored a
win. and yesterday Walter Hobart, well
known the country over to lovers of the
thoroughbred, placed himself on an equal
ity with the gentlemen named in the con
test by piloting William O"B to victory
in clever style. The big bay horse was
favorite in the betting, and Mr. Hobart
at his very best in the saddle, never left
the result in doubt, leading from the
start, and finishing half a length before
Metaire in a jollying finish. Henry Fors
land, on the latter, rode an ill-timed race,
making his supreme effort when the race
was beyond his grasp. Tulare, with Mr.
Hume in the saddle, was a good third.
The racing throughout was the best of
the week, and racegoers were out in
large numbers. The bookmakers had an
inning, for four well played favorites were
rocked to sleep.
In the opening three and a half furlong
scramble for 2-year-olds, Gold Fin, the
favorite, experienced no difficulty in
downing a large field with ease. In a
drive, Eddie Ames on the 30 to 1 shot
Britomartls took the place from Cross
molina by half a length.
The eastern sprinter O'Connell met with
a piece of hard luck- in the six-furlong
sprint. Backed from 7 down to 4Vs. when
apparently winning a furlong from the
wire Perry broke one of his stirrups, and
"Skeets" Martin on Imp. Tripping got the
verdict by a nose in 1:18%. Recreation,
the favorite, could not keep up, finishing
last behind Sardonic.
The crowd got aboard Reno at even
money to win the short course steeple
chase, and after leading over the first
two jumps that "lepper" was raced off
his feet, ultimately fetching up a distant
third. Huntsman, with Shepard up and
15 to 1 in the closing betting, fenced in
superb fashion and won easily from Our
Climate, another outsider. Oov. Budd,
Silverado and Esperance all came to
grief.
The seven-furlong selling run was cap
tured by Elsmore, second choice in the
hotting, ridden by "Skeets" Martin.
Thorpe on the favorite, Don Luis, was a
trifle late In getting up, and in a drive
was beaten a neck.
The faint-hearted Midas was sent to
the post favorite for the concluding five
and a half furlong scramble, and after
leading to the stretch began to falter.
Thorpe, on Naranja, then took the lead,
and stalling 1 off the rush made by Martin
on Fortuna, got the decision by less than
a length.
TRACK NOTES.
Eddie Jones wu again given a. hearing be
fore the stewards of the California Jockey
Club yesterday forenoon. Nothing of import
ance was developed and the case of the sus
i pended rider remains unchanged.
The Judges sttll have Mr. Corri&an'B protest
apalnst the claiming of Chihuahua by Tom
Cooke early In the week under advisement.
Trainer Jimmy Coffey has a two-years' lease
on five superbly bred two-year-olds owned by
Prince Ponlatowskl. The most promising; ones
of the bunch are St. Kristlne. Violence and
Cleodoro. Jimmy pays all expenses Incurred In
training and takes 60 per cent of their win
nings.
Perry, who for the first time In this suction
of the country appeared up on the back of
O'Connell, Is no novice, as he piloted the big
sprinter In winning races East. Breaking a
stirrup lost him the race. He lost his balance
when the wire was reached, falling to the
ground.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club has again en
gaged the services of James F. Caldwell to do
th*Â» starting at Ingleslde during the season
18SÂ»S-K<. His starting during the season about
to close has been far above the average and
no l>etter selection could have been made.

Eolo as their paternal parent and not lne
Judge, as has been Incorrectly stated.
Huntsman was quite a hot tip in the down
town pool rooms. At the track the Jumper
was in poor demand, which accounts for his
price receding to 15 to 1.
The stewards of the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club met last evening at the Palace Hotel,
when the cases of several suspended turfmen
were reviewed.
It was rcommended to the license Committee
of the Turf CongTess that the license of Sid
Reagan, owner of Lone Princess, be revoked.
The case of H. W. Mason, owner of Lobos.
will receive further probing to-day. Jockeys
Snider, Barry, Madden and Peters were denied

CONSOLIDATION
OF THE LEAGUES
An Expert's Opinion on
What It Promises to
the Public.
Question of Going Under the
National League's Pro
tection.
Joa Corbett Thinks We Are Good
Enough as an Independent
Organization.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Now that the two local leagues have
consolidated joy reigns supreme in the
hearts of the faithful and consistent
"rooter" over the prospect that at last
his long wished for opportunity to wit
ness some real good baseball is about to
be realized.
The Immense amount of enthusiasm al
ready manifested among the lovers of the
YOUNG GRIFFO. "BULL" MCCARTY.
Principals In the Fatal Boxing Mill at Sacramento.
frame over this consolidation only goes to
demonstrate that our great natl."Â».al
game is not dead in California by any
means. The managers of both leagues
are to be congratulated.
While it is true this combining of forces
was brought about only after much
wrangling and numerous heated argu
ments, Btill when it is considered that
both leagues had invested a great amount
of money and had receivÂ«l no returns, it is
no wonder that a peaceful settlement
came>Dnly after the financial affairs of all
concerned were amicably adji ted. At
Wednesday night's meeting a number of
other very important points were dis
cussed, among them the advisability of
having National League protection.
The majority of managers. I am inclin
ed to believe, are not in favor of it, al
though Mr. Ewing of Oakland for a while
made a very strong argument in favor
of its adoption by the new league. He
claimed, and justly so, that without it
players, in the event of their becoming
"stars," could very easily go East, no
matter how much their services were
needed here, whereas under this so-called
protection a player having received an
offer from some Eastern club must first
have the consent of his manager before
he could entertain any proposition to
play elsewhere.
However, the fnct that a number of
good Eastern players are now on the
coast should not be overlooked by this
new organization. These players are at
present playing with the various teams,
but they must stop the moment the Pa
cific Coast League courts National pro
tection. There is an evident lack of good
material in most of the clubs, and they
should not be further weakened by
compelling thoso who have played East
to stop. The "fans" want to see good
baseball, and as the game has advanced
most wonderfully in the past few years
it would be to the interest of the new
league to court Eastern players well
versed in the game. They can coach
those players who through the decadence
of the game for the past few years 'n
California have been unable to keep in
touch with its progress.
Should this be done good ball and large
crowds will necessarily result. California
does not need this National protection.
We have been just as successful without
it, If not more so; then why catpr to it?
Let California boast of an independent
league, where players especially are
Blven a fnir chance; the managers will
no doubt take carp of themselves. Recre
ation as a ball park is far the superior of
Central, and all league games should be
played there, where a real live ball should
be used. .

Power of Supervisors Defined.
City Attorney Creswell filed an impor
tant opinion with the Board of Super
visors yesterday relative to the power of
the board to share the expenses of grad
ing streets with interested property
owners. The opinion concerned tlv^ grad
ing of Harrison street, between Fifth and
Sixth, where improvement? were made
below the official grade and in conse
quence for the protection of property cer
tain work is now a necessity. According
to the opinion the board is allowed to
share the expense with the property
owners.
On Trial for His Life.
A jury was secured In Judge Wallace's
court yesterday to try Charles Dean, a
half-breed Chinese, who stabbed and
killed Wong Yup Sing, a Chinese woman,
on February 14 last, at 639 Pacific street.
Dean was jealous of the woman, and.
calling her to the front door of the house
in which she was living, stabbed her
several times. Dean pleaded guilty to a
charge of murder several weeks ago, but
afterward withdrew the plea.
YOUNG GRIFFO'S
BLOWS FATAL
"Bull" McCarty Dies of
Injuries Received in
the Fight.
Concussion of the Brain Caused
by the Series of Punches
Administered.
While No One Blow Was Serious,
the Continued Hammering Cul
minated in Death.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 28. â "Bull"
McCarty, who was knocked out by
Young Griffo last night, died to-night
at the Sisters' Hospital.
The Sacramento Athletic Club, under
whose auspices the fight was held, is
very much exercised over the affair,
and the belief is prevalent that it may
be a death blow to fistic sport in Sac-
ramento. The fight was a fair one and
in no sense brutal. Young Griffo was
exceedingly merciful in his treatment
of McCarty in the ring. He delivered
very few of those body blows which are
considered the most dangerous, and
paid attention chiefly to pounding Mc-
Carty on the head and face. Early
in the fight he had McCarty weak and
bleeding, but McCarty was game to the
last.
It was the continued rain of blows
on the head that injured McCarty, no
one blow being sufficiently hard to
have produced death. When McCarty
went down in the twentieth round it
was from a blow so light that had he j
been In any kind of condition it would
scarcely have s^ggered him. He fell
on his hands and knees and managed
to struggle to his feet before counted
out. Another weak blov sent him to
the floor again, but neither time did
his head come in contact with the j
boards.
The injured man was helped to his
corner by his seconds, who worked over
him with water, fans and towel for I
nearly an hour without being able to |
render him conscious. Medical aid
was summoned, but it seemed that Mc-
Carty was even beyond the skill of
physicians. At a very early hour this
morning McCarty was still unconscious,
and was removed to the Sisters' Hos
pital, where he was attended by Dr. I
Charles D. McGettigan, medical super
intendent of the hospital, and Dr. A. i
M. Henderson. An examination showed
that the injured man was suffering
from concussion of the brain. Both
eyes were dilated â one considerably
more thanNth.e other, and the heart was
beating very\&lowly. A further exam
ination showed t^hat the right lung was
congested and the. indications all point
ed to concussion of the brain and par
alysis.
Dr. McGettigan said at noon to-day
that the case of McCarty was most ser
ious and that there was every proba
bility that his death would ensue. The
doctor expressed the opinion that Mc-
Carty's condition was brought about,
not by the fall, but by a succession of
blows in one place on the head, no one
of which was in Itself sufficient to pro
duce the injury, but which, in the ag
gregate, might easily account for tha
brain concussion from which McCarty
appears to have suffered.
Dr. T. W. Huntington was also called
into the case, and it was stated that
he shared in the belief that McCarty
would die.
R. E. Callahan, chairman of the en
tertamment committee of the Sacra
mento Athletic Club, was Interviewed
this afternoon in regard to the Griffo-
McCarty fight, and asked how he ac
counted for the collapse of McCarty.
"McCarty was In first-class condi
tion when he went into the fight last
night," Callahan said. "Professor John
Shenk pronounced him perfectly sound
and declared that he was fully able to
do battle. After the ninth or tenth
round I was of the opinion that thÂ»
fight was an even proposition, and
there would be no further punishment
delivered on either side. I was so sure
of this that I left the ringside to at
tend to other duties of the club. I re
turned at the sixteenth round, and
asked McCarty's attendants what con
dition he was in, and they said first
class. He did not care for any at
tendance from them and did not wish
to have his legs rubbed, or, in fact,
have any of those things done which
are necessary when there is a hard
fight. There was nothing to Indicate
that the man n-ss injured at any tim<\
and when the audience yelled to Griffo
to knock McCarty out I did not think
Griffo had the strength to do it."
Chief of Police Dwyer has wired Chief
Lees to arrest Griffo, and will also take
into custody all the principals on either
side, on a charge of manslaughter.
About midnight Young Griffo was lo
cated by the searching officers, taken to
the City Prison and placed in the
"tanks."
GRIFFO MUST ANSWER.
He Whipped a Man to Death Who
Was in No Condition to Fight.
Young Griffo. the Australian prize
fighter, cried like a child last evening
when he heard of "Bull" McCarty's
death In Sacramento. It was said that
McCarty died from the effects of the
punching ho received from Griffo, but
this is the first time In the history of
Griffo that even a knockdown was scored
by the clevor Australian.
Griffo is not a heavy hitter and there
are many people who scout the idea of
McCarty having died from the effects
of Grlffo's blows.
McCarty is not from the East as
stated. He was unearthed recently from
the boxing files of the San Francisco
Athletic Club and shipped to Sacramento
purposely to box the Australian, as there
were few if any other boxers among the
local fraternity who cared to contest
twenty rounds for the small amount of
coin that had been offered by the Sacra
mento club.
It was stated last evening by sports who
knew McCarty well that the pugilist was
not in the best condition to engage in any
kind of athletic contest, and tV> - â¢
should not have been allowed to enter thÂ«
ring. Harry Woods, who was oiic ..^-
Carty's seconds, was arre.sted last even
ing] in this city, and Grifto said he was
willing to stand .the consequences and
would surrender to the authorities. It
w^s evidently a case of "completely out
of/ condition" that ended McCarty's
career as a fighter.

Dr. \V. P. Smith.
Horace Davis followed with a lecture
on "Individualism." He ppoke of the
communism which was character! sties of
families in Japan, how everything is for
the family, with utter fargetfulnesa of
self. if a man's father were a cobbler,
the son must needs be, if the parent were
v blacksmith, the same trade would be
followed by the male offspring. Not only
In Japan, he said did this condition exist,
but in the earlier ages it was universal.
The first nations or people to break away
fiom it and adopt individualism were the
Romans and Greeks. . Mi i.
He then went on to show how individ
ualism helped civilization, how it in
creased, in fact being the means of bring
ing out art and literature. He continued
with his subject with eloquence, and at
trie end he said that the people were
beginning to pause now and wonder if

RELIGION THAT ENDURES.
Professor Jordan's Lecture to the
Conference Last Evening.
"The Religion That "Will Endure,"
was the subject which David Starr Jor
dan discussed at pome length at the
meeting of the Pacific Unitarian Con
ference last evening.
In his introduction he said: ''The re-
Ifglon of authority, the historical re
ligion, the religion of our fathers, the
religion that by authority brings
masses to the church, and the religion
uf reason are the two great religions.
The religion of reason is where each
man reasons out his own salvation,
these are the two religions which will
i endure," a Catholic priest once said to
: me.
Dr. Jordan then went on to show
what these two religions were, and how
i sometimes the religion of authority
hed those that the religion of rea
son could not reach, and how often
when men became weary with reason
they wandered back to" authority to
find rest. "The weary want comfort,"
he said, "and after battling with rea
son turn back to the church authority.
That which is called occult and mys
terious is spiritual impoverishment,
and where there is no idea, where there
Is nothing, it is called occult or mys
terious. It is the degeneration and de
cay of religion."
Professor Jordan then gave a defini
tion <>f religion. "Religion is devotion
in action, to act, to work, to feel, not
to go over a formal ritual in a sleepy
way and listen to beautiful music. It
is worshipful love and life." â¢
He then continued and spoke of to
day. He admonished his hearers not
to dwell on the future or the past, but
live in the present, "the past is a long
way off," he said, "and so is the fu
ture. To-day is our worldâ to-day is
our life. To-day is the only thing that
we really know, it is the only bitter sod
we have, the only world we have."
Dr. Jordan then concluded his ad
dress with a few remarks on duty and
virtu" being but parts of obedience.
When the professor took his seat he
v. as complimented by the enthusiastic
applause of the audience.
Dr. Martin of Tacoma and Rev. H.
Stebbinfl of this city followed with a
discussion of the subject. Dr. Martin
particularly sho\ ed his learning, and
his delivery was particularly pli-asing.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 29, 1898.
WHEAT SLOWS
ITS HOT PACE
Another Interesting Day
on 'Change Yes
terday.
Several Events Slacken the
Upward Tendency of the
Market.
Indications That There Will Be a
Pretty Stiff Price AH This
Year.
There was not so much excitement as
usual in the wheat market yesterday, be
cause traders pot the idea that American
manipulators were at the helm manipu
lating the British market. As a result of
the suspicion the market closed at the
forenoon session at %i 80%, though at the
opening December wheat closed at ?1 84%.
May wheat was the weakest in the mar
ket yesterday, and it was freely ouered
by brokers.
It was evident to all close observers
that the weakness of the Chicago market
caused considerable depression in the lo
cal market. Barley opened quite strong,
the price on December being $1 35, which
soon advanced half a cent. Later in the
day the depression in wheat caused a
drop in barley, which fell to $134, but
afterward gained three-eighths of a cent.
[mportations of corn also contributed to
the weakness of the barley market.
Liverpool cables reported July wheat
advanced equal to 16 cents. Chicago quot
ed July wheat 9Sc on the curb before the
regular opening of the board. Added to
this sensational advance strong Conti
nental cables came, following closely the
advance made in English markets. The
cargo market was strong, sellers asking
extreme prices and not anxious to dispose
of their foods at the asking quotations
Russian exporters were offering very lit
tle. The inquiry from France was 6f an
urgent nature. Paris reported home sup
plies almost exhausted, with markets
hi avily oversold. The same conditions
prevail throughout the United Kingdom.
America is about the only source of sup
ply now open to the United Kingdom
The extreme high prices offered for No
2 red winter wheat in the Chicago mar
ket have failed to increase receipts be
yond that of ordinary markets. The to
tal visible supply east of the Rockies
amounts to 25,100,000 bushels. Home con
sumption requires one million bushels per
day. Kxports will net ten millions per
month. It is a. fair estimate to say there is
not more than 25,000,000 bushels in farm
ers' hands. This would make the total
available stocks for consumption and ex
port requirements 50.000,000 bushels.
New wheat will not be available before
July 1, or in about sixty-five days, bas
ing requirements on 75,000,000 bushels,
which is fully ten millions less than re
quirements. It is not difficult to see that
manipulation can advance prices to a fig
ure that might now appear prohibitory.
It is these facts which cause shorts .â¢â 
run to cover quickly when evidence of
strength is shown. The conditions ,v
California are that there will be very lit
tle wheat for millers. In order to keep
their mills going wheat will have to be
imported from Oregon and Washington.
Yesterday's market was somewhat dis
appointing to the bulls. December wheat
opened at $1 54%, sold at $1 84%, closing at
J] B*4 at the first morning session. It be
came" apparent that Chicago had received
its full advance at the star"t. This seemed
to temper the talent for a break. Little
by little the selling began until timid
shortH, encouraged by their more daring
leaders, began a raid, which carried the
price to $178%. This was the prevailing
price after the closing session. Buying
by small shorts steadied the price to
1179%; later the price declined again io
$1 7fc^, where it rested for the day. The
bears used heavy receipts of Oregon
wheat at Stockton as a basis of attack.
It is claimed 100 cars of Oregon wheat
were received at that point during yes
terday. May wheat was sold freely by
shippers, the price dropping to $1 80%,
against $1 S9 on Tuesday.
K. A. Bresse sold a heavy line of long
wheat at the first session. He was a fair
buyer of barley. L. Kauffman sold wheat
freely throughout tho day. J. de Ruyter
sold considerable wheat, supposed to be
for a prominent shipper. Cutter & Mobp
ley were good buyers of wheat early, but
turned sellers later in the day. Balllnger
bought wheat early in the session. Ro
senberg sold barley. Mayhew saw the
decline coming and got on board.

HUNTINGTON
KNOWS SECRETS
Now He Will Be Asked
to Reveal Them
Explicitly.
To Show How Much Southern
Pacific Money the Examiner
Received.
A Duty the Railroad Commissioners
Owe to Themselves as Well
as to trie Public.
Much interest has been taken in the
decision of Judge Morrow m the Rail
road Commissioners' case. While the
purport of the decision is generally un
derstood a brief explanation may not be
out of place.
The Railroad Commission had sought
to make a certain rate on grain ship
ments. The Southern Pacific set up the
claim that it could not make the haul
at the schedule specified, and that the
commission had no right to fix an ar
bitrary rate until the road should be
in receipt of profits applicable to divi
dends. Then the commission tried to
find out why there were no profits. It
wanted to know if money had been di
verted for the corruption of courts,
Legislatures, newspapers or individuals,
expressing its belief that if this use of
funds could be established its right to
fix a rate would not be impaired by the
apparent absence of promts.
At once there was demur on the |
part of the company. It did not de- I
sire its inner workings laid bare and I
an injunction was issued, temporarily ;
depriving the commission of power to |
act. Relative to this injunction testi
mony was heard by a special master in
chancery, who took the ground that the
\ proposed, inquiry was relevant, timely !
i and proper. In this view he has been j
| sustained by Judge Morrow, and the
cat will soon be out of the bag. The
commissioners have full liberty to trace
every expenditure from the treasury of
the Southern Pacific to the ultimate
pocket. It will drag secrets from un
willing witnesses and occasionally be
cheered by finding a willing one.
Naiurally the public feels a sense of
gratification.
One o* the important witnesses will
be C. P. HuntingOn himself. The Ex
aminer has been urgin-? upon him the
duty of telling all he knows about
Southern Pacific affairs, and he knows
much. The spirit of self-sacrifice which I
impels that paper to clamor for the
whole truth has heretofore been pleas
antly mentioned; for some of the most
damaging information the venerable
president of the corporation can pos- :
sibly uivulge will show the Examiner!
as a daily offense against morals. There
is about this stut^iuent nothing of con
jecture. Mr. Huntington has already i
confirmed it. Of course he will be ask- ]
ed to reaffirm it under oath. If the
commissioners were to neglect so plain ,
a duty, the rumor that they are under !
the control of Hearst or his agents
would begin to represent actual belief; !
while if they put questions designed to ;
bring discredit on the road and yet to 'â 
shield the Examiner, the belief would !
be fixed and final.. So they owe some- i
thing to themselves as "well as to the j
public.
Without doubt Mr. Huntington will i
relate how he cut the Examiner from '>
the pay roll after It had for a period ;
of twenty-two months received $1000
monthly for a silence, the value of j
which was evidently overestimated ;
He may explain the old running ac
count, which never came to a close,- 1
and make clear why his company has
had th pine un .er the disregard of Mr. '
Hearst. All of which, while tolerably i
well understood, will be interesting.
But there are ther things too import- j
ant and bearing too airectiy upon the I
situation to be overlooked. The Ex
aminer could interpose no objection, for
its howl to have the facts sot forth has
filled the land.
There is a story about a colt which
may be interjected at this point. Per
haps the Commissioners have heard it,
but it would enlarge their views if
they were to hear it again from a
source so high as Huntington. The
question is, who paid for the colt? Also
if the Southern Pacific can legitimate
ly go into livestock as a side issue, and
then claim that it makes no profit, and
so with clear conscience cinch the peo
ple. This colt was of the Electioner
line, high toned as to pedigree gener
ally, and the Examiner offered him as
a prize. He was selectedâ so runs the
taie â by a representative of that pa
per and the price of $2500 agreed upon
with Senator Stanford, this to be paid
in cash. The prize having been drawn
the holder of the ticket demanded his
colt. The Examiner sent to Palo Alto,
and Ariel Lathrop refused delivery of
the colt, wanting first to see the money.
An appeal was made to Senator Stan
ford, who instructed Lathrop to de
liver the colt. Lathrop again refused
unless the order from the paper bore
the name of W. R. Hearst, contending
the "The Examiner" constituted no sig
nature. Such an order was received,
and the colt went from Palo Alto.
Some days later Mr. Lathrop sent to
the Examiner a bill for $2500, but no
attention was paid to it. Then he
called at the office of that paper and
was presented with a bill of $5000 for
an old write-up of Vina ranch, a write,
up never authorized, ordered nor coun
tenanced. On the face of this bill was
a credit of $2500 for the colt, and a de
mand for the balance of $2500 was pre
sented. Mr. Lathrop was not pleased.
His anger was noticeable, and he with
drew to report to Senator Stanford.
The Senator viewed the affair as one
of the vicissitudes of capital and said
that, notwithstanding the injustice of
the Examiner's claim, he would have
to stand the loss. Thus â so runs the
story still, for it is rather longâ was
Senator Stanford's pastures looted of
one valuable colt. ' The Examinei
claim, being absolutely without merit,
hns never been pressed.
Now there are several points about
this colt case that come within pur
view of the commission. Senator Stan
ford's affairs were "so intimately mixed
with thf se of the Southern Pacific that
it is deemed probable that an examin
ation of the railroad's books would show
who stood the loss of that colt, and
why the $2500 for a worthless write-up
was neither paid nor payment of it
urged.
Once Creed Haymond, now gone to
his reward, made a speech before the
Senate Committee on Pacific Roads on
the equities which might be pleaded as
an offset to the claims of the Govern
ment. The commission must not forget
to ask whether the Examiner charged
and received $7000 for the publication.
There are allegations that this was its
price.
Here is another thing of more than

For Infants and Children.
passing concern and exactly in line
with the natural trend of inquiry: Dur
ing the first Cleveland administration
the Patterson Pacific Railroad Commis
sion visited this coast. On that occa
sion the Southern Pacific paid the Ex
aminer $5000 in coin not to attempt to
influence the commission. This amount
is said to have been increased as the
investigation went on. But these are
the rude outlines of the operation. The
commission has power to draw out
facts sufficient to elaborate it. There
is in San Quentin, in an official capac
ity, a man named Thorpe who could
give the Commissioners all the infor
mation necessary to promote a worthy
and effective pursuit of the truth.
The people have something at stake,
but the Commissioners have more.
Faith in their probity will rest upon
their course, and to spare any culprit
will be to injure their own good names.
TANSIE RED'S LETTER.
Charles Kitchen Caught While Try-
ing to Take It From the Post
office Registry Department.
Charles Kitchen, a habitue of the Bar
bary Coast, was arrested yesterday by
Postal Inspectors Munro and Erwin for
intercepting a letter belonging to Tansie
Red, a colored man residing- at 438 Broad
way. Red and the prisoner are friends,
and Kitchen became acquainted with the
fact that Red had a mothec residing in
Kansas City, Neb., who was sending him
small sums of money by registered letter.
Kitchen intercepted the letter carrier
near Red's house last Wednesday, and l>y
representing himself to be Red received
the official notice that a registered letter
was awaiting Red In the postofflce.
Washington street. The registry clerk
refused to give the letter to Kitchen be
cause Red had been there about a week
ago and the clerk remembered that he
was a colored man. Kitchen, however,
persisted that he was the right man, and
left an order that all letters for Red
should be sent to 957 Market street.
In the afternoon of the same day the
registered letter clerk sent a notice to 957
Market street to the effect that a letter
was awaitine for Red in the postoffice.
Yesterday morning Kitchen presented
himself at the office with the notice and
demanded the letter. He was at once
placed under arrest by the postal in
spectors, and being taken into their
office stoutly persisted in declaring that
his name was Tansie Red and that the
letter was from his mother Mary, in Kan
sas City. It happened that the lady's
name is Kate, not Mary, and that there is
no such street in Kansas City as the one
mentioned by Kitchen. Later in the day,
finding that the inspectors knew all about
him, he confessed his guilt.
The inspectors at once sent a notice to
Red that a valuable letter was in the
postoffice addressed to him, but he had
not made his appearance up to the close
of office hours.
CLAUS SPRECKELS
WILL RECOVER
Not So 111 as a Sensational
Report Said He
Was.
Confined to His Bed With, a Car
buncle, but Is Slowly
Convalescing.
A sensational article was published last
night in an evening: paper to the effect
that Claus Spreckels was on his death
bed, and that death was hourly expected.
Dr. L. C. Lane, who Is the physician of
Mr. Spreckels, made the following- state
ment last night in regard to his patient:
"Claus Spreckels was taken ill about
two weeks ago with a carbuncle on his
back. Its efTection had the ordinary
course, requiring incision, which was
done eight days ago. For a few days aft
erward the patient was seriously ill. His
condition at present is much improved,
and in all probability he will recover,
though at his time or life the disease is
of slow and painful progress and of a
tedious character. There is no doubt as
to his final recovery. His indomitable
will power has aided him much on this
as on previous occasions of his eventful
life."
The report of the physician was veri
fied by several of the members of his
family last night.
AT HIS OLD TRICKS.
Osmond E. Kelly Again Arrested
for Swindling Whole

Edward Kelly, who was arrested
Wednesday night on the charge of ob
taining six dozen airs of gloves from H.
Franklin, proprietor of a Pine street fac
torj't on false pretenses, will probably
have to answer to other charges.
He has been going to wholesale houses
! pretending that he represented a firm in
Oakland and obtaining goods from them.
I Yesterday he was identified as the man
who orCered $200 worth of cloth from the
California "Woolen Mills and was satisfied
to take away with him a bolt worth $20.
This is not the first time he has been
' arrested for the same offense. In the be
' ginning of last year he obtained articles
from about two dozen firms on various
pretexts. Complaints were made to po
, lice headquarters and he was arrested.
> He was sent to tho County Jail for six
months on two charges, but the sen
! tences ran concurrently. At that time he
I gave his true name, Osmond E. Roily.
After serving his sentence he went to
[ Colusa and worked the same gamp. He
was arrested and servofl a term in the
Jail there. A drummer for the Pine strort
glove factory recognized him as being- tho
S man who workrd Colusa, and that led to
j his present arrest.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 25.-The stock market
waa quite active and animated to-day, com
pared with the lethargy and sluggishness of
yesterday. The day's business was not by any I
means large, and there were prolonged periods '
of dullness between the spurts of activity.
There was no outside interest in the market
of any importance and the buying was due to
the initiative of one or two prominent oper
ators, who distributed orders with a liberal
hand all through, the active, list. - This leader
ship invited more or less following among the
Email room traders. The buying was â  based
upon the confident assumption that the ap
proaching naval engagement r off the Philip- '
pines would result In favor of the. .United â 
States forces. Hull operators expressed them- '
selves as confident that such a victory would
be '"good for a 5 point rise In the active
stocks." The slight decline at the opening !
due to the heaviness of the London market
and which did not at any time Call to the
l>ondon parity, were quickly overcome The
Granger* were conspicuous in the trading and
led the advance in the railroad list.
No doubt the distinctly easier tone In the
money market had something to do also With
the awakening of the speculative spirit. There
1b a feeling of confidence that the needs of '
the United States Treasury can be met without
Inconvenience to the money market Call
money was quite abundant to-day and loans
were made as low as v 2v 2 per cent. Shipments
of money continued to the Interior, but in i
small volume.
There was some Increase of activity In the
bond market, but It was confined almost en
tirely to the speculative issues, which showed
higher prices in sympathy with stocks. Total i
Bales, $I,OX>,QOO.
United States new 4s, registered, advanced I

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 2Sâ The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
market* here were steady to-day (except in
one spot noted later) on the Bank of Eng
land's return and the further inflow of gold.
The main feature was a further ris.> in Brazil
and Argentine stocks. Americans were
neglected here, but were supported at the close
by New York, apparently on the bombardment
incident. The Klondike group was especially
strong. Union Pacific preferred was bid for on
dividend rumors.
The further rise in silver and the increased
activity were due to America withholding sup
plif-s and the announcement of a French mint
age order for Â£60,000 to be tendered on Satur
day. Some persons say\ the order is really for
Spain.
In connection with the recent rise in Amer
ica in wheat, other grain and hemp, I learn
that those here concerned In the movement
are now insuring their profits at Lloyds.
The charge of wheat ranges from 6 to ten
guineas.
The Bank of Spain's return shows the effect
of the recent run by a decrease of Â£1."00 in thÂ»
silver reserve. The minimum local proportion
of the bullion to notes required by the Bank
"f Spain is 33 per cent. The present figure is
37 per cent.
Spanish exchange is selling at 45 pesetas to
the pound sterling, the lowest fin record.
The difficultly In the West Australian mar
kft are coming to a head. Two failures were
announced to-day. Thirty-two brokers ar<* In
volved and the debtor appears to have nothing
to offer. Heavy losses must fol.ow ar.<] per
haps a scandal, but this affair is not likely to
have a lasting effect.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 28.â Traders In wheat had
an exciting time during the first hour -to-day
on account of the violent advance at Liverpool,
but there was an evident indisposition on the
part of many to allow excitement abroad to
unhinge their own Judgment at home. A quite
general Impression prevailed among traders
that foreigners were becoming hysterical over
the supposition that Spain may Interfere with
the exjiort movement of American products.
But another portion of the trade interprets
the wild advance abroad to the sudden discov
ery by foreigners that there Is not enough
wheat and flour available anywhere to keep
them supplied until the next harvest. The rea
sonings of these two factions is what caused
the market to fluctuate violently until the
bears appeared to be on top. The advance of
B@loVic for July and May at Liverpool and
smaller rises at Paris and Antwerp were said
to be the result of American covering, but ex
porters sold several cargoes of northern at
s! 44 and private cablegrams said English mil
lers were â  bidding excitedly for wheat. â  July,
which started 2V''3'-Â«c higher at S7Vi<g9Se, de
clined rapidly to %<-, rallying Just as quickly
to- Si^c: This range was covered â¢â  several
times. When July was selling around 96c near
the close a private cablegram from Argentine
reported an Increase In the estimated wheat
yield of that country to 40,000,000. It caused
enough selllnc to break July to 9.">e, the low
point cf the day, but a quick rally to 95^4c fol
lowed. July closed at the last-named figure, a
net gain of %6%e. May sold between $1 2lff?
1 24, closing IV net higher at $1 22^.
. Corn started strong with Liverpool, which
closed. HiZd higher. . General realizing offset
the mass of bullish Influence, and after ad

AGRICULTURAL
EXPERTS NEEDED
More Room for Them
Than Lawyers and
Physicians.
Professor Hilgard of Berkeley
on Agricultural Edu
cation.
Deplores the "Snobbishness Which
Looks Down Upon the Farm
er's Pursuit."
BERKELEY, April 28. -Professor E. "W.
Hilgard. head of the agricultural depart
ment of the university, has made an in- |
teresting study of the problem why so
few college students are preparing them
selves for agricultural pursuits. His con
clusions are set forth in the recently pub
lished report of the department for the
past two years. He deplores the "snob
bishness" which looks down upon agricul
ture as a vocation of inferior degree, and
declares that it is only by elevating the
farmer's pursuit to a higher plane, bom
Intellectually and (by the aid of such as
sociations as the Grange and Farmers' j
clubs) socially, that this can be overcome.
Professor Hilgard's comments are in
part as follows:
It is truly remarkable that in republican
America prejudice should be allowed a foot
hold which even in monarchical Germany dare
not show its face. The strong and influential
representation of the agricultural element In
the German Reichstag stands in marked con
trast to the manner in which the farmers' In
terests are made to take a "back seat" In our
legislative assemblies; not so much because
uiMitrs are not there, but rather because for
lack of training they cannot make themselves
felt as against their well-equipped fellow-mem
bers of the politico-legal profession. It Is only
by correspondingly thorough training, connect
ed with their own pursuit, that this state of
things can be remedied.
We have been told that farmers do not send
their sons because they fear they will be "edu
iaie.l away trom the farm. ..lit .t- a :;: r
of fact a very large proportion of our univer
sity students are farmers' sons, as already
shown; and they are sent by their parents
to other departments, literary, scientific and
i th. r professional courses, giving their own
profession the go-by. It is the old story of
the tendency of the rural population toward the
cities, where more fun and (supposedly) less
work can be had than on the farm. That is
the problem all over the world, In Europe as
well as here.
too long as our soils continue to produce re
: munerative crops, or remain productive, with
: out imperative need of fertilization, rotation.
! etc., and new lands remain to be occupied, the
attendance at our colleges of farmers' sons
intending to return to the farm will be com
paratively slight; but as soon as the shoe be
gins to pinch, and intelligent and frugal hus
bandry becomes a necessity, our agricultural
colleges and schools will receive a corre
spondingly increased attendance. The begin
ning in such a movement is already seen in
I the attendance, as special students, of those
I often ot mature age, who intend to engage In
I agricultural branches requiring professional
Information, training for observation and edu
cated judgment. It Is the relatively slight de
i riarvi for agricultural experts in this country
j that keeps down the number of full-course
graduates to a few persons annually. Yet even
now in certain cases the demand exceeds the
supply, for the several agricultural experi
ment stations and colleges in the United States.
; as well as the Agricultural Department at
I Washington, are frequently unable to find the
right man for a place it is desired to fill.
There certainly Is much more room for agri
cultural experts at this time than there is for
more lawyers and physicians, for in the ab
sence of a sufficient number of trained ex
perts it has become necessary to fill many
! plaies with narrowly educated specialists, in
; stead of men with broad education.
j In California the fact that Investments in
i orchards and vineyards arc permanent for a
â  number <">f years and bring about a one-sided
â  wear of the soil makes it necessary to work
: on rational linos sooner than is mostly done
elsewhere. Horticulture requires In an ernt
â  nent degree the use of knowledge and brains
and it is from horticulturists that most of our
students now come. Besides, the large area of
', the State and its indefinitely varied climates
and soil call for the exercise of an unusual
degree of Judgment and brains, the more so as
In a large number of cases there is no prece
dent to go upon. It would therefore eeem
especially nepdful that our young men intend
ing to be farmers should be trained to use all
the resources that agricultural science places
at their command, to save themselves from
1 costly mistakes In their practice.
AN EXAMPLE BY BOYS.
A Church Brigade's Besolution to Be
Put Into Effect.
OAKLAND, April 2S.â The Boys' Brig
ade of the Eighth avenue M. E. Church,
which passed patriotic resolutions last
Saturday night, is intending, if possible,
to carry out in practice the spirit of its
resolve.
It would like to organize a corps and
offer it for service to Governor on
behalf of the State. The first to enlist is
Corporal Frank Bush, who some years
ago saw the national colors on Broadway
on a general holiday, and as there was an
advertisement on the flag he asserted
what he considered to be his authority
and cut the flag down.
This company enjoys the distinction of
being connected with the church which
fiies the stars and stripes from its high
est peak, and it believes that in this re
spect its church enjoys a unique distinc
tion in California. The commander of
the company, L. N. Cobbledick. who has
served many years in the National Guard
as an officer, is now considering the feasi
bility of organizing a company of his
former coys, who are now young men
and offering it to the President. '
Attached the Water Front Property.
OAKLAND April 25.-J. I. Armstrong
to-day caused writs of attachment to be
levied on the real estate held by the
Oakland Water Front Company to secure
the payment of a note of JSS7G. This was
made by S. G. Cook and Charles H
Maxey, on August 2.- 1595, to the Bank of
Minneapolis. This note was transferred
to O. A. Lane, of this city. In March
1896, with $250 paid on It. He In turn
passed It to >Armstrong, who now seeks
to recover the amount. Cook is a heavy
owner in the Water Front Company and
other realty in this city, where he for
merly resided. He is now in Minneapolis
where he owns one of the largest and
finest business blocks.
North Oakland Morning Blaze.
OAKLAND. April 2S.â A disastrous firo
occurred early this morning on Elizabeth
Etrret, at the intersection of San Pablo
avenue, North Oakland. Three cottages
burned to the ground despite the woTk of
the Fire Department. Over 2000 feet of
hose was used to get a stream of water
on the burning building. Mrs. J. Powers,
in whose home the fire originated, was
awakentd by her baby strangling with
the smoke. She grabbed the < hild and
made her way out of the burning build
ing to a neighbors, losing everything she
possessed. The other two houses were
empty. No cause is known for the fire.

OAKLAND. April 28.â The Sunset Tele

MAYOR PHELAN
MUST ELECT
Auditor Broderick Hasan
Awakening of His
Conscience.
He May Refuse to Approve Any
Warrants of Deputy County
Clerks.
Claims the Mayor Allowed Seven
Questionable Demands to Be
Paid Last Month.
Auditor Broderick's conscience has
been troubling him during the past
month. As the result of these moral
twitchings, all the warrants of the
County Clerk's deputies may be "held
up" until the decision of the Supreme
Court is rendered in the case brought
by the Mayor to enjoin the Auditor
from signing rr.ore than a certain num
ber of these demands.
According to Mayor Phelan's conten
tion the dct of April 2, 1880, under
which County Clerk Curry appointed
the eighty-four deputies now employed
in his office, is unconstitutional, and
under the pre-existing law the County
Cjerk could appoint only thirty-two
deputies.
In the suit brought by the Mayor he
asked to have the Auditor enjoined
from signing the demands of forty-five
deputies. This left thirty-nine to be
approved by the Auditor, and the
names of all these were selected by
the Mayor. In the Superior Court the
case was decided against the Mayor,
who took an appeal to the Supreme
Court.
Auditor Broderick duly approved the
thirty-nine demands last month, but
none of the others, as he intends to
await the decision of the Supreme
Court.
To-morrow there Will be presented to
him another batch of eighty-four de
mands for the County Clerk's deputies.
Thinking over the matter during the
past few days the Auditor thinks that
the Mayor was wrong in allowing
thirty-nine demands to be paid, when
the law, which his Honor claims is In
force, allows the County Clerk only
thirty-two deputies. For this reason
he has asked the Mayor to designate
the thirty-two demands that are to be
approved by the Auditor this month.
Up tn the present time the Mayor has
declined to draw his pencil through
seven of those he singled out for his
kind consideration last month.
Auditor Broderick stated yesterday
that unless the Mayor selected the
thirty-two who were to have their de
mands paid this month he might feel
compelled to withhold his approval
from all of the eighty-four. He added
that if he had his choice he would elect
to pay only the men who are married
and have families.
A conference is to be held to-morrow
between the Mayor, the County Clerk
and the Auditor to see if some satis
factory solution of the matter cannot
be secured.
County Clerk Curry stated yesterday
that it would make no difference with
the working 1 force in his office whether
they got their pay or not at this tim*.
At the time the question was first
brought up by the Mayor he informed
all his deputies that their salaries
might be withheld for some time and
possibly not paid at all, and said he
was ready to receive the resignations
of any who did not want to take
chances in the matter. No resigna
tions were tendered, and none are like
ly to be now, so the operation of thfi
courts will not be interfered with, even
if none of the demands are approved.

Company G Dissatisfied.
ALAMEDA, April 26.â The announce
ment of the probability that new officers
will be appointed by Governor Budd to
command the volunteers Is not relished I
by the majority of the members of Com- j
pany G in this city. The idea among j
thorn has been that the company would i
offer its services in a body, with the ex- '
pectation that they would preserve their
organisation as members of the National !
Guard, though going into the national
service, and would carry their officers
with them. The men have every- confi
dence in their present commanders and
do not relish any change, such as is pro
posed.
Other companies which have been
heard from are of the same opinion, and
it appears altogether likely that unless
some assurance is given that the present
officers will be retained there will be no
such wholesale volunteering as had been
expected by the men themselves.
In Windsor Castle there is a carpet 40

HARD-LUCK TRIP
OF THE URANUS
Short of Provisions, So the
Crew Had to Live
on Beans.
I
Captain M. P. Anderson Died
Almost in Sight of the
Golden Gate.
The Cook of the Bark Hesper Went
Crazy at Sea and Tried to
Commit Suicide.
Quite a fleet of vessels took advantage
of the fair wind that blew in from the
sea yesterday and made port without the
aid of the tugs. Among them was one
ship, two barks and a dozen schooners,
while the steamer Columbia arrived from
Portland and the Weeott from Eureka.
The latter was two days overdue, and
was towed in by the tug Sea King. Dur
ing the run down the coast her engines
broke down and she came the greater
part of the way under sail.
The schooner Enterprise came in from :
Grays Harbor with a load of lumber.
During the passage Captain Ingwerdsen !
broke a blood vessel and the crew j
thought he would die before the vessel
reached port. They signaled for a doc
tor as soon as the heads were reached,
and Dr. E. Hill of the Harbor Receiving
Hospital went out to the vessel. He
found the captain to be a very sick man,
but thinks that with care he will pull
through.
The bark Hesper came in from Caleta
Buena with a cargo of nitrate. On the
way up the coast S.- Anderson, the cook,
went crazy and jumped overboard. A
boat was lowered and he was rescued,
but as he again tried to take his own
life. Captain Sodergren put him in irons.
The Hesper brought up as passengers
A. E. Macandrew and H. James and wife.
Mr. Macandrew says that Caleta Buena
and Iquique are practically deserted. The
bottom has dropped out of the nitrate
market, and nearly all the factories are
closed down. In consequence there has
been an exodus of the inhabitants, near
ly all of whom started for the Klondike.
Mr. and Mrs. James are going to try their
fortune on the Yukon.
The schooner Uranus arrived from San
Benito, Mexico, after a hard round trip.
She left Fort- Bragg with a load of lum
ber over six months ago, but lost half
of it in the Gulf of California during a
very heavy storm. No return cargo could
be secured at San Benito, so she had to
return in ballast. Captain M. P. Ander
son had been sick throughout the entire
passage, and on the 22d inst. he died and
was buried at sea. Captain Glow brought
the vessel into port after a great deal of
trouble. The chronometer was all wrong,
and according to his reckonings the Uran
us should have been hard and fast on
the beach a week ago. Captain Anderson
wanted to live to reach port, and held out
to the last minute. But when the time
came that, according to calculations, the
schooner should be within sight of the
Goiden Gate and there was no land in
sight, he gave up hope and when his son
returned to the cabin to tell him once
more that there was nothing but water
to be seen he found him dead.
While the Uranus was lying at San
Penito George Lindner, an apprentice boy
on the German barkentine Elba, deserted
his ship and swam two miles to get
aboard the American schooner. He said
he was not half fed and wanted to get
to San Francisco, so he took his chances
with the sharks. As the Uranus was
ready to sail. Captain Anderson kept the
boy and brought him up on the schooner.
As far as the food was concerned, how
ever, in Lindner's case, it was out of the
frying pan into the fire. The stock of
Jlour on the Uranus was ruined on the
â voyage down, and the crew had to live
on beans during the trip up the coast.
There was no fear of starvation, but
everybody was longing for a change of
diet when the anchor was dropped.
If evei a man was thoroughly disliked
on the water front it is United States
Quarantaine Officer Rosenau. He is never
happy unless he is putting some unfor
tunate ship captain to some trouble, but
he is supremely happy when he can catch
a sailing vessel that has crossed the quar
antine line with a fair wind. Wednesday
last he caught the brigs Lurline and John
D. Spreckels, and was, in consequence, as
pleased as a pig with two tails. Captain
Christiansen, of the Spreckels, was bowl-
Ing along with a fine breeze and was fig
uring on making the sugar refinery on
one tack, when along came Dr. Rosenau
and made him 'bout shin and return to
the other side of the quarantine line.
The Lurline had to come to an anchor
in order to give the Federal officer a
chance to go through her papers. Yester
â¢Jay the Uranus came close to the quar
antine line, and Captain Clow had to furl
sail and drop anchor in a hurry in order
to fscape a fine. As it was he came
within an ace of running down the pilot
boat lionita. On the .British ship Port
Logan and American ship Eclipse the
captains had to order all the sails let go
and drop anchor in order to please Dr.
Rosenau. In consequence both vessels
broke their capstans and were otherwise
damaged.
Such incidents as these are of every
day occurrence, so it is no wonder the
shipping: men and ship masters dislike
Dr. Rosenau.
Th". steamer Humboldt sailed yesleiduy
on her last trip but one for Dvea and
Skagusy. On the completion of her â May-
Juno voyage she will be put 01. the St.
Michael run, and Chief Engineer J. Foard
is wi,:.ng to give odds that his vessel Will
bc-it the record of any steame- wit <n
the trade. The Humboldt is a fast, com
icrtal.le boat, but just how fa".-: she is
nobody knows, as she has never !<â¢ -n
npi pried. Last season she made the ro m.l
trip from Seattle to St. Michael and back
In twenty-five days. That time included
a delay of several days at St. Michael,
caused by poor lightering, and two days
at Dutch Harbor to coal. That was the
Foard says her vessel can better her own
Foord says her vessel can better her own
time.
Uncle Sam has only to go as far as
the Merchants' Exchange when in want
of three stalwart recruits who know more I
or less about almost every ship afloat.
The young men are J. Daley, Abe Marks
and W. B. Downs, and they are ready to
go to sea on any of the warships, when
called upon. There are none more popu
lar in shipping circles than "Jerry, Abe
nni Billy," and should the call of duty
take them to the front they would be sad
ly missed by the hundreds who shower
questions at them daily "on 'Change."
THE JAPS MAY LAND.
Inspector Lynch's Appeal Has Been
Overruled by the National Im
migration Commisioner.
T'nited States Immigration Commis
sioner North received yesterday a tele- <
gram from the Commissioner of Immi
gration at Washington announcing that
the protest of John Lynch had been over
ruled and that the forty-eight Japanese
In dispute, who arrived by the China, the j
Doric and the Belgic, should be allowed |
to land. The snecial board of inquiry, of i
which Mr. Lynch, Chinese Inspector, Is <
one, decided that the Japs were entitled
to land, but Mr. Lynch refused to sign
the report and made his minority report
in the shape- of an appeal to the National |
Commissioner.
Commission. -r North said yesterday
that if It shall be. found that the landed
Japs are contract laborers they will be
arrested and deported, the action of the
special board of inquiry in allowing them !
to land not being final, but qualified and
revocable upon evidence of fraud.

WHAT CAUSED
HIS DEATH?
Mystery in the Demise of
an Employe of the
Racetrack.
Henry Wright Died Twenty-
One Days After Being
Beaten.
Dr. Clark of ths Infirmary Is Sure
Death Wei the Result of
Consumption.
Henry Wright, a colored boy, who was
employed at the racetrack exercising
horses, died Wednesday at the Alameda
County Infirmary, and there is a sus
picion that his death is not fully account
ed for by the doctor's certificate, which
gives consumption as the cause.
Last Tuesday "Tip" O'Neill, the base-
I ball player, who is a deputy sheriff at
I the racetrack, brought young Wright to
i the Receiving Hospital In a buggy. He
turned him over to the care of Steward
Tobin, and stated that Wright had been
in a scrap at the track and had received j
a beating. O'Neill also stated that the j
colored boy had been kicked. Tobin put j
the boy to bed and from him obtained the
same story. Wright was so sore on hia
right side that he could not lie upon it.
"While he was at the hospital," said
Steward Tobin this afternoon, "he was I
not attended by a doctor, as there was i
nothing serious about his sickness, and
I understood that he was merely to be
here until Supervisor Church could be
asked for a permit to admit the boy to
the county infirmary. I did not examine
him, but the boy said he had got into |
a row and that some one had kicked him \
in the right side. Some time later a j
permit was issued, I believe, at the re- i
quest of "Tip" O'Neill, and Wright was
taken to the infirmary. 1 have since
learned that be died there yesterday.
Yesterday morning Charles Boots, the
well-known horse owner and racing man,
reported to Jailer Lane at the County Jail
that Wright was dead, and that he had
heard that his death was due partly, if
not wholly, to being beaten at the race
track during a row. Mr. Boots said he
had no positive knowledge of, the fact,
but he reported it as he considered it ;
worthy of being investigated. Jailer Lane
: communicated the facts to Coroner Bald-
"As soon as I heard of the matter," said
the Coroner, "I at once questioned Dr. j
(."'ark, the resident physician of the in- ,
tirmary, who had signed the death cer
tificate. Dr. Clark told me that he had '
not found any bruises on the hoy, neitner
had Wright made any complaint of ill- i
treatment. The doctor assured me that
as soon as Wright was received at the in- '
firmary a careful diagnosis of his lungs
was made, which resulted in proving that
he was suffering from acute consumption,
and that there was nothing to indicate
any other cause for death. As Dr. Clark
is a very conscientious physician I con
sidered that there was no need to con
tinue my investigation."
Dr. Clark was asked yesterday after
noon regarding any proof of injury, and
said that although Wright was conscious
right up to the time of his death he did
nut make any reference to any 111-treat
ment. "In examining his lungs." sai.i i >r.
Clark, "It was necessary to strip him be
low his ribs, and I should think if he
were suffering he WOUW have let me
know. It baa been reported to me that
one of his jaws was broken, but such a
statement is false."
Young Wright was burled yesterday
afternoon from the undertaking parlors
of McManus & Co. As he lay in the
casket he presented a very healthy ap
pearance, and the manager said that he
certainly did not look like a consumptive
patient, although there was not a bruijfc
on Ins body or anything to indicate that
he had not died as the doctor recorded.
The f.xptnses of the funeral were paid
by the boys at the track, as Wright 's
not known to have any friends or rela
tives in this vicinity. The boy was about
23 years of age, and had been around*
racetracks for a few years.
ALLITERATIVE
SUPERSTITION
Robert Mantell's Agent Points
Out a Few Curious Facts
About Names.
A Sure and Splendid Success Seeks
a Succession of Syllabio
Sounds.
H. A. d'Arcy. who is in the city In the
interest of Robert Mantell, is a poet-play
wright and propounder of ideas. He has
invented a new superstition which, if un
reasonable, is at least an interesting
study. He argues that alliteration in
names is lucky and offers examples in
stage life to bear out his theory. He says:
it is quite a number of years ago when
I first noticed the large percentage of
theatrical names, the initials of which
correspond. It occurred to me that most
of these names were assumed ones and
adopted in the interest of euphony, but I
found this was not so; i.ien I discovered
beyond doubt that alliteration was a
lu<l<y quantity.
â¢â¢When Mantoll plays 'Romeo,' hisjuliet
in the balcony scene voices one of
Shakespeare's most famous axioms. Miss
Capulet is awfully 'gone' on young Mon
tague, and, bemoaning the fact that his
name is objectionable to her family, says
'that a rose by any other name would
Hinoll as sweet.' The young lady may be
correct, but she has no more proof to
)>;ick up her asertion tnan I have to the
contrary. It hold that if the rose had
Ik en named 'cactus' it would not have
been the ideal flower we know. There is
much in names, or why do poets and
novelists christen their virtuous maidens
Martha, Florence, Gladys or Madeleine,
while they invariably < all their adven
turesses Cora. Lina, Xana, Lena or some
such name with four letters and ending
with 'a?' But 1 am only discussing one
example in the value of names, which, as
before stated, is alliteration.
"Couple two or more names commencing
with the same letter, and, as sure as you
do so. it will influence good fortune. I
would need a column of this paper to
give the examples of which I know. I
will start with a few and give the reader
jx. chance to continue the list.
"Some unlucky women of the stage: EfÃe
Ellsler. Charlotte Crabtree, Charlotte
Cuahman, Charlotte Crampton, Maggie
Mitchell, Maggie loore, Amy Ames,
Flora Finlayson, Lillian Lamson. Grace
Golden, Daisy Dixon, Billie Barlow, Min
nie Maddern, Marion Manola Mason,
Katherine Kidder, Millie Miska, Bessie
Bonehill, Lillie Langtry, Emma Eames,
Marguerite Mather.
"Some lucky men are: Collie Cibber,
Joseph Jefferson, Walker Whlteside,
Dore Davidson, Frank Frayne, Harry
Harris, Melbourne Macdowe.., Harry
Hawk. Edward Eddie. Charles Coote,
Roland Reed and hundreds of others.
"It may occur to the reader that being
a theatrical man I am taking all the
value of this charm to my own profes
sion. Not at all. It may be traced in the
history of the world. Was it fate or de
sign that Mahomet was born in Mecca
mid buried in Medina, or that Wellesley,
Lord Wellington, won Waterloo, that
famous battle fought on Friday, that
unlucky day for all fatalists? Had Blu
chcr been arrayed on the side of Bona
parte the issue would surely have been
reversed. When a man ta*es up arms
against a government, if he fails he is
a rebel; if successful he is a patriot. No
man ever took so great a risk with re
sults on his side as General Giuseppi
Garibaldi. Fateful Friday was again ar
rayed against the charm of alliteration
when Christopher Columbus discovered
this country
THE SA:N T FRANCISCO 1 CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 29, 189 S.
IN THE REAL
ESTATE WORLD
The Crippled State of the
Market and Its
Cause.
Interior and City Building
Development Is at a
Standstill.
A Glance at the Records, Sales
and General Really
Notes.
The war with Spain, coupled with the
naturally quiet state of the real estate
market. Is still acting as a check upon
the progression of real estate generally
throughout the city, and, in fact, the
entire State. A big sale is a rarity and
is seldom negotiated, while minor sales
are likewise slow and very far between.
j Property is hanging like a burden on
owners dcrirous of disposing of it, as '
; nothing bordering on its real value can !
I be realized, and consequently must be j
held or sold at a loss, as the market is j
practically dead. The building in the
city is slow and in the country worse.
J During the past week, however, things
| brightened a little and real estate
| agents reported, a slight development in |
i residence and development property, ;
but the general business done was no '
j better than the preceding week, and
i was so slight as to not make â¢ ay per- ;
! ceptible change in the general state of !
1 hiTi'i irs
The market in the country is little
better than here. The drought has
! played unusual havoc with the crops
i and the outlook for farmers in real
izing a successful year Is dubious and;
almost beyond hope, which means a de- ;
! terioratlon in real estate, as it will be
' impossible for them to pay their in
; debtedness. The loss includes for the
i most part the grain and fruit crops.
! Large areas of land as a result o-f the
arid condition of the ground are being
let to cattle-dealers and sheep-herders,
as it cannot be utilized to better ad- j
! vantage.
The building in this city during the
past week amounted to $193,382 in
transactions, against $79,027 the preced
ing week, and is reckoned in view of .
the stagnant condition of affairs as
phenomenal.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
During the week there were eighty-six
mortgages and trust deeds recorded,
: amounting to $270,480. For the same pe
riod fifty-two releases and reconveyances
passed to record in the total sum of $149.

SPANISH AGENTS
MAY LIE DEAD
AT SANTA CRUZ
Federal Secret Service Agents Are
Working for a Clew to the Pow
der Mill Disaster.
Carpenter Nelson and Others Saw Strangers
on the Ground Just Before the
Explosion.
Two, and probably three, bodies
have been found at the Santa Cruz
powder magazines of the California
Powder Works which cannot be ac
counted for. This strengthens the
theory that the explosion was the re
sult of design.
Secret service agents of the Gov
ernment are working on the case on
the theory that the disaster was
caused by the agents of Spain. Sev
eral workmen, especially Carpenter
Nelson, who was severely wounded,
saw strangers at and near the works
a few minutes before the disaster.
It is believed that, if the explosion
â¢was the result of design, the detona
tion was caused by the firing of re
volvers whose bullets reached the gun
cotton warehouse. Those who fired
probably thought they were far
enough away to escape unharmed, but
the explosion was not downward and
upward, as they doubtless calculated
it would be, but in all directions, and
the criminals died with those whose
lives they destroyed. Details of the
theory follow:
There are several circumstances that
tend to confirm the theory that the Cal
ifornia Powder Works' explosion was
the result of treachery- Suspicion
points strongly to the fact that Span
ish agents may have caused the trag
edy that costi many lives and a fright
ful loss of property.
Two more bodies than the ten known
to be missing have been found, also the
fragments of another body, which may
make thirteen killed and but ten known
to the people of Santa Cruz and vicin
ity. It is becoming an interesting ques
tion who the missing are.
The Government has taken a hand in
the investigations concerning this ex
plosion, and the wires were freely used
by secret service agents all day yes
terday with a view of losing no time
to locate the principal who sent the
agents to do the awful work.
The second unrecognizable body waa
discovered at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning, charred beyond recognition,
even if any o-.,e in the vicinity ever
knew the corpse in life. The discovery
of this body was made by Charles Cratr
hlll, a workman at the ruins. Bodies
supposed to be those of the ten men
known to 1>? missing, whose friends
mourn them as dead, had already been
found and taken to the undertaking es
tablishment of Wessendorf & Stafflers.
To add to the mystery of th- explo
sion and to confirm the suspicions of
those in authority at the works, as wÂ»ll
as those of Government officers, a third
body with none to claim it as friend
was discovered about tl o'clock lam
night. Rather, it was not a complete

"X.id" Johnson Brought
Them Forth With
a Punch.
They Fought Before the Berk
eley Beacon Athletic Club
Last Evening.
The Winner Proved Himself to Be a
Hard Worker and Willing to
Go the Distance.
"Kid" Johnson, who Is employed by the
Keystone Boiler Works, IS without doubt
a coming "slogger," and from all ap
pearances an explosion of a holler took
place last evening at the Beacon Ath
letic Club in West Berkeley when Jim
Lawrence of Seattle stopped a left
hander with the pit of his stomach and
went to the floor in an exceedingly dis
tressed condition. For weeks past a fight
has been on the tapis and George Baker
was matched to fight Johnson. However,
Baker was not in evidence and Lawrence
took his place, much to hia regret, for
besides receiving the "810111 winder" in
tho abdominal region ho broke a small
bone in bia right hand when he fell to the
floor and was counted out.

ing. These ghastly relics were found j
amid the ruined machinery, and It is ;
now believed that there were three !
strange men, if not more, lost in the j
explosion that cost ten faithful em
ployes their lives.
A circumstance that lends color to i
the suspicions of foul play is that seve
ral of the workmen noticed strangers ;
in the vicinity of the powder works
some time before the explosion. All
employes were very busy at the time I
and, therefore, none of them paid very
close attention to the strangers, but
there is not any doubt in the minds of
several of the workmen that the men
they saw in th<- vicinity of the works
a few minutes before the disaster were j
strangers and that they had no busi- '
ness in that part of the country.
Jenks F. Nesmith, secretary of the
company, was visited yesterday by a
carpenter named Nelson, one of the |
men who escaped from the terrible ex- j
plosion with his life, though bearing a
number of wounds. Nelson is one of i
the men who saw a stranger about the
works a little while before the explo-
Bion. Speaking of the circumstance, j
Nelson said:
"I was very busy at the time, but I
distinctly remember that I saw two
men near the works a little while be
fore the explosion. I was thrown over
an eight-foot pile of wood and I es
caped in a miraculous manner with my
life. I am still suffering from the
shock, but I have a plain recollection
of seeing two strangers. They may
have been there for the purpose of
blowing up the works or they may
have been there Innocently."
Secretary Xesmith says there Is no
doubt in the minds of the company that
the explosion took place first at the gun
cotton warehouse, and this lends color
to the suspicion that some one did the
job from evil motives and that it was
not an accident.
"If the gun cotton had been set fire
to," said the secretary, "it would have
burned without harm, while the slight
est detonation would have exploded it.
A man might have gone to one side of
the place where the gun cotton was
stored and watched his chance to fire
a revolver or rifle shot into the works.
This would have been sufficient to
cause all the damage. If any one had
done this for the purpose of maliciously
wrecking the works he might have
thought that he would escape by going
to one side and firing from a distance,
believing that the danger of the ex
plosion would be upward and down
ward; but this explosion extended in
all directions, and- the person or per
sons who made such a calculation, if
they did make it, were probably killed
also, and this would account for the
extra bodies found."
Three-fourths of the machinery used
for the manufacture >>f government
powder was not harmed at all. It is
now thought that the works will again
be running full time on government
work within less than thirty days.

match is not again consummated.

To-morrow night there will be sounds
of revelry in the old Mechanics' Pavilion,

over the rich costumes of knight and

tation of the Golden Gate Association to
time the flying hours by the rhythmic

in the mazy pleasures of the dance.
It Is expected to be one of the most
magnificent masqueraders that have ever
taken place in the famous olu structure
but it will differ from many of the others'
inasmuch as it will be perfectly respect
able, as is guaranteed by the standing of
the gentlemen who have the affair in
charge.
There will be twenty-two rich prizes
all of jewelry, the cost of which amounts
to $1200 in the aggregate. The first ladies'
prize will be a handsome marquise ring
; and the corresponding prize for gentle
; men will consist of a handsome split
, second gold watch. All the other prizes
will be of proportionate elegance
; Decorator Tobin of Native Sons fame
has charge of the adornment, and it goes
without saying that the result of his la

and remember. Two bands will be in at

NO REFUSAL
TO PAY THE
WIDBER BOND
Mayor Phelan Worked Himself
Into a Frenzy Over the Matter
Without Cause.
Action Taken at the Special Meeting of the
Board of Supervisors Called by His
Honor Yesterday.
While Mayor Phelan has churned j
himself and those in his immediate at
mosphere into a high state of fear and
Indignation over the supposed refusal j
of the Fidelity and Deposit Company i
to pay the $100,000 bond of A. C. Wid- !
ber, the defaulting Treasurer, the sure
ty company has, in reality, not re- j
fused to meet its obligation. As a
matter of fact, no formal demand has
been made to the proper person for the
payment of the bond.
So far has the Mayor's apprehension
that he might be called upon to meet
part of the defalcation carried him,
that he has made broad threats against
the surety company to the effect that
he would not approve any more of its
bonds. It is reported that he even
thought of asking the Supervisors to
pass a resolution declaring void all the
bonds of this company, given as surety
for city and county officials and em
ployes. In line with his apprehensions
and misconceptions, he called a special
meeting of the Supervisors, which was
held yesterday, for the purpose of tak
ing action to compel the payment of
the bond.
All this was Irrelevant, Immaterial,
Incompetent and unnecessary, Judging
WIDBER'S BOND.
The Document That Is Now a Check in Favor of the
Citu for $100,000.
Whereas, Augustus C. "Wldber, at the general election held on the 3d
day of November, 18%, was elected to the office of City and County Treas
urer In and for the city and county of San Francisco, State of California;
and whereas, the said Augustus C Widber is required by law to file an
official bond previous to entering upon the duties of said office; and where
as, the amount of such bond has been fixed at one hundred thousand (SIOO,
000) dollars.
Now, therefore, know all men by these presents, that we, Augustus
C. Widber of the city and county of San Francisco as principal and Fidel
ity and Deposit Company of Maryland as sureties, are jointly and sev
erally bound and indebted unto the State of California in the sum of one
hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars lawful money of the United States of
America, for the payment of which several sums of money, well and
truly to be made, the parties jointly and severally Indebted herein as
aforesaid, jointly and severally bind themselves, their heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assignees, firmly by these presents, sealed
with our seals, and dated this 19th day of December, in the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six.
The condition of the obligation is such that if the above bounden Au
gustus C. Widber shall well, truthfully, perform and execute the duties
of San Francisco, as required by law. as well as those which may be re
quired of him by any law now existing, as those which may be required
by any law enacted subsequently to the execution of this bond, then this
obligation to be void, otherwise to be and remain In full force and effect.

from the statement made yesterday to
a Call representative by Frank L*. Gil
bert, local agent of the surety company.
He declared his company stood ready
to pay the bond, but first wished to
ascertain what could be realized from
the property of Widber. It would
then pay the deficiency. He stated that
no demand had been made upon the
company, and that consequently there
could have been no refusal to pay.
When the Mayor called the meeting: |
of the Supervisors to order there were ,
present Supervisors Devany, Delany, \
Dodge, Morton, Britt, Smith, Clinton j
j and Rivers. The surety company was j
j represented by Mr. Gilbert, who was
accompanied by his attorney.
Mayor Phelan laid the object of the
meeting before the board in the fol
lowing statement, which he read:
SAX FRAN T CISCO, April 28, 1898.
To the Honorable, tho Board of Super- â¢
visors -of the City and County of San !
Francisco â Gentlemen: I desire to inform
you that the Treasurer of the City and |
County of San Francisco is a defaulter in
the sum of $117,083 79. and that he has
confessed to the defalcation and has boon
indicted' by the Grand Jury for the crime.
His fidelity was Insured by the Fidelity
and Deposit Company of Maryland in tho
sum of $100,000, as required by law, and
in said bond, prepared by the City and
County Attorney and approved by Mayor j
Sutro, Auditor Broderick and a Judge of
I the Superior Court, there are no condl
! tions under which the right of the city
1 to demand payment on the failure of the
! Treasurer to perform his official duties
; faithfully can be questioned.
On Tuesday, April 26, I and the City
', and County Attorney, called upon the
president of said corporation with a view I
of arranging for the collection of the I
! amount of said bond. I made a verbal
! demand upon the president for the pay
1 tnent of the whole amount of the bond,
. and was informed by him that a formal
written demand could be made upon the
authorized representative of the company
! in this city, and that he had eommunl- j
: rated the decision of his company to the j
Hoard of Supervisors, which Is self-ex- j
planatory and which, has been received j
: and will "he laid before you at this meet- <
! ing. which 1 have called for this pur
pose.
The urgency of this meeting arises from
; the fact that the fiscal year is drawing
i to a close, and the public business re
! quires tho funds that should be available
j in the city treasury, and which by rea
! son of this defalcation have been seri
ously depleted. 1 trust the Board of
Supervisors will. In their wisdom, see fit
to authorize the bringing of a suit In the
name of the city and county against the
: Treasurer and his bondsmen.
With respect to the counting of money
'< by the Mayor, the Auditor and a Judge
{of the Superior Court, to which the
I Surety Company makes reference, I de
' sire to Inform the board that the said
! officers have done their duty and that
by reason of their count on the 2Gth of j
, last March of the moneys in the treas
ury the defalcation of the Treasurer was
discovered. Were it not for this fact,
tho length to which the Treasurer might â¢
have gone in depleting the treasury can- j
, not be estimated. The method by which j
the commission proceeds is to enter the !
great vault, open the interior safes, and
to see and count over all the money con
tained therein. Two-thirds of the con- j
touts of the vault ordinarily is contained
in open trays and exposed, and the other j
third Is contained In sacks, for the most |
part under seal of the mint of the United
States. These sacks are removed from
tho Interior safes, some of them welshed
\ and others opened and counted, and the
| seals of all carefully examined.
On the occasion of tne last count,
I when the discovery was made. It ap
! peared to the commission that these seals
I were all intact. In passing back one of I
! the sacks, which the commission had I
j tnken from the safe, Chief Deputy De la I
I Montanya testifies that he heard a bus- |
piclous Jingle of silver in one of the sacks
supposed to contain gold. This was the
discovery of the fraud.
Instead of reporting immediately to
the commissioners he reported to the
Treasurer, and not until ten days after
ward was this shortage made good, nor
for twenty-five days afterward were the
commissioners informed of the defalca
tion.
In the meantime the Treasurer knew
that he was under suspicion, at least by
one or two of his own deputies, and that
exposure was imminent, and during that
time it is safe to infer from the facrts
that he abstracted a large part of the
money. On the 25th of March, for in
stance,we counted $25,000 in the box of the
Public Administrator, and that has been
stolen. The accentance of mint seals
after carefully examining them is in uni
versal vogue among banking and com
mercial institutions. The Mayor and the
Auditor have personally participated in
every count in the city treasury, and the
following Superior Judges have from
time to time acted: Judges Bahrs, Heb
bard, Dunne. Belcher, Slack, Cook, Dain
gerfield and Troutt.
Respectfully submitted,
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
Supervisor Britt moved that the com
munication be referred to the Finance
Committee. It was so ordered.
Communications were read from the
Fidelity and Deposit Company of
Maryland, in which the company asks
that the Board of Supervisors author
ize proceedings against A. C. Widher
and also against the Mayor, Auditor
and others responsible for the count of
the moneys In the custody of the Treas
urer, to recover the amount of Wid
ber's defalcation. Their demand against
the counting board is based on the al
leged careless manner in which the
money was counted by the Mayor.
Britt moved that all the communica
tions, of which there were three, be re
ferred to the Finance Committee, and
this was so ordered. He then offered
the following resolution:
Whereas, on the 21st day of December,
18%, Augustus C. Widber, late Treasurer
of the City ami County of San Frnnclsco,
gave his official bond in the penal sum
of one hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars
for the faithful performance of the duties
of his office for the term of two yeaJb,
commencing on the first Monday of Janu
ary, A. D. 1897, with the Fidelity and De
posit Company of Maryland, a corpora
tion, as the sole surety thereon; and
whereas, said Augustus C. Widber re
signed his said office of Treasurer on the
22d day of April, 1898, and was on that
day a defaulter in the sum of $116,715 34,
or thereabouts, money received by him in
his official capacity as such Treasurer,
and for which the surety on his official
bond is responsible, no part of which
since has been repaid; now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the City and County
Attorney be and he is hereby requested
to report In writing to this board, at its
next meeting, what steps should be taken
by the board to recover from the said
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Mary
land, a corporation, the amount for which
it is liable upon said official bond, and to
furnish with said report such resolutions
a* In hlB judgment should be adopted by
the board to accomplish said recovery.
This was adopted and the board ad
journed until Monday at 2 p. m.
After the board adjourned Mr. Gil
bert made the following statement, de
fining the position of his company in
the matter:
"All that we desire to say Is, that
no formal demand has been made upon
us for this money, and we have not re
fused to pay the bond. We simply
take notice of the fact that a defalca
tion has been made and ask the city
to collect what it can on account of
the defalcation, credit the defalcation
with that amount, and then let us
know the balance, which we agree to
pay.
"It is like any other case of insur
ance. If a man's house is partly de
stroyed by fire, there Is a certain sal
vage which can be realized upon, and
which will go against the insurance.
When the salvage is ascertained the in
surance company pays the balance, and
that is exactly what this company will
do in this case.
"If there is any question about the
responsibility of the company, it will
deposit in a special deposit the full
amount of this bond to await the deÂ»
termination of the amount of the sal-
vage.
"If it were perfectly platn that this
whole defalcation had occurred since
the last examination of the money, and
that Widber had no property whatso
ever, the city would have a check with
out any delay, and the only delay which
we now have is occasioned by the fact
that we desire to have the "benefit of
what' salvage there may be."
Both the city authorities and the
surety company are making vigorous
efforts to discover the whereabouts of
some of the missing money. It is be
lieved that some of it may be traced
and recovered from the persons who re
lieved Widber of it.

On the Prison Register Appears the

Citizens of San Francisco will long
remember Wednesday, April 20, A. D.
1898. Several events occurred that day
to make it memorable in the annals of
the city by the Golden Gate. There
was the departure of the First Infan
try for the seat of war, thrilling spec
tacle of Chief Lees at the head of a
battalion of police, and the announce
ment that Treasurer Widber had
"blown in" a hundred and odd thousand
dollars of the city's cash in a vain at
tempt to cultivate a wine appetite and
a string of horses that could run.
What man, woman or child who stood
on Van Ness avenue or Market street
that day but feels a thrill even now
at the recollection. Riding at the head
of the police escort, and the lirst fig
ure to greet the expectant eye, came
the Chief. (It may be noticed that he
Is not charged with commanding the i
battalion; Lieutenant Birdsall per
formed that duty, and most credita
bly.) Mounted on a magnificent
charger he was an inspiring sight, al
beit he may at times have ridden a trifle \
lopsided, due to a tender toward for
the ingrowing saddle. Th.- western
sun glinting on his gold laced uniform ;
made the Chief a thing of striking
beauty and reminded the beholders of
a Chinese joss. The reason Chief Lees
doesn't put more gold braid on that un
iform is because there is no room for
it. This is a source of considerable
worry to him and at present he is con
sidering two plans by which the diffi
culty may be obviated. One is to have
a larger coat built, and the other is to
decorate his boots. There are draw
backs to both; a larger coat would give
him the appearance of a junkshop,
while he would have to discard stir
rups if the footgear were to be seen,
and that would be uncomfortable, to
say the least.
It was close on to 4:30 o'clock
and already the* news of Widber's de
falcation had become public. Even the
throngs that watched the procession
had paused in their cheering long
enough to discuss the startling intelli
gence, but the Chief rode in blissful
ignorance.
It was at the foot of Market street,
just as the police battalion had drawn
up in line, that the Chief heard the
news. One of his trusted men in the
"upper office" broke through the line
and whispered the information to his
superior. Instantly the veteran'" en- j
tire manner changed. An expression of
relief overspread his features, and low
ering himself away from the deck of
his charger with a rrateful sigh, he
threw himself Into a convenient buggy
(there was no hack near) and dashed
off to the City Hall to obtain the de
tails and set the ponderous machinery
of his department in motion to effect
the capture of the lefaulter.
Not much detective work was neces
sary, which was bad, for the case did
not promise to add greatly to the
Chief's luster as the capturer of crim
inals. All he was called on to do was
to ascertain the place of Widber's con
cealment, and that was easy. From j
Chief Deputy de la Montanya Lees '
learned that Harry Morse, his old rival,
and a man of ability, was already at
work, and so all that was necessary
was to discover the direction Morse's
men were heading. It was goon found
that Captain Callundan had telegraph
ed to Constable Palmer of Walnut
Creek asking him to find out if Widber
was at his ranch. Receiving an affirm
ative reply, Callundan started on the
4 o'clock train (half an hour before
Lees heard of the defalcation) to arrest
the culprit, first wiring Palmer to take
good care that W T idber did not get
away.
When his sleuths had brought in all i
this information, Chief Lees detailed
Detectives Wren and Cody to make the
capture. Callundan arrived at Wid
ber's ranch about fifteen minutes after
Palmer had placed the Treasurer un
der arrest and the two started for Wal
nut Creek with their prisoner. On the
way they encountered Wren and Cody,
who were then going out to make the
arrest, and the latter, upon learning
that their man was already In the toils.
Joined Callundan and Palmer and re
turned with them to the city. At the
ferry the party was met by Chief Lees,
who took Widber and his own officers
In a carriage and drove them to the
City Hall.
After being conducted to the office '
of Chief Lees, where he confused his
guilt to Mayor Phelan, Auditor Brod
erick, and half a dozen others, Widber
was locked up in mysterious room 6,
across the hall from Lees' office, a de
toctive or two being placed In the room
with him to see that he held no commu
nication with outsiders. Why this was
done. Instead of placing Widber in a !
cell in the prison, as any other pris
oner would have been Lees alone can
explain. Widber had confessed, there
was nothing more the police could
learn from him, but the Chief saw fit
to hold him in eommunieado for the
time being, and the Chiefs v. ill is lawâ
or even mightier than the law some
times.
Later in the day Lees. Phelan and
Broderick filed information against
Wibder with the Grand Jury, and the
latter's indictment quickly followed.
Then Lees summo-ned Detective Wren
and Man Friday Coin'- and the three
conducted Widber to the City Prison,
where he was formally booked on a
charge of felony embezzlement. When
the desk sergeant asked for the names
of the arresting officers the Nero of the
Police Department promptly replied:
"Chief Lees and Detective Wren."
Poor Codv was turned down, while his
fovored comrade shared with the Chief
the glory of a capture with which they
had nothing whatever to do.
But of such is built the record of tho
Chief as a thief-taker. After a time,
when all others have forgotten the
story of the marching troops, the daz
zling chief and the flight and capture
of the defaulting Treasurer, Lees will
make casual mention of "How. I
pinched Widber," and bis hearers will
bare their heads and call him great

Captain Robinson of the City Prison
has resigned. This fact was made known
last night by Chief Lees after due medi

for the reporters and handed them the
resignation of Robinson. It read as fol
lows:
CHICAGO, April 15, 1898.
To the Honorable Board of Police Commis
sioners â Gentlemen: I tender you my resigna
tion as Captain of Police of the City and
County of San Francisco, and request that it
go into effect on May 1, IS9S.
HENRY ROBINSON, Captain of Police.
When questioned about the resignation
the Chief said it had been received by
Judge Tobin several days ago, but as he
is confined to his bed by a severe attack
of la grippe he did not open it until yes
terday afternoon.
He at once sent for Commissioner Al
vord, who, after reading it, turned it

ment.
"It Is not true that I was aware that
Robinson intended to resign when he way
granted a -leave of absence," vehemently
remarked the astute Chief. "I knew noth
ing of His intention except that he was
anxious to go east to settle up h:s father's
estate. His father was a very rich man,
and 1 naturally supposed that he left
Captain Robinson a large portion of his
estate. He, however, told me that he in
tended to return to this city as soon as
he succeeded in settling up the estate.
"Now about my nephew. Sergeant
Wolf. He was promoted to the position of
sergeant by Judge Tobin, who realized
his fitness for the place. Four months
before Captain Robinson was granted a
leave of absence Sergeant Wolf was as
signed to duty at the City Prison by
order of the President of the Board of
Police Commissioners.
"After Robinson left the city the Com
missioners decided to allow Wolf to act
as captain of the prison during the ab
sence of 'Handsome \yillie," as he is
familiarly known to his subordinates. I
never intended to use my pull with Com
missioners Alvord or Tobin to promota
Wolf to the responsible position of cap
tain of the prison."
Notwithstanding the Chief's denial it is
known that Judge Tobin, when it became
whispered that Robinson would not re
turn, wrote the head of the department
that under no consideration would he
submit to Wolf being appointed in Rob-
Inson's^ place. He referred to the fact
tnat Wolf had been nlaced in char*/ of
the prison without his consent and warn
ea the (. hief against trying to promote
his relativ.- over the several men who
were manifestly more capable of filling
the position.
*t ls expected that the vacancy will be
Vi jat thl meeting of the board on
Monday ni^ht. There are a number of
candidates for the place, principally
fmong whom are Lieutenants Hanna and
.sirdsall and Sergeants Bidwell, Lind
neimer. Brown and Duncan.
At the same meeting the Commission
ers, it is underst 1, will appoint Ser
geant Mooney lieutenant, to fill the
vacancy caused by the tragic ending of
Lieutenant Burke.
Wolf, it is said, will succeed Mooney at
the O'Farrell-etreel Btation. As the posi
tion is considered one of the softest in
the police department, Lees is determined
that his relative shall get it.
Warrant Number Four.
Another warrant was issued yesterday
from Judge Low's court for the arrest of
W. A. Shepard of the Clerks' Exchange
on the charge of petty larceny. The com
plaining witness this time is Jamea B.
Nelson, who alleges that he paid Shepard
a fee of $5 for a position in a retail dry
goods store, but when he went there he
was told there was no vacancy.
Fell Into a Shaft.
Peter McEwen, secretary of the Geo

an elevator shaft in the sidewalk at Bush
and Kearny streets yesterday afternoon.
He was picked up unconscious and taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where he soon
recovered. He escaped without injury.
