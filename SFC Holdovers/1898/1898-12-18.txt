Ten Christmas Sermons
DR. CHARLES H. PARKHURST,
IT is remarkable that while the Scriptures give to us a distinct recital of
the infancy of Jesus and make no attempt to disguise the fact that he
v.as an infant with the veritable helplessness incident to such condition,
yet it is not the littleness of the babe that arrests the Scripture's atten
tion, nor the meaningless frailty of the babe that those Scriptures under
score. Neither Mark nor John has anything to say of an infant Jesus, and
the other evangelists treat his infancy only as an incident, and portray it
In a way intended to draw the whole consciousness of the reader off from
the mere boyish features of the situation and to center that consciousness
upon the wonderfulness, the kindliness and divineness of the being who
passed through the gateway of infancy only because that was the sole
means of becoming perfectly man.
The evangelists were not interested In Jesus because he was little, nor
drawn toward him in sympathy because he was helpless, but already dealt
â¢with him reverently because he was king and worshiped him because he
was Christ, the Lord.
No stringed instrument was ever constructed in such perfection that it
would not flat by use, and, however much we may say of that still finer
instrument we call the human conscience, that, too, flats by use. It is for
ever sagging below the key to which it is naturally pitched, and requiring
the Christmas love and awakening to stiffen it up again. We learn during
the year to do wrong without feeling the wrong of it, and that means that
our deeds are likely to determine our conscience rather more than our con
science to determine our deeds. Men never trust their watches when they
are out of order. But many men habitually trust their consciences when
they are out of order, and do not even take care to celebrate Christmas In
the Chrlstlikc sense in order that they may set their consciences right again.
ThetiQ is a great deal of love in the world, and its amount is increased
by the tokens which it annually makes of itself, exactly as river beds are
deepened by the very currents which slip over them and plow their way
through them. But just as it is a fact that in the middle of the day we for
get the sun because the light which it sheds fills the world so fuU of
brightness as to chase from our minds thoughts of the sun itself that the
brightness springs from, so are Christmas days crowded with the inter
change of love tokens that it is surprisingly easy, right at Christmas, to
forget him whose presence in the world for eighteen hundred years has done
so much to soften human hearts. My message on this Christmas, so near
to the end of the century, is to remember Jesus even at this season as the
Christ and King and not as the Bethlehem infant, to key our consciences
each recurring Christmas and oftener by his precepts, and not to forget,
least of all at Christmas time, to try to foster a love for one who first of
all loved us.
"Behold, I bring
you tidings of great
joy. ' ' â St. Luke
iuio.
W. H. MORELAND,
B shoo Saciamon'o
Diocese, P. E. Church.
THERE is a tendency at Christ
mas to dwell upon externals and
to miss the true, deep meaning
of the day. We look upon it a3 a
holiday, as a time for giving
and receiving presents. Christmas is
the great festival of the home, and 'n
this aspect it is observed by Jews and
non-believers and thousands of others
besides Christians. This 8 one of the
indirect and beneficent effects of Christ
masâthat it leavens the entire commu
nity -with the spirit of love and good
will. You see the throngs upon the
streets, the cruf" in the great stores,
the people planning glad surprises for
one another, and bearing mysterious
parcels whose unwrapping la to bring
a glow of joy into some fellow-crea
ture's heart, or cause the merry shouts
of children to rise on Christmas morn
ing. Multitudes are blessed by Christ
mas who are not yet ready to acknowl
edge Him from whom all the blessings
come. There is this danger: To be ab
sorbed in the outward splendor and
merrymaking of Christmas and
not to penetrate to the great truth
which gives an eternal meaning to all
the festivities of this day.
Also, when "c think of it as a relig
ious festival our thoughts are occupied
with its externals. We picture the
manger and the Virgin mother; we sing
of the angels and the shepherds watch
ing their flocks by night. We join in
the hymns or listen to the great Christ
mas anthem and say "How sweet!
How beautiful!" and pay little heed
to the meaning of the words we use.
Now, leaving externals alone, going
down deeper than Christmas trees and
musiÂ£ and present-making and home
reunions and grand anthems, what is
the great truth of Christmas?
It is the incarnation. We stand face
to face with thit. sublime fact that the
Word was made flesh and dwelt among
us. Man had known something about
God; by the incarnation he knew God.
In the incarnation God himself came
and dwelt with man. God revealed
himself to man in the person of Jesus
Christ. â¢ Â .
Look upon the infant Jesus cradled
in the Virgin's arms. He is the link
between earth and heaven. In him God
and man are joined in one.
This is the meaning of Christmas.
Did not the angels rightly call it "glad
tidings of great joy"? Hear the good
news. then. Listen to the glad tidings!
You are the child of God; you are not
left to perish here in this world of
death and sin. You are destined for
immortality. Carry the news to the
heartsick and the suffering.
Christmas also means that God has
spoken. His tone and final word has
been uttered in Jesus Christ. Is not
this great news? From the beginning
God has been revealing himself to
man as fast as man could receive him.
All truth is from God. as all light is
from the sun. He spoke through Con
fucius. Socrates, Zoroaster, in broken
utterances. Now he has uttered him
self once for all in his son. Every
word and deed of Josus Christ is the
infallible revelation of the eternal God.
Therefore we cry "Good news'." The
tabernacle of God is with men. Good
news! God is saving the world and
blessing men whether they acknowl
edge him or not. Good news! God has
not left any soul in perfect darkness.
Good news! God is light, God is life,
God is "love. Good news!
God's in his heavenâ
Ail's right with the world.

" Glow to God in
the highest and on
earth peace, good
viill toward men."
Luke, n: 14.
REV. WM. RADER
Third Co- g-egational
. Church.
CHRISTMAS dawns this year aa
the day of peace. The boom of
the cannon has ceased, the armies
have laid down their arms, the
sound of the war drum has died
away and the battle flag is furled.
Christmas joys cover a greater por
tion of the globe than ever before.
Christmas trees in the snowy heart of
Alaska; Christmas trees In the far-off
Philippines; Christmas trees in remote
regions where never before such fes
tivities were enjoyed. Boys in blue
have carried the Christmas spirit
around the world in their smokeless
rifles, and from the somber trenches of
Manila, from the hospitals of the East,
from the decks of massive men-of-war,
from a million homes, rises the Christ
mae anthem "and on earth peace, good
will toward men."
This is the theology of the adventâ
Reformer.
international peace and human
brotherhood. Je^us came into the
world to reconcile man with God and
man with man; other leaders brought
power or knowledge or other mani
festations of distinction, but Jesus was
the first to utter the words cut upon
the tomb of Grant, "Let us have
peace." This was the sublime thought
in the overture of angels, the angelio
peace messengers singing above the
Palestinian hills. There are three
things in this text to be emphasized.
First â The expressed recognition of
God's gift in giving us the Savior. The
glory sent back to the throne by the
heavenly hosts was the adoration of
God for his unspeakable gift. That
glory has never ceased. Tongue after
tongue, age after age, church after
church and nation upon nation has sent
back the everlasting prayer. It belongs
to Christmas â this adoration for the
incarnation of Christ. Men should
thank God for Jesus of Nazareth, for
the sermon on the mount, the example
of suffering and the propitiation of our
sins, "and not for ours only, but for the
sins of the whole world."
Second â The prediction of universal
peace. A few days ago men were
startled by the proposition of the Czar
of all the Russias for a universal peace.
The world's chariot of war stopped for
a moment in its bloody tracks, while
men listened with mlngied feelings of
suspicion and reverence to this utter
ance from the throne of Russia. It was
certainly the theology of the advent,
the gospel of Jesus Christ. This pre
diction is not yet translated into re
ality, but it is destined to become ac
tual in the providence of God. It is a
high ideal, raised far above our mili
tary spirit and our enthusiasm for con
quest, but it is not too much to expect
a reign some day of universal brother
hood. The higher peace included in
this teaching, moreover, has to do with
the cessation of the conflict of God
through sin.
Third â The gospel of good will.
Translated strictly this means "good
pleasure," or God's gracious regard for
men as manifested in the gift of salva
tion to them in their wretched condi
tion.
Christmas is the day of God's good
pleasure. Hear it, ye who are down
cast and troubled. Hear it, ye who are
alone and far away from the Father's
house. "Come unto me, all ye that labor
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1898.
and are heavy laden, and I will give
ymi rest." Christmas is the symbol of
the infinite love. God so loved us that
he gave his son. Three things, then,
belong to this day, and these three
things Bhould thrill the whole Christian
world, gloryâ peace â good will. These
elements comprise heaven, and they
are some day to cover the earth as the
waters over the sea.

Father of the World to

H. H. WYMAN,
C S. P.,
St. Mary's Church.
TTTEPE words show to us that the
Christ of prophecy was vener
ated by the ancient Jews, as far
as it was possible, in the same
way that the actual Christ has
b^en by Christians. We shall see this
most clearly if wo study the meaning
of these titles which were applied to
the Messiahs by their Inspired writer,
lsal.is. First, the Messiah is called
Wonderful, which, literally interpreted,
means Miraculous One. And St.~MaU
thew, the evangelist, describes his
birth as follows: "When Mary, his
mother, was espoused to Joseph before
they came together she was found with
child of the Holy Ghost." Further
more, he tells us that this took place
"that the word might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the prophet Isaias say
ing. Behold a virgin shall be with
child and shall bring forth a son and
they shall call his name Errunanue!,
which, being interpreted, is God with
us." The manner of his birth, there
fore, as related in the gospels, proves
his right to the title of Miraculous One
which was given him by the prophet.
Secondly, the title Counsellor belongs
to him more than to any other because
he was the most perfect teacher and
guide that the world has ever known.
All who have ever studied his doctrine
readily admit that he has taught the
world more wisdom than it has ever
learned from any other source or all
other sources put together.
Again, the title, God the Mighty, is
applied to Christ because the incarna
tion of the Son of God shows forth the
divine power in a more singular man
ner even than the creation. Moreover,
no attribute of the Deity is lessened by
the union of the divine with the human
nature as understood and taught by
the Christian religion. As St. Paul says,
speaking of Christ, "In him dwelleth
the fullness of the Godhead corporally."
Christ wa3 perfect God as well as per-,
feet man. There was no mixture of the
two distinct natures in Christ â indeed,
such a thing would be an impossibility.
The fourth title, Father of the World
to Come, denotes the Messiah as the
ruler of eternity, the supreme ruler and
final judge of all mankind. St. Luke,
the evangelist, also describes him as
the Son of Man, who will come in a
cloud with great power and majesty.
And the Apostles' Creed declares that
he will come to judge the living and the
dead.
Finally, he is styled the Prince of
Peace, and this title sets forth his
crowning work, which is the complete
and perfect reconciliation of man with
God. This means the coming of his
kingdom, for which all Christians look
and pray as he has taught them.
"For we have
seen his star in
the east and are
come to wor
ship him." â Matt.
ii:2.
REV. JOHN A. B.
WILSON,
Howard-St eet M. E
Church.
PREVIOUS to the birth of Christ
everywhere in the East men were
looking, because of prophecies,
for the advent of a great King
who should rise from among the
Jews.
In these Eastern countries were men
called magi â wise men who gave their
lives to the study of science and re
ligion, to astrology and astronomy.
These men, for some now unknown
reason, accorded to the Jewish peo
ple and Palestine the patronage of the
constellation Pisces, regarding every.
thing occurring therein of especial im
portance to that nation. Some of these
came at a certain time to the King's
residence, asking: "Where is He that
is born King of the Jews? For we have
seen His star in the East."
What was this star? There have
been many answers to this question;
et us listen to what seems a natural
explanation.
In December, 1604, the astronomer
Kepler saw a strane-e sight in the
leavens which was repeated several
imes in a few months, but which oc
?urs in its entirety but once in 800
.-ears. It was a conjunction of Jupiter
md Saturn, and five months later Ma^a
joined with these two, forcing a fiery
:rigon in the constellation of Pisces.
Kepler, and later Professor Pritch
ird, ma.de calculations which proved
:hat this heavenly event must have
-.aken place in its regular order at
xbout the time of the Saviqr's birth,
md it seems to me that this conjunc
:ion must have formed the new and
splendid "star in the East" which the
â nasri'saw and followed.
The story of their journey and of the
slanet's movements can be told in cor
relative detail and seems to prove, step
jy step, the theory here advanced. In
my event the star was the divine sruide
:o these Eastern inquirers and led them
:o the true Savior of the world.

E. A. WOODS,

IT was an aneel who brought this
message. I suppose he felt honored
as he bore it and the other angeJs
were so interested that they followed
him and joined in a chorus of

â¢arry good news to even one person.

i.s he spake the night was lighted into

vhat was the message of the angel?
'A Savior Is born, who is Christ the

Christ's advent is good tidings to the

FRANKS. FORD,
Patfor First ChrlÂ»t!an
Church.
AT Israel's winter solstice, her
darkest night, when her sins had
separated her and her God; when
her hands were filled with blood
and her fingers with iniquity;
;vhen her lips spoke lies and her tong-ue
tittered wickedness; when she knew
lot the way of peace; when she looked
tor light and beheld darkness, for
brightness but walked in obscurity,
her prophet seeing no hope in man
pointed them to the time when God's
awn arm should work salvation, and
carry forward in spirit to salvation's
2nd its summer noon. He cries:
"Arise, shine; for thy light is come,
and the glory of the Lord is. arisen up
3n three. For, behold, darkness shall
?over the earth and gross darkness the
peoples; but the Lord shall arise upon
thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
thee. And nations shall come to thy
light, and kings to the brightness of
thy rising."
How we have watched, with longing
eyes this faint prophecy of "Summer
eun and summer shine." How slowly
the sun creeps northward. How long
continues the cold and storm and
tempest Dropped from the heart of a
winter of human weakness and evil
came this prophecy of a summer of de
liverance.

"// any man

of Christ."â Rom.

A. J. WELLS, D.D.,
Second Unitarian
Church.
THERE is no dearer festival than
that which falls on the 25th of
December. It has come to be
the most widely celebrated and
gladdest of all the holidays of
the year. It is rooted far back of Its
traditional date. It comes from pagan
peoples, and is full of the aspirations
and hopes of primitive faith; the joy
of the primeval world is on its lips,
and the light of an immortal hope in
Its eyes; and some perfection yet to be
realized is in the spirit of the day. It
draws almost all its charms from the
unselfish element which rules the day.
This was founded in the race from the
first, but the feeble atruistic current
in human nature was greatly strength
ened by the self-devoted life of the
Man of Nazareth. It is distinctly a
human and natural spirit which makes
him dear to the heart of the world.
Not the theological Christ, but the be
nevolent Jesus, is the world's ideal.
His charity, his sympathy, his ethical
teaching, his trust in you, his belief in
man, are shaping our civilization. He
sought to develop, not a system of doc
, trine, but a temper of life; not a
dogma, but a disposition. In this he
is an enlarging influence, an unwast
ing power. He does not sit apart, as
a Prince of Heaven, but is here in hu
man memory and love, a spirit in the
midst of the governments of men. It
is through the quality of our spirits
and not through the constructions of
our intellects that his consecration en
ters and holds us, so that the spirit of
his life is often missed in the churches
and found in the humanitarian move
ments of the world. .. -^-.
He taught a cheerful religion.' Ha
lived a cheerful life. It is a mistake to
call him a "man of sorrow." That ref
erence was to Israel and not to Jesus.
He "came eating and drinking," a man
of the people, with red blood in his
veins and a serene and free and joy
ous heart within his breast. His dis
position was social, his sympathies hu
man and humane. He was full of com
passion, for the suffering and the sin
ful. Compassion: to suffer with â no
other word so fully characterizes him.
If possible, he would have healed all
the sick, recovered to purity and in
ward peace all the sinful. Yet his
treatment of hypocrisy was blasting as
the lightning flash. Professional piety
that was void of human kindness and
helpfulness he lashed with flery scorn.
In the spirit of his life, while we give
to each other "Christmas. gifts," let us
give also trust. Let us have no friends
whom we cannot hold by the tenure of
utter confidence, and let us trust God
and life.
Let the great forces wise of old
Have their full way with thee.
Seek to have always "the larger
heart, the kindlier hand." and to sea
that God is ever coming into the life
of the world with new promise and
fresh deliverance, and firmer and
higher triumph.

Babe of Bethlehem ftt once the best gift and the greatest deed.

AT DAYLIGHT on Christmas morning,
1x62, the Army of the Cumberland
' i V' eSflip and marched south from
Nashville, over the Nolanville and
MAJOR JOHN H.
SIMPSON.
' Murfrccsboro pike. to engage the Army of
the Tennessee, under Central HragÃ, in hard-fought battle on the
gloomy banks of Stone River.
Skirmishing which developed the advance lines of Bragg's army
began near Lavergne, and the battle raged with varying success
throughout the entire week. On New Year's morning (1863)Â» however,
victory having crowned the efforts of the Union forces, the brigade
of the late Oeneral John F. Miller hoisted the Stars and Stripes over
the courthouse in Murfrecsboro. i.
General Miller, by the way, afterward came out here to California,
and after making a beautiful home, which he called "Lrftvergne" in
memory of that battle, near Napa Springs, most ably represented this
State in the national Senate.
I have always remembered this particular Christmas week, not
alone because 30,000 men were slain during those bloody days, but
because of the fact that early in the battle the Confederate cavalry
made a detour in our fear and destroyed our commissary stores, in
consequence of which we had absolutely nothing to eat during the
time which is usually a season of feasting,
I was captain of thd Fourth Michigan Cavalry â a regiment which
came out of the war with a record of ninety-one battles and ended
its exploits with the capture of Jefferson Davisâ and my boys were
fortunate enough to find some corn cribs which had not been
plundered. For three days we had one ear Of hard "horse-tooth"
corn apiece, and only surface water polluted with dead bodies of men
and animals to drink. But we lived through it and fought through
It; and when that flag went up over that courthouse on New Year's
day we felt that our Christmas had been a glorious One in spite of
â and that ours was the best Christmas story that could be told.

I CAN only think of a little Christmas
story which seemed to me very pathetic
since it so exemplified "She hath done
what ehe could."
MARTIN
REGENSBURGER, M.D
1 Munich, where I passed my student
days, has a rather peculiar system of medical assistance for the poor.
The town Is divided into districts, each of which has a central station
with a resident professor. Word sent there of illness or accident
brought an advanced student to the sufferer at once. "Were the case
6erious the professor was also summoned, but in any event the poor
were properly and gratuitously treated at their homes, ana the
students gained much practical knowledge which was of great assist
ance to them at the beginning of their careers.
One day I was summoned to an old Baroness who was in the last
stages of consumption and in bitter poverty. I did what I could to
relieve her sufferings and formed a genuine attachment for her, since
Ehe was not only a lady by title, but one by birth and breeding. There
â was nd hope of curing her, but I did my best to cheer and comfort
her, and she grew to like me cordially.
11l us she was she still kept about and was, as often happens in
such cases, always buoyant and hopeful, with no realization of her
true state, though I knew that she Was very near to death. '
Christmas eve I went to an all-night ball, and although it came
on to storm during, the night I determined, as I went home In the
morning, to call in and Bee my old patient and give her a Christmas
greeting. '. :H& . ; - *
She was glad to see me, but horrified at my imprudence In going
about in dancing pumps in such weather. She scolded me in motherly
fashion, then absolutely made me remove my shoes and pocks and
flry my feet while she rummaged In a huge old chest, from which she
resurrected ft bundle of knit white yarn stockings.
"They were the Baron's," she said tearfully. "I knit them myself,
and they are all I have left to remember him â all else I have sold."
And she made me put a pair on my feet while she dried my shoes, and
sent me home dry-shod find comfortable.
The next day she died, quite suddenly, but peacefully, and they
found on her table a little holographic will which she had made at
almost the List moment, in which, after saying that her few other
personal belongings should be sold to pay her small debts and bury
her, she decreed that I, "the kind young doctor," should have "the
Baron's woolen stockings as a Christmas gift."
I detest woolen stockings, but 1 kept those for years, since they
seemed to me to have a special value. They -ere ah she had to give,
" and her dearest possessionâ and out of purest gratitude she gave
them to "the kind young doctor," who had but done his duty.
THE b?st Christmas story that I ever
heard, which had any connection with

should be cared for. The young ladies became nursegirls, and the
unconscious little waif will be clothe and educated and trained in
womanly ways, as If born to affluence, and mercy, as of old, will be
"twice blessed."
I do not think that this occurred on Christmas day. No matter,
it occurred, and the spirit of Christmas was in it. Noble deeds do not
wait for the coming of traditional Saints' day. "The better the day
the better the deed" is a Baying not true. No time is holy time save
as human lives make it so, and Friday is an "unlucky day" only in
the superstitions of ignorance. It is not the grand deeds so much
as the good deeds that beautify life â the thousand little acts of
kindness and love and self-devotion. The glory of Christmas day
Is, that a spirit of "otherness" has entered the world. It is full of sug
gestions of love, and courtesy, and peace. It is abused when wealth
flaunts Its gifts, or selfishness spreads, hoping for something In return.
Its spirit Is Insulted by an appearance of generosity and all pretense
of friendshipâa grumbling concession to custom where no love is felt.
The saving of the poor for weeks that a gift may be bestowed; the
s^lf-denial of love that another life may be brightened; the laughter
that for a time forgets care; the charity of hand and heart; the
benevolence that gives the poor for one day a hint of plenty and the
human intereat that glints with sunphine the gray skies of the despair
ingâthis Is the true spirit of Christmas day.

bareback riding, and enjoyed the wandering life immensely until cold
weather came. It wasn't so very cold, of course, for we were on the
Southern circuit, but it was raining and kind of desolate, and along

up on top of the lions' cage every night, rolled up in blankets.

1 the once widely known "Jim" Fisk of
JL New York h v In them as much of the
true Christmas spirit as is tver found In
the bestowal of gifts during ttiat season.
Fisk, as every one knows, was an extremely rough and gruff man
when in his business office, but underneath that unpleasin? exterior,
and In spite of his many serio.ua faults of character, he had one of
the warmest and most charitable hearts that ever beat for all who

were really poor and suffering. He had a cordial contempt for all
forms of organized or "cut and dried" charity, and he never encour
aged chronic beggars to contide to him thoir tales of woe. He nai Jt
however, a system of his own for separating the wheat from the chaff
in cases of distress which were reported to him, and no one who "was
really suffering ever failed to get at least a little assistance from him,
after he had assured himself of their condition.
But it was at Christmas time that he went into the business of
alms-giving, or, as he preferred to call itâ "gift-giving" on a wholesale
scale. During the year ne kept a record of all the cases that came
under his not! c. and on the day before Christmas every poor family
and every Indigent widow on his list received from him a ton of
coal and .>. bnrrel of flour. This was his regular "gift," and it took
hundreds of them to go around, but added to this in special cases
was a big basket of groceries and a selection of new garments suited
to the freezing winters of that locality.
No fuss was ever made about this in the newspapers. There was
no "spreaa ' and no public presentations to advertise the donor and
humiliate the recipient, and personal thanks always made the giver
angry.
When Jim Ftek died, however, the most sincere mourning for him
wan in th. hearts of the poor he had so long befriended, and every
Christmastide for years the story of his past kindness was told with
tears in many wretched homes.

C. F. HOLBROOK,

Christmas was the following:
A lady who happened to be out on a neighborly errand last Christ
mas day in a hilly street near the Twin Peaks saw two boys running
down the steep incline dragging behind them something attached to
a rope. She thought at first that the something was a bundle of rags,
but as they drew nearer she saw that it was a dog â a dead one, she
supposed, seeing the inanimate body hitting against all obstructions
and bounding into the air with the force of the .'rripact. The sight
was most unpleasing and became worse when, as they passed her,
she saw a feeble movement of the poor beast's bruised limbs and real
ized that it was still alive. Forgetting conventionalities, she ran after
the youthful torturers, and by threats of arrest forced them to stop.
Then she obliged them to cut the rope with which the dog was well
nigh strangled, bring water and pour it over its swollen head, and
finally carry it to her homo, where *ne restored it to consciousness.
Perhaps really the best part of this simple story is that before
this good Samaritan suffered those two boys to depart she so gently
and sweetly convinced them of their wrong-doing that they promised
never again to be guilty of auch cruelty, and they have kent that
promise for the whole year, whlio the dogâ plump and happyâ has
forgotten how near he came to death by torture last Christmas

~ of the best Christmas deeds I ever heard of.
Mr. and Mrs. Matthews at that time were conducting a mission,
with which \ afterward became connected, on Pacific street near
Stockton, and one evening they gave out this notice: "Thero is to be
a grand Christmas dinner here on Christmas day, and you are all
invited."
I know how their larder was supplied, and I marveled at
their action In giving out such an invitation, but said nothing to thorn
on the subject, of bourse, nor indeed to any one else. At Â».hat time
Mr. Dan Cook lived on what Is known as "Nob Hill." and I wan a
frequent visitor at his great white mansion. One evening shortly be
fore Christmas Mrs. Cook sent for me, and receiving me In the recep
tion-room near the dining hall, came toward me amillng.
"Hold out your hands," said she, and I obeyed. On one palm phe
laid two broad twenty-dollar gold pieces, and a like sum oa the other.
"This Is from Mr. Cook," she said, "forty for yourself and family
and forty to be put elsewhere where it will do the most good."
Straightway I went to Mrs. Matthews.
"What have you done concerning the big dinner?" I asked.
"Nothing, brother; we have a ham promised. 'The Lord will
provide.' "
I showed her â¢what Mrs. Cook had entrusted to me, and although
it was 10 p. m. we went at once to several stores on Stockton street
near Montgomery avenue. Three larse baskets were tilled with pro
visions and with the assistance of a policeman carried to the Pacific
street mission. Mr. Matthews, an invalid, was aroused from sleep,
and we had a prayer meeting at midnight â a thanksgiving service
over the three full baskets. It was a moonlight night. At 1 a. m.,
i
with a VF&rmth of heart r.ot to be described, I returned to my home,
knowing that a weight had been lifted from the minds of two worthy
but impecunious philanthropists, and that Mr. Cook and his tru'V
charitable wife had prospeetively made many the richer by their
generosity. The memory of that Christmas dinner will remain green
vhile I live. Dan Cook is no more, but high above his gift may be
remembered.
That dinner was indeed a prand affair, and -ince then I nave
believed fully that under all circumstances surely the "Lord will
provide."
r"T"\HE Christmas deed that made me the
;! happiest was. I think, the following:
I About sixteen years ago I took into
JL my care a poor little crippled boy. He
was only one among the many whom I have
tried to shield and shelter when there seemed no other place in the
world for them, but I always felt for him an especial affection and
pity because of' the physical affliction which made it impossible for
him ever to mingle with the world upon an equal footing.
He was always a good boy, wHling to help with the children
smaller than himself, and do what he could to make life in the Sneuer
*ng Arms better and brighter. I grew to love him very dearly, ana
many a night I spent hours thinking and planning about his lutuie,
for I could not give him the education I longed to, and when it came
to supporting himself by manual labor I felt that he would najre a
very poor chance with others who were stronger and better able to
make their way in the world.
One day, however, a new building was begun on Market street,
and as I watched it growing nearer completion a thought occurred to
me Shortly before Christmas I went to the owner's office and sent in
my name. Five minutes afterward I was admitted to the presence of
one of the wealthiest men in our State, and he received me as court
eously and kindly as if I had been a princess of the blood.
I told him the simple little story of the poor, deserted, crippled
little boy whom I had adopted, and asked him if he would not give
him a chance to earn his living in that fine new building. I knew
he would be faithful and trustworthy, and tV millionaire believed me
â when I said so.
"He shall have the place," he said decidedly, "on Christmas day,
and I thanked him from my heart.
As soon as the Emma Spreckels building was completed my boy
went there to work. His salary is generous and he is treated well by
every one. Each month he is enabled to lay aside a part of his earn
ings for less fortunate days which may come, and he has grown manly,
independent and strong of heart, feeling that he is earning his own
way and doing his duty. I shall always feel that in giving my boy
the place that has proved so beneficial to him Claus Spreckels did one
of the best Christmas deeds I ever heard of.

then, taken in conjunction with surrounding
circumstances.
Dave was a negro of powerful physique, a great bully and fighter
among his fellow negroes, and very impudent on occasion to white
people, even while he waa a slave. For years he ran the ferry-boat
across the Alabama River at Cahaba, and even after he became a

there was no other darkey around there who could do it as well. He
was more insolent than ever after he was free, and used always to
refuse to take people across the river after dark unless he counted
them special friends or they paid him extra.
One day shortly after Christmas I had occasion to cross and dur

I YJ told me by the chief actor therein,
XTAand to me it proves â if proof were
needed â the power and the blessing of faith.
A few years ago a widow, who was trying, here m San Francisco,
to support herself and four little ones by her own unaided exertions
found herself as Christmas day approached, possessed of only enough
money to pay the rent of her humble home. Her landlord was very
strict, and the rent was due on the 26th. Her business was plain
sewing but there was little of that to be done at holiday times, and,
alhough she could ask a few dimes' credit for absolutely necessary
food, she could think of no way in which to secure an extra dollar or
bo for her children's Christmas.
Taking her oldest child of 9 years into hen*confidence. she told
her that Santa Claua, who had been good to them in the past, this
year would not have enough toys and candles to go around and so
her little family must go without, and she asked her to tell and com
fort her little sister and brothers.
While the mother was crying silently over her work she heard the
child in the next room breaking the unwelcome news, but she aaaed
thereto:
"God's bigger than Santa Claus and He can make him come!
Let's us all pray just as hard aa we can and I know God won't let
him sneak by."
Down on their knees the four went, and prayed with all their baby
hearts, and the mother, hearing it all. stopped crying and made up her
mind to have as much faith in her Maker as her little child had. â¢ â¢
The rent money went for ChrisrYnas cheer, and the mother put

Instead of a baby we lived in the Sierras, and the day before Christ

We had made preparations for the stocking filling and the storm

bethought him that he wanted nothing so much In all the world as
a red wagon and a knife for his Christmas presents. Full of childish
faith he borrowed a pencil and covered several scraps of paper with
the little saw-teeth by which Santa Claus was supposed to be in

WHEX I left Paris in October,
18S6, it was to go to Pales

sonal contact with those
spots sanctified by the pres

in the neighborhood, Gethsemane iind

I r. served for Christinas my visit to
Bethlehem, that little spot destined to
immortality because of the birth of the
Savior within its confines.
On the day before Christmas, accom
panied by the French Consul, I depart
ed from Jerusalem toward Bethlehem,
resolved to see that place and its sanc
tified grotto on the anniversary ot the
very night when Jesus the Christ first
opened his eyes upon the world which
He had come to save. But a.ias, for
the emotions which filled my being, I
could not have chosen a more unfor
tunate time. As we were on our way
I noticed great crowds of people of
every nation on the ia.ee of the globe
hurrying in the same direction,
anxiously, eagerly, as if they feared to
miss some part of an exhibition. We
arrived in Bethlehem, and through the
inlluence of the Consul were permitted
to pass the night in the very grotto in
â which Christ was born.
Throng at the Savior's Birthplece.
To my surprise and horror I found a
seething mass of men and women surg
ing around the place trying to push
each other aside and se< â they knew
not what. I was Infinitely shocked,
for it seemed to me that these thou
sands lacked all reverence for this, the
holiest place on earth to a believing
Christian. I had hoped, burying my
self In reflection upon the wondrous
nativity, to pass the- night in prayer
and meditation. I hardly dared, to do
more than peep at the place in which
the Virgtn had born-.- the world's Re-
deemer â but these people, this mob, ap
peared to lack all sense and sentiment;
I wondered how much they understood,
how deeply they reverenced the Savior.
I was glad when the night was past;
I would have made my escape at once
had it been possible to pass through
that curious, pushing, josiling crowd.
I determined never to come to Bethle

experience. I followed the path which
leads from Nazareth to that town to

Where Christ Was Born.

a considerable distance in the moun
tains, forming chambers connected
with each other. As a matter of fact

in them that Mary and Joseph, finding

tradition as the exact birthplace of the
Chri3t is situated in the lower part of
one of these caves reached by two
Blopes, now converted into flights of
stone steps.
Between the two sets of steps is a
slight depression which tradition indi
cates as the spot to which Mary retired
when the divine child was born. It
was only after the birth that she car
ried him a few paces to a more com
modious place, more sheltered from the
cold, where It was possible to give the
cave something of the semblance of a
room.
There, says the legend, were some
animals; an ox and an ass. However
that may be, Mary found something
there to serve the purpose of a crib in
which to lay her new born child. This
crib, or manger, as it is generally call
ed, is now preserved in the Church <>f
Santa^Maria-Xaggiore at Rome, where
it is visited and venerated by numerous
pilgrims.
Location of the Temples.
The place rendered sacred by the
birth of. the Savior, naturally, has been
a goal of pilgrimage to many thou
sands besides myself. The early Chris
tians flocked to it in crowds. After the
revolt of the Jews, under Bar-Cochba,
the Emperor Hadrian had a temple to
Jupiter erected on the Mount of Olivets
on the very scene of the ascension; a
temple to Venus on Golgotha, and one
to Adonis above the Grottos of Bethle
hem. These three temples remained
standing for one hundred and eighty
years, thus providentially attesting the
rites of these venerated sanctuaries un
tii the time when St. Helena, mother of
Emperor Constantine, replaced them
with basilicas in honor of Jesus Christ.
The Basilica of Bethlehem is still
standing and with the exception of the
io, which is hidden by massive
buildings, is almost intact.
The interior consists of five naves,
divided by rows of columns with Corin
thian capitals, which were probably
taken from the ruins of the Temple of
Jerusalem,' doubtless the source of
much of the material used in the basiii
cas of St. Helena, which were erected
in a very short space of time.
â Where the Shepherds Watched.
Many have wondered how it was
possible for the shepherds to be watch
ing j.i the open air at the time when
Christ was born. The place where the
shepherds were when the angels ap
peared to them is supposed to have
been what is now called Beit-Sahour, a
word signifying "The House of the
[The Wise fiEN journeying to Bethlehem ..,-
Copyrighted, 1894-1 895, by J. J. Tissot
Shepherds." It is surprising at first
sight that shepherds should be watch
ing their flocks in the open air at the
time of the year set for the nativity,
for the cold must have been intense. It
was no doubt to the end of December
that the account In Holy Writ re
fers, but the pastures were not vast
grazing grounds where the sheep were
gathered together in thousands from
every direction, but mere local fields,
where each shepherd tended his own
little group of animals, and there is
nothing in this to surprise any one fa
miliar with the customs of the East.
After the December rains are over
the grass begins to grow again and the
flowers reappear. The severity of the
winters vary very much, and some
especially fine days occur, even in the
very heart of the cold season, when the
6h< pherda of Bethlehem would go down
into the plain with their Hocks, as the
Arabs do now in good season.

ing watch over their flocks by night."
The night was always divided into
three so-called watches. The shep
herds changed guards every three
hours during the short night of the
summer and every four hours during
the longer nights of the winter. In the
latter case the first watch ended at 10
and the second at 2. while the third
lasted till daybreak. The shepherds on
guard gathered round the campflre
while waiting their turn to rest, and
it must have been to those thus wait
ing that the angels appeared. They no
doubt wakened their comrades to tell
them the wonderful news, and after
ward all went together to Bethlehem,
where they found and worshiped the
Holy Child.
The other personages mentioned in
Scripture in connection with the birth
of Jesus are the Magi. Magi or sooth
sayers are mentioned in the Book of
Daniel as being in the service of King
Nebuchadnezzar. They studied aÃtron
omy and interpreted dreams. Those
referred to in the gospels seem to have
been not only wise men, but kings, or
Sheiks of Chaldea and its neighbor
hood. They, too, engaged in the
study of the heavenly bodies and per
haps also worshiped them, a fact which
explains the immediate attention ac
corded to a sien appearing in the heav
ens at the moment of the birth of the
Messiah. The color of their undergar
ments, yellow, indicated their profes

My Visit to the Summer Home .
of the Queen of Spain
By Mrs. FranK. Leslie.
Special to the Sunday Call.
SINCE the recent "unpleasant
ness" -with Spain her country and
people have become a source of
curiosity and interest to usâper
haps on the principle of General Da
mas, who says in the "Lady of Lyons,"
"It is astonishing how I like a man
after having fought with him."
Such being the case, it may be of
interest to the readers of The Call to
hear something about the summer
home of the Queen Regent and the
"Little King," as her son is called.
The Queen is said to be a bit of a bigot,
us suits her position upon the throne
bequeathed by Philip V, but either by
birth or training, she has reached an
impassibility of expression I have never
seen equaled. A mask of marble could
be no colder than her face. She has
really no beauty; her teeth are large
and projecting and inadequately cov
ered by her full lips, and her mass of
ash blonde hair is not lighted up by a
tinge of gold. Her pale blue eyes might
have been pretty had the lashes been
heavier and darker or if brightened
by tenderness or any softening emotion.
Her figure, however, is tall, slender,
graceful and aristocratic in the ex
treme, and her hand 3 and feet are small
and admirably shaped and bear testi
mony to her high birth. She has won
thSrespect of the Spanish people by her
ditrnity. courage and good sense. The
royal' widow's every action is prudent
and her manner grave and self-pos
sessed. Her anxiety to please the peo
ple over whom she hopes that her son
is to rule is exemplified by the assidu
ous manner in which she immediately
gave herself over to the study of the
Spanish language after her husband's
death, and which she now speaks with
the utmost fluoucy even if the accent
leaves something to be desired.
There are women to whom sorrow

San Sebastian is almost on the
frontier between France and Spain and
the Queen Regent, after visiting there
for a few seasons, finally adopted it as
the summer home of herself and court.
San Sebastian has much to say for
herself quite apart from the fact that
the bay of La Concha, protected from
the too vigorous rush of the Biscayan
tides by the island of Santa Clara, is
one of the most charming and popular
bathing places in the world.
La Concha has always alluringly
curved her softly rounded arms- the
Bay of Biscay has always rushed to
their embraceâ and Santa Clara has
think it was a comet or some other
similar body; others are of the opinion
that it Avas a meteor, resembling more
or less a shooting star, which trailed
slowly along at a little distance from
the ground so as actually to guide the
steps of the Magi. The gospel seems
to sanction the latter interpretation
when it says: The star "came and
stood over where the young child was."
A star, properly so called, would not
have indicated the spot with such pre
cision. Nevertheless, it is clear that
the significance of the sign was re
vealed in some way to the Magi.
Had the travelers exchanged ideas
previous to their arrival? It is very
probable that they had. No doubt their
caravans, though they started from
different points, met beyond the Jor
dan on the side of the mountains of
Moab, whence they entered the prom
ised land, still preceded by the star.
The word "house" used by the evan
gelists to indicate the place where the
Magi found the Messiah seems to point
to the conclusion that during the jour
ney of their visitors from the east Jos
eph and Mary had left the cave of the
nativity for a more comfortable dwell
ing.
It Is impossible to convey the ideas
aroused in the breast of the devout
Christian by the sight of Bethlehem
and its sanctified spots any better or
more clearly than in the pictures in
which I have tried to express my inter
pretation of thosÂ« stirring scenes as
they must have taken place.
If. by my pictures and books, I have
been able to bring the Christ nearer to
the minds and hearts of Christians of
all lands, I am more than repaid for all

ways stood between them. That through
the Queen Regent the world flocked
hither is a mere matter of detail.
Doubtless the prosperity of San Sebas
tian for the past ten years is due to
this influx of the world, but like a gay
new costume on some venerable and
dignified old lady one is rather sorry
to see the improvement and regrets the
stately indifference to fashion that city
and dame alike must lose in trying to
keep up with the world.
Why! it is said that not a decade be
fore Christina came to San Sebastian,
and when it was proposed to get up a
ball In honor of Queen Isabella, the idea
was abandoned because no woman in
the town owned a ball dress and it was
deemed useless to go to the expense of
a costume which could never again be
used until another advent of royalty.
All this is changed now, for more mag
nificent toilets I have never seen than
in San Sebastian a few years ago.
As a frontier town San Sebastian has
been the scene of many stirring events,
and has been snatched by the French
and torn back by the Spanish in half a
dozen terrible conflicts, each one of
which has left its stamp unon the
ancient city. As early as the ninth
century it was conquered by the
Romans, who called the place Izurum
Freed from the Roman yoke, it was
known as Ponosliga, which is Basque

having driven out the Moors, became
consolidated into one kingdom, the
Basque provinces of Guipuzcoa, Alva
and Vizcaya drew together refusing to
merge their ancient privileges in the
general government and like the Swiss
showed themselves so determined to
sacrifice life, rather than liberty, that
their claims soon took the form of
rights, and the little seigniory became

The origin of the Basque people is
lost in antiquity. Noah is for them
quite a modern and familiar cousin. I

business was transacted on this clay in the

talked of any popular novelist; the mere whisper of

; He would only acknowledge one living poet, a young j
gentleman of forty, and of bilious aspect and venomous !
tongue, who had brought out two little volumes in white [
and gold. Nobody had read himâ it is a Philistine worldâ
except the club critic. He : found fault every day with
everything on the table. The mutton was execrable; the
wine was either corked or "gone off," or not what it pre
tended to be; and so on.
Now, his friends, who also thought pretty well of them
selves as critics, naturally resented the superiority of this
member; they, you see, could pass the Royal Academy
without a shudder, and they refused to read the one living
poet. But they observed - that, though this ultra-critical i
young man called the mutton bad names, he devoured it '
with apparent pleasure; and, while he cursed the claret,!
he drank it with seeming enjoyment. Also, that he read
the popular novelist secretly, and laughed; and he went to
the theater, and not only laughed, ; but also cried.
â  And one of them at last tried an experiment upon him.
This person repaired secretly to a lady of miraculous powers I
and of great modesty. She said she had spent thirty years
with the miraculous Mahatmas of Thibet, and had learned
how to work their miracles. And she confessed that among
those simple people she had lived as a kind of a goddess.
- So this member of the club went to her and said, "Do
the thing I ask and I will believe and become one of your
disciples." Then he sat down and whispered tremulously.
And there was ra v chink as of coin. And the lady laughed!

said she was going to 'illustrate telepathy; and she
whispered in the ears of the image. She was really a Â»
most wonderful woman, and her name, was Sapphira Endor
Then she turned a to that club man and she said- "Go He :

AT Washington alarming: fires or accidents will occur in hotels or the
aters, attended with an appalling loss of life. Railways will prosper
and the traffic returns will be very heavy. The weather will ue
marked by great storms of wind, shocks of earthquake and strange
phenomena.
JUNE 21â At Washington the ingress takes place in the forenoon, when
Virgo will be rising and Gemini culminating. There will be strikes and
dissembllngs in the States, and a heavy record of crime and accident.
The weather will be unpropitious and wet, and damage the harvest. Seri
ous Â«hocks of earthquake will occur, and explosions or accidents in coal
mines. The President will suffer in health and popularity. There will be
a pood deal of excitement arid warlike rumors.
JANUARYâ The passage of Saturn and Uranus through the ruling sign
of Spain will cause great misfortunes in that unhappy country, and the
r^trogradation of Mars in Leo will excite the minds of our neighbors across
the channel Italy, too, will feel the ill-effects. In Russia plots will be
hatched London "and the United States will suffer from crime and vio
lence and other misfortunes. JuDiter in Scorpio will benefit the northern
countries of Africa. In Ireland distress will be keen and widespread.
FEBRU A.RY-- The retrogradation of Mars in Cancer will trouble Er.tr
land India Scotland. China and Portugal. Sedition will be rife, terrible
accidents will" occur and the minds of the people will be unsettled and war
like In' Spain and Hungary trouble will occur in shoals, and insurrection
or civil war is very probable, The passage of Saturn and Uranus throueh
Sagittary 'will turn Spain upside down.
M ARCHâ Railways and traveling will be unsafe, and many accidents
wllloccur Appalling disasters will occur in navigation. Toward the close
of the month public excitement in connection with foreign or colonial af
fairs will run very high. The quartile of Mercury and Mars at the full
moon threatens strifes and many fires and accidents in the land.
APRILâ The planetary transits are unfavorable for Spain, Turkey, the
United States and France, more especially toward the close of the month,
when Mars gets well advanced in thUsign Leo.
M\Yâ The planetary transits for the month are similar to those for April,
for the passage 'of Herschel and Saturn through Sagittary will occupy
many years and months respectively. During this time we may expect ser
ious conflicts, in Spain especially, and probably an upset of the dynasty.
The United States will suffer likewise from the presence of those planets in
opposition to her ruling sign. London will be excited with unheardof acci
dents fires and robberies. The presence of Mars in Leo will excite the Gaul.
In Italy, also, passion will run high. Ireland will suffer from an inclement

and plots and crime' will largely increase Paris will also be unfortunate
and suffer from storms. Portugal will be In trouble with some foreign pow

cloud, which the presence of Mars in Virgo will accentuate and intensify.
The retrogradation of Jupiter in Scorpio is favorable for Jvorthern Africa.
Scotland and Holland, but not for Ireland.
JULYâ The may of the full moon on the 22d is important, as several
planets occupy prominent and Important positions There will be strange
disasters in navigation, collisions and wrecks. The occidental position of
Mars is fraught with a great deal of danger to the peace of Europe. Mens
Pa*F.icr.B will run high, and rumors of war will be thick m the air. This
position Is also unfavorable for our colonial possessions and for our Â«*â 
leries. and explosions or disasters will occur in the latter. The weather
will be unpropitious for agriculture, and the harvest will be much below the
In" Turkey and Paris strange crimes will be committed, and murders
will be frequent; in Spain and the United States troubles will fall thick and
fast, and even London will not escape altogether.
AUviUSTâ Mara has now entered the sign Libra, find, as this sign rules
China we may expect troubles in thÂ»t quarter, probably a fanatical attack
on some missionary station. Austria will also suffer from the presence of
Man In Its mling sign. The transits of Uranus and Saturn through the sign
Sagi'ttarv are very unpropitious for Hungary, and denote an excited si .â¢â â¢
of the populace, and a strong inclination to break away from the rule of
Austria and make itself into a separate kingdom.
SEPTEMBERâ The transit of Mars in the sign Libra denotes much
trouble for China and a warlike or rebellious fooling. Crime will be fre
quent and terrible. England and In
dia trill also suffer in a lesser degree,
find chiefly by a prevalence of suicidal
mania. Strikes wiH occur, also colliery
disasters. The transits are also par
ticularly unfavorable for Spain, Lon

OCTOBERâ There will be grave dan
ger of a rupture. Let those in a.'hnr
ity take heed, and not be rash or hasty
In their actions, otherwise the result
will be disastrous. There will be
shocks of earthquakes, tidal waves and
disasters in collieries. The autumn of
this year will witness many strange
and appalling events, which will strike
terror into the hearts of the stoutest
and cause a deep seated feeling of unÂ»
rest and uncertainty as to what the
morrow may bring forth. It will be

vastnesp of nature and nature's God.

charter will be passed and we will have an era of prosperity.
In a large measure this will be due to the Mayor. He is going
to make the most wonderful record of any man who has ever held the of
fice. Everything seems to look as favorable for him during office as it did
during election. For I knew then, even when his cause seemed to weaken,
that nothing could interfere with his final election.
We will have a great many rumors of war, but there will be no flirht
ing whatever. That is, no fighting during the next year, 1899.
Our State is very fortunate in its selection of a Governor. Governor
Gage will serve the "people faithfully and will rule justly.
There will be gold excitement, but it will be centered in California.
There is far more gold here thfxn in the Klondike.
I want to say particularly that there will be political reform. The de

WE predict that during the years of 1898 to 1901 there is to be a eri-
Jis of drought and a general shortage of crops in the Northern,
Northwestern an., some of the Central States.
The center of the next Jupiter disturbance will fall in the year
1900, and it is certain that two to three seasons during the Jupiter
equircctial periods will be years of minimum rainfall.
There are to be at least two seasons of great dryness and shortage of
crops in the great grain producing sections of the United States. The
drought will begin to be felt in IS9B (witness the total of 9.38 inches for last
winter in California, in the western and northwestern parts of our country;
the dryness will increase during 1899, and will probably reach a crisis in 1900.
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and all the planets except Neptune are to con
gregate on the same side of the sun at about the time of the next Jupiter
equinox, and it is likely that phenomena of unusual character and force
may resultâ probably in the shape of an excess of earthquakes and storms
âin 1900 and 1901.

the moon at extreme declination north. There will probably he a rising
temperature and falling barometer about Christmas day, and the hardest
storm of the season will very probably visit California between Christ
mas and New Year's day. '
This storm, I predict, will not average more than two inches of rainfall,
and there will be only light and scattered showers for the remainder of the
"rainy season." 1 .
A high baromoter with cold gales will follow this storm/ and although
there are to be some rains during January and February, they will be so
light that they will have little effect in bettering the situation.
That the season so far has been extremely dry all must admit, but in
ISSO, when the rain up to November 19 was only .06 of an inch, the entire
rainfall for the season was 5.56 over the normal.

IN order to loam about the year 1899 I sat down, and no sooner did 1
grasp the poncil when I commenced to write under the control. I kept
writing "two years more, two years more." I most have covered three
sheets with these words. Then under the guidance of the control I wrote
"dry season, two years more."
I could get nothing else save this, though I tried time and again. It
kept repeating this same prophecy. So I fear that we will have dry sea
eons for the next two year?.
But I also felt, while under the control, that we are going to have a
remarkably healthful year. I cannot see any widespread epidemic, nor will
the death-rate from ordinary diseases be large. I feel that the people of
Ran Francisco are going to enjoy remarkably good health during the next
year.
Colonel Dan Burns will not be elected to the Senate. I felt that posi
tively while under the control, and I am never mistaken. I know that
Colonel Burns will be defeated as surely as I knew that Gage would be
elected Governor.
The defeat of Colonel Burns and the dry season for the next two years
were the only things the control would tell me that would be of general in
terest.

so often that I would be willing to take my oath that the Queen has
still seven years to live.
No one realises the possibilities of the Hawaiian Islands. There are
groat and valuable coal mice* lying there, unknown and undiSCOYered.
These will be found during the coming year, and will cause a tidal wave
of prosperity.
Through this and the discovery of new gold mines in California we will
have a prosperous year in San Francisco despite the dry year.
Ido not predict the drought that some say is sure tn prevail. But it
will rain very moderatel;- ..iroughout the State. The south will have the
heaviest downpour.
Crops will not be as large this year as last, and next year they will
be still smaller. For I feel that next year we will have a loner dry spell.
â During the coming year the United States and German^ will become in
volved in a war. What the immediate oausp of the war will lie I cannot
say. Nor do I seem to be able to tell whether the war will be a long or
short one. But I can say positively that there will be one. and in all prob
ability it will occur during the forthcoming year.
I feel that in spite of the outlook tho y^ar will be a very prosperous
one in San Francisco. The sold and coal discoveries in th.' Hawaiian
Islands will probably play an important part. I am sure that the farmer*
will be agreeably disappointed. It will not be a high-tide of prosperity for
them, but it will be far better than is expected.

watched that it does not sound plausible to say that they are in
any danger. But it is bound to come.
While they will be more or less damaged none of them will burn to thÂ«

Famous Prophecy, 1648.
A HOUSE of glass shall come to pass
In England; but alas!
War will follow with the work
In the land of the pagan and Turk,
And State and State in fierce strife
Will seek each other's life;
But when the North shall divide the South
An eagle shall build in the Lion's mouth.
Carriages without horses shall go,
- And accidents fill the world with woe;
Primrose Hill in London shall be,
And in Its center a bishop's see;
Around the world thoughts shall fly
In the twinkling of an eye.
Water shall yet more wonders do,
Now strange, yet shall be true;
The world upside down shall be
And gold found at the root of tree.
Through hills man shall ride,
And no horse or ass be by his side;
Under water men shall walk,
Shall ride, shall creep, shall talk;
In the air men shall be seen.
In white, in black, in greem.
Iron in the water shall float
As easy as a wooden boat;
Gold shall be found 'mid stones
In a land that's not now known;
Fire and water shall wonders do;
England shall at last admit a Jew;
The Jew that was held in scorn
Shall of a .Christian be borne and born.
Three times three shall lovely France
Be led to dance a bloody dance
Before her people shall be free;
Three tyrant rulers shall she see;
Three timps the people rule alone;
Three times the people's hope is gone:
Three rulers in succession see
Each spring from different dynasty.
Then shall the worser fight be done,
England and France shall be as one.
All England's sons that plow the land
Shall be seen, book in hand.
V Learning shn.ll so ebb and flow
The poor shall most wisdom know.
The world to an end shall come
In eighteen hundred and eighty-one.

NATION ri?es from infancy to manhood and sinks from dotage to
M death.
Xl I think that the gret>t republic is in the morning of her life- the
/ sun just abuse the horiicn â the gras^ stili wet with dew.
Our country has the courage and enthusiasm of youthâ her blood
flows fullâ her heart beats strong and her brow is fair. We stand on the
threshold of a great, a sublime career. All the conditions are favorableâ the
environment kind.
The best part of this hemisphere is ours. We have a thousand million
acres of fertile land, vast forests, whole States underlaid with cool ranges of
mountains filled with iron, silver and gold, and we have seventy-five mil
lions of the most energetic, active, inventive, progressive and practical peo
ple in the world.
The great republic is a happy combination of mind and muscle, of head
and heart, of courage and good nature.
We are growing. We have the instinct of expansion. We are full of life
and health. We are about to take our rightful place at the 'head of the
nations. The great powers have been struggling to obtain markets. They
are fighting for the trade of the East. Th> y are â < mending for China. We
watched but we did not act. They paid no attention to us or we to them.
Conditions have changed. We own the Hawaiian Inlands. We will own the
Philippines. Japan and China will be our neighborsâ our customers, uur
interests must be protected. In China we want the "open door," and we wil
see to it that the door is kept open.
ThÂ«> nation that tries to shut it will get its fingers pinched. We have
taught the Old World that the republic must be consulted.
We have entered on the great highway and we are destined to become
th^ most powerful, the most successful and the most generous of nations.
I am for expansion. The more people beneath the flag the better.
Let the republic grow.

FOREIGN critic? say Americans boast of the bigness of their country.
There is no us^ denying the fact; we are big. We are not too large
fnr a destiny never so manifest as to-day. Cuba is under our protec
tion and certain to come under our flag by the vote of her people;
Port.. Rico Is ours; our foothold in the Philippines will never be sur
rendered, and the markets of the Far East are inviting us to compete with
the nations of Europe for their trade. Big as we are, the future is bigger
with duties, responsibilities and opportunities for our citizens.
The people of Cuba are assured by us of liberty and law. This richest of
Islands and of countries under the inspiration of peace and the opportuni
ties of liberty will attract from our shores tens of thousands of indus
trious and energetic citizens. It will become a paradise of happy homes
and Increase enormously in population and wealth. Whether it continues
lndepend mt under our protectorate or comes, as I believe it will and must
by the .vote of its r-itizens, under our flag, instead of being a burden, it
will mightily enrich our country, and furnish a market for the surplus of
our farms and our factories. Porto Rico also with its splendid climate
and rich soil is destined to iuvite from our country our people and our
products.
The responsibility of governing these countries and the Philippines is
nrreat, but the policy of governing them by recognizing the manhood of their
peoples has never been tried. Louisiana was a different problem from the
sent because of the sparse population, though Florida was not much
different with its Spanish peoples. The territories of Louisiana and Florida
have become great, rich and growing States. American institutions have
adjusted themselves to the government of Alaska, so that h^r people are
happy, and each year her product is many fold greater than her cost.

THE prospect for the consummation of the treaty between the United
f-tates and Spain is >nly fair at this writing, notwithstanding a loud
cry from the Eastern States against imperialism and expansion,
coupled with the fears made public of many statesi en that we arÂ«
leaving a safe anchorage for uncertain and probably boisterous seas,
.he people of the land appear to me to have arrived at some permanent con
victions.
Firs' âThat Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines should not and will not
be given back to Spain. Good men say that the Spanish Government, as
exhibited In her colonies, has been heaping upon her iniquities in the form
of avarice, cruelty, extortion and murder, till the measure is full to the over
flowing, and that for Spain the beginning of the end is upon her domain and
rule.
Second â That the revolt In the Phlppines against Spain's inhumanity and
(â¢elfish policy has been as pronounced though. not so long existing a-.; in Cuba.
The feeling among us is that when we were struggling in the darkest hours
of our revolution against the strong arm of the British King it was alto
gether right and noble for Lafayette to bring his means and his men to help
end the long conflict at Yorktown. So has it been altogether right and noble
for Columbia to intervene and aid the Cubans, i. c., the inhabitants proper
of Cuba, to gain their freedom and inaugurate 'a stable government."
The Philippines ha\*e come to us as an Incident of war, but their case is
In principle precisely the same as that of Cuba. True, they are farther off
from our shores, yet in these days of swift navigation and speedy communi
cation distance is of little importance.
The basal principle of our republic and of every true republic is that
the governed shall have a voice in the Government. In fact the germ thought
goes further; it is that the people shall govern themselves. Our strong de
eire is that in some way the Philippines shall exercise this self-gov
ernment. The news of it had found its way to the poorest of their inhabi
tants long before Admiral Dewey 'n-oke the Spanish power in that quar
ter of tl "We want a government, a free government, like that
of the United States." They rose in arms to resist tyranny for that. They
sought alliance with Dewey and M^rrttt for that, and it is altogether possible
for our Columbia t<< give them a sufficient protectorate to sccurf this boon
to all the Inhabitants of those Islands and make them a blessing to them
selves and contributors to the prosperity of other nations, from which pros
perity we snail naturally reap the first commercial advantage.

FROM thp day whf>n the early settlers landed on the Atlantic coast the
idea of territorial extension has been a pervading and dominant one.
The early settlers soon began to push out into the wilderness, into the
forest and â¢ ver the mountains, so that when the thirteen original ?tates
became a nation they occupied a very considerable body of land reach-
Ing from tho Atlantic well out to the Ohio River. Then came the session
to the General Government of the Northwest Territory, lying between the
Ohio and Mississippi Rivers; then came the great Louisiana purchase, car
rying tho western border to tho Rocky Mountains; then the annexation of
Texas, the acquisition of torritory from Mexico, carrying our borders
across the mountains to the Pacific shore. In 1567 we purchased Alaska,
and in IS9S we have annexed Hawaii, and taken under our control Perro
Rico and the Philippine blonds. There Is nothing more striking in our
national history than this rapid, almost uninterrupted, territorial expan
sion. Considering its extent, its resources, its varied climates, its oceans,
lakes, rivers, plains and mountains, we have the most magnificent empire
under the sun.

all our citizens, regardless of race, free men, entitled to all the rights and
privileges and immunities of American citizenship. This is the ideal to
which we are committed. This is the standard by whnch we shall be Judged.
This is the loal toward which we are tending. We have not yet reached
it, and the national conscience should be raised to such a degree that it
will not tolerate anywhere within the limits of the republic any violation
of its fundamental conceptions of civil liberty.
We have not yet attained to absolute separation of church and state,
and there are multitudes of our citizens who have a very vague and un
certain notion of *he meaning of religious liberty. This anomaly should

THE United States, many say, has not the right to acquire the Philip
pines and Cuba for the sake of expansion, and even further, that now
that we really have them we do not know how to handle them, else a
we establish an imperial government. This was not the view taken ?
by the President or the people who desired war in the name of human- <
ity. We have been criticized in the columns of our own press for taking pos- j
session of the Philippines. The United States weas criticized for taking
Louisiana. History but repeats itself to-day. The Louisiana deal was j
primarily protection. "You manage your own affairs in your own way," we \
said, "and we'll protect you."
I see no reason why it should be said that we took Cuba for ourselves
when one considers our actions in the matter. We conquered the Philip
pines, true! For ourselves? No; for the sake of liberty and humanity. I
want to see the United States protect these new possessions not only against
the enemies without, but also the insurrection and anarchy within. Why :
should not the United States protect them? Why should we not say to the
other nations, "Hands off: An attack on them is an attack on us. Keep
away. Give them a fair chance and they will govern themselves." And
when in time liberty has become a fact with these, our new possessions, \
when they are able to manage themselves and their affairs and their diffi
culties, I would then say to them. "Govern yourselves! Be independent!
Paddle your own canoe:" But not until they have recovered from the
strain of monarchial rule â not until they have recovered from the devasta
tions of war and the discontent of anarchy will they be able to be independ
ent of the protection we so generously offer them.

â  I have reached a critical period in our policy of territorial expan
1 I f sum. With the acquisition of new territory the- question of govern
\J^J ment must be considered. In our original thirteen States the ques- '
tion arose as to the government of outside territories. Seven States
claimed territory to the Mississippi. Six States had no outlying ter
ritories. Maryland refused to enter the confederation unless some under
standing was had with regard to the government of these territories. It
was finally agreed to cede the territories to the central government,
though Georgia did not cede hers for fourteen years.
Although Indian Territory, the District of Columbia and Alaska are gov
erned outside the constitution, I believe that the principles of that consti
tution are broad enough and expansive enough to rover schemes of gav
ernment in our newly acquired possessions. Ido not agree with Dr. Park
hurst that when the Spanish fleet at Manila was blown up the constitu
tion of the United States was blown up also.
My only fear is that the principles of the constitution may not be car
ried into the new territory. My idea Is, not that the Philippines should be
put in charge of either army or navy, but that there should be a school of
colonial service from which to sen i out trained Governors rather than
broken down politicians.
I find our constitution sufficiently broad to permit us to govern all our
pr-ople with the same wisdom and the same grandeur as Great Britain gov
erci hers, for I know that we ;>.re wise enough to provide for our new people
a government that will be for them a boon and for us a power.
We cannot at once give self-government to these people, but we can
have a trained force to govern them. The basis of our system of govern
n-ent Is the consent of the governed, and we must not depart from this
dectrine.
Other nations send out educated gentlemen as Consuls, while we send
out good for nothing politicians. The solution of the difficulty lies in train
ing a colonial service just as we train an army or a nayy â for a purpose.
When we find a people not yet fit to govern themselves we can have a
government like that of Alaska or the District of Columbia or the Indian
Territory.

.Horatio Stebbins, D. D.
SHIS war of ours with Spain was a little war, but its results have been
great and far reaching. It was a victory over a declining power
which has never established and maintained a successful colony. For
over four centuries Spain has cursed every foot of land on which she
has set her rule. The war has opened up new questionsâ new relations "of
the world and of mankind.
One great moral victory and result of the war has been the wiping out
of the prejudice and the passions which have ruled between the North and
South. It is the finger of Providence in the affairs of nations. The conflict
between the North and the South was "the irrepressible conflict."
But in the new America there is not any North nor any South. It Is a
great moral achievement.
The quarrel between England and America lasted for over a century.
But now prejudices are wearing out. We have been more touchy toward
England than she has been toward us. But we are getting over that, and
we find that we have one race which dominates the conditions of the earth.
We are on the verge of a repartition of the nations of the world.
Victory has entailed upon us great responsibilities, but I have a mighty
confidence that if we go forward the way will be opened out for us. We are '
called to take a new part in shaping the destinies of mankind, but I feel
about It as the ancient prophet did, "Fear not, for I am with thee."

Frank, .Newlands.
WITHIN the last century our country has expanded to a phenomenal
extent. From 800,000 square miles it has grown to 3,600,000,
â without considering our new acquisitions. Thus we have grown five
times in size as the result of war, diplomatic action and partly by
accident. The last few months have added greatly to our growth.
We have taken Porto Rico for good. We have taken Cuba for the purpose
of establishing a stable government there. This will ultimately result In the
absorption of that island by the United States. Hawaii has been taken and
practically we have taken the Philippinesâ l74o islands in number, with a
population of 9,000,000 souls.
The scheme of our growth has involved the necessity for the acquisition
of contiguous islands. We need. the Bahamas and the West Indies, because
they block the way to the Nicaragua canal, which will some day be built.
The acquisition of Cuba and Porto Rico fit well in our scheme of growth.
The acquisition of Hawaii tends to isolate us and to give us an outpost es
sential in our defensive line.
Asia is the field of conquest, and any attack aimed at us will be directed
against our Pacific Coast; and no attack could be successful without a
mid-Pacific coaling base. However, the acquisition of the Philippines is
hardly in line with our scheme of growth, for, whereas Hawaii means ter
ritorial defense, the Philippines mean conquest and colonial expansion.
I believe that this country's growth should be internal rather than ex
ternal. We have one-half the railroad mileage of the world; we produce
one-third of the steel, one-half the ~oal. nearly a quarter of the wheat, ten
thirteenths of all the cotton and four-fifths of the corn; while, judged by our
consuming capacity. 500,000 Americans are equal to all the 9,000,000 inhabi
tants of the Phelippines.
If we want to extend our field, let us extend it to the south, where these
so-called republics are disgracing civilization. If we tell England and Ger
many that they must not enter that territory, even though their coming
would bring stability of government, we must exercise some guardianship
ourselves.

dred and Winifred were, in a pecuniary
point of view, the most serious burden
on the family purse. For both were
pretty girls, gay and fond of society,
given to paying frequent visits in town
find country, and, in consequence, need
ing many frocks and a considerable
supply of downright hard cash. But
everybody was very comfortable: only
it was understood that at a period gen
erally referred to as "some day there
would be very little for anybody except
the eldest son. "Some day" meant, or
course when Mr. Petheram reluctant
ly died, and thereby brought his fam
ily into less favorable worldly circum
stances.
From this brief summary of the fam
ily's position the duty of Mildred and
Winifred (and, in course of time, of the
two girls in the schoolroom also) stands
forth salient and unmistakable. Mil
dred performed it promptly at the age
of 19 years. He was the second son
of a baronet, and his elder brother was
Bickly and unmarried; but, like a wise
young man. he took no chances, went
on the Stock Exchange and became ex
ceedingly well to do in an exceedingly
brief space â â¢:' -something, in fact,
"came off" in South Africa, and when
that happens ordinary limits of time
find probability are suspended. So with
Mildred all was very well; and it was
odds that one of the boys would be
provided for by his brother-in-law.
Winifred had just as good chances
nay, better; for her sensitive face and
wondering eyes had an attraction that
Mildred's self-possessed good looks
could not exert. But Winifred shilly
shallied (it was her father's confiden
tial after-dinner word) till she was 21,
then refused Sir Barton Arnesbury, in
Itself a step of doubtful sanity, as was
generally observed), and engaged her
p. If to Howard Jackson, who made one
thousand a year, and had no prospects
except the doubtful one of maintain
ing his income at that levelâ unless,
that is, he turned out a genius, when
it was even betting whether a man*
sion or the workhouse awaited him; for
that depends on the variety of genius.
Having taken this amazing course,
Winifred was resolute and radiantly
happy; her relatives, after the neces
sary amount of argument, shrugged
their shouldersâ the very inadequate
ultima ratio to which a softening civil
ization seems to have reduced relatives
In such cases.
"I can manage $1500 a year for her
while I live." said Mr. Petheram, wip
ing his brow and then dusting his
boots; he was just back from his ride,
"After that"â
"The insurance, my dear?" Mrs.
Petheram suggested. But her husband
shook his head; that little discrepancy
above noted, between five and six thou
sand a year, had before this caused the
insurance to' be a very badly broken
reed.
Harold Jacksonâ for in him the ex
planation of Winifred's action must be
soughtâ was tall, Rood looking, ready
of speech and decidedly agreeable.
There was no aggressiveness about
him, and his quiet manners repelled
any suspicion of bumptiousness. But
it cannot be denied that to him "Win.
lfred's action did. not seem extraordi
nary; he himself accounted for this by
saying that she, like himself, was an
Idealist, the boys by saying that he was
"stuck up." Mr. Petheram, by a fret
ful exclamation, that in all worldly mat
ters he was as blind as a new-born
puppy. Whatever the truth of these
respective theories, he was as con
vinced that Winifred had chosen for
her own happiness, as that she had
given him his. And in this she most
fully agreed. Of course, then, all the
shrugging of shoulders in the universe
could not affect the radiant content
ment of the lovers, nor could it avert
the swift passage of months which
soon brought the wedding. day in sight,
and made preparations for it urgent

matched to a shade with her gown, and
mounted into the small dogcart which
Jennie, the new chestnut mare, was to
draw to the station. A letter had
come from Harold to say that, after
a long search, he had found a house
which would suit them, and was only

maximum sum they had decided to give

not seem quite as remote as it used, and pretty Winnie-well, there
was no use in crying over it now. Willful girls must have their way,
and It was not his fault that confounded agitators had played the
deuce with the landed interest. The matter passed from his thoughts
as_he began to notice how satisfactorily Jennie moved.
Winifred's lover met her in London, and found her eyes still
bright from the reveries of her Journey. To-day was a gala dayâ
they drove off in a hansom to a smart restaurant in Piccadilly, jok
ing about their extravagance. Everything was perfect to Winifred,
except (a small exception, surely!) that Harold failed to praise,
seemed almost not to notice, the gray costume; it must have been
that he looked at her face only!
"It's not a large house, you know," he said at lunch., smiling at
her over a glass of Graves.
"Well, I shan't be wanting to get away from you," she answered
smiling. "Not very far, Harold."
"Are your people still abusing me?"
He put the question with a laugh.
"They never abused you. only me." Then came the irrepressible
question: "Do you like my new frock? I put Jt on on purpose â for
the house, you know."
"Our home," he murmured, rather sentimentally. It must be con

and so up to Oxford street. Here they bore considerably to the east,
then plunged north again and drove through one or two long streets.
Harold, who had made the journey before, paid no heed to the route,
but talked freely delightful hours which they were to enjoy to
gether, of books to read and thoughts to think, and of an intimate
sympathy which, near as they were already to one another, the home
and the home life alone could enable them fully to realize. Wini
fred listened, but far down in her mind now was another question
hardly easier to stifle than that about the frock. "Where are we go
ing to?" would have b. j en its naked form, but she yielded no more to
her impulse than to look about her and mark and wonder. At last
they turned up a sharp twist from a long, narrow street into a short,
narrower street, where a wagon by the curbstone forced the cab to a
walk, and shrill boys were playing an unintelligible, noisy game.
"What queer places we pass through!" she cried with a laugh, as
she laid her hand on his arm and turned her face to his.
"Pass through: We're at home," he answered, returning her
laugh. "At home, Winnie!" He pointed at a house on the right
hand side, and immediately after the cab stopped. Winifred got
out, holding her skirt back from contact with the wheel. Harold, in
his eagerness to ring the doorbell, had forgotten to render her this
service. She stood on the pavement for a moment looking about her.
One of the boys cried: "Crickey, there's a swell!" and she liked the
boy for it. Then she turned to the house.
"It wants a lick of paint," said Harold cheerfully as he rang the
bell again.
"It certainly does," she admitted looking up at the dirty walls.
An old woman opened the door; she might be said, by way of
metaphor, to need the same process as the walls; a very narrow
passage was disclosed behind her.

"â Welcome!" said Harold, giving Winifred his hand and then pre
senting her to the old woman. "This is my future wife," he ex
plained. â¢'We've come to look at the house. But we won't bother
you, Mrs. Elhlgett, we'd rather run over it by ourselves. We shall
enjoy that, shan't we, Winnie?"
Winnie's answer was a little scream and a hasty clutch at her
gown; a pall of dirty water, standing in the passage, had threatened
ruin; she recoiled violently from this peril against the opposite wall
and drew away again, silently exhibiting a long trail of dark dust
on her new gray frock. Harold laughed as he led the way Into a
small, square room that opened from the passage.
"That's the parlor," said the old woman, wiping her arms with
her apron. "You can find your way upstairs; nothing's locked." And
with thia remark she withdrew by a steep staircase leading under
ground.
"She's the caretaker," Harold explained.
"She doesn't seem to have taken much care," observed Winifred,
still indignant about her gown and holding it round her as closely as
drapery clings to an antique statue.
Miss Petheram's account of the house, Its actual dimensions, ac
commodation and characteristics, has always been very vague,' and
since she refused information as to its number in the street, verifica
tion of these details has remained Impossible. Perhaps it was a rea
sonably capacious, although doubtless not extensive, dwelling; per
haps, again, it was a confined a_nd well-nigh stifling den. She re
membered two things â first, its all-pervading dirt; secondly, the re
markable quality which (as she alleged) distinguished its atmos

arrived at (after discussion) as a compromise between "rooms" and
"pens," and she knew that the windows of each of these enclosures
were commanded by the windows of several other apparently similar
and very neighboring enclosures. Beyond this she could give no
account of her first half hour in the house; her exact recollection
began when she was left alone in the enclosure on the first floor
which Harold asserted to be the drawing room Harold himself hav
ing gone down stairs to seek the old woman and elicit from her
Borne information as to what were and were not tenant's fixtures in
the said enclosure. "You can look about you," he remarked cheerful
ly as he left her, "and make up your mind where you're going to have
your favorite seat. Then you shall tell me, and I shall have the
picture of you sitting there in my mind." He pointed to a wooden
chair, the only one then in the room. "Experiment with that chair,"
he added laughing. "I won't be long, darling."
Mechanically, without considering things which she obviously
ought to have considered, Winifred sank Jnto the designated seat, laid
her parasol on a small table, and leant her elbows on the same piece
of furniture as she held her face between her gloved hands. The at
mosphere again asserted its peculiar quality; she rose for a moment
and opened the window; fresh air was gained at the expense of
spoiled gloves, and was weighted with the drawbacks of a baby s
cries and an inquisitive woman's stare from over the way. Shut
ting the window again, she returned to her chairâ the symbol of
what was to be her favorite seat in days to come, her chosen cor
ner In the house which had been the subject of so many talks and
bo many dreanfs. There were a great many flies in the room; the
noise of adjacent humanity in street and houses was miscellaneous
and penetrating; the air was very close. And this house was rather
more expensive than their calculations had n.llowpd. They had im
mensely enjoyed making those calculations down there in the country^
under the old yew hedge, and in sight of the flower beds beneath the
library window. She remembered the day they did it. There was a
cricket match in the meadow. Mildred and her husband brousrht the
drag over and Sir Barton came in his tandem. It was almost too
hot in the sun, but simply delightful in the shade. She and Harold
had had great fun over mapping out their $2500 a year and proving
how much might be done with it â at least compared with anything
they could want once they had the great thing that they wanted.
The vision vanished; she was back in the dirty little room again;
she caught up her parasol; a streak across the dust marked where
it had lain on the table; she sprang up and twisted her frock round,
craning her neck back; ah, that she had reconnoitered that chair.
She looked at her gloves; then with a cry of horror she dived for her
handkerchief, put it to her lips, and scrubbed her cheeks; the hand
kerchief came away soiled, dingy, almost black. This last outrage
overcame her; the parasol dropped on the floor, she rested her arms
on the table and laid her face on them, and she burst into sobs,
just as she used to in childhood when her brothers crumpled a clean
frock or somebody spoke to her roughly. And between her sobs she
cried almost loudly, very bitterly: "Oh, it's too mean and dirty and
horrid!"
Harold had stolen softly upstairs, meaning to surprise the girl
he loved, perhaps to let a snatched kiss be her first knowledge of his
return. He flushed red, and his lips set sternly; he walked across
the room to her with a heavy tread. She looked up, saw him, and

knew that her exclamation had been overheard.
"What in the world is the matter?" he asked in a tone of cold sur
prise.
It was very absurd â she couldn't stop crying; and from amid her
weeping nothing more reasonable, nothing more adequate, nothing
less trivial would come than confused murmurs of "My frock, Har
old!" "My parasol!" "O, my face, my gloves!" He smiled contemptu
ously. "Don't you see?"- she exclaimed, exhibiting the gloves and
parasol.
"She what. Are you crying because the room's dirty?" He
paused and then added, "I'm sorry you think it mean and horrid.
Very sorry, Winifred."
Offense was deep and bitter in his voice; he looked at her with a
sort of disgust; she stopped sobbing and regarded him with a gaze
in which fright and expectation semed mingled, as though there were
a great peril and just one thing that might narrowly avert it. But
his eyes were very hard. She dried her tears and then forlornly
6crul bed her cheeks again. He watched her with hostile curiosity,
appearing to think her a very strange spectacle. Presently he spoke.
"I thought you loved me. O, I daresay you thought so, too, till I
came into competition with your new frock. I beg pardon â I
must add your gloves and your parasol. As for the house, it's no
doubt mean and horrid; we were going to be poor, you see." He
laughed scornfully, as he added, "You might even have had to do a
little dusting yourself now and then! Horrible!"
"I Just sat there and looked at him." That was Winifred's own
account of her behavior. It is not very explicit, and leaves room for
much conjecture as to what her look said or tried to say. But what
By Brer Harte
ever the message was he did not read it. .-c was engrossed in his
own indignation, readier to hurt than to understand, full of his own
wrong, of the mistake he had made, of her extraordinary want of love,
of courage, of the high soul. Very likely all this was a natural
enough state of mind for him to be In. Justice admits his provoca
tion; the triviality of her spoken excuses gave his anger only too fine
an opportunity. He easily persuaded himself that there was a reve
lation of the real woman, a flash of light that showed her true na
ture, showing, too, the folly of his delusion about her. Against all
this her look and what it asked for had very little chance, and she
gould find no words that did not aggravate her offense.
"This is really rather a ludicrous scene," he went on. "Is there
any use in prolonging it?" He waited for her to speak, but she was
still tongue-tied. "The caretaker needn't be distressed by seeing the
awful effects of her omission to dust the room, but if you're com
posed enough, we might as well go." He looked around the room.
"You'll be glad to be out of this," he ended.
"1 know what you must think of me," she burst out, "butâ but
you don't understand â you don't see â "
"No doubt I'm stupid, but I confess I don't. At least there's only
one thing I see." He bowed and waved his hand toward the door.
"Shall we go?" he asked.
She led the way down stairs, her skirt again held close and raised
clear of her ankles. Her care for it was not lost on Harold as he fol
lowed her, for she heard him laugh again with an obtrusive bitterness
that made his mirth a taunt. The old caretaker waited for them In
the passage.
"When'll you be coming, sir?" she asked.
"I don't know. It's not certain we shall come," said he. "The
lady is not much taken with the house."
"Ah, well!" sighed the old woman resignedly.
For an account of their drive back to the station materials are
again sadly wanting. "He hardly said a word, and I did nothing but
try to get my face clean and my gloves presentable," was Winifred's
history of the Journey. But she rememberedâ or chose to relateâ a
little more of what passed while they waited for the train on the
platform at Euston. He left her for a few minutes on pretext of
smoking a cigarette, and she saw him walking up and down, ap
parently In thought. Then he came back and sat down beside her.
His manner was grave now; to judge by his recorded words, perhaps
it was even a little pompous; but when may young men be pompous
If not at such crises as these?
"It's no use pretending that nothing has happened, Winifred." he
said. "That would be the hollowest pretense, not worthy, I think
of either of us. Perhaps we had better take time to consider our
course andâ cr â our relations to each other."
"You don't want to marry me now?" she asked simply.
"I want to do what is best for our happiness," he replied "We
cannot forget what has happened to-day."
"I know you would never forget it," she said.
He did not contradict her; he looked first at his watch, then
along the platform for the approach of her train. To admit that
he might forget it was impossible to him; in such a case forgetful
ness would be a negation of his principles and a slur on his percep
tion. It would also be such a triumph over his vanity and his prida
as it did not lie in him to achieve, such a forgiveness as his faults
and virtues combined to put beyond tho
power of his nature. She looked at
him, and "I smiled," she said, not
seeming herself to know why she had
smiled, but conscious that, in the midst
of her woe, some subtly amusing
thought about him had come into her
mind. She had never been amused at
him before; so she, too, was getting
some glimmer of a revelation out of
the day's experience â not the awful
blaze of light that had flashed on Har
old's eyes, but a dim ray, just enough
to give cause to that puzzled smile fop
which she could not explicitly account.
So they parted, and for persons who
have followed the affair at all closely
It is hardly necessary to add that they
never came together again. This is
sue was obvious, and Winifred seems
to have made up her mind to it that
very same evening, for she called her
mother Into her room (as the good lady
passed on the way to bed), and looked
up from the task of brushing the gray
frock which she had spread out on the
"Well, or words to that effect," said
I. "That when he did all this and saw
all this, you know, he loved you more,
and knew that you loved him more
than he had dared to dream, with a
deeper love, a love that gave up for
him all that you loved next best and
second only to him; that after seeing
your tears he would never doubt again
that you would face all trials and all
troubles with him at your side. Don't
you think if he'd said something of
that kind, accompanying his words
with the appropriate actions" I
"Well?" asked Winifred.
"Don't you think you might have

now instead of being about to con
tract an alliance with Sir Barton Amea
"How do you know I shall do that?"
"It needs," I observed modestly, "lit
tle skill to discern the approach of the
Inevitable." I looked at her thought
ful face and at her eyes; they had
their old look of "wondering in them.'
"Don't you think that, if he'd treated
the situation in that way?" I ask^d.
"Perhaps," she said softly. "But he
wouldn't think of all that. He was
such an idealist."
I really do not know why she an
plied that term to him at that moment
except that he used to apply it to him
self at many moments. But since It seemed to her to explain hia
conduct there's no need to auarrel with the epithet.
"And I hope," said I, "that Hie gray frock wasn't irretrievably
ruined?"
"I've never worn it again," she murmured.
So I suppose it was ruinedâ unless she has some other reason.
But she would be right to treat it differently from other frocks; it
must mean a good deal to her, although It failed to mean anything
except its own pretty self to Mr. Jackson.

"I don't think I shall marry Mr.
Jackson, now, mother," she said.
Mrs. Petheram looked at her daugh
ter and at her daughter's gown.
"You'd better tell me more about it
to-morrow. You look tired to-night,
dear," she replied.
But Winifred never told her any
more â in the first place, because the
family -was too delighted with the fact
to care one straw about how it hail
come to pass, and, in the second place,
on the more important ground that the
thing was really too small, too trivial,
and too absurd to bear telling â at least
to the family. To me, for some rea
son or other, Winifred did tell it, <>r
some of it, enough, anyhow, to enable
me with the help of a few touches <.f
imagination to conjecture how it oc
curred.
"Don't you think it was very ab
surd?" she asked at the end of h<-r
story. We were sitting by the yew
hedge, near the library windows, look-
Ing across the flower beds to the
meadow; it was a beautiful day, and
the old place was charming. "Because ."
Bhe added. "I did love him, you know;
and it seems a small thing to separate
about, doesn't it?"
"If he had behaved differently"â I
began.
"I don't see how he could be expected
to," she murmured.
"You expected him to," I said firmly.
She turned to me with an appearance
of interest, as though I might be able
to interpret to her something that had
been causing her puzzle. "Or you
wouldn't have looked at him aa you
say you did â or smiled at him, as you
admit you did. But you were wrong
to expect him to, because he's not that
kind of a man."
"What kind of a man?"
"The kind of man to catch you in
his arms, smother you in kisses (allow
me the old phrase), tell you that ha
understood all you felt, knew all you
were giving: up, realized the great thing
you were doing for him."
Winifred was listening. I -went on
with my imaginary scene of romantio
fervor.
"That when he contrasted that mean

accustomed to, with the beauties which,
were right and â¢"roper for you, when

little.I m E "ere four In the patio. And the patio was magnificent.
1 / ? vith a terrace of marble running round its four sides, and
1 Iâ¢/ ' n the mid<ile a fountain splashing in &. marble basin. I
-will not swear to the marble; for I was a boy of ten at
the time, and that is a long while ago. But I describe as
I recollect. It was a magnificent patio, at all events, and
the house way a palace. And who the owner might be, Felipe per
haps knew. i:ut he was not one to tell, and the rest of us neither
Knew nor cared.
The two women lay stretched on the terrace, with their heads
Close together and resting against the house wall. And I sat beside
them gnawing a bone. The sun shone over the low eastern wall upon
the fountain and upon Felipe perched upon the rim of the basin,
witn his lame leg stuck straight and his mouth working as he
rastened a nail in the end of his beggar's crutch.
I cannot tell you the hour exactly, but it was early morning, and
tne date the 24th of February, 1671. I learned this later. We in the
paiio aid not bother ourselves about the date, for the world had come
t? ff n v. c aml we were the last four left in it. For three weeks we
nad been playing hide-and-seek with the death that had caught and
swallowed every one else; and for the moment it was quite enough
ror the women to sleep, for me to gnaw my bone in the shade, and
ror Felipe to fasten the loose nail in his crutch. Many windows opened
on tha patio. Through the nearest, by turning my head a little. I
could see into a noble room lined with pictures and heaped with
turniture and turn hangings. All of it was ours, or might be, for
ru^i 1 c of ste PP in < Inside and taking possession. But the bona
U had killed a dog for it) was a juicy one, and I felt no inclination
to stir. There was the risk, too, of infectionâ of tht- plague.
â¢"Hullo!" cried Felipe, slipping on his shoe, with the heel of which
he had been hammering. "You awake?"
I put Felipe last of us in order, for he was an old fool. Yet I
must say that we owed our lives to him. Why he took so much
trouble and spent so much ingenuity in saving them is not to be
guessed; for the whole city of Panama comprehended no two lives
more worthless than old Dona Teresa's (as we called her) and mine;
and as for the Carmelite, Sister Marta, who had joined our ad
ventures two days before, she, poor soul, would have thanked him
for putting a knife into her and ending her shame.
But Felipe, though a fool, had a fine sense of irony. And so for
three weeks Dona Teresa and Iâ and for forty-eight hours Sister
Marta tooâ had been lurking and doubling, squatting in cellars, crawl
ing on roofs, breaking cover at night to snatch our food, all under
Felipe's generaiship. And he had carried us through. Perhaps he
had a soft corner in his heart for old Teresa. He and she were just
f an age, the two most careless-hearted outcasts in Panama; and
knew each other's peccadilloes to a hair. I went with Teresa. Heaven
knows in what gutter she had first picked me up. but for professional
ends I was her starving grandchild, and now reaped the advantages
: ;hat dishonoring fiction.
"How can a gentleman sleep for your thrice-accursed hammer
ing?" was my answer to Felipe Fill-the-Bag.
"The city is very still this morning," he observed, sniffing the air,
which was laden still with the scent of burnt cedar wood. "The
English dogs will have turned their backs on us for good. I heard
their bugles at daybreak; since them, nothing."
"These are fair quarters, for a change."
He grinned. "They seem to suit the lady, your grandmother.
She has not groaned for three hours. I infer that her illustrious
sciatica is no longer troubling her."
Our chatter awoke the Carmolite. She opened her eyes, unclasp?d
her hand, which had been locked round one of the old hag's, and
Dp blinking, with a smile which died away very pitiably.
"Good morning, Senorita," said I.
She bent over Teresa, but suddenly drew back with a little "Ah!"
and stared, holding her breath.
"What is the matter?"
She was on her knees, now; and putting out a hand, touched
Teresa's skinny neck with the tips of two lingers.
"What is the matter?" echoed Felipe, coming forward from the
fountain.
"She is dead!" said I, dropping the hand which I had lifted.
"Jesu " began the Carmelite, and stopped; and we stared at
cne another, all three.
With her eyes wide and fastened on mine. Sister Marta felt for
the crucifix and rope of beads which usually hung from her waist.
It was gone; but her hands fumbled for quite a minute before ihe
loss came home to her brain. And then she removed her face from
us and bent her forehead to the pavement. She made no sound, but
I saw her feet writhing.
"Come, com"," said Felipe, and found no more to say.
I can guess now a little of what was passing through her un
happy mind. Women are women, and understand one another. And
Teresa, unclf-an and abandoned old hulk though she was, had stood
by this girl when she came to us, flying out of the wrack like a lost
ship. "Dear, dear, dear" â I remembered scraps of her talk â "tl.e
good Lord is debonair, and knows all about these things. He isn't
like a man, as you might say"; and again, "Why bless you, He's
not going to condemn you for a matter that I could explain in five
minutes. 'If it ccmes to that,' I should say â and I've often'noticed
that a real gentleman likes you all the better for sp.eaking upâ 'lf
It comes to that, Lord, why did You put such bloody-minded pirates
Into the world?' New to my thinking"â and I remember her rolling
a leaf of tobacco as she said it â "it's a great \:\>\>.. jwrncnt to the
miml to h.'ive been through the battle, whether you have won or
lost; and that's why, when on earth, He chose the likes of us for
company."
This philosophy was not the sort to convince a religious girl; but
I believe it comforted her. Women are women, p as I said; and when
the ship goes down a rotten plank is better than none. So the
Carmelite had dropped asleep last night with her hand locked round
Teresa's; and so it happened to Teresa this morning to be lamented.,
and sincerely lamented, by one of the devout. It was alirost an
edifying end; and the prospect of it, a few days ago, would have
tickled her hugely.
"But what did she die of?" I asked Felipe, when we had in deli
l eacy withdrawn to the fountain, leaving the Carmelite alone with
her grief.
He opened his mouth and pointed a finger at it.
"But only last evening I offered to share my bone with her; and
ehe told me to keep it for myself."
"Your excellency does not reason so well as usual," said Felipe,
without a smile on his face. "The illustrious defunct had a gnat
affection for her grandchild, which caused her to overlook the am
biguity of the relationship â and other things."
"But do you mean to say "
"She was a personage of great force of character, and of some
virtues which escaped recognition, being unusual. I pray," said he,
lifting the rim of his rusty hat, "that her soul may find the last
peace! I had the honor to follow her career almost from the be
ginning. I remember her even as a damsel of a very rare beauty;
but even then, as I say, her virtues were unusual, and less easily
detected than her failings. I, for example, who supposed myself to
know her thoroughly, missed reckoning upon her courage, or I had
epent last night in seeking food. I am a fool and a pig."
"And consequently, while we slept "
"Excuse me; I have not slept."
"You have been keeping watch?"
"Not for the buccaneers, my Lord. They left before daybreak.
Put the dogs of the city are starving, even as we; and like us they
have taken to hunting in company. Now this is a handsome court
yard, but the gate does not happen to be too secure.
I shivered. Folipe watched me with an amiable grin.
"Are we three the only souls in Panama?"
Felipe rubbed his chin. "I think there is one other. But he is a
philosopher, and despises purple and linen. We who value them,
within reason, could desire no better subject." He arose and treated
me to a regal bow. "Shall we inspect our legacy, my brother, and
make arrangements for the coronation?"
"We might pick up something to eat on the way," said I.
Felipe hobbled over to the terrace. "Poor old "he muttered,
touching the corpse with his staff, and dwelling on the vile word
With pondering affection. "Senorita," said he aloud, "much grief is
not good on an empty stomach. If Juan here will lift her feet "
We carried Dona Teresa into the large cool room, and laid her
on a couch. Felipe tore down the silken hangings from one of the
windows and spread them over .her to her chin, which he tied up
the yellow kerchief which h^d been her only headgear for years.
nThe Carmelite meanwhile detached two heavy silver sconces from a
great candelabrum and set them by her feet. But we could find no
tinder-box to light the candlesâ big enough for an altar.
"She will do handsomely until evening," said Felipe, and added
under his breath, "But we must contrive to fasten the gate of the
, patio."
"I will watch by her," naid Sister Marta.
Felipe glanced at us and shook his head. I knew he was thinking
( f the dogs. "That would not do at all, Senorita. 'For the living,
the living," as they say. If we live, we will return this evening nnd
attend to her; but while my poor head remains clear (and Heaven

I confess that the empty houses gave me the creeps, staring down
at me with their open windows while I . sucked my orange In the
rooms behind those windows lay dead bodies no doubt; some muti
lated, some swollen with the plague (for during a fortnight now the
plague had been busy); all lying quiet up there, with the sun staring
in on them. Each window had a meaning in its eye, and was trying
to convey it. "If you could only look through me," one said "The
house is emptyâ come upstairs and see." For me that was an un
comfortable meal. Felipe, too, had lost some of his spirits. The fact
is, we had been forced to step aside to pass more than one body
stretched at length or huddled in the roadway, andâ well. I have told
you about the dogs. ' ** loia
One of the pirates Jhrust the Silver Chalice Into His Hands. Brother Bartolome "look It and Looked at the Carmelite
For a J^loment |<obod\j Spoke and a Queer Feeling Game Ovter fAz in JVJy Riding.
Between the Cathedral and the quays scarcely a house remained;
for the whole of this side of the city had been built of wood. But
beyond this smoking- waste we came to the great stone warehouses
by the waterside, and the barracks where the Genoese traders lodged
their slaves. The shells of these buildings stood, but every one had
been gutted and the roofs of ail but two or three had collapsed. We
picked our way circumspectly now, for here had been the buccaneers'
headquarters. But the quays were as desolate as the city. Empty,
too, were the long stables where the horses and mules had used to
be kept for conveying the royal plate from ocean to ocean. Two or
three poor beasts lay in their stalls â slaughtered as unfit for service;
thi rest, no doubt, were carrying Morgan's loot on the road to
Chagres.
Here, beside the stable, Felipe took a sudden turn to the right
and struck down a lane which seemed to wind back toward the
city between long lines of warehouses. I believe that, had we gone
forward another hundred yards, to the quay's edge, we should have
seen or heard enough to send us along that lane at the double. As
it was, we heard nothing, and saw only the blue bay, the islands
shining green under the thin line of smoke blown on the land breeze â
no living creature between us and them but a few sea birds. After
we had struck into the lane I turned for another look, and am
sure that this was all.
Felipe led the way down the lane for a couple of gun-shots per
haps; the Carmelite following like a ghost in her white robes, and
I close at her heels. He halted before a low door on the left; a door
of the most ordinary appearance. It opened by a common latch upon
a cobbled passage running between two warehouses, and so narrow
that the walls almost met high over our heads. At the end of this
passageâ which was perhaps forty feet longâ we came to a second
door, with a grille, and, hanging beside it, an iron bell handle, at
which Felipe tugged.
The sound of the bell gave me a start, for It seemed to come from
just beneath my feet. Felipe grinned.
"Brother Bartolome works like a mole. But good wine needs no
bush, my Juanito as you shall presently own. He takes his own
time, though," Felipe grumbled, after a minute. "It cannot be
that "
He was about to tug again when somebody pushed back the little
shutter behind the grille, and a pair of eyes (we could see nothing of
the face) gazed out upon us.
"There is no longer need for caution, reverend father," said
Felipe, addressing tne grille. "The Lutheran dogs have left the city,
and we have come to taste your cordial and consult with you on a
matter of business."
We heard a bolt slid, and the door opened upon a pale emaciated
face and two eyes which clearly found the very moderate daylight
too much for them. Brother Bartolome blinked without ceasing,
while he shielded with one hand the thin flame of an earthenware
lamp.
"Are you come all on one business?" he asked, his gaze passing
from one to another, and resting at length on the Carmelite.
"When the forest takes fire all beasts are cousins," said Felipe
sententiously. Without another question the friar turned and led the
way. down a flight of stairs which plunged (for all I could tell) Into
the bowels of earth. His lamp flickered on bare walls upon which
the spiders scurried. I counted twenty steps, and still all below us
was dark as a pit; ten more, and I was pulled up with that peculiar
and highly disagreeable jar which every one remembers who has put
forward a foot expecting a step, and found himself suddenly on the
level. The passage ran straight ahead into darkness; but the friar
pushed open a tow door in the left-hand wall, and, stepping aside,
uahered us into a room, or paved cell, lit by a small lamp depending
by a chain from tho vaulted roof.
Shelves lined the cell from floor to roof; chests, benches and work
tables occupied two-thirds of the floor space; and all were crowded
with books, bottles, retorts, phials and the ai aratus of a laboratory.
"Crowded," however, is not the word; for at a second glance I
recognized the beautiful order that reigned. The deal work benches
had been scoured white as paper; every glass, very metal pan and
basin sparkled and shone in the double light of the lamp and of a
faint beam of day conducted down from the upper world by a kind
of funnel and through a grated window facing the door.
In this queer double light Brother Bartolome faced us. after ex
tinguishing the small lamp in hie hand.
"You say the pirates have left?"
Felipe nodded. "At daybreak. We in this room are all who re
main in Panama."
"The citizens will be returning, doubtless, in a day or two. I
have no food for you, if that is what you seek. I finished my last
crust yesterday."
"That is a pity. But we must forage. Meanwhile, reverend father,
a touch of your cordial "
Brother Bartolome reached down a bottle from a shelf. It was
heavily sealed and decorated with a large green label bearing a
scarlet cross. Bottles similarly sealed and labeled lined this shelf
and a dozen others. He broke the seal, drew the cork and fetched
three glasses each of which he held carefully up to the lamplight.
Satisfied of their cleanliness, he held the first out to the Carmelite.
She shook her head.
"It is against the vow."
He grunted and poured out a glassful apiece for Felipe and me.
The first sip brought tears into my eyes; and then suddenly I was
filled with sunshine â golden sunshine â and could feel it running from
limb to limb through every vein in my small body.
Felipe chuckled. "See the lad looking down at his stomach! But
ton your jacket, Juanito; the noonday's shining through! Another
sip, to the reverend father's health! His brothers run away â the
Abbot himself runs; but Brother Bartolome stays. For he labors
for the good of man, and that gives a clear conscience. Behold how
just, after all. are the dispositions of Heaven; how blind are the
wicked! For three weeks those bloody-minded dogs have been grin
ning and running about the city; and here under their feet, as in a
mine, have lain the two most precious jewels of allâ a clear con
science and a liquor which, upon my faith, holy father, cannot be
believed In under a second glass."
Brother Bartolome was refilling the glass when the Carmelite
to-jp hed his arm.
"You have been hereâ all the while?"
"Has it been so long? I have been at work, you see."
"For the good of man," interrupted Felipe. "Time slips away
when one works for the good of man."
"And all the while you were distilling this?"
"Thisâ ana other things."
"Other things to drink?"
"My daughter, had they caught me, they might have tortured me.
I might have held my tongue; but, again. I might not. Under torture
one never knows what will happen. Bui the secret of the liquor
had to die with me â that is in the vow. So to be on the safe side I
made â other things."
"Father, give me to drink of those other things."
She spoke scarcely above her breath; but r-- fingers were grip
ping his arm. He looked straignt into her eyes.
"My poor child!" was all he said, very low and slow.
"I can touch no other sacrament," she pleaded. "Father, have
mercy and give me that one!" She watched his eyes eagerly as they
flinched from hers in pity and dwelt for a moment on a tall chest
behind her shoulder, against the wall to the right of the door. She
glanced round, stepped to the chest, and laid a hand on the lid. "Is
It here?" she asked.
But he was beside her on the instant; and stooping, locked down
the lid and drew out the key abruptly.
"Is it here?" she repeated.
"My child, that is an ice chest. In the liquor, for perfection, the
water used has first to be frozen.. That chest contains Ice and
nothing else."
"Nothing else?" she persisted.
But here Felipe broke in. "The Senorita is off her hinges, father.
Much fasting has made her light-headed. And that brings me to my
business. You know my head, too, is not strong; good enough for a
furlong or two, but not for the mile course. Now if you will shelter
these two innocents while I forage, we shall make a famous house
hold. You have rooms here in plenty; the best-hidden in Panama.
But none of us can live without food, and with these two to look
after I am hampered. There are the dogs, too. But Felipe knows a
trick or two more than the dogs, and if he do not fill your larder
by sunset, may his left leg be withered like his right!"
Brother Bartolome considered. "Here are the keys, said he.
"Choose your lodgings and take the boy along with you, for I think
the sister here wishes to talk with me alone."
Felipe took the keys and handed me the small lamp, which I held
aloft as he limped after me along the dark corridor, tapping its
flagged pavement with the nail of his crutch. We passed an iron
studded door which led, he told me, to the cryDt of the chapel; and
soon after mounted a flight of steps and found ourselves before the
great folding doors of the ante-chapel Itself, and looked in. Here
was light again; actual sunlight, falling through six windows high
up in the southern wall and resting in bright patches on the stall
canopies within. We looked on these bright patches through the in
terspaces of a great carved screen; but when I would have pressed
Into the chapel for a better view, Felipe took me by the collar,
"Business first," said he, and pointed up the staircase, which
mounted steeply again after its break by the chapel doors. Up we
went, and were saluted again by the smell of burnt cedar wood wafted
through lancet windows, barred but unglazed, in the outer wall. The
inner hall was blank, of course, being the northern side wall of the
chapel; but we passed one doorway in it with which I was to make
better acquaintance. And, about twenty steps higher, we reached
a long level corridor and the cells where the brothers slept.
Felipe opened them one by one and asked me to take my choice.
All were empty and bare, and seemed to me pretty much alike.
"We have slept in worse, but that is not the point. Be pleased
to remember, Juanito, that we are kings now; and as kings we are
bound to find the reverend fathers' notions of bedding inadequate.
Suppose you collect us half a dozen of these mattresses apiece, while
I go on and explore."
I chose three cells for Sister Marta, Felipe and myself, and set
about dragging beds and furniture from the others to make us really
comfortable. I daresay I spent twenty minutes over this, and, when
all was done, perched myself on a stool before the little window of
my own bedroom, for a look across the city. It was a very little
window indeed, and all I saw was a green patch beyond the northern
suburbs, where the rich merchants' gardens lay spread like offerings
before a broken-down shrino. Those trees no doubt hid trampled
lawns and ruined verandas; but as they had always looked in early
be seen. The suburbs looked just as they had always looked in early
spring.
I was staring out of the window, so, and just beginning to wonder
why Felipe did not return as he had promised, when there came
ringing up the staircase two sharp cries, followed by a long, shrill,
blood-freezing scream.
My first thought (I cannot tell you why) was that Felrpe must
have tumbled downstairs; and without any second thought I had
Jumped off my chair and was flying down to his help, three stairs
at a bound, when another scream and a roar of laughter fetched me
up short. The laugh was not Felipe's; nor could I believe it Brother
Bartolome's. In fact It was the laugh of no one man but of several*
Tne truth leapt on me with a knife as you might say. The buccaneers
had returned.
I told you, a while back, of a small doorway in the Inner wall of
the staircase. It was Just opposite this door that I found myself
cowering, trying to close my ears against the abhorrent screams
which filled the stairway and the empty corridor above their echoes
To crawl out of sight â had you lived through those three weeks in
Panama you would understand why this was the only thought In
my head, and why my knees shook so that I actually crawled on
them to the little door, and finding that It opened easily, crept inside
and shut it before looking about me.
But even in the act of shutting it I grew aware that the screams
and laughter were louder than ever. And a glance around told me
that I was not in a room at all, but in the chapel, or rather in a
gallery overlooking it, and faced with an open balustrade.
As I crouched there on my knees, they could not see me, nor
could I see them; but their laughter and their infernal jabber â for
these buccaneers were the sweepings of half a dozen nationsâ came
to my ears as distinct as though I stood among thorn. And under
the compulsion of terror I crawled to the front of the gallery and
peered down between its twisted balusters.
I told you, to start with, that Felipe was a crazy old fool; and I
daresay you have ?athered by this time what shape his craziness
took. He had a mania for imagining himself a groat man. For days
together he might be as sane as you or I; and then, all of a sudden â â 
a chance word would set him off â he had mounted his horse and put
on all the airs of the King of Spain, or his Holiness the Pope, or any
grandissimo you pleased, from the Governor of Panama upwards. I
had known that morning, when he began to prate about our being
kings, that the crust of his common sense was wearing thin. I sup
pose that after leaving me he must have come across the coffers in
which the Abbot kept his robes of state, and that the sight of them
started his folly with a wist. For he lay below me on the marble
floor of the chapel, arrayed like a prince of the church, 'ihe miter
had rolled from his head; but the folds of a magnificent purple cope,
embroidered with golden lilies and lined with white silk, flowed from
his twisted shoulders over the black and white chequers of the pave
ment. And he must have dressed himself with care, too; for beneath
the torn hem of the alb his feet and ankles stirred feebly, and caught
my eye; and they were clad in silken stockinVs. He was screaming
no longer. Only a moan came at intervals as he lay there, with
closed eyes, in the center of that ring of devils; and on the outer
edge of the ring, guarded, stood Brother Bartolome and the Carmelite.
Had we forgotten or been too careless to close the door after us
when Brother Bartolome let us in? I tried to remember, but could
not be sure.
The most of the buccaneers â there were eight of them â spoke no
Spanish; but there was one, a cross-eyed fellow, who acted as in
terpreter. And he knelt and held up a bundle of keys which Felipe
wore slung: from a girdle round his waist.
"Once more, Master Abbotâ will you show us your treasures, or
wilXyou not?"
Bielipe moaned.
"I tell you," Brother Bartolome spoke up, very short and dis
tinct, "there are no treasures. And if there were, that poor wretch
could not show them. He is no Abbot, but a beggar who has lived
on charity these twenty years to my knowledge."
"That tongue of yours, friar, needs looking to. I promise you to
cut it out and examine it when I have done with your reverend father
here. As for the wench at your side "
"You may do as your cruelty prompts you," Brother Bartolome
interrupted. "But that man is no Abbot."
"He may be Saint Peter himself, and these the keys to Heaven
and Hell. But I and my camarados are going to find out what they
open, as sure as my name is Evan Evans." And he knotted a cord
round Felipe's forehead and began to twist. The Carmelite put her
hands over her eyes and would have fallen; but one of her guards
held her up, while another slipped both arms round her neck from
behind and held her eyelids wide open with nnger and thumb. I
believeâ l hopeâ that Felipe was past feeling by this time, as he
certainly was past speech. He did not scream again, and it was only
for a little while that he moaned. But even when the poor fool's
head dropped on his shoulder, and the life went out of him, they
did not finish with the corpse until, in thc.r blasphemous sport, they
had hoisted it over the altar and strapped it there with Its arms
outstretched and legs dangling.
"Now I think it is your turn," said the scoundrel Evans, turning
to Brother Bartolome with a grin. "I regret that we cannot give
you long, for we returned from Tavoga this morning to find Captain
Morgan already on the road. It will save time if you tell us at once
what these keys open."
"Certainly I wi!l tell you," said the friar, and stretched out a
hjind for the bunch. "This key, for instance, is useless; it opens
the door of the wicket by which you entered. This opens the chest
which, as a rule, contains the holy vessels; but it, too, is useless,
since the chest is empty of all but the silver chalices and a couple
of patens. Will you send one of your men to prove that I speak
truth? This, again, is the key of my own cell "
"Where your reverence entertains the pretty nuns who come for
absolution."
"After that," said Brother Bartolome, pointing a finger toward
the poor shape dangling, "you might disdain small blackguardisms
of speech."
The scoundrel leaned his back against a carved bench end arid
nodded his head slowly. "Master friar, you shall have a -nrd death."
"Possibly. This, as I was saying, is the key of my cell, where
I decoct the liquor for which this house is famous. Of our present
stock the bulk lies in the cellars, to which this" â and he held up yet
another key â "will admit you. Yes, that is it," as one of the pirates
produced a bottle and held it under his nose.
"Eh? Let me see it." The brute Evans snatched the bottle. "Is
this the stuff?" he demanded, holding it up to the sunlight which
streamed down red on his hand from the robe of a martyr in one of
the painted windows above. He pulled out his heavy knife, and with
the back of it knocked off the bottle neck.
"I will trouble you to swear to the taste," said he.
"I taste it only when our customers complain. They have not
complained now for two-and-twenty years."
"Nevertheless you will taste it."
Brother Bartolome shrugged his shoulders. "It Is against the
vow, but, under compulsion, and truly I make it even better than
I used," he wound up, smacking his thin lips as he handed back the
bottle.
The buccaneer took it, watching his face closely. "Here's death
to the Pope!" said he, and tasted it, then took a gulp. "The devil,
but it is hot!" he exclaimed, the tears springing into his eyes.
"Certainly, if you drink it in that fashion- But why not try It
â with Ice?"
"Ice?"
"You will find a chestful In my cell. Here Is the key; which,
by the way, has no business with this bunch. Felipe, yonder, who
was always light-fingered, must have stolen it from my work bench."
"Hand It over. One must go to the priests to learn good living.
Here, Jacques le Bee." He rattled off an order to a long-nosed fel
low at his elbow, who saluted and left the chapel, taking the key.
"We shall need a cup to mix it In," said Brother Bartolome quietly.
One of the pirates thruÃt the silver chalices into his hands; for
the bottle had been passed from one man to another, and they were
thirsty for more. Brother Bartoleme took it, and looked at the Car
melite. For the moment nobody spoke; and a queer feeling came
over me in my hiding. This quiet group of persons in the quiet
chapel â it seemed to me impossible they could mean harm to one
another, that in a minute or two the devil would be loose among
them. There was no menace In the posture of any one of them, and
in Brother Bartolome's there was certainly no hint of fear. His back
was toward me, but the Carmelite stood facing my gallery, and I
looked straight into her eyes as they rested on the cups, and in them
I read anxiety indeed, but not fear. It was something quite dif
ferent from fear.
The noise of Jacques 1Â° Bee's footstep In the ante-chapel broke
this odd spell of silence. The man Evans uncrossed his legs and took
a pace to meet him. "Here, hand me a couple of bottles. How much
will the cups hold?"
"A bottle and a half, or thereabouts; that Is, if you allow for
the ice."
Jacques carried the bottles in a satchel, and a block of ice in a
wrapper under his left arm. He handed over the satchel, set down
the ice on the pavement and began to unwrap it. At a word from
Evans he fell to breaking it up with the pommel of his sword.
"We must give it a minute or two to melt," Evans added. An<J
again a silence fell, in which I could hear the lumps of ice tinkling
as they knocked against the silver rims of the chalices.
"The ice is melted. Is it your pleasure that I first taste this also?"
Brother Bartolome spoke very gravely and deliberately.
The friar lifted one of the chalices and drank. He held it to his
lips with a hand that did not shake at all; and, having tasted, passed
it on to Evans without a word or a glance. His eyes were on the
Carmelite, who had taken half a step forward with palms held side
wise to receive the chalice he still held in his right hand. He guided
it to her lips, and his left hand blessed her while she drank. Almost
before she had done the Frenchman, Jacques le Bee, snatched it.
The Carmelite stood, swaying. Brother Bartolome watched the
cups as they went full circle.
Jacques le Bee, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand,
spoke a word or two rapidly In French.
Brother Bartolome turned to Evans. "Yes, I go with you. For
you, my child!" He felt for his crucifix and held it over the
Carmelite, who had dropped on her knees before him. At the same
time, with his left hand, he pointed toward the altar. "For these,
the mockery of the crucified one which themselves have prepared!"
I saw Evans pull out his knife and leap. I saw him, like a man
shot, drop his arm and spin right-about as two screams rang out
from the gallery over his head. It must have been I who screamed;
and to me, now that Is the inexplicable part of it. I cannot remem
ber uttering the screams; yet I can see Evans as he turned at the
sound of them.
Yet it was I who screamed, and who ran for the door and, still
screaming, dashed out upon the staircase. Up the stairs I ran; along
the corridor, and up a second staircase.
The sunshine broke around me. I was on the leads of the roof,
and Panama lay spread at my feet like a trodden garden. I listened;
no footsteps were following. Far away from the westward came the
notes of a bugle â faint, yet clear. In the northern suburbs the dogs
were baying. I listened again. I crept to the parapet of the roof
and saw the stained eastern window of the chapel a few yards below
me, saw its painted saints and martyrs, outlined in lead, dull against
tilÂ© noonday glow. And from within came no sound at all.

WHERE THE NEW UNIVERSITY
CALIFORNIA WILL RISE
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
And Its Position.
BY PRESIDENT DAVID STARR JORDAN.
â
â¢n- N writing on the "New Era of
1 Stanford University," 1 have first
Stanford University," 1 have Qrst
M to Bay that, so far as I know, no
"new era" is dawning or likely to
dawn. I trust that none may be neces
sary. It is our hope that Its growth in
soundness and effectiveness nay be
steady and continuous, without notable
"boom," therefore without danger of
collapse. At any rate, it has thus far
had but one "era," which is now seven
years long.
When its doors were opened in IS9I
a New Yoik newspaper, the Mai; and
Express, 1 â¢ believe, commented on its
3, and expressed its belief
that "the need of another university in
i was aboul as great us that
of an asylum for de< . captains
In Switzerland." It foretold that Stan
ford professors, if any were needed,
would for years to come "deliver their
lectures in marble halls to empty
benches."
The facts of to-day are against this
prophecy. The lecture rooms and lab
oratories of the new institution have
been crowded to the utmost from the
day of opening. In the class rooms
made ready In 18S1 for GOO students
1224 were crowded in 189 S. Of these
i re young women, 7G(J young men;
were from California, L's7 from
States to the east of the Rocky Moun
tains, with a respectable percentage
from Japan, Brazil, .Mexico and the
countries of Europe, it is at least evi
dent that the university has met or
made a distinct demand somewhere. It
Is out of the category of the decayed
pea captains' asylums. Its professors
have found no sinecure, and the "mar
ble halls" have found more than the
voice of one man to raise their echoes.
Admitting that the university h&a
found a place in California, that it is
a real thing with real purposes and
that it has come to stay, what is the
basis of Its Buccess? In other words,
what are its working ideals?
it in not for me to answer thi:-. 1 am
too near the work to judge it impartial
ly. The unforeseen conditions of the
last flve years have forced the uni
versity to adjust its Ideate to unex
p eted (acts. ]t lias considered not
what is ideally best, but what is best
under the circumstances. The tre
mendous strain of life and death liti
gatldh wantonly thrown upon it and
on its devoted founder at a time of the
greatest financial stress was something
unparalleled in university experiences.
In this time of stress wo have devel
oped some new idealsâ not those of
scholarship, perhaps, but rather those
of nerve, faith and endurance. The
vexatious lawsuit and the successive
victories at football were not without
a certain relation of cause and effect.
If we must choose from the old
Btock of "Stanford ideals," I should
say that the highest one was this. A
university, like an individual, must
have a character of its own. If it is
merely a collection of books, desks,
chemicals, microscopes, rules and reg
ulations, with professors anxious
chiefly "to hold down their Jobs," It
does not rise much above the level of
â¢ ih< ese factory. It is the trait of per
sonality which makes the university.
It ls>.not its vegetative processes, its
teaching of grammar, algebra and
the laws of falling bodies, which makes
it worthy of love and trust !t is the
spirit of i hi' whole, the Influent ("
personal characti r, which makes it a real
organism. "Colleges," pays Emerson,
"can mily serve us when their aim is
noi to drill, but to create; when ih'-y
gather from afar every ray of various
genius to thru- hospitable halls, ami by
is ir (â â¢( â â¢ mci ' â¢ M < ''â â â  s Bet the heart
of the youth in flame."
It is the concentration of tho fires of
genius, the influence of personality that
gives the university its character. That
the institution at Palo Alto should have
some quality of its own, is the hope of
those who hnve tried to shape its
course. What this character is, others
must decide.
For one thing, I believe that one will
not have to go belflfw the surface to find
It. The university is just what it pre
tends to be. It has no pompous forms
or ceremonies to conceal idle action or
want of action. The gown of the
scholar has covered a multitude of tin
scholarly things in the past. Stanford
men wear no gowns. The university
has no place for make-believes, wheth
er pious or worldly. The toys which
amused the boyhood of culture are kept
In their proper places. "Of all horned
cattle," observed Horace Greeley, "pre

He was not speaking of the Stanford
man, who, at his best, is quite another
sort of fellow. The essence of higher
education to-day is individual training.
A man is educated when he has had the
kind of schooling needful to make a
man of him. Not the kind which five
hundred years ago was used to make a
gentleman or clen&yman of John Doe
or of Richard Roe. It is the kind which
will civilize the particular boy of to
day and which will make a man of him.
T have reached the end of my space,
and the true secret of the "new era" at
Palo Alto is yet unspoken. Perhaps it
may never be told. Perhaps each one
who passes through its gates may tell
a little of It.
The architectural motive of the old
Franciscan missions is strengthened
and fitted to the needs of another mis
sion, not less sacred than that hallowed
by the life of Junipero Serra.
Something of it all comes from the
charm of California* Itself. Stanford
University could exist in no other set
ting. The "winds of freedom" blow
inÂ»r California: tho sunshine floods her
valleys every month in the year. Some
time the most lovable, the most j?ra
li'ius of all tho States of our Union
may become the most enlightened, the
most wise. It is the true policy of Cali
fornia, through her- two great universi
ties, to make the shores of her bay the
educational center of the United States.
This can be done through wise manage
ment and wise expenditures. When it
Is accomplished our State will take and
bold her rightful place among the
States of our Union. The center of
beauty already, California will become
the center of high thought, the center
of wise action.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, PECEJVIBER 18, 1898.
LIBRARY <& HALL of MECHANICS,
OLD UNIVERSITY:
PLANNING ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING
Institutions in the World.
Every Stone of tfoe State University at Berkeley Will Be Razed
and cNoble Buildings, Erected Jlecording to a .Har
monious Design, Will Rise on tfee Site.
THE present buildings of th^
State University are soon to be
wiped out of existence.
Not i is to be left
standing upon another. The
famous halls of learning will disa]
from si.L,in as completely as if they
never had been.
All this was told me a few days ago
by one of the Berkeley professors as
we stood at the en.! of the road that
winds out of the forest of oaks. We
looking across the campus and
saw the venerable, dignified old struc
ture that so many of us revere, bathed
in the sofl light of the December sun
shine.
I turned and looked at the professor
in anmzi , â 
"What?" l asked, "will they Lear
down deai' old North Han? Will they
teai down tlwu venerable old library
with its tiers and tier;- of valuable
books? Will they tear down every
thing?"
"Yes, everything," he answered,
"even the last new building erected,
the school of mines.
"It's going to be the finest university
in the world." said the professor. "The
main building is to be right along
there, overloking the Golden Gate. On
eithetf side are to be others, all In the
same style of architecture and con
forming to the general plan of con
struction.
"Our new home is to be absolutely
perfect. On yonder hill just above
where the big oak grows the observa
tory will stand."
As the professor talked I saw the
whole face of nature embellished by the
art of man. Towers of shining marble
rose high in the air and the sun Hashed
on gilded domes. Fountains played,
and the air was filled with music. The
grass ol the campus was as green as
an emerald.
"Are you sure this is all going to be?"
I asked.
"Ten million dollars is already se
cured and more is sure to be on hand
when anted. Architects are now at
work fi..i.shins the working plans. For
si. me tiire past several of us had earn
estly discussed the project of having
university buildings erected on a set
tled plan with a definite architectural
design in view. Here we have the
finest university site in the world and
we wanted to see it taken advantage
of: to see it properly embellished. We
talked the matter over time and again,
but could not see how to gain our first
pomt â money. With money we could
obtain the proper plans for a university
and also Cie power to carry out the
plans. Tfc*Â« came along the woman
who gayÂ« a practical turn to all our
plans and thus made the start in what
will be the New University of Califor
nia, and with this site and the plans
proposed it is bound to be the most
beautiful institution architecturally in
the whole world.
"Mrs. Hearst began by furnishing the
money to get a set of designs made
by some of the greatest living archi
tects and also guaranteed a couple of
million dollars to be used in erecting
two buildings in the new designs. Her
action pointed the way to many others
of our best citizens. Several of them
have made promises that indicate we
will have over 55, 000. 000 when the work
begins. There is enough on hand now
to carry on the work for several years."
The general scheme of a new uni
versity hotne dates back to a certain
day a good many years ago when Prof.
C. W. Jones and Mr. B. W. Maybpck
were discussing the urgent necessity of
a new building. The rlassrooms were
crowded beyond their comfortable
pa< Ity. Something had to be done,
but what? The buildings already
erected were independent of each other,
placed almost haphazard and formed
no part ol a harmonious design.
When in- university was founded by
the State it was enjoined that the
buildings should be all on one harmo
nious plan, but the injunction had not
b â  ; carried out.
"We ought to ! "gin to build for the
future," said Mr. Maybeck, "or it will
b( too late. We have the most ideal
site In the world, Th university be
longs to the State destined to be the
greatest In the CTnion. We ahoukl
adopt a plan foi one State university
which shall be worthy of the magni
ficent site, and also of the great State
it belongs to."
The proposition was urged upon the
regents, but they could not see their
way clear to adopting any plan.
"Your Ideas are all right," they said.
"but such a plan would cost a great deal
of money. We do not think it right
to spend the people's money in that
way. They want buildings on the earth
and not in Spain or on paper. No,
must get Just as much for the money
as v. â¢ can."
They did. The h'i'.ildinrrs at present
in use by the school testify eloquently
to the thrift of the regents. They are
good, plain, businesslike buildings, but
much too small.
In iviO, when the class rooms would
not hold the students, an attempt was
made to utilize tents. It was not v
BUi c -s. The heat of the Berkeley sun
threatened to turn the heads of tho
poor students as they broiled at their
lectures under the white canvas.
Then came Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst.
She wanted to found a memorial to her
husband which should show his as well
as her love for California. She wanted
to make the memorial a part of the
State University. In discussing the
plan of "how and where" the whole in
definite construction of the buildings
was discussed. "We want to unite the
architects of the world to plan a
home for the university. We have the
most perfect site and we want build
ings worthy of the site," Professor
Jones said to her.
"Why, then, do you not carry out
your plan?" she asked him.
"We have not the money."
"Then allow me to bear the expense."
It was the first step, and when the
money question was answered the uni
versity regents became enthusiastic.
Mrs. Hearst said: "I have only one
wish in this matter â that the plans
adopted should be worthy of the great
university whose material home they
are to provide for, that thpy should
harmonise with and even enhance the
beauty cÂ»f the sito, whereon this home
is to be built, and that they should re
dound to the glory of the State whosr
culture and civilization are to be
nursed and developed at its university."
Fifty thousand dollars was deposited
in a London bank, but the cost has al
ready been twice this amount.
The presidents of the leading uni
versities were all called upon for their
views regarding the advisability of the
undertaking. They took an unexpected
interest and every one of them replied
and every one said in substance what
President Charles William Eliot of
Harvard said in his reply:
"If some great benefactor of the uni-\
versity (Harvard) should desire to do a
work that should hand down his name
in ever increasing honor with poster
ity, he might require the destruction
of all the buildings erected In the last
half century, and their reconstruction
with simple and beautiful designs in
mutually helpful, harmonious' and ef
fectitve relation to each other, so that
the outward aspect of the university
NORTH Â«) SOUTH ALL
ACROSS THE CAMPUS,
PRESENT UNIVERSITY.
! should better agree with its object as
â¢i place for the education of the youth
1 of the nation. Such a superb work
j is harclly to be expected in this genera
tion, but at some time it must be ac
â  complished by individual or by public
1 friends if the university (Harvard) is
ever to carry out its most important
functions."
That exactly is what is to be done
at Berkeley for the State University of
' California.
All the present buildings are to be re
moved. Two of them are memorial,
j the library and the gymnasium. Mr.
â  H. D. Bacon left many books and busts
with mom y to build a library and gave
$.'.">, 000 on condition that the State of
California give a like sum for the build
ing and equipment of a gymnasium.
Tii,..,. i tV( ) buildings, which would be
rmonious with any great design,
will be removed. Suitable memorials
to their donors, however, will be incor
purated :n the new buildings.
Architects and engineers all over The
ivorld were asked for advice that the
ix I I ideas might bo obtained.
Mr. Burnham of Burnham & Root, Chi
cago, the man who was the architect of
the World's Fair buildings, said in his
reply: "It will be a work many times
the magnitude of the buildings for the
World's Fair. The world has never
se n such a plan on such a scale before
that was carried to a completion."
The carrying out of the de
tails for receiving and judging
the plans was intrusted to
the municipality of Antwerp. The
plans were sent to the American Consul
and each sealed and signed only by a
number. After they were handed over
to the city by the American Consul
seals were placed 0%-er each signature
so that no one could know to whom the
plans belonged.
A jury of five men had been se
lected: R. Norman Shaw, 6 Ellerdale
Road. Hampstead, England; J. L.
Pascal, 8 Boulevard St. Denis, Paris;
Caul \v allot. 6 Hahnelstrass, Dres
den; Walter Cook, (574 Broadway, New
Fork; J. R. Reinstine, 217 Sansome
street, San Francisco, Cal.
I'liest? gentlemen met in Antwerp In
the beginning of October to judge the
plans which were then in the care of
the city. They selected the five which
they considered the best, and to these
five $JO,OOO in prizes were distributed.
Of those accepted the architects all
were from the Ecole dcs Beaux Arts of
Paris, but tare eof them were Amer-
Icans.
The architects were not limited in
any way. Money was not considered
nor were the architects hampered by
suggestions. Homes were asked for,
libraries, museums, gymnasiums, art
galleries, lecture rooms, class rooms,
scientific laboratories, and all the usual
accompaniments of a great seat of
learning. Besides, dormitories for 5000
students are lo be included and club
houses, armory and indoor and outdoor
drilling spaces.
The trees on the campus, the great
oaks which are the pride of the univer
sity, are not to be removed or dis
lodged. Most of the trees are ever
green, so that in winter as well as sum
mer the campus will be at its best.
At Mrs. Hearst's expense the five
successful architects at the Antwerp
competition are visiting San Francisco
so as to make a careful study of the
site and of the requirements and also
of the character of the surrounding
landscape. They are to return to their
homes and prepare definite plans.
These plans are to be submitted to the
same preliminary jury which judged
the plans in, Antwerp, with the addition
of four architects. These four archi
tects are to be chosen from a Hat of
five names each sent In by the five
architects who are entitled to compete
for the final plan.
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
And Its Future.
BY PRESIDENT MARTIN KELLOGG.
A UNIVERSITY worthy of the
name is one of the things that
give distinction to a State. In
the Eastern States Harvard has
long shed a luster on Massa
chusetts, Tale on Connecticut, Prince
ton on New Jersey. Abroad Berlin,
Leipzig and a whole cluster of universi
ties have helped to place Germany in
the very front rank of nations. Oxford
and Cambridge are the imperishable
glory of England. The sons of bleak
Scotland have gone forth from Edin
boro to Aberdeen to win pre-emi
nence in many lands. Among our own
State universities Michigan has led the
way of success, and reflects no small
glory on that commonwealth. Other
States have followed her lead, and now
a Umg chain of State foundations is
rising to an assured and noble place in
our American world.
Thirty years ago California # laid the
foundations of such an institution. It
built on the bounty of the nation, on its
own subsidies, on the voluntary self
surrender of ,the older college of Cali
fornia. The State of California has al
ways been generous to its university,
but in the nature of things the growth
of the new institution was slow. The
call for the higher education was lim
ited, the repute of the young university
was not yet a powerful magnet: so the
graduates of Eastern colleges preferred
to send their sons to the old homes.
Our, university had its fluctuations; at
times it even receded in numbers and
influence. But on the whole it made
substantial progress. In 1886 an impor
tant forward step was taken, when a
one-cent tax was granted, in lieu of
specific appropriations, by the Legisla
ture. Not many years afterward the
number of students .began to increase
in a remarkable wayj From a round 400
in 1890, the attendance at Berkeley ran
rapidly up to over 1300 in 1896.
The Legislature of 1897 granted an
additional one-cent tax, and voted it
without a dissenting voice. Its visiting
committees found at Berkeley the most
pressing need for this assistance. The
buildings were greatly overcrowded,
the instructors' classes were twice or
thrice too , ; large . for proper manage
ment. .Great relief has been afforded
by this additional income. Several new
buildings have been erected, and the
subdivided sections have been more ef
ficiently taught. But even then the
university's funds have by no means
kept pace. with .the multiplied numbers
of the students."---. In the past ten years
the numbers to : be â  provided for ?â  have
increased more than fourfold. At pres
ent ', the i student f roll at â  Berkeley runs
up to nearly 1600. The State's good faith
is pledged to give to all of them suit
able : rooms, equipment and instruction.
Of course, it would be a deathblow to
our progress if any part of the State's
aid were withdrawn. '
The new era v for our university is
grounded on , the assurance that Cali- >
fornia will : continue to ;be a ; generous
foster-mother. We cannot. believe that
as i the : university has grown I stronger
and v more distinguished the citizens of
the State will lose their Interest in it,- or
allow Its : lust â¢ claim* ?to go :â¢ unheeded.
California's pride is too great for that_
Our reputation is good throughout the>
land, and "not half bad" across the At
lantic. The alumni of the university
form a noteworthy nucleus of public*
sentiment. Our sons and daughters will
keep us all in mind of our high educa
tional obligations.
The State may justly expect the co
operation' of private beneficence, and
the most striking sign of the new era
Is that such beneficence has set strong
ly in our direction. Important gift*
from individuals had been received be
fore, but all too seldom for our full en
couragement. Tompkins, Reese, Har
mon, Bacon, Millsâ such names wera
scattered thinly along the years.
But now we" rejoice in still ample*
and still more fieauent gifts. Mrs.
Phebe A. Hearst, after valuable aid to
the Lick Observatory and ?till more
valuable help in scholarship? for young
women, has now delighted and en
chanted us by her new and splendid
benefactions.
â¢ â¢ *
While we were congratulating our
selves on these benefactions another
noble-minded woman lately bestowed
also a magnificent gift. The property
at Menlo Park given by Miss Cora
Jane Flood will in time possess great
value for the university, and especially
for its newly organized college of com-
merce. To go further back, the gift
of Hon. Adolph Sutro of a site for tha
Affiliated Colleges building is to be
counted among our most important pos
sessions, and the generosity of Edward
F. Searles, Esq., in the gift of the Mark
Hopkins Institute, is likewise princely.
The Ltvi Strauss scholarships come
Into the same recent cycle. Our library
has been enriched by many important
donations. It is not the fact of one
great gift that makes a new era so
much as the clustering together of gifts,
like the jewels of a diadem, evincing
the deep interest of the people of tha
State in their university.
The opening of the new era will be
signalized by the flourishing condition
of a century plant long maturing viz.,
the close affiliation between the uni
versity and the schools of the Btate.
By its range of studies the university
is at the head of the school system
But it claims no authority and It m
the hearty co-operation of the high
schools. For years it has been off
its aid to these schools, and thr
them to the lower schools Thei -^ i 9
probably no State in the Union whore
these reciprocal relations are more cor
dial or more promising for the stability
and. prosperity of the university
These are a few of the considerations
which seem to. justify us in speaking
of a new era for the State Univer?in.
Its growth was nearly always firm and
sure. Its more recent growth has been
phenomenal. It has the good will of
the citizens at large. The farmers rec
ognize its good work for them; the mer- i
chants hail the establishment of thÂ«W
n . e .y /allege of com/nerce. Splendid
girts for buildings are pouring in, which
need only to be complemented by en
dowments for many chaira of instruc
tion. If the university is wisely di- 4

and students cherish the true university

to short sightedness on the part of the
Government the surfmen had no means
of reaching the scene of the wreck.
Within sight of the disaster they had
to stand still and watch the sailors
drown, while couriers scoured the ad
jacent county in search of horses to
pull the life boat and beach cart to the
water. Had it been possible to launch
the life boat at ones many of the crew
of the Atalanta might have been alive
and well to-day.

he becomes excited the blood gushes

again and then he weeps like a child.
He was cook on the Atalanta.
The Atalanta, Captain Charles Mc-
Bride, was on her way from Tacoma to
South Africa with a cargo of grain
when the disaster occurred. How she
came to pile up on the sandspit at the
entrance to Alsea Bay when she ought
to have been hundreds of miles off
shore will never be known, as all the
officers went down with the ship. Cap
tain McÃride was wrecked once before
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1898.
on the Welsh coast and all the crew
save himself and a few others were
drowned. A young Welsh lady nursed
MoÃrlde back to life and before he wont
to sea again he married her. In the
Atalanta wreck he was one of the first
men drowned.
According to all* that can be gathered
the Atalanta was steered southeast
half east all <if that fateful night, and
that brought her close inshore on our
coast. It was blowing a living pale
and Cape Foulweather light was ob
scured by fog and sleet.
When First Mate Hunter was told
by one of the crew that he thought
he saw a fixed light the mate laughed
at the idea and said it was a passing
ship.
The next instant he was yelling into
the forecastle, "Get on deck, men, for
your lives. Don't wait to put your
clothes on."
A moment later Captain McÃride ran
on deck in his nightclothes, and giving
one wild look around shouted: "Put
your wheel hard over! Square the cross
jackyard! My God, Hunter, where
have you put her?"
"It was a roaring, wild night," said
Arnold, in talking of the horrors of the
â¢wreck, "and the booming of the break
ers is always in my ears and the sight
of my drowning mates before my eyes.
The noise of the surges is so great
sometimes that I cannot hear questions
that are put to sse.

"Here is something for you. Mile. Jeanne! And horo, M. Artemon, is all
that wad given me for M. Hochary's company," and from the top of tno
diligence he held out a long, narrow card box to the comedian, who leaned
forward to receive it. In its aerial transit the cover, which had been badly
tied on, fell to the ground, and a wig of yellow hair was caught by Arte
mon on the wing, like a flag floating in the wind.
"Bottina's wig!" exclaimed the excited actor. "Bettina s wig, and not
my cassock, the cassock of the Abbe Constantln. Where the devil have
you put it, rascal?"
"On my word of honor, I have nothing else," asserted Matthew, dis
playing his empty hands.
"How annoying, fellow. There has been some mistake. Mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle,"* he called despairingly to Jeanne, who had turned away with
a majestic air, "are you sure that you have not the cassock?'
"Scamp!" said the haughty housekeeper, disdainfully.
Down the stairs M. Artemon flew, four stops at a time, and rushed
Into the greenroom, where the rest of the company were assembled. His
hurriod entrance filled them all with consternation.
"My friends," he exclaimed, tragically, "the posters must be changed,
or the performance postponed. I cannot play the role of the Abbe Con
etantin to-night."
Mile. Valeric threw asid<* the white gown of the Ingenue which she was
mending skillfully. The wife of M. Hochary stopped reading the role of
Mme. Scott. Hochary, seated at a table before an appetizer, manifested
his surprise by a convulsion of his long legs, which, as a rule, expressed
the state of his soul.
"Artemon," said a cavernous voice, "what is the meaning of this
caprice? What of the box office money? The expenses of the programmes
and the advertisements? You know as well as I do that we are at the end
of <nir resources, and that our last venture was a failure. Don't try your
Mile. Mars on us, my good fellow. We play to-night!"
"But can you not understand? I have not a cassock, " gasped the un
happy Artemon, letting his arms fall with dejection.
Glances full of consternation were now exchanged.
"< 'annot a cassock be Improvised with a black dress and a cloak of one
of the ladles?" hazarded Hochary.
"The ladles are much too short and slight," groaned Artemon, who re
joiced in an imposing corpulency.
"As for me, I have only the Figaro nostump, Peruvian pantaloons and
the black coat for Pierrot, and a flowered morning gown," said the man
ager, pensively.
"For heaven's sake, ladies, aid us with your suggestions. We must
play the piece at any cost."
The situation was critical for the poor artists, whose present tour had
been far from successful. The leading man then proi)osed to gallop at full
speed to the neighboring city, but this suggestion was not deemed practi
cable.
"What is to be done? There is not one garb of the required kind among
the properties of this accursed hole," repeated Hochary, in nn outburst of
Impotent rage.
Suddenly Artemon struck his forehead violently, and his entire bearing
denoted a genuine Inspiration.
"Ah. my friends," he exclaimed, in a voice full of emotion, "what a
wild hope. So much the worse; I will attempt the adventure. It la our
only hope of salvation."
In a few words he explained.
"Come to my arms, my son," exclaimed M. Hochary, extending his legs
with enthusiasm.
And Artemon ran off to finish his shaving 1 , to don his tiiack frock coat,
and then direct his steps to the cure's home.
Happily for the actor, Jeanne was absent putting the last touches on
the church decorations, and it was one of the chorus children who inno
cently opened the door of the rectory and introduced the visitor into the
room where the good cure was terminating his devotions. At the sight of

"The oldest and most worn-out In your possession, one that y ou may
have thrown aside," Artemon hastened to say. "I am to play to-nignt tne
rolo of the Abbe Constantin, and I cannot represent my character without
conforming to its demands and carrying out its sacerdotal dignity.
M. Lamier sprang 1 from his seat. .
"Do you think for a moment, monsieur," he said, overcome by surprise
nnd anger, "to profane a gown that has served at worship, and to maKe mo
the accomplice of these sinful amusements? Your ignoranco respecting
holy things and religion is your only excuse."
"Pardon me. M. le Cure," continued tho actor, slightly em
barrassed, but not the less determined, "it would not be the
llrst time religion has lent its aid to the drama. Do you recall the cele
brated mysteries of the Middle Ages? Moreover, I was educated in a
Beminary, and It was there I was led to adopt the vocation of actor, In
playing tho role of Athalie for the fete of the superior."
li Lamier, without being disarmed, looked again at the actor with new
interest. If this unhappy man had followed a bad calling, his point of
departure had at least been good. Ills heart could not, therefore, be cor
roded throughout, and perhaps it would be possible to point out to him the
error of hla ways.
"How comes It," said the abbe, with bitterness, "that you play on
Christmas eve?"
"Alas! M. le Cure," replied Artemon, with simplicity, "we must eat on
that night, as on any other."
M. Lamier was touched to the heart by this reply. "Poor fellow! Tho
soul of the good priest was filled with grief. He felt too unhappy to refuse
the speaker anything-.
"But," he gToaned, looking plaintively at Artemon, ' can you not choose
another piece rather than expose a servant of God to the risk of such a
sacrilege, and also to risk perverting the souls of those disposed, to be fer
"6h, Satan! Satan!" thought M. Lamier, overcome, and lowering hl3
eyes at these somewhat too direct praises, "am I now about to sin through
vanity?"
Ai; he was about to utter two prayers to cast the thoughts from his
mind Artemon approached him confidentially.
"You Bee, M. le Cure, you have never attended the theater.'
"Butâ well, certainly not," replied the abbe, Htartled by the very idea.
"]t is for that vs-ry' reason that you regard it as a place of evil. Why,
the theater Is the school of morals which second those or tne church. Our
dramas are simply sermons put into action. There is no piece in which
virtue is not lauded and vice and hypocrisy scourged. Ah, it is a noble
work, that of the comedian, in the eyes of those who understand it."
"What a pity this Artemon is not a preacher." thought M. Lamier, fas
cinated. "His larye face, closely shaved, with its cheeks like a Dominican,
iv -i!d look Well in a pulpit, and his insinuating voice and speaking gestures
would be very effective for good."
"Among us. I dare to say, there are many good fellows,' continued
Arttmon. "United households, good mothers of families, good citizens
abound with us."
He proceeded to cite examples: Mile. Valeric, a child of the stage., who
was the support oi her parents; M. and Mme. Hochary, models of conjugal
tenderness. One and all held their hearts in their hands, and never re
fused a service or kindness to a comrade, never refuÃed to do a good work,
a eond action.
"Is an actor ever to be seen on the culprit's stool unless for debt?" said
the comedian, fringing hla warm panegyric to a close. "It is true we are.
for the most part, roving grasshoppers, and grasshoppers have not any
more chance to-day than they had In La Fontaine's time."
The words were spoken with discouragement, owing to the immova
bility of the cure. As he spoke, the actor arose and brushed his hat with
gloomy energy.
"Well," he sighed, "we alone shall pass a sad Christmas while all the
world besides will be blithe and happy. M. le Cure, pardon me for having
taken up so much of your time."
He turned toward the door.
The old priest aroused himself.
"Jeanne," he called, in a loud voice, full of the exaltation of triumphant
charity, "bring me at once my new cassock."
"Ah, M. le Cure!" exclaimed the actor, overcome by the unexpected
success and pressing the r>ri< st's hands with effusion.
As Jeanne entered with the cassock upon her arm In great folds the
priest rebuked her ior loitering.
"Now bring me my shoes with the silver buckles; run quickly; why,
a snail would go as fast, is it not so, Monsieur Actor? And a hat also; you
must have a hat."
â¢'What?" said Jeanne, shuddering. "Are you going to lend your
clothes to the theater, M. le Cure? Your new cassock. You! who will hold
mass at midnight â "
"Truly. I do not ask so much." protested Artemon, confused, while the
cure laid the cassock on his arm. "A_n old cassock Â«ââ¢ â¢Id serve my pur
pose. I beg that you will not deprive yourself."

not call forth ridicule."
"How can we ever prove our gratitude?" said the actor, his eyes actu
ally filled with tears, and he reiterated his thanks until he had crossed tha
threshold of the door.
"My dear follow," said the cure, in a trembling voice, fearing to ap
pear to place a price upon his kindness, "go as quickly as possible, accom-J
plish what you have to do, and return when the performance is over to'
attend the midnight mass. The good God will thus be satisfied with you,
and I also."
On thi3 evening Artemon fairly vibrated with emotions, surpassing him
self in his acting.
When, before the gloriously Illuminated altar, the good pastor extended
his arms lovingly above the crowd kneeling before him, he trembled with
Joy to perceive, at the lower end of the lateral aisle, among the workmen:
and Inborers, a group of men and women with weary faces and varied]

poor people had also arranged a little surprise for their benefactor, and
the weak but expressive voice of Valeric sang with warmth the "Christ

"Prace or. earth and good will toward men. Hosanna in the highest!".
The Ahbe T,amier. in an ecptacy of mercy and love, raised his dazzled
eyes toward the vaulted roof, and seemed to see at this sacred moment
among the quivering wings of the angels and the sparkle of the stars, the
luminous smile of the Savior who walked upon the roads of Samaria' and
Galilee surrounded by the miserable and worthless, and whose feet the
sinful woman had wiped with her golden hair.

GOOD CHRISTMAS DINNERS
Ghristmas Jable
Decorations.
THE color scheme for the Christ
mas decorations should be a sim
ple one. Red is the most effective
and appropriate shade. It throws
a rich glow over all, so whether tha
night be clear and chill or dismal and
damp, the room has a warm, inviting
look.
Shun hothouse plants for the Christ
mas dinner table. The florist will offer
you hothouse roses and carnations. But
turn a deaf ear to his arguments and
shut your eyes to the gorgeous beauty
of his offerings. Select instead the wild
mistletoe, the holly, the cedar with its
berries, the hardy winter Christmas
ferns, the trailing pine and the dainty
manzanita.
These can be gathered in armfuls
across the bay if the usual depleted
holiday purse makes the florists impos
sible. The garlands and wreaths will
look more beautiful and smell sweeter
If you have picked them yourself.
Be careful not to overcrowd the table
with decorations. Do not raise a mound
in the center, which stands as immova
ble as the pyramids of old, an everlast
ing discomfort to those seated around
the table. It cuts off the view of ..ne
happy faces and makes peek-boo a ne
cessity if one would look at his vis-a-
ViÃ.
Use the trailing ferna, that cool and
green in their graceful, slender length
make of the table a de..cate lattice
work. Do not spoil the effect by a table
cloth. Under each plate place a pretty
ioily.

as a two-year-old in Juno, 1{ Brooklyn, v
n a no-account race over a poor Held in a canter.
He first began to bo considered by the handicapper
after his next race ;:t Bro< kiyn. in which at five fur
longs he beat a field in which Previous and General
Maceo were favorites over him.
Stake was the first part of the Double
Event at "Sheepshead, in which ho was called on too
soon by Wilhitr. who was up. and ran third to Bowl
ing Brook and Laudeman. These two bang-tails were
n in a common canter by Hamburg in his next
Ftako. the Great Trial Stake. The second part of the
Double Efrent was also landed over practically the
camp field.
The seen" ?h mburg won
his first two races easily, beating Archduke with the
others. In the Grand Union Hotel Stakes, however,
Hamburg was second to Archduke. Back to New
York Hamburg was assigned top-weight in every race.
Requital beat him in the Flight Stakes, but Requital
is an old campaigner. Previous, with Sloan up, also
beat Hamburg in the Flatbush Stakes at seven fur
longs. The Autumn Stakes, however, went to Ham
burgs with 129 pounds up, Archduke second.
Hamburg's last race, and the one that settled the
tion of the two-year-old supremacy, was the Great

Is in the saddle, and giving away anywhere from
10 to 30 pounds to the crack two-year-olds of the year,
Hamburg, with Taral up, won the race from start to
finish in a jog. In this race the bookies laid 8 to 6
ist Hamburg.
During his racing career Hamburg started in six
teen races, winning twelve, was second three times
and third once. His purse and stake winnings foot
up the sum of $37,175. He won the Great Trial Stakes,
second section of the Double Event, Autumn and Great
Eastern Handicap, at Sheepshead; the Flash and Con-
Hall at Saratoga; the Rising Generation and
at Brighton, and the Prospect and Excelsia
- at the recent Gr..vesend meeting. He ran third
to Bowling Brook and Laudeman in the first section
of the Double Event at Sheepshead, was second to
Archduke in Saratoga's Grand Union Stakes, and at
Sheepshead recently he finished behind Requital in
the Flight and Previous in the Flatbush.
Story of St. Gatien.
The offer of St. Gatien revived an old story, with
Tvhich few of the present racegoers are familiar. The
stud books show that he is by Rotherhill or The Rover,
but in Ireland, where the latter horse stood, it is as
. that The Rover was responsible for St. Gatien.
When Si. Gatien ran his sensational dead heat for the
English Derby with Harvester, The Rover's owner,
a man nair^d Daniel Shine of Listowell. County Kerry,
Ireland, was in financial straits, and the Sheriff's offi
cers seized The Rover, whose a* iroximate value had
been much increased by St. Gatien's showing in the
blue ribbon event. Party feeling was at fever heat
in County Kerry at the time, and, although the officers
upposed to be keeping close tabs on their prize,
they found The Rover lying dead in his stall one morn
ing with his throat cut.
In addition to his dead heat for the Derby St. Gatien

tinguished herself by driving a "uni

Mrs. Will Crocker and Mrs. Will
Tevis are also excellent horsewomen,
though they are so engrossed in social
duties that they give less time to the
sport than was their custom formerly.
Mrs. Joseph Tobin is a remarkably
graceful rider, as is also Mrs. Fannie
Lent. Mrs. Lent and Miss M. A. Far
quharson are fellow directors in tho
Riding Club and most enthusiastic
members of that exclusive organization.
Among our other society belles who
are actively interested and proficient in
horseback riding are Miss Caro
Crockett. Miss Edna Hopkins, Miss
Helen Hopkins, Miss Florence Stone,
Miss Therese Morgan an.d Miss Marie
"Wells. All of these young ladies are
extremely fond of this most healthful,
invigorating and delightful exercise,
and not one of them has been content
to merely learn how to sit in the saddle
properly and guide a well mannered
horse along a quiet way. They are
all riders worthy the name, even here
In California, where to be classed as a
really good rider requires that one
should be possessed of little less than
genius in that particular line.

Schofield, of Palo Alto was noted dur

non-professional feminine athlete in
California. She was captain of the
celebrated Stanford basket-ball team,
and was a leader in all the athletic
games and sports indulged in by the
co-eds of that famous institution. More
than this she was and is a most in
trepid rider of horses whether they be
gentle or fiery, amiable or vicious,
trained or untrained. She can put a
horse through his paces whatever they
may be, her seat is firm and her hand
and eye steady. No leap that is pos
sible has any terrors for her, and she
delights in a 'cross country dash as
thoroughly as did the late spirited and
fearless Austrian Empress in the zenith
of her youth and strength.
The young ladies of Sacramento are
also fond of equestrianism and the level
roads outside the city are often made
gay by "horseback parties," the mem
bers of which organize and carry out
impromptu races and "take" fences and
ditches with great spirit and much
friendly rivalry. .Of the Sacramento
riders who have won particular dis-
tinction are Miss Genevieve Henry,
Miss Augustine dv Milieu, Miss Graco
Farnsworth and Miss Bertha Gardner
and Miss May Heath of Oak Grove.
In the country districts of California
the young woman who cannot ride is
an exception to the general rule. While
riding schools do not flourish outside
the cities, the country girl ordinarily
learns to keep her seat on a saddleless
horse at a very early age and upon thia
foundation builds wisely and well.

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1898.no_text18
Henry T. Ga^c. Governor elect â I wish the "Monarch (?)
of the Dailies" would swear off being rude to me.
Luc lit Qnge âSwearing isn't nice; papa says so. I never heard
it, but I've heard other things â singing and dancing and theaters. If
my papa knows how I'll ask him to swear for me, and then I'll tell
you whether I like it.
Oh, if swearing off means making up your mind to stop a
thing, I know what I wijh. I want my cousin, Miss Jennie Eastman,
to swear off making me do my lessons.
G-nrsr C. H Hi. Consu for Twhey â To be candid with you,
I must confess that I care little if any one "swears off" any "old
thing" or not, as long as I am permitted to refrain from doing so my
self.
.1/ !â â  '/â¢ -I i j)i 'ft D. Phrlan âh is customary for well-meaning
San Franciscans to "swear off" the doing of things which they con
sider prejudicial to their or others' well being at the beginning of the
year, and so it is that San Francisco, like a certain ancient and popu
lous resort of which we read, is "paved with good intentions." Now,
I have my doubts as to the merits of that kind of a pavement. It is
bservation in city affairs that later in the year a contract is in
variably let for keeping H in repair. It seems that this pavement docs
not stand the pressure of various kinds of traffic to which it is sub
jected. ''Resolutions of intention" are so often followed by b;id
work that I think that, in my official capacity, I should condemn "in
tentions" as a pavement and refuse, in the light of experience, to give
moral support to the ".swearing off process" which is invoked so often
by political offenders at the beginning of the calendar year, or imme
diately preceding an election. It is the fiscal year that counts. It is
generally believed that the City Fathers, to whom we look for every
thing that is good and wise, never "swear off" after they arc sworn in.
School Director Bam Wn let â If the newspapers will swear
off roasting me J will promise not to swear off anything myself. 1
know the people would rather have me as I am.
Coun'u Clâ¬rk-lÂ»r.t W U 2>* aneâ There is one man, and
only one, whom I should like to swear off. He is the man who makes
me swear until the navy blue atmosphere in the office frightens the
deacons. That man is the "job-chaser." Life will be one iong hlaven
of bliss if this multitudinous individual, the "job-chaser." will swear
off on me. I don't care whether he swears off on the other office
holders or not.
CharU* Wrleh. B*cr*fewy />' ard of E&vei i<tn~l wish
the school-teachers would swear off demanding their salaries three
days before they are due. I don't see why they don't swear off demand

There are those who would like to ask Sam Waller to swear off" think
ing lie is the entire Board of Education. Don't confuse me with those
people.

CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIANS.
THE Californian loves his State be
cause his State loves him, and
he returns her love with a fierce
affection that men of other re
gions are slow to understand,
iienee he ie impatient of outside criti
cism. Those who do not love California
cannot understand her, and, to his
mind, their bhafts, however aimed, fly
wide of the mark. Thus, to say that
California is commercially asleep, that
her industries are gambling ventures,
that her local politics is in the hands
of professional pickpockets, that her
small towns are the shabbiest in Chris
tendom, that her saloons control more
constituents than her churches, that
she is the slave of corporations, that
she knows no such thing as public
opinion, that she has not yet learned to
distinguish enterprise from highway
robbery nor reform from blackmail â
all these things and many more the
Californian may admit in discussion or
may say himself, but he does not find
them acceptable from others. They
may be more or less^true, in certain
times and places, but the conditions
which have permitted them will like
wise mend them. It is said in the Alps
that "not all the vulgar people who
come to Chamouni can ever make
Chamounl vulgar." For similar rea
sons, not all the sordid people who drift
overland can ever vulgarize California.
Her fascination endures, whatever the
accidents of population.
The charm of California has, in thÂ»
main, three sources â scenery, climate
and freedom of life.
To know the glory of California
scenery one must live close to it
through the changing years. From Sis
kiyou to San Diego, from Me>.idoch:o
to Mariposa, from Tahoe to the Far
allones, lake, crag, or chasm, forest,
mountain, valley, or island, river, bay,
or jutting headland, every one bears
the stamp of its own peculiar beauty, a
singular blending of richness, wildness
and warmth. Coastwise everywhere sea
and mountains meet, and the surf of
the cold Japanese current breaks in
turbulent beauty against tall "rin
cones"' and jagged reefs of rock. Slum
bering amid the hills of the Coast
Range,
"A miPty camp of mountains pitched
lumultuously,"
Lie golden valleys dotted with wide
limbed oaks, or smothered under over
weighted fruit trees. Here, too, crum
ble to ruin.s the old Franciscan mis
sions, passing monuments of Califor
nia's first page of written history.
To a very unusual degree the Cali
fornian forms his own opinion on mat
ters of politics, religion and human life,
and these views he expresses without
reserve. His own head he "carries un
der his own hat," and whether this be
silk or a sombrero is a matter of his
own choosing. The dictates of church
and party have no binding force on him.
The Califnrnian does not confine his
views to abstractions, xie has his own
opinions of individual men and women.
If need be, he will analyze the charac
ter, motives, and actions of his neigh
bor in a way which will horrify the
traveler who has grown up in the shade
of a libel law.
The typical Californian has largely
outgrown provincialism. He has seen
much of the world, and he knows the
varied worth of varied lands. He tra
vels more widely than the man of any
other State, and he has the education
â which travel gives. As a rule, the \v.ii
to-do Californian knows Europe better
than the average Plastern man of equal
financial resources, and the chances are
that his range of experience includes a
part of Asia as well. A knowledge of
his own country is a matter of course.
He has no sympathy with "the essen
tial provinciality of the mind which
knows the Eastern seaboard, and has
some measure of acquaintance with
countries and cities, and with men from
Ireland to Italy, but which is densely
ignorant of our own vast domain, and
thinks thnt all that lies beyond Phila
delphia belongs to the West." Not that
provincialism is unknown in California.
or that its occasional exhibition is any
less absurd or offensive here than else
where. For example, one may note a
tendency to set up local standards for
literary work done in California. An.
other, more harmful idea would insist
that methods outworn in the schools
elsewhere are good becaupe they are
Californian. This is the usual provin
cialism of ignorance, and it is found the
world ov<-r. Especially is it character
istic of centers of population. Whin
men come into contact with men in
stead of with the forces of nature, they
mistake their own conventionalities fur
the fa^fs of existence. ft is not what
life Is, but what "the singular mess we
agree to call life" is, that interests
them. In this fashion they lose their
real understanding of affairs, become
the "toys of th â¢ local environment and
are marked as provincials or tenderfeet
when they stray away from home.
California is emphatically one of
earth s male lands," to accept Brown

didate for the Senate.
R. PnrhÂ»r AikÂ», State Senator el retâ l should like the
Chief of Police to swear off being Chief of Police.
Attorney Eug'nc, BeupreyâAS the good prophets on elec
tion results should swear off once and for all. I have sat at their feet,
listened to their auguries, and thereby hangs a sorry tale.
Raphael W^'ii â l am afraid it would be asking Barbour Lathrop
too much to request him to stop talking. For he must live up to his
reputation as the man of "iron jaw."
Rabbi Nirtoâ The politicians ought to swear off interchanging
doubtful complimentsâ especially since they don't mean a word of it.

may not have to burn midnight oil, but I must often pour the morning
milk. I'm not exactly looking for trouble, but I find it. This hunting
for adulterations is not unadulterated bliss.

ing's classification. The first Saxon
settlers were men, and in their rude
civilization women had no part. For
years women in California were objects
of curiosity or of chivalry, disturbing
rather than cementing inlluences in so
ciety. Even yet California is essen
tially a man's State. It is common to
say that puMic opinion does not exist
there; but such a statement is not whol
ly correct. It does exist, but it is an
out-of-door public opinion â a man's
view of men. There is, for example, a
strung public opinion against hypocrisy,
in California, as more than one clerical
renegade has found, to his discomfiture.
The pretense to virtue is the one vice
that is not forgiven. If a man be not
a liar, few questions are asked, least
all the delicate one as to the "name he
went by in the States." What we com
monly call public opinion â the cut-and
dried decision on social and civic ques
tions â is made up in the house. It
is essentially feminine in its origin, the
opinion of householders as to how m^ri
should b' have. In California ther^ is
little which corresponds to the social
atmosphere pervading the snug, white
painted, green-blinded New Englani
villages, and this little exists chiefly in
communities of people transported thi
ther in blockâ traditions, convention
alities, prejudices and all. There is, in
general, no merit attached to conform
ity, and one may take a wide range of
rope without necessarily arousing dis
trust. Speaking broadly, in California
the virtues of life spring from within,
and are not prescribed from without.
The young man who is decent only
because he thinks that some one is
looking would do well to stay a\vi.y.
The stern law of individual responsi
bility turns the fool over to the fool
killer without a preliminary trial. No
liner type of man can be found in the
world than the sober Californian; nnd
yet no coast is strewn with wrecks
more pitiful.
There axe some advantages in the ab
sence of "a compelling force of public
opinion. One of them is found in the
strong self-reliance of men and women
who have made and enforced their
own moral standards. With very many
men life in California brings a decided
strengthening of the moral fiber. They
must reconsider, justify and fight for
their standards of action; and by so
doing they become masters of them
selves. With men of weak nature the
result is not so encouraging. The bad
side of this iife is shown in lax business
methods, official carelessness and cor
ruption, the widesr.road c rrosions of
vulgar vices, and the general lack of
pride in their work shown by artisans
and craftsmen.
In short, California is a man's land,
with male standards of action â a land
where one must give and t-ke, stand
anJ fall, as a man. With the growth
nf woman's realm of homes and houses
this will slowly change. It is changing
now, year by year, for good and ill;
and soon California will have a public
opinion. Her sons will learn to fear
"the rod behind the looking-glass," and
to shun evil not only because it is vile,
but because it is improper.
In no way has the unearned incre
ment been more mischievous than in
the booming of cities. With the growth,
of towns ctimcÃ increase in the value of
the holdings of those who hold and
wait. If the city grows rapidly enough,
tnese gains may be inordinately great.
The marvelous beauty of Southern Cal
ifornia and the charm of its climate
have impressed thousands of people.
Two or three times this impression has
been epidemic. At one time almost
every bluff along the coast, from Los
Angeles to San Diego and beyond, was
staked out in town lots. The wonderful
climate was everywhere, and every
where men had it for sale, not only
aiong the coat,a t, but throughout the
orange-bearing region of the interior.
Every resident bought lots, all the lots
he could hold. The tourist took his
hand in speculation. Corner lots in San
Diego, Del Mar, Azusa, Redlands,
Riverside, Pasadena, anywhere, brought
fabulous prices. A village was laid out
in the uninhabited bed of a mountain
torreTU, and men stood in the streets in
Loc Angeles, ranged in line, all night
long, to wait their turn in buying tots.
Worthless lanu and inaccessible, barren
cliffs, river-wash, sand hills, cactus de
serts, sinks o- alkali, everything met
with ready sale. The belief that South
ern California would be one great city
was universal. The desire to buy be
came a mani;i. "Millionaires of a day," J
even the shrewdest lost their heads, and j
the boom ended, as' such booms always
end, in utter collapse.
T. 8. Van Dyke of San Diego
has written of this collapse: "The
money market tightened almost on the
instant. From every quarter of the \
land the drain of money ou' ..ard had !
been enormous, and had been balanced i
only by the immense amount constant
ly coining in. Almost from the day this
inflow, ceased money seemed scarce
everywhere, for the outgo still contin
ued. Not only were vast sums going
out every day for water pipe, railroad
iron, cement, lumber and other materi
al for the great improvements going on
in every direOtlon, most of which mate
rial had already been ordered, but thou
sands mure were still going out for dia
monds and a host of other things al
ready boughtâ things that only increase
the general indebtedness of a com
munity by making thosu who cannot af
ford them imitate those who can. And
tens of thousands more were going out
for butter, eggs, pork and even potatoes
and other vegetables, which the luxuri
ous boomers thought it beneath the
dignity of millionaires to raise."
But the normal growth of Los Ange
les and her sister towns has gone on, in
spite of these spasms of fever and their
consequent chills. Their real advan
tages could not be obscured by the
bursting of financial bubbles. By reason
of situation and climate they have con
tinued to attract men of wealth and
enterprise, as well au those in search of
homes and health.
The search for the unearned incre
ment In bodily health brings many to
California who might better have re
mained at home. The invalid finds
health in California only it he is strong
enough to grasp it. To one who can
spend his life out of doors it is indeed
true that "our pines are trees of heal
ing," but to one confined to the house,
there is little gain in the new condi
tions. To those accustomed to the close
heat of Eastern rooms the California
house in the winter seems depresÃingly
chilly.
I know of few things more pitiful
than the annual migration of hopeless
consumptives to Los Angeles, Pasadena
and San Diego. The Pullman cars in
the winter are full of sick people, ban
ished from the East by physicians who
do not know what else to do with their
incurable patients. They go to the large
hotels of Los Angeles or Pasadena and
pay a rate they cannot afford. They
shiver in half- warmed rooms; take cold
after cold; their symptoms grow alarm
ing; their money wastes away; and
finally, in utter despair, they are hur
ried back homeward, perhaps to die on
board the train. Or it may be that they
choose cheap lodging-houses, at prices
more nearly within their reach. Here
again they suffer for want of home
food, home comforts and home warmth,
and the end is Just the same. People
hopelessly ill should remain with their
friends; even California has no health
to give to those who cannot earn it, in
part at least, by their own exertions.
It is true that the "one-lunged peo
ple" form a considerable part of the
population of Southern California. It
is also true that no part of our Union
has a better population, and that many
of these men and women are now as
robust and vigorous as one could desire.
But this happy change is possible only
to those in the first stages of the dis
ease. Out-of-door life and physical ac
tivity enable the system to suppress the
germs of disease, but climate without
activity does -.ot cure. So far as cli
mate is concerned, many parts of the
arid regions in Arizona, New Mexico
and Colorado are more favorable than
California, because they are protected
from the chill of the sea. Another class
of health-seekers receives less sympa
thy in California, and perhar^ deserves
less. It is made up of jaundiced hypo
chondriacs and neurotic wrecks. These
people shiver in the California winter
boarding-houses, torment themselves
with ennui at the country ranches,
poison themselves with "'nerve foods,"
and perhaps fh.ally survive to write the
sad and squalid "truth about Califor
nia." Doubtless it is all inexpressibly
tedious to them; subjective woe is al
ways hard to bear â but it is not Cali
fornia.
* â¢
With all this, the social life is. in its
essentials, that of the rest of the United
Btatos, for the same blood flows in the
veins of those whose influence domi
nates it. Under all its deviations and
variations lies the old Puritan con
science, which is still the backbone of
the civilization of the republic. Life
there is a little fresher, a little freer, a
good deal richer, In its physical aspects,
but for these reasons, possibly, more in
tensely and characteristically Ameri
can. With perhaps 95 per cent of iden
tity there is 5 per cent of divergence,
and this 5 per cent I have emphasized
even to exaggeration. We know our
friends by their slight differences in
feature or expression, not by their com
mon humanity. Much of this diverg
ence 1b already fading away. Scenery
and climate remain, but there is less
elbow-room, and the unearned incre
ment is disappearing. That which is
solid will endure; the rest will vanish.
The forces that ally us to the East are
growing stronger every year with the
immigration of men with new ideas.
The vigorous growth of the two uni
versities in California insures the ele
vation as well as the retention of these
ideas. In this way, # perhaps, California
may contribute eom'ething to the social
development of the East, and be a
giver as well as a receiver. But to the
last certain traits will persist. It is the
most cosmopolitan of all the States of
the Union, and such it will remain.
Whatever the fates may bring, the peo
ple will be tolerant, hopeful and ade
quate, sure of themselves, masters of
the present, fearless of the future.

I : Kipling in 1579 when he
irs old. In 'that year I joined
the United Sen Be "Westward
a the parish of N'ortham, North
Devon, which had been in existence for
several years. I was at once assigned
to the same house with Kipling under
a master named Pugh, and after a few
terms Kipling was changed to my dor
mitory, over which his particular
ville. was eventually
made sub-prefect. 1 sat at different
times in the same classes with Kipling
and during the last year that 1 spent
i v >.;. my study was im
media >w the one occupied by
.. Dunsterville and Kipling.
The masters referred io in the stories
are Cormell Price, the head master;
\Y. C. Crofts, the classical master, and
M. H. Pugh, the house master, who un
doubtedly suggested the "Pruut" of
whom Kipling speaks.
The I':.. vice College, which
was intended chiefly for the education
of sons Anglo-Indian civil and mili
tary officers, was within sight of the
Atlantic. The immediate neigh
borhood was of a character ta delight
the heart of any boyâ high frowning
cliffs at whose base terrible jagged
rocks ran far out into the sea, as a
warning to vessels of their sure fate
if by any unlucky chance they missed
the bar. These cliffs, however, were
the a Â ral species of rare sea
birds, thus offering a splendid field for
hazardous adventure.
Not a Youthfnl Prodigy.
During these four or five years, as
ms school fellows, it could
han: i that Kipling appeared
to them as a prodigy. In the first pia^e
h^ was always extremely near-sighted,
which was perhaps the reason for his
taking any very keen interest in
either field sports or athleticsâ a profi
ciency that, alone, almost makes an
English boy a hero' in the sight of his
school fellows. Un the other hand Kip
ling was n>'t by any means a "sweat."
He was not always to be seen poring
over his books. He was seldom at the
: his i lass, though to be sure he
was never at the bottom. He did not
take all the prizt-s that came in his
way, and he was not even in due course
promoted to the office erf sub-prefect,
although when he left the college In
ISS2 he carried with him the well
ed first prize in English literature.
Only he did seem to be able to solve a
probi- â¢ minutes over which an
nnpht have labored for an
hour. He was chiefly noticeable in his
school fellows' eyes for a keen wit and
a flow ol language that could only be
suppressed by depriving him. of his
spectacles.
"Stalky, Beetle and McTurk."
About the middle of his school life
Kipling entered into a strong tie of
friendship with two other boys, in
many respects pf his own temperament.
The trio seemed to have aims of their
own apart from the rest of the college,
leading a kind of Bohemian existence,
and amusing themselves by tilts at the
powers that were, in which encounters
they frequentl;' came off victorious, as
related in the "Stalky" stories. At the
time when Kipling and his two chums
were first assigned to a room or
"study" for their own use, the esthetic
wave of some seventeen years ago was
sweeping over English society, and the
three boys at once determined to "live
up" to the prevailing fashion. They first
of all painted a wonderful stork dado
round their room; then they purchased
a number of old plates, spoutless tea
pots and Japanese fans and hung them
upon the walls. They called it very
"nigh art." and for a day the whole
school came to see and wondered.
At the United Service College the
custom prevailed as in most English
"public schools " of placing a great
part of the out-of-class discipline in the
hands of the head boys v ho are called
prefects or monitor?. In particular
these head boys are responsible for the
maintenance of order in the large cor
mltories or sleeping-rooms â one prefect
having charge of perhaps a dozen or
fifteen boys.
Telling Stories at Night.
Now it happens that the prefect of
the dormitory in which Hudyard Kip
ling slept was a great admirer of the
thousand and one stories of the Ara
bian Nights, and conceived the idea
that it would conduce to his early re
pose if he compelled each of the boys
in his room to tell stories in turn. The
idea was at once put into practice, und
the boys told such stories of sport, love
and adventure as the fertility of their
brains brought forth; but it became
quickly apparent that Kipling so far
surpassed the others in that talent that
the prefect insisted upon his telling
stories out of his turn, the result of
which practice would generally be
somewhat as follows:
The light having been extinguished,
the voice of the prefect would be heard:
"Now, then, Gigs, a yarn."
"Gigs" was an abbreviation for gig
lampsâ a nickname conferred upon
Kipling by his school fellows on ac
count of the extraordinarily large spec
tacles he wore.
Therr> would come no response from
the bed In the corner.
(lips! You hear? A yarn."
Still no answer.
"Look here, Gigs, if you don't wake
up I'llâ "
An expostulating voice from under

Protestlngly, "Hut I say, it's not my
Dictatorfally, "I don't care if it isn'tâ
a yarn." After which there would per
hapfl fdlow a pause of five minutes,
when the voice of the prefect would be
heard again, "All right. Gigs, you

"I say/ 1 from Kipling, by this time

"I don't know any."
Prom the prefect: "Oh, yes, you do;
anyway I'll give you a skeleton.

pirate, got wrecked on an island, where
he fought a battle against a lot of say

am. lived happily ever afterward.
Now go on."
With a grunt of dissatisfaction Kip
ling would thereupon begin, shortly,
however, making the prefect the villain
of the- story and placing him in euch
absurd situations that the whole dormi
tory would be shouting with laughter,
and the noise of creaking shoes upon
the stairs would come as a warning:
that the house master was on his way
to see into the nocturnal disturbance.
As a College Editor
For two years Rudyard Kipling oc
cupied the editorial chair of the United
Service College Chronicle, during which
period many bright verse i and clever
articles from his pen appeared within
the pages of that little journal. This
was entirely an honorary position,
which, however led to an engagement
on the local paper under novel and
amusing circumstances. The head mas
ter of the college, apart from his scho
lastic duties, held the office of chair
man of the local board â partaking of
the nature of n unpaid rural super
visorship, with perhaps a little patron
age attached that somebody or other
was anxious to possess.
This ambitious person succeeded in
gaining the assistance of the editor of
the local paper. The consequence was
that, for a time, a number of crudely
virulent personal attacks were made
the policy of the board, to all of
which the head master paid no atten
tion whatever. Then the editor, prob
ably having seen some of Kipling's
work in the college paper, entered into
an arrangement with him. that for
the sum of $2 50 a week the latter
should do his best to goad the head
master into the indiscretion of a re
tort
A Newspaper Contest With Head Master.
It was not long, therefore, before de
nunciatory articles appeared in the pa
per, treating of the board's local drain
age scheme in such poignant, sarcastic
terms that everybody began to talk
about the matter, and the head master
was compelled to take up his pen in
self-defenseâ a literary duel thus com
mencing between the all unconscious
master and his pupil, that afforded
those who were in the secret a weekly
fund of amusement.
Eventually the head master resigned
his chair, but whether he dlscovere i
the personality of his brilliant antag
onist i? not known. Had he done so.
"It Was Courage Gone Mad; a Hundred Hands and More Bore on the Fag; Then Down It Went With Not a Hand Left to Raise It, and the Field Was
Carpeted With the Dead. The Li^e of That Charge Was Never Seen Before, Not Even in the Soudan."
there is a probability that young Kip
ling would have been painfully made
aware of the fact, as the cane and the
birch are still important factors in
English "public" school discipline.
When a looking glass fir^t engages
the serious attention of a youth, a
somewhat ludicrous devotion to the
wardrobe is often the result. In that
respect. Kipling and his two particular
chums inclined to ward the Bohemian,
until they perceived in the opposite ex
treme a chance to enact a good part.
which, for the time being, afforded
their companions no little amusement.
At the United Service College it haD
pened that there was a certain classical
master who had developed a profound
aversion to anything approaching fop
pishness, and to whom fancy waist
coats, sporting scarfpins and silk hand
kerchiefs were an abomination second
only to what was termed the "modern"
side of the school.
Having Sport With the Master.
To such an extent did this master
carry his discrimination in the matter
of clothes that those attending his
classes or coming more particularly un
der his jurisdiction, who evinced the
least tendency to "style" were promptly
made the butts of his most withering
sarcasm, and were even occasionally
peremptorily ordered not to appear
again in his presence wearing conspicu
ously offensive garments. Now Kipling
and his two chums in the course of
THE SA.N 1 I{A:nCTSCO (\\IYL. SI'XBAY, JDECEMISEK 18, 1898.
promotion at length found themselves
brought into daily contact with this
master, and having duly made note of
his supreme aversion, they proceeded
to stimulate it after their own fashion.
So it Bhortly came to be noticed that
the Kipling trio were putting on
"style"â a fact that the master in ques
tion noticed also, but concerning which
he contented himself with scornful re
marks, until a shilling bottle of over
powering perfume was the direct cause
of an explosion of wrath, of the class
room windows being thrown wide open
one cold winter morning, and of some
thing besides invectives being hurled
at the offenders' heads.
In spite of this emphatic rebuff Kip
ling and his chums continued their ef-
forts to approach the extreme height
of fashion, borrowing such likely gar
ments as they did not themselves pos
sess, and choosing Sunday as the day
on which to make a brave display of
their personal adornments, for the
three sat close to the classical master
in church. Again, fur a time, the mas
ter confined himself to sneering re
marks; but three pairs <~>f light, cloth
topped patent leather shoes brought
the matter to a climax.
On the particular Sunday when the
shoes were first worn, the classical
master quickly spied them out, and
having beckoned the three youths be
fore him, pointed to the objectionable
articles and desired to be informed as
to their precise nature.
"Which things, sir?" asked Kipling,
following with his gaze the direction
indicated by the classical master's fore
finger, and wonderingly surveying the
floor as if he expected to behold some
strange insects crawling there. "Which
things, sir?"
"Those things." emphatically replied
the master, pointing to Kipling's feet.
"My feet, sir?" asked Kipling, as if
he were still in doubt as to the master's
exact meaning.
"No, the vile things you've got on
them." angrily explained the former.
"Go and take them off at once. At
once! D'you understand me?"
Whereupon the Kipling trio divested
themselves of their beautiful shoes,
and the classical master posted a house
notice to the effect that patent leather
shoes, among other enumerated "fop
pish" articles of dress, were henceforth
strictly prohibited. As if in despair
at the'sweeping nature of this edict the
Kipling trio immediately reverted to
the her < xtrl&ne, and the next Sunday
ared at the church callover as if
had slept in their best clothes over
night, with only their shoes so wonder
fully V',!isHed that the classical master
first mistook them for the contraband
patent leathers.
On closer inspection, however, being
satisfied that his surmise was incorrect,
and perhaps regarding the trio's dis
hevel ranee as. for once, a
backward step in the ri-ht direction,
hp merely recommended a vigorous ap
plication of th( brush, and unsuspect
ingly permitted them to go on their
\\;lv to church.
It was not long after the service had
commenced before every one in the
vicinity ex the Kipling trio became con
scious "of a most pungent and sicken
ing odor of blacking, the classical mas
ter who sat next to Kipling being the
nrÂ«t of course, to sniff the air with
suspicion. But as the church warmed
up the smell became so altogether un
bearable that the classical master, cast
ing a look of supreme disgust upon the
remarkably devout and apparently
quite Innocent youths at his side, hur
riedly rose from his seat and sought
refuge in another part of the church.
Then as the other boys near by
crammed their handkerchiefs into their
mouths to suppress explosions of laugh
ter, a . merry twinkle beamed out
through Gig's enormous spectacles. It .
was generally thought that the three
would meet with a swift and terrible
punishment; but the classical master,
for some reason, decided to hold his
peace, and thereafter permitted the
edict regarding foppishness to fall into
abeyance. .

HOST FANATICAL CHARGE
THE WILD SOUDAN EVER SAW
hcrch of Stating Dervishes Walked Right Up to Cer
tain Death Shouting for Their Prophet and
Ef Koran.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â There is
now visiting relatives in this
city a middle-aged man who
lately came from the Soudan,
where he took part in the an
nihilation of the Mahdi's
army at Omd â man on September 2
last. He knows what wild fighting is
as he saw six years' service on the
plains against the Indians before he
went back and enlisted in the British
army.
He gives the following graphic ac
count of the first part of t- battle of
Omdurman:
"I never saw anything like it and I've
seen some lighting in my time out
West on the plains before I went back
to her Majesty's service. Nor you never
saw anything like it and you have Been
some service, too. Nor none of you.
Nor nobody that wasn't there at the
time.
"There never was anything like it, at
least in our time.
"They talk about the Old Guard at
Waterloo. They were brave men, all
right and good enough, and stood their
ground and the last man died where
he stood. They could have shown 'the
white' if they had wanted to, but they
didn't want to. They were game to the
death. But they could give as good as
they got, barring numbers, and they
were hemmed in and circled about so
they couldn't run; none braver than
they were.
"But these Dervishes beat all. We
knew the 'beggars' (Tommy Atkins'
modification of Baggaras, who consti
tuted a large part of the Mahdi's fight
ing force) could fight, and would fight.
We had seen enough for that at Firket,
Atbara and other places, but then their
chances were better; they had some
show, could hit back as it were. But
it wasn't that way at Omdurman. At
Atbara we were the attacking party
and they could lie behind their zerebas
and shoot until we broke in and routed
them up at the point of the bayonet,
when they used their spears and swords
as well as they could; a few that were
left ran away, but a lot found sure
death where they stood.
"But at Omdurman it was all dif
ferent. They came right on to certain
death, walking, as it were, over their
own dead bodies, and knowing they
couldn't help themselves.
"Order! Not much. No more than
one would see in a herd of cattle, mov
ing across the plains, but there was a
certain show of fixed resolve and regu
lar purpose that made one feel queer
when he knew that they were coming
at him. Not that we were scared. Not
a bit of it. We could have no doubt
of the result. We knew our strength.
We knew what we could do and we
knew what they couldn't do. That was
the main thing. We knew that they
had a long way to come over good open
ground well under the range of our
Maxims and rifles, to say nothing of
our field batteries, which were in good
positions and all ready, while they, poor
"beggars," could do us little hurt until
they got right up to close quarters, if
they ever did, as they had few guns
that would carry any distance and
most of them had only spears and
swords.
"What were they counting on? Well,
I can't say, unless it was on their num
bers. There was a lot of them, too, but
not enough for the work that they had
cut out for themselves â poor 'beggars.'
They could not have dreamed of what
they were running up against.
"About the battle? Well, maybe I
haven't said much about the battle;
that is the rest of it, but I've told you
something about the first of it. What
came afterward was a kind of finish,
up, as it were. Fighting done after
ward? Yes! Plenty of it, but nothing
like that 'first charge." I'll never for
get that sight in all my living days. It
can hardly be called a fight. Too one
sided, but there was lots of gun firing
on our side and lots of dead and wound
ed on the other. Why, the field In front
of our center was literally carpeted
with white, mixed ail up with black,
where the bare arms and legs of the
poor "beggars' showed out, and here and
there a horse or two. Some of them,
chiefs, sheiks and emirs, they call them,
rode on horseback. It was a sight to
last one man ail the rest of his life.
"How many killed? Well, to speak
by the card, I should say just all of
them. That is. all that were in the
way of It. All that started across that
open space toward our lines. I didn't
see any going back. How many? I
don't just know. I never counted them.
I don't suppose anybody else did very
closely. Just guessed at the number.
The papers will tell you what the guess
was, I just tell you what I know. Ail
of them were killed. Five, seven or ten
thousand; just as many as started. All
of them killed, that is, sooner or later.
Of course, a good many were just
wounded at first, but they were all dead
men before the thing was over. You
don't need field hospitals for those
'beggars.' They never quit till they are
dead. So you see the enemy's loss is
made up of two items â killed and pris
oners, and these last are not so many.
The Sirdar knows hi business.
"The battle was on a Friday, Well, on
Wednesday night ive were camped near
the river, about twelve miles below Ora
durman. A heavy storm came up with
much thunder and lightning and the
rain just poured do\.n. In the midst
of it all at daybreak we struck our
tents and started on the march again.
Every man of us was wet through and
through. We had had wo rest, not a bit
of sleep, and were pretty well worn out,
though we had full stomachs and
plenty more within easy- reach. The
whole army, about 28,000 men, was well
under way by 5 o'clock. The march
ing was heavy sure enough. The mud
was so "sticky" that when you lifted
your foot a great mass of it hung on
and made you step short. We began
to feel better, though, when just before
noon the sun came out, and after go-
Ing a short distance farther we went
into camp just above the little old town
of Kerreri, about six miles from Ora
durman, where the battle was fought
the next <la>. We halted about half
past 1 o'clo-k in the afternoon, Thurs
day, September 1.
â¢ "Our line extended In a kind of a half
circle, about two and a half miles, with
both ends resting on the river.
''The position was a good one. The
rround was a little high and sloped
easily away to the west, offering no
cover to an enemy except here and
there a slight depression, a few feet
below the general surface, as far as
the hills, the nearest of which, Jebel
Surgham, lay a little to the southwest
about a mile and a quarter distant.
A little farther away, directly to the
west and opposite our center, ran a
range of hills parallel to the river for
some three or four miles.
"On our extreme left next to the river
and nearest the city, which was In plain
sight, was our artillery and the Brit
ish brigade, with the Twenty-first Lan
cers in the rear of their right. Next in
the circle came the 'Fuzzy Wuzzles,"
or the Soudanese, our black brothers
in arms. Fighters, too, they were.
Then next and extending on around to
the river again were the 'Gippies,' or
the Egyptian division, as they are of
ficially called. The supply boats were
in the river behind us, and the gun
boats out in the stream, near our left.
"We had early supper and early to
bed. The night went off quite quietly
and we had a good rest. At early
dawn, say 3:30 a. m., we were roused
and stood to arms. The cavalry went
out to take a look about, and we be
gan breaking the zereba in places to
march through. Soon one of the gun
boats fired a shell into the city, and
just after the cavalry came galloping:
back and we knew the thing was about
on; and so It was. Just after 8 o'clock
we heard a mighty noise of more yell
ing, shouting and singing, and soon we
caught si"ht of them without num
ber, first to the right of Jebel Surgham
and then to the left, lapping all around
our front. Some few were on horse
back, but the great mass were on foot.
They carried a number of flags on long
poles, which they kept waving as they
advanced.
"When they were within about 1900
yards the artillery began on them, and
many a well directed shell left a batch
of them to mark where it burst. When
they had gotten within lÂ£oo yarda we
began with our rifles and then the
Maxims, shortening the range sights as
they came. They did little firing, but
Just kept coming. They were soon
within short range and were Just
mowed down, but those that fell were
not missed, the mass was so dense. I
did not see much of what went on ex
cept just in front of me. That spec
tacle just held mv sight bound to It.
"Closer and closer, ever growing fewer
and few. they came.
"Just before us was ono specially at
tractive group. A young black man,
evidently a chief, mounted on a splen
did dark bay. rode in the front of the
main mass, waving a sword in his
hand and shouting 'Allah Akbar.'
which means God is great. On his left
an old white bearded fellow kept pace
with the horse, carrying a large white
flag, which he kept waving as he
shouted. With them, beside and be
hind, pressed the throng of white tur
bans and bla<;k faces, even yet mom
than you could reckon, but dropping by
scores at every step. Well, they
brought that flag right up to within
300 yards of our line. A hundred hand!
and more had had it. and there it went
down, but only when there was no
hand left to hold it up. All had gone
down. The field was carpeted, indeed,
with the dead.
"The like of the 'last charge' was
never seen before, not even in the Sou
dan."

they are little better than caricatures

of this type of portrait was painted in
1816 by the artist Probasco, of whom
little or nothing further is known. The
picture is a fine oil painting, and is at
present in the hands of the heirs of the
late Judge Lawrence of Lowell, Mass..
who reside about fifty miles west of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1898.
MAYOR PHELAN,
OUR CITY:
By Mayor James D. Phelan.
â¢â¢HE achievements of Dewey, the acquisition by conquest and annexa
/^ tion of the Philippines and Hawaii have all given a new direction to
\J the thoughts of our citizens. This eventful year has drawn their at
tention to the great possibilities of San Francisco as a distributing cen
ter. It has turned their faces to the sea.
When any of the great countries bordering on the Pacific are stirred
to activity by the opening of mines or the upbuilding of manufactures. San
Francisco, as though she were in electrical communication with the re
motest parts, feels every pulse- beat.
This demonstrates the fact that San Francisco, by reason of her position
as the ch^ef port of the United States on the Pacific Ocean, is the natural
emporium of every land served by Balboa's sea.
The Alaska movement last summer found a responsive chord in San
Francisco, and gave to our merchants a new and unexpected trade, awak
ening healthfully our local activities.
Mills in China have drawn to this port from the Southern States vast
shipments of cotton, which speedily go forward in many ships to the
Orient.
The desire of the Japanese to imitate western methods has brought
them naturally to San Francisco for a large part of their trade, and to
day they are constructing In our shipyards vessels of war. and. side by
side, messengers of peace are being constructed for distant intercourse with
the islands of the Pacific.
The Trans-Siberian Railroad, which will find its terminus at Vladivos
tok, will result in a new line of steamers to San Francisco. The possible
dismemberment of the Chinese Empire by the Russians, the Germans, the
French and the English, or the nolicy of "the open door," will do much to
make the Pacific Ocean the theater of commercial enterprise, paralleled only
by the past experience of the Atlantic.
California, with its 700 miles of sea coast, will be the beneficiary, in a
large measure, of this great change now impending, and when we recall
the fact that the Pacific Ocean has a surface of 76,000,000 miles of water,
over which every country has a free right of way, without let or hindrance,
we cannot but foresee the ultimate realization of our destiny.
San Francisco is 4600 miles rrom Yokohama, and 6100 miles from Hong
kongâless by more than one-half the distance between those points and
the great maritime ports of Europe.
San Francisco is in the most direct course between the ports of Asia
and the Nicaragua Canal, and perhaps a vessel will save 2000 miles of sail-
Ing by touching at San Francisco rather than the Hawaiian Islands, which
are popularly, but erroneously, believed to be a more convenient calling
station between the remote East and the Far West.
The construction of the Nicaragua Canal is bound to give immediate
and marvelous impetus to every substantial interest of commercial San
Francisco and of productive California. It will save 10,000 miles of the sea
route between this port and New York.
The political activity of the Hawaiian Islands is sure to result In even
closer relations between our city and that fertile group, secure of a future
place in the sisterhood of States.
If California receives, she must also give; and from her natural re-
Bources and from her manufactures, which will be stimulated by the de
mands of the commerce of the Pacific, there can be no question as to
the ability of the State to respond to every call made upon it. But from
the point of view of commerce, the advantages possessed by San Francisco,
as a distributing center must be sedulously cultivated, and, if wisely done,
the "Pacific opportunity" will alone suffice for the greatness of its future.
The year then just ending has turned our eyes to the sea. Secure in
mines, grains and fruits, we look for new fields to conquerâ we look to
commerce.
Venice in the height of her maritime success, "When her merchants
were Princes and her traffickers were the noble of the earth," annually
wedded, with gorgeous ceremony, the beautiful Adriatic. Let California
now inaugurate the ceremony for our city. Too long has the flirtation
lasted. Let us wed the Pacific in good faith and await the issue of the
union.
OUR COMMERCE :
By F. W. Dofrmann
REVIEW of the commerce and industries of San Francisco during
J I the past year and an opinion of their future prospects presents a
subject of greater magnitude than can be fully or justly treated
1 â¢Â»â¢ within my limited time and ability. During my absence of nearly
the entire year I visited many parts of the United States and Eu
rope, and a compariaon of commercial and industrial conditions clearly
shows, notwithstanding last winter's drought, that 1898 has been the most
satisfactory year since 1892.
Considerable fear and anxiety prevail lest we have another dry winter,
with possible failure of crops, scarcity of money with farmers, resulting in
accumulation of debts instead of discharging mortgages, as well as re
trenchment In comforts and improvements. Shrinkage of business and
profits would naturally follow, as our commercial and industrial interests
depend mainly upon our coast trade and home prosperity. This uncer
tainty already affects the volume of trade in many wholesale lines, and if
continued will certainly reduce holiday retail business as well. Under such
adverse conditions buyers are cautious and a habit of closeness becomes
contagious. Let us, therefore, fervently hope that ere this may be published
bounteous rains will have restored the confidence of our people, so that our
farmers may rejoice at their prospective harvests and our dealers at their
customary holiday trade.
Regarding our immediate future, I feel assured, even with a dry season
and small crops, that we will have a fair year, so far as trade on this coast
is concerned. The great diversity of our products renders it nigh impos
sible now that all of them '-an or will fail. If what is raised only brings fair
prices there will still be enough to export or sell at home to keep our pro
ducers even, and enable every sound and well conducted enterprise to be
carried on without loss.
Ever since it became apparent that the recent war would result in the
acquisition of new territories I noticed in Europe, as well as in Eastern
cities, that marked attention was given to our coast and particularly to
San Francisco and its prospects for growth and prosperity. Evidently the
impression prevailed that opportunities for greater commercial activity
and expansion into new fields were now offered in San Francisco and that
an immense increase of business is now easily within her reach. This View
it appears is also largely shared at home, and while it may be correct to a
great extent as to the future, we should not overrate the benefits imme
diately obtainable, nor underrate the efforts necessary to eventually secure
them. Examining the situation conservatively the first result of the acqui
sition of new colonies will be an influx of representatives of Eastern manu
facturers and of other interests, who will not only seek colonial trade but
will also compete with our merchants and manufacturers for coast trade.
As our interior population is now even too small in proportion to our cities
and the field in which we already compete for trade with Eastern houses
is too restricted for the established enterprises, it seems that Pacific Coast
houses will have still closer competition, diminished profits and increased
expenses for conducting and promoting their business. Nor are the markets
in the Far East, except in some staples, ready and prepared to purchase ex
tensively what our merchants have to offer or our manufacturers produce
Therefore it behooves us all to watch carefully how things are going. Work
hard to hold our own in our own markets, and reach out intq new fields
only when adequate preparation, skill, energy, enterprise and sufficient cap
ital will enable us to gain as much there as we will surely lose if we let
Eastern competition get ahead of us at home.
While direct efforts for Far East trade must be made by individual en
terprise, or by a combination of houses or formation of companies, much
may be done to add to the opportunities which should be affordpd for such
enterprises as will naturally make our city again a foremost distributing
center.
Firstâ While the influx of additional competition, as above outlined, will
in the beginning divide trade with existing houses, it will also tend to make
San Francisco more distinctively than heretofore a center and headquarters
of trade. We should, therefore, not only try to hold our own in local trade
against the new-comers, but welcome them, so that ultimately our city may
profit by their coming.
Second â We must secure all freight facilities afforded elsewhere for get
ting poods here cheaply. Wherever possible we must avail ourselves of
through freight rates from manufacturing points to consumers. Thus we
can sell goods here in the new markets at a fixed price, as purchasers there
are not familiar with and do not care to speculate in the cost of the trans
portation of goods.
Third â We must make every effort to induce competing ocean steamship
lines to make San Francisco their starting point by making port charges
as light as possible and the loading and discharging of ships of all kinds
easy, quick and safe. An able article fully covering this subject written by
a contributor to the Merchants' Association Review will be published in the
January number of that paper. I will not, therefore, elaborate upon this
subject here.
Fourth â By all means we must encourage factories and all industrial
enterprises at home. No community can be permanently prosperous or se
cure the highest degree of prosperity through the mere soiling of its own
products. Manufacturing is the greatest source of wealth.
Fifth â We must make San Francisco headquarters for all Oriental
through travel and must offer visitors inducements to stop and stay here
as long as possible. Bureaus of information for tourists should be main
tained for this purpose. Our hotels, so excellent otherwise, should see that

at least the principal languages are spoken by some of their employes,
is the case in all other countries where there is international travel.
Sixthâ We must make our city beautiful, agreeable and attractive so th
people living in less congenial lands will prefer to live in San Francisco, as
Europe they now spend their time and money in Paris. .
Seventh â Above all we must stand together as a community fur the coi
mon good even at a temporary individual sacrifice. We must quit quarr
ing and fighting with the various interests represented here, except to a
just differences fairly and squarely. The open-door plan by which we ha
often thrown our grievances to the world in an exaggerated form is not t
best plan to settle them. Let us induce competition in public utilit
whenever possible. Take a firm stand when monopolies encroach beyo
their rights and privileges; but see to it that the officials selected by 1
people will be capable and honest, and deal fairly with corporate intere
when they are satisfied with a reasonable income upon the investme
made.
Eighthâ To lead the public to take just, fair and intelligent views of
public questions; to support honorable officials faithfully discharging tb
obligations to the municipality, is th^ duty of the press as well as the c
zen. The Merchants' Association is indebted to the press for assistane
its efforts to advance the progress and prosperity of San Francisco. Arr
its members are the chief supporters of the press of this city. Therefo
feel justified in appealing to the newspapers whose mighty power mold
a great extent the destiny of this metropolis, to unite in the support of e
measure tending to ameliorate the condition of our city.
Ninthâ Finally, we must have first, last and all the time united ac
for good, honest, efficient, progressive and liberal government, which r
than any other one thing will secure for us protection, justice, heÂ»
comfort, prosperity and happiness.
OUR. SHIPBUILDING:
By Irving M. Scott,
BY THE extension of our territory to the Sandwich Islands and
Philippines, with the enforcement of the navigation laws now ir
istence, an impetus will be given to American shipping in the s
proportion that foreign 'vessels are prevented from trading bet\
American ports. The products of the Philippines and the Sand'
Islands which reach America will be carried in American ships to a gr
er extent than they ever have before, which makes a corresponding
mand for an increase in our American ships.
The near completion of the great line through Siberia to Vladivo
or to Port Arthur opi>ns a field fur American enterprises, and the new
velopments and divisions of commerce taking place In and about Cl
would require an increase in the quality, size and speed of the ships her
fore plying between these two points.
These three trade centers can be obtained by the proper enterprise
action on behalf of the Americans, and most certainly if the people of C
fornia do not promptly avail themselves of the opening it will be tilled
others.
The O. & O. S. S. Company's ships are chartered ships owned inEnglj
and if they touch at either Manila or Hawaii, in the event of same
coming American property, they will not be allowed to touch at San Fi
clsco; consequently this would require a transshipment of freight at cii
of the above named points, or else a .direct communication from some ;
ental point to San Francisco.
The Pacitle Mail Steamship Company is owned in New York and
the bulk of thp business. The best steamer on the line to China is an E
lish-built ship, and that company certainly cannot keep up with the pret
demands without increasing the number, size and speed of its steamers
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company Is owned by a company wr.
headquarters and interests are at Seattle, and whose Interests in
north are greater than they are in San Francisco. This company has

direct to Seattle, and intends to put a line of steamers on from Seattle

plements that carry it on are owned and controlled at the port throi
which the trade is to be operated.
It is to be hoped that all the people of San Francisco, without regard
politics or calling, will so imbue themselves with an advanced public sp
that the result will be that the bulk of this trade will be obtained for S
Francisco and carried on American bottoms, whose earnings will be added
and remain a portion of the wealth of our State.
Borrowed capital takes the interest money out of our country and trai

in our banks which once started in developing the commerce of the Pac:
Ocean and making San Francisco a distributing port will find steady c
ployment and a fair return. Otherwise the continuc-us depletion of the 90
merce of San Francisco, by being transferred to other points through lit
whose interests are not here, will go on.
The lines owned by Mr. Isano, running in connection with the pres*
Pacific Mail, will undoubtedly aid in bringing the cheaper freierht to t
port. It is claimed the shins can be operated more cheaply with Japan*
than with American seamen. While this will bring freight to us, the eai

I think it can be safeh' said that these conditions are as yet unfulfill
and they are open to the enterprise of the first comer. Let us sincerely ho
for the benefit of our entire coast, that sufficient enterprise can be found

for employment and profit.
OUR WHEAT:
By Horace Davis,
TO review the trade in breadstuffs at this time is difficult and unsati
factory, because in the first place all the statistics of the trade a
made up by crops in crop years, running from July to July â ea<
such year representing a completed crop â while on the other hand tl
calendar year is to us an arbitrary division, breaking into the midd
of the natural harvest year. Besides, at this particular time, even the ca
endar year is not closed, so that any summary made to-day is fragmentary
and incomplete. However, I will try to outline the main features of the
year 1898, so far as we can distinguish them now.
The weather has controlled the course of trade thia year to an unusual
degree. It is always an important factor in the business, but this year !t
has exercised an unusually potent influence. The year opened with tine
promise of bountiful harvests, but after the first of February dry, cold
weather gradually set in and the promise of January slowly faded away.
Sharp spring frosts destroyed the early fruit and damaged the grain some
what, though much of it was already ruined. Still Wfl held on to our faith
and hoped against hope, but by the first of June the conviction forced itself
upon us that we were face to face with the most disastrous year since 1864.
In the Southern half of the State the grain was utterly ruined, but aft
you went north it improved considerably and the Sacramento Valley gav#
promise of a fair crop; but after the grain was rine and ready for cutting a
fierce norther swept over the upper counties, thrashing out the standing
grain and scattering a large part of it on the ground. When all was said and
done we gathered in about one-third of our January promise. The harvest
of 1898 was not much more than enough for seed and food. Whatever we
export, whether in the form of wheat or flour, must come from either our
hold-over stock or what we imported from our neighbor States.
The year reminds me of 1864. That year we had only ten inches of rain,
not enough to nourish the growing grain, and the crop was a failure. That
harvest was probably just about enough for food and seed; but word went
out that California was starving, and cargo after cargo of wheat and flour
came up from Chile. Some barrel flour was even sent round the Horn
from New York, while Oregon shipped us all she could spare, which wasn't
much. Prices went up very high. I bought wheat that year at 5^ cents
per pound and flour touched $15 per barrel. Still we exported considerable
to Pacific ports, even to Australia, and finally when the market broke the
Chilean flour in this port was re-exported from bond to China.
Now let us return to 1898, The year opened with wheat at about SI 40
per cental, and the price ranged from $1 40 to $1 45 until about the mid
dle of March, when it began to climb to higher points. The lack of rain
created a panicky feeling, and at the same time the notorious corner in
the Chicago market had its effect on wheat in San Francisco. The price
was forced so high in Chicago that wheat was actually shii ped from the
State of Washington across the mountains to supply Eastern millers. The
corner broke in Chicago at last, and wheat, which had reached $1 85 here
fell rapidly to a Liverpool parity, and by the end of June was selling at
about $1 25.
And now see the difference in the conditions of 1864 and those of 1898
In 1864 we were able to absorb the small surplus of Oregon, but this year
the two Northern Pacific States had a crop of over a million of "tons of
wheat. They were able to supply all our wants and had left over an enor
mous surplus for export. To carry this away they drew on us for tonnacv"
and paid from 30 shillings upward, aa high as 37s 6d for European shlpl

ments. So ihut although the English market advanced, wheat remained
through the fall at about 51 20 tg $1 25 here, declining later to $1 1-V"l 15.
who remembered the famine prices of 1864 and counted on similar
results this year, found themselves on the wrong Bide of the market, with
wheat lower instead of higher than|ast year.
The imports of wheat and flour from the surrounding States have been
larger than ever before. Oregon. â¦ Washington and even Utah have Him. del
ua with their overflowing abundance In coast quence "f this we have been
â¢â¢ii>le to export some of our stock. During the past fiye months we have
sent out of this port 714, 5^7 centals of wheat, about one-eighth of our aver
age shipments for this periodâ and 330.162 barrels of flour, which amount
is pretty well up to the customary export for the period.
I am indebted for all these statistics to the courtesy of Mr. Bates of the
Commercial News.
In the earlier part of the year the shipments of flour were lessened very
much by lack of transportation facilities. The Pacific Mail Bteamers were
withdrawn from their regular service in May. June and July to perform
transport duty for the United States. Our trade with Asiatic ports suffered
temporarily from this cause, and the export of flour was considerably less
than it would naturally have been.
How much grain and Hour came from our neighboring States I do not
know, for the all rail imports have been quite large this year. In 1898. for
the first time, wheat in large quantity has come through over the Siskiyou
mountains. California became an importej^of breadstuffs on a large scale.
The currents of trade were reversed to some extent and new elements en
tered into our commercial transactions. .
The cours-- of the barley market offers a curious contrast to wheat, and
reminds us of wheat in 1864.
California Is king in the barley market. She is the great producer, and
our northern neighbors cut very little Bgure In that line. Consequently
when it was settled that the drought would ruin tin- crop here, local prices
at once began to rise, untit the market value of barley here has nearly
doubled, and to-day barley is brought over the Rockies from Nebraska.
And here we must end our review, in the middle of the crop year, with
unsettled conditions in every department. Of one thing we are sure, that
1898 has been a very trying year in the grain trade.
OUR PROSPECTS:
By A, Sbarboro,
Fresider)t Manufacturers' and Producers' f^ssocictlon.
O State in the Union, and, indeed, few parts of the world, has such
a brilliant future a-s the State of California. The development of
the numerous and inexhaustible resources of this State has been
as yet barely commenced.
Our mines have enriched the world, are continuing to give forth
large quantities of their precious metals, and with the application of
cheaper power, which is continually being discovered by science and the
reasonable reduction of labor from the high rates of years ago, it will be
possible to develop mines which could not have been successfully
worked by the old systems. These mines will give employment to a larger
nuxaber of men, and when properly and economically managed, will reward
the enterprising 1 owners and pay them dividends on the capital invested.
The ship-building trade of San Francisco is destined t" become in the
n>ar future one of the largest industries of the State. The achievements of
the Oregon. Olympia and the other vessels built at the Union Iron Works
and other ship yards in this city have demonstrated to the world the fa
cilities which exist here for building as great merchant ships and war ves
sels as can be turned >>ut in any part of the globe.
The acquisition of the Philippines and the requirements of the Rus
sians on the completion of their railroad at Vladivostok, and the near civiliza
tion of China by European nations, are eventually destined to make the
Pacific Ocean as important as the great Atlantic highway, and, therefore,
at no distant day on the large water front of this city v. ill be Been numer
ous sailing craft being built by thousands of our mechanics.
This will give an impetus to other manufacturing industries of this
city, and with the application of cheaper power furnished by electricity
and possibly by the heat from the burning refuse of the city, will enable our
factories to compete with the other manufacturing institutions of the
United States.
Now, as to the product of our farms, they cannot fail to increase in
quantity and remujierativeness. Th< occasional drought will Induce en
terprising citizens and capital to store such abundant water in our moun
tain streams as will irrigate every acre of valley land, and thus the great
San J aouin will be made to produce enough wheat to supply a large popu
lation of the earth.
Co-operation among the different classes of producers will make the
production of food j rofitable. We have seen the raisin industry of this
for several years in a very depressed condition. Since proper co
operation was introduced the price of raisins has so enhanced as to make
this industry profitable.
Through co-operation a few years aero the price of wine was doubled
and the industry placed on a paying basis. This industry has, notwith
standing temporary drawbacks caused by dissension among *he wine deal
ers and the wine makers, a great future before it. California is the only
State in the Union "which can produce fine wines. We have for our market
seventy millions of our own people, several million inhabitants in the Cen
tral and South American republics, besides having already obtained a foot
hold for our wines in England. Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Our
newly acquired territories are inhabited by wine-drinking people, and so
soon as the tariff is adjusted these countries alone will take a large part of
the wine which is now produced in this State.
OUR WINES ;
By C, W. Wetmore.
THE close of the year reveals bright prospects -or the vine industry
of California for the coming year and probably tor some time
The crop of last year was phenomenally large, being about
to come.
27,000,000 gallons of drÂ» nines and 7,000,000 p. .lions of BWeet wines.
a total of about 34,000,000 gallons. There was in bond a surplus from pre
vious years of between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 gallons, making a total of
about 40.000000 gallons of wine at the beginning of the year. There
is a normal market for about 20,000,000 gallons, so thai there was a two
years' supply in the hands or: producers and dealers.
As a natural consequence prices went down to 6 and 8 cents per gal
lon. The Winemakers' Corporation, which had succeeded in keeping up
prices in the past, was powerless at the beginning of the year with this
largo crop on hand.
Now the crop of IS9S has been measured and it is found to be only
about 8,500,000 gallons of dry and 4,000,000 gallons of sweet wines. This
shortage has produced the desired effect in raising prices, and wines which
brought G cents at the beginning of the year now readily bring 12%
cents. With the crop of .IS9B there is now on hand about 25,500.000 gallons,
or a little over one year's supply. Owing to the poor growth of the vines!
consequent on the lack of moisture, a short crop is predicted for 1899 The
rainfall during the rest of the season will affect the situation, but at
best the crop will hardly be an average one.
There will be a steady rise in prices in the future. Owing to the dry
season the ravages of the phylloxera have been more evident this year
because the vines were less able to withstand the attacks. Probably' 5
000,000 acres of vines Have been thus destro id in the bay counties, and
the replanting of resistant vines is very slow.
There are . w about 15.000.000 gallons in the hands of tie producers
which is quite a large proportion. About 10,000,000 gallons are In the hands
of dealers.
This largo amount ot wine and the low prices that have ruled have at
tracted especial attention in foreign countries. Recently representatives
of large European deal rs have come here with the intention of making
extensive purchases of red wines if prices are satisfactory. These foreign
dealers have been buying in Spain in the past and the war has effected
a transfer of th-ir attention. If such large puflfchases follow, the market
â uill be further relieved. It is likely that prices will advance to 15 and
18 cents.
Our chief market, the East, steadily improves. The Imports of for
eign wines, except eha^npagne. show a steady falling off and this moans
that their place is taken by California wines. The decrease in the im
ports of German. French and Spanish dry wines is a result of the keen
competition of California wines, and also of the steady improvement in
their quality. There is still a widespread feeling in the East that for
eign wines are the proper thing, but this is lessening all the time.
In this State California wines are now greatly preferred. The manager
of one of the greatest hotels in San Francisco says that he sells ten bot
ile.s of California wine to one of foreign. The manager of one of the
largest fashionable seaside resorts in the State recently told me that he
had on hand $5000 worth of imported wines that he could not got rid of
and that he was contemplating putting California labels on thorn to sell
them. They are still putting foreign labels on California wines In the
Bast, but the practice is steadily decreasing.
Pew people realize that in 1840. with hardly more than one-third the
present population and with a less relative ability to consume wine, the
United States imported as much wine as it does now. The increase In
consumption is supplied by California, though the people of the country
probably pay $5,000,000 annually for the foreign labels on their California
Â« Ines.
Our wines are thus rapidly gaining favor in the East, and the foreign
demand is rapMly increasing. London buys nearly 3,000,000 gallons of
California wines yearly, whlje ten years ago it did not buy a gallon.
Shipments to Europe generally and to Central and South America, the Pa
cific Islands and the Orient are all Increasing. " """ ~

OUR FRUITS:
By Professor E. W. Hilgard.
WE are gradually finding- out that fruits that are good for the East
are not so fine for California because of climatic differences.
Therefore California seedlings and fruits are coming into use. They
have originated in this State and so are better adapted to the ell-
mate and soil.
"A good many have originated through accident, but the larger number
have been purposely originated by intercrossing. Mr. Luther Burbank of
Santa Itosa, whose name is well known in Europe in this connection, has
successfully originated a number of new fruits.
"It is thought that by the gradual selection of such varieties we will be
able to supply the East with those not represented in the native
products there.
"My colleague, Professor E. J. Wickson, has done some very valuable
work in this line. The idea is not to obtain an immense number of varie
ties, but varieties that will have a commercial value.
"The Japanese plums, which came into this country by way of San
Francisco, were developed here and have been very popular with con
sumers. By crossing the stouts several new varieties have been produced.
"New apples, peaches and pears have also been produced. Eastern fruit
growers obtain these and raise them with more or less success according
to the climatic conditions.
"As regards vegetables, the differentiation or creation of new varieties
has not been so great. But the climatic peculiarities are gradually mak
ing themselves felt. Modifications and varieties are being produced that
are best adapted to our climatic conditions.
'Kastern vegetables often thrive better on our soil, both in point of size,
flavor and taste. The seeds from these are sent East to be used there.
"Celery, green peas and asparagus, that in winter time must be raised
under glass roofs, grow in the fields in California. If the celery is now
raised under glass it is stored for winter use in cellars heated to keep out
tin- frost. California is sending carloads of these fresh vegetables to the
Bast, and find a profitable market for them. Even counting the cost of
freight, they can be sold in the East cheaper than those raised there under
glass.
"During the last few years winter exportation of fresh vegetables has
steadily increased. The future looks very promising for this branch.
"The growing of vegetable seeds has already taken on large proportions.
Esp< ially from Santa Clara County large supplies of seeds are furnished
to Eastern markets, proving the excellence of the California product.
"The experiment station has for many years past taken great pains
to obtain from foreign countries possessing analogous climates, fruits,
plants and other growths. A number of such introductions have been
annually distributed to farmers and horticulturists. They have found ready
acceptance.
"Heretofore we have found considerable difficulty in getting into effec
tive communication with foreign countries. But now, under the impulse
of the recent political developments and of a progressive Secretary, the
United States Department of Agriculture has organized a definite system.
Its purpose is to aid in the search for and introduction of useful plants from
foreign countries.
"Acting through Consular agents the department is now dispatching
special investigators for this express purpose. They will study the pos
sibilities of advantageous Introductions in the various parts o-f the United
States. It is hoped that an adequate appropriation will be provided at this
session of Congress to carry on this important work more effectively.
"California Is especially interested in a new exploration for the above
purpose. Professor Fairchild of the United States Department at Wash
ington has just passed through San Francisco on his way to Central and
South America, with Porto Rico as his ultimate destination.
"The region he will study corresponds to the Pacific Slope. The ex
penses of this investigation are borne by Mr. Lathrop, a public-spirited
citizen of California. Another expedition of similar character In which Cali
fornia is interested has been sent to the Eastern Mediterranean countries
"We have already received many valuable introductions from these coun
tries.
'â¢It is therefore very probable that in the near future a number of new
and useful plants will be offered for experimental tests to the agricultural
and horticultural public."
OUR GOLD MINES.
By W. C. Ralston,
CALIFORNIA'S production of gold, which now has amounted to over
thirteen hundred and twelve million dollars, justly entitles her to a
leading position in the gold-producing countries of the world.
Yet California as a gold-producer to-day is but little known â the
fact is that the average citizen of the United States believes that California
is no longer a gold-producer.
Why should this be? whose fault is it? and what the remedy? are ques
tions every loyal Californian should ask and try to answer. Our sister State.
Colorado, known but a few years ago as a silver State, to-day outshines
California in the production of gold, and why? Her press is full of mining
notes, not only in general, but in detail, of every mining region no matterhow
small or remote. Her railroads publish page after page of descriptive cir
culars telling of her rich gold fields. The result has been that capital was
attracted there, and having a mineral country all that was needed was
capital to open up paying mines.
Here in California we have a mineral country surpassed by none, the
climatic conditions which permit of mining the year round, and yet we are
not able to attract the necessary capital to open up this mineral wealth. The
condition of the mining properties which are being worked in California to
day is of the best.
Where ten years ago low-grade ores would not pay, to-day they yield
handsome dividends. No better evidence can be given than the history of
the Utica mine at Angel Camp. Calaveras County, which would not pay
with a few stamps, but has paid enormous dividends with 120 stamps, the
whole mass of ore being worked and the small rich stringers in the vein
helping to increase the yield per ton. At the Stickle 60-stamp mill, belonging
to the Utica Mining Company, for one year the average duty per stamp of
850 pounds per day was five tons, and the cost of milling exclusive of power
13 cents per ton of ore crushed. Such figures were unheard of before. The
Treadwell mine in Alaska cannot make such a showing, for they
crushed onlj two and nine-tenths tons per stamp per day during the year
endin o May 31, 1898.
It takes large capital to open up these large low-grade mines on the
mother lode and equip them. The same can be said of the drift gravel mines
which underlie the lava-capped ridges of the Sierras, long bedrock tunnels
being necessary for their exploration.
Hence California needs capital for her mines. There is no industry in
the world which pays better wages than gold mining. Wherever a paying
mine exists there you find a business town. Miners want the best of
everything and are ever ready and willing to pay for it. We have to-day
over 20,000 men at work in the mines. We could just as easily give employ
ment to 200,000 men if the necessary capital were only forthcoming to develop
our mines.
One of the great needs which has retarded development has been that
of power. Electric transmission has made it possible to overcome! this and
it w^ll be the means of opening many mines which to-day can get neither
water power nor fuel cheap enough to make steam. Lack of railroad trans
portation is also retarding the opening up of our mines. Until the Sierra
Railway of California was built from Oakdale to Jamestown, in Tuolumne
County, four miles from Sonora, the county seat, and showed by its earn
ings what profits can be made by building Into the mining regions, no one
thought of building a road for the trade, but now other railroads are
talked of to open up the mining centers. Even the Southern Pacific. Com
pany is beginning to' look for a market for Oregon pine and Castle Gate
coal in the Mother Lode region. The acquisition of the Valley road by the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company opens up great hopes to
the miner, for this company knows what profits can be made from mining
camps. The opportunity of landing at Stockton mining timber direct
from Oregon and Washington gives hope that Oregon pine will soon be de
livered at a rate which will permit of square set timbering with sawed
timbers at a low cost.
The association has also shown to the Land Commissioner of the In
terior Department that the land grant railroads have been trying to acquire
mineral land under the claim of its-being agricultural land. Unfortunately
fur the good of the country BUCh men as S. W. Lamoreeau now and then
get in an office of power such as Land Commissioner and then the public
at large suffers, and in this case the State of California is the largest loser
of land which should have remained open to location by the miner. His rul
ings worked more harm to the drift gravel mining interests than to any
other. The present Secretary of the Interior has been more liberal, requir
ing the proving of mineral on each lot of 160 acres Instead of upon each lot
of twenty acres, as was the former ruling.
California has a great future before it from her mining industry, and
the people will awaken some time to the fact that we have at home within
easy access a mining region second to none on earth.
ivlondike may be rich; there is no doubt of that, but what has been its
production as compared to California's? Klondike never will reach an
annual product of eighty millions of dollars, such as California enjoyed In.
1852. It is safe to say that inside of five years California will be producing
twenty miiiioji dollars in gold annually, '

THE PASSING OF THE PRINTING
PRESS
THE days of the printing press are numbered," sententiously
remarked my friend Everett the other evening, as we walked
past the pressroom of one of our great morning dalles, whence
the muffled roar and hum of the vast and complicated machin
ery In the basement issued with an impulse that made the air
aiia Bldewalk vibi ate.
"What iio you mean?" I asked. "Do you apprehend such an imme
diate return to barbarism that th-re will be no more newspapers left
to tell the tale, and no subscribers left to tell it to?" My friend is
- , . irioua notions, among which a morbidly pessimistic
socialism is not one of the least pronounced.
"By no means," lie returned gravely. "We shall have our papers
and our news as usual along with our morning milk, but they will
not be the product of the printing press, that is all."
"Oh, Indeed! Then perhaps you will press Borne uore poweriui
into your service than Bteatn and iron and printers inK, 1
remarked Ironically. "Possibly the cathode ray." 1 added with a tinge
uf sarcasm, "that latest embodiment of scientific omnipotence is \-;-Rue
enough and uncanny enough to have anything fathered upon itwitmn
the range of a distempered imagination. By all means tell us that you
Ing to supersede tnc printing business v.ith the cathode ray.
"And that is Just what 1 am going to do," returned Everett slowly
and impressively, at the same timr pausing in his walk and loomng
me full in the face. "You needn't laugh.- You spoke wiser than you
knew. You drew your bow at a venture and struck between the joints
of the harness. Fes, I am now engaged In perfecting a method or
printing newspapers by means of what is commonly known as tne
X or cathode i ay."
It was my turn now to look serious. I had all along known my
friend to be peculiar; had this peculiarity developed into something
more danger us? Had he, too, fallen a victim to the delusions wmen
have affected numerous ill-balanced minds through pondering over
Professor Ro tgen's weird discovery? .-,.â â¢
â¢â You needn't look at me like that," went on Everett, as if divining
my thoughts. "I'm not crasy, but mean every word I say. If you
haven't anything better to do for an hour or so come up to my place
and I'll convince you that I'm in earnest."
The sincerity of his manner impressed me, and as it was now
; weeks sine.' 1 had met him. I decided to a company him to
â while away the time if nothing else. Knowing Everett, as I did, to he
, C a scientific, though odd, turn of mind: usually experimenting in a
tory sort of way in any field that struck his fancyâ chemistry,
-. mechanics or what notâ and having some small private means
at his disposal, sufficient to enable him to gratify his whims in that
direction, it was within the bounds of possibility. 1 reasoned, that he
had stumbled upon something original in connection with the latest
electrical diseov< ry.
Ten minutes' ride in th<> cars brought us to my friends abode on
Russian Hill, and together we passed into the house, and then into
his sanctum at the back, a sort of nondescript combination of labora
tory and workshop, filled with a heterogeneous collection of mechan
ical t. ols and scientific apparatus, littering shelves, tables, stools
and floor. , ..
I had been in the den often enough to Âc perfectly used to the
BUrroundlngs, and instinctively looked round for something new. Yes,
over there by the further wall of the big apartment there vere some
â rrange'mer.ts which I did not remember having seen on my last
some six weeks before. There were, for instance, three large
bulbs, which I recognized as Crookes tubes, suspended from the
ceiling about a foot above a rectangular framework, which luoked
like a nosing table with the top removed. Within this
framework there rested on the floor a massive bow-shaped object,
about a yard in length, evidently of iron, bound round with coils of
r wire, the ends of the bow projecting upward to a height of
six inches. Wires from either end of the bow led to another part
<â { tht< apartment.
"What >!" yu think of it?" remarked Everett, noticing my
scrutiny. "Crookes tubes above, and horse-shoe magnet belowâ good
combination for X-ray purposes, .lsn't It? Now come over here and
I'll show you sony more of the apparatus."
Bo saying he led the way to a table upon which stood what had
the appearance of a large copying press, such as is used in business
for copying letters. The lid of this he raised by turning the
Wheel which operates the -screw, and then, detaching the lid, asked
me to look inside. I there saw what seemed to be a semi-transparent
gelatinous film, imbedded in an oblong frame and presenting a flat
surface as smooth as glass. Th>- frame struck me as being about big
enough to a. â commodate one of the forms used in printing an ordinary
weekly newspaper, an Impression further confirmed by the fact that
on a composing table close by there lay four of such forms, which
further inspection showed were already locked and ready for the press.
â Why, you seem to be going into the printing business in earnest,"
I said. "You have all the appliances, I see," I continued as a row
of type-sotting cases, which I had not previously noticed in the dim
light, caught my eyeâ "all except the press."
"Don't want any press," he returned testily. "Didn't I tell you the
days of the printing press were numbered? That is what I brought
you hen to Bhow you. Help me to get one of these forms into this lid."
The lid of the copying press, as I shall still call it for convenience,
was set upon its back on the composing table, and together we laid
the form within it face up, clamping it securely down. We then laid
the lid with the form in it. face down and crosswise, upon specially
prepared projections from the sides of the press bed, just filling the
sides of the chase, so as not to disarrange the type, And having
adjusted the mortise in the back sÂ« as to catch the lower end of the
Bcrew, we turned the latter till it engaged securely with the lid, when
we raised the whole by the wheel, till the form rested directly above
the oblong bed of the press. The screw was then reversed and the
form slowiy lowered till it found rest. A few sharp turns more were
necessary till no amount of force would drive the screw further, and
then the'lid was* again raised from the press-bed, unscrewed from its
support and laid to one side.
Everett then reached down into the press and drew therefrom the
frame containing the film previously described and held it up to the
light so that I could examine it. The sight was a beautiful one. Each
letter was clearly cut as if stamped by a die. as in fact it had been.
"We have now got to back this film to give it stability," said
Everett, as he placed the frame upon a sheet of plate glass which lay
ready, and to which the film was speedily transferred.
While a fresh film was being inserted in the frame I had an oppor
tunity to examine it. I was surprised at its tenacity and toughness.
â \Vhil< not more than the sixty-fourth of an inch in thickness, it
seemed to possess the elasticity and resilience of metal.
"A preparation of my own," remarked my friend, in answer to a
question. "A combination of experiment and accident. Totally im
pervious to the cathode rayâ more so. in fact, than many metals, and
mmh more suitable as a matrix, in consequence of being more easily
worked."
Three more film? were taken in quick succession from as many
forms, and then Everett intimated that everything was ready for

Sketched From Life.
printing. This was what I was particularly curious about, so I watched
the proceedings narrowly.
Returning to the upright rectangular frame first described, with
the Crookes tubes above and the horse-shoe magnet below, Everett
proceeded first to place a planed deal board within the frame, just
above the ends of the magnet, resting it on knobs projecting from the
legs. Upon this platform I assisted him to pile ream after ream of
extra quality printing paper, such as is used by our best weeklies,
until the top of the frame work had been reached. There were in the
pile, I should judge, somewhere in the nighborhood of 5000 sheets. The
sheets of plate glass holding the type-punctured films were next placed
symmetrically upon the top uf the framework, just ab^ve the pile of
paper. This done, Everett stepped aside and touched the keys of the
Crookes tubes suspended above, which instant. y became filled with a
soft lambent light, at the same time taking out his watch and noting:
the time. When four minutes had elapsed he declared the operation
completed.
Together we lifted off the plate glass forms, and what was my
astonishment to see that the top sheet was beautifully printed â as
typographically perfect, indeed, in outline and finish as could have
been done on the best equipped press extant. But, surprised as I was
at first, I was utterly dumfounded when Everett proceeded to remove
(Copyrighted, 1898.)
E had often called ourselves hard up, Johnnie and I, and we had
I # joked each other and with our more Intimate friends about living
1 II f on the edge of a razor, and had, more than once, forecast our fate
1 I I in the uneangenial lines of a workhouse, wondering gayly enough,
it must be owned, how long we should be able to go on before
that extremely unpleasant haven was an accomplished fact. But
we had never really known the actual pangs of real and bitter
poverty until that dreary November day, just three years ago,
when Johnnie announced to me, with a very long face, that his
uncle had given him the key of the street, so far as the office was
concerned, and that we had now nothing between us and starvation but a
month's money, our wits and our valuables. Poor old Johnnie; he added
that last clause in a spirit of bitterest sarcasm, for valuables we had none,
if you take exception to our few wedding presents, which had seemed very
smart at the time and had made a very good show at our wedding break
fast, but which, on close examination, proved to be mostly plated. His
Uncle John aftfr whom he had been named, and who had, by common
consent of the family, been expected to provide for him from that time
forward, had, it is true, given us a present which was above reproach in
the matter of value, for he had presented us with a check for a hundred
pounds to be used for furnishing our first modest home, and he had also
given me a keeper ring, set with three good-sized diamonds, which I had
put on my hand while our wedding breakfast was in progress and had
dutifully worn every day right down to the time of his finally quarreling
with Johnnie and turning him straight away out of his office.
When Johnnie told me the news I must confess that I Just sat and
stared blankly at him with my mouth open and my eyes, I am sure, looking
very full of the dismay which I felt.
"Turned you out, Johnnie:" I exclaimed. why, what on earth shall
we do? Andâ andâ " â 
"Yes, I know," he said, savagely. And that s what makes me so sore
and hurt about it all. It isn't as if I had upset him or gone against him
in any way, but simply because you are â well, as yon ai*. He had the im
pudence to tell me, too, that he had always thought there were too many
people in the world, and that he did not mean to be any party to over
stocking this particular locality."
"1 don't understand," I said, and it was true.
"Well, he says that he forgave us for being so improvident as to have
one baby on three hundred a year, and that, as we have chosen to go in
for having another, I had better go and look for a berth with some one
who can afford to give me a bigger salary than he can. 'I have made a
lawyer of you.' he added, 'so now you can turn your position to better ac
count than you can with me.' "
"And what did you say, Johnnie?" I asked.
"Say!" my poor Johnnie echoed. "Why. I said everything that I ought
not to have said, and I left unsaid everything that I ought to have said.
I have done for myself with the old man forever, and as long as he lives
he will never speak to me or look at me again."
"Well, it is done and it cannot be undone now," I managed to say, "and
the only thing we have to do is to decide which course we had better take."
"Is "there a choice?" inquired Johnnie, with a faint shade of satire in
his tones.
"We'll keep Uncle John's ring and pawn i f . for our Christmas dinner,"
I said.
I pulled it off my finger where it had been ever since my wedding day
and looked at It.
"But never your other ring." he said fiercely.
He meant my engagement ring, poor darling, and I smiled as I re
placed the two rings on my wedding-ring linger.
"No, we will hang on to that a bit longer yet, Johnnie, dear," I said.
"But, if ever I had any sentimentality about Uncle John's wedding pres
ent to me, I have seen it melt away during these past few weeks. We
will let that go. dear boy. it has no value for me."
Even thin he gave a tacit consent with extremest reluctance, and very
much as if thÂ»' money the ring would eventually fetch would assuredly
burn his fingers. I laughed outright, and, let me tell you, I did not find
many things to amuse me in those days.
"We will have a good Christmas dinner out of Uncle John, at all
events," I said, with a brave show of keeping up my spirits. "I suppose
CHRISTMAS HAMPER
an armful of papers from the pile, and I saw that the one then at
top was as accurately perfect as the first.
"Aren't you going to help me?" he remarked somewhat quizzically,
as he reached for a second bundle. -'This is only the first side, remem
ber, and I want to print the whole edition off this evening."
Thus admonished I assisted him to remove the rest of the papers
from the frame, noting with increased astonishment that ths very
lowest in the pile was as typographically excellent m every respect,
and the ink of as intense a black, as the first.
"And why not?" queried Everett, as I commented particularly on
this point, as the last impression lay now on the top of the pile- "Why
not? Haven't you always understood tha'c no obstruction, save abso
lute or partial non-conductors, can impede the passage of the cathode
ray? Is not that the very principle wherein the X ray differs from
the ordinary light ray, or so far as is known, any other ray? It is
for the very reason, and only for that reason, namely, that it is not
a light ray, but an electric ray with a peculiar chemical action, that
the results you have just witnessed can be produced. Suppose, for
instance, you had put your hand between the lowest and the second
lowest paper in that heap. Would not the bones of your hand, and the
flesh to some extent, have been clearly defined above the printing of
the sheet, the intervening sheets above, being as powerless to impede
the passage of the ray as a deal board would be.'"
I could not help admitting the cogency of my friend's logic.
"But," I objected, "granting all that, you have not yet accounted
for the action of the ray upon the first, let alone the^last sheets,
which the ray encountered on its penetrating passage."
"Ah!" returned Everett, smiling, "that is my secret. Of course the
paper is prepared, and though I will not tell you outright what
ingredients I use, I will give you some hints as to the process. But
personal observation is much better than explanation, so if you will
give me a hand again with some more paper you can see for yourself."
So saying Everett stepped over to another pile of paper lying on
the floor and picked up an armful, I following suit. He led the way
across the apartment to what looked like a large wardrobe, or safe,
motioning me to open the door. As I did so I was nearly knocked
down by the sickening vapor which issued from the opening.
"Don't be frightened," he said in reassuring tones, at the same
time pushing his bundle of papers edgewise into one of a series of up
right compartments, which stretched, pigeon-hole like, across the
interior of the safe, and whkli were open beneath, save for a slat or
two on which the edges of the bundle rested, some free space being
left at the bottom of the safe. "The gas is rather overpowering at
first, but not dangerous. Shove your bundle into the space next mine.'
In a few minutes we had the compartments full. Everett then
poured some colorless liquid from a demijohn into a large shallow
earthenware vessel which stood by, and which he then introduced into
the empty space at the bottom of the safe, and closed the door.
"That," said he, "is the preparing chest. The paper wo have just
put inside is now undergoing impregnation with the gas from the
liquid in the vessel at the bottom. In two hours it will be fit for use.
This gas renders paper as sensitive to the cathode ray as the salts of
silver do to the photographic ray. Now help me to go to press with
the second side."
It took but a minute or two to pile the sheets that had already
been printed above the platform just above the great horse-shoe
magnet. The sheets were piled carefully printed side down, so that
this time the blank sides were exposed to the action of the ray. Two
fresh plate glass forms were laid on top of the pile and the light of
the Crookes' tubes turned on. When four minutes had elapsed by
Everett's watch, as before, the operation was pronounced complete,
and an inspection proved with the same result. The whole edition
lay there ready f r binding.
"Considerable saving of time and trouble, isn't it?" remarked
Everett, sententiously. "And there's no reason why an edition of a
hundred thousand shouldn't be printed as eas-.v as five, with tubes
and magnets of adequate power. My present apparatus is, of course,
crude, but any improvement on it would not affect the principle â it
would be merely a matter of detail. For insiince, in practice and on
a large scale, it would be much more convenient to box the paper up,
ream by ream, in a specially prepared case, sensitize it in this shape
and then expose it horizontally to the action rf the ray. Thus editions
of from five to ten thousand apiece could be turned out with very little
trouble and in -;hort order."
"There is another thing about the process " T remarked, "that I
do not understand. How is it that the dark, or electric, ray affects only
the side <>f the sheet of paper nearest to it, without affecting the other
side? Under all known laws of chemistry paner which is sensitized,
as this Is, clean through, ought to be affected clean through also by
a ray which penetrates it in a compact mass from end to end."
"I have studied ovp: that anomaly," returned Everett, medita
tively, "but have come to no reasonable conclusion regarding it. I
am inclined to think that the reason why only the surface upon which
the ray directly impinges is chemically affected is because, infini
tesimal as the distance separating the two surfaces of a sheet of
paper is, still it does constitute such a tangible separation from an
electrical point of view as to cause a distinct change of polarity.
The cathode ray, for instance, proceeds from the negative pole, in
contradistinction to its complement, the anode ray, which is positive
in character. Now, on the supposition that the paper surface pre
sented to the ray is positive in character, while the obverse surface is
negativeâ induced, it may be, by the action of the magnet at the
opposite end â it is quite conceivable that only the electrically receptive
surface would be decomposedâ in other words, the tissue of the paper
would only be affected to a certain depth upon the exposed surface, not
more SO, as a matter of fact â and as we can ourselves see from the
specimen before vs â than would be done by ordinary printers' ink.
That, however, is a problem I should like to refer to Edison or Tesla."
he won't ask us this year."
"We shall not go if he does." declared Johnnie, promptly.
"Well, do you go and see what the tea-spoons will fetch, I remarked.
"And what are you going to do, sweetheart?" he demanded.
"1 am going out for a little while," I replied. "Don't bother about me,
Johnnie, I shall be all right."
He went off then, though evidently rather reluctant to leave me.
Perhaps he thought that I meant to take baby and put an end to her and
myself also by slipping over the bridge, as I had jokingly suggested to
him when Uncle John had first turned him off. Dear old Johnnie, he need
have been under no such apprehension, for that was the last of all
thoughts in my mind. Perhaps I had never been much of a helpmate to
him but a coward I never was and hope I never shall be to the end of
the chapter. I dressed myself in my bestâ for we had not yet got to that
stage of poverty when we had begun to look like beggarsâ and giving
baby over into the care of our young maid, I sallied forth and took my
way straight to Uncle John's office. The little boy clerk who sat in the
outer office was quite alone. He looked rather surprised to see me, and
said that he was not sure whether Mr. Bryant was engaged or not, would
I wait a minute while he went to see? I replied that of course I would
do so and I sat down on the nearest chair, for I was feeling as if my
heart was certainly coming up into my mouth from the excitement and
nervousness that pervaded my whole being. Then the boy came back
and said that Mr. Bryant was disengaged, and would I walk "this way?"
I did walk that way, and the next moment found myself in Uncle John's
dread nresencc.
"Ohâ good morning," he said, rising stiffly and standing, looking very
forbidding, by the table.
"Good morning," I returned. "Iâ l daresay you are very much sur
prised to see me, Uncle John?"
"N't it at allâ not at all," he made haste to reply. "What can I do
I am sure that he forgot for the moment to whom he was speaking,
and that he simply used the ordinary formula with which he persuaded
all his lady clients to open up the business which had taken them to
him. "I came to speak to you about Johnnie," I said boldly, plunging
headlong into my subject.
"About Johnnie. Yes? I hope he is well."
I felt at that moment as if I would dearly have liked to box Uncle
John's ears. "No, Uncle John, he is not well," I said in a very severe
tone. "How can he be well, poor boy, when you have treated him as you
have done â when you have ruined him and broken his heart?"
"Hoity-toity!" he exclaimed â "and when did I commit all these
"When you turned him so unjustly out of your office," I replied. 1
felt that it was no use for me to have gone there and not say all that
was in my mind. "And they were crimes, Uncle John."
"The world is wide," he remarked.
"Yes, perhaps it is. But you must know quite well that the world is
not wide in a small place like Lettle Plumpton, and that, by attting as you
have done, you have as surely branded Johnnie as if you Had accused
him of theft."
"Do you mean to say that he cannot get anything to do?" He asked
the question with an air of surprise which 4nade my very blood rise to
boiling point.
"Uncle John," I said, making a desperate effort to keep myself calm
and collected, "if a young man. the nephew, say, of Mr. Johnstone, were
to come to you asking for a berth, what would you say? Why, you would
naturally ask him why he had left his uncle. And as he could hardly
give the true reason, that, having sanctioned his marriage, he had turned
him out because his wife was going to have a babgr, you would very
naturally think that there was something wrong about him, and that
such a preposterous excuse could not be the true reason of the parting."
"I should at least ask the uncle if he had anything against his
nephew," said Uncle John.
"Oh, would you? Well, none of the lawyers in Lettle Plumpton happen
to feel like that. They each and all jump to the conclusion that there
must be something against Johnnie, and they will have none of him."
"And you have come to me â " he began, in a questioning tone.
"To ask you to reinstate him â to take him backâ to take away this
stain which your action has cast upon him and to let the world of Lettle
Flumpton believe that there was some quarrel between you."
Foi a few moments Uncle John sat quite still and quiet, and seemed to
be thinking deeply. "I think not," he said at last.
"You refuse?" I asked.
"Yes; I don't feel like having my nephew here again. I am sorry to
say no to a lady "
"Oh, spare me that," I cried in disgust and rising from my chair as I
spoke. "I came as a last hope, thinking, praying that as I had been,
though unwittingly, the means of parting you, you wouia let me be tho
means of bringing you together again. I will go; but first let me tell you
that Johnnie knows nothing of my coming here to-day. I have deceived
him for the first time in my life; I have done something on my own re
sponsibility, and I am very sorry for it. It shall be the last "time. As
it is, I will bid you good-by, and in doing so let me say one thing: It
will come home to youâ mark my words!â one of these days, when you are
in need of Johnnie, you will want him, and you will have to do without
him. For I shall move every nerve to keep him from you now."
He rose too. "Don't you think that you had better wait till I do ask
for him?" he put in.
I turned and went out of the room without another word. I had been
on the point of asking him to keep my secret, to beg that he would never
never let my poor Johnnie know that I had so far humbled myself as to
ask a favor of his uncle; but in the face of his cruel, jeering manner I
forgot all that and went out of his presence feeling that all was not as
it seemed, and that he had got rid of Johnnie for some special private
reasons of his own.
What a time It was that followed on my visit to Uncle John's office
My poor Johnnje, feeling that there was not the very smallest chance of

am driven by circumstances to leave her for a few days and have not a
friend in all London to whom' l can turn in my present need I enclose
notes for ten pounds, and in the little sealed box at the bottom of the
hamper is evidence sufficient to show my baby's parentage, supposing that
anything should happen to me during the week. Please do not open it till
the week is over. I shall fetch my baby myself.
There was no name, not a word not a clue to the sender*, btie must
be mad." cried Johnnie. "And how came she to fasten on you of all peo
ple? I won't have you mixed up in it. I'm hanged if I will.
"She is paying well for the liberty she has taken.': I remarked. I
was still holding the little creature in my arms. and, as I spoke, my eye
caught yet another line of writing at the back of the letter which my hus
band held in his hand. "There's something else there," I said
Surely enough, we found a large bottle of Wedgeham B Food, and also
an elaborate feeding-bottle carefully packed away in the hay, which made
a soft cushion under the wool on which the babe had lain.
"I would like to keen her for the week, Johnnie." I said. I felt as if
it would give me something to think about if I undertook this work and
justified the trust reposed in me by this stranger.
So Johnnie said no mare about his objection, and I took the stranger
babe to my heart and shared with it the care that I bestowed upon my
own.
"Johnnie," I said." "you won't think me silly or fanciful " '-.â¢â ..:.â Â«;
"I feel as if this little babe has been sent from Heaven to tide us over
a bad time.' Let us have something, extra for our. dinner, to-night; it's our
Christmas dinner, you know.'.', ; Â. .. . .'. " . ' ' " ' ''.
He. did /what. I wished. He went out carrying one of my five-pound
notes with him, and he bought a ready-cooked chicken, some slices of
tongue, and a small bottle of champagne. I dare say it was extravagant
and foolish of us, but I never enjoyed a feast better in my life.
It was a dear babe. I got, during that week, to love it almost as well
as my own. And on the day appointed there came a soft little tap at the
door.-and then a pretty young girl came shyly in, her eyes full of tears,
her face all blushes, and her whole manner full of apology.
"I don't know what. you will think of me," she said. "I feel so bold,
so actually brazen, to have cast my poor baby, on you a stranger. Do
forgive me. I was afraid to leave her with the people across the way, and
I had to go down to my husbandL^ peopleâ they don't know that we
are married or that we have bab> ;, and Jack was there with his father
who was ill, and he wrote that I w#jj to go down at once and pay an ordi
nary visit as if my uncle had ask//A me "
"So you have an â  uncle, too," sCÂ«s/kclaimed, in my surprise.- â¢
"Oh, I have," she cried. "But he Is dead now, poor, old man, and I
need not' keep things back any more. I'm so happy, though I wondered
all the time if you would take her in or turn her out, or what? I've been
almost frantic with anxiety, and yet I was sure that my instinct would
never lead me wrong. That was why I was afraid to leave "her among
those people opposite. , Say that you will forgive me." â¢ â 
I laughed. "Well, little mother, there is nothing to â¢ forgive. I don't
know that I would have done the same with my little girl, tout certainly
your instinct was right; and I; have not ill-used your dear little babe
See, how wide awake she is now." â¢-;-; . ;
We became friends from that day, that little mother and I. And then
she brought her husband to see me and to thank me for what I had done;
and then they wormed our story out of us, and, in the end, he offered
Johnnie a place In his office, for he, too, was a lawyer. And, after a little
while, but a very few months, just as we were beginning to forget that
we had ever suffered as wo had done, Uncle John died, and, like lots of
lawyers, died without a will; and Johnnie came in as next-of-kin for all
his property, and we had no more need to worry as to**vays and means,
for Uncle John had been worth a good deal more than anyone had sus
pected. After that, Johnnie went into partnership with my" little friend's
husband, and I have often since had cause to bless the "day when she
took it into her head, in her emergency, to trust blind fate and her own,
instinct and to send me such a curious Christmas hamper.

A PRETTY dressing table is oneof
womankind's pet hobbies. I
have yet to rind one of the fem
inine sex who has not an over
powering- desire to possess this
one particular piece of furni
ture. Even the longing for petticoats that
rustle cad really, truly Paris bonnets
fades into Insignificance before a woman's
overwhelming ambition for a lovely dress-
Ing table. Frilled about with lacey
flounces and caught back with delicately
tinted ribbons, it Is. of all the accessories
of a woman's toilet, the daintiest and
most effeminate.
Can one's fancy paint a more alluring
picture than a pretty woman seated bt
fore this thing of lace and ribbons, as
she puts the last touch of powder on her
dainty little nose, or raises her arms to
catch back an unruly tress?
The unholy belief is strong within me
that a well equipped dressing table is a
greater joy to most women's souls than
e*en the household cherub, which young
and enthusiastic mothers are wont to de
clare outclasses all other possessions as
a comforter and happiness maker. Of one
thing I am certainâ dressing tables are
not given to spells of colic in the wee sma'
hours, nor do they raise teeth crops that
during their growth Incite whole neighbor
hoods to thoughts of murder and suicide.
The furbishings and aecouterments of
the dressing table are the most important
part of it. The lacey frills and shining
mirror count for much, but the especial
treasures are the pretty cut glass, silver
topped jars and bottles and boxes filled
with beautifying things with which to
wage warfare against old Father Time
and ungenerous Mother Nature. With all
her forces thus at hand a woman will not
have nor need she mane any excuse for
neglect.
First of all. there must be the manicure
set This should consist of a pair of
sharp curving scissors, a file, a bos of pol
ishing powder, some cold cream and a
chamois polisher. Then there must be
a hair brush, with good, firm bristles, and
a comb with coarse teeth. Besides these
things there must be some good cold
cream, a cleansing lotion like the milk of
roses; some home-made powder, some al
mond meal, a bottle of perfumery, an
atomizer filled with toilet water, some
little boxes of sachet powder and the
many other little things too numerous to
mention.
All these things can be made at home
In on' 1 own kitchen, and any woman
who has once experienced the delights
of fluffing up her own complexion stuffs
will never turn the fascinating labor over
t.i any one else.
If you have not already a good cold

bring a beauty to almost any skin from
which hope has not entirely fled.

And now I want to wish you all the
merriest kind of a Christmas. At the
same time let me whisper one little word
of warning. In your efforts to "cele
brate" don't fill your little "tummies
with all sorts of indigestible pastries
and sweets, else I will be snowed under,
Monday morning, with a perfect ava
lanche'of letters containing requests to
"Please, dear Mme. Hygela. for the love
of heaven, give something to drive away
an unsightly and most unaccountable
crop of red blotches that sprang up like
toadstools in the night."
So be warned in time, or I will surely
retaliate with "I told you so."
Answers to Correspondents.
D. R â Moist, clammy hands are very
frequently the accompaniment of a highly
nervous temperament. Defective circula
tion also is often the cause of this con
dition. Take plenty of exercise and be
pure that your sleeping room is well ven
tilated. Plunge the hands in hot water
and dry thoroughly. Then if you will
apply a powder made of equal parts of
orris root and lyropodium perhaps life
will once more become jolly and roseate
to you.
O. L. B.â Am very glad that you decided
to write me, for. I am sure that I can help
you. The treatment of pimples requires
more than mere outward applications.
Help must come from within. Do you
take a (Tilly tepid sponge bath and a
warm, soapy tub bath once a week? Do
'you walk at least a couple of miles a day,
rain or shine? Is the room that you
sleep in well ventilated, and do you deny
your stomach all sweets and pastries,
pickles and highly spiced dishes and other
indigestible foods? All this must be done
if one would have a smooth fair skin,
with the roses of health in the cheeks.
Bat plenty of fruit, such as apples, or
anges, peaches and peats, and if these do
not make the digestive organs sufficiently
active,- go to your druggist, who, I pre
sume, is reliable, and have this harmless
prescription rilled: Extract of dandelion,
1 dram; powdered rhubarb, q. s. Divide
into 31*8 grain pills and take one every
night, or oftener if necessary. Do not
take either of the medicines mentioned in
your letter. Use only pure castile soap
on your face, and use It every night with
tepid water, rinsing well in clear water
and drying on a soft towel. Then smear
a good cold cream over the face, such as
is given in to-day's Beauty Talk. If the
eruptions are severe touch the spots with
tincture of myrrh or listerine. diluted in
three times as much boiled water. In the
naornln? remove any of the ereasa that

remains on the face with a damp cloth
and dust with a pure powder. Good corn
starch makf-s a desirable powder, especi

tity of oxide of zincâ the best and purest
to be had. The electric needle is a sure
cure for superfluous hair unless it fails

think you need the advice of a medical
practitioner. There is surely some or
ganic trouble.
A READER- Cucumber juice is easily
obtainable by grating a ripe cucumber
and then straining the juice. The rose
water can be bought at any drug store,
and if you cannot buy spirits < f soap,
make home. It's very easy. Put two and
a half ounces of white castiie soap cut In
shavings into a pint bottle, add nine
ounces of alcohol and three ounces of
water. Cork the bottle and immerse it
in hot water, frequently shaking. When
the soap is dissolved allow the bottle ani
iis contents to become cool, then add
enough water to till the bottle. Let stand
fur twelve- hours, then filter. In the dry
condition that your skin is in. a cold
cream would be bt-tter for general use.
Try the one given- in to-day's Beautjr
Talk. Use it every night. Massaging th*
scalp with olive oil will help the dry con
dition.
MAE LUCEL.LEâ Never use vaseline
on the face unless you wish a tine crop
of whiskers. I think you can use the
cream with perfect safety. Perhaps the
powder that you use Is too heavy for
your skm. Try that suggested in foregoing
reply to <). L. U.
MURIEL. G. â As you are so very care
ful in using the iron on the hair I do not
think it is that that causes it to grow
thin at the sides. It is difficult to say
just why it becomes thin in one place
more than another. Try a firm, invig
orating massage of the scalp at the sides
with the tips of the fingers. This will
bring the blood to the surface, stimulate
the growth and put new life into the
i air bulbs. If the hair is very dry, then
use a little pure olive oil which has been
previously heated. The curling fluid which
1 have recommended from time to time
will not injure the hair and will certainly
keep it in better curl. Write to me again
if the condition of your hair does not im
prove under the treatment suggested.
CLARAâ I shall be only too pleased if
my advice la of benefit to you without
any sort of return. Keep on using the
skin food, and be sure in trying to erase
wrinkles always to rub across the lines,
Hold the kin firm with the fingers of one
hand while you massage. with the other,
using a tary motion. I wish you could
go to a â masseuse for one treatment,
see how she does it and then do it ex
actly the same way yourself. That is
really the -best way to learn, as it is dif
ficult to explain the movements in writ
ing. Use the following astringent lotion
for the large pores: Take. a half pint bot
tle and place In it three tablespoonfuls of
fresh, uncooked cucumber juice. Half fill
the bottle with elder flower water and
then add two tablespoanfuls of eau de
cologne. Shake well and add very slowly
half an ounce of simple tincture of ben
zoin, shaking th.> mixture now and then.
Fill the bottle with elder flower water. Be
sure that there are no settlings in the
benzoin, else it will be apt to curdle the
lotion. This can be used in the morning
fore powdering the face. * â

The Christmas Girl
and
Her Christmas Cloak
A Creation ir\ Velvet and Tulle.
Special to Th? Sunday Call.
T7 T? E\V YORK. Dec. 16.â T is win-
N^.l ter now. and the winter girl, in
all the beauty of her furs, is
| here. ShÂ«> is the Christmas girl,
, i ii glorious in her holiday furs and
her beautiful enveloping cloak.
The Christmas girl of IS9S baa an ex
tra beauty, for she wears such expensive
things, though sue wears them with a
grace.
The Christmas girl is now dressed in
her Christmas cloak, which is made of
very heavy stuff which reaches to the
ground all the way around. It is perhaps
a brocaded cloth with the brocades stand-
Ing out in silk upon it. It baa a lined
skirt, but the waist ia ti#ht* fitting and
closely to the figure â too closely to
suggest a mere Using. It is boned and
fitted to the waist, then fitter to the hips.
If you ask a woman her ideal Christmas
present, provided she has no winter cloak,
she will undoubtedly say "something to
wear." Her mind is already rix<'d upon
the handsome garments which you see in
the shops. They are bo wonderfully beau
tiful this season. Truly, sever were bro
cades and sflks and furs sy tastefully
combined Into fashionable garments One
of u.ese. a few days ago, was bein^c sam
pled by a young woman, who will receive
it undoubtedly later for a Christmas gift.
It was made of very heavy cloth bro
cade, with figures of a curious sort in it
that suggested chenille. The cloak was of
a deep green, with the figures of a lighter
shade. The waist was trimmed with
beautiful epaulets of ermine fur. They
were ruffled epaulets. Otherwise it was
perfectly plain. Indeed, its simplicity
would have been painful on any but an
ideal figure. The girl who was looking at
it, however, was as slender as a sylph,
and one can imagine how stylish she
â would be with the cloak tightly buttoned
to her figure.
With this cloak was worn a very cun
ning little "set" consisting of three
pieces. There was a boa of silver fox
with long, trailing ends; then there was
a green velvet muff with fox: heads and
tails upon the front. The sides of the
muff were lined with pink. Her hat waa
a lovely little toque, with fox tails
twisted around It. and a fox head with
tails curled around at the side. The hat
was finished with numerous Paradise
will make it almost colorless and will
after a time deaden it. Don't cut your
hair off yet awhile. Try this tonic first:
it is particularly good for hair that is dry
and stiff: Four ounces eau de cologne:
one-half ounce tincture cantharides and
one-fourth dram each of oil of lavender
and oil of rosemary. Apply to the roots
once or twice a day with a small sponge.
Whatever you do, do not wear a switch.
That keeps* the head hot* and in an un
healthy state that will not give the locks
half a chance to see what they can ao
in the growing line. Try the tonic for
six weeks and if it does not heip you
write to me again.
DOROTHY D.â The milk will not make
the hair grow on the face, but I cannot
see the efficiency of adding the salt to it.
Bathing the face in warm milk will fat
ten it, but I would omit the salt. Lse a
small pinch of borax instead. The salts
of tartar and lemon juice should not be
allowed to dry on the hair. It should
be applied and then rinsed out until the
hair is soft and fluffy. It is to be used
only on light hair. The recipe that you
sent me for lettuce cream is all right,
only I should use the tender, inside leaves
of the lettuce instead of the outside ones.
And do not use more than two ounces of
the liquid, else your cream will be too
soft. Also make it in a porcelain kettle
tin is injurious to the oils. A little per
fume added to it will improve it.
DORA A.â The recipe that you sent me
can be used with perfect safety, although
if your skin is inclined to be dry, the

tail feathers, which were its only trim
ming- It was a soft-crowned little hat
worn w.>ll back from the hair, which was
a pompadour.
It is rasy to imagine that the young
woman who wears a long tight fitting
cloak will not wear much underneath.
It is whispered that the young women
who look so sylphlike in these long gar
ments are dressed in a style which the
dress reformers would highly favor.
Were it nof for the corsets their under
wear would be ideal. It is whispered
that tights are worn, but we shall dis
countenance this.
Next to the skin they wear the tight
est of all wool combination suits, reach
ing from chin to ankle; over these comes
the corset; next there is a knitted long
sleeved corset cover of a delicate color,
which might â  l>e mistaken for a jersey
waist. It is pulled down snugly over the
hips. A very elaborate silk petticoat is
now put on at a length that nearly
touches tit*- Bidewalk. Over this the
long coat is buttoned. It fastens se
curely down the front from the neck to
the hem, being secured first with large
buttons and buttonholes set upon flaps,
then with large invisible hooks and eyes.
It takes a long time to get into one of
these lovely long brocaded cloaks, but It
is well worth the trouble, for they are
certainly marvels of prettiness.
Tin- fur muff has not gone out by any
means, but the velvet one has come in;
though if you were to actually canvass
you. would probably find three fur muffs
to one of velvet. The trouble with the
velvet muffs is that they are first expen
sive and then difficult to make. It takes
a muff-maker %f i experience to make a
muff. The ends must be so carefully stif
fened as to set out over the sleeves and
the muff must be nicely shaped.
Then there comes the question of the
fur heads and tails with which it is
trimmed, so that wnen the muff is com
pleted it is more expensive than the fur
one bought outright.
The cost of the long Christmas cloak is
really very great. You cannot get a
Christmas cloak for less than $50 ana you
may consider yourself lucky at taat.
There are really so many yards of mate
rial In the cloak, and the finish requires
such care, that it would not nay to get up
a big, handsome garment of this kind for
less money.
The Christmas woman spends all her
time in the streets, for the stores are
so alluring that she cannot stay in the
house. Theoretically she receives her
Christmas gifts on Christmas morning;
but actually they are handed out to he*,
one by one. by a kind-hearted Santa Claus
and you see her appear to-day in a new
cloak and to-morrow in a new cape, for
she knows that Santa Claus has more ia
store for her.
Many of the new cloaks have silk ruf
fles, but where a fur trimming is used
the silk ruffle is left on. Sometimes the
two are combined, ruffles and fur, but the
two are seldom pretty.
The favorite way of trimming the lone
cloak is with the ever popular band of
fur down the front. This gives elegance
and grace. There is something about the
up and down trimming which can never
be too highly appreciated, especially for
short people. Tfu- round and round ruf
fles, though universally worn, are not as
becoming to short figures as the straight
up and down styles.
To suit the^e figures many of the new
cloaks are trimmed from the belt to the
feet with bands sometimes of fur and
again at braid. The bands are of different
lengths. Some reach to the waist and
some to the knees. This gives a vertical
trimming which is very pretty.
In furs the Christmas favorites have
shown themselves to be the light furs.
Like a goddess a womt.n looks in the
beautiful snow white furs that are on the
market. Some of them have a bluish
tinge and some of them verge on yellow
and gray. There are silver fox. ermine
and chinchilla for the most popular, and;
among the most expensive come the polar
fox and polar bear, and the snow white
ermine with its "eyes" of queer, stiff
black.
The Christmas hair dressing will be very
elaborate, for Christmas parties are on
the tapis, and a woman must fix herself
up becomingly. Young women who want
to look very picturesque are crowding the
hair into a net and curling It on each
side. Others are puffing it elaborately
around the face and across the back so
as to make the head look large.
The Gainsborough beauties all had large
heads. The faces were small, and round,
the face was coiled a coiffure in beautiful
studied confusion. It was very pompa
dour, and there was another pompadour
back of the first; then came the puffs and
the curls. The same style prevails now
to a great extent and tne hair is as elab
orately dressed as you can imagine.
Many of the beautiful long cloaks have
brilliant linings, and when this cloak of
cloaks flies open 1t displays the lining.
L nderneath is a little plain silk gown,
bilk is admirably chosen to wear under
the cloak because it does not pull or drag.
To inquiring papas it may be said that
should they desire a handsome Christmas
gift for the daughter of the family they
could not do better than select one of
these long, handsome designs, for on
Christmas day it will be more than thank
fully received. HELEN WARD
J. G. ELAINE'S BURIAL PLACE.
A great many visitors have been at Oak
Hill lately who did not come because they
had relatives or friends buried there, but
because the cemetery has the monument
to John Howard Payne, the author of
"Home. Sweet Home." The Blame fam
ily lot is also a spot to which moat of the
pilgrims wend their way. Additional In
terest is just now attracted to the grave
of James G. Blame, because part of the
ground is not sodded and awaits the erec
tion of the headstone which his widow
has ordered. A fine old oak tree was in
the middle of this lot when Mr. Blame
selected it for his last resting place, and
he said "at the time it would form hia
monument. Much of the ground near the
lot had new earth put over it a few veara
ago to keep up the grade, and it ia
thought that this killed the tree, since
another close by has also died, and new
stands a lonely sentinel, covered with ivy
nearly to the top.
The California Hotel.
Among the leading caravansaries of
e>an Francisco is the California Hotel,
on Bush street. Its merits have drawn
to it as a permanent abiding place
many of the leading families of the
city. Among its features which com
mend it to the public is that of safety
against fire, it being the only absolute
ly fire-proof hotel in the city.
The California is especially popular
with the traveling public and among
its guests are numbered the most dis
tinguished people who visit the city.
The Hon. W. Clayton Pickersgill, the
British Consul, makes the hotel his
home. Many other notables of the
State and Federal service reside within
Its walls.
The hotel is the scene of the annual
reunions of many of San Francisco' 3
leading social societies and institutions
of learning. Its banquet rooms are
superbly appointed. It is surrounded by
newly and smoothly paved streets and
its guests are not aroused or disturbed,
by passing vehicles or clanging street
car bells. The billiard room and bar
are magnificently equipped and are

THIS is the season of the holly

roses cast their sweet perfumes at

HOW TO GIVE
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
CHILDREN are fond of surprises.
The same may be said of adults,
especially when they are laying
down temporarily the cares erf
life and being children again
"just for to-night." Christmas fruit
Is pleasing to both great and small â
to the former because it is a clever de
vice, to the latter because of the good
ies and gifts they find within it.
An orange will serve as an admirable !
example because it is easy to make and
pretty to look at. For its use orange- i
colored cloth â that having a stippled j
surface, like mummy cloth â will most
closely imitate the real fruit. For each
orange cut four or five oval sections, j
pointing the ends.
A real orange may be used as a pat
tern by cutting the peel in sections in ;
the ordinary manner from the stem I
point to the opposite center, removing j
It and using one section by which to \
cut out the cloth sections. Join all j
these sections together, leaving, how- 'â 
ever, an opening between the adjoining !
edges of iwo ot them through which '
to insert the candy, toy or other gift j
it is to contain. A green cord stem by ;
which to suspend it, if desired, may j
then be added. Prettier still appears ;
this fruit if a leaf or two of artificial or j
real foliage is attached.
The same idea can be carried out in j
various kinds of fruit, pears, apples and
bananas btlig very prettily made of j
smooth fabrics, with the former two
tinted to imitate the rosy cheeks of the !
real fruit. Peaches made of pale buff
Velvet may have painted cheeks and j
look very natural. Lemons, tomatoes â 
and cucumbers may be added to the I
collection in the way of variety, though i
children will not be specially attracted
by them.
A Christmas feature much enjoyed by
children and often indulged in by
adults is a Christmas pie in which
are concealed trin-
kets, toys and
knick-knacks for
general distribu
tion. The pie may

be "made" by placing the trifles desig- ]
nated In a large basin or pan, as the
number of them demands, rirst attach
ing to each one end of a string two or
three feet long. To the other ends of j
these strings should be fastened tiny
bmvs of bright, pretty ribbon.
The "crust" of a Christmas pie is
sometimes made of tissue paper, some
times of bran, either one presenting' the
appearance of rich, well-browned pas
try. If the "crust" is to be of tissue
paper the strings must be arranged all
around the basin, so that the ribbon
bows will fall just over the rink or sit
up around it when the "crust" is laid on
and tucked in all round. Or this style
of "crust" may have fancy openings in
the shape of stars, leaves, vines or flow
ers cut in it, and through these from
the under side may pass the ends of the
strings that are fastened to bows.
The other "crust" is formed of a thick
layer c-f bran scattered over the con
tents of the pie to conceal them and the
strings or cords, only the ribbon bows
of which appear on the surface, for all
the world like little tulips and cro
cuses. All around this pie will be a
wreath of holly or some pretty Christ
mas green.
The pie is passed, or if very large it
Is placed on the middle of the supper
table or on a small table in the center
of the room. Each guest selects a bow,
pulls the string, and out comes his
plum in the shape of a pretty gift

and c-ne enjoyed by young and old is
called the hanging stocking. A huge
stocking is pre- __
pared two or

cureÂ»y pasted together. A good plan
Is to cut one-half of the stocking an
inch larger all round than the other
half. Then lap the extra width over
the smaller side and paste it down This
will prevent the unfinished appearance
resulting from pasting the two edges
together and besides will prove more
durable.
The stocking is filled with light toys,
trinkets and trifles and hung from the
ceiling. Each guest, in turn, is blind
folded, given a light cane or n.d turned
three times around and then is told to
advance and hit the bag. Many are
the misses, as every one who has ever
attended a donkey party will surmise.
The first hit, however, breaks the bag
and the contents come tumbling down.
A scramble for them ensues, and every
body comes forth smiling, whether suc
cessful in securing a souvenir or not
Another ending to Christmas festivi
ties Is the securing of the prize toy. A
fine toy is fastened upon the wall and
fired at with a .
paper dart, a tiny
bc-w and arrow or
a putty gun. A

should no one actually hit the toy it is
given to the one whose shot Is nearesL

toy to the marksman firing the shot.
Second and third prizes may be put up

fide in the wall prize is conducted on
the â¢'blindfold" plan. A square of paste
board with a hole at the center, five or
six inches in diameter, is fastened, up
right, in front of a prize toy. Three
"turn arounds" and one thrust are al
lowed each candidate. The chances of
winning are about even with those of
hitting the hanging stocking.
This method of distributing gifts is
most pleasing to little folks, for it
is a sort of hide-and-soek game.

discover something that she likes or

cords have been carried in and out and
round about rooms and furniture, and

anchored in some corner or out-of-the
way place. The following of these
cords is great fun and the "find" at the
end always greatly appreciated.
DIFFICULTIES OF
AN INTERVIEWEH
MYSTIC FORCE THAT fUBJU
GATES DISEASE.
Priestess of the New Dispensation
That Discards the Surgeon*
Scalpel and Physician's
Drugs.
I went up to the Emma SpreckeTs
building yesterday instructed to ob
tain an interview with one of the most
unique and interesting personalities of
which this r- ny-sided metropolis can
boast for the benefit of the readers of
the Christmas Call. Interviewing has
its difficulties at times, and when your
vis-a-vis is a delightful conversation
alist, and talks charmingly and freely
on any subject, except herself, what
are you going to do?
Who has not heard of Dr. Nellie
BeighJe, San Francisco's beloved "Lit
tle Doctor," whose name is an inspira
tion to once darkened lives and homes?
She occupies an entire side of the
Spreckels building on the fourth floor,
and these rooms, furnished with quiet
elegance, are the Mecca of daily in
creasing throngs afflicted with almost
all of humanity's ills. Tne reception
room was well filled in the morning
hour, and it was a veritable pleasure to
note the quick light of confiding affec
j tion that came into the eyes of her
i patients as she entered.
I have mentioned how reluctantly
! she alludes to herself. Instinctively
â  shrinking from notoriety, a character
! istic well understood by her friends.
But her admirers are more communi
cative, and lovingly dwell on her mirac
ulous gifts, her life consecrated to the
! noblest uses that this world can afford
â the divine mission of healing. They
tell of men and women, prominent in
the world of business, learned pro
| fessions and society, a prey to devour
ing disease, dwellers in an Inferno of
sorrow, to whom the world's physicians
i could bring no balm or hope, rescued by
the "Little Doctor's" divine art and en
riched with health's energies and en-
joyments.
From these grateful spirits what is
written here was obtained, the gentle
Doctor being inflexible in not permit
ting the names of patients to be used.
The development of magnetic power
hÂ» the Doctor's wondrous right arm is
familiar history. Its potency to subju
gate disease came as a revelation, and
this earnest soul, herself a woman ot
culture, a former teacher in the public
schools, saw in the occult energy that
so strangely became part of her only
the path of duty and enlarged opportu
nities of doing good. The sick came to
her. and her success attracted the at
tention of scientists and the medical
profession. Here was a new concep
tion of Nature, and it mystified them.
They were fettered with the prejudices
of ancient schools and they could not
understand this new enlargement of
human power. A committee of th*Â»
Oakland Psychical Research Society
was appointed to investigate her. She
modestly appeared before it. The
signed report speaks of the rigid pre
cautions observed and specifies the
manner in which she demonstrated her
power by placing her right hand upon
the head of a member of the commit
tee, who "reported feeling a distinct
shock, similar in character to which
one would receive when coming in con
tact with an electric battery. When
the lady touched the hair upon
his head with the tips of her fingers
the result was the same. If shfi
touched the back of the chair the same
force was observed."
The report is very interesting and re
ceived wide publicity. Suffice it to
say that the committee was thorough
ly convinced of her power.
What is this mystic force which sets
at naught the learning of the schools?
By its fruits it can be judged. "Dr.
Beighle saved my life," said one of the
most prominent merchants in the city.
"I tried the best physicians in the Bast
and in Europe without avail. She cur^d
me permanently." A United States
Senator testified to a cure of stomach
and liver complaint that the most fa
mous springs and physicians could not
relieve. But space forbids the recit.il
of cases of restored health from the
lipe of grateful men and women.
The Doctor exemplifies in her own
person the secret and living force with
which God has dowered her; she is
radiant with health and grace, and her
features express her soul and Its aspi
ration?. Her innate sympathy repro
duces in her gentle breast the suffering
of the patient. This may explain in
part her success in nervous diseases
and her modest reference to it. "I am
deeply interested in this cruol form of
disease and I cherish the grateful tes
timony of sufferer?; whom it has been
my privilege to restore to health."
The regime of scalpel and drug seems
tn be passing away and in its stead
has come the new dispensation of which
the "Little Doctor" is the seer and
priestess. Lt'RA SMALLEY.
There are some tailgate* suill in Phila
delphia, which leads the -Telegraph of

BUCHANAN BROS.. ftfc
Brush Manufacturers. 609 Sacrament* *"HE Medlarks knew all about Christmas, and Ambrose, the oldest boy,
Tkn-w who was Santa Claus. But that is a secret which the elders
always keep; and Ambrose never told Clay, who was eight, nor Pearl,
who was three, and firmly believed Santa Claus lived in the sky where
the snow was; because he was said to come down the chimney just as
tho snow did once.
The Medlark chimney needed mending in spite of all Mrs. Medlark and
Ambrose could do with mud, plaÃter and stones. Dr. Thomas Jefferson Med
lark, Ambrose's father, had been a bricklayer (just as he had been a carpenter
and a butcher, and a blacksmith and a veterinary surgeon), and. early in the
summer, he had promised Mrs. Medlark that he would "git the chlmbly in
shape Boon's ever he come raoun' to it." The season was now late in De
r, but apparently Dr. Medlark had not "come raoun 1 " to the chimney.
The neighbors said that Dr. Thomas Jefferson Medlark "was as trif'.in' as he
was smart." Fortunately, Mrs- Medlark was "stirrin'," and Ambrose was
"as wiilin 1 a boy as ever lived." Thus, in spite of Thomas Jefferson's dis
inclination to labor, the Medlarks had risen out of the condition of â¢â¢movers"
into "renters"; and owned a horse, a herd of cows and Innumerable fowls.
It was Mrs Medlark who told th<- children about Christmas. She managed
to have a show of Christmas-cheer for dinner, and always took them to the
Christmas tree at the schoolhouse. What a wonderful tree was that, to
children who hardly tasted candy t
ar! A whole beautiful red or -
or yellow tarlatan bag, overflowing
with candy, and one sift, at least, be
sides, were handed by Santa Claus in
j"-rs<>n to every child. Neither did the
plantation Santa I'laus think it fair to
little boys and girls to half fill a candy
has with corn, as, it is painful t<> con
sider, is done by pome unscrupulous
Sunday-school Santa Clauses in the
North nf America.
Xot he; his candy bass wero candy
baps, and not what the old negro aun
ties would call "a mixtery."
Ambrose Medlark knew very well
why Santa ciaus" jolly red face never
Btopped smiling;, and why it sometimes
was a little crooked on his neck, and
then abruptly seemed to tret straight;
nnd ho knew why he wore a sealskin
car like Mr. Francis' and a buffalo
robe like Mrs. Carroll's, and talked in a
voice precisely lik>> T'ncle Billy Ruff
ner's. And he knew about the gifts for
the different friends being sent in to
the schoolhouse. He. too, bought (,'hrist
mas Presents. Like most Arkansas
children, he earned a little money by
picking cotton. For years the' lad had
paid for hi? annual suit of clothes and
his annual pair of shoes out of his own
earnings. What he could save went
Into his Christmas hoard. One proud
year he actually bought his father a
pair of boots. This year Mr. Francis
had in charge an o!l cloth table cover
for hi? mother, a little red rocking chair
for Pearl, the baby, a wagon for Clay
and a pipe and package of tobacco for
Dr. Medlark.
"Yes, I got 'em all settled, slick," Am
br 3e thought complacently, one morn
lnsr nÂ°ar Christmas, "only 'cept paw. I
must alt suthin' more for paw. Ain't
It tew bad T done spent nil my money,
kase paw did borrM that ar dollar I
Mowed fur ter spend on him. Honey,
don't you git so rich that hops' feet,
or hi? heels'll jest spatter out on ye"'
He stopped in hi? occupation of load
ing the waÃon -with cotton to lift the
child and place her at a safe distance,
She was a rosy little creature, very
fair, with her yeliow curls blown about
hor shoulders and her eyes as blue pÂ«Â»
sapphire?. Ambrose thought that she
was the most beautiful b^ing on earth.
To-day she was going to the settlement
with him. and she wore her best frock
of plaided woollen stuff nearly covered
with a white apron: and her yellow
curls were crowned by a red toboggan
cap.
"There ain't a patch nor a tear on
her." thought thÂ« proud brother: and
he did not care in the least that his
own shirt was ragged and that his thin,
ban- ankles Bhowed above his coarFe
shoes, because he had spent his stock
in c; money for the copper-toed shoes on
Pearl's fei t.
"Bleeged ter keen paw an' the little
chicks comfortable," said Ambrose.
"Me an' maw's ruggider an' kin stan'
th.' weather."
If he were rugged his looks gave the lie to his Btrength. For, in spite of
his fourteen y.-;ns. lads of twelve are often taller; and he was worn by hard
work until his .sharp little elbows and shoulder blades looked ready to prick
through his thin clothes. Yet his face kept a childish Innoci nee and beauty in
the clear skin, th* curly, dark-brown hair and trusting brown eyes; though
his brows had a continual pucker of anxiety and determination and bis mouth
was too firm. As he lifted his cotton basket to empty it you could see that
th<- fingers of one hand were crooked. Really, they had been broken, and were
Bet by the veterinary surgeon so unskillfully that they were a sorry sight. But
you must not make such a criticism to Ambrose; he was proud of "paw's
bone-settin'," as he was of everything that the worthless fellow did.
.Mis. Medlark had bred her children in the firm faith that their father was
a wonderful man, whose occasional "misery in the back" and "hurtin 1 in the
leader if his left leg," kepi him from making a Bhining success.
Ambrose glorified in his father's versatile talent. In his fluent, braggart
speech, in his courage and aptness with guns and horses; which, truly enough,
'.â .â¢â :â â  considerable. It did not disturb the boy's blind hero-worship that his
father had a violent temper and would have gusts of unreasoning fury, likf>
a negro's, in which he wfis as likely as not to beat his children cruelly, When
such excesses occurred Mrs. Medlark would pel the victim and ?ny, as in e\
"Vou' paw ben bavin" one i-r his spells in^t nighi an' looks like h"
caynt enjure nothin' this mornin'! He docs suffer turrible in them spells."
Ambrose simply dodged the blows and forgave, and kept Clay out of his
father's way if the latter seemed "ill"â the charitable Arkansas name for Ill
red. "Pore paw; reckon he caynt help it:" lie thought. "Ain't it mussi
ful good luck he never dues hit Pearl!"
It was true; the baby carried the key of her father's heart and he was
never impatient with her.
"Reckon he don't guess how powerful hard lie kin hit." Ambrose considered.
To tell the truthâ although Ambrose hid !t even from his motherâ he owed those
trukpn fingers to a passionate random blow 'from his fatb.ee
"Law he. Ye didn't go to do it. paw." were his first words, while he grinned
through his tears of pain, "an 1 ye kin set it, good's ever."
Medlark was affected by the child's bravery. He had never been so harsh
â vith him since; but this morning his patience failed at the sight of Peurl
f-traving under the beast's hoofs. He shook Ambrose and cuffed bis <- H rs Â°e
fore he placed the child tenderly in a box among the cotton.
"Looks like you iixir." ter kill the little (hick," was his
surly parting word. "Ye don't 'pear to keer fur nuthin' nur
nary, 'cept havin' you' time an' you' kill *er some day with
you' keerless ways. "
The tears started under Ambrose's eyelids, but he wink
ed them away. "Reckon not," said he in a gruff voice.
Dr. Medlark glowered after the boy and the unequally
consorted team of horse and ox, as they slipped out of sight
down the hollow.
Presently the ox's horns and the horse's head emerged;
next came Ambrose's little figure; first one elbow made an
angle In the air, then the other. "Ef the little fool ain't
crying!" snarled Medlark.
He walked back to the house, kicking the frozen earth
with his heels and grumbling to himself. Usually he was
gay. open-tempered and sanguine; but to-day he felt himself
aggrieved. Every year he invested what money he could
spare in lotteries, and always $5 went to the Louisiana lot
tery. Nobody knew of it. because for years he walked six
miles to another postofflce to send his letters containing the
money.
No one can calculate how much money comes out of lean
pocketbooks in the South for lotteries. The negroos would
pell their skins, if they could, to buy chances. "Laws, boas!"
a negro said to one moralist; "I don't call $3 high fur a year's
hopin'!"
The visions of wealth which Medlark bought with his
lottery tickets were real fascination. No sooner did the
magic slip of pasteboard come to him than his fancy be
came intoxicated. Every year he grew more sure of winning,
Ambrose's Christmas Girl
All Rights Reser%-ed.

and he swaggered about, gloating over his secret fine fortune. Half his dis
taste for work was due to his craving to sit and sun himself and plan what
he would do with his money. He was going to buy a farm and machinery and
ride about on the fastest horse of the county, and wear a starched shirt every
day. with a diamond in his cravat. He was very liberal in his dreams. His
wife should have a black girl to help her, and he would give Ambrose a gun,
and the baby the most splendid doll that could be bought. He was munificent
to all his humble friends; and this made him feel what a good fellow he was,
how superior to the selfish people about him. So his vain imaginations went
on from year to year, working mischief underground.
This yearâ this very week, in fact â he had received a dreadful blow. The
letter that he sent to the lottery agent, consequently the money for his ticket,
had been lost! It was not registered, so it could not be traced. When he wrote to
the agent asking for the ticket the agent replied that no money and no such
lt-fter hud been received. Medlark raged; but what could he do? He had no
mom y: there was no time to earn anything before the drawing. No use, either,
to apply to Mrs. Medlark (though he knew very well that she had more than
$^i hoarded in an old stocking and buried under the fireplace), because she was
prejudiced against lotteries, as a result of her uncle's experience, who had
spent $115 in two years in tickets and never had received a cent's worth back.
.Mrs. Medlark used to say bitter things about them. But she had no sense,
anyhow, In the doctor's opinion. She would cry and sny that it was for the
children, when she was just saving it to buy a yoke of oxen. Hadn't she
made it all out of his chickens, too? Medlark was consumed with a sense of
grievance.
When did the wicked device first slip into his mind? I dare say he did not
know himself; all the morning it had been there, pricking his thoughts, an
ugly, nagging thing, like a thorn in his shoe. "I wouldn't do her so mean
fur anything on earth," he declared stoutly, when the temptation first ap
peared. Then: " 'Twud sarve her no more than right, snoopin' raoun' and
hidin' money 'way from her own husband!" And then â alas for Thomas Jef
ferson Medlark, who had always been an honest man! â tlien, he began to
think of ways' to steal the money.
No wonder Ambrose found his father irritable that morning! Meanwhile,
thp sweet-temper* d buy was already finding excuses for the man. "I had orter
been more keerful-like," he thought, penitently. "He jes natchelly got skeered
up, an' folks allers git ill when they're skeered. Waal, I wisht I got suthin'
nicer fur him Christmas!"
It was not very long before they emerged from the thick woods along the
river bank. Though it was December there was a genial warmth in the air
.'mcl ihe nioist earth had a smell like spring. The waves of the river were a
dark green, winding between willow-topped banks and disappearing in the
vast and somber cypress forests. Over the river lay the little settlement. The
low white houses, the dull-gray mill, from which came an incessant buzz of
tolling machinery, and the brighter tints of Mrs. Carroll's house had no relief
of green foliage, now that even the water oak boughs were bare. But there
was a sober richness about the landscape with its morning shadows â the sun
burning <>;â¢, the whitish-brown stalks <>f the cotton fields, the purple hues of
the willows in the foreground, the pink shades in the blur of distant "urn trees.
through which the. sycamore trunks showed like chalk Urn's, the splashes of
green holly or mistletoe among the dark tracery i apalnst the blue sky, and the
ruby-like glitter of rowan berries maklne their own brilliant effect in every pool.
"Ain't it pretty, Sis?" said Ambrose. "Must's pretty's the Christmas tree.
My word, that's Miss Carroll!"
He could have shouted for Joy, because at the sight of Miss Carroll there
flashed over him a scheme for obtaining the most beautiful Christmas gift for
his father.
Miss Carroll's graceful figure was poised with a little backward bend before
a camera, and her head was hidden under a black velvet focusing cloth. She
waved her hand at the children to get out of the way. "Or I'll take you,"
she cried.
"Where'll she take we uns?" asked Pearl, anxiously.
"She won't take us anywhere," answered Ambrose; "it's that ar trick with
the black cloth an* it takes folkses."
"Good little children, tew?" said Pearl, at once associating a camera with
bears and wild hogs and the "black man," who carry "mean" little Arkansas
children off bodily â at least, so the mothers say.
"Baby's good; baby ain't mean," she added. Put Ambrose hardly heard
the plaintive little tones, he was so absorbed in his daring scheme. He drove
the wagon nearer Miss Carroll, until he could speak to hor.
}'>\irl began to whimper. "Baby 'faid! Bud hold baby!"
Ho was In a great haste, but he put his arms about her in the box. She
clung to him, and instantly began to smile.
"Miss Carroll," said Ambrose, with his heart in his mouth, "does ye want
me ter fotch up a pail of scaly-bark hick'ry nuts?"
'*Yes, thank you," said Miss Carroll.
"They â they ain't fur a present, exzackly," said Ambrose, very red and
miserable; "I want ye to do suthin' fur me fur 'em. Kinâ kin ye draw folkses
good iz trees an' haouses, ma'am?"
"Do you want me to 'draw you,' Ambrose?"
"Naw, ma'am. Pearl thereâ fur a Christmas gift to paw." His eyes were
sparkling with eagerness.
"Well, I have taken one photograph," said Miss Carroll kindly. "But never
mind; you shall have one taken your own way. Get Pearl out and stand up."
Ambrose knew what it was to have "his picter drawed," and he pulled out
thj folds of Pearl's frock and brushed her hair with his hand and crossed her
hands stiffly in front of her, precisely as he remembered his mother's having
done, when they went to the photograph boat, Clay and he, six years ago.
"Will she do, naow?" said he. And Miss Carroll had not the heart to change
anything, she merely told him to come into the picture also. He said that nil

clothes were not right; but when she explained that she would only take the
picture to his knees, above where the big patch was, he consented; and putting
his left hand on his sister's shoulder, he spread the right close to his side, stood
very straight, and glared sternly into the lens. "Now, don't ye wink nur
move, sis," said he, â¢'till Miss Carroll tells ye, an' I'll give ye my pretty gourd â
quit now!" But Pearl squirmed and wanted to turn her head.
"Pearl, ye got ter keep still, an' quit you' meanness!" whispered Ambrose
in anger; he was desperate lest the picture should be spoiled. "Ef ye don't,
ye won't git drawed!"
"Baby don' wanter be drawed," said the intractable Pearl; "baby wants
t' ride in the waggin."
Ambrose was at his wit's end; he thought of the childish dread of the
camera and, I am sorry to say, he whispered fiercely in the little ear: "Ef
ye don't be good, the black uick'll git ye:"
The threat served its purpose. Poor Pearl smothered her sobs and stared
with a most wretched expression at the three-legged monster. In a second it
was all over, and Miss Carroll was shouldering the camera.
Ambrose bashfully offered to "tote" it for her to the ferryboat.
The ferry was an old raft-iike oraft unprotected by guards of any kind.
Miss Carroll was busy with her camera, focusing a midriver view; that is
how she came to lay the plateholder on the wagon, where it was a great pleasure
tf- Pearl, who carefully removed the top slide. All wite an' pitty!" cried Pearl
gleefully. Miss Carroll's exclamation of horror struck cold to Ambrose's heart.
'Tiny ain't no picter on this one," he ventured to plead; "it's plumb white!"
"Yes, it's ruined," said Miss Carroll, and if ever in his life Ambrose w r anted
to slap baby sister, It was then. "Luck

rectly. After you have unloaded your

You may be sure Ambrose lost no
time in getting back to the big house.
He was greeted at the kitchen door by
Aunt Caledonia, the cook. "Ye seekin*
Miss Dora? Wall, I doan' reckon ye
kin see 'er. Miss Dora, is ye in de dark
room?"
A voice came back: "Wait a minute,
Callie; don't let anybody in."
"She in de dark room," said Caledo
nia solemnly. "Ye all better be gwlne."
Ambrose only shuffled his feet and held
Pearl's hand tightly.
"It's a picter," he ventured. "She's
done drawed Pearl's picter."
Caledonia scowled. "Looks like dis
yere hull settlement low t' git Miss
Dora draw dar picters fur nufhin'," she
remarked sarcastically. .
"I ain't gwine have Pearl drawed fur
nothing'," said Ambrose, trying to pro
pitiate. "I. gwine foteh 'er a big pail
scaly-bark hick'ry nuts. "Will I fotch
ye one, tew?"
"Do hush, the critter!" shouted the
unappeased- Caledonia, in her deepest
notes of scorn. "Scaly-bark hick'ry
nuts! Boy, we all is wallerin' in scaly
bark hick'ry nuts a'ready!"
Poor Ambrose was dun*. 1 â¢ :..
"Trackin' up my clean flo wid you'

nia's wrath flowed on with swelling
turbulence â "looks like de hull settle

picter. I tell ye hit sho 1 not be done
t'day, nohow."
Ambrose slunk away abashed, all his
visions of Christmas glories like broken
soap bubbles.
Nevertheless, he returned to the set
tlement with Pearl the day before
Christmas. His father had been kind
to him in the interval; affectionate as
usual to Pearl, and more than usually
industrious. Ambrose admired his
mighty strokes with the ax. He fol
lowed him about like a dog seeking to
help him.
"I'd really like to give Ambrose a
right nice Christmas gift," thought
Medlark. "Fact is, in justice t' the
children, I'd orter have that money. I'll
save some o't out fur them." .
â¢Ambrose longed day and night for
his picture, and at last, the day before
Christmas, he determined to make one
more appeal to Miss Carroll.
Scaly-bark hickories bein<" so de
spised he had cast about in his mind for
a- more acceptable offering, and finally
hit upon a 'possum, which he felt sure
would be pleasing to the â¢ dragon . who
guarded the â that is, Aunt Callie,
Night after night did he go out hunting with some men of the neighborhood,
until his services were considered valuable enough to be rewarded with a
The "next day he took Pearl (because Mrs. Medlark was washing and pre
paring for Christmas), packed her in the rude wagon which his father had
made for her. and trudged away to the store. How ablaze it was with gaiety
and festive preparation! The glass cases were littered with picture books.
Innumerable red wagons and dolls hung from a rope stretched across the
shelves. There were new hats and bonnets and piles of beautiful, ready-made
clothes, and cups and saucers with '"Love the giver," 0 "To a good boy, or
"To a good girl," on them, and splendid gilt jewelryâ a dazzling display! The
store was full, too: everybody, black and white, laughing and joking. But
the only person that Ambrose saw in all the crowd was Miss Carroll. Before
he could get his ragged cap off, much less offer his "possum, she held out a
package to him saying, in her sweet, kind voice: "Why, Ambrose! I was
going to bend this to you."
â¢â¢],<>t him see the negative first," said -Mr. Francis, who was looking at a
little glass pane. "There you are, boy." All Ambrose's Southern politeness
barely availed to stifle a gVnan of dismay. Truly enough, there were the ox
and the horse, the wagon and the children, the hills and river, but what an
awful change had come to the faces?
Little Pearl laughed aloud. "Pitty niggers!" cried the baby gleefully.
â¢â You hush!" admonished Ambrose; but he added, in apology, "we uns
faces is kinder black."
"I forgot," said Miss Carroll, "you don't know that what is white in the
negative becomes black in the print, and the other way, too. You will like the
print better. These are yours, Ambroseâ one for your father, one for your
mother, one for you. Look at them."
Miss Carroll had taken great pains, and at a time when she had little
leisure but she felt repaid by the look of speechless ecstasy that stole over
Ambrose's face. He thought that he had never seen anything so beautiful.
They were, indeed, admirable prints, toned to a rich brown, and the lens had
caught the children's faces in their moment of abandon with charming fidelity.
"Lucky it was the stiff one that was destroyed and not the other," said Miss
Carroll. "Well, Ambrose, will you carry my camera to the river for me?"
"I never kin thank you. ma'am," said Ambrose. He walked along by her
side, holding the legs of* the camera with an awful sense of responsibility. He
had sent ail his other presents away to the schoolhouse,
but the photographs he would not allow to go out of his
sight, or rather, out of his feelings, for he carried them
carefully in his hands. There wer# reasons why he should
not trust them to his pockets.
A slouching yet athletic shape was lounging on the
river bank when they approached. Much amazed. Am
brose greeted his father. Medlark wore. Miss Carroll
thought, rather a hang-dog look. He explained that he
had been to the store and was now on his way up-country
to sell a few turkeys. As vouching for his words the tur
keys cackled and fluttered under his hand. Nevertheless,
Miss Carroll suspected the fowls to be- no better than a
pretext, and that his real errand would take him to a cer
tain distillery in the hills. But she wronged him; for Dr.
Medlark w-as going to no worse place than the PostofMce.
Yet she did not altogether wrong him, since, pinned under
his flannel shirt was a letter to the lottery agent contain
ing $5 of Mrs. Medlark's hard savings.
"Come on in, if you' goin'," called the ferryman
roughly to Medlark. He was a hard-working, prosperous
man, who had small regard for the doctor. Medlark BCOWled
and strode after the others. Meanwhile, no sooner had
Pearl scrambled out of the wagon than she straightway
began to be "mean." Ambrose tried to control her. un

HOW THE MELBA GRAND
OPERA SEASON
WILL AFFECT SAN FRANCISCO
DON'T L- reckless enough to
spend all your money on holiday
gifts. The Melba season com
mences in the Grand Opera
house in the month of March
and promises to be worth all
that can be saved up for It. Besides
the gowns and coats that you will have
to purchase. Rosen thai, the pianist,
gives three concerts here early In Janu
ary that everybody will want to buy
tickets for. Rosenthal, from all ac
counts, is a new power and a new tem
perament in the pianistlc world. His
strength and technique are said to
know no limit; he takes the mosi diffi
cult chromatic passages in octaves, and
his tone is prodigious. He is the San
i] iw of the pianoforte. And he is an im
portant musician as we'!. Itosenthfil
will deserve his share of our amuse
ment money, giving pood value for
every cent and casting over his pa
trons a halo of culture and fashion sec
ond only to ilia i cast by Paderewskl.
But the opera is the big thing. We
have a reputation to sustain as opera
goers; we are known to Impresarios
the world over as safe patrons of a
good thing, and this season promises to
be the best ever given In San Francis
co, for besides Melba In the older Ital
ian pieces, we will have Gadski and an
entire German company In at least sev
en different Wagnerlan productions. So
far we have known Wagner only from
cheap productions. This season prom
ises us seven of his music dramas au
thoritatively sung, acted and staged.
Wagner nights will alternate with Ital
ian nights, and it is to be hoped that
the former will be as popular as the lat
ter. Mr. Ellis promises that nothing
shall be too good for us. Mr. Ellis is
frankly fond of San Francisco. lie
came here last season with Melba and
a tiny company, and the town rose to
his attraction at $7 a seat. Considering
the limited company we made a record
for reckless expenditure. And now we
shall reap the reward. Mr. . Ellis . has
confidence In the town so much .so
thai it is very doubtful if he asks for
any guarantee subscription; he has
done what no one else has been' able
to do, and that is Induce Mr. Morocco
to open the Grand Opera-house to an
outside attraction.; and he will give us
a great deal more than we had lasr sea
son for less money. A great many per
sons have an idea that a swell season of
opera is a bad thing for the finances of
a city, that like a circus a traveling
opera company scoops up all the wealth
in sight and leaves the community in a
state of commercial gloom. This is a
mistake. Apart from the artistic side
of the question, nothing could be better
or the general trade of the town.

ment of a grand opera season. The
prosperity of that ambitious venture

eficial results of Mr. Ellis' tact and
judgment. In addition to presenting the
name of Melbaâar.d a name of mighty
magic, it te~ his company will include
the following additional singers: Mes

BY MARIE ALLEN KIMBALL
NIGGER BILL wanted a blar.k
hook with big red flowers on it
like Henry Mason's.
There was only one left. He
had gone into the drug store to
look, and if he didn't pet 10 cents to
day somebody else would buy it.
Bill went round to the butcher shop
if Mr. Werry hadn't left his
glasses at home; he'd given him "a
bit"' once for going after them. But
there they were on top of his big nose.
He asked Tommy Briggs if he wouldn't
give him 10 cents to peddle his coffee
at the train; but he laughed and said
"Nobody would buy of such a scare
crow."
Nigger Bill was a funny looking lit
tle fellow, as odd as his name, which
â¢ gloried inâ he was so afraid of be
ing called "an Injun."
He was a very small boy, with the in
ly black face, bright eyes and
white teeth of the African, while his
ght, coarse hair showed *iis Indian
ancestry.
He wore a pair of old boots so much
too big that he had to shuffle along, and
ket bo small that the sleeves end
p 1 at th^ elbows.
He was trying to school, carrying a
very big lard bucket, with very little
dinner in it, and feeling pretty -
Around the corner of the freight house
boya beckoned to him. "Say, Nig-
Bfll, I'll give you 10 cents if you'll
take this note to old Rogers and tell
him Mrs. Kerrigan gave it to you."
The black boy expanded into a broad
CÂ« risrht." he said, joyfully;
I hnny. will I eotch it?"
"Pooh! Of course not. It's from me
mother. She's afu>r wanting her good
boy .xcused this week to work; and
will his Honor Bend Johnny's books.
that he may be after the lessons of an
;ig?"
"Oh. rich:" And Johnny Kerrigan
doubled himself over with laughter.
h me going to his old school the
week of the races! And he won't find
i .ut I'm playing truant."
Will he kill me if he does?" asked
Nijrger Bill, anxiously.
No, you scared cat; of course not.
Here's your money, and I'll be after
waiting alons here for the books to
nipht.
Nigger Bill looked at the little silver
piece in his hand; his eyes shone. He
shuffled around to the drug store and
bought the blank book. But somehow
. ippies on it did not look as red
and pretty as he thought they did.
He went along to school, but he did
not feel good. He had to lie to Mr.
Rogers, the principal, of whom he had
a mortal terror.
Mr. Rogers, Nigger Bill was con
vinced, must be crazy, though he'd
never told anybody bo; for he had seen
him more than once cracking open
stones in the old North Star mine, and
writing things in a book; and nobody'd
worked there since Bill could remem
ber â or prospected, either.
Then Nigger Bill had had one per-
I experience with him. lie thought
:itas he went along. Miss Car
roll, his teacher, always smiled when
she recalled the incident.
Eight little boys of them had got into
n fuss on the playgrounds and Miss
Carroll said they must remain after
â â !. Mr. Rogers came in. He car
i very long, large stick in his
hand (his show switch) and fixed his
keen eyes on the trembling little cul
prits. Then he turned to their teacher
and asked her "if she would have the
kindness to close all the windows. He
did not want their yells to disturb the
children outside."
Th-n he asked in stentorian tones,
pointing the long stick at them: "Boys,
have your mothers got any sticking
r?"
"Yes, sir; yes, sir," came from sixteen
tr-niulous lips.
"You'll need it when you get home.
Do you know what you'll want it for?"
"No-o, sir."
"To cover yourselves with. Miss
Carroll, it will be dark here presently.
Boys, do you know why?"
Christmas
Morning
Soldiers
Boys' and Girls' Page
"No-O-O, sir." amid falling tears.
"Dark from the Hying pieces of your
clothes. Take off your coats."
Eight little jackets came off, eight
shaking little forms stood before the
principal.
"Stand apart. Give me plenty of
room."
He stepped back, squared himself,
tried the switch two or three times,
then hastily pulled out his watch.
"So late! Miss Carroll, I have an en
gagement with a man, I positively have
not time to whip these boys. Put on
your jackets, but if I catch you in mis
chief again you'll remember it. Go!"
Nigger Bill had always thought that
a miraculous escape, and now he was
to help lie for Johnny Kerrigan, and a
lie Mr. Rogers would not tolerate. He
was sure the more he thought about it
that he would be killed if he were
found out. But he had spent the money
and he must do it. Risked all that for
a poppy blankbook! He wished he had
kept to his old slate. Nigger Bill won
dered if he could get an old geography
cover anywhere; the boys said if "you
put a geography cover under your shirt
it wouldn't hurt, only you must holler
just as loud!
Things went along smoothly until
day before Christmas. Then Mrs. Ker
rigan appeared.
"What is it I'm being told?" she
asked, her face red with heat and in
dignation, "that you was after excusing
me Johnny from school this week, and
him blatherskiting around the races,
an' me slaving- meself to death to kape
him at the books!"
"Madam, I excused him at your re
quest. You sent me a note by "that col
ored boy."
"Me? Proud would I be could I write,
yer honor, a vurd. It's his lies, and I'll
thank ye to give him the tanning he de
serves. I'll see he's here to get it."
Nigger Bill's time of retribution had
come. The principal opened Miss Car
roll's door and stalked in.
"digger Bill," he commanded, "come
here."
The boy trembled all over; his teeth
chattered.
"What did you He to me for?"
"The â theâ blankbookâ the 'bit, 1 "
stammered Bill, tht tears rolling down
his black cheeks. He was incapable
from fright of making any further ex
planation. The teacher struck him a
light blow. He shrieked and rolled
over and over the front of the room.
Mr. Rogers followed. He gave him an
other, and the boy rolled screaming
back again.
Then the principal collared the gro
tesque black object covered with chalk
dust and tears, and. Bitting him down
in a chair by his teacher's desk, ad
monished him against lying. That vraa
Nigger Bill's punishment. He sobbed
until school was out.
When the others were excused Miss
Carroll sat down by him; she put her
arm around his little threadbare shoul
ders.
"I know you are very sorry," she
said.
"Yes. ma'am; I won't do it again."
"I am so glad, for I am very sorry,
and so is Mr. Rogers and somebody
else, Jesus. He sees and knows every
thing we do."
Nigger Bill looked around fearfully.
"Did you know it, dear child?" she
went on.
"No ma'am, never heard tell of htm."
Then she told him the beautiful story
of the cross: of the tender, loving sa
vior; of the little dead girl and the child
in the midst.
The boy listened, spellbound. "I
like him, ma'am," he said.
"Yes," his teacher went on, "and
there we^e men who loved him so that
they went about telling other people,
and some of them had now names.
Now, I am "oing to give you a new
name. I shall call you Willie for you
to remember that you are Jesus' little
boy and he loves you."
The child went home hugging the
happy thought. He was no longer Nig
ger Bill: he was Willie, and Jesus loved
him. His was a merry Christmas.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1898.
EDITED BY DAVID H.WALKER
AN ALASKAN
SANTA CLAUS
BY REBECCA MOSS.
IT -was Christmas eve at Fort Clar
ence. The short Arctic day was
clone, if day it may be called when
there is nu sun, though the won
derful twilight glow lit up the sky
with almost day-like brightness.
The teacher of the mission school sat
at his desk in the little schoolhouse
alone, thinking of his loved ones far
away in their Eastern home, and he
could see them, in fancy, making prep
arations for the morrow's festival.
The teacher had wandered so far
away during his reverie that when a
slight noise attracted his attention he
scarcely knew for a moment where he
was. Then he recovered his sense of
position and saw standing irresolutely
in the half-open door a little Eskimo
girl, one of hlfl smaller scholars. She
looked like a picture, standing there
framed by the doorway, her tiny form
clad in snow-white fur from head to
foot.
"Well. Reina, what can I do for you?"
asked the teacher in kindly tones.
The child ram* 1 slowly toward him,
but there was a look in her bright eyes
which showed that she was laboring
under some excitement.
â¢Will Santa Claus bring us food to-
TALKS TO
California
night?'' she asked in a low, hurried
whisper.
For an instant the teacher could not
comprehend the question. Then he re
membered that for several days he had
been elling the children about Christ
mas, the origin of the day, how it was
observed by his people, and incident
ally he had spoken of Santa Glaus, how
he brought presents to the children.
"Yes, Reina," he said. "Santa Claus
will bring you something to-night if
you are a good girl.''
The child's faFe lit up with a happy
glow and she Bew from the room as
silently as a snowbird.
When she was gone the teacher again
fell into a. reverie , but this time he was
not in New England; he was in the
cold, cheerless Alaskan Territory. He
thought of the poor Eskimosâ how they
had worked in vain during the previous
summer to get their su â '1y of food for
the winter. Seals had been scarce,
thanks to the depredations of the
poachers who shot them far out at sea;
walrus had been hard to get, while the

catch of fish had been smaller than for
many years. So the winter came, all
too soon, to find the natives ill pre
pared to fight the long, weary time of
snow and Ice.
He hurriedly locked his desk, shut up
the schoolroom and went to his quar
ters, where he called his native ser
vant, Ta-ta-rok, and the two had a
long consultation, during the first part
of which Ta-ta-rok lifted up his hands
in expostulation, but presently he, too,
became interested, and finally the two
went into the storehouse together.
A clear Arctic night is far more beau
tiful than the night of warmer climes,
the northern heavens glowing for hours
after the sun has disappeared with a
roseate flush like the twilight of the
temperate zones. The stars look like
points of white-hot metal thrust
through an azure screen, and when the
mysterious aurora lights up the north
ern sky with its wonderful incandes
cence man can only gaze with awe at
this demonstration of natural force.
At midnight on this Christmas eve
the Indian village at Port Clarence lay
bathed in the white glow o-f the full
moon, the low mounds, looking more
like graves than abodes for living crea
tures, barely showing above the level
of the snow-covered earth, and but for
the glow of the ever-burning lamps one
might easily have fancied he beheld a
"city of the dead."
YES, my dear children, I have all your names
and there are lots of them. But, my! what a lot of
funny names there are on my directory of California.
They make me laugh every season, and I hardly get
through laughing one Christinas before I have to begin
again. Ydalpom, ha, ha! Jacobs Well, ho, ho! Red Dog,
tee hee! Coyote, bow wow! But lam bound" to find you
all, whether you live at San Francisco, Sacramento, Los
Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, Santa Barbara, Stockton,
Fresno, Santa Rosa, Oakland. Alameda. Berkeley, San
Rafael, Sausalito â oh. yes, I'll find you all.
Here are some of the places my reindeer are particu
larly fond of: Hadcsville, Grizzly Gulch. Coffee Bar,
Skull Flat. Last Chance, Hepsidam, Red Clover, Squaw
Valley, Wolf Creek, Paradise, Poverty Hill, Poker Flat.
Nojoqui. Buhach Switch, Buttonwillow, Goat Island,
Cicero, Butter Springs, Dog Valley, Anti Fat, Apricot,
Brandy Flat, Bonny Doon, Big Humbug, Bend, Badger,
Acorn Ravine, Apricot, Ahwahnee.
Above them all I just love You Bet. You Bet. I love
You Bet!
What do you suppose the reindeer did up at Point
Barrow last summer? Just lived on ice cream and grew
fat! That is why Prancer and Dancer are so frisky. Ha,
'ha, ha! Spect I'll have to hire a driver soon. It will have
to be a very small California boy or California girl, who
has traveled in and knows all about Senegambia, Luzon,
Abyssinia, Terra del Fuego, Mesopotamia and every other
place on earth that has a name hard to pronounce. What!
None of you little fellows have been in all those places?
Well then, Santa Claus will have to drive his own reindeer
I and leave you in your cozy homes with papa and mamma.
Ah, yes, the Pioneers must have been a jolly lot to
have found scores and scores of funny names for towns in
California that I can't begin to tell you about through the
telephone, because I am so busy. What I really am talking
through the telephone for is to ask how will you feel one
week from this morning? Drums, airguns, dolls, toys,
candy â yum, yum â stockings full of things â rooms full of
things â hearts full of happiness. Tell your papas and
mamas that I wish them and you all â you first, my dear
childrenâ A MERRY CHRISTMAS. Next Sunday
morning will be too late, for I will be far away. MERRY
CHRISTMAS! "Merry Kismus." You have been very
good children â especially since you have been told that I
like good children best! And give them the most presents!
And always have their names on my list! And never for
get a good child! I wrote to you all last week and you
have done very well. Whoa! Whoa, there. Excuse me, I
see that my reindeer are getting ready to run away. Good
by until next week. NEXT WEEK! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
HO, HO, HO. HO, HO, HO!
Suddenly there appeared upon the
scene, near the mission, a team of six
reindeer drawing a sled over the snow,
and seated on the sled, which was piled
high with bundles, sat old Santa Claus
himself, clad in fur robes from head
to foot, his eyes only visible between
the folds of his foxskin hood. A word
to his team and away they sped toward
the village. Arriving at the first house,
old Chris descended from his seat, took
several packages from his sled, and,
cautiously approaching the window,
he drew aside the skin curtain and
dropped the packages in. The noise
awakened the inmates and the sound
of voices came to him, but he mounted
his sled hastily and sped on to the next
house, where he again stopped and left
his presents. There were sixteen houses
in the village, and Santa Claus had al
most completed his round, when sud
denly from the north a wave of light
shot across the sky like some huge
rocket, and then began a scene such
as few white men have ever witnessed,
a fiery spectacle which held Santa
Claus spellbound!
Across the northern horizon floods of
wavy light surged and swept the sky
from west to east, while streams of
vapory glow shot out from the great
mass, far up toward the zenith. Up
and down in graceful curves and un
dulations the streams of brilliant light
intermingled like beauteous spirits in
a dance. The entranced observer felt
an awed ecstacy as he gazed silently
upon the lovely scene. It was as if
this were the primal Christmas morn.
As he returned toward the mission
he stopped again at one of the houses
and peeped in through the skin window.
Old and young were wide awake, their
happy voices joined in praise for the
kind old Christmas saint who had
brought them such acceptable presents,
for each child had a little paper sack
containing several cubes of sugar, some
dried fruit and a dozen raisins, while
the older folks had each a small tin
can of flour, some hard bread, a pint
of rice and a little tea. Strange Christ
mas gifts indeed, but appreciated far
more by these simple people than were
the costly gifts that mean so little in
the perfunctory exchange of civilized
life, and as the hooded gazer listened
to the happy voices of the poor Eski
mos he felt in his heart that here in
deed was "Peace on earth, good will
to men," and mounting his empty sled
he drove to the mission a happier
man, in that he had made others happy,
and when he went to his couch after
he had put his team away it was to
dream again of the snowclad hills of
New England.

THE LUCKY
BAG PARTY
BY MARY C. SPAULDING.
IT was such a dainty little pink in
vitation. It read as follows:
"Alice Gertrude Charming will
receive her friends from 4 to 7
o'clock Saturday, December 24."
All the children of Alice's age re
ceived an invitation, and were in aflut
ter of excitement. Alice Channing's
birthday parties were always very en
joyable, and it was whispered that this
was to be more delightful than usual.
"We are to play a fine new game,"
Alice confided to her dearest playmate,
Mary Griswold, who lived just across
the street. "I must not tell you the
name of the game, for mamma said we
must keep it a secret
When the eventful hour for the party
arrived, children from all parts of the
town went tripping toward Alice's
house. All the boys and girls carried
bags which contained their party slip-
After the little guests had played
several merry games Alice's mother
said: "Now, children, let us see how
many of you can touch the lucky bag?"
"The lucky bag!" exclaimed the
children. "Why, what is that?"
A mysterious red bag hung all the
afternoon in the hall doorway. It was
very large and bulky. The children had
wondered what it could be, but when
Alice led them straight to It, they knew
this large red object must be the lucky
bag.
"This bag is filled with some pretty
little gifts," said Alice's mamma. "But
you must each earn your prize. Mary,
I will blindfold you and turn you round
three times. Then you must try to
touch the lucky bag. Every child who
succeeds in touching the bag has a
right to take something from it."
What a merry time they had! Mary
was so bewildered when her eyes were
bandaged that she walked directly
away from the lucky bag to the piano.
HERE are di.ections for the solution of the cross puzzle published last week, which was originated by Mr. Thomson
of this city. Size of paper one inch longer than wide. Fold the bottom over to a pjint one inch from jthe ;op
and then crease at the fold. Erlng the sides together from right to left and make a fold lengthwise through the
middle Take the lower right hand corner and double it over to form Fig. A, the space at the top 'no! included in
this fold being just one inch deep. Now double the paper twice, evenly to make it conform to Fig. B. Take your
scissor* and cut through the middle, lengthwise, and you will hrve all the geometrical figures, in one cut, necessary
to maske the cross, foundation stones, clubs and dice.
As each child is allowed to make three
attempts, Mary touched the mantel the
next time; and the third time she
-walked straight to the lucky bag.
Grace Farnsworth was more success
ful, and touched the bag the first time
It was really very exciting! The chil
dren laughed and clapped their hands
â with joy. After each child had suc
ceeded in touching the lucky bag, it
was opened, and they were given a
chance at its contents. Frank Briggs,
the big boy of the party, drew out a
small doll dressed in long clothes and
a muslin cap. A bright tin whistle was
the prize of Jessie Cameron, a quiet
girl who never made a noise. Sam
Bruce drew a handsome little needle
case and thimble. It was very funny
Some of the children exchanged their
prizes for others more to their liking.
When the lucky ones had all selected
a prize from the bag the game was be
gun again and continued until the bag
was empty. Just then supper was an
nounced. Mrs. Charming gave each
child a little gilded wishbone tied with
different-colored ribbons. The boy and
girl with ribbons of the same hue were
partners at supper and filed into the
dining-room together. What a lot of
sandwiches and cakes and candies and
ices they enjoyed!
"It was all lovely," said the children
as they bade Alice and her mother
good night, "but the best of all was the
lucky bag."
THE CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS.
WHEN the wind roars down the
chimney
And howls around the eaves.
When the storm is at its highest
And no chanre for echo leavos,
Then we gather "round the fire
place,
In the gloom the shadows weave,
And forget the cold around us,
Telling stories Chistmas Eve.
For we are four, well filled stockings,
Flump and ready for the dawn,
The youngsters will run and seize us
The first thing on Christmas morn.
And we have a wondrous cargo â
Nuts and raisins, horses, men.
And we hold them all so nicely,
And a house, and cart and hen.
That doll there is for Miss Polly,
Hasn't she the softest nan ?
Ami the gown is of real satin â
Quite a grand. Parisian air.
She was 'fraid she'd cmsh her dresses.
So we let her stay outside,
And she sits there on the mantel.
Looking like a Marquis' bride.
Now we'll tell what is within us,
As our custom's always been,
And as I'm the oldest stocking,
Without argue I'll begin:
I belong to Master Alfred,
And I hold a top and ball,
And a gun and several marbles,
And a knife, and soldier tall.
Then the cracks are filled with candy,
Oranges and apples, too,
And from out the very toe,
Nuts and raisins peeping through.
Now speak up, young Freddie's stocking,
A DANCE IN
A TOY SHOP
BY MINNIE BRADLEY,
San Franc'sco.
IT was the week before Christmas,
and the dolls in the toy shop played
together all night. The biggest one
was from Paris. One night she
said: "We ought to have a party
before Santa Claus carries us away to
the little girls. I can dunce, and I will
show you how."
"I can dance myself, if you will pull
a string," said a "Jim Crow" doll.
"What shall we have for supper?"
piped a little boy in a sailor suit. He
was always thinking about eating.
"I can get the supper," added a big
rag doll. The other dolls had never
liked her. But they thanked her now.
She gave French names to everything
she made and made it taste better. Old
Mother Hubbard was there, and she
said the rag doll did not know how to
'cook anything. They danced in one
of the great shop windows. They
opened a toy piano and a singing doll
played and sang "All Coons Look Alike
to Me."
This the black doll did not seem to
like. Then they wound up a music box
and danced by that. They had supper
on one of the counters. The rag doll
placed some boxes for tables and the
supper was of candy, for there was
nothing else in the shop. Patsy Mc-
Quirk said he could not eat candy. He
wanted to know what kind of a supper
it was without potatoes.
He got very angry, put his hands into
his pockets and smoked his pipe. The
smoke made the ladies sick and they
all tried to climb in a horn of plenty
to get out of the way. The next morn
ing a little girl found the toy piano
open. She was sure the dolls had been
playing on it. The grown-up people
thought it had been left open the night
before. But they do not understand
dolla as well as little people do.
HOW AMELIA
WON THE DAY
BY MARY KERNS.
NO, we cannot have a Christmas
dinner or Christmas tree, or any
other thing like people have on
Christmas. We are too wretched
poor. Just bread and potatoes,
and some old smoked meat that we
have every day. Christmas or any other
time there is no change with us. I do
wish I had not been born in such a
place," grumbled out Lottie Vane.
"We should be thankful for that, my
dear," said Mrs. Vane, a middle-aged
Tell us what you're hiding there;
It must be a zoo or circus,
For I think I ccc a bear.
No, my friend, you're quite mistakenâ
Perhaps because of failing sightâ
For you don't know hair from feathers
When it is a little light.
'Tis a hen that bravely cackles
When you squeeze her very hard.
Here you see are the directions
Printed on a yellow card.
Then I've here a cart and horses
And a house they call an ark.
And a cap, and flag, and pencil
To draw pictures in the park.
Then, of course, there's nuts and candies,
And an orange, and a ball,
With an apple and some popcorn â
Let me see, I guess that's all.
I belong to Mistress Polly,
And I hold a kitchen tin;
Every pan and every kettle
Is as neat as any pin.
There are oranges and candy,
And a ring of solid gold.
And a book of fairy stories â
Nicest stories e'er were told.
Now there comes the baby's stocking.
Scarce as long as your own hand,
Heaven bless the little fellow!
Must have come from fairy land.
And he has a rubber dolly.
That he surely cannot break.
And a book of toughest texture.
Strongest ever they could make.
But he'll have no nuts or candy
Till we come again next year;
Then we'll see that he has plenty-
Heaven bless the little dear!
woman, with a worried look showing
on her kind face. "Many children would
be glad to have this and be very thank
ful."
"I declare, we must be the worst-off
family in the neighborhood," said Fred
in a jest at Lottie's wrinkled brow.
"Oh, I know we have nothing, and
never will," answered the grumbling
Lottie, as she walked away from the
table.
Amelia, the oldest of the two girls,
said nothing, but her brain was busy
working out some plan, as she looked
at her mother's careworn face.
After the meal was through with Mrs.
Vane put on her cloak and bonnet, and
started down the village to do the
week's mending for an old woman, who
could not very well see.
"Oh, Lottie, come here, and Fred, you
too," said Amelia, as soon as her moth
er had got out of earshot. "I have a
fine plan, and am sure I can carry it
through, if you will help me."
"Well, let us hear it," said Fred. "I
will do anything I can to help you."
"It is useless if money has anything
to do with it," said Lottie, puckering
ur her lip.
"Wait till I tell you, and then you
shall see. We all know how anxious
mother is t<-> have a nice Christmas for
us, but we all know, too, how impossi
ble it is for her to buy without money,
or the means of obtaining any. So I
propose to surprise her, and give her
a model Christmas without her know-
Ing a word about it."
"You need not talk so foolishly, Ame
lia. Just a moment ago you said, 'Of
course, we could not get things without
money.' "
"Stay!" cried Amelia, with a merry
twinkle in her eye. "We can all work
for a while, until we make enough
money without mother knowing it."
Then" she unfolded to them her plan,
how they could run errands, cut wood,
do mending and many other little
things while their mother was away.
"Excellent! excellent!" said Fred,
after she had finished. "I shall start
out for a Job this very minute."
"Well, go on," said Lottie; "if you see
any use, I don't."
So for two weeks Fred and Amelia
went every day doing various little
things for people, and always returning
home before their mother arrived there.
And the day before Christmas Amelia
stayed home, and what fun they had
making pies and custards, and fixing
all kinds of fruit.
Christmas morning Mrs. Vane had to
go for a few hours to help prepare the
dinner for some rich lady. Just before
the time for her return Amelia and
Lottie set the table with the snowy
cloth, put on the dishes, laden with so
many good things, and Fred brought
in another huge log for the fireplace to
make it look more cheerful. Then they
sat down and waited for her to come.
Soon they heard the familiar foot
steps and saw Mrs. Vane open the door
and walk in. You may think how she
looked, without the description, when
she had been expecting the same small
meal, and then to see the heavy-laden
table. She stood still for some time,
then kissed the three.
After dinner the children had another
surprise for their mother, a handsome
present and, what do you think? Some
one had heard what they had done and
the next day sent gifts to them all.
Lottie has not grumbled once since
that Christmas day.

How He Discharged the
Cook.
THE fact of the matter is," he said,
"that yuu > women do not under
stand the management of em-
ployes. You do not know how to
handle those who are in a somewhat
lower social jjosition and to whom you
pay salaries. You have no idea of
discipline, which is a fundamental fea
ture of life and in which the social
scale cuts no figure whatever."
He had not been married long, and
this was his first experience with
trouble in the kitchen, and he naturally
thought he knew more about it than his
wife.
"I have been handling men in one
way or another for some time," he went
on, "and consequently it is to be ex
pected thai 1 should know a little more
about methods of enforcing respect
and cbedience than you, who are hav
ing your first experience in running a
snaall domestic establishment. You
must be careful not to let them run
over you. Now, where is this girl? I'd
lik-,' to talk to her."
"I'll send her up to you," said his
wife.
"Very well," he replied, with calm su
periority, as he settled himself in his
easy chair. "I will be easy with her be
cause I realize that she has not been
handled properly heretofore. But be
fore 1 get through there will be an un
derstanding."
The girl came to him from the
kitchen upon being summoned by hi.s
wile. He undertook to see that the
tone in which he spoke to her was calm,
but linn. She didn't have much to say,
anyway, and didn't care anything
about th%.tone.
"I want to impress upon you," he
said, "that so long as you remain in
our employ there are certain rules that
must be obeyed, and that what my wife
says to you "
The girl was moving toward the door.
"Hold on!" he exclaimed. "Where
are you going?"
"T' get me tings," she answered. "I
quits here and no-w."
"But â but â you can't quit now!" he
protested.
"Who says I can't?" she demanded.
"But we have a few friends coming to
dinner to-night," he persisted.
"Let 'era come," she answered.
By this time he was out of his chair
and following her out into the hall. He
tried to tell her that she couldn't quit
without notice, but she demonstrated
that she could. Then he capitulated.
"My dear," he said to his wife later,
"these girls cannot be treated as rea
soning beings. They don't know any
thing but cooking and arithmetic, and
nothing in the latter outside of addi
tion. I have added 50 cents a week to
your cook's wages."
And that was all she could ever get
out of him about that interview.

FRIENDS OF THE FOREST.
Last Monday night the membership of
Lincoln Lodge and a number of their
friends celebrated the second anniversary
of the institution of the lodge by a grand
banquet at the Bay State on Stockton
street. The menu was a toothsome one,
and after the dessert R. W. McMcGarvie
took charge as toastmaster. Then followed
a number of regular and voluntary toasts,
the responses to which gave proof of the
earnestness of the membership of the
lodge to advance the interests of the or
der at large. After that there was an
entertaining hour of songs, recitations and
the telling of storiettes. The affair,
got up under the direction of the offi

quent speech of the toastmaster on
"Woman."

The Well Known Firm of J. C. Wil-
son & Co. at 900 Battery Street.
The firm of J. C. Wilson & Co., coal
dealers at 000 Battery street, is one of
the oldest and most reliable enterprises
of its kind in Ran Francisco. The "co

very popular as a steam producer.
The firm supplies coal in large quan
tities to various departments of the
United States Federal service, and to
many State institutions. In its yards
are kept all well-known brands of
foundry coke and pig iron, as well as
the finer grades of coke used for metal
lurgical purposes.
The business of J. C. Wilson & Co. is
very extensive, and heavy shipments
to interior points are made each year.
The firm supplies all the larger and
more prominent gas companies, foun
dries, etc., in the State. The local trade
of the firm is very large, it numbering
among its customers many of the best
known families in San Francisco.

Battery streets. An immense stock
capable of meeting every requirement
is kept constantly on hand. About 75,
000 tons of coal are annually handled

hall of Abraham Lincoln Council was a
great success and the programme present
ed was one that was highly enjoyed ov
those who were present. A feature ot
the programme was "Ma Honolulu
Lady."
Lincoln Council is gaining in member
ship, and what it is doing in that line is
creating jealousy In other councils.
The several local councils will soon be
requested to name whist teams to com
pete against that of Lincoln Council in a
series of matches.
At the last held meeting of Lincoln
Council it was stated that the proposed
legislation to restrict undesirable immi

THE PALACE HOTEL.
A Magnificent Fireproof Structure
Famous the World Over.
To the tourist from every quarter of
the globe who visits San Francisco
there is one hotel with the name of
which he is familiar and that is the
Palace Hotel. Having in the past
sheltered the crowned heads of many
countries, heirs-apparent to many
powerful European and Asiatic thrones,
representatives of the proudest aristoc
racy of Europe, Presidents of the
United States, public officials of promi
nence and individuals famous in litera
ture, art and science, the Palace stands
to-day among the famous caravan
saries of the world, and an institution
of which every San Franciscan may
well feel proud.
In the magnitude of its equipment
and the completeness of its magnificent
service the Palace stands without a
peer. Its superb court, its commodious
apartments and its unrivaled cuisine
have been repeatedly described, and
each guest on returning to his home
beyond the seas tells the story over
again. Since the consolidation of the
Palace and Grand Hotels the business
of the Palace has increased wonder
fully and at the present writing it
shows no sign of diminishment.
One of the principal features which
appeals to the traveling public more
than any other is the absolute safety
against fire enjoyed by the guests of
the Palace. In the extensive improve
ments made in the past five years,
which virtually amounted to a recon
struction of the interior of the hotel,
every precaution was taken to render
the building absolutely fireproof. With
this great consideration constantly in
view every safeguard against fire was
employed, so that to-day the Palace is
the only absolutely fireproof hotel in
San Francisco.
The features which commend the
Palace to the public are its superbly
equipped grill room, its banquet rooms,
in which many of the notables of the
world have been dined, its splendid
cuisine and matchless service. Its
suites are richly furnished, airy and
commodious and all of them are pro
vided with baths, a feature which
no other hotel in San Francisco
possesses. The parlors of the Palace
are extremely rich in finish and ap
pointments and are not excelled in
beauty and general artistic effect by
similar apartments In the palaces of
Kensington or Berlin. No expense has
been spared in securing the comfort of
guests, and the result is apparent in
the magnificent business which the
Palace and Grand Hotels to-day enjoy.
it was full of defects, many of the leaves
being in fae-simile, and the celebrated por
trait of Shakespeare being only a reprint.
A complete and perfect copy such as is
possessed by the Baroness Burdett-
Coutts, would realize quite Â£1000 in the
open market.

The Kirls are placed in the State home because they are un

A VISTA OF PALMS.
A FAMOUS CONCERN.
Weil-Known Coppersmith and Plumb-
ing House of C. W. Smith.
Conspicuous among the old estab
lished businesses on the water front is
the coppersmith and plumbing house
of C. W. Smith, located at 16 and 18
Washington street. The house was es
tablished by Mr. Smith in lt>sl. and by
untiring effort he succeeded in building
j up a magnificent trade which, at the
time of his death three years ago, was
not equaled by any similar concern on
;!,- Pacific Coast.
The management of the vast busi
ness, which is still conducted under the
name of its founder, is now in the ca
pable hands of his widow, Mrs. Smith.
Associated with her as manager is H.
Blythe. of the well-known lumber firm
of Blythe & Trott. The general superln
;.t is Joseph F"X. one of the best
known practical coppersmiths in the
city.
Ever since the business was founded j
spe< ial attention was paid to steamboat j
and ship work, in which line the house
practically enjoys a monopoly. The
work performed on the ships embraces
pvery branch known to the trade. In
the local trade the manufacture of still
worms, brew-kettles and heaters is a
specialty with this house.
The workshop is admirably equipped
with all the latest and best machinery j
lary to the operations of a first ;
duns establishment of the kind. In the i
pasi two ytars many improvementshave j
been inaugurated which serve to make
the output of the firm especially ser
viceable and complete. Only the best

"A Noted Medium With Divine Gift
of Healing."
The intelligent public who are inter
ested in spiritualism are anxiously look
ing forward to Mrs. J. J. Whitney's free
test meeting at Metropolitan Temple
en Sunday, January 1. Mrs. Whitney
by her marvelous work in this line has
done more to convince skeptics than
any one in the United States. She is
doubly qualified to do this work. For
Kb.- nut only has the divine gift, but
possesses second sight, inherited from
a Quakeress mother and a Scotch Pres
byterian father-
Mrs. Whitney's elegant apartments
at 232 Stockton street are constantly
crowded with people anxious to obtain
her advice. Mrs. Whitney's spirit
guide always proves infallible in diag
nosing diseases. "She can see straight
through us," said one Âf Mrs. Whitney's
patients, This is literally what she
does. So the source of the trouble de
termined, of course the cure follows.
She always has a staff of physicians
and nurses in attendance. Her electric
batteries and appliances have all the
modern improvements. Her success in
the treatment of diseases is really phe
nomenal. Where other physicians fail
utterly she effects a permanent cure.
Her correspondence is unlimited and
her advice by letter is eagerly sought.
Systems that have been racked by
medicine and refuse to take chemicals
yield to her process. The pores absorb
the medicines and herbs, many of which
she has imported from India and other
foreign lands.
Mrs. Whitney is indorsed by the
Board of the California State Society
of Spiritualists and by the Spiritual So
ciety of the United States aild Canada.
She was unanimously chosen as the
represi ntative delegate from California
to the national convention of spiritual
ists at Washington, D. C. This was an
honor which she deserved in the light
of her remarkable successes and none
disputed it.
Mrs. Whitney is a constant champion
Owl.** This name was probably given
to the canyon by the native Califor

of these birds that "were formerly to

as the name of his ranch. The canvon^
is appropriately named, because it re- .

A beautiful living stream of cold,"*

which h.Tve entwined themselves
among the branches with that artistic'
of the good that can be accomplished
in her profession. But she never fails
to denounce the frauds and impostors
who are constantly destroying people's
faith in the genuine.
Mrs. Whitney ascribes her success to
one fact: "I am a born mediumâ not
made," she says. *
GRAND HOTEL BAR.
One of the Model Resorts of the Pa-
cific Coast.
San Francisco is remarkably well
equipped in respect to resorts where
business men, mining men. society gen
tlemen, club members and bon-vivants
daily gather to discuss the affairs of
the day over the brimming glass, but
none enjoys the widespread and envi
able fame that attaches to the Grand
Hotel bar, which is operated by E. J.
Foster and "Ned" Fay under the firm
name of Foster & Fay.
These gentlemen, who are masters in
their art, are deservedly popular among
their patrons, who represent the best
known men in local business and min
ing circles. With the latter class the
Grand Hotel bar has become a favorite
rendezvous. The equipment of the bar
is perfect in every respect, and all its
appointments are elaborate and com
plete. - . ,
Mr Foster was for years connected
with" the Cliff House and "Ned" Fay
was for thirteen years manager of the
Palace Hotel bar. They have labored
hard to please their patrons and suc
cess has rewarded their efforts.

and in thut time has earned an envia
ble reputation in his line.
Mr. McMahoQ has done a vast
amount <rt work for the Harbor Com

world wide, is the Occidental, located
on Montgomery street, between Bush
and Sutter. It is especially popular
among tourists from South and Central
America and '.he Orient. Major Hooper,
the genial proprietor is in every way
qualified to sustain the fine reputation

BITUMINOUS PAVING.
Its Superiority Demonstrated by the
City Street Improvement Co.
The leading bituminous rock paving
concern on the Pacific Coast is the
City Street Improvement Company,
the offices of which are located in the
Mills building. The company was in
corporated in :: r ay, IS9I, and since that
time its operations have extended all
over the State.
The officers of the company are: J.
W. McDonald, president; W. E. Den
nison, secretary, â¢ and Colonel G. H.
Mendell, consulting engineer. The di
rectors are: .*. Dutard, C. B. Stone,
T. B. Bishop, J. W. McDonald and W.
E. Dennison.
The company makes a specialty of
the performance of all kinds of street
work, bridges and railway construc
tion, wharves, jetties and seawalls. It
owns extensive bituminous rock mines
at San Luis Obispo, Kings City, Mon
terey County, and Santa Cruz. The
.product of these mines is excellent and
is held in the highest favor wherever
"used.
â  The confidence of the public in the
.City Street Improvement Company is
attested by the immense amount of
"work now being done in all parts of
â the State. It is the only company in
.the State which uses a five-ton roller
and guarantees its work for five years.
"Quite recently the company paved
â Market street with bitumen, and the
-excellence of the work has been the
subject of high comment by experts.
The superior quality of this work has
â demonstrated the utility of bitumen for
â  paving purposes, and the result is
.that the output of the company's
mines has been largely increased.
The company has branch offices at
Oakland, Stockton, Sacramento and
Marysville, in all of which cities it has
performed extensive street work. Its
operations in this city have been of
that satisfactory character that in
sures a largely increased patronage
during the coming year.
MURPHY, GRANT & CO.
The Oldest and Best Known Dry
Goods Firm on the Coast.
Among the business concerns whose
history is contemporaneous with the
growth of San Francisco from village
to metropolis is the dry goods house of
Murphy, Grant & Co. at the corner of
Bush and Sansome streets. Its exten
! sive trade entitles it to the distinction
of ranking among the largest dry goods
concerns of the United States.
The firm was established in 1851 by
Eugene Kelly, J. A. Donohoe, Daniel
T. Murphy and Adam Grant. In 1867
enlarged quarters were necessary, and j
in that year the firm removed to its !
present location, where during the cur- ' :
I rent year an additional story to the ''
j building and two electric elevators were !
added. Its trade extends over the en
tire coast. Central America, the islands
of the Pacific, Australia, China and
Japan. Its volume of business is the
largest of any dry goods house west of
Chicago. Among the business houses
of San Francisco it stands in the front
rank.
Cafe Royal Billiard Hall.
The favorite billiard hall in San
Francisco, and in fact the only one
worthy the name, is the Cafe Royal,
in the Flood building at the corner of
Fourth and Market streets. This popu
lar resort is managed by Messrs.
Hornlein & Krumb with consummate
ability, and they have succeeded in
making it d model establishment of
its kind.
The Cafe Royal has many features
which recommend it to the popular
taste. The bar, one of the handsomest
on the Pacific Coast, is equipped in
excellent style, an# a specialty is
made of the best brews, which are kept
on tap. Light lunches are served at
all hours, day or night. Another fea
ture of the resort is the small com
partments where gentlemen may en
joy refreshments in private. Beautiful
paintings adorn the walls, and, combin
ed with the superior furnishings,
they serve to render the place highly
attractive. To tho manipulators of
the ivories and those who enjoy the
best liquid refreshments to be found in
the city, the Cafe Royal possesses su
perior attractions.
An Extensive Bookbindery.
The well-known bookbindery of J. B.
Mclntyre, located at 422 Commercial
street, is confessedly the largest insti
tution in that branch of business on
the Pacific Coast. Established about
twenty-five years ago, its business has
steadily increased from year to year, so
that to-day it stands without "a rival
in the city.
Mr. Mclntyre is an expert in his line,
and he makes a point of looking after
all of the multitudinous details of his
business. It is this close attention to
affairs which has raised Mr. Mclntyre's
business to the eminence it has reached.
A specialty is made of fine ruling and
bindipg of ledgers, journals and day
books. The facilities for the perform
ance of this work are unequaled. A
large force of employes is constantly
employed.
ORIGIN OF THE MAGIC WORD
"COCKTAIL"
"Few people," says a writer in Pear
son's London Weekly, "are aware of
the origin of the magic American word
'cocktail,' the mere utterance of which
is sufficient to bring a look of happi
ness to the features of ny wella-condi
tioned American citizen. The word
comes from Mexico, where pulque, a
kind of liquor obtained from the cactus,
is the national tipple. The Aztec word
for pulque is pronounced 'octel,' and
the Amt?riean army which under Gen
eral Scott invaded Mexico some fifty
years ago corrupted the word into
'cocktail,' and carried it back to the
United States.
"There is a tradition that pulque was
discovered by one of Montezuma's
nobles, who sent it to the Emperor by
the hand of his daughter Octel. The
monarch tasted the liquor, looked at
the maiden, smiled, and thereupon
gulped it down. It not only tickled his
palate, but touched his heart, and X is
reported that he married the girl.
From that day to this the Mexicans
have kept themselves well supplied
with pulque, and when drinking togeth
er invariably look and smile at one an
other before swallowing."
Yankees, the writer tells his English
readers, have adopted a similar custom
when imbibing their whisky, and fre
quently, when desirous of inviting a
friend to take a drink, ask him to take
a "smile."
More than 15,000,000 visits are paid an
nually to London pawnbrokers, or, to
be more exact. 41.100 a day on an aver
age. The number of pledges deposited
throughout the country is said to
amount to 190,000,000 every year.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dec 17.â The market to-day
Opened firm with a rise of a point In Union
Pacific. Later the Irregularity in London,
which ha/1 been Ignored in the initial trading,
was an influence locally. There was a sharp i
break In the Vanderbiltsâ Lake Shore 8, New
York Central and Canada Southern over a
point. Local traction shares were off sharply,
especially Metropolitan and Manhattan. Mis
souri Pacific also weakened decidedly. There
was considerable strength In other spots.
Southern Pacific, Central Pacific, . Denver pre
ferred and Pittsburg, C, C, C. and St. Louis
shares showing firmness. In the second hour
the downward movement was rather uniform.
In the final dealings, however, an improved
tone set In, in which Baltimore and Ohio and
Lake Erie and Western stock recorded sub
stantial advances. The average declines were
less than 1 per cent. The bank statement,
which was more favorable than expected, was
later than usual in making its appearance,
but its Influence helped the closing rally.
This was the largest week on record for
transactions in stocks and bonds,' the sales of
stocks being above four and a quarter mil
lion shares and those of bonus nearly forty
million dollars. The variety of stocks and
bonds dealt In were also greater than ever
before. The market bulged early in the week,
making high record prices, later the movement
was more hesitating and irregular, some stocks |
advancing while others declined. Aside from I
the temporary requirements for January divi
dends, money promises to continue at reason
able rates because of the large trade balance j
In favor of the United States, due to an ex
cess â â¢: exports in five months of $343,001
The financial horizon seemed clear, but tie
money and loan market continued to be
watched narrowly; as long as there was no
cause for alarm securities were bought con
fidently. Gross traffic statements were very
gratifying, the feature being the marked in
crease in West-bound tonnage, which Included
a greater percentage of manufactured ariiclrs.
Favorable railway returns from some S2ction3
which have reported a falling off for a long
time aroused considerable cheerfulness and
round amounts of stock were taken in antici
pation of favorable net results. London opera- I
tions were watched with considerable interest
during the week, owing to the varied tendency
of the money market, which showed an ap
preciable hardening toward the close. The dis
position abroad excepting Berlin, however, was
more favorable to American railroads, and the ]
net result of the arbitrage purchases was In !
favor of bulls. The local commission house
business was heavy. Interest largely centered
In railways. The bulls from time to time took
up one stock after another and raised each in i
turn. In most cases to record figures.
The story about the acquisition of the Chi- ;
cago and Alter) by various railroads in each
Instance gave strength to the property sup
posed to have acquired the Alton. Although It
was understood that the property was on pale
on favorable terms, no deal took place as fir
us Ik known, but it Is always the last story j
that finds believers. Among the shares which
have an international market but do not
usually figure to any extent In the local deal
ings were Denver preferred. Norfolk and West
ern preferred an.l Central Pacific. These stocks
were lifted out of the rut and brought promi
nently forward, competing at times with the ;
recognized shares in point of activity. Sugar :
dropped eight points, owing to various interpre- I
tations of the trade situation.
Features of pronounced interest developed in
the bond barket daily and purchases of semi
speculative Issues were in an enormous volume.
Foreigners purchased freely. United Stater, 4s
(coupon) advanced 'â .â¢. the old -is (coupon) and
the new 3s %: the old Is (registered) and Ss

ASSOCIATED BANK'S' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. Dec. 17. -The Financier says:
The New York Clearing-house banks game.i
â  â  .:. gold liust week, and as offsetting
- of legals were bul (497,600 the net ex
pansion of $2,761,100 in <-as!i provided a reserve
heavy enough for the increase of SI'i.LN.IOU in
deposits, brought about tor the most part by
the loan expansion oi $6,246,500, and left the
banks with $L'3t.',ii7s more cash than they re
ported at the close o; tiie previous week. The
statement does not differ materially from that
exhibit it Is favorable from a banking stand
point, :l.s w:<~ ; :::;â¢â  out in this analysis last
week, in its deduction that the hanks are find
ing employment for all the excess cash float
ing this way. To what extent the expanding
loans reflect domestic needs Is another matter.
It is highly probable, however, that the cur
rent increase came largely from borrowings in
: to the heavy business being .lone on
the New York Exchange. At the same time
holdings of sterling investments are becoming
larger from .l;iy to day and estimates Of fifty
million are conservative. The latest trade re-
I iris may be interpreted to mean that the ex
pansion which has been a feature Ol the Btate
ments of the New York banks tor sosne weeks
past is not at an en i. Loans are now 573,G0u.
.iger than on October 1 and deposits in
eleven weeks have risen almost $105,000,000. It
Is needless to say that both items are far
ahead of anything ever known in the history
of the banks. Hut with this unprecedented
growth the Clearing-house Institutions to-day
hold about two millions more excess reserve
than reported in October. The gain in cash
for the week is larger than had been pre
dicted. The Interior movement will become
larger as the tirst of the year approaches. If
this proves true we shall probably witness a
continuance of the operations which have
swelled the bank totals of late, otherwise the
demand for funds may curtail to some extent
the available reserve and coincidental^ rtffwt
exchange to the point of gold imports. Some
bank presidents are looking for firmer money
rates after January, hut that they can be
maintained is rather doubtful.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market here to-day was idle but
firm. Americans were most active. New York
prices were a disappointment, hut the market
opened oÂ»er parity and improved gradually,
Closing firm, though somewhat irregular. Union
Pacific was the chief feature on more favorable
views as to the acquisition of the Oregon Short
Line. There was buying also on the reported
acquisition of the Alton line. Discounts were
easier

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Dec. "Wheat at the opening
evidently felt the heavy realizing that took
place late In yesterday' 8 session. Buyers were
In thÂ» market only after small amounts. Liv
erpool showed closing declines of | S\'sd. May
started %c lower.
Before any support of consequence was given
May declined from 67% cat the opening
to 67% @67% c- Then buyers became plen
tiful. Further confirmation of damage to the
Argentine crop by "rains proved â  the Incentive
for covering that carried the price up to 67% c
In a very few minutes. Liquidation, in j^hich
heavy longs were prominent, - started, however,
before the price had reached 67V4 and 67% c was
received for only a few lots. Before 11 o'clock
the price had again been forced down to 67c,
and shortly afterward C6?Â«c was touched, the
low point of the day. Beerhohm's estimated
the world's shipments at 8,000,000 bushels.
Commission houses wen- quite heavy sellers
during the decline. Outsiders were apparently
afraid of a serious slump, and put their hold
ings back on the market while there was yet
time. May fluctuated narrowly around 66% c
until near the close, and closed fairly steady at
66% c.
There was a narrow market In corn. Prices
averaged a little lower, principally in sym
pathy with wheat. May closed %c lower.
Oats were dull and easy within a narrow
range, the market In the main following corn.
May lost %c.
Provisions were slow but fairly steady. The
weakness in grain caused realizing by longs
and selling by packers, but all offerings were
taken and :>rlees did not yield much. The
close was steady, with the declines all re
covered. May pork dosed f>c higher and lard
and ribs unchanged.

Jacob Wollner's circular says: "There have
been quite a number of sales in our market this
week, principally Humboldt and Mendocino
falls from 'J<- to lie. foothills from 9c to lie,
and some Red Bluff spring from lie to 13c. In
fact. In the last two weeks over 1.000,000 pounds
of Wool have changed hands. They were all
shipping Wools In the grease. There is still
no demand for scoured Wool, and. most of the
stock in this market is scouring Wool. We will
have to wait until there is some demand for It.
"From the East come reports of sales In the
three principal markets the past week amount
ing to 5,000,000 pounds at lower prices than
ruled two weeks ago. Holders of Wool begin
to realize that they made a mistake In holding
Wools for extreme prices, and now conclude to
accept ruling quotations.
"The London auction sales which closed last
Tuesday did not show any better prices than
at the closing sales in October last, with
coarse wools and crossbreds at from 5 to 74
per cent lower. Of course, under existing cir
cumstances, we cannot import any foreign
Wools, as domestic Wools are from 15 to 20 per
cent lower than foreign Wools would cost. This
state of affairs Is owing to the very large stock
of Wools in the United States which has to be
worked up before we can expect al lthe benefit
that the Wool tariff should give us."

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
CONDITION ARISING FROM A SOUND
MONET DOCTRINE AND A CONSERV
ATIVE MANAGEMENT,
NEW SYSTEM OF CLEARING HOUSE DRAFTS FACILITATES
BUSINESS AND THE EXCHANGE OF
CREDITS.
THE year closes with a remarkable condition of soundness and sol
vency In our banks, financial institutions and local monetary activity.
The great test put upon Hum in the beginning and course of the
panic of IS:<3 tried and proved them thoroughly. The soundness
which carried them over that is the foundation upon which they are
now petting the benefit of revived business and restored prosperity.
It is only the truth to say that the banks i l' this State have held their
position through (very pinch and have furnished no record of general col
lapse, largely because of the stubborn adherence of California to a sound
financial standard. When all business is transacted on such a standard
there is . lency, more attention to legitimate profits and
Treater satisfaction with them, and therefore a better condition of those
ecurities, real, collateral and personal, which banks must consider in the
laily transaction of busli
The dry year operated against general trade, but not to its destruc
;ion. Tlie drought was not general enough to seriously affect our finances.
In the country from th< astward to the Sacramento Valley and
north of the bay the crops were unscathed and there was abundant pro
duction In many of the foothill counties east of that valley. More ranch
mortgages were canceled than in any single year for a considerable pe
riod. Thfs payment of long standing loans tin real estate sent a Hood of
money Into the banks, so that deposits increased during the year eight
millions of dollars.
That labor felt the benefit of this return of money from realty invest
ment into the quicker uses and returns of trade was shown by the in
crease in savlnes bank deposits In those institutions in this city.
The enterprise of California financiers is projected in many directions
and has originated a proposition to facilitate exchange which attracts dÂ»
served attention. Th.- money orders Issued by express companies and the
poctoffice hav< worked against regular banking exchange. This is be
cause banks have been abl< to thaw and check only where they have a reg
ular correspondent. To overcome this our bankers have proposed applica
tion to the clearing-house system, by which a bank selling exchange on a
town where it has no correspondent remits th<> amount thereof to the ex
change clearing-house of associated banks in San Francisco. When the
bank cashes the draft it is admitted to its Ban Francisco correspondent,
goes to the clearing-house and is paid out of the money remitted. This
system, projected by our bankers, will greatly facilitate business and the
exchange of credits throughout the State, and is as effective as if every bank
had a correspondent in every town In the state. it brings them all into
relations of great convenience to them and the business public.
Our bankers have also combined to procure in all the States one law of
negotiable instruments.. The so, Mai philosophers have sought to secure a
common law of marriage and divorce in all the States. While there may
he necessity in our moral conditions for such a law. there is no question of
the need of uniformity in the law of negotiable paper. Now there is con
fusion and complexity where there should be uniformity and simplicity as
to the form and interpretation, negotiation and liability of such paper
The stability, celerity, convenience and profits of trade depend upon ade
quate and safe banking facilities.
Hanking has, perhaps, a lessening relation to politics and an enlarging
relation to the great business lnt< rests and industrial activities which con
cern the whole people, BO it is natural that the bankers of this State should
study, as they do, the means for peaceful adaptation of banking to political
conditions, rather than the wrenching of political conditions to the necessi
ties of banking.
This conservatism ceases, however, when political conditions require a
destructive distortion of business, and then the bankers are as patriotic and
instant in their public duty as any class in the community.
California may well point with uride to the soundness of her financial
institutions and the high character of the men who administer their affairs
THE NEVADA
NATIONAL BANK
REMARKABLE INCREASE IN ITS
PTTSINEOS THIS YEAR.
A Solid Financial Institution Which
Ranks Among the Foremost
in the World.
A relation of the history of banking
on the Pacific Coast would be Incom
plete without conspicuous mention of '
the old Nevada Bank, now known as
the Nevada National Bank of San
Francisco.
The Nevada Bank was founded in
October, 1^74, by a quartet of bonanza
kings, whose names will ever shine in
the history of mining in California and
Nevada. These men were Jam*
Flood, John W. Mackay, James G. Fair
and W. S. O'Brien. Enterprising to a
marked degree, these financiers began
their banking operations with the
princely capital of $10,000,000. Immense
sums were kept constantly in hand in
readiness for investment in any enter
prise which ordinary business prudenc
might recommend as safe and profit
able, and no project that had for it
object the development of the mmm
industry of the State was disregarded
For many years the management of th
bank was in the hands of Ml
Flood, but illness, which ultimately re
suited in his death, forced him to retir
from the managerial field. Unfavorabl
legislation in 1579 and the adoption
later of a new constitution, which
placed certain restrictions upon com
mercial banks, caused the hank to re
duce its capital to The Ne
vada Bank remained practically the
property of Its founders until 1890, when
It was reorganized by Isaias \V. Hell
man> who had associated with him a
large number of San Francisco's most
successful merchants and ca alists,
The conservative policy of Mr. Hell
man which prompted him to engage in
business affairs which yield the
returns and to eschew those which have
more than ordinary risks soon succeed
ed in placing the bank on a better basis.
President Hellman's management of
the bank was conspicuously successful
from the start. His sound policy won
the confidence of the business men of
San Francisco immediately. At the time
he assumed control of its affairs h<- \ .is
connected with many enterprises in th
southern part of the State. His name

evidenced by the remarkable increase
LARGEST CHEESE EVER MADE.
THIS trade trophy is the Canadian Mammoth Cheese, which was exhibited in
the Chicago exhibition, and was bought by Jubal Webb of Kensington.
The cheese weigh* 22,000 pounds, or cloee upon ten tons. It was moved
in a specially constructed steel case, slung upon iron girders, so that the
enormous weight might rest directly over the iron wheels of the specially
MMMtlUCted teak trolley. This trolley, by the way, was drawn, by eight power
ful horses belonging to the Midland Railroad. A spcial permit hud to be pro
cured from Scotland Yard to bring this extraordinary load through the London
>treetÂ«. The authorities also mapped out a spedaj route with the view of ob
viating any possibility of the trolley and its burden going through into the sewers!
In one way this mammoth cheese may bÂ« said to owe its inception to the Can
adian Government, working in conjunction with the Dominion farmers.
The milk was brought to the Dominion experimental farm in Ontario, and there
worked OO Into cheÂ«SÂ«. by specially made machinery, which afterward exercised
upon it a pressure of 200 tons. S<> good mi tho cheese, that when, at the close
fof the exhibition, a "shaft" was sunk into the giant by means of a "trier,"' the

The mammoth cheese contained 207.200 pounds of milk, equal to one day's pro

Personally, Mr. Hellman is a gentle
man who possesses many admirable
qualities. He is accessible at all times
and bis "pinions are frequently sought
on business matters, his judgment be

financial subjects he is a recognized
authority, and the local press is Indebt

THE BANK OF
CALIFORNIA
ONE OF THE LEADING FACTORS
IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF SAN FRANCISCO.
Romantic History of the Institution
Since Its Birth in 1864 to
the Present Time.
The second decade of the history of
Sun Francisco marks the foundation of
The Bank of California, one of the
soundest financial institutions to-day
not only of the Pacific Coast, but of
the entire Union. When the story of
the commercial development of San
Francisco comes to be written in detail
it will be found that The Bank of Cali
fornia was one of the most important
factors that contributed to the city's
progress from a mere hamlet to the
proud distinction of metropolis of the
Pacific Coast.
The early history of banking in San
Francisco is a record of conservatism,
enterprise and energy, as well as fluc
tuation, disaster and prosperity. The
numerous banks which existed in this
city prior to April. 1564. when The Bank
of California was incorporated, were
founded upon ephemeral principles, for
the reason that they depended upon the
business attending the operation of
the mines, which was liable to die away
at any moment. When, however, agri
culture in California became a n
nized industry and the magnificent re-
Bources of the State were being de
veloped, it infused new life into bank
ing, and added the element of security
to the operations of financial institu
tions. Many new banks sprang into ex
istence, and competition naturally be
came so keen that the weaker "were
crowded to the wall and numerous
failures were recorded. Aprlnilture
had become a strong rival of mining
and while the first was building ur the
financial resources of the common-
W< rilth, the other began to make ex
tensive drafts upon the coin reserves in
the banks. With the expansion of the
field for the profitable investment of
capital the rate of interest declined,
and this competition growing keener
year by year tested to the utmost the
strength of the institutions that sur
vived.
The incorporation of The Rank of Cal
ifornia at a period when other institu
tions of recognised strength were
forced to retire from the field proved
that its founders were no ordinary men
These were D. O. Mills am! William C.
Ralston, the first being president and
the Becond cashier of the new institu
tion. The secretary of the bank was
Stephen Franklin, a business man of
no mean ability. The capital stock at
the beginning of the bank's career was
fix.-d at $3,000,000. Borne of the best
known business men of the city at that
time were associated with the bank's
affairs, and at the first meeting or
stockholders the following were elected
as a board of directors: William C.
Ralston, Louis McLane, 'William Nor
ris. J. Whitney Jr., Thomas Bell, Her
man Michels, John O. Earl and O. F.
Giffln.
Two years after the incorporation, in
1866, the capital stock was increased to
$5,000,000, but owing to unfavorable
legislative enactments it was found
necessary in 1881 to reduce the stock
to its original figure of $3,000,000. at
which it has remained to the present
day.
The affairs of the bank prospered un
ceasingly until June, 1873, when Presi
dent Mills resigned. He was succeeded
in that office by Mr. Ralston in July of
the same year. The administration of
the affairs of the bank by Mr. Ralston
forms an interesting chapter in the
history of the bank, including as it
does the elements of romance and
tragedy, which culminated simultane
ously In the suspension of the bank on
Aueiist 26, 1876. and the melancholy
suicide of President Ralston in conse
quence of the disaster which over
whelmed him.
The rich discoveries on the Oomstoek
had an electrical effect uw>n the San
Francisco banks, and The Bank of (Vili
fornia, conducted as it was by a man
of extraordinary liberality and enter
prise, was to suffer with many others
from the effects of over-confidence in
the permanence o f a fickle industry.
Flushed with the prospects of a golden
harvest, the bank officials did not scru
ple to loan as high as $000 on shares of
Comstoek stork during a period of un
exampled inflation and excitement.
The reaction which inevitably succeeds
inflation in any branch of human en
deavor overtook The Bank of California
at a time when it was least able to
stand the strain. The result was a sus
penslon which, because of its remark -
able features, was one of the most sen
aational <>f the period. In desnair of
seeing his cherished institution reha
bilitated, and confronted by Irretriev
able ruin, Mr. Ralston threw himself
into the bay and met a suicide's death.
Within forty days after the sus
pension of the bank its doors were
opmed to the public and every obliga
tion met dollar for dollar. A new issue
r.f stock was subscribed by the best
men In the city, and under the adminis
tration of President Mills it entered
upon a new career of prosperity. He
resigned the office of president in April,
IS7B, and was succeeded by William Al
vord, who has since that time ably con
ducted the affairs of the bank.
President Alvord became a director
of the bank in January, 1888, but re
signed In September of the same year.
Subsequently, in November. 1871, he
wi's re-elected as director and served in
that capacity continuously since. He is
a financier of repute, whose sound judg
ment and conservative poJicy have as
serted themselves on more than one
occasion. During the panic of 1893,
when runs were made upon other in
stitutions, the affairs of The Bank of
California progressed as usual, scarce
ly without incident. Indeed, it seemed
as If nothing was occurring to startle
th" financial world. T'nder President
Alvord's guidance the bank rode the
storm In safety, and holding the con
fidence of the whole community It is
stronger to-day than In any period of
Its eventful history.
Associated in the management of the
bank is Thomas Brown, one of the most
astute financial men- of the country.
His connection with the bank dates
from October, IS7O, when he was elect
ed assistant cashier. In July, 1873, he
was elected cashier, a position he has
held with signal success ever since. Mr.
Brown is a recognized authority on
matters of finance, and his Judgment
may be relied upon in every emer
gency. He is an affable gentleman and
moves in the highest circles.
The assets of the bank aggregate
over $17,000,000, of which $3,000,000 is
cash on hand. Its investments are
principally in bonds and stocks, and its
surplus exceeds 53.000,000. There is due
depositors an aggregate of about
$10,000,000.
Among the commercial banks of San
Francisco none stands higher in
the public estimation than the
Hank of California. It is this that has
secured for the bank a volume of busi
ness almost princely In its proportions.
The business transacted embraces
every branch of legitimate banking, in
cluding: tho issuance of foreign and do
mestic exchange and the careful, sys
tematic making of collections. Letters
of credit available in all parts of the
world are issued.
The officers of the bank are: William
Alvord, president; Charles R. Bishop,
vice president: Thomas Brown, cashier:
S. Prentiss Smith, assistant cashier;
I. F. Moulton, second assistant cashier;
Allen M. Clay, secretary.
The directors include the following
well-known capitalists and busines*
men: James M. Allen. William Bab

A STRONG CONCERN.
The Continental Building and Loan
Association of California.
To the wage-earner of small means
the question of how to secure a home
for himself and family ever presents
itself. He who is compelled to pay
rent equal to one-quarter of his income
rinds that a life of constant drudgery
confronts him. How then shall this be
avoid* d?
The question is easily answered â
build your home on the installment
plan. Instead of paying rent every
month, which is a total loss of so much
capital, devote the money to payments
on your own property. Within ten
years the home is paid for and the
question of rent no longer disturbs the
si lenity of the owner.
Of all the plans which appeal to the
consideration of property owners the
best is that of the building and loan as
sociation. There are many of these in
stitutions in California, but there is
none which stands higher in public es
timation or whose operations are larger
than those of the Continental Building
and 1/ian Association of California, lo
cated at 222 Sansome street, San Fran
cisco. This powerful concern was or
ganized in ISB9, and has built more
homes in this State than any other in
stitution in the same line.
The solidity of the association is evi
denced by its large capital, amounting
to $7,250,000, of which $1,2r.0.000 has
been actually paid in. Its profits and
reserve fund amount to $140,000, while
its monthly income is $75,000.
It should not be imagined that the
business of this association is confined
exclusively t<> making- loans on real
estate in San Francisco. On the con
trary money is loaned to parties all
over the State, and some 1327 mort
gages are held on property in sixty-five
cities and towns in California. Branches
have been established to the number of
L'ir> in the leading cities and towns of
the State. Its extensive business has
been a blessing to wage-earners, for it
enabled thousands to secure homes of
their own. In 1597 one-tenth of all the
homes erected in California were built
by its aid, and this jear one-eighth of
the homes were erected with capital
furnished by the association.
It is very essential that the wage
earner of small means who desires to
secure a home for his family should
Identify himself with the safest and
most prosperous building association
in the business. The figures given above
show that the Continental Building
and Loan Association possesses these
two qualities to a marked degree and
its prosperity is a guarantee of the
prosperity of every member. The bur
densome interest and premiums exacted
by smaller associations are not exacted
by the Continental Building and Loan
Association, but, on the contrary, the
most favorable terms are given to bor
rowers.
The officers of the association are
gentlemen of high standing and repu
tation in the business world. Its di
rectors are realty experts, as "well as
conservative business men, qualities
which insure a management of affairs
in the interests of the loaher as well
;is the borrower. Every member of the
association shares in the profits, a
favor which a borrower from any other
source fails to enjoy.
The president of the association is
Dr. Ed E. Hill, and the vice president.
Captain Oliver Eldridge. The general
manager and secretary is William Cor
bin.
JOHN G. EDWARDS
Will Represent San Francisco in the
State Board of Equalization.
J. G. Edwards, member-elect of the
State Board of Equalization to repre
sent the First or San Francisco Dis
trict in the board, is a widely known
journalist of this city, he having been
for years editor and proprietor of the
Coast Review. He is in touch Avith
all matters pertaining to business on
this coast, and his election as a State
Equalizer cannot fail to be of benefit
to the -ople of this district.
Mr. Edwards is a Grand Army vet
eran of prominence and he was Instru
mental in securing money to establish
the Veterans' Home at Yountville. He
has taken an active part in politics for
years past, but until recently never as
pired to office. He is the successor of
A. Chesebrough on the State Board of
Equalization, and that he will prove
worthy of the trust reposed in him it is
safe to promise.
The cost of a heating plant for the Vati
can, capable of warming its thousands of
rooms, has been tigurert on by competitive
bidders, the lowest figure being $180,000.
Tlii' Pope declines to incur the expense,
though great difficulty is experienced in
keeping nis apartments warm enough for
comfort in his old age.

reverie, bawled: "Let 'er 'lone, cayn't ye! How come ye everlastin'ly pesterin'
that child? Set damvn:"
Ambrose, directing a glance of entreaty at Miss Carroll, did sit down, but
only to regret his obedience, because, as Miss Carroll moved the camera a
little to rest it more firmly, one leg of the tripod was caused to make a motion
resembling a stci> fbrward.
Pearl thought tftt monster who took "mean" children was advancing to
seize her. " ith a stream of fright she leaped away. There was no railing,
and the little body toppled backward into the swift current.
Ambrose kicked off his shoes and sprang afte* her. One had not even time
ti scream before he was cleaving the waters; and they could hear his high,
eweet, childish voice: "Hole up, honey. Bud's a-comin'! Bud'll tote ye ashore."
Medlark would hay.? flung himseJf into the water "tad not the ferryman
grabbed his shoulder, crying: "Ye c. yn't swim a stroke and the boy kin.
Learnt him myseff. By thunder, look a'him!"
Medlark lifted his blanched face for a single dreadful glimpse â enough to
see a yellow head whirled cai the waves, ami juct behind a twisted hand lifted
to clutch. He covered his eyeballs as If they were blasted. Suppose those
crooked fingers could not hold! AVlio had brutally broken them?
"O, Lord! I be'.n a bad, cruel father: â but 'taint her fault! " he cried in
his distress. "Don't let my baby drown!"
"Ambrose has caught her." Miss Carroll's voice reached him now. "He
is a splendid swimmer! He is trying to make for the shore."
"Cayn't we paddle out t' him?" called V. ;d!ark. He grabbed an oar and
began to pull feverlshl.v.
"Naw, sir, ye cayn't,*' said the ferryman, "the current's a blamed sight tew
strong. The boy'U be duowndid or on shore afiore we kin git f him. But pull
away, 'twill cii^- you" mind, sorter. Hark to the boy. will ye? Ef he 'ain't
tellin" the baby f play boss in the water an' hole on t' his wether. He's the
echemiest buy I ever did .;â¢â â ."
"She's doing it. too," cried Miss Carroll, almost with a sob of exultation.
"He has swum with her in the water before. See! See!"
The buy was swimming straight with the current. He had wisely chosen i
to swim across where the lajid jutted o-ut, â grith the current rather than at right 'â 
angles to the nearer shore.
Even in his mortal feaJ Medlark, who was as daring a man as lived, and
who had owed his own life more than once to his cool head, felt a thrill of pride >
at his boy's courage.
i Bwear I'll never lift a hajid agin him, if he gits off," vowed the father
"O, Lord, I'll do better by 'em all!"
"It's a right srnari of a ways." said the ferryman, "an' he looks sorter punv
like. He's worked tew hard; but mobbe he kin make out."
"Waal, " he continued, "ajl we kin do fer him is f put our trus' in the Lord'
Naw. we don' needier, nuther, lease ho done got his footin". Will ye look a'
him a wavin' his ban' at us? Say, Medlark, I'll take that ar boy off you' hands '
ony day ye say, an' engage t* treat him better'n ye done, tew."
Medlark said not a word fo these taunts. Perhaps he couldn't, for the tears !
were rolling down his cheeks. When tht:y finally reached the children Pearl :
was no worse for her bath, but Ambrose looked ready to cry. His first words â 
Avert-: "O, Miss Carroll, I done lost, 'em!"
"Lost, what, Bud?" cried the ferryman. "Ain't ye both safe an" soun"> Do I

Santa Claus wonders what toys he should give to the boys and girls of our new possessions !
Santa Claus is in a quandary,
For he don't know what to make '
For the children of the islands ;
That our boys from Spain did take.
He has scratched his head and wondered
Ever since that Spanish fuhtâ
Thinking what he woulJ leave these tots
On his trip of Christmas night.
Velocipedes they could not ride, â¢
For .ley have no shoes to wear;
The prickly pedals hurt their feet,
So they haven't any there.
It is too hot for clothing, too,
So of course he can't send that.
The only covering that they wear
Is a big Manila hat.
Of course, they've never seen our toys,
And would be afraid of them ;
But there's a thing that they can play â
A tune an a bamboo stem.
'Tis a tune that is familiar
To every true Yankee boyâ
A tune that fills our hearts with glee
And makes us bubble with joy.
Now 1 think thatyou should guess it,
For it's Yankee Doodle Doo;
On their bamboo stems they play it,
Though their notes are not all true.

HALES.
So let Santa give them music
Of Yankee Doodle Dandy
And give them swords and guns to bear
And feed them U. S. candy.
They want our country's- protection
.To help them against the powers ;
They need some nation to cheer them,
To guard them in troubled hours.
So we would suggest to Santa
A sword, a fi e or a gun;
Be given to all the natives
Who are over twenty-one.
Uncle Sam can get the soldiers
Wo will show them how to aim, â 
And with gun- and proper training
They'd build up a nation's fame.
We only make the suggestion,
Santa knows better than we;
But ive them something practical â
Something to make tnem all free.
If you ask these dark-sk inned natives
For their greatest wish of all,
They will asK to be a nation,
Though it be so very small.
So let's send a note to Santa
And ask him to bring them things
To help them build up a country
Where the bell of freedom rings.

CONFERENCE OF
CATHOLIC PRELATES
AT WASHINGTON
Attention of the President Called
to Cruel Treatment of Priests
in the Philippines.
Archbishop Ireland Says the Pope Will Soon Appoint
an Apostolic Delegate to Look After Matters
in the Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call*
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â The Washington correspondent
of the Herald sends the following: A secret conference
of Catholic prelates was held last week in Washington to
discuss various matters pertaining to the welfare of the church.
It was no formal gathering, as it was not deemed prudent to at
tract the attention of the press to the conference.
High ecclesiastics dropped into the city one by one and
called at the house of Mgr. Martinelli. the apostolic delegate.
At no time were more than three prelates present. Almost all
of the visitors called on President McKinley. Their object was
to urge the chief executive to use his influence to have Spanish
prisoners now in the hands of Philippine rebels, particularly
priests and monks, released.
They told the President that the prisoners were being
treated with the utmost cruelty by the Filipinos. Archbishop
Ireland of St. Paul was among the first to call on President Mc-
Kinley. He told the President he was going to Rome in a few
weeks and wanted to be able to assure the Holy Father the
United States would take care of Catholic interests in her
newly acquired colonies. He said he did not want any unusual
favors shown priests in the colonies, but thought it was only fair
they should be allowed to retain their possessions by paying a
fair tax. They did not, he said, ask to be exempt from taxation
entirely.
Archbishop Ireland further said that the Pope would
shortly appoint as apostolic delegate to the Philippines a pre
late who would be thoroughly with American institutions and
who was f \ sympathy with American progress and ideas.
From the Archbishop's remarks it was understood that he
himself would not accept the position, which it was rumored by
cable some time ago was offered to him by Rome. This was re
garded as r.n attempt by Archbishop Ireland's enemies to get
him out of the way. His friends say he will frustrate the plots of
his opponents by a coup. He has in mind, they say, the sugges
tion to the Holy Father that he appoint as a delegate to the
Philippines Archbishop Keane. who is his close friend. Mgr.
Keane is now in Rome, and, according to cable reports, had a
long interview with the Pope immediately on his arrival from
America, in which he gave the Holy Father a detailed account
of how matters stood in the United States.

STATEMENTS IN REICHSTAG
ATTITUDE OF THE EMPIRE DUB
ING THE LATE WAR.
Experts Sent to the United States to
Investigate Reduction of Im
ports Have Made Their
Reports.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Dec. 17.â The sessions of
the ichstag during the present week,
though not so sensational as expected,
were very interesting from several
points of view. The debates were no
table for giving rise to the first official
utterances on the Lippe-Detmold af
fair, Emperor William's oriental trip,
the Anglo-German understanding and
the pending German-Am : in tariff
negotiations. Some of the statements
were significant. Thus Baron yon
Thielman, the Minister of Finance,
though the subject did not come in his
province, speaking of the Spanish-
American war, said:
"While it is true during the war the
sympathies of our nation â I admitted
it quite freely â were on the side of the
weaker and wrongfully attacked party
(loud Leftist cries of "No"), yet the at
titude of the empire throughout was
perfectly correct and statements to the
contrary in the foreign press were ma
licious inventions."
Herr Richter, leader of the opposi
tion, while confirming the correctness
of Germany's attitude during the war,
remarked: "I do not see why the sym
pathies of the German people could
have been as overwhelmingly as they
were on the side of the Spanish."
Count Posadowski - Wehner. Secre
tary of the Interior and representative
of the Chancellor, referring to the re
duction in imports from America, said:
"Experts have been sent to the United
States to investigate the matter, and
it depends upon their reports whether
we can facilitate such imports."
This statement refers to the dispatch
of three German experts to the lead
ing American exporting centers, espe
cially N*e\v York and Chicago, last
spring and summer. Their mission
was secret and their reports, now in
thÂ«- hands of the German Government,
are understood to be generally favora
ble to American interests.
Another remarkable featur , f the de
bates was the reference to the Drei
bund and the Anglo-German under
standing. Neither Baron yon Bulow,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, nor any
other Minister, nor the Emperor him
self, in confidential talk with the pre
siding officers of the Reichstag, has
been exp;i in respect to either.
The I.erlin Tageblatt commenting on
the speech of Baron yon Bulow says:
"The speech was more remarkable for
its omissions than for its contents."
The impression left in the Reichstag
was that a deep and lasting finsure had
been driven into the Dreibund and it is
significant that Herr Basserman, the
spokesman of the National Liberals,
and hitherto the stoutest friend of the
Dreibund, said: "The provocative tone
of Count Thun Hohenstein toward Ger
many is unjustifiable. It is apparent
that the German empire must be strong
enough to stand on its own bottom."
A nui -jer of other speakers expressed
themselves similarly and outside in the
lobbies the opinion was rp-->atedly ex
pressed that the days of the Dreibund
were numbered. On the other hand the
press has much to say on the revival
of good feeling toward Great Britain
and the United States. Nearly all the
comment is distinctly friendly.
The Socialistic 'astion has introduced
in the Reichstag a number of motions
in favor of tne abolition of the lese
majeste paragraph in the cri 'nal code,
the abolition of the dictator paragraph
re ectlng Alsace-Lorraine, the legal
establishment of an eight-hour work
day an- " the widening of the present
rights of political association. These
matters come before the house after
Christmas adjournment. Several of
them have not the ghost of a chance of

adoption, but they will lead to lively de
bates.
A gambling scandal affecting a num
ber of ari *ocrats has been brought
to light and has created a sensation in
social circles. A "smart" club called
the "Joviale Club," frequented by offi
cers of the guards, cavalry, high Gov
ernment officials, bankers and members
of the Reichstag, has existed in Berlin
for some years. A stranger was re
centl- introduced by two highly re
spected members and soon became a
favorite. All went swimmingly until
rumors about his antecedents began to
circulate, and it was noticed that luck
invariably favored him. The Berlin
Tageblatt says the stranger grot many
! young men of the best families in his
power. The whole affair will shortly
be sifted in the law courts. Several
club men lost immense sums, and the
affair is likely to have serious results
for the military officers, in view of Em
peror William's determination to sud
press gambling in the army.
The Italian papers say they learn
that Emperor "William will pass a ten
days' visit to Rome In January and
give a magnificent fancy dress ball at
the German Embassy. The costumes,
it appears, will all be of the time of
the Roman empire, His Majesty ap
pearing in a Roman tunic with a great
purple cloak.
Particulars of the acquisition of the
legendary abode of the Virgin Mary at
Jerusalem by the German Catholics,
which the Emperor announced during
the Palestine trip, have thrown fr^sh
light on the recent scandal in connec
tion with the sale of the American
cemetery at Jerusalem. Coffins ' w^-re
said to have been exhumed and the
bodies dismembered and packed in
small boxes and reinterred elsewhere.
The names of the purchasers of the
cemetery and the purposes of the tran
saction have been concealed. It now
transpires that the cemetery formed
part of the site of the abode of the
Virgin Mary, and was bought by the
German Catholics in confidential antici
pation of an arrangement by which the
Sultan, to oblige Emperor William,
would place them in possession of the
rest of the property which was in the
hands of Mussulmans, who were forced
to sell under the order of the Sultan.
The Catholic press notes, in mock sur
prise, that while the Catholic clersrv
and press formally nad generally
thanked the Emperor for what he had
done for them in Palestine, the Protest
ant press and episcopacy have re
mained silent.
It is a curious fact that though
Count Posadowski-Wehner in the
Reichstag claimed Emperor William
had attained highly important results
through his Oriental tour, "about
which the Secretary of State will tell
you in detail," the latter official, al
though present when the announce
ment was made, did nothing of the
kind in his subsequent speech.
The committee of experts appointed
to inquire into the unsanitary condi
tion of the new palace at Potsdam,
hitherto a regular roya! residence dur
ing the greater part of the year, re
ports that the water from the Havel
is increasingly permeating the land
round the palace, and that unless the
river is regulated and extensive im
provements are made in its banks, the
whole palace, which cost 20,000.000
marks, and on which the present Em
peror has spent 6.000,00n marks, will be
come permanently uninhabitable. The
Prussian Diet will be asked to vote the
necessary sum.
The Empress of Germany for some
time has heen using; as regular treat
ment for obesity, tablets containing the
active principal tyrhofd glands* of
sheep, which is a specific for this
trouble. While she has succeeded in re
ducing her weight, she has been suffer
ing seriously in general health, is be
coming nervous and is threatened with
heart trouble. The Emperor, there
fore, has induced her to stop using the
remedy.
A mass-meeting at Kiel, attended by
3000 persons, has adopted a strong pro
test against the expulsions from
Schleswig-Holstein.
The German Cabinet is working in
conjunction with the Russian authori
ties in order to facilitate the importa
tion of Russian petroleum.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW Y ORK, Dec. I}.â Major General
Wesley Merritt, former commander of
the United States .lilitary forces in the
Philippine Islands, from whica post he
was sent to "-"aris to consult with
the American Peace Commissioners,
reached this city last night on board
the steamer L cania from Queenstown.
With Generj.l Merritt were his bride
and her mother, Mrs. Norman Wil
lu , Norman Williams Jr. of Chicago
and Captain L. H. Strother, aid de
camp on the staff of General Merritt.
The general will assume command of
the Military Department of the East,
which position he held when he was
ordered to Manila.
The General received a hearty greet
ing from those assembled at theCunard
line pier as the Lucania was made fast
this morning. From the steamship pier
the party went in carriages to the
Waldorf.
"It is some time since I left the Phil
ippine Islands," said General Merritt,
"and all I can say abou'. the situa
ation th^re when I departed is con
tained in official reports wliich I made
to the Government and the Peace Com
mission. All of these reporu have been
published in the newspapers, and there
is no use of my going over those sub
jects again. I can say, however, that
there is no foundation for the report
that Admiral Dewey's health, has
broken down as a result of his wonder
ful work i. Manila harbor on May 1
last. He was in fine phys. a.l condition
when I left him, and he was then over
th-i strain o~ the naval tight.
â¢â¢There is another thing I would like
the people to 1 now. It is that the cli
mate or' the Philippines is not by any
means as bad as it is said to be. I met
a number of Europeans there, who had
been in the country for fourteen years
or more, and they seemed to thrive and
had no serious complaints about the
climate to make. The â tnrtality among
our troops sent to the Philippines was
not as great as some wouia have the
people believe.
'Tl.e Germans acted a little aueer
when I got there first. They were
rather meddlesome in matters which. I
think, they should have let alone. The
German officers there made me no offi
cial calls until Manila had fallen, and
then their visits were not what mitcht
be termed friendly. Thert- was no seri
ous clash, and 1 am glad of it. The
volunteers behaved nobly during the
fight we had. They are good soldiers.
"As to General Miles' bill to increase
the United States army to 100.000. at
present I cannot discuss the propped
measure, for the reason that I have not
seen a copy of it. I think it will take
about 30,000 soldiers to hold the islands
In case the country desires to keen
them, and I see no reason why it should
not.
"I have no comment to make on the
so-called expansion which is being dis
cussed pro and con these days.
"There are many Spaniards in the
islands who want to remain there.
With 15,000 United States soldiers and
the remaining 15,000 evenly divided be
tween the Filipinos and Spaniards the
islands could be governed properly and
with credit to this country.
"I did not meet Aguinaldo. but I am
satisfied he is a very shrewd man. I
did not recognize the insurgents, fear
ing complications. Admiral Dewey. af
ter my arrival, pursued the same
course. What was said or done before
my arrival I cannot state. I did not
recognize Aguinaldo nor his troops, nor
use them in any way. I had been there
ten days before Aguinaldo asked to
see me. and then I was too busy. Talk
ing with leading Filipinos. I told them
I had no promises to make, but th^y
might be fissured that the Government
and the people of this country would
treat them fairly.

Twenty Claims Have Been Staked Out and There

BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Dec. 10.â Possibly
another rich placer camp has been
struck, and if this turns out to be true,
this time Sitka is "in it."
Special Treasury Agents Link and
Smith have been in Alaska some weeks,
sent for the purpose of investigating
the long time rotten condition of the
Alaska customs service as applied to
the importation and sale of whisky,
beer and such things. They could work
back not only through Collector Ivy's
administration, but back through the
last decade, and find something to do
along this line. In junketing around
between Wrangel, Juneau, Skaguay
and Sitka. Smith and Link have found
a good thing in the way of entertain
ment. Collector Ivy has been inde
fatigably at their heels. But the best
thing they have run up against ap
pears to have bc?n near Sitka. Link
and a man named Carlson were out
hunting the juicy grouse one day, and,
finding themselves at White Stone
narrows, made an excursion along the
shores of Quashkansky Bay. Baranoff
Island. Grouse are tame enough in
Alaska to kill with a club, but Link
did not know this and took a gun. He
went armed to meet almost any old
thing, for in his belt stuck a big horn
spoon such as the Indians make. They
went up a creek and Carlson remarked
that the gravel and sand looked as
though there might be gold there. So
he began to pan with the big horn
spoon. It would hold about a gill of
sand. Going down to the creek he wash
ed out the sand carefully and was as
tonished to see remaining in the bottom
of the spoon at the lower end of a lit
tle puddle of wet sand which persisted
in remaining there many colors and a
deep ring of fine, flour gold. Link nearly
fell into an epileptic fit. They tried it
several times in different spots along
the creek bank, and it was always the
same â fine, flour gold and plenty of it
proportionate with the quantity of sand
the spoon held.
Grouse were forgotten. Taking their
jackknives they cut sticks and marked
the ground. They had no ax with
which to make stakes. This is in
American territory, only a few miles
from the staff on which the stars and
stripes went up and from which the
Russian flag came down in 1567. Placer
mining claims under United States laws
are 1500 feet or about twenty acres. Of
course Colonel Smith got in on it.
United States Commissioner Tuttle also
has a claim, and Collector Ivey. too,
having been as close up to the push for
weeks as he could get, was next, and he
has a claim.
Then there was a small-sized stam
pede from Sitka to Quashkansky Bay.
In all up to date about twenty twenty
acre claims have been located, but
nothing further has been done. The
Increasing snowfall will prevent any
but the most limited development work
before spring. The ground 1 gave a fine
prospect, running from 10 to 20 cents
when worked with a pan. it is said.
That is excellent eround.

covery. No gold has been produced
from the Sitka diggings, but J. A.
Becker, an expert mining engineer, who
recently removed from Sitka to Ju
neau, has private information on the
find. He told me that he considered
the prospect an encouraging one from,
the showing so far made. There will
not be another ship from or other com

SHIPPERS OF WINE
WERE IMPOSED UPON
California Association Made to Suffer
for the Act of an In
dividual.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 17.â The com
j munication ot Cosmo Morgan. Los An
i geles agent of the California Wine As
| soclation, printed in The Call of to
â  day, was directed to H. J. Woollacott.
jln that communication Mr. Morgan
i exonerated Mr. Woollacott from all
I fault in the matter of being a party
! to the alleged adulteration of a carload
1 of California wine shipped to Mexico.
! The communication was supplied to a
i repiesentative of The Call, who formed
I the idea that Mr. Morgan desired to
; direct the statement to the editor of
â  The Call personally. The statement as
! printed was correct, but it was not
j directed by Mr. Morgan to the editor
i of The Call. It was given to Mr. Wool-
I lacott.
Mr. Morgan is very indignant that
the association should be placed in a
bad light by the fact that some wlnÂ«
maker had used an adulteration. He
says that it is impossible for the as
sociation to analyze every droD of wine
it ships. As long as the growers use
adulteration, the association is liable
to be innocently imposed on.
MORE WARSHIPS TO
BE SENT TO CUBA
Several Light-Draught Gunboats to
Help to Preserve Order Along
the Coast.
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Arrange
ments are being made by Acting Sec
retary Allen for the dispatch of more
naval vessels of light draft to Cuban
waters to aid the army in coast cities
in establishing and preserving peace
and order. It was intended several
months ago to assign four of the sin
gle tnrreted monitors to Cuba as port
ships, and they were fitted up for this
purpose, but it was found they would
be too hot for service in the south, and
it is now proposed to assign small gun
boats to the island. In addition three
small converted yachts are beins: pre
pared for surveying duty and they will
be available for providing protection
and of quieting disorders. The de
partment has finally abandoned its
purpose form a Gulf squadron, and
Cuba and Porto Rico will be continued
in the North Atlantic station under
command of Rear Admiral Sampson. It
is expected the battleship Texas will
arrive at Havana very soon, and the
Brooklyn will reach her destination to
morrow or Monday.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 17.â The Chicago
Daily News says: The statement may
startle the general public, but in the
financial world the report will cause no
astonishment, although the action will
be unprecedented in the monetary his
tory of the country. For nearly two
months money has been "the cheapest
thing in America." as financiers phrase
it. For a fortnight call loans have
been made in Wall street as low as one
half per cent, while short time borrow
ers with approved collateral ;m? accom
modated at 3% per cent in Chicago.
The bond markets are absolutely bare
of first-class securities yielding more
than 3% per cent. To-day 5 per cent
coupon issues were bought on the ex
changes at 137, and high grade stocks
paying dividends at the rate of 5 per
cent per annum were quuted at 132.
Chicago and Northwestern common
was an instance. Firms that make a
specialty of investment securities ac
knowledge that the demand for values
has exceeded the supply three fold.
Fairly safe issues have been absorbed
and there is no diminution in the funds
seeking placement.
The national treasury states that for
the current month money in circulation
has increased $20,303,722. This, follow
ing a gain of $50,000,000 for October,
makps a total expansion of about $75,
000,000 for the last sixty days. Com
pared with a year ago, the total circu
lation of all kinds of money is $165,
795,000 greater, and amounts in all to
JI,BBt>,SOO,OOO. The perspective reveals
even more money.
On the first of the year corporations
will distribute about $100,000,000 in in
terest and dividends. Besides, exports
are increasing rapidly, while imports
are decreasing quite as rapidly. The
latest figures tell that the exports of
merchandise from this country exceed
those of Great Britain for the first time
in the history of the two countries. The
United States is in the unique position
of desiring to buy the American stocks
and bonds that are held abroad.
It is this condition that has war
ranted a foreign Government in making
tnntative overtures for a big loan here.
The borrower is supposed to be Rus
sia. The representatives of that coun
try were negotiating with French
bankers some time ago for a large
sum. but the transaction was not con
cluded.
Ex-Comptroller of the Currency Eck
els has heard of the overtures made by
a foreign power to raise money on this
side.
"The monetary condition of the
country is to-day quite unlike anything
we have heretofore witnessed," he said.
"Despite the unusual activity in all
character of stocks and bonds and in
general business lines, deposits grow in
the banks largely beyond the expansion
of loans. There certainly is no present
and but little future prospect of a
change. There can hardly be one with
the amount of money flowing Into the
country from abroad, and the increas
ing demand there for our products.
Whatever discussion appeared some
w<>eks sinc^ as to the raising of rates of
the Bank of England and the Imperial
Bank of England, has now passed
away.
"It seems that so far as German con
ditions are concerned, London felt
there might be trouble in Berlin be
cause the banks had not been prudent
in advancing to so great an extent on
securities which the banks themselves
â were really interested in, because the
customers to whom the advances were
made had not the means themselves to
finance them. This condition of great
demand for money immediately
reflected itself in London and
Paris, and, though much less so,
In New York. It is stated by those in
a position to know that the change is
now for the better, and, though money
is still wanted in Berlin, there will be
no great stringency or any difficulty,
because the situation was f.-iced in
good time. As a result, no further ad
vance is anticipated in the rate of the
Bank of England.
"I doubt if the definite announcement
of the signing of the treaty of peace
â with Spain has had much, if anything,
to do with the surprising advance in
all characters of securities. As a mat
ter of fact, all the effects of such an
act had long been discounted, as had
every step in the war insofar as busi
ness was concerned. Much of the ad
vance is upon the basis of merit ow
ing to generally improved conditions.
Some, however, is purely speculative
and may be carried to an extent that
will cause a reaction. This reaction,
whllo it mipht be serious under other
monetary conditions, would have less
marked effect with the plethora of
money on hand everywhere throughout
the country.

there has been some real discussion of
one of the foreign powers negotiating
a loan in New York. All this is ac
centuated by the fact that American
Interests are loaning abroad. The force
of economies in management and ex
penditure Is not the least of the rea
sons for v betterment in values
and more thorough organization In car
rying on gnat enterprises. The reduc
tion of prl< ea in so many things is now
compelled to be met by better systems
of administration and greater volume
Of business. Necessarily is this so in
all classes of industrials and railroads.
"As for the banks, it is the greater
volume of buwlneas alone which enables
them -.vith so great a reduction in the
payment for transacting the business
to make a fair return upon the capital
Invested.
'All this thing benefits more than
any one else the gnat body of con
sumers. lluv\ever, apparently on tht
face of things, combinations may seem
to be at present for the benefit of cap
ital, an analysis of the real effect of
them will show that the consumer is
the largest gainer. The danger in such
combinations lies in their inviting mort
or ies.s speculation, thus affording op
portunity to managers to sacrifice tht
Interests of the great body of share
holders to their own personal gain.
Then, too, the very great resources
vested in them tend to invite political
attack and cause participation in poli
tics by them.
"However, those features can all be
safeguarded, and in time combinations
made within the lines of laws and fair
ness, conducted upon legitimate busi
ness principles, will be accepted here as
as much a part of every day commercial
life as they are in other countries,
where this evolution was long since a
fixture and an accepted benefit.
"It is known that Gorman institutions
have paid in the last five weeks as high
as 4 per cent for six months' loans,
made in Wall and La Palle streets,
which is not excessive when it is re
called that the discount rate of the
Reichbank is 6 per cent.
"Money being dearer in France and in
England than in the United States, the
Inference is logical that the foreign
representatives who are negotiating a
large loan in this country are acting
for" the Czar's Government."
DISMEMBERED BODY
UNDER A WATERFALL
Discovery Made by Boys Near San
Bernardino Gives Evidence of
Murder.
SAN BEKNARDIN'O, Dec. 17.â A
number of boys living in Santa Ana
Canyon about twenty miles northeast
of this city while playing in the can
yon discovered the dismembered and
badly decomposed remains of a human
being. Although the discovery was
made several days ago, for some rea
son it was not reported to the authori
ties until to-day.
The boys who found the body were
sons of George Miller and Mrs. Boren,
respectively, residing on ranch near
the canyon. They were on a little ex
pedition up the side of the canyon be
tween tunnels No. 11 and 12 of the
Southern California Power Company's
canal line. A small stream trickles
down this ravine from over a slight
precipice, under which the action of the
water has caused some cave-like exca
vations. The soil is damp and loose.
While playing around the boys dis
covered an old shovel and the idea
struck them to enlarge the cave. They
set at work, but had done little when
they were horrified at throwing out a
human arm. One of the boys shoved
the spade into the place and this time
a leg was brought forth.
The youths were too scared to con
tinue their excavations and dropping
the spade they hurried homeward.
When George Miller, father of one of
the youngsters, heard their tale he ac
companied them back to the grave un
der the waterfall, and securing the arm
took it up to one of the camps for ex
hibition, but not until to-day were the
authorities notified of the discovery.
Then Coroner Keating went to Red
lands, and, accompanied by Constable
Fetrel and a jury, left on a long drive
to the canyon, from which at a late
hour to-night they have not returned.
The circumstances and the weirdness
of the waterfall grave point to murder
as the cause of the man's death. The
dismemberment could have been caused
by decomposition, but it is more prob
able the body was mutilated. It is re
ported that a couple of men are miss
ing from Redlands.
PEACE COMMISSIONERS
MAINTAIN SILENCE
Decline to Discuss the Terms of the
Treaty With Spain to English
Correspondents.
SOUTHAMPTON, Dec. 17.â T0 the
interviewers who besieged the Ameri
can Peace Commissioners to-day be
fore they sailed for New York on board
the American line steamer St. Louib.
they said they could not discuss tn?
tÂ« mis of the treaty of peace with Sox'n
Whltelaw Reid and Judge Day, thoi'ch

added, it was impossible to ssy whether i

Brighter Prospects.
"I look for a business revival in Cali- I
fornia in '99," said Colonel J. S. Young, '
proprietor of the liuss House, to a re- I
porter yesterday.
"The recent rains promise good crops,
insuring prosperity to the farmers and
putting money in circulation. The ac
; quisition of Hawaii and the Philippines
, will benefit the whole country and espe
cially California. We shall furnish our
products to the army of occupation
there and the troops in transit, as well
as to the naval squadron in those wa
ters. Why, already we send there week
ly 75,000 pounds of meat, and this is
only the beginning." The colonel has
received several interesting letters from
his son at Manila, who belongs to the
First California Regiment. He is so
well pleased with the country that he
may take up his residence there.
On the subject of the Baldwin Hotel
fire Colonel Young said: "I be
lieve it will have a beneficial effect
in calling attention to the dangers
of high hotel buildings, with
out proper fire precautions." It is in
teresting to note in this connection the
striking record of the Russ House. "The
doors of the hotel have never been
rinsed since they were opened in 1862,"
said Colonel Young, "and no Insurance
company has ever been called on to pay
a dollar of fire loss." This is a matter
of public importance just now in view
of the fact that th? hotel is three stories
hich with 300 rooms and an enormous
frontage on Montgomery, Bush and
Pine streets, containing exits to these
thoroughfares, and four exits to the
court in the rear. "So you see," he re
marked, "with a hydro-steam elevator,
the safest in the world, and the other
precautions, our guests can enjoy their
slumbers undisturbed."
It Is not surprising, therefore, that
travelers have furnished testimony that
for moderate price, perfection of ser
vice and equipments the Russ is un
surpassed by any hotel in the United
States.

SOCIALISM IS
NOT IN FAVOR
American Federation
Will Not Indorse It.
PRESIDENT GOMPERS' SPEECH
DENOUNCES THE ATTEMPT TO
WRECK UNIONISM.
Declares the Socialists Have Be
smirched the Name of Labor
and Attacked Its
Integrity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CUY, Dec. 17.â A forlorn
hope was never bolstered by more fiery
eloquence than the Socialists among
the delegates to the American Federa
tion of Labor put forth in behalf of the
principles which they believe offer the
true relief from grinding industrial
conditions and oppression of capital at
this morning's session. The Federation
is opposed to committing itself to the
indorsement of any political party, and
has voted in each annual convention to
this effect. Democrats and Republicans
have given their efforts on behalf of
their theories of government, but the
Socialists have not. Each year when
the convention meets they are on hand.
They realize that their work will be in
vain as far as practical, definite results
are conce: - d, but they glory in the ag
itation they cause and in the fact that
they make converts in secret.
The entire morning sess : 1 to-day
was spent along these lines. While the
speechmaking was at its height Presi
dent dumpers took a hand and de
nounced the efforts of the Socialists to
Infuse their doctrines into those of the
unionists. He said:
"This question involves the integrity
of the laboi; classes of our country.
Either the trades union movement is
right or .t is rong. We must either
declare for the union movement, with
out frills or follies, or make an admis
sion that it is wrong.
" 'By their deeds shall ye know them,'
rather than with their honeyed words
by which they seek to lure us. If they
were to express themselves in this con
vention as they express themselves
outside they know they would not be
tolerated for two minutes. 1 propose to
call attention to the mask and the real
face. These men who ask you to com
mit yourselves to this movement have
in the past done all that a man can do
to disrupt the trades unions. One of the
parties referred to called a convention
to form a rival to the Federation. At
that convention they, on a broad
streamer, emblazoned in letters of red.
Wreck the Old Trades Unions and Pull
for Socialism.'
"They have besmirched the name of
labor. They have attacked the integrity
of the men wh have tried to better the
conditions of labor. They have attacked
conservatism and everything that is
good for our cause.
"If their propositions were likely to
advance the interests of labor, 1 would
give them my adherence at once, but,
knowinr as I do that every attempt at
diverting our efforts has been followed
by an era of ertia and indifference, I
cannot subscribe to them.
"Rather l.an turn our unions into
ward clubs, Wi are working on the line
that will belter our interests before the
whole country.
"I kno..- that progress is necessarily
slow and there is no such thing as a
short cut to the millenium. I am sure
we are on the path of progress. We
should be broad and comprehensive in
all we do and the day of labor's eman
cipation will soon come."
applause followed Mr. Gorn
pers' remarks, and Henry Lloyd of Bos
ton, the conservative economist, took
the floor. He went after the socialists
without gloves.
It was the sense of his remarks that
if the Federation tied itself to any
according to a dispatch from Madrid, was
received there from Havana, cannot be
confirmed here, though a rumor of his
death has been in circulation in this city
for several days past.
In contradiction of the report is another
to the effect that General Gomez It- ft his
tamp at Yaguajay, province of Santa
Clara, and with his main forces went into
camp in the Siguapoa Mountains, in the
same province, but, that, accompanied by
a small escort, he left the camp three
days sinoo, moving westward, and is now
near Cruces, Santa Clara Province, en
route to Havana, whither he will go via
Matanzas. This report has it that Gen
eral Gomez is in good health.
"isnV' it would be useless for it to ask
for legislation at the hands of Congress
or the State Legislatures.
The convention adjourned at noon
without actin"- on any of the resolu
tions.
CLAIMS FOR PENSIONS
BEING DISPOSED OF
Commissioner Evans Already Occu
pied With Cases Arising From
the Recent War.
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Pension
cases arising: from the war with Spain
are being disposed of in special in
stances. The widow of the late Captain
Gridley already draws* her pension ana
the widows of Allyn Capron, father and
son, who lost their lives before Santi
ago, will be put on the list without de
lay. Commissioner Evans will not take
up the grea; bulk of applications now
as some time must elapse before the
files are classified. The Santiago cases
will be considered first, those from the
Manila campaign not yet having been
reached. Besides the pensions already
mentioned one has been granted in the
case of the blind veterans of the San
tiago campaign now in one of the
Washington Hospitals.
REVENUE CUTTER PERRY
STRIKES ON A ROCK
Two Steamships Fail in an Attempt
to Haul the Vessel
Off.
ASTORIA. Or., Dec. 17.â The United
States revenue cu.ter Commodore Perry,
which left this city this morning: for Port
land, struck on a rock near St. Helens in
a thick fog. The Perry lies on me rock
about amidships on the starboard side
and is slightly listed. The steamers Tel
ephone and Undine attempted to pull the
revenue cutter off the rock, but were un
successful. At high tide to-night it is
thought that the steamer Undine will suc
ceed in pulling the Perry. off. The. rock
on which the Perry lies is on the edge of
the channel, and is one of a group in that
vicinity.

RECIPROCITY
WITH CANADA
Basis of the New Com
mercial Treaty.
MORE CONCESSIONS ASKED
WORK OF THE JOINT COMMIS
SION ALMOST COMPLETED.
Lumber the Only Stumbling Block
in the Way of the Speedy
Conclusion of the Nego-
I tiations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.â The meet
ing of the Canadian Joint Commission
on Monday next will be the last before
January 5, when the commissioners will
reassemble in Washington to conclude
whatever treaty they are able to agree
upon for presentation to their respec
ive governments.
It may be definitely stated that a
treaty haviner practically all the points
under consideration, except that of re
ciprocity, will be signed. It is almost
equally sure that some matters of re
ciprocal trade j^ations will be ad
justed and th. t these will be fewer in
number than the Canadian Commis
sioners had hoped in opening the nego
tiations. Any more delinite statement
than this, it is said upon authority,
would be speculative upon a very in
sufficient basis.
It may be said, however, that lumber
and a^ri :ultural products are the two
stumbling blocks to full reciprocity.
The Canadian Commissioners have pre
sented a full statement covering the
lumber trade the gist of which is that
forest products are so larpe a percent
age of Canada's exports and yet are
relatively so small compared with the
total forest product of the United
States that liberal concessions on this
point are essential to satisfy public
sentiment ir Canada and could be made
without serious detriment to the United
States.
Practically the whole statement has
be*n presented concerning agricultural
products. The Canadian Commission
has urged th Canada is a larger con
sumer per capita of American manu
factures than the whole Western hem
isphere south of the United States.
Further, it is urged that last year
Canada gave the United States a $40,
000.000 free list and in view of these
facts some essential concessions must
be made to the Canadian fkrmers, it
being represented that agrarian senti
ment is fully as important to the
Dominion Government as it is to the
United States. This is the status so far
as it can be stated, in which the nego
tiations go over for the holiday recess.

PROMOTION IN STORE
FOR COLONEL PEELER
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 17.â The recent appointment of Adjutant
General Barrett to the position of Bank Commissioner will probably
result in the promotion of Colonel R. P. Peeler, who has served as
assistant adjutant general during General Barrett's incumbency. Gen
eral Barrett will resign in a few days to assume the duties of his
new office, thus leaving the position of adjutant general vacant. The
appointment of Colonel Peeler to the position will be a well-merited
compliment to his worth as an officer as well as a just reward for the
valuable services he has rendered the State during the last four
years. If the appointment is made by Governor Budd, Colonel Peeler
will hold the office of adjutant general for a period of about one
month, or until his successor is appointed by Governor Gage.
of property to nine children. John
Briones was named as executor, but his
brother, Pablo, got possession of all the
legal documents in the case and has
since refused to give them up. About
a month ago somebody told young Pab
lo that his father had left him some
land. He started to read over the
documents in his possession and was
astonished to find a will signed by his
grandfather which had never had the
seal broken. The document told Pablo
Briones Sr. that under a cottage owned
by the testator, situated near the
schoolhouse, was buried $20,u00 in gold
coin. A trapdoor led to th â¢ spot where
the money was cached, and a stake was
driven over the exact spot. The money
was placed in an iron box. By the
terms of the will $2500 was to be de
voted to the erection of a Catholic
church, a like amount to be paid to a
priest for offering up prayer for the re
pose of the testator's soul, and the
remaining $15,000 was to be divided
among the heirs.
Young Pablo was overjoyed at the
information contained in the will, and
his fingers itched to get hold of the
money, but he was afraid to look for it
while the house was tenanted. One day
the will was stolen from his pocket

him apnrehensive, but as the tenants
were to move next day he quieted his
fears.
On the next evening Pablo repaired
to the vacant house. He found the trap
door and the stake, on top of which was
a ring rusted with age. Four feet un
der ground he found the box. Not a
cent was in it. and the loose condition
of the soil showed that the box had
only recently been opened.
Young Briones rushed off and in
formed the local authorities of his
loss. They are now busily engaged in
searching for a clew to the disapear
ance of the money. So far their quest
has been fruitless. The Briones boys
come of an old Spanish family and are

talion and company jealousy, which
for a time was rife throughout the en
tire regiment.
Sickness still prevails, and from
what I can learn nearly a thousand
men are seriously ill in hospital, while
twice that number are walking around
totally unfit for active service. The
California buys have been very lucky
as regards disease. While many of
themâ very many indeed â have been ill,
the mortality among the lads from San
Francisco has been proportionately
small. This is due partially to their
<>\vn good sense, partially to the
nt physique of the regiment, and
In a Kreat measure to the excellent care
taken of them by their col
and members of the medical
staff. About twenty patients now lie
in the smallpox tents, or, rather, about
twenty did lie there last night. How
many remain this morning I am unable
to say. From what is told me I am in
clined to think that these tents must
be anything but pleasant places for
the sufferers they are supposed to
shelter. They stand in an open square
in a central part of the new city. No
shade protects them from the fierce
heat of the midday sun, nor is there
any flooring to keep out the water when
it rains. The consequence Is that on
a pleasant day the heat is well nigh
unbearable and the atmosphere stilling,
while on a stormy day the water runs
in and overflows the ground, turning
the dirt of their floors into a slushy bed
of mud two Inches deep in which the
cots of the patients stand. However,
I suppr.-se such conditions cannot be
immediately remedied, or they would
Great dissatisfaction is expressed all
through the regiment with the manner
in which the Red Cross people are con
ducting their establishment down here.
They certainly do some goodâ they
could hardly do otherwise considering
the splendid manner in which
the people at home have out
rl them and the generous way
which they are backed. But
good they are accomplishing
is nothing in comparison with what
such an organization could accomplish
, were the direction of its affairs placed
! in competent hands, and the manage
! ment of its funds entrusted to a man
: whose brains were his recommendation
â  and who traveled on his executive abll
j ity and not on his glib tongue.
The waste and extravagance that re
| suits from Sehlott's incompetency
would in itself be sufficient to support
a hospital four times the size of the
place he now runs and would almost
; supply the entire regiment with the
; delicacies consumed by the compara
tively small number of sick. The best
men that the society sent out, such, for
instance, as Waage, Lewis and Hark
(now assisting Dr. O'Brien at the
smallpox hospital), have become so dis
gusted with Schlott and his methods

that they refuse to work under his au
thority and the only people who now
look to him as chief are the few women
whom he has brought with him to nurse
the sick and teach the waltz in Manila-
Such help as he has afforded the medi
cal staff has been wrung from him by
diplomacy. In this good work all have
heartily joined with the result that the
regiment is now better off than most of
its fellows, though its sick receive not
nearly as much as they would from the
expenditure of, say, $700 or $SOO per
month, placed in the hands of the regi
mental staff, to be used as those three
gentlemen see fit.
With the arrival of every succeeding
steamer the city takes on more and
more of an American appearance; new
placesâ mostly barsâ spring up, the old
Spanish signs disappear and new ones,
suggestive of a newer and more pro
gressive people, take their places.
Wives of army and navy officers have
arrived and the sight of a pretty
American face is not uncommon now
on the Luneta, while the swish of
American skirts on the Escolta is
heard nearly every hour of the day.
These sights and sounds, together
with the appearance of the city itself,
which 1b gradually becoming more
pleasing to the eye owing to the con
scientious work being done by the Health
Department, tend to remind one more
and more of home, with the result that
a few are becoming contented with
their lot, while the many, realizing the
Joys they have forÃaken, are more
homesick than ever.
Social life is also beginning to blos
som forth; dinner parties and the ex
change of friendly visits are things of
nightly occurrence, while ever and anon
some one gets up a dance which is al
ways a success, though the proportion
of men to women is about forty to
one.
Clubs are springing up; two or
three of a social character are already
in a flourishing condition, and the pre
liminary steps to the organization of a
parlor of Elks and a Masonic lodge are
well under way. The great American
prize ring is also an established fact.
A sporting club known as "The Ameri
can Athletic Club of Manila" has been
organized and intends opening on No
vember 10 with the followine splendid
exhibition of fistic talent:
Three round go â F. L. Owen vs. H. P.
Sawyer. Both men belong to the First
California, and both are â  members of
the San Francisco CadeV Athletic
Club.
Three round go â Fred Long vs. W r . B.
Porter, First California. Porter is an
old member of the Manhattan Athletic
Club and a boxer of consiaerable repu
tation.
After the conclusion of these prelim
inaries there will be two four round
contests for a decision and a purse
each, between William Monahan. 135
pounds, First California and San Fran
cisco Athletic Club, and H. Jones. 136 VÂ«
pounds. First California; and Private
McGuire of the Wyomings. who will
fight at 140 pounds, will try to whip
Private Henrie, of the Third Artillery,
who will meet him at the same weieht.
The event of the evening will be a
four-round contest between two welter
weights, J. McMurry of the Colorados
and Jim Kavanaugh of the Montanas,
who will spar for a decision and a per
centage of the gate receipts.
Sergeant Joseph Maher of the First
California is the manager of the new
club, while James McQueeney of the
same regiment has been appointed of
ficial timekeeper. On November 11
Tom Lynch of the Third Artillery will
act as referee.
The admission to this first prizefight
in Manila will be Jl American or $2
Mexican. The entire army is deeply
interested and the old cockpit, where
the bouts will be fought, will be crowd
ed to Its limits when the night of the
contest arrives.
There is also some talk among our
boys of getting up a neld day to be
held in the early part of next month.
A football game for Thanksgiving is
among the possibilities of the near
future. There are enough men in the
regiment to make a fair representation,
both of the blue and gold and cardinal,
and I venture to say that it will be
something of a sight to see the boys
turn out to do their devoirs before
mahogany bleachers, crowded from top
to bottom with Mestizo, Spanish and
Filipino belles, each wearing the colors
of her favorite college and rooting for
its success.
Of the boys themselves there is but
little to say. They don't take to gar
rison duty with the same enthusiasm
as they do to active campaigning and
flgting. They realize that they must
endure it, however, whether they like
it or not, so they go along doing the
best they can, than which no body
of men can do more, and while waiting
for the hour of deliverance and the
order which will deliver them from out
this Oriental land of Egypt and house
of bondage, continue to perfect them
selves in drill and in all else, particular
ly patience, that becomes a soldier.
Sol Sheridan leaves to-morrow for
home via Hongkong. He has by his
long association with the regiment
come to be regarded as one of the b.iys.
Officers and men look upon his depart
ufe as a regimental calamity.
wiaplain McKinnon accompanies Mr
Sheridan as far as Hongkong. Father
McKinnon takes this trip by the orders
of his physician, as he has been so
worn out by his numerous duties that
were he to continue their interrupted
performance he would be in danger of a
total physical collapse.
The regimental stocking is hanging at
our open fireplace and every boy In
the entire command will close his eyes
Christmas eve praying that, when he
awakes he may find, hidden in its
depths, the welcome order home.
CONTROLLER COLGAN'S
BIENNIAL REPORT
Coming Session of the Legislature Is
Expected to Cost the State
$125,500.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 17.â Controller
Colgan to-day filed his biennial reDort
with Governor Budd. The report showa
that during the past two fiscal years
expenditures have exceeded receipts by
$827,055 79. The law of 1893 imposing
a tax on collateral inheritances has.
during the past two years, added 5144,
217 to the school fund.
Attention is called the fact that
there is no provision for replacing
buildings destroyed by fire except by a
legislative appropriation, and the re
port recommends that a fund be ret
aside which can be drawn upon for
erecting or repairing buildings without
waiting for an appropriation.
It Js recommended that a fund be
created to be used in the case of the
National Guard being called to suppress
riot or in other emergency.
The report concludes with estimates
of expenditures for the next two years.
It is estimated that the coming "Legis
lature will cost the State $126,500. No
les sthan $406,150 is thought to be
necessary for military purposes. The
cost of the State printing office is put
down at $285,800.

ONE-TWELFTH
ACT WILL BE
THE REMEDY
Teachers Will Begin the Battle
of the Courts for Their
Pilfered Pay.
Director Waller Appeals to Judge Belcher
to Annul His Rigorous In
junction.
The passing: of claims to the amount of
$63,953 for supplies by the Board of School
Directors to the exclusion of teachers'
salaries which are now due and payable
for the month of November has aroused
the community to a pitch of great excite
ment, and it is the universal opinion that
something: should be done to compel the
shifty but solid eight to pay the just
claims of the teachers, who have earned
their remuneration by the faithful per
formance of their onerous duties. In
quiry at the law offices of Garber, Olney
& Olney, who are representing the teach
ers in the present effort to compel the
School Directors to pass their salary
warrants, failed to elicit any information
as to the method of procedure which they
intend to follow, on the ground that it
would tend to forewarn the other Bide,
and they argue that such a course is not
good policy on their part. They are,
however, thoroughly confident that they
have a good case, and that the teachers
will be made happy by shortly receiving
their salaries in full, a result which will
be fully appreciated by them, especially
at this season of the year. The first step
taken yesterday was the filing of eight
hundred claims for salaries duly sworn
to and formally presented to Secretary
Welch of the Board of Education.
Inquiry in other quarters as to the legal
remedy in the matter was made, and it
was learned that there were three ways
in which the desired result could be ac
complished. The first is to have a per
emptory writ of mandate issued on the
School Board compelling them to sign
the warrants for the salaries. If this be
successful there would be no need of hav
ing recourse to the other two proceedings.
These last are founded on questions of
fact and hinge on the plea that ths de
mands of 163,953 for supplies which have
been sent to the Auditor were all in
curred during the months of July, August,
September, October and November, and
consequently the board had no authority
to pass them, as the appropriation had
already been used up for those months
under the provisions of the one-twelfth
act. That is the groundwork of the com
plaints which may be filed. It is then in
order to have a writ of injunction issued
on the Auditor enjoining him from slgn
lng the demands, or failing in this an
other writ may issue preventing the
Treasurer from paying them.
But if these two remedies should fail,
then the board may b^ held responsible
for passing the demands for supplies in
violation of the one-twelfth act and would
be liable on their bonds. This last may,
after all, be the most effectual method
of bringing the unsavory majority of the
board to time and punishing them for
their misdeeds.
The one-twelfth act is very clear cm the
liability of officials who violate its express
provisions and it will be relied on to reach
the School Directors or any other officers
of the municipal government. Section 6of
the act reads that "All Supervisors, as
well as the Auditor or any other officer
authorized or aiding to authorize or au
diting or allowing any claim or demand
upon or against said treasury or any fund
thereof in violation of any of the provis
ions of the one-twelfth act shall be liable
in person and upon their several official
bonds to the contractor damaged by such
illegal authorization ,by reason of the non
payment of his claim."
The teacher comes under this category,
for he or she has contracted or sworn to
do certain work for a stated amount.
Again section 7 of the same act says:
"The Treasurer paying any claim author
ized or allowed or audited in violation of
these provisions shall be liable on his
official bond to refund the same to the
city treasury."
There is no question that the remedy is
apparent if the demands were passed in
violation of the act, and the facts unmis
takably bear out that assumption. Injunc
tions in the cases of swelling the substi
tute list with thirty new teachers and the
abolishing of the business evening school
were successful, and they should be
equally successful in the present teachers'
emergency of the non-payment of salar
ies.
The "open door" policy inaugurated in
the financial system of the Board of Edu
cation by the startling opinion of District
Attorney Dunne was taken advantage of
yesterday when Attorney Powers carted
out of Secretary Welch's office at the
City Hall supply claims aggregating $30.
000 and over. He took them to the of
fice^)f Auditor Broderick and left them
wit# him for his necessary signature,
though none of them had been signed by
either Superintendent Webster or Presi
dent Barrington. It was the first ag
gressive step taken against the teachers
since the passage of the resolution rob
bing them of their November salaries.
It is also the first step taken toward
robbing them also of their pay for DeÂ»
cember. At the end of this month there
would be enough money and to spare in
the treasury to pay one month's salaries,
were the Directors so disposed, but dis*
posed they are not, and as fast as bills
can be brought in and sent downstairs
without the Superintendent's signature
they will be audited.
It is no matter of choice with Auditor
Broderick. He has not the right of pref
erence. That lies with the Board of Ed
ucation, and upon it be the blame. So
long as the claims that are brought to
him, be they of merchants or pedagogues,
are within the provisions of the one
twelfth act, he is obliged to audit them
against the moneys to the department's
credit.
The injunction Issued by Judge Belcher
on Friday against the Directors has left
them in i Quandary, though they will
use every effort to have it annulled. Tt
was the programme of the board to en
list the legal services of eminent and re
putable attorneys and to appear yester
day morning before Judge Belcher with
an application to have the restraining
instrument dissolved, but Director Waller
went off half cocked, and with Jake
Samuels in tow, appeared before the
Judge yesterday morning and made per
emptory demand upon him. Judge
Belcher looked up from the work on his
desk before him and said. "What is it
you want, gentlemen?" "We want to
speak with your Honor upon a matter
of gravest importance." replied Samuels
6uavely. "A restraining order most un
just has been issued against one of the
most important bodies of this municipal
ity and we wish to auk your Honor to
withdraw"â
"Law and motion day is on Friday, sir';
if you wish to make a motion come here
then," brusquely retorted Judge Belcher,
and the premature Waller and suave
Samuels retired discomfited.
"I can see our finish " said Waller later.
" We'll go In there Friday and he will
take our motion under advisement for a
we.-k and then we will be out of office."
Director Ragan is more firm than ever
in his intention to see that justice is done
to ex-Teacher Stanton when he arrives in
this city for the purpose of presenting hla
knowledge of the School Board before the
Grand Jury. Director Ragan, who had the
recently quashed indictment for extortion
found against Stanton in the first place,
was In consultation yesterday with his
attorneys, W. W. Foote, Reel B. Terry,
J. J. Dwyer and Andy Clunie. They have
advised him that he has a good case
against his man and on Monday morning:
Mr. Terry will appear before Judge Car
roll Cook to ask that the indictment be re
stored against the ex-teacher. He will
base his request upon the grounds stated
in The Call of yesterday morning. Dr.
Ragan is very bitter at the allegations
that Stanton has made against him and
is resolved to make him prove his asser
tions and to also pay the penalty for his
alleged attempted blackmail.
Albert Lyser, principal of the John
Swett Grammar School, expressed himself
in no uncertain terms against the pay
ment of contractors' demands and the
consequent total ignoring of the teachers'
claims for salaries. He said:
"1 do not like to antagonize the mer
chants on this score, but the bills for
these supplies were contracted previous
to the month of December, and it is pro
posed to take the money from this
month's appropriation to pay them. Now
If the one-twelfth act means anything It
means that these bills of the merchants
should be ordered paid within the month
in which they were contracted. I want
to disclaim strongly on behalf of the
teachers any antagonism to those mer
chants or any opposition to the payment
of their just claims, for I believe them
to be just and that they should be paid.
But they should have been paid as the
teachers' salaries are, from month to
month, and ought not to be allowed to ac
cumulate until they eat up the legal ap
propriation for an entire month, so as to
prevent payment of the teachers' just
earnings. The teachers are very much
wrought up over this question, as they
fear the stoppage of the December sal
aries, with no certainty of ever getting
the money. The matter is of sufficient
importance to necessitate arousing the
community to a realization of the great
injustice being done to them.
"The difficulty comes not so much from
the excessive bills for school supplies as
from the overcrowding of the schools
with unnecessary teachers, the number of
whom is startling. By those I mean the
'floaters,' or unassigned teachers. We
have too many day, evening and High
School substitutes. The substitute list is
apparently depleted, but this is caused by
the great number of teachers in schools
who nave no visible occupation, and who
are really not needed.
"When School Director Waller made the
statement that the John Swett School had
been furnished with $3000 worth of furni
ture I fear that he was greatly mistaken
in his figures, for I saw every piece of
it and consider that less than half that
amount shouui have covered the cost.
"I do not know just how the teachers'
attorneys will proceed in the matter of
compelling the board to pay salaries, but
I understand that they are actively en
gaged in formulating their plans, and I
have no doubt that they will be entirely
successful. 1 '

Remains Shipped to Ohio for
Interment-
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â The funeral of
ex-Senator Calvin S. Brice of Ohio took
place to-day in the Fifth-avenue Presby
terian church. The edifice was crowded.
The Rev. Dr. Wallace Radcliffe of
Washington was in the pulpit when the
remains were brought in, and the choir
in waiting began to sing "Sun of My
Soul" as the casket was borne up the
maine aisle. It was placed on a bier and
partly covered with lilies of the valley
and carnations.
At the close of the service the body
was carried out before the congregation
dispersed, while the choir sang "Abide
With Me."
A large delegation of members of the
Ohio Society were present. Among the
prominent persons in the church were
Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll, Senator
Mark Hanna, General T. H. C. Collins.
General Anson G. McCook, H. H. Red
way, General Henry L. Burnett, George
R. Sheldon, Colonel Arthur W. Soper and

Thingvalla, bound from New York for
Christiania. passed Dunnett Head to-day
and signaled that she had on board the
crew of the British steamer Govlne,
which foundered at sea December 11.
The Govine, Captain Dickinson, sailed
from Leith on November 25th for Balti
more. She was built at Sunderland in

SOUGHT TO TUNNEL
FROM SAN QUENTIN
Two Convicts Detected While Drill
ing Into the Floor of Their
Cell.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Dec. 17.-Two
Russians confined on charges of burglary
attempted to escape from the peniten
tiary last evening by drilling a hole in the
floor of their cell with the intention of
sinking a shaft and tunneling their way
to the bay shore. They were detected
while at work by Captain Edgar and his
assistants and both placed in solitary con
finement.
The two are J. Borniatorsky. who is
serving twenty years for a burglary com
mitted in San Francisco, and "Ax Joe,"
who was sent from Santa Clara County
for one year on a similar charge. The real
name of the latter has never been learned.
Borniatorsky worked in the Jute mill,
where he contrived to fashion a rude
auger, which was smuggled to his cell in
the southern building. The convicts had
the iron floor of their cell nearly pierced
when discovered. The stupendous nature
of their task is manifest when it is stated
that to reach the outer world they would
have had to tunnel nearly 2000 feet.
LOS ANGELES CHOSEN.

CHICAGO. Dec. 17.â The executive com
mittee of the National Educational Asso
ciation was in session at the Great North
ern Hotel to-day to determine upon some
suitable place for the next meeting of

Democrats Lose Control.
SUISUN, Dec. 17.â When the successful
candidates at the recent election take
their official positions after January 1,
some noticeable changes will be observed.
For the first time in fifteen years the
Board of Supervisors in Yolo County will

Supervisors, which has had a Demo
cratic majority for a similar period, will,
after the next monthly meeting, consist
of three Republicans and two Democrats.
The administrations, too, of several offi
cials who have held office for many years
will close. In Napa County George S. Me-
Kenzie, who has held the office of Sheriff
for ten years, will retire. Charles Schir
mer of Solano County, who has acted in
the capacity of County Assessor for
twelve years, will also vacate his posi
tion.
Fail to Find a Leper.
WOODLAND, Dec. 17.â Another thor
ough but unavailing search was made by
the officers on Thursday night for the
leper in old Chinatown. The officers have

NEEDS OF THE MEDICAL
BRANCH OF THE ARMY
General Sternberg Appears Before
the House Committee on Mili
tary Affairs.
WASHINGTON* Dec. 17.â Surgeon Gen
eral Sternberg of the army was heard by
the House Committee on Military Affairs
to-day concerning the proposed Increase
in the army. In the main the hearing
was confined to the bureau needs with
reference to the recent war. General
Sternberg said the medical branch of the
army at no time had been adequate, even
in time of peace. Now that it was pro
posed to expand the army fourfold, the
medical branch should be expanded at
least threefold. He urged that the most
essential need of the medical corps was to
have experienced men quickly available
for emergencies The want of experienced
medical officers had been the main trou
ble in the recent war.
The Burgeon general, he believed, should
be given the rank of major general, al
though he hardly expected this to be done.
He was ready to go on until retirement on
the present basis himself, and merely
urged the rank as a matter of proper or

TO REPUDIATE
HART'S CLAIM
Attorney Trusted to
His Honor.
SAVED HIM FROM STRIPES
SENATORIAL ASPIRANT SAYS IT
WAS WORK FOR GLORY.
Suit for $25,000 Compensation Will
Come Up for Trial February 27.
The Colonel Pleads Statute
of Limitations.
A further illustration of the manner of
tnan the Southern Pa<-ine has selected as
Its candidate for th~ United States Senate
will shortly be given, when the case of A.
1... Hart vs. D. M. Burns conies up lor
trial before Judge Dunne in the Superior
Court of the city and county of San Fran
cisco.
It is a matter of public knowledge that
Hart was Burns' attorney at the time of
Ms direst need. He went to his aid when
the gates of the penitentiary were yawn
ing wide to receive him, after he had been
deserted by his friends and political asso
ciates and was without money or means
â¢with which to defend himself against the
charges of embezzlement growing out of
his alleged misappropriation of public
funds while Secretary of State.
There were twelve indictments filed
against Burns in the Superior Court at
Sacramento, and the evidence to substan
tiate them was so strong that attorneys
of established reputation prophesied that
he would in all probability spend the re
minder of his days behind prison walls.
Hart took charge of his case, without
hope of immediate rev. .rd, because he
knew Burns had no money, and after a
legal battle which attracted attention
through the length and breadth uf th,e
State, and even beyond its borders, suc
ceeded in securing the acquittal of his
client on one uf the charges. Eventually
the remaining indictments were dismissed.
Hart a. so acted as one of the attorneys
fur the defense in the action brought by
the State to recover $31,734 64, the all. g< â !
amount of his shortage while Seen
of State, together with 25 per cent dam
ages and interest, making a total of over
$4t>,000. This suit was brought in San
Francisco and subsequently transferred
to Yolo County. The records show that
Judgment for defendant was entered in
March, ISST. This judgment was set aside
on January 13. ISSB, and a nominai judg
ment for Jlltjji entered in favor of the
State, which was paid on March 12 of the
came year. Hart was the heart and soul
of the defense during all the time these
cases were pendingâ a period of ten years
from 18S3 to 1893. He spent his own money
freely, and even secured bondsmen for
Burns at a time when the disgraced ex
offlcial's own friends, or those whom he
supposed to be his friends, would have
nothing to do with him. And he did this
on the strength of Burns' word that he
â would make things right when hi 6 Mexi
can mines began to pay. But the Burns
of fifteen years ago was no more to be
trusted than the politician Burns of to
day, and instead of rewarding the man
who saved him from prison he repudiated
hip promise.
.Hart brougrht suit for J2.J.000 for his]
services on November 22, 1894, and oaA
March 14, 1595, Burns filed his answer.
The answer is a remarkable doeunvnt.
In it Burns declares that Hart fought for ;
practically ten years to keep him (Burns) :
from the penitentiary and to prevent him <
from being compelled to make restitution
to the State he was charged with defraud
ing without expectation of reward; that
he volunteered his services with the un
derstanding that he was not to receive
any pay other than the satisfaction he
might derive from the knowledge that he
hRd saved a fellow-man from oblivion and
disgrace presumably.
However, in order to show what a lib
eral man he is. Burns says that notwith
standing he was under no obligation? to
his attorney, he did, on December 6, 1888
pay Mr. Hart the sum of $2000 as "a do
nation and mark of gratitude," and
is was accepted by the attorney as
Then for fear the payment of that sum
should be construed to mean that the
accommodating attorney had really ex
pected pay for his services, and that this
understanding was also at one time
shared by him, the answer to the com
piaint goes on to state that the claim
of the attorney is barred by the statute
of limitations. This will be 'the real de
fense of the Senatorial aspirant in his ef
fort to avoid the payment of claim fur
services of the man who stood by him
and defended him in the days of adver
sity, when friends were scarce and he had
no money to hire counsel or buy immu
nity from punishment.
To the ordinary man it would appear
Btrange that Burns should seek to evade
the payment of a rla.m of this characti r
but he is not an ordinary man. He is not
Influenced or moved by any of those con
siderations that direct the actions of
those who have a high regard for their
honor, as is evidenced by his attempt to
take refuge behind the statute of limita
tions.
The case came up on Friday on a mo
tion of the attorneys for Ehe plaintiff that
the case be set for trial, and Judge Dunne
designated February 27 as the date. M. M
Kstee, of counsel for Burns, liied a writ
ten demand for a jury trial, which Indi
cates that Burns fears to allow the case
to be tried by a Judge, but hopes to se
cure a jury that will be favorable to his
interests.
It is intimated that when the trial Is
begun Attorney Hart will spring a sen
sation of the harassing sort, and the ene
mies of the colonel are chuckling over the
treat they believe to be In store for
them through the falling out of the old
friends, caused by the stinginess and lack
of honor of th* Mexican mine owner and
California politician.

GRAND JURY
HAS GONE THE
WAY OF BLOCK
Over a Thousand Shy
in Its Accounts.
EMPLOYED FOUR EXPERTS
STENOGRAPHER COMMANDED A
FANCY SALARY.
The Allowance of the Fiscal Year Is
All Spent and Only an
Â§1100 Deficit Ra
ni ains.
The present Grand Jury is proving an
expensive ornament. Like the high priced
Mr. Block, who conducts the Tax Collect
or's office on principles unique or noth
ing, ii has not performed service com
mensurate with the casb it has expend
ed. Like Mr. Blo< k. who has not left
enough "f th< funds apportioned to his of
â  â¢ â¢â > pay I'm- his successor's stamps,
the jury has not enough left to pay the
s'Tvi< c <if its successor's tirst BUbpena.
There was $1500 appropriated to its
uses on tin first of this fiscal year, which
ends on July l next. The jury has spent
$2667 25. This is the amount to date; there
; will be 1200 added to it before the month
is out and the body adjourned. In all
justice to the jury, it has not really spent
that amount of money. Auditor Broder
ick would not let it. It Ims passed claims
to that amount, but Mr. Brnderick has
only allowed the payment of them to the
limitâ slsoo. ihe rest is to come from
some source that even the Grand Jury
has'not been able to find. In its extrem
ity it has turned to the "urgent neces
sity" fund, but that plan will not work
for the reason that that fund is to be re
sorted to only when no other means of
payment is provided by the statutes.
The jury's overdraft consists of luxu
ries rather than actual necessities. Pro
fessor Kilpatriek, who was employed to
expert the funds and finances of the
School Board, is down for $116. A. W.
Atherton. who aided Kilpatriek in his
investigations of the Directors, is in for
$90. Miss Clara Stockton, who started
tn last July as stenographer to the Jury
at a meager $100 a month, was raised in
October to $V~~> for meritorious service,
and when she put her bill in with Â»5
tacked on as rent for her accompanying
typewriter, no one said anything unkind
about it and she was paid forthwith. F.
A. Elliot has also posed as an expert, an
expense since July 1. at $'* a pose, ex
cepting: Sundays. His total bill will be
close to $SiX>. There were also numerous
Inspections in which the jury and prom
inent citizens in carriages ran up an ac
count for livery that foots up *ls.">. and
there were otiiers on the list which
with those already mentioned foots up as
follows:
F. A. Elliot, expert. $790; Clara Stock
ton, stenographer, J7OS; E. Hughes, sta
tionery, JI7H; Thomas Kelley. carriage
hire, $143; M. Flagley. carriage hire. $42 50;
Howard Vcrnon, stenographer. $13 75; G.
Edward "Wright, expert, $585; E. C. Kil
patriek. expert, $116; A. \V. Atherton, ex
pert. J9O: total, $2667 26.
Of the $1500 apportioned to jury purposes
the present body was entitled to only
$750, but as it was not hedged in by the
restricting conditions of the one-twelfth
act, it has spent not only Its own BCare
ami that of its successor, but has left
a deficit of $1167 25. This amount may lie
cut down ?555 by the non-allowance of the
$585 claim of <;. Edward Wright, also an
expert. Mr. Wright's duties were in
the investigation of a State matter and
upon that account Auditor Broderick has
refused to allow his claim, despite that
Mayor Phelan has ridiculed the Auditor's
law and has sent him several pointed let
ters embodying the Pheian idea.
The grand Jurors are not alone in their
little shortage. The stationery fund is
depleted and by the end of the year will
be shy nearly $1000. The public buildings
fund "is already J2SOU to the bad with
more to follow. The repairs fund is in
the same delicate condition, and though
all of these moneys are supposed to be
protected by the one-twelfth act there
will be a big deficit to meet the officials
of the succeeding term. The officials of
the Auditor's office and those of the office
Of the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors
say positively that these over-allowances
cannot be paid out of the urgent neces
sity fund, although at present all de
mands are being made upon it. Just
where the puzzle Is going to find a solu
tion is just now a matter of much con
jecture with those directly concerned.

A VICTIM OF FORGERS.
An English Globe-Trotter Swindled
by a Clever Gang at Honolulu.
J. Morris of York, England, who arrived
from Honolulu on the Mariposa and is
now at the Occidental Hotel, tells a story
of the clever work of a gang of forgers
he met at Honolulu, which shows how
cleverly these gentlemen work.
Mr. Morris and his niece. Miss Bernard,
have been making a tour of the world and
stopped at Honolulu to witness the an- \
nexation ceremonies. Miss Barnard is a
euchre enthusiast and while in the isl
ands her uncle got up a euchre party at
the Royal Hotel, to which he invited
three gentlemen who were stopping at
that house. At the beginning of the game
each member of the party inscribed their
name on the top of a card / and.when the
game was < finished the cards were left
lying on the table. The card bearing Mr.
Morris' name was gathered in by one of
the party and a short time afterward he
missed his check-book. It was finally re
covered by the Hawaiian police and Mr.
Morris at once noticed that several
checks had been torn out. He at once
came to this country and cabled his bank
ers in England to stop payment on the
checks â  '

A RIVAL TO THE AMERICAN
TOBACCO COMPANY.
An Expert's Opinion.
The last issue of "Tobacco"â published in.
London, Englandâ contains the following
interview: "A Central News telegram on
Wednesday morning last reported the for
mation in America of the Union Tobacco
Company, with a capital of $10,000,000. with
the object of fighting the American To
bacco Company.
"The American Tobacco Company, pop
ularly known as the Tobacco Trust, be
ing by far the largest concern of its kind
in the world, a representative of 'Tobacco
called last Thursday on Mr. Bernhard
Baron in view of getting an opinion from
the best available source as to what ef
fect an opposing faction would have on
the Tobacco Trust.
"Mr. Baron has for some years past
been managing- director in America of
the National Cigarette and Tobacco Com
panyâin fact, he to-day holds over $400,
000 In shares of the capital stock.
"He states that his company and him
self have, for the past years, been trying
to do what the Union Tobacco Company
is now attempting. They had all the
money necessary at their command, and
tried every conceivable way to gain a
foothold and obtain the patronage of the
public. Any one who has visited America
will readily acknowledge that the 'Admi
ral' Cigarettes have been advertised in
every corner of the States, and money
was lavished in every direction to get
hold of the trade and patronage of the
public, but without success, while the
American Tobacco Company has in
creased and grown larger and more pow
erful than ever.
"He therefore prophesies without hesi
tation that the Union Tobacco Company
is embarking In a hopeless enterprise. The
American Tobacco Company's great
stronghold in America is the public, both
the masses and the classes, and controll
ing and buying as they do from 60 to 70
per cent of the bright tobacco of Vir
ginia and North Carolina, they are in a
position to give the American public the
best article for the least money, which
they can do as well, if not better, than
any one else, and it is safe to say that
any organization, even with a capital of
$50,000,000, would not affect the American
Tobacco Company in the least, and espe
cially under the presidency of Mr. Duke,
whose ability has brought the company
to its present high standing, and as long
as he lives and is at its head it Is sure to
progress, and will be the greatest con
cern that the world has ever seen.
"Mr. Baron further states, in conclusion,
that to oppose a company like the Ameri
can Tobacco Company now is, with all their
prestige, financial standing and the best
management in the world, would only be
a waste of time, money and energy, "and
suggests that it would be more advisable
for one with a good paying business to
combine with the American Tobacco Com
pany to make them still greater, rather
than oppose them."â New York Tribune,

ground that on Turner's second trial the

,
CRIME OF AN EX-BELL BOY
ASSAULTS HARRY CHILDS
WHILE HE IS ASLEEP.
Invades His Room in the St. Nicholas
and Attempts to Murder Him.
Captured by the
Police.
Harry Childs, who conducts a news
stand In the St. Nicholas Hotel, yester
day Informed the police that a burglar
entered his room in the hotel shortly after
2 o'clock yesterday morning and grabbing
him by the throat placed a sponge satu
rated with chloroform to tots nostrils.. He
seized the intruder, who fought desper
ately to escape from the room. In the
struggle Childs severely bit one of his as
sailant's fingers.
As he ran from the room Childs fol
lowed him, lustily calling for help. In
the dim light which was burning in the
hallway he claims he caught a glimpse
of the burglar and immediately recog
nized him as a young man named Steve
Harding, who formerly worked as a bell
boy in the Palace Hotel.
Detectives Tom Gibson and Edward
Egan, after listening to his story, started
out to arrest Harding. They found him
at the Fashion stables on Ellis street,
conversing with one of the employes. He
was placed under arrest and taken to po
lice headquarters. In one of his pockets
was found a loaded revolver. He also
had a special policeman's star, which he
claimed was given him by a friend. When
questioned by the detectives Harding said
he was 20 years of age, and had worked
in various hotels as bellboy.
He admitted that he had a "scrap"
with Childs. but denied that he had in
tended to rob him.
"I have known Childs for some time,"
he remarked, "frequently occupying the
Bame room with him in the St. Nicholas.
Last Thursday night I shared his couch
with him, as I was without sufficient
money to rent a room. About 2 o'clock
yesterday morning I went to his room
and found the door unlocked. The light
was burning and I looked in. Childs was
in bed. apparently asleep. I walked away,
but returned in a few minutes, to find
that he had extinguished the light. Aa
I entered the room I walked over to the
bed. when Cnilds caught me around the
neck and started to strangle me: I drew
back, dragging him out of bed. I vainly
struggled to release his hold on my neck,
but as I was growing weak I struck him
with my clinched fist. The blow caused
him to cry with pain, and as he fell to
the floor I ran from the door, as I did
not want to be arrested."
Harding denied that he intend ort to mb
Childs. He declared that the latter was
his friend and was surprised to learn that
he should accuse him of such a serious
crime.
Childs has a diamond ring valued at
tIOOO and several other diamonds, which
the police thinK excited the cupidity at
Harding and he determined to get them,
even at the risk of committing murder.
AVhen he retired on the night of the at
tempted robbery Childs had over $800,
which he placed under the pillow after
divesting himself of his clothes. Harding
know that he had the money on him.
and expected to get away with it, as well
as the diamonds. Last night the de
tectives visited the room occupied by
Harding at 340 Geary street and found
a half-emptied bottle of chloroform.
He was charged with burglary, assault
to rob and carrying concealed weapons.

AN INSTANCE OF DEGENERACY.
ABOUT the man Dunning, who appears as a
witness with intent to place a rope about the
neck of Mrs. Botkin, there hovers a shadow of
odium through which he may be discerned, a pitiful
and repellent embodiment of moral degeneracy.
That he should be here asa witness is not in itself
reprehensible, for the duty of throwing every possible
light upon the tragedy is one from which he could not
well escape. But, if governed by normal, impulses,
there must be ever before him a series of pictures in
which the prisoner and himself are central figures,
portrayed as rioting in an environment of shame.
If the woman is guilty, she is not alone in her
guilt. If she planned and carried out a diabolical
murder, she drew inspiration from the companion
ship of one who was in honor bound to be the com
panion and support of another. Dunning may swear
to belief in her guilt; he cannot swear to an easy
conscience assuring him of his own innocence. When
the two camt to the parting of the ways the evil had
been done, and the germ of crime had showed pri
mary signs of growth. It was nurtured by affection
ate letters from him. He manifested no inclination to
break away from an evil association formed here, al
though thousands of miles lay between him and the
wretched woman whose love he had won.
All the unhappy episodes which make up the som
ber story may be traced to the racetrack, that potent
promoter of crime. Its fascinations first led Dunning
to be recreant in his trust as an employe, and broke
up a home where had been affection and content.
Left without domestic restraints, he easily formed an
alliance with this shallow Botkin creature, and to
gether they sought the races. In their relations all
sense of propriety was cast aside, ar.d their gross of
fending was open to the eyes of the little under world
in which they moved. It seems that even when separ
ated they would not give each other up. While writ
ing to his wife, he was also writing to his mistress.
In the heart of the latter, according to present under
standing, devotion to the man became colored by
hatred lor the wife of the man. She tried to bring
about divorce, and, failing, projected murder into the
situation â a murder foul and recklessly planned for
the probable slaying of many innocent.
Doubtless Dunning was shocked, but he gave no
indication. Perhaps he realized that, if guilt there
was, part of it belonged to him, yet he does not act
at one burdened of soul. Were he an ordinary man
he would be so cast down that he would give his tes
timony knowing it to be not more an accusation than
a confession.
PRIMARY ELECTION LAWS.
A MORNING contemporary, speaking of the ef
fort that is now being made to frame a pri
mary election law which will be constitutional,
remarks that "it is always an easy matter in framing
a bill of this sort to insert provisions which, on the
surface, appear of good intention â provisions that
when the law comes to the test may defeat its whole
purpose either by running counter to the organic law
or by providing a masked loophole for its evasion."
The idea, as this commentator puts it, is that the
framers- of primary legislation fail to score either
through design or ignorance, or inability to under
stand the mind of the Supreme Court.
This is exactly the situation, expressed in ex
tremely courteous language. The fact, more roughly
stated, is that the framers of primary election laws are
mostly politicians who do not understand the subject
at all. Instead oi making a thorough examination of
the statutes, the decisions of the courts and similar
la^vs in other States, they sit down and draw up bills
which they think will best conserve their own inter
est?. They insert in these measures everything that
occurs to them without reference to system or legal
theory. After the bill is passed and somebody con
tests its constitutionality, they appear to be astonished
because the Supreme Court holds it to be unconstitu
tional.
This was exactly what happened with the primary
law enacted by the Legislature in 1897. That meas
ure was declared unconstitutional upon grounds which
any law student could easily have evaded had he
given the subject a day's study.
What the committee now having in charge the con-
coction of a primary law should do is to put all its
work together and then employ a competent lawyer
for a reasonable fee to thoroughly examine and an
notate it. This lawyer should not be a practical poli
tician, but a man who stands high in his profession
and whose name and character will be guarantees that
he will conscientiously discharge the duty of inform
ing the committee what the law actually is.
This process might cost something, but it would
produce a bill which would probably stand the test of
the Supreme Court; or it would demonstrate that no
practicable statute can be framed under the constitu
tion â which is a point worth ascertaining.
No session of the Board of Education will ever be
complete without the appointment of a referee.
SETTLE THE CURRENCY NOW.
IN the. present confusion of glad sounds and the
touch of high spirit and feeling, there grows a
negative sentiment as to the need of completing
immediately the financial and currency reforms which
the country expects and to which the party in power
i* pledged. Men who have not in memory our recent
financial experiences, through having been outside
their influences, and politicians who are buoyant in
anticipation of great things to come out of our con
quests abroad, are saying that there is no need to do
anything with our finances. Meantime public' atten
tion and curiosity are directed to the regulation of
distant islands, and men are keeping tally of the new
offices created; the officers of the army are asking
Congress for 50,000 soldiers to keep order in Cuba,
while stability i> crystallizing there, and for an equal
number in the Philippines to domesticate civil free
dom among the Malays and mongrels. While our
Civil War was in progress wise men foresaw what
was to come through the emergency measures which
had financed the nation's struggle for life. The legal
tender had been degraded. The Government's prom
ise to pay had been imposed as a legal tender between
individuals. The operation of natural law had driven
specie out of the country. But the majority of our
people, occupied with the enthusiasms, the speculations
and the politics of the war, had no time to consider the
coming day of atonement for violated financial prin
ciples. That day came, however, and its conse
quences, its compromises, its makeshifts, its misfits
and complexities are with us yet. To their elimina
tion the attention of Congress is directed, by the re
pented pledges of the party, which the Fifty-sixth
Congress will represent by a majority in both
branches.
The immediate issues of our Spanish war will soon
pass. They will leave us with far higher taxes than
before, with the military spirit dominant in the Gov
ernment, with a great army and navy to support, and
ten dollars to spend "out of the treasury in governing
our conquests to one dollar that they will return to it
in revenue. W r hen those days come we will again
know by experiment the need of a sounder and safer
financial system. Borrowing money and spending it
is always easier than paying the debt at maturity.
Payday approaches. Why not fortify the country
now against the appeal that it will bring for further
financial debasement and discredit ? If the Fifty
sixth Congress do not give us the pledged reforms the
Fifty-seventh will not. If this be not done in a special
currency session, held in 1899, it will not be done in
the regular session of 1900.
The administration was stronger in 1898 than it will
be again. Faith in the intention of the Republican
party to redeem its pledges of 1896 and 1898 was
stranger in this year's campaign than it will be again.
The need of the redemption of those pledges will be
continually greater in the future than in the past.
Financial faults and disorders never correct them
selves. They never grow less. They never stand
still. They propagate like microbes in a culture pan.
The greater our commerce, the higher our taxes; the
more expansive our governmental responsibilities, the
greater the need of sound finance.
Napoleon found this out. He took France in the
midst of the wild financial theories of Robespierre and
Marat, who believed that a statute of the Assembly
could dethrone God and make something out of
nothing. His genius knew the existence of natural
law in finance, and he struggled with his Ministers
ar.d agents to get France on a sound basis. That this
was only partially accomplished by a makeshift which
htsted from 180.3 to 1876 was probably due to the with
drawal of the Emperor's attention from civil to mili
tr.ry affairs, made necessary by the marching 'of
France in the same path of military glory that is just
now so alluring to the American people.
Let us be warned by so many examples. Let us re
member that sound finance is a nation's only sure
foundation in peace or war; that it is always neces
sary, and that when it is not provided the people are
always paying the penalty.
This view is taken by the press of the Middle West.
The leading public men in those States, which have
been held in the Republican ranks only by the party's
sound money pledge, agree that there must be an
extra session of Congress for financial legislation,
and we are well assured that indifference to this now
will bring consequences of the most unpleasant na
ture.
STAMP TOX AMENDMENTS.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that a number of internal revenue officials have
suggested to Congressman Dingley the ad
visability of amending the stamp taxes in the war rev
enue bill so as to eradicate certain defects which ex
perience has shown to exist in the law. Whether Con
gress %v ill amend the tax during the short session is
doubtful, but it is fairly certain an effort will be made
in that direction, for the law as it stands is in some
respects unjust and in many particulars uncertain
and confusing.
Among the amendments proposed for the purpose
of making the law clearer are two of indisputable
merit. Cfne of these propos.es to amend the para
graph imposing I cent on telegraphic dispatches so
as to make it definite and certain who is to affix and
pay for the stampâ the telegraph company or the per
son who sends the dispatch. The other provides for
an equal definiteness of statement in the law as to
whether the shipper or the company shall pay for
the stamps required on freight and express receipts,
or bills of lading.
These two questions have caused a great deal of ir
ritation in the public mind by reason of the action of
the companies in shifting the burden of taxation upon
the public, a considerable litigation has resulted, and
possibly it may be long before the courts decide the
issue. It is not easy to sec how the language of the
law in this respect can be made much clearer than it
is, but since the corporations have been able to raise
a question on the subject, it would be just ar> well for
Congress to put an end to the controversy by amend
ing the law so as to declare in set terms that the cor
porations and not the already heavily taxed public
Shall be made to pay these taxes.
Other suggested amendments propose to remove
the stanip tax on mortgages on the ground that as
there is a tax on promissory notes, the mortgage tax
is double taxation and falls on the debtor class; to
strikeout the provision taxing brokers' notes or
memorandum of sale of goods or property of any
kind, the argument being that if brokers pay the
special tax required that should be sufficient; a re
peal of the tax on "certificates of any description re
quired by law," because o( the difficulty of determin
ing what certificates are taxable; and an amendment
of the paragraph relating to the tax on parlor and
sleeping car tickets so as to provide a penalty for
failure to affix the stamps, as it seems that under the
law as it stands no penalty is provided by reason of
the fact that the tax* is not imposed under schedule A,
where it properly belongs.
At the time of its enactment the tax was supposed
to be simply a temporary measure for raising a war
revenue. It now seems likely to remain on the statute
books for some years to come. It is therefore impor
tant that the defects naturally resulting from hasty
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1898.
legislation should be eradicated as soon as possible,
and there would be a good deal of gratification if.
Congress would .undertake the work of amendment
at the present session.
JUDGE AIfIGUIRE'S PLAINT.
JUDGE MAGUIRE'S letter to Father Yorke
confirms what has often been said concerning
Democratic politicians, namely, that with sin
gular fatuity they seek for the pause of their defeat
in fields and regions where the sane and well bal
anced never think of looking. Judge Maguire be
lieves, according to his letter, that Father Yorke de
feated him, that gentleman having influenced, he
says, 10,000 thoughtless and unreasoning Democrats
to vote against him on election day. He figures that
it required io.ooo votes to defeat him, and he places
the reverend father's following at just that number.
For the purpose of reaching this conclusion, Judge
Maguire ignores all the facts of the late election and
every scrap of phenomena by which its results may be
explained. He thinks that no one voted against him
on account of his free silver tendencies, rior because
he is a single taxer, nor because his political advance
ment is a menace to property, nor because he was the
nominee of a convention which had been packed by a
San Francisco ring of bosses, nor because he is a
sham reformer and office-seeker. On the contrary,
every man of the 10,000 required to defeat him was
influenced by Father Yorke.
The weakness, if not imbecility, of these premises
becomes apparent the moment an attempt is made to
analyze them. Father Yorke opposed Mayor Phelan
as well as Judge Maguire and Dr. Clinton. Yet Mr.
Phelan carried San Francisco by as many votes as
Maguire lost it. Where were the 10,000 thoughtless
Democrats when the Mayor's name appeared upon
the ballot? Father Yorke's attack upon Maguire was
mild compared with that upon Phelan. In fact, as we
all know, he singled the latter out as an especial mark
for his shafts.
Reduced to its constituent particles, Judge Ma
guire's letter is the familiar yawp of the defeated poli
tician â the gasp of a "reformer" who can conceive no
motive for the opposition except a corrupt and un
worthy one, and no possible cause for disaster except
"fraud." No office-seeker of the Maguire type was
ever defeated by anything except "fraud." It is im
possible to imagine a people who would deliberately
shake Judge Maguire clear of the public udder. He
believes there was a frantic determination on the part
of the masses to give him another office, but that they
were defrauded by the timely but corrupt interference
of Father Yorke â a politician possessing a priest's in
fluence.
Crediting Judge Maguire with the common attri
bute of sincerity, this is all quite singular. It may be
that Father Yorke influenced a few people to vote
against the Democratic ticket, but it is out of all rea
son to assume that the number was 10,000. If that
number followed him. how is Phelan's triumph to be
explained? The truth is, Judge Maguire was de
feated because the people are tired of him; because
they are weary of Iris incessant hunger for an office;
because they have concluded that he is a sham re
former and a destroyer rather than a constructor of
public measures; because he is a single-taxer, a
faddist, a socialist, a disturber and a Democrat. Ma
guire could not have been elected had Yorke and all
his friends been active in his fight.
A VIGOROUS movement has been started in
New York to obtain from the Legislature
.some means of compelling the telephone
monopoly to abate its extortions in that State. The
agitation has become so considerable that the whole
East is affected by it, and the press of the neighboring
States is discussing the subject almost as earnestly as
that of New York itself.
For the purpose of showing the enormous profits
of the monopoly the New York Herald recently pub
lished an elaborate table giving in detail the balance
sheets of the company for the last eighteen years. By
this table it was shown that upon an investment of
but little more than $600,000 the Bell Telephone Com
pany has in eighteen years made a profit of more than
$43,000,000. The Philadelphia Ledger, in reviewing
the subject, reduces the detailed statement of the Her
ald to this summary:
Actual cash capital National Bell Tele
phone Company In 1879 . . Â« $110,000.00
Actual cash capital American Bell Tele
phone Company In ISBO 543,100.00
Present capital stock American Bell Tel
ephone Company, estimated, about 30,000,000.00
Price per share, last Quotations 280.00
Earnings of the Bell Company for eight
een years... 42,903,680.00
Average dividends Cabout) 18 per cent
Can pay dividends of 6 per cent on 90,000,000.00
Actual cost of a long distance telephone
in open market, lots of one dozen 7.50
Royalty exacted by Bell monopoly for
each instrument used in its exchanges,
per year 14.00
Cost of unlimited use of telephone to
business men in Detroit, where there is
competition * 36.00
Cost of unlimited use of telephone to
business men in New York, where there
is no competition 24^0.00
Expense account yearly of Bell Company
for protection 2,000,000.00
Contributions to two political committees
in New York, 1898 100,000.00
In this statement it will be noted that the expense
account includes $100,000 as "contributions to two po
litical committees in New York, 1898," and a further
item of $2,000,000 as yearly expenses for '"protec
tion." In the absence of any definite information as
to where and how the Herald obtained these figures,
the subject is one that invites legislative investigation,
and it is hardly likely the investigation will be con
fined to New York. If there is a monopoly in the
country paying out $2,000,000 anually for protection,
there are solons in more States than one who would
like to know where the money goes.
It is further to be noted that the monopoly that has
made such enormous profits upon its invested capital
is one of the corporations that has refused to pay the
taxes imposed upon it for war purposes and has
shifted them upon the public. Its avarice has degen
erated to a petty greed of the meanest kind, and it
has practiced petty larceny upon the pockets of its
patrons in every city in the Union. Under the cir
cumstances there will be a widespread interest in the
struggle in New York, and if the Legislature of that
State can devise some means of compelling the
monopoly to be honest with the public, the whole
country will re>oice and every State will profit by the
lesson.

It is time to quit trifling with the
thieves who get into public position
only to abuse it. Students of social
economy observe the spirit of discon
tent, the murmur of disapproval, and
prate 6f anarchy. They do not seem
to think for an instant of the long se
ries of robberies which the people have
patiently endured, of the mockery of
justice when the larcenists have be<>n
brought to bar; the possibility of pub
lic servants being less corrupt, as a
legitimate contribution to reform, does
not seem to occur to them. They only
moan that the citizens who pay the
taxes and see their money scattered by
a set of conscienceless rogues should
presume to demur in the only effective
way. The threat at Chicago was
enough, and happily so. It is far bet
ter that the rascals should have been
scared into decency than noosed into
it. I would not like to see the lamp
posts of San Francisco decorated with
the carcasses of members of the Board
of Education, and yet to be thus util
ized would serve some of the members
rightly. They have been false to jvery
trust, have sneered at justice, stripped
the schools of needed funds, leaving the
teachers to wait indefinitely for salary
and the children to shiver because there
is no coal to warm the buildings. Of
course, to hang them would be a tem
porary disgrace, but to tolerate them
and allow them to go unpunished would
be a permanent disgrace.
A gentleman writes from Santa Ma

Besides, I cannot discover that there is

Whether Spain has got into a frame
of mind to be grateful for the loss of
the Philippines is a question, but the
Inevitable second thought will bring
this about. Spain had learned to lean
too much upon its colonies. Instead of
developing its great home resources it
had chosen to squeeze the colonist, to his
distressful undoing, and its own. Spain
is big enough to assume a greater im
portance now than before, stripped of
its islands. Whether a stronger nation
than Spain can take these same islands
and not have occasion to repent of the
bargain remains to be seen, and gives
rise to natural doubt, but for Spain it
is a certainty the islands were a clog.
Spain should brace up now, and grow.
It has an area of 196,000 square
miles, a population of 17,000,000, while
France, with 204,000 square miles, has

be excuse for sending soldiers from
Spain to die in the tropics. They can
stay at home an^ cultivate the fields,

The Call editorial columns contain oc

There comes this week a long letter

Nor is it a certainty that the results

the swinish nations of the Old World

the natives attempt to control them the

is directly under divine control there
are many responsibilities from which
the brightest finite intelligences would

The choice of a calling is a difficult
matter to advise about. Much as in
getting married, the questioner listens,
and then marries whom he pleases, pro
vided she is willing and the old folks
consent. To become a newspaper man
one usually begins as a reporter. The
work is hard, the hours long, but as
compared with other work the pay is
good. But there are limitations well
defined and passed by few. The report
er has little time for domestic or social
life. He is exposed to many tempta
tions, and his proneness to waste his
salary is proverbial. In a few years he
is apt to get into a rut, and having done
so, only gets out by dying. There is an
army of men who have devoted years
to newspaper work, and who wonder, as
the first gray hairs appear, why they
ever began. It seems to them that had
they been farmers or architects, doc
tors, lawyers, preachers or carpenters
they would have had more to show for
their efforts. But in ail probability th,e

Opposition to Christian Science Is

whom life is sweet and whose mental
faculties have not been warped. When
a man acquires the smallpox he needs a
doctor, and with the microbes of fever

disease by a trustful attitude and an

Fifty-eight people who have reached
the age of 80 or above have lately been
telling: how. they happened to do it. The
outcome is as usual. Each of them has

some ascribing longevity to an abund

ate amount. The primary cause of long
life is, of course, a good constitution.
Beyond this it is impossible to explain,
for the result ts reached apparently by
opposite courses. Life Is In every phase

Somebody asks what sense there is in
the solemn declaration at the wedding
ceremony that the happy couple have
been made "man and wife." I cannot
discern a trace. The same legal pro

tainly makes of the other a husband,
and if he lacked the qualities of man
hood when he faced the official referee,
he still lacked them after the decision
had been handed down, the fine paid,
and the minister had kissed the bride.
The ridiculous side of the matter would
be made clear if some jolly tier of nup
tial knots were to pronounce the couple
"man and woman." However, the term
"man and wife" certainly demonstrates
there is a husband in the case, but it
seems a slight to the woman. She is
the important and by all odds the more
interesting figure in the combination.

As to the acquittal of Rosse'r, this pa
per has given editorial expression, to
which I have no inclination to take ex

young man deserved the gallows, for
there was no premeditation in his act,
but there was a feeling that he should
be punished. Ho..w/er, the trial was
turned Into a travesty and the verdict
was a shocking and cruel farce alike a
disgrace to the jury, the prosecution,
the defense, the great State of Califor
nia and a reproach to the court. But the
subject brings up a question heretofore
cursorily mentioned as to the province
of an attorney. Every man accused of
crime has a right to a fair hearing, al
though "the presumption of innocence
is almost necessarily a fraud. The very
fact of arrest on mere suspicion impairs
this presumption, and when the crimin
al act has been observed, utterly de
stroys it, leaving nothing to be decided
but the degree of guilt. That Rosser
killed Hilderbrand, and that the deed
was reprehensible, there was no doubt.
There is nothing in the statute nor in
common sense which could make It a
matter to be passed over. Yet it haa

other equipment of his calling the de
feat of the law, is not a good citizen,
and that he could with as little blame
have passed to the prisoner a file
wherewith to saw to liberty. I believe
a lawyer who wouM eteal the skull of a
murdered child for the purpose of con
cealing evidence should forever be dis
barred. The fraternity has sunk to a
low estate when it dams the current of

â¢
Became Prejudiced Against Her Son
in-Law. Barry Baldwin Jr.,
Through Reports of His
Dissolute Habits.
Through the filing of ai ssues
joined in the suit recently in-
Btituted by Mario V. Baldwin against Mrs.
Veronica C. Baird. and tl will k*>
to trial before Judge Hebbard on tl
Jnst. The case is one of unusual Inl
f r it Is a suit of daughter against
mother. Both are well known in the
s.ioial world, ar.d sensational revelations
ipected when In the legal arena the
opens for valuable propertj the

-. but which the mother strenuously
>
The plaintiff in the action is Barry Bald
win Jr., eldest son of the well-known and
popular ex-United States Marshal. Her
complaint was tiled in July of this year,
and tells a remarkable story of alleged
deception and abuse of confidence at the
hands ,of her mother. By way of intro
duction, Mrs. Baldwin avers that In April
of ISO 6 she was the owner ol -'-â â  shares
of the capital stock of the California Pow
der Works and 203 and a fraction shares
of the Sausallto Land and Ferry Com
pany, all of which stood in her name on
the books of the corporations named, and
are of the total value of about $40,00).
On the 21st of April. 1596, the stock was.
by Mrs. Balrd, it is alleged, transferred
on the books of the corporations named
from her daughter's name to her own
account. On this transfer the story hangs.
Prior to the transfer from the daugh
ter's to the mother's name the stock was
changed on the books of the corporations
from the maiden name of the plaintiff to
her married name. She indorsed the new
certificates of stock and gave thrm into
the hands of her mother for safe-keeping."
The indorsement and transfer were with
out consideration and made for the pur
poses set forth.
At the date of the indorsement and
transfer Mrs. Baldwin, the plaintiff, was
expecting 1 to become the mother of her
first- child. She had married against her
mother* wishes, who then and still enter
tains an intense prejudice against young
Barry Baldwin Jr. Not long before her
child was born, Mrs. Baldwin continues,
her mother constantly reminded her of
the danger to her life that would accom
] any the birth of her child, and urged
her to make such disposition of the stock
referred to as would, in the event of her
death, secure the same to her child, or
should the child die with its mother, to
her own brothers and mother.
In order to satisfy her mother and in
' the hope that she could reconcile her to
her marriage Mrs. Baldwin transferred
the property to Mrs. Balrd upon the- ex
press, trust that Mrs. Balrd was to hold
. the stock only until after the result of her
'-confinement should be known; if she
"should die, leaving a child surviving her.
to hold the same for the benefit of the
- child; if mother and child both- expired
* then to hold the stock for her own bene
fit and the benefit of her sons, but if Mrs.
.Bald will should survive confinement then
the stock was to be returned to her on
demand. .-â  . . â¢ -/'.-Â»~
When she yielded to her mother's re
quest, Mr?. Baldwin states that she was
but 20 years of age, ignorant of all busi
ness matters, ill and highly nervous and
worried, and it never occurred to her that
her mother would violate her trust. In
September of IS9C. the child was born,
Mrs. Baldwin survived, and as soon as
she recovered her health, requested her
mother to return the property. Mrs.
Bain! refused to reconvey the stocks,
however, and says that she will not, it
is alleged, unless her daughter casts off,
abandons and deserts her husband. Mrs.
Baldwin married her husband solely
through affection and she refuses to cast
him off. but appeals to the court to force
her mother to honor the trust which she
has violated.
In her answer Mrs. Baird denies the
major portion of her daughter's allega
tions. She admits that her daughter mar
ried against her will, but avers that she
never entertained any ill feeling or preju
dice against her son-in-law until such ill
feeling and prejudice were caused by a
ration on the part of her daughter
"that she had been roped in by thibse
Baldwins." and further by her own re
ports of her husband's misconduct and
other reports that young Baldwin was in
the habit of becoming intoxicated and
associating with lewd women. This one
admission that she opposed her daugh
ter's marriage is the only one made by
Mrs. Baird in answer to the complaint.
She denies that she ever reminded her
daughter of the dangers of confinement
and states that she gave her daughter
only such advice as a mother should give
> daughter under such circumstances.
Shf> further states that no trust provision
mpanled the transfer of the property,
but alleges that the stocks were given her
by her daughter as a gift nnd as such she
received them. In conclusion she asks
thru her daughter take nothing by her ac
tion and that she. the defendant, be given
judgment for her costs of suit.
Mrs. Baird 'a statement that her preju
dice against young Baldwin was caused
I>> her daughter's remark that "she had
oped In by those Baldwins" is a
unner of a bitter contest and society
anxiously awaits the outcome.

occasion of the trial in the Santa Barbara
channel. Irving M. Scott and all the Jap
anese officers sent here from Yokohama
were out on the Chltose and are very
much pleased with the way in which she
moved through the water.
The contract between the Japanese Gov
ernment and the Scotts calls for a speed
of 22M> knots, and it is thought the Chitose
| will make at least a knot better than that.
i She will probably have another warming
I up on the bay to-morrow and will then
Btart for Santa Barbara. She will jog
down the coast under easy steam and on
the tirst favorable day will have her race
I against time. Captain Goodall has taken
i the Charleston, San Francisco, Olympia
and Oregon over the course and beaten
time on each occasion and expects to do
it again with the Chitose.
A dispatch received by the Merchants'
Exchange yesterday states that the Aus
trian steamer Burma was ashore at Ka-
I lama on a sandy bottom. The Burma was
one of the Rosenfeld' fleet of colliers, but
I a few weeks ago was chartered to load
i wheat for St. Vincent (Cape Verde Is
j lands) for orders. She went from here to
i Portland, loaded and was on her way down
I the Columbia river to Astoria when she
went ashore. She is not thought to be in
any danger.
The transport Tacoma will probably gf>t
away for Manila with her load of mules
1 next Thursday. This will be her second
attempt, and it is thought she will reach
port with her live stock in safety. On
the last occasion her donkey boiler for
condensing purposes was not large enough
and the horses had to be landed at Hono
lulu, while the ship came back to San
Francisco for alterations. She has been
ready for some time, but it was discovered
at the last moment that the mules to go
cm h.-r were suffering 1 from supposed glan
ders. T>r. Plummer, the veterinary sur
geon, has received a supply of the" glan
ders' test from Chicago and tried it on the
mules at the Presidio yesterda;*. It takes
three days to run its course, and If it
should prove to be a fact that the mules
have not the glanders they will be put
aboard the Tacoma and the ship will get
away Thursday. If it should be found
that the animals have the disease the ship
will have to wait until another lot of ani
mals can be secured.
Two crowds of excursionists had a very
cold time of it on the bay yesterday. The

MESSRS. EPPINGER & CO.
One of the Leading Shipping and
Commission Firms of San
Francisco.
Among the shipping and commission
merchants of San Francisco the firm of
Eppinger & Co., located at 311 Califor
nia street, stands in the front rank. Its
extensive business necessitated the es
tablishment of a branch at Port
land last year, and a few months ago
another branch office was opened at
Tacoraa. Its business in the north is
increasing rapidly, and in the near fu
ture its operations will extend over the
entire coast and the principal points of
British Columbia.
The firm is composed of J. Eppinger.
H. Eppinger and B. Ettlinger. All are
natives of Germany and came to Cali
fornia about the year 1855. The Ep
pingers were engaged for years in mer
cantile pursuits in the interior, but in
1867 they organized the grain firm of
Eppinger & Co. at Dixon, which is ntill
in existence.
Messrs. Eppinger & Co. are perhaps
the largest exporters of wheat and
barley on the Pacific Coast, shipping
annually immense quanties of wheat to
the United Kingdom, France, Belgium,
Germany, Australia and South Africa,
and supplying the leading English malt
sters with the finest California
brewing barley, and locally supplying
the California brewers with choice
barley, and the flouring mills with the
different qualities of wheat which have
made California flour famous.
Commercially the rating of the firm
is of the highest. H. Epplnger, a mem
ber of the firm, â¢'- at the present time
president of the San Francisco Produce
Exchange and of the Merchants' Ex
change. The firm owns the Pacific
Coast warehouse at Port Costa, which
has a capacity of 50,000 tons, and at
which ships of any si%e may lie and
receive their full cargo.

Have to Stand His Trial Here.
A. L. Alvord. alias T. H. Allen, had a
warrant served upon him in the County

ing him with forgery. The complaint
was sworn to in Judge Joachimsen's court
yesterday by J. G. Howell Jr.
Alvord was arrested on November 20
by Detective Cody, as he was leaving San
Quentin after serving a term for forgery
committed in Los Angeles. He had been
indicted by the Grand-Jury on the Howell
forgery and was sent to the County Jail
Owing to some mistake in the indictment
Howell swore to the complaint yester-
December 18. 1596, Alvord induced How
ell, to whom he bore a letter of introduc
tion to indorse a forged draft on Phila
delphia for $200, which he presented at the
P'irst National Bank. Alvord -went to Los
Angeles before the forgery was discovered
and was arrested and sentenced there on
another charge of forgery.

ing to Pinkerton's agency, been in trouble
for years. While serving a term in tha.
penitentiary in Nebraska he was tha
leader in a jail break and thirteen pris
oners made their escape.

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1808.
â which he was backed down to 9 to 10 fa
voritism. Thorpe, on Napamax, took the
front position before the stand was
reached first time, and never appearing in
difficulties, the daughter of Maxim won
In easy fashion from the Baldwin repre
sentative, San Venado. Big things were
expected of Sardonic, but she ran disap
pointingly. The favorite never looked
dangerous.
The most unexpected upset of the after
noon was the defeat of "Kid" Weller's
highly touted colt, Don Quixote. He was
allotted top weight In the mile-and-a-six
teenth handicap, and with only Morinel
and Imp. Mistral to beat, the smart ones
thought it a cake-walk for him. At post
time 1 to 2 was not plentiful in the ring
against his name. Turner hustled him
to the front, and he galloped along nicely
In the lead until within three furlongs of
home, where the other two just sauntered
past him. In the run to the wire it was
easy for Morinel, which won in a gallop.
After the race it was reported that the
Don had split one of his hoofs, which ac
counted for his inglorious defeat. The
winner, excellently ridden by Spencer,
was 5 to 1 in the betting.
In the opening six furlong run for 2
year-olds, the crowd showed a marked
preference for Casdale, with Martin up,
sending him to the post favorite over
Horton. The latter colt got up to the
favorite at the head of the stretch, and
both outfooting and outgaining him, won
easily at the finish. The others were
beaten off.
The mile selling run, in which a noted
bunch of mud-larks were gathered, was
a lively betting affair. Though he has
shown to be no wonder, Pat Dunne's en
try, Tom Calvert, was the medium of
some extensive plunges, closing an 11 to
10 choice. Elidad and Prince Blazes came
in for considerable support, especially the
latter. Jonee, on Elidad, tried to make a
runaway race of it. but the Easterner
tired the last sixteenth, and was collared
by the favorite at the paddock. About
this time. Gray, astride Prince Blazes,
came with a rush and splitting the two
leaders, won a well-timed race by a neck.
The favorite downed Klidad a head for
the place. CJray's ride was a very pretty
piece of saddle work.
For the mile and a furlong hurdle
handicap, the Corrigan entries, Redding
ton and Ferrier coupled, held sway in the
betting. Ferrier proved a poor hurdler
and Reddinpton wns left at the post.
Granger, a 7 to 1 shot, ridden by Kerrin,
was prominent the entire distance, finally
winning with something to spare from
Major S, an outsider.
The final five-furlong scramble for 2
vear-olds was only a scamper for Jinks.
The filly was a 1 to 3 chance and won
with ridiculous ease from Roy Hooker.

INDOOR CYCLE
TOURNAMENT
Prominent Wheelmen
Will Assist.
IT WOULD HELP THE SPORT
OLYMPIC-BAY CITY BASEBALL
GAME TO-MORROW.
The Amalgamation of the Olympic
Wheelmen and Cyclers â Presi
dent Nippert Appoints
His Committeemen.
The announcement made exclusively In
The Call last Sunday that a syndicate of
sporting men wore completing arrange
ments for a big indoor cycling tourna
ment to be held in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion early next year awakened marked
interest around the clubs, and will have
j a good effect on the sport. The fact is
apparent that the absence of any race
meets has made the clubs and riders
rather sluggish, and few could be found
who would arouse pufflcipnt enthusiasm
I to get in and train a fortnight during the
Christmas holidays for the San Jose meet
jon January 2. for one day's racing. But
: the prospect of a week or fortnight's rac
' ing indoors shortly after that was just
I what they had been looking for, and the
San Jose club will benefit by the an
nouncement in the increased number of
entries at its meot on New Tear's day.
Emll Fahrbach, president of the Bay
! City Wheelmen, when interviewed by a
! Call reporter regarding the proposed in
! door tournament, said: "I think it is a
; splendid thing for the sport and hope that
I the racing men will encourage the pro
j moters by training hard and making the
, best showing they can at the meet. I
i understand they intend to put on ama
i teur, professional and long-distance pro
fessional events. That will give all
! kinds of racing men a chance, both local
I and foreign, and will afford the spec-ta
j tors a big variety. The trade, too, should
I lend a helping hand by exhibiting their
i wares, and I am sure they wi'.l find it
! much to ti.eir benefit to do so. By ait
'â  means put me down as being heartily in
: favor of the proposed indoor tournament,
; or any movement calculated to awaken
i interest in cycle racing."
The Olympic Wheelmen, too, are heart
ily in favor of MÂ« tournament idea. Cap
tain Loos said that the club had a large
number of racine men constantly in con
dition, and just aching for a chance to
' ride. The Olympics did not get much in
: the way of glory or prizes at the last in
â  door meet heid here, and they are
anxious for "revenge."
The programme as now forecast by a
' gentleman connected with the manage
ment of the proposed meet, is to put on
1 two weeks of racing, coupled with some
i other athletic sports in the center of the
track. One of these weeks wil be given
! over to the long-distance or "six-day "
; riders, who have recently boen competing
i in New York, including Cnampion Miller,
"Dutch" Waller. Pierce, Rice and the
! other twenty "pluggers." The second
week will be participated in by the short
distance cracks, including the beat East
ern professionals and local amateurs.
Taken altogether the programme is quite
alluring. . ,
The Cycle Clubs' Baseball league sched
ule will'end to-morrow with the game be
tween the Liay City Wheelmen and Olym
pic Club Wheelmen, and excitement is at
a fever heat between the two leading
clubs in the tournament. The Bay Cltys
have not lost a game, and are naturally
confident, while the Olympics,- with only
one defeat to their credit, hope to admin
inter the ilrst Bay City defeat themselves.
The possession of a valuable trophy don
ated by John A. Hammersmith of the
Olympic Club is dependent upon the re
suit A large number of tickets have been
distributed for the game by both clubs,
and each will have scores of rooters on
the grounds. The game will take place
to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock at the
Velodrome grounds. Baker and Fell
streets. -_
Every effort is being made by the new
board of directors of the Bay City Wheel
' men to increase the membership of the
' club and fifteen additions have been made
to the roll since December 1. The club's
; house committee is arranging a series of
: entertainments for the winter evenings,
! and one of these will come off Monday
i evening, December 2G. when a Christmas
tree party will be held, to be followed by
an Impromptu entertainment and smoker.
A special meeting of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen will be held next Tuesday
evening at the Olympic Club to vote on
the proposed consolidation of the Olympic
Club Wheelmen and the Olympic Cyclers.

MAKING A RIGHT-HANDED DRIVE.
The Cyclers are willing to join the Wheel
men if they are taken in as a body and
allowed equal representation on the di
rectorate. The Wheelmen wanted to take
them in by ballot, one by one, so as to
freeze out one or two whom they "had it
In for," and also did not -want to allow the
Cyclers any representation among the di
rectors. These have been the stumbling
blocks which the officers of the two or
ganizations have met, but the Wheelmen
have now decided to allow their members
to vote on the proposition In open meeting.
It 4s generally understood that a majority
of the members of the Wheelmen favor
the amalgamation, so that ft is likely to
pass, the only objection coming from Mul
len, Adams and a few of its officers, who
had scores to settleAvith the Cyclers.
The Bay City Wheelmen will enjoy a
banquet to-night at 6 o'clock at 419 Pine
street. Each member is privileged to in
vite a friend and the affair promises to be
exceedingly jolly. President Fahrbach
and ex-President Kerrigan will act as
toastmasters.
The Imperial Cyclinsr Club has dropped
out of the Associated Cycling Clubs. This
Is a sign of weakness, for generally when
a club is on the decline it first withdraws
from the association.
President Paul M. Nippert of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs has an
nounced the appointment of the follow
ing committeemen to serve for the com
ing year:

One more name is to be added to the
rights and privileges committee, also a
name Is expected from the Garden City
Wheelmen to act on the track racing and
record committee.
Everything- is progressing smoothly and
getting rapidly fn shape for the big meet
to ho given by the Garden City Wheelmen
at San Jose on January 2. A large num
ber of riders are out daily training hard
for the meet. As the track is of cement It
dries quickly, even after a particularly
damp or rainy night, and always presents
a ridffible surface. Hardy Downing and
Orlando Stevens of lowa, who are billed

A ROLL OF HONOR
FOR BRAVE FIREMEN
ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO
DEEDS OF GALLANTRY.
At the meeting of the Fire Commission
ers on Friday a communication was read
from Chief Sullivan as one of the trus
tees of the Scannell medal fund. He re
ferred to the fact that no record was kept
of those to whom the medals had been
presented or those recommended for the
medal. A fireman performed a heroic act
and his name was mentioned for the
medal, but afterward another nrer-.r.n
performed another act a little more he
roic than the first and he was presented
with the medal and the other was forgot
ten. He suggested that a roll of honor
be established on which the names of
those receiving the medal and otners
performing heroic acts should be in
scribed, .as it would be a stimulant to
duty and an encouragement to members
of the department to deeds of gallantry-
The Commissioners adopted the sugges
tion, and in future the roll of honor will
be established.
BALLOON RACE TO-DAY.
Two Experts Will Contest for the

for the championship of the Pacific
Coast will no doubt be the result. Mile.
Anita is better known through tha In

VICTORY FOR
THE LOCAL
GOLF TEAM
The Oaklanders Meet
Their Waterloo.
FIFTY UP IS THE SCORE
PRESIDIO LINKS PROVE HARP
FOR THE VISITORS.
San Francisco Representatives Boiled
Up an Overwhelming Score
Against Their Guests i"rom
Over the Water.
The second half of the first game In th<Â»
home and home match between the Oak
land and San Francisco golf clubs played
yesterday on the Presidio links resulted
in an overwhelming victory for the San
Francisco team. The match consisted of
two rounds, ten holes, and on neither
round did any of the Oakland team secure
so much as "one up" against his oppo
nent. The first half of the game was
played on Saturday, December 10, on the
Oakland links, and even on their own
counle the Oaklanders were able to score
only "two up" against the visitors. It
was, therefore, to be expected that when
the Oaklanders came to play on un
familiar links they would be beaten by
the home team. But neither visitors nor
hosts had expected so decisive a victory.
From start to finish the San Francisco
men played a stronger gameâ stronger In
every department, in driving, approaching
and putting.
The San Francisco team were 27 up on
the first round and Â» up on the second
round, making a grand total of 50 up on
the day's play. Deducting Oakland's two,
San Francisco is 48 up on the whole game.
And, inasmuch as it was agreed that the
ultimate possession of the cup shall de
pend not on games won but on the aggre
gate scores. San Francisco now has so
long a lead that It will be a difficult task
for the Oaklanders to equalize matters
The afternoon was bright and the lignt
good. The recent rain has made the turr
green and springy, so that the golfer can
make two rounds without fatigue. In tna
early part of the afternoon a moderate
northerly breeze blew across the links,
but as the day wore on the atmosphere
grew almost absolutely calm.
The San Francisco representatives wera
exactly the same as on the Oakland links
on December 10, but the Oakland team
contained three new man. the places or.

The visitors and the press were most
hospitably entertained in the clubhouse,
and the best feeling prevailed between
hosts and guests, victors and vanquished.
The second game will be played next
April, the first half on the Oakland link 3
and the second half on the Presidio
course. Should the Oaklanders succeed
in wiping off the big score that stands
against them a third game will be played,
on neutral grounds to determine the pos
session of the cup. It is a three-handled,
loving cup, and the San Francisco play
ers can gaze into the window of the jew

feel that they have a strong grip on two
of its three handles.

CONVICTS WHO
ARE INSANE
Proposed to Erect One
at Folsom.
THE LEGISLATURE WILL ACT
PRISON DIRECTORS AND LUNACY
COMMISSION INTERESTED.
Citations Issued to the Guardians of
Insane People to File Their
Reports, as Required
by Law.
An Important Joint meeting of the State
Board of Lunacy Commissioners and Pri
son Directors will be held next Friday at
Folsom. The purpose of the conference
Is to devise ways and means for the erec
tion of an institution in which criminal
and convict Insane may be confined.
Secretary John F. Carrere of the Insan
ity Commission and Warden Aull of Fol
eome Prison have been in consultation for
several days past and they expect to have
a mass of valuable information and facts
to present at the meeting for the guidance
of the two boards in the proposed move.
There is a nice distinction between the
criminal and the convict insane, but it ia
Intended to incarcerate both classes in
the Bame asylum. By criminal insane is
meant those -who have committed crime
hjkl escaped the penalty of the law by
successfully pleading Insanity as the
cause (7f their misdeeds. They are there
upon sent to an insane asylum. It Is pro
posed to eliminate that element by having
them sent to the new institution.
By convict Insane is meant those who
have become Insane in prison and the^o
will likewise be segregated.
At the meeting the two boards will com
plete plans for building quarters and a
biil will be prepared for presentation to
axt Legislature. According to War
don Aull an appropriation of $100,000 will
be asked for and this, it is said, will be
none too much.
Provision will be made for the admin
istration of the institution and the bill
will also carry with it an amendment to
th.-> Penal Code for the direct commitment
of criminal insane to. the new asylum.
The end of next year will probably see
the completion of the structure, which has
come to be an absolute necessity.
Secretary Carrere returned yesterday
frwn the Home for Feeble-Minded near
Glen Ellen, where he went to place
twenty unfortunates who had been taken
from the various asylums throughout the
State.
"The trip was uneventful," he said.
"As we neared Glen Ellen I got my
res to singing, and they were In an
dlngly merry frame of mind. They
; cd to like their new quarters very
much. As to the proposed new home for
criminal and convict Insane, we will take
such .steps as will be sure to bring about
the consummation of the idea. "We believe
that class of lunatics should be by them
selves, and as soon as everything is i
we will proceed to eradicate them from
the insane hospitals, just as we are now
at work segregating the feeble-min
"Another good work to bo accomplished
by the Board <>f Lunacy Commlssl
will be to compel guardians of estates of
insane persons to file a report of 'their
guardianship, with a statement of ar
<-.><ims. while the law require* that this
shall l>e don.- annually, it has never been
complied with. We propose to enforce
the law, and yesterday seventeen cita
tions were issued for these guardians to
appear before the Probate Court to pre
: ts. AYe do not accuse any
one of dishonesty, but the law is very
clear on the subject, and the insane ward
should have an assurance that his estate
is properly handled.
"The Pension Commissioners of the
United States are interested in this ques
tion. I know of a case where a man was
committed to the asylum for being Insane
Kome years ago. A certain saloon-keeper
was appointed his guardian. The man
draws an insanity pension of $50 a month
from the Government. Now I find that
the pensioner is not an inmate of any in
sane asylum but is working somewhere
in the northern part of the State. The
pension is drawn regularly every month
1 y the guardian, and we will inquire into
it. If the man is s;me enough to be at
large and able to work he is not entitled
to the pension."
POSTUM CEREAL.
OLD SAWS.
Old Proverbs Don't Always Hold
Good.
"Old saws are sometimes broken.
A man convinced against his will is of
his own opinion s' ill." I have seen
that badly smashed. A friend came in
to see me some time ago while I was
in bed with nervous prostration.
The physician had strictly forbidden
me to use coffee and I had tried a
little Postum Cereal Food Coffee,
but the way it was served it tasted so
flat that I broke the rules of the doctor
and occasionally drank a cup of coffee,
although each time I suffered for it.
During her conversation she asked me
why I didn't try Postum. "Oh," I
said, "I have tried that, but it's no
use. I can't drink it." She laughed
out loud and said, "Why, my dear,
you have been imposed upon. If you
once have Postum mad right you
will be in love with it from that time
on." I listened to her with little in-
terest and much incredulity, but she
kept on insisting.
Shortly after, when I recovered a
little, I was visiting a friend's house,
who asked me if I would like a cup of
Postum, and when it was served it
tasted no better than mine had, so you
gee I had, apparently, a most thorough
experience with the taste of Postum,
and I knew its taste to be decidedly
flat and insipid. -
However, I found for the good of my
health I must drink it, and so when I
got home and was a little stronger I
determined to see IL it could not be
made to taste bette/ I looked at the
package carefully and found that the
directions were very plain, that the
Postum must be allowed actual boiling
of at least fifteen minutes. I put
it on in cold water. It took about fif-
teen minutes before it commenced to
boil, then I allowed it to bubble and
boil fifteen minutes more, and after it
had settled I poured out a cup, which
certainly was as rich a dark brown
cup of coffee as I ever saw in my life,
and when cream and sugar were add-
ed I was amazed at the taFte.
"Eureka," I had found what I wanted.
From that time on you can Imagine I
knev/ to a certainty when it was served
at the table whether Postum had
boiled long enough or not. There
is as much difference as between night
and day. Postum underboiled is flat,
and boiled as it should be is one of the
most delicious beverages a woman
ever tasted. It is strange that people
try and try again, and make Postum
to BO slovenly a manner that they fail
to get the delicious flavor from it I,
of course, have no temptation to go
back to common coffee, for I have the
finest coffee twice a day, and find it
safe, pleasant, healthful and strength-
ening to the nerves.â Mrs. M. E. Love,

NEWS OF
THE MINES
I The most significant feature of the re
cent convention of the California Miners'
Association was the resolution requiring
the appointment of a special committee
to take in hand the broad question of the
â  conservation of the waters of the State.
: Some years ago, during the early stag- s ..f
i its career, the California Miners 1 Associa
1 tion launched the project of securing a |
department of the executive branch of
the Government which should be wholly'
devoted to all the interests of mines and
mining throughout the United States, thus
giving a Cabinet department to the in
dustry which adds nearly 11,000,000.000
worth of wealth a year to tho country.
This plan has grown in prestige year by
year and has become a national issue.
So strong and general is the movement
now that it seems likely that the mining
industry will get a Cabinet officer rather
than a mere bureau in the Interior De
partment or a 'bureau in the proposed new
; department of Commerce and Industry.
I Now the California Miners' Association
i has launched a still bigger idea, though
it is essentially a local one. It has at
tracted little attention from press and
people since the convention, but it is the
greatest scheme in the way of public en
terprise that has ever been suggested in
this State. It will receive much discus
i sion in the near future and it promises to
: become an important State as well as a
! "'rhisidea^is that of conserving by dams
and otherwise the waste waters of the
i State The resolution avers that nine
i tenths of the surface water of the
i State now runs to waste to the
I sea The recent drought- with its
j fine of 530,000,000 or so imposed on
California serves to command attention
! for the scheme of conserving for the pur
poses of mining, power and irrigation the
waters with which nature really abund
antly supplies the State. There must he
â  long discussion and an evolution of pub
' lie opinion in this line before anything
! practical comes of it, but it is bound to
: become in the near future one of the chief
! State issues, and the California Miners
1 Association must be now credited with
being the first agency to make this
palpable benefit an issue.
i The Butte County Miners' Association
i has given pleasing evidence of vitality
â  since the State Miners' convention. It
has not been the habit of any of the fif
1 teen county associations to meet soon
â  after the annual State convention or at
1 any other time than shortly before that
r oVting and mainly to elect delegates.
The Butto County Association met the
otht-r evening and "for one thing decided
to hold soon a miners' mass meeting in
! Oroville to stimulate Interest In the as
i sociation, to increase its membership and
I to whoop along the inchoate nlans for a
local activity on the part of the associa
tion which shall do something fur the
general mining interests of Butte County,
i It is planned to have some of the leading
members of the State executive commit
tee present from San Francisco and eles
where. The project of establishing a
county mining bureau and mineral cx
i hlbit was discussed among other plans.
i President O. W. Jasper appointed as the
executive committee W. F. Duncan Jr.,
George H. Evans, A. Ekman and H. P.
1 Stow. W. E. Duncan Sr., the secretary,
i resigned, but his resignation was not ac
cepted. Mr. Duncan has been the soul
and a good deal of the body of the Butte
County Association for several years,
and in times of apathy this well known
mine owner has hustled about and been
nearly the entire association. He was
mainly instrumental in getting up and
placing the Butte County exhibit at the
ate, Mining Fair, which ht personally
cared for during the exhibit, and what he
has accomplished in this and other ways
illustrates what one man of energy and
nubile spirit can do in a community in
which nearly everybody Jogs along in the
rU N^ow others have wakened up with an
imnu!=e to lay hold with an enterprising
public interest. This life on the part of the
Butte County Association and the plaus
for doing something directly to boom the
mining industry in that county, while be
coming a stronger support to the State
Association, are worthy of note.
Word was received here vest* rday stat
ing that the richest strike yet recorded

was made In the York mine at Downieville
a few days ago. The property has been

Nevada County has some extensive de
posits of copper ore, especially in the
vicinity of Spencerville. Hence it is in
teresting to our home readers to know
that there fs a great boom 'in copper
mining stocks, and Calumet and Hecla,
owned principally In Boston, is selling at
$650 a share. This is more than twice the
price which the stock commanded during
the copper boom of 1890, and other copper
stocks have advanced in the same pro
portion. On the present valuation of the
stock, the Calumet and Hecla is worth
$65,000,000. These facts are worth publish
ing, because California is full of promis
ing copper prospects, and also because our
best copper developments are passing into
the hands of foreign mining corporations,
C'alifornians appearing to be oblivious to
their value. It takes a long time for a
Californian to learn that the world's
greatest mines are copper properties. â
Nevada City Transcript.
A rich vein of ore has been encountered
in the Ydalpom mine at Copper City,
owned by Dr. S. Graham and Theodore
Popejoy. Assays made show an average
of fully $30 per ton. Large numbers of
prospectors are at present working in the
Copper City district, and as work is being
done in a systematic and intelligent man
ner some good development is expected as
a result.â Redding Searchlight.
Unusually rich rock has Deen struck in

Tuolumne Independent,
The Redding Free Press announces "a
fabulously rich strike" In the old Glad
stone mine in the French Gulch district,
In the western part of Shasta County.
This is one of the famous mines of that
part of the State. It was recently ac
quired after a season ot litigation by
John H. Walkotte, the former manager
of the property, who appears to report
that on further recent prospecting in the
mine a new ledge of quartz carrying high
value was discovered.
The Sierra Railroad is being rapidly ex
tended from Jamestown to Sonora, the
county seat of Tuolumne County, and it
is expected that the extension will bo
ready for traffic soon after the opening
of the new year. A considerable increase
in the rate of mining development and
a decrease in the cost of mining opera
tions should follow. The number of sim
ilar branch railroads which the mining
regions of California sadly need could be
numbered in dozens.
Many new mining properties along the
mother lode In this county are being de
veloped ami are showing up well. â Pla
cerviUe Democrat.
The season has arrived in the mountain
mining regions when miners go to thaw
ing blasting powder. The experience and
the wisdom related to this operation
would make a good sized and interesting
volume if properly set forth in type.
The proposed unwatering of the Corn
stock (Nevada) lode, which Is to be at
tempted in January next, is exciting the
deepest attention all over the world. A
great deal depends upon the attempt, for
if it is successful it will mean a resumption
of deep mining, which was abandoned on
the Comstoek years ago. It also means
the success or failure of a new departure
in the application of compressed air to
the water elevator system.
The hydraulic elevator to be used in
the drainage of the lode was especially
designed and manufactured for the pur
pose by the Rlsdon Iron and Locomotive
Works of San Francisco. The proposi
tion of employing a modification of the
water elevator system and combining
with it the application of compressed air
is an experiment which is of the deepest
interest tn hydraulic engineers every
where. The machine to be employed oc
cupies only 3x2 feet In the shaft, with a
height corresponding, or course, to the
bright to be pumped. The apparatus is
liuilt in guides, which are to be lowered in
sections of fifty feet. The pumping will
commence with the ninety-foot mark be
low the Sutro tunnel and when that depth
is unwatered the machine will be lowered
to the 140-foot mark. This performance
will be repeated until the lode has been
thoroughly drained.
The Evans hydraulic elevator will be
used for the purpose. It is maintained by
its builders that fully 10.000.0n0 gallons of
water will be ejected daily from the low
er levels. The magnitude of the work, the
low cost named in the contract and the
comparative novelty of the appliance in
otlon with that class or work all
tend to make the project one of general
Interest to mining men. The success of
the project will do much to stimulate
mining on the lode.

XMAS BARGAINS.
Pattosiens Cutting Prices on Every
thing.
Christmas week, and Pattosiene are out
with special Christmas bargains In fine
furniture and carpets and housefurnlsh-
Ings; fancy writing desks for ladies and
roll top desks for gentlemen, couches,
lounges, wardrobes, extension tables, fan
cy rockers, fancy tables, fancy cabinets
and fancy rugs; everything in the house
furnishing line; the newest and the best
goods in the market; all cut down one
third.
Pattosiens' bargains and Pattosiens'
business are the talk of the town. Pat
tosiens, the great price-cutters, carry the
confidence or the peopleâ the intelligent,
industrious massesâ and they get their
trade and their confidence because they
are cutting the prices.
The interest of the masses is Pattosiens'
interest, and hence it is that they spe
cially urge those who must make every
penny count to come to the big two-acra
store on Sixteenth and Mission streets
this week and get what they neod in the
furniture and house-furnishing line.
What Pattosiens have done is nothing to
what they are doing now; the reductions
they have made are nothing to the bar
gains they are giving now.
Pattosiens would direct your special at
tention to the bargains, the extraordinary
bargains, in fancy rockers of all kinds

Dow Steam Pump Works.
One of the manufacturing enterprises
of San Francisco which is very popular
with the mining men of California is
the Dow Steam Pump Works at 108-120
Beale street. The business of the works
has increased gradually so that it was
found necessary to increase its facilities
for manufacturing the various lines of
pumping machinery in which it is en
gaged.
There have been recently added up
to-date iron and brass foundries to the
establishment, so as to more perfectly
control and improve the line of castings
which this intricate class of machinery
demands.
This firm is now shipping its pumps
to China, Philippine Islands, Sumatra,
etc., etc., also equipping the larger
mines of the Pacific Coast and Mexico
with its station and sinking pumps. The
battleships and cruisers built on this
coast have been equipped with the Dow
pumps, Electrically operated pumping
plants constitute an important feature
of this firm's business, and during the
past year this class of pump has met
with an unusual demand.
Their horizontal and vertical electri
cal driven pumps are built for heads
from 100 to 1500 feet and capacities
from 25 gallons per minute upward. A
visit to the Dow Steam Pump Works,
108-120 Beale street, is always of. inter
est to mining men as well as athera in
terested in mining machinery.

RICH STRIKE
ON THE YUKON
IT'S COAL
Stored Sunshine Dug
in Arctic Night.
TUNNELS INTO BIG VEINS
FIRST COAL DEVELOPMENT IS
AMERICA'S.
The Alaska Commercial Company
Hears That the Mine Will
Produce 100 Tons a
Day Soon.
Coal mining has begun on the Upper
Yukon River near Circle City, not far
from the Klondike, and 100 tons a day are
promised for next summer. This Inter
esting development Is on the American
side, practically in the Arctic circle, and
hereafter coal will figure in the mineral
output of the Yukon country. This be
ginning seems to promise much for indus
trial operations in the Yukon, including
quartz mining, which must await power
and machinery. Visions of electric power
lines instantly arise.
The Alaska Commercial Company ap
pears to be the pioneer in actual produc
tion, though the big rival company has
secured coal properties in that region.
Some time ago the Alaska Company se
cured several coal prospects close to Cir
cle City and sent a coal expertâ VV. C.
Williamsâ to the place to develop the
property He reports a fine deposit of
coal the delivery of ninety-seven tons to
the steamers of the company for steam
making before the close of navigation,
and promises to have 3000 tons ready when
navigation opens next year.
The company here has received Mr.
Williams' report, dated September 26, to
Assistant Superintendent J. E. Hansen
at Dawson. It tells what the "Nation
River" coal mine is like. He writes in
part:
The present conditions are that the prospects
are looking favorable Cot developing Into a
mine The work bo far consists of two tun
nfls." No. 1 Is 97 feet long. In It wa* 27 feet
of clean coal averaging 6 feet thick. The vein
then "became troubled with a stratum of rock
or "horse " wedge shaped in the center of the
vein with about 3 feet of coal on each wall.
It finally diminished to a seam from 1 to 14
Inches thick, which Is a true leader to the
main vein. On September 12 I stoped this tun
nel and located a vein at a distance of 6 feet
above high water. It proved superior In all
respects the coal being of a stronger nature
Hnd mines much coarser, making it superior
for steaming purposes. The vein has been lo
cated In three places and there are indica
tions of another vein, which I intend to locate
1 No 1b the main opening and is a
much more favorable prospect than No. 1. The
vein is noarer the general strike of the pri
nnrv rock. The amount of coal mined and
delivered to steamers is about 97 tons. I in
tend mining 3000 tons, and If the vein Is con
tinuous and not pockety will have the mine
in shape to mine 100 tons a day next summer.
I will this winter work sixteen men at 18 a
day and board. I am prepared to push mat
ters as fast as possible.
Nothing is here said ofthe quality and
nature of the coal, but it is demonstrated
to be valuable for steam power in com
petition with wood cut alonp the river
banks. Yukon coal mining has thus made
a definite start. Leon Sloss thinks that
a coal supply will be valuable flâ t to
river steamer* but that the development
of an adequate supply will do much for
"If it turns out well, It will be worth aa
much as a gold mine/ says Mr, Sloss.

RESULT OF CARELESSNESS
MANAGKB MORGAN DEPLORES
AN UNLUCKY OVERSIGHT.
As&ertion Made That Salicylic Acid
la Not So Injurious as Sup
posed â Blackmail Sug
, ' gested.
The seizure and condemnation by Mexl
can wine inspectors of nearly three dozen,
barrels of cheap California claret wine on
account of its containing: salicylic acid
lias caused consternation amoug the
prominent wine makers <<( this State.
They believe that the publication of the
fact Will work a serious injury to the in
dustry that win take a long time to over
come and which dealers in the foreign ar
ticle will nut be slow to take ad
vantage of.
These are the facts: Frederick Navarre,
a commission merchant In the City of
Mexico, ordered -a carload of high grade
and young wines from li. .1. Woullaeott,
who j>!.i ed the ord< r with Cosmo Morgan,
the southern representative of the Cali
fornia AVine Association. The latter sent
to the home office in this city for the
poods, which consisted*Â©* thirty-five bar
â : cheap wines and twenty-three bar
of high t;t â  . :i cai load lot.
The agents in ti.>- Boutfa disclaimed any
onslbility for the sending of wines
charged with the arid complained of, and
â â 1 that i:' there was any blame it
laj wi'h those in the home office who seiu
,r to 1 in- i "its " ; Mexico.
P. T. Morgan, manager "i the California
Wine Association in this city, was seen
rday regarding the matter of respon
sibility. He was greatly disturbed and
made 'no , â  what had been don.-.
On the contrary, he acknowledged that a
â¢ mistake had been made in sending
away wii.es that had not been tested.
'We hav< lÂ«et->i punished enough by
what lias taken place," Bald he, "and the
easiest way is to tell the truth about the
MYuir. It is nil,- of the ruies of the asso
a t.t have <-",ir Inspector make
that comes iii from
â  nutty. In this '-ase the precaution
was ii"t taken and the wine, after coming
in from the country immediately was put
on the >ar. with the other high grade
â nines, without the usual test being made.
I suppose that it is true that there was
salicylic acid In the wine complained of,
for the Mexican Inspectors said there was.
and as it was destroyed we did not re
ceive a sample of it for a test. This wine
was a cheap lot for a cheap trade, and
the oversight. The use of this acid
In wine is not for the purpose of adultera
tion, but for preservation, i suppose that
the prower found that hf* wim
ginning to ferment and put the stuff Into
it to save It until it could be used. If
we had made the discovery the complaint
would never have been made, for our rule
Is to deal only In pure wines. We griatly
that this expose will injure the trade
â¢ State and give the enemies
ulifornia wines the weapon that they
io ready to use to hurt our industry."
In discussing the use of the acid In new
wines, Mr. Morgan did not attempt to

A GIRL GOES A-BURGLING,
Lizzie Franz. With the Assistance of Two
Younger Girls, Breaks Into the House
of a Neiohbor.
IJzzie Franz has the distinction of being the youngest female burglar
ever arrested by the police. She is only ]4 years of age, but she did the job
In a manner that would have done credit to a most experienced "knight
of the jimmy."
Lizzie keeps house for her father, a laborer living at 1207 -j Stevenson
street, her mother being dead. A flight of stairs leads up from the street
to her father's bouse and in the flat below lives Harry Farley and his fam
ily. A shed divides the Franz yard fom the Farley yard. Thursday after
noon while the Farley flat was unoccupied Lizzie got two little girls, Mamie
Fitzpatrlck, 7 years of age, and Llllle O'Brien, 6 years of age, to help her
to break Into and rob It. With the assistance of a chair they climbed over
the sited. Lizzie leading the way, and got into the Farley yard. Then Lizzie
forced open a reai window and climbed through it Into the Farley kitchen,
followed by the two other little girls.
They carried off two sheets, two pillow slips, a quantity of dishes, a silk
handkerchief, a watch chain, a pair of cuff buttons, a necktie, a quantity of
shells and other articles, besides several articles of Jewelry. The bureau
drawers had been ransacked and when the Parleys returned home the place
looked as if it had been stuck by a cyclone. Farley notified Policeman T.
C. Calnan, the officer on the beat, and Friday he started an investigation.
Lfzzie saw him talking to the two little girls who had been with her and
suspecting that he was after her she burned the sheets, pillow slips and
other inflammable articles In her father's stove, broke up the stolen dishes
in the yard *aici .-lipped out of the house with the jewelry. She went out to
the corner of Devisadero and Waller streets and hid the jewelry in the man
hole of the sewer there. By these means she imagined she had destroyed
all traces of her guilt.
Calnan arrest. -d her yesterday, and after talking to her she confessed
everything and told him where she had hidden the jewelry. Calnan took
her to Devisadero and Waller streets and she pointed out the manhole, and
the jewelry was recovered. She was then taken to the City Prison, where
owing to her youth, she was booked for "a public institution." She Is a big
girl for her age and looks more like is than 14. The two other girls will not
be arrested.

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1898.
there was a war on among wine dealers
and an attempt was made to injure one of
â¢the dealers by the claim that his use of
salicylic acid in his wines was injurious
to health, ihe service* of a well-known
chemist were secured by them, and when
he mad,- his report they dropped the mat
ter quickly. It was in substance that a
man would die of alcoholism lung before
the acid would do him injury Mr Mor
gan said that (here is mure' of this add
in one quart of beer than in live gallons
or wme. However, he does not offer this
as a defense for the mistake that has
, happened through the carelessness of the
association tester in passing the lot with
out the usual inspection.
r W -. J - Notchkiss. manager of the Cali
fornia Wine Makers' Corporation is also
much annoyed at what has happened in
M.xlco, not that it affects his institution
directly, but that the publicity of the ac
tion of the officials of Mexico "will work a
great injury to the industry in this State.
j He. too, states that the danger in putting
acid in new wines is more imaginary than
real. !!>â¢ referred to the report of a
wine expert in New Orlenasâ the best
market for Callfornla'.s cheap wine?â in
! which the chemist took the position that
; salicylic acid is not injurious to the hu
i man system. In fact, it is highly recom
mended for such complaints as rheuma
tism and kindred ailments. Mr. Hotch
kiss spoke of a recent investigation by
the pure food committee of the local
Board of Health, in which the gentlemen
stated that a certain quantity of this acid
is necessary for the preservation of
catsup to prevent fermentation, and they
claimed that its presence in tin's sauce Is
not injurious to the human system. Mr.
Hotchkiss also mentioned the presence of
salicylic acid in the beer that is imbibed
so freely, and said that one bottle of
Eastern beer contains more salicylic acid
than could be found in a gallon of the
cheapest of wines. He regards the move
on the part of the Mexican officials in the
light of an attempt to blackmail some
body, stating that when a little hush
! money is Wanted all these officials have
to do is to get tile wines examined ami
; hnd a trace of salicylic acid. This is not
' always difficult to do, as in shipping the
i young wines into the warmer country
' something is necessary to keep them from
! spoiling. In France ammonia is used
as freely as the acid complained of in this
i case, and not a few French preservatives
â  find their way into wines sent into this
I country, as well as Mexico.

CHINESE PEBJUIIERS.
Judge de Haven Puts Up the Bar 3
Against Hosts of Mongolian
Raiders.
I'nited States District Judge de Haven
renderpd an opinion yesterday which will
be gladly received by the friends of white
labor. It was in the case of Jew Wong
Loy, who sought to obtain admission to
the United States on the ground that he
was born In California. United States
Commissioner Heacock, before whom the
testimony was taken, refused to recom
mend the landing- of the applicant because
he did not believe the witnesses. Judge
de Haven's opinion upholds the recom
mendation of the Commissioner and adds:
"Congress has not enacted mat when
a person of Chinese descent claims to
have been born in the United States he
must establish such fact by testimony
of witnesses other than Chinese. This
omission cannot be supplied by the court,
and therefore Chinese persons are com
petent witnesses in cases of this char
acter, but their credibility is for the court
to determine, and in proceedings like this,
where only this class of witnesses testify
that a Chinese person applying for ad
mission was born in this city, unless the
court Is fully satisfied of the truth of such
testimony its finding should follow the
presumption that a Chinese person com
ing from China and seeking to land in the
United States is an alien and not a native
born citizen of this city."

PECULIAR POISONS
GENERATED IN THE HUMAN BODY.
The Result of Imperfect Digestion
of Food.
Every living thing, plant or animal,
contains within itself the germs of cer-
tain decay and death.
In the human body these germs of
disease and death (called by scientists
ptomaines), are ually the result of
imperfect digestion of food; the result
of indigestion or dyspepsia.
The stomach, from abuse, weakness,
does nc promptly and thoroughly di-
gest the food. The result is a heavy,
Eodden mass which ferme: ts (the first
process of decay), poisoning the food,
making it thin, weak, and lacking in
red corpuscles; poisoning the brain,
causing headaches and pain in the
eyes.
Bad digestion Irritates the heart,
causing palpitation and finally bring-
ing on disease of this very Important
organ.
Poor digestion poisons the kidneys
causing Bright's disease and diabetes.
And this is so because every organ"
every nerve depends upon the stomach
alone for nourishment and renewal
and weak digestion shows itself not
only in loss of appetite and flesh, but
In weak nerves and muddy complexion
The great English scientist, Huxley'
Bald the best start in life is a sound
stomach. Weak stomachs fail to di-
gest food properly, because they lack
the proper quantity of digestive acids
(lactic and hydrochloric) and pepto-
genic products; the most sensible rem-
edy in all cases of indigestion is to
t?ke, after each meal, one or two of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because
they supply in a pleasant, harmless
form all the elements that weak stom-
achs lack.
The regular use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will cure every form of
stomach trouble except cancer of the
stomach.
They increase flesh, insure pure
blood, strong nerves, a bright eye and
â¢clear complexion, because all these re-
sult only from wholesome food well
digested.
. Nearly all druggists sell Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, at 50 cents full-
sized package, or by mail by enclosing
price to Stuart Company, Marshall,
Mich., but ask your druggist first.

in three weeks from the first applica-

since enjoyed good health, and is nearly
80 years old. He never lost a meal or
an hour's sleep during the ten days'
treatment. His case is one of a large
number that I knew of your curine dur-
ing the many years that you had your
office in this cltv. I will be glad to an-
swer any inquiries from those inter-
ested in cancers. Trusting you are hav-
ing your usual wonderful success. I am

THE ALHAMBRA
ABOUT TO BE
DISPOSED OF
Orpheum Company
May Soon Own It.
NEGOTIATIONS NOW PENDING
SHORT HISTORY OF THE THEA
TER'S METEORIC CAREER.
Experience of a Number of Well-
Known Business Men Who Lost
Money by Entering Into
an Unknown Field.
Within the present month the Orpheum
management will probably add another
playhouse to its already large collection.
Negotiations have been in progress dur
ing the past week between Mr. Meyer
feldt of the Walter Orpheum Company
and A. Ruef, attorney for the stockhold
ers in the Alhambra Theater Company,
with a view to consummating a deal.
Deeds and other legal documents neces
sary to the transaction have been pre
pared and nothing remains but the signa
tures of the parties interested to close the
transfer. Sf
Mr. Meyerfeldt admitted that such ne
gotiations were pending, but was unable
to say what the Orpheum people intended
doing with the theater. He denied the
rumor that the company proposed to gain
possession of the Alhambra for the pur
pose of preventing vaudeville perform
ances being given In it.
The Alhambra"s life was a short but
meteoric one. Great expense was incur
red by the corporation that controlled it
to make it one of the prettiest and cozi
est playhouses in town. It was opened
on September 3, to a overflow house and
closed a month later to empty benches.
Thousands of dollars were lost in an en
deavor to outshine its nuted rival, but
with poor success.
William J. Rostetter, Koster & Bial's
leader of twelve years, was imported
from New York to handle the orchestra
and special agents were sent everywhere
to engage the best talent. Rosy induce
ments were offered "stars," and transpor
tation was telegraphed them. After ac
cepting engagements at the practically
unknown house, the fiigrhty "stars" were
deterred from filling them by stories of
empty houses from those of the profes
sion who had appeared there.
The dollars in the coffers of the corpo
ration dwindled and a halt was called.
"Abe" Ruef, whose one share gave him
the right to act as a director as well as
attorney, out of goodness of heart for
his unfortunate clients, came to their as
sistance with his own private funds.
Even the money expended by him could
not bring relief to the theater and on Oc
tober 23, a little over a month after its
initial performance, *the Alhambra closed
its doors.
The stnekhoMer? boast that on the
evening the theater closed over $4000 was
used in settling the salaries of artists and
employes. The Alhambra Theater Com
pany w.is incorporated with the following:
well-known business men of this city
as principal stockholders: S. J. Levy, T.
P. \Voodward. L. A. Rea. A. E. Oshorne,
N. Sles.Â«ing-er ami Dr. de Kan^t. Twenty
five thousand shares were disposed of at
$10 a share and a few hundred local resi
dents purchased stock.

CAPTAIN NETTXLS' NEMESIS.
Mrs. Elsie Williams and Myron
Azhderian Sentenced to Peni
tentiary.
L'nless the Supreme Court intervenes
Elsie Williams and Myron Azhderian,
convicted of having extorted money from
j Captain W. E. Nevills, the millionaire
! mine owner and vineyardist, must go to
the pentitentiary. Yesterday morning
Judge Cook refused to grant the prison
ers a new trial, and sentenced Mrs. \YII
j Hams to five years in San Quentin, while
I Azhderian was given a like term in Fol
j som.
When the Jury announced its verdict
j finding Mrs. Williams and Azhderian
: guilty it recommended the former to the
mercy of the court. Judge Cook refused
to consider the recommendation of the
, Jury, however, on the ground that she
j was equally as guilty as Azhderian, and
! he saw no reason why she should suffer
! less. An exception was taken to the order
denying a new trial, and ten days' stay
of execution was granted. In the mean
time an appeal will be taken to the Su
preme Court, and without doubt the pris
oners will remain in the jail of this coun
ty until that tribunal has finally passed
j upon the judgment of the lower court.
Court frequenters expected a sensation
| when Mrs. Williams, in obedience to an
order of court, stood up to receive sen-
I tence. In answer to the question of the
I court as to whether she had anything to
i pay beidxe sentence was passed, Mrs. Wil
liams mildly said:
"Nevills told me he would spend $100,000
to send me across the bay, and I guess he
has done it."
This closed the incident, and the crowd

A RATTLING GAME
ON CHRISTMAS DAYj
EIVAL ELEVENS TO BATTLE FOli
SUPREMACY.
Company H, L. C. C, and the Golden
Gates to Play at the Presidio
Athletic Grounds, Bain
or Shine.
On Christmas day two League of the
Cross Cadet teams will line up in a foot
ball game, which promises to be second
only In importance and interest to the
college game on Thanksgiving. The game
will be played at the Presidio Athletic
Grounds, and is scheduled to begin at 2
o'clock p. m.
The interest taken in this last gams
of the series exceeds that of 1897. The
members and friends of the organization
will attend in large numbers. Company
cries and articles of every description that
will make a noise are being prepared for
this auspicious day.
Company H's team has a splendid rec
ord of victories gained during '97 and the
present season. Its fine showing aerainst
the big Stanford team shortly before
Thanksgiving proved that its members
are clever exponents of the game.
Coach Cross of the cardinal team com
plimented the showing made by the league
representatives.
The Golden Gates, which at one time
played under the auspices of Company C,
has also a strong collection of players,
and its team work is admirable. Great
rivalry exists between the teams, and the
contest will be a stirring one. Both elev
ens are practicing daily with a view to
carrying uff a victory.
The Lf-ague of the Cross band will grace
the occasion and discourse music during
the game.
The line-up will be as follolws:

THE NATIONAL GUARD.
A Bill Will Be Offered in the Legisla
ture to Reorganize on the New
York Plan.
It has been practically determined to
allow those members of the National
Guard who were not accepted in the vol
unteer service to remain in their respec
tive companies without undergoing a
physical examination, as it was proposed
about two months ago they should. That
being the case it is thought that these,
with those new men who have been exam
ined, and the members of the First Cali
fornia Volunteers who it is expected will
return within ninety days, who may want
to return to the companies from which
they enlisted, there will be enough to
re-establish the First Regiment of In
fantry at its maximum strength. But
of this there Is no certainty, a& It Is not
known what percentage of the veterans
of Manila will want to again bear arms
for the State. As the matter stands at
this time, it looks very much as if noth
ing will be done until the volunteers re
turn.
There are many of our Natloal Guards
men, who, anxious to see their former
comrades in arms once more, are at a
loss to understand the statement attrib
uted to General Meikeljohn of the War
Denartment to the effect that the volun
teers cannot be returned to San Francisco
for want of transports on the Pacific side,
and that they will have to remain at Ma
nila until the transports which are to
carry the regulars to that point reach
there by way of the Suez Canal. This is
thought strange, when it is known that
the Indiana, Newport, Pennsylvania, Ohio
and other transports are idle in the bay
of Manila. Why those vessels are no"t
used in sending some of the men back to
this city is the mystery.
During the past week the board of sur
geons held a meeting to examine men for
the guard and they had but a very slim
attendance of candidates.
A petition has' been presented for the
organization of a troop of cavalry at Sac
ramento. There are sixty names on it.
A petition has also been presented for an
Infantry company to be located at Wood
land to take the place of Company F
At the approaching session of the Legis
lature there will be presented a bill look- i
ing to the reorganization of the guard
of this State on the lines of the law that I
was adopted a short time ago in the State
of New York. Should that be passed it I
will effect many changes, one of the prin
cipal ones being the reduction of staff
officers. In New York it was decided that
In the past the guard had been top heavy
with gold lace, stars and eagles and that
the need' of the guard was less show and
more of the practical.
A matter that will be strongly urged
will be that of the State owning its own
armories. It is claimed that the present
system of renting armories is a very ex
pensive one and that if the State should
decide to have its own places of rendez
vous for the soldiers, it would in the end
be a great saving and the money now
used for rents could be expended "to ad
vantage in other directions in connection
with the efficiency of the guard.
Wardens and Vestrymen Elected.

trymen of St. John's Episcopal Church

TALE OF A POODLE
AND A BACHELOR
A Most Touching Story of Madame Rosa
lie's Famous Pet Canine.
r\ BACHELOR and a poodleâ the oppressor and the oppressedâ
LA bo closely allied that the story of the bachelor is patchy and in-
P complete without the history of the poodle, and the result 13
* a tale of modern progress surpassing in splendor the wondrous
fabrication of Scheherezade, of Arabian Nights fame. The tale
dates back to the early fifties. Then the poodle was the sole and only
figure in the romance. The Bachelor is a latter-day adjunct.
On Washington street, the fashionable promenade of youthful
San Francisco, was situated the Rotisserie Parlsienne, where gour
mets most did congregate, to tickle their palate with Mme. Rosa
lie's excellent cuisine, the choice vintages of her cellar and incident
ally to feed her pet poodle with dainty tid-bits.
The Poodle soon became one of the sights of the fast-grrowinar
city. A visit to town was but a sorry and incomplete affair without
a call upon the Poodle, and in a short time his fame
became part and parcel of the establishment over which his
mistress presided. Those were busy days. Time was literally
money, and the time consumed in knotting up the United States
tongue to say Rotisserie Parisienne was just so many valuable mo
ments wasted. It was then that the sagacious Poodle asserted his
personality and tne high-toned establishment that he so graced was
referred to as the place where "the poodle dog" lived.
Years passed and Mme. Rosalie's, keeping in touch with the pro
gress of the times, moved up town, to "elegant quarters" on Bush
street, opposite the California Theater. The famous Poodle died,
and though his name became synonymous for all the good things that
the earth yields, no epitaph was written to his memory. Proprietors
came and went, but the "Poodle Dog" remained.
It is at this point that the Bachelorâ most finicky of mortals
made his appearance. He came on with a soliloquy in which he de
plored the little, unpretentious, wooden structure in which he was
obligedâ if he woulw dine wellâ to take his meals; demanded that
"iron stone china" give way to "Haviland," that his wine be poured
in finest crystal and his soup and vegetables be served in silver
dishes. The Bachelor's sentiments were the sentiments of the pro
gress of this fin de siecle, and again the "Poodle Dog" changed
quarters, this time moving into the heart of the city in a magnifi
cent brick building, especially erected for its use, designed by Wil
liam Mooser and son, a building where the tables are turned and the
Bachelor is King and the "Poodle Dog" a memory.
Yesterday the elegant establishment at the junction of Eddy and
Mason streets was thrown open to the public. The same proprietors,
Blanco and Brun, greeted their many patrons, the same chef con
cocted the dishes that have become famous throughout the land, but
otherwise everything was changed. Luxurious comfort replaced or
dinary ease, and artistic elegance, inartistic commonplaces.
The ground floor of the building is given over to the public res
taurantâand the poodle. It Is an artistic monument to the famed
canine, and his picture, done in oils, smiles down, in many ai.J various
poses, from the ceiling with its exquisite pictorial art achievement,
from above the brocade-upholstered wall panels, from the Moorish
lamp that lights the entrance, and even from the exquisite faience
that forms the entire restaurant table service. On the second floor
where the "private" diners will luxuriate in exquisite apartments,
covered with carpets from far Eastern looms, and with walls hung
with canvases from famous brushes, the poodle is in abeyance. Only
the spirit of him is over it all.
As in the dining room, so in the sumptuous banquet hall, in white
and gold and rose garlanded like a salon in the time of the great
Louis, Mme. Rosalie's do* is lost to sight. No poodle heads dis
turb the dainty symmetry of the walls, the grandeur of the music loft
nor the Oriental picturesqueness of the Japanese ladies' retiring room
with its wondrous Oriental furnishings and quaint hangings. In the
two middle floors the bachelor lords it all. That is where he reigns su
preme in "bachelor apartments" where none but he may tread and
where every allurement is spread to wean him gently from all
thought of matrimony. His suite is furnished in all the elegance that
art can suggest and money provide. Rare canvases adorn his
walls, choice bits of bric-a-brac are scattered about to woo his eye.
flowers bloom in his broad, low. richly-curtained He has
his piano and his telephone. In fact, all the Bachelor has to do is to
touch the button and the "Poodle Dog" does the rest.

The Celebrated Queen Trance Medium.
Every Hidden Mystery Revealed.
If marriage, sickness, deaths, changes, trav-
els, divorces, separations, , law suits, business
transactions, wills, deeds, mortgages, lost or
absent friends interest you, it you desire to De
more successful, If you desire to have your do-
mestic troubles removed, your lost love return-
ed, your bitterest enemies converted intostancn
friendsâ in a word, whatever may be your
troubles suspicions or desires, call on tnis
gifted woman and she will send you away
happier, wiser and bolder than ever before.
MRS. DR. A. D. HOWE
Has no rival in her profession and stands
without an equal before the public. Thou-
sands who visited her and tested her won-
derful power are singing her praise through-
out the land and is
Recognized by Press and Public Everywhere.
Egyptian Talismans and Their Power.
The genuine apply to either sex. They pos-
sess magnetic power that attracts; the
weaker power is irresistibly drawn to the
stronger. We all know that any magnetized
piece of eteel will pick up a needle or a knite
by the blade. The Egyptian Charm magne-
tizes the body and controls the mind of one
person to do the bidding of the other. The
lady or gentleman (as the case may be) hav-
ing the most magnetism will seek its affin-
ity, and while a lady may be able to draw
many gentlemen to her the one she loves win
remain distant. Why? Simply because she
has not sufficient magnetic power to draw
him to her.
THE MESMERIC CHARM
Supplies the power, and a epeedy union Is
the result. It is perfectly safe and harmless
in its workings. It causes happy marriages,
removes coldness and indifference between
husband and wife. Lovers find in the charm
a secret and confidential agency, working for
their mutual interests and producing results
so pleasing and gratifying they are profuse
In Its praise. Scores who have consulted
MRS. DR. A. D. HOWE
Consider her advice and assistance most val-
uable. She has made fortunes for many,
finding for them through her power of second
sight investments that returned them great
profit. Many married couples who heretofore
have quarreled and led miserable lives are
now united and living contented and nappy.
Drinking husbands have been reformed and
reclaimed and restored to their families. Ab-
sent friends have been found; wayward girls
have been shown the folly of their ways and
started in the path of obedience and duty,
and a moral reformation has restored their
social standing In their community. All
these things are of daily occurrence right in
the heart of a great city.
LETTERS COME POURING IN
From all parts of the world, involving ques-
tions of great import and complexity, and
every , reply Is most gratifying. To the
troubled and unhappy her advice is sooth-
ing and beneficial, giving them that peace of
mind that wealth nor power can produce.
Men of the world consult her upon matters
of business and speculation, snorting men
upon games of chance. Even ministers of the
gospel send for her wonderful Egyptian
Charm, and marvel at her power.
MRS.. DR. A. D. HOWE
Is the only clairvoyant in the Western World
who thoroughly understands the preparation
and working of the real Oriental Egyptian
Charms. Her truthful reading of the past,
present and future continues to be the source
of great pleasure and profit to all her many
patrons.
Come all who suffer and be healed; come all
speculators and be 'advised: come all lovers
and win your idol; come all broken-hearted
wives; come all who are in trouble and learn
to bless this wonderful medium, the greatest
prophetess now in America.
MRS. DR. A. D. HOWE
Should not be classed among the many cheap
pretenders who Infest the city and bring dis-
repute to the profession. Madame's parlors
are visited by business men of good repute,
anxious for reliable Information us to the out-
come of future Investments and by ladles of
high social standing.

which she has made are the talk of the whole

STARVING PEOPLE
APPEAL TO THE
STATE FOR AID
Pitiful Story of Destitution Comes
prom Loc^wood, Monterey
County.
Entire Families in the Con)n)unity Whose Only
Food for Months Has Been Shorts
and Bran.
Reports received by Governor Budd |
from the southern part of Monterey
County represent that the inhabitants
of that region of California are face to
face with a most distressing situation.
There can be no auestion that supplies
of food for the peuple are Immediately
required. There are other pressing
wants, such as seed and feed for cattle,
horses and poultry, but the Imperative
and immediate demand is nourishment
for the inhabitants themselves. The
story of the present destitution and im
pending distress Is told in the following
contribution to The Call:
LOCKWOOD MASS MEETING.
Editor Call: At a mass meeting held in
Lockwood Hall, Monterey County, De
cember 13, IS9&, to consider the necessities i
of this community and try and devise i
means of relief, the following business
was transacted, viz.:
Dr. Galbreth of Jolon was elected chair
man and Dr. J. A. Miller secretary. A pe
tition to the State Executive, numerously
signed, was presented and approved by
the meeting asking the Governor to devise
means for the Immediate and permanent
relief of our suffering citizens, after which
the following resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
Resolved, first. That we, inhabitants of
Southern Monterey County, Lockwood
P. 0., and surrounding country, in mass
meeting assembled, are. by the force of |
circumstances over which we have no j
control, compelled to recognize the fact i
that a painful amount of actual need is
prevailing in this part of our county,
caused by the long continued drought,
causing the utter failure of crops this last
year.
Resolved, second, That while we grate
fully recognize the efforts of our Super
visors and the noble work performed by
committees appointed in the county to aid
in relieving this unprecedented distress, j
we, with them, recognize their utter In- ;
ability to supply the needs of all. and as j
a consequence many of our worthy citi
zens must suffer unless aid is secured
more abundantly and that immediately..
Resolved, third. That as a consequence
this meeting deems it expedient to ap
point a committee of five of our citizens
to present this matter to the Executive I
of this State, with the hope that measures
may be devised to secure adequate, per
manent and immediate relief.
A committee was accordingly appointed,
consisting of William Ptnkerton, Pleyto;
J. A. Miller, M. D.. Lockwood; B. Wilison,
Lockwood; Dr. Galbreth, Jolon; Mr. Long
meyre, Lockwood.
It was then ordered that a small col
lection of 5 cents be taken to furnish sta
tionery for the committee. One dollar
was reaJized. The committee was In
structed to purchase the supplies from
parties in sympathy with this movement.
Dr. Miller then read an outline of a
letter to Governor Budd, which was
adopted as expressive of the sentiment of
the meeting. The following is a copy of
the letter referred to:
To His Excellency James Budd, Gov
ernor of California: We, your constitu
ents, residents of Monterey County, Cali
fornia, and citizens of the United States,
would respectfully present to your notice
the following facts, and invite your most
serious attention to the same, with the
hope that you. In your executive capacity,
may be able to devise some immediate^
rueana of relief.
It is well known that In this part of
Monterey County there has little or no
rain fallen since a year ago last Febru
ary, ar.d a scarcity of rain for several
years previous had caused a shortage of
crops, while this year we have had an
entire failure. As a result in many cases
feed, seed and family supplies are com
pletely exhausted and in many more are
marly so. Cattle, hogs and poultry have
been disposed of to meet our necessities,
while hundreds of cattle have died from
actual starvation.
Our poorest horses have been shot, our
next poorer have been turned out to shift
for themselves, while our best are eating
the last hay we have means to purchase.
Some are away to pasture and we have
no means to pay for the same or secure
their return. We have nothing left to dis
pose of. Our farms are mostly mortgaged
for all that can be raised on them, and
moneyed men and banks will loan no
money on unlncumbered real estate In this
part of the county.
Merchants cannot possiby carry this
vast concourse of people, as they cannot
buy on the long time required by these
consumers. The milling company will
furnish no feed or seed until it rains, and
then only on a crop and chattel mortgage,
which, if given, leaves the merchant with
out security and at once stops all family
supplies and the result must be inevitable
starvation. There are families in this
community who have lived for months on
bran and shorts; others who have lived for
weeks on bread and water and scores who
have had neither milk, butter, meat or
land. These must be supplied. We make
untold.
Local committees and county officials
are feeding hundreds, but hundreds more
lira In need who cannot be supplied, and
the worst ia yet to come. Hay for horses
and the few stock left, bran for milch
cows kept alive on moss, and for feed for
a lone pig or a few fowls which yet re
main, and family supplies of all kinds are
needed at once and must be had or the
most direful results must ensue.
These people are not spendthrifts nor
I paupers. They solicit no charity; they
simply ask for facilities by which to help
themselves; money or supplies at a rea
j sonable interest until they can secure re
1 turns or work at living: wages to keep soul
and body together. Others are old and in
lirm, tottering on the edge of the border
land. These must be supplied. We make
no suggestion as to methods; we simply '
present facts as they exist and leave your i
mature judgment to devise the immediate
, remedy. Should you deem it expedient
! to communicate with us for any further
! information address the undersigned, our
secretary.
By order of a maps meeting of citizens
held in Lockwood Hall December 13
J. A. MILLER, U. 8., M.D.,
Secretary.
Upon the receipt vi the foregoing
statement Governor Budd was inter
viewed. He had been advised that feed
for stock was very scarce in several
sections of the State, that many horses
and cattle have perished; and was also
informed that supplies of seed would
be necessary in order to enable the
farmers to put in another crop, but the
full measure of the distress was not
realized until he received the statement
from the destitute inhabitants of the
southern region of Monterey County.
The Governor is of the opinion that
there is nothing in the constitution to
prevent the extension of aid to the
farmers in distress. The subject had
already engaged his attention to the
extent that a recommendation was em- 1
bodied In his message so the Legisla
ture. Commenting on the situation, the
Governor said:
"The supplies necessary for the relief
of the people in that and other dis
tricts of the State should be provided
without appealing to other than the i
public spirited citizens of California for i
assistance. We should not appeal to !
other States or to the United States for i
aid. The Chambers of Commerce, the !
Hoards of Trade, Merchants' Associa- I
tior.s and wealthy citizens should con- '
tribute money and supplies to bridge '
over the distress until the Legislature
convenes. I understand that Claus :
Spreckels, John D. and Adolph Spreck- J

els have already made contributions to
the relief of the needy, and when the
facts are made known to the public
other progressive and liberal men of
the State will contribute to the good
cause."
Governor Budd did not cite the pro
vision of the constitution of the State
authorizing the Legislature to appro
priate money to purchase supplies and
seed for destitute farmers, but main
tained that if authority could be found
for appropriating $178,000 to support
horse racing at agricultural fairs, it
could be found for appropriating means
to save people from starvation.
"I am not prepared to say at this In
stant," continued the Governor, "just
how the Legislature should proceed to
furnish the adequate relief. It is my
purpose to give the subject earnest and
thorough consideration. I shall prob
ably supplement recommendations al
ready prepared for my message. lam
confident that the Legislature can meet
the emergency. The present duty is
to provide measures of immediate re
lief and that duty must be performed
by the prosperous people of the State.
We must not permit begging bureaus
to be established In the East to collect
money and supplies for the destitute
of California. We can take care of
the distress at home, but prompt action
is demanded."
TO FLUSH THE SEWERS.
Olympic Club Salt Watsr Pipes to Be
Made Use of as a Sanitary
Measure.
The Board of Health a few days ago
served notice upon Superintendent of
Streets Ambrose that owing to the scarc
ity of rain the sewers of the city wore
badly in need of flushing and requested
him to proceed at once with the work.
Mr. Ambrose replied that he would do
everything he could with the little cash
that is left him and at once set his men
at work.
Following the same Idea Mayor Phelan
raked up from the records the franchise,
granted the Olympic Club people and re
fers to it In the following letter to tho
Board of Health:
Gentlemen: I desire to call your nttentlon to
order No. 2492 of the Board of Supervisors,
granting the Olympic Club and its successors,
now the Olympic Salt Water Company, a fran
chise for salt water pumping, etc.. as follow*:
Subdivision 2. Whenever the Mayor, the Board
of Supervisors, the Board of Health, or In case
of fire, the Fire Department, shall determine
that it is for the interest and welfare uf the
people of this city and county to use the
water from said system for flushing sewers
(provided It Is not more than five times each
year), or extinguishing fires, it shall have the
right to do so free of charge; and said Olympic
Club shall, when required by this boaj-d or other
governing body, make connections with the
paid mains for the erection and use by the
city and county of hydrants at suitable loca
tions for the aforesaid purposes.
In Board of Supervisors, San Francisco, Feb
ruary 1, 1592.
OEO. H. SANDERSON, Mayor.
Approved February 1, 1592.
I would recommend to the board to devise a
plan by which the advantages accruing to the
city under this franchise may be used. Re

YOLO BRINGS
SUIT AGAINST
THE STATE
First of a Series of
Actions.
CLAIMS BACK COMMISSIONS
FEES DEMANDED FOR COLLEC
TION OF TAXES.
Firm of Sacramento Lawyers Obtains
Contracts From Boards of Sup
ervisors to Institute
Proceedings.
Si>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 17.â The first of
a series of suits affecting large sums of
money said to be due tne counties from
the State has been brought in Yolo
County, and others will, in a few days,
be instituted in Sacramento and forty
other counties of the State. Within the
past two months the law firms of
Devlin & Devlin of Sacramento and
Rodgers, Paterson & Slack of San
Francisco have been securing con
tracts from the Boards of Supervisors
of the various counties under which
they were authorized to bring suits
against the State, in the name of the
counties, for the recovery from the
State of back commissions. It has de
veloped that the claims are based on
certain laws which provide that the
Auditor, Assessor, Tax Collector and
Treasurer are entitled to commissions
and fees in connection with the collec
tion of the State taxes of the fiscal
years from 18y3 to 1898. In the case of
Yolo County alone these commissions
are set forth to aggregate $26,771 20.
It. T. Devlin, of Devlin & Devlin,
said to The Call correspondent with
reference to the suits:
"The counties make settlement with
the State between the 15th of December
and the Ist of January, each year. In
order to protect our rights we have in
stituted the present suits. In the case
of one county, Madera, the District At
torney has Instructed the State Con
troller to hold the money until the suit
has been determined. We are not pre
pared now to state our case to the
public. It would take us a whole day
to explain it to the courts, and it would
take a week to explain it so that the
general public would understand. We
do not know yet how much each coun
ty, or, in fact, any county, is entitled
to; that can only be determined after
we have tested in court the various
points that will arise in each case.
COUNTIES THAT WILL
SUE THE STATE
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 17.â William H.
Devlin, on behalf of the county of Marln,
filed a petition or affidavit for a writ of
mandate to-day, compelling State Con
troller Edward P. Colgan to pay the
county the sum of $19,314 42, overpaid taxes
for the fiscal years 1593-94, 1594-95, 1895-96,
1896-97. 1597-9 S. -.-- i\ ; V
SALINAS, Dec. 17.â The first step in a
Buit for the recovery of $26,841 33, alleged
to be due to the county of Monterey from
the State of California, was taken this
morning, when a petition was filed in tne
Superior Court for a writ of mandate
against E. P. Colgan, State Treasurer,
to compel the State to allow Monterey
County to retain the amount stated as
commissions, charges and fees collected
during certain years. This is one of the
many similar suits instituted in differ
ent counties under the authority of
Boards of Supervisors. â
SA.NTA CRUZ, Dec. 17.â The county
of Santa Cruz has begun suit against
State Controller Colgan to r<=-->yer $18,567
for commissions due for the collection of
State taxes. VÂ£j-^
JUDGE PATERSON
TALKS OF THE SUITS
Judge Van R Paterson of the firm of
Rodgers, Paterson & Slack made the
following statement regarding the
merits of the suits instituted by various
counties against the State for commis
sions for the collection of State taxes:
Some years ago the Legislature, in it 9
â wisdom, saw ttt to say to the several
counties of the State that if those coun
ties would collect revenues provided for
by the different statutes the State would
Day to them, the said counties and their
officers as commissions for the collection
of such revenues a certain percentage.
Accordingly the Legislature provided for
such commissions and fees, and that act
was followed by the various counties in
the collection of the revenues of the State
and the counties were allowed the com
missions provided for by that act in their
settlement with the Controller at each
annual settlement. . .
At a subsequent session or the Legisla
ture an attempt was made to do away
with the collection of these commissions
by the several counties. The counties
now claim that this attempt was inef
fectual; in other words, that the act pro
viding for compensation to the several
counties for the collection of State rev
enues has never been repealed.
It is contended that the act providing
for commlsisons has never been repealed,
and the attorneys repxesenting the coun
ties claim that upon a proper showing it
will be apparent that the counties are still
entitled to a credit for and on account of
commissions allowed to them by the orig
inal act. In support of their contention
counsel for the various counties have sev
eral grounds.
On Thursday last counsel representing
the counties claiming credit on account
of the act which has heretofore been sup
posed to be repealed presented to Con
troller Colgan claims representing one
million dollars. On account of the very
large amount claimed the Controller has
concluded that he will insist on a final
judgment by the Supreme Court of this
State. It is, therefore, the purpose of the
Controller, the Attorney General and the
counties to submit to the Supremo Court
at the earliest possible moment the ques
tion whether the claims are valid. There
will be a meeting of the Controller, the
Attorney General and the attorneys rep
resenting the claimants at Sacramento
un Wednesday next to consider what
should be done, with respect to a speedy
determination of the questions involved.
In order to protect the counties counsel
employed by them have prepared and
filed petitions for mandate requiring the
Controller to allow in settlement the re
spective amounts claimed to be due each.
As a test case counsel representing the
claimants will apply to the Supreme
Court for a mandate requiring the Con
troller in his settlement with Sutter Coun
ty to allow to the County Treasurer of
that county in settlement of the amount
due from it the commissions and fees
which that county is entitled to under the
law which it is claimed has never been
repealed.

"JUSTICE IS
DEAD IN SAN
FRANCISCO"
People's Verdict in the
Rosser Case.
THAT REMARKABLEACQUITTAL
CHIEF OF POLICE LEES IS DIS
HEARTENED.
Something Is Radically Wrong in the
Matter of the Drawing of
the Trial Juries, He
Says.
"Justice ie "dead in San Francisco," is
the general verdict, or rather the wail of
the people.
"She passed through many dangerous
crises," said one citizen, "and for some
inexplicable reason died in the Rosser
case."
"In a case, too," said another, "where
the defense was pitiful in its grasping at
straws and the blackness of that senseless
butchery overshadowed all."
"It was a wanton crime," a third man
said, "and the blood of the murdered
Hllderbrand cries in vain from the reek
ing soil of this lawless State."
"What jumble of justice, what dark
cabinet of hocus-pocus, what hideous
abort of reason," cried a fourth, "set red
handed Rosser freeâ free to go on his way
killing and rejoicing in the malignity of
his soul?"
"Rosser has a precedent of his own
now," said a prominent attorney, "and
has a peculiar law unto himself, so in
terpret twelve California good men and
true."
This is the tenor of the things people
are saying on the streets, and the words,
strong though they be, are inadequate to
express the deep dissatisfaction the pub
lic feels over the verdict that acquitted
the drunken, murderous soldier. Rosser,
a morose, Irascible, quarrelsome fellow,
feared by his comrades and shunned by
his officers when sober, and a furious
demon when in liquor, his usual condi
tion whenever in reach of the bottle, com
mitted an atrocious crime, came into
court with tfce pitiful plea that in some
low groggery somebody for some reason
or other drugged his whisky. The rarity
the absurdity and the stupidity of that
excuse is lost in tha brain-dulling amaze
ment that a jury could be found that
would listen to it without a bribe.
There are long, loud whispers that
Rosser's people were wealthy, and that
it flowed out In all directions, even in
that quarter of the compass where is
located the jury-box of Superior Court,
Department No. 6, but this hardly rises
to the importance of an accusation. It
is only a whisper. The public knew the
Judge of that court to be above the
shadow of a suspicious thought not to his
honor. So it gropes for a reason for
this unparalleled acquittal.
Chief of Police Lees sat in his office
yesterday, disconsolate over the verdict.
The crime had been committed before a
cloud of witnesses, the case of the people
was established ere the smpko of the mur
derer's revolver had floated away. At
least the cell-door of a long imprisonment
was open Just before Rosser. But the
Chief's plans all mlslayed, and the crimi
nal went free.
"It is distressing," almost moaned the
gray-headed Police Chief yesterday. "I
am disgusted with that result. The drug
ging Rosser got was the cheap whisky
ho lllled himself up on around the Bar
barv Coast saloons.
"Oh, I don't know who or what to
blame," he continued wearily, "but there
is something wrong with the jury busi
ness. We can't get the right kind of men
| when we want them. Mind you, I am not
I accusing any of those twelve men who
consider Rosser an innocent, misused
man. I am not swearing to any individual
complaints, but Rosser should at least
have gone to the State prison for a term
of years If not hung for his horrible crime.
It was the most senseless verdict that has
ever disgraced this city or the State. J
repeat, the method of drawing a jury
should be changed. Now when a jury is
discharged, by some blundering their
names get back in the box and they are
drawn out again. I know this to be true.
A man named Wilcox while serving in
the Becker case was actually drawn for
the Elsie Williams case and was also
drawn for another case at the same time.
There is too much carelessness in this
matter and a big leak somewhere. The
$2 fee system for criminal juries is bad.
It brings a class of chronic jurors around
the courtrooms. But I am too disheartened
to talk to-day. I was sure we could con
vict Rosser, bocause his guilt was so
manifest and his excuse so flimsy. But
we couldn't do it. Something is wrong, is
all wrong."
Extra Pay for Volunteers.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.âRepresenta
tive Hull, chairman of the House Com
mittee on Military Affairs, to-day Intro
duced a bill giving two months' extra
pay to volunteer troops recently serving
abroad, and a month for those serving at
home.
CAPTURED THE WATCHMAN.
Daring Bobbery of a Penney lvania
Mining Company's Safe.
CHESTER, Pa., Dec. 17.â Five men en
tered the Seaboard Oil Works this morn
ing, shot the watchman, Joseph Mitchell,
in the leg. bound his hands and feet and
blindfolded him. While one of the men
stood guard over the watchman the others
blew open the safe in the office. Taking
the contentsâ less than $100 â they made
their escape. The safe was wrecked and
the office badly damaged. A large amount
of money was received at the works yes
terday for the payment of the weekly
wages of the employes, but this fund was
lodged in a local bank for safe keeping.

A Full Five Days Treatment
of Professor Jules Laborde's Marve-

CALTHOS
SENT FREE TO MEN

Ho C. 0. D. or Deposit Scheme.
C.UTHOS is now recognized by all Intelli-
gent physicians as the only perfect. j>ermanent
and unfailing cure for Spermatorrhoea, Impo-
tency and Varlcocele yet discovered. It is a
preparation of the French scientist. Professor
Jules Laborde, the world's greatest specialist
In nervous diseases.
It waa Professor Laborde who first discov-
ered and proved to the satisfaction of the
French Academy by the record of 859 cases,
that these dread diseases are due to nervous
debility, and that no tre<.lment which failed
to recognize that fact and strike at the root
of the trouble could do more than give tem-
porary relief.
CALTHOS strikes at the root. It cures the
disease and removes the cause. It is the only
remedy known to science that will absolutely
cure nervous debility. It has for years been
used as a specific in the French and German
armies. It has a record of a vast number of
perfect cures in every part of Europe. It Is
duplicating its foreign success in this country.
It Is controlled in this country solely by The
Yon Mohl Co.. of Cincinnati, and Is sold under
their positive guarantee, signed and acknowl-
edged, that It will effect a perfect cure.
Every man who suffers from sexual weak-
ness, premature loss of strength and memory,
emissions, varicocele, shrunken parts, Impo-
tency, or any of the other awful results of
early abuses, excesses, or overwork and ner-
vous strain, can be cured If he will but avail
himself of the CALTHOS treatment.
The time to do so is now. Neither Calthos
nnr anything else on earth can cure you after
epilepsy sets in with the resulting consumption
and insarrity which follow naturally in the
train of nervous debility and sexual diseases.
So remarkable has been the success of CAL-
THOS and so certain Is The Yon Mohl Co. of

Jacobs is a tailor and runs a shop in the
Macdonough block. He left a small notice j
on his door, "Will be back in five mm- j
utes." tut he has failed to materialize j
since.
"I cannot stand this worry much long

E>&vid dues nut return to me soon I do not j
know what 1 shall do. Only a. day before
his departure we were looking for new
Quarters where we could have the shop
and living rooms together, and he did not ]
worried about anything.
"I admit Dave drank some, but he al
ways came home, and surely something
has g":.<: wrong or be would at least let
me hear from him, but not a word. He
was a good and k!nd husband, and if he
does not return soon I shall go mad. When

sure. If he would only come back I :
would willingly forgive him."

against the appointment of delegates to

"I think it a dangerous precedent to
have a Central Committee appoint dele
gates to a convention, or have a Central
Committee to appoint men who will ap
point delegates to a convention. I have
entire confidence In the present Republi

one of little political experience to see j
that four men on a City Central Commit- j

the entire convention by their selection as
delegates could perpetuate themselves In

nationsJJ'

MEMBRANES OF
LILLIAN'S HEAD
ALSO TAKES
Are More Important
Than the Skull.
THE DEFENSE IS CONFIDENT
DR. BUTEAU DISAPPROVES OF
SUCH METHODS.
Attorney Bennett Says the Testimony
of th 3 Prosecution Has
Fallen of Its Own
Weight.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Dec. 1.".
The opinion of leading attorney? is
that the taking of her skull from the
coffin of Lillian Brandes is not a punish
able offense within the meaning of the
statute. There is, however, a general
feeling that the ghastly action will preju
dice the case of the defendant Bra:
Attorney Benm-tt admits that it was
an ordinary way to proceed, and says that
there may be some criticism regarding
the surreptitious soanner in which the
skull was obtained. He is, however, per
fectly ready to defend his action, ai.
Clares that the section of the Penal Code
referring to body-snatching has no con
nection with this case.
Dr. Buteau, who was the leading wit
ness for the prosecution, was asked his
opinion of the transaction. He said:
"It is one that 1 do not care to criticize,
except in a general way. as I may have
an opinion. i will not for a moment hint
that there is any desire on the part of
the defense to tamper with the skull, but
this thought naturally suggests Itself: If
the defense intends to act in a perfectly
straightforward manner why did their
representative not appear at the autopsy
and then demand that the skull be pre
served for the benefit of the jury?
"It is a false idea to imagine that 1 and
the other reputable physicians who con
ducted the autopsy are anxious to make
out a case for the prosecution. We are
not. We attended that autopsy as experts,
and our sworn testimony is the result of
our conclusions. If the defense wanted
that skull there could have been no ob
jection to their taking it and having it
preserved for introduction as evidence,
but it certainly is not conducive to a feel
ing of confidence in the motive when the
skull Is abstracted under the conditions
attending the taking of the head of Lil
lian Brandes."
There has I me doubt as to
whether the i. I I head,
which are as vita! to the testimony as the
skull, were also taken, bul A.H
nett set all doubt at rest this
by saying that they took some mem
branes, he was i n many, but
;. :: that there were beneath the skull in
the coffin.
"When we t( ok the >k<\'.\ we took every
thing tht-re was in the gir:
bobou of i - VVe have
thess bow well 1, ari.l they will
not be touched till produced at th^" trial.
We anticipate no difficulty In proving that
it is the same skull, and that it has
kept In tbt- same condition as we found
it in th* coffin."

A NEW BELL RINGS
ON ST. LEANDER'S
PRESENTED BY PORTUGUESE
MEMBERS OF THE CHUECH.
The Old Bell Had Done Duty for a;
Quarter of a Century and Has
a History.
â¢ 1 Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 17.
To-morrow afternoon there will be a
::g at St. Leahder's Church at
ndro. The Porcug:ui?se members
of the congregation have been at work se
curing a new bell for the church, and
Father Santos has procured one of rare
wness. It wtighs nearly a thousand
.'>, and arrived at San Ltandro on
Monday. To-day it was plac-d ia the
tower.
To-morrow afternoon the beautiful and
elaborate ceremonies of blessing- the bed
will be conducted by Rev. Father O"Ma
honey, who has been specially delegated
to this duty by Archbishop Riordan. Rev.
Father Santos will deliver a sermon in
Portua .
The old bell of thÂ« church has done duly
for more than a quarter of a century, and
has a romantic history.
In the early days â¢ .ere arrived at Yerba
Buena an English trader. He bought up
all the bides on this side of the bay. The
Peralta brothers then owned all of this
county, and Don Ignacio Peralta. who re-
Bided on what is r.ov.- the Peachy place,
was a courteous and liberal entertainer,
but when it came down to business he
was of a very practical turn. The captain
of this British tmdi-ng vessel went to the
ranch of Don Ignacio", and after a few
days of entertainment they got down to
business. Ignacio drove a hard bargain,
and the trader left well pleased with his
treatment. When he reached his ship he
ordered the mate to take the ship's bell
on shore and present it to Don Ignacio.
The don hung the bell on the porch of
his residence, and there for years it tolled
the Angelus and calied the laborers in
from the field. When the church of St.
Leander was built Don Ignacio presented
the bell to the congregation. For the past
generation it has done duty in the church
tower, and to-morrow it will be rung for
the last time.
J'.hn M;Â«tsÂ«,n of San Lorenzo has pre-

DR. PIERCES REMEDIES
THE MAN TIT
WOMEN WRITE TO,
There's a man in Buffalo who has, :
without doubt, a larger number of
woman correspondents than any other
person, man or woman, in the entire
country. And yet not one in a thou-
sand of the women who write have ever
seen the man they write to. For after
all it's not the man they write to, but
the physician. There's no sex in medi-
cine. The physician with this exten-
sive correspondence is Dr. R. V. Pierce,
chief consulting physician of the In-
valids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, of
Buffalo, X. Y.
Undoubtedly pr. Pierce owes hi? '
great popularity nhidng women to his ,
many and wonderful cures of that class i
of diseases known as "female trouble?."
To the treatment and cure of these dis-
eases he has given over thirty years of
his professional life, and has estab-
lished himself as the specialist par ex- i
eellence in the treatment of diseases
peculiar to women.
The esteem in which Dr. Pierce is i
held by women is not to be wondered
at when It is known that in the thirty
years, and over, in which he has given â¢
attention to woman's diseases, he has, I
I
a
Dr. R. Y. Pierce and Some of the Prominent Specialists of His Staff.
aided by his staff of nearly a score of
experienced and skilled specialists,
treated over a half a million women,
and with such success that ninety-eight
out of every hundred treated have been
absolutely and altogether cured.
Doubtless there are other reasons
why multitudes of women consult Dr.
Pierce by letter and as not the least
among such reasons women would set
down the friendly, even fatherly ad-
vice which the age and experience of
Dr. Pierce enable him to give as sup-
plemental to the advice arid instruc-
tions of the physician. Women, also,
are not slow to remember that Dr.
Fierce, through his method of consul-
tation by correspondence, war. the first
physician to off^r them relief from the
unpleasant questions, the offensive ex-
examinations, and the local treatments
generally inseparable from the. treat-
ment of diseases of women by local
practitioners.
. Of course, Dr. Pierce has had many
imitators, who steal the terms which
his advertisements have made familiar,
to use them as their "catch-words,"
and so to draw the attention of women
in thsir direction. The most noticeable
feature of these imitations is that
women with dangerous diseases are
urged to consult by letter some one
who is not a physician. 1 and has neither
the educational ability nor the legal
right to treat disease. And sometimes
because it is impossible for the.*** ad-
vertisers to lay claim to the title of
physician, they raise a clamor of
"write to a woman." "Woman under-
stands woman," hoping, doubtless, by
this article to draw away attention
from the fact that they do not and can-
not offer the advice of a qualified phy-
sician.* But women are quick tÂ« see
that a woman unless educated in medi-
cine and qualified to practice, can give
no advice unon disease that would not
be liable to be as dangerous as the dis-
ease itself. For there is no place where
ignorance is so dangerous as when it
undertakes to meddle with a woman's
health. __
That claps of advertisers who raise
the cry of "write to a woman" are get-
ting to be known as "bearded women,"
because the "woman in the cnse" is a
mere figurehead, a stalking horse to

shelter the man who preys on woman's
confidence. An example of the pecu-
liarly preposterous claims made by
these people is found in the claim that
a "man cant understand a woman â
just because he is a man. ' The only
way in which this can be interpreted as
true is by accepting the statement in
its bare literalness as of man and
woman. But it is to be noticed that
there is a vast difference when you
qualify the terms man and woman by
the term physician. How ensv it would
be for such advertisers to say "write to
a woman physician because a man
physician cannot understand a woman,
just because he is a man. How easy
it would be to do this if the "woman"
who invites correspondence could or
dared write M. D. after her name, and
even then, how preposterous the state-
ment would remain. For two thou-
sand years the practice of medicine has
been entirely in the hands of men, as
it is in general to-day. Woman in
medicine is a new thing, so new that
she has not entered to any known ex-
tent into the fie'd of surgerj'. What-
ever any woman practitioner has
learned of medicine she must have
learned in schoois taught by men, and
from books written by men. What a
paradox, therefore, is presented in the
claim that the man who has taught
woman all she knows about medicine
does not know anything about medicine
himself.
Women who are educated in medicine
would be the first to laugh at su^h
statements. It's only the woman of the
advertisements, the "woman" for rev- ?
enue only, and who is not a physician, i
who can afford to make such amazing ;
and ridiculous claims.
But this side issue has led us some-
what afield from Dr. Pierce and his
great host of women correspondents. â¢
To these the doctor stands a sort of !
father confessor of things physical.
Every letter is read privately, answered ;
privately, and its contents guarded as
sacredly as becomes such confessions.
Ard as many women are naturalily
sensitive about their ailments, even the j
replies are mailed carefully and secure-
ly sealed in a perfectly plain envelope, j
without printing or advertising upon
it. that there may be no third party to
this correspondence.
Any sick woman can have the benefit j
of consultation by letter with Dr. !
Pierce absolutely without fee or charge !
of any kind. \
More than half a million invalid
women have been successfully treated ;
by Dr. Pierce, aided by his staff of .
skilled specialists, through the medium '
of . correspondence.' In this way dis-
agreeable questionings and abhorrent
examinations and "local treatments" ;
are avoided.
The world at large knows of Doctor j
Pierce, chiefly as the inventor of the j
two well-known remedies. Dr. Pierces \
Golden Medical Discovery and Doctor
Pierces Favorite Prescription. And it
Is probably < the case, that in general,
Dr. Pierces remedies are classed with 'â 
all the other "patent medicines," and
Dr. Pierce himself ranked with those
"doctors" whose degrees are purely
honorary or assumed, and no more '
stand for medical knowledge or experi- j
ence than the familiar title of "Major" !
in some sections of our country signifies j
that the bearer of It is familiar with |
siege and battle. Dr. Pierce does not j
belong to the class of doctors whose j
titles are by courtesy only. He is a
doctor by choice, a doctor by education. ]
a , doctor by practice and experience.
He is more than that, for, although
there a.re no official grades and ranks in j
the medical profession as in the mili- \
tary, which are marked by titles and i
by Â» chevrons, yet as.a man advances in j
the practice 01 medicine, as his krwÂ»wl- 1

edge becomes exact and certain, a? his
skill becomes developed and perfected,
BO he achieves rank among his fellows
and is held in honor by the public. Such
rank Dr. Pierce has achieved, and as a
specialist in the treatment of diseases
of women he stands at the head of his
profession in the United States.
Dr. Pierces remedies differ from most
medicines in the fact that they con-
tain no alcohol, whisky or other In-
toxicant and are absolutely free from
opium and every "ther narcotic drug.
For no other medicine prepared exclu-
sively for the use cf women, as is "Fa-
vorite Prescription," can such a claim
be truthfully made.
The difference between Dr. Pierces
establishment and all "patent medi-
cine" establishments is very remark-
able, and is apparent at one- t< every
person who has had the opportunity of
actually comparing Dr. Pierces labora-
tory with that of any other institution.
For instance, since Dr. Pierce has ad-
vertised to give free consultation by
letter, many have imitated the adver-
tisements and make an exactly similar
offer. Afl far as the advertisements go,
they make ju.-t as good a showing as
Dr. Pierce. But go to these other es-
tablishments and ask to see the "doc-
tor" who gives medical advice and
you'll find, nine times out of ten. that
there is no doctor connected with the
establishment. Where there is a doc-
tor he is probably some medical failure,
selling his professional title to the
medicin? firm for a small consideration.
Compare this with Dr. Plerce'B institu-
tion, the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, with its staff of nearly a
score of graduated and experienced
doctors, busy every day in actual prac-
tice, its great special laboratory and
dispensary, from which special medi-
cines and auxiliary treatment are sent
out daily to all parts of the country, its
hospital with its surgical and mechan-
ical appliances and operating rooms. la
such a comparison you see at a glance
that there is no institution equal to Dr.
Pirece's in the whole country: that for
any one else to offer what he offers is
to promise what cannot be performed;
that no other institution has equal
facilities for the treatment of chronio
diseases.
In the work of the World's Dis-
pensary and Invalids' Hotel and Surgi-
cal Institute there is real philanthropy
as well as real medical and surgical
skill. The best recognition of the phil-
anthropic aspect of this work comes
from the citizens of Buffalo, Dr.
Pierces home town, who elected him
State Senator and later gave him a seat
in Congress. From the latter position
Dr. Pierce resigned before the expira-
tion of his term. That he should prefer
to give up a high and honorable posi-
tion in the councils of the nation to
serve the sick is conclusive evidence of
his devotion to their interests and of
love for his profession. Perhaps we
can offer our readers no better sum-
ming up of Dr. Pierce and his work
than that of President Garfield, who
said, '"He is one of the best men in the
world, and he is at the head of one of
the best institutions in the world."

BOTKIN JURY
INVESTIGATED
BY THE POLICE
Sensational Rumors Were Circu
lated and Created Consterna
tion for the Prosecution.
Defendant, Overcome by the Ordeal of the
Trial, Is Attended by Physicians â De
fense Ready With Its Witnesses.
F"r a few hours yesterday there was
consternation in the camp of the prose
of Mrs. Cordelia Botkln.
The evidence that had been introduced
on Friday created a profound impression,
but it was widely rumored that certain
members of the jury had already ex
pressed opinions which could not and
would not be changed by evidence. This
BtartlinÃ' rumor was at once called to the
attention of the authorities, and an im
mediate investigation was made by the
police and other officers of the prosecu
tion.
The information that was taken to
police headquarters was very delinite and
ppeeific. It was claimed that at least two
and perhaps three of the jurors who have
been sworn to try Mrs. Botkin for murder
bad ..Iready expressed a judgment on the
merits of the case to some of their
friends. The information sermed to bear
the stamp of accuracy, ami the inqulry
p.t once follow'--!.
The Information was sifted to the bot
tom. The laxity with which the jury was
drawn seemed to give color to the report,
but the closest and most thorough investi
gation failed to reveal any verification.
No one who would say that a juror had
Fpoken to him could be found. The mem
bers of the jury, as a matter of course,
c^uld not be questioned. The police pur-
Fued their Investigations until they satis
fied themselves that there was nothing
of truth in the report. The affair for a
time created some excitement. If the re
port had been substantiated there is little
question that the matter would have been
called to the attention of the court.
The authorities are convinced now. how
ever, that the rep >rt, while warranting Im
mediate attention, had no substantial
foundation. When the case is resumed to
morrow morning the prosecution will pre-
F.-r.t its remaining witnesses. The of
ficers of thÂ© State expect to finish before
the day is over. Whether this is done or
not depends largely upon the defense and
the extent of the cross-examination. Miss
I^ivernash will be the first witness of th' 3
day, and if time remains during the ses
sion John P. Dunning will be the last.
It is anticipated that Miss I.ivernash
will be sharply cross-examined. "What
shall be done with Dunning is a matter
of conjecture. In reference to this, wit
;he defense is in a very peculiar sit
uation. A initiation of Dunning
that would tend to expose thoroughly the
character of his Intimacy with Mrs. Bot
kin would be on the same lines as the tes
timony already introduced by the prose
cution. Such evidence would be designed,
as the prosecution has planned it. to Bhow
the motive which it is alleged Mrs. Botkin
had for the crime for which she is ac-
The prosecution will also Introduce to
morr -irnony of three exp< i
handwriting to show that the anonymous
letters and the addresses on the box of
poisoned candy were written by Mrs.
Botkin. All of these experts agree that
the accused woman wrote all of the ltt
t'-r=. notes and the addresses. This tes
timony will be supplemented by the posi
tive assertions of -Mrs. Elmira Ruoff and
John I. Dunning to the same effect. Buth
of th- -â¢ people are familiar with the
handwriting of Mrs. Botkin and are con
vinced that their opinion is correct.
The defense does not intend to devote
much time, if any, to a discussion of pen
hip. The legal defenders of Mrs. Bot
kin maintain that expert testimony of this
character has no standing of value in a
court. Experts testify as they art- paid,
and it is claimed will do so for the side
in a controversy that pays them best.
IJttle effort will be made, therefore, to
combat the testimony of the experts. The
police have devoted a great deal of time
to this phase of the case.
Mrs. Botkin was ill enough yesterday to
require the services of a physician. The
mental strain of the trial has weighed
heavily upon her. Until Friday she ef-
fected an air of unconcern to disguise the
Buffering and distress she endured. On
Friday she could no longer conceal her
feelings and was visibly agitated during
the long ordeal in which her once closest

Raw Sore From Finger to Palm.
Physicians and Medicines No
Avail. Cured by Cuticura.
When my little boy was two years of age,
dry spots commenced to appear on different
parts of his body. Last winter it seemed to go
to his hands, and I was obliged to keep his
first three fingers done up all the time, as it
was a raw sore, beginning to extend down to-
ward the palm of the hand. We consulted three
different physicians, each a certain length of
time, to see a benefit of their medicines. I
think now, after using Cuticcra, that some
of the salves that I used did more injury than
good. A gentleman (who sat next to me In
church) asked me the matter with my boy's
hand. I took off one of the cloths and showed
him, he told me he had been in a hospital in
Boston, where for all skin diseases they used
Octicuila. Remedies. I immediately pur-
chased CrmcDitA Soap, Cdticura (oint-
ment) and Cdticuba Resolvent, put aside
what I had been nsiug, and began with them.

this winter it would break out again, but no,
it is all cured, and I have not had to have a

friend related the story that may have
such serious consequences. When Mrs.
Botkln returned to the Branch County
Jail she almost collapsed. She rallied,
however, and obtained rest during the
night. Yesterday morning her condition
was such that the services of a physician
were demanded and received. Later in
the day Mrs. Botkin recovered her cus
tomary spirits. Her sister and brother
in-law called and remained for some time
with her.
Unusual efforts were made to conceal
the fact of Mrs. Botkln'e illness. It was
denied that ehe had asked for a physician
or had been ill. The fact remained, how
ever, that she had seen a physician and
was ill. Second to the general interest
that exists In the prospective testimony
of Dunning Is the interest expressed in
the announcement that Mrs. Botkin will
take the stand. The accused woman in
tends to testify In her own behalf and to
make a general denial of the charges
against her. She will not attempt to deny
her relations with Dunning, as she has al
ready admitted them to a degree that re
quires no comment. She will not seek to
establish an alibi, as the conditions of the
case do not require such a defense, except
in reference to the purchase of the candy
and the handkerchief.
The testimony in reference to the pur
chase of the handkerchief at the City of
.Pans is perhaps the strongest single bit
of evidence against her. This the accused
woman will combat with every energy. In
reference to her other movements in this
city and in Stockton . Mrs. Botkin has ad
mitted as much as the prosecution has
proved. If Dunning declares that Mrs.
Botkin attempted to kill him she will, of
course, deny it. It will he her word
against his with the advantage on her
part that Dunning continued his rela
tions with her after the alleged attempt to
kill him.
LAWN TENNIS EXPERTS.
Several Brilliant Exhibition Games
Played on the Scott-Street
Courts Yesterday.
The exhibition games played yesterday
on the courts of the California Lawn Ten
nis Club proved very successful. There
was a large attendance of visitors, in
cluding many ladles and several gentle
men whose names are well known among
California lovers of lawn tennis. Among
the spectators were Mountford S. Wilson,
a former president of the club; A. H.
Small, a former champion, and Robert
Hooker, who used to play a strong game.
The play throughout the afternoon waa
brilliant, and J. Daily, the courtkeeper,
fur whose benefit the games were held,
Is to be congratulated.
The expected double match between the
Hardy brothers, holders of the double
championship of the Pacific Coast Lawn
Tennis Association, and the Whitney
brothers, did not take place, Samuel
Hardy not being able to come up from
Palo Alto; but Sumner Hardy, the ama
teur champion in singles, and J. Daily,
the professional champion, played two
splendid sets. There was plenty of bril
liant play on the part of both contestants,
Daily's placing and Hardy's crosscuts and
passing strokes being particularly notice
able. The match was won by "j. Daily
with a score of 7â5, Bâ6.8 â 6.

Adams won the tirst set but lost the next
two, the score being 2â6, Bâ ti and sâ o.
Both winners and losers volleyed splen
didly, and the winners played a particu
larly steady game.
Sumtu-r Hardy and George Whitney
beat R. N. Whitney and J. Daily, the
Bcore being 9â7, 7â5. R. Whitney drove
and smashed with great effect, Daily's
lobbing waa noteworthy and the winners
played a fine game at the net.

Vampires Defeated a Team of Sailors
at Golden Gate Yesterday.
The Vampire Association football team
played yesterday against a Mercantile
Marine eleven at Golden Gate and de
feated their opponents by a score of 4
goals to 1. After about fifteen minutes
of back-and-forth play the front line of
the Vampires ran the ball down the Held
and Coles scored a goal. Soon afterward
Baugh handled the ball, and the free kick
granted to the sailors resulted in a goal.
Score: Vampires 1 goal, sailors 1 goal.
Just before half time White scored a sec
ond goal for the Vampires from a pass
by Coles. Score: Vampires 2, Bailors 1.
In the second half the Vampires de

Fcore. The game thus ended with a score
of 4 for the Vampires and 1 for the sail

Tells of Her Prosperity.
Mayor E. D. Olmsted of Spokane, who
has been at the Palace for the past few
days, was one of the passengers on the
Australia, which sailed Tuesday for
Honolulu. In addition to being Spokane's
chief executive, Dr. Olmsted is presi

being one of her leading physicians. He

Burglars Again at Work.
The burglars are again becoming bold
in the residence portion of the city and
are operating without any apparent fear
of the police. A few weeks ago they
entered the house of J. B. Reinstein on
Elils street, near Van Ness avenue, but
were frightened away before any booty
was secured. A few nights later they paid
the same house another visit, but were
again frightened away. Mr. Reinsteln
has taken the precaution to carefully lock
up everything of value which must be
kept in the house over night.
The police are investigating the case
and feel confident that the work is done
by professional thieves.
