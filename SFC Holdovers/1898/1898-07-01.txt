PORT SAID, June 30.â The
steamer Isia de Luzon, laden
with coal, has joined Admiral Ca
mara's fleet in this harbor. The
San Ignacio de Loyola, also la
den with coal for the Spanish
squadron, arrived at this port to
day. The warships have, hppn
coaling from their own colliers
with their own crews, but the
Egyptian Government has now
f. rbtdtfeo further t: ;;:cnt
of coal in this habor. So far only
the torpedo-boat destroyers have
been supplied with coal from
transports. The Governor of
Port Said has also received in
structions from Cairo to request
Admiral Camara to withdraw his
fleet from here as soon as possi-
Die.
CAIRO, June 30.â 1t is officially an
nounced that Admiral Camara was no
tified to stop taking coal from the
Spanish colliors, and informed that he
must leave Port Said, whereupon the
Spaniards said their ships needed re
pairs, and began discharging coal and
material in order to repair.
NEW YORK, June 30.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Officials are convinced to
night that Admiral Camara's squadron
â will proceed to the Philippines. Al
though refused coal by the Egyptian
Government the Spanish admiral has
coaled some of his vessels from colliers
accompanying him, and he has also
paid tonnage dues and is preparing to
pass through the canal. Official infor
mation to this effect was received by
the State Department to-day from
Consular Age-nt Broadbent at Port
Said. Mr. Broadbent informed the de
partment that Admiral Camara had
paid $150,000 in bills on France, which
were accepted by the Canal Commis
sioners, and arrangements were being
made for the passage of his ships
through the canal. Mr. Broadbent and
the consular agent at Suez will do
everything possible to prevent the
Spanish ships from taking on supplies
In the canal or at Suez, and in fact
such action is forbidden by the canal
regulations.
The authorities believe that all the
Bhips will not be through the waterway
before next Monday. State Depart
ment officials read with interest the
Herald's dispatch from Port Said this
morning announcing the intention of
Camara to leave his three torpedo
boat destroyers brhin<3. As such action
â¢u'll materially weaken the strength of
his squadron naval experts express the
opinion that Camara will change his
mind and take the destroyers along, if
repairs to their machinery can be ef
fected. Ab the Spanish admiral has to
give the canal authorities full details
regarding his squadron this Govern
ment will be able to secure valuable in
formation regarding the number of his
ships, thp'r armament, condition and
number of troops on board. Agents of
this Government at Port Said are mak
ing a determined effort to learn Ca
mara's plans, his immediate destina
tion in the far east being particularly
desired. It is appreciated by the au
thorities that he will not at first pro
ceed to Manila, but will go either to
Iloilo, which " still in the possession of
the Spanish forces, or to some other
point where colliers are lying.
If not a prey to Rear Admiral Dewey's
men-of-war, Admiral Camara's fleet
will be the victim of the Eastern squad,
ron of Commodore Watson. I learned
to-day on excellent authority the mis
sion of the Eastern squadron has but
Blight reference to the bombardment of
the coast of Spain. Its primary duty
will be to follow Admiral Camara and
destroy his command, provided he shall
not have already met his fate at the
hands of the Asiatic squadron. The
task which is before Commodore Wat
fon is not to be lightly entered upon.

TO RUN ASHORE NEAR SAN JUAN
MADRID, June 30 â 2 P. M. â The Governor General of Porto Rico cables that the cargo of
provisions and material have been landed from the Spanish steamer Antonio Lopez, which was run
ashore at Salinas, near the entrance of the harbor of San Juan de Porto Rico, to escape the United
The Navy Departmont, at the instance
of the Naval War Board, is making all
preparations to provide the fleet with
an cimni" gu Fr i r or coal and fresh
meats, vegetables and Ice. The depart
ment has been informed that Rear Ad-
miral Sampson and Commodore. Watson
are arranging the details of the forma
tion of the .Eastern squadron, and it is
knc Â»vn thnt Sajiijis a is anxi jus th.it
Cervera's fleet shall be destroyed before
any other operations are attempted.
But the necessity ct overtaking Ca
mara's force, if possible, is so pressing
that the authorities are anxious to dis
patch the Eastern squadron after him
as promptly as possible. The advan
tage the American squadron will have
in making the trip is its ample supply
of coal. Each vessel "yiU probably take
on at Newport NewL v d supply sufficient
to take it to the Balearic Islands or
some other Spanish possession on the
other side of the Atlantic, one of which
will be seized, and under its lee the
men-of-war will take 7400 tons from
colliers, leaving in the holds of the lat
ter vessels more than 6000 tons.
"You can depend upon it," said an
official with whom I talked to-day, "an
attack upon the Spanish coast, if it is
made, will only be in the nature of a
diversion. The serious business before
Commodore Watson's command is the
capture or destruction of Admiral Ca
mara's fleet."
In accordance with instructions to
her commanding officer. Captain C. F.
Goodrich, the auxiliary cruiser St.
Louis is now on her way north to re
ceive armament, which will make her
the equal of the St. Paul. It has not
yet been definitely determined whether
to make the necessary alterations at
Philadelphia or Newport News, but the
former point will probably be selected
for the reason the materials have been
collected at Cramps' ship yard. The
Yale and Harvard are now serving as
troopships and may be required to con
tinue this duty until the troops now
operating against Santiago are trans
ported to Porto Rico. It is the inten
tion, however, that ultimately the four
American liners will be attached to a
squadron which will include a couple
of armor clads and a protected cruiser,
and which may be sent to Spain to
harass the enemy's commerce and pick
up any gunboats and torpedo boats
whi^h may attempt an attack, leaving
to Commodore Watson's squadron the
work of following Camara's squadron
and destroying it, provided it should
escape Rear Admiral Dewey. The St.
Louis, St. Paul, Yale and Harvard, by
reason of the.ir large steaming rad'i and
ability to store an immense amount of
<â¢ ial, would be just the vessels to at
tach to a squadron which It was desired
to keep at sea for a long time, as will
be necessary in operations against the
Spanish coast.
WASHINGTON, June 30.â 1t was an
nounced at the Navy Department this
afternoon that the Spanish Cadiz
squadron had paid the heavy Suez
canal tolls and was about to proceed
eastward through the canal. This
statement was probably erroneous in
view of the later reports io the press
indicating that the Spanish vessels
were stopping for repairs. The ad
vices only hastened preparations mak
ing for the departure of Commodore
Watson's eastward squadron. The
commodore has reported to the Navy
Department his arrival off Santiago
and is In consultation with Admiral
Sampson respecting the details of the
cruise, which it is expected $Mll occupy
four months, provided the war endures
that length of time. The delay to
which the Spaniards are,, subject at
Port Said will redound very greatly to
the advantage of Admiral Dewey. lf
Camara is still in reality bound for the
Philippines, for the Insure the arrival
of almost the whole of General Mer
rltt's military forces and almost cer
tainly of the cruiser Charleston and the
monitors Monterey and Monadnock be
fore the Spanish squadron could reach

Shatter Ready to Strike With
Sampson to Crush Linares
and Cervera.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1808, by Jamei Gordon Bennett.
GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEADQUARTERS, JUARAGUA, via Playa del Este, June
30. â Another notable achievement has been placed to the credit of the Rough Rid
ers, who under the direction of Sergeant Hallett Alsop Borrowe, who left the super
intendency of the Jersey Railroad to become a soldier, have dragged a heavy dyna
mite gun as far as Sevilla. This was a task requiring almost superhuman effort,
but Sergeant Borrowe's men went at it with great determination. Slowly they made
their way up the mountain paths, past the field upon which several of their com
panions fell last Friday, and on down to Sevilla. Great things are expected of them
# as the result of this successful effort. Sergeant Borrowe and his men will be de
pended upon to do destructive work when the attack on Santiago's defenses begins.
The Call gives this morning a consecutive account of the progress made around Santiago by
the American army of invasion since it landed one week ago yesterday.
This information was contained in a series of dispatches filed by The Call-Herald special cor
respondents from June 27 to June 29 and delayed in transmission.
General William R. Shafter, it will be seen from the news, has accomplished great results in
the seven days his men have been on Cuban soil. He has driven the Spaniards into their last
trench, the city of Santiago, and has placed his men in such positions that he can,, as he notified
Washington on Wednesday,, take the beleagured city in forty-eight hours.
The Call this morning is able to give the general features of the attack which the Americans
will make upon Santiago. Our forces will advance against the city in four directions, moving from
the northwest, the northeast, the east and southeast at the same time. It is General Shafter's plan
not only to take the city, but he intends to prevent General Linares' escape with his army. He has
formed plans by which he is confident of capturing the largest Spanish force in Eastern Cuba, and
by which he will also enable Admiral Sampson to capture the best vessels in the Spanish navy.
There were developments of the great
est importance at the east of Santiago
on Tuesday. General Shriter. after
careful consideration, ordered General
Kent to move with his troops to the
north. This order was carried out suc
cessfully, ?nd General Kent is now lo
cated at. El Caney. With General Gar
cia's Cuban forces he will press to the
north and west while General Wheeler
and General Lawton will fill the gap
which the advance of these troops will
make. Their places in turn will be taken
by detachments of the army now at
General Wheeler's headquarters at Se
villa, while the Rcugh Riders and some
of the regulars will press to the west
in the direction of Morro Castle.
Escape for General Linare. thus will
become impossible. He will be hemmed
in on all sides and completely at Shaf
ter's mercy. Less than half a mile now
separates the outposts of the two an â â¢
General Linares seems to have a
doned er.Lirely the aggressive policy he
formed just prior to the debarkation of
the American troops. Stolid and hope
less he waits General Shaftcr's on
slaught, determined to sell hii military
honor dearly. There is certain to be
fighting of a most desperate character
before the city can be taken.
General Shafter has deferred the as
sault in order to get all the artillery and
plenty of ammunition to the front. He
desires the battle to be decisive, so it

may end the campaign in that part of
the island.
Men and women, panic stricken, are
fleeing from Santiago to avoid the
storm of war which is about to break.
Many of these refugees have entered
the American lines. They estimate the
strength of the Spanish army at San
tiago from 8000 to 12,c00 men. They re
port a great scarcity of food in the city,
and assert that widespread terror exists
among the non-combatants, who dread
the horrors of a prolonged siege.
Admiral Cervera and General Linares,
according to the general belief in San
tiago, will allow the Americans to reap
as few benefits as possible from the cap
ture of the city. It is Admiral Cervera's
plan, according to the reports brought
by the refugees, to blow up his warships
the moment the Spanish flag is replaced
by the stars and stripes on Morro
Castle. General Linares, it is added, has
laid a plan to blow up the arsenal and
to destroy all the military stores.
General Linares on Monday issued a
proclamation to his soldiers declaring
a powerful Spanish fleet was on its way
with re-enforcements, exhorting hi 3
men to defend the city tenaciously until
the re-enforcements arrive. This pro
clamation, however, is regarded merely
as General Linares' method of trying to
keep up the courage of hi 3 men. Pri
vately Spanish officers are complaining
bitterly because General Blanco, as yet
menaced by no foe on land, has sent no
help to them.
Sixteen thousand American and Cu
ban troops now hold all the desirable
positions between Peluca and El
Caney, a distance of five miles. Gen
eral Garcia's men, barefoot, but game,
follow General Kent to the north. Gen
eral Wheeler's division, consisting of
two brigades of mounted cavalry, forms
the left, while General Lawton's division
and the Rough Riders are in the center.
Brigades commanded by Chaffee, Miles
and Van Home have taken positions a
short distance beyond Sevilla. To their
right is General Kent with brigades
commanded by Hawkins, Theaker and
Wykoff. Garcia and Castillo, with their
4000 Cubans, are advancing to take the
extreme right, while the brigades com
manded by Bates and Duffield will form
a reserve force. This is, the disposition
of the troops decided upon by General
Shaftex for the attack, and nearly all of
the regiments had taken their positions
by Tuesday night.
RECONNOITERING
ABOUT FIVE MILES
FROM SANTIAGO
GENERAL, LAWTON'S HEAD
QUARTERS. Five Miles East of San
tiago de Cuba, "Wednesday, June 29, 6
P. M. (via Kingston, Jamaica, Thurs
day, June 30).â American troops spent
yesterday in feeling for the enemy,
otherwise engaging in reconnaissances.
General Shatter in person, with a small
escort, went almost to Caney, a small
town five miles northeast of Santiago,
with which city it is connected by rail
road. Lieutenant Standing and a de
tail of Cuban and American sharp
shooters occupied a small hill northwest
of the American lines and looking di
rectly down on ooth Caney and Santi
ago. Caney now seems to hold only
about 300 Spanish troops. The small
number of troops now at Caney indi
cates that the Spaniards have practi
cally evacuated the place. Lieutenant
Standing was not molested during his
observation, though he passed through
a camp which twenty-four hours pre
viously had been occupied by a strong
Spanish outpost.
Corporal Hutch of Company D, Sev
enth United States Infantry, who, with
seven men, was cent out on outpost
duty two miles from Santiago yester
day morning, returned to- camp to-day.
They had repeatedly seen the Span
iards, who did not offer to molest them,
and the Americans spent the day as if
enjoying a picnic in the woods. The
corporal said that if he had with him
sufficient force, he could have brought
in forty Spanish prisoners.
The American officers generally ex
pect a movement to-day to capture
Caney, which is a short five miles
northeast of Santiago. This, however,
is not official. Such a move may draw
the Spaniards in force from Santiago,
but, in view of their previous retreats
whenever the army might have been
seriously harassed on the march, an ag
gressive move on the part of the Span
iards is considered unlikely.
AMERICAN TRANSPORTS
HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
AT MANILA MONDAY
HONGKONG, July I.â The Japanese
cruiser Matsushima arrived here to-day
from Manila, which port she left on the
afternoon of Monday, June 27.
She reports that the American trans
ports had not then arrived, and that
the situation v.-as unchanged. The
Spaniards continue to erect defenses,
and the insurgents are keeping their
position, which Is about 2000 yards from
the city.
Food is growing scarcer. The Mat
sushima reports also that when she
left Manila harbor there were five Ger
man and four British warships there.
RUMORS OF A GREAT
BATTLE AT SANTIAGO
Of Course, the Spaniards Claim a
Victory, but as Yet There Is
No Definite News.
MADRID, June 30.â A rumor ig in
circulation here to-night, though un
confirmed, that there has been a great
battle at Santiago de Cuba, resulting
in favor of the Spaniards.
NEW YORK, June 30.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: When I saw Secretary Al
ger at midnight he had not received
any confirmation of the press report
from Madrid that a battle had been
fought to-day at Santiago. The Secre
tary and other officials of the War De
patment believe it quite probable, how
ever, that there was flghtUig in the
neighborhood of Santiago, as the last
dispatch received from General Shafter,
dated yesterday, indicated that his
forces were gradually closing in on the
city and its defenses. They do not be
lieve that the general has yet attempt
ed to take the city, but they think It
probable there has been some prelim
inary skirmishing, resulting from Gen
eral Shafter attacking some Spanish
outposts at points that he wished to
occupy before making his attack upon
the city.

ALTARES, June 29, via Playa
del Este, June 30. â The unex
pected delay in getting the siege
artillery to the front has led to
the postponement of a general as
sault for two or three days. Hun
dreds of men are working to im
prove the roads, which have been
washed by the heavy rains, so
that wagons loaded with provi
sions and ammunition can be
transported. There is a~ proba
bility that the siege guns may be
carried to the railroad.
To-day a train was fitted up at
Altares and a company of infan
try placed on board. In com
mand of Captain Fitch the Engi
neer Corps steamed slowly along
in fear of torpedoes and crept
safely across the bridge which
spans Juraguasito Creek to
within three miles of Morro,
where it was ambushed by a small
force of Spanish infantry, which
fired on the train from the cha
parral that covers the bluff. The
engine was quickly reversed, and
ran back to Altares. A number
of Mauser bullets struck the
train, but no soldiers were in
jured. The expedition showed
that the roadbed was not under
mined and apparently opens a
quick method of advancing- the
heavy guns.

Kingston, Jamaica, June 30.)â The force

ity of Aguadores, four miles from San

task is completed the attack on Spain's

Shafter himself cannot say.
The troops can be moved -without
serious delay and are pushing forward
rapidly, but the movement of the pack

lery Is taxing the skill and endurance
of the officers and men to the utmost.
From Baiquirl, where the artillery was
landed, to the present point of concen
tration, the road runs through a tangle
of tropical underbrush, up and down
steep hillsides and over treacherous
swamp-bordered streams for a distance
of over twelve miles. Through this
continuous thicket the rear guard of
the army is cutting its way.
Engineers are at work leveling the
track and filling pits, while a large
force of volunteers and regulars with
axes, aided by Cubans with machetes,
are hacking down trees and clearing
out the brush. A few light guns have
already reached this port. The siege
guns are not yet within five miles of
the vanguard.
General Shafter left his ship to-day

SPANISH STEAMER
RUNS THE BLOCKADE
NEW TOKK, June 30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
Spanish steamer Villa Verde, which
left Vera Cruz, Mexico, on June 16.
bound ostensibly for San Domingo, has
succeeded in running the Cuban block
ade and landed a large cargo of sup
plies and provisions on the island. In
spite of the special vigilance of the
blockading fleet, it is now positively
known the Villa Verde landed its cargo
in Cuba. Captain Leris, one of the
most able Spanish mariners in Mexico,
boarded the steamer ostensibly as a
passenger, !>ut it is now known he as
sumed charge of the blockade runner,
and that Captain Presas acted as pilot.
Indications are that the Villa Verde
landed her cargo .ither at Batabano or
La Colma on the southern coast of
Cuba.
It is on this account that President
McKinley Issued his proclamation ex
tending the line of the blockade. In
addition to the cargo the steamer took
on board at Vera Cruz she is bHieved
to have received additional supplies for
the Spaniards which had previously
been Bent to Meyers Island.
''u.p.i. agents report that Spain has
a considerable force of agents at work
constantly in Mexico to secure aid for
Spain, and arrangements have been
made to equip blockade runners as
long as possible at Vera Cruz.

WASHINGTON, June 30.â Accurate
Information concerning the condition of
Kclward Marshall, a correspondent of
the New York Journal, who was Ee
riously wounded at the battle of Quas
ina, has been exceedingly difficult to
obtain.
In compliance with a request Secre
tary Alger cabled General Shafter
Tuesday, but received no reply until
late to-night, when the following mes
sage was received:
"PLATA DEL ESTE, Cuba, June

brother's wife, who is critically ill, and
himself left on the first train for New

General Shafter's dispatch show?
rtmt the men wounded at the battle of

IMPORTANT NEWS
FROM SHAFTER
It Is Believed the Navy Will Co-op
ergte WitJ) the Army in tfye
Attach oq Santiago.
Re-enforcen)ents to Be Kept Moving to Cuba
Until the Spaniards Are Vastly
Outnumbered.
WASHINGTON, June 30.â The situa
tion at the close of the day was de
scribed by Secretary Alger as being
such as to warrant him in entertaining
the expectation of important news at
any moment. There were two parties
to a battle, and it might be precipitat
ed by either side, and no one here knew
what the Spanish disposition was. Nor
is much more known respecting Gen
eral Shafter's plan of attack, although
in his messages of yesterday he indi
cated a purpose to move early on the
enemy, as shown by his declaration
that re-enforcements could not reach
him before he offered battle.
Secretary Alger was very much grati
fied when he learned to-day that direct
telegraphic communication had been
established between Washington and
General Shafter's headquarters at Si
boney. Heretofore all messages from
the general have been delayed twenty
four hours, owing to the necessity of
sending them across rough country to
reach the cable station. The loss of so
much time might be vital in case of
urgent need for re-enforcements, or of
ammunition and supplies.
The opinion is held here that the
navy will co-operate in the attack on
Santiago, and to that end part of Shaf
ter's force is to move immediately upon
Morro Castle to capture the forts and
to enable the naval launches to open
the gateway into the harbor by remov
ing the mines. The experience of the
vessels while in Guantanamo harbor in
pulling up the mines there is expected
to very much facilitate similar work at
Santiago.
No telegram came to the War De
partment to-day from General Shafter,
and the understanding here is that he
is employing his time to the best ad
vantage in taking forward his artillery
and making all ready for the final as
sault upon Santiago. It is not known
how far the Spanish re-enforcements
have advanced since yesterday, but
General Shafter has full knowledge at
their movements, and it is believed is
not likely to delay his attack until they
have strengthened the garrisons at
Santiago by uniting with Linares.
The second expedition from Tampa
to re-enforce Shafter appears to have
encountered almost as many difficul
ties as the original expedition in get
ting away. It was confidently expect
ed here that the start would be made
from Tampa last Monday, but one dif
ficulty after another has arisen to re
tard the movements, so that it was
with a feeling of relief that the news
came to the department from Tampa
that the flagship of the expedition, the
Hudson, had swung out into the stream
and was ready to lead the procession
of troops, which. It is believed by this
time, are under way, bound for Santia

Eligible as Chaplains in the
Army.
NEW YORK, June 30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Cardi
nal Gibbons was a caller at the White
House to-day. The Cardinal came sim
ply to urge the appointment of some of
the representatives of the Catholic
church as chaplains. He reminded the
President that in the long list of army
appointments recently made nearly all
the newly made chaplains had been
Protestants. The Cardinal made no
complaint, but he suggested there are
a number of good, brave priests in the
! Catholic church who are anxious and
1 willing to go to the front. He present
ed to the President a list of names from
I which it is expected several eligibles
may be selected.

THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY,
! ger, via steamer from Newport News,
â  reached him to- day on the Harvard,
i and the steamer Yale is expected at
1 Newport News day after to-morrow,
returning from her first trip with Duf
; field's soldiers to take more re-enforce
, ments, probably including Garretson's
j battalion.
The steamers will be further availed
I of in pursuance of Secretary Alger's
I intention to continue to dispatch re
: enforcement after re-enforcement to
; Shafter until he has an overpowering
force at his command. The Secretary
j believes that no ground is lost in this
I way, for if there is an overplus of
troops at -Santiago they can be easily
used elsewhere.
Major General Coppinger is not to go
to Santiago with any of these addition
lal force?. He is senior to General Shaf
j ter, and if sent to Santiago by virtue
â  of the army regulations would assume
' command of the army in front of that
! place. Therefore it is likely that he
| will be reserved for the command of
; the Porto Rican expedition.
The reports from Santiago as to re
connoitering parties and efforts of our
' ;flcers to take observations of the city
lead to the belief at the War Depart
; ment that a big balloon may be utilized
j by General Shafter as a means of sur
i veying Santiago and all the surround
ing country. General Greely, chief sig-
I nal officer, sent a complete balloon
I train with General Shafter's expedition,
; and it is now available for use on the
field if General Shafter desires this
mode of observation.
The War Department made public
i to-day the following telegram received
from General Shafter yesterday:
"PLATA DEL ESTE, June 28, 4:30
P. M. â Major General Miles, command
; ing army. Washington: Thanks for
[ congratulations. Affair was unimpor
tant. (Skirmish in which Rough Riders
participated.) Only 964 men engaged
on our side, but it was very decisive in
our favor, the enemy retreating precip
itately. The lack of cavalry only pre
vented their capture. Reports from
Spanish sources from Santiago say we
were beaten, but that we persisted in
fighting, and they were obliged to fall
back. I deeply regret the loss of bo
many brave men.
"I expect to take the place as aoon as
I git ready to move. Re-enforcements
will not reach me. The horses stood
1 the voyage well. Would like horses for
; Third Battalion officers of cavalry and
. Wood's Volunteers.
"Health and spirits of command ex
cellent. Began the embarkation of the
I command on Wednesday. Last of the
; troops and artillery landed to day.
; Have transferred from Aseradero, fifty
1 miles, 0000 troops of Garcia. All landed.
Have something over 4000 Cubans.
"Hope to send you favorable reports
soon. SHAFTER.
< "Major General U. S. V., Commanding."
General Shafter's reference to the
[ condition of the men and horses was
, brought out by an inquiry from Gene
; ral Miles, saying: "Telegraph condition
i of command, number of men, condition
I of men and horses and what you most
i need."
PENSION LIST OF
THE PRESENT WAR
So Far Fifty-Four Claims Have Been
Filed With Commissioner
Evans.
NEW YORK, June 30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald aays: Up to
the present time there have been fifty-*
four claims for pensions for men who
have died or who have been killed in
the Spanish war. Commissioner of Pen
sions Evans informs me that pensions
can be granted for deaths or disabili
ties incurred during the existing war
â without any special legislation on the
part of Congress. All such claims come
under the general pension laws. Of
the claims referred to thirty-seven were
; made by near relations of sailors who
| were killed by the destruction of the
[ battle-ship Maine. Only one of these
claims has as yet been allowed by the
Pension Office. This is the widow of
I Seaman W. F. Montfort, who was
j killed in Havana harbor by the destruc
| tion of the Maine. The other Maine
j claims have not been anted upon.

BUSINESS BEFORE
SENATE AND HOUSE
Bate of Tennessee and Tillman of
South Carolina Speak Against
Annexation.
WASHINGTON, June 30.â Late this af
ternoon the Senate cleared the legislative
decks for what may be the final action
upon the Hawaiian annexation resolu
tion. Through its action to-day the last
of the appropriation bills that has been
pe-ndlng in conference was disposed of
and was a law before midnight. After a
debate lasting three hours the Senate
finally receded from its amendments to
the sundry civil bill and adopted the con
ference report of the Indian appropriation
bill.
When the Hawaiian resolutions were
taken up Bate (D.) of Tennessee and Till
man (D.) of South Carolina addressed the
Senate. Tillman discussed the race prob
lem from the standpoint of a Southern
man and was characteristically vigorous
in his remarks.
GARCIA MAY BE
SENT BACK TO STOP
PANDO'S ADVANCE
PLATA DEL ESTE, June 28.-(Delayed
In transmission). â It is believed that Gen
eral Calixto Garcia, whose forces were
taken to the east In order to co-operate
with the United States army In the cap
ture of Santiago de Cuba, will be sent
back with 3000 of his men to stop the ad
vance of General Pando, the Spanish com
mander, who, with 7400 troops and a quan
tity of cattle, was reported at a point
seventy-one miles from Manzanlllo, go
ing east toward Santiago de Cuba.
PREPARING FOR ANNEXATION.
In Event of Favorable Action the
News Will Be Hurried to Hawaii.
WASHINGTON, June 30.â Hatch, the
Hawaiian Minister, spent some time In
conference with Mr. Moore, Acting Sec
retary of State, to-day, presumably with
reference to the method to be adopted of
putting inio effect In Hawaii the provi
sions of the pending annexation bill,
which is supposed to be approaching final
passage.
It Is desirable that the earliest possible
notice of tho iipprovai of the- annexation
bill be conveyed to Hawsui, so it is prob
able that, failing the presence in San
Francisco of one of the regular merchant
steamers about to clear for Honolulu, the
Government will charter some speedy ves
sel to hasten to .Honolulu with the offi
cial news. One reason for making haste
in this particular is the fact that the-
Hawaiian Congress must ratify the pro
visions of the annexation bill, and as the
present session of the Hawaiian Legis
lature will expire by limitation very soon,
It will be necessary to submit to all the
delays occasioned by the requirements of
the organic law as to the calling of an
extra session of the Legislature.
CHINESE DRIVEN AWAY.
Summary Action Taken by Miners of
Placer County.
SACRAMENTO, June 30.â A corre

work on a road which is being built from
Long Canyon to Soda Springs. Ail of the
miners except one went to the Mongo
lians' camp and told them they could not
work, and compelled them to leave. The
miners then returned, declaring that they
would not work for people employing
Chinese, They were paid off and the mine
is idle.
The man who would not go on strike
ran away and hid in the bushes, but was
caught and narrowly escaped lynching.
The Chinese were driven away with guns,
being forced down the canyon for two
miles.

REFUNDING
BATTLE ON
Renewed by the Morgan
Amendment.
CALIFORNIANS ON GUARD
CONGRESSMEN ARE LINED UP TO
WATCH PROGRESS.
General Deficiency Appropriations
May Be Delayed by the Rider
to the Bill Which Does Not
Belong to It.
Special DUpatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 30.
The old fight against refunding the
debts of the Pacific railroads has been
reopened by Morgan's amendment to the
deficiency appropriation bill, adopted by
the Senate yesterday. . When the bill
reached the House to-day Representative
Cannon of Illinois, chairman of the Ap
propriations Committee, according to
custom, moved the House to non-concur
in all the Senate amendments. He tooK
occasion to state, however, that he con
sidered the Pacific roads funding amend
ment a wise provision which should be
accepted.
Representative Maguire insisted upon
an agreement providing that whenever
the conference committee makes its re
port there shall be a separate vote and
reasonable time for debate on the Pacific
roads amendment.
Cannon said he thought this request
was reasonable and agreed to it, but
would not consent to fix a definite length
of time for debate to continue, saying
that this must depend upon circumstances
and be submitted to the judgment of the
house. An agreement in advance, he
said, might later prove very embarrass
ing.
Maguire said he was satisfied with Can
non's assurance, and the bill was ordered
to conference without further obje< tion.
The bill will probably be considered to
morrow, as it is understood both the War
and Navy Departments have sent an ur
gent request that these various defi
ciency appropriations be passed as noon
as possible. The urgency of these appro
priations may make it possible for the
California delegation to defeat the fund-
Ing amendment, for if there is no quorum
present at to-morrow's session Maguire
will raise this point, and will not with
draw it unless the Pacific roads amend
ment Is eliminated.
Magulre and DeVries. as woll as Castle
md Barlow, have been active to-day can
vassing the House In opposition to this
imendment. The Populists will be solidly
irrayed with the Democrats against it.
Representative Cooper of Wisconsin,
who has always rendered valuable assist
mce to the California delegation In oppos
ng refunding measures, denounces Mor
gan's amendment. He will cancel an en
gagement to deliver a Fourth of July
aration in Wisconsin, in order that ho
;nny tie uure to help the Californians.
Maguire said to-night: "I believe the
funding proposition 1 will not pass the
House. It certa.lnly cannot pass during
ihe present week, and I cannot imagine
:hat those in charge of the bill will be so
jnpatriofic as to delay the general de
ficiency appropriations, in order to carry
through a railroad refunding scheme
which bears absolutely no relation to the
Seficiency bill, and should never have
been attached to it. The deficiency bill
rontains more than J200.000.000 of war ap
propriations, and should be pased imme
iiately. It can and will be passed to-mor
row, without objection, if the Central Pa
:lflc incubus is stricken from it. The
managers on both House and Senate
sides fully understand this, and I believe
they will strike the objectionable provis
;on from the bill."

more out of curiosity than anything else^
and was very much surprised at the good!
results which followed their use. I had
often seen them advertised, but being a little
prejudiced against patent medicines I thought
they would do me no good. In future I
never want to be without them. I had been
troubled with indigestion and dyspepsia for
along time, and although I tried many kinds
of medicine, I never found anything really
to do me much good until I tried Ripans

Weekly Gall sl.so prlflarHOW SALISBURY'S
SENTIMENTS ARE
NOW CONSTRUED
Declared Pronouncement of
England's Partiality for the
United States.
It Is Now Disclosed That the Emperor of Ger
many Has Been Restrained by Chancellor
Hohenlohe.
LONDON, June 30.â Though on cas- i
Ual reading the Marquis of Salisbury's '
speech at the United Club last night
seems to have been an attempt to carry
water on both shoulders, the diplomatic
body here construes it as a pronounce
ment of Great Britain's partiality. |
There is no doubt the Premier intended
his remarks as a hint to the powers
that Great Britain is in sympathy with
the United States, and the intimation
to that effect was called forth by Ger
many's alleged attitude in the question
of th? Philippine Islands.
The declaration that the United
States is animated in the present war
"elevated philanthropy" is the
passage upon which stress is laid and
many people find a connection between
the Premier's speech and the recent
visit of Colonel John Bay, the United
States Embassador, who again con
ferred with the Marquis of Salisbury
yesterday.
In the course of another visit to-day
<'i!.>nt'l Hay officially informed the
Marquis of Salisbury of the blockade of .
the southern coast of Cuba. It is â 
known that the Spanish Embassador. j
fount Rascon, cabled the Marquis of j
Salisbury's speech to Madrid, although \
it could not have been a surprise to
him, as he recently informed a col
league tlKit he had unquestionable in
formation to the effect that there was
mi "ironclad alliance" between Great
Britain and the United States before
the war was begun.
A letter written by a Berlin diplomat
of the highest position asserts that it
is due to the German Cabinet to say
that Germany's attitude has been thus
far correct, that the Emperor of Ger
many was determined to interject him
self into the war between Spain and the
United States and that he has only
been restrain. >1 by the Imperial Chan
cellor, Prince Hohenlohe, with the Min
ister for Foreign Affairs, Baron yon
Bulow, from some step which the
United States would be obliged to re
sent.

FIERCE WINDS

Great Damage to Fruit
and Grain.
MANY WHEAT FIELDS RUINED
TREES STRIPPED OF ORANGES
AND PEARS.
Extent of the Loss to California Or
chardists and Farmers Cannot
Be Estimated at
Present.
Fpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
"WOODLAND, Cal., June 30.â The wind
storm last night and to-day was the
fiercest and most destructive for years.
One-half of the wheat crop was blown
out. During the storm last night a big
oak tree fell on the cookhouse at Boyer
Bros.' farm. Grand Island. Injuring the
Chinese cook so that he will die.
YUF.A CITY, June 30.â A severe north
wind began blowing last night. Consid
erable damage was done to fruit, much
of which was blown from the trees.
Grain was shelled out and broken down
with great loss. The wind Is subsiding
at present.
SACRAMENTO, June 30.â Reports have
been received that the heavy north wind
of last night did 25 per cent damage to
the fruit crops in this vicinity, but it Is be
lieved the reports are exaggerated.
STOCKTON, June 30.â Farmers in town
to-day report that grain is being injured
by the heavy wind which began las<t
night and eontinlied all day. The grain
is frady to harvest, and the ijale Is
threshing kernels from the head. The
extent r >t the damage cannot be estimated
at the present time.
BIGGS, June 30.â A forty-mile wind-
Btorm has been raging since sundown
yesterday, doing gr^at damage to shrub
bery, trees and the fruit and grain crops.
That is the way big men feel â men who are full of power and vim.
When the life's blood is circulating in every part of the system grandly
there is full joy ; there is full manly feeling ; there is pleasure in life.
This never can happen when organs are stunted or overworked. "Hud-
yan," the great remedio-treatment of the Hudsonian Institute, makes
weak men feel like kings. The tired muscles, the taxed b'adder or the
tired heart vanish where this great treatment is used. If you have
abused one single organ of your system by misuse or over-use (your
liver, perhaps, but no matter what), ask what "Hudyan'' has done for
other fooljjh men. It will cost you nothing, and the inforrration you
will get you would not sell for thousands of dollars. It is free, we say.
So is medical advice, no matter what you suffer from. Why not get
wh3t you can easily get so freely?
HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, Stockton, Market and Ellis Sis., San Francisco.
Depew returned to-day on the German
steamer Kaiser "Wilhelm der Grosse.
He spoke freely of his observations and
experiences abroad. He said the vic
tory of Admiral Dewey at Manila and
the daring and splendid effort of Lieu
tenant Hobson at Santiago have done
incalculable service in convincing Con
tinental Europe of our fighting caliber
and arousing enthusiasm in England.
English statesmen whom he met all
said: "Keep the Philippines, share with
us China, and open ports in the East."
One said: "You must join the concert
of European nations. It is expensive,
but you cannot be an eastern power un
less you belong to the band. Our inter
ests will always be identical and the
mutual benefits incalculable."
"They rally us good naturedly," said
Mr. Depew, "on our protestations of
pure sentiment in the war, and say:
'Yes, that is the way we always get in,
and then we stay. Christianityand civi-*
lization demand it, you know, and we
give the beggars liberty, law, order
and justice, which they never had be
fore. It's in your blood. You have
come by it honestly. You have aroused
the appetite of earth hunger and you
cannot stop.' "
GERMAN OCCUPATION
IS NOW DECLARED AN
ACCOMPLISHED FACT
LONDON, June 30.â The Star to-day
says It has grounds for believing the
European powers will not consider
Rear Admiral Dewey Justified in "op
posing a landing" of foreign marines,"
as Manila is still under Spanish rule.
Continuing, the Star remarks: "A for
eign correspondent assures us that
German occupation is already an ac
complished fact."
Inquiries made on the subject show
that the Star's story about the situa
tion at Manila Is utterly discredited
here, r.nd inquiries at the embassies
show that the diplomats have not heard
of any such occurrence as the landing
of German forces at or'near Manila.
The estimated loss on the pear crop alone
will be about 50 per cent. The reports
roc iv<?U so fur from the large grain
ranches are that the wheat has been bad
ly thre-shed out, and a 40 per cent loss
is placed thereon by some of our con
servative farmers. In some sections it
will exceed that estimate. Oranges are
dropping badly.
FIRES ARE RAGING
IN THE MOUNTAINS
Folsom Prison Property Saved by
Heroic Work of the Convicts.
Three Fires at Napa.
FOLSOM, June SO.â One of the most dis
astrous forest fires that has ever visited
this section of the country started sev
eral miles north of Folsom this morning,
and it is still raging furiously near the
towns of Ashland and Lathrop. The wind
h;is blown furiously from the north all
day, and the spread of the fire has been
terrible. The loss runs into thousands of
dollars, comprising dwellings, barns,
crops, horses, cattle, etc.
The convicts at Folsom Prison were
taken out, and by back-firing managed
to save the prison property.
NAP A, June 30.â Three fires occurred
here to-day, while a fierce wind from the
north was blowing. The first was at th*
residence of Dan Martin at the head of
Main street, which was soon extinguished
'with small loss. The second was at the
home of Charles E. Harron on Stockton
street, causing a loss of $500: insured.
These were followed by a conflagration
east of town, which started in the hills
and swept the country south to Tulcay
Cemetery and the county road, crossed
the road and enveloped Dr. T. F. Willey's
place, destroying a barn. The fire ex
tended south tn Juarez Creek.
SACRAMENTO. June 30.â 1t was
learned here late to-night that a field fire
started near Rocklin, Placer County, this
forenoon, and driven by the fierce north
er, the fire swept southward, burning al
most everything in its path. It reached
the American River just east of Folsom
prison about noon, jumped the river and
swept over tha hills clear 'to the Co
sumnes River, and how far eastward is
not known. Houses, barns, fences, grain
and hay fields, cordwood, etc., were
wiped out, and it is said that consider
able livestock perished. Several persons
are said to have been Injured, but bo far
as known no lives were lost. The men
at Folsom prison had hard work to save
the outbuildings on the reservation. Ef
forts to learn the effects of the fire near
the Cosumnes were futile. From Rock
lin to the Cosumnes River 1b more than
thirty miles, and it is not known how
wide an area is swept over. It is said
the fire was driven across the country
with frightful speed and that the loss of
property must be enormous. -

Bold Plot Against the

Captain General Macias Claims

and Made Important
Seizures,
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, June 30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Porto
Ricans in this country have been In
formed of the discovery in Porto- Rico
by Captain General Macias of the ex
istence of a conspiracy which, had
It not been effectively and quickly
squelched, would soon have had the
island in a state of insurrection such as
now exists in Cuba and the Philippines.
Eduardo Baselga andÂ» Damian Cas
tillo, prominent Porto Ricans, active
leaders in the incipient insurrection,
have been executed, and Antonio Ca
tena, Miguel Morayta and Jose Muro
are in prison awaiting trial by the mili
tary court which sentenced their two
companions to death.
The conspiracy was discovered by the
Spanish postal authorities through a
letter written by Castillo to Baselga.
General Macias was informed of it, and
a quiet investigation disclosed the fact
that all the most prominent residents
of the city, both native and foreign
were involved. The headquarters of
the conspirators were located, and a
quantity of dynamite, arms and pro
visions, evidently intended for the
equipment of a small force, were found.
It was the intention of the leaders, af
ter their plans Lad been matured, to
publish as widely as possible a procla
mation calling ur>on all patriotic Porto
Rlcans who hold liberty dearer than
life to join them and accomplish the
overthrow of Spanish Government, the
death of the Governor and his officials.

DIRECT COMMUNICATION
FROM GENERAL SHAFTER
Significance of a Telegram Sent From
the American Army
Headquarters.
SIBONEY BEACH, General Shafter's
Headquarters, Santiago de Cuba, June
30.â Colonel Allen succeeded last night
In connecting this point by cable with
luantanamo.
This dispatch is sent from the beach,
almost immediately In front of the
headquarters of General Shafter. Or
dinary press messages cannot be ac
cepted before Saturday or Sunday next.
WASHINGTON, June 30.â General A.
W. Greely, chief signal officer, to-night
received a dispatch from Lieutenant
Colonel Allen, chief signal corps officer
in Cuba, announcing that a telegTaph
and telephone station had been estab
lished at a point within two miles of
the city of Santiago.
This information Is of the highest
importance to the officials of the War
Department, as it insures to them
practically direct communication with
General Shafter. The information is
significant, too, as it shows that the
American troops are within rifle dhot
of Santiago. The telegraph station be
ing, of course, within the American
lines, its location conclusively indi
cates that the forces of General Shafter
have established themselves In advance
of telegraph communication.

SPANISH SPY IS
HANGED BY CUBANS
Information Contained in Intercepted
Letters Shows the Desperate
Condition at Guantanamo.
Call-Herald Correspondence.
CAMP McCALLA, Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, June 17.â 1t is apparent from in
formation contained in letters found
on Spanish spies the condition of the
enemy in the town of Guantanamo is
most desperate. Not only are the
Spaniards in this vicinity shut off from
communication with Santiago, but they
are fast running out of food. Prom
Spanish sources comes the information
that, although the local troops have
been put on half rations, the supply
will barely hold out until the end of
this month. Cuban scouts several days
ago captured a Spanish spy, who was
bearing a letter from the commander
in Guantanamo to General Linares in
Santiago. This spy, I am told, was
hanged by the Cubans.
Public Gambling Must Stop.
CHICAGO, June 30.â Mayor Harrison
to-day served notice on President George
H. Wheeler, of the Washington Park
Club, that unless public gambling And
bookmaking is stopped within the club's
lnclos jre the officials at the track will
be arrested. This is the result of a com
plaint made to the Mayor by John Hill
Jr. of the Civic Federation, and is likely
to bring the present meeting at Washing
ton Park to a sudden termination.
REVENUE STAMPS
MUST BE AFFIXED
"WASHINGTON, Jane 30.â Treasury De

Class Song: That Was

POET ACCUSED OF THEFT

Sensational Exposure Follows the

Special Dispatch to Tho CalL
BOSTON, June 30.â There is a big
commencement sensation at Yale. It
turns out that the class song of the
Sheffield Scientific School for '98 was
not original. The class poet was W. F.
Tichborne, now in the Yale Battery.
The New London Telegraph accuses
him openly of having plagiarized the
poem from Bartholomew Dowling, an
Irish poet.
A comparison of the two productions,
as far as the first stanza is concerned, j
â¢will be suggestive. The class poem was;
We meet 'neath the sounding rafter,
And the walls around are bare;
As they echo the peals of laughter
It seems that the dead are there.
The following Is the original version,
according to g-ood authority: l
We meet 'neath the sounding rafter.
And the walls around are bare;
As they shout back our peals of laughter
It seems that our dead are there.

PLUCK AND PATRIOTISM
OF CAPTAIN PHINNEY
Refuses to Transfer His Schooner
Load of Coal to a Spanish
Steamer.
WASHINGTON, June 80.â A second
Case of an attempt to transfer coal from
an American vessel to a Spanish mer
chantman in Mexico has brought out
the old-time pluck of an American sea
captain. The 600-ton American schooner
Clara A- Phinney of New Bedford some
days ago was authorized to clear with
700 tons of coal from Mobile to Vera
Cruz on affidavits of reliable citizens of
Mobile that the coal was destined for
railroad purposes. On reaching Vera
Cruz Captain Phinney was directed by
L. Jonblanc, his consignee, to place his
vessel alongside the Spanish steamer
Maria Herrera. In the presence of a
pxoup of excited Spanish sympathizers
Captain Phinney bluntly refused, de
claring with emphasis that no vessel
in his charge should ever lie alongside
a ship bearing the flag of his country's
enemy, much less supply her with even
a pound of coal. The captain with a
crowd at his heels marched to the
American Consulate and notified the
Consul, and wrote at once to General
Spaulding, acting secretary of the
American Legation, that he had placed
himself under American protection. Ex
ports of coal to Mr. Jonblanc of Vera
Cruz will cease, rind the department
will undertake to nx responsibility and
punishment for the deed.
NO REFERENCE TO THE
"SINKING" OF BROOKLYN
So, of Course, the Story Is the Usual
Fabrication From Spanish

â WASHINGTON, June 30.â N0 word

from Admiral Sampson making the
Blightest reference to the Spanish story
of the sinking of the Brooklyn by
a shell from the Santiago harbor de

an hour or two of the cable sta

to report Instantly any such occur
rence, the officials of the Navy Depart
ment have no hesitation in denouncing
the story as a fabrication similar to
that got out a week ago from Ma

In this port on Its way to the Atlantic

Battle of Siboney.
WARMLY PRAISES HIS TROOPS
SPECIAL COMMENDATION FOR
SEVERAL OFFICERS.
Many Heroic Incidents of the Fight
on Sevilla Road Referred To
in the General's Otacikl
Report.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAMP JURAGUA, June 29 (via King
ston, Jamaica, June 30, 8 a. m.). â Gen
eral Wheeler's official report to Major
General Shafter of what is known as
the battle of Siboney is as follows:
In Camp Juragua, June 29. To the Ad
jutant General of the Fifth Army Corpse-
Sir: 1 have the honor to report that, in
obedience to the instructions from the
major general commanding, given me in
person oi/June 23, I proceeded to Siboney
(Juragua). The enemy had evacuated
the place at daylight that morning, tak
ing a course toward Sevilla. A body
of about 100 Cubans- had followed and
engaged the enemy's rear guard. About
nine of them were wounded.
1 rode out to the front and found the
enemy had halted and established them
selves at a point about three miles from
Siboney. At night the Cubans returned
to the vicinity of the town. At 8 o'clock
that evening the Twenty-third, General
Young, reached Siboney with eight"
troops of Colonel Wood's regiment, A,
B, I), E, F, G, X and L, 800 strong; troops
A,.8, C and X, First Cavalry, in all 244
men, and troops A, B, & and 1 of the
Tenth Cavalry, in all 220 men, making
the total force %4 men, which included
nearly all or" my command which had
marched from Baiqulri, eleven miles.
With the assistance of General Cas
tillo a rough map of the country was
prepared and the position of the enemy
was fully explained, and I determined to
make an attack at daylight on the 24th.
Colonel Wood's regiment was sent by
General Young, accompanied by two of
his staff officers. Lieutenants T. R.
Rivers and- W. R. Smedberg Jr., to ap
proach the enemy on the left hand, or
more westerly road, while General Young,
myself and about fifty troops of the First
and Tenth Cavalry, with three Hotchkfsa
mountain guns, approached the enemy on
the regular Sevilla road.
General Young and myself examined
the position of the enemy, the lines were
deployed and I directed him to dpen fire
with the Hotchkiss guns. The enemy re
plied, and the firing immediately became
general. Colonel Wood had deployed his
right nearly to the left of the regulars.
For an hour the light was very warm,
the enemy being very lavish in the ex
penditure of ammunition, most of their
firing being by volleys. ' .:.:
Finally the enemy gave way and re
treated rapidly, our. side keeping well
closed up on them, but our men being
physically exhausted by both their exer
tions and the great heat, were incapable
of maintaining the pursuit.
I cannot speak too highly of the gal
lant and excellent conduct of the officers
and men throughout my command. Gen
eral Young deserves special commenda
tion for his cool, deliberate and skillful
management.
I also specially noticed his acting adju
tant general, Lieutenant A. R. Mills, who,
under General Young's direction, was at
various parts of the line acting with en
ergy and cool courage.
The imperative necessity of disem
barking with promptitude had impelled
me to leave most of my staff to hasten
this important matter and, unfortunately,
I had with me only Major M. J. Beach
and Mr. Mestro, an acting volunteer aid,
both of whom, during the engagement,
creditably and bravely performed their
duties. : V ' â
I am especially indebted to Major Beach
for his cool and good judgment.
Colonel Wood's regiment was on the ex
treme left, and too far distant from me
to be a personal witness of the individual
conduct of the officers and men, but the
magnificent bravery shown by the regi
ment under the lead of Colonel Wood tes
tifies to his courage and skill and the en
ergy and determination of his officers,
which has been marked from the moment
he reported to me at Tampa. I have
abundant evidence of his brave and good
conduct on the field, and I recommend
him for the consideration of the Govern
ment. I must rely upon his report to do
justice to his officers and men. I desire
personally to add that all that I have
said regarding Colonel Wood applies
equally to Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt.
1 was immediately with the troops of
the First and Tenth regiments of cavalry,
dismounted, and 1 personally noted their
brave and good conduct, which will be 1
specially mentioned by General Young.
I personally noticed the good conduct of
Captains W. H. Bock, Robert P. Wain
wright and Jacob. G. Gailsmlth, Major
James M. Bell, Captain Thomas T. Know
and Lieutenant George E. Brown. The
last three were wounded. Major Bell, as
he lay on the ground with a broken leg,
said: "I only regret that l can't go on
with you further." â¢
Captain Know, though severely wound
ed, continued as long as possible to ex
ercise his command, and insisted to- me
that he was not much hurt, and Lieuten
ant Brown also made light of his wound
and continued up the line until he fainted.
I recommend these officers for tho favor
able consideration of the Government.
I cannot state positively the size of the
Spanish forces which we engaged, or the
extent of their, casualties, further than
to say that the force was much â¢ greater
than ours, and the information I have
would Indicate that their killed and
wounded exceeded those which our troops
sustained, but our estimate on this can
only be verified when we have access to
the reports of the Spanish commanders.
The engagement inspired our troops and
must have had a bad effect f upon the
spirits of the Spaniards, j It also gave
our army the beautiful and well-watered
country in which we have established
our encampments. It has also given us
a full view of Santiago and the sur
rounding country, and has enabled us to
reconnoiter close to the fortifications of
that place. .
The casualties in the engagement were:
First United States Volunteer Cavalry,
strength 500, killed 8. wounded 34:' First
United States Regular Cavalry, strength
244, killed 7. wounded 8; Tenth United
States Regular Cavalry, strength 220,
killed 1, wounded 10; total strength, 864,
killed 16, wounded 52. Respectfully,
JOSEPH WHEELER,
Major General U. S. V.

MATTHEW HELD
FOR MURDER
Inquest Into the Killing
of Hopken.
MILPITAS CONSTABLE'S PLEA
CLAIMS HE ACTED IN SELF
DEFENSE,
Strong Contradictory Testimony.
The Young Man Apparently Shot
in the Head Without
Warning.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN JOSE, June 30. â Constable John
P. Matthew of Milpltaa, who shot and
killed Hlnrlch Hopken, 'an 18-year-old
boy, near this city Monday evening,
was held to answer on a charge of mur
der by the Coroner's jury this after
noon.
Matthew claimed that he acted In
self-defense, but the testimony at the
inquest did not support his statement.
The officer's buggy had been robbed of
a coat and vest, and in looking for the
thief he ran across Hopken, who was
walking to Berryessa. The testimony
showed that the theft was committed
by a tramp and not by Hopken.
According to Matthew the young man
ran from him and made a motion as if
to draw a weapon, but it looks as
though Matthew drove up alongside
him and shot him in the head without
warning.
Hopken was a young man of excel
lent reputation and lived at Big Sur,
Monterey County. Matthew had been
drinking, and the act is characterized
as that of a drunken officer. A murder
charge will be sworn to on the arrival
of the boy's father to-morrow.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury was
that Matthew was "responsible for
Hopken's untimely death, and we find
it a case of murder."

TITE SAX FBAXCTSCO CALL, FBIDAY, JULY 1, 1898.
LOS ANGELES
WATER FARCE
City Council Still in a
Trifling- Mood.
FRUITLESS SECRET SESSIONS
DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF
ARBITRATION.
Hutchison Renews His Motion for
the Appointment of an Arbi
trator, but It Dies for
Want of a Second.
Special Dispatch to The ("all.
LOS ANGELES, June 30.â The City
Council to-day held another special ses
sion, when It was given out that some
thing would be done to clear up the sit
uation regarding the water question.
It was supposed that steps would be
taken to decide definitely whether the j
city and the w ater company would en- I
ter into arbitration to fix the price of
the water company's plant, but abso
lutely nothing was done, and the ses
sion was adjourned until next Wednes
day. Councilman Hutchison again re
newed his motion to appoint an arbi
trator, but it died for want of a sec
ond.
At a secret session of the Water
Committee of the Council with repre
sentatives of the company a long-wind
ed letter from counsel for the company
was read, which pointed out various
difticulties that would have to be clear
ed away before arbitration could be en
tered into. These difficulties are abso
lutely insurmountable and render arbi
tration impossible. Yet the City Coun
cil continues to carry on the farce for
no other purpose than to deceive the
people.
The water company's attorneys, in
I their communication to the City Attor
ney, state: "We do not believe now,
any more than when we talked to -ou,
that arbitration will amount to any
thing practical in the end; but if you
insist upon it we can as easily under
take it as yourself, and we will do so
t and will appoint an arbitrator."
The reason the company makes this
offer is because it knows that unless
voluntary arbitration is entered into,
and unless the result is satisfactory to
| both parties, the decision reached by
'the arbitrators would be overturned;
in other words, the price fixed by the
Mibitrators would be binding on neither
party.
Has Not Purchased Vessels.
WASHINGTON, June 30.â 1t is
stated at the War Department that the
United States has not purchased five
vessels of the Wilson's and Furloess-
Leyland line, as announced In dis
patches from London.
Murderer Hangs Himself.
NEW YORK, June 30.â Edward Bender,
a prisoner in the Tombs, awaiting trial
for the killing of Richard Bennett in
April last, committed suicide to-day by
hanging himself in his cell. He made
a rope of medical bandages and carefully
soaped it in order that the noose would
slip readily.

VIOLATING THE
NEW CHARTER
Thorns in the Path of
Miss Hankenson.
BOSS REA'S JOB WILL FAIL
WOMEN OF THE GARDEN CITY
â Jr. ' AROUSED.
Mrs. Clement Will Not Be Superseded
as ': Deputy Superintendent of
City. Schools Without a
Struggle.
Special Dlspai.?h to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 30.â Miss Irene
Hankenson, who was recently elected
Deputy Superintendent of City Schools,
will experience considerable difficulty
before she is safely installed in her po
sition.
The appointment of the young lady
was at the direct instance of "Boss"
Rea, who is a personal friend of Miss
Hankenson. The displacement of Mrs.
A. B. Clement caused a great deal of
comment, arid the Board of Education
has been condemned by the entire com
munity for its action. Since then the
various women's societies have taken
up the matter and strong resolutions
and petitions have been forwarded to
the board asking that she be retained
in her position. The San Jose Woman's
Club, an organization composed of the
most prominent women in the city, has
been especially active; but the School
Trustees have paid no attention to
these petitions and have insolently
gone along with other matters.
Within the last two days a new move
has been made by Mrs. Clement's
friends. Under the new charter a per
son, to become a deputy of one of the
city officials, must have resided in the
city for at least two years. Miss Ha:'
kenson has never been a resident of Sa
Jose, and for the last three years she
has been engaged teaching school at
Gilroy. Mrs. Clement's friends have
advised her to hold the office and refuse
to turn it over to her successor, as Mis-
Har.ker.son's appointment was illegal.
The charter is very piain on the sub
ject, and just how 'Boss" Rea intend,
to get around it and seat Miss Hanken
son is not clear. The law on the case
is found in section 4. article XIII. under
head of "Miscellaneous Provisions."
Mrs. Clement's term expired this
evening, but she will continue in of
fice, and in all probability there will be
lively times in Superintendent Rus
sell's office to-morrow should Miss
Hankenson insist upon taking the
place. There will then be two Deputy-
Superintendents of Schools, and the
matter will be carried into court. Mrs.
Clement has been legally advised to
retain her office, and her numerous
friends declare that an injunction will
be issued to prevent the Treasurer from
paying Miss Hankenson. Section 11,
under the same head and article of the |
charter, prohibits the Treasurer from
paying such claims.
Mrs. Clement has been in the City-
Superintendent's office for the past six
years, and her efficiency and affable
manners have made her many friends.
On the other hand, Miss Hankenson
has had no experience in the work.
BIG SCHOONERS
GO ACRUISING
PACIFIC CLUB YACHTS TO SAIL
TO SANTA CRUZ.
Cannon Will Boom and a Royal Wel
come Will Be Accorded by the Sea
side Resort to the Visitors.
About two weeks ago Commodore E. A.
Wiltsee, of the Pacific Yacht Club, is
sued orders for a cruise to Santa Crua
on the Independence Day holidays. The
yachts will anchor off Meiggi wharf to
night and at 4:30 a. m. Saturday a pre
paratory gun will be flred; at 5 o'clock the
yachts will get under way. Interest is
centered upon the two big schooners Ag
gie and Lurline, which are of almost ex
actly the same length, though of two
different types, Aggie being a center
board and Lurline a keel boat. The Lut
line was built by M. Turner, and her
dimensions are as follows: Length ovei
all, 80.40 feet; length on the water line,
72.60 feet: beam 21.05 feet, and draft 8.2;j
feet. The Aggie was built by W. O.
Hall, and has a length over all of 77.73
feet; a length on the water line of 69.83
feet; a beam of twenty-three feet, and
a draft of 6.75 feet.
Admiral J. D. Spreckels' Lurline will
have the following guests on board: As
sociate Justice Henshaw of the Supreme
Court. Messrs. J. D. Spreckels, A. B.
Spreckels, W. W. Foote. J. W. Reid, W.
S. Leake and H. F. Fortman. The fol
lowing will be Commodore E. A. WiltseeTj
guests: W. Northrup Cowles, W. L.

As the weather bureau promises a
brisk to high northwesterly breeze off
shore the yachts should make quick time
down to Santa Cruz. Word has been re

It is difficult to predict which boat will
reach its destination first; possibly in
heavy weather Lurline, being a keel boat,
might have an advantage, and in light
weather Aggie may run faster before the
wind.
The Wasp This Week.
Never before has a weekly paper on the Pa
cific Coast presented to its readers such a pro
fusion of half-tone illustrations as is done by
the Wasp this week. Not only are there a
large number of pictures, but they are well
printed and of such a size that the subject
can be deciphered without the aid of one's
imagination. Of the features illustrated in
the Wasp the most striking and interesting
are the sailing of the third Philippine expedi
tion and scenes on the bay and upon the trans
ports, breaking camp at Camp Merritt and
other entertaining bits of camp life and pic
tures of Colonel William C. Smith and steJT
and every company In the Tennessee regiment
Besides there is a magnificent engraving of w
General Merritt and photos of other celebrities.
A number of California views are also pub
lished. The center colored cartoon represents
Uncle Sam resenting Germany's aggressive
ness. The queer brood hatched by the bird of
liberty and the panic caused the Dons by thÂ»
threatened attack of the "Bunkoneer" are
other subjects of caricature. The literary fea
tures are worthy of notice, but suffice it to
say they have not been abridged and are up to
the usual high standard. The Wasp is issued
to-day this week, instead of Saturday as usual.
To Be Tried for Battery.
"Lieutenant General" A. W. Moore of
the Union Mission Army has escaped
from the charge of mayhem preferred
against him by Dr. Looney, but Judge
Joachlmsen ordered Looney to swear to
a complaint charging Moore with battery,
and Moore was promptly arrested on that
charge. He will be tried to-day, and
stands every chance of being convicted,
and sentenced.

GAS COMPANIES ALL OF A PIECE.
r~ x ROBABLY there is no city which at some stage
L /of its career has not had "difficulty in checking
*â  the larcenous tendency of a gas monopoly. For
a gas company is a monopoly as naturally as water'
runs downhill. If there happen to be two companies,
by an easy transition they become one, and, having
abolished rivalry, proceed to steal to the utmost
capacity of the agile meter.
It is not likely there is another city in the world a
worse sufferer than San Francisco. Here the charge
for gas is Si ~5 per thousand feet. The meters are
either inaccurate or the employes, neglecting to read
them, make sach guesses as inure to the benefit of the
corporation. It is notorious that a. householder must
pay for gas never consumed or thai his supply will be
arbitrarily cut off. So far as appears, he has no re
course. A short time ago the price of gas was cut
from %i to the present figure. This was heralded as
a great concession. As a matter of fact it made no
difference in the bills, and were it to be reduced to
10 cents the meters would be stimulated to new exer
-tion. pumped full of non-combustible but registerable
air. or the paid readers of the same be instructed to
pue=s on a different basis, and the bills would remain
where they arc.
Just now the London papers are making a fuss over
the chronic thefts of the pas monopoly there. Noth
ing is said about the wicked unreliability of meters, so
it may be they record correctly, which, being the case.
lend? importance to the price. The London rate has
been raised from two shillings and tenpence to three
shillings, and throughout the murky metropolis is
heard a howl of distress. Yet this increased rate is
much less than half the rate charged here, where every
householder, it is safe to affirm, pays for twice as
much as is consumed on his premises.
We sympathize with the Londoner, but have
troubles of our own. Supposing he had the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company and its aggrega
tion'of trained meters to contend with! Then he
would learn to regard the three shilling outfit as a
boon and a blessing. But if the London Gas and
Coke Company can afford to sell gas at three shillings
(72 cents) and give fair measure there is no excuse
for the local concern to charge $1 75 and rob the
consumer. That it does rob the consumer is a propo
sition so firmly established that none will attempt to
controvert it. Yet we hope the people of London will
triumph, and even that some time between now and
the millennial dawn the people of San Francisco may
cease to pay a fancy price for a tallow-dip variety of
illuminant.
THREATENING SPAIN'S COAST.
AT this writing there seems every probability that
a fleet will be sent to the Spanish coast. The
necessity for this will be deeply regretted in
this country. The people of the United States would
like to see the war settled without injury to the non
combatant. They are not thirsting for revenge. All
they ask is justice. They demand that Spain shall
yield. If to bring about such a state .of affairs a fleet
must be dispatched to Spain, so be it. Upon the
heads of Spanish diplomats will be the blood thus
shed. We would avoid the issue, could it be done
with honor. We will not shrink from it if the arro
gance of the Castilian force it upon us.
What malign genius is inspiring the fool trip of
the Cadiz fleet nobody seems to understand. The only
possible use for the ships of Camara would be at home
ports. There they would not, as a defense, be in them
selves potent, but they might have the effect of keep
ing our vessels nearer home. If Camara be sent to
the Philippines he will but go to his own doom.
The force that Dewey will have by th*> time he can
get there will be sufficient to crush him as completely
as Montejo was crushed. He can do no good; he
can do much harm by spreading and accentuating the
horrors of war. The Dons should spare themselves
this additional calamity, and in forcing the enemy to
Inflict it they will supplement their colonial disasters
by useless losses in the mother country
From the beginning there has been no hope for
Spain. It precipitated itself into a struggle where
there was for it no shadow of a chance for aught but
defeat, and yet with a fatuous energy it seems to be
trying to make the defeat appalling. No wonder the
decayii.g monarchy is yelping to the powers for help.
It needs more than mere assistance. Its crying re
quirement is for a guardian.
London Truth describes the present war as being
between a nation with a navy that cannot fight and
a nation with an army that cannot fight. There seems
no occasion for extended comment. To say that the
editor of Truth is a fool completely covers the case.
If news from Manila is to be relied upon the Span
ish there have no idea of Riving up without a struggle.
The plan of yielding gracefully seems to be beyond
the grasp of Castilian intelligence.
There are intimations that the Kaiser Is in need of
Bismarck's advice. Without doubt he can have it for
the asking.
GOLDEN GATE PORK-
WE venture to say that every intelligent tax
payer in San Francisco will heartily support the
making of ample appropriations for improving
Golden Gate Park. That reservation Is a monument
to the foresight of the Pioneers which should ever be
guarded with jealous care. This is especially so since
a deliberate attempt was made to steal it in the early
sixties by as unscrupulous a band of land grabbers as
ever filched the birthright of a people. In the strug
gle which resulted in the establishment of the park
there was displayed more civic virtue than is ordinar
ily seen where a similar amount of loot is in sight
The greatest work of George K. Fitch, late editor of
the defunct Bulletin, was done in Golden Gate Park.
But for him the land would probably have been
grabbed. As it was the raiders shoved the reserva
tion back four blocks, laid out a panhandle and cut
the area down from 1500 to less than 1000 acres.
Now that the people have this grand evidence of
the forethought and virtue of the pioneers, however,
it behooves them to insist upon its speedy improve
ment. Heretofore the appropriation for Golden Gate
Park has been subordinated by the Supervisors to the
necessities of the municipal government. In other
words, after the City Hall employes, the Street De
partment, the policemen, firemen and others have sat
isfied themselves, the remainder, under the limits
imposed by the various taxation pledges, has been
turned over to the park. In no instance has the
amount allowed by law been appropriated. Ten
cents on the $100 valuation is not too much, but here
tofore the park has been lucky to get 6 cents.
There are many good arguments to sustain a
liberal appropriation for Golden Gate Park. One of
the most powerful is a well-known desire on the part
of the generation which is paying for its improve
ment to enjoy some of its beauties and benefits. The
average taxpayer is willing to do something for pos
terity, but he is also anxious to do something for
himself. This thing of slowly improving a public
reservation like Golden Gate Park in order that un
born generations may sound our praises is a bene
volent idea, but as a practical proposition it is too
ethereal for popular consumption. The park should
be improved at once for the benefit of the men,
women and children now living. An issue of bonds
would be justified for the purpose.
The Supervisors need have no fear, therefore, that
a large appropriation for Golden Gate Park would
be unpopular. The board may with just propriety
grant the Commissioners the full amount allowed by
law. Ten cents on the $100 of valuation will yield in
the neighborhood of $350,000, only a small portion
of which would be available for improvement. It
ought to be noted always that the cost of maintenance
lat Golden Gate Park is constantly increasing. Every
acre reclaimed adds to this bill, so that even if the
full legal limit is appropriated it will mostly be eaten
up by current expenses. Upon the short sums al
lowed during recent years the work of development
has been greatly retarded. What the people now
want is to sec their "breathing ?pot" placed com
pletely under cultivation. If they are willing to pay
for it the Supervisors ought not to object.
We are safe in asserting that were the question to
be submitted to popular vote in this city a proposition
to appropriate $350,000 for Golden Gate Park would
be carried by a three-fourths majority.
THE NEW CURRENCY BILL.
AS a result of the Indianapolis Monetary Confer
ence of 1897 the Hou.se Committee on Bank
ing and Currency has been jogged out of its
deadlock and has come to an agreement on a report.
As its chairman, Mr. Walker, had declared such
agreement impossible, that it was reached is evidence
of the hard work done by the Monetary Conference,
its executive committee, and especially by its chair
man; Mr. H. H. Hanna of Indianapolis. Mr. Hanna
is a manufacturer, who has studied forward from his
daily business, admonished by financial conditions
in a majority of the States where his trade lies, until
he took up arms to try to remedy the con qinnces of
our jumble of financial legislation. He is remark
ably clear as to the necessities of the situation, but,
with a rare spirit of toleration, has recognized the
need of some few present compromises and modi
fications of the one straight plan that would give us
at once a financial system four square with science.
When the work is finished the business men should
not forget that credit for it is due to this gentleman,
who is quite worthy to hail from the State that gave
Hugh McCulloch to the Treasury and Michael C.
Kerr and Joseph B. McDonald to the cause of sound
finance in Congress. As has been already stated, a
canvass of the House demonstrates that the reform
bill can pass that branch. Its fate in the Senate is
problematical, but that does not change the duty
that is upon sound money Republicans and sound
money Democrats alike. If there were any hesita
tion before, the result in Oregon should have removed
it. There these two classes of voters pooled their
issues. They made no fusion and divided no offices.
They simply voted together on the basis of support
of a common principle. The indications are that they
will continue to do this in every State, until the forces
of fusion and fiatism have been routed and a long
step toward sound money has been taken by the
adoption of the reform bill now pending.
There is some disquiet over the resumption of silver
coinage provided in the war revenue bill. If in that
feature the fiatists had their innings, the sound money
men will have their consolation stakes in the pending
bill, which will pass the House and will probably be
made better by waiting in the Senate until the fall
elections have confirmed the wavering and encour
aged the timid.
Germany is sending another warship to the Philip
pines. The notion that the disposition of the islands
in some way concerns her seems to be deeply rooted.
When Germany was absorbing a slice of China it was
not noticed that the United States sent a fleet there.
Yet Uncle Sam has a right in the Philippines, while
Germany had in China only the right that a burglar
has in the premises of a householder.
It is time to recall that San Francisco claims Gen
eral Shafter. This city was long his station, and
the Fourth of July parade this year cannot come
quite up to the ordinary mark, because there will be
no rotund Shafter to lead the military.
The Spanish Government is now reported to be in
a "doubting mood." No precise analysis of this
emotion is given, but Spain can have no reasonable
excuse for doubt. The certainty that it is in for a
Hiking is fully established.
The Spanish "Minister of War says that he takes a
favorable view of the situation in Cuba. For an in
stance of sunny optimism there are few exhibitions
surpassing this.
When the Terror sought to be familiar with an
American war vessel it made a serious mistake. The
real field for the Spanish torpedo boat is somewhere
out of range.
THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 1, 1898.
THE PURE FOOD CRUSADE.
BY the arrest of certain grocerymen charged with
selling adulterated food products new evidence
is given of the activity of the Board of Health
and Inspector Dockery in enforcing the pure food
law. In hardly any branch of municipal adminis
tration have the whole mass of citizens a greater in
terest than in this. The sale of impure food, and
even its very presence in the market, threatens with
danger the entire community. Hardly a household
can be free from the menace. The strict enforce
ment of the law against the sale of such deleterious
articles is therefore a matter of prime importance.
It is to be hoped the activity displayed by the of
ficials of San Francisco in this respect will have the
effect to stimulate those of other cities in the State
to exercise a similar guard over the welfare of their
communities. As the case stands now, the expul
sion of impure foods from San Francisco tends to
drive them to other Californian localities. Goods
which cannot be sold here are packed up and shipped
for sale somewhere else. The enforcement of our
ordinance on the subject, therefore, makes it almost
a necessity for other cities to adopt similar regula
tions and enforce them with an equal strictness.
The problem of pure food is, in fact, one which
shculd be dealt with by the nation. In a broad
sense, it is a commercial and industrial as well as d
sanitary measure. The presence of impure foods
and cheap adulterations in the market seriously af
fects the industries of the producers and.manufac
Hirers of purer articles, and, moreover, gfves a. bad
repute to many kinds of American produce abroad,
and this injures our export trade.
Congress has taken several cautious, tentative steps
in the direction of pure food laws, and each of these
has been attended with good results. Nothing like
a comprehensive measure, however, has ever been
considered by that body, though a strong pressure
has more than once been brought to bear upon the
House to get such a.measure before it. Last winter
a largely attended pure food convention was held
In Washington, and a considerable amount of data
on the subject was prepared and submitted along with
a petition for protective legislation, but nothing came
of it. It is evident there must be a long campaign
of education yet before we can accomplish the elimi
nation of sophisticated and adulterated foods from
our markets, or compel their sale under proper la
bels.
In the meantime what is being done in San Fran
cisco is highly encouraging. We are keeping our
own market fairly clean of these frauds and furnish
ing a good example to other communities around
11s. No one will assume the guilt of any of the
at rested merchants now under prosecution, but the
very fact that they have been brought before the
courts is good evidence of activity on the part of our
health officers, and that in itself is a matter of no little
gratification.
SENATES (\S STUMBLING BLOCKS.
OPPOSITION to the proposed federation of the
Australian colonies has its main strength in
New South Wales, and in that commonwealth
seems to be based principally upon objections to the
system provided in the scheme of federation for con
stituting the Senate, f : Under the plan proposed each
state . of the federation will have equal representation
in the Senate, just as in this country, and to that New
South Wales, being populous and rich, is not willing
to consent. As a consequence the whole movement
for uniting the colonies is in danger of defeat.
â -'.'â  This situation of affairs has led to a consideration
of the part which Senates play in the ; Governments of
English-speaking nations, and the suggestion that it
would be advisable for the Australians to frame a con
. stitution without one. The London Speaker, in dis
cussing the issue, :' says: 'Friends of the bicameral
system will find it hard to explain the part which sec
ond chambers are now playing in the : English-speak
ing world. In the United States the Senate, repre
senting the â  smaller States, has been responsible for
economic catastrophes, political deadlocks and per-
I haps also for the war. In Canada a Senate consisting
> of effete Tories, nominated by : a defeated Government,
has thrown out the only practicable scheme of rail
â¢way. communication with the Yukon to please a Tory
leader who has a rival measure, .: In England the
House 'of Lords has to be bribed to : pass an Irish
! ; local government bill. In Australia the difficulty of
forming ;a ;; useful - and v representative second chamber
has shipwrecked federation," â 
.-.' The indictment is heavy, but it is; not fairly stated.
It is certainly right that small States, should have some
protection for their interests involved ;in legislation
against the overwhelming votes of the representatives
Tof '-. larger StatesV The charge brought against ; bur
Senate is, moreover, unfair. If it has blocked some
good ; measures it has also blocked, more bad ones.
â¢;; There is; a story to the effect that when pur form of
government was under consideration Jefferson, sitting
i at a tea table with Washington one evening,: strongly
advocated a single legislative body and asked Wash
ington of what use the second : could be. "Why did
i you pour your tea into your saucer?", asked Washing
i ton. "To cool it," replied Jefferson. '.'Well then," said
Washington; "we must provide a second chamber, into'
which legislation can be poured to cool."' â " â¢ "â 
There are times when our Senate seems to .keep
things blocked until they are overcool, and there are
1 other times when ; it seems to heat them hotter than
! when they left the House, but on the- whole it has
been a useful part of our governmental machinery
and few people would like to see it abolished. .. If
New South Wales has no other objection to Austra
lian federation than the one stated, the vote of her
people against the plan will be more whimsical than
reasonable and more provincial than patriotic. . â¢
Now the doctors have taken to saying that a bi
cycle rider of the scorching variety is not fit to be a
soldier by reason of having acquired extra kinks
about his pectoral valves. The statement does not
seem reasonable. A man capable of riding mile after
mile at top speed surely would be equal to the com
paratively easy marching required of a soldier. The
real difficulty would be for him to get the monkey
stoop out of his spine and learn to stand up like a
gentleman.
A correspondent named Hearst sends word from
Cuba that Santiago and the flower of the Spanish
army are ours. There only remains, as he makes
clear later on, the formality of fighting for them.
Camara may live to thank his lucky stars for the
present annoying inability to get coal. The circum

OAKLAND WANTS
ANOTHER SLICE OF
POLITICAL PIE
The Railroad Push Booming Par
dee for the Nomination for
Governor.
A Yellow Journal Joins the Corporation Com
bination and Boosts the Doctor for
Office.
It Is now very plain that Alameda \
County must decide whether she wants 1
to name the next Congressman from
the Third District, or the next
Governor. There is an evident de- j
sire on the part of candidates for -I
these offices to avoid placing the
county In the position of wanting to \
grab everything in sisrht. Oakland es-'J
pecially wishes to avoid posing before i
the State as an exhibition of selfish- ;
ness. That city already has a United
States Senator, a member of Congress, j
The Doctor Is in the Hands ol His Friends-Uncle Collis and Wasteful Willie.
member State Board of Equalization, !
Superintendent of the Mint, Naval Of- j
ficer, Immigration Commissioner a Su- !
preme Justice, large Custom-house pat- I
ronage, a Prison Director, Labor and
Deputy Labor Commissioner, and each i
of these has provided a number of fat i
places for other Oaklanders. Senator!
Fred Stratton is already a candidate j
for one of the Hawaiian committee of
five under the Newlands resolution, and
in addition Oakland now boldly an
nounces that .she wishes to capture the
Governorship as well as retain the Con
gressman.
Ambitious politicians who are in the
field realize that Oakland may be
charged with wanting too much, and
are forming combinations designed to
forward their own schemes and smash j
the schemes of the others. Intimations
have already been received from the
other six counties which with Alameda
compose this Congressional district,
that Oakland ought to be content with i
what she has, and a possible Governor- j
ship, leaving some other portion of the j
district to name the Congressman. Yet
while Pardee and Davis on the one
j hand, and Metcalf and Hilborn on the
other, are said to wish to keep the cam
paigns for the two offices entirely dis
tinct, it is hinted that i'ardee and Hil
born have formed a little mutual ad
vancement society.
The conservative element in the Re
publican party in that county â and Ala
meda is a conservative county â is some
what perplexed at the prominent part
the alleged Democratic Examiner is
taking in Rei Ã¼blican politics on the
other side of the bay. It has entered
I into a cast-iron contract to boom Par
' dee, and for months thi3 has been very
plain both in its local and editorial
columns. To tl â  thinking men in
Alameda County the foundation for
this assumption to dictate on the
I part of Mr. Maguire's organ is but
thinly veiled. The entire "push" of
that county, which has for twenty
years done the bidding of the railroad
corporations, is now lined up behind
"the doctor." Everybody who wants
anything from the Republican party is
In Pardee's camp, and his chief lieuten
ant and most active worker is the Ex
aminer correspondent for Alameda
County. Another of the doctor's
strongest supporters, who made v
very able speech at a recent Par
dee meeting in the Third Ward,
is Councilman B. C. Cuvellier. Mr.
Cuvellier has frequently. on the
floor of the Council appeared as the
champion of measures desired by the
Southern Pacific Company, notably the
granting of a franchise during the past
year. He is opposed to "cinch" prop
ositions, but is a nephew of General
Manager Kruttschnitt of the Southern
Pacific, and has frequently stated in
the Council that he is friendly to the
corporation. Under these circum
stances it ia somewhat peculiar that
Councilman Cuvellier should be an ar
dent supporter of the man who is at
tempting to capture the nomination at
the head of the Republican ticket on his
anti-railroad and Republican record.
Nor is it forgotten tha until "the
doctor" became anxious to enter poli
' tics and be Mayor of Oakland four
1 years ago he was for r> Ion.; period the
| oculiot of the Southern Pacific Com
j.pany, which he now so greatly despises.
As to his Republican record the stal
wart Republicans of Alameda County
are asking where it Is. Dr. Pardee first
came into prominence as a politician
by stampeding a Republican municipal
j convention a few years ago. Five years
ago he was the leading organizer of the
Municipal League, which put up a non
partisan ticket, beat the regular Re
publican ticket and elected the doctor
Mayor of this city. Two years later |
he essayed to repeat the trick ; and ;
failed. On this occasion . Republicans
and Democrats â¢ outdid "the doctor" at
chicanery, for they nominally, indorsed
his candidate, J. W. Nelson, . but voted â¢
for John L. Davie and this ended Par
dee's political boom. .â¢â¢â¢;â '.. â¢â¢ '.'..'â â¢. .... -.',â¢â¢â¢Â«â â¢?
It is also fresh in the public memory
that Dr. Pardee, whj is being boomed
as "a great fighter," took a trip to
Castle Crag before the breaking out of
the great strike of 1894, at which time
he was May.or of Oakland, and that he
sent word that he c mid not get back
to Oakland as the trains were tied up.
When this fact became known several
offers were made to get Mayor Pardee
back to his city within three days if
he desired to come â but he did not come
till the strike was over.
These references to Dr. Pardee's anti
railroad and Republican records are
known to no one better than the Ha
guire advisers of the Examiner, and
that paper realizes what an easy task
It would have should Pardee receive
the nomination in beating him and
electing Maguire. With this same end
in view the Alameda County, edition of
the Examiner turns every Republican
meeting into a "Pardee demonstration"
and plasters over with compliments all
of Pardee's supporters, while his
enemies, politically, are tarred and
feathered. Particularly is this the case
with District Attorney Snook, who, un
til a few months ago, was a most pro
nounced pet of the Examiner, but
which, since it undertook to nominate
Pardee, is his most unrelenting foe and
detainer. . ".
There is more than one Republican
| in the county who believes that Par
! dee was injected into this fight by. the
I Examiner and its allies for the pur
i pose of beating W. R. Davis. In a
legal capacity Davis has been able to
j worry the ' railroad .. considerably, es
pecially in the .water.. front- cases,- and-
I in a .political, capacity, the railroad .will
i not tolerate him.; Although, the Ex
' j ammer during the trial of these cases
was morally." backing Davis' side of
the litigation, . since â  then it has sub
â¢ jected him to some severe inspired crit
icism.. â â :--.'.;â .- .-. ' â â  'â¢â¢ ;'..''
v The local press is no guide whatever
. to the situation. ; While Frank Leach
owned the. .Enquirer it was body and
| soul a Davis paper, and not until Dr.
Pardee ' bought the ' whole institution
did. it change the color of its advice
j to the' people of Alameda County and
j the State. The .following-clipping, shows
the width of the change in the . En
â quirer's views: . .
Mr. Davis' candidacy for the office of
' Governor- stands on its merits. The mo
ment is opportune. It is Alameda Ckran
â¢ ty's chance. She has earned the right to
â have th(- candidate by what she di '. lor
the' Republican party last year, and if
Alameda County will present to "the
Statt- convention the name of Mr. Davis
and back it up with a harmonious dele
gation he can be nominated. Giving DOOO
majority for McKlnley was not all Ala
meda County did. It is not generally
km.wn, but it i.Â« a fac\, that Mr. Davis,
at the request of the ixecutive commit
tee, drew up the programme upon which
the Republican campaign was conducted
during the last ami decisive month. By
request Mr. Davis drew jp a plan which
was aent out over the nane of Chairman
McLaughlin to all the speakers, with i) c
request that they use it as their gutfie.
Thil document was dated the 7th day of
October 1896, and ho sma,] share of the
credit for the brilliant manner 'n which
the campaign for Bound money snl re
stored prospi rity was closed In CalJfot>
nia is duo to M* Davis. A.ameda Cout;
ty need not fear to put forth such a can
didate.
The above was published about six
months ago. Now on nearly every
pag-e of the doctor's paper Pardee is
t xt (lied, while Davis is persistently ig
i or declared to be out of. the run
ning-.
The Tribune so far has confined it
self to a middle-of-the-road policy and
publishes nothing particularly 'avora
ble to either man. while holding out
the possibility of the nomination com
ing to this county. It is also a fact
that the leading adviser of the En
quirer's new manager is the Exami
ner's Oakland correspondent.
A careful and impartial survey of
the political field in Alameda County
would seem to indicate that there are
too many men in the county wishing
to profit individually and personally by
the county's heroic efforts in the Mc-
Kinley campaign, and .that -many dire
disappointments will be experienced.
NOT A DUAL CELEBRATION.
â  Pan Francisco, June 30, 189&
"Editor of ' The Call: Under the caption'
"Two Celebrations in One." The Call of
this day states "that the Ancient Order
of Hibernians of this city will ho:d at
Sohutzen Park on the Fourth of July a
dual celebration in order to commemorate
at one and the same time the natal day
of American Independence and the Irish
rebellion of 1798." Permit me to say that
you have been misinformed as to the
character of the celebration referred to,
anil that the gathering of the Ancient
Order of Hibernians and their friends at
Schutzen Park on July 4 is intended sole
ly to comraenmrati the glorious anniver
sary of American independence.
The events of the Irish struggle for
liberty in 1795, although kindred in their
nature, will not constitute any part of
the programme on the occasion. The in

THE EIGHTH AT
CAMP BARRETT
Arrival of Companies From
Redding, Woodland, Grass
Valley and Petaluma.
CAMP BARRETT, FRI'ITVALE, June
"'lâ With the arrival of the companies
from Redding, Woodland, Grass Valley
end Petaluma, to-day, the Eighth Cali-
Volunteers is completed and under
canvas. The examination of the men is
progressing more rapidly, and will be con
einded by Saturday night.
The first company to reach Camp Bar
rett was the Redding command, 123 offi
cers and men, which reached Sather sta
tion shortly aftrr S o'clock this morning.
The officers are: Captain. W. E. Smith;
first lieutenant, James G. Estep, and sec
ond lieutenant, Ed S. Reynolds. The men
lpft home at 9:SO last night, after being
the recipients of the greatest ovation in
..story of the town. They were
greatiy fatigued after their all night jour
ney, and have dope little to-day beyond
g. ttir.g their tents up and their baggage
uted. Treka contributed thirty-two
men to the command, ail the members of
which ate inured to hardships, and feive
promise Of making execellent soldiers.

Grass Vail- I '.gent, which arrived
â 'ter. in â¢ immaiid of Captain Riley
and Lieutenants Terrill and Miller, looked
like a . 140 men being in line.
They w<.r. followed Boon after by the
tiride of Petaluma, 10-1 strong, commanded
by Captain Mac Clay, who, though he has
ed );s commission, could not deny;
himself the pleasure of leading his men
amp. Lieutenants Cassidy and
Kmerson also came with the company,

The Petaluma company has the distinc

equipped of any company in the regiment.

and every man was provided with
pants and blouse. The boys had passed
through the hands of the Red Cross So
ciety of San Francisco, and they bore full
evidence of it, for every one of them
looked lik>^ a huge bouquet. But while
the San Francisco ladies took care of the
Petaiumans, the ladies of Oakland and
Alameda wore at their posts early to pro
fox! the others, and their mlnlstra
were most acceptable- and heartily
cheered.
While there are many men in camp in
citizen's clothes, Quartermaster Heller
has a large supply of new State uniforms
on hand, and as fast as the companies
are examined and requisitions made the
men are fitted out. The uniforms are
yerior to some of those issued to
the troops at Camp Merritt. and Gov
ernor Budd will have the satisfaction of
knowing that the Eighth will be turned
over to Major General Otis the best
equipped of any volunteer regiment as
. to the Philippine expedition.
â¢Some of the companies wore sent out by
pquads for drill this morning, but little
s>ld work will be done until the men
have been mustered into the service.
When that is accomplished and the real
Instruction begins the men will find thai
will have littlo use for the anti
quated old muskets provided by the State
and that they will be practically without
arms until they draw their ordnance from
the Government. Colonel Henshaw and
n&rit Colonel Carrington are too
thorough soldiers to make the mistake

Major Forbes visited Camp Barrett this
afternoon in company with Colonel Hen

drawn from the old Fifth, and made a.
most favorable Impression among them.
Colonels Henshaw and Carrington have,
postponed the date of. their mustering In
until to-morrow. Both officers visited th&

Adjutant Smith and Quartermaster

as both officers are very proficient they
will soon have their duties well In hand.
Captain Barnes has not joined his com

when he will give Surgeon Shiels an op
portunity to measure his girth.
Captain Baldwin put in an appearance
for a few minutes and when he visited
the Marysville company he was given a
round of cheers. He was formerly cap
tain of that company.
The question of the ultimate destina
tion of the regiment is discussed by of
ficers and men to the exclusion of al
most everything else. That the Eighth
will be ordered on foreign service in the
near future is accepted as a foregone
conclusion, and the only thing left to set
tle in the minds of the warriors is
whether it will be Cuba or the Philip
pines. The rumor has been started that
the regiment is destined to Cuba, and
Colonel Henshaw and a majority of the
officers are credited with favoring that
campaign, while Lieutenant Colonel Car
rington and some others are said to pre
fer the East as the scene of their opera
tions.
THE FOURTH**EXPEDITION.
No Perceptible Haste in the
Engagement of fchips to
Carry the Troops.
The next and fourth expedition to Ma
nila will pail from San Francisco just as
soon as the transports can be secured
and put into the proper condition.
It is conceded, among officers in a po
sition to speak authoritatively that the
next expedition cannot leave this port be
fore July 11. It is the intention of Gen
eral Otis to get all the troops at Camp
Merritt away on the next two expeditions
if the necessary number of transports
can be secured. Should this plan fall
then the forces will be sent in smaller
detachments just as rapidly as vessels
for their transportation can be secured.

but whether Bhe will be one of the fleet
or not set tna to bfl still in doubt.
The Pennsj Lvanla should arrive to-day
or to-morrow, but she has her cargo of
machinery to discharge, and all in all
matters among the transports are pro
gressing slowly. The City of Puebla has
had a now propeller put on and will go
on the drydock to<iay. The Peru Is well
on toward completion and it now begins to
look as though the Government would
send those two vessels away together
and form another fleet out of the avail
able steamers. Certain it Is that they will
be ready to sail before any other vessels
can be got ready. The Peru and Pueula
are both fifteen knot steamers and they
could make very quick time to Manila. In
fad if they â went down full speed they
would not be far behind the Ohio, xn
ilkiiKi., Morgan City, City of Para, Valen
cia and Newport when tne Philippines
were reached.
The chances are that the Alaska Pack
ers' Association's fine ship Taeoraa will
be chartered by the Government. Negoti
ations are now pending and if she is cnar
tered she will go to Puget Sound to load
coal f<>r Manila. She is a fast vessel and
can carry mmO tons of coal.
There is some talk of fTRe Government
taking the big steamer Willamette. She
has cabin accommodations for forty-two
officers, and. with the Turner patent
bunk, the vessel could easily befitted out
to carry 1000 BOldlers. When in good trim
she can easily make eleven knots, and
that is a greater speed than Uncle Sam
has demanded fnun the other transports.
With the Willamette n fleet composed
of the Walla W.ilia, Pennsylvania, Aca
pulco and City of Rio de Janeiro, oouid
be got ready to Uave a week after the
sailing of the Puebla and Peru.

IOWA BOYS REMEMBERED
The Governor of the State
Writes an Encouraging Let-
ter to Colonel Loper.
Colonel John C. Loper of the Fifty-first
lowa received the following interesting
letter from the Governor of his State:
DES MOINES, June 25. 1898.
Colonel J. C. Loper, Camp Merritt, 9an
Francisco â My Dear Colonel: I have been hear
ing good things of you, colonel, and of the
Fifty-first lowa. God bless you and all the
boys of your regiment and all the boys In the
field.
We are now busily engaged .n preparing two
light batteries, and I am expecting an addi
tional call for troops at no distant date. A
trip across the ocean from San Francisco to
Manila under favorable circumstances would
be ir, st enjoyable, but I confers that I sym
pathize with the boys as I contemplate a trip
hi transports, where, at the best, the ac
commodations will be very poor.
Remember me kindly to those of y/>ur official
household and all others to whom It may be
convenient to speak. Yours sincerely,
L. M. SHAW.

Stringent Regulations Pre
scribed by Brigadier General
Otis Have Been Modified.
Brigadier General Otis has found it ne
cessary to materially modify the strin
gent orders regulating visitors to the
Fourth Brigade that issued from head
quarters on Wednesday.
It was discovered that the original or
ders, as published in The Call of yester
day, could not be successfully enforced.
The commanding officers of the. different
regiments did not for a moment question
General Otis' order, but they were
obliged to listen to scores of complaints
from their men, and these complaints
were duly reported.
As a. result the order following was is
puod yesterday. Tt is not a rescinding or
der in any respect, but supplementary:
It Is the intention of the briKa.de commander
to Rrant such reasonable camp privileges to

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
.'., NEW YORK, .June SO.â The continued dull- I
ness of the stock market, to-day justified the
Judgment of the member! ; of the Stock. Ex- â 
.change that it was hardly worth while to keep |
â  open for Saturday's half day's trading preced-
Ing Monday's holiday.' A great part of to-day's 1
business consisted of closing up and evening up j
old contracts preparatory, to the : three days' j
. cessation of trading. This dullness in the mar- i
ket in face of the actual existence of war is In I
striking contrast to; the extreme nervousness
which dictated the abolition of the usual Stock I
Exchange holiday on Good Friday last,, when j
there was dally expectation of the present at- J
tention of the report, of the Maine disaster to |
Congress and an outbreak of .hostilities against
Spain.. Stock Exchange, members then insisted
upon holding .a ; - session to afford, opportunity ;
to sell' stocks in the. fear of what has .now J
; actually come, to pass,- and which, having come
to pass, finds prices at an extremely high level, :|
- firmly maintained.: , Dull as to-day's market !
was,:- the .day -.for. stocks . clearly exceeded the
supply and there was a quiet absorption of
securities, through a widely extended list. Busi- |
ness continued, largely professional, ; but there
â  was some cummission liouse business, done, the
outside buying.-, being attributed â  . to . Western
sources, ..arid": being, especially, manifest in the
grangers In sympathy with the : improved tone
-. of the. -Wheat market. , Sugar continued its ad- j
vance, but lost' it before the day closed. Peb- I
. pies. Gas- was up; at; one time 2% points and '
; Brooklyn Transit gained a point. A movement ;
â to .realize" oh : the day's : advance late in : the
' afternoon caused a sharp reaction; which was j
. mosU--siarked'..ln . the stocks which had shown j
the largest gains, arid in which Tobacco also ,l
shared. Pullman showed a further striking ad- I
.' vance and touched. 207%. The buying is said to
.be due to. a 'pending distribution of the com
; pany's large ..surplus. ..Doubts over the Inter
pretation of some! points of the new revenue
.law : which goes into force to-morrow had an
Influence'- in curtailing speculation., A decline !
â In sterling exchange in response to the lower- ;
Ing of the Bank of England discount rate was

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 30.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here, including Americans, were
steady, but without business. There was no
special feature.
The reduction In the Bank of England dis
count rate has come a week sooner than ex
pected; It was good policy of the directors.
however, to make the movement, for they have
done a much larger loan business than they
â¢uoiiid hiave. don.- otherwise. I'robably Â£2.000,000
was* loaned to-day, ;he money ijeins wanted for
the cuatomarj half- yearly requirements. A
Dutch loan for B7.BB;Qoti fl..rins (about $23,250,
(KKO is announced to-night, the Interest being
3 p.-r cent. Speyer Bros and the Union Bank
of London will receive subscriptions In London.
An Indian loan for Â£6,000,000 Is expected with

j conditions were unskilled . in the symptoms of
that variable malady. In fifteen, minutes the
â¢fever .had again reached the stage ; It. had at-
I tamed the day. before.' and In another hour
i. nothing could be heard but shouts for wheat
.1 and cries of ruined . crops. September started
i slightly under yesterday's, close, but It very
I quickly began' an -upward ; movement -'-. that'
j reached great dimensions both In the volume
â  of the transactions and the extent of the ad
. vance. Shorts ' who. had been congratulating
themselves over, the reaction in prices at the
â I. start became uneasy when the price of Sep
:| tember reachd 69 and commenced . to feel thor
{ oughly alarmed when it got above 69>>ic,.:and
I panic stricken when it was climbing from 69% c'

from -72%c, the opening price, to 74% c. . The
crop reports emanating . from people In the
trade In various Western cities, Were of an ex
' aggerated type,'. regarding the amount of dam
age done by rust and bugs, some of them sug
gestive, of an actual crop failure. The ad
vance was all lost. on reports from sources con
versant with the broad general features of the
j crop over the entire country, which Indicated a
crop of unusual magnitude after, all allowance
â  was made for heavy, damage. In a good many
! localities.- The Cincinnati' Price Current nug
.- gested a yield fully as large as In IS9I. when
â  Jt was 611.780.000 bushels, and the unused sur- .
j plus of that crop, weighed on the markets here
'and abroad for two years. The restoration of
the wheat duty by France was apparently: ig

SUCCESS OF DR. E. R. DILLE
DB. CHAPMAN FOUND TWO
CHEAP DELEGATES,
Borne Christian Endeavor Politics
That Furnished Much Fun at
the Los Angeles Con
vention.
Oakland Office Son Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 30.
The delegates from Alameda County
*-ho went to the State Christian Endea
v r convention at I^os Angeles are re
turning and they toll with great pride of
how they "did politics" in the southern
city and succeeded in capturing the State
convention for Oakland in 1899.
The AJameda delegation staked Its
chances of success upon the probability
that Los Angeles would be suffering from
a hot wave at the time of her convention.
The prognostication proved to be correct,
for all the delegates in the City of the
Angela sweltered from the tlmÂ» they ar
rived until they departed, with the excep
tion of about half an hour one evening.
It was during that half hour that Ala
meda won its fight.
Before leaving Oakland, at the sugges
tion of George P. Lowell, who reaped
his personal reward by being elected
State president of the society, a thousand
fans were acquired, upon which was
printed, "Oakland wants the convention
in '99."
When the first breath of hot air swept
over the convention hall Oakland dele
gates, headed by Dr. E. R. Dille, Rev. E.
S. Chapman and Mr. Lowell, proceeded
to distribute the fans. The gift was most
â¢welcome and everybody was made aware
at one move that Oakland was In the
field.
The evening before the session at which
the place of holding the next convention
was to be decided the Alameda delegation
acquired a church and announced a re
ception. Endeavorers are much given to
receptions and on this hot southern Cali
fornia night the wily Alamedans Invested
In many gallons of ice-cream. The scheme
KLONDIKERS
OUT OF LUCK
Vessels Held for Lack
of Money.
A BOSTON COMPANY'S WOES
EXPENDED OVER FORTY THOU
SAND DOLLARS IN VAIN.
One Wealthy Member Accepted a
Commission in the Army and
Left His Companions in
the Lurch,
At least a dozen'Klondlke ventures are
tied up here for want of funds and the
outlook for any of them reaching the
gold fields this year is not good. In some
of the ventures the promoters had little
to lone, in others everything that the gold
hunters possessed in tha world Is tied up
In the scheme..
In the latter category 1b the expedition
that was to have sailed on the schooner
Laura Madsen for St. Michael on May 15
last. Over $40,000 has been sunk In that
venture, and as the indebtedness of the
party in this city is over $15,000 the
chances of the vessel getting away are
very slim.
In March last thirty-four business men
and mechanics got together In Boston,
Mass., and formed the Mutual Mining,
Trading and Transj-wtation Company of
Boston. Dr. W. S. D. Hitchcock was
elected president, Edgar Auiks treasurer
and George Miles general manager. All
the work was to be done by the members
of the company and it was to be share
and share alike. So far there has been
nothing to share but hard luck.
The first thing the new company did !
was to have built for use on the Yukon
a river steamer. This vessel Is 1$) feet
long-. 40 feet broad, draws 2 feet when â 
loaded aHd is to carry 200 passengers. She ,
was christened the Florence E. Miles.
Then a complete sawmill and an electric
light plant was purchased and everything i
was shipped to San Francisco. There j
were six carloads in all of things belong
ing to the Mutual Mining, Trading and
Transportation Company that came here
',i(5 when they were landed at the rail
road depot there was not a cent due on
thorn.
The next movement was the charter-
Ing of the schooner Laura Madsen from
Captain "W. H. Madison. The vessel was
docked at Lombard-street wharf and the
men >>. the party went to work and put
all their machinery and outfits aboard.
The next thing was the purchase of two
ye-ars' supplies and the thousand and one
things necessary for an extended stay in
Vhe arctic.
Then came the first setback. The war
broke out and one of the party, whosu
father was to put $10,000 into the scheme,
rec ivcil ;i commission in the army and is
now with his company In Florida. The
father refused to have anything to do
With the Klondike scheme and the $10,000
in which the company was depending
was not forthcoming. Then a committee)
was sent back East to raise funds, but
ly hud any thoughts for the gold
and everybody was intent on buy
â¢ -ir bonds and would have nothing to
â¢h the Alaskan venture. In conse
ilie Laura Madsen is tied up at
-Street wharf and no one knows
will get away. In her hold there
â¢t vaflied at $40,000, but on It San
merchants have a lien for
$17,000, and until that js paid the
Members of the Mutual. Mining, Trading
dd Ti.n Bport&tlon Company will remain
!n fiin Francisco.
The enture that was to pet away on
th# itÂ«amÂ«r Dirigo is also detained by the
if money. Wht-n Swiftwater Bill's
companj chartered the Dirigo It an
lat the stern wheel steamer City
r>t DtfAHon was to be towed up by the Di
rigo, and the passengers would be trans
ferred to her at Bt. Michael. The Dirigo
and the paaaengera have been ready to
sail for over a, week, and every day the
gold hunters have been told that a start
would surely be made i.iat night. The
if Dawoon waa not ready, however,
and when she was at last in a condition
that I'-r engineer considered her Beawor
thy the trouble over the money began.
H. Zartler claimed the vessel, and Birch Â«fc
Co., the builders, refused to give her up,
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
worked like a charm. While the dele
gates were eating ice-cream and fanning
themselves wjth Oakland fans the Ala
meda delegation got in its deadly work.
While eating frozen cream and having
the mosquitoes kept away by a friendly,
fan it was absolutely impossible to de
cline a request to vote for the generous
donors of both. One of the returning
delegates draws a very graphic picture
of Dr. Dllle campaigning. The doctor
started out from the ice-crram table with
half a dozen dishes of cream and as many
fans, and when he returned for more he
reported that he had won six votes for
Oakland.
Dr. Chapman, a veteran religious cam
paigner, did even better, for it is report
ed that he won two votes with the same
dish of cream. Next morning the first
ballot told the tale and next June hun
dreds of delegates will be welcomed at
the State convention in this city.

other creditors put in an appearance, and
in their trail came a Deputy Sheriff. Yes
terday Birch & Co. notified the Chief
Wharfinger that they owned the steamer
City of Dawson and were responsible for
the wharfage. Shortly after that Zadig
sent a tug around to move the boat, but
Harrie C. Biggs, secretary of the Birch
company, was on deck with a gun, and
defied anybody to put a hawser aboard
the City of Dawson. The Wharfinger also
ordered the tug away, and the matter
ended there. The contending parties will
hold another conference this morning, and
Mr. Kimball has some hopes of getting
the Dirigo away to-night. In the mean

Captain Challeston of the barkentine
Ruth has had an experience â¢with green
pallors that ho never wants to repeat.
The vessel was chartered by the Stand
ard Oil Company to carry kerosene to St.
Michael, and a crew was procured from
one of the boarding masters. All went
well until the barkentine was on the bar,
find then every man In the forecastle be
came fearfully eeaslck. Captain Challes
ton thought this a strange sign, but said
nothing, thinking that all would be well
in an hour or so, when the men got their
sea legs.
This was last Wednesday, and as the
Ruth got off shore it began to blow so
hard that it was necessary to shorten
sail. The watch was ordered aloft, but
not a man Jack of them knew the way.
The other watch was called, but they, if
anything, knew less about a ship than the
men on duty. The captain was in de
spair. Sail had to be taken in. and how to
do it was a conundrum. Finally he or
dered one of the greenhorns to the wheel,
and he, the first and second mate and the
cook, went aloft to furl the sails neces
sary to put the barkentine under snug
canvas. While they were aloft the green
horn at the wheel let the vessel broach
to, and Captain Challeston is still wonder
ing how it was that the Ruth was not dis
masted. Finally, however, the sail was
got in, and then the vessel was headed
for San Francisco, where she arrived yes
terday. A Sailors' Union crew has now
been put aboard, and the Ruth will make
another start for St. Michael to-day.
The schooner Maxim was out in
Wednesday's blow with the Ruth. She
carried away her roresail and jib, and put
back to port for repairs.

NOT A MAN OF MYSTERY.
Healer Francis Warnon Writes in
Defense of His Work as a
Disciple of God.
OAKLAND, June 30.â "Dr. Francis," the Divine Healer who Is holding a
mission in this city, sent the following communication to The Call to-day:
"I respectfully ask gentlemen of the press to continue to accord fair
treatment to the work of God in which I am engaged. Being one of the
Lord's chilled-steel anvils, I don't object to being hammered myself, that
being one of my credentials (I Timothy, 111:12) and recreation (Romans,
v:3), but Ido request that the work may be treated considerately. The
floating statements that I claim to be something 'great' are unfounded in
fact. I am simply a plain, humble servant of God, trying to do his will and
benefit my Buffering fellows.
"Persecution invariably accompanies this blessed work, but having a no
ble aim in my mission, I do not resent it, and try to meet It in the spirit of
that text, 'He answered them never a word.'
"The press has treated .me and the work with liberality and Justice, for
which I desire to express my thanks, and now at their request I disclose
my uninteresting identity by simply inverting my recent temporary signa
ture of Warnon. Francis to. Yours truly, FRANCIS WARNON."

Will He Still Hold His
Municipal Office?
MANY QUESTIONS OF LAW
MAY BEST WITH THE BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS.
.
A Puzzle of Legal Questions Which
Is Exciting Considerable Con
troversy About the City
HalL
Now that District Attorney Barnes has
accepted a commission as captain of
Company C, Eighth Regiment, the
matter has given rise to much spec
ulation as to whether he will
still have the privilege of holding his of
fice of District Attorney, or if it will be
necessary for him to vacate this to turn
soldier.
The law on the matter Is a very compli
cated one, and when <"ity and County At
torney Creswell was asked about the mat
ter yesterday he was unable to give an
opinion, as questions of constitutional law
are involved which require hours of care
ful study and research.
"If," he says, "the question were
one of State or county appointments
the matter would simply resolve Itself
into the question as to which body the
appointment was subordinate to. One is
a Federal and the other a county ap
pointment, and as thu duties of the two
positions in no way conflict it brings
about a complete change in the question.
"Section 20, article 4, of the State con
stitution says: 'No person holding any lu
crative office under the United States or
any other power shall be eligible to any
civil office of profit under the State.' Thi.s
settles the question so far as any person
holding a Federal office is concerned, but
does not directly bear on a man holding
a county office and about to accept a
Federal appointment.
"The Political Code, however, seems to
leave the whole matter in the hands of
the Board of Supervisors. It provides that
If an officer leave the State for a term
exceeding sixty days his office shall be de
clared vacant and a successor appointed.
In case of sickness, however, or an urgent
call from the- State the Supervisors have
the power of granting such extension of
time as they may see fit. Whether un
der the circumstances the salary would
go on as usual is a question which, in all
probability, would rest with the Super
visors, but as long as Mr. Barnes holds
the office, whether he Is engaged In the
performance of his duties or away on a
leave of absence, he seems entitled to send
in a bill for salary.
"A caM of tills kind occurred in New
York some years aco. The Assistant City
Recorder was elected to the State Legis
lature, and as thi.s kept him in Albany a
great portion of the time it was impos
sible for him to attend to his duties in
New York City. When his term of office
expired he sent in a full bill fur services,
which the city government refused to pay
on the ground that he had failed to per
form the duties of his office. The matter
was brought into the courts and he re
ceived a favorable decision, the Judge
holding that, as his office had not been
declared vacant, he was entitled to re
muneration for the. full term. This case
seems parallel with that of Mr. Barnes,
in case he should be called out of tht
State for military duty and neither re
signed nor was ousted by thÂ« Supervis
ors."
A fair construction of the section of the
constitution above quoted, however, not
withstanding the observations of Mr.
Creswellâ which are not to be understood
as expressing his opinion on the law of
the matter-would seem to indicate that
District Attorney Barnes cannot hold the
ofttceÃ of captain and District Attorney
at the same time. A commission in the
army is a Federal office and Mr. Barnes'
present office is a position under the
State. District attorneys are county offi
cers, and are created by the county gov
ernment act, being purely a creation of
tho State. The moment, therefore, Mr.
Barnes accepts the captaincy of Com
pany C the Board of Supervisors may de
clare his present office vacant and under
the consolidation act or county govern
ment act appoint his successor. Both
these statutes authorize them to mako
the appointment. â¢

Funds of the Murderer the Object of
Much Litigation.
The -threads of litigation are tangling

Police Lees and he is holding on to it
with almost childish stubbornness. Yes
terday the desire of the Chief received
material support from the courts. A writ
of Injunction was issued by Judge Hunt
at the instance of Edward W. Gunther,
who hup a claim of several hundred dol
lars against J. N. E. Wilson, who baa
made a demand on Lees to turn thÂ«
money over to him, and in the writ Lees
is enjoined from letting tne money leave
his hands until the claims of Gunther
have been adjudicated. The Chief will
appear before Judge Hunt to-day and
make a statement regarding his reasons
for withholding the money from Wilson
prior to the appearance of Gunther with
a demand for a portion of the funds of

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 30.
Josie, Eva and Kitty Hurt, the three
children of Joel J. Hurt, millionaire
stock owner of Wyoming, will be brought
Into court to-morrow morning to have
the question of their custody finally da.
elded. They are now with their mother
In the Chabot Home and in charge ot a
Deputy Sheriff.
Many circumstances have come to light
since yesterday which make it very plain
that there will be an extraordinary fight
for the three bright young girls. Al
phonso Schaeffer, who 1b married to their
mother, the divorced wife of Hurt, says
he Is being persecuted for an alleged
crime committed years ago, of which he
was not guilty. Schaeffer was employed
on a sheep ranch and was arrested for
stealing sheep. He was convicted and
sentenced to six years in Jollet prison.
At the expiration of a year and a half,
he was pardoned. He says that In Wy
oming there Is always a conflict between
sheep ranchers and cattle ranchers, owing
to the fact that sheep spoil pasttire lana
for cattle. On one occasion some un
marked sheep were found in his posses
sion, and the tremendous power of the
cattle barons was brought to bear against
him, with the result that he was con
victed. He says the best evidence of his
innocence was the fact that he was par
doned.
He declares that nothing can be proved
against his character, that he is a good
husband and stepfather and has been
working at his trade of carpenter arid
earning sufficient to support the family.
The little ones have grown to like him
and he declares he will assist his wife In
retaining possession of them.
Mrs. Schaeffer says that Hurt's stories

GOT NO GOLD, YET MULCTED
SHAREHOLDERS RECOVER ON
A JUDGMENT.
The Company Failed to File Reports
of Its Failure Before It Turned
Over on Its Back and
Died.
A suit filed In the United States Circuit
Court yesterday recalls a roseate mining
enterprise that came to grief on the yel
low waters of the Sacramento River threÂ«j
years ago.
In November, 1896. the newspapers were
full of mysterious hints of wonderfully
rich deposits of coarse and scale
gold In the bed of the Sacra
mento, and Intimations that some
Inventive genius had perfected a
new process whereby this wealth could
be easily and cheaply taken out with a
dredger. Among the several companies
formed for this purpose and receiving pat
ents for placer claims In the bed of the
Sacramento and the American River, near
the town of Folsom, was one with the at
tractive name of the Golden Sand Placer
Mining Company.
The company Incorporated, with a capi
tal stock of $1,000,000, divided into shares
of $10 eachâ a species of popular loan to
be repaid with Interest a hundred fold;
that is, of course, after deducting what
ever damages might accrue, in case the
weight of the gold should sink the valu
able dredger.
The enterprise on its face was plausible,
and there was no reason for believing
that It could be otherwise than profitable,
for It was known to the world that the
old bed of the American River was full
of gold, that It yielded millions In gold
from the days of '49 up to the present
time, and that the old ground was still
being worked at a profit. It was, there
fore, natural to infer that considerable
of the gold that came down the American
River must have been washed down as
far as the confluence of ihat river with
the Sacramento.
The Golden Sand Placer Mining Com
pany went to work, and after a brief sea
son of dredging found that there was no
gold in the bod of the Sacramento, and
not even under the bed. The company
thereupon dissolved and abandoned the
search for virgin treasure. But an ex
pensive lawsuit, remained behind for the
directors to wrestle with. Among the em
ployes of the company was Frederick
Ball, a subject of the kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland. He left the service
of the company, or was discharged, and
shortl" afterward began a suit in the Su
perior Court, accusing the directors of
violating the Penal Code by failing to
file a statement of receipts, disbursements
and other proceedings for the benefit of
the shareholders. Ball won the case and
obtained a Judgment for $1000.
Yesterday Charles H. Jackson, James
E. Damon and 8. T. Hubbell filed a suit
in equity against Frederick Ball and J.
M. Lewis and I. F. Chapman, the latter
two being assignees of Ball, asking for
an injunction to restrain the defendants
from the collecting the Judgment of $1000.
The complaint sets forth that the cor
poration did not do any mining and never
owned any mining property, and that
after failure to find the color in the
waters of the Sacramento the corporation
went out of existence. It alleges also
that the suit was brought by Ball from
motives of revenge, for having been dis
charged from the service of the cora-
pany.
In the Divorce Courts.
Mary L. Vorhea was granted a divorce
from Fred C, Vorhea yesterday on the
ground of â willful neglect. Elisabeth
Burkhardt has applied for a divorce from
George F. Burkhardt. alleging extreme
cruelty as a cauÃe of complaint. Mary
Hayden has asked for a divorce from her
husband, James Hayden, and aa a cause
of action Mrs. Hayden alleges desertion.
Etta Borenson was granted a divorce from
John A. Sorenson for desertion. The
plaintiff, -was allowed to resume her maid
of their pleasant life in Wyoming are
largely drawn from his imagination. She
declares that their ranch was eighteen
miles from any other house, and thai
her husband was frequently away for
months at a time, and also that he placed
young Millen, whom he afterward shot,
on the ranch for the purpose of looking
after it during his absence. She repudi
ates all his charges and asserts that all
she has done is to prevent her children
being taken from her. The decree of di
vorce awards her the children and. its
modification was made by the court with
out her knowledge and without the tak
ing of any testimony on her side.
For these reasons and for the further
reason that a judgment in Wyoming Is
not binding In any other State, the case
will have to be fought out entirely on its
merits upon such testimony as can be
obtained from the witnesses here and
possibly from depositions that may bÂ»
taken in Wyoming. Judge Gibson is pre
paring to make a very stubborn fight,
and with Gavin McNab and Milton Green
appearing for Hurt, an interesting con
test 13 expected.

train. Captain Anderson, foreman of tha
Pacific Mail docks, was also a passenger.

MERRITT WANTS A HOSPITAL SHIP
Suggests That Some of the Vessels Cap
tured by Dewey Might Be Utilized
for the Purpose.
BISRK.ETL.EY, Juno 30.â The folio-wing letter was received to-day by Mrs.
Colonel C. It. Greenleaf, president of the Berkeley branch of the Red Cross
Society, commending the idea of the hospital ship to be donated to the Gov
ernment by the Red Cross societies of the Pacific Coast:
War Department,
Office of' She Major General Commanding the Philippine Expedition
SAN FRANCISCO, CaL, June 27. 18Â»g"
Mrs. Charles R. Greenleaf, 2700 Bancroft "vVaj. BÂ«rkeley, Cal.â My
I*>ar Madam: I cannot too cordially recommend the project you have
In view. A hospital ship at Manila would be of great advantage to
our sick, and possibly wounded soldiers. The expense, as you state It,
would amount to a bagatelle so far as the benefit to a crew would be
concerned. T earnestly hope that you may be successful In securing
subscriptions sufficient to furnish a ship.
It has been suggested that some of the ships at Manila which were
captured by Admiral Dewey might be turned Into hospital ships and
I think well of the plan.
I hesitate tÂ» say more because of the conditions that may arise, but
If anything further should be necessary I will write you after arriv
ing at Manila. Very sincerely yours.
TT. MERRITT, Major General.
tertahied his hearers "with a eulogistic
account of the society's work and a Liriei

AFTER A SHUTOUT.

The Long Shot Silver Ring Takes
the 2:19 Trot at the
Remunerative Price of
12 to 1;
Those who Journeyed to Oakland j-os
terday to watch the racing went home
thoroughly imbued with the idea that
fast pacers are not always to be relied
on, for that fast little pacer, Little Thorn,
held by the bookies at 1 to 6, broke so
badly he was beaten by old Plunkett,
a 5 to 1 shot in the betting.
It was a three-horse race and many a
man marked his card prior to the start:
Little Thorn 1, Plunkett 2, Ketchum 3,
and fancied Little Thorn a 2:10 wiggler.
Hut a few took the field end at 3 to 10
for the son of Hawthorne, because of
being good winners on the day. It was |
paced In 2:15 and not near Thorn's true
form when steady.
Incidentally, the trotting record of the
track was lowered In the free-for-all trot
by the winner, Ethel Downs, 2:10, from
2:12% to 2:12%. It was an exciting finish
between Aster and Ethel, the latter un
der the whip- all the way down the
[ stretch. Monterey went away unsteady,
I but crept to a good position, rounding
the far turn, but when Williams made
his drive, went to a sprawling break,
otherwise it would have been a faster
heat and probably his. Ethel was 6to
5, Aster 2, and Monterey 3, all with sup
porters. The auctions sold with the field
at 7 to 5 for the daughter of Boodle.
Jimmy Sullivan's black mare, Sable
Francis, won the 2:30 trot in a drive from
Bertha R, sustaining the talent's good
opinion, as she was 3to 2. Ed Winship
showed, well driven by Walter Maben's
understudy. Brooks. The 2:19 trot went
to the rank outsider. Silver Ring, in
straight heats, she opening at 12 to l, but
for the second heat she was posted 7
to 5. Considerable coin was burned up
on the rattleheaded Mojave, and Addl-
Bon had lots of friends after the first
heat at 4 to 5, but early went into tho
air and couldn't get up. The winner
made no showing in her last race, but
Pete Williams rigged her with the hopples
and she could have stepped the track in
2:20 had It been necessary. They played
her at the price and made a good win
ning.
Iran Alto was distanced the first heat of
this last race, but Brooks trying his hand
with him in the special for named horses
got him away level and there was noth
ing to it, for the favorite, Brice McNeil,
at 6 to 5, made a dis;uÂ»iruus broait goins? '
to the first turn and had to do some tall
trotting to get into the money, but
through bad breaks of Nellie Bly and
Uncle Johnny secured place honors.
The free-for-all class stepped to the
half In liOSViâ a 2:10^2 clipâ showing the
condition 1 rackmaster Fleldwick has j
worked the course to. It is certain that
as the meeting progresses heats close to
tho 2:10 line will be witnessed and the
fast pacers now at the track will iD all j
probability give it the Pacific ~;oaa- rec
ord. To-day's card promises rare sport
and has two heat races with closely
matched candidates. The bookies are very |
liberal with their patrons as to prices and
It is as uncertain a game as the running
horses lead the talent. Summaries:

on one of his lightning trips from the

Bonanza and other high-paying creeks he
is rated as a millionaire. When he came
out from Dawson last fall he went to
England and there organized the North

MAY END IN
A RACE WAR
Trouble Over Soldiers'
Uniforms Still On.
WORKINGMEN ARE INDIGNANT
WARMLY COMMEND THE STAND
TAKEN B*; THE CALL.
I Building Trades Council Will Keep
Up the Agitation "Until the
Matter Is Satisfactorily
Settled.
The meetingr nf the Building Trades
Council; last night was a particularly in
teresting one, -the major portion of the
time bfing given to tho discussion of the
many pksises -which the controversy over
c nines. <V made. : uniforms has . taken.
Throughout the course of the evening, as
the various delegates rose, the stand ta
kenby The' Call on the matter was â¢warm
ly commended jis being compatible with
the best interests of the laboring classes.
Many men who have been prominent In
; the labor movement for years look upon
tho matter as having a deeper signift
: cance than appears on the surface, and
prcphc-py a race war If the matter Is not
sin-'dily and satisfactorily settled. In
' f;ut, the first step in this direction was
taken by the council last night, when a
j committee, consisting of P. H. McCarthy,
! \V. M. Page arid A. H. Coburn, was ap
pointed to arrange for a monster anti-
Chinese demonstration In the form of a
mass meeting arid parade. â ; -The ''commit-.'
: tee was given unlimited powers and will
be allowed to use its own judgment.
As an offset ;to various statements that
I the trouble has been settled with satis- .
faction to all parties the following reso
lutions were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, for sometime past the matter of the
manufacture of clothing for the United .States
'Commissary Department by Chinese has en
ga&ed the attention of the people of San Fran
cisto; and whereas, in a Memorial to the Cali
fornia delegation and War DHpartfnf?nt. Bent
by I^abor Commissioner Fitzgerald, the facts
concerning the. employment of Chinese were
plainly, clearly and conclusive!'- set forth, pre
â  Kenting indisputable evidence of the strength
â  and truth of the charges; and whereas. In. a
! denial of these charges, upon the investigation
j instituted by the secretary of War, Captain
Lone, quartermaster In charge, in a telegram
i addressed to Quartermaster-General Ludlng
ton, willfully misstated facts and Justified his
position by a false statement while the dally
press contained information from time to time,
stating the location and names of Chinese con-
I tractors who were openly engaged in the per
formance of these contracts; and whereas.
: while this Information was In the possession
of the entire public, with the exception of
those who blinded themselves to the facts for
selfish reasons and motives, the matter re
ceived extraordinary attention by the terml- |
nation of the life of one of the Chinese contrac- j
tors at the hands of his Jealous countrymen
lor underbidding others In the manufacture of i
clothing to be worn by the soldiers of the
United Ptates; and whereas, Labor Commis
sioner Fltzserald continued his investigation,
from time to time publishing the names and
places of the Chinese contractors where the
work still continued. Captain Long engaged
I the offices of the 'resident of the Chamber of
Commerce and president of the Hoard of Trade
! to Fu,stain his false position, and place the
1 stamp of approval upon his work as quarter
master in charge, using that most powerful
argument which at once frightens capital and
the business man, viz., "the withdrawal of
patronage." to the end that these gentlemen
subscribed their names to a telegram again
deceptive and misleading the official of the War
Department, to the effect that they of their
own personal knowledge knew of the cancel
lation of certain contracts by Captain Long,
where Chinese had been employed, and when at
tlie request of members of this council they
were asked to reveal the same, admitted that
Captain Long was the fount from which this
knowledge flowed, and that they could not
name tIK-m: and whereas, as a solution of the
matter, Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald agreed
to undertake the enforcement of the contracts,
provided he was furnished with a detailed
statement of the same, and placed this propo
sition In the hands of the president of the
Board of Tradeâ the same pressure has again
been used to Intimidate the weak selfish and
knavish business interests of San Francisco
by forcing an approval of the combined busi
ness associations of the city. In order that
a deaf ear might be turned to an official whom
they knew wcuia â  true to the work; there
fore, be it :
Kf-solved. That we place the stamp of ap
proval upon and extend our unqualified in
dorsement to th(i efforts of Labor Commis
sioner Fitzgerald, knowing the course hÂ«
has pursued to be in the Interest of right and
â Justice and In: behalf of the working people

B. JsTplan, ; , a tailor, - who ! applied â â¢. tii the
Commissary Department for a' fraction of
the enormous contract let three weeka
ago to the firm of Rothrhlld & Hoffman

"When I ascertained at the Commis
sary Department that it was utterly im
possible to get any of the work I applied
to Rothchikl & Hoffman, thinking that
since they undoubtedly had more; work
than they could finish in the stipulated
time, they wouifl be willing to sublet por
'â  -lions of the general contract to the retail
j dealers. This, after considerable discus
sion, they agreed to do on the terms that
for every dozen suits manufactured by
! me they would allow $4 75, they appropri
ating to their own use the remainder of
[ the $9, the price of the original contract
awarded by the Government. This I re
fused to accept, as did several other pmall
dealers, and, as a consequence of this re
i fusal to make the clothes for almost
I nrthfng, the contract Is being fulfilled in
Chinatown.
"The publication of this fact two weeks
ago and the general denouncement made
against the Commissary Department for
allowing the clothes to be made in China
town is generally believed to have been
beneficial and the means of creating the
effect to force the Hoffman firm to trans
fer their work to the shops of Ameri
cans This however, Is erroneous, as the
work is Rtill being performed by China
men, as can be proven by Labor Commis
sioner Fitzgerald and Mr. Dam of the
same office. â :
"Since the necessary clothes have been
mode in this city nobody but the influen
tial wholesale dealers and the Chinamen
have received the least benefit. Poor
women, many of them the widows of sol
diers have been repeatedly refused work,
and in addition to this refusal, treated
shamefully when they have applied for
It."
STREET COMMITTEE WORK.
The prospects are that the dilapidated
Cogswell fountain, which will be removed
from the Intersection of California, Mar
ket and Drumm streets, to make way for
a flagstaff from which Old Glory will be
floated, will soon find its way Into some
junk shop. Professor A. B. Sanford of the
Cogswell Polytechnic School requested
the Supervisors for permission to remove

Wednesday afternoon at' the. residence of
t\*.: Jones, 503 Franklin street. Shortly
a;fter;2 o'clock Mrs. Jones left her home
to do some shopping. When she returned
several hours later she was astounded to
find that the rear door had been broken
â open and the house thoroughly ran-,
sacked.
â¢V;'. The burglars : after gaining an entrance
first visited the bedroom, and with the
aid. of a jimmy broke open the bureau
drawers. â â â â .â â â â  â â â  â â >,â â â â :â â â .â â â .â â â  .â â :â :. â â â â .
Failing to find anything of value the
desperate crooks next attacked a hand
some dresser, Which was : in the back par- -.
lor. After almost demolishing it ..â¢: they '
took some valuable jewelry which they
found in one of the drawers. ': in another
room the house-breakers : discovered some
.more v jewelry, which they appropriated.
; It is believed they were frightened away,
as a bundle of clothing which they in
tended to carry off was found in the hall
â¢:way, evidently having: been dropped by
them In their haste to ; escape from the

Mrs. Jones values her loss at $500. She
has furnished the police with a descrip
tion of the stolen property and every
effort is being made to apprehend . the .
burglars. The detectives who ; are work- ,'/
ing on the case believe that the crime
; was committed by two peddlers who were
seen in the vicinity, acting in a suspicious â â 
manner.

arrested a young man, giving his ; name ..
as John Gilmore, and locked him up in V

men who "entered the Jones residence. ...
