THE LAW SAYS THAT PHELAN'S
SATELLITES ARE NOT RESIDENTS
EUGENE P. MURPHY, who was
induced by James D. Phelan to
register in a ward other than the
one in which he lives, In order
that he might become eligible for
the candidacy for Supervisor, says that
he has lost his vote. Will Mr. Mur
phy, or his adviser, Mayor Phelan, tell
an anxious public why, if his change
of residence was bona-fide and legal, he
has lost his vote thereby?
The contemplation of the law regard-
Ing the change of residence Is to pro
tect legal voters. If Mr. Murphy made
c legal change he Is as much entitled
to a vote In the Ninth Ward to-day as
he was when he made the change, and
If he desires to vote for his friend and
political adviser, James D. Phelan, he
should go to the Ninth Ward and offer
his vote to the judges. If he does so,
and if his vote is challenged, will he
Ewear it In? If there was no fraud In
the change of residence there will be
jione In voting in the new ward.
Jeremiah Deasy changed his resi
dence to the Tenth Ward after he was
nominated. He states specifically that
he will return to his old residence in
the Twelfth Ward after the election,
â¢whether he Is elected or not. If Mr.
Deasy's vote 1b challenged, and it un
doubtedly will be, will he swear that
he is a bona-flde resident of the Tenth
Ward? < I
THEIR NAMES SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF.
The best lawyers of the city state positively
that if the men who changed their residences
temporarily to become eligible as candidates are
elected they will not be entitled to their seats
and will be thrown out. This being undoubtedly
the law, the names of all men who have thus
trangressed the election law should be taken
from the tickets, whether they be Democrats,
Populists, Republicans, or of any other party.
Lewis Byington changed his residence
to the Seventh Ward after he was nom
inated. At his old home it is said that
he still iiVes there. At the Nob Hill
House It Ib said that he sleeps there
one night every week. Will Lewis F.
Byington, if his vote is challenged, and
It undoubtedly will be, swear that he is
a bona-flde resident at First and Harri
son streets?
Will Isadore Gutte swear that he did
not make a. temporary change of resi
dence in order to evade the law? Will
he swear, if his vote is challenged, that
he is, really and truly, a resident of
the Fifth Ward?
Lewis de F. Bartlett still holds his
room in the Eighth Ward and his land
lady was unaware of the fact of his
removal. When his vote is challenged
will he swear that he is a resident of
the Third Ward?
Will Isadore Gutte, Jere
miah Deasy, Lewis Bying
ton and Lewis de F. Bart
lett, the men whom James
D. Phelan said were better
than any man in the Third,
Fifth, Seventh and Tenth
wards, state under oath
that they are genuine resi
dents of the wards into
which they have moved ?
Will Eugene P. Murphy
swear in his vote in the
ward of which he said he
was a legal resident?
The law regarding change of resi
dence and registration was enacted for
the protection of honest voters. Ad
vantage of this law has been taken
lime and time again by men who de
sired to perpetrate frauds on the bal
lot box. Liouis Sternberg was sent to
the State Prison for doing this, and
when his sentence was commuted
Mayor Phelan criticized the Governor's
act of clemency and said:
"The offender should be
punished with life impris
onment without power of
pardon."
When Mephisto Phelan lures men
from their homes into cheap boarding
houses in order to evade election laws
â wherein does his act differ from that of
Sternberg? If Jeremiah Deasy is not
evading the election law why does he
retain his residence on Fulton street,
and why does he say he will return
there immediately after the election?
"Why is Bylngton at his home on Post
street every night if he lives at the Nob
Hill House on First and Harrison
streets? Why does Bartlett keep his
room at 607 Post street if he is a bona
f.de resident at the Coso House? Why
Jp it that Gutte spends so much time at
his cottage on Leavenworth street If
he is a resident of the Occidental Ho
tel?
Possibly these men are following: in
the footsteps of Faust when he fore
swore his vows. And Mephisto Phelan
rrav say to them, as his arch-prototype
said to Faust: "You are not the first
man who tried to climb to heaven on
the pr-oulders of the devil."
Since Phelan arrogated to himself the
position o< chief purifier of San Fran
cisco politics he possibiy Imagines that
lie can do no wrong, and what would
The San Francisco Call
WILL THEY SWEAR IN THEIR VOTES?
Mayor Phelan says there Is not an honest
Democrat in either the Third, Fifth, Seventh,
Ninth or Tenth wards, and in order that he
may not be compelled to associate with men
who do not wear kid gloves, he has colonized
those wards with his satellites from the aristo
cratic wards of the city. Of these men, Bying
ton, Bartlett, Deasy and Gutte have taken up a
residence in those wards, but retain their old
residences. The law regarding changes of resi
dence was made to assist honest voters. Will
these men swear that their change of residence
was bona fide ?

when done by this autocratic dictator.
Like a conqueror he billets his hench

because he finds no man, in the whole
of five wards, fit to look after the city's
affairs.
Almost one-half of the
city is devoid of men who
are fit to sit in council with
this silk hat, kid glove
Mayor.
Phelan says, and it cornea back in a
braying echo from Kearii* street, that
Borne of the wards have no residents.
If there are no residents, why put up
election boothÃ in those wards? Pos
sibly Phelan's idea of a resident is a
man who wears a silk hat and kid
gloves, and who does not h^ve to work
for a living. What do you men who
live in the Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth
and Tenth wards think of this? You
are not even good enough to be called
residents, but Phelan wants your votes.
JUST A CASE OF "BEFORE AND AFTER."
MR. JAMES D. PHELAN.
SAX FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20. 1898.
The subsidized Bulletin, which brays i
when Phelan laughs, follows the lead
of the dictator, and brazenly admits
that these men were sent into the ta
booed wards because there were no
honest men there. It makes no denial

and wanted The Call to investigate
something else and let this question of
residence alone.
Now that the matter has been
brought before the public it is claimed
that everything was done openly and
aboveboard. If this be true, why is
it that the candidates were so quietly
sneaked into the other wards, that at
their own homes it was not known that
their residences had been changed?
While the Examiner whines and the
subsidized Bulletin brays in pitiful at
tempt at Justification, Mephisto Phe
lan himself had a defense. And what
a defense! He did it because he wanted

following questions must be

honest men.
Honest men ! No man in
either the Third, Fifth, Sev
enth, Ninth or Tenth wards
as honest as a man ready
to perjure himself for po
litical preferment! And
while Phelan laughs and
the Subsidized Bulletin
brays, what do fhe people
of those wards think ?
Mayor Phelan says that a man who
will act a lie â live a lie â is better than
any man in almost half of the city.
There are undoubtedly many honest
Democrats, but what kind of men must
the Democrats of the Third, Fifth, Sev
enth, Ninth and Tenth wards be when
the boss of their party openly says that
none is as good as a man who will se
cure an election by fraud?
But there is another defense on the
part of the friends of Phelan. They
say that others have done it. That is
terribly true. Others have done it and
many of those voters have gone to the
penitentiary for doing it. Sternberg
did it, and when the Governor com
muted Steinberg's sentence Phelan
said that his imprisonment should be
for life.
The contention of Mayor Phelan and
also his newspaper supporters is that
what has been done is perfectly legal
and proper. Mr. Murphy, in his talk
with a Call reporter, said that he was
convinced that it was perfectly legal.
Mayor Phelan, in an interview pub
lished in the Examiner of October 19,
says: "The Call has been imposed
upon again. If I had been asked I cer
tainly would have advised Mr. Murphy
to qualify In the Ninth Ward according
to the old law; otherwise, if elected, the
courts might question his title to the
seat. There is not the least suspicion
of illegality about the temporary change
of residence."
The Examiner of the same date says:
"Now the poor Call, eager to smirch
Mayor Phelan, accuses him of getting
Mr. Murphy unlawfully to change his
residence, so as to qualify as a candi
date in the Ninth Ward. As a matter
of fact, there being absolutely no-thing
wrong in the matter, Mr. Murphy
changed his residence temporarily on,
the advice of the convention commmlt
tee."
To a Call reporter Mayor Phelan said:
"I was not consulted in this matter, but
had they consulted me I certainly
would have advised the course taken.
I would have done it myself had I been
in their position."
The Examiner and Mayor Phelan are

TERRIBLE CRUSH
AT GREAT PEACE
JUBILEE PARADE
Heroes of Two Wars March Past
the President and Are Cheered
by Multitudes.
Never Before h|ave Such Vast Crowds Assem
bled ii) Chicago, and Disaster Is
Narrowly Averted.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, Oct. 19.â One brief gleam
of sunshine, and only one, has been
thrown upon the ceremonies of the
Peace Jubilee. It was a fleeting, short
lived burst of third-class sunshine, but
It fell upon the President's reviewing
stand Just as the head of the great
Jubilee parade was approaching, and
the dense crowd which lined the streets
accepted it as an augury of better
things and cheered lustily, but before j
they were half through with their i
Bhouts the little shudder of light was
gone and the cold, dark, dismal weather
that from the first has dampened, fig
uratively and literally, the jubilee fes
tivities, was on again in full force.
Chicago has seen many parades
greater than that of to-day, but she
has never seen one that pleased her j
people better, nor has there ever been j
a parade in this city which has been
witnessed by so many people. The
crowds in the streets were larger than
those which witnessed the great pa
rade at the time of the dedication of
the World's Fair buildings, almost ex
actly six years ago. There were more
stands â the larger stands erected for
sightseers â than have ever been seen
here before. All were filled to the ut
most, and the number of people that
filled the streets was such as has
never been seen in this city before.
Notwithstanding the most elaborate ar
rangements of the Police Department
the banishing of every street car and
vehicle of every description from the
downtown streets, in order that the
crowd might have an unobstructed
way, there were times to-day when the j
crowd was too great for the police to ,
handle, and at many places the crush |
at times was dangerous. This was not \
the fault of the Police Department or |
of anybody. It was simply that the
throng was greater than anybody had
expected, and simply the geometrical
proposition that a larger body cannot
be crowded into a smaller space.
After the parade the jam in Jackson
boulevard in front of the Union League
L'lub house was frightful. Strong de
tachments of police, soldiers and ma
rines while attempting to arrest the
Ojassingof the crowd were pushed back,
hudfdied together and finally broken--up
and scattered by the sheer weight of
the throng. Long after the parade
was over the boulevard was a mass of
surging, struggling humanity, which
would not move and which could not
be moved until it pleased.
The greetings extended to the Presi
dent were enthusiastic in the extreme,
as were the plaudits showered upon
General Miles and General Shafter as
they passed throueh the streets. The
President in his carriage was surround
ed by members of the Chicago Hus
sars, formed in a square, and detach
ments of the Grand Army and of Con
federate veterans acted as an escort.
He led the parade from the starting
point at Congress street and Michigan
avenue to the Union League Club
house, where, in company with all other
distinguished guests, he alighted and
reviewed the parade. Throughout the
entire march past the stand, which
lasted a trifle 0%-er three hours, the
President remained standing, nor did
he take a seat until after the platoon
of police which formed the protecting
line for the rear of the parade had
passed down the boulevard.
The Presidential party arrived at 1
o'clock. As fhe distinguished guests
blighted from their carriages they were
welcomed by Secretary Clark of the
Union League Club, and immediately
taken to the reviewing stand. A
mighty cheer went up from the crowd
as President McKinley took his place
on the stand, escorted by Alex H. Re
l-ell. The following were among those
on the President's stand: Secretary
and Mrs. Gage, Secretary Bliss, Secre
tary and Miss Wilson, Postmaster Gen
eral Smith, General Miles, General
Shafter, General Duffleld, General Cor
bin, Samuel E. Morse, Governor Mount
of Indiana, Mayor Malster of Balti
more, Mayor Maybury of Detroit, Ad
miral George Brown, the Chinese and
Korean Ministers, Samuel Gompers,
Judge Emory Speer, Assistant Secre
tary Meikeljohn, Libert K. Holden,
Senor Quesada, Mayor Thomas Tag-
Kart, General A. W. Greely and wife,
Governor Barnes of Oklahoma, Clark
Howell, Governor Scofleld of Wiscon
sin, Archbishop Ireland, ex-Vice Presi
dent Adlai E. Stevenson and wife,
Booker T. Washington and Dr. and
Mrs. W. R. Harper and Captain Mc-
Calla.
In the reviewing stand proper there
were the President, General Miles, Gen-
eral Shafter, both in full uniform; Gov
ernor Tanner, Mayor Harrison and
Chairman Truax of the Jubilee com
mittee.
The advance of the parade after the
presidential escorts had wheeled out of
iha line of march was given to the vete
rans of the Grand Army, who were
present in great numbers. Several of
the post* carried gauzy old banners
that had wawed in battle thirty-five
pears ago, and to every one of the tat
tered nags the President called the at
tention of those about him, and every
head was bare until the flag had gone
by. Behind the veterans of a former
War came numerous civil societies, rank
after rank, until it seemed as though
they would never end. Their gay uni
forms, bright with warm colors, and
their many hues, stripes and sizes,
made a brilliant and glowing pano
rama. Among them were the Clan Na
Gael Guards of Chicago in full force,
Â£00 strong, without weapons. Not a
man carried a rifle, not an officer a
fcword. As the ranks of the regiment
went past the reviewing stand a white
gloved hand was at every cap to salute
the President, and in protest, it was
(aid, against the action taken by Gov
trnor Tanner last spring regarding the
Seventh Infantry itself, an Irish regi
ment, for marching on St. Patrick's
lay in the same parade as the Clan Na
Gaels, the latter not being a State or
ranizatlon, and having, according to
the statutes of Illinois, no right to pa
rade under arms without the special
permission of the State government.
After these came the Fourth regular
Infantry from Fort Sheridan and then
such of the fighting men of Chicago
who have returned from the war. As
the military division, commanded by
brigadier General Fltzsimmons of the
Illinois National Guard, approached the
fevlewing stand the enthusiasm of the
jrowd knew no bounds. A Niagara of
cheers wÂ«nt up aa in close set ranks the j
men of the naval reserve went by.
Rightly or wrongly, the people of Illi
nois believe with all their hearts and
all their souls that no States in the
Union sent better sailors to the front
than did she, and full of pride at the
achievements of the navy in which
these boys had borne a part, they
greeted them with waving handker
chiefs and flags and cheers that
brought the red blood to the cheeks of
the marching boys. Then bright in
new uniforms the Fourth regulars, un
der the command of Major Baker, came
in sight. The ranks of the regiment
which were sadly thinned In Cuba- were
up again to nearly full strength, and
notwithstanding the many recruits in
the ranks the regiment marched in su
perb style, and from first to last the
crowd was with them. The First Illi
nois, which gave more lives during the
war than any Illinois body of enlisted
men, set the people frantic, the com
bination of local pride and patriotism
being too much for a crowd not con
servative and to-day on edge with pa
triotism and excitement. The Seventh
Infantry closed the parade, and its
solid, well filled ranks were a long time
in passing. Its brilliant marching and
well worn uniforms added to the en
thusiasm, and Colonel Kavanaugh and
his men were greeted in a manner that
none of them will eyer forget.
Directly the Seventh Infantry had
passed the President left the reviewing
stand, going into the clubhouse. Three
cheers were given him as he left, and
three cheers were near to being the
death signal for many people. All day
long the pressure of the crowd on the
police lines at the two ends of the
square in the center of which the Union
League clubhouse is situated had been
enormous. Time after time the utmost
efforts of the officers had been unable
to withstand the weight of the crowd.
Their Jines had been frequently broken
and the officers were well nigh ex
hausted with their long hours of hard
work.
Tighter and tighter the crov 1 became,
and then came from women and men
cries of distress and calls for help. A
large stand had been erected on the
north side of the square, opposite the
clubhouse, on vacant ground^ upon
which the new Postoffice is in course of
erection. All alc-ng the edge of this
stand hands were reached to the strug
gling crowd below, and hundreds ol
men, women and children were dragged
anyhow, everyhow by thÂ« arms and legs
and shoulders into the stand above.
Cloaks, overcoats and dress skirts were
in shreds and in numerous instances
torn completely from the body of the
wearer as the rescuers above dragged
them hastily over the railings. In many
instances some of those who were be
ing hauled from the Jam would be half
way up to safety, when those below
would attach themselves with a frantic
clutch to the upgoing man or wc-man.
and then between the pulling above and
the pulling below the person in the mid
dle would have a sorry minute or two.
The crowd still lingered in front erf the
clubhouse and called for the President.
He was at luncheon, but the crowd
would not be denied and the President
stepped once more on the reviewing
stand, accompanied by President Revell
of the Union League Club. As soon as
quiet had been restored he spoke as fol
lows:
I witness with pride and satisfaction
the cheers of the multitude as veterans of
the civil war on both sides of the con
test have br-en reviewed. I witness with
Increasing pride the wild acclaim of the
people as they watch the volunteers and
regulars and our naval reserves â the
guardians of the people of land and sea â
pass before your eyes. The demonstra
tion of to-day iÂ» worth everything â every
thing to our country, for I read in the
faces and hearts of my countrymen the
purpose to see to it that this great Gov
ernment, with Its free institutions, shall
never perish from the surface of the
earth. (Great applause.)
I wish I might take the hand of every
patriotic man, woman and child here to
day. But I cannot do that (voice from
the crowd. "But you've got our hearts"),
and so I leave with you not only my
thanks but the thanks of the great na
tion for your patriotism and devotion to
the flag-. (Great cheering.)
After the conclusion of the Presi
dent's remarks there were loud calls for
General Miles and General Shafter, but
neither of these gentlemen would make
his appearance, and the crowd, after
cheering the President as he left the
clubhouse for the home of. Captain Mc-
Williams, slowly dispersed.
IMPOSING PEACE
JUBILEE BANQUET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 19.â For the third
time since the commencement the
Jubilee festivities were shifted to the
interior of the Auditorium, and the
third and last scene to be enacted
within the great hall was the most
brilliant, beautiful and successful of
them all. It was the great national
peace Jubilee banquet, tendered to the
President of the Ur f ed States and dis
tinguished guests by the citizens of
Chicago. No similar event ever held
within the auditorium surpassed in
brilliancy and simple elegance the ban-
Quet of to-night.
Twelve hundred guests, among them
men nrominent in all branches of busi
ness, science, art and war, were stand
ing by their chairs when a tap from
the gavel of Franklin McVeasrh. the
presiding officer, announced the ap
proach of President McKlnley. The or
chestra struck, "Hall to the Chief."
and as the strains of the old welcom
ing march were heard the President,
attended by the jubilee reception com
mittee, came down the center aisle,
bowing right and left In acknowledg
ment of rthe applause his presence
evoked s
At 10 o'clock, the preliminary portion
of the banquet having been disposed of,
a rap from the gavel of Chairman Me-
Veagh claimed the attention of the
guests, and introduced President Mc-
Klnley, announcing that he would re
ply to the toast, "Our Country"
It was several minutes before the
cheering had subsided sufficiently to al
low the President to be heard, and
when he was afforded an opportunity
he made an address, his utterances be
ing greeted with prolonged applause.
Other toasts were responded to by
Clark Howell, ex-Vlce-President Ste
venson, General Miles, General Shafter,
Captain Slgsbee, President Angell of
the "Michigan University, Secretary
Gage, Admiral Brown and President
Northrup of the University of Minne
sota.

Conflict.
WARSHIPS ARE MADE READY

CANNOT RECEDE.
Newspapers at London and Paris
Concede That the Two Countries
Are Likely to Engage in
Hostilities.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 19.â 1n spite of semi
official denials, the Echo de Paris as
serts to-day that the embarkation of
war material and supplies continues at
Toulon, adding that extraordinary ac
tivity reigns at the arsenal there. Four
ironclads and three cruisers are em
barking ammunition and war material.
Two transports are almost ready for
sea.
All French naval officers on leave of
absence have been recalled. The naval
authorities at Toulon are very reticent.
The Matin says Premier Bnsson,
through ill health, wishes to retire from
the Cabinet. His successor may be M.
Bourgeoise, now Minister of Education.
A dispatch to the Petit Parisienne
from Toulon confirms the report* of
the Echo de Paris and says the great
est activity prevails in the navy-yard,
where work is proceeding with fever
ish speed day and night.
LONDON, Oct. 19.â Sir Michael Hicks
Beach, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
speaking at North Shields this evening,
announced that the Government had
opened negotiations with the French
with a view of securing to the subjects
of the various powers the right of "de
veloping the respective spheres in
which each country is interested.
Regarding the Fashoda question, he
said he wished cordially to acknowl
edge the desire evidenced in the
speeches of -^ord Rosebery and Her
bert Asquith to help the Government
in the matter.
"It is impossible," he said, "for
France to maintain that she had rights
at Fashoda. She asked for time to re
ceive Major Marchand's report, but un
til the contrary is proved I decline to
believe that France will refuse to with
draw. If she refused, the matter would
assume an aspect as grave as is possi
ble between two great nations.
"The Government is animated by the
friendliest spirit toward France, and
does not wish to inilict humiliation.
What we desire is fair treatment. Our
work in Egypt is not completed. Africa
is big enough for us both â for France
in the west and ourselves In the east.
Surely we ought to be able to agree to
respect one another's rights and
claims.
"I hope, trust and believe the ques
tion Is capable of a friendly solution,
but this country has put her foot down.
If unhappily another view should be
taken by France, the Oueen's Minis
ters know what their duty demands.
It would be a great calamity if, after
peace for upward of eighty years, our
friendly relations should be disturbed
and we should be launched into a great
war, but there are greater evils than
war, and we shall not shrink from any
thing that is coming; knowing that we
axe supported by a united people."
The speech of Sir Michael Hicks
Beach at North Shields last evening
has deeply impressed England and the
utmost concern is felt as to how France
will receive it. The idea has been preva
lent that the French have not realized
how seriously England felt on the
Fashoda question, which has been
coupled "With a desire that France
wcmld not force England to an armed
support of Lord Salisbury's stand. Most
of the morning papers elaborate some
of the excited declarations of the bel
ligerent preparations of France.
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
Mail says: "In Toulon and Brest every
nerve is strained to get ready for war,
which may break out on short notice.
The Paris press is growing more and
more determined to back up extreme
measures, even a resort to arms. The
French have been excessively piqued
by the threatening tone of the English
papers, which is a more likely casus
belli than the mere question of Fash
oda. Consequently the outlook here is
grave. There are reports of troops hur
rying from Paris to Brest and Toulon.
The artillery 'in the batteries and at
the various ports have been constantly
instructed lor any emergency and the
cajnnon at the forts and batteries are
alj ready for action at any moment.
Tq-day there was a prolonged war
council at Brest of the chiefs of the
various services and M. Lockroy is
hastily returning to Toulon on account
of the gravity of the situation."
The Paris correspondent of the
Standard says: "If England keeps on
saying that Marchand must go, France
will reply that Marchand will stay, and
If he be removed forcibly there can be
little doubt as to what the conse
quences will be."
On the other hand the Paris corre
spondent of the Daily Graphic says:
"I have good reason for stating that
Count Muravieff (the Russian Foreign
Minister) has discouraged French re
sistance in the matter of Fashoda."
Most of the papers, however, refuse
to accept the explanation that French
activity is merely in pursuance of M.
Lockroy's scheme. Several exhort the
Government to answer the prepara
tions of France by mobilization of the
British fleet. Some of the more con
servative organs, notably the Times,
completely ignore the French move
ments and decline to perceive any war
cloud.
The Daily Chronicle remarks: Sir
Michael Hicks Beach has been at It
again. He is a dangerous man. He
has honesty without tact.
Other p&pers hin| that the plain
speaking of the Chancellor at a time
when a crisis Is approaching is an in
discretlon.

EXCITING FOOTBALL
PLAYED IN THE EAST.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 19.â The Wes
leyans gave the Pennsylvania football
team the hardest game of the season, the
red and blue winning by the score of 18
to 0 In twenty-five minute halves. In the
second half the Middletown boys went
through Pennsylvania's line repeatedly
for gains of from two to six yards. This
was in a measure due to the absence of
Hedges and McOracken, who retired at
the end of the first half.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 19.â Harvard
defeated the football team of the Newton
Athletic Association this>afternon In two
ten minute halves by a' score of 22 to 0.
The game was played in a heavy down
pour of rain. Newton had a fairly strong
team, containing four Harvard players.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 19.â Yalethis
afternoon defeated Brown University in
a hard fought game of football by a score
of 26 to 6. Brown's single touchdown was
made on a fumble by Benjamin, the Yale
halfback, about two minutes before the
end of the game, when Yale had her op
ponents all tired out and was mowing
them down in awful rushes.* The game
was a revelation to all of the spectators
in that the lighter Yale line, after the
first three minutes of play, held the heavy
rush line of Brown repeatedly, and when
on the defensive tore great holes through
which the backs went for sure gains.

had only a few passengers. All of the
Yukon river steamers had gone into win-
ter quarters.
The Boanoke brought down about 350
pasengers and gold dust estimated at
$1,500,000. About a milion dollars was the
property of three corporations, the North
American Transportation and Trading
Company, the Canadian Bank of Com
merce and the Bank of British North

LILIUOKALANI NOW
DEMANDS THE FLAG
Desires to Secure the Banner That
Formerly Waved Over Her
Palace in Honolulu.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â A Louisville
(Ky.) special to the Herald says: Ex-
Queen Liliuokalani has made a demand
upon Miss Anna Berry, daughter of Con
gressman Albert S. Berry of Newport, for
the return of the royal Hawaiian flag
which formerly waved over her palace in
Honolulu. The flag, with other property,
was seized by the Provisional Govern
ment. When the party of Congressmen
went to Hawaii before annexation Mr.
Berry, who was a member, took his
daughter with him. President Dole met
the vivacious lady and presented to her
the flag. The flag is sixteen feet wide
by thirty-five feet long, and has eight
stripes of alternate red, white and blue.
In the center of the flag is the coat of
arms of the now deposed royal family of
Hawaii. The fla^ was made by Mrs.
Malia Kahia, who presented it to ex-
Queen Liliuokalani. Her name is written
in ink on the upper- stripes of the flag.
Miss Berry says she will not part with
the flag despite all of the ex-Queen's de
mands for It.
INCOMPETENCE OF THE
HOSPITAL ATTACHES.
Dr. Frye Gives Some Bather Candid
Testimony Before the War
Investigators.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 19.â The
War Investigation Commissioners held
their sessions in the City Hall to-day, ex
amining a large number of regimental
and other officers. One of the most out
spoken witnesses of the day was Dr. Frye
of the Third Division hospital. He con
demned some of the methods in vogue
in the hospitals, and said that in many
cases the contract physicians and mem
bers of the hospital corps were incompe
tent.
Dr. Frve said that in all the hospitals
with which he had been connected there
had been a deficiency of bed linen.
Dr. Frye expressed the opinion that in
several instances convalescents had been
sent away from the hospital before they
were sufficiently advanced to permit
them to go in Safety. He had no per
sonal knowledge of any individual cases
of this kind, but was satisfied that such
cases had occurred.
He spoke in very uncomplimentary
terms of the men engaged in the hos
pital corps, saying they had been picked
up at random over the country and were
â â¢generally a scabby looking lot," not fit
to adorn any walk of life. He also
spoke deprecatingly of the contract sur
geons, saying that he would not be will-
ing to trust his family or friends to 60
per cent of them.
"Many of them," he said, "are recent
graduates from medical institutions, and
I do not consider the average medical
graduate capable of taking charge of
from twenty-five to fifty typhoid fever
casea."

Report of a Serious Naval En
gagement With Native
Insurgents,
Said to Have Been Caused by a Refusal to Lower
the Rebel Flagâ Losses Were Sustained
on Both Sides.
I OXDOX, Oct. 20.â The Madrid correspondent of the
:*â Times says:
Captain Aunon, the Minister of Marine, has received a
dispatch from Manila announcing a naval engagement between
the Americans and the rebels in consequence of Admiral Dewey
forbidding the latter to fly the rebel flag from their ships.
The dispatch adds that there were losses on both sides but
that the Americans captured the rebel ships.
The scene of the engagement is not stated, but it is sup
posed to have been Manila Bay.
A Confirmatory Suggestion
A CONFIRMATORY SUGGESTION.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19.â As far as could be ascer
tained, no information regarding the reported naval engage
ment in the Philippines has been received at the Navy Depart
ment, nor has General Otis, commanding the United States
troops at Manila, made any reference to it in any communica
tions he may have made to the War Department.
The dispatch created considerable interest here.
Recently the newspapers contained a statement that Ad
miral Dewey had dispatched one or two of his ships to another
portion of the Philippine group on a mission of some import
ance, and the suggestion is made unofficially that it may have
been these vessels which have been engaged in combat with
the insurgents.

EXPRESS COMPANIES
MADE MOST UNEASY
Their Tactics in Cinching Shippers
May Cause a Heavy Loss in
Their Business.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 19.â Officers of the va

In St. Louis are much worried over a
pamphlet which has just been issued by
the National Association of Traffic Com
missioners in regard to the payment of
the war stamp tax on express receipts
and containing suggestions for the exten
sion of the parcel post in the United
States.
The work is designed to bring about a
general movejnent all over the country
to have the Interstate commerce law
changed so as to place express companies
â¢under the jurisdiction of the Interstate
Commerce Commission and to regulate
express companies In other ways.
What the express companies object to
tnr.pt is a suggestion to improve and ex
tend fhe parcel post system in the United
States. The operation of the parcel post
system as proposed would deprive the ex
press companies of nearly half of their
revenue as they could not compete with
the postal rates," and they will make a de
termined fight to prevent the loss of
Burh a large part of thf-lr business.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 19.â When consid

by the House of Deputies of the Episco
pal convention, article VI, relating to the
establishment of missionary districts. and
article XI, relating to a bishop's exercise
of his offices outside of his diocese, were
agreed to with amendments adopted by
the Bishops.
The morning session of the House of
Bishops was spent in bringing about the
adoption of what is known as the "Hunt
lngton amendment looking toward church
unity." The amendment authorizes bish
ops to take under their spiritual guidance
congregations which accept the essential
tenets of the church, although they do
not strictly observe the church ritual.
The amendment was adopted with minor
changes as part of the canons instead of
the constitution. The canons also were
amended in requiring one year's time be
fore ordination instead of six months.
The revision of the constitution pro
gressed by the adoption of the title and
articles X and XI. also articles VII and

died a few hours later.
The cause of the quarrel is unknown,
but It is supposed it resulted from a
dispute about the work.

SPANIARDS YET
SEEKING DELAY
Americans Grant Them
Further Time.
CLEVER GAME OF DIPLOMACY
DONS BEGIN TO BEALIZE THAT
UNCLE SAM IS FTBM.
Going Behind the Protocol Not Per
mitted in the Negotiations
for the Treaty of
Peace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 19.â The Spanish Com
mission was unable to attend the Joint
session to-day, and the next session of
the two commissions has been fixed
for Friday next.
Judge Day, president of the American
Commission, received a communication
this morning from Senor Rios, presi
dent of the Spanish Commission, say
ing that advices expected, but not re
ceived, from Madrid made it necessary
for himself and his colleagues to re
quest a postponement of any further
conferences until Friday next. A cour
teous reply was returned by Secretary
Moore In behalf of the American Com
missioner, granting an extension of
the time for the next meeting was re
quested.
While the deferring of any one con
ference for two days Is in Itself not an
Important request, the delay by the
Spaniards at this juncture is something
more than significant. The game of
diplomacy now progressing here has
reached a stage which makes it neces
sary that the next move be made by
the Spanish Commissioners. They are
confronted by the plain fact of their
protocol agreement to relinquish and
evacuate Cuba without "ifs," "ands" or
"buts." It has become clear here that
the Spaniards cherished the hope that
they could be made to follow a given
path and ultimately wander elsewhere
and do less or more than named in the
"protocol compact. The American Com
missioners, however, have firmly ad
hered to the boundary lines already
mutually established and within which
they insist the Spaniards, as well as
themselves, shall duly proceed.
It is not too much to say that Spain
now has more light than ever before
on the integrity and steadfastness in
word and In purpose of the United
| States. Nor is it wide of fact to say
that the Spaniards are now initially
appreciating that the United States did
not make war on Spain to acquire Cuba
as a conquest prize.
Of this the Spaniards may not yet be
wholly convinced, but the firm refusal
of Judge Day and his colleagues to as
: sume the Cuban debt, because the
! United States would not take over the
I sovereignty, has widened Spanish per
ceptions and has unquestionably has
tened their convictions, wherefore It
| may, in a sense, be true that, having
I for the first time a feeling that Ameri
i can pledges and American performance
i are coequal terms, the Spaniards are
now practically on the threshold of
properly lighted negotiations.
The Americans yesterday held a brief
i session, having no reference to the ne
1 gotiations, and the brevity of these
j meetings and other indications warrant
i the deduction that the American atti
! tude is well formed, and that the com
; mission is thoroughly advised on all
> the points and features which It Is
possible to foresee in subsequent con
ferences.
The amount of information acquired
by the Americans since their arrival
here is large. They have examined old
residents of the Philippine Islands and
the Information from this and other
sources is valuable.

Important Work Being Done by
United States Coast Survey-
Parties in Alaska.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 19.-Three coast
survey parties were sent to Alaska this
season, one to Southeastern Alaska, one
to Prince William Sound, near Copper
River, and the third and largest party
to the mouth of the Yukon. The party
In Southeastern Alaska was engaged In a
survey about the head of Lynn Canal. In
the country â  through which the Interna
tional boundary passes, and secured full
topographic information for the study of
that question. This party has returned.
The party on Prince William Sound has
been engaged in making a survey of the
region around the mouth of the Copper
River, and up to V aides. It is well known
that Copper River is n<rc navigable, hav
ing a shallow mouth with numerous chan
nels and a large bar. The survey of
Prince William Sound, however, is urgent
ly needed as settlements are going on
constantly in the neighborhood of Valdez
and much shipping is sent there.
From the report of the director of the
Geological Survey upon the production of
crude petroleum for the year 1897, which is
now in the hands of the printer, it is
shown that California yielded 1,903,411 bar
rels, which is an Increase of 51.93 per cent
over that of 1R96.

HAROLD FREDERIC
CALLED TO REST
Deatl) Claires the Famous London
Correspondent and An)erican
Novelist.
HAROLD FREDERIC, WHO DIED YESTERDAY.
LONDON, Oct. 19.â Harold Frederic, the London correspondent of
the New York Times, died at Henley of heart disease. He had
been ill for some time, but recently had much improved in
health.
Harold Frederic was not only a distinguished novelist but
also one of the cleverest correspondents ever sent by an American
newspaper to London. It was in Central New York that Frederic was
born, and it is there he passed his childhood days and his young man
hood. He enjoyed greatly to tell how he gained his first opinions of
the alphabet from a strenuous and enduring study of the letters on
an empty soap box. At an early age he was induced by his parents to
arise at 5:30 a. m., and distribute supplies of milk among the worthy
populace.
His book. "In the Sixties," which contains "The Copperhead, Mar
sena " "Thp War Widow," "The Eve of the Fourth" and "My Aunt
Susan," breathes the spirit of the Civil War as felt and endured at
the homes.
Stephen Crane recently wrote this of Frederic:
But there is something dismally unfortunate in the passing of "Setn*B
Brother's Wife," "In the Valley," the historical novel, and "The Lawton
Girl " Of course, they all had their success in measure, but here was a
chance and a reason for every American to congratulate himself. An
other thing had been done. For instance, "In the Valley" is easily the
best historical novel that our country- has borne. Perhaps It is the only
rood one. "Setn's Brother's Wife" and "The Lawton Girl" are rimmed
with fine portrayals. There are writing men who. in some stories, dash
over three miles at a headlong pace, and in an adjacent story move like
a boat being sailed over plowed fields; but in "Frederick" one feels at
once the perfect evenness of craft, the undeviatlng worth of the workman
ship The excellence is always sustained, and these books form, with
"In the Sixties." a row of big American novels. But if we knew it we
made no emphatic sign, and it was not until the appearance of "The

MANILA, Oct. 19.â Insurgent General
Pio Pllar has agreed to evacuate Pico,
the last suburb of Manila held by the
Filipinos, on October 25. This com
pletes the American conquest of the
city. The last rebel was driven from
Cavite to-day. The Americans now
hold Cavite and Manila and the rest of
the Island of Luzon is In the hands of
insurrectionist factions. How little
power Agulnaldo possesses is shown by
his refusal to grant passes to visit the
interior on the ground that the northern
provinces are held by General Maka
boulas, who is in revolt against the
Malolos government.
General Aguinaldo has shown good
faith in securing Pio Pilar's consent to
evacuate Pico, although the rumor is
persistently circulated that the rebel
leaders have promised their soldiers,
who are growing restless, that an at
tack will be made on Manila before the
end of the present month. As a mat
ter of fact Pio Pllar, who is chief of the
anti-American party, has been reduced
and is practically under arrest by
Aguinaldo.

AGUINALDO'S INFLUENCE
NOW ON THE WANE.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Major General Otis cabled
the War Department to-day a review
of the situation in the Philippines,
showing that Aguinaldo's Influence is
on the wane. General Otis stated that
Aguinaldo's forces are being rapidly
depleted. Many of the deserters are
joining the Spanish party, apparently
because of their belief in the possibility
that the islands may be returned to
Spain.
The situation is peaceful, and there
is little danger of trouble between the
natives and Americans, and General
Otis expressed confidence in his ability
to fully cope with any developments.
Secretary Alger late this afternoon
sent a copy of the dispatch to the State
Department, and it is expected that it
will be cabled to the American Com
missioners in Paris. Adjutant General
Simpkins, who has just returned to
Washington, brought with him from
Manila all of the correspondence which
has passed between Rear Admiral
Dewey and Major General Merritt and
Aguinaldo. This correspondence shows
conclusively that the American officers
entered into no alliance implied or di
rect with Aguinaldo, and that the
hands of this Government are tied in
no way as the result of the co-opera
tion of the insurgents. Some of the
more important passages of the corre
spondence have been cabled to Paris,
and complete copies were forwarded to
the commissioners by mall to-day.
ADMIRAL DEWEY NOT
COMING ON LEAVE.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long denied to-day the report that
Rear Admiral Dewey will come to the
United States on leave of absence. It
is expected that Rear Admiral Schley
will return from Porto Rico on a mer
chant steamer, as the Newark is want
ed at St. Thomas to make an investiga
tion of the coaling question existing
there. Admiral Schley's name has been
connected with the succession to Rear
Admiral Bunce as commandant of the
Brooklyn navy yard, but it is not at
all certain that he will have this as
signment. Rear Admiral Howell is his
senior, and as the department generally
considers seniority in making selec
tions for important positions it is re
garded as likely that Rear Admiral
Schley will be ordered to duty as presi
dent of the examining and retiring
boards while Rear Admiral Howell will
go to New York or some other impor
tant navy-yard.

REA PAINTED
BY A CLEVER
WORD ARTIST
Santa Clara's Boss as
Seen by Delmas.
TRUTHS IN STRONG RELIEF
DEVELOPED IN ARGUMENT IN
THE SLANDER SUIT.
Vainglorious Arrogance of tha De
fendant Made Light of Slan
dering Jarman, a Highly
Respected Citizen.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
SAN JOSE, Oct. 19.â Attorney Delmas
outpointed the opposing counsel in the ;
Jarman-Rea slander suit to-day, and In
spite of all efforts to shut him out was
allowed to make a supplemental open
ing argument. The entire forenoon was
occupied in arguing the matter, and
just before noon Judge Kittredge de
cided Delmas had the right to address
the jury, even if the defendant's coun
sel did not. He limited Delmas' argu
ment to two hours. The trap set by
Attorneys Morehouse and Burchard
failed to catch Delmas. Burchard and
Morehouse will now both address the
jury. This has changed the proposed
order of things an dthere will be a flow
of oratory for the balance of the week.
The courtroom was packed to-day and
many were unable to secure seats.
At the opening of the afternoon ses
sion Delmas began his argument. He
said his associate, A. H. Jarman, had
so fully presented the case that he
would only touch upon the verdict and
the damages expected at the hands of
the jury. This was a delicate subject
for his associate, because his father was
the plaintiff. Delmas stated he was
counsel for Jarman and no one else,
and the compensation he would receive
was from him and no one else. He made
this statement because at the report
that he was representing some political
organization. Such reports were de
nounced as false.
Delmas said the charge of slander
had been fully and entirely proved, and
that there could be no doubt in the mind
of any person who had heard the evi
dence. On March 14, IS9B, Rea had ac
cused Jarman of receiving a bribe on
the purchase of the street steam roller
and it had been proved that Rea made
such an utterance. This statement by
Rea was declared to be false and slan
derous.
In his answer the defendant attempt- I
ed to mitigate his act and throw him- i
self upon the mercy of the jury. Del
mas read the testimony in which Rea 'â â 
claimed Jarman's use of the words ;
"liar, scoundrel and boodler" caused
him (Rea) to make use of the slander
ous words against him while in the
heat 01 passion.
"The answer, though made under
oath, is a perversion of truth." said !
Delmas. "The words were uttered by |
Jarman only after Rea had made the ;
statement that Jarman had received j
$450, and were made as a h denial to ut
terances of Rea. The question to be !
considered by the jury is that of dam- i
ages. The slanderous ' utterances of (
the defendant were strewn 'broadcast i
and caused humiliation to plaintiff and
his family. You must weigh and con- j
sider the extent to which the slander
has been disseminated and bear in
mind that the slander was dissemin- j
ated among the directors of the Hotel j
Vendome, three of whom testified to j
the fact in court, that it was repeated
to S. G. Tompkins, J. B. Church. E. P.
Main and E. A. Hayes.
"These slanderous statements of Rea
poisoned the atmosphere and publio
ear. Not satisfied with this, the
defendant, purposely reiterates his
story to a San Francisco paper and to
the San Jose Mercury for publication,
. bo that - every man, woman and child
In Santa Clara County could know that
Rea charged this old, honored citizen
with being a disgrace to" his family
and a disgrace to his name. ; , : â â¢:
' "In considering this verdict you are
to consider the injury done plaintiff.
Punitive and compensatory damages
can both be awarded."
. Delmas then explained the law of
slander. The speaker analyzed the two
men. He said: .
In 1595 the plaintiff, J. P. Jarman, had
been an honored citizen and merchant of
the city for twenty-five years. He was
highly respected by every one. .
How different the career of. Rea! In
. 1895 Rea, so he testified on the - stand, was
called a political boss. It is easy to de
termine which of these men is of the
higher"character. What is a boss? Ac
cording to "Webster's definition a boss is a
manager or dictator of parties,- or the
head of a ring. The evidence in the case
shows that this self-constituted and self
appointed leader met with other leaders
In his office to determine upon a policy
to be carried out during the campaign.
Rea said he had agreed to give the church
people a resident district where saloons
could not be conducted.. The School De
partment was to be kept out of politics.
Rea- was willing, to recognize the; A. P. A.
as Republicans. He was" "also gracious
enough to recognize the Catholics, and,
as they paid one-third of the taxes, they
should- be so represented In the schools.
When a vacancy should occur, among the
teachers of that faith a teacher of the
â a 'ii.- faith should be appointed in the
place. These self-constituted leaders
were planning to take public matters out
of the people's hands. They were de
termining what teachers should be ap
pointed and of what faith and what
should be done before the Board of Edu
cation met. . -.- : â¢ ,
â¢This is a very convenient form of gov
ernment, but it is ; not a government by
the people.- Rea told you he had to have
men in â¢â¢ office he could trust. In secret
junta this self -constituted â¢ leader deter
mined to go forth in the community and
find men who would blindly obey the dic
tates of this self-appointed governor and
carry out his orders, agreed upon in his
back office. He bargained with the A. P.
A. 's, Veterans and Catholics, and agreed
to divide political spoils with them. They
agreed to divide among themselves ana
their gang the public offices of San Jose
and pay no attention to the efficiency and
service of men in office. â¢ .
The defendant told you in most edifying
terms that J. H. Maggard, an agent of
the O. S. Kelly Co. came to him to se
cure his influence in selling the county a
steam roller. Only Supervisors Ayer and
Roll were In favor of purchasing the roll
er, bo he went to Boss Rea to secure. his
Influence to persuade his own brother,
Supervisor Gh E. Rea, to vote for the
roller. With- Supervisor Rea's vote the
purchase would be made. The terms
were to be $3700, and for his influence up
on his own brother the boss was to re
ceive $1000 commission, or over 25 per
cent. He' entertained the proposition;
Was willing to make the commission and
â¢was willing to see the county pay $3700 for
a roller that had to his knowledge been
Bold to the city for $2750.
The same Mr. Maggard also went to
Rea's office for his influence in selling the
roller to the city. The boss' own political
friend, Councilman Fay, was deeply in
terested in the matter.. On June 16, 1897,
he opposed the purchase of the roller, and
on June 28 following he favored the pur
chase of the roller. What brought about
this change of mind in Fay? Was it de
fendant's influence? If it be true that
$900 was paid as commission *on the pur
' chase of the roller or where it would do
the most H.ocd, where did, it fifO? : ' Ajj^wer,
that question, and I will tell you where
the $1000 would have gone if the county
bought the roller. , . "
The testimony of S. P. Hatcher that he
had gone to Kea for aid in having the lire
limits changed so as to permit the rebuild
ing of the Khinehart flats was taken here.
The passage of an ordinance was of too
small Import for thÂ« chief to meddle with
and with lofty grandeur he said he turned
the matter over to J. D. Mackenzie^ lead
er of the kilted brigade in the Fourth
Ward. This same defendant pretends he
protects the public treasury and that his
Bole deaire is to see that none but good
and efficient officials are elected to office.
Rea t' jk a great interest in Jarman at
one time and had him nominated for
Councilman, because he thought he poultj
use him. whenever the testimony of Rea
clashes with that of Jurman, who can for
a monment hesitate to decide who tells
the truth?
The caucus at Rea's house, where the
boss wanted to make a slate, was re
viewed. It was shown that the men
Jarman objected to were drunken po
licemen and a rowdy fireman. One offi
cer, Molting, it was shown, had been
drunk about half the time. A slate,
with the names of these men to whom
Jarman objected, was finally adopted
by the City Council. This matter was
gone Into at length, and It was shown
that Jarman espoused only good men
for policemen and firemen, while Rea
took any man with political influence.
Continuing. Delmas said:
"Gentlemen, I blushed when I heard
it, and it will remain a blot on the rec
ord of the court, a stain upon the city
â when I heard this boss in his czar
like way state what he was going to
do to those who refused to obey his
dictates."
Delmas then read from Rea's testi
mony in which the boss stated that if
the present Council did not conduct
themselves properly he would walk into
the council chamber and drag them
from their seats by the collar.
"Think of it, gentlemen!" he contin
ued. "So said Jupiter Olympus, the
White Czar of the Russias, the great
potentate and Governor of San Jose.
And see to it, gentlemen, that you fol
low in the footsteps of the shepherd,
obey the dictates of the boss, or he will
stride into the council chamber and
drag you from your seats, as Cromwell
did in the Parliament of England, and
as Napoleon did of yore in France. And
then we dream we are, we think we
are. we boast we are free American
citizens, who govern ourselves. Think
of it! Our officials are to be dragged
from their seats by brute force unless
they meekly follow in the footsteps of
the 'lord.' "
The nomination of Jarman for Coun
cilman was then touched. He told of
Rea going to him and asking him to
enter into an agreement, and when the
plaintiff refused to do his bidding, of
how the boss decided that Jarman must
be defeated at any cost. Rea then set
out to annihilate the character of Jar
man to effect his purpose.
Delmas devoted some time to Rea's
testimony. All his statements were
denounced as false. He said the slan
derous utterances on which the suit
was brought wore made by Rea. who.
Intoxicated by his own fancied power
in this community, conceiving himself
In -absolute security and immunity
from that redress which applies to or
dinary men, made these charges
against Jarman with just as much un
concern to bring him down to the
ground as a man would take a pole to
knock fruit down from a tree. Rea
wanted to prevent Jarman's election.
There was no ground upon which he
could attack him truthfully. He re
sorted to the weapons of slander in or
der to accomplish his purpose.
"It remains with you. by your ver
dict," said Delmas, "to teach him
that whatever else may be open to his
inroads in this community, private
character and the reputation of its
men. women and children are beyond
his reach; that however great Rea may
fancy himself to be there is, thank
God, a remnant, a fragment at least,
of a power left in the minds of Ameri
can citizens greater than "he, and that
is the majesty of the law.
"We have asked for $25,000, gentle
ment, in the count of the complaint,
and we want $25,000. If you deny this
your verdict is an invitation, your ac
tion Is a sanction to the slander of a
f^ul traducer who has destroyed the
r ice of a home and cast a blot UDon
fair name of one of your citizens."
Attorney Burchard began the argu
ment for the defense. He had hardly
begun stating the facts of the case
when an adjournment was taken until
to-morrov.' morning.
RED BLUFF VISITED
BY A CONFLAGRATION
Church, Besidences and Store Con
sumed â Loss 820,000 â Insur
ance Unknown.
RED BLUFF, Oct. 19.â A fire broke out
this afternoon In an alleyway between
Jefferson and Madison streets. Its origin
Is unknown, save . that it must have
started In a Rhed in the alley in the rear
of the Tiptop House occupied by the fam
ily of Frank Cassin. The fire burned rap
idly northward, and soon the. house of N.
M. Russell was a sheet of flames. The
loss on these two buildings was nominal,
as nearly all the furniture of value was
removed and the buildings alone suffered.
The fire spread across the alley to Mai
tin's shoe shop, and thence to the general
merchandise and grocery store of
J. Eckert, the largest building in
that part of town.. From here,
i the brick walls " forming a check,
it spread rapidly to the . south,
burning the house belonging to W. O'Con
nor and occupied by Thomas Sharp, and
thence to the South Methodist parsonage,
which adjoins the church of the same de
nomination. . '
The parsonage and residence burned
like tinder, and soon the handsome
church was destroyed, notwithstanding
the heroic efforts of the firemen. It had
been completed only a few years at a
cost of nearly $10,000. As near as could be
learned the total insurance on the church
and parsonage was only 12500. From the
church the flames spread to the residence
of J. M. Sweeney, and it with its contents
went to join those that had preceded it.
At the time of this writing It Is impos
sible to obtain the exact amount of losses
to pach property owner or the insurance
that each carried. The loss on the gro
cery store of Eckert is placed at between
' $8000 and $10,000, insurance unknown. The
houses of Cassin, Russell and O'Connor
will average about $1000 each, not includ
ing furniture, etc. *
This is the second disastrous fire that
Red Bluff has had in the past six weeks,
and although the present one will not
equal in damage the other, it is a heavy
blow to the part of the town in which.it
! occurred, as these houses and stores were
the best in that section. Considering the
means the firemen had to work with and
disadvantages they were under from lack
of hose and water, they did excellent
work. ' â  .â  â .

work to-day, and, after adopting sev-
eral reports and amendments, elected
officers for the ensuing year. The fea
ture of the day was the competitive
drill of Cantons of Patriarch Militant
and the conferring of the degree of
Chivalry at Rose Carnival Pavilion this
evening. The place was crowded. Only
two cantons competed â Sacramento and
Ridgeley of Stockton. Sacramento
Canton, under command of Captain W.

C. Ing Jr. and Ensign G. Bock, was the
first to drill. It was followed by Ridge
ley. George T. Schuler captained the
Stocktonians, assisted by Lieutenant
George F. Hudson and Ensign B. F.
Woudham. The maneuvers and evolu
tions of both cantons were beautiful
and it was hard to decide the winner.
The judges were Colonel F. W. Sum
ner, Lieutenant Colonel G. Burdick and
Major Charles Hanson. The decision
was reserved and will be announced at
the ball to be given to-morrow night.
The Young Ladies' Drill Corps of Re

OLD TRACK TO BE SOLD
AND NEW SITE BOUGHT.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 19.â At the last
session of the Legislature a bill was
passed authorizing the State Agricultural
Society to file a petition in the Superior
Court of Sacramento County for leave to
sell the property of Agricultural Park.
The board of directors determined to ap
ply to the Superior Court for permission
to sell the historic racing grounds for the
purpose of purchasing another site, and
accordingly directed its attorneys Rob
ert T. and William H. Devlin, to take the
necessary steps for that purpose.
This afternoon the matter came up for
hearing before Superior Judge Johnson,
who made an order authorizing the soci
ety to sell its property and appointed \V.
E. Gerber, cashier of the California State
Bank, as commissioner for the purpose of
effecting the sale, fixing his bond at $90,
000.
The sum realized from the sale of this
property, according to the provisions of
the act, is to be paid into the State treas
ury, to be drawn out again upon requisi
tion of the directors of the Agricultural
Society for the purchase of new grounds.
It is estimated that the value of the
property authorized by the court to be
sold is about $90,000. It is expected that
the property will bring much more than
this, as it is now situated in a very popu
lous portion of Sacramento city. The
Agricultural Society secured deeds of re
lease from D. O. Mills. Edgar Mills, Ade
line Easton and others who had rever
sionary interests, so that its title is now
perfect. It is now the intention to buy a
new site either within the city limits or
adjoining the city, which will give the bo
ciety njore pommodioua quarters.
GRAND RALLY
TO GREET THE
NEXT GOVERNOR
People of Placer Hear
Henry T. Gage.
THOUSANDS OUT AT AUBURN
GBEAT TORCHLIGHT PARADE
AND A MONSTER MEETING.
Jacob H. Neff, Who Will BÂ© Elected
Lieutenant Governor, Also
Warmly Welcomed by
His Neighbors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Oct. 19.â As the tour of
Henry T. Gage progresses the pros
pects of a sweeping Republican vic
tory in California brightens. Every
where the party leaders and followers
are Inspired with confidence and cour
age. If the people vote as they shout
fhe majority for Gage and Iseff will be
overwhelming.
Last night's demonstration at Sacra
mento surprised everybody by its mag
nitude and enthusiasm. The vast
throng of enthusiastic and earnest vot
ers at Auburn to-night is remarkable.
A big meeting was expected, but the
most sanguine did not count on such a
vast number turning out. Placer Coun
ty, the home of the honored and popu
lar Jacob Neff, the Republican nomi
nee for Lieutenant Governor, can al
most be relied upon to return a hand
some majority for the Republican
cause. Here in beautiful Auburn the
people are Imbued with a resolute de-
termination to break the record of Re
publican triumphs in the mountains.
Undoubtedly the personal popularity of
Jacob Neff; will assist largely in pro
moting the good work.
Democrats who intended at the out
set to vote for Maguire and Neff now
perceive that Neff's election would be
an empty triumph if a fusion, single
taxer aud anarchist sympathizer should
be chosen to fill the first office in the
State, hence, after mature reflection,
they have. reached the sensible and log
ical conclusion that a vote for Henry
T. Gage for Governor will be required
to make Neff's election worth some
thing to the people of California,
Henry T. Gage was presented to the
prosperous and progressive men of Pla
cer County under most favorable aus
pices. Refreshed, by sleep in Sacra
mento and enlivened by the compan
ionship of General W. H. L. Barnes, he
was in fine form to enjoy the delightful
trip through the foothill country from
Sacramento to Auburn. The train ar
rived here early in the afternoon. As
the standard bearer and General
Barnes alighted the Auburn band dis
coursed sweet music. A large throng
assembled at the depot gave them a
cordial welcome. A walk of a few
steps brought them to Freeman's Ho
tel, to which place they were escorted
by L. L. Chamberlain, chairman of the
County Central Committee; F. B. Tut
tle, F. J. Nichols and B. B. Deming.
The intelligence of the local committee
was highly commended in allowing Mr.
Gage and General Barnes to rest for
two hours during the afternoon, in or
der to meet the requirements of the
evening demonstration. The standard
bearer, however, held an informal re
ception, and many people came forward
to extend to him an Individual welcome
to Auburn.
At once they recognized In Henry T.
Gage a man of the plain people, whose
sympathies for the masses had not been
dulled by long service as a pampered
olnce-holder. Men who dwell apart from
the densely populated cities often give
serious thought to the study of human
character. They read of party leaders
and get notions of their worth, but they
seldom form Judgment until they meet
face to face with the man whose char
acter they winh to study. The people
everywhere like to meet Gage. Fre
quently they do not wait for an intro
duction, for they judge him to be a
plain, everyday sort of a man that they
can talk to without the formality of
being introduced to him. Shortly before
6 o'clock a large delegation, headed by
Jacob H. Neff, arrived on the train
from Colfax. The Auburn band and the
Colfax band rendered music to cele
brate the arrival of the nominee for
Lieutenant Governor. One of the first
to greet the veteran miner was Henry
T. Gage, and the exchange of friendly
sentiments was prolonged until the on
lookers, desirous of meeting both candi
dates, pressed forward. Delegates ar
rived from Towle, Dutch Flat, Gold
Run, Lincoln, Newcastle, Penryn,
Loomis, Rocklln and Roseville. The
multitude in Auburn at 1 a'clock was
reinforced by hundreds of farmers and
Iruit growers, who came in on wagons
from the country precincts. The Col
fax and Auburn musicians were joined
by brass bands from Lincoln, Towle and
Penryn. Uniformed Republican clubs
also came and the cheering of the con
fident workers, added to the music of
the bands, rendered the occasion me
morable In Auburn. In honor of the
great demonstration in the mountains
the illuminations were brilliant.
At 7:30 o'clock the immense torchlight
parade in he -nor of Gage and Neff
moved forward in the following order:
Auburn band, Auburn Republican Club,
speakers' carriage, Colfax band, Col
fax Republican Club, Lincoln band, Lin
coln Republican Club, Towle band,
Towle Republican Club, Penryn band,
Penryn Republican Club, citizens with
fireworks and citizens with torches.
The procession, marshaled by J. G. Bis
bee, moved from the upper to the lower
town, down the railroad, East, Commer
cial and Main streets to Washington,
up Washington to the plaza and up
East to the opera house. The marching
column, with its grand display of fire
works, was viewed by thousands of
spectators.
The enthusiasm all along the line was
tremendous. The opera-house was
beautifully decorated with flags and
flowers. There was such a crush to
get In that all the seats were taken be
fore the clubs reached the house. When
Gage. Neff and Barnes took their al
lotted places on the stage the audience
arose and cheered. The cheering was
long continued, growing louder with
each renewed outbreak of approval.
The meeting was called to order by
L. L. Chamberlain, chairman of the
County Central Committee, who spoke
of the demonstration as Placer Coun
ty's welcome to |the next Governor of
Our Treatment *>f Spanish Captives.
Never before in \ilÃtory was there a case
where a defeated and captive enemy received

tions bars benefited by it, and ali praise it.
California. This allusion was the sig
nal for still greater demonstrations of
applause. When the tumult subsided
Mr. Chamberlain announced F. B. Tut
tle as president of the meeting. The
following vice presidents were named:
W. M. Sparks, Martin Michaels, Lin
coln; James French, Sheridan; H. C.
Trippett, Roseville; Oscar Odom, J. H.

F. B. Tuttle made a brief speech on
taking the chair, and then introduced
Hon. Jacob Neff. The tumults of ap
plause which began as Air. Nell arose
to speak defy .description.
There never was a greater welcome
accorded to a candidate by his neigh
bors and friends. In response to the
greeting Mr. Neff remarked that it af
forded him delight to witness such a
marvelaus demonstration in the county
of Placer in honor of Henry T. Gage.
In regard to the reflections on the in
telligence and integrity of the Repub
lican State Committee and the asper
sions that had been cast by the fusion
leader Mr. Neff said that he had never
presided over a more intelligent and in
dependent body of men than that which
nominated Henry T. Gage for Governor.
The delegates wore no collar and were
free to act according to the dictates of
their conscience. SpeaJsing directly of
matters within the knowledge of the
audience he said: "You knew the
character of the men sent from Placer
County to that convention, and you
know that they were nat swerved by
railroad influence." (Great applause.)
The Auburn Glee Club sang a song
and responded to an encore. Another
prolonged and mighty demonstration
of enthusiasm followed the Introduction
of Henry T. Gage. He was presented
to the people as a man who had never
sought office. The hour was late when
he began speaking, but he was in good
voice for the work of the evening. There
were shouts of joy when he told the
audience of the great demonstrations in
support of the Republican ticket which
he had witnessed during his speaking
tour in twenty-three counties of Cali
forna. He did not take the magnificent
ovations as greetings to himself, but
regarded them as examples of devotion
to the ca*use which the Republican
party represented. His speech followed
the lines of his masterly address at
Sacramento last night. He trusted that
the intelligence of the people would
enable them to see the dangers that
lurked In the socialistic dogma of sin
gle tax. He reviewed the disloyal rec
ord of Maguire In Congress, exposed
the humbugging of Maguire's anti-rail
road declaratio-ns and directed the es
pecial attention of Placer County peo
ple to the effect of the proposed single
tax on the miners and farmers.
Mr. Gage spoke for one hour and
gained many tokens of approval. He
made his points on the single tax with
effect.
The applause which hailed the intro
duction of General W. H. L. Barnes
was as great and long-continued as
any demonstration which preceded it.
Many of the men in the audience had
traveled by teams twenty-five or thirty
miles to listen to his superb oratory.
He spoke for nearly two hours, and no
one in the vast assemblage was disap
pointed. His eloquent tribute to the
patriotism and ability of President Mc-
Kinley and his earnest appeal to Silver
Republicans to join in sending a mes
sage of confidence to the noble Presi
dent enlisted the heartiest applause of
the evening. Owing to the lateness of
the hour General Barnes sought several
times to close his speech, but the en
raptured assemblage urged him to go
on. He applied the single tax dogma to
the men who had acquired property and
homes in Placer County and made the
odious scheme so plain that the audi
ence perceived the danger that lay In
the ambition of the office-holding
"giant."
The great meeting, the greatest in
point of numbers and enthusiasm ever
held In Placer County, adjourned with
three mighty cheers for Gage and Neff
and three more shouts of welcome for
General Barnes.
To-morrow Gage and Barnes 50 to
Grass Valley and Nevada City.

His Attacks.
Special Dispatch to Thft Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 19.â James G. Ma
guire and his running mate, E. L.
Hutchison, and several other candi
dates on the State- Democratlc-Populis
tic ticket addressed the largest political
gathering of the campaign here this
evening the meeting was naturally en
thusiastic, and the gallery plays of Ma
guire increased the rounds of applause.
Although Maguire holds the nomination
of Governor from the Democrats, 'Pop
ulists and Silver Republicans, the list
of vice presidents included not one Sil
ver Republican, and but about half a
dozen Populists were favored with
seats on the platform. This was freely
commented on at the meeting.
Maguire's words of self-laudation
were amazing, and what few good qual
ities he omitted to mention Hutchison
told of. In opening he made a few re
marks about the county ticket and then
got down to talking of Maguire and
Maguireism. He referred to Gage, but
General Barnes was the principal sub
ject of attack.
The "Little Giant" said Caere ooened
his campaign with a speech in Los An
geles about five weeks ago that was
said to be the keynote of the campaign.
But it was not satisfactory, and Gen
eral Barnes was ordered to sound a
new keynote. It was this latter speech
that the speaker said he would tear
into threads to-night.
Barnes, unlike Gage, was brineine
every issue of national and State poll
tics into the campaign. He said Barnes
claimed the success of the SnanlÃh-
American war was due to the Republi
can administration and Its glorios to
the Republican party. This he denied
and said the victories of the war were
common heritage of the people, as
Democrats and Populists had fought
alongside Republicans.
The speaker said Barnes then took ud
the Philippine Islands, and his beauti
ful essay on the islands seems to have
been drawn from Captain Cook's trav
els. McKinley's course in the matter
of the Philippine Islands and the war
was praised. This was surprising, as
it was the only good word he spoke of
any one save himself during the
speech. Â . ,
Maguire then told the audience hia
old railway story. He went at length
Into it. He ridiculed the idea that the
single tax was to be submitted to the
people. Barnes was quoted as know
ing nothing of the single tax, and Ma
guire said Gage knew less than Barnes
and Preston les sthan Gase. Before
he would discuss the single tax with
Gage he would advise the Republican
candidate for Governor to tftke a kin
dergarten course on the subject and
study up economical topics.
He closed by saying that If electsd
Governor he would perform his duties
faithfully and honestly, as he did all
other public duties asked of him.
Hutchison followed. He character
ized Maguire as a man -with a brain so
large and a heart so great that all the
Huntingtons In the universe could not
buy him. Senator J. W. Daniels, Sen
ator White, Mayor Phelan and Gov
ernor Budd were great Democrats, but
Maguire was the peer of them all.

lections by the McKinley and Hobart

Marysvllle Independent Brass Band.
Hon. Frank D. Ryan, Republican
nominee for Congressman in the Second
District, was the first speaker , intro
duced. He began with a discussion of the
varied interests of the Second Congres
sional District, pointing out the evluent
need for improvement of the Sacramento
River and other streams In the district,
and denned clearly his posftion regarding
forthcoming appropriations and the ad
visability of securing ample money irom
the Government to insure a continuance
of the good work once it is under way.
He made an intelligent comparison of the
two parties and the issues they represent
and also touched briefly on the railroad
question. The funding bill, he said, was
fathered by representatives of the Demo
cratic party. If there was an Injustice in
the measure the Democratic party must
accept the responsibility, and not cast
the odium on the Republican party.
Mr. Ryan next pointed, out what the
Republican party stands for and what It
has accomplished in the Past. After

better health than she has been for years.
She has gained in strength and feels as
good as she could wish. It has complete-

doctors and patent medicines have failed
to do, and think it a cheap cure as I had
spent over |200 trying to get relief for

for God only knows what I suffered before
trying the belt. I had about given up

different things with the same result. I
cannot tell you how I feel toward you,

kets of the Republican party. It is the duty
of every citizen to vote for the best nom
inees, and those nominees will be found
on the Republican ticket. Let us go to
the polls on the Bth of next month, and
by our ballots strike terror into the camp
uf the enemy. "We are determined not
to be dictated to longer or ruled by any
set of^bosses. Let us light the enemy
with the same vigor that marked the
tight of our gallant soldier boys at the
liont, and the so-called Democratic
party will be a thing of the past."
Alter several campaign songs nad been
rendered by the Sam Bootn Quartet,
Chairman iJrady introduced Charles L.
Fatton as the next Mayor of San .Fran
cisco. The audience wildly cheered and
applauded, and it was several minutes
beiore Mr. Fatton could make himself
heard.
"1 appear before you to-night, said he,
â¢â¢as a candidate for the Highest local
ottlce in tne gift of the peo
ple. It is only right that you
should know who I am and wnat
\ i think. From now on to the close of
this campaign, I will make a battle for
the success of the entire Republican
tlcKet. 1 fully believe that the ticket
will be victorious, for the Republican
municipal platform is broad and out
spoken and in many respects superior to
trie Democratic platform. The people have
already decided at the polls that they do
not longer wish to live under the old con
solidation act. They have adopted the
new charter and our Republican legisla
tive nominees are pledged to ratify and
indorse their acts at Sacramento. The
charter must be indorsed. A Republican
Legislature will indorse it and make it
the governing law of this municipality.
The Republican party has also pledged
its nominees to conduct the municipal
government on an economical basis. We
are pledged to the dollar limit, and I be
lieve that the dollar limit will furnish
funds sufficient to run the municipality.
It elected. I promise you that I wiy live I
up to every plank and pledge in the Re- i
publican platform.
'â¢Tl.e Democratic party pretends to be
the friend of the laboring classes. The
Republican party is pledged that %2 a
day, for eight hours' labor, will be the
minimum rate of wages^pn all public con
tracts. 1 here pledge you that if lam
elected Mayor I wiii not sign any con
tract thar does not have that clause in
it. I believe that we should own our j
own gas and water works, and then we i
will have a material reduction in rates.
Until the charter goes into effect, when
euch utilities may be acquired, the Re
publican party pledges its nominees to
see that there is a reduction in rates, in
conclusion I wish to say that I have not
made any entangling alliances with any
boss or bosses, or with any corporation
or corporations. I will pledge myself only
to the people, and if I am elected Mayor
I will give you a good, honest, business
like administration of municipal affairs."
Mr. Patton was warmly applauded, for
the businesslike ring of his address con
vinced his auditors that he will keep
every pledge and promise he makes to the
people.
Duncan E. McKinlay followed In a
lengthy address, in which he carefully
and clearly explained the national and
State Issue involved in the campaign.
"We are engaged," said he, "in a great
battle which will be fought at the polls
on November 8. The issues this year are
more educational in their nature than they
have been in many years. After the civil
war issues were involved that kept sec
tionalism and strife alive. The political j
orators appealed to the passions and pre
judices of the people. That time has
passed, and thank God it has passed for
ever. Within the last six months we have !
been bound together with links of iron |
and bands of steel. When the first call
to arms was made by President McKinley
every State and every Territory contrib
uted Its quota to our victorious army and
navy. There is now no North, no South,
no East, no West; but instead one
great united, loving, holy family."
The speaker then paid a glowing tribute
to the present national administration
and said that under the protective tariff
system, hope, comfort, cneer and cour
age had arrived.
â¢'The Republican . party in selecting
Henry T. Gage as the State standard
bearer " said McKinlay In conclusion,
"selected not a politician, but a citizen
who has a record of honest, sturdy Amer
ican citizenship."
Frank H. Kerrigan, Thomas F. Gra
ham and H. L. Joachimsen followed in
short speeches, and after a selection by
the James M. Troutt quartet, the meeting
adjourned.
IN THE THIRTY-SECOND,.
"Words of Wisdom from Candidates
and Anxious Appeals for Votes.
The Democrats of the Thirty-second
District had their jubilee last evening in
the dining-room of the Central Hotel, on
Third streetâ an apartment large , enough
for all, but sadly lacking in seating ac
commodation. , The front row was re
served for the candidates, who kept drop

Mayor Phelan opened the meeting with |
a speech upon himself and his attempts
to reform. He , declared that certain
morning papers of Republican tendencies
had declared that he was not , entitled
to the credit for : having Market street
paved with bitumen; that they had tried
to show that he was the enemy of the I

WHAT HAPPENED AT HAYMARKET SQUARE, CHICAGO, IN 1886
This is what Judge Maguire said in Congress January 27, 1897, when he
was opposing a bill to exclude undesirable immigrants:
'â¦They are generally educated men, many of them holding university degress, whose offending consists of resist
ance to tyranny, which in the conditions under which they live is obedience to God. Who are the Nihilists? They are
the Democrats of Russia, who are struggling against almost hopeless odds to establish the natural and inalienable rights
of men in that country as against the tyranny and false pretense of divine right on the part of the Czar. Who are the
Anarchists of Spain ? They are the Republicans of that country, seeking to establish the principle of popular sovereignty
as against the unnatural privileges of governing now enjoyed by a single family."
who wished to assure the people that he
was running for office, and then, after a
sentence or two from other minor candi
dates. Franklin K. Lane, who wants to
become City and County Attorney, spoke.
He was very enthusiastic and declared
that the Democrats would win from the
top of the ticket to the bottom, but he
did not offer any money to back himself.
Then James Denman had a few words.
E. L. Fitzgerald, John P. Dunn, Rhodes
Borden, Isidore Gutte and a few more
graced the platform, and then the meet-
Ing ended, t|ie candidates' bench having

was opened by Thomas Wilfred Rolett.
He introduced John B. Carson, Republi

spoke upon the duties of a Judge and how
he would fill the position should he be

WHO IS THE RAILROADS MAN?
This is what Henry T. Gage,
Republican candidate for Gov
ernor, said at Sacramento Tues
day night:
"Maguire has charged me with
being a tool of the railroad, but
never in my life have I accepted
a dollar from c railroad, but have
always been on the other side
when cases arose against the rail
road company."
nlcipal and Judicial nominees, have been
invited to present themselves at the
various meetings and make short re
marks. It is the idea to have a great

to the different halls, so as to keep up
two or three hours of enthusiastic work.
It has been arranged to have speakers

Forty-First District Democrats.
The Democrats of the Forty-first Dis
trict held a meeting at Sacramento and
Polk streets last night, presided over by
Edward Harrison. The principal speakers
of the evening were Franklin K. Lane and
James D. Phelan.
Mr. Lane spoke first. The fight, he said,
was not a party fight, but a fight for
good government and against the com
bined bosses of the Republican party.
Mayor Pheian's speech was very much on
the same lines. He promised wonderful
things in case the Democratic nominees
are elected and pointed to the tearing up
of the rails on Market street as a sample
of the way corporations will be fought
in case his ticket carries the day. Flnlay

The most noticeable feature In politics
Just now is the Increase in the number of
Populists who are opposed to fusion and
â who express their determination to vote
the Republican ticket this November. Ex-
Assemblyman Bretz took the lead in ad
vocating this movement, and his following:
is growing hourly.
The farcical side of fusion, is becoming
dally more apparent, as members of dif
ferent parties are heard declaring that
they have no candidate for certain offices
that were awarded to other parties in the
fusion deal. The Populists, who elected
three officers four years ago, now have but
two place* on the ticket. The Silver Re
publicans have three and the Democrats
the balance. There is, however, such bit
ter feeling among the various wines of
all the parties that half of each will vote
the Republican ticket.
The Enquirer to-night publishes the fol
lowing editorial:
The Examiner, whose cialm to exercise
a censorship over morals and manners In
Alameda County the Enquirer has never
disputed because It has believed that the
gentle Intellectual exercise involved might
be beneficial to the editor of that excellent
journal, even if the benefits conferred upon
the objects of his tender solicitude are not
very great, devotes an editorial this morn
ing to "The Revolt In Alameda County."
In that article some things are stated
which are very true and some things which
are not Â»o true, and finally Inferences are
drawn which are very encouraging to Dem
ocratic candidates. It Is characteristic Â»f
the Examiner to take a deep Interest In
Republican dissensions, and It. after its
efforts to adjust them have failed It has dis
covered that it has all lnnred to the bene
fit of Democracy, why, that, bless you! was
a quite unforseen occurrence and not at all
a part of a general plan.
The "revolt" which the Examiner is now
encouraging is that of the "Independent
Republicans," from whose platform the
Examiner quotes admiringly, and evidently
the editor of that Journal regards them as
the most sterling band of patriots he has
discovered In this country for a good while.
He is so busy studying the revolt that he
has not had time to make a critical exam
ination of the rerolters. Had he done the
latter he would have noticed among them
several who used to run for office on Re-Â»
publican tickets, but whom the people re
jected, and who had no recourse left but
"Independence." In other words, after
they bad been by the people turned down

as undeserving politicians, they have, by
their own exertions, turned up as reform
ers. There was a time when the party
candidate, being rejected by the people, was
dead, but now he can come to life as an
"Independent Republican" and be lauded
by the Examiner! The Independent Republi
cans were shocked by the way In which the
party primary was run, and so certain can
didates got together in a back room, ap
pointed their friends whom they could trust
to be delegates, and practically nominated
themselves for office. Now It only re
mains for enough Republicans to vote for
the Independent Republican ticketâ to elect
the Democratic candidates.
By the way. while the Examiner is quot
ing: the Independent platform, why does It
not quote the plank repudiating civil ser
vice reform?

VOTE THE REPUBLICAN TICKET.
THUS far the local campaign has demonstrated
that Phelan is doomed to defeat unless he can
secure a large number of Republican votes.
There is no reason why he should receive these, rr^any
reasons why he should not.
The only Republican inclined to vote for Phelan
will be the one who has the fallacious idea that the
present Mayor stands for purity, for good govern
ment, for lofty principles. With a shade of regret we
announce that Phelan stands for none of these things.
He is simply a selfish politician, with no end in view
beyond his personal advancement. He has great am
bitions. He hopes to make the mayoralty a stepping
stone to larger fields.
Let a glance be taken at the record. When Phelan
was first nominated he insisted upon the right of
naming the men who should compose the Board of
Supervisors and the Board of Education. He was
permitted to have his way. Two boards more rot
ten never disgraced a city. There are men in each
who should be in the penitentiary; in each the honest
minority is helpless.
In the present campaign Phelan has posed, as he
did before, as the crystallization of purity in politics.
While keeping up this pretense he contrived the Com
mittee of One Hundred, which assumed the power
to absolutely sway the Democracy, and he himself
is this committee. The other ninety-nine are mere
figures. In the name of this committee Phelan has
overridden the rights of the party and of the public.
Under the shadow of its authority he has constituted
himself a boss, whose word is law, and whose aspira
tions constitute the one thing to be accomplished.
He accepted the nomination of the (non) partisans
before they had adopted a platform, and did the same
with the Democrats. He did npt care for principles;
it was office he courted.
Now the fact appears that for the purpose of pro
moting his personal schemes he has induced reputable
citizens to go through the form of changing residence
so they might be able to represent in his precious
board some ward in which they had never lived. He
persuaded them that by packing a nightshirt to some
other quarter they would acquire the right to repre
sent it in the councils of the just and holy over which
he expected to preside. All of which is hypocrisy and
nonsense.
Phelan has been shown in his true colors. He poses
for effect, and the effect is not what he hoped. In
tohe words of the street, people are "onto him." Why
should he have any Republican support? We con
fess to an inability to answer.
His own party, the party he assumes to lead by its
collective nose, is disgusted. Left to its support
alone he would be the worst defeated of any man
who ever sought the chair he now, in a measure,
warms. But an idea has been prevalent that he is
so sweet and pure that he ought to be supported re
gardless of politics. It is this idea, founded on noth
ing, to which he must pin his hopes. It is this idea
we feel it a duty to dispel. There is scant excuse for
a Democrat's voting for Phelan; for a Republican's
there is none.
An officer of the West Virginia Volunteers has
been accused of "spread-eagling" some of his men.
and is guilty. There seems to be nothing to do but
dismiss him from the service, and Alger could make
a hit by having this done in a hurry.
When the Examiner turns its vials of wrath upon
the Supervisors it seems to forget that these officials
were chosen by Phelan, professional advocate of pur
ity. He has chosen a new lot now, but there is no
evidence that they are any better.
Friends of General Merriam are certain that he will
not protect Lieutenant Merriam because of the mere
fact of relationship. Young Merriam had a better
chance than almost anybody else to have more sense.
We trust that no evening paper has been offended
by the modest request to state its price. Perhaps the
Bulletin refrains from answering so as to protect the
foolish friend who paid the price.
The place where Mayor Phelan's meeting was
held Saturday night was Silk Hall, not Silk Hat Hall.
We make this statement to offset a possible misap
prehension.
"Turn the rascals out!" shrieks the Examiner. Of
course. But who turned them in? Phelan, the purist,
the good. And he has another set he wants
to turn in.
It is surprising that the War Investigation Com
mittee should have adjourned Saturday for lack of
witnesses. Where was Julian Hawthorne?
Of course Widber will appeal. The mere fact that
a man is guilty nevÂ«r appears to him sufficient rea
son for passing sentence upon him.
PHELfIN I OND THE PRIMARY.
T" HERE was in existence in this city a Demo
cratic County Committee elected at the duly
authorized party primaries. There was no claim
that its composition was any worse â and perhaps it
was no better â than that of the County Committees
of 1882, 1886 and 1892, years in which the Democracy
carried San Francisco. But the State Central Com
mittee set aside this duly elected County Committee
and appointed three trustees, one of them a resident
of this city and the others from the country, to ar
range a government and organization for the party of
San Francisco. Out of this issued the Phelan Com
mittee of One Hundred, which stepped into the
place of the regularly elected County Committee, and
not only usurped all of its regular functions, but went
far ahead of them by appointing the delegation to the
State convention. This delegation was contested by
one elected at primaries called by the regular County
Committee. The delegation of the Committee of One
Hundred was seated by the State convention, but the
committee on credentials reported for that delegation
on the condition that in future the party should be
permitted to hold primaries in San Francisco. Upon
this condition, which no doubt rested on a promise
by Phelan and his managers that the Committee of
One Hundred would call a primary, that delegation
sat in the convention, nominated Maguire, indorsed
fusion and did the job lot of things required by the
programme. The primary delegation came home,
refused seats in the convention, but with the sting of
defeat mitigated by the order of the State convention
that there should be a primary in San Francisco. It
was expected that at this primary delegates would be
elected to a city convention to nominate a local
ticket, which, coming from the people, would have
the right to ask the people to ratify it at the polls.
But it was never the intention of the Mayor to
trust his ambitions to the popular decision at a
primary. His theory was that at a primary of his
party he would be beaten, but that if he could get
upon the ticket again his sustained pretense of re
form would secure for him enough of independent
and Republican votes to offset the defection of even
a majority of the Democratic voters.
Therefore, by his orders and procurement, the
Committee of One Hundred violated the agreement
which seated its delegation in the State convention,
disobeyed the orders of that convention, disappointed
the expectation of the party, refused to call a pri
mary for the election of delegates to the city conven
tion, and announced that it was the city convention
and would nominate a ticket.
As well might the State Committee have announced
that it was the State convention. This self-constituted
city convention teetered for many days on a plank
which had at its other end the so-called Non-Partisan
convention. Mayor Phelan manipulated the Com
mitte"e of One Hundred, self-elected as a convention,
and his brother-in-law, Mr. Frank Sullivan, manipu
lated the Non-Partisan convention, also self-elected.
These two bodies, with no origin from the people,
in co-operation selected a ticket for the people to
vote.
The Mayor is so well satisfied with this method, so
pleased with the success of a trick by which his dele
gation was seated in the State convention on a prom
ise that has been violated, and so exultant over his
success in running the Committee of One Hundred
as a nominating convention, and so exhilarated with
his exercise on the teeter-board, while his brother-in
law, Mr. Sullivan, occupied the opposite end, and
they chanted, after the fashion of children:
"Teeter totter,
llilk and water;
I'm the Mayor and
You're the brother-in-law. "
that he has now made proclamation that there will
be no more Democratic primaries in San Francisco
until certain things satisfactory to him have been
done. In a speech which is reported in Sunday's
Examiner on page 25, column 3, he says:
"Until the Legislature passes a primary law, which
it will do next year, it is futile and the mockery of
Democracy to appeal to the primary, because it does
not represent the Democracy."
This, in Phelanesque verbiage, is a proclamation
that there is to be no Democ^fetic primary permitted
in this city until after 1900. The Legislature of 1899
may pass a primary law, and it may not. If it do
not, Phelan's Committee of One Hundred will con
tinue to act as the County Committee, and the city
convention and will renominate the Mayor in that
year. If it do pass a primary law, that law must
go through the courts. It must pass the Supreme
Court successfully before proceedings under it can
be of assured legality and before tickets based upon
it can get upon the official ballot. All this cannot be
done in time for action under such law in 1000.
Therefore the Committee of One Hundred will do in
that year as it has done now â constitute itself a city
convention and nominate a ticket.
The Mayor has in effect, proclaimed himself
"Phelan I" of San Francisco, and having nominated
himself now proposes to do it again in 1900.
In the speech in which he gives notice of
his intention he says: "It is a mockery
to appeal to a primary." Why? This is
an unsupported declaration. Phelan I was himself
nominated to the office he holds by a convention
chosen at a primary. Why is a primary any more
of a mockery now than it was then? Was his nomi
nation in 1896 corrupt? HÂ« stands to-day exposed in
procuring a citizen to abandon his home and ward
to register in another ward in order that the Commit
tee of One Hundred may nominate him for Super
visor from the latter ward. Was there any worse
"moqkery" in the convention of 1896? The offense
is one for which others have been sent to the peni
tentiary. Is it less "a mockery" done by the commit
tee of Phelan I than by a convention issuing from a
primary? If a plain man do such a thing and is in
dieted for it, does the same thing become lawful when
done by the Mayor? In fine, have we gone so far
on the road to prerogative that the city legend runs:
"The King can do no wrong"?
Mayor Phelan would reduce the wages of the men
who light the street lamps. They get $40, and he
thinks $25 enough for them. When the Mayor poses
as a friend of labor, the people who labor will be apt
to think of this.
An unclean organ which is the chief advocate of
Mayor Phelan denounces as idiotic the "attack" made
upon him in relation to colonization. There was no
attack. The whole thing was a mere recital of facts.
If the report that a brother of the President has
failed to secure membership in a New York club is
true, it shows that the club has a lot of snobs and is
not free from gossips.
Editor Rochefort seems to be a sure enough luna
tic. The fact is to be regretted, because he was sub
ject to an occasional idea, and had a way of express
ing it
There are reasons to suppose that the traffic in
human hide is not flourishing.
THE SAN KKAJN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1898.
IN his speech in the House against that feature of
the immigration bill by which anarchists and ni
hilists were to be excluded from the United States
Judge Maguire said that anarchists and nihilists are
the Democrats and Republicans of Europe, and that
he hoped never to see the time when they will be ex
cluded from this "land of the free heart's hope and
home."
This sounds very sentimental. He could not have
been ignorant of the fact that anarchists have hereto
fore come to this land of the free heart's hope and
home, and that they came not to enjoy but to - de
stroy it. Their contact with our people and their ex
perience of our mild institutions in no wise abated
their venom against all government, nor their grudge
against others whose industry in the midst of our en
larged opportunities for thrift had earned for them
homes and property.
Anarchy had a great increase in this country im
mediately after the Russian, Bakounin, announced its
platform to be:
"Do what you wish."
"Everything is everybody's."
In 1885 there were 4000 anarchists in Chicago. As
far as known there was but one Americaq among
them, the Texan, Parsons, who had outlawed himself
by marrying a negro woman. This anarchist colony
in Chicago established a paper, maintained a labora
tory school in which to teach the use of high explo
sives in the manufacture of bombs, and held stated
meetings in which the most violent speeches were
made attacking our Government and institutions. The
spirit in which these organized murderers accepted
the hospitality of this "land of the free heart's hope
and home" was redly revealed in the banners under
which they marched in procession through the
streets of Chicago.
In September, 1885, they had a great meeting, an
outburst of hatred against governmental authority
and law and order. Four thousand of them were in
line. Upon their banners were inscribed the follow
ing sentiments:
"Every Government is a conspiracy against the
people."
"Government is for slaves." Â«â¢
"Our civilization is powder, lead and clubs."
"Liberty without equality is a lie."
"Lawlessness is the only equality."
"Private property is theft."
"Might is right."
Any one who will turn to the news columns of any
paper for September and October, 1885, will find fre
quent reports of the proceedings of these Chicago
anarchists, who had come to this "land of the free
heart's hope and home" and were denouncing it, its
people, its government and its institutions.
They gathered courage and numbers, and finally
reduced their theory of "propaganda by deed" to
practice by throwing the murderous bombs in Hay
market square, by which nearly a score of policemen
and others were assassinated. For this crime several
anarchists were hanged and several more received
life sentences to the penitentiary, and were pardoned
and turned loose again in this "land of the free heart's
hope and home" by Governor Altgeld, with whom
Mr. Hearst is seeking a newspaper partnership in
Chicago.
This speech of Maguire's, inviting anarchists and
assassins who oppose all government and denounce
private property as theft to this country, expresses
sentiments which the order-loving people of Califor
nia do not indorse. They were deliberately uttered
by Maguire. They are part of his record. If he is
elected that entire record is indorsed.
We say deliberately that California will be seriously
injured by his election. People do not wish to make
their homes or invest their means in a State whose
Governor has often declared that property in real es
tate is robbery, and who has indorsed anarchy and
its declaration that "all private property is theft."
THE attention of Mayor Phelan, as the purist in
chief of San Francisco, should again be called to
the fact that Hearst's notorious boodling sheet
is making an especial campaign in his behalf. Amid
the conflicting emotions which overwhelm a man who
undertakes to boss an entire city, his Honor may have
overlooked that fact. But it is important that he
should attend to the matter at once. If he does not
do so within a few days the last vestige of claim he
may have to the respedt of the people of this city
will be swept away.
Of course Hearst himself is a fugitive from justice
and cannot be reached. He can with impunity force
his services upon any man; but his gang of black
mailers and boodlers are here, and if Phelan desire
he can take proceedings against them to prevent their
continued advocacy. If he desire to save what little
shred of reputation he may have left aftes November
8 he will adopt our suggestion and call off the dis
reputable and abandoned sheet. Its support is con
tamination; its affiliation political death. /
In TBO3 Hearst signed a contract with the Southern
Pacific to accept $30,000 for its silence with reference
to the interests of that corporation. The railroad
knew him to be a liar and a blackmailer, and so it
made him accept the mbney in thirty equal monthly
installments covering a State campaign and two Leg
islatures. For twenty-two months he maintained a
masterly silence upon railroad subjects. Whenever
he spoke of his esteemed fellow citizen, Huntington,
it was in respectful terms. There ts no doubt about
Hearst having conducted this affair; he was then
here and actively managing his paper. The justice of
California had not at that time made him a fugitive.
At the expiration of twenty-two months he broke
his contract. He had decided that the monthly in
stallment of $1000 was not hrge enough, and he imi
tated the strikers of 1894 in demanding more pay.
Huntington resisted further blackmail and .refused to
pay the remaining $8000. Hearst has never brought
suit for the money, and the installments are now out
lawing. In a few months they will all be barred by
the statute of limitations. This fact alone proves that
the transaction was blackmail, pure and simple.
How is it that Mayor Phelan accepts the support
of this convicted boodler? He must be familiar with
the facts we are recounting, for they have been pub
lished again and again. Is the alliance between
Phelan and Hearst an agreement between saint and
devil? Can purity emerge from the office of a news
paper owned and controlled by a man who admits
that he is a bribe-takerâ that he sold his sheet to
the railroad for $30,000, payable in installments of
$1000 a month?
If Phelan is really a purist he should at once get
rid of Hearst and his gang of boodlers and black
mailers. The longer he continues in association with
them the lower he is bound to fall in the estimation
of all decent people.
While hurrying to the hospital with a man who had
deliberately swallowed poison the patrol-wagon was
upset and a policeman suffered a broken wrist. It
does not seem exactly fair. No man who tries to kill
himself is worth the sacrifice of the smallest bone.
MOGUIRE fIND ANARCHY.
HEARST, THE BOODLER.
PHELAN'S LAST TRICK
EXPOSED BY RECORDS
James D. Phelan, Democratic candidate
for Mayor, Is making a plea to the labor
ing- classes for their votes, and through
the columns of one of his subsidized pa
pets he lays claim to their favor on the
ground that it is he to whom credit Is due
â for Inducing the Board of Regents of the
University of California to select San
Francisco as the place for the "Wilmerding
School. Also that to him is due the credit
of raising the money for the purchase of
Uie site on which to erect the school.
While The Call does not wish to detract
one bit of credit due to Mr. Phelan for
what he has done in the matter, still
there are others who deserve as much
credit in this respect as the Democratic
candidate. Mr. Phelan's paper mouth
piece says:
It was he who secured the Wilmerding
School, which Is to be the great nursery and
school of Intelligent and self-respecting labor,
for San Francisco, and he gave his first year's
salary as the city's chief executive for this
purpose. It will be remembered that the Board
of Regents were equally divided as to the plac
ing- of the school in the city orÂ«in the interior,
and much pressure had been brought to have
It In the interior. The regents promised it to
San Francisco if the Bite were donated. Mayor
Phelan appointed a committee to raise $16,000
for thie purpose, heading it himself with $3000.
The records of the Board of Regents
show that the case waa entirely differ
ent, and that instead of Mr. Phelan us
ing his influence to have the school es
tablished in this city he was pulling for
all he was worth to have* that institu
tion of learning built in San Jose, where"
he owns thousands of acres of land, left
him by his millionaire father, which
would Increase in value if the college was
built thereon. In other words, while
pretending to favor this city, he waa
working for San Jose. He played both
ends against the middle, and lost. Now
he is trying to make political capital out
of his defeat. The facts are these: The
most of the credit of having the school
located here is due to the Merchants' As
sociation, and to its president, F. W.
Dohrmann. It was the latter who began
the agitation, which was taken up by the
body. As soon as the regents took cog
nizance of the bequest half a dozen cities
made strong eliort to have their particu
lar localities favored. San Jose was
among the first to enter the race, as
shown by the following letter, inspired by
Mr. Phelan:
SAN JOSE, Aug. 31. 1895.
Dr. J. H. C. Bonte, Secretary Board of Re
gents, University of California â Dear Sir: In
a communication to our local Board of Trade
James D. Phelan has very generously offered
a valuable piece of property in this city as a
site for the "Wllmerding Training School for
Boys. The San Jose Board of Trade has ap
pointed a committee, of which I am a mem
ber, to tender to the Board of Regents this
site and to present such other claims as we
now have for their consideration. Acting on
this Â»uggestlon of I. HeJlman of San Fran
cisco I write to Inquire at what time and place
the Regents will be pleased to give this com
mittee a hearing. Tour early reply will be
very much appreciated. Very truly yours,
PAUL P. AUSTIN, Chairman.
A day was set by the regents, when the
representatives of the cities wishing to se
cure the school appeared to tell of the
special advantages of their several locali
ties. They came from Los Angeles, San
Diego, Stockton, Oakland, San Jose and
San Francisco. The San Jose delegation
was headed by Mr. Austin, who acted as
the mouthpiece for Mr. Phelan, and he
ANARCHISTS WITH
MUSICAL TENDENCIES
There is a full-fledged band of anar
chists in town. The police have been noti
fied and are on their guard, and it is said
that the Chevalier Philip Serra sleeps
with one eye open.
The anarchists are about twenty strong,
and twelve of their number are recog
nized as leaders whose commands are to
be rigidly followed and implicitly obeyed.
They have their headquarters at the
cigar factory of Mme. Rosa Reseghlni,
1345 Dupont street, where they hold
nightly conference, discuss everything in
general, proclaim their love for music,
and incidentally do a little talking about
anarchy.
During the day a few of the anarchists
work. The major portion of the labor
ers dish out spaghetti at Italian restaur
ants, and the remainder engage in the
inspiring occupation of the job painter,
all earnings are pooled and equally di
vided after the leaders have appropri
ated their shares. Anarchist leaders
never work.
The foundation of the San Francisco an
archist society, which is said to be a
branch of the great International associa
tion, dates back to last November^ The
first meeting of the anarchists is a touch
ing Incident, and the spirit which brourht
them together a soulful, poetic inspira
tion. The local branch of law desplsers
was first known to fame as a part of the
picturesque though awkward supers of
the Italian Opera Company which played
an engagement at the CaJlfornra Theater

PAUL P. AUSTIN, Room No. 7.
Mayor. City Hall.
OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF THE CITY
OF SAN JOSE.
SAN JOSE, Cal., October 7, 1895.
To the Honorable Board of Regents, Univer
sity of Californiaâ Gentlemen: Mr. James D.
Phelan has authorized the San Jose Board of
Trade to offer to your honorable body as a
site for the Wilmerding School a very valu
able and delightfully located tract of land In
the southerly portion" of this city. The area
of the property offered Is one of our ordinary
city blocks, or eight 50-varas. Should you,
however, not fleem this sufficient the amount
will be increased to two blocks of sixteen 50
varas. The property ia in the highest portion
of the city, being about 120 feet above tide
water and on the line of an electric streetcar
system. Its approximate value is $20,000. We
believe San Jose offers many inducements and
attractions as a desirable and proper place for
this school of industrial art. In the selection
of a location for a school of the character con
templated there are several essentials to be
considered. The school sÃould be of easy access
and centrally located.
The climate should be equable, the surround
ings agreeable and the social and moral at
mosphere as free as possible from taint of any
kind All these conditions we are convinced
prevail in this city. It is but a short distance
from San Francisco and it is easily accessible
from all points of the State. The completion
of the coast road will place it in direct com
munication with the southern counties. The
proximity of this Bite to our orchards,
driers, canneries and other Industries give full
opportunity for the employment during the
spare time of students so situated that they
must of necessity, by their earnings, help to
pay their way through school. This Is mani
festly an advantage to this class of boys eager
to fit themselves for advancement 1n life. We
earnestly urge your honorable board to appoint
a committee to visit this city and view the
property which Mr. Phelan so generously ten
der.. Yours very respec^ully, p
Chairman of Committee.
The San Francisco delegation was nom
inally headed by Mf. Phelan, but Mr.
Dohrmann and Alfred Bouvier made the
arguments, the Mayor keeping silent. On
the second vote San Jose dropped out of
thÂ« race, and on the third this city was
selected, provided that a site was do
nated. The statement that Mr. Phelan
raised the $20,000 to pxirchase the site near
the Lick School is badly overdrawn. A
citizens' committee, consisting of repre
sentatives of the Merchants' Association,
the Chamber of Commerce, Manufactur
ers* and Producers' Association, Mechan
ics' Institute and the Board of Trade,
started out and raised the money to buy
the land from Captain James McDonald
for 120.000, the owner reducing the price
to $16,000, counting $4000 as his donation
to the cause. The records of the Re
gents show that the following gave the
money to purchase the property:
Claus Spreckels. $3000; A. B. McCreery, $1000;
John Center, $1000: Louis Sloss & Co.. $1000;
J. W. Mackay, $1000; Market-street Railway
Company, $2000; Adam Grant, $500; Daniel
Meyer. $500; Henry Pierce, $500; Levi Strauss,
$500; Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany, $500; E. W. Hopkins. $230: Bank of Cali

Mrs. Robert Sherwood, $50; Pacific Gas Im

Bank, $150; cash, $60: James D. Phelan, $30u0;
collected by Merchants' Association, $250; Cap
tain James McDonald, $4000.
With these facts all a matter of record
on the books of the Board of Regents
those familiar with Mr. Phelan's part in
the Wilmerding School transaction think
that it Is very poor judgment for him and
his paper to try and make political capi

enemies of all governments met in friend

brilliant garb of the brigand that they
wore was responsible for it all.
After the opera season the supers duly
organized and established headquarters
at "La Boheme," 428 Broadway. The sa
loon, named after Puccini's great master
piece, was not a financial success and
headquarters was removed to Dupont
street. ".La -Joheme," however, was
doomed to failure, and soon the sheriff's
lock ornamented the swinging doors. It
was then that Madame Rosa made offer
of her factory and the anarchists brought
their troubles to the Dupont-street cigar
store.
On Saturday evening last the society
added variety to its meeting by raffling a
picture of Pietro Gori, from the brush of
Angella Zocchi, and the rather small pro
ceeds were donated to the fund to sustain
the anarchist press.
Since the organization of the local
branch the anarchists have kist one influ
ential member, Arthur Biagi. Biagi ap
peared at one of the anarchist meetings
in a full suit of clothes and silk hat, and
for that offense one Bonini broke his face
and destroyed the remaining anarchistic
germs within the Biagi heart.
The Italian colony, though aware of the
existence of the band, expresses no un
easiness over the organization, and all
reference to it is met wtih an expressive
shrug and expansive smile.
Through more than two centuries the

ARTESIAN WELLSâ M. S. H., Trini
dad, Humboldt County, Cal. All water
that is obtained from artesian wells has,
at some time, been surface watenÂ»Â»F. H.
Newell on the subject of such wells says:
The principal condition upon which artesian
wells flow depends on the existence of pervious
strata, such as sandstone, inclined at & gentla
angle to the horizontal, and inclosed between
less pervious layers, an, for example, shalea
and clays. Also the higher edge of a pervious
bed thus conditioned must receive an abundant
supply of water either directly from rainfall
or from the drainage of the adjacent country,
and there must be little or no escape at lower
levels. When this bed Is full of water and the
water is not in motion the pressure at the
lowest part of the bed is equivalent to that
exerted by a column of water of the height
to which complete saturation extends. If, how
ever, there is a small outlet and the water
moves toward this the pressure at the lowest
point of the saturated rock will be reduced
and will be less and less, according as the
place of escape is made larger or is made
lower down. When water thus under pressure
finds for itself a natural outlet a spring is
formed, but when the bad is tapped artificially
by a drill hole and the water rises to the sur
face an artesian well Is the result. In all
cases water has come from higher ground by
working its way gradually down through the
minute interstices or crevices in the Inclined
rock, and, pressed by other particles behind,
rises through the easiest- outlet.

Special Correspondence of The Cull.
APIA, Oct. 3â As was to be expected,
the death of Malietoa has brought for
ward quite a crop of candidates for the
Kingship of Samoa. The return of
Mataai'a, the Catholic chieftain, who
has been held in exile for some years
by the Germans, has only complicated
:s. Naturally Mataafa's adher
ents, aaid they are many, are agitat
ing for his return to the throne, and
h^ seems to stand a fair chance of suc

When the steamer Mariposa left Apia
on October 3 there were no less than
four candidates for the throne In the
field. On the 30th of September the
Tumua party at Leulumoego sent a
dispatch to the Government at Mu
linun, informing them that it had been
decided to elect Mataafa 'King. This
coming from the rebels under Ta
masese, himself a claimant for the
throne, waa astounding news, but its
value w:;s discounted a few days later
when a letter came from Tamasese
himsi-!:. lie stated that, although he
and h.s party were present at the meet
ing which decided in favor of Mataafa,
he did not agree with the selection.
This is quite in accord with Samoan
; U tactics, for natives who hap

majority.
Just about the same time the loyal
natives of the Tuamasaga district, who
have th- privilege of naming the suc

they had chosen Faalata, a nephew of

this morning without a driver on the

With these bitter words of reproach
Evelyn McC'rasky, a tall, handsome bru

The attempted suicide was the result
of a heated quarrel Sunday evening be

M. Wall, Company C, First New York,
la in the military hospital paralyzed
from head to feet and suffering from a
severe concussion. He will recover, but
after several weeks of careful nursing.
Yesterday he could not move a muecle
in his body; last night, however, he
could bend hit! fingers and talk. His
condition is due to a dive in shallow
water at "Waikiki. his head coming in
contact with a rock at the bottom.
There were last night 130 patients in
the military hospital. One is quite low
of fever and may die. Malaria, rheu
matism and dysentery are the principal
ailments. Homesickness does not help
matters any. The rheumatism patients
are all from northern latitudes, which
is considered strange. There is more
malaria in the camps than was reason
ably to be expected. This is for the
most part due to the habits of the men.

lowing grounds: That the evidence was
conclusive and establishes beyond
question . that the llbelant was unlaw
fully and improperly imprisoned. In
sulted, assaulted and shamefully treat
ed by the master of the vessel; that the
evidence does not sustain the findings
of fact of the trial court in favor of :he
respondent nor is there any Justifica

the master or the respondents. The
libelant therefore excepts to all the
findings of the court and to the deci

In the matter of licenses, about which

If this is all that is asked by the

ders having been received for the export of
wheat, which has caused a sharp revival of
the forwarding- movement In that staple. This
has been followed by an advance in the Bank
of England rate of discount to 4 per cent.
Which has checked a revival of the tendency
toward imports of gold. These factors have
only slightly affected stocks: but. should the
European buying of wheat be kept up at the
present rate, the earnings of the Western roads
may induce a freer buying of securities. For
the time being, however, we have only a
traders' market, with no indication of out
etders or large local operators taking an active
Interest on the 'bull' side.
"There has been, in some quarters, a good
deal of loose talk about the condition of trade,
which has encouraged the 'bears' and led
come 'bulls' to keep out of the market. The
facts in the case are that, in the West and
Southwest, business Is. a? a rule, extraordtn- j
arily active and prosperous. Even in the
gouthâ which many have assumed must suffer
severely from 5 cent ccttonâ business is fairly
active, and the best opinion there Is to the j
effect that, owing to the large reductions made
la the cost of growing the staple, it can be !
sold at that price with a moderate profit. The :
planters appear to have widely emancipated
themselves from subjection to the factors by :
raising their own corn, pork and other arti- ;
cles of subsistence: which means that, at last, I
the South has placed Itself on the highway to
prosperity. Some complaint, however, comes
from the'districts anrl the railroads affected by
the yellow fever; which la relatively a small I
affair.
"To tell the truth, the talk about dullness of :
trade is a purely local misconception. It is
not to be denied that, in many articles, there I
Is still a downward tendency in prices, which.
In the wholesale trades, deprives business of
Its snap and makes buying gradual and con
tinuous Instead of occasional and in large par- '
eels. As New York stands between the In
terior buyer and the Eastern manufacturer.
It Is the focus at which this unsatisfactory
movement Is most conspicuous, and hence the :
Impression is received that business is dull, !
â while in reality its volume will be found, at j
the end of the season, to have been unusually
lapge. This difference in feeling between New !
York and the Interior cities is nothing new;
it generally happens in times of disturbance
In prices; and men competent to deal In
stocks intelligently should know enough to j
discriminate under such conditions, or they |
may have to pay the penalty of mistaken j
opinions."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET
NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â Only few days In
the history of the Stock Exchange can offer
euch a record of dullness and. apathy as that
of to-day. The Industrials still continued to
lead the market in volume of transactions, but
even in them business was comparatively In
. significant. The somewhat acute depression In
! to-day's foreign exchange on account of fears
' that there was a possibility for mischief In the
French-English controversy over the title to the
upper Nile was reflected here and drove prices
.down a sharp fraction at the opening-. The
market v.as so utterly sluggish and apathetic
that there was no possibility of retrieving this
early decline and prices dragged along at the
lower level throughout the day. Not the least
disquieting feature of the weakness of securities
â  in foreign markets is the vagueness of the ex
planations. All the favorable factors in the
business outlook are Ignored and there is no
aggressive leadership forthcoming for a bull
campaign. It is very evident, however, that
stocks are very closely held, so that the dull
ness of the market gives it an undertone of
strength. Lake Erie and Western preferred re
flected doubts over the dividend which was to
be acted upon at noon by an early dip of 7^4
and a subsequent rally of 10 points when the
declaration of the regular dividend was an
nounced. There were sharp declines In Lacka
wanna. New York Air Brake and Hawaiian
Commercial and some strengthening In Amer
ican Steel and Wire and Manhattan and a few
railroad stocks.
The bond market was as dull as the stock
market, but prlcps were better maintained.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 19.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says; The stock
markets were flat here to-day. They opened
dull, and prices steadily dwindled, closing at
the lowest. The reported resignation of the
French Premier and heavy sales from the
Paris Bourse, together with a little bear sell-
Ing here, were the main factors operating.
Both the political and the financial situations I
are far from clear. The best informed opera- I
tors, while anticipating neither a political nor |
a financial catastrophe, none the less are pre
pared for bad quarters of an hour In both di
rections. The Fashoda affair does not improve
with keeping while the financial situation in
Germany anlr Austria requires careful watch
ing.
I have some reason for thinking the Bank
of France rate may lie raised to-morrow to 3
per rent, partly because of politics and partly
through fears that New York may take gold
from them.
Americans were flat, but closed a fraction I
abuve the lowest.
Mines were dull on lack of Paris support,
and Spanish fours are weak on a few bear \
sales as a hedge.
The London discount market closed to-day |
with an upward tendency.
There Is talk of the Berlin Bank rafe going ;
to 6 per cent on Monday, but at present my i
Information tends against this.
MADRID, Oct. 19.â Spanish fours closed to
day at 64.25.

BOSTON. Oct. 19.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
There has been more activity in the Wool
market during the past week than for the
previous two months, the wiles so far ascer
tained being larger than those reported since
the week ending August IS. As we go to press,
also, negotiations are In progress which may
result in a considerable business later on.
There has been a comparatively fair represen
tation of manufacturers In the market who
have taken quite an amount of Territory and
fleece Wools. Since the cold snap set In there
has been a more spirited Inquiry for heavy
weights.
The features of the week's business have
been the transactions In the Territories, three
eighths and one-quarter blood fleeces, washed
and unwashed, and in Montevideo and Aus
tralian Wools.
The sales of the week in Boston amount to
1,756.0*) pounds domestic and 1,273,000 pounds
foreign, against a total of 1.190,000 pounds for
the previous week and a total of 3,043,000 for
the corresponding week last year.
Pales since January 1, IS9B. amount to 91,
141.000 pounds, against 322,861,100 pounds last
year at the same time.

MANY CHANGES
IN THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT
Dow Declares It Petty
Politics.
WAS PLANNED IN SECRET
THE MAYOR AND ENGINEER
ADOPT NEW RULES.
Police Commissioners' Hold a "Meet
ing- and Disagree on Every
Subject That Is
Brought Up.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Oct. 19.
The three gentlemen who compose the
: of Fire Commissioners, arid who
are also the Mayor, City Attorney and
City Engineer, held their usual monthly
seance this morning, and there was the
usual quarrel. City Attorney l>ow had
not been apprised of the fact that there
were to be sÂ«me sweeping changes made
in the Fire Department, and he whs
greatly surprised when Fire Chief Ball
recommended many changes, and more
surprised still that they were all reau.ij'
made by the votes of Mayor Thomas and
City Engineer Clement. The report
stated:
That 3. C. Kin*, foreman of Eneine Com
pany No. 8, be removed and A. A. Secotte.
extrarr.an of Ensine Company 3, be pr
, iltion; also that F. WlUibranda be
:ed extraman, vice A. A. t-ecotte, pro-
T: at M. J. Hanley be appointed extraman of
pany No. 3. vice K. A. Henninffa.
That M. Hallihan, foreman of Engine HO. 6,
be removed and John Rutherford be appointed
to tl . Uon.
That J. C Parsons, driver of Engine No. 5,
be removed and "William Hamb be appointed to
That George Weaver, foreman of Engine
i!:y No. 6, be removed and William Mc-
Grath l>e promoted from extraman Of Engine
. .:iy No. C
That Leslie Reed, foreman of Truck Com
pany No. 2. be transferred from fureman of
said company to extranian of Engine Com
pany No. 4. and J. J. Mulgrew, extraman of
N . 4. be promoted to foreman of
Truck No. 2. vice L>->t.'r Re< red.
That J. K. Waddocka, engineer oi Engine
â¢,y No. 6, be removed and E. Laperle,
engineer of Engine No. 1, be transferred to
raid tX'Sltion.
That A. M. Hutchinson be appointed en
of Engine Company No. 1. vice E. Lap
erie t:
1 also report that P. C. Smith, extraman
of Engine Company No. 6, has resigned, and I
recommend that George Drlscoll be appointed
to fill Bald vacancy.
"So you are starting out again to do
petty politics?" said Mr. Dow. "This is
some more of the star chamber business.
I suppose it was all put up beforehand
and that you knew of it In advance, did
you not?"
"I guess so," said the Mayor, to which
Dow replied: "You are mighty careful
not to have it get out, so that anybody
would know about it until the whole thing
is sprung."
When the report was recommended for
adoption, Mr. Dow said It was indecent to
sacriiice good men in order to do pett"
politics, He also said that although there
were seme good men recommended, i.c
would vote against the whole of the re
port, simply because the changes were
not recommended for the good of the de
partment but simply for political motives.
Another warm argument took place over
the adoption of some new rules for the
government of the department. Mr. Dow
said that the existing rules were gooÂ«*.
This was denied by Mr. Clement, but
when asked to point out wherein they
were not good, Mr. Clement said he couid
â > not call the defective ones to mind off
hand. The Mayor Bald he was ready to
vote for the adoption of the new rules,
and with Clement they became the iaw
for the department.
Some bills for repairing harness were
put in and Mr. Dow noticed that they
were all from one firm. He stated that
the Chief should scatter the orders
around, bo that work required for the
East Oakland houses should be done In
East Oakland and the same with West
Oakland. No objection was offered to Mr.
Dow's suggestion, and neither was the
Chief Instructed to follow it out.
SHOCKED BY A LIVE WIRE.
Engineer and Fireman of an Ala
meda Train Narrowly Escape
Serious Injuries.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 18.â A live wire of the
Alameda electric light plant nearly caused
the death of William McCauley, engineer,
and John Croll, fireman of engine 22, run
ning on the narrow road. The ac
cident happened near Encinal siati'jn.
One of the city's wires bad brok.n and
crossed a line hanging directly over the
narrow gauge tracks. Engineer McCauley
did not notice the danger a? his engine
rounded a curve near the station going
toward the pier. The wire struck
the smoke stack of the engine,
w.und ltsetf around it and pulled
it out of place. The electric- y
sputtered and spurted, burning a inaik
around the stack. The big locomotive was
thoroughly charged with the fluid, and
Engin.fr M<< 'auley say* that he plainly
felt the shock as he put his hand on the
throttle to shut off steam and stop his
train. .. Â
"The only thing that saved the lives
of Croll and myself," he said, "was the
fact that the engine whs running head
on and the wire struck the stack first.
Had we been going in the opposite direc
tion, so the -wirf would have struck into
the cab, we would undoubtedly have been
kllleJ."

A PROBLEM FOR
A PHILOSOPHER
OAKLAND, Oct. 19.â Over two hundred men appeared at the office of
thr- Btreet Superintendent this morning looking for employment. Only
forty could be employed for ten days at $2 per day, but six times
that number would like the privilege. Superintendent Miller says the task
of refusing so many is not one to be envied, as it Is not easy to choose
the deserving.
In the City Prison is John Lavin, who was a. sort of deputy foremen
of a street cleaning gang. Lavin started out Monday to celebrate and
wound up in jail fur drunkenness. As he was not near to the court he
was sent downstairs for three days.
Many of the men are chosen by the Councllmen, and naturally politics
cuts some flgurt- in the choice. Men who "is" politics do not always make
steady street employes, and the Street Superintendent who can set the
deserving to work, please Councilmen and keep his own head out of the
basket has need of much diplomacy.
MEADORS WEPT
BITTERLY ON THE
WITNESS STAID
Testified in His Own
Behalf.
DEFENSE ABOUT CONCLUDED
PRISONER RELATES WHY AND
HOW HE KILLED URY.
Reference to a Previous Murder Com
mitted in Arizona Completely
Unnerves Ury's
Slayer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 18.
James Nathaniel Meadors, the Boldler
who is on trial In Judge Ellsworth's court
j for the murder of Private Jonas Ury,
' wept and sobbed bitterly to-day, when
â  the defense opened the trial with the
: prisoner its a witness in his own behalf.
l*p to yesterday afternoon, when the
prosecution closed, Meadors appeared in
j.the most cheerful frame of mind; but not
iso when he was requested to give his
i version of the murder on the morning of
August 16. He reviewed at some length
the incidents of the quarrel, of Ury's
i bullying and threats. He said that Ury
had grabbed a rifle threatening to dash
his brains out, at the same time making
a move toward him.
â¢It was when Attorney Deuprey drew out
the story of his life, his boyhood days,
his marriage, nad facts concerning his
ten children, five of whom have passed
beyond, that the witness became moved to
tears. Meadors' frame shook perceptibly,
and he would at times wipe the tears
away. But when Deuprey drew out tacia
of Mi-adors" trial on the charge of killing
his uncle in Arizona, the prisoner com
pletely gave way to his feelings and wept
bitterly, saying, between sobs, after he
had partially regained composure, that he
did not care to talk about that matter.
He stated, however, that he had been ac
quitted.
Tliis afternoon Meadors further testi
fied that he had no animosity or ill-feel
ing toward the* dead soldier, and regard
ing the trouble to which Corporal Foster
had testified to yesterday, Meadors in
sisted that it grew out oi the tact that
Try owed him $3, which he refused to
pay. Being pressed fur payment I.'ry
had called witness a vile name and grab
bing a rifle threatened to knock out his
bramy. The prisoner denied that he had
i his knife prior to Ury's grabbing
the rirte.
On cross-examination Deputy District
Attorney Melvin asked witness to demon
strate to the Jury Hhe manner of the.
cutting. Melvin representing Ury, and wit
went through this performance
lly.
Handing Meadors the knife in evidence,
Mr. Melvin asked witness: "With which
blade did you kill Try?"
Attorney JH-uprey objected to this as
Improper languay--. and Judge Ellsworth
expressed himself as being unabie to Bee
why the pruseciitor adopted this form of
questioning. The Question was modified,
and witness pointed out the blade. He
too, that when Captain Barnes had
aski .i him why he had cut Ury, he had
replied that he <lid bo In defense of his
: ted that when he walked
up behind Try he put his left hand on
Ury's right Bhoulder, asking him, "What

Ury then swung around and struck him
with hia right hand, at the same time

DR. DUNN'S STAND.
For Seven Years He Has Stood for
Lake Improvement.
OAKLAND, Oct. 19.â Health Officer Dr.
J. T. Dunn hats published a statement in
which he shows that the dredging of
Lake Merritt is necessary to the public
health. The doctor quotes from an ar-
Ucle in last Monday's Call, which he sup
plements with facts and data to prove
that the drainage into Lake Merritt has
long been a great evil and is daily be
coming worse. Dr. Dunn shows that
Blnce 1891 he has been a persistent advo
cate of the improvement of Lake Merritt.
The new tax levy, which will in all
probability be adopted, provides for the
[Ing <>f the hike before the close of
the present fiscal year, and as the mud
taken from the lake will be used to fill
in the marsh land between Eighth and
Twelfth streets, the gTeater part of the
contemplated improvements advocated
by the Lake Merritt and Peralta clubs
are now assured.
OPPOSED TO BONDS.

OAKLAND, Oct. 19.â The West Oakland
Improvement Club has passed the follow
ing resolutions:

age out of Lake Merrltt should be built at the

Resolved, ' That the Oakland Library should
be kept open until 9 "lock in the evening
Without additional expense for salaries.
Resolved, That we believe the proper place
for a public park In Oakland Is on the Slx
nth-street marsh, where the abatement of a
nuisance and its beautlflcatlon as a park will
benefit the whole city.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1898.
YOUNG BELL
DISCHARGED
BY DOCTORS
His Mother Changes
Her Story.
THE LAD MAKES CHARGES
CONFLICTING EVIDENCE BE
FORE THE COMMISSION.
A Lover Named Martin Seems to
Have Been the Indirect
Cause of All the
Trouble.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 19.
John Logan Bell, the young waiter who
was arrested last night on complaint of ;
his mother, and charged with Insanity, j
was discharged this morning by Dra, Olm- i
sted and Milton. The boy's story as pub- j
lished this morning evidently exercised
great influence on Bell's mother and her
lover, for Mrs. Bell mado a peculiar ex
planation to the Insanity Commissioners.
Mrs. Bell stated that she did not know |
that she was arresting her son for insani- j
ty when she sent for the police yesterday.
She said she merely wanted him treated
at the Receiving Hospital for sickness,
and did not want, him sent to an asylum.
The doctors could find no evidence of In
sanity in young Bell, and the lad told
a peculiar story. He said that for some
years his mother had been desirous of
railroading him to a State asylum. He
laj s all his troubles at the door of a
man named John Martini, who is in love
with his mother. Logan quit his Job at
the Maison Piedmont restaurant a few
days ago, because he refused to work
an-i carry home his money which was
used for the support of his mother, so
long as Martini waa such a frequent visi
tor to the house.
"This Is simply an effort to get mo out
of the way," said young Bell. "Some
years ago my mother, without taking mÂ©
before a Judge, had me coniined at Ag
i:ews for a couple of yean. Her desire is
due to the fact that she wants to marry
Martini and 1 don't want her to."
Mrs. Bell admits that she is anxious to
marry Martini, but regrets that she is un
able to do so for six months, as she has
only been divorced that length of time
from her last husband. She admits that
Martini is a friend to her, and that the
alternative was to marry him or be
thrown into the street, as she had no
income of her own. She declared that
her son is a mental wreck and has threat
ened that both she and Martini will some
day be found in the Morgue. Martini is
said to be a steward on a coasting vessel.
Young Bell has had some notoriety and
was once tried for criminal assault. The
doctors, however, declare that it is quite
unreasonable to have him arrested for
insanity as he is quite bright enough to
take care of himself.
Lafayette Day In Alameda.
'ALAMEDA, Oct. ]y.â Lafayette day was
celebrated to-day in all the schools of this
city. T)iis evening Lafayette Hall was

Schools and the Circus.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 19.â The arrival of a
circus in Alameda will In future bo an
occasion for general rejoicing among the
school children. The Board of Education
has decided that it in absolutely qi
sary, because of small attendance at the
schools, to declare circus days holidays,
and hereafter when the "great three-ring
aggregations" come to town the boys
and girls of the Alameda schools will be
given a day off.
Wicker's Death "Was Accidental.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 19.â The Coroner made
an investigation to-day of the circum
stances surrounding the death of Freder
ick W. Wicker, who shot himself Sunday
at the home of 0. A. Lunt, Grand street.
All the testimony went to substantiate
the theory that the shooting was purely
accidental. The Coroner's jury returned
a verdict to that effect.
His Wife Put Him Out.
OAJvLAND, Oct. 19â Antone Dias of
San Leandro is detained at the County
Jail on a misdemeanor charge, preferred
by his spouse. It appears, according to
the husband that he and his wife bad
a family difference, resulting in the wife
telling him to "got out," and sending
his furniture after him. Mrs. Dias
thought she could do this, since the title
to the premises is In her name. Knder
advice from his attorney Dias, when at
first arrested several days ago and dls
DIED FROM THE EFFECTS
OF A YOUNG LION'S BITE
J. Franklin Brown, the Weil-Known Hyp
notist, Succumbs to Blood
Poisoning.
J FRANKLIN BROWN, tho well known hypnotist and man about town,
died in the German Hospital yesterday from blood poisoning, caused
Iby a lion's fany:s.
Several months ago Mr. Brown undertook to place a lion cub under a
hypnotic spell, when the animal sprang upon him and bu his hand. The
wound was slight, but blood poisoning set in. Brown was taken to the
German Hospital, where he was confined for many weeks. He finally re
covered sufficiently to leave the hospital, although he still suffered from
the effects of the wound. He would probably have recovered eventually,
but four days ago a slight scratch again brought on blood poisoning.
Brown went at once to the hospital, but the best medical skill could
not save him, and yesterday he breathed his lust.
J. Franklin Brown was one of the most popular men in town. He was
formerly Pacific Coast traveling agent for a Cincinnati distillery, with
headquarters in this city. When Kennedy, the hypnotist, made hia first
visit here a dozen years ago the two became close friends. Brown evinced
the greatest interest in the occult science and devoted several years to its
study, going to London, where he Joined the Hypnotic Society. He re
turned to San Francisco, practicing his science as a curative, but making
annual trips to London. Brown never displayed his abilities on the profes
sional stage, but was in great demand for private entertainments.
His powers were generally devoted to the cure of dipsomania, and
many men of this city can testify to his ability. He delighted In making
the lower animals subservient to his will, and it was while making such an
attempt that he received his death injury. One of Brown's most successful
feats In that way was when he placed a monstrous rattlesnake in a cata
leptic state some years ar o and used it as a walking stick, afterward

Chased Him With a Hatchet.
OAKLAND, Oct. 19.â A genuine case of
mistaken identity is probably responsible
for placing Ah Jim, a Fruitvale Chinese,
in the unhappy predicament of having to
answer t<> a charge of attempted assault
with a deadly weapon. The deadly weapon
Is a hatchet, with which Ah Jim chased
a boy who he thought had just prevlous
lv tormented him, but who turned put to
be an unconcerned and innocent lad. The
young and vindictive American, however
had the heathen pursuer arrested, and
tomorrow afternoon Ah Jim will have an
ooDortunlty to explain his mistake at a
preHminary examination in Justice Cliffs
court. â ;

BLAINE'S WAR ROMANCE.
Collector Jackson Investigates the
Strange Tale of a Wild Vol
unteer Officer.
Tn the opinion of Customs Collector
Jackson, Captain James G. Ulaine is a
degenerate son of a noble sire, and la a
romancer of no mean ability. A recent
issue nf tin- New Y'>rk Sun contains what
purports to tic an interview with the mili
tary roisterer, in which he said that he
arrived in San Francisco from Honolulu
with 900 cigars in his possession. Ele in
formed the customs inspector of that fact,
and added, "I BXa Captain James Q.
Blalne," whereupon the Inspector groveled
In the dust of the dock and the captain
walked ashore over the prostrate body of
the bumbled official.
Collector Jackson had the story investi
gated yesterday, and found that there
was not a particle of truth in the matter.
A.s great a personage as General Greene
was placed under the customs regulations
on his arrival here on the steamship
China and WO clears and a silk screen,
the latter valued at $350, were taken pos
session of by the customs officers and for

An Insane Prisoner.
Marcus Marquesan, a laborer, who was
sent to the Branch House of Correction last
â week by Judge Conlan for three months for
stealing carpenters' tools, was examined
by the Insanity Commissioners yesterday.
His case was continued until to-day. He
told Judge Conlan at the time he was sen
tenced that he stole the things to get
bread for his children, who were starv
ing. His wife stated yesterday that her
husband had a severe illness recently.

NOT RESIDENTS
Continued from First Page.
rary purpose merely, or for the purpose
of making it your home?
"Section 1239. The Board of Election,
in determining the place of residence of
any person, must be governed by the
following rules, as far as they are ap
plicable:
"3. A person must not be considered
to have lost his residence who leaves his
home to go into another State, or pre
cinct In this State, for temporary pur
poses merely, with the intention of re
turning-.
"4. A person must not be considered
to have gained a residence in any pre
cinct into which he comes for tempo
rary purposes merely, without the In
tention of making such precinct his
home.
"7. The place whore a man's family
resides must be held to be his residence;
but X it be a place of temporary es
tablishment for his family or for tran
eient objects it is otherwise.
"9. The mere intention to acquire a
new rt'sidpnee, without the fact of re
moval, avails nothing: neither does the
fact of removal without the intention."
Here Is to be seen the remarkable
fact that Mayor Phelan sets himself
up as being above the law, for, of
course. It is not to be supposed that he
had not fully advised himself before
U'king his stand In the matter. Other
lawyers, and .those the best in the city,
are of different opinion from that of
the hefting Mayor. These gentlemen
agTee with the code, and they say that
no one of the men who temporarily
changed hia residence in order to be
come eligible for candidacy will be en
titled to take his seat if elected, and
they say that it will be an easy con
tract to oust them all from the posi
tions.
Among those who are directly inter
ested in this question is Registrar of
Voters Bigtry. Mr. Biggy has done
good work in purging the great regis
ter of fraudulent voters, and naturally
the public would like to know what
stand he will take in this matter. To
a Call reporter he said last night that
had not Mr. Murphy resigned he should
have cited him to appear before the
Election Commissioners to show cause
why he should not be stricken from
the rolls. He said that Murphy's
was the only one which had been
brought to his attention, and when
asked what he would do regarding
Deasy, Byington, Bartlett and Gutte
he declined to go on record, and said
his future actions would speak for
themselves.
Mr. Biggy said: "If I find that a
man has nut complied with the law in
every respect I Mould treat him with
the same consideration as I would the
humblest citizen of San Francisco. Ac
cording to the law, the place where a
mati resides is his home, and he has no
right under the law to leave his family
and take up a residence in any other
portion of the city, where he has no
Intention of remaining. I have no
right to question a man's right to
change his residence, but I have the
right to question the registration of a
man who leaves his home and goes
from one precinct to another. The < 'all
has brought this to light, but since it
has been called to my attention I have
been looking into the matter.
"Mr. Murphy is a man with a family
and took up a residence in a precinct
other than the one in which his fam
ily resided. In his case I would have
been compelled to follow the law and
cite him to appear before the Election
Commissioners had he not resigned.
What my actions with the others will
be in the future they will have to speak
for themselves. The law is here and I
Will have to carry it out to the letter."
Mr. Biggy seems to have overlooked
the fact that he has nothing to dv with
the candidacy of the men in questlcm.
What his duties call upon him to do Is
to question the right of these men as
voters. Their names are on the great
register and they are there as voters.
["Whether Mr. Murphy is a candidate or
not is not the question. He is on the
great register as a voter from the Ninth
Ward and he lives in the Eleventh
Ward. It is the duty of the Registrar
to purge the register of that name.
Jeremiah Deasy admits that his resi
dence in the Tenth Ward is temporary
and for election purposes. Lewis By
lngton's residence in the Seventh Ward,
Lewis Bartlett's residence In the Third
Ward and Isadore (Jutte's residence in
the. Fifth Ward are all admittedly tem
porary. The law is plain and specific
on this point and it is Mr. Blggy'a duty
to enforce that law. Il*- says he will
treat all aMke. This being th^ case let
him cite Isadore Gutt.% Jeremiah Deasy,
Lewis Byingtun and Lewis Kartlett be
fore the Election Commissioners to
Bhaw cause why their names should
not be stricken from the great register.
MRS. CORA PLUNKETT
GRANTED A DIVORCE
DECBEE ISSUED ON THE GROUND
OF CRUELTY.
The matrimonial differences that have
long existed between < 'ura B. Plunkett
and her husband, V.'llliarn T. Plunkett.
were brought to an end yesterday by a
decision rendered by Judge Hebbard. A
decree of divorce was granted Mrs. Plunk
ett on the ground of < rut-lty, and the err
ing football player and school teacher was
ordered to pay alimony in the sum of $30
monthly.
Plunkett's eccentricities are responsible
for yesterday's culmination of his mar
ried life. For months he treated his wife
In a. manner that finally forced the pro
ceedings for divorce. A month after the
euit for divorce was filed by Mrs Plunk
ett proceedings were abandoned, Plunkett
haying- relented and affected reconcilia
tion with his wife. His cruel treatment
coon commenced again, however. An
other suit was filed and Mrs. Plunkett
obtained judgment.
Mary E. Butler has been granted a di
vorce, from Allan Butler on the ground
of desertion. Mary Vanderkaay has been
granted a decree of divorce from William
vanderkaay on the ground of extreme
cruelty. Amanda E. Davis was granted
a divorce from Luther Davis yesterday
on the ground of desertion. Anna West
has sued Charles M. West for a divorce,
alleging cruelty. Harry A. Odell asks
for a divorce from Mary L. O. Odell on
the ground of desertion. Suits for divorce
on the ground of failure to provide have
been filed by Jane Evans against Edward
Evans and Daley Davenport against P. C.
Davenport.

MEDICINE TO
BE HONORED IN
A NOBLE HOME
Affiliated Colleges to
Open.
AN IMPORTANT DEPARTURE
ON SATURDAY THE UNIVERSITY
WILL CELEBRATE.
Hints That the Step. Is Fraught
With Significance for the Ele
vation of Therapeutic
Science.
Invitations are Issued for the opening
exercises of the medical department of
the University of California in its new
In une, .south of Golden Gate Park, on Sat
urday afternoon, the 22d inst.
The programme as now arranged will
consist of twelve numbers, several of
them musical selections, and will include
addresses by Governor Budd, or in his
absence, by Mayor J. D. Phelan, Profes
sor Martin Kellogg, president of the uni
versity; Dr. R. Beverley Cole, president
of the medical department, and Dr. Wash
ington Dodge, as tiie representative of the
medicai faculty. The exercises are to
commence at 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
and following- them a cold lunch will be
served In one of the larger lecture rooms.
It will be recalled that the bill authoriz
ing the erection of buildings for the attUi
ated colleges of the State University, and
appropriating the sum of $2j0,000 for that
purpose, was passed by the last State
.Legislature, and with the signature of
Governor Budd, became a law.
Immediately after the passage of this
act there were many heated discus<!=i"ns
among the faculties of the medical, den
tal, law ajul pharmacy departments as to
the site to be chosen tor the proposed
buildings. The matter was finally settled
by the acceptance, on the part of the
joint faculties, of the gift of the late
Adolph Sutro of several acres of land
to the southwest of and overlooking the
park.
Since the laying of the corner stone,
now nearly two years ago, nothing much
has been heard of the affiliated colleges,
though visitors to the park have watched
the accumulating pile of yellow brick on
the high ground to the southwest. The
buildings nave slowly reared themselves
above the sand hill in front of the grade
on which they are placed, and now pre
sent a beautiful sight to the chance visi
tor to the park, who has not passed that
way since their erection. They may be
inconveniently located, but the fact can
not be denied that they are a magnificent
sight and add greatly to that section of
the city. And, too, they are well and
solidly built, the foundation and tirnt
story being of Folsom granite, with the
u;>prr stories of pressed brick.
The buildings themselves are four in
number, the medical college having the
central position, with the law college on
Its left and the dental and pharmacy col
on Its right, and the veterinary col
almost directly behind. In the rear
of the medical college building and con
nectlng with it. is the large auditorium.
It is horstshoe shaped and planned to ac
commodate nearly a thou.sa.nd persons;
here will be held the actual exercises of
upening the building on Saturday after
noon.
Interest centers upon the medical de
partment at this time, for the reason
that it Is the first to try the experiment
of life in the new home provided by the
State; the other colleges, it Is under
stood, will not at present occupy the
State's gift to them. Dr. R. Beverley
when Interviewed upon the subject
said:
"The medical college alone has shown
an inclination to aid itself and the State
University In this matter of securing a
new home. The faculty of the medical
department have saved all the money
earned by the students' fees for several
years past, and It is this money which
has furnished the new building for us.
The State has not paid one cent for fur
nishing the building, but the faculty has
devoted the earnings to this purpose, and
has not, as in the case of the dental de
partment, divided its earnings among its
members."
It is understood that the sum thus
saved from medical students' fees and
applied to furnishing the building, is
very nearly $20,000.
But tills occasion will mean something
moie than the simple opening of a new
building for the medical department. It
is not generally known, but it is a fact
nevertheless, that the opening will mark
the passing of the control of the affairs
of the medical department out of the
hands of its faculty, very largely, and
into the hands of the regents of the State
University. What will be the future of
this branch of the State's educational
Bystem r> mains to be seen, but it is given
on the authority of one of the regents
that no changes will be made until after
a new president has been chosen to suc
ceed Professor Kellogg, who will go out
of office by virtue of his resignation, in
March. 1899.
Several of the regents have expressed
their desire to see the medical department
of the State University become the lead
ing medical school of this country. Some
time ago a joint committee, consisting of
three members of the Board of Regents,
and the sani" number of representatives
of the medical department faculty, was
appointed to devise ways and means and
arrange a plan for the remodeling and
Improvement of the medical department.
It is understood that this committee has
entered into correspondence with Johns
Hopkins Medical School, in order to aa
certain the plan of operating that institu
tion, and trie cost thereof. Prom the
game member <if the Joint committee tt
is learned that several faculty chairs will
be Balaried, and that eminent men in
various lines of work will be sought for
to till these positions and devote all their
time to the college work. The new build
ing is well provided with room for labora
tories of all sorts, but for these to be
of any value it will be necessary In the
opinion of the joint committee, that the
chiefs of these laboratories be given suffi
cient salaries and that they be required
to give all their time to the work.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1898.
A HUMAN EYE
AS A SOUVENIR
FOR A "LADY"
Grisly Gift in a Case of
Human Skin.
MORE PERVERTED STUDENTS
A SHOEMAKER'S REQTTEST FOR
SKIN FOR FOOTWEAR.
Doctors at the Hospitals Show
Strange Apathy Over the Hor
ror â Public Sentiment
Outraged.
Since the Investigation Into the unlaw
ful use of human skin has been going on,
new uses to which the medical students
and younger physicians are putting the
remnants of poor humanity are contin
ually cropping up. The students seem
rather proud of their exploits than other
wise.
Dr. Hopkins, the house physician at the
City and County Hospital, says that per
sonally he knows nothing about this pur
loining of skin.
"But Dr. Hopkins," he was asked, "how
is it that half a dozen tanners make no
secret of the fact they are in the habit
of tanning skin which every one of them
says has been taken from the City and
County Hospital?"
'"I am sure I cannot say. I know I
never have had any skin tanned."
"Have you ever seen any that was tan
ned by some one else?"
"I have seen a piece which was tat
tooed beautifully with flags. It was cut
off and tanned as a curiosity, but there
was not enough of it for slippers."
"More doctors than one say that they
have Keen skin out off a body after an
autopsy by internes of the City and Coun
ty Hospital. The skin was openly cut off
and wrapped up in paper with thr avowed
Intention of having it tanned. Have you
never seen it done?"
"I only can say I know nothing about
it."
"Who are the other internes of the hos
pital?"
"Well, there are Dr. F. J. Tillman, Dr.
H. Abram, Dr. T. E. Roche, Dr. E. S.
Lucetti, Dr. P. S. Brugier, Dr. M. R. Gib
bons, a eon of Dr. Henry Gibbons Jr., Dr.
C. A. Prenholtz and Dr. C. P. Mattox."
"Have you never known any of these
physicians to have in their possession any
form of tanned human akin?"
"One of them says he has a razor strop
which is a particularly line one."
"Where did he get It?"
"How can 1 say that."
"Well, personally. Dr. Hopkins, do not
you think this Is an outrageous practice?"
"Well, It Is a matter of sentiment. They |
may have all my skin when I am j
through with it If they want It."
George Purlencky la a student at
Cooper Medical College whose name has :
been prominently mentioned us one who
Bays he can get skin. He has promised i
at least one girl that he will give her a
belt.
Dr. Ernest Plllsbury. lecturer In bac
teriology at Cooper College, said:
"Yes, this Is not ax much all imagina
tion as I wish It were. While I was pro
sector of the college a shoemaker, a
prominent well known man at Menlo
Park, asked me to get him enough skin
for two pairs of shoes. He said If I would
he would make up one pair for my own
use free."
"lie knew something about human skin
when he tanned them?"
"Oh yes, he had had one pair of shoes
made of tanned human Bkln. They wore ,
out so many soles that he thought they
were the most economical shoes ho had
ever had. Besides being so durable they
were soft and neat."
"Could you have got the skin for him?"
"Yea, easily. I did not, however, for I i
did not fancy the Idea. It Is not a
pleasant feeling to be walking In some
dead man's shoes, I should think, so I did
not get him the skin. I know some of
the students do dreadful things and dis
graceful ones. They think it Is smart to
carry around portions of bodies. Create
public opinion against such practices and
you accomplish a great deal."
Though public opinion Beemfl strong
enough against these disgusting practices,
It is individual opinion which permits
such things as occurred In Berkeley re
cently. Some students of Toland pre
pared a human eye by soaking it In al
cohol and formaline. It was then covered
with a fixative and set In a leather case
made of human skin.
The souvenir of horrors was presented
to a young woman and still decorates her
room.
A woman well known as a leader of
fashion In San Francisco said:
"I have seen at least three belts made
of human skin on girls. They were with
out exception young girls who were in
terested In medical students, who gave
them the belts and Influenced them to
wear the skin against the girl's better
sense.
"I would not have such a thing on my
self nor allow any one about me who
did wear anything so vulgar and disgust
ing.
"There Is no limit to the absurdity In
which medical students fall, but they are
more to blame than the girls. When a
girl Is In love with a man he can per
suade her that he Is a criterion In all
things if sets about it.
'â¢Let us hope that The Call can put a
stop to this practice which, besides being
most repulsive and degrading is not fair
to those whose bodies are given to sci
ence. The advancement of science Is the
only excuse possible for the desecration
of the dead.
THE VALENCIA SAILS.

GOLDEN GATE
BACKS FAITH
WITH DOLLARS
New Ferry Finds Mon
eyed Sponsors.
NEARLY $50,000 SUBSCRIBED
A ROUSING MASS-MEETING AT
GOLDEN GATE.
The Argument and Cash of Repre
sentative Citizens Poured
Out With Liber
ality.
The people of the pretty village of
Golden Gate and the people of Oakland
have backed their faith in the promise
of the Realty Syndicate to estab lÃh a
competing ferry service with good, hard
cash.
An enthusiastic mass meeting was held
at Kllnkner'a Hall, Golden Gate, last
evening and representative citizens of
that town and of Emeryville came to
gether and discussed with the representa
tives of the syndicate the ways and
means of the proposition.
P. W. Beardslee, for the syndicate,
told them that the minimum estimate of
the cost of the ferry service to be built
between San Francisco and Berkeley was
$1, 500. 000, and that of this amount the
syndicate purposed borrowing $250,000 for
five years at 6 per cent interest.
Mr. Beardslee said his say in few words,
but the response was spontaneous and im
mediate.
It was a voice from the audience, and
the burden of it was "Put me down for
$500, with more when its needed." That
started things and It didn't take the peo
ple of North Oakland long to demon
strate that there was no loud noise needed
to waken them. With the amount sub
stribed last night the total money prom
ised during the past week totals nearly
$50,000.
There was a good bit of warm talk mixed
in with the business of the meeting.
J. Rouke, one of Golden Gate's fore
most men, said: "I have Investigated this
m itter thoroughly during the last two
weeks, and all that 1 can subscribe 1
shall subscribe, for I am satisfied that
the Syndicate proposes to make good its
promise. I am going to subscribe and it
will help every one of you to do so, for
the moment that the first rock is thrown
into the bay for the new mole your prop
erty here will go up In value high enough
to pay it back to you. The Syndicate only
asks Oakland for one-fifth of what this
will cost, but almost every dollar, of that
one-fifth means a friend and a patron fur
the ferry.
"Just put me down for $T>oo now and
later we will talk business again."
Others followed Mr. Rouke both with
argument and with cash, and both spoke
loudly, for Golden Gate's population Is
made up of cool-headed buslnt-ss men,
who do not spend money out of senti
ment.
At the close of the meeting those who
were present decided to organize perma
nently as an Improvement society, so
that by the power of their organization
they shall be better able to demand priv
ileges of the county and city govern
ments and do concerted work in further
ing the ends of the new ferry that means
bo much to them.
They will meet again next Monday
evening.

Philip N. Llllenthal, manager of the
Anglo-Callfornlan Hunk: "I do not be
lievo the Manufacturers' Association has
riven Mayor Pbelan any such Indorse
ment. The membership Is too nearly
equally divided politically to take any
such action. I have certainly not heard
of it at any rate. I do not attend Its
i meetings, but from my knowledge of its
purposes 1 am positive the organization
is not making anybody's political fight.
It will certainly be useless for the objects
for which it was formed if it la."
W. If, Crooker. president of the Crock
er- Woolworth National Hank: "Mayor
1 Pbelan seems to have cast dignity to the
: winds, but ho is In a desperate way Just
now. Evi-ii if he did have the Indorse
j ment of the Merchants' Association It
would i>e a most undignified method of

Its name it is because of his desperation.
Mr. Phelan is losing ground steadily; he
! has forfeited many votes in the past
week. Men In the highest standing in the
community who supported him two years
1 ago have turned against him. Bentfment
Is changing against him every day. It Is
noticeable in the clubs and other places.
A man like Mr. Phelan, who Is a member
of all the- club--, and kindred organizations,
ought to know how to conduct himself
even during a political campaign with dig
nity but Mr, Phelan certainly seems to
have forgotten everything but his greed
for office. There seems to have been a
great change In him during the past year,
and 1 cannot see why Republicans snould
support him now. They will not, nor will
many of those of his own political faith.
The Merchants' Association has not nor
â will it indorse htm."
Thomas Magee, real estateâ l have
heard absolutely nothing about the Mer
chants' Association's indorsement of
Mayor Phelan, and It does not seem like
ly that such action would bo taken.
E. 8. Spear, auctioneerâ l don't know
anything about such an Indorsement and
do ,not believe Mayor Phelan has been
honored with it. The association Is not
In politics. Mayor Phelan Is, however,
and he has a hard fight on hand. He has
lost many votes ana he is making des
perate efforts to get them back. Well,
ho needs them. Ho Is utterly lacking In
dignity In this campaign. He rails against
the bosses but he Is the greatest boss of
thorn ail.
Frank J. Vail, Junior partner of the firm
of Sanborn, Vail & Company and first
secretary or the Merchants' Associationâ
The statement that the Merchants' Asso
ciation, acting as a body, has cither offi
cially or unofficially given Indorsement to
Mr. Phelan's candidacy is an unqualified
lie. Individual members havo probably
expressed their preference one way or an
other for there are both Patton men and
Phelan men in the association, but the
association has indorsed no one, nor can
it under its constitution.
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the as
sociation, would not speak officially for
the association, as his leave of absence is
still In foreÂ© and he has not yet resumed
tho duties of his office. Personally,
though, he was willing to speak. "The
statement that thÂ» Merchants' â¢ Associa
tion has indorsed Mr. Phelan Isan abso
lute untruth. Politics does not come un
der the province of the association. Mr
Phelan spoke at our banquet the other
day, but not upon political matters nor
anything akin to politics. Campaign
questions were tabooed even If any on<*
had been Inclined to broach thorn. Mr
Pholan has for years been very close to
the association, ns he is one of Its promi
nent members and hardest workers, but if
there Is any preference for him it Is In
dividual.
Marcus Heeht of the firm of Hecht
Brothers & Co., 312 Pino street, said: "Al
though I am not active In tho affairs of
the association I am sure that no action
looking to the Indorsement of any politi
cal candidate has been taken. The by
laws of thÂ« association do not permit it
I should have been Informed if any such
action had been taken, and I do not be
lieve that It has."
Isaac Upham, of the firm of Payot
Upham & Co.â l don't think the associa
tion has tnkon any such action as Is stated
Indorsing Phelan for Mayor. The report
must have been given circulation by the
Mayor and. his adherents, as it could not
possibly come from the association. I
think it would be Impudent In the ex
treme to introduce politics into an or
ganization, the main prestige of which
is derived from business men who de
pend upon It for the furtherance of busi
ness and not political ends. Individually
I don't know what the members have
done, but aa a body I do know they have
not taken any such ridiculous measures
to support Mr. Phelan. It seems to me
absurd that even Individually the mem
bers would pledge themselves -to any
candidate, as every man likes to choose
for himself how and for whom he shall
cast his vote. I think the rumor has been
circulated by Phelan's adherents and not
the Merchant* 1 Association."
The manager of the firm of Kittle &
Co. maintained: that the report circulated
by Phelan's henchmen was,- as far as he
knew, untrue and without the least foun
dation. "Although I have heard but lit
tle about > the rumor that the loading
merchants of the city had pledged them
selves to support Phelan, I know, never
theless, that there is not the slightest

PATRICK KEENAN FATALLY SHOOTS
HIS WIFE ANNA AND STABS HIMSELF
She Was Recently Granted a Decree of Separation and Refused
to Live With Hii Again.
A 8A 8 a climax to years of marital un
haplneHS Patrick J. Keenan, bet
ter known as Patsy Hogan, ex
pugllist. fatally shot his wife,
Anna, yesterday afternoon and at
tempted to end his own life at her
residence, 122 Olive avenue.
In June last Keenan and his wife
separated, and she applied for a dl
vorce. The divorce was not granted,
but on September IS she was granted
a decree of separation with an allow
ance of 130 per month and the custody
Of tho five children, the oldest a girl
of 16.
Yesterday about noon Keenan called
upon hiÂ» wife. He begged her to make
It up and live with him again. She
refused, as she plainly told him she
did not love him any more. She had
been preparing to fro to the dentist,
and wanted him to leave, as she was
late. For about an hour Keenan con
tinued to urge her to return to him, and
finally he asked her if she went with
any other man. She replied "No," and
he remarking, "Well, wo can't live
apart," pulled a revolver out of his
pocket and tired at her four times. Then
ho struck her on the forehead with the
butt end of the revolver and she /ell
across tho bed. She Implored him not
to hit her any more and she would
go back to him, and begged him to
give her a drink of, water. Keennn,
brought her a glass of water and lift-
Ing her head up from the bed poured
it down her throat.
Realizing what he had done he
placed the revolver to hlÂ« right temple
and fired, TTUt the bullet lodged in the
colling and the only evidence of the
â hot were powder marks on his tem
ple. Hlh revolver had by this time
been emptied of its cartridges, and
pulling his penknife out of his pocket
he stubbed himself live times in the re
gion of tho heart. The blade had to
paM through his vest and a striped
shirt and two thick undershirts, which
prevented it from reaching the heart.
The oldest daughter was in the
house with the two youngest children,
and hearing the shots coming from
their mother's bedroom she ran out of
the house with the children - to the
next door neighbor. A telephone mes
sage was 6Â«nt to the Central Police
Station and Sergeant Nash and Police
man Phillips hurried to the house.
They found Keenan and his wife
stretched out on the bed. The pen
knife was sticking in Keenan's breast,
Where he had left It after the fifth
thrust. Phillips pulled the knife out
and Sergeant Nash summoned the am
bulance and patrol wagon. . v :
Mrs. Keenan was conscious, and im
plored the sergeant to take her away.
She never complained as she was be
ing carried down to the ambulance.
Keenan pretended that he was dead,
but while being carried to the patrol
wagon he opened his eyes and asked
: : --^'"U : "i:

cal honors. The whole thing s a farce
and should be stopped before it gains a
semblance, of truth by constant reitera
tion Bloss of the firm of Tallin Slow i &
Co refused to make a decided statement
as to the truth or falsity of the report
owing to his Ignorance aÂ« to the affairs
of the association. He maintained, how
ever that his impression was that the
rumor was false. He failed to we bow
it was possible for an organization of this
kind to injure itself In the community by
supporting any one candidate.^ firm of
Mr. McConnell. cashier of the firm of
Sherwood & Sherwoodâ lf I were to
make a candid expression of opinion on
this circulated lie I would .say that it
comes from the adherents of Phelan and
not the members of the Merchants Asso
ciation. Tho rumor is absurd. â No man
who claims the right of citizenship would
bind himself to support Fhelan or any
body else. The men of this organization
are independent, and are not catering to
political demagogues that they may be
appointed to some subordinate office In
cose the man to whom they pledge them
selves Is elected. There has been no such
action takenâ there couldn't be. It would
bo an imprudent move on the part of the
association that would inevitably drag it
down in the community from the high
position which It now maintains, to a con
dition of distrust from which It would
never recover.
Hinry L. Dodge of the firm of Dodge,
Sweeney & Co., wholesale provision and
commission merchants, said: "I think
the whole report Is simply a concocted
f< heme of Phelan'a supporters to create
the Impression nmonn the general public
that he has been Indorsed by the mem
bers and thereby procure votes in his
favor. I was always of the Impression
that the majority or the members of the
association were Republicans. If this is
true It is absurd to believe that any such
action has been taken."

MASKED MEN
TRY TO HOLD
UP A TEAMSTER
They Threatened to
Shoot Him.
Bold Crime of Two Men at the Foot
of Seventh Street â The Po
lioe on Their
TraiL
"Pull up, you â â , or we will
fill you with lead."
Thus Bpoke two masked men aH they
seized the horses attached to one of the
wagons of the Standard OH Company at
the foot of Seventh street Tuesday even
ing. Thu threat was hurled at the driver,
who was on his way to the workn with
the receipts of his day's labor. Realizing
that the men meant to rob him, the
driver applied the whip to his team in
the hope of circumventing- them. The
horses, which were being held by the
robbers, dualicd madly along the road,
dragging the robbers after them. Find
ing that they could not stop the team
they relinquished their hold oil the
horses. The driver, fearing that they
would attempt to shoot him, continued
to ply his whip upon the horses until the
works was reached.
The driver hurriedly told his fellow
workers of what had happened and a
posse was at once organized to pursue the
masked robbers. They quickly repaired
to tho scene of the attempted hold-up,
but were unable to find a trace of the
men.
Word was aent to police headquarters
and several officers were dispatched to
assist in rounding- up the destH-rate pair.
After a long search one of the pursuers
found a slouch hat, which is supposed to
have been dropped by the robbers.
Yesterday the driver of the wagon vis
ited the office of Chief I^ees and made a
statement of the occurrence. He said that
the robbers evidently knew that he had
considerable money in his possession. The
amount represented the receipts his day's
work.
"After passing Channel street," he re
marked, when telling his story, "I drove
along the road, being anxious to reach
the oil works. I had gone but a short
distance when out of the darkness ap
peared two men. They both wore masks,
and as thoy shouted to me to "pull up'
th >v grabbed the horses by the bridles.
"Realizing that they Intended to rob
me 1 struck the horses with the whip.
The animals reared in the air ami then
dashed madly down the road. To my
great surprise the men clung to the horses
as If determined to rob me or die in the
attempt. I continued to use the whip,
and when a short distance away from
the scone of the attempted hold-up they
released their hold on tho horses and fell
In the road. I expected that they would
try to shoot me for not allowing them
to rob me, and for that reason I old not
chfiok the horses until the works was

himself. (Defendant Ke^nan brought be
fore Mm. Keenan and Identified.) I Iden
tify Patrick Keenan M my husband and
as the man who shot me.
Keenan was taken to the hospital in
the patrol wagon and he had to wait
on a stretcher till Dr. Hartley was
finished with examining his wife. The
doctor found five wounds In the region
of the heart, but none had pierced the
chest cavity. There was a Bcalp
wound on his right temple, where he
had attempted to shoot himself. He
displayed considerably less fortitude
than his wife.
The bedroom where the shooting
took placo bore no evidences of a
struggle. Bullet marks on the walls
and on the ceiling were the only slaps
of the murderous assault. The child
ren are being cared for by Mrs. Walte,
128 Olive avenue. They did not seem
to realizo their loss.
Keer.axi as "Patsy Hogran" was a
well-known pugilist .twenty years ago.
He first came Into prominence during
the palmy days in Nevada, After quit
ting the prize ring he started a saloon
on Morton street, near Kearny, and
for a time was prosperous, but ever
since he acted as referee in the cele
brated Corbett-Choynskl fight he has
been on the down grade. Six years
ago- he became a member of the Fire
Department and is at present attached
to Chemical Engine 4, on Eddy street.
Friends say that since the separation
from his wife he has been drinking
heavily. There were, It Is said, faults
on both sides.
FIVE PERSONS
POISONED BY
FISH LIVERS
Family of Mrs. Block
% Stricken Down.
Violent Illness With Symptoms of
Ptomaine Poisoning Followed.
An Investigation to
Be Made.
A serious case of ptomaine poisoning
has developed at the home of Mrs. R.
Block, 406 Van Ness avenue. Five per
sons are stricken with serious Illness and
one of the victims may die.
On Tuesday Mrs. Block and her family
partook of some fresh codfish livers.
Soon afterward two of her children, Fan
nie, aped 17, and Phillip, aged 7, were
taken violently 111, vomiting and com
plaining of severe cramps in their stom
achs. Headache followed quickly and
then a high fever. About half an hour
later the oldest daughter, Olga, aged 27,
was seized with the same symptoms.
Later two male boarders, named .Frank
Draper and Harry Campbell, were Vtrlck
en and all five of the sufferers were soon
in bed. Mrs. Block, who had not par
taken of the liver, was the only one who
escaped the symptoms. She did not ap
preciate the seriousness of the matter
and neglected to call a doctor until yes
terday morning, when she telephoned for
Dr. Levin, of Sixth and Mission streets,
asking him to come and prescribe. After
a few hours of vigorous treatment all of
the sufferers except Olga and Fannie
showed marked signs of improvement.
The two girls, however, remained very ill
and up to last midnight Fannie was still
In a critical condition. The doctor stated
to Mrs. Block that the worst phase of the
illness might develop later.
Notice of the case was sent to the health
officer, and it is expected that a thorough
investigation will be made to-day to as
certain. If possible, where the livers were
purchased and then the point from which
the codfish came. There Is much scien
tific interest attached to the case, inas
much as ptomaine poisoning is as yet
but Imperfectly understood by physicians
and especially poisoning in fish livers'
Some time ago. It will be remembered
that poisoned shrimps were reported in
the waters off Butchertown and the
Board of Health instructed the City
Chemist to obtain samples of the shrimps
for analysis. This has not yet been done
owing to some delay in fitting up the*
laboratory in the city building, but Pro
fessor Green expects to secure the
shrimps for analysis during the coming
week. It is probable that an analysis of
the codfish livers will follow.

MILLIONS IN
GOLD FROM
AUSTRALIA
The Largest Shipment
Ever Brought Here.
CAME ON THE MARIPOSA
TURNER TO FIT OUT THE AT
LANTIC TRANSPORTS.
Troopships for Cuba and Porto Bico
to Be Fixed Up in a Similar
Manner to the Manila
Fleet.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Mariposa arrived from Sydney, N. S. \\\,
via Auckland, N. Z., Apia, Samoa and
Honolulu, H. 1., yesterday morning. The
voyage was a very pleasant one, with the
exception of the run between Sydney and
Auckland, where very heavy weather was
encountered. The Mariposa would have
bce^ a great prize for a privateer. She
not only carried a valuable cargo, but
aiHo had In her treasury $3,670,wu in gold.
This was all in English sovereigns, which
will be turned Into good American money
at the Mint here.
This is the largest shipment of gold that
has ever come to San Francisco In one
vessel. The Alameda on her last voyage
brought over three millions In sovereigns,
but the Marlposa beats her large consign
ment by fully half a million. This sum
doea not represent the balance In trade
between Australia and this port alone,
but also money owing by English houses
to New York merchants. The merchants
in Sydney and Melbourne owe money to
the merchants in England and the latter
â¢.we money to houses in New York and
San Francisco. It is cheaper to send the
gold from Sydney than from London,
, and In consequence San Francisco Is made
! the point at which all contracts are set
! tled and debts wiped out.
Things were quiet in Samoa when the
Marlpcsa left, but no one knew what a
day might bring forth. There was in
port the English men-of-war Ringdove
and Porpoise and the German gunboat
Buzzard.
Among the passengers by the mall boat
from Honolulu was l->r. H. B. Emmerson.
He has been very sick from malarial fe
ver, but is now slowly getting better.
Lieutenant Crowell of the Pennsylvania
Regiment that went to Manila also re
turned by the Mariposa. He was able to
be about a little during the passage. J.
H. Glng and C. R. Snodake returned from
Sydney. They left here on the schooner
Sophie Sutherland to search for gold In
the Solomon Group, but the expedition
was a failure. The schooner reached port
from Samoa some weeks ago, and Glng
and Snodake are the last of the gold
hunters to get back home.
T. R. Turner, purchasing agent of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, is
back from New York, whither he was
called by the quartermaster general of
the army. His folding bunks have been
put In nearly all the transports in use on
this coast. The accommodations in the
Ohio and Indiana are now being torn out
and the patent bunks put in. With the
old arrangements five, six and. even seven
men had to sleep abreast, but with the
new state of affairs each man will have a
separate bunk, which can be folded up
and put out of the way when not in use.
It was In connection with these bunks
that Mr. Turner was called East.
According to the New York- Herald,
Government thought so much â of Mr.
Turner's idea that all the transports on
the Atlantic are to be fitted out with it.
The Mobile was being got ready for the
accommodation of 2600 troops when he left
for home, and the alterations to the Mo
hawk, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Minne
waska. Michigan, Roumania, Manitoba
and Obdam were to follow. The chances
are that the prizes captured by Samp
son's â Rita, Panama and Martura â
will also be turned Into transports and
they also will be fitted out with the San
Francisco article. The transports on tue
Atlantic and the Scandia and Arizona,
Nero and Brutus on the Pacific are to be
kept In readiness for infantry, cavalry
and artillery transportation.
The Willscott. and Blalrmore will soon
have their American rig and be ready for
sea. The Willscott, It will be remem
bered, was dismasted on her way from
Japan to Puget Sound, and put in here
under a Jury rig. while the Blalrmore was
capsized In the harbor and her masts had
to be cut away before she could be raised.
Both vessels will be bark rigged after
American Ideas. The Willscott will be
heavily sparred, as she ' was before her
accident, but the Blalrmore's lower masts
are each six feet shorter, and six feet nas
been taken off the length of each yard.
There Is, therefore, no fear of her ever
capsizing again. The Willscott on ncr
maiden voyage will go from here to Na
nalmo, B. C, to load coal for Honolulu,
thence to New York with a load of sugar.
Charles Olsen, the able boss stevedore
of the Oceanic Steamship Company, Is on
the sick list. On Tuesday night he su
perintended the coaling of the Australia
at the sugar refinery, but yesterday he
was unable to be on deck to look out for
the Marlposa. It is to be hoped that
genial Charley's illness will be a short
one.
The transport Zealandla has gone to the
sugar refinery to coal for her next voy
age to Manila. Joseph Seeley and J. U.
Penfleld, two of the cHief stewards,
change places. Mr. Seeley goes back to
his old love, the Australia, and the route
on which he is such a favoriteâ Honoluluâ
and Mr. Penfield takes the Zealandia.
The order to move the Marion into the
stream is being held in abeyance. Yester
day the officers of the Naval Reserve pre
sented such a strong case to the Harbor
Commissioners that Assistant Chief
Wharfinger Scott was Instructed not it)
make any move In the matter until fur
ther notice. Should the training ship be
moved away from Howard-street wharf
It would be a great setback to the battal
ion as it would be impossible to. drill the
men until the vessel was docked again.
At the Liquor dealers' masquerade
ball on Saturday night the following
committees will have charge: Recep
tion, Charles Kapp and James Kilday;
floor directors, Rudy Flschbeck, Fred
Maillot and T. R. Glynn; arrangements,
J. B. Garland, James Twomey, Henry
Peard and E. A. Fischer. >
Sacred Heart Fair.
The present week of the Sacred Heart
Fair is proving as successful as the pre
ceeding weeks. The clamor of the ticket
seller and the spell of the wheel-of-for
tune man has not abated. The excitement
incidental to the contest for the most
popular clergyman is still at fever heat,
with Father Cullen at the top of the list.
The contest for the most popular mar
ried man is a heated one, and the genial
Mark Meherin stands in a fair position
of getting the trophy. On Friday even-
Ing the First Regiment. League of the
Cross, under Colonel William P. Sullivan,
will visit the fair, and the charming
ladies are preparing to make that even
ing the banner night of the fair.

"W. R. Hearst, proprietor of the San

from the East. The object of his visit Is
the inspection of his interests on this
coast. He has given but little direct at
tention to them since entering his new
field in New York.

attended and all spent a most enjoyable
evening.

which seemed like a rock. Everything that I
ate gave me great pain; I had a bearing down â¢

ridge around my right side and in a short time
I was bloated. I was treated by three of our best
physicians but got no relief. I was Â»o weak I
could not walk across the room without assis-

I began to improve very fast after the nse ofa

cure is permaÂ»:nt." .
