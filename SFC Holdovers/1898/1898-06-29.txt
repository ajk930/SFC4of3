GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEADQUARTERS, Juragua, June
27, by Call-Herald dispatch-boat Mindora to Kingston, Jamaica,
June, 28.â 1t will not be surprising if General Kent's men, who are
now encamped near it, take possession of Morro Castle within a
short time. The defenses on the opposite side of the bay have
already been rendered useless to the Spaniards, and the capture
of Morro would give Admiral Sampson an opportunity to free the
harbor of mines without undergoing a heavy fire from the enemy.
The presence of our troops in this important position ex
plains why Morro has been spared bombardment by the fleet,
although it was known Lieutenant Hobson and his men were re
moved from the castle into the city. Admiral Sampson again
instructed his men to be careful about firing in that vicinity, so
that our army might not suffer by mistake, his new orders on this
point being due to a project to have a division of General Shafter's
men take possession of the Morro.

KINGSTON, June 28.â 1t developed
to-day that General Linares, who
placed the ambuscade Into which the
Rough. Riders fell on Friday, person
ally led the Spanish attack. This in
formation was conveyed to General
Shafter by a Spanish deserter from
Santiago, who surrendered to Shafter
at Sevllla on Monday.- He said 200
Bpaniarda wore killed In the battle with
the Rough Riders and eighty wounded.
The bodies of 105 Spanish soldiers and
all the \vunded were brought Into San
tiago on Saturday.
The deserter told the American gen
eral the Spaniards wore greatly sur
prised because the Americans did not
run at thr first fire.
AT THE FRONT, on the Rio Guama,
June 27 (per Associated Press dispatch
boat Wanda,. via Port Antonio, Jamai
ca, via. Kingston, Jamaica, June 28). â
Much information has been obtained
from Spanish parificos, who have
Slipped out of Santiago and given
themselves up in the hope of obtaining
food. They report starvation and dis
tress in Santiago. They say the Span
ish troops are on short rations and all
the supplies are being held for their
use.
The pacificos report that seventy
seven Spaniards were killed and eighty
nine wounded as the result of the en
gagement on Friday last with Colonel
Wood's and Colonel Young's com
mands.
The most startling Information ob
tained from the pacificos is that since
the advance began almost 20,000 Span
ish soldiers have arrived at Santiago

General Wheeler, who made a recon

was unable to secure the desired view
through the luxuriant tropical foliage,
dismounted and climbed a tree. A
major general of the United States
army In the forks of a tree, surveying
the Spanish outposts through his field
glasses, was a spectacle that gave Borne
idea of the wonderful energy of the
dashing ex-Confederate cavalry leader.
This feat of agility in a man 62 years of
age put to the blush many younger
officers of his own staff.
SAYS YON DIEDRICHS
IS TO INTERVENE
Semi-Offlcial Note at Berlin as to the
Course of Action in the
Philippines.
LONDON, June 29.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Daily News says:
The following semi-ofiicial note has
lippn published here, apparently with
the object of preparing* the world for
the landing of German marines at
Manila:
"As yet no statement has reached
here about the landing of German
marines at Manila, but it is a matter
of course that Admiral yon Diedrichs
wili intervene as soon as it may become
necessary for the protection of Ger
mans there. Such a measure would
have no political sisrniflcance whatever.
Neither at Washington nor Madrid
have negotiations occurred on this
matter."
The assurance that a landing of
marines would have no political signifi
cance is very nice. The only question
is whether the United States or the
other powers will see in the language
an act of interference, compelling them
to follow suit.

San Diego on Wednesday last, began her
work of guarding the submarine mines
off Ballast Point. Her officers are hav

All day long a sharp lookout Is kept up,
and vessels are continually warned

Several vessels have been fired upon by
the batteries on shore under the command
of Captain Humphreys of the Eighteenth
Artillery <md the vessels overhauled and
seized by the C'orwin's steam launch.
To-day a Chinese junk persisted in cut
ting oft corners on her way to the city,
mm in so doing sailed directly over tho
mine fields. A shot was fired across her
Low from the gun on the bluff, and upon
failing to heed the warning a second snot

stern. The stranger at once squared
away before the wind and beat a hasty
retreat to sea, with the Corwin's steam

FORCED TO
RETREAT TO
MANZANILLO
No Longer Danger That
Re-enforcements Will
Reach Santiago.
Special Cable to The Call and tbe New York Herald. Copyrighted, ISO?
by James Gordon Bennett.
ARMY HEADQUARTERS, JURAGUA, June 27, . by
Call-Herald Dispatch-boat Golden Rod to Kingston, Jamaica,
June 28. â Information has been received here from Manzanillo
to the effect that five battalions of Spanish troops, which. left
that city several days ago to re-enforce General Linares, re
turned to Manzanillo two days after their departure.
This is by far the most important news received to-day. It
is regarded as indicating the failure of the Spanish attempt un
der the command of General Pando to rush 10,000 trained
troops to the defense of Santiago.
General Pando, as has been told in former dispatches, be
gan a desperate effort to get his troops to Santiago as soon as
it was known the Americans would land and begin the invasion
of Cuba in that vicinity. He commands the most . important
body of Spanish troops, aside from General Linares' forces, in
Eastern Cuba. He was ordered by Captain General Blanco to
proceed with all possible haste toward Santiago, and the Span
iards based their only hope of repelling the invasion on the
prompt arrival of Pando's forces about Santiago.
General Garcia had not at his command a force strong
enough to face Pando's 10,000 troops, but he felt confident the
Cubans could hold the Spanish re-enforcements in check until
General Shafter could send troops to aid in driving them back
from the beleaguered city.
General Garcia's scouts, although they apparently dis
played unceasing vigilance, were unable to get news of Pando's
movements. As day after day passed the Cuban general be
came more uneasy and General Shafter was much perplexed as
to Pando's whereabouts.
The information received to-day from Manzanillo has set at
rest the fears of both the American and Cuban commanders.
They believe Pando's men either were unequal to the difficult
march from Manzanillo to Santiago, or else General Linares, re
alizing his hopeless position, sent word it was useless to send
these additional troops to thau point. If General Pando suc
ceeded in forming a junction with General Linares, it would be
of temporary benefit. General Shatter, having obtained a de
sirable landing place and established permanent headquarters
within commanding distance of Santiago, the fall of the city
would be but a question of time. Additional American troops
would be rushed to Santiago and when the Spaniards were de
feated it would mean the surrender of that many more Spanish
troops.
started out, but remained under protection of the forts."
In defeating the Terror Captain Sigsbee has rendered a
most important service to our navy, and, indeed, to all navies.
He has not only deprived Sampson's fleet of an apprehension of
an attack in the rear some dark night by this vicious little boat,
but he has demonstrated that an auxiliary cruiser is amply able
to take care of herself against a torpedo gunboat, showing that '
the offensive power of this craft has been very much overrated.
The other Spanish cruiser referred to by Captain Sigsbee
in his report as joining in the attack upon the St. Paul is sup
posed here to be the Alfonso XIII, an iron bark-rigged
cruiser built in 1887, of .300,0 tons. J

GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS, Juragua, June 27 (by The
Call-Herald dispatch boat Mindora to
Kingston, Jamaica, June 28). â Marked
success has attended the work of the
American army in transporting its
siege and field puns from the landing
place near Baiquiri to the heights over
looking the city of Santiago. Unless
the Spaniards are able to offer more
resistance than they have attempted
since they evacuated Sevilla on Satur
day night the invading army will be
Beady i<< attack Santiago within forty
eight hours. Much depends upon the
information Major General Shafter will
receive from General Wheeler, General
J.i-vtnn, Colonel Wood and Lieutenant
'Colonel Roosevelt to-night and to-mor
row.
General Shafter debarked from the
Saguranca this morning and proceeded
at once to this point, where he is in
close communication with the com
manders of the advance divisions of the
army. General Bates met him and they
conferred for a few minutes about the
landing of supplies.
General Shiifier, who was in full uni
form and wore a straw helmet, found,
after much difficulty, a magnificent
hur.-e for use in the campaign. After
attending to some minor matters at
headquarters he mounted and began a
tour of inspection of the American and
the Cuban forces. From Juragua the
American commander rode several
miles toward Santiago, passing on his
way the camps of General Garcia and
General Castillo, if,- visited before his
return General Wheeler and other di
vision commanders, and made observa
tions of Santiago from the heights.
General Shafter learned from the
Cuban generals the exact points at
which their 4000 men are encamped.
General Garcia, because of his knowl
edge of the country, was able to point
out several decided advantages that
had accrued â¦-< the invading army
through General Linares' course in
abandoning. Sevilla without resistance.
He had learned from his scouts many
details of the Spanish plan for the de
fense of Santiago and he gave this lat
est information to General Shafter.
General Kent's division to-day took
a position on the extreme flank of the
army, near Morro Castle, and it is like
ly that this advance caused the rumor
that the assault on the city had begun.
General Kent's men now are encamped
along the railroad, the American flag
being visible for miles from both land
and sea.
As I have fndicated in previous dis
patches, the hour of attack will depend
entirely upon when' the heavy artillery
is put into position before the city.
The three generals have finally agreed
upon the points at which the Cubans
phall attack and I am able to add that
all look for the early capture of the
city.
General Shafter and General Garcia
realize, however, that the enemy is
prepared to make a desperate resist
anc, but are confident the superior
number and courage of their troops
will insure complete victory.
. Neither General Shafter nor General
Garcia, it is understood here, place
much credence in the report that Gen
eral Linares has divided forces so as
to attack our army from the rear
when the Americans advance against
the city.
General Garcia maintains that the
Spanish commander has not a force
large enough to warrant him adopting
Fuch a course. He bases his opinion
upon reports brought by his most re
liable scouts. All information at hand
Indicates that General Linaiv-s will
hold his entire force at Santiago. He
may conclude to have General Pando
attempt an attack on our rear when
the fighting begins, but even this is
doubtful. In fact, the chances are ten
to one General Pando will be unable to
get his forces in the vicinity before the
Americans attack Santiago. One of
General Shafter's reasons for rushing
preparations for the attack is to pre
vent the possibility of such action on
the part of General Pando.
General Shafter was accompanied
into camp to-day by Colonel John Ja
cob Astor, Captain Stewart M. Brice,
Lieutenant Xoblo, Lieutenant Miley
and other members of his staff.
Complaints are heard that there are
too many Cubans co-operating with
General Shafter's army in this cam
paign. The Cubans, it is alleged, are
eating everything in sight and leaving
little for our troops.
CHEERING NEWS FROM
GENERAL SHAFTER
His Army Making Splendid Progress
and Re-enforcements Have
Arrived.
WASHINGTON. .Tune 28.â The War
Department late this afternoon posted
the following:
KAIQUIRI, June 27. via Playa del Butfa,
June 28.â Secretary nf War: The Vale ar
liveil this morning all rigbt Troops now
disembarking. Your sen. who has been at
the front aa a volunteer, assigned to duty
on the staff of General uuffleld.
BHAFTER. Major General.
OFF 1 SIBONEY. June 27. 9 p. m.. via
Playa del Este.â Adjutant General, Wash
ington: All is proflrresslnK wen. We oc
cupied to-day an advanced position aban
doned by the enemy yesterday on the Se
vllla and Santiago road, west of San Juan
River, within three mile* of Santiago and
from which it can be plainly scon.
SI i AFTER,
Major General Commanding.
It was very late in the day when the
first dispatch within two days came to
the War Department from General
Shafter, but the news was regarded as
so good That there was no disposition
to complain. It disclosed a very satis
factory rate of progress on the part of
General Shafter toward the town of
Santiago itself, and, apparently he has
gained all the ground and has come I
within three miles of Santiago without I
Buffering any losses since the skirmish
of Friday lajjt. Altogether the per-]
formance is regarded as very gratifying
to the department here.
As near as can be gathered from the
brief dispatch, the American army is
now at the fork of the road, one branch
of which leads to Santiago and the
other to Morro Castle, at the entrance
to the harbor. General Shafter is thus
free to move in either direction, accord
ing to the demands of the campaign.
With the 1300 men who reinforced him
yesterday on the Yale and the addi
tional brigade that will reach him by
to-morrow, it may be possible to make
even more rapid progress in the ad
vance upon Santiago, as the new men
can be relied upon to relieve the main
body of troops from the necessity of
keeping open the line of communica
tion between Shafter and his base at
Baiquiri.
Meanwhile, further reinforcements
are being prepared and dispatched as
rapidly as the best energies of the de
partment can direct, and it is believed
several thousand meu sailed from
Tampa directly for Santiago to-day.
The department has had in mind the
difficulties of the campaign that are
just developing to the public eye. such
as the use for the first time in civilized
â warfare of barbed wire fencing as a
means of defense, and, acting upon the
advice of some of our army officers who
were in Cuba while the fighting was
confined to the Spaniards and insur
gents, a certain number of men in each
regiment have been provided with wire
cutters and charged with the duty of
cutting down these fences so as to per
mit the advance of the troops. It prob
ably will be necessary to shell out the
force defending these wire chevaux de
frise before they can be cut, unless the
men in charge of that duty are to be
unduly exposed to danger. This will
involve a larger use of field artillery
than would be required in ordinary
warfare.
The lines are being tightened around
Cuba, and it will soon be impossible for
even small quantities of food or. war
supplies to reach the Spanish there.
The proclamation issued to-day, ex
tending the blockade to the south coast
and to San Juan, it is believed will ac
complish this result. On the south
coast the Isle of Pines will be cut off as
a transfer depot for cattle and food
supplies pnmi-- from Jamaica and
Central America. By closing San Juan
harbor the Spaniards will lose the last
chance of smuggling war supplies to
Cuba and the future operations of the
army and navy looking to the occupa
tion of the island of Porto Rico will be
materially advanced by the establish
ment of a successful blockade.

MANILA, June 23 (via Hongkong
June 2S).â lt seems probable the situa
tion in the Philippines is about to be
come complicated, and it is much to be
regretted the American Government
did not hurry forward 1600 men to en
able Admiral Dewey to hold Manila
and plant the American flag firmly on
the citadel. Possession is nine points
in the law, and Interference which
would have been almost impossible
were the American flag flying over Ma
nila becomes comparatively easy while
the city is still under Spanish rule.
We are threatened with various com
plications.
First, the rebels, influenced by for
eign Consuls or inflated by their sur
prising success under arms, have
changed their tone and now want com
plete independence. Aguinaldo already
has issued a circular saying it is prob
able he will invite the European pow
ers to recognize and guarantee the
complete independence of the Philip
pines. This leader in his complete ig
norance of diplomacy and how to deal
with European diplomats will soon in
volve himself inextricably in complica
tions, the lirst of which will be a rup
ture with his American protectors,
which is what Germany is aiming to
secure. Should European nations in
terfere in the Philippines so much jeal
ousy would ensue it would be hopeless
for them to try to arrive at a satisfac
tory result, and the only way of
escape would be by means of a general
war or a return of the islands to Snain.
In that case Spain would require inter
national help to restore order.

If Aguinaldo is idiotic enough to de

| There can be only one or two results
of this policyâ either the Philippines

In the latter case God help the Phil

During the recent rebellion Aguinaldo
found it no easy matter to maintain

whole island is in a ferment, can sup

NINE THOUSAND MEN
TO JOIN THE INVADERS
Orders for Another Expedition to
Santiago, Including Six Bat
teries of Artillery.
WASHINGTON, June 28.â Orders
have been issued for the departure of
another large army expedition from
Tampa, composed of about 9000 men of
the Second Division of the Fourth Army-
Corps, under command of Brigadier
General Snyder, and six batteries of ar
tillery, three light and three heavy.
Twelve transports are to carry the
expedition. They will move first to
Key West, at which point a strong na
val convoy will meet them and escort
the expedition fÂ«i Santiago. The con
voy will probably include one battle
ship and several cruisers and auxiliary
cruisers.
General Snyder's second division of
the Fourth Army Corps is now at Tam
pa and is made up of three brigades
and nine regiments. The batteries will
be designated by General Randolph, in
command of the artillery at Tampa.

MORE TROOPS
FOR MERRITT
Twenty-One Thousand
Men All Told.
THE FIRST NEW YORK COMING
ORGANIZING THE LAST TWO EX
PEDITIONS.
Washington Officials Hope to See the
Final Fleet on Its Way to
Manila by the First of
August.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 28.â The un
derstanding at the War Department is
that the total number of regulars anl
volunteers which will be dispatched to
Manila in command of Major General
Merritt will approximate 21,000 men. Ot
these 10,000 already have left San Fran
cisco in three separate expeditions.
With the troops now at San Francisco
and those on their way to that city the
remainder of the Eighth Corps Asilt. be
made up.
The Wyoming Battery of Light Ar
tillery arrived at San Francisco to
day, while the First Regiment of
New York Volunteers yesterday re
ceived the order to proceed to San
Francisco for duty with the Philippine
expedition. This regiment has b^en
quartered in several of the forts around
New York harbor, and is commanded
by Colonel Thomas M. Barber. The
First will form an important addition
to General Merritt's corps, as the ex
pectation is that it will be recruited to
its full maximum strength of 1326 men
before starting on its long trip to the
coast.
The fourth expedition to the Philip
pines is scheduled to start somewhere
between the 6th and 10th of July, and
arrangements for it are making at
Washington and at San Francisco. The
fifth and probably the last of the series
of expeditions the officials now hope
to see launched on its way by the Ist
of August. The expectation being that
some of the transports used in the
Giants are those who are full of power. Power is another name
for manliness. Ail men are given power when they are bom. But many
men abuse nature's grandest and most valuable gifts. Have you been
guilty? If you have "Hudyan" will make up for your folly. "Hudyan"
restores to men who have been gluttonous a new digestion. To men
who have been wasting away it brings fresh vitality. To men who are
weak it brings grand maniy strength. It has done that, and never failed
to do it with an array of 21,000 patients. Circulars and testimonials
about it are sent to all who will ask for them. Medical advice on all
subjects is sent free. Will you have it? Why should you not be a phys-
ical giant, even if you are not one in stature? You can be, if you will
but try. Ask about "Hudyan." No cost to you.
HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, Stockton, Market and Ellis Sts., San F-acisco
first expedition will have returned from
Manila before that time and be ready
to start again across the Pacific with
American troops aboard.

WATSON
Flying Squadron to Be
Made Ready With
out Delay.
It Will Go to the Spanish
Coast Whether Camara
Returns or Not.
WASHINGTON, June 2S.â There was
no further word from the Cadiz fleet
to-day, though it is still known to be
lying at Port Said, under pretext of
repairing one of the torpedo boat de-
Btroyers.
The delay on the part of the Spanish
fleet has not stopped the preparations
for the sending of the Eastern squad
ron, under command of Comodore Wat
eon, to the Spanish shores. The com
modore Is hastening with all speed
southward on the Newark to' join and
confer with Sampson off Santiago.
It is stated at the department that it
Is the present Intention to start Com
modore Watson's Euporean squadron
from Santiago. This, however, is sub
ject to Admiral Sampson's report upon
the condition of the vessels selected
and their need? in the matter of sup
plies and equipment for the long voyage
ahead of them. if they need no more
that can be supplied from Sampson's
fleet, they will start, according to or
ders, from Santiago, but if further sup
pliefl are needed, >>r if the vessels must
be cleaned first, then thoy will prob
ably be sent north to Hampton Roads.
Meanwhile there is no mistaking the
earnestness of the Navy Department in
preparing this squadron for European
8.-rvioe.
All the members of the Cabinet were
present at to-day's meeting with the
exception of Secretary Day, who is out
of the city. At its conclusion it was
stated that the work of supplying Com
modore Watson's squadron with am
munition, cal and provisions, prepara
tory to its departure for Spain, was
progressing satisfactorily, and that in
all probability the squadron would be
ready to sail in the course of the next
i four or five days.
The impression which seems to pre-
Vail In some quarters that the sending <
of this fl< it to Spain is Intended solely j
to prevent Admiral Camara from going i
to the Philippines Is erroneous. There
1b no question that this move has been
under consideration for some time, and
it is the intention of the Government to
send the vessels to Spain's home waters
whether Camara's fleet proceeds to the
Philippines or not. If it returns and
comes within striking distance of Com
re Watson's powerful squadron it
Is confidently expected by the President
and the members of the Cabinet that it
â will be crushed, which would utterly
destroy Spain's power on the sea.
Should it continue its course to Manila
Admiral Dewey's squadron is regarded
as abundantly able to maintain the
honors it won mi May 1.
The arrival at Manila of the trans
ports with troops from San Francisco
has not yet been reported, nor Is the
news expected for some days The dis
patch boat which left Manila just be
fore the exj ected arrival of the trans
ports will have to return to Manila and
ANNEXATION
IS DOOMED
Senate Will Adjourn
Without Action.
AGREEMENT REACHED
EXHAUSTIVE SPEECHES BY THE
OPPOSITION.
Representative Newlands' Resolution
Will Not Come to a Vot9
During the Present
Session.
Special Dlnpatch to The Call.
Call Office, mggs House,
Washington, June 28.
No agreement has been reached be
tween annexationist Senators and the op
position, and, according. to Senator White,
none is likely to be reached. Twelve or
fifteen Senators have signified their in
tention to address the Senate on this sub
ject, and as these speeches will be ex
haustive there is no telling when the
Senate will be ready to adjourn unless the
Initiative is taken by the other side.
The Evening Star, the Hawaiian Sugar
Company organ, is trying its best to
bolster up the annexationists and induce
them to remain in session, but the ex
tremely hot weather is having a most
demoralizing effect.
It Is freely predicted here that Congress
will adjourn without having passed the
Newlands resolution.
CAFFERY DEFENDS THE
COURSE OF CLEVELAND
Says He Was Right in Causing the
American Flag to Be Hauled
Down in Hawaii.
WASHINGTON, June 28.â Almost the
entire session of the Senate to-day was
occupied by Mr. CafTery of Louisiana in
a continuance of his speech against the
annexation of Hawaii. At 4 o'clock he
had not concluded, but yielded the floor
In order that the general deficiency bill
might be coneldered. The bill was read

thing later can be known.
SPANISH GOVERNMENT
IN DOUBTING MOOD
Does Not Credit the Report That an
American Squadron Is to Cross
the Atlantic.
MADRID. June 28.â The Spanish offi
cials here assert that there will be no
difficulty in Admiral Camara traversing
the Suez Canal, as the accompanying
transports, they add, have all the coal
the squadron requires. It is believed
here that the Spanish ships will enter
the canal to-day.
The Spanish Government does not
credit the report that an American
squadron is to visit Spanish waters,
but the Ministers say they have taken
all possible precautions, that the ports
are all ready, and that 26.000 men who
have been called out will be distributed
among the principal Atlantic and
Mediterranean ports.
CHANGE IN PUBLIC
OPINION IN EUROPE
Recognizes Americans Are Entitled
to Make War in Any Way They
May Sse Fit.
LONDON, June 28.â The St. James
Gazette this afternoon, commenting
on the prospect of the American forces
attacking the coast of Spain, says:
"The reception of the news evidenced
a change in public opinion, which at the
commencement of the war thought
Europe should notify the United States
that the war must be conflnc'l to
American waters. It is now recognized
that the Americans are fully entitled to
make war in their own way, and they
are, indeed, driven to retaliate upon
Spain In this manner, owing to the tac
tics which Spain has chosen to pursue."
CAMARA'S SQUADRON IN
SLOVENLY CONDITION
Will Be Compelled to Remain at Port
Said for at Least a
Week.
LONDON, June 29.â A dispatch to the
Daily Chronicle from Port Said says
| Admiral Camara's squadron is in a
moat slovenly condition, the bottoms of
most of his ships are foul and the re
pairing of the machinery of the tor
pedo-boat destroyer Audaz would take
lat least a week. The Isla de Panay,

hibited, pending a decision by the

as they have been offered, were agreed
to. Consideration of the bill will be re
sumed to-morrow morning.
When the annexation resolution was j
taken up Mr. Caffery extolled President !
Cleveland's course in ordering the Amer- !
lean flag taken down. While discuss
ing what he deemed the wrong done to <
the constituted authority during the Ha
waiian rebellion of L 893, Mr. Caffery de- !
clared it was a bitter and rancorous
spirit which directed the attack made
upon President Cleveland, for the bold, i
patriotic and righteous stand taken by j
Mr. Cleveland in attempting to right the
wrong done by Minister Stevens and the !
band of Hawaiian revolutionists. Con- i
cerning the formation of tin- de facto gov- |
eminent of Hawaii, Mr. Caffery declared
there was never anything like it in the :
history of nations. Some man, he said, 'â 
read a proclamation. When he began ;
to read twenty-five or thirty people were :
l â¢:â¢â¢ Bent and by the time he had concluded
perhaps 300 had gathered. A govern- ]
mont was never made so easily, said he, :
nor elevated so quickly.
"Within half an hour." said Mr. Caf- |
fery, "Minister Stevens had acknowledged '
that the revolutionists had overthrown the !
regularly constituted Government. The Ha- !
waiian Government had under its author- I
ity several islands, some of them fifty
milÂ«s apart. It was impossible for Min
ister Stevens to know that the revolu- !
tion had been BUCCessfuL International !
law requires that a de facto government
Hha.l be strong enough to maintain itself
with the consent of the people, but with
in ten hours after th<- revolutionary gov- |
ornmont had boon created it demanded i
the protection of the I'nited States."
Mr. Caffery maintained that it was !
merely a paper Government and never I
had amounted to much. He declared that I
within three days after the aoknowledg- j
ment by the United States Minister that
the new Government had been formed
members of the Government were on board
a steamer en route to this country with a
treaty of annexation in their pockt-t
"The ultimate purposes of the revolu
tionists from the start," said Mr. Caffery
"was annexation to the United States."
He said all the conspirators were sugar
men. and the tariff law then in operation j
in the United States was Inimical to their
interests. He added that a good deal had
been said recently about the Interest of
the beet-sugar trust in the pending ques
tion of annexation. The statements were
illufiloiiary and misleading and Intended I
to be such.
Â lr > tne course of my remarks," said
Mr. Cnffery, "I will attempt to show
hereafter that the interests of the Ameri
can Sugar Refining Company are not bet
ter subserved by having Hawaii as it is
than by having Hawaii annexed. The
Interests of the sugar trust are not bet
ter subserved by Hawaii being indepen
dent and free than by Hawaii being a
part of the United States, and the news
papers that are crying 'Wolf, wolf,' are
trying to cover their own tracks."

6p*clol Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU Alaska, June 25 (via Vic
toria., B. C, Jum 2S, by ste_.nship City
of Seattle). â J. M. Thompkins, who says
he has fur fourteen years been a grain
buyer for Phii Armour of L.ueago,
stepped off a boat here to-day, having
just come from Fort Selkirk, at the
mouth of the Felly River, and Dawson.
He stated that Mr. Armour is not in
terested in K.undike mines.
Mr. Thompkins' mission "inside" is
apparently ol more importance than he
has made public. However, he brings
out some news of the greatest interest
in view of the thousands of men who
have gone Into the Yukon basin by the
Lynn Canal trails, the thousands more
who are expecting to go up the Yukon
River in stern-wheel steamboats and
also in consideration of the vast sums
of money that have been invested in
the construction of light draught stern
wheelers to carry the expected crowds.
Mr. Thompkins' opinion is that these
I!"(.ks of steamboats will nÂ«ver get up
the river this year, and that t'.e money
used to build them will return about as
much dividend as the dollars put into
the erection of three-story hotels at the
head of Lynn Canal, which are now
V ;.< ant.
He said: "Not in five years has
there been so light a snowfall in the in
terior of Alaska as last winter. Moun
tain peaks which are usually covered
with snow are bare. Melted snow and
ice make the greater volume of the
water of the Yukon River, and this
year the Yukon is lower than it has
been in a long time. It is very low
now, and the amount of snow will not
produce water enough to raise it more
than a few inches at most. Bars and
points Jutting from the shore at the
bends of the river are far out of water.
At the present stage of the water none
of the boats at St. Michael can come up
the rivor. They would never get over
the flats. If they got that far they
would stay where the Hamilton stuck
last fall. The exceptionally mild win
ter accounts for the light snowfall.
Where Is the water coming from to
raise the river? The snow is not there
to make it."
"What do they think at Dawson
about this?"
"They are very doubtful that the
boats will ever arrive there. Prospect
ors who have been in the Yukon Basin
for years say they have never seen the
river so low at this time of year, and
so little snow. There is a good deal of
uneasiness on this account in Dawson
and up in the mining camps. If the
boats do not succeed in making at least
one round trip, my opinion is that the
Government relief expedition which
turned into a burlesque last winter will
become a stern necessity next winter.
Yes, I know that the men going in are
taking grub with them, but I'll just be
prophet enough to ask you to remem
ber what I have said when next Feb
ruary comes."
Mr. Thompkins Is the first man to
come out of the wilderness and say
that there is disappointment among
claim holders generally in regard to the
clean up. He says the amount is much
less than was anticipated. and
while some hope it may reach $20,000,
000, Mr. Thompkins says he and a
good many others will be surprised if
the total clean up exceeds J0, 000,000.
The pay streak narrowed or ran out
entirely in many claims. There is not
a man in the Klondike region who
owns a claim that does not want to
sell.
"Will the gold come out by the up
river route or be sent down to St.
Michael?" he was asked.
"Most of it will be brought up the
river by its owners and they will be
coming all summer lone and till late
in the fall," said Mr. Thompkins.
"There is a feeling of distrust about
the boats being able to get back down
the river even if they succeed In mak
ing Pawson, owing to the low water.
Men who have made a rich strike do
not fancy being stuck on the river in
the midst of a wilderness all winter
long with a load of gold. A few may
risk of getting out by way of St. Mich
ael, but nine men out of ten who have
got anythir- out of the clean up will
give it a personal escort up the *river
themselves, for by th<Â» up-river route
thov know they can get out, though it
will take a little longer. There will be
small steamboats on the river this
summer and along in the fall till navi
gntion closes from Pawson to Lake 1
Bennett, nortr>"-in<r the rapids.

SENTIMENT OF
MADRID TENDS
TOWARD PEACE
Bishop of BarceloQd Advises Tfyat
Spain Treat Directly With
t\)e UQited States.
Special Cable to The Call and the Hew York "Herald. Copyrighted, 180S,
by Jainen Gordon Dennett.
MADRID, June 28.â Political debating centers, which abound in i
Madrid, were particularly animated to-day. The general opinion, fol- i
lowing the Archbishop of Barcelona, was that the time had come to ]
treat for peace and directly with the United States, not through a j
third power. <
The Archbishop of Barcelona says Spain should ask the United i
States upon what terms it would make peace, and unless I am misin- :
formed such is the opinion of the Spanish people, and it is this matter :
to decide which a Cabinet council is sitting as I write. It was sum- i
moned in consequence of the American proposals to send a fleet over :
here. Its reply is to call out 26,00) extra men to re-enforce the gar- ;
risons in the seaboard towns and place all forts in a position to meet
any emergency. <
The persistent rumor that the Government has ordered Admiral
Cervera to sally from Santiago is officially denied. The admiral, with
out doubt, has been sounded upon the poiiit, but after a consultation
with his captains and after much deliberation it was resolved that,
much as the question of a sortie was popular with naval n.on.
It would be contrary to strict orders of tlie Government, which fere
to take the least possible risk with his ships.
both ways, or a man may pull up the
Yukon in a small boat to Fort Selkirk
and there strike the Dalton trail and
come overland to Pyramid Harbor, or
go on up the Lewis River to Five
Finger Rapids and hit the same trail
there. Consequently most of the Klon
dike gold will first come to tidewater
at Skaguay, Dyea and Juneau. Thous
ands of men are goir" into the Yukon
country who have nothing but the bit
terest disappointment ahead of them
as sure as fate."
Mr. Thompkins has no mine on any
of the celebrated creeks or gulches. He
has placer diggi. rs on Selwin Creek,
near Fort Selkirk, which produced $2600
above expenses up to the time of the
clean-up, and also Borne claims on
Seventy Mile, which run $10 per day
to the man and promise better. He left
Juneau to-day to look at a very rich
quartz claim location.
"I think," said he. "that these Klon
dikerf! are passing by hundreds of good
mines between here and British Colum
bia and they need not even leave Brit
ish Columbia to find them."
He win leave for Chicago next week.
He says the flotilla of boats going down
the Lewis River beats anything he ever
saw in his experienco and he is doubt
ful whether tho world ever before pro
duced such a sight. It is a continuous
fleet, nearly 600 miles long. The Cana
dian police have stopped the use of can
vas boats on the lakes and river as un
serviceable and dancerous.

OREGON HAS A
BIG SENSATION
Fou r Prom i nent Lawyers
Arrested.
THEFT OF BALLOTS CHARGED
MISSING COUNTY CLERK IMPLI-
CATED.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALEM, Or., June 23.â The biggest
legal sensation sprung in Oregon since
1876 developed this evening in the ar
rest of P. H. Darcy (Dem.), late fusion
candidate for Circuit Judge; his part
ner, S. T. Richardson; his brother, W.
J. Darcy, and John A. Carson, all
prominent attorneys and substantial
men, socially and financially. Richard
son is dean of the Willamette Univer
sity Law School.
The arrests were made on a charge of
forging public documents, in tamper
ing with ballot boxes in the County
Clerk's office, and changing the ballots
and returns for the purpose of electing
P. H. Darcy as Judge, there being a
close contest between him and R. P.
Boise, P.ipulist fellow-candidate on the
fusion ticket. There were two Judges
to be elected in this district, comprising
five counties. One, the Republican,
had a clear majority, and for sec
ond place Boise and Darcy ran so close
as to make the result doubtful.
The arrests this evening at 8 o'clock
caused an immense sensation, and pub
lic interest is at fever heat. The ac
cused demanded an immediate hearing,
and the preliminary hearing progressed
as fast as possible to-night. County
Clerk Ehlen is also implicated, but he
left here hurriedly on the morning of
June 20 and htis not been seen since,
nor is his whereabouts known.
The principal witness against the ac
cused is J. W. Roberts, night watch
man at the Courthouse, who testified
that on Saturday evening, June 11,
Clerk Ehlen and Lawyers Carson and
Richardson came into the Courthouse
at 10:30 and went to the room where
the ballot boxes of the various pre
cincts of the county were stored; that
soon after Carson came down stairs
and invited the watchman to take a lit
tle walk, which he did, going to a
restaurant two blocks away, where
they sat down to supper.
The -watchman suddenly thought
that something was wrong, and he
hastily, excused himself and returned
to the Courthouse, where he saw Clerk
Ehlen going toward Darcy & Rich
ardson's office with a bundle under his
arm. After reaching the Courthouse
the watchman saw Richardson coming
out of the room where the ballot boxes
were, lock the floor and go away. The
watchman later went into the room
and found three ballot boxes open and
the ballot spread out on the table. He
saw a light in Darcy & Richardson's
otnee, which is in sight of the Court
house, until 1 o'clock in the morning,
and about that hour saw P. H. Darcy
going home from there. Two days
later he met Darcy. .and In conversa
tion the latter said to him: "Keep
your own counsel."
After cross examination the case was
adjourned till morning.

for a long time a chronic sufferer from dyspepsia. She
used to make use of a mixture prepared by the druggist
where the family traded, but one time when the supply
was exhausted and she was absent from home and had
not a copy of the prescription with her, she was- at a loss
to know what to do and I recommended her to make

STREETS OF SAN JOSE PACKED
SAN EAFAEL NEVER SAW SUCH
ENTHUSIASM.
Bousing Send-Off for Colonel Hen
shaw at Chicoâ Two Companies
in Each of Which Ara
Three Brothers.
SAN JOSE, June 28.â A reign of pa
triotism seized the Garden City this
morning and business v.as cast aside
to do honor to Company B, Fifth Regi
ment, N. G. C, which departed for Oak
land to join the new regiment that is to
be offered as part of California's quota
to the second call for troops. The sub
jects of a kingdom never paid more
regal tribute to a ruler than did the
people of this city to the departing sol
dier boys. Company B had been wait
ing patiently to be called to do battle
for its country, and when a few days
ago the longed-for word, was received
there was great joy in the armory.
Enthusiasm and pride rapidly spread
among the citizens, and for the last
day or two nothing has been too good
for the militiamen.
Last evening the Dewey Club gave
the boys a farewell reception at the
armory, speech-making and light re
freshments being the features of the oc
casion. This morning the town was
awake earlier than usual to honor the
departing soldiers, and when the hour
of leaving came the streets were alive
with people. Flags were Hying and
many of the business houses were deco
rated and the whole town presented an
animated scene. Patriotism pervaded
the air and the boys were given a
royal send-off. The line of inarch was
thronged, and pretty girls in summer
Euits bade a loving farewell to the
town's prides.
For the past month preparations for
the occasion had been progressing un
der the auspices of Phil Sheridan Wo
man's Relief Corps, and it is to these
ladies and Grand Marshal T. F. Mor
rison that the success of the celebration
Is due. The executive committee of
Phil Sheridan Relief Corps in charge
of the matter was Mrs. Hugh McL
Porter, Mrs. Low Tripp and Mrs.
"vVarthen.
Company B was escorted to the depot
by the Grand Army Posts and the aux
iliary societies, the order of parade be
ing as follows: Fifth Regiment Band,
Phil Sheridan Post. G. A. R.; John A.
Dix Post, Phil Sheridan Woman's Re
lief Corps, John A. Dix Woman's Re
lief Corps, Ladies of the G. A. R. and
Sons and Daughters of Veterans. The
second division was headed by the
Marine Band, followed by city officials.
Red Cross Society, San Jose Hussars,
school children and Dewey Club, drum
corps and Knights Templar. Then
came Company B, surrounded by their
close friends.
At the depot the crowd was the
largest ever seen in the city. Here the
boys were cheered and another good-by
was paid. There were many tearful
eyes as the train pulled out amid the
blessings of the people.
Company B was presented with a
beautiful silk flag by the Red Cross
Society this morning before leaving.
The flag was a present from the Ma
sonic fraternity and the presentation
speech was made by Miss Lois Peck
ham.
The company is under command of
Captain H. L. Partridge. L. A. de Yoe
Is first lieutenant and F. S. Munn is
second lieutenant. Besides the full
company of 106 men about twenty-five
extra men were taken along to fill out
other companies of the brigade.
In â¢ the company are three Frost
brothers â Erwln E., George O. and
Arthur C. They are sons of Erwin
Frost, the well-known detective, and
are aged respectively 26, 24 and 21 years.
It Is believed there is not another com
pany in the State going to the front
with three brothers on its roll.
SAN RAFAEL, June 28.â Company D
Is off to the war. and many a mother's
heart is sorrowing In this city to-night.
Jt was an inspiring sight to see the
boys march from the armory to the
broad gauge depot to take the 9:20
train for Fruitvale this morning. The
route was lined with townspeople,
many having come In from the neigh
boring towns and stations to witness
the departure.
Flags were waved from housetops, on
the streets, in carriages and by riders
of wheels. At the depot, gaily decor
ated with bunting and flags, an im
mense crowd assembled to give the vol
unteers a parting salute, and it was
given with a will.
Many sympathetic eyes were turned
upon Mrs. Barrow, for she parted with
three sons, all strapping, stalwart fel
lowsâSergeant Joseph, Albert and Eu
gene.
At the depot George D. Shearer
mounted the platform of a car and an
nounced that throue-h the kindness of
A. W. Foster, president of the road, all
who wished might ride fr^e to Tiburon
and back. This was greeted with a
fresh outburst of applause and many
took advantage of the privilege. At
Tiburon the boys were joined by Com
pany E of Santa Rosa, which followed
them on to the steamer TTkiah. When
near the ferry slip at Han Francisco
the two companies lined up and gave
three hearty cheerÃ for President Fos
ter, three for the flag and three for Un
cle Sam.
Last evening a hall was given the
boys in the armory, and there It was
announced that over $650 had been con
tributor! by "citizens of the county to
purchase essentials for the company
not provided by the Government.
SANTA ROSA. June 28.â When Cap
tain C. E. Haven, at the head of his
company of volunteers, formerly Com
pany E, Fifth Regiment. N. G. C.
marched from the armory to the depot
this morning the band playing and the
crowd cheering it was through a dense
ly packed mass of humanity all the
way. Shortly after 6 o'clock people be

gan pouring In from the surrounding
country and by 7 o'clock the * streets
were crowded. The company marched
from the armory to the Court House,
where it was halted, decorated with
flowers and shown other attentions.
The march was then resumed to the
depot, whe*re the men embarked on the
7:40 train for Camp Barrett, Oakland.
Captain Haven has 146 men in his com
mand. When mustered in the extra
men will be available for other com
panies that happen to be short of ma
terial.
RED BLUFF, June 28.â Fifteen
young men of this city responded to a
call for volunteers to join Company A
of Chico and were examined and went
to Chico this morning to enlist.
They will serve with Colonel Park
Henshaw.
CHICO, June 28.â The people of Chico
and vicirrity never before witnessed
such a display of patriotism as was
seen in Chico to-night on the departure
of Colonel Henshaw and gallant Com
pany A. The ladies of the Red Cross
had prepared a benefit entertainment,
which was given this evening before an
audience of 2000 people. The most in
teresting part of the programme was
the presentation of a gold-mounted
saber and a pair of field glasses given
by the citizens of Chico to Colonel Hen
shaw. The people shouted until they
could shout no more and the cheering
was kept up until the boys boarded the
train for Camp Barrett.
AUGUSTI'S GLOOMY
MESSAGE TO MADRID
Position of Doomed Manila's Defend
ers Continues to Grow More
Desperate.
MADRID, June 28.â The Government
has received the following dispatch
from Captain General Augustl, dated
Manila, June 23:
"The situation is still as grave as
ever. I continue to maintain my posi
tion inside the line of blockhouses, but
the enemy is increasing in numbers, as
the rebels occupy the provinces, which
are surrendering. Torrential rains are
inundating the intrenchments, render
ing the work of defense difficult. The
numbers of sick among the troops are
increasing, making the situation very
distressing and causing increased de
sertions of the native soldiers.
"It Is estimated that the insurgents
number 30,000 armed with rifles and
10,000 armed with swords, etc.
"Aguinaldo has summoned me to sur
render, but I have treated his proposals
with disdain, for I am resolved to
maintain the sovereignty of Spain and
the honor of the tlag to the last ex
tremity.
"I have over 1000 sick and 200
wounded.-
"The citadel has been invaded by the
suburban inhabitants, who have aban
doned their homes, owing to the bar
barity of the rebels. These inhabitants
constitute an embarrassment, aggra
vating the situation, in view of the
bombardment, which, however, is not
seriously apprehended for the moment.
"The Governor of the Viscaya and
Mindano Islands cables that he has de
feated the insurgents in an engage
ment, during which Chief Arco, Agui
naldo's representative, was killed. He
adds that tranquillity now prevails
throughout these islands and he further
asserts that the principal Malay chiefs
of the Mindano group declare they de
sire to fight on the side of the Spaniards
against the invaders.
"According to our advices the emis
saries sent out to seek General Monet's
column of 1000 men returned after a
fruitless search.
"Captain General Augusti's family Is
still in the hands of the insurgents.
"General Pena, with 1000 soldiers, has
surrendered. His soldiers, most of
whom are natives, Joined the insur
gents. A majority of the detachments
in the Island of Luzon have surren
dered, owing to their lack of food,
though some succeeded in escaping.
"Numerous Spaniards, including the
Governors of Batanga, Laguna and
Bulacan, have taken refuge at Cavlte.
"The rebels who are besieging Manila
exceed 25,000 men. The city is com
pletely isolated and the arrival of the
Spanish squadron is anxiously awaited,
for the position of Manila is untenable.
"Small rebel craft navigate the bay,
conveying prisoners to Cavite."
AMBITIOUS PROJECT
OF THE LITTLE HIST
Auxiliary Cruiser Wants Permission
to Capture the Purissima
Concepcion.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Got
don Bennett.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 28.â The
auxiliary cruiser Hist left Port Anto
nio for Santiago this afternoon. Lieu
tenant Lucien Young, her commander,
came to Kingston to consult Consul
Bent about the Spanish steamer Puris
sima Concepcion, now supposed to be
in an inlet near Trinidad, Cuba. As a
result he started for the fleet with the
pilot who took the Purissima Concep
cion from Kingston.
If Admiral Sampson consents the
Hist may capture the Purissima Con
cepcion, although the converted yacht
draws more water than the Spanish
steamer. She wishes to take a prize and
is willing to run under the Spanish
guns and shell the fort she has to pass
if necessary to take the Purissima
Concepcion. The greatest difficulty Is
that the Hist is able to carry very lit
tle coalâ barely five days' supply at the
best â and cannot run more than thir
teen knots an hour under favorable
circumstances.
FOUR ALLEGED SPIES
PLACED UNDER ARREST
Believed to Have Been Obtaining
Information About Atlantic
Coast Fortifications.
ATLANTA, Ga., June 28.â Four sup
posed Spanish spies reached Fort Mr-
Pherson to-day. One of them is Private
J. Glenhurst of the Fourth Army Corps.
He is supposed to have entered the
army to enable him to carry on his se
cret operations without attracting sus
picion. He was arrested at Tampa,
and pending Investigation of the
charges against him was sent to Fort
MoPherson.
The other suspects are officially
known as Thoribio Negrin, a deserter
from the Spanish navy; Jose Martinez
and Juan Rodriguez, alias "Spanish
John." They are thought to have been
obtaining information about the forti
fications at Typee for the use of the
Spanish Government.
RUSSIAN NEWSPAPERS
CHANGING THEIR TONE
Growing Fear of an Anglo-American
Alliance Creates Respect for
This Country.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 28.â 1n
view of the continued improvement of
the military position of the United
States the newspapers here are chang
ing their tone to friendship for America
and now speak with contemptuous pity
of Spain, the reason being, it 1b alleged,
the growing fear of a possible Anglo-
American alliance. The Russian press,
however, does not think Buch an alli
ance is probable, and predicts that the
victory of the United States over Spain
will lead the former into a colonial
policy, which will eventually result In
a conflict with Great Britain.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JTOTE 29, 1898.
HARDER TASK
FOR THE SHIPS
Extension of the Cuban
Blockade.
PROCLAMATION BY M'KINLEY
SAN JUAN ALSO WILL BE
CUT OFF. ,
Formal Notice to the World That
Shipping Will Not Be Per
mitted to Enter Closed
Ports.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 28.â The Presi
dent has issued a proclamation extend
ing the blockade of Cuba to the south
ern coast, from Cape Frances to Cape
Cruz inclusive, and also blockading San
Juan de Porto Rico. The proclamation
is as follows:
I Whereas, For the reasons set forth in
my proclamation of April L"J, 1898, a block-
I ade of ports on the northern coast of Cu
| ba, from Cardenas to Uahia Honda mi
i elusive, and of the port of CienfuegOfl on
ihe south coast of Cuba, was declared to
have been Instituted; and, whereas, it has
been considered desirable to extend the
blockade to other southern ports; now,
Therefore, i, William McKiniey, Presi
dent of the United States, do hereby de
clare and proclaim that, in addition to the
blockade of the ports specified in my proc
lamation of April 22, Ib9B, the United
Stairs of America has instituted and will
maintain an effective blockade of all the
ports on the south coast of Cuba, from
Cape Frances to Cape Oruz inclusive, ana
also of the port of San Juan, in the Island
of Porto Kico.
Neutral vessels Iving in any of the ports
to which the blockade is by the present
proclamation extended, will be allowed
thirty days to issue therefrom with cargo.
In witness whereof, etc.
WILLIAM M'KINLEY,
President of the United States of America,
June 2\ 1898.
By the President:
J. B. MOORE,
Acting Secretary of State.
By the proclamation Issued to-day
the President cave notice of the inten
tion of the Government to assume the
formidable task of blockading about 500
miles of Cuban coast line in addition to
the section already blockaded, 'lhis in
creases the extent of the blockade fully
fourfold, it having been confined here
tofore to a stretch of a little more than
100 miles on the north and the single
port of Cienfuegos on the south coast
of the island.
The vessels for the additional block
ade service will be supplied entirely
from the patrol fleet, which, under
Commodore Howell, has been guarding
the North Atlantic coast from Maine to
South Carolina. This service has been
abandoned because the only available
Spanish warships are with Admiral Ca
mara, thousands of miles away from
the nearest point on the Atlantic coast.
The vessels are already on their way
southward, having been re-enforced by
several of the new torpedo-boats, which
are particularly adapted because of
their light draft for blockade duty in
the shallow waters lying -between the
Isle of Pines and Cuba.
The blockade of San Juan, proclaimed
to-day, is In reality already in effect,
having been initiated by Captain Sigs
bee last week, when he turned back
from that port a British steamer laden
with supplies. The difficulty of main
taining a blockade at this port, in the
face of the Spanish forts and three
Spanish war vessels in the harbor,
would be considerable had not Captain
Sigsbee, by disabling the Terror made
the task easier. As it is, the character
of the vessels required to maintain the
blockade at Sen Juan necessarily must
be of a type superior to the ships re
quired for the blockade on the south
ern coast of Cuba. Probably some of the
vessels as the Detroit or the Montgom
ery will be assigned to the task.
BATTLESHIP O'HIGGINS
NOT SOLD TO SPAIN
Absurd War Rumor Quickly Punc
tured by a Denial From
Chile.
Br* f ''nl fable to The Call and the New York
HeraM. Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
VALPARAISO DE CHILE, June
28.â The London report that the Chilean
warship O'Higgins haa been sold to
Spain is absurd. The warship is now
on its way between St. Vincent and Rio
de Janeiro. Chile will not sell any of
her warships.
WASHINGTON, June 28.â The O'Hig
gins has not been sold to Spain, and
positive information has reached here
that Chile will not sell the ship to any
Government.

Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery.
It is a marvelous remedy that correct*
all disorders of the digestion, invigorates
the liver, and fills the blood with the life-
giving elements that build new flesh and

flesh-builder. It cures 98 per cent, of all
cases of consumption and is a specific for
diseases due to disorders of the digestion
or imperfect nutrition. Druggists sell it.
"Myself and wife." writes Mr. H. G. Adam 9,
of Turners Station, Henry Co., Kt., "have taken
6ve bottles of your ' Golnen Medical Discovery '
and ' Favorite Prescription. 1 The medicines are
curing both of us. we can't say too much for
them or for you. My wife persuaded me to quit
the doctor here and try one bottle of your ' Gold-
en Medical Discovery.' I did so, and I thank God
for it. I hayÂ« recommended it highly to many of
my neighbor*. I told them that if it did not do
them one dollar's worth of good that I would pay
for it.
"I will give you a Httle statement of ray own
case. I was enervated, could hardly get up In
the morning, never got a whole night's sleep, waÂ»
short of breath, had a tight feeling In the stom-
ach, and was restless. I would throw up my
food, and had numerous other ailments which I
have not time to write about now. I now> feel
better and look better than ever before La

General Merritt goes to the front In
the Orient on a fast steamer, and
phould reach Manila without danger of
being intercepted by any cruiser which
Admiral Camaru might be ab' to de

Orders have been given to hasten the

companies will pitch their tents Thurs

Camp Barrett is an Ideal spot for the
location of a military command. Situated
a: the intersection of San Leandro road
and High street, hardly 100 yards from
Mather Station, it Is reached by three
lints of electric cars and is less than half
a mile from Fruitvale station on the
steam road. The camp Is on an Immense
field; bard, smooth and level as a floor.
Plenty of space has been allowed for the
company, officers and headquarters
streets, and ample room remains for drill
ing the entire regiment In extended order.
Quartermaster Heller had charge of lay
ing out the camp, and performed his work
to the entire satisfaction of everybody. It
is but a short distance from the estuary
and Lake' Menritt, so the men have tine
facilities for bathing, while the breeze
that blows up the estuary every afternoon
is soft and balmy, compared to the half
gale that sweeps over Camp Merritt. mak
ing it Just cool enough to be invigorating
and thoroughly enjoyable, while log is a
rarity.
Lieutenant Colonel Carrington is In
command of the camp at present, but he
expects Colonel Henshaw to arrive to
morrow morning from Chico. Colonel
Carrington's long 1 service on Governor
Budd's staff has brought him into contact
with all the company officers now In camp
and the most & rdial relations exist be
tween them.
Colonel Carrington and Liieutenan 1 . Hel
ler are the only officers here who have
been appointed to positions in the new
regiment, with the exception of the sir
geons, who, with Captain Murray, Fourth
United States Cavalry, are busy as bt-.os
preparing for the mustering in of the
troops. Adjutant Smith of the Fifth In
fantry has been detailed for temporary
duty at Cr-mp Barrett and is acting as ad
jutant. He is a candidate for the posi
tion of regimental adjutant, but Governor
Budd has not indicated yet who be will
name or the position, although he made
Bovcrsil appointments to-day.
The first and most important was that
of District Atorney William B. Barnes of
San Francisco, who has been given the
captaincy o: the Petaluma company.
Barnes has accepted the appointment and
â will report foi duty to-morrow, when his
company will arrive.
â  Cyrus L. Meggett was appointed first
lieutenant. He has not been assigned, but
will piobsibly join Company G of San Ra
f-.-!
Yandell Foote, son of United States Dis
trict Attorney Font.-, has been offered a
second lietitenanacy as soon as he secures
his discharge from the Fourteenth United
States Infantry, in which he recently en
listed.
* A detachment of Company F of Oak
land was first on the ground and had the
tents pitched for the company, which,
however, will not go into camp until to
morrow. The Colusa company followed
soon after, landing at Sather station, and

ABOARD THE NEWPORT.
Batteries H and K, Third United
States Artillery, Are Off
for Manila To-Day.
The signal to break camp at 9 o'clock
yesterday morning was a most welcome
sound to the men of Batteries IT and X,
Third United States Artillery, at Camp
Miller, on the Presidio reservation. It was
a break in the monotony of camp life, and
as all the men had been anxiously wait-
Ing for the ordf>r to embark for Manila
they worked with unusual vigor and alac
rity in pulling' down their tents and get
ting everything loaded on the trucks to
be conveyed in advance to the steamer
Newport.
At about 10:30 o'clock the men were
lined up and for three-quarters of an houx
they, together with the large number of
interest. â (] spectators, were entertained
with music by the Third Artillery band.
These two batteries presented a fine ap
pearance, as they are made up of manly
looking men. both physically and intel
lectually. This* is especially true of the
recruits, many of whom were enlisted in
the East. "That is as fine a body of sol
diers as I have ever seen." remarked Ma
jor Hess, who until yesterday was in com
mand of the Manila battalion of the Thin*
Artillery. "The Chicago recruiting officer
wrote me that the men he had unlisted
wnre far above the average, both In phys
ical build and education, and now that I
have seen and become acquainted with
these recruits I am of the same opinion.' 1
At 11:15 the battalion, composed of 40<5
men, was given the order to march, and as
it passed out of the Presidio gate led by
the Third Artillery band, it was given
round after round of cheers by th<Â» men
of Battery D, California HeaVy Artillery,
fn command of Captain Steere. who haÂ«
li.ied up his company just outside of the
Presidio entrance.
The line of march was down Lombard
street, Van Ness avenue, Golden <*.:ite av
enue. Market street, and Third street to
the Pacific Mail dock, where the troops
went on board of the Newport.
The officers of 11 Lattery are Captain
James O'Hara and Lieutenant B. M.
Kessler, and those of X battery are Cap
tain Charles W. Hobbs mid Lieutenant
Lloyd England.
CAPTAIN MARCH SMILED.
The Leader of the Astor Battery
Welcomed Refreshments
From the Red Cross.
"H"ray fer de Raster Bat'ryâ h'ray,
h'ry!" With a wild war whoop and a
nourish of wooden swords the rag-tag
army, its gay overalled captain plunging
at Its head, poured into Post street, and
for a moment nearly blocked the progress
of those pets of Astor toward their boats.
It was a royal greeting from the garri
son of the back yard to the army of the
front.
The tents of the battery at Camp Mer
ritt were pulled down and packed aboard
the camp wagons at f> o'clock yesterday
morning. At 11, without any wild huz
zas ana without any ostentation. Cap
tain March led his men from camp and
directly to the Mail dock, via Post. Mar
ket and Second streets. A half dozen big
mules drew the six little cannon, and the
men were in heavy marching order.
At the Mail dock the hundreds of friends
that the pleasant fellows of the hatt< ry
have made since their arrival here were
there to meet them laden with all manner
of good things that this time were not
haughtily ignored at the order of their
unhungry captain. The guns were he
decked and bei zened with great bunches
of blossoms and ribbons, and the men
themselves \*ere made florally beautiful.
The whole affair has more the semblance
of a lawn party than a leave-taking for
the wars.
Captain March's smile thawed out and
ran in shimmering little driblets all over
the dock, so every one got a little of it
and was happy. There was no cold shoul
der for the ladies of the Red Cross. A
number of them wore there with little
offerings of sandwiches and other short
bites that were received with becoming
gratitude and eaten with unbecoming
haste. The ladies of the Cross retreated
down the dock, warmed to further kind
nesses by the unsuspected and permeant
smile of Mr. Astor's captain.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29, 1898.
MERRITT'S POLICY OUTLINED
He Has Prepared a Proclamation to the
Philippine Islanders Assuring Them of
America's Friendship.
Major General Wesley Merritt, U. S. A., who leaves this morning on the steamer
Newport for Manila to assume the military and civil Governorship of the Philippine Islands,
outlined his plan of operations yesterday.
"I am anxious to arrive at the seat of action as soon as possible. We should arrive
at Manila about July 25, and certainly not later than the last day of that month. My instruc
tions to General Mac Arthur, in charge of the ships that sailed on Monday, were to hasten
to Honolulu as fast as steam could take him. The vessels of his fleet are to coal without de
lay and we will meet him at the islands and then resume the voyage to Manila.
"The condition in which I will find affairs at the islands when I arrive will naturally
influence my plan of campaign. When General Greene left here his instructions were to the
effect that, if, after a conference with Admiral Dewey, he thought it best to take possession
of the islands, he should proceed to do so. lam no glutton for military glory and would be
pleased to hear that Greene had distinguished himself.
"How will I take possession?
"With as little display of either force or ceremony as possible.
"My first official act will be the issuance of a proclamation from the United States
Government, setting forth oir position regarding the Philippines. This is intended to relieve
the minds of the people and inform them of the object of our errand. The proclamation has
already been prepared and has been translated into Spanish. It will be printed in the papers
and will receive wide distribution. We wish to correct the impression, spread by the
Spanish and their emissaries, that we are going to harass the islanders.
"Will I take peaceful possession? Peaceful or otherwise, just as it comes, but I will
take it, no matter what obstacles I may find in my path of duty."
General Merritt praised the men who will form his expeditionary forces, saying: "I
think the troops are made up of excellent material. They need more drilling and setting-up
exercise than it has been possible to give them, but this can be overcome and can hardly be
called a defect. They are splendidly equipped and constitute a good working force.
"I was anxious to make my friend. Major J. L. Rathbone, who is a widely known res
ident of California, a member of my personal staff. Through the illness of his wife this is
not possible. Failing in this I have recommended that he be appointed to such a position in
the Department of the Pacific that he may represent me here.
"I would be derelict in my duty if I failed to thank the people of California for their
unbounded hospitality, extended to both myself and my command. They have been more
than kind ajid words fail me in which to express gratitude."

and Australia mails to Auckland and Syd
ney once a month, and it would have
been hard work getting a steamer to take
up the run. As it is. the Alameda will
po out on schedule time, much to the de
light of the traveling public, with which
th.- steamer is a great favorite.
The only vessels that are sure to g-o out
with troops in a week or so are the City
of Puehla and Peru. The latter is being
ftted out at the Mail dock, and will be
ready on time, while the Puehla is at sec

peller put on and a new smokestack
fitted.

and the State of California, from Oregon,

NO VISITORS ALLOWED.
General Miller Will Issue an
Order to That Effect.
Brigadier General Miller Issued an order
yesterday from the First Brigade head
quarters detailing an armed guard to be
placed around the field hospital for the
purpose of permitting no civilian to pass
within the enclosure occupied by the hos
pital. This order, in every way, is one of
the most important issued from Camp
Merritt, as It affects the health of San
Francisco. General Miller said he had re

surgeons that civilians are in the habit
of visiting the hospital and going in
among the patients without permission.
These people manage to gain an admit
tance by slipping tn when the guard is not
watching them. Many of the soldiers in
the hospital are afflicted with contagious
diseases, and these could readily be con
tracted by the civilian visitors, and in this
way a deadly epidemic be, carried to the
city. Therefore as a precaution no one
will be permitted to cross the lines in the
future unless provided with the proper
authority to do so.
CAMP MILLER.
Major Hess Has Been Relieved
and Major Grugan Is Now
in Command.
Major Hess of the Third United States
Artillery, who 1b soon to go before the
retiring board, has been relieved of the
command of Camp Miller and has been
succeeded by Major prugafl, commandjcf
the battalion of Batteries D and G of the
Sixth Artillery, which arrived on Monday
from the East. Lieutenant Fleming is
now the adjutant of Camp Miller. These
batteries brought six breechloading' puns
with them, but no horses. It is expected
that they will procure horses at Manila,
for which port they will sail on the fourtn
expedition. Meantime they will perfect
themselves in what is known as the man
ual of the piece.
CORPORAL FLINT.
A Courteous Attache of Gene-
ral Merritt's Headquarters
Sails for Manila To- Day.
The young: man who has been doing
guard duty at the door of Major General
Merritt's offices In the Phelan building has
by his courteous conduct made many
friends among those who have had occa
sion to call at military headquarters dur
ing the last few weeks. His name is T. J.
Flint, who is a corporal of Company 1,
Twenty-third United States Infantry.
Corporal Flint, who has nerved in ths
regular army eight years, five of which he
spent in Arizona, goes to Manila as an
attache of General Merritt's headquarters.
He takes with him four homing pigeons
which he will turn loose from the steamer
Newport on the second day out with mes
sages for San Francisco, one of which
will be for The Call.
HEADQUARTERS CHANGED
Major General Otis Will Move
From Camp Merritt to the
Phelan Building To-Day.
Major General Otis, In command of the
Philippine expeditionary forces, w\Â£\ Â£hls
morning move his headquarters from
Camp Merritt, where he -ias been located
for several weeks, to the Phelan building.
He and his staff will occupy the offices
that were vacated by Major General Mer
ritt, Governor General of the Philippines.
Beginning with to-day Major Central Otis
will virtually assume the duties of com
mander of the new army corps, the
Eighth, although no official order to that
effect up to date had been (sued by Gov
ernor General Merritt.
Immediately after the departure of Gen
eral Merritt. who Mils on the Newport at
10 o'clock this morning, General Oiis will
devote his entire attention to the organiz
ing and dispatching of the fourth Manila
expedition, l"i- this expedition the steam

wish that this be done "before many
days." It is said that he has impressed

of getting all these troops to Manila with
all possible haste, and the department
has given assurances that there shall be

WORDS FROM THE FLEET
Carrier Pigeon Dispatches
From the Third Squadron
for Manila.
When the transport fleet bearing the
soldiers across the broad Pacific to aid
Dewey sailed from this port last Monday
it was the desire of all to have one last
â word of farewell with those left behind.
Nearly all had that one 'last word," but
there were many who by force of circum
stances did not have, that pleasure. |E vca
â when the big steamers -were far out at sea
the wish to send some little word to
the loved fines at home was felt by the
soldiers. To accomplish this no better
messenger than the dove could be found,
and well the gentle bird performed the
service, as it di- for Noah of old. A num
ber of carrier pigeons were placed on the
flagship Indiana and when out at sea mes
sages were written and the swift-flying
little carriers were sent on their long voy
age across many miles of ocean. The birds
belong to H. F. Whitman of 2045 Alameda
avenue, Alameda. Late in the afternoon
they reached their cotes, fatigued by their
long flight. â -.-.. ,

WORDS OF WARNING.
SO much consideration has been given of late to
expressions of British sentiment favorable to
American annexation of the Philippine Islands
and other colonies of Spain, that it is worth while to
direct attention to certain words of warning from the
same source. Colonial possessions are not viewed by
all Englishmen as desirable, and some of the sin
cerest friends of the United States In that country
are now citing the experience of the British empire
itself as a proof that we will venture upon a hazard
ous and uncertain career if we follow her lead as a
model instead of profiting by it as a warning.
Henry Labouchere describes the result of colonial
expansion upon British politics in these words: "We
used to glory that we were a non-military nation.
We have drifted into the position of a nation with
larger armaments than any other. No matter what
we spend on armaments we are called to spend more.
We hold a larger portion of the globe than any other
nation. So absorbing becomes earth hunger when
once indulged, that we are every year adding new
territories to our empire. And what is the result?
All domestic reforms are put aside as unworthy to oc
cupy our imperial minds. If a poor man asks for
bread he is toid joyfully to starve with the comforting
reflection that he is a citizen of an extensive and ex
panding empire."
The truth of these words will not be questioned by
any one familiar with the course of British politics.
Again and again Mr. Gladstone, in the course of his
illustrious career, was thwarted in his efforts to ac
complish some great reform at home t>y the interfer
ence of foreign complications, arising from some of
the wide scattered colonies of the empire. At this
very time Great Britain leaves her people half edu
cated and serious local evils unremedied, because so
much of her attention, her wealth and her energies
are required to maintain her prestige in Asia and
Africa.
It is not in this generation only tha.t the wiser class
of British patriots have been averse to colonial ex
pansion. Nor have the objections to the expansive
policy been founded solely upon the interference of
that policy with home reforms. It has been pointed
out in times past that colonial possessions of the em
pire have not only prevented the workingman at
home from getting a crust of bread, but have been
actually a cause of military weakness to the nation.
In his essay on the West Indies, Macaulay says:
"There are some who assert that in a military and
naval point of view the West Indies are of great im
portance to this country. This is a common but a
monstrous misrepresentation. We venture to say
that colonial empire has been one of the greatest
curses of modern Europe." After referring to the
disastrous experience of Spain and Holland and Por
tugal with their colonies, he adds: "If the experi
ence of others is lost upon us, shall we not profit by
our own? What have we not sacrificed to our in
fatuated passion for trans-Atlantic dominion. * *
This inspired us with the project of conquer
ing America. This induced us to resign all the ad
vantages of our insular situation â to embroil ourselves
in the intrigues and fight the battles o/ half the conti
nent â to form coalitions which were Instantly broken
and to give subsidies which were never earned.
* * Shall we never learn wisdom? Shall
we never cease to prosecute a pursuit wilder than the
wildest dreams of alchemy with all the credulity and
all the profusion of Sir Epicure Mammon?"
Certain British jingoes engaged in this pursuit
would be glad to have America emtoark with them
and help them fight their battles. They urge us to
an alliance and to the annexation of Hawaii, the Phil
ippines and everything in sight. That course would
mean our embroilment in all European wars here
after, and the sacrifice of all home reforms to imperial
policies. It would be to bring upon America all the
disasters which, according to Labouchere and Ma
caulay, have already befallen Great Britain.
The value of the technicality has again been demon
strated. It was used here a few months ago to ac
cord freedom to a convicted forger, and the happy
man has shown his appreciation of the situation by
indulging in forgery again. This time, however, he
went to Chicago to do it, and possibly the techni
cality is not held so high there as on this coast.
There arc plenty of arguments against the annexa
tion of Hawaii without introducing as one of them
the theory that the islands may one day be swallowed
up of the sea. There is not even a continent which
can be certain of lasting forever.
The thief caught recently with his hand in a wo
man's pocket must be given credit for some perspicu
ity. At least he had found the pocket.
Possibly Germany means nothing by concentrating
warships at Manila, not even to be polite.
A HAND-ME-DOWN NATIONAL POLICY.
Q PUBLIC policy is not a matter of artifice and
/ \ manufacture. It must develop out of the na
ture of things.
Many yellow papers are busy just now manufac
turing "a hand-me-down policy," a sort of political
panacea, warranted to fit all cases. One of the most
pretentious of these efforts and the least honest in
its motive comes of course from Hearst's journal.
Its leading features are the annexation of Hawaii
and the purchase of coaling stations in the West In
dies! These two features reveal a conspiracy that
has been promoted by some corrupt newspapers and
some corrupt men. One may ask why annex Ha
waii and not Cuba? If the possession of Honolulu,
2000 miles away from the western end of the Nicar
agua canal, is important to the integrity of that great
enterprise and international necessity, why is not the
possession of Havana, within 500 miles of its east
ern end, more important? Honolulu is not on the
shortest route from the western end of the canal to
Asia, to Yokohama, Hongkong and Manila. That
route passes only 100 miles west of San Francisco.
Cuba lies directly in the shortest route for all com
merce leaving or entering the canal T>y the eastern
end. Cuba commands the Windward Passage and
the channel of Yucatan and so commands completely
the Caribbean Sea. Why annex distant Hawaii,
more than 2000 miles off the shortest route to Pa
cific commerce, and drop Cuba, within a day's steam
of the east end of the canal and commanding the
shortest route to Atlantic commerce? Why buy
West Indian coaling stations, farther away from
the vital point and far less commanding, when we
can take Cuba at once? The answer involves an
inquiry into the selfish personal motives of Hearst
and some others, as revealed by circumstantial tes
timony. The Journal urged recognition of the Cu
ban insurgent Government. All of its representa
tions about that Government and the military force
behind it are proved to have been lies, by the reports
of our army officers who have penetrated the in
terior of the island in search of what had no exist
ence. The first inquiry is why did Hearst lie about
the so-called Cuban Government and army, to in
duce Congressional recognition and create a misin
formed public opinion that would coerce the Presi
dential assent?
To answer this inquiry it is only ?!tcessary to il
luminate the situation with the testimony of Mr.
Kohlsaat of the Chicago Times-Herald, who was of
fered $2,000,000 of the Cuban bonds, printed as a
blanket mortgage on the island, to be validated by
recognition of the insurgent Government, and placed
to the amount of $400,000,000, in the hands of the
Cuban Junta in New York, to be put where they will
do the most good in securing the recognition neces
sary to their validity. What part of this vast sum is
used in bribery of newspapers no one can know, but
the fact of its existence and of the offer of $2,000,000
of it to a Chicago paper are all that is needed to
close the inquiry into Hearst's personal motive.
Having a newspaper property that loses money in le
gitimate business, recoupment is possible by taking
bribes to urge a domestic policy that will validate
foreign bonds issued by bandits, and adventurers.
The President and General Lee were undoubtedly
aware of the situation, for they both urged against
any recognition of the insurgent Government. But
when the case went to Congress Hearst's papers and
the other yellow papers of the country howled in
chorus for recognition. For a long time the issue
was in doubt. It was the Senate against the House.
Finally recognition was struck out of the declaration
of war, which was left in the form of .1 peremptory
demand on Spain to dismember herself or we would
treat her refusal as a casus belli. Logically such
a demand should have led to our taking what Spain
is compelled to drop in the West Indies. The in
surgent Government and armies being, in a diplo
matic and military sense, merely myths, the expul
sion of Spain being the end of actual organized gov
ernment on the island, could mean only our posses
sion and government.
But that would invalidate the Cuban bonds. It
would nullify the Junta 1 ? blanket mortgage on the
island. It would destroy all value in the bonds in
the possession of yellow editors, except as admoni
tory reminiscences of treason to their own country
and greed of the substance of Cuba. In this situa
tion that remarkable qualification found its way into
the Congressional declaration, by which we pledge
ourselves not to acquire or annex Cuba! Note that
no other inch of Spanish territory is under protec
tion of that pledge. Cuba, the most valuable and
necessary of all the Spanish domain, is rejected and
we are left free to take all that is less valuable and
less necessary!
Why? Because abstention from annexing Cuba
may put the Junta on top after our soldiers have ex
pelled the Spanish. Recognition will then be a
necessity and the bonds and blanket mortgage will
be valid, and begin to draw interest! It is highly
probabie that a revelation of the facrs would show
the use of money by the Planters' Trust, to secure
advocates of Hawaiian annexation among American
newspapers. This being so, no one doubts that
Hearst's great "national policy" is for his personal
profit. To earn a fee and validate his Cuban bonds
Hawaii must be taken and Cuba must be rejected.
There is the whole case. If his policy can be ac
counted for on any other grounds, we would be glad
to know what they are.
0 WARNING TO CORPORATIONS.
ALL through the Mississippi Valley, and to a
considerable extent in the East, a widespread
interest has been manifested in the disclosures
made in the recent preliminary trial of certain former
officers of the Pacific Express Company who have
been charged by the present officers with embezzle
ment. Nor is the public interest in the subject at
all surprising, for, according to reports, the evidence
in the case has exposed to the full light of day some
of the worst effects of that corruption which seems
to be the inevitable result of bringing a corporation
and a Legislature into close connection.
Reports of the case are to the effect that the pres
ent officers of the company charge their predecessors
with having embezzled some $200,000 of the com
pany's money, and the defense asserts that the money
was not misappropriated, but was used for the pur
pose of defeating hostile legislation at the State capi
tal. It appears that the company maintained a lobby
at an annual cost of $10,000, and found it necessary
to do so in order to defeat bills designed to reduce
express rates.
The former officers of the company hold that this
expenditure, being essential to the business of the
road, was a due and legitimate expenditure. The
new officers take the opposite view, and by their
prosecution have led to a disclosure of the whole mat
ter in court. Up to the present time only a pre
liminary trial has been had, and it is not clear how
far the disclosures may go before the end is reached.
Enough seems to have been made public, however
to show that the lobby, having once fastened itself
upon the company, could not be shaken off. The
legislative $10,000, -which was first granted to .meet
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29, 1898.
a particular emergency, became in the end a perma
nent annual expenditure.
In the meantime it is said that circulars containing
the gist of the evidence thus far brought out have
been printed and are being scattered over the Mis
sissippi Valley States as campaign documents for
Populists, radical Democrats and others who are
making the fight against corporations in all forms.
The facts will undoubtedly aid in strengthening popu
lar antagonism to corporations, and in confirming
suspicions that all are more or less active in bribing
legislators. To that extent a grave injury will be
done to many honest companies, and moreover the
effect as a whole upon the public mind will be bad.
The moral of the case is too clear to be mistaken.
Corporations should not permit themselves to be bled
by dishonest lobbyists. It may be difficult to shake
off the gang that has once fastened itself upon such
an organization, but there is a way to do it. In the
Nebraska case, for example, it is safe to say the new
officers of the Pacific Express Company will never
be called upon to put up $10,000 for the boys at Lin
coln. The Southern Pacific Company might profit
by the example.
AT yesterday's meeting of the Board of Super
visors permission was granted a committee of
merchants to remove the dilapidated Cogswell
fountain at the junction of California and Market
streets and raise in its place a flag pole ioo feet high.
This probably disposes of the idea entertained by
some of our esteemed but inartistic contemporaries
of erecting on this spot a statue of Admiral Dewey,
for it is extremely improbable that permission to
raise a flag pole can be construed into authority to
erect a statTie â though it must be admitted that lan
guage is not likely to mean much to persons who
think a statue is rendered attractive by surrounding
it with street cars, cobbles, boxes, drays and other
prosy instruments of business.
The flag pole also disposes of another suggestion
made in a letter we have just received from Captain
Goodall â a suggestion, which, by the way, had it been
made sooner would have been worthy much con
sideration. Perhaps it is not too late, however, to
discuss it in another relation.
Captain Goodall calls attention to the fact that San
Francisco is without a public lavatory and he pro
poses that the city erect one at the junction of Cali
fornia and Market streets in place of the Cogswell
fountain. In his letter he briefly outlines a plan.
This contemplates a two-story structure with accom
modations for both sexes and proper attendance. He
thinks the expense of building a lavatory and main
taining it afterward would be justified by the benefit
conferred upon the people.
Although it will probably not be practicable to
change the determination of the merchants who have
decided to erect a flag pole at the junction of Califor
nia and Market streets, there is nothing to prevent
the Supervisors considering Captain Gcodall's sug
gestion with a view to locating a lavatory in some
other place. It would be possible to erect such a
building at any of the junctions except those already
occupied by fountains. There is a possible site at
the intersection of Post, Montgomery and Market
streets. We understand that the cable turntable at
this point will soon be removed, it being the inten
tion of the Market Street Company to convert the
Post street line into an electric road and turn it into
Montgomery street.
If this is done a lavatory nfight be located on the
site of the turntable. Such a building to be useful
ought to be on the line of travel, and there is no spot
in the city â except it may be Market and Keaniy
streets â over which a greater number of people travel
in a day than pass and repnss at Montgomery and
Market streets. At all events, a lavatory is prefera
ble to a statue. We commend Captain Goodall's
suggestion to the artistic sense of the Zulus who
have proposed to surround a bronze effigy of the
hero of Manila with cheap eating houses, wholesale
dry goods stores, drays, humming street cars and bil
lowing cobbles and basalt blocks.
SUPPORTING THE CHINESE.
COMMENTING upon the controversy now go
ing on over the employment of Chinese labor
in this city in the manufacture of uniforms un
der Government contracts, the Bulletin says: "The
slacnty of The Call in charging Major Long with
conniving at the employment of coolies, and in in
fluencing the minds of the laboring classes against
the quartermaster has come near bringing about a
row which might seriously injure this city by caus
ing the Government to let future contracts in other
parts of the country, when they should be let here."
Upon this theme of an injury to the city, possibly
resulting from the exposure of the coolie work by
The Call, the Bulletin harps at considerable length
and closes by saying: "San Francisco is abundant
ly able to perform all the work necessary to be done.
All the merchants and manufacturers who have been
questioned declare this to be true, and that it would
be most unfortunate if an effort to array the laboring
classes against the Government officials should result
in a great rumpus that would give Washington a
false impression of the conditions existing in this
city."
The only conclusion to be drawn from that argu
ment is that it would be better to connive at the em
ployment of coolie labor on Government contracts
than to protest against it and run the risk of losing
the contracts altogether. The Bulletin would hush
the matter up and let the Chinatown sweatshops do
the work. The Call is of a different conviction on
the subject.
The implication that we have tried to array the
laboring classes against the Government officials is
false. The report that Chinese were employed on
Government contracts in this city led to an investiga
tion by labor councils and The Call published the
news of these investigations and made some of its
own. It also published communications between
labor representatives here and authorities at Wash
ington. All these things were current events of in
tciest to our people and, therefore, legitimate sub
jects for a live newspaper to make known. That
The Call sympathized with the efforts of the labor
unions and councils to prevent the employment of
coolies on the army contracts is beyond question, but
in supporting them it made no attempt to array
them against the Government officials nor to raise
what the Bulletin calls a "great rumpus."
As a matter of fact, no rumpus or row is in sight,
and there is no danger that the city will suffer from
the exploitation which has been made of the coolie
work. On the contrary, the white labor of the city
will be benefited and the interest of our working men
and women materially improved. The contest has
been a straightforward, open fight for white labor
against coolie labor, and The Call is glad to have
been able to render assistance to the white laborers
of the city in winning it. That the Bulletin would
have preferred to hush the matter up and let the
coolies continue to get the work is susceptible of
but one explanation, and that is too obvious to re
fluire statement,
A GOOD SUGGESTION.

ONE OF NATURE'S NOULEMEN.
Editor San Francisco Call: Noticing in
the issue of your paper of this date the
sudden death of Robert McMurray of Ne
vada County, whose career as a mining
capitalist you recite in brief, I am im
pelled by a desire to have general recog
nition accorded his noble qualities of
heart in asking for a little space in your
valuable paper devoted to the theme, "Af
fection's Last Offeringâ from one who
knew him well."
Robert McMurray was. In all respects,
one of the noblest of his kindâ a man ever
ready to attest by a manly and generous
act the full measure of his earnest and
sympathetic nature; with a mind so com
prehensive of the needs of the toiling
classes that even when exacting require
ments of his representation of large min
ing interests harassed him almost beyond
endurance, he yet found, ever and al
ways, the needed moments to extend the
helping hand and offer cheering and
kindly words to the anxious and needy
toilers: with a purse always at the dis
posal of a friend, and a due consideration
for that genuine worth in man or woman
hood that refrained from the appeal. He
found the opportunity to bring gladness
to suffering hearts without ostentation,
avoiding the thankful prarse which his
action so well earned. Chapter upon
chapter may be written upon the pages
of the history of Nevada County dwelling
upon the indomitable will which, backed
by his progressive spirit, has made his
superb efforts for her development so
gran .y successful, but yet standing out
in bold relief as a separate and distinct
evidence of greatness of soul will be the
generous deeds performed by this great
hearted man who lies cold and lifeless in
his beautiful home, in itself a monument
to his refined and cultured nature. Yes,
the State at large has met with a loss Be
vere, indeed, in that one of its most dis
tinguished pioneer miners has left it for
ever; but Its loss is but a trifle us com
pared with those narrower sections where
he was almost daily st-f-n and the better
knownâ ln his much loved county of Ne
vada. There will be a void in the ranks
of its citizens which no other man can
fill, and in the little, peaceful town of
North San Juan the loss of Robert Mc-
Murray will ho the most severely felt.
for it was there especially that "Mac."
in the presence of that large family, that

who hailed his coming with delight, and

improvised structuresâ and into all Gov

proclaim martial law there, for the reg
ular troops, who have but very vague
ideas of discipline, have begun to assist,
their plundering brethren. There, between
Tampa, Cayenne, Hayti and Panama,
there always existed in times of peace an
innumerable crowd of broken-down fugi
tives from European law courts, of ad
venturers and desperadoes, such as no
other region of the globe ever saw. Now
they have all met there. â¢ â¢ The ships
captured by the American navy do not

AN INTRODUCTIONâ A. 8., Pescadero,
Cal. This correspondent wants to know if
it is proper for a lady to say on being in
troduced to a gentleman, "I am pleased to
meet you." That depends whether it is a
pleasure to her to make the acquaint
of the gentleman. If it is not a pleasure
there is no rule of etiquette that requires
her to tell an untruth. If it is a pleasur.-"
she should so say. but if it is not she
should not say anything, but acknowle<lioÂ»
the introduction with a bow and then pro
ceed with conversation if there is occasion
for such.

the period of two years. At the expira

the war terminate before the expiraii"u

done during the Civil War, when the en

the diplomas were awarded, with the re

Mechanics' Pavilion was ablaze with

dered lowa's hardy representatives, the
Fifty-first Regiment by the Native
Daughters of this city.
When the lowa boys marched before
the tremendous gathering, with a .true
military swine: and soldierly bearing,
headed by their splendid band, a shout
of greeting arose from the throats of
the 5000 present that nearly raised the
roof.
The programme prepared by Golonel

and every number was loudly applaud

bers on the following programme were
gone through and every movement was
watched with deep interest:

The extended order drill of Company
M, under command of Captain Clark,
won an ovation. Such precision and
unanimity has seldom been seen in
this city. Without a word of com
mand but simply by a movement of
sword, the little officer made his well
drilled company go through a number
of difficult evolutions. Their firing
without signal was like clockwork and
received many favorable comments.
The companies disengaged were
marched into the machinery hall and
were refreshed with coffee, fruit and
dainties by the ladies whose guests
they were.
Owing to a press of business Major
General Merritt could not be present,
and Major General Otis reviewed the
in his stead.

Many of the companies were bedecked
with carnations, pr â nted them in the

WITH FUSEL OIL
JOURNALIST HAROLD LEACH
COMMITS SUICIDE.
A New Poison for Self-Destruction
Entered on the Records of the
Coroner's Office.
It is a traditional belief In the Coroner's
office that there is "nothing new in sui
cides"âthat there is ever "a similar, case"
In the archives of the city dead house.
There Is also a dictum that the profes
sional man, the handler of gross or
Fuoile poisons, seldom, if ever, uses this
knowledge to commit self-murder by the
I easiest and most painless manner. Jn
other words, that when he resorts to sui
cide he usually adopts a brutal method.
A case that came to the Morgua yester
day, however, disproved both these propo
sitions. It was that of Harold Leach, a
Journalist and educated in law. He was
an exceedingly bright and versatile writer
both in pruse and verse, and many a
clever skit from his yen is still going the
rounds of the press.
For several years he has been a con
tributor to numerous "publications in the
East, but baa devoted his time largely to
the editing of the Wholesalers' and Re
tailors' Review, a journal published In
this city in the interest of the liquor
trade. 11l health pursued him till he fin
ally lost his voice, and he evidently eon
i that the battle of life was not
worth further waging. Accordingly, he
.red for a novel exit, and his efforts
â vv, ri successful. He w;is found dead on
Boor of his room at SOS Mission street,
ami a vial on his dresser told the story
of his self-destruction. It contained a
â mall quantity of fusel oil, diluted with
An autopsy disclosed the fact
that the body was saturated with the
drup. notwithstanding the fact that he
was not a hard drinking man. Fusel oil
la composed of a number <>f ethers and
acids found in alcohol, and gives to bran
mi whiskies what Is known as the
"aroma" or " bouquet.' The dead man
knew iliP â¢ s of the concentrated
stuff and made use of his knowled^
fectually. as shown by the fact that medi
cal authorities describe the results of the
administration of the poison as delirium,
: ular paralysis and coma, followed by
death.
'ihe relatives of the deceased reside In
Bcranton, Pa.
Ready for the Convention.
The various committees of the Anrl-
Civil Service League met In B'nal B'rith

A complete report of work already done by
the local Red Cross Society was sent to the
National Red Cross Society and the receipt of
it was acknowledged by the following tele

"Mrs. l.'ur.bar â Secretary California Red
Cross: Report 13th received and highly com
mended. Our delegate, Judge Sheldon, will
reach San Francisco in about ten days. Com
mand us freely for advice and encouragement.
"BARTON."
A letter written by an officer connected with
the California regiment to his family had the
following interesting bit of news tor the Red
Cross workers. He says: "The books, maga
: zincs and papers donated by the Red Cross
S.oclety have proved a great source of pleasure
i to all hands and have lessened the monotony
I of the run here to a great extent. The next
: expedition should be furnished with a good
supply of salt water soap In order that the
1 men may be able to use salt water to wash
1 with, as it is not practicable to furnish enough
.fresh water for this purpose. It is purposed
! to erect a large canvas bath tub after we
1 leave Honolulu for the men to bathe In. The
water will be supplied by one of the pumps so
I there will be a continuous flow of clean water
into it at all times during the day and even
ing."
Mrs. Harrington states that the next expedi
tion will be furnished with the above neces
; saries by the society, thus enabling the men to
enjoy their cooling dip.
Following is one of the many letters received
i by the society:

Fellow Citizens: In this year which Is

of America's sons, it is the desire of the corn
appointed to arrange for a fitting cele
bration ol the Fourth of July in th!s city that
every means be adopted to show the patriot-
Ism of San Francisco.
Realizing that you have been called upon
frequently of late to subscribe toward patri
otic undertakings, the committee has decided
to limit its expenditures to the amount of
money yearly appropriated for celebration pur
poses by the Board of Supervisors, and not to
ask the merchants or other citizens, as former
ly, for subscriptions.
You are, however, hereby respectfully re
quested to co-operate with your neighbors In
the matter of decorations. It will be impos
sible for this committee in observing the econ
omy adopted, to expend any amount for street
decorations; and therefore, it relies upon you
to exhibit your patriotism by expending "the
amount you would have subscribed to this
committee for the celebration, in decorating
your place of business in conjunction with
your neighbors, so that the line of parade may
be a continual decoration.
The committee feels confident in leaving this
matter In your hands, that you will aid In
making the city by the Golden Gate feel proud
when it awakes on the morning of the Fourth
of July and gazes on its patriotic dress Re

GREAT A. 0 . H. CELEBRATION.
Centennial of the Irish Rebellion to
Be Fittingly Observed on
July 4,
The Ancient Order of Hibernians have
arranged for a great national celebration
on July 4 at Schuetzen Park, San Rafael.
Since the union of the two branches of
this order throughout the United States
it has made great progress and
its membership has been largely increas
ed. The present year, the centennial
year of the Irish rebellion, it has held
celebrations in nearly every city and
town in the United States. These cele
brations have been of a twofold charac

Nearly Crushed by a Fence.
John Allison and his son, W. J. Allison,
of 511 Folsom street, were passing a new
ly erected building on Second street, near
Market, about 7 o'clock last evening,
when a fence about nine feet high, erect
ed above the sidewalk, fell. Young Alli
son, with much presence of mind, thrust
his father out into the street and then,
by agility, escaped with nothing worse
than a contused shoulder. Luckily there
wore no others passing beneath the fence
or numerous serious if not fatal results
might have followed Its fall.
LOADED WITH SOLDIERS FOR MANILA
The Troopship Valencia Sailed Yesterday for the Philippines
Carrying the North Dakota Regiment.
After many delays the troopship Valencia finally got away with the North Dakota troops aboard yesterday. No
body knew the hour she would sail, and In consequence there was little or no demonstration along the front. She passed
Meiggs wharf at 4:35 p. m. and, going full speed, was soon out of sight.
The steamer was to have been ready to sail with the Ohio, Indiana, Morgan City and City of Para last Monday,
but she was delayed. The Boldiers were sent down to her and she was ordered to sail with the tide yesterday morning.
Again the steamer was not ready and positive orders were sent for her to get into the stream at 3:30 p. m. At that hour
there was still some boiler tubes and machinery on the wharf, and it was after 4 o'clock before the vessel's lines were
ready to cast u:'f. Then she started away under a full head of steam on her way to Honolulu.
The Valencia is a good 12-knot steamer and made splendid time on her way out here from the East. She will go to
Honolulu at full speed, and as the other four vessels of the fleet will not average better than 10 knots the Valencia will
not be far behind when the islands are reached.
The Newport, with General Merritt aboard, sails to-day, and as she also will go down at full speed she will reach Hon
olulu before the rest of the fleet has coaled.

War Incidents.
Acting Assistant Adjutant General Ben
nett of the Department of California re
ceived information yesterday that the
First New York Volunteer Infantry Regi
ment, organized in New York City, is com
ing to San Francisco, but whether for
guard duty or for work in the Philippines,
is not yet known.
Major General Morriam, commanding
fhe Department of California, will return
this morning from Fort Vancouver.Wash.,
where he has been engaged for two week*
in disposing of accumulated business of
the Department of Columbia, which is
also under his jurisdiction.
Among the officers of Major General
Merritt's staff there are some truly po
lite and affable gentlemen, and "there
are others. 1 ' While it is true that news
paper men may at times seem two zeal
ous in their quest of news, yet they are
only performing their duty, disagreeable
aa it may be at times, owing to the su
percilious air of some staff officers who
have never been taught what gentility
means and who do not comprehend that
politeness costs nothing.
It is a pleasure, however, to come in
contact with such military officers as
Adjutant General Babcock, Major
Sturges and Major Thompson.
Another gentleman, more closely con
nected with Major General Merritt than
any officer of his staff, is Private Secre
tary "William Howell. He has at all times
and on all occasions treated the callers
at headquarters with the greatest civil
ity and kindness, at the same time guard
ing the interests of General Merritt in
a quiet and unobtrusive manner. It has
been evident to all who have had bus-
Iness at headquarters that General Mer
ritt reposes the utmost confidence in Mr.
Howell.
Recruits From Washington.
Twenty-four recruits, to fill Company
E, Washington Volunteers, arrived here
yesterday from North Yaquina, Wash.
The men were under the command of
Acting Sergeant Harry F. Coombs. They
were entertained by the ladies of the Red
Cross Society upon their arrival at the
terry.
Thomas J. Clunie 111.
For the last four days Thomas J.
Clunie, the well-known lawyer and' poli
tician, has been confined to his bed, the
result of a serious illness. Mr. Clunie
was first taken ill on Friday la?t. when
he contracted a cold and stomach disor
ders that demanded the immediate at
tention of his physician. Yesterday a
noticeable improvement took place and
it is expected that Mr. Clunie will be
abroad in a few days.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 28.â Some of the Industrial
specialties advanced In the early trading to
n pool buylne, Inside support or lndlvld-
ual causes, but a realizing movement later in j
Tobacco and Brooklyn Transit unsettled prices
and wiped out all but a few gains. The mar- i
ket was very narrow, and entirely professional,
stocks which were strong yesterday being sold 1
to realize to-day. Sugar, People's Gas, Pull
man. Consolidated Gas, Tobacco and Brooklyn
Transit and, in a slight degree, Manhattan,
all enjoyed their periods of strength. The j
Grangers at one time stiffened up to about last 'â 
night's close on strength in Rock Island due '
to Insiile support and in part to Burlington's j
favorable May statement showing an Increase i
In gross of $745,636, and In the surplus, alter
charges, of 5- 12,698. But the suspension for the i
present of, the grain movement and the know- j
ledge that the current earnings of the' Gran- i
gers are falling below last year's large aver- j
age brought realizing and fractional declines.
Union Paclllc preferred was quite a marked j
sufferer from the reports of rate cutting In
transcontinental passenger business. The rail
road list was very much neglected for the most I
part, the demand for stocks having apparently- I
died away entirely, In spite of many favoring
conditions of business and the continued ease
in money, which seems to -show no effect what
ever from any dÂ»mand to meet July obligations
or to take up the Government loan. The very
light demand for stocks is not accompanied by '
any pressure to sell large amounts, and. the j
result Is an almost stagnant market, in which
there Is nothing to indicate any change. The ;
new tax on Issues, transfers and sales of stock j
certificates continues to absorb a large amount I
of attention in Wall Street where the opinion j
prevails that unless its literal provisions can j
be successfully combated in the courts or I
legally evaded they will largely curtail profes- j
sional speculation and operations by room I
traders for a quick turn in the price of stock. \
Bonds reflect the pressure of available money j
for profitable employment and prices . continue
to advance. Total sales, $2,640,000.

been lost recently and the liabilities cannot be
very large. VSES**

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 28.â Nearly everything was
against the price of wheat at the opening.
The most depressing feature was the sharp
decline and apparent demoralization which
prevailed In Liverpool. The market seemed
wholly indifferent to our advance yesterday,
and July there was equal to 4%c lower than
the close last night. The weather, too, waa
fair and favorable throughout the winter wheat
belt, In marked contrast with the I conditions
which prevailed yesterday. This improve
ment in Itself was a weak factor, and when
the slump in Liverpool was added, the bear
ish sentiment became Irresistible. Much of
the long stuff taken on during the prevalence
of the bull sentiment yesterday was liqui
dated and there was active selling for the
short account and hammering of the market
by professional bears. Prices rallied on reports
from various sections of the country unfavor
able, and more especially from Kansas, reit
erating yesterday's advices about the sudden
deterioration of the crop prospects. Lower clos
ing Liverpool cables caused another sag In
values, and the market was heavy at a slight
Improvement on the lowest price of the day
until Bradstreefs report of the change for the
week In the world's visible supply was re
ceived. That gave a decrease In all positions
of 10.;,r,6,000 bushels, and caused a slight rally.
But the advance merely served the purpose of
the bears, who had come to the conclusion
that all the crop damage that had been heard I
of would still leave more tnan enough wheat
for all requirements, and consequently ex
tended the vlad hand to the buyers on the
Bradstreet's statement and accommodated
them with all the wheat they wanted for fu
ture delivery- Prices fell off once more, but re
covered some of the loss before the close. July
left off l%c down and September declined %c.
Liquidations In July by prominent longs and
thÂ» break In wheat started corn weak. Later
pome of the earlier loss was recovered on good
buying by shorts. July closed l%c lower.
Heavy selling by July longs caused a break
of l%c In oats. There was a partial recovery
on good buying by shorts and scalpers. July
closed me lower.
Heavy hog receipts and two more cases of
yellow fever In Mississippi were the apparent
causes for the weakness in provisions. Pork
declined Be, lard 16c and ribs 2%e. \

RAISE RATES
Water Companies Are
Now Satisfied.
PRETENSE OF GENEROSITY
SAY TIMES ARE TOO HARD TO
PAY MORE.
Existing Rates, However, Are Giving
a Fine Rate of Interest
on the Capital
Invested.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 28.
It has now beer, decided by the two wa
ter companies that they will not charge
the rates fixed in the ordinance which
caused so much popular Indignation when
passed last March. A few days ago, as
staled in the Call, Presld< i "f the
Oakland company paid that "our patrons
will have no cause for dissatisfaction, after
July 1." Tills was taken to mean that the
rates at present enforced and which are'
Bt.rtk'iently high, will be maintain*'.! 1 â¢â¢â -â 
cause any raise would certainly produce
any amount of dissatisfaction.
To-day J. H. T. Watkinson of the Con
tra Costa Company t=aid that his direc
tors had decided not to enforce the now
iat< s, but to collect under the old
ones. "The company is convinced," said
Mr. Watkinson, "that times .are hard 'aria
people are not able to pay high rates.
Many people are out of employment and
many businesses are not making money.
The wave of prosperity has not yet struck
California, and \ I people Will
be able to pay a little more- for water than
they can pay now. M
Mr. Watkinson'a consideration for the
â water rate payeri needs a little explana
tion. His figures submitted to the City
Council before the new rate was nxeii
showed that if the companies collected thÂ«
full amount under existing rates
without cutting for the sake of getting
business, they would receive a Sne rate
of interest on their investment. Mr. Wat
kinson and Mr. Dlngee both positively de
nied this, and declared that they
hnd charged about two-thirds of
tho existing rale and had lost
money. Blnce the first of March th- v
have collected rates under the ordinance
and consumers have found that the result
has been to double the cost of water and
In some instances to make it even greater.
Next year's report will undoubtedly show
that there was n.> need whatever for the
Ecandal shared by the City Council and
the water companies last February.
DEFENDED HERSELF . .
WITH A CURTAIN POLF
HOW MISS CLARK KEPT THE
CONSTAELE AT BAY.
Commended by the Court for Her
Pluck and Discharged From
Charge of Battery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 28.
Susan M. Clark, the superintendent of
the Woman's Exchange, .was in the Police
Court this morning upon the charge of
battering Constable yon Kapff. After
hearing the testimony the Judge dismissed
the case and commented very severely on
the ignorant actions of some young law
yers who act as debt collectors.
Last Friday Constable yon Kapff went I
to the exchange to attach the property of j
Miss Clark upon a claim assigned to
Messrs. Heaton <Â£ Hobson. The Jady told I
the intruders she had no interest in the
exchange, but they proceeded to take pos->
session, and left a young man .named
James Kelly in charge as a receiver.
Mlsa CiÂ«rk communicated with .the po
lice and Detectives Shorey and Holland !
went down to Investigate. They at once I
saw that Yon Kap;f had no right to act
as he did, and advised Miss Clark to call
a lawyer. She confided her troubles and !
placed her affairs in the hands of Attor
ney Abe La
As the young men did not leave as
quickly as Miss Clark desired there
was a skirmish. Yon Kapff proceed
ed to taki- , : ;uid appropriated Â«.
basket containing some money. The lady
then admits that she opened fire on him
with a curtain pel*. She plied it with such
good effect that the officer beat a hastj
retreat and finally he theratened to eject
the lady if she did not behave herself
Mis? Clark continued to misbehave with
her curtain poie. according to the consta
ble, and Attorney Heaton, who had kept
out of range of the weapon, advised the
constable to withdraw. Later he swore
to a complaint charging Miss Clark with
battery.
Judge Allen examined Attorney Oscar
G. Heaton and asked him whereon he
based his right to attach, property be
longing to the. exchange, knowing that
Mips Clark was not the proprietor. The
court also expressed regret that the cur
tain pole was not wir-in>rl with better ef
fect when the lady was admonishing the
constable.
Miss Clark's attorney declares that the
matter Is not yet ended and his client in
tends to seek redress for the annoyance
to which she has been subjected.

Taken From Its Mother.
OAKLAND, June 88.â William Carson
was granted the custody of the child of
his divorced wife this afternoon after a
bitter legal contest, which has occupied
the attention of Judge Ellsworth for over
a week. The child was born about two
months after the husband and wife were
divorced and one of the allegations in
his cross complaint was that he was not
the father of the child. Since the di
vorce Carson alleged before Judge Ells
worth that the mother of the girl has not
shown herself a fit person to have Its
custody, and after hearing all the testi
mony, which was a review of four years
of matrimonial quarrels, the court award
ed the child to Carson and denied the
rights of its mother.

NOT A TINGE
OF YELLOW.
Oakland Will Decorate So as
to Suggest Neither Spain
Nor Quarantine.
OAKLAND. Juno 2S.â The decoration of this city began to-day and
from the foot of Broadway up to^Eighth street hundreds of flags are now
flying. In accordance with a resolution passed by the Fourth of July com
mittee the national colors only are to be used. This does not confine dec
orations to national flags, but to the colors which comprise it. It is notice
able that in all the thousands of yards of bunting displayed there is not a
single tinge of yellow or anything to suggest quarantine or the offensive
ensign of the Spanish nation.
The decoration committee issued to-day the following request to the
merchants, property-owners and citizens:
The decoration committee of the Fourth of July celebration would
earnestly call your attention to the conditions under which we celebrate
this year.
Not since the great Civil War has there been witnessed such an in
tense general feeling of patriotism as Is evident to-day. It is everywhere.
In the home, in society, on the street. In our fair city it has risen to a
high point, and it is therefore fitting that the celebration should be in
keeping with the spirit of the times.
The committee will decorate Broadway and Washington streets as
never before. But this decoration will be of a general character. Each store
and house should make an effort to dress in gala attire. Decorate! deco
rate! decorate! The great sham battle, the unparalleled display of fire
works, the presence of a regiment from the local camp, will crowd our
streets witn people. Let your display measure up to your real patriotic
feeling, and it will do you good and increase the reputation of Oakland.
Let us make our business streets or houses look worthy of the day. Let
no one make himself conspicuous by failing to do his duty in this matter.
Yours patri.nic.illy. A. H. BREED, Chairman.

MAY BOY IS
IN MONTANA.
"Hon." B. Crampton
Took the Horse.
ANXIOUS TO BE AN OWNER
HE LEFT VERY QUIETLY WITH
WALLY EVANS' PRIDE.
Now He Will Return to Oakland to
Be Tried on a Charge
of Felony Em
bezzlement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, June 2H.
TV. D. Evans, the horse owner, better
known as Wally Evans, has found his
lost horse. May Boy. His colored servant,
"Hon." Beverly Orampton, so-called be
cause he declares he was once a road
overseer In Southern Florida, appropri
ated the animal and started out to make
money with him on Ins own account. For
these reasons Deputy Sheriff Al White
left Oakland to-day with requisition pa
pers for Montana to bring back the Hon.
Mr. Crampton to stand trial on a charge
of felony embezzlement.
A few weeks ago Wally Evans kept his
horse at the Oakland track. The animal
was a valuable one, and has frequently
landed some good purses for its owner.
One morning Mr. Evans, with a party
of friends whom he had brought from
San Francisco, went to the racetrack for
the purpose of giving an exhibition of his
fine animal for the benefit of his guests.
On going to the stable it was found to be
locked, and a little later Wally discovered
that May Boy and Mr. Crampton were
both missing.
A search was made for the animal and
its grouin, but nothing could be learned
of them in this State. Some time later
John Mott, who is acquainted with Evans
and his horse, saw May Boy on the Mon
tana circuit, in charge of Crampton, who
was entering the animal on his own ac
count. Mott at once communicated with
Evans, who swore out a .varrant for
Crampton's arrest. Requisition papers
were obtained from the Governor yester
day, and Crampton will be brought back
in a few days.
Evans declares that Crampton had no
right whatever to move the horse without
his permission, and declares that he has
never given his groom the slightest ex
cuse for thinking he could exercise his
own discretion in appropriating the ani
mal to his own benefit.
The stealing of May Boy was one of
the sensations of the track at the close
of the racing season, and had it not been
for Mott, Crampton and the animal might
still be making money on other tracks.
STILL AFTEB LONG.
The Labor Commissioner Wants to
Look After Army Contracts.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald has de
termined not to let rest the matter of the
making of soldiers' uniforms by Chinese.
He contends that, in spite of the fact that
Major Long, who is making the contracts
for the Government for army garments,
declares that he knows nothing about
Chinese being employed on this class of
work, thousands of uniforms are
being made by Mongolian labor. Yester
day he wrote a letter to A. A. Watklns
of the City Board of Trade, in which he
recited the condition of affairs from his
standpoint, and in conclusion made the
following proposition:
"As an adjustment of the entire
! matter I have the following proposition
â  to make:
"I will, upon having copies of all con
tracts now in existence or those to be
made, undertake to locate the firms guil
ty of sending the work to Chinatown, and
so hopeful do I feel of being able to drive
the work out of Chinatown that I will
have no word of censure for any one and
accept this responsibility personally.
"My position In this matter has been
that of an official performing my official
I duties, and in doing so certain facts have
been revealed which have reflected dis
credit upon the parties to the beforemen
tloned contracts. I. therefore, as a citi
zen and official, desire to proffer my as
sistance in remedying the unfortunate
state of affairs to the mutual benefit of
the War Department, the merchants and
the working people of San Francisco.
"Awaiting your reply I have the honor
to remain your obedient servant,
"E. L. FITZGERALD,
"Labor Commissioner.**

DECLINE TO
HELP ROETH
Harwood Creek Figures
in a Political Deal.
FOUR MUTE SUPERVISORS
NO SECOND TO A MOTION TO
SETTLE THE MATTER.
The Supervisor of the Fourth Ward
Realizes That His Brethren
Have Quite Lengthy-
Memories.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 28.
"U'hereas, There appears to be a
question whether the exclusivs
right to use the water of Harwood
Creek is owned by any party or
parties, therefore be It
Resolved, That the Supervisor
from the Fourth District be direct
ed to discontinue using the waters
of said creek for sprinkling pur
poses, and it is further
Resolved, That all action hereto
fore taken by this Board concern-
Ing the ownership of the waters of
said Harwood Creek, and particu
larly a certain resolution recorded
in volume 22 of the minutes of fhls
board be hereby rescinded,
000000000000000
When Clerk Jordan had finished read- i
ing the above resolution at the meeting of
Supervisors late this afternoon, Supervis
or Roeth moved Its adoption.
Messrs. Church, Talcott. Mitchell and
Wells preserved unbroken silence.
"Any second to the motion?" asked
Chairman Talcott. No one spoke.
"I want to see this passed. Mr. Chair
man, because I do not want it to be a
personal matter between me and the own
ers of the property in the vicinity of the
creek," said Mr. Roeth.
No one Beemed to carÂ© whether it was
or will be a "personal" matter for Mr.
Roeth or not, and without further ado
the board adjourned. This action in a
measure shows that the feeling engen
dered by Mr. Roeth against his four
brethren over a year ago still exists. The
raw over the waters of Harwood Creek
commenced several weeks ago when the
Supervisors passed a resolution practical
ly acknowledging the rights of the prop
erty owners in the premises and yielding
any alleged right the county might have.
Since then w. W. Foote, Judge Garber
and others have appeared before the
board and have taken issue with Mr.
Roeth, and next Monday it la probable
that Mr. Roeth and Mr. Foote â will meet
again in the board room. This much was
stated by Mr. Church this afternoon.
There is politics in the waters of Har
wood Creek, and in the Supervisors' dec
lination to help Mr. Roeth out of his lit
tle difficulty. For over two years Mr.
Roeth at the instigation of a certain ele
ment "did politics at the expense of the
other four members of the board. He
criticized them through the press and at
tempted to build himself up by their al
leged failures to stand by "the people."
During the past few months things have
changed, and the same element in politics
that used Mr. Roeth to club the other
four members of the board has now
switched around and finds it convenient
to seek the support of Messrs. Talcott
Church and Mitchell for its new pro
gramme. Consequently with that consist
ent ingratitude typical of machine poll
tics, Mr. Roeth muÃt "go it alone" and his
discomfiture is rather appreciated by the
members he was once useful in opposing.

payment of a bill amounting to $6 Jan
sen seized a hatchet and Markolovltz beat
a retreat. Markolovitz returned Jn the
afternoon and threatened to have Jansen
arrested if he did not pay the bill The
threat was too much for Jansen and seiz
ing a large butcher knife he chased Mar
kolovitz Into the street, vociferating that
he would kill him. Judge Mogan was
holding court yesterday afternoon when
Markolovitz appeared in an excited con
dition and asked for a warrant for Jan
sen's arrest on the charge of assault to
murder. He detailed the circumstances
and the warrant was issued. Jansen was
arrested and booked at the City Prison
He is a man 77 years of age, and is
inclined to look upon the affair as a eood
Joke.
FINDS DEATH IN THE PARK
Thomas Boyle, a Royal Arch. Mason,
Commits Suicide â Takes the
Poison Route.
The body of Thomas Boyle was found
in Golden Gate Park, near the aviary
yesterday morning, death having oc
curred not much earlier than the even
ing previous. An empty phial was found
near at hand. Papers in possession of the
deceased showed that he was made a
Royal Arch Mason in Hamilton, Canada
in ISB6. It appeared that he was a steam
fitter and plumber, had traveled exten
sively, and had worked for five years In
Chicago.
An autopsy by Chemist Morgan led him
to the lmprÂ«Â«Â«Â«<Â»o â¦Â»Â»â¢< dÂ«Â«Â»th was due to
Dolson.
CAST ON HER
BEAM ENDS
Narrow Escape of the
Ship Othmarschen.
HER CARGO WAS DAMAGED
LOST SAILS AND BOATS IN A
HURRICANE.
A Big Raft Containing Five Million
and a Quarter Feet of Cut Lum
ber Expected Here Next
Friday.
The German ship Othmarsehpn whi^h
left here last March with a valuable cargo
of wheat for Cape Town had a hard time
of it reaching her destination. She was
caught In a gale off the Horn, lost the
greater part of three suits of sails, the
cargo shifted and the vessel was thrown
on her beam ends. Heavy seas washed
everything movable on deck overboard,
the main hatch was smashed and the cab
in and deck houses suffered.
In a private letter received yesterday
Captain Salzer says: "Arrived off Cape
Horn 44 days out. When in latitude 4S
south, longitude 42 west, the barometer
fell In twelve hours from 29.20 to 2,8.23. I
at once shortened sail and soon had the
vessel under lower topsails and foretop
mast staysail. Early next morning we en
countered a hurricane with a nasty sea
and the fore lower topsail and foretop
mast staysail blew out of the bolt ropes.
The bhip luffed up In the wind, although
the rudder was hard over, the cargo shift
ed and the vessel went over on her beam
ends. Heavy sea.s broke on board from thu
let-ward and everything movable on deck
was washed overboard. The main hatcn
was mashed in and the cargo damaged.
The doors of the cabin, forecastle and gal
ley were smashed in and all three places
gutted."
After considerable trouble the Othmar
schen was got on an even keel and then
Captain Salzer goes on to say:
"At 4:15 a. m. the mizzen lower topsail
Llew out of the bolt ropes and a number,
of other sails blew out of the gaskets. One
boat was carried away and the others
badly damaged. The Othmarschen had
three suits of sails on board, but when
the storm was over the mainmast was the
only stick that had a full suit from main
sail to royal. When 67 days out we were
only 14 miles from Cape Town."
It was very exasperating, but It toon
Captain Salzor seven days to make his
vessel cover that distance.
The Othmarschen is a fine ship of 1792
tons burden and was loaded here by Cot
ton, Bell & Co. From Cape Town she will
probably go to Newcastle, N. S. W., In
ballast and come here with a load of coal.
Officer J. W. Mackey of the Harbor Po
lice had a rough time of it on East street
last Monday night. As a result he is not
in the best of condition to-day, but one of
his assailants had to be "fixed up" by Dr.
Deas in the Harbor Receiving Hospital.
Near midnight Monday Mackey was pass-
Ing a saloon on East, near Jackson, when
the proprietor asked him to put a man
named Harry Know! ton, who was creat
ing a disturbance, out. Mackey went up
to the fellow and said, "Here, my good
man, you had better go home."
For reply the "good man" cauerht the
officer a swinging blow on the necK ana
knocked him into a corner. Maoiwy got
on his feet as quickly as possible, only to
be sent to the floor again with a straight
punch on the nose. The next time he got
on his feet he had his club li hl3 hand
and Knowlton got a blow on the head
from it that laid his scalp open. Nothing
daunted he went for the officer again and
in trite of another crack from the c?ub
he caught Mackey under the chin and
knocked him over the stove and near.'y
out.
The pbJ fin- an was gaiie as a pebMe,
however, and in a few seconds he returnee)
to the attack. In the meantime Knowlton
had been reinforced by toti-<? liremen
from Eioadway >vharf ami tney had got
i Mackay under a table and were proceed
ing to kick his brains out when a squad
of police summoned by the saloon man
i was heard coming along East street on
the run. The firemen decamped, but
i Mackey held on to Knowlton and finally
landed him In the Harbor Police Station.
He was charged with battery and resist
ing an officer and was then removed to
the Harbor Receiving Hospital.
The big lumber raft which left the Co
lumbia River on the evening of the 24th
instant is expected here next Friday, ana
if ail goes well it will be docked at Sec
tion A of the sea wall and will be unload
ed the same as a lumber vessel. The raft
has 5,250,000 feet of cut lumber in Its mako
up, and should it get here all right the
Harbor Commissioners should be able to
get all of the article they want at consid
erably less than the $14 50 a thousand
asked by the Pacific Pine Lumber Com
pany. The raft is In tow of the tugs Res
cue and Monarch and is coming down at
the rate of four miles an hour. The wind
has been light from the northwest with a
smooth sea for the last couple of days,
and an the barometer is steadily rising
everything points to the arrival of the big
raft next Friday.
IS STILL A MARRIED MAN.
Application of Louis James Frederik-
sen for a Divorce Denied.
Louis James Frederiksen, contrary to
his most ardent expectations and wishes,
is still a married man. Some time ago
Frederiksen applied for a divorce from his
wife, Delia Frederiksen, on the ground of
desertion. The defendant allowed the stat
utory time to expire before filing a con
test to her husband's application for di
vorce and her default was entered. La
ter, however, an apllcatlon was made to
set aside and vacate the entry of default,
which was granted. The case came up'foi
hearing* yesterday and Mrs. Frederlksen
produced evidence establishing her con
tention that she alone was not responsible
for the separation of herself and husbanrt.
A letter from Frederiksen to his wife,
which stated that the writer was of the
opinion that he could not live happily
with her. was admitted as evidence and on
this showing the court refused to grant
the plaintiff a divorce. In view of the fact
that Frederiksen and his wife are not lia
ble to live together the court granted the
custody of the minor children of the liti
gants to the plaintiff, as ho waa better
able to care for them than the defendant.
WANTED FOR ROBjBERY.
The Police Searching for Bandsman
Burke of the Montana Regiment.
John Evans, the prospector from Mon
tana who was robbed by Bandsman
Burke of the Montana regiment early
Monday morning in a dive on Kearny
street, swore to a complaint in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday for Burkes arrest.
Captain Dillon and two privates of the
regiment have been searching the city for
Burke but have been unable to find him.
Now the police will assist in the search,
and unless Burke has left the city his ar
rest is certain. Evans feels Bur>ke's in
gratitude more than the lobs of his money.

Progression In the real estate market is
Etill exceedingly slow with absolutely not
the slightest prospect for improvement in

The lapse of a week has done little, if
anything, toward improving its character

bo a reality. The only department that
seems to have any indication or Bem
blance of life, whatever, is the building.
Numerous contracts were awarded during
the past week, many of them involving v.
larger value than the usual.
The number of large mortgages is still
on the increase, the record of the past,
week involving an aggregate of nearly
$30u,000, while the number of releases and

smaller.

WILL SHARKEY
FIGHT CLEAN?
The Sailor Meets Ruhlin
To-Morrow Night.
BETTING AT CORBETT'S PLACE
: BLOW THAT LOST McKEEVER
HIS LAST BATTLE.
Union Coursing Park Will Give
a Three Days' Meeting
Commencing on.
Saturday.
Ruhlln and Sharkey will meet to
morrow evening in a contest of twenty
five rounds before the New York Ath
letic Club. The betting in Corbett's on
the result is quite spirited. Sharkey is
a favorite at 2 to 1, and even money is
offered that the fight will be finished
inside of sixteen rounds. Notwithstand
ing that the gamblers are playiijj
Sharkey to win there are quite a num j
ber of clear-thinking sports who are i
of the opinion that the contest will last
until the limit is reached anl that
Ruhlin will get the decision on points.
They argue that Ruhlin's straight left
hand punches will get the sailor wild
and that Sharkey will swing recklessly
at his opponent and commit mai:y
fouls. It would not surprise thousands
of people here if the wires conveyed
the news of Sharkey's early defeat be
cause of foul fighting and police inter
ference.
The boxers who will entertain mem
bers of the Manhattan Club to-morrcw
evening are Jimmy Anthony, "Kid"
Renlck, "Kid" McFadden, Lon Agnew,
Bud Terry and others of less note. A
first-class evening's sport is promised
the lovers of the pastime.
The Alpine Athletic Club has an ex
cellent card for its next entertainment,
which will be held on July 11. The hard
punching Jack Granfield will meet the
clever Billy Otts in an eight-round con
test, and Jimmy Riley and R. Gross
man of San Rafael will punch for six
rounds unless a knock-out decides the
bout before the final is reached.
In answer to a question regarding
the blow which put Charley McKeever
t<> sleep: It was as clean a cross-coun
ter as ever a pugilist delivered, and Mc-
Keever fell toward his opponent and
not from him, as erroneously stated in
a report. No such thing occurred as a
left or right hand stop. When Mc-
Keever recovered his pins after receiv
ing the blow on the mouthâ and not on
the jaw â he staggered in the direction
of his corner, but was knocked down a
second time by a righthand punch on
the neck. The pictorial sketch which
appeared in a morning paper was en
tirely wrong in its representation.
Morris Jacobs, "the strong boy," is in
the city and is anxious to meet any
126 or 130 pound man in the State in a
boxing or wrestling match or in feats
of strength.
A horse-shoeing contest, open to the
State, will be held at Central Park in
July under the auspices of the Mechan
ics' Athletic Club, recently organized.
Valuable prizes will be offered for com
petition.
The coursing fraternity can look for
ward to exceptionably fine sport at
Union Park on July 2, 3 and 4. In the
open stake $SOO will be added by the
park managers. The great and only
For Freedom will again be seen con
testing for the long end of the green,
but there are rumors afloat that J. R.
Smith's Eastern dog which recently
arrived may give the great English
sprinter a hard rub. Dogs that will be
sent to their kennels on the first day
minus a flag will have an opportunity
of redeeming themselves if entered for
the consolation stake, which will be
run on America's great holiday, when
the finishes of the open stake will be
decided.
GROCERS WHO SELL
COTTONSEED OIL
A NUMBER OF ARRESTS ABOUT
TO BE MADE.
The Milkmen Have Not Been Forgot
ten and a Batch of Warrants
Is About to Be Issued.
Although there are still some points In
the pure food law to be decided by the
Supreme Court, the Health Department
has decided to go right ahead and make
arrests wherever adulterated products
can be found. Accordingly Inspector
Dockery has kept himself busy looking- for
violations of the law, and violators nave
kept themselves just about as busy get
ting out of his way.
As a result of his energies he has pro
cured a number of samples of something
which has been freely sold for olive oil,
but which, it is alleged, is nothing more
or less than cottonseed oil, and accord
ingly a number of arrests will be made
to-day. Those charged with handling the
impure product are Bernard F. Bruse,
1061 Golden Gate avenue; E. W. Buck.
Hayes and Gough; J. J. Carroll, Fell and
Webster: J. J. Moran. 2931 Sixteenth; J.
Howe, 3999 Seventeenth street; Sand beck &
Sverdrup, 1001 Larkin; Paul Krebs, 2300
Sutter, and Schmidt & Stolrnan, IGOI Fol
som street. As soon as these cases are
disposed of a number of merchants will
be arrested charged with handling impure
pepper and adulterated vinegar.
While the grocers have been taken care
of the milkmen have not been neglected,
and warrants have been issued for the
arrests of A. J. Brandsehnede. 2559 Twen
ty-sixth street; N. Coleman, China avenue
and Naples street; A. Danwood, 118 Rus

NEW YORK, June 28.â 1f ever two
boxers were flt to furnish a fast and
clever battle they are Tom Sharkey,
the sailor, and Gus Ruhlin, the Akron
giant, who are to meet in a twenty
five round bout at the Greaer New
York Athletic Club at Coney Island _-
T~\~ night. From the moment the
match was arranged, which was over
three weeks ago, until the present
time, both men have been training con
scientiously for the bout, and they will
enter the ring in as good condition as
they ever did before.
Sharkey has been doing his work at
New Dorp, Staten Island, with the as
sistance of Steve O'Donnell and Spider
Kelly and Tim McGrath of San Fran
cisco, and as the trio have given him
the best of attention he has been able
to get himself into excellent condition.
Sharkey la confident of winning and
expects to beat Ruhlin in less than fif
teen rounds. He will enter the ring
weighing about 182 pounds.
Ruhlin, who has been getting himself
into shape at Mechanicsville, Pa., un
der the direction of Billy Madden, his
manager, is, according to Madden, in
much better shape for this bout than
he was when he met Kid McCoy a few
weeks ago.
The winner, it la said, will be
matched with Jeffries.

TOOLEY STREET
TAILORS PLAN
TO RUN THINGS
"Buggy-Robe" Braunhart Up
holds Them in Their Dis
like of Primaries.
Precious Material That Has Found Its Way
Into the Committee of One Hundred
for Distribution of Gold Bricks.
The three tailors of Tooley street
have decided to dispense with all pri
maries. Their first move was to con
stitute themselves the Democratic
party, their second to conclude that the
people were not to be trusted. There
Is nothing surprising in this. Misfit
tailors never trust anybody. Spot cash
is their rule.
The formal verdict was reached at a
secret meeting. Samuel Lexow Braun
hart was there, his presence lending a
moral tone to proceedings. HtÂ» is by
profession a reformer, making a spec
ialty of isinglass tickets, and his fame
Is linked with the memory Of a buggy
robe. Indeed the Irreverent have gone
po far as to term him "Buggy-robe
Braunhart." a designation which fails
to soothe hi? savage breast. Whisper-
Ing Gavin McNab, the boss tailor, was
there and agreed with his good friend.
McNab has viewed the primary as a
wicked device ever since the theft of
the 20-foot ladders leading to the loft
where he once conducted â with telling
effect â a reform primary of his own.
This peculation left him in the air,
much embarrassed. The primary oc
curred in the Forty -fifth District in
1892 and was a. fine specimen of the re
form article.
Tailor Frank "Hood" Gould has been
Informed that Sherwood forest tactics,
including the sand-bag, will not be
countenanced in this city. William
"Hallucination" Alford, humblest of the
trio, has retired to Tulare to saw wood.
Braunhart's opposition to primaries
comes from a settled conviction as to
the wisdom of holding four aces, with
the fifth up his sleeve. The committee
of one hundred is composed largely of
gold men. Maguire is a siiverite and
is said to be in favor <>f holding pri
maries. Such is their anxiety to show
how they love him that they propose to
present him a gold brick in the shape
of a lead-pipe cinch delegation ap
pointed by themselves. Braunhart is
with them. He is one of the most frag
rant beauty roses which ever sprang
from the sand lot and flourished under
the fostering car.- of the lamented
Denis Kearney. Ho is an inveterate Job
chaser, and occasionally catches his
prey. Elected to the Legislature In
1880, his first work in the interest of
good government and reform was a
vote for Increasing the expenditures of
the City and County Clerk $54,000 per
annum. He received as a reward for
this treachery two appointments from
the clerk, who afterward became a
defaulter.
In 1896 Braunhart appeared once more
on the stage in the role of reformer.
The little port warden who after three
years on the water front still called j
the hold of a ship the "cellar" and the
deck the "ground floor" lost no time
in voting to Increase the expenditures
of the fire department and police $60,000
per annum. This was In spite of de
pressed times and a pledge he had
given to promote economy. For this
second notable lapse from virtue he
w;ik criven one appointment on the po
lire force. He has received four ap
pointments on the fire department and
his howl for more is heard in the land.
There is hardly a position short of the
Presidency to which this insatiate ap
petite has not reached out with yearn
ing. After the election of Orover Cleve
land he sought to be Consul to Posen,
his native city, he being the original
Sam'l of J'oson; Consul to Breslau. his
adopted city; Appraiser of Merchandise
at this point, and it is rumored pork
Inspector for Jerusalem. But the mem
ory of the isinglass tickets barred his
way to soft snaps. Undismayed, he
became a candidate for the State Board
of Equalization. Registrar <>f Voters,
and finally fell into a port wardenship,
although he did not know the stern of
a ship from the stem. In 1896 he want
ed the nomination for State Senator,
and got it by marching his pang into
Odd Fellows' Hall .-it. midnight. This
was a delicate feat, but he accom
plished it, standing off the janitor for
$r> rent demanded, and later inducing
the secretary to advance the sum.
Tt would be impossible to corrvipt
him, he having all the immunity hedg
ing about the integrity of a decayed
egg. Hp does not like "wulgar bosses."
"I don't do no business wid a big farm- j
er from Warm Jnrings," he explains. '
"I do it wid his lieutenants."
To satisfy the cormorant and enlist '
him under their snotless banner, the
three tailors have promised to give him
a lease of the peanut stand In the City
Hall. They exact the hard condition
that no frozen orfinges soaked In hot ]
Water ore to be exposed for sale. Halo, I
tlves of the tailoring triumvirate are
expected after January next to occupy
all the positions at '.ie City Hall, and
they must be guarded against colicky
pangs. It is stated that Whispering
McNab has reluctantly consented to
have stipulated in the lease that no
Chinese made cigars shall be sold un
der a white labor brai d. This grinds
McNab. The quality >f labor known
as "scab*.' is dear to his little soul..
Of course it Is no discredit to a man
to have been a peddler in his youth,
particularly as his Honor the Mayor
claims to be one vet. And Mr. Phelan
has done much for th" world not nnly
of politics but of science. To the process
of curing by laying on of hands he has
ndded that of counting money by the
method of- "hefting." The money was
not there, but he hefted it just as con
scientiously. During his campaign
when Phelan was addressing the Ped
dlers' Association he said "we are all
peddlers after a fashion." and that he
was peddling his personality in ex
change for votes. If Phelan, "the pam
pered child of fortune," is a huckster,
then Braunhart selling peanuts to the
passing politicians need feel no sense
of shame.
A veritable heliotrope from the Kear
ney sand lot garden has climbed over
the wall and is now on the immortal
committee of one hundred. This is
Thomas Janus Pinder. He, like the
god of old, has a faculty for looking
two ways at once, being equipped with
two faces for the purpose. The believer
in reincarnation would naturally sup
pose that in some former existence
Pinder had been an cci. He can wrig
gle out of any tight place. He used
to attend a series of good government
lectures delivered by a certain divine
Friday evenings, and next morning
would be at the St. George stables dis
cussing projects with the big farmer
from Warm Springs. He signed tho
call and attended the meeting which re
sulted in the election of Major Harney
and then wont to smoke the pine of
peace in tho wigwam of reformer Maxi
milian Parkhurst Popper. He would
not attend the first meeting of the State
General Committee because he had
friends on both sides. He sits on the
fence until the lnst moment and then
makes a jump, invariably alighting on
his feet in the band wagon, and then
announces that he has been there all
the time. He was given by the last
Democratic Convention a "compli
mentary" vote for Recorder, and is
now a oanu.Jate before the Tooley
street committee for the same office.
He will. no d'>ubt receive the "com
plimentary" vote of the people on No
vember next. He is always a candidate
for office and just now has at least one
cf his faces upon the Recordership. His
abilities as a financier mark him as no
ordinary man. In 1886 he was elected
to the Senate from this city and by
frugality and perservanoe was able to
save from- his salary of $8 per day for
sixty days enough to buy a farm which
he still has. When n^xt the Mayor
shall have occasion to name a mid
night Board of Supervisors he should
not overlook Pinder. Chlmmie Fadden
would have called Pinder a peach. If
he were to apply himself to city affairs
as diligently as he did to his own when
in the Senate he ought to be equal to
the task of running the city upon a 50
cent limit and have money to devote to
charity at the. end of the fiscal year.
A BUSY CORONER.
Mrs. Angelo Ghio's Death From an
Amputation â A Supposed
Suicide Found.
An unknown man was brought to the
Morgue yesterday from a lodging-house
at 14S Sixth street. The body was discov
ered by the chambermaid lying face down
on the carpet near the window, as though
the deceased had attempted to pet some
fresh air. A box containing a few mor
phine pills was in the room and some of
the pills had been used. The deceased
rented the room on the evening previous
and said that he had come from T^os An
geles. He seemed to be In the last stages
of asthma and had come to San Francis
co to be cured. He did not give his nanv 1 .
The deceased was between 45 and 50 years
old, had bine eyes and sandy hair and
mustache, and wore a gray suit with
large block checks.
The Coroner was notified yesterday
that Mrs. Ansrelo Ghio, a native of Italy,
had died from the effects of an amputa
tion of one of her arms at the German
Hospital. She fell downstairs In the
house 915 Battery street and broke an
arm on the nth of the present month. An
inquest was waived.

SNUFFS THE BATTLE FROM AFAR.
District Attorney Barnes, Who Has Accepted the Cap 3
iaincy of a Fifth Regiment Company.
"Top, I have accepted the appointment as captain of Company C of tho
Fifth Kegiment," said District Attorney William S. Barnes yesterday even
ing. "I have had the commission at my disposal for BOine time, but at
the suggestion of Governor Budd I have not made a public announcement
of my intentions until to-day. The regiment of which I expect to be cap
tain is the volunteers from Petaluma, and it was my good fortune that
there was a vacancy. Of course, I am not a captain in the United States
service yet, but I have passed the examination of the military board suc
cessfully. I cannot be de facto captain of the regiment until it has been
mustered into the service. I will be prepared to take command of the
company when it arrives on Thursday on its way to Camp Barrett at
Fruitvale, Alameda County.
"I have entered the service not with the idea of guarding a powder
mill at Santa Cruz or protecting babies at Monterey, but with the earnest
hope of seeing service at the front. Should my company be detailed on
home duty I would infinitely prefer to be a civilian District Attorney rather
than a stay-at-home captain of volunteers.
"I am really glad that the matter has been decided, and I breathe a
freer air now that my mind is at rest.
"Of course, I know that my legal friends and enemies will endeavor to
have some fun at my expense, to all of which I bid them welcome. For
their benefit I will say that so far as the captain of Company C is con
cerned the nolle pros will be held in abeyance With the Spanish troops.
The only writ that will be issued from headquarters will be that of capias.
Further, the captain is glad to at .east temporarily abandon the technical
ities of the law for tho generalities of a S( . lltr y- s bayonet."
"How about the District Attorneyahip?" was asked.
"As to the District Attorney's office I am not prepared to say definitely
â¢what I will do. I am now on my regular vacation, which lasts four weeks.
At the expiration of that period I will decide whether I will ask for a
leave of absence or resign. "While I am in the State and in the camp of in
struction I will still be District Attorney in law and fact. My further ar
rangements will depend upon the destination of my regiment.
"I have one parting comment to make. I have been deeply studying
this Span'sh war question and find that the enemy has rapid-fire guns
that successfully cover eleven inches of space at 1000 yards. So far I have
found no scheme by which I can get between those infernal bullets."
As Captain Barnes weighs nearly 300 pounds the seriousness of this
problem can be appreciated.
THROWN IN PRISON
WITHOUT CAUSE
TJNWAKRANTED ARREST *BY A
SPECIAL OFFICER.
Hugh Friel Charged With Burglary
Because He Happened to
Be in an Old
Foundry.
What appears to be a most unwarrant
ed arrest was made by Special Officer
R. A. Sample on Monday evening, and It
will probably result In his star being
taken from him.
Hugh Friel. a boy 14 years of ape. living
I at 32 Te-hama street, had been working on
the collier Centennial Sunday and Mon
day, and w:is on his way homo Momliiy
I evening, when he had occasion to go into
j the old Enterprise foundry on Folsom
street. While there Sample pounced
upon him. and with the remark, "Now
I've got you!" struck the boy three or
j four times with his fist, finishing up by
; sending him to the City Prison on a
I charge of burglary.
The boy, who was as grimy looking an
object as could be imagined, remained in
I the prison all night, and appeared in
i Judge Conlan's court yesterday morning.
When the case was called Sample told
Prosecuting Attorney Cavigao that he
would require to see another officer, and
asked that the case be continued till to
morrow, which was done.
Later the Judge heard the boy's story
and released him on his own recogni
zance. The boy had been paid $2 50 for his
two days' work on the Centennial, and
had the money In his pocket, which he
was taking home to his mother when ar
rested. It was about the first, money he
had earned. His mother was in court.
! and was heartbroken at such a charge
1 being made against her offspring.

THROWN OUT OF HER HOME.
An Old Woman of Pioneer Days Is
Ejected by the Law's Mandate.
The sympathies of Sheriff Whelan were
enlisted a few days ago when he was
called upon to dispossess an old woman,
named Catherine Conlan, who is now In
her eighty-fifth year, and who has been
living in the house at 23 Sherwood plaÂ«e
for the past forty-five years.
This aged woman, who is now an ln
{ competent person and haMlng as her
I guardian her son-in-law, Harry Lang
; Hhaw, settled in Sherwood place at a time
: when Third street only extended as far as
Hunt street, and when all that portion of
south of Market was a sand heap and the
home of the wandering Sydney Ducks,
who camped where the Palace Hotel now
stands. During the past ten years Mrs.
Conlan had neglected to pay the taxes on
her little 17x55 homestead, and as a re
sult the property was sold for taxes. The
purchaser was Jake Raver, who not wish
ing to throw the poor old woman out of
I the house which she had so long resided
;in made her his tenant in November,
1 18S)o. and gave her a lease of the place,
i rent free, for the period of one year. At
I the expiration of that time the woman
became childish, and it was necessary to
appoint a guardian to represent her, as
well as to look out for her comfort. This
duty was accepted by her son-in-law,
Harry Langshaw. who with his ward re
sided on the premises aa long as they
were not disturbed by their landlord.
Raver finally secured a writ of ejectment,
but the sympathies of the Sheriff were
wrought up to their highest pitch, and ho
tried to have the old woman removed to
the Sisters' Home. So far his efforts have
proved barren of results, as she refuses
to leave the house that she occupied so
long, and the one that she still maintains
she baa a right to. Nevertheless, the
Sheriff's deputies will be compelled to re
move her and her belongings to-day and
give possession of the premises to Rn.uer.
When spoken to yesterday by a Call
representative Mrs. Conlan was as happy
as a child with a new doll. She said she
intended to marry just as soon as the
right man came along. Four of her grand
children are inmates of the Catholic Or
phan Asylum, and all of her own family
have long since passed away.
RAILROAD VALUES.
Testimony as to the Cost and Value
of the Southern j. acific.
The examination of W. O. Curtis, civil
engineer and witness for the Southern Pa
cific Company, in its injunction suit
against the Railroad Commissioners, was
resumed before United States Court Com
missioner lleacock yesterday. J. H. Polk,
the expert of the Railroad Commissioners,
was present and a very attentive listener
to the proceeding's. Mr. Curtis' testimony
was confined to showing the expense of
maintaining the company's properties ana
estimating values. Speaking of expense,
he said the growing business required
more f<>rry boats, and the purchase of
faster locomotives to satisfy the demands
of shippers for greater speed in the de
livery of merchandise and goods liable to
spoil in transit. The witness then told ot
the economic saving of ties and other
timbers used along the railroad by apply
ing a solution of chloride of zinc whicn
prevented decay and destruction, the re
sult being to prolong their services Indefi
nitely.
Referring to the replacing of the walls
of the snowsheds with.masonry, Mr. Cur
tis st;iti-d that it was an act of economy
as the wnlls thus constructk-d will stand
against avalanches or almost any great
pressure. The expenditure of $220 per mile
on tli i s work he considered money saved.
In reply to a question by Mr. Herrin, wit
ness stated that he regarded the extra
cost of building a road through mountain
regions (3060 pet n-.ile. or a total for this
class of work In California of $9,640,000.
That is if another company should paral
lel the present lines of the Southern Pa
cific Company. In the matter of bridge
building he said that the roads crossed
the Sacramento River sixteen times and
the Soledad Canyon eight times. Mr. Cui
tis could not say what the property would
bring at a forced sale, but he thought it
would have a value of $6,250,000 to the
State. He would advise a purchaser to
pay $2000 per mile more for the road ra
ther than build a new one.
Among the items of expense enumerated
by the witness was that of fuel, which he
Faid was enormous as compared with
companies located where coal was easy
of acefss and cheap.
Mr. Curtis will continue his testimony
on the same lines to-day.
Dr. Kienborts Insane.
Dr. Klenborts. a physician residing at
30% Twenty-eighth street, was committed
to the asylum for the Insane at Ukiah by
the Insanity Commissioners yesterday;
The physician is a veteran of the civil
war. Of late he has acted so strangely
that his wife was forced to have him ar
rested. He was examined yesterday morn
ing and pronounced insane and committed
to thjj.^aylum.
BROKE DRIVER
MABEN'S WRIST
Double Runaway at the
Trotting- Meet.
SOME FIGHTING FINISHES
â¦
GOOD SPOftT AT OAKLAND RACE
TRACK.
Dictatress, William Baker, Clay S,
Little Thorn and Rect Win
Their Respective
Races.
It was almost a perfect race day at
Oakland yesterday, very little wind blow-
Ing and the track being at its best, the
time was fast. An audience numbering
well above a thousand turned out, and
what with several fighting finishes and a
lively runaway passed an afternoon teem
ing with excitement.
Favorites were bowled over with charm
ing regularity. The fields were hard to
get away in two of the events, and it
kept the talent guessing quite as
much as with the runners. Dic
tntress. a ]5 to 1 shot, led off
with a victory, aided possibly by a double
runaway, in which Primrose unseated
Thompson near the half, and Gaff Topsail,
in avoiding the wreck, swerved into
Polo"s sulky, throwing Walter Maben,
breaking the popular Los Angeleno's wrist.
With two driverless horses in the field it
was a moment of intense excitement, and
several drivers kept aloof, thus leaving
the leaders an uncontested pathway,
rather than take further chances.
DJctatress is a daughter of Dlctatus,
and few thought she stood a chance for
show money even, she was so unsteady
scoring. Once away, however, she led
them a merry chase, reeling off the first
quarter in :31%, a 2:07 clip, and to the
half in 1:06, which showed her capacity.
Lady Margaret, second enoice in the bet
ting, landed place honors, I Direct, the
favorite, being third. He was heavily
backed at 7 to 10 by the wise, because of
his Saturday victory. Primrose was read
ily captured, but Polo escaped and ran
a second mile ere his capture. Maben is
peculiarly unfortunate, this being his sec
ond serious accident of late years, each
occurring as he was about to begin a cam
paign with a seemingly strong stable.
William Baker, nominated by the In
jured reinsman, won the 2:19 pace, driven
by Jimmy Sullivan, beating Dictatus and
Fitz Aymon with ease, in 2:18*4, and the
Fitz Aymoners who went down were nu
merous. The winner's price was 2 to 1.
There were eight 2:17 trotters to answer
Starter Havey's bell, and a more un
steady pole horse than George Washing
ton it would be hard to locate. The thir
teenth attempt "Dick" got a splendid hne
up. and away they went. So did the Our
Jack money, fur he was even-money fa
vorite and landed sixth. That big strider
<"lny S, 10 to 1, won in a rattling drive
with Washington, in 2:14. the Vallejo
horse but a length behind, both under a
stiff application of the whalebone. May
H had little to beat to show and did the
act very neatly.
The 2:12 pacers were held closer by the
poncllers, Plunkett at 6 to 1 being the long
est price quoted. Little Thorn was at 4 to
5 and won it after being kept under cover
to the far turn. Here he paced rings
round the bunch and jogged in from thÂ«
drawgate at the paddock in 2:l3Vi. He is a
handsome, splendidly behaved little tiorse
and it Is a relief to see one occasionally
wearing as few boots as does he in theso
days of hoppled sidewheelers. Hijo del
Diablo got place honors after a redhoi
skirmish with Ketchum and they had to
take a whole lot of "persuasion" the
length of the homestretch. It was a fin
ish which "brought the stand to Its feet,"
to use running terms.
Reot. C. L. Griffith's fast 4-year-old, by
Direct, was once again favorite in the
heat raceâ the 2:40 trotâ and form players
had him rated aright for he toyed with
his field aiul took the race at his ease in
2:l6Va and 2:1&% without being all out at
any part of the route. He was 2 and 3 to
1 and nevor made a mistake. Saturday's
race did him a world of benefit and the
end is not yet. He will surely trot in 2:12,
barring accidents, and may be still an
other phenomenon to the credit of Califor
nia, having extreme speed together wit!i
a frictionlt-ss gait and is bred in the pur-
Ele. Mamie Riley, second choice in the
etting, seemed a good thing for place
honors, bur. after trotting second the
opening heat lost the money to Dexter I>,
the second because of a disastrous break.
She secured second money, however, and
Dexter D third. The latter will bear
watching with Rect out of his way in the
slow rtawwwi. Favor, Saturday's winner,
was "off" badly and unsteady,' going into
a pace at times. He was away behind tho
money, losing his party not a little money.
Lustrine, Pearl X and Ed Winship werw
outclassed the 2:16% heat, all being dis
tanced.
Mr. Havey's starting was, with a single
send off, exceptionally tine and the only
drawbacks to an afternoon of unsurpassed
pleasure were the regrettable accident
above mentioned and the wait between
heats of the 2:40 trot, which should have
been moved up so as to alternate with a
dash event. The racing improves daily
as the drivers are out for the money ana
realize that to get it they must go right
to work when the word "go" is sounded
and keep near the front.
Records are bound to tumble and the
betting affords quite the Infatuation ap
parently that "playing the runners" af
fords. People should remember that rac
ing begins promptly at 1:30 and that ths
best horses on the coast are engaged each
day. The summaries:

RAILROAD RESPONSIBLE.
Motormen's Duty Defined in a Decis
ion Handed Down by Judge Hunt.
That It is as much a duty on the part of
motormen and grlpmen on the various
street car lines to lend their aid to pro- I
tect pedestrians as It is the pedestrian's j
duty to protect himself was determined j
yesterday in a decision handed down in j
the case of William M. Lee against the
MarlÃt Street Railway Company by
Judge Hunt. The decision was rendered
denying a motion for a new trial which,
was requested by the railway company
and Is as follows:
William ' M. Lee, the plaintiff In this case,
was run over by one of the Kearny-street
electric cars, and his Injuries necessitated the
amputation of his leg. Upon the trial he re
covered a verdict for $5000 damages; the de
fendant moved for a new trial upon various
grounds but . mainly upon the ground that
the plaintiff's negligence directly contributed to
and was the cause of his Injury.
After a careful reading of the statement on
motion for a new trial, ' I find that the evi
dence preponderates In favor of defendant's
claim that plaintiff did not exercise ordinary
care In attempting to cross the track, because
he failed to look or listen for the approaching
car. But the evidence also shows that, upon
the night in question, the running of defend
ant's Kearny-street cars had been temporarily
obstructed by a procession on Market street,
that as the car came along Kearny street. It
was running at, what some of the 'witnesses
termed a "terrific"' rate of speed, far in ex
cess of the lawful rate of eight miles per
hour; and that the motorman made no effort
whatever to slacken the speed, or stop the car
when it approached - the plaintiff, although
warned by a passenger of the impending dan
ger. â â ..-, -
It must or should have been apparent to the
motorman before the collision took s place . that
the plaintiff, in a careless and Inattentive way,
was about to cross the railroad track in front
of the approaching car. in ignorance of Its ap
proach; and yet while the motormrui knew
or should have known of those facts, â¢ he made
no attempt to avert Injury to plaintiff until
plaintiff had been run down by the car and
almost fatally Injured. Such conduct fairly in
dicates wantonness and recklessness on the
part of the motorman, or it at least indicates
failure . upon his part to exercise an . ordinary
degree of care to prevent the injury which
plaintiff received. .When one Is crossing or
attempting to cross a railroad . track under such
circumstances as renders It doubtful to the mo
torman, on the approaching car. whether he
can -accomplish his purpose or not, the, motor
man is not justified in proceeding In his course
without making at least some effort to stop
the car, up to the point of collision. ,C
: i The evidence. in my opinion, shows that the
1 mttorman omitted. to perform his duty In this
regard.' and hence the defendant Is responsible.
I consider that there was no prejudicial error
committed : during the trial, and that the evl-
I'.-tiiv was .;â  sufficient to . support the " verdict.
The motion for a new. trial; is denied. : Â:
Released on Bonds.
Grace Tjoose and Elsie Williams, recent
ly indicted by the Grand Jury on charges
of extortion in connection with the noto
rious Nevills scandal, were released on
bonds by Judge Cook yesterday mornins-
Five thousand dollars was required by the
court in each case before the order of re
lease was" signed. H. Ashderian ana
George M. SeropLan, property owners of
Fresno, qualified on the bond. When this
work had been concluded the order foi
the release of the prisoners was signed
and the young women left the prison to
gethery . i
ALEXANDER. BOYD SUED.
Heirs of Jacob Z. Davis Sue for a
Division of Partnership
Interests.
Mrs. Belle Curtis and Miss Lizzie Mulr,
heirs of the late Jacob Z. Davis, have en
tered suit against Alexander Boyd, Davis*
former partner, for a settlement of tho
property owned by the firm.
As surviving partner Boyd has author
ity to settle up the affairs of the partner
ship, but it is alleged that so far he ha*
refused to do this, and the suit has ac
cordingly been filed. The property in
cludes the Thurlow block at Sutter and
Kearny streets and other property at Cai
liornia and Market, Battery and Pine,
Market and Front. Battery and California
and Folsom and Second streets, the total
value of which will exceed $2,000,000.
It is the desire of all parties to avoid tha
appointment of a receiver, and the conse
quent sale of real estate If an agreement
in partition can possibly be reached.
Post Street Extension.
The applications of the Post Street Ex
tension Commissioners for permission to
take from the office of the clerk of the
Board of Supervisors, the books and maps
for the work, for the purpose of making a
modified report, will he denied. The report
and plat were filed in May, 1801, and In
February following- a protest filed by the
property owners interested was sustained
by the Supervisors. City and County At
torney Creswell is of the opinion that It
is now too late to make a modification of
the report and that the maps and booka
should be ret lined by Clerk Russell. If
j the work contemplated was carried out It
i would cost over $100,000.
"Nobby" Clark Again Worsted.
Forty-five cases for damages, nppregrat
inp several millions of dollars, brought hy
Alfred, alias Nobby Clarke, formerly clerk
of the Police Commissioners, were thrown
out of court yesterday by United States
Circuit Judge Morrow. The suits were
brought on behalf of various persons for
false imprisonment and other alleged
grievances, the most pretentious of whicn
was the suit brought by Clarke against
the Supreme Court for half a million dol
lars damages for causing his Imprison
ment for contempt.
