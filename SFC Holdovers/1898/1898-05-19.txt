HA WARDEN, May 18.â William E.
Gladstone died at 5 o'clock this morn
ing. Mr. Gladstone had been uncon
scious practically all day, though at
times he seemed to recognize for a mo
ment some of the watchers about him.
Certainly he did recogni-e his wife, who
was beside him all day, except when
the physician prevailed upon her to
rest. She tenderly clasped her hus
band's hand as she watched him. Ap
parently he slept a good deal; occa
sionally he uttered a few words in an
Incoherent, dreamy way; words which
those who were watching were unable
to catch. Their only consolation was
that he was not suffering pain. No
narcotics were administered.
Though a national funeral will prob
ably be accepted by the family, there
!s little doubt that the remains of Mr.
Gladstone will be laid to rest in the
p<=acf-ful graveyard at Hawarden ad
joining the church where he was mar
ried more than half a century ago.

stone. In two places, perhaps, was the
tension most keen and heartfelt â the
House of Commons and Hawarden.
Just before the House rose yesterday
a telegram from Mr. Gladstone reach
ed Ix>rd Stanley announcing that his
father was sinkingr.
Already, before his death, the hush
of grief seemed to fall over the scene
of his triumphs, and from the present
men turned to the past, recalling say
ings and doings. A great lion lay dy
ing, his old colleagues, his one time
enemies and followers, watching his
last long fight with his last and Im
placable foe, as they watched in past
days his fight against foes whom h?
could overcome. True to himself, he
was yielding: slowly, inch by inch. It
was generally felt at St. Stephen's that
his dying was but the sequel to that
great scene witnessed four years ago
when, his last speech spoken, he
quitted the House without one word
of spoken adieu.
Anticipating? 'he Inevitable, the mem
bers of the Government discussed the
appropriate procedure to be observed,
and resolved that no effort on their
part should be wanting to mark a suit

Disregard hie recent precedents, It
was decided that the programme In
Parliament should be tho same as that
adopted In the a&w* of the Earl of
Chatham and of the younger Pitt,
The San Francisco Call
namely, an address to her Majesty,
praying for a funeral at the publlo
charge, and a monument erected In
Westminster Abbey.
Throughout the whole kingdom, every
public gathering added Its words of
grief to the volume of national mourn
ing, clearly voiced in the telegram
from the Prince of Wales to Mr. Her
bert Gladstone:
"My thoughts are with you , your
mother and your family at this trying
tme you are experiencing. God grant
that your father does not suffer.
"ALBERT EDWARD."
At the banquet of the Home Counties
Liberal Federation last evening, Sir
William Vernon Harcourt, Liberal
leader in the House of Commons, in
stead of delivering an important party
attack, only uttered a few words of
grief, and left the room. The Duke of
Devonshire, Lord President of the
Council of Ministers, speaking before
the British Empire League, referred
touchingly to the mourning scenes at
Hawarden, where "the greatest of
Englishmen was slowly passing away."
In other places, Lord Horatio Davis,
Lord George Hamilton, the Secretary
of State for India, Henry Campbell-
Bannerman and many others in Lon
don, as well as in Birmingham, Swan
sea, Cardiff, Liverpool, Edinburgh and
elsewhere, at all sorts of gatherings,
politicians, divines, agitators, reform
ers and women joined in the expression
of national and individual grief, while
the press, without exception, published
columns of detail and columns of edi
torial comments.
It was the topic of the hour in Great
Britain, but abroad the evidences of
sympathy were almost as universal. M.
Faure, President of the French repub-
j ceived every bulletin. The press of
! Belgium, France, Italy and Greece, In a
! spontaneous outburst, recalled how
; many oppressed people during Mr.
! Gladstone's life have offered hymns of
i praise for his Intervention In their be
half; while In Madrid, even, the pros
pect of his death has caused a twenty
| four hour suspension of war animosity
j against England.
Not the least point In this tribute to
Mr. Gladstone was its profound una
nimity.
STORY OF THE CAREER
OF THE GRAND OLD MAN,
How Gladstone Became One of the
Greatest Statesmen of Modern
Times.
No Englishman of this century stood
so high in certain qualities of states
manship as Mr. Gladstone. It is un
necessary to institute comparisons in
preceding centuries. The leaders of
those past generations were not states
men of the legislative national type at
all. They were the heads of parties,
mostly aristocratic, on one side or the
other, "Whigs or Tories, or they were
the personal agents or favorites of the
monarchy. Statesmen professing to
act for the people can hardly be said

WHAT HAS BECOME
OF THE PHANTOM
FLEET OF SPAIN?
New York, May 1 8. âWhile
naval authorities believe Ha
vana is the ultimate destina
tion of Admiral Cervera's
squadron, and the Herald dis
patches show that General
Blanco is expecting it, Secre
tary Long has the impression
that it may turn up at Porto
Rico. The question is, Where
is it now? Advices to the
Herald from Panama state
that the rumor is current in
Colon that the Spanish ships
may come there to coal. Navy
officials believe if the fleet is
not already at San Juan, it is
coaling somewhere off the
Venezuela coast. Neither the
Navy Department nor the
Herald has been able to con
firm the reported presence of
the fleet at San Juan, although
the Washington authorities
place great credence in this
report. One thing is certain:
Admiral Cervera's delay in
seeking battle has afforded
Sampson's and Schley's fleets
an opportunity to effect a
junction of their forces.

HAVANA, May 18.â No one
here knows exactly where the
Spanish fleet is. In official

thai it will reach Porto Rico.
Popular comment is that it

No Spanish fleet has been

NEW YORK, May 18.â A

much credence in the report
from Porto Rico, published
by the Heraid, that the
Spanish squadron has reached
San Juan, but they have
been unable to confirm it.
None of the scouts have re
ported the fleet. Consul
Van Home, at. St. Thomas,
cables that the only Spanish
vessels sighted were three

If Admiral Cervera's squad

PRESIDENT
WEARY OF
INACTIVITY
Large American Force to
Be Landed on the Island
Immediately.
Navy Department Receives News
That the Battleship Oregon
Is Now Safe.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, May 18.
Atlast the administration has decided on a vigorous prosecu
tion of the war. The President, tired of the dilatory tactics of
the so-called Naval Strategy Board, and the failure to definitely
locate or overtake the Spanish "vanishing squadron," has in
structed Secretary of War Alger to prepare for the immediate
invasion of Cuba without waiting for the Spanish fleet to show
itself.
Great activity was apparent at the War Department to
day. The members of General Miles' staff were again ordered
to hold themselves in readiness to go south on short notice.
It is understood that this sudden change in policy was
brought about by the President himself, who since Sunday last
has been very much disturbed over reports from Havana that
only a remnant of the reconcentrados survived and that these
were on the verge of starvation. Inasmuch as the relief of
these wretched people was the very reason for our armed in
tervention in Cuban affairs, the President is keenly, sensitive
to the criticism which points out that the very object of the
war with Spain is being defeated by the present dilatory tac
tics of both army and navy.
While President McKinley was at
first anxious to avoid shelling Cuba's
capital, attended as it will be* by the
destruction of innocent live- to say
nothing of the sacrifice of many of our
soldiers, who are to invade Cuba, he
now realizes that the longer it is de
layed the more difficult will be the cap
ture of Havana. Blanco is not only
taking advantage of our delay to throw
up serviceable earthworks along the
north coast, but there appears to be a
fair prospect that Admiral Cervera's
fleet on this side of the Atlantic will
soon be reinforced by the powerful bat
tleship Pelayo, the cruisers Emperador
Carlos V, Alfonso XIII and several
more torpedo-boats.
He realizes that a mistake was made
in not following up the Manila victory
with the reduction of Havana's batter
ies and a bombardment of the city in
stead of sending Sampson on a wild
goose chase to San Juan, where little
was accomplished beyond damaging its
principal fortifications. But it is not
not yet too late to recover from this
lost opportunity, and it was said to-day
that the President had determined to
send 100.000 men to Cuba if necessary.
' Secretary Long gave out the welcome
information to-day that the battleship
Oregon, the second largest craft in the
American navy, had successfully com
pleted her long trip from San Fran
cisco, making the entire circle of South
America, and was now safe. Whether
or not she has joined Admiral Samp
son's fleet the Secretary would not say.
The rigid secrecy of the Navy Depart
ment was relaxed only enough to make
known the best news the Navy Depart
ment had received since the battle of
Manila, as it meant not only that the
Oregon was out of harm's way from a
concerted attack on this one ship by
thÂ« whole Spanish squadron now in
southern waters, but also that her great
fighting strength would be added to
Admiral Sampson's force in the near
future iÂ«\ indeed, it had not already
augmented the admiral's strength.
In all the trip covered more than
13 000 miles. The last stretch, from
Bahia to the Windward Islands, has
been followed with anxiety by naval
officials, for, by a strange coincidence,
the formidable Spanish squadron of
armored cruisers and torpedo boats
approached the Windward Islands at
the very time when the Oregon was
due there. It had been suspected that
the Spanish admiral would try to in
tercept the battle-ship .with his su
perior force, and before leaving Bahia
Captain Clark of the Oregon was
warned to keep a close lookout for
the Spanish fleet.
In reply Captain Clark expressed his
confidence in being able to hold his
own single-handed against all the
Spanish cruisers. The only apprehen
sion he felt was as to torpedo boats
under the Spanish admiral's command,
for these ara a new and practically
untried element against the modern
battle-ship, and Captain Clark, while
confident of holding out against these
also, said a chance blow might be
struck by them.
Notwithstanding Captain Clark's as
surances, the Navy Department con
tinued to feel that a meeting between
the Spanish squadron and the Amer
PRICE FIVE CEXTS.
ican battle-ship on such unequal terms
was far from desirable and might
bring serious results. For this reason
the official information reaching the
authorities to-day was the source of
most hearty congratulation. Where
the report came from was not made
known, but the mere fact that Secre
tary Long regards the Oregon as safe
makes it possible that she has passed
to the northward of the Windward
Islands.
The cruiser Charleston, which started
to-day on her long journey to meet
Admiral Dewey at Manila, should ar
rive there in about twenty-four days
allowing a couple of days at Honolulu
for coal.
The stock of ammunition which the
Charleston carries is believed to be the
great essential just now, the fierce en
gagement at Cavite having consumed a
large part of the American admiral's
shot and shell.
There is a good deal of talk at the
War Department to-day of the possi
bility of an issue by the President of
another call for volunteers, but care
ful inquiry tends to warrant the state
ment that this is at least premature
and that no further call is likely to issue
until the aggregate number of soldiers
already called for have responded and
have been duly equipped for service.
This last matter, the equipment of the
new troops, Is the main source of de
lay and promises to become even worse
in the near future.
The Kearsarge and Kentucky win
soon be ready for service; likewise the
Newark, and it is believed the cruisers
Columbia and San Francisco, which
have been stationed off the New Eng
land coast, are also under orders to pro
ceed south and join either Sampson <;r
Schley. The auxiliary cruiser St. Paul,
Captain Sigsbee, arrived at Key West
to-day. The addition of these war
vessels will greatly strengthen the
fighting and flying squadrons. There
will be a sufficient force not only to ef
fectually maintain the blockade of
Cuba's south coast, but for the siege
of Havana. Blanco's forces will be
attacked by our land forces before re
lief can reach him from Admiral Cer
vera.
Meanwhile the Board of Strategy,
facetiously known here as the "Board
of Letharrv." is without any informa
tion as to the present whereabouts of
the Spaniards or their probable des
tination. All it appears to know is that
the fleet sailed northwesterly from
from Curacao. No confirmation of the
report that the squadron i 3 now in the
harbor of Pan Juan has been received
either through the press or official dis
patches. If the Spa:.!~rds are at San
Juan n-> further strategy will be re
quired. They will either be fought to
a finish in their own harbor or else its
mouth will be >lockaded, and the Porto
Ricans starved Into submission, while
t'ae siege of Havana is progressing.
If the Spaniards kept on their north

time, be â¼or- near Cienfuegos, where
there are only a few small Amerioan
vessels or else In the Yucatan Channel,
with the Idea of descending upon Ha
vana and raising the blockade.

MISSIONARIES ARE
IN GREAT DANGER
Those Who Failed to Leave the
Caroline Islands May Be Mas
sacred by Spaniards,
VICTORIA, B. C, May 18.â News is brought by passengers from
the Caroline Islands, who arrived here on the steamer Aorangi. They
say that there are many American missions on the Carolines, the group
of Spanish islands in the Southern Pacific, both Catholic and Pro
testant, which will suffer on account of the war. Even in times of
peace the Spanish residents there have never lost an opportunity to
show their hatred for the Americans, and w.hen the news of Spanish
reverses reaches the islands it would undoubtedly mean the massacre
of missionaries and the demolishment of their missions, which were
in a most flourishing condition. The 'missionaries were asked to leave
the islands when the steamer Archer left for Sydney just before the
war commenced, but they, thinking their calling would be sufficient
protection for them with a people alleged to be Christians, would not
relinquish their work. According to the passengers on the Aorangi,
who decline to give their names, fearing it may injure them, as they
have large interests in the Carolines, they will be martyrs to their
duty, as the Spaniards will assuredly slay 'them in revenge for the re
verses of their country. Newsalso comes of the loss of the German
schooner Alster, on a voyage from* the Marshall to the Caroline Isl
ands, with all on board.
coast defense vessel Monterey will be
sent to Manila. Secretary Long says
this will be done only in the very re
mote possibility that Spain sends a
fleet to recapture the Philippines. If
Spain really was fitting out an expe
dition for Mai.lla she would not allow
every day disnatehes to be sent from
Madrid and Barcelona concerning the
matter. Such was the statement of a
Cabinet officer to-night who ridiculed
all these "uncensored" dispatches from
Spain about tLa plans of that Govern
ment in the Prclflc Ocean or elsewhere
as unmitigated falsehoods. The Phila
delphia Press, Postmaster-General
Smith's paper, says:
"The size of the Manila expedition is
really of secondary importance. Its
celerity is more important. Any force
is better than waiting. Congress has
committed the inconceivable folly of
forcing war on a country which Con-,
gress had refused to provide with an
army, but England has been caught
the same way and scrambled out of the
mess, as we shall. The one serious
risk is that, the job being new, the
staff departments at Washington will
prepare too long and fool with belts
and buckles and fixings when the one
essential important matter Is to put a
few thousand Americans with rifles
and West Point officers in Manila.
There, as elsewhere, the English
speaking race will have its own per
suasive way with the brown."
The Japanese Minister, Toru Hoshi,
made another call on Secretary Day at
the State Department this morning.
When he emerged he made the follow
ing statement relative to the Philip
pines: "The J-nanese Government has
made no protest against the occupa
tion of the Philippines by the United
States. The stories that have been
printed in various newspapers, alleging
that Japan objected to this occupation
are based on wild rumors only." Secre
tary Day also has a positive denial of
the rumor.
It is known that some of Minister
Hoshi's visits have related to Hawaii
and the proposition made a month or
more ago that these islands be seized
by the United States as a war measure.
This, it is understood, would have been
objected to by Japan, on account of the
unsettled relations between the present
Government of the islands and Japan.
It is also understood that Japan may
become a bidder for the Philippines, if
they are for sale when the Spanish-
American war is over.
GIVES TIME FOR THE
JUNCTION OF SQUADRONS
Cervera's Delay in Entering Cuban
Waters Affords a Great Ad
vantage to Our Ships.
NEW YORK, May 18.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Spain's fleet has delayed its appear
ance in Cuban waters a sufficient
length of time to permit a junction of
the men-of-Avar under command of
Rear-Admiral Sampson and Commo
dore Schley. While this junction has
not yet been effected, the authorities
are hourly expected to hear of the
meeting of the two squadrons and of
the consequent formation of armor
ciads which will be able to defeat the
Spanish men-of-war without any
great difficulty, should they chance to
meet. It is expected that the vessels
of the North Atlantic and flying squad
rons will require coal, and arrange
ments have been perfected by the de
partment for supplying them imme
diately upon their arrival at the point
of meeting.
In addition I understand that a large
amount of ammunition and projectiles
have been shipped to Key West, from
which point they will be sent to Rear-
Admiral Sampson, who will distribute
them among the vessels of his com- j
mand which participated in the recent
bombardment of San Juan. Upon
completion of the coaling and ammu
nitioning of his ships he will be direct
ed by the Naval War Board to take up
a central and strategic position, from
which point he will be able to steam
swiftly to strike the enemy upon its
appearance in any direction.
As stated in the Herald, the Naval
War Board in considering the problem
of destroying the Spanish fleet has two
points which they must ever keep in
view â first, the protection of ports
along the Atlantic seaboard, and sec
ond, the protection of the blockading
squadron and maintenance of the
blockade.
It is, therefore, manifestly Impossi
ble for it to order Rear- Admiral Samp
son with his heavy fleet of armorclads
to proceed to San Juan, provided the
Spanish fleet is at that point, unless
such movement can be accomplished
with the utmost secrecy, and he can
reach his destination before the Span
ish force has had a chance to get
away.
But it is also recognized by the board
that it is necessary to destroy the fleet
before its reinforcements arrive, and to
destroy the battle-ships Pelayo and
Carlos V, forming such reinforcement.
An investigation made by the officials
causes them to doubt the truth of there
port cabled them yesterday, as stated
in the Herald this morning, announc
ing the departure of the Spanish ves
sels from Cadiz, but they are deter
mined to maintain a sharp lookout and
cut off these two ships if opportunity
presents itself.

ASSAILED BY MAD MOBS
ENRAGED BECAUSE A CARGO
WAS FOR AMERICA.
The British Skipper Followed to the
Consulate at Huelva. and Then
He Was Compelled to
Leave in Haste.
BALTIMORE, May 18. â Captain
Wood of the British steamship Els
wick, which arrived here from Huelva,
reports that he had an eventful ex
perience in the Spanish port. He ar
rived there on April 22 to take on a
cargo of 3200 tons of sulphur for Balti
more. Public sentiment was running:
high against America and Americans
and he gave It out that his cargo was
destined for Rotterdam. He had load
ed 3200 tons by April 27, when he
thought discretion the better part of
valor and weighed anchor.
"When the Spaniards found out I
was going to the United States," said
Captain Wood, "they became wild with
rage and refused to put another pound
of the cargo into the ship. A mob
came down to the dock and began riot
ing. They were armed with sticks and
stones, as well as big knives. They
expressed their hatred for Englishmen
just as much as for Americans, and de
clared they would destroy my ship and
all aboard. I decided to get away as
soon as possible.
"I gave orders to get ready for sea
and visited the Venezuelan Consul, who
represented the United States Govern
ment, to have my papers attested. I
no sooner left the ship than a crowd
began following me, hooting at me. I
paid no attention and continued on up
the street until I reached the Albion
Hotel, where the consulate is located.
The fast increasing mob gathered out
side the hotel and when they discov
ered I was in conversation with the
Consul of Venezuela they stormed the
place. . ,
"The American flag, which was in
the Consul's office, was torn to rib
bons and trodden upon the streets, and
the American coat of arms was shat
tered to atoms. The eagle was kicked
in the mud and spat upon.
"The mob then went for me. They
bombarded the hotel with stones and
smashed every window in it. They
threw a dozen or more huge stones at
me, several of which just grazed my
head. They then drew murderous
looking knives crying that I was an
American, and tried to kill me. I
slipped out of the baok way and by
making a detour rparhed my ?hip un
molested. As soon as I got aboard I
saw the mob coming down the quay,
yelling like mad, to renew the attack.
I ordered the lines cast off, and, as the
tug was alongside, we were soon out
of their reach. We went out a little
way and anchored, after which I got
back ashore on the tugboat and se
cured my papers, and then we sailed
immediately.
"Soon after we left Gibraltar two
small craft were sighted astern, and it
did not take us long 1 to make them out
to be Spanish torpedo boats. They
were evidently in pursuit of us, and for
thirty miles they followed us, but
when night came on we put on a full
head of steam and ran for It out into
the open sea. We kept going lively all
night, and when day dawned our pur
suers were nowhere in sight."

MISS FRANCES
ALGER A BRIDE
Weds Charles Burrall
Pike of Chicago.
PRETTY MARRIAGE RITES
PRESIDENT McKINLEY ONE OF
THE GUESTS.
Many Officers o fthe Army in Full
Dress Uniforms Present
to Witness the
Ceremony.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 18.
Under a canopy of orchids and vines,
intertwined with pink ribbon, all
radiating from a softly shaded electric
lig-ht, Frances Aura Alger, the young
est daughter of the Secretary of War,
and Charles Burrall Pike of Chicago,
â¢son of Eugene S. Pike, one of that city's
most energetic and influential citizens,
were married at noon to-day at the
residence of Secretary Alger.
President and Mrs. McKlnley were
near the wedding party during the
ceremony, as were the Vice President
and Mrs. Hobart, The company was a
most distinguished one and reflected in
a brilliant sense the official world of
the capital. The presence of so many
officers of the army and navy in full
dress uniforms suggested the moment
ous events in which the nation is now
most interested.
The floral adornment of the house,
while as elaborate as ever seen in this
city, was at the same time the most
artistic. Bridesmaid and moss roses
and orchids in pink and white varie
ties were combined with asparagus
and ribbon garlands. The electric lights
in the ceiling of the main drawing
room were made the centers of two
canopy effects, which covered nearly
the entire space. In the music-room,
where the permanent coloring is yel
low, the same effect was attained with
yellow blossoms and green vines, and
in the other rooms were delicate com
binations of floral fragrance and
color.
Mrs. Alger received the guests and
looked unusually handsome in a
mourning costume of black silk and
jetted chiffon. When the wedding
march announced the entrance of the
bridal procession the guests separated
and an aisle was formed down the cen
ter of the drawing room, through which
the party passed to the waiting clergy
man. The groom and his best man, Mr.
William Pike, entered by the east door
of the drawing room. The bride's par
ty came by a longer route, through the
dining room and music room. At the
head were the ushers. The bridesmaids
were Miss Helen Pitts and Miss Crit
tenden of Detroit, Miss Miles and Miss
Jessie Gary. Miss Henry of Detroit,
cousin of the bride, preceded her as
maid of honor.
The bride's wedding dress was of
heavy white satin, made in the style of
Marie Antoinette and trimmed with
point lace. Her tulle veil was very be
coming. Crowning her dark hair was
a spray of orange blossoms. The
groom's gift, a large diamond star, was
worn with other flashing gems.
Following the ceremony the wedding

When breakfast was announced the
President escorted the br^de to the
table.
President and Mrs. McKinley sat near
the bride and groom, at whose table
were also seated the bridesmaids, ush
ers and parents of both bride and
groom. The Marine Band played the

rice, the couple started for a honey
moon jaunt, making the first part of
the trip aboard the Alger private car.

of time for their bridal journeying and
then will settle down to housekeeping
in Chicago in a fine residence of their
own. Mr. Pike is a member of a well
known law firm in Chicago. He is a
Harvard graduate.
THERE HAS BEEN
TOO MUCH DELAY
WASHINGTON, May 18.â When the
Senate, on motion of Senator Hawley,
went into secret session to-day on the
quartermasters bill, Hawley read a let
ter from General Flagler, chief of the
Bureau of Ordnance, requesting that
authority be given for the purchase of
ordnance without waiting to advertise,
saying that such delay might at times
be of very serious consequence. The
letter was not notable In any respect,
except that It was an official acknowl
edgment of the fact that there are still
many articles to be secured for the
equipment of the army and that expe
dition is considered necessary in secur-
ing them.
The reading of the letter led to a
brief discussion of the status of mili
tary operations and some impatience
was expressed regarding the delay In
getting the military expedition to the
Philippines started.
Senator Lodge made a brief speech
on this point, expressing the hope that
if the passage of the bill would expe
dite in any wise the movement of this
force, It would be put through without
any further delay whatever. He re
ferred to the battle of Manila as the
most notable naval triumph of the
world, because of its remarkable one
sidedness, and expressed surprise and
disappointment that eighteen days
should have been allowed to elapse be
fore troops sufficient to enable us to
follow the naval victory with an at
tack upon the Spanish land forces at
Manila, had even been put in readiness
to start upon their mission.
Senator Gorman repeated his criti
cism made in open session of the pro
vision Inserted by the conferees, but
said he would not place any barrier In
the way of action upon the report.
There was no division upon the accept
ance of the report.
Bed Cross Society Formed.
PETALUMA, May 18.â A large num
be of citizens met to-day at the City
Hall and organized an auxiliary
branch of the Red Cross Society. A
considerable amount has been sub
scribed and members were appointed
to canvass the different wards of the
city and carry on the work. The offi
cers are: President, Miss Nellie Den
man; vice-president, Mrs. E. New
burgh; secretary, Mrs. Blanche B.
English; treasurer, F. H. At water.
Another big meeting will be held Sat
urday night.

Tornado Sweeps Over
Eastern lowa.
SCORE OF PERSONS KILLED
HOUSES RAZED AND THEIR IN
MATES CRUSHED.
The Storm Crosses the Mississippi
Into Illinois, Its Course Marked
by Ruined Buildings and
Leveled Orchards.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLINTON, lowa, May 18.â Over a
score of lives were lost and thousands
of dollars worth of property was de
stroyed by a tornado which swept Clin
ton and Jackson Counties this after
noon. The storm jumped Into Western
Illinois near Savannah, and It was at
that point that the loss of human life
was the greatest. Telegraph and tele
phone facilities are paralyzed to-night
and the full extent of the storm is yet
to be learned. The dead so far re
ported are:
At Preston, lowaâ Charles Flora,
Mrs. Flora, three children.
At Quigley, lowaâ William O'Meara,
child of John Clark.
At Riggs Station, lowa â Martin
Hines, daughter of Michael Solon.
At Stanwood, la. â Michael Maloney,
Luke Maloney.
At Delmar Junction â Oba Allison, B.
Clemenson.
At Savannah, 111. â Four persons,
names unknown.
The storm which worked such de
vastation in the rich f-rming counties
along the eastern border of lowa and
Western Illinois started shortly after
3 o'clock this morning a mile south of
StanwooJ. From Stanwood it moved
rapidly in a northeasterly direction,
passing over the northeastern part of
Clinton County, the northwestern part
01 Clinton County and then over the
southern portion of Jackson County.
This section of the State is thickly set
tled. No towns were in the path of the
storm, but farmhouses and barns were
torn to pieces by the score.
The storm was seen approaching by
many of the farmers, and they sought
refuge in the cellars. At least twenty
five were, however, unable to find
shelter, and probably as many more
were seriously injured by flying tim
bers. The path of the storm varied in
width from forty rods in some parts of
Clinton County to eighty feet in Jack
son County.
Trees and outhouses were torn to
pieces. Roofs of farmhouses were lift
ed like straws and carried a half mile
along the path of the storm and then
hurled against the walls of big stock
barns, cutting thesn in two and killing
hundreds of cattle which had taken
shelter in the sheds from the storm's
fury. A half dozen school buildings
are known to have been destroyed, but
it is not thought that any of the pupils
perished, must of them having just
reached homo when the storm broke
out.
Near Preston, lowa, more buildings
were destroyed than in any other lo
cality. The wind swirled through the
little vilage with frightful velocity,
leaving scarcely a house standing. Five
persons lost their lives there. Charles
Flora, with his wife and three children,
had his home torn to pieces, and all
were crushed to death under the fall
ing walls.
The cyclone crossed to Illinois, be
tween Savannah and Thompson. One
family of four persons was destroyed
near Savannah. Passing to the east,
much damage was done, but it was
confined almost entirely to outbuild
ings. No lives are thought to have
been lost anywhere in Illinois, except
those mentioned, near Savannah. Tele
graph and telephone wires are down in
all directions, but it is believed that
the storm has spent its force.
Another tornado formed at Amboy,
111., shortly before dark this evening.
The storm cloud formed about six miles
Bouth of Amboy and took an easterly
course. It traveled about twenty miles
without changing its course, and de
stroyed everything in its path. Or
chards, farmhouses and barns were
wrecked, but no lives are known to
have been lost.
Owing to the peculiar atmospheric
conditions prevailing all afternoon, the
inhabitants were on the lookout for
just what had occurred. At the first
alarm, they took to the cellars, and
many of them were imprisoned for
hours by the timbers of their wrecked
houses. Livestock suffered con
siderably, and the loss to property gen
erally will amount to thousands of dol
lars.
At Antigo, Wis., scores of houses
were leveled, many were unroofed, and
a score of people '.vere injured. A heavy
storm was general in Wisconsin, and
farm property suffered great loss.
DUBUQUE, lowa, May 18.âPussen
gers who arrived on the Milwaukee
road to-night say they met the storm
about 5 o'clock below Lanark, 111. A
cloud, appalling in its blackness, ap
proached from the northwest and
struck the train almost as soon as seen
and with great fury. Northwest of
that point funnel-shaped cloud* were
seen occasionally dropping to the
earth. There was a heavy hailstorm,
and passengers saw uprooted trees and
parts of fences and buildings flying in
all directions. Just before the train
reached Lanark they saw shattered
farmhouses, a:id many farmers were
rushing across the fields.
A mile and a half out of Lanark a
poorhouse was demolished. The build
ing was of brick and how many of the
twenty-five inmates were buried in the
debris could not be learned. They
heard reports of many persons having
been killed and much property de
stroyed, but names could not be
learned. At a settlement a short dis
tance out three houses were wrecked,
the people saving their lives by rush
ing into storm cellars.
At Skillman, 111., the home of
Michael Nelson was destroyed. Nel
son, his wife and two children were
killed. Two persons, names not known,
were killed at Adeline, 111. Richard
Rose, at Byron, 111., and Mrs. Frank
Chichester, at Pawpaw, 111., lost their
lives.
DTTLUTH, Minn.. May 18.â A tornado
struck the village of Pennington on
the Soo line this afternoon, completely
wiping out the place. Three persons
are known to. have bÂ«*n killed and
probably fifty are injured. The sec
tion foreman and two sectionmen are
among: the killed. There was untold
suffering among the injured people till
word could be sent to North Qrandon,
thirty miles away, for assistance. A
special train with physicians and pro
visions went to the scene of the storm
this evening. They report tha,t scarce
ly a building is left standing.

SANTA ROSA, May 18.â Santa Rosa
is now completely bedecked in her car
nival dress, and it is doubtful if a city
in this part of the State ever before
was half so gorgeously arrayed. To
morrow night the big carnival will be
gin. At 8 o'clock the coronation of
beautiful Queen Grace will take place
on the dais erected opposite the Court
house square, and from the moment
that Mayor James S. Sweet makes his
address of welcome and hands to her
gracious majesty the key of pure gold,
typical of the freedom of the city and
the surrender of the civic authorities
to the officials of Flora's realm, busi
ness cares will exist no more this week
for the busy merchant, the artisan or
the laborer. The gallant knight and
his lady fair will lay aside the duties
that have for the past few days been
occupying their attention as delegates
to the Grand Lodge's meeting here this
week, and will devote their whole time
and attention to the pleasures of the
hour. The gorgeous and spectacular
street pageant, which Is to be the
crowning event of the week, will take
place Friday afternoon, and the indica
tions are that the parade of this year
will exceed in beauty and size anything
of a similar nature ever before at
tempted in the State. The wonderful
fleet, upon the flagship of which Queen
Grace and her maids and entire court
will ride through the city's streets, the
many other novel features never be
fore attempted, the enthusiasm noted
on every side â all tend to show that the
carnival of 1898 will be the success of
all successes.
The Knights of Pythias Grand Lodge
continued its labors to-day. The mat
ter of disposing of the offices within
the gift of the Grand Lodge is already
attracting a great deal of interest. C.
L. Patton, at present grand vice-chan
cellor of the order, will succeed Judge
W. H. Grant of Woodland as grand
chancellor without opposition. Mr.
Patton is at present grand master of
the Masonic fraternity of this State and
his new office will place him at the head
of two of the largest and most influ
ential fraternal organizations in Cali
fornia. H. R. Arndt of San Diego, at
present occupying the office of grand
prelate, will, in the regular course of
events, be the next grand vice-chan
cellor.
For the office of grand prelate the fol
lowing candidates are in the field and
some "tall" politics is being done. Lieu
tenant-Governor William T. Jeter of
Santa Cruz, J. H. Liffett of Sacra
mento, E. I. Wolff of San Francisco and
E. W. Davis of Berkeley.
For the honor of acting as supremft
representatives at the coming session
of the Supreme Lodge, the candidates
are many. Hon. Frank McGowan oc
cupied the position, having been elected
previously; but, discovering that bust
ness reasons would prevent his serving,
he resigned to-day, whereupon the foi
lowjng aspirants for the place were an
nounced: Brigadier-General C. F. Mc-
Glashan of Truckee, J. T. Crowley,
Walter C. Graves, Georgre Samuel and
George E. Church. Several precincts
are still to be heard from.
H. Schaffner, grand keeper of the re
cords and seals, will be re-elected with
out opposition. S. G. Little will also
be re-elected grand master of the ex
chequer. For the office of grand mas
ter-at-arms only one candidate so far
has really entered the field. He is C
S. Van Roy of Sacramento. Henry G.
Rahman of this city may become a can
didate.
The election for grand trustees will be
an interesting one. Those known to
be in the field are the Rev. I. M. Mer
linjones of Los Angeles, C. L. Levy of
San Francisco, W. H. Easdor of Los
Angeles, C. O. Alkire of Pasadena, Jo
seph Williams of San Francisco, W. J.
Rogers of Ran Francisco, Signor Steiner
of Escondido, George L. Mergulre of
Palo Alto and Andrew Johrdahl of Eu
reka.
The big excursion to the Redwoods
of Guerneville to-day was attended by
over twelve hundred people from this
city alone, and the affair was a great
success in every way. To-night a ball
at the Athenaeum was held in honor
of the delegates and visitors.
At to-day's session of the Grand Lodge
the representatives to the Supreme Lodge
were instructed to use every effort to in

NO VESSEL HAS RUN
THE MANILA BLOCKADE
Dewey's Fleet Has Captured Several
Spanish Steamships and Coast
ing Vessels.
LONDON, May 19.â The correspond
ent at Manila of the Daily Telegraph
telegraphs under date of Friday as fol
lows: Despite the worries of the block
ade, the spirits of the Spanish officials
are well maintained. The vessels of
Admiral Dewey's squadron keep their
positions and content themselves with
preventing all supplies from reaching
the beleaguered city.
In addition to the Callao, the Amer
icans have taken some steamers which
were making for the port and several
coasting vessels. Nothing has yet suc
ceeded in running the blockade. Ad
miral Dewey is credited with a desire
to capture Spanish steamers, as his
launches have been scouting around
the coast.
The rebel forces have not yet sum
moned up courage to attack the city.
They are in condition to do so, but they
ravage the country outside. The for
eign residents believe that if the city
fell into the hands of the rebels it
would be deplorable. The Governor is
creating a loyal native legion to assist
in coping with rebel attacks, while the
Spanish regular troops are reserved to
meet any American forces that may be
landed.

LAUNCHING OF
THE ALABAMA
Battle-Ship Slides From
the Ways.
FEW SPECTATORS PRESENT.
CRAMPS' YARD CLOSED TO
GUARD AGAINST SPIES.
Daughter of Senator Morgan Chris
tens the Vessel, Which Will
Be Beady for Service
Within a Year.
PHILADELPHIA, May 18.â The bat
tle-ship Alabama was launched at
Cramps' shipyard shortly before 1
o'clock this afternoon. Miss Mary E.
Morgan, daughter of Senator Morgan
of Alabama, had the honor of breaking
the traditional bottle of wine on the
prow of the big fighter as it slid from
the ways.
The fact that the launching of Ihe
ship was one of the most successful
ever witnessed at Cramps, is regarded
as an omen of good fortune. So eager
was the Alabama to get into her na
tive element that before the swing of
the "shoe" which holds the cradle in
place had been completed, the mon
strous hull, tugging with a weight of
thousands of tons on the strips of oak,
tore them apart, and the big mass of
steel glided gracefully into the water a
few seconds ahead of schedule time.
Miss Morgan stood on a dais built on
the launching platform, directly under
the bow of the Alabama. She was
attended by her father. Senator Mor
gan, and her sister, Miss Cornelia Mor
gan. As the ship began to tremble pre
paratory to sliding off the well-greased
ways, she took a firmer grasp on the
gayly bedecked bottle of native Aln- I
bama wine which she held in her right
hand, and, swinging it above her head,
smashed it against the nose of the ship,
saying as she did so:
"I crown thee with magnolias, brave
ship, and christen thee with a proud I
nÂ«me â Alabama."
The bow of the boat was hung with
great festoons of magaolias, gray
moss and roses gathered by the ladies
of the State of Alabama and sent here
for the occasion. Only a few hun
dred people witnessed the launching,
as against the thousands that are
usually in the yard on such occasions.
For some time past the yard has been
closed to all viaitors, and the rule was
not relaxed to any extent to-day. Fer r
of Spanish treachery has made the
Government and the Cramps extremely
cautious, as a single bomb exploded
by a hostile visitor would do almost in
calculable damage. The "war time
launching" was, for this reason, almost
a private affair.
After the Alabama had come to a i
standstill in the Delaware, tugs towed â

her back to the dock and workmen
swarmed over her, beginning at once
the work of preparing her for service.
If the armor is contracted for now and
delivered promptly, the ship will be
ready for commission within a year.
It is a curious coincidence that the
yard number of the Alabama, 290, is the
same as the yard number of the old
Alabama, built for the Confederacy In
an English shipyard during the Rebel
lion.
The Alabama is the first to be launch
ed of three battle-ships of her type,
the other two being the Illinois and
Wisconsin. She presented marked di
vergencies of design from the first
three â the Oregon, Indiana and Massa
chusetts. The differences involve
both the arrangement of the battery
and the disposition of the armor. Â«a
well as a considerable increase in size
and displacement. The first type had
the armor arranged in a water line belt
and casemate amidships, with the ends
forward and aft belt protected by sub
merged armored decks, and their bat
teries were mounted as follows: Four
13-inch guns in two turrets; eight B
inch guns in four turrets, one at each
coriier of the superstructure, and four
6-inch guns mounted at the corners of
the casemate below the superstructure.
In the Alabama the water line
armor is carried clear forward. The
protective deck, instead of being sub
merged as in former ships, is raised to
the level of the belt by slopes at each
side, the same as in protected cruisers.
The eight-inch guns of the Indiana type
are done away with entirely, the main
battery of the Alabama type consist
ing of four 13-inch guns in turrets and
fourteen 6-inch rapid-firing guns, of
which ten are mounted on the gun
deck, eight in broadside between the
turrets and two firing straight ahead
forward of the fore turret on the
gun deck. Four ajre mounted In a
small redoubt on casemate deck, two
on each side. The broadside 6-lnch
guns, instead of being mounted to pro
jecting sponsons, are mounted In reess
ports in order to secure extensive train
forward and abaft the beam.
ACCUSED OF HOISTING
THE FLAG OF SPAIN
Foreman of a Washington Mine in
Danger of Being Mobbed by
Patriotic Workmen.
SEATTLE, May 18. â A posse of four
teen deputy sheriffs left this afternoon
for the coal mining town of Issaquah,
fifteen miles distant. It was summoned
to suppress a violent demonstration if
not actual violence against W. L. New
ton, formerly a boss in the Gilman
mines.
A Spanish flag was hoisted over the
company store and Newton is charged
with the treasonable act. He was or
dered by a miners' committee to leave
the town. He announced to-day that
he would not leave alive. Public feel
ing ran high and it was feared a mob
would summarily deal with Newton to-
night.
The presence of the sheriffs has had
the effect of preventing an open out
break, although up to midnight the ex
citement was still high.

Crack Regiments of the East to

CHICAGO, May 18.â A special from
Washington says: It was officially
announced at the War Department to
day that General Merritt will have the
strongest division of 15,000 men that it
is possible to raise in the United
States. Besides the 4000 regulars which
have been assigned to his command he
will be given the pick of the troops
in the various States until his quota
has been filled.
In addition to the Tenth Pennsyl
vania,- it is probable that he will be
given one of the best regiments from
New York, a crack regiment from Ohio
and one from Michigan and a fifth
from Illinois and a sixth from Minne
sota has already been ordered to San
â¢ Francisco, while Nebraska will con
tribute one regiment to the expedition.
It is the plan to embark 1000 men as
soon as supplies can be put aboard the
City of Peking. This vanguard, which
is commanded by General Otis, will be
used for the purpose of taking pos
on of Cavite and preparing a
camp for those to follow.
It is declared to be the intention of
the administration to continue pour
ing troops into the Philippines until
there is a force sufficient to govern
every island in the group. It is ex
pected that General Merritt will leave
by Friday.
WASHINGTON, May 18.âRecogniz
;â¢>? the excellent soldier material in the
yivania troops, the War Depart
: has decided to draw on that State
: pplying in part the quota for the
I oil ;q>.:;e Islands expedition. The
Tci-th Regiment has been selected for
this work and orders have been issued
hurrying it to San Francisco, so that
the men may leave with one of the
first ships for Manila. The Tenth is
said to be the crack organization of the
State. The earlier programme contem
plated the dispatch of the regiment to
Tampa.
It is understood the department will
endeavor to give General Merritt, who
is to command the expedition, proba
bly a thousand more regulars than was
at first proposed, In which case the
Fifteenth Infantry, located in New
Mexico and Arizona, will be drawn on
unless the present programme is
changed.

BpÂ«clat Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, May 18.â Latest advices
from the South Seas contain interest
ing news anent Samoan affairs. At a
i great meeting .t the rebel scat of gov
! ernment the rebel party hoisted a new
flag with one stripe between two red
! stripes. It is said that the hoisting of
' the flag was merely a device to give the
now dormant rebel party renewed life.
Tamasesa, the rebel head or King, does
| not seem to have joined in any way in
the demonstration, nor had he signed
the notice sent to the Consuls of the
hoisting of the flag. Also the leading
chiefs of Atua, the province of the ex
\ iled King or Pretender, Mataafa, were
conspicuous by their absence from the
Seeting. That is taken to Indicate
at there is forming a distinct Ma-
I taafa parf>- which will favor the Gov
: ernment rather than the rebels.
The natives of Savaai are the more
radical/ of the rebel party. They are
f.ir war, while the Opulu people, head
! Ed by Tamas-esa, don't want to go to
' that extremity. Foreigners in discuss
ing the situation say everything seems
i to show that the stand taken by the
Presidents not to retain Mataafa is the
proper course, at any rate until the
â  rebels are disarmed. Without arms the
' rebels would subside, and there would
i be no more meetings or hoisting of
That the country should be In such a
state of discord and rebellion is a dis
grace to the three Presidents, when by
simply the display of a warship apiece
the rebels would yield up their arms
and retire to their homes. It will have
to be done some time and It was bet
ter to do it now before any outbreak
occurs with its loss of life and property,
which would be far more in the next
war than in any of the past.
News comes from New Zealand of an
outbreak of Maoris near Ohoewai. The
authorities attempted to make the
Maoris pay a tax on each of the large
number of dogs they have around the
villages, whereupon the natives went on
the warpath and burned many bunga
lows of the white residents in the vicln
| ity, besides roughly using the occu
' pants. It is understood that no lives
were taken.
Her Majesty's river gunboat Torch
has ben dispatched to the scene to put

is feared outbreaks will occur in other

RELATIONS
WITH FRANCE
Not as Cordial as the
Diplomats Desire.
RECIPROCITY IS SUSPENDED.
I NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN
BROKEN Oj:T .
It Is Evident That the Paris Govern
ment Is Influenced by Its
Sympathy for
Spain.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 18.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
While the relations between the United
States and Great Britain are being
more closely knit together those with
France are not as cordial as the au
thorities would tike. It developed to
day that there has been a practical
suspension of the reciprocity negotia
tions between the Washington and
Paris Governments, due to the action
of the Fren h authorities In increasing
the tariff duty on several American
products imported largely into France.
This increase is particularly felt by
meat shippers, who are indignant, and
protests have been made to the State
Department which have caused the de
partment to submit a formal protest
on the subject to France. In the mean
time reciprocity negotiations are lan
guishing, and it is doubtful if they will
be resumed until France has made a
satisfactory explanation of her action,
or at least has reduced the tariff to
the point it was before the existing
law went into effect.
"France increased her tariff after the
Dingley law went into effect," said an
official with whom I talked, "the object
being to take on the increase in ex
change for concessions to be given by
this Government in accordance with
the provisions of the Dingley law. To
say the least it was a rather sharp
trick. This Government was informed I
at the time the French executive re- !
commended its legislature to enact a
law providing for the imposition of in
creased duties on American products,
and the matter at the time was brought
to the attention of the Paris authori
ties, but the law was placed on the
French statute books and is now being
enforced."
It is the firm belief of the adminis
tration officials that the French atti
tude on the tariff and other questions
between the two governments is dic
tated by her sympathy for Spain, and
there is no question that the Spanish
Government is receiving her moral sup
port. If the Spanish fleet could suc
ceed in raising any part of the Ameri
can blockade of Tuba the officials have
no doubt that France would be one of
the first nations to raise innumerable
questions growing out of the alleged in
effectiveness of the blockade.
As an offset to France's attitude, that
assumed by Great Rritain is most re
freshing to the officials, and no surprise
need be expressed if the most trouble
some questions between the two gov
ernments are promtply and effectually
settled.
It is known that reciprocity nego
tiations between the I" Hod States and
Great Britain for B< uda, Bahama
and West Indian Islai a belonging to
Great Britain are progressing most sat
isfactory, and there is some reason to
believe that Canada will soon enter
into reciprocity negotiations with this
country.
Special Embassador Foster is also
busy with the Bering Sea controversy
and it is quite possible that a solution
of this question may be expected with
in the near future. one of the most
pointed fenturos of the good relations
existing between the United States and
Great Britain is the fact that Sir Ju
lian Pauncefote is a daily visitor to the
State Department and that his rela
tions with the officials of the depart
ment are of a most cordial character.
It is denied in official circles that
anything is being done looking to the
formation of an alliance between the
two countries, and it is stated that thf>
arbitration treaty is still on the shelf.

URGES TAX ON
CORPORATIONS
Turpie Thinks It Better
Than Bonds.
WOULD ISSUE GREENBACKS
APPROVES OF ASSESSING IN
HERITANCES.
Considerable Progress Made by the
Senate in Considering and
Amending the War Reve
nue Measure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 18.
The feature of to-day's session of the
Senate was the speech of Turpie (D.)
of Indiana upon the war revenue
measure. He strongly contended that
a bond issue was unnecessary; that
all the funds required for the prosecu
tion of the war could be raised through
: the proposed inheritance tax, by the
i tax on corporations, by the coinage
I of silver seigniorage and by the issue
of legal tender notes. These four
means of obtaining money would yield
to the Government during the next
j year, he maintained, fully $300,000,000,
i an amount in excess of the estimated
sum necessary for the conduct of the
war.
After an extended debate, part of
which occurred in secret executive
session, the conference report on the
bill suspending certain parts of the
I existing law relating to the purchase
lof supplies by the War Department
was adopted.
The bill permitting officers of the
regular army to accept staff appoint
ments in the volunteer army without
losing their rank or place in the regu
lar service was passsed.
When the Senate resumed consideration
of the war revenue measure Turpie (D.)
of Indiana said that the differences were
differences only in method. There was
no difference as to the purpose of sup
plying all the means and men to the
i Government to carry on the war. Tur
! pie said that the pending bill carried a
i provision for a basketful of certificates
of indebtedness in order to meet the de
ficiencies caused by the Dingley law. The
Democrats had been sharply criticized
because of the monthly deficit of the so-
I called Wilson law, but the Dingley law
was showing: similar deficits without
criticism. !\ow, Turpie said, it was pro
posed, in the pending war measure, to
take care of all the Dingley law deficits
with the certificates of indebtedness.
The question presented to Congress was
how the necessary money should be
raised. The committee was agreed that
$150,000,000 should be raised by taxation
and the remaining sum, from $120,000,000
to $150,000,000. by other means. Turpie
thought the tax on succession was one
of the best features of the bill. He said
it was a tax on accumulation, while the
tax on beer and tobacco was a tax on
consumption. Turpie strongly urged the
proposed tax on corporations. He esti
mated this tax would yield $100,000,000 and
that the inheritance provision would pro
duce $50,000,000 more. This would supply
the amount necessary to be raised. The
remaining $150,000,000 necessary could be
raised by the coinage of the silver seig- |
niorage and the issue of legal tender
notes. The majority of the Finance Com
mittee, he said, had deemed it wise to
propose the coinage of the seigniorage
in deference to the wishes of the 15,000,
000 who in the last national campaign had
made evident their desire for such coin
age.
The section of the bill providing for the
issue of greenbacks was proposed by the
majority of the committee as a substi
tute for the bond section of the bill as it
camp from the House. For the present
Turpie said the Democratic policy of the
free and unlimited coinage of silver had
been relegated to the hustings and to the
arbitrament of the ballot. He argued at
length in favor- of the issue of greenbacks
and legal Under notes, declaring that the
policy of their Issue was almost an ideal
one for the raising of money for such an
emergency as now confronted this Gov
ernment.
"It is." said he, "the most patriotic and
least expensive scheme of securing money
in a time like this known to man "
Gorman suggested that the penalty for
faHure to affix the stamp to any driip or
medicine, perfumery, etc., was too severe
The bill, as it passed the House, provided
a penalty of $]00, but the Senate commit
tee had changed this so as to make the
offense a misdemeanor punishable by a
fine of not more than $300 or imprison
ment for not exceeding six months
The provision was amended by striking
out the maximum fine, leaving it to the
discretion of the courts to make it less
than $100.
Gorman moved then to strike out the
clause providing for imprisonment.
Gray, Mills and Cullom also supported
the motion and Aldrich. Jones W Ar
kansas. Chilton, White and Cockrell op
posed it. The amendment was rejectedâ
26 to 27.
Gorman asked the Senate to return to
section five of the bill, providing that any
person willfully evading the requirement
to place revenue stamps upon any legal
document or taxed paper of any kind
should be fined not more than $500 or im
prisoned not more than six months, or
both. He moved that the fine be fixed at
$100 Instead of $500. me motion was
agreed toâ SO to 16.
Gorman then moved to strike out the
imprisonment clause. This was agreed to
without division.
On Gorman's motion the imprisonment
clauses were stricken out of sections 8
and !t. providing for the use of revenue
stamps. The Senate refused to strike out
the imprisonment feature of section 11,
which provides for the affixing of stamps
to stock transferred.
In section 15 of the bill the stamp taxes
provided for were made effective "on the
first day of June." This was amended so
as to read "on the fifteenth day of June."
The bill was then laid aside for the day
and at 5 o'clock the Senate went into ex
ecutive session and at 5:15 p. m. ad
journed. _____^____^_

BOYCOTT
FELT IN
FRANCE
That Open Sympathy for
Spain Promises to Be
Costly.
Public Expressions on the
Speech of Chamberlain Ad
vocating Anglo=Saxon
Alliance.
Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, May 18.â Mr. Chamberlain's
sensational speech is undeniably re
sponsible for the decided feeling of
nervousness here. The French press
begins to see it has adopted a mistaken
policy in declaring pronouncedly for
Spain as opposed to the United States.
The Debate, in a leader published on
Monday, tries to smooth away matters.
It admits that the English have profit
ed by France's action in this matter,
and it says: "The moment is passed to
sit in Judgment on the war. France
has never been really hostile to Ameri
cans. This will be well understood
across the Atlantic, where the present
misunderstanding has been dissipated.
Friends of Spain have something bet
ter to do than to declaim against her
utterances."
The general tone of the article is one
of fear that things have gone too far.
Businesses which depend largely for
their success upon the patronage of
Americans have already felt the effects
of the quasi campaign against the
United States In favor of Spain. The
proprietor of one of the principal ho
tels here Inveighed bitterly against the
attitude taken by the French press.
The number of Americans staying in
the hotel is sensibly less than at the
same time last year.
At Voisons, where at this season
there were usually big crowds of Amer
icans and Spaniards, there were the
other night only two diners in the
rooms. Couturieres, jewelers, millin
ers and other businesses are seeing
their season virtually ruined by the
diminished number of American
clients.
The Figaro yesterday morning tried
to turn the affair off with a laugh in an
article which says: "It Is finished.
France is -oing to be boycotted by
American millionaires and by pretty
Americans who will no longer get their
dresses from Paris."
Then in a bantering way, the writer
asks where they will get them. Cer
tainly not in London, where tailor
made costumes and bicycle skirts can
be made admirably, but a full dress
â never. Certainly not in America, and
certainly they will never consent to be
badly dressed.
"As to millionaires they will surely
come to Paris," continues the article,
"in search of more agreeable, more in
tellectual and more artistic life than is
led in America."
People are talking of a possible
Franco-English conflict. With this
fear before them, and with the prac
tical results of loss of American cus
tom staring them in the face, people
here are very gloomy in their prognos
tications, in spite of their disclaimers.
It is evident that the French look upon
the reapproachment of the English and
Americans with disquietude. It is such
a natural alliance that they realize that
it will some day be made, and they be
gin to fear they have hastened that day
by their display of hostility to the
United States over the war with Sapin.
LONDON, May 18.â Rear Admiral
Lord Charles Beresford, Conservative
member of Parliament for the City of
York, addressing the Junior Constitu
tional Club this evening, expressed his
strong approval of the Birmingham
speech of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, Sec
retary of State for the Colonies, on the
Anglo-Saxon alliance, but described it
as "'the right thing said in the wrong
way."
Lord Beresford said, as he read it.
Mr. Chamberlain's speech asked for an
alliance, and it would appear that the
alliance was one with Germany, but he
added: "If people speak in enigmas
and fail to bring a thing out straight,
they often defeat the object they have
in view."
Mr. Chamberlain meant to ask. Lord
Beresford understood, for an Anglo-
German alliance. Germany herself be
ing in danger of isolation owing to the
difficulties in Austria and Italy; the
German alliance, which would "tend to
peace and to the advancement of
trade."
As for an Anglo-American alliance,
his Lordship continued "I sympathize
with that idea also, but it seems to me
premature." â¢ >
The Americans, he declared, were
shrewd and it was not advisable that
it should appear as if Englaiffl were in
a position of difficulty and was suggest
ing an alliance for her own benefit. He
hoped, however, that such an alliance
would come.
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
Telegraph says: The flutter caused by
reports of French sympathy with Spain
has led the ladies of the American col
ony to boycott the local shops.
FRIEDRICHSRUHE, May 18.â The
cool and rainy weather has increased
Prince Bismarck's neuralgia and ag
gravated the swelling of his legs, and
he has been unable to leave his bed for
several days. Dr. Schweninger is again
here, and is disquieted about his pa
tient.
The Prince, therefore, is unable to
receive visitors, but a correspondent
from members of the family has been
able to obtain views of the former
Chancellor on the war and suggested
Anglo-Saxon alliance, as expressed by
the Prince during his most recent talk
at the table. In substance they are as
follows: Prince Bismarck condemns
CASTORIA
For Infants and Children,
the war outright. He says It Is dtw to*
systematic American provocation,
which finally became unbearable. He
added:
"The whole course of the Washing
ton administration has been insincere.
My views of war are well understood.
I have always held that it is only de
fensible after all other remedies hava
failed.
"The result of the war cannot bÂ»
wholesome either to America or Eu
rope. The United States will be forced
to adopt an intermeddling policy, lead
ing to unavoidable friction. She thus
abandoned her traditional peace policy,
and in order to maintain her position,
she must become a military and a na
val power â an expensive luxury which
her geographic position rendered un
necessary.
"America's change of front means
retrogression in the high sense of civ
ilization. This is the main regrettabla
fact about the war."
Regarding the speech made on Fri
day last by Joseph Chamberlain at Bir
mingham, Prince Bismarck said:
"The importance thereof depends
upon whether Mr. Chamberlain's pri
vate opinions are those of the British
Government. Closer Anglo-American
relations are doubtless feasible, but an
alliance is improbable and unservice
able to both.
"Besides, it is a mistake to call the
Americans Saxons. Theirs is a mixed
blood â British, Irish, German, French
and Scandinavian. The Anglo-Saxon
does not even predominate to-day.
This dwelling on so-called race inter
ests is. nonsense in politics. Look at
the Russo-French agreement and the
Dreibund. Politics are not dictated by
such far-fetched sentimentalities. Ger
many's duty, plainly, is to maintain
her interests by carefully nursing the
good neighborship of the European na
tions."
YOKOHAMA. May 19.â The press of
this city, discussing the recent speech
of Mr. Chamberlain at Birmingham,
advocating an Anglo-Saxon alliance,
expresses the opinion that the time is
ripe for the formation of an Anglo-
Japanese alliance.
SHANGHAI. May 19.â The news
papers here and public opinion in gen
eral strongly favor an Anglo-American
alliance, as proposed in the speech
which Mr. Chamberlain recently made
at Birmingham, England.
Money Sent From Argentina.
BUENOS AYRES, May 18.â It is
announced here that the Spaniards of
Argentina have telegraphed another
million francs to Madrid as a war sub
scription, and that the collection of
money for the same purpose will be
continued.
The Cadiz Fleet.
NEW YORK, May 18.â A London
special says that information has been
received that the fleet now at Cadiz
has been ordered to go direct to the
coast of Newfoundland, where coal
laden ships await it.
VITALITY is what all the
world seeks, for it is life
itself. When your vitality
is gone you die. You were
born with a certain amount
of it, and when that is ex-
hausted there is nothing for
you to do but to accept the
fate that will come to all in timeâ we must
die some day.
IT IS, however, possible to
increase your vital force,
and to increase it in a way
that will not only add years
to your life, but will make
your life again worth living 1
if you are run down, or if
your system is depleted in
any way. The evidence of this possibility
is given below.
THE first thing to be con-
sidered, though, is: Are you
losing power? Do your knees
shako ? Are you afraid of
everything that faces you?
Do you have clammy sweats?
Do "you get all down and
discouraged? Do you feel
that your back is so weak that you can do
no work? Do you feel "blue"?
ALL of these symptoms in-
dicate whnt is known to the
medical world as "loss of
vital fore.'." ;md its conse-
quences are the most seri-
ous that wo know of. Par-
tial and sometimes total
paralysis of the nervous
organs ensue from a neglect of immediate
and proper treatment for this disease.
LET your mind for a mo-
ment dwell on those symp-
toms and see as to whether
you have any one of them
or not. If you have you
can rest assured that you
are trifling with a trouble
which is to be feared
as no other trouble on earth is to be. But
if you seek relief it is at hand for you.
The Hudson Medical Institute was
founded for the express purpose of find-
ing some specific for the cure of all cases
of this sort, no matter from what cause
arising. Debilitation of this sort is
caused by a variety of things â over-
work, mental worry, and abuse of your

This circumstance, and the opinion
daily growing among thinking men
that Spain is drifting toward defeat,
may at any moment determine the for

premature to speak of peace. The sub
ject can only be whispered here. The
memory of Cavite, calling for venge
ance, is too fresh for peace yet.
Peace, if Spain is to initiate pro
posals for it, can be had only after
more fighting. The Atlantic fleet must
either be knocked to pieces or gain a
partial victory as a set-off against
Cavite before the idea of peace with
honor can really take root in this land

PRAISES THIS
LAND OF LIBERTY
WASHINGTON, May 18.â Senhor Salva
dor de Mendonca, who has represented
Brazil at Washington in the capacity of
Minister since 1891, to-day presented his
letters of recall, preparatory to being
transferred to Lisbon, Portugal. The
ceremony, which is in many cases little
more than an idle form, was in this case
remarkable from the magnificent tribute
paid to our great republic by Senhor
Mendonca, who had occupied the position
of Consul-General for Brazil at New
York for many years preceding his acces
slon to the Ministry, and has had more
abundant opportunity for just criticism
than falls to the lot of most diplomatic
representatives. The Minister said dur
ing his Bpeech:
Opening your country since the colonial
times as a land of refuge, and establishing
your commonwealth on the solid foundation of
the freedom of conscience; giving to the world
the principles of the Declaration of Independ
ence; afllrniing by the consolidation of the
union and by the abolition of slavery that this
continent was thenceforth consecrated to lib
erty, your people haa come to the front rank
aa a powerful factor of modern civilization.
Fearless before the strong, magnanimous to
ward the feeble, deeply convinced that justice
and right are the corner-stones of the state
and fairness the measure of international deal-
Ings; Industrious, intelligent, law-abiding and
peace-loving, your nation can well be proud
of its achievements, and no one has had a bet
ter opportunity than I to Batlsfy myself, by
a careful observation of men and laws, of your
steady advancement and progress. I have seen
your country in its days of Joy and of sor
row. I saw, at the celebration of the centen
ary of your independence, the past master in
the art of war open the great fair of the arts
of peace and reveal to the world the double
greatness of the nation, which in ten years
had transformed swords and guns Into imple
ments of industry- I saw the great hero laid
to rest in the heart of your great metropolis
amid the mourning of the whole land, and wit
nessed his apotheosis celebrated by the voice
of the entire union. I saw the chief magistrate
of the nation fallen by an assassin's hands,
and observed the republic continue firm and
serene under the empire of the law. In its
Joy or sorrow the nation did not depart a mo
ment from the confidence in its high destiny.
1 have visited the different regions uf your
broad land; I know the active men of the
East, the open-hearted inhabitants of the West
and the chivalrous Southerner; it has been
my fortune to meet the statesman, the scien
tist, the artist, the manufacturer, the farmer
and the workman. Wherever the duty to my
beloved country will call me I can assure you
that my heart and sympathy will be -with your
noble people and with the standard-bearers of
the republican America, which is advancing
the outposts of human freedom into the last
lntrenchments of the past.
President McKinley, replying, paid a
high tribute to the personal worth and
sterling qualities of the retiring Minister,
and expressed deep regret at his transfer
to another post, though at the same time
he congratulated Senhor Mendonca .hat
the Brazilian Government had assigned
him to another important mission, as a
further proof of confidence in his ability
and zeal.

GLADSTONE
WITH THE
MAJORITY
Continued From First Page.
to have arisen until this century- There
were men who ruled before Gladstone's
time. Walpole and Chatham kept com
mand of Parliament and directed the
affairs of the British empire with the
firm grasp of power. Smaller men
than they have also had this ruling
quality. But statesmanship now re
quires, in addition to administrative,
the legislative gift, the capacity to
shape measures which the expanding
requirements of the country dictate as
necessary. Supplementary to this the
gift of luminous exposition is almost
essential, not necessarily eloquence, but
convincing explanatory lucidity on con
crete propositions, in which the graces
of rhetoric are less evidences of wis
dom than of culture. To lead the House
of Commons to-day, to be a leader in
English politics, a man should have
the quality of originating measures,
shaping a policy and inspiring confi
dence among the masses and those
who represent them. It is a states
manship altogether different in many
respects from that which yet prevails
in the rest of Europe, where the head
of a Cabinet is still very much the
mouthpiece of the monarch, and is held
continually under restraint if he haa
broad aims of his own. An English
Ministry cannot hold office without the
confidence of the House of Commons.
In the capacity to lead the House of
Commons on every conceivable subject
of statesmanship Mr. Gladstone has
never been excelled. No one has trans
cended him in inspiring enthusiasm,
either in the House of Commons or in
the country. His is not the fame of
the dextrous juggler of policies who
confutes and triumphs by mere clever
ness, which is afterward laughed at
as shallow and tricky. Disraeli was of
this type. So different was Gladstone
that he almost gave rise to the belief
that in everything he did he had con
viction to solemnify his proposals,
whereas in reality much of his action
could only have been expediency, ac
cording to his opportunity, and not
strictly an expression of his full pur
pose or conception of what was de
sirable. He was wisely content to at
tempt the achievement of the possible,
to gain a bit at a time, and to wait for
more. No one has had a better gauge
of the pulse of the nation and the
House of Commons, or knew with truer
instinct when to act and when to wait.
The country as a whole regarded him as
a high-minded man of pure motives and
pure in all aspects of personal life.
Even in the heat of party strife the
most virulent aspersions cast on his
policy cannot be said to have assailed
his personal character. The most ran
corous of opponents during the frenzy
of the home rule struggle would admit
that in ability he had no match in Par
liament, and would take pride in him as
head and shoulders the most brilliant
man in the House of Commons. Com
pliments of the most eulogistic as well
as sincere character were in 1893 passed
upon the venerable Liberal leader, four
times Prime Minister of England, by
his often venomous opponents Mr. Bal
four and Mr. Chamberlain. A states
man of the scoffing, flippant, laissez
faire school, such as Palmerston, as
sertive and meddling in foreign but
dormant in domestic policy, is no longer
possible as a successful leader in Eng
land. A Prime Minister must work if
he is to command respect. Mr. Glad
stone toiled as never statesman before
has done, and probably the majority of
his countrymen adored him because his
oratory was not fine words alone, but
a guide to deeds.
A more healthy physique than Mr.
Gladstone's was perhaps never seen in
man. He can scarcely be said to have
had ailments in youth, middle age or
senility. Senility hardly applies to his
old age. He was youthful in feeling and
even In physical activity cimost to the
last. Sir Andrew Clark, his physician
for twenty years, declared that there
was no reason he should not see five
score. Up to within a year
his body was sound from head
to foot: his eyesight only dimmed and
his hearing impaired. He could walk
with as vigorous a stride as a young
man, erect in gait, the head carried
well and the arms swinging. His eyes,
always deep and expressive, retained
much of their fire, and although the
lines of his face fell into furrows and
pallor took the place of the former
ruddy glow, there never was any in
dication of dotard feebleness. He con
tinued to fell trees at Hawarden when
past 80. and walking was delightful to
him both as exercise and as a whet
stone to his thinking. As a young man
he must, have been strikingly hand
some. As an old man his figure and
mien distinguished him notably from
all others. It was Impossible to think
this man commonplace, wherever he
was. During at least thirty years he
was the dominating personality of the
House of Commons, the foremost
statesman of his day, compared with
whom all others were as pigmies, at
the most only eminent in departments
or specialties and not invested with his
many-sided characteristics and endow
ments.
Mr. Gladstone** career was remark
ably progressive. Just as soon as he
left Oxford in 1831, taking a double
first degree, he entered Parliament, be
ing returned for Newark in 1832, one of
those pocket family burroughs in the
practical possession of the Duke of
Newcastle. He was a Tory, but mod
erate in his party feeling a and prone
to serious views of utility in adminis
tration and legislation. With such a
temperament, education in poli
tics toward the popular side
was a process inevitable, but It
took time to step across the di
viding border line. As a devout church
man, he had very strong views on the
relationship of church and state, and
gave them literary form in a well
known work, torn to tatters as unten
able by Lord Macaulay. The progress
he made in thought on this subject is
shown in his legislative achievement
whereby the Irish church was dises
tablished, with the inevitable corollary
that all other forms of state church
establishments are doomed as soon as
the facts and the argument are strong
enough to convince the electorate. The
logic of maintaining religions endowed
out of taxes or grants by the state has
vanished.
Sir Robert Peel, of whom Mr. Glad
stone to the end of his life was a warm
admirer, exercised a great influence
over the young entrant into public life.
In 1835, three years after winning his
seat, he was a Lord of the Treasury
and then Under Secretary for the Colo
nies. In 1841 he was vice-president of
the Board of Trade and in 1843 full
president. This was rapid promotion
for a young man of 34. But he had
shown conspicuous ability in solving
those very problems of statesmanship
which were then plunging England into
throes of agitation almost as violent as
if she were in a revolution. It was Mr.
Gladstone who performed much of the
work which resulted in the repeal of
the detestable and cruel corn laws, and
in establishing free trade, the policy
which of all others has advanced Eng
land commercially in this century. The
talents of Mr. Gladstone shone con
spicuously in this legislation. He had a
mastery of commercial knowledge that
the patrician statesmanship which had
been in vogue for centuries, and which
concerned itself with the grand aims of
alliances abroad and the affairs of
courts, could not pretend to possess, and
this was combined with a ripe scholar
ship and remarkable readiness in de
bate.

free-trader cost him his seat at
Newark. His patron, the Duke of New
castle, would have no more of Toryism
of his shade. Think of such a nobody
being a patron, a mere territorial auto
crat! Mr. Gladstone went to Oxford.
His university returned him proudly as
a scholar fit to represent it, and for
eighteen years he held the seat with
confidence.
Here again the progress of his po
litical education severed the relation
ship with his constituency. His dawn
ing liberal views on church matters
were taking shape in political purpose,
and as the university constituency is
largely composed of graduates who
have entered holy orders, he had ar
rayed against him a very large pro
portion of the ecclesiastical voters, and
they overthrew him at the general elec
tion of 1865, which followed the death
of Lord Palmerston. What was Ox
ford's loss was South Lancashire's
gain. During these years his work
made a stir in Europe as well as at
home. He made known by a visit to
Naples in 1850 the infamies and bar
barities of government in the kingdom
of the Two Sicilies, and Europe rang
with the exposure. He also took the
strong ground of advocating Italian
independence, and tamed the undying
gratitude of the Italian people by his
attitude. He next went on a mission
to the lonian Islands, then in the pos
session of England, and the information
he obtained led to the cession of the
group to Greece in 1864. Two great
legislative proposals were carried. One
was the commercial treaty with
France, negotiated by Cobden, which
formed a most valuable bond of sym
pathy and trade during twenty years,
and the other was the repeal of the
duty on paper, which had operated as
a heavy tax on knowledge. It was the
removal of this impost which instantly
called into existence a number of daily
newspapers at the then unprecedented
price of 1 penny.
No man in English history has ever
held the position of Chancellor of the
Exchequer with the signal ability which
Mr. Gladstone displayed. It is the sec
ond position in the Cabinet, and ordi
narily carries with it the leadership of
the House of Commons when the
Prime Minister is a peer and is com
pelled to sit with his class in the House
of Lords. From 1852 onward, whenever
he was in office, Mr. Gladstone was
either Chancellor of the Exchequer or
Prime Minister. He was first Chancel
lor under Lord Aberdeen in 1852, a year
which marks the turning paint in hia
career. The Earl of Derby offered him
office in his short-lived Ministry, but
Mr. Gladstone declined, and his after
ward wily opponent, Bt-njamin Dis
raeli, was installed at the Exchequer.
Disraeli began as a Radical and ended
as a Tory. Gladstone began ac a Tory
and ended as a Liberal of a very broad
though not radical type. It Is curious
to note that Disraeli also preceded him
in 1868 in the honors of the Premier
ship, taking office in February and go
ing out in December, when Gladstone
succeeded. , â¢
The way was not clear for Mr. Glad
stone as Premier until Lord Palmer
ston and Earl Russell had passed
away. Other men have been at the head
of Cabinets longer, but none have been
called upon so often to form Ministries.
Thus William Pitt, from 1783 to 1801,
had a tenure of seventeen years and
eighty-four days, and was again
Prime Minister from 1804 to 1806. Lord
Liverpool also held office from 1812 to
1827, nearly fifteen years* Mr. Glad
stone's first Ministry lasted five years
and seventy-four days, hio second five
years and fifty-seven days, from 1880
to- ISBS, and his third, in 1886, hod the
brief life of 178 days. Then in 1892 he
formed his fourth Ministry, and in
1893, In his eighty-fourth year, work
ing almost harder than ever he had
done in his life, carried home rule for
Ireland through the House of Com
mons, but suffered defeat in the Lords.
Quite a number of statesmen within
this century have been Prime Minis
ter twice, and Lord Derby was the
head of three administrations, but only
Mr. Gladstone formed four Ministries.
During the greater part of his official
life, therefore, Mr. Gladstone was
chosen for the highest offices, but he
did not lead the House of Commons
until 1866, after the death of Ix>rd
Palmerston. His good qualities as
Chancellor of the Exchequer were con
spicuous in his thorough grasp of the
nation's finance and his thorough
knowledge of all affairs of commerce
and trade. Had he thrown the same
ardor into the transactions of private
business that he bestowed upon the af
fairs of the nation he would have suc
ceeded as a merchant, manufacturer
or banker in probably amassing mil
lions. But he had a moderate private
income and he was contented with that
and his official income, which had the
maximum of Â£7500 a year when he was
both Prime Minister and Chancellor of
the Exchequer.
A budget night was positively inter
esting, when Mr. Gladstone unfolded
the nation's financial position and sub
mitted proposals for fresh taxation or
the remission thereof. He alone could
make figures eloquent and luminous,
could evolve perspicuity out of debt
and interest, and weave a romance out
of trade and its fluctuations. The
House of Commons listened to his sil
very voice and followed his enuncia
tion of policy on finance with an al
most unquestioning willingness of as
sent, though the opposition was bound
to make good its constitutional status
by criticism and occasionally by hostile
votes when details were considered.
Ordinarily, a budget speech is a pos
itive torture of complexity, and dry as
dust and Mr. Gladstone may be " al
lowed the rank of genius in elevating
financial statements into fascinating
oratory. But he did more than this.
He made finance successful. He gen
erally had a reduction of taxes, or the
easing of some burden to announce,
and the revenue was usually redundant,
leaving a good surplus to be' applied to
the reduction of the national debt. He
was also careful to avoid running up
debt afresh, his aim being to meet all
expenses, whatever they were, out Â« f
current revenue. This was sound
finance which kept the country out of
embarrassment. So facile was his mas
tery of resource, that his budgets were
in striking contrast to those of the
Tories, who rarely did anything to re
duce debt and frequently added to it
by wasteful muddling, with the result
that when they went out of office they
left deficits as legacies, not nest eggs,
as did the Liberals.
As Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone's
first term of five years from 1868 was
one of remarkable energy. He swept
away the Irish church as a state es
tablishment, dealing with it generous
ly, but taking from it such endowments,
amounting to millions, as were cleanly
public property, and devoting them to
national uses. The outcry was great,
but the church itself has benefited. An
Irish land measure and a complete
change of the educational system of the
whole country were part of the legis
lative programme. The legislation, in
fact, was so startling to the country,
.jvhicb. had, &Apjv-Â» nothing; of earnest-.
nesg and herculean labor In domestic
reforms under other Ministries, that
discontent had gradually been foment
ing, and when Mr. Gladstone asked for
the confidence of the country in 1874 on
fresh prooosals of beneficial finance, he
found he had lost it. Mr. Disraeli took
office and was in Downing street until
the spring of 1880.
There is some reason to believe that
Mr. Gladstone at this time contemplat
ed retirement from politics. He did
remain in the House of Commons, but
not as leader of the Liberal opposition.
He abdicated his functions in favor of
Lord Hartington, and, as the phrase
went, was Achilles sulking in his tent.
It thus happened that when Lord Bea.
consfield was defeated at the election
In 1880, Lord Hartington was asked to
form a Ministry, but declined. The
victory had been won by Mr. Glad
stone in the Midlothian campaign. Suc
cessively he had been ousted from Lan
cashire and from Greenwich as constit
uencies, and he had repaired to Ed
inburgh and the county of Midlothian
for a seat, and there he delivered a
series of speeches so stirring and pow
erful that they made the whole country
ring with the enthusiasm of Liberalism,
and the Tories were routed everywhere
decisively. The majority at Mr. Glad
stone's back for his second Ministry
was beyond precedent.
This was also a hard-working Parlia
ment. Two or three Radicals for the
first time joined the Ministry, including
Sir Charles Dilke, Mr. Chamberlain and
Mr. Mandella. Almost an avalanche of
legislation was set in motion, and much
of it related to Ireland. Another Irish
land bill was carried to remedy defects
in the former one, mostly due to the
selfish landlordism of the House of
Lords. The question of home rule was
now taking shape "nder Mr. Parnell's
leadership of the then limited but de
termined Irish party, and Irish difficul
ties contributed in no small degree to
run down Mr. Gladstone's majority
and introduce dissension into the Min
istry. Mr. Bright resigned from con
scientious objections to be in any sense
responsible for the war in Egypt to
suppress Arabi's rebellion, and Mr.
Forster, who had been plotted against
basely by Mr. Chamberlain, resigned
because a halt was called to coercion in
Ireland under his Secretaryship. Lord
Frederick Cavendish succeeded Mr.
Forster, and upon going to Ireland to
begin his duties was, along with
Under Secretary Burke, murdered in
Phoenix Park by the Invincibles. This
atrocity had the effect of canceling
all Irish reform proposals at the mo
ment. At the death of his attached
friend Frederick Cavendish, Mr. Glad
stone was deeply moved. He had con
fidence in his capacity and sincerity
for his position, and had probably some
complete change of policy In view when
selecting him. His first sentence in
moving the adjournment of the House
of Commons after the event was, A
heart that was full of love for Ireland
has ceased to beat."
The Tories came to power again in
1885 under Lord Salisbury, bu\ in the
following year, under a reformed elec
torate and a complete change of con
stituencies, which now return as far as
possible single members, both in coun
ties and boroughs, Mr. Gladstone took
the Premiership for the third time and
broached his home rule proposals for
Ireland. The Irish Nationalists now
numbered over 80 out of 103 members
returned by Ireland, and the question
had assumed an entirely new phase. It
was the paramount question of vital
politics and must be faced. By means
of obstruction or filibustering Mr. Par
nell had hamstrung the House of Com
mons pretty much as he pleased from
1880 onward, and had easily evaded all
the rules of debate framed tc suppress
obstruction. Mr. Parnell was still the
master, and what might he not do with
eighty-five members behind him? The
Premier's measure split the Liberal
party up and dissolved his majority.
Defections broke out in the Cabinet
and in the rank and file. Mr. Cham
berlain was one of those who severed
allegiance, and from that day drifted j
farther and farther apart from Liber- â 
alism, and joined the Tories under ;
their disguise of Liberal Unionist. The
home rule bill was defeated by the
weak-kneed Liberals and the solid
phalanx of Tories, and then for six
years Mr. Gladstone and his party
were out of office, and Lord Salisbury
was Prime Minister. When Mr. Glad
stone again formed a Ministry in 1892
he had a substantial majority of 42,
including the Irish vote. This was proof
assuring that the education of the
constituencies on the Justice of his so
lution of the Irish question had pro
ceeded favorably. In spite of numer
ous difficulties and a malignantly bit
ter opposition which went far to strip
the House of Commons of its traditions
of being composed of gentlemen, Mr.
Gladstone carried his home rule meas
ure brilliantly. It went to the Lords,
and they killed it by a vote never be
fore heard of in the largeness of its
majority, but Mr. Gladstone declined
to recognize' a club of Tories as of any
welght against representatives re
turned by constituencies, and refused
to dissolve Parliament at their behests.
Only the desire to do justice to Ire
land kept Mr. Gladstone in power at
an advanced age. His heart was in
this work with transcendent intensity.
It was the aim of his life to heal the
wounds inflicted by England on the
sister island, and he has succeeded to
a great extent, and thereby assisted
very materially in giving stability to
the British empire. Irishmen recog
nized his sincerity of purpose, but dis
puted the completeness of his meas
ures, and it was only when home rule
took practical shape that the Na
tionalists were for the most part in ac
cord with him.
The extraordinary fascination which
Mr. Gladstone exercised over the House
of Commons can only be judged of ac
curately by those who have observed
him in his place on the right or left of
the Speaker, as the case might be, when
in or out of office. To listen to him
was to be under a spell. His voice
was silvery, but sonorous, everywhere
heard in clear tones. Always his sub
ject was well marshaled, and his sen
tences flowed in'unimpeded mellifluous
ness with nicelyadjusted inflections and
emphasis, aided by impressive but not
too demonstrative gestures, varying
from the lifting of the hand or the
pointing of a finger to an emphatic slap
of the palm on the box at the table,
but this rarely, and, as it were, in a
paroxysm of clinching earnestness.
His face in speech was a delightful
study. His fine, lustrous eyes flashed
with animation and every feature was
stamped with concentration of feeling.
On great occasions he was a grand ac
tor in exposition, debate, retort and
generalship, easily leaving all oppon
ents dwarfed and beaten, at least in
the style of the combat. What sur
prised in the man was his versatility,
his marvelous command of illustration
and precedent, his felicit-"- as well as
fertility. No other parliamentarian
could make so graceful a speech on
occasions when votes of thanks were
needed, or votes of money had to be
showered upon royal heads or compli
PAINFUL INJURY
TO "BOB" EVANS.
Copyrighted, 1898. by Jaxnw Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST. May 18.â Captain Evans of the battle-ship lowa met
with a painful accident and narrowly escaped losing his life. As a
result of it his right arm Is now in a sling, but "Fighting Bob" la still
on duty.
The accident occurred when the lowa was casting off the hawser of
a vessel she had temporarily taken in tow. The line, whipping:
across her deck, capsized a 600-pound battle hatch which had been stood
edgewise near the hatchway and sent it crashing into the cabin oe
low.
Almost directly beneath Captain EvanÃ and Lieutenant-Comman
der Kimball were seated at a table. The heavy piece of metal wrecked
the table, and, toppling over, struck Captain Evans, badly bruising the
muscles of his shoulder and causing a severe contusion of the right
arm. No bones were broken.
ments paid them in addresses. In mat
ters of solemnity as well as light and
happy touches of oratory he was su
preme in saying the right thing free
from all gaucheries or embarrassment.
He was chivalrous, gentlemanly and
courteous, and never descended to vul
garity, buffoonery or cruelty in his ut
terances. Furthermore, he seemed al
ways to feel that what he was saying
was right, and the listener had not the
feeling that he was listening to rhetoric
or the subterfuge of hollow unreality.
The statesman spoke from his head
and heart.
It would be misleading to assume that
all Mr. Gladstone's utterances were free
from the blemish of ambiguity. No
man knew better than he how to cloud
meaning or no meaning in a load of
phrases which sounded well at the mo
ment, but were a labyrinth of doubt
when perused in cold print. As a tac
tician he had no doubt reasons for re
serve and mystification. On the other
hand, when his course was clear his
language was lucidity itself, probably
copious and well rounded in rhythmic
elegance, but apropos and unambigu
ous. Few public speakers have the
gift such as he in eminence possessed
of being able to carry an impromptu
sentence over twenty or thirty lines
of print without a jar in construction
or a flaw in grammar. His accuracy
was not only in sentences, but in col
umns. There was no need of remod
eling in his sentences.
To estimate Mr. Gladstone solely as
a public man in Parliament would
omit much of the man's greatness. He
was a scholar, a many-sided man of
culture, and very broad in his sympa
thies with all that is noble and good
in life. His knowledge of the classics
was profound and critical, but he was
equally at home in modern languages
and literature, and even the Welsh
tongue was not strange to him. It
would be difficult to mention a domain
of research, outside of modern science,
into which he had nm penetrated and
made good his title as an explorer. His
"Gleanings" and a number of other
works attest his acumen and graces as
an author, and his lectures and pam
phlets are equally remarkable for in
tellectual vigor and range of thought.
As a conversationalist he Was one of
the most charming of men in company,
but was perhaps carried away too
much into a monopoly of the talking, a
trait which characterized Macaulay
and Carlyle and is only excusable
among the giant thinkers. In conversa
tion he was far from being a grave
man. He was often delightfully enter
taining and jocose, especiallly in anec
dotes and reminiscences. In all walks
of life Mr. Gladstone was pure and un
flinchingly honorable, and was be
loved of his family, and almost wor
shiped by hosts of admirers and
friends. It is the lot of few to have
wielded such vast power and influence,
and to have used his opportunities with
rare wisdom and magnanimous pur
pose. He undoubtedly passes away the
greatest English statesman of his gen
eration, a colossal figure in an age of
distinguished men.
Joins Stanford's Faculty.
PALO ALTO, May 18.â Dr. Jordan to
day announced the appointment of Dr.
Frank Felter, now professor of economics
and social science in the Indiana Uni
versity, to a place in the economics de
partment of Stanford, made temporarily
vacant by the departure of Dr. Ross, who
will spend his year's leave of absence in
research abroad. Professor Feltor is a
graduate of the Indiana University, lie
received his Ph. M. at Cornell in 1892 and
his Ph. D. at Halle in 1804. After one
year's experience as instructor in Cornell
he accepted a position as professor of
economics and social science at the In
diana University. He will arrive in the
fall of this year and divide the work of
the department with Dr. Durand.
Fell From the Boof.
Last night Officers Naylor and Meredith
made a raid on a Chinese lottery resort
located at 915 Stockton street. They found
two men in the room marking tickets,
who made the customary rush to the roof
to avoid the officers. One of them stepped
on an iron gutter and fell to the ground,
a distance of twelve feet, breaking his
leg in the fall. He was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital, where he
gave the name of Chow Woo.

California College Graduates.
OAKLAND, May 18.â The graduating
exercises of the academic department of
California College were held to-night. The
attendance was the largest in years and
taxed the capacity of the house. The
themes of the graduates were as follows:
"True American Citizenship," T. E.
Boekenoogen; "An Innumerable Com
panj'," Stella Eshleman; "Those Who
Think Must Govern Those Who Toil,"
Charles Garth; "Productive Industry,"
George H. Hampson; "Westward the Tide
of Empire," D. W. Hobson; "The Minis
try of Physical Science," Aaron Jackson;
"To-Day Is a King in Disguise," Gertrude
Johnson; "The Barbarity of National Ha
tred," Eluena Lutts; "Faithfulness to
Life's Common l-.ings,'-' Edith Morrison;
"The Genesis and Genius of American
Liberty, " E. J. Whitam; "The Heroism of
Scientific Research," Anna E. Wheaton.
D. W. Hobson created the most favor
able Impression by his delivery, but Mis 3
Johnson fairly outdid herself in her ora
tion. The sentiments of Miss Lutts re
garding the cruelties of Spain were lust
ily applauded. The entire programme
was of the highest order.
President Johnson conferred the diplo
mas. At 10 o'clock to-morrow morning
the college commencement exercises are
to be held, followed by the dinner.

SURROUNDED by the smoke of
her guns, and followed by the
cheers of the hundreds of work
men of the navy yard. the
Charleston steamed away from
Mare Island yesterday afternoon on her
mission of r^ace and war.
As sh** swung: into the stream the
men gathered along the quay, and cheer
after cheer was sent up for the ship
and her errand. The band played the
"Star Spangled Banner," and the peo
ple of Vallejo gathered on the wharves
to wish her jeood-by. Steaming down
past the Independence where flies the
flaT of Admiral Kirkland, her men were
called to quarters, and her guns belch
ed forth a salute of thirteen, and the
Independence answered with eleven, for
Captain Glass is entitled to at least
that. There was plenty of smoke and
plenty of noise and men cheered and
bugles blew their prettiest, but it was
now different from the ordinary going
away, for the Charleston is in her war
paint, and her journey to the Pacific
Islands is not merely for the purpose
of bringing stores to Dewey's fleet. She
carries shot and shell as well as blank
charges, enouj h and to spare for her
self and all of Dewey's vessels; she has
compasses and ship stores; commissary
stores, paymaster's stores and coal
piled high in her bunkers. She is far be
low the draft that was intended for her
â when she was built, but if she makes
the speed her officers hope she will float
light as a duck by the time ehe gets to
Manila. She will empty her bunkers
nearly before she gets to Honolulu, and
there she will coal again; that will take
her to the Philippines.
She headed for Red Rock as soon as
Bhe straightened out Into the channel
after leaving the yards, and arriving
there she swung around between the
rock and Angel Island until her com
passes had been corrected and the er
rors recorded. Then she went to the
stream off Angel Island and anchored.
She was down by the head, and a
good part of the night was spent in
trimming cargo. Besides there was a
gale blowing outside during the early
part of the evening and Captain Glass
did not like to take the ship out while
the sea was high and she was drawing
so much water. She will be away this
morning, however, and within six
days, if Captain Glass has prophesied
correctly, she will have reached tho
Hawaiian Isles. It will take her at
least two days to coal, if not more, and
th^n away for the Philippines. She
expects to be with Dewey within
thirty days.
The Charleston is ready to fight un
til she sinks. She has been out of com
mission for several months and has
been put in thorough repair. She is
not a heavy vessel, her tonnage being
but 3700, but she carries a battery sim
ilar to that of the Boston â six six
inch guns on her broadside batteries
and an eight-inch in bow and stern
capable of train to either side or dead
ahead. On her trial trip she made over
eighteen knots, and she carries a crew
ot nearly 300 men. She fs a "protected"
cruiser of the second class, and she is
able to give an account of herself
wherever she goes. Should she get
into a flght in the Philippines she will
t>e the second of the Califomian built
chips to strike a blow for the flag.
The Charleston's officers are: Captain
Henry Glass, commanding; Lieutenant
Gottfried Blockllnger, executive officer;
Lieutenant William Braunersreuther,
navigator; Lieutenants Frank M. Bost
"wiek, George R. Slocum, Robert E.
Coontz; Ensigns William A. Moffett

Officers of every grade from major

Recognizing the widespread popular
Interest in all that relates to the Philip

Issued in advance of the regular date
of publication the latest report from
our Consul at Manila, together with
other information on the general sub
ject of the commerce and industries of
the group. The report is of more than
ordinary importance and should be read
by all who wish to have a knowledge
of the Industrial conditions of the is
lands and their value as a market for
American trade.
Consul Williams says:
Local and European authorities eatiK
for Manila on the steamship City of
Peking. Other organizations will sail
on the Australia and City of Sydney,
but the two regiments named will con
stitute the head of the column for the
Philippines. It is announced that Gen
eral Otis and Lieutenant C. L. Potter,
engineer corps, will go on the City of
Peking.
Early yesterday forenoon General
Otis, General Merriam and other offi
cers inspected the Australia, City of
Sydney and City of Peking. The in
specting officers noted with gratifica-
tion the excellent arrangements on the
Australia for the comfort of officers
and enlisted men.
It was said that the Peking would
be ready to receive troops to-morrow
night, hence it is possible that the ship
may sail next Saturday or Sunday.
The battalions of the Second Regi
ment Oregon United States Volunteers
that arrived yesterday made such an
excellent impression at army head
quarters and seem to be so thorough
ly equipped for active service in the
field that no surprise need be expressed
if this regiment should be selected for
immediate dispatch to the Philippine
Islands.
General Otis also visited the Bay Dis
trict grounds, where camp for incom
ing regiments has been laid out. His
tour of informal inspection took in the
Presidio, where he glanced at the men
of the Fourteenth Regular Infantry
and First California Volunteers. The
morning reports of men for duty were
observed to get a hint as to the num
ber of effective soldiers in each regi
ment.
It was stated at department head
quarters yesterday that no orders had
been received from Washington re
garding the Manila expedition: "You
can see what is going on," said Gen
eral Merriam. "Orders have not been
issued here assigning General Otis to
the command of the troops encamped
at the Presidio. He will have his
command when the troops go."
At the Presidio yesterday there was
delight expressed over the news that
the headquarters' band and Troops L
and M of the Fourth United States
Cavalry had been ordered from Walla
Walla to San Francisco. There will
be music in the air when the mounted
band of the Fourth comes to town.
Artillerymen of the Third United
States Regiment and troopers of the
Fourth United States Cavalry are in a
state of suspense. They would like to
know definitely whether they are to go
to the Philippines or remain in this
country. The officers and men can
not be blamed for desiring to know, for
even if they are soldiers they are hu
man beings who want a day or two for
individual preparation.
Reports concerning the arrival of
trains bearing troops are somewhat
conflicting. At army headquarters in
the Phelan building the Southern Pa
cific representatives are depended upon
to impart notice relating to the move
ment of troops on the rail. At last ac
counts regiments were scheduled to ar
rive as follows:
Nebraska regiment on train of four
sections, due in San Francisco to-mor
row morning.
Colorado regiment, in train of four
sections, 46 officers, 976 enlisted men
and 14 horses, due to arrive to-morrow
morning.
Thirteenth Minnesota, in four sec
tions, to arrive to-morrow.
Twentieth Regiment of Kansas Vol
unteers, 45 officers and 964 enlisted men,
train in four sections, to arrive to-mor
row morning.
The Third Battalion of Washington
Volunteers Is expected to arrive some
time to-day.
The representatives of the Red Cross
Society or other organizations charged
with the duty of meeting the incoming
regiments should get a verified sched
ule from the Southern Pacific to-day.
It Is possible that some of the trains
may arrive late to-night. The troops
from Colorado, Nebraska, Minnesota
and Kansas will go into camp at the
Bay District grounds on First avenue.
The easy line of march is up Market
street and out Golden Gate avenue.
The Washington Volunteers retired
last evening at the usual hour at the
Fontana warehouse, the scare about
the safety of the building having en
tirely subsided.
The Third Battalion Is expected here
to-day, accompanied by Colonel John
H. Wholly, who is in command of the
regiment. Colonel Wholly was for
merly a lieutenant In the regular army.
He was stationed at Seattle for a long
time as recruiting officer, and later was
military instructor in the State Univer
sity of Washington. He has the repu
tation of being an excellent disciplina

in a land and sea area of about 1300 miles
of latitude and 2400 miles of longitude.
To this general description given by
the Consul the State Department adds
the following note:
ThÂ«re are about 25,000 Europeans resi
dent in the islands (the total population
is nearly 8,000,000), of coursu not counting
the troops. Some 12,000 are established in
the capital. Manila, the center of the co
lonial government. English, Spanish and
German houses are engaged in trade, ad
vancing money to the natives on their
crops Such business methods involve
risks and necessitate large capital in the
beginning, but the profits are immense.
The land is fertile and productive, and
lacks only intelligent cultivation. Abaca
(manila hemp) is one of the chief sources
of wealth of the country- Sugar cane
does not give as satisfactory returns, ow
inc- largely to the ignorance of planters,
average production is 178,000,000 kilo
grams (175.186.9fi tons), while that of Cuba
is eaual to 720,000,000 kilograms. The su
*ar goes almost entirely to Japan. Eng
land and the United States. It is of poor
aualitv and very cheap. The cultivation
of tobacco is one of the most important
industries, although it Is capable of much
greater development. The native coffee,
although not equal to the mocha or bour
bon varieties, has a fine aroma. It goes
chiefly to Spain. Cocoa trees grow in
abundance, and the oil is used for light
ing houses and streets. The indigo is fa
mous for its superior qualities. The in
habitants are apathetic to a degree that
is noticeable even in these countries,
where every one Is averse to exertion.
The women have long and Blender fin
gers, remarkably fine and sensitive, and
well adapted to their work. The hats and
cigarette holdera tWfey make and the art -
cles they embroider are models of deli
cacy. Cotton spinning and work in bam
too are amoDt thÂ« chief Industries.

LOS ANGELES, May 14, 1898.
Adjutant A. W. Barrett. California Hotel,
San Francisco. Cal. â Dear Sir: The employes
of our firm, desiring to show their friendship
for the members of the Seventh Regiment of
this section, who were lately mustered into the
United States service, have had made a mag
nificent stand of regimental colors which they
will send you via Wells, Fargo A Co.'s ex
press, to reach you Monday morning.
Knowing your kindly feelings toward the
people of this section we have taken the lib
erty of sending it to you and would request
that you present it to the Seventh Regl
ment before their departure from San Fran
cisco, conveying; to them, as well, the hearty
food wishes and blessings of their friends in
outhern California, particularly those through
whose efforts this little expression Is made
manifest. Very truly.

FOR HUMANITY AND THE MAINE.
The trying ordeal through which our Gov
ernment 1b passing and the dangers to which
our frlenda and acquaintancesâ the Seventh
Regiment. California United States Volunteer
Infantryâ will be exposed while serving our
country, liberating the oppressed and protect
ing our homes, has aroused within us a desire
to show our appreciation of the sacrifices they
are making lor honor's sake, by presenting
them with regimental colors, upon which they
can look during turmoil and strife or quiet
ness of camp life with the feeling that the
friends at home are with them in spirit and
sympathy.
We the undersigned employes of A. Ham
burger & Sons, desire to participate in the
uurchase of regimental colors to be presented
to the Seventh Kegiment, California I nitPd
States Volunteer lntantry, before their de
parture for the seat of war. and maj its folds
ever remind them of the tender sympathies
which inspire the gift.

ant Smith was formerly adjutant of the
Fifth Infantry and his appointment cre
ated some opposition among a few of the
officers. One major left his battalion to
personally protest against the appoint
ment to the Governor. Of course his pro
test was without effect, and the proper
rebuke for his unwarranted interference
would have been to order him to his quar

THE FONTANA BUILDING.
Army and Call Experts Pro-
nounce the Structure Safe
and Sound.
All fears for the safety of the troops
stationed at Fontana Barracks have been
allayed by the official report of Captain
George Buhlen, U. S. A., chief quarter
master of the Department of California,
who, in company with Mr. F. J. H. Ric
kon, a civil engineer and draughtsman
on duty with the department here, made
a thorough inspection of the building
and pronounces the same to be not only
safe, but unusually strong.
The cracking noises heard, which
caused the heavy artillery to vacate the
warehouse, are attributed to thÂ© fact that
the wood is "checking" from the heat en
The ConÃUl further reports:
During the quarter ended December 31,
1897, there were exported from these isl
ands to the United States and Great Brit
ain 216,898 bales of hemp (280 pounds per
bale), of which 138,792 bales went to the
United States and only 78,106 bales to
Great Britain. During the year 1897 there
was an increase in the export of hemp
from the Philippines to Continental
Europe of 19,741 bales; to Australia, 2192
bales; to China, 28 bales; to Japan, 2628
bales; and to the United States, 133,896
bales â a total increase of 158,485 bales, ;
while to Great Britain there was a de- ;
crease of 22,348 bales. Thus, of increased
shipments from the Philippines, those to
the United States were 544 per cent
greater than to all other countries com
bined. Of the total exports of hemp from
the Philippines for the ten years ended
1897, amounting to 6,528,965 bales (914,055
tons), 41 per cent went to the United
States.
During the same years the Philippine
Islands exported to the United States and
Europe 1,582,904 tons of sugar, of which
875,150. tons went to the United States,
666,391 tons to Great Britain and 41.362
tons to Continental Europe; showing that
of the total exports more than 55 per
cent went to the United States.
At the current values in New York of
hemp (4 cents per pound) and of raw
sugar (3% cents per pound), the exports
of these two products alone from these
Islands to the United States, during the
ten years under review, amounted to
$89,263,722 80, or an average of nearly
18,926,372 per year.
From these statistics It will be seen
that the general trend of Philippine
trade has been of late toward the
United States. Nearly the whole of the
increase of commerce has Deen with us.
There is. however, a striking exception
to this rule to be found in the sugar
trade. In that staple the decline of
Philippine exports to this country has
been extraordinary. In 1889 we import
ed from the Philippine group 2,135,443
piculs (140 pounds) of sugar, and from
that point the importation slowly de
clined until 1896, when we Imported 1,
305,882 piculs. In the succeeding year
the Importation dropped suddenly to
342,540 piculs. This decline in the sugar
imports shows to what extent home
production is now supplying Amerioan
needs and points to the near approach
of a time when we shall not have to
gendered by a number of stoves recently
placed in the quarters of the heavy ar
tillery by the Bed Cross Society. As the
building had not been occupied for some
time the wooden stringers and pillars
supporting the different floors had ab
sorbed considerable moisture which the
heat of the stoves, together with the ven
tilation of the building, caused to evap
orate rapidly and in so doing the shrink
ing of the timbers naturally resulted in
their becoming checked.
Lieutenant Colonel W. J. Fife, com
manding the First and Second Battalions
of Washington Volunteers, together with
a number of carpenters and masons, made
a hurried inspection of the quarters, and
after consulting with the officers of the
two battalions concluded that there was
no danger of the building collapsing, and
were soon wrapped in peaceful slumber,
glad to know tnat the comforts which
they have enjoyed since coming here will
not be taken from them. Colonel Fife
even sent a request to General Merriam
asking that the Washington troops be
permitted to remain in their present quar
ters, which request General Merriam
granted as soon as he ascertained the
safety of the building.
The removal of the heavy artillery was
done before any inspection of the prem
ises had been made. When the noise
caused by the checking of the timbers
was first brought to Captain Geary's at
tention he deemed it wise to use every
precaution against any danger that might
exist, and was perhaps hyper-sensitive for
the safety of his men, as subsequent
events disclosed.
The removal of the four batteries of the
heavy artillery to the Presidio Barracks
yesterday was in compliance with in
structions heretofore received by Major
Rice, the commanding officer of the bat
talion, to take station at the Presidio im
mediately upon receipt of uniforms. As
the men were supplied yesterday the or
der was necessarily obeyed.
As soon as the matter of the supposed
insecurity of the warehouse was brought
to the attention of General Merriam he at
once ordered a thorough investigation to
be made by Captain Ruhlen, who, after
fully satisfying himself from an expert
inspection of the premises, made the fol
lowing detailed report:
Headquarters Department of California â Office
of the Chief Quartermaster.
SAN FRANCISCO, May IS. IS9S.
The Adjutant-General, Department of Call
forna â Sir: I have the honor to report that,
in company with F. J. H. Rickon. civil en
gineer and draughtsman or. duty in this office,
T proceeded , to the Fontana * Co. warehouse,
near Fort Mason, in this city, to investigate
certain reports relative to alleged deficiencies
in the strength of that building.
I examined every Moor of the building, accom
panied by Lieutenant-Colonel \V. J. Fife, com
manding the First and Second Battalions of
Washington Volunteers, now quartered there,
and by Mr. Ricki>n. from the basement to the
top, and found nowhere any indication of weak
ness.
The walls of the first story are of hard brick,
laid In cement mortar, and are 'it inches thick;
those on the fourth story are 17 inches thick.
The wooden columns suporting the floor beams
rest on massive brick piera laid In cement mor
tar, capped with a iarge stone.
The building 1b constructed on the best sys
tem of so-called mill construction. All its
walls, floor beams nr.tl trusses are of extraor
dinary strength, and in my judgment it will
accommodate on each floor, with perfect com
fort and safety, a regiment of 1000 men.
The supports of the floor beams are heavy
wooden columns extending from the basement
piers to the third floor. Owing to the fact
that the building has b*en unoccupied for some
time these columns ami some of the beams
have become damp. The checking caused by
shrinkage due to the hpat from adjacent stoves
probably produced the cracking noises paid to
have been heard by pome of the occupants.
Colonel Fife authorizes me to say thnt pre
vious to my arrival he had caused an examina
tion to be made by some of the men of his
command who are experienced mill contractors,
lumbermen and builders, and had arrived at
the conclusion that there was not the slightest
cause for alarm, and he fully concurs in the
opinion herein expressed that the building is
not only safe, but unusually strong.

Yesterday before the army inspection
was made The Call'? expert was in
structed to examine the builrtinp and pre
sent a report. An examination was made
according to instructions and the follow
ing report submitted:
All the posts are of Oregon pine, 12 Inches In
diameter and perfectly sound. There are 27
posts that show season cracks, possibly caused
by the heat from stoves. The floor above is
supported by stringers, 12x12. resting on the
tops of the posts, and only one of these shows
sign of a recent crack, and this was at a
point where it was heavily ironed. Each post
U> a single tree and the cracks in no place ex
tend beyond the heart of the tree, and it would
be Impossible for them to collapse.
The first floor Ik not occupied. The artillery
troops were on the second floor. The two floors
above are occupied by the Washington troops
Major Carr of the Washington Battalion, who
Is a practical builder, pronounces the building
Â»afe in every respect. Â»Captain C. F Miller of

The Netherlands have 12,000 square
miles, being about the combined area of
Massachusetts and Connecticut
arrival of two battalions of the Second
Oregon and the presentation of a stand
of colors to the Seventh California.
The Oregon troops were expected to ar
rive early In the morning, and at 6 o'clock
Lieutenant Colonel Yoran had the battal
ion already in camp on the way to the
ferry to escort their comrades out to the
reservation. The Red Cross Society and
a band provided by the Merchants' Asso
ciation also went down to welcome the
soldiers, and waited for hours, but they
did not come.
Finally word was received that one Dat
talion had reached Oakland mole, and
was being held there to await the arrival
of the special bearing the second battal
ion. The Red Cross representatives im
mediately crossed the bay and supplied
the troops with an abundance of coffee
and sandwiches, their thoughtfulness be
ing thoroughly appreciated by the men.
At 2 o'clock the second section pulled into
the mole and the men were quickly
marched on the ferry boat and brought
to this side, the Red Cross people provid
ing for the late comers on the trip across
the bay. At Market street the escort re
ceived the troops, and after the baggage
had been loaded on trucks the troops
began the march to the Presidio.
They wore in heavy marching order,
and as they marched up Market street
and Golden Gate avenue to Van Ness
their soldierly bearing won for them
hearty plaudits from the citizens. Several
stops were made to rest, and it was near
ly 5 o'clock when the column reached the
Lombard street entrance to the Presidio.
The regimental band struck up a patri
otic march, and as Colonel Summers and
his command passed down the road the
different guards were turned out and sa
luted, while the men in camp lustily
cheered the Oregonians.
Arrived at their camp site, the men im
mediately began to pitch tents, and In a
surprisingly short time they were ready
for the supper that was awaiting their
onslaught. The Oregon troops are by far
the best equipped of any of the volun
teers that have gone into camp, so far as
camp equipage is concerned, and in con
sequence they will be spared many of the
hardships the Californians had to endure
at first. They are a splendid body of men
and look like fighters from the ground up.

OTIS ON THE GROUND.
The General Holds an Informal
Inspection of the Troops
in Camp.
General E. S. Otis, U. S. A., accom
panied by Major Moore, Adjutant General
Sehon and Lieutenant C. L. Potter, En
gineer Corps, U. S. A., drove out to the
Presidio yesterday afternoon for the pur
pose of informally inspecting the camp
and taking a look at the troops. General
Otis visited the various headquarters of
the different regimental commands in or
der to make inquiries regarding their
present supplies and equipments. His
visit was a purely informal one, and w;is
not attended with any ceremonies.
There has been an attempted scare in
camp caused by the circulation of reports
I that there were several eases of dlph-
I theria in the brigade hospital, the men
being members of the First Regiment.
'The rumor is most indignant ly denied by
Major McCarthy and his assistants.
There are several oases in the brigade
' hospital of torisilitis, but absolutely no
! diphtheria. One private in Company A of
I the Oregon Volunteers has a case of
I measles, but he contracted them before
!he came here. He lias been isolated and
| there is no danger of an epidemic.
The colors donated by the San Fran
: cisco Chamber of Commerce to the First
H<-giment will be presented at 1:30 o'clock
: this afternoon by Hugh Craig, the presl
: dent of the chamber. They will be re
; celved by Colonel Smith on behalf of the
i regiment and be turned over to B Com-
! pany.
The cadets of the Mount Tamalpais
Military Academy, sixty strong, under
; the command of Captain Hogg, visited
' the camp yesterday. The boys made a
' most soldierly appearance, and were
I greatly interested with all they saw.
' Among the cadets was Private Ye, a son
of Minister Ye, who has charge of for
eign affairs for his nation at K.ore^.; and
Private Guiterez, a son of the President
of Salvador.
Father McKinnon performed his first
duty yesterday as chaplain of the First,
vrhrn he married Private W. C. Walsh
of Company H to Miss Elizabeth Greg
gins. The ceremony was performed in
tho chaplain's tent. Walsh desired to
make his sweetheart his bride before
braving the dangers and uncertainties of
! the fortunes of war.
Battalion drill was dispensed with in
the Fourteenth yesterday, and the com
panies were drilled in extended order.
The other regiments had battalion, com
pany and squad drills as usual.
NEW CAMPING GROUND.
The Bay District Race Track
Ground Will Accommo
date 10,000 Troops.
All the available ground at the Presidio
has been taken up and hereafter all in
coming troops will camp on the grounds
of the old Bay District race track. This
tract of land, which has been divided into
blocks, and each block enclosed with a
three-board fence three feet high, is an
ideal camping ground. It is easily ac
cessible by the street car lines and the
sanitary conditions could not be better.
The soil is sandy and readily absorbs all
rain and moisture, thus rendering the
camp dry and healthy. The Spring Valley
Water Company yesterday began the lay
ing of water pipes throughout the tract
and will have the work completed inside
of three days. The pipe is eight inches in
diameter and the tirst installment con
sists of 1300 feet, running from First ave
nue to Fifth avenue, and the balance will
be laid as rapidly as the demand re
quires, so that there will be an ample sup
ply of water.
The selection of this camping ground
was first made by Major Field, adjutant
general of the Department of California,
and Lieutenant Neall of tho Fourth Cav
alry, who has beÂ«Â»n given .charge of the
location, arrangement of and policing of
camps and the preservation of order
therein. General Mcrriam, upon viewing
the ground, at once approved their choice,
which was one of excellent judgment.
The Bay District camp is much superior
in every way to any space left at the
Presidio, where the supply of water had
been exhausted for the extra territory
needed.
The Bay District camp will easily af
ford camping room for 10,000 troops,
which, with the forces already here, will
in all probability be the limit of the
Philippine expedition. The division of the
ground into blocks surrounded by fences
will be a great assistance In forming the
various camp lines.
TO COMMAND THE PEKING.
Commander W. C. Gibson, U.S.
N., Will Retain the Officers
of the Vessel.
Commander William C. Gibson of the
United States navy is in the city to taka
command of the City of Peking, which
has been chartered to transport troops to
the Philippine Islands.
When asked whether the captain and
the other officers of the vessel were to be
retained on board he answered emphatic
ally in the affirmative. He said: "All the
present officers of the ship are to be re
tained and will fill their respective offices
during the trip. I go as a representative
of the United States navy, and the orders
from the authorities will be given to the
captain of the vessel through me. The
Citj of Peking has simply been chartered
for this trip, and when the Government
is through with her, which will probably
be after the troops are landed in the Phil
ippines, slit; will immediately be turned
over to the owners.
"The rumor that Engineer Leopold of
t v e jiohtcan is t<> be placed in charge of
the engines of the Peking is entirely un
founded. He is groins; with us, but merely
as a passenger, and will probably be as
signed to duty on some of the vessels of
the Asiatic squadron. I cannot say when
we will leave, as I know no more than
outsiders on that point, but I presume it
will be the latter part of this week. We
have in the neighborhood of 15U0 men to
transport."
Commander Gibson has for the past
year and a half been in command of the
United States training ship A3ams, which
has been cruising in the Pacific most of

More Talk of Charters.
The report that the China and City of
Para were to be chartered by the Gov
ernment was again in circulation along
the water front yesterday; but both Mr.
Center and Mr. Schwerin denied that
there was any truth in it. The City of
Para was offered to the Government
some time ago, and she was refused. Tho
China was inspected, and was inspected
a second time, but the officials of the
company say that is as far as it went.
The China is due here from Hongkong
on the 28th inst, and the Para is due
from the south coast in the early part of
June. Both would make good transport
ships with very little alteration; but it
is emphatically denied that there have
been any negotiations for their charter
or purchase by the Government.
War Incidents.
A press dispatch from Fresno states
that the Farley brothers who refused to
be sworn into Company C, Sixth Infantry,
have started to San Francisco to enlist in
the Heavy Artillery. The sister of the
Farleys who saw the result of her former
action obtained places for them in the ar
tillery and persuaded them to enlist again.
Governor Budd went to Stockton last
night, lie will not return to headquarters
until to-morrow.
At a meeting of the board of directors
of the Mechanics' Institute last night it
was decided to sond a quantity of books
with the troops on their departure to Ma
nila. There are at present on the shelves
duplicate copies of many first-class works
and bound volumes of magazines, for
which there is at present very little call.
These will be selected by the librarian
and shipped with the boys on their jour-

At a meeting of the Journeymen "Bar

the standing of all members who enlist
in the army be kept up during their terra
of service.
The Red Crocs Aid Society of the Na

LET THE DEAD REST.
AS an exhibition of brutal bad taste there has
been no recent act of the Examiner more strik
ing than its article yesterday morning concern
ing the late Judge Campbell. To gibe at the pecu
liarities of the living may be permissible, for at least
they can defend themselves. But at the border of the
open grave is no place for levity or the jingling of a
clown's bells. The peace of the dead no taunt dis
turbs, yet tiiere is custom among the civilized to
respect the silent clay that has been a man, and to
step lightly in the house of mourning.
THE PHILIPPINE TRADE.
ADVANCE sheets of the report of Consul Wil
liams concerning the trade of the Philippine
Islands, just issued by the State Department,
show that in addition to the military interest we now
have in the group we have also large and increasing
commercial interests there. In fact, as the Consul
says, the trend of trade for some years past has been
toward us. Nearly all the recent increase of Philip
pine commerce has been with the United States.
One exception to the rule is found in the sugar
trade. In 1889 we imported from the Philippines
2,135.443 piculs pounds) of sugar, and from that
point the importation declined by slow and fluctuat
ing degrees until 1806, when we imported 1,305,882
piculs. In 1897 the importation dropped suddenly to
342,540 piculs. This heavy falling off shows to what
extent we are now producing a home supply of sugar
and points to a near approach ot a time when we
shall have no need to import any at all. It also shows
that those persons who arc talking glibly of annexing
the Philippine Islands to the United States have not
seriously considered the effect that policy would have
upon the sugar industry of our own farmers. Free
sugar from the Philippines would be the ruin of many
a Californian sugar-beet grower.
With the exception of the sugar trade, however,
our commerce with the islands has been advancing
by leaps and bounds. The Consul reports that during
the year 1597 the export of hemp from the Philip
pines increased over that of the previous year to the
extent of 158.485 bales, and that of this increase the
United States took 133,806 bales. Thus the increased
shipments to this country were 544 per cent greater
than the increase in shipments to all other countries
combined.
We havealso a large and rapidly growingtrade in to
bacco, copra, woods, shells, indigo and coffee. Our total
imports from the islands are not far from $1,000,000 a
month. There is also a chance for a large export
trade. In 1897 Great Britain exported to the islands
goods valued at $7,467,000. while the exports of the
United States were valued at $4,982,857. About 13
per cent of the total imports of the islands were from
Spain, while those from other countries were far be
low in value the imports from the United States. We
are, therefore, a close second to Great Britain in the
Philippine market, and as we make the same class
and quality of goods which 6he exports, there is a
prospect for us to eventually take the first rank.
The most significant feature of the report is the
showing made for industrial and commercial expan
sion in the islands. The resources of the group, so
far from being developed, have hardly been explored.
The six New England States, with New York, New
Jersey. Maryland and Delaware combined, have 10
per cent less area than this island empire. The in
habitants are lacking in industry and skill to make
use of the riches with which nature has supplied them.
Under a stable and just government, which would as
sure protection to capital and enterprise, the wealth
of the Philippines would soon be multiplied a hun
dredfold.
Notwithstanding the excellent example set by a
number of recent murderers in undergoing the pro
cess of hanging without any preliminary fuss, the
batch now on hand seems inclined to balk. Of course
the appeals to the Supreme Court are bluffs to se
cure delay, for this is all that has in any instance
been accomplished.
Some of the gold now circulated in Spain is a
hundred years old and has just been brought out of a
long seclusion. But Spain will in, vain devote all her
gold of whatever date to winning victory. That
country is up against a very large "it."
Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont will not be permitted
to command an American naval vessel, but he is at
liberty to fit out a yacht and divert the Spanish from
serious business by giving them an opportunity to
capture it.
According to latest reports the bombardment of
San Juan was not a brilliant success. But there is
comfort in reflecting that so many reports have been
wrong.
WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE.
WHILE the war with Spain is not only making
history, but is rapidly crystallizing the nations
and the races of the globe into new combina
tions which threaten to bring about a general war, and
which will certainly so affect international politics as
to make the conditions of the political world hereafter
wide'S: different from what has prevailed in times
past, there is lying dead in England a man who
has made more history and done more to mold pop
ular sentiment than any other man of this generation.
No man, however great, is ever really necessary
to the advancing development of nations. Never
theless at this juncture there will be a wide
regret on both sides of the ocean that fate
did not , allot it to Gladstone to conduct the
affairs of Great Britain and to speak the voice
of her Parliament, her people and her throne
in declaring sympathy with the United States in the
struggle for free Cuba, and hurling defiance at the
banded despotisms of the world.
Gladstone's political career dates back to 1832. He
took part in the whole of that movement which
in the last sixty years has so widely broadened the
bounds of liberty and freedom. He stood forth
as the champion of humanity, not only in his own
country, but in Italy, in Greece, in Ireland, and lit
erally throughout the world. No heart more earnest
than his ever espoused the cause, of man, and few
statesmen ever more eloquently supported it with
tongue and pen, in Parliament, on the hustings, in the
council chamber or in the study.
The distinguishing characteristic of his intellect and
that which gave him an almost unique place among
statesmen was its openness to the light, its capacity
for growth and its candid willingness to accept the re
sults of light and growth. Nearly every other great
man has continued throughout political life to hold
to the doctrines accepted at the beginning. It was
not so with Gladstone. In his early years he
was so devout a conservative that Lord Macaulay
wrote of him as the "rising hope of the stern and
unbending Tories." His sympathies were not prim
arily on the side of the people. His liberalism was
the result of increasing wisdom and not of ar
dent enthusiasm, and yet in his old age hardly any
young man was as enthusiastic as himself in the
cause of Greece or of Ireland.
Among the great social reforms in Great Britain
with which his name is inseparably associated are the
repeal of the corn laws, the abolition of a property
qualification for members of Parliament, the exten
sion of the franchise, the disestablishment of the Irish
church and the admission of dissenters to the univer
sities. He did not succeed in doing much for Ire
land, owing to the unfortunate divisions in the ranks
of the Irish party caused by the Parnell scandal, but
he staked his political fortunes on a home rule bill
and went out of office when it was defeated.
Throughout Europe his voice was almost as
potent as at home. He helped ever}- advance of free
dom on the Continent from the days when in his
youth he pleaded not in vain the cause of the patriots
of Italy, down to the time when in Ills old age, his
voice trembling but still eloquent, rang over the
world in denunciation of the powers that left Greece
a prey to Turkey.
The lesson of such a life needs no preacher to ex
plain it. Here was a statesman who followed truth
even when it led him against the inclinations of his
sympathies and compelled him to surrender office.
The memory of such a man is an inspiration to the
world, and his death will be mourned as a loss on
both sides of the Atlantic.
THE QUARREL MflY SPREAD.
GOOD WILL between this country and France
seems to have suddenly snapped. The old
idea that rulers and princes are responsible
for war is a mistake. War grows out of feeling gen
erated and intensified among the people. Its origin
i:. most commonly in self-interest. Frenchmen hold
millions of Spanish securities. Some classes of these
are based on the Cuban and Philippine revenues. If
Spain lose these islands the securities are worthless.
Naturally French sympathy is against the United
States in a war for the purpose of taking Cuba and
the Philippines away from Spain. This antipathy is
reflected by the Parisian press, and as the people were
already on tension in the Zola ami Dreyfus affair, it
has not taken much invective to heat every collar in
France. It is significant that the fire-eating Roche
fort, who at first stood with us, has turned and is bel
lowing with the best of them for a Latin alliance and
a united front against the Anglo-Saxon. Between
Pierre Loti, the academician and philosopher, and
Henri Rochefort there is a great gulf wide enough
to hold peer, peasant and bourgeois, and all of them
seem to be in accord with the two extremes and
joined in a common bitterness against the United
States.
It seems strange that this hatred should be re
ciprocated in this country, but it is. We have only
recently celebrated the anniversary of Yorktown, and
have just built a monument to Lafayette, facing the
White House in Washington. But the ladies are in
league to quit buying French goods and the gentle
men must follow by ceasing to open French wines,
and out of all this may well come war that started
like a small fire in Spanish bonds and became a con
flagration in French millinery.
After all there is not much in historic sentiment.
The past generations did their best for their inter
ests and died and left the present to us. If the Latins
and Slavs want to combine against the Anglo-Saxon
the result may be the greatest military struggle of the
ages. With the United States and England on one
side and the rest of the world on the other there
would be a duel that would make all past history dull
reading.
If the Anglo-Saxon win in such a struggle he will
have a boundless bourne thereafter, and the other
races will pitch their tents only with his permission
and will move on when he orders it.
Our difficulty with Spain has started a ferment on
the Continent which may make war necessary to thÂ«
Latin nations, as preferable to revolution. An appeal
to the pride of race stirs the most sluggish blood, and
Latin blood is not sluggish. The great military es
tablishments which have been maintained by the
powers will seem to the people to be paying back
their cost if they are engaged in fighting, and their
occupation may save Ministries and perhaps dynas
ties.
If the assault come it will be met with courage and
judgment. The people of the United States are not
behind any in their martial spirit, and their resources
are as abundant as their courage.
When a correspondent wishes to be impressive and
show his intimate knowledge of affairs of state he

THE SA3ST FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 19, 1898.
ARE THEY AGAINST IT?
THE theory on which at kast one newspaper ad
vocate of the proposed new charter proceeds
is that it must be a good document because the
local corporations are opposed to it. No evidence
has been produced to prove this allegation. On the
contrary, there is excellent reason to believe that
some of the local corporations favor the instrument.
For instance, the telephone monopoly is satisfied with
it. That corporation is completely protected from
regulation by a grant of power which means nothing.
The water company is indifferent. The constitution
prescribes the method under which its rates shall be
regulated.
But even if the local corporations were unani
mously "against" the charter, that would not be valid
grounds for favoring it. All capitalists, we believe,
are opposed to anarchy; an unsettled condition of
affairs destroys the value of securities and interrupts
business arrangements of all kinds. Because this is
so, shall the remainder of the community go in for
anarchy? If what one set of men do or think is to
become the rule for determining the conduct of others
there is an easy way of resolving all State and muni
cipal problems. If we accept Mr. Huntington as the
especial bete noir of the commonwealth, all we need
do is to ascertain what he thinks and then adopt the
opposite view. True, there would be danger that
occasionally Huntington would fool us by pretend
ing to think one way while he was really thinking
another; but danger prevails everywhere. No man,
no State, no community, is entirely free from it.
But aside from the absurdity of reasoning in this
manner â the general adoption of which would ele
vate us to the proud distinction of being a com
munity of idiots â we violate no confidence when we
say that there is at least one corporation in this city
which favors the charter. We refer to the Sutter
Street Railway Company. For many years this cor
poration has been endeavoring to "bottle up" Bush
street. In 1885 it purchased from the Board of Su
pervisors a franchise and went to the expense of lay
ing a single track from one end of the thoroughfare
to the other. Over this road for ten years it ran a
car once a day. Finally the Supreme Court dis
pensed with the farce by declaring the franchise a
nullity. Ever since this decision was handed down
the Sutter street company has been trembling in its
boots â if a corporation has any boots and can be
said to tremble in them.
The proposed charter, however, brings the cor
poration comfort unalloyed. By loading down
street railway franchises with onerous conditions and
making their purchase difficult the instrument renders
it practically impossible for either the Market Street
or Sutro Company to invade the Sutter Street Com
pany's territory. In case anybody ever seeks to ac
quire a franchise on Bush street all the Sutter Street
Company need do will be to turn the machinery of
the charter against him and he will be undone.
We understand that the men employed on the Sut
ter street line have been requested to support the
charter on the 26th inst. As it is against their inter
ests to encourage competitive street railways which,
by failing to pay. tend to reduce salaries, it is quite
probable that they will comply. In fact, they will
probably do what the street car men throughout the
city will do. There are a sufficient number of street
car lines. All are now making money. The men
have a good thing. If it can be mnde clear to them
that the charter puts a quietus on further competition
why should they not support it unanimously ?
THE MEMORY OF WITNESSES.
IN these days, when law cases are almost innumer
able and the reports of them fill volumes enough to
constitute libraries of great magnitude, it L not often
a novel and unprecedented issue comes up in court to
perplex Judges and arouse the interest of people who
are usually indifferent to legal questions. Such a
point, however, has recently occurred in Paris and
has given rise to a good deal of discussion throughout
France.
The issue turns upon the responsibility of a witness
for his memory. In a case still pending before a
Parisian tribunal one of the witnesses met every ques
tion concerning an important point in the case with
the reply, "I do not remember." The attorney who
was endeavoring to obtain the information appealed
to the Judge to cotnpel the witness to answer, alleg
ing that the memory of the witness was so good on
other matters it was mentally impossible for it to be
lacking on the point involved.
The court took the question under advisement and
called in a committee of experts on mental diseases
to examine the witness and report as to the condition
of the defaulting memory. The experts after examin
ation came to the unanimous conclusion that the wit
ness was shamming and so' reported. The Judge
thereupon instructed the witness to answer, and when
the former reply, "I do not remember," was repeated
the witness was sent to jail to remain until memory
resumes its throne and is in good working order
again.
Witnesses who do not remember important facts
while they have very good memories for trifles are
common in all countries where law courts exist. They
are very common indeed in this country, and particu
larly so in cases involving political frauds or muni
cipal jobbery. It has been our custom to assume
that they spoke the truth when they made the familiar
reply pleading a lack of memory, and no effort as far
as we remember has ever been made by an American
Judge to test whether or no they were shamming and
lying or really suffering from a mental defect.
No one disputes that memory is a very unreliable
faculty. No man's memory is like that of another,
and, moreover, there is a marked variation at times
in the memory of each individual. Some men can
remember faces, but not names; some remember
trifles, but forget matters of important business;
some can remember what they read in a book, but not
what they see around them. All of these known
aberrations of memory tend to make us hesitate to
send to prison a witness who cannot remember having
been instructed to stuff a ballot or to pay money to
a public official
Nevertheless the check which this kind of memory
places upon the administration of law is so great as
to render it worth while in certain cases to investigate
the mental make-up of a witness before we permit
him to baffle justice by not remembering. It h
known that there are some things they do better in
France than in this country, and the thing done by
this particular Parisian court seems to be one of them.
Perhaps the late Judge Campbell was not always
dignified, but the scramble to get into his place is
totally devoid of any element of dignity. In fact it
is disgraceful and disgusting. Imagine a Gavigan as
Police Judge!
It is one thing to set a snare for the Cape Verde
fleet and a very different one to induce the fleet to
sail into it.
Considering that the garbage crematory is engaged
in burning up Examiners, the stench it creates may
be borne with patience.

the country of his adoption. He has dis
played a sign in his show window which

Whether the "spinich" refers to i~Â« veg

both articles are eliminated from the sa

A chef at one of our downtown hotels,
who is nothing if not patriotic, has cut
the description "A la Spanish" on his bill
of fare, and has substituted "A la Creole"
in its stead. The menu reads among
other things, "Tripe a la Creole," "Beef
a la ditto," etc., and woe betide the wait

in the old way. It is considered sufficient
cause for instant dismissal.
Tho chef, just before the declaration of
hostilities, bought a case of olives, the
bottles being labeled "Spanish olives."
He opined that it would be traitorous to
1 display these on the tables, but as they
j were somewhat expensive and he did not
care to destroy them on that account, he
at last hit upon the happy idea of remov
ing the original labels and substituting
new ones, which now read, "California
olives"â this action in itself a sort of re
taliatory measure for the practice of the
foreign labeling of our California goods.

NEWSPAPER WAR SERVICE.
"Nobody believes a word that he reads
in the newspapers." This is a remark
which was made by a prominent Boston
ian at a public dinner a few weeks ago.
It is hardly worth noticing, it so utterly
lacks sense and discrimination; but a
striking event has happened since it was
spoken which should check similar fool
ish remarks from leaving the lips of those
who attribute dishonest journalism to
"the newspapers" without excepting the
honest papers. Commodore Dewey won
a brilliant victory on the other side of
the world last Sunday morning, and on
Monday every home in America was told
about it. It was all the work of "the
newspapers." The President, the Navy
Department and the Board of Naval
Strategy had not a word about that bat
tle except what "the newspapers" told
them.â Boston Journal.
BOOSE VELT'S SPEECH.

us a speech in Washington and stated
that we would have to go wherever we
were sent, that whatever we were ordered
to do we would hftve to obey orders.
Colonel RoosevHt stated that he was very
desirous of going soon to Cuba. He told
us that if the horses died we would have
to go on foot, and if the yellow fever
broke out we would have to stay with ii,
and after such speech there was not a

A BEGIMENT OF PAINTEBS.
The Amalgamated Painters' and Dec

to organize a regiment if It gets encour
agement from Oovernor Black. A meeting
of the organization was held a few days
aeo, and a resolution was passed to offer
to Governor Black the services of a regi
ment, 1000 strong, raised mainly from tne
membership of the union to be drilled
and equipped at once. Enlistment blanks
were prepared, and. after the meeting,
two of the members who had been ap
pointed a committee to enroll volunteers
were kept hard at work for a couple of
hours. Among the members of this union
are veterans of the last war from botn
the Union and Confederate armies and
these shook hands before the enrollment
began, and pledged themselves to make
common cause in support of the nation.â

THE NEW CHARTER AND THE
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
Cyril Williams has fully justified his
estimate of increased expenditures under
the new charter, but, like the Mayor, he
has omitted the larger part of salaries
and expenditures not specifically provid
ed for in the charter, and which ought
to be included in a statement made for
the instruction of the citizens. The
Mayor, for example, puts down the in
creased expenditure made necessary by
the creation of the Board of Public
Works at $13,800, which is simply the sal
aries of the Commissioners and their sec
retary. The officials now employed by
the city are doubtless sufficient for the
work now done, but an increased staff
must be provided for the new duties for
which the board has been created; in
fact, without a largely increased appro
priation the board will certainly be pow
erless.
In the first place, the charter enacts
(page SB, section I) that the Board of Pub
lic Works "shall" devise a general sys
tem of drainage, which "shall" embrace
all matters relative to the thorough, sys
tematic and effectual drainage of the
city and county. This alone is a large
duty. Marsden Manson is reported as
stating that it will involve the expendi
ture of four millions.
Secondlyâ The charter enacts (page 89,
section 1) that the board control the har
bor and water front, which now belong
or may hereafter belong to the city and
county; to build and repair wharves; to
collect tolls, etc.
Thirdlyâ To build and repair all the
schools, hospitals and public buildings of
the city.
Fourthlyâ The charter epacts (page 124,
section I) that the Supervisors within one
year must procure, through the City En
gineer, appointed by the Board of Works,
(page 55, section II), plans and estimates
of the actual cost of the original con
struction and completion of water works,
gas works, electric light works, steam,
water or electric power works, telephone
lines, street railroads and such other
public utilities as the Supervisors may
designate; they must further procure and
place on file plans and estimates of the
cost of obtaining from all of the several
available sources, a sufficient and perma
nent supply of good, pure water, and af
ter such plans and estimates shall have
been procured and filed the Supervisors
must solicit and consider offers for the
sale to the city of existing utilities. Now
the Supervisors, through the Board of
Works, must order plans* for bringing
down water from the Sierras, from Clear
Lake and other sources, which plans will
cost many hundred thousand dollars, and
until this is done they cannot even nego
tiate with the owners of existing utilities.
In order to do this vast work the Board
of Works is given power (page 52, sec
tion III) to employ such clerks, superin
tendents, inspectors, engineers, survey
ors, deputies, architects and workmen a3
shall be necessary to a proper discharge
of these duties, and to fix their compen
sation. And there is no restriction what
ever on their salaries and numbers, no
enforcement of civil service rules; and
the only stipulation is that no compen
sation f<"hall be greater than is paid in the
case of similar employment, and for neg
lect of this there is no possible penalty.
This power of the Board of Works is,
moreover, absolute, for when power is
specially given by charter to an executive
body to make appointments and fix sala
ries without limit or control, the taxing
power is compelled to pay them. Such is
the ruling of the highest courts. Adopt
this charter and a machine will be cre
ated which may rival Tammany in cor
ruption, politics and waste.
It is evident that an army of employes
will be required to fulfill these new and
important functions, and a question of a
million may be rightly added to the esti
mate. The authors of this charter have
thus made it quite impossible to limit
taxation to one dollar, and it is evident
that this provision was put in to catch
votes and to deceive the citizens. The
effect of its adoption will be to create
emergency for debt, and the issue of
bonds will become a necessity. Perhaps
this is the intention.

NEW CHABTER VACATIONS.
Wednesday, May 18, 3598.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir: In i
an editorial in your yesterday's issue,.!
entitled, "A Text from the Charter." you
perhaps unwittingly do the proposed
charter an injustice, in misinterpreting i
the meaning of section 33 of article XVI, j
which provides that "No deputy, clerk or I
other employe of the city and county |
shall be paid for a greater time than that
covered by his actual service." It is not
true, as stated in that editorial, that un- j
der that section "a fireman disabled at ;
his post of duty will suffer the loss of his |
pay while his bones mend or his burns j
heal." By referring to section 3 of chap- |
ter 11, article IX, under the head "Fire j
Department," you will find it specifically i
provided that "when any officer, mem
ber or employe of the department shall !
become temporarily disabled by reason
of injuries received while in the actual
performance of his duty, the Commis- j
eioners shall allow his salary dnVins th.
continuance of such temporary disabil
ity." The provision of the proposed char
ter criticised in your editorial was intend- j
ed to apply, and does apply, to that class
Of deputies, clerks and employes, large j
numbers of whom are temporarily em- j
ployed by certain officials (notably by the
Auditor, Tax Collector and Assessor) for ;
certain brief periods, and who have in '
times past In many Instances received ]
credit dv corrupt officials for services ;
they never rendered, for the purpose of |
"giving the boys a job." Immense sums I
or money have been squandered by this
manner of "doing politics."
It would Indeed be doing a grave injus- â¢
tice to the proposed charter to interpret |
BÂ«ction 33 as applying to the regular force |
of deputies, clerks and employes in the '
various departments who are employed i
on annual salaries. I have pointed out j
how It was misapplied to the Fire Depart
ment. The same is true of the School De
partment, where the teachers are em
ployed at annual salaries, with reference
to the fact that vacations are not only
essential and necessary but have become \
so well and universally understood to be ;
a part of the school year that their an- '
mial employments are made with refer
ence to them, and without any allusion j
ever being made to them. Respectfully.

WHERE TROOPS GATHERED.
Tampa 1b one long street. It begins at ;
the railway station and stretches for four I
miles to where the camp now Is. The !
stores are like frontier stores in the West i
and the Middle North, with local differ- j
ences. The leisurely quality of the South- ]
erner asserts itself. Their stock is a j
strongly shifting thing, like a geological
period. Fashions with them are not mer
curial. At this time of the year each j
elder comes out in his same old palm-leaf
hat of the year gone by. The men do not
even shave once a day, but when you buy
a coat from that Southern gentleman be
hind the counter you feel sure that he is
only paving his beard for a clipping on i
Saturday night, and will look clean and \
honest before his best girl on Sunday. |
They don't work much, these men and :
women of Tampa, but they are not!
ushnmed when they do. I remember one;
estimable woman Hitting on her veranda i
entertaining a caller, while all the" time'
she squirted a hose here and there about i
her little front yard, a very practical {
fancy work.
The one street is all sandâ all except a j
few patches of cedar block pavement. '
The side streets lead to more sand, the i
alleys to sand. One trolley line keeps a i
boy only to sweep sand from the tracks, |
and the boy earns his salary. The wheels !
of the Government wagons sink to the â 
spokes in sand; your shoes shod sand
when you kick them off at night. It's
a dusty sand, too. Perhaps that's why,
for a town of its size, Tampa rejoices in ;

BATES WILL BE LOW.
Governor Black of New York has signed
the bill requiring 500-mlle tickets at 2
cents a mile to be sold by all railroads
In which the regular local fare is higher
than that rate, and not over 3 cents;
thus, by a single stroke, reducing the
fare for a good share of the passenger
trips of all important roads in the State,
except the main line oi the New York
Central. The law requires the railroads
to accept these tickets from the pur
chaser's family and employes, thus mak
ing them practically good for any person
nrVentins them, so that in many locali
ties scalpers will be able to use them, If
they fed it worth while to take the neces
sary pains to avoid being arrested for
violating the law prohibiting brokerage
in tickets. This law is simply a severer
application of the revenue reduction em
bodied in the 1000-mile tirket law of two
veara ago. and by reducing the minimum
expenditure from $20 to $10 it may eas ly
double the number of 2-cent rides sold.

to presume that this new Inw Will also
be fought unless its validity is settled by

YANKEE-J. H. X., City. There Is no
certainty as to the origin of the word
Yankee. It is generally believed to be
an Indian corruption of "English."
Thierry says that it is a corruption of
the Dutch word Jankle, a diminutive of
John, and that it was a nickname given
by the Dutch colonists of New York to
their neighbors in Connecticut settle
ments. Aubry says that It is derived
from the Cherokee word "Chankke,"
which means "coward," "slave." This
epithet was applied to the people of the
New England States by the Virginians
for not assisting them in a war with the
Cherokees. Another version is that the
word got into general use in the following
manner: In 1713 one Jonathan Hastings,
a farmer In Cambridge, used the word as
a puffing epithet, meaning genuine Ameri
can-made, that which cannot be sur
passed, such as Yankee horse. Yankee
cider, etc. The students at Cambridge
called Hastings "Yankee Jonathan." It
soon spread and became the pet name of
the New Englander. Since then the term
has been applied to any American of the
Northern States.

How the "Circulation" of the Examiner Goes Up in
Crematory Smoke.
HOW MERCHANTS ARE SWINDLED.
Wagon-Loads oi That Paper Printed, Only
to Be Burned Almost as Soon as
Off the Press.
The secret of the Examiner's alleged circula
tion has been uncovered. From one to two tons
of the papers struck off by the Examiner's
presses at 4 o'clock in the morning are burned
in the garbage crematory before noon of the
same day at a cost to the paper of 20 cents per
cubic yard. Evidence of these facts is given
herewith for the purpose of revealing to the pub
lic the shamelessâ and costlyâ subterfuges which
this yellow sheet is forced to adopt in its attempt
to deceive the public and bunko the business por=
tion of the community,
Oath is regularly made to the Examiner's cir=
culation. !t is guilty not alone of swindling by
methods everywhere condemned as dishonest,
but becomes a direct violator of a law enacted
several years ago at its own solicitation. It
claims to reach thousands more than ever see it,
and on this claim bases its value as an advertis
ing medium and boasts of its influence. The fact
has been brought to light that many Examiners
are printed only to be burned; that they never
leave the pressroom until they are dumped into
an ash cart and taken to the garbage crema
tory; that they ar& printed solely to swell "cir
culation," and that they are burned the day
they are printed. The Examiner management
does not even dave dispose of its surplus papers
by weight, but insists that they be utterly de
stroyed and that everybody concerned in the
operation maintain the strictest secrecy.
In boasting of its large circulation
and periodically swearing to it the Ex
aminer neglects to specify that it sends
daily thousands of copies to the garb- j
age crematory. These, being counted j
in the circulation, give it that swollen !
aspect in which the yellow tail of Fake
dom, taking pride, wags itself joyously.
There can be no fault found with the
fact that the Examiner is treated as
garbage. If the process were only
sweeping and complete it would repre
sent an absolute virtue. But some
copies are permitted to escape the puri
fying fire and such as do get carted
away as trash are seriously reckoned
THE EXAMINER ABOUT TO BEGIN ACHIEVING ITS DAILY CIRCULATION.

when figures are being made up for the
delusion of an absent proprietor and
bait to the advertiser. Therefore an
exposure of the methods of the confi
dence game has been undertaken in a
dispassionate effort to protect the pub
lic.
To digress pleasantly, may not th**
burning of Examiners at the crematory
account in large measure for the nox
ious smell which has wrought grievous
pain to the Mission nose? This sug
gestion is thrown in for what it Is
worth, and it may be worth something.
The incineration of foulness is certain
to produce fumes not of Araby the
blest. That the Examiner is foul there
is no question. That it is being regu
larly incinerated there will hereafter be
no question. However, even If this
phase of the subject be of scientific In
terest it is a side issue and must not
be permitted to detract from the main
point. The main point is that a large
part of the circulation of the Examiner
circulates through the medium of an
ash wagon.
It is not to be supposed that the
driver of the wagon was communica
tive.
He frankly stated that he dare not be
communicative. He did not loosen up
as does the Prince of Wales when ap
proached by a "special commissioner."
He was far more reticent than the
Queen Regent when she was requested
by the same special commissioner to
lay bare her inmost thoughts so he i
could get space rates on them. But he
did admit that he hauled the papers
every day but Sunday, and on Monday
got a double dose of them. Necessity
arose for finding out the exact truth.
Strict orders had been given the drivers
to say nothing. They all knew that to
reveal the secrets of their calling would
be to lose a job which, while it Involv
ed the task of handling the Examiner
and other offal, still meant an honest
living. So the drivers were not pressed
to tell.
Representatives of The Call were de
tailed to find the truth, and they found
it. Knowing that a garbage wagon
stopped at the Examiner building daily
and there obtained a load of sworn cir
culation, they waited for the wagon.
They waited a long time, but at last
were rewarded. The wagon came, and
out of the basement began to rise an
THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 19, 1898.
array of bundles, wrapped in heavy pa
per, compact; to the practiced eye
plainly containing newspapers folded in
the shape they are turned out by the
press. Yet this was not positive evi
dence. Supposing the Examiner were
to claim that the bundles were of waste
paper, the natural accumulation of a
printing office, that they were made up
of exchanges and of returned copies.
The moral certainty that the Examiner
had been engaged in a wanton case of
swindling was not enough. It was de
sired to make the conviction beyond
cavil. Therefore the contents of a bun
dle had to be seen.
Vain efforts were made to purchase a
bundle. The driver had his orders
neither to sell nor to open a package.
It had been ascertained from a gentle
man who shall be nameless that the
bundles contained Examiners, fresh
yellow Examiners. He had seen a
bundle opened as It was on its way to
the furnace and been surprised to ob
serve that the papers it held were of
the date of the day the bundle fell un
der his eye. In other words, papers
turned off the press one morning are in
ashes by noon of the same day. The
investigators desired to know if this
was the ordinary rule. At this point
there seemed only one course. It was
violent seizure and quick escape. There
are no apologies to be offered for this;
the end justified the means. It was far
different from the Examiner style of
stealing a paper from the press-room
of a contemporary for the purpose of
taking the news from its columns.
So one of the reporters rose to the
dignity of special commissioner and
borrowed from one bundle about fifty
copies of the Examiner. The use of the
term "borrowed" Is deliberate, for the
papers may be had back for the ask-
ing. No newspaper man would take
fifty Examiners with any serious idea
of keeping them.
Yesterday was May IS, 1898. It was
the noon hour when the papers were
secured. They all bore date of May 18,
1898. For fear some question might
arise about this The Call thoughtfully
had the papers photographed. The pic
ture Is presented herewith, together
with others which have a bearing on
the situation.
While the driver manifested proper
signs of displeasure at the disappear
ance of a small part of his load, and
audibly expressed regret, he too-k what
was left and went on his way. He was
followed to the crematory, and an ar
tist got a useful snapshot or two at
the wagon still piled high with Ex
aminer circulation. A reporter saw the
circulation dumped Into the immense
receivers just over the furnaces.
There was no mistaking the bright
hues distinguishing the first page of
the sheet. There had been some other
debris in the bottom of the wagon, but
though all emptied in one mass,
through it all gleamed the tell-tale
colors, showing every paper to be the
same date.
Then the reporter paid a visit to the
long passage-way beneath the re
ceivers, where nine men were raking
the dumpings into the yawning holes
leading to the furnace. Examiners
went in by dozens, scores, hundreds.
So rapidly did they disappear that no
estimate of their number could be
made. Thus is circulation acquired.
and the fires of the reduction works
fed. The foreman was asked for a
bundle, but he was as firm as the
driver had been In not giving it, ex
plaining that such an act would be
against the rules of the company, but
he suggested that the superintendent
be seen about it. The superintendent
was seen.
The important position of superin
tendent is held by P. E. Sharon. He
listened to the request and refused
point blank.
"We are paid for burning those pa
pers," he said, "and I would be betray
ing a trust to give you any. If you
were to offer me a dollar apiece I would
not let you have them. If the Exami
ner people wanted to sell the papers
they could get a good price for them,
but they want the papers burned so as
to prevent their being scattered about
the country."
AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION.
THs is a copy of a statute which mainly through the efforts of
the Examiner became a law:
Section 538 of the Penal Code of Cali
fornia:
MISREPRESENTATION OF NEWSPA
PER CIRCULATION A MISDEMEANOR.
Every proprietor or publisher of any news
paper or periodical who shall willfully and
knowingly misrepresent the circulation of
such newspaper or periodical, for the pur
pose of securing advertising or other pat
ronage, shall be deemed guilty of a misde
meanor.
On this particular phase of the matter there appears no neces
sity for comment. Any reader can ask whether the proprietor or
publisher of the Examiner is or is not a criminal by the terms of
this statute, and can answer the question. A glance at the accom
panying exhibits might have effect in aiding to a correct conclusion.
Asked what he received for the de
struction of the papers he replied that
that was a private business affair be
tween the newspaper and the corpora
tion he represented. He did admit,
however, that 20 cents per cubic yard
was the regular charge.
"How l.^iny cubic yards did that
wagon hold?"
â¢He answered that it held about eight,
but qualified this by adding that it had
only part of a load â about half a ton.
"If the Ex; miner people wanted us
to dispose of the papers in some other
way," he raid, "we could sell them
readily at $6 per ton."
Circulation by the cubic yard.
Circulation by the ton.
And all sworn to.
And the superfluous papers not to be
sold. An incinerated yellow daily tells
no tales. It was recognition of this
truth which impelled the capture of
some of them before they had lost their
power to give information.
It was learned at the works that they
had been burning Examiners there ever
since they were open for business, this
information merely confirming that
which had already been found out from
other sources.
There : s now the possibility that the
Examiner, caught In the act, will as
sert that the material burned was
something else, but the claim will be
idle. It is true that there is waste
paper in every ] blishing office, but it
goes out in bulky bales very different
from the neatly tied bundles which
leave the Examiner office daily. It is
true that there are a certain number
of "returns. " but they do not reach to
the thousands seven times a week, and
moreover, the sworn statement of the
Examiner sets forth explicitly the
amount of "returns."
The evidence that the Examiner has
deliberately deceived the public for the
purpose of getting more of the public's
money is incontrovertible. The duty
of exposing: its rascality has been un
dertaken because one purpose of a re
spectable journal is to protect the com
munity. Much has been borne from
yellow journalism. It has lied in large
type greatly to the common annoyance.
But the public has not suspected the
true deeps to which this form of crime
has fallen. It has sometimes wondered
that it could claim an increasing cir
culation. It did not dream that the cir
culation was being acquired for the ex
pense of white paper ami the burning
of it at 20 cents a cable yard.
Experts are now trying to figure out
how many Examiners are printed daily
for the purpose of being sworn into the
circulation and then carted to the fur
nace. The task is one of difficulty. To
estimate circulation by the cubic yard,
or even by the ton is a process in which
few have had experience. However
there Is hope of a definite result before
iong.
One man who formerly drove the cir
culation ash cart stated that he some
times had to make two trips a day to
get all the papers the Examiner desired
put out of the way. Supposing the
wagon can safely hold a ton, here's
two tons of circulation. No wonder the
totals rise to the magnificent. If white

paper holds out and the crematory con
tinue in operation it may be expected
that the Examiner will shortly claim
to have reached the 200,000 mark. In
quiry develops the capacity of the
crematory to be equal to the consump
tion of this many, and at 20 cents a
cubic yard there would be money in it.
EXAMINER STEALING.
It Palmed Off a Map of the
Klondike as Its Own and Is
Sued for the Theft
Since the Examiner, after a notable ex
posure, quit stealing copies of The Call
from The Call's press rooms for the pur
pose of cribbing the news, it has satisfied
its predatory instincts by stealing the
news in other ways â¢ and from other
sources, latterly it has appeased its pi
ratical instincts by pirating maps of the
Klondike diggings and the approaches
thereto. Yesterday A. L.. McDonald of
the publishing firm of A. 1... McDonald &
Co. began suit in the United States Dis
trict Court against W. R. Hearst of New
York and elsewhere to recover $82,729,; as
damages for infringement on a copyright
held by the plaintiff.
The complaint is terse and comprehen
sive. It recites that the plaintiff has
brought the action for the Government as
well as for himself, the damages being
equally divided between the Government
and himself.
The allegation Is made that the plaintiff
obtained a copyright for a map of the
Yukon gold belt, and that the defendant,
through his agents, "reproduced and pi-

Labor Against the Charter.
Union Labor League will liold a mass
i meeting at Scottish Hall next Saturday
I evening at 8 o'clock for the purpose of
j passing resolutions against the proposed
new charter. The league at present is
HERE IS THE WAY EXAMINER CIRCULATION BECOMES GENERAL
[From a Photograph Take n Specially for The Call.]
composed of three divisions. No. 1 is pre
sided over by Thomas Eagan; No. 2 by
Henry Spear, and No. 3 by Timothy Sul
livan. New divisions will be organized.
The members of the league are strenu
ously opposed to the new charter and
propose making a strong fight against it.
Prominent speakers will address the
meeting.
The Marble Cutters and Polishers'
Union is indignant at a statement in the
Examiner to the effect that it had deter
mined to vote as a body for the charter.
James McCarthy said on behalf of the
union last night that the matter had not
been formally dismissed, but that from
personal observation he believed that the
members unanimously distrusted the in
strument.
Shewbridge Had a Pistol.
Peter Shewbrldge, a blacksmith, was
locked up in the Seventeenth street sta
tion last night, charged with carrying a
concealed weapon and also with dis
charging firearms within the city limits.
Shewbridge. with other Jovial compan
ions, was in a saloon at the corner of
Seventeenth ar.d Mission streets, when
for fonie reason not yet ascertained he
discharged his gun. The report was heard
at the station, and Officers Crackburn
and Connolly wer^ sent out by Acting
Lieutenant Heggerty to ascertain the
cause. They returned with ShewbrldgÂ©
and locked him up. The pistol was warm
when found in his pocket.
ONE RIDE TO OLD OCEAN.
Electric Cars Soon to Run From the
Ferry to the Cliff House.
The last steel rail for the new electric
car line of the Market Street Railway Sys
tem, connecting the ferries and Fourth
and Townsend streets with the Cliff.
House, was laid yesterday, and within the
next ten days or two weeks the manage
ment hopes to have cars running to thÂ»
ocean beach.
The railroad company has been delayed
in changing from a steam to an electric
road that part of the line from Tenth to
Fourteenth avenue, on Haight street, as
the city is putting in a six-foot sewer.
Beyond this point to the ocean terminus a
double track of sixty-flve-pound st el rails
is already laid, the track partly ballasted
and in excellent condition. As soon as the
sewer is laid a second track will be con
tinued to Stanyan street, where one track
already connects with the down town car
line. Over 180 workmen are employed la
the reconstruction. The work Is being
done under the supervision of Superin
tendent of Construction H. H. Lynch and
General Foreman Thomas Eapan, who
have rushed it along in a most creditable
manner.
The five new stations, made from the
old waiting room at the Haight street en
trance to Golden Gate Park, are all ia
their new locations along; the line and
resplendent in new coats of paint. Each
has an individual name. The first sta
tion after passing the Haight street en
trance to trie park is at Fourteenth ave
nue, the foot of Strawberry Hill, and is
called "Huntlngton Falls.'" The second
station, at Twenty-fourth avenue, is "Lit
tle Lake;" the third, at Fortieth avenue,
is "Chain of Lakes;" the fourth, at the
curve near the ocean beach, is "Observa
tory," and the fifth, at the south side of
the tunnel and close to the United States
Life Saving Station, is "Boulevard."
These stations will be regular stopping
places for all who wish to get off or on.
For the purpose of handling the heavy
Sunday traffic to the Cliff House and
ocean beach three of the heavy observa
tion cars formerly in use are being fitted
up with powerful electric motors, and will
be used to haul three or four trailers, as
the traffic may require. It is expected
that the time from the ferries to the
ocean will be made in forty-five minutes.
There will be no cinders with the electrio
line.
Near Observatory Station at the ocean
beach the South driveway leaves the
Ocean boulevard in Golden Gate Park and.
paspes through a wide tunnel under the
electric tracks to the beach sands.

NURSES TO
GO WITH THE
SOLDIERS
Trained Men Are to
Care for the
Wounded.
A STATE RED CROSS SOCIETY
THE CALIFORNIA ORGANIZA
TIONS TO AMALGAMATE,
Generous Subscriptions to the Fund
Being Received â There Will Be
Much Relief Work to
Be Done.
A corps of about twenty-five trained
nurses will go with the invading army to
the Philippines. Major White, who will
be in command of the medical force of the
Manila army, has asked the Red Cross So
ciety to supply and equip that number
and arrangement* will be made to send
them on the transports that will carry
the soldiers. The nurses will be obliged
to enlist with the volunteers and they will
be under the direction of the army of
ficers. They will, however, be excused
from the regular drills and their duties
will bÂ« in the permanent or field hospitals.
Only strong able-bodied men are wanted
and they must be experienced in the care
of the sick and wounded.
The Red Cross Society's hospital at the
Presidio camp contained thirteen patients
yesterday. One of them was laid up with
a fractured ankle, one had measles and
another was laid up with a severe case
of tonsllltls. Three experienced nurses
who have volunteered their services to the
society are caring for the sick men.
Delegates from the various Red Crosa
organizations in the Sfate will meet this
afternoon at the Occidental Hotel for the
purpose of forming a State organization.
This step is being taken so that all who
have become identified with the work of
the Red Cross can work in harmony and
produce the most good. A central body
will be formed with executive functions
and they will work In conjunction with
the medical officers of the army.
The two battalions that arrived yester
day from Oregon were met at the ferries
by a committee from the Red Cross rio
ciety who provided a substantial lunch ci
sandwiches and hot coffee when they
stepped from the ferry that carried them
across the bay. The committee was com
posed of Mrs. W. H. Mills, Miss McKeown
and Mrs. c. R. Winslow. The lunch was
a great bracer to the men for their long
march to the camp at the Presidio and
the soldiers were profuse in their thanks
for the kindness shown them.
Many comfort bags are being received
at the Red Cross depot at 1G Post street.
The bags are made of denim, and they
contain buttons, thread, needles, pins and
safety pins. When open the bags are
about seven Inches long and two wide.
They are made t>> fold double, with a lap
and button to h"ld them closed. Coarse
needles are the best to put with them, as
men at host are never good sewers, and
It would be a difficult matter tor the sol
diers to thread a fine needle.
Subscriptions are being received In a
most satisfactory manner at the Red
Cross Society's headquarters in the Claus
Spreckeis building. Festerday the fund
nearly reached the $15,000 mark, and the
collectors of the organization say they
are just beginning. When the movement
was first started the society believed it
would have only about sO*) troops to care
for. but now they have over 13.0"0 in sight
that will to a great extent look to The
organization to provide them with the
comforts that the Government does not
supply. There is also a possibility that
the number In view may be doubled. It
Is said that the Pennsylvania troops as
well a? many other Eastern regiments
A SOLDIER'S COMFORT-BAG
may be added to the expedition that will
be sent to the Philippines, and hints have
been coming over the wires from the
military authorities in Washington that
the army bound to Manila may amount
to nearly 35.000 soldiers. The California
Red Cross Society will be looked upon to
act as the base or supplies for the needed
comforts that the American people will be
obliged to send to the front, and should
that be the oa.se the work of the organi
zation is only commencing:. The amount
collected will he only a small iracti<>u uf
â¢what will bo required. The California or
ranization will have to extend its boun
daries to embrace all the Pacific Coast
and middle west States. The Red Cross
knows no race, creed or foe. Its work is
to relieve suffering wherever found, and
as the occupation of the Philippines pro
fresses there will be much work to be
one among the natives and Inhabitants
of the islands.

THE CHAMPION OF WOMEN.
iMARY ELLEN LEASE, Who Will Lecture Here In
the Near Future.
The most prominent advocate of woman's suffrage In this country, Mary
Ellen Lease, will deliver one of her eh aracteristic lectures at the Baldwin
on Thursday evening. May 26. Mary Ellen Lease is perhaps the most
conspicuous of all the disciples of suffrage for the unenfranchised Bex. Her
career has been an exciting one, made up of events as stormy in their na
ture as the life of an active politician.
Kansas has been the scene of h<?r greatest efforts. Hardly a town or
city of that State but has heard her appeals for the enfranchisement of
women. Her tield of operations has not been restricted to Kansas, however,
for she has engaged in a suffrage crusade that extended over the gTeater
part of the middle West. Woman's suffrage is only one phase of her mis
sion. The primal cause to which she has pledged herself is Populism in
its purity and essence. In IS9O Mary Ellen Lease labored unremittingly to
defeat the Senatorial aspirations of Ingalls, and her efforts were attended
with much success. The last Congressional election in Kansas found her
a candidate for a seat in the lower house, but her ambitions received a se
vere shock, for defeat was her portion.
The local Populists and the woman's suffrage societies are planning a
reception in her honor. This will be her second appearance before the San
Francisco public. The subject of her discourse will be "The Signs of the
Times."
and all native daughters who can help in
that work are invited to be present.

RESPECTABLE WOMAN
THROWN IN PRISON
SERIOUS BLUNDER MADE BY L.
C. BAYER, A NEVADAN.
Mrs. Laura Bell, Wife of a Solicitor,
Arrested on a Charge of Grand
Larceny and Discharged.
Mrs. Laura Bell who was arrested
Tuesday afternoon on a warrant charging
her with grand larceny appeared before
Judge Joachimsen yesterday morning, and
as it was proved to be a clear case of
mistaken identity, the Judge at the re
quest of Attorney Gallagher discharged
the lady from custody.
Mrs. Bell is the wife of H. S. Bell, a so
licitor, living at 1923 Geary street. While
she was waiting at a drug store on Batter
street and Grant avenue for her friend,
Mrs. Frank Bauer, Policeman Morton
placed her under arrest at the request of
L. C. Bayer, a visitor from Nevada.
Bayer claimed that Sunday night he was
robbed of $120 by two women. One of
them, Lizzie Murphy, was arrested early
next morning by Policeman Barney Har
ter, and Bayer swore out a "Jane Doe"
warrant for the other woman. He had
seen Mrs. Bell standing at he drug store
and asked Policeman Morton to arrest
her. Morton called up the Central Police
Station and found that there was a war
rant. When he placed Mrs. Bell under ar
rest she protested vigorously, and ap
pealed to her friend Mrs. Bauer, who in
formed the officer that there was a mis
take, as Mrs. Bell was with her Sunday
night, but Bayer insisted that he had
made no mistake. A hack was called and
the two ladies were driven to the City
Prison. Bayer accompanying them.
Mrs. Bell was soon released onbondsand
her friends were very indignant over the
outrage to which she had been subjected.
In court yesterday after Attorney Gal
lagher had made his statement Policeman.
Harter informed the Judge that the wo
man who was wanted was known as
"Dimp" Butler, and if Bayer had nol
made such an unfortunate blunder she
would have been arrested, as her haunts
were watched.
Bayer was not in court and it is thought
that" he had realized his blunder and
would probably not be heard of again.
Mrs. Bell's friends propose to make it
particularly warm for him if he can be
found.

THE WIDOW AND THE
DANCING PROFESSOR
CHARGE OF THREATS TO KILL
AGAINST COLVIN DISMISSED.
He Promptly Swears Out a Warrant
for the Arrest of Mrs. Wallin on
a Similar Charge.
The strained relations between Fred H.
Colvin, the Mission dancing master, and
; Mrs. Alma J. Wallin, the widow who had
| him arrested for threats to kill, were dis
j cussed again in Judge Low's court yester
1 day and Colvin came out triumphant.
When the case was called Prosecuting
| Attorney Reynolds said he desired to put
â on witnesses to prove that Mrs. Wallin
i had given Colvin money, but Attorney
Bert strongly opposed the introduction of
j any such evidence. Finally the Judge
! consented to hear what the witnesses had
i to say and Mrs. M. J. Foster was called.
. She testiiied that she had seen Mrs. Wal
lin give Colvin $5, but in answer to the
Judge she admitted that she did not know
j whether it was Colvins money. Mrs.
Foster was proceeding to give her opinion
â â I Colvin When the Judge stopped her and
told her that she evidently had a spite
against the defendant.
"Have you any more witnesses?" asked
i the Judge.
; "1 want to show," said Reynolds, "that
Mrs. Wallin lias paid not only this man's
I rent but his board bills. He hasn't a cent
and yet he comes in here and wants us to
believe that he is a millionaire."
Bert took strong exception to the re
| marks of Reynolds, and while they were
arguing the Judge rapped for order, and
â  after drawing Reynolds' attention to the
| fact that Mrs. Wallin had also threatened
I to kill Colvin, he asked Mrs. Wallin if she
was still afraid that Colvin would carry
! out his threat.
"I do," shouted Mrs. "Wallin. "He is a
i dangerous man and has threatened to
! bring suit for damages against me for
â  having him arrested."
! The Judge asked Colvin If he would let
I the widow alone and he replied that noth
i ing would ploase him better. "I never
threatened her" he said, "and have no
intention of doing so."
The Judge thereupon dismissed the case,
which caused consternation among Mrs
Wallin and her lady friends.
Colvin, accompanied by his attorney lm
j mediately went to Judge Joaehinisen's
: court and swore out a warrant for the ar
; rest of Mrs. Wallin on a charge of threats
;to kill. Bert, in explanation, said that
; friends of Mrs. Wallin had told him that
she was irresponsible and he did not want
his client to take chances of being killed
without due protection.
BOBBED A BOY.
James Leonard, Aged 13 Years, Im-
posed on by a Mean Thief.
James Leonard, aged 13 years, who Is
employed by M. Levy of 12 Montgomery
street, is the victim of a despicable thief.
Yesterday afternoon the boy was sent to
deliver a suit of clothes to a Mr. Fields
who lives at 339 Jessie street. As he walk
ed along Third street he was accosted
by a well-dressed young man, who asked
him if he wanted to make 20 cents. The
boy replied in the affirmative and wa.s
handed a note adQresed to Mrs Clara
Wilson, living at 112 Fourth street.
The stranger, after giving- his victim
the stipulated amount, told him he was
anxious to get an answer and would hold
the clothes until he returned. After de
livering the note the boy returned to the
scene, and was surprised at not finding
the stranger. Realizing he had been
done up for the suit of clothes he notified
Police Officer O'Connor, who made a re
port of the occurrence to Chief Lees
Last night the boy visited police head
quarters and gave a description of the
thief. He described him as being about
2.". years of age and fairly well dressed
He wore a dark slouch hat and had a
small light mustache. Chief Lees was
Incensed when he heard the story of
young Leonard, and at once detailed two
of his best men on the case. If caught
the Chief intends to see that he Is se
verely dealt with.
"Pate" Strickland Dead.
Peyton G. Strickland, who died in La
Grande, Or., on the 25th of April, will be
remembered by many of the old-timers of
this State, for he was a resident of Cali
fornia for many years. He was one of
the pioneers who crossed the plains in
1549, when only a youth of 17 years. For
some time he mined, and then took to
driving stages out of Stockton to the
mines. Later Mr. Strickland handled the
ribbons on stages in the northern part of
this State, Oregon and Idaho, being one
of the best known in this line on the
coast. When well advanced in years he
settled down in the Blue Mountains in
Oregon, and a month or two ago he re
moved to La Grande. "Pate" Strickland
as he was familiarly called, was rated as
one of the most jolly and big-hearted
fellows of the earliest pioneers.

REINSURED
SHIP ARRIVES
The Leyland Brothers
Was Not Dismasted.
LIBELING OF THE IDA A.
A BOW BETWEEN RELATIVES
CAUSED THE TROUBLE.
Captain Charles Nelson Badly Hurt
at His Home by the Accidental
Discharge of a Gopher
Gun.
A couple of vessels reached port unex
pectedly yesterday. They were the Brit
ish ship Leyland Brothers, from Calcutta
for San Francisco, and the French hark
France Cherle, from Tahiti for Puget
Sound. A cable from Liondon received by
the Merchants' Exchange last Tuesday
stated that on March 30 the I^eyland Bru
thers had been spoken about 500 miles
east of Hawaii partly dismasted, so nat
urally she was not looked fur just yet.
The vessel is not damaged to any extent,
however, and insurance men are now in
clined to think that it may have been
the British bark Midas, from Nagasaki
for Astoria, that was spoken. The latter
is long overdue, and 80 per cent reinsur
ance has been paid on her.
Shipping men had become anxious for
the safety of both the Leyiand Brothers
and the France Cherte and were offering
reinsurance on them.
Captain Bailey of the Leyiand Brothers
reports that when two days out from
Calcutta he ran into a cyclone which
carried away one of the lifeboats from
the poop deck and did other slight dam
age. On April 16 the Pitcairn Islands
were passed, and some of the islanders
put off to the ship. They reported that
everybody was well in the colony, and
sent a number of letters by the Leyland
Brothers to their friends in San Francis
co. It took the ship 144 days to make the
run, and Captain Bailey explains the long
voyage by saying that outside of two
blows ho nad nothing but light winds and
calms.
The Franco ChÂ«rlÂ© is the old British
bark Beth Shan. She is 04t> tons net bur
den, and was built in Sunderland. Eng
land, in 1863. She 1b 174 feet 5 inches long,
29 feet 6 inches broad and IS feet 7 inches
deep. It took her forty-seven day.-s tv
come htre in ballast, while the Galilee,
which arrived here last Sunday from the
same port, made the run In twenty-nine
days. The France Cherie comes to Plnet
& Co. and is in search of a charter.
Captain Charles Nelson, the ship owner,
was able to be about ayain yesterday
after being coniined to his home at Semi
nal y Park since last Thursday. He met
with a most peculiar accident, by which
he lost the top of the forefinger of his
j right hand and hud the thumb shattered.
! The grounds around his home are infest-
I ed with gophers, and the gardener has
! for months past been waging war against
them. Thursday last he made a gopher
gun out of a piece of gas pipe and sot it
in front of the principal burrow. Captain
Nelson came home from the city and see
ing the piece of g-as pipe lying on the
lawn went and picked It up, intending to
throw it away. Directly he moved it. the
gun exploded, and for a minute the cap
tain thought his hand was blown off. A
physician was summoned and he had to
amputate the forefinger at the first Joint,
while the thumb was bound up and may
be saved.
Captain Searles went out in command
of the Mail Company's steamer San Jose
yesterday. There was wme friction over
some changes made by the general man
ager, and at the last minute Captain Mc-
Lean remained ashore and Captain
Searles had to take the vessel out. Cap
tain Pillsbury is a great favorite with
Lieutenant Schwerin, and when the City
of Sydney was chartered by the Govern
ment to carry troops to Manila Pillsbury
was given the command of her, ami Mc-
Lean was transferred from the Sydney
to the San Jose to take Plllsbury's place.
McLean is an old' and experienced navi
gator and he felt very keenly the slight
put upon him. The result was that the
San Jose went out without him.
The old tug Mary Ann, which came
down from Humboldt Bay some time ago,
has had her machinery taken out and is
now a tight little 96-to"n schooner.
The bark Martha Davis, now out sev
enteen days from Honolulu, la coming up
in command of Captain Friin. While the
bark was hen- lust a son and heir was
born to the regular commander, Captain
Soule, at his home in Honolulu, so he is
remaining ashore one trip to nurse the
baby.
Captain Albert Alien and Engineer An
drew Allen of the gasoline schooner Ida
A are in trouble with the inspectors of
Hulls and Boilers. The Ida A is owned
by Captains Anderson and Alien and
carries passengers and freight to Boli
nas Bay, while A. Sayers, a brother-in
law of Captain Anderson, runs a stage
coach between San Rafael and Bolinas
Bay, which also carries passengers and
freight. There is no love lost between
the shipping man and the stage driver,
and when Sayers found that the schooner
was cutting into his staging business he
began to look around lor a chance to
get even. During the fishing and camp
ing season the Ida A has a special licence
to carry forty passengers, but at other
times sho is only allowed to carry four.
As ill luck would have It, a few trips ago
Engineer Andrew Alien was taken nick,
an - while he was away trying to get
some one to take his place the captain's
wife and a couple of i.er friends came
down with the intention of making the
trip to Bolinas. They were on board
when Captain Alien came down without
an engineer and insisted upon going with
them. He had his full complement of pas
sengers without them, but was overper
suaded by his wife and took them along.
As he had been unable \o get anybody
to fill his brother's place he had to run
the engines himself. This was the oppor
tunity Sayers 1 id been looking for, and
he at once lodged a complaint with the
inspectors charging the owners of the
vessel with sending her to sea without a
licensed engineer and with more passen
gers aboard than the law allowed. The
cane will be tried In the United States
District Court, and the chances are that
both captain, the vessel and the owners
will suffer.
' .Ie work of potting 1 the Australia ready
for sea is now almost completed, and the
steamer could go at an hour's notice if
the lreight was aboard and the troops
ready. The soldinrs who will go on tho
Australia may bo sure of a pleasant
tr.p, as everything possible has been done
by the owners of the vessel for their com
fort. In the 'tween decks tiers of bunks
have been built, and every one of them
has been fitted with wire-woven nuit
tresses. whuc the same kind of furnish
ings have been provided as were used
for the first-class passengers when the
vessel was in the Klondike trade. A pns
sageway runs between each tier of bunks,
so that the men can come and go finely
and all the other accommodations are
ample. Things are different on the City
of Peking ami the City of Sydney, how
ever. The wnrk on them is not nearly in
such a forward condition as it fs on the
Australia, and it Is very doubtful about
their being ready by Saturday to receive
freight and passengers. The berths in the
'tween decks arf laid down five in a row,
and the man who sleeps next the sldo of
the ship will have to climb over four of
his companions in order to get Into his
bunk. When the Peking and Sydney get
to sea and the soldiers begin to get sea
sick there will be much discomfort in the
'tween decks.

Hanley and â¢ Murty Callinan, after a ' hot
chase of several blocks.
The bakery of W. Stempke, southeast
corner of Devisadero and Oak streets,
had been several times recently visited
by a burglar, who cleaned out the cash
drawer and also stole a shotgun, revolver
and other articles.
- It was decided to set a watch on the
place, and on Tuesday night J. H. Leise,
the clerk, settled himself as comfortably
as possible to await developments. About
4 o'clock in the morning he heard some
one opening, the front door with a key, !
and he stole silently to the door to grab j
hold of â¢ the Intruder; who had . discarded '
his shoes. Leise was observed by the
burglar, who promptly fled. .- . - â 
Leise ran after him, and kept blowing
a police whistle as he kept up the: pur
suit. -At Hamilton square the burglar j
turned sharply round- and, leveling a re
volver at Leise, threatened to shoot If
he persisted in following him.
Floyd, Hanley and Callinan heard the
police whistle, and made a break for the
scene. Floyd was the first to see the
fleeing burglar, and, jumping into a news
boy's cart, drove off in pursuit. At Web- |
ster street and Golden Gate avenue the :
burglar jumped onto a baker's wagon, ;
and was gathering up the reins to drive
off when the owner came out and seized
the horse by the bridle.
The burglar jumped off the wagon and
was confronted by Floyd. He showed
fight, but Floyd grappled with him and '
threw him to the ground. Just then Han
ley and Callinan arrived, and the hand
cuffs were soon encircling the man's i
wrists.
He was taken to the City Prison, where
he gave the name of Fred Simmons; but
the police say that his real name is Zim
mer and that he used â¢to drive a baker's
wagon and deliver bread at Stempke's
store. When searched a key was found in i
his pocket, which fitted the lock of the i
bakery door. A charge of burglary : was
booked against him.

Castake a Clever Winner
at Odds of 15 to I.
FLYING MAGDALENAS WINS.
CROMWELL, HEAVILY BACKED,
FINISHED UNPLACED.
Thorpe Again Piloted Three Winners
Past the Post â Imp. Devil's
Dream Led a Big Field
Out.
Just for a chang-e the racing at Oakland
yesterday was liberally spattered with
long shots. Magdalenas at 4, Castake, a
15 to 1 chance, and Joe Levy, quoted at
10 to 1 in the betting, being three horses
that liberally repaid their backers. Rec
reatlon and Carbineer were the only win
ning favorites.
The attendance continues good, with no
scarcity of coin in the betting ring. The
track was soft and slow, whioh suited
horses with suspicious underplnlng.
In the opening dash at four and a half
furlongs Malay and E. Come were equal
choices in the ring. E. Come did not
show speed enough to outfoot a "yaller
dog," while Malay was easily defeated by
the flying Magdalenas. against which 4 to
1 was laid. Oraibee, a 40 to 1 shot, was
third.
Colonel Dan, gam* leg and all, was
chalked up a 3 to 5 choice for the eix
lurlong sprint following, and the crowd
got aboard. Showing first into the
stretch, he was downed with ease the
final sixteenth by the 15 to 1 shot Castake,
ridden by Powell. Adam Andrew, the sec
ond choice, ended up in the show.
The speedy Stepabout was the favorite
furnished for the seven-furlong affair. She
was full of run to the stretch and then
blew up. Thorpe, on the 10 to 1 shot, Joe
Levy, took up the running when the turn
for home was rounded and won buck-
Jumping from Charlotte M, another long
priced outsider.
It seemed like a lack of judgment to
start Cromwell back in the mile and a
quarter after his hard race of the day be
fore, but nevertheless the chestnut Jiorse
was sent to the post a heavily backed 6
to 5 choice. He was either first or second
to the stretch and then grew tired, even
tually finishing in fourth place. Imp.
Devil's Dream, with Thorpe in the saddle,
proved a handy winner, leading Fortuna
out by three lengths. Rapido, well sup
ported to finish third, managed to take
that position. \_
It was the "copper on day for La Go
leta for in the second seven furlong event
Recreation, which was played down to 11
to 10 favoritism, downed the Baldwin filly
a scant length. The latter opened up at
' and receded to 11 to 5.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 19, . 1898.
DARLINGS OF HIGH DEGREE.
Some of the Beauties of the Blue-Blooded Show Now at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
GO TO THE
BOW-WOWS!
So Society and Sport
Recommend.
THE BENCH SHOW IS OPENED
A LONG LIST OF AWARDS AL-
BEADY ISSUED.
Dogs and Dog-Lovers Are Now Hav
ing Their Day of Delight at
the Pavilion.
Dog: days are in.
Any person who has the least doubt
that man's best friend is in evidence
should repair immediately to Mechanics'
Pavilion and see for himself.
The San Francisco Kennel Club, which
is composed of sportsmen who take spe
cial pride in exhibiting dog flesh coated
with silken hairs, is now in session. The
club and its many friends congregate
daily in tho big Pavilion, where dogs of
all breeds, colors, pedigrees and every
thing else combined that will tend to
make dogs what they should be when on
dress parade, are to be seen from the
hour of opening until the hour of closing.
This is the second annual dog show, or
bench show, more properly speaking,
which is bfing held under the auspices of
the San Francisco Kennel Club, and
judging from the numbers of high-class
"bow-wows" that are on the superior
benches, which are with and without
wiresâ barbed wires exceptedâ it goes
without saying that success should most
assuredly crown the efforts . of the pro
moters of dogdom who are endeavoring
to show superior stock, which can only
be attained through conscientious and
careful breeding. .
Curs of all kinds and colors can be seen
on -the streets of this city at all times,
but If the . people who take the least In
terest in high-class dogs desire to see ca
nines of superior- quality which beget
good breeding they must necessarily visit
Mechanics' Pavilion and judge for them
selves. . ;:â¢ â " â  '.'."â â  "â â â  â 'â â  ' â "â  â  -". â¢ ' :.>â  ',â  â 
The grand and intelligent head of the
noble St. Bernard is a study of admira
tion; the silken coat and beautiful feather
of the English setter attracts the eye
of the sportsman and fancier; the basso
prof undo tones that are sweet to the ear
of the hunter emanates from the ken
nels of the foxhound and at close range
the snarls - and yelps of the ; foxterriera
cannot fall â . to \ convince the most skepti
cal of observers that there Is really mu
sic In the savage breast. . t..~
The Judge. George Bell, was uo to his
eyes in business all day yesterday and
?ast evening, segregating the bad : stock
from the good; and with few exceptions
his awards were considered by local ex
perts as being very commendable.: To the
Judge's credit : it must be Â» said that he
loses very : little time, : excepting where
dogs are very closely matched in points
of quality, in deciding which ones are ;
entitled to the ribbons. Mr. Bell had no
little task, however,' in deciding; the win
ners of the greyhound classes. ; The long
tails j that came before 'â â  his critical " eye
were an I exceptionally fine . aggregation â of
"fliers.", ; His 'â  selections, - although not
pleasing :, to ; all < observers," were i accepted
generally . as being first \ class. It - would
be <â¢â  an - act â¢: of > utter , impossibility for â¢ â¢:< a
Judge to â  give general ! satisfaction ,to ; the
fanciers of : the allkcoated greyhound. *â >: ;;; : |-'
The kennels ; are : not as s profusely dec
orated this ; year as ;In past years, when
prizes - were offered for the â  best-decorated
kennels. .i Still , v there ' are ? some > benches '.
which | show : very .marked i taste, r and this
is very i manifest ' In r the \ tiers ' which i are
occupied 3by i the ; little ; growlers ;; so ;: dearly
cared for by the ladies. . ;-
In the English setter class is Harry p.
Scott'B Count. The dog is an excellent
animal, ajid a few weeks ago it received
considerable notoriety by swimming
across the bay from Berkeley to rejoin
his master, who had lost him there.
Awarding the Prizes.
The show Is excellently managed. Su
perintendent Oldham has natural execu
tive ability which has been enhanced by
hi 6 military training. He and Dr. F. W.
d'Evelyn were both on General RoÃerts'
staff on his famous march to Candahar.
Judge Bell on .the opening night has
proved that his reputation for firmness
and fairness has been well and fairly
earned. He is not afraid to withhold
prizes from dogs that do not deserve them
and that is the kind of judge wanted in
California, What is needed here is canine
education to show the people that any
oid dog Is not good to win a prize, and
what W required for that purpose is
plenty of good blood and breeding.
The mastiffs as a class were superior to
the lot usually shown here. California
Cube is a puppy dog of such promise that
if ne develops accordingly he will grow
into a phenomenon. Major was the win
ner in the open and limit classes and
Leon In the novice. In the winners the
phenomenal pup won out with Major
as reserve. Major showed up in poor con
dition, being far too fleshy, and having
sustained an injury to one of his legs
lately, was slightly lame. In this class
Mr. Bell's judgment was above criticism.
In bitches. Lola was shown with her
coat half shed and plainly showing lack
of proper conditioning. Withal, she won
first In open and limit classes, beating
Baby Ruth in the latter with ease. Cali
fornia Echo won in the puppy and Juno in
the novice. The winner's prize fell to
California Echo and the reserve to Juno.
Here, too, Judge Bell awarded the prizes
with excellent judgment.
In Great Danes, Mr. Bell's awards were
faulty and lacked in some instances the
appreciation of quality which character
ized nis mastiff decisions. In the puppieH
he opened by withholding ilrst and see
on- from Commodore Dewey, who did not
sustain the reputation of his high name,
and was barely entitled to the third prize.
In puppy bitches, Lady Londesborough
took first over Olga, which, however, sur
passed the winner in head tmd body, and
should have received the first The third
was justly withheld. The \ H C and H C
bitches should have been passed without
notice? dogs, Czar was way ahead of
In novice dogs. Czar was way ahead of
all competitors, and Jim Corbytt. the sec
ond dog, was miles behind, with the
others out of the race. . â¢â¢;- .-;â  â  .::'
In novice bitches Thelma should have
been placed over. Rebecca, who is weak in
fore and hind legs and good only In head.
In "limit" dogs Blinker. Murphy shows
great character, but is not the best brindlo
ever shown here. ,= However, he was
rightly awarded first place over Roderick
Dhu. who should have given way to Cor-
Ba in . limit bitches = there was little ,to
choose betwen Queen C and Queen Olga,
yet the latter has the better carriage and
should have received the award.
In open dogs Rex R, as usual, scored
over Ivan, who* was properly placed over
Defender. Both the two .first, dogs are
full of character, Rex R having the bet
ter expression, but Defender cannot com
pare with either except in body, and even
that is too thick for the breed. :; â â  ,; ..._.-.
In open bitches - Mr. Bell committed ; a
glaring and palpable mistake, for neither
the first nor second bitch ran compare
with j Juanita. who ,, to the surprise of all
beholders was placed third. , â â â  :^ :-;;Â«â¢'â 'Â«:â 
How on t earth *'- Mr. Bell could place
Queen first and Orchard Trilby second
and Juanita last is ; more than 1 can un
derstand. Orchard Trilby was rightly
placed, but Juanita and Queen should
have changed places, for the former is as
far superior to the latter as aHambleton
ian to a ' dray . horse. j Juanita surpasses
the others in 1 every - essential to â  the
make-up of , a good Great â  Dane, and Or
chard Trilby excels Queen in body and
limbs, though ; not in expression. . =^v vv-
Blinker Murphy ; was rightly given the
winner's prize, with ; Rex R as reserve,
and i Queen most . improperly received the
award am the winner's class of the
bitches, .^v â
<â ?. Rough-coated St. Bernards were not
up : to the ' average. '< In â¢: the puppy class
Pacha"' was rightly placed first. He has a
typical Â» head â  and "** good - â¢ markings, * but
seems . weak sin his s hind quarters. -- This
may improve with age. Parnell and ; Ma
jor" McKinley i were : properly placed with
second and ', third. ; :
; In novice class, Barry ; of Glen Rosa
won first;- his markings are excellent and
he shows much promise.: Second:, prize
fell to Duke, and the other exhibits of. the
class were ' poor. > ' â  . r c
One â¢novice-bitch : was shown, ... and of
such poor quality that the first prize was
withheld and the bitch, Lady Juanita R. !
received more than her due in the second
prize.
In limit dogs the order of the first two ;
was the same as the novice. Barry of i
Glen Rosa scored first and Duke D sec- :
ond; but King Menelek should have been
placed over him, as he is superior to the
Duke in head marking, body and limbs.
In limit hitches, Ramona W was the
only one shown. She is a sound specimen,
with fair marking, head and body, and
was rightly entitled to the first prize.
In open dogs Mr. Bell was again at
fault. The order of the winners was:
Prince Othmar first, Duke D second, ;
King MenHpk third and Omar Khayam j
last; hut both the second and third dogs j
are better than the first, which was
wrongly awarded the winner's reserve.
King Menelek was the best of the lot, and |
should have received the reward. Prince
Othmar lacfes quality, uiul is weak in
body nnd limbs.
In open bitches, Montana â  Queen was
awarded first over Alta Berna. who be
gins to show her age; yet she is a better
bitch than the winner, and should have
received the award. Her head is mag
nificent and her body and marking su
perior to Montana Queen's.
The winner's prize in dogs fell to Barry
of Glen Rosa, a tine dog, and the reserve
to Prince Ohmar, who was inferior to at
least two of the other dogs shown.
The winner of the bitches was Montana
Queen, with Ramona \V as reserve.
In smooth coated St. Bernards there
was little fault to be found with the
Judge's decisions. One puppy was shown,
Fulro of Havenstein, a very poor speci
men, with a very poor coat. Both first
prizes were withheld, and he was award
ed third.
Of the two novice dogs Ormonde, a fine
young dog, full of character, with a good
head, body and coat, was awarde-J nrst
over Leo of Havenstein, inferior in every
respect.
In limit dogs Ormonde was alono and
received first.
In open dogs Leo of Havenstein was
properly placed over Tom, a worse speci
men by fur than the winner.
That beautiful smooth coated bitch
Bianca II was absent (doubtless owing
to the error in the premium list), and as
she was the only smooth coated bitch en
tered no prizes In that class were
awarded.
In the winners Ormonde was again
placed first over Leo. reserve.
A poorer class of Newfoundlands has
never been shown in San Francisco.
In the novice bitches Gypsie was alone,
and all prizes withheld.
In the limit dogs Rey S and Sanco met
the same fate, and both go ribbonless.
In the open dogs and bitches one dog
w;is shown, George M. a fair but not re
markable specimen. He was well treated
in getting the first in his class and there
by scoring a winner's prize.
In fleerhound puppy dogs and bitches,
the dog Marco deservedly took the first,
hia litter sister Thora IV being placed sec
ond. Both are good pups full of promise.
In novice dogs Polo, a fairly good dog,
was alone and was awarded first.
In limit dogs and bitches. Valiant took
first over Thora 111. Both are so good
that the positions might have been re
versed without exciting invidious com
ment.
In open dogs and bitches. Lassie H, a
remarkably fine and handsome bitch, took
first, and Highland Chief second; the
third prize was withheld, and Derby
awarded V. H. C. only. In this connection
it may be well to call attention to the
severe commentary afforded by this de
cision on the Judging of Mr. Mortimer two
years ago, when the latter awarded to
Derby the place of second best dog in the
show.
The attendance was enormous and
among the crowd of exhibitors and spec
tators was heard less grumbling than at
any show ever held on this Coast. The
lot of a bench show judge in California is
proverbially hard, but Judge Bell seems <c
have fallen on a bed of roses. He is cer
tainly most conscientious and bids fair to
justify the high expectations formed by
his freinds on the Coast.

WAR AND BUSINESS.
EVERYTHING BRILLIANT IN SPITE OF
THE SPANISH WAR.
The circular of Henry Clews, the New York
banker, under date of New York, May 14. says:
"It is now nineteen days since the declaration
of war with Spain. Under ordinary condi
tions, the beginning of hostilities upon a
large scale and with imperfect preparations
might be expected to create disturbances of
confidence and serious prostration in all our
markets. This Is no more than has been com
mon In the experience of other nations. But,
In our case, war has thus far been attended
with a marked recovery of confidence in
.finance and a revival of activity in trade. The
"Government is devising plans of heavy taxa
tion and considering the authorization of large
loans; but the country finds in all this no
reason for contracting Its industrial operations,
the people no necessity for reducing their ex
penditures. Labor la well employed, and there
la no shrinkage in values to Indicate a falling
off in demand, but rather a general firmness
in the commercial markets, and. In some, a
material advance in prices. Nor is this rise
in values" due to any interruption of supplies
from other countries, for the Spaniards have
â so far been unable to check the current of our
Imports.. â -â¢::â¢.-.-:. .
"The state of feeling in the financial markets
surpasses the most sanguine expectations. In
anticipation of the war there was some anxiety
among the lenders of capital, which showed
itrelf in a material contraction of the loans of
the metropolitan banks and a disposition
among the interior- hanks to draw home de
posits from their agents in this city. Money
en call was cheap, but only because there was
an Indisposition to employ* it on time loans or
discounts. Within three short weeks all this
is changed. From the interior all reports show
a settled and' confident feeling, and currency
Is flowing hither from the subsidiary financial
centers. The note brokers , of this city, who
in April found it almost impossible to secure
buyers for their paper, are now able to dis
pose of it in about the normal volume. The
city banks are discounting quite freely and
have reduced their rates on time loans by 1%
to 2 per cent. In brief, credit operations have
resumed their normal course. New enterprises,
requiring large investments of capital, which
have been held in suspense for many weeks
in view of the possibilities of war, are now
coming to the front. again, and bankers in the
flotation business seem to be quite hopeful of
the prospect of investors supporting meritori
ous undertakings.
"In the stock market the reaction from the
ante-war depression exceeds all expectation.
Expressing my view in genuine Yankee phrase
and spirit. I should say that American citizens
have enhanced in the world's valuation at
least T>o per cent through the result of thÂ«
American-Spanish war. and everything Ameri
can will appreciate in the same ratio after the
war is over. Admiral Dewey marked up
American history over 100 per cent by smash
ins the Spanish fleet and at the same time
silencing Manila's guns in the short, sharp
and effective way be did it. It was the
American way of doing it. you know, and not.
Spanish. We can take Manila, Cuba. Porto
Rico, the Canary Islands and bang the Spanish
coast all to pieces whenever we want to. We
have the naval commanders; we have the gun
ners, we have the sailors: we have the ships:
we have the pluck: we have the skill; we hav<.
the weapons; we have the food supplies, and
we have the money, too. to back us all the way
through. What, therefore. Is the use of Spain
pretending to fight such a foe? It is simply an
evidence of Imbecility."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
ICEW YORK. May 18.â The bull campaign
Inaugurated yesterday on the Stork Exchange
promised well during the early part of to-day,
but before the close the advantage gained
earlier had all been lost and prices as a rule
were lower than last night, not only in the
specialties whose weakness Ptopped the ad
vance, but In the starfdard stocks and in those
which had led the advance as well. At the
opening the bull contingent had to face a series
of declines for Americans in London, but the
tendency of the London market after its open
ing was upward and the declines there were
ignored, prices here opening higher all along
the line. There was a fair volume of orders
to buy, which had come to commission houses
overnight as a result of the strength displayed
yesterday, and there was no selling for London
account to amount to anything. The early ad
vance was continued with vigor and confidence
led by People's Gas and Rock Island, which
gained about IV4 per cent each. The unsettled
tone of Tnbacco'and the large volume of trans
actions in it gave the first check to the ad
vance. When very heavy offerings of Sugar
were joined to those of Tobacco the bull cam
paign received an effectual check for the day
anil was not renewed. There was a conspicu
ous movement of Rubber preferred on the
strength of the good statement of the com
pany's business made at yesterday's annual
meeting. The price rose at one time 5% per
it-nt. The weakness In Sugar and Tobacco be
er, me more pronounced as the day progressed,
the extreme decline in both stocks reaching
to within a small fraction of four points. This
proved too heavy a burden for the market to
carry and prices fell away on a very dull
market until near the close, when there was
animation on realizing. The stringent meas
ures adopted by the Government to stop the
publication of news of naval operations has
proved efficacious, and information seemed to
be entirely lacking In Wall street to-day. This
tended to beget some feeling of nervousness
and doubt, which helped on the reaction. The
money market was not quotably lower to-day.
Bonds were dull all day and prices moved
very narrowly, but were well held In the late
reaction In the stock market. Total sales

CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 18.â It was a weak day in
Wheat, with the cables for the first time in
a long while proving a bear motive. Liverpool
was 2@3d lower, Paris loQooC lower, Antwerp
off 2"'Sf:6c. 'Western receipts were not so large
as they have been, but there was perfect
weather and good crop reports from every di
rection, even from abroad. The speculative
trade was light and pit temper excitable, al
though decidedly bearish. Declines were suf
fered all around in every market in the world.
July opened lc lower at $1 07, rose to $1 074,
declined to $1 05 and recovered to $1 05%. May
ranged from $1 40 to $1 50 and closed at the
lowest.
Corn for a while to-day showed steadiness.
It finally broke with Wheat, July showing a
loss of %c at the close.
Oats were neglected, but remained rather
steady. July closed %c lower.
The Provision market to-day proved a puzzle.
The market early made a dip, but as the ses
sion advanced the trading showed surprising
steadiness. Packers were buyers. At the close
July pork was 74c, lard 24c and ribs 5c
higher.

COALâ A circular for Australia says: "There
are eighteen vessels due here trom Sydney and
Newcastle within sixty : days. vÂ» Â«eh' about 44,000
tons of coal, all of which will come to a good
market, as our ' yards have but little on | hand.
The engaged Australian list for San Francisco
foots . up fifty-one â  vessels, â¢ with about 135,000
tons coal capacity; some of these will not leave
their loading port before " October next. Coal
freights have been advanced over two shillings
per ton from Newcastle â¢ sinct â - last , mail ; this
was fully expected, as shipowners are not dis
posed to seek this port.- when we have â¢so few
Inducements to offer for outward charters, our
Incoming wheat crop being, a comparative fail
ure. Our importers have benefited but little
by the increased r *-Â«= of ; freight from-Austra
lia, as the cargoes of fully 90 per cent. of the
vessels chartered were disposed of months ago,
hence our consumers are insured cheap . fuel.
"The American navy at Manila will call for
considerable coal shortly. A portion of same
will be shipped from here. . which will serve to
sustain values and deplete our stock on hand.
The general outlook Indicates high prices for
coal through the entire year, - and should prove
a banner season for our colliery proprietors In
British . Columbia and Washington, as our re
quirements will be nearly all drawn from those
sections." .-' < --:

last year. The sales from â  first hands ' were
60,434 bags, against 44,501. The stock in first
hands May 1 was 23,419 bags, against 35,160
May 1. 1597. The world's visible supply May
1 was 5,693,750 bags, against 4,348,800. The cir
cular says:
"As foreshadowed In our last review, there
Is little to say of the local market since the
27th ult. Sales in April from first hands and
speculators were about treble the normal vol
ume, and until those purchases are liquidated,
the demand will remain inconsiderable, â¢ buyers
having retired. Quotations are from hie lower
to unchanged, and the tone of the market is
steady. â ".'-. -

U. C. COMMENCEMENT DAY
PBOFESSOR JAMES ON "THE
MODERN UNIVERSITY."
An Alumni Lunch and Beunion Held
in Harmon Gymnasium
Features of the
Day.
BERKELEY, May 18.â The exercises of
the twenty-ninth commencement of the
University of California were held to-day
In the large tent erected on the lower
campus.
The programme consisted of the follow
ing:
Overture, "Orphee aux Enfers," Offenbach
prayer. Rev. T. C. Williams; etatement by the
president; Introduction and chorus, third act
â¢'Lohengrin," Wagner; address, "The Modern
tnlvenilty and Its Relation to Practical lAtn,"
I'rofeÃsor Edmund J. James of the University
of Chicago; "Tone Pictures From North and
South." Bendix; conferring of degrees, by the
?iresldent; delivery of military commissions, by
lia excellency, James H. Budd, Governor of
California; benediction. Rev. T. C. Williams.
At 10 o'clock the graduates, together
with the regents and members of the fac
ulty, assembled at Stiles Hall and
marched in order to the places prepared
for them in the tent. After a prayer of
fered by the Rev. Theodore C. Williams
of Oakland President Martin Kellogg
epoke of the progress made in the uni
versity during the past academic year.
He enumerated the gifts and favors ex
tended to the university by Its regents,
alumni and friends, comprising rare
books and manuscripts, funds, buildings
and lands. He spoke of the enlargement
of college activities, seen in the founding
of the new college of commerce, the suc
cess of the department of oriental lan
guages, and the erection of buildings for
the Affiliated Colleges in San Francisco.
The attitude and conduct of the student
body he especially commended, both for
their good sense shown in abolishing
rushes and for their success in athletics
and debating.
Professor Edmund 3. -lames was then
introduced as the speaker 'of the occa
sion. Professor James holds the chair of
political science in the University of Chi
cago, and he had chosen for his subject:
"The Modern University and Its Relation
to Practical Life."
"The century which is just drawing to
a close," he said, "will be known for
three great featuresâ wealth, democracy
and education. They are intimately as
sociated with each other and cannot be
divorced. Wealth and democracy go to
gether, nor would either be no.ssible with
out education. In the United States an
increasing proportion of our wealth is be
ing devoted to education. We are con
fronted with the question: How long is
this interest to last? TliÂ£ answer is to be
found In a consideration of the modern
university, its aim, its function and its
relation to modern life.
"The university *ls the highest educa
tional institution of the community, the
home and center of science, using that
term in its broadest significance. It has
two ways open to Itselfâ either, on the one
hand, to become a mere purveyor of the
past, as in China, or, on the other, to
train the student himself to become an
investigator and a scientist, in the broad
cense of the term. The latter has been
the fundamental conception in Germany
and the contribution of the German uni
versities to modern thought. It goes with
out saying that the professor under the
latter system must embody this spirit,
must himself be an original, independent
investigator, if he is to have any influence
upon his students.
â¢'The university should recognize all
branches of science. It should be, in the
words of Mr. Cornell, a center where any
man could learn anything. The human
ities, the natural sciences, both theoreti
cal and applied, and the political and so
cial sciences, should each have a place,
for each has its own special function and
significance. All careers which come
within the domain of the sciences are
proper objects for preparation and uni
versity recognition."
Here Professor James took occasion to
commend the College of Commerce,
founded recently by the Board of Regents.
"Such a department is needed," he said,
"because the control of modern society is
passing into the hands of the business
classes. The modern world Is ruled by
A GLANCE AT
REAL ESTATE
Condition of the Market
the Past Week.
BIG SALES ARE RARE.
INCREASE IN VALUE OF
COUNTRY PROPERTY.
A Review of the Records, Recent
Sales, New Building Contracts
and General Realty
Notes.
Business In the realty world is grad
ually assuming a long-looked-for life aft
er the weeks of continued stagnation that
have characterized its general progress.
With a knowledge that the war cannot
possibly affect the real estate property
of this city, the doubt that has heretofore
generally existed to the contrary is grad
ually disappearing, and sales are becom
ing more common. Together with this
fact the brightening prospects that have
been Indicated for the future by the per
ceptible growth of life in the market
during the past week have gone far and
done much toward encouraging real eÃ
tate brokers and convincing the general
public that the embargo is at last
broken.
The rain -which fell In torrents the last
few days, although not generally felt as
an advantage In this city, has come like
a beacon of hope and prosperity to tho
country markets. The success of the
grain and fruit crops means the payment
of mortgages, the Imminent foreclosure
of which meant death to the farmers' In
terests and a suspension of real estate
progression as a natural consequence.
The rain will greatly affect pasture lands
and Increase their value, which has been
steadily deteriorating from the devastat
ing effects of the continued drought.
I City real estate, although expected to
I Bhow progress before the month Is over,
* made little advance during the past week,
the only really Important transaction be
ing the sale of the property on Turk and

A noticeable increase In Urge roort- ]
commercialism, and it rests with the mod
ern university to make it broad or nar
row in spirit. Such a department would
satisfy the needs and wants of young men
who themselves enter business; it would
lead to the improvement of business
methods, and spread intelligence about
economic problems. And, moreover, it
would strengthen the university by bring
ing it more in contact with the people at
large, by serving the needs of all classesâ
the business man, as well as the lawyer
ftnd physician."
Touching briefly upon the university as
a center of moral training, the speaker
elicited much applause by concluding with
a splendid tributo to Admiral Dewey,
holding him up as a man whose untiring (
preparation and unfaltering courage were i
well worthy of every student's emulation. j
The audience was in a patriotic mood, j
and it rose en masse to sing as the band
played "The Star-spangled Banner."
The graduates then received their di
plomas from the president of the univers- I
Ity. From the colleges at Berkeley two
received doctors' degrees, twenty mas
ters' degrees, and 211 bachelors' degrees. 1
From the affiliated colleges in San Fran- j
Cisco 105 received doctors' degrees. The
commissions delivered by his Excellency j
James H. Budd, Governor of California, I
were given to all the officers of the two j

GIRARD IS NOW A
GOOD REPUBLICAN
VERY SORRY THAT HE VOTED
FOR WILLIAM J. BRYAN.
His Repentance Rewarded by Being ,
Elected to a Second Ward
Office â No One Threw
Any Stones.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 18.
The Second Ward Republicans have or
ganized for the campaign, and one of
their primary objects is to secure a united
delegation to the State convention, so that
the nomination of the Governor from Ala
meda County will be made possible.
The insertion of this clause in the con- i
stitution and by-laws was not decided j
upon until after a hard struggle. The ef- j
fort to secure its passage originated with !
the Pardee members of the club, who |
were largely in the majority. John E. j
Farnum, who presided over the last Coun- \
ty Republican convention, led the oppo- |
sition, but was largely outvoted. Mr.
Farnum is one of the executive commit
tee for W. R. Davis, and he opposed the I
adoption of the unit clause on the ground !
that such practices had been declared
against by the National Republican con
vention.
John Russ was elected president, and
the following vice-presidents were named:
J. C. Wlxon. C. A. Bond. Don F. Miller, |
E. A. Heron and Dr. J. L. Milton. Morti- j
mer Smith and John Bonham are the sec- I
retaries.
Councilman F. R. Girard, who was a j
prominent worker for William J. Bryan. J
was proposed for treasurer, but he con
siders it necessary to make a public con- !
fesston before accepting the office. "I |
should decline the position because I need
punishment for voting for W. J. Bryan,"
declared Mr. Girard. "But let me say
that my first vote in this country was for !
Abraham Lincoln, and I voted the Repub- I
lican ticket always until last election. !
when I voted for Bryan. Now, if there is
a man in this throng who has always i
voted a straight ticketâ who never voted
a scratched ticket â let him step forth and
throw the first stone at me."
It was agreed that Mr. Girard's repent
ance was sincere and no one threw any
stones, so his election was unanimous.
Italy's ingenious use of the postal card
might be copied very agreeably in this

are canceled and the receiver of the
card collects the money.

SHE CLAIMS
THE ESTATE
Hoffman's Stepdaugh
ter in the Field.
TO OUST OTHER HEIRS.
HUSBAND AND WIFE
JOINT WILL.
The Instrument Is Now Contested,
There Being a Large Prop
erty Left.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. May 18.
Twenty-five years ago Joseph Hoffman
and his wife, who lived in West Oakland,
and who possessed considerable com
munity property, each made a will. The
tenor of the will was precisely the^eame
in each Instance, and both husband and
wife were anxious to provide for the one
which should survive the other.
The will of Hoffman stated that all their
estate was community property and that if
he should die first all his Interest in the
I estate should pass to his wife. The will
j made by Mrs. Hoffman provided that her
I interest should go to her husband, should
he survive.
A few months ago Hoffman was found
! dead in his house and it was thought that
<â  he had died intestate. A search for a will
! proved fruitless, and the Public Adminis
! tra.tor applied for letters on the estate.
j His application is contested by a step
| daughter of Hoffman, who clr.ims to be
I the heir to Mrs. Hoffman's portion. The
| court is called upon to decide whether or
I not any part of the estate belongs to the
i heirs of the wife.
Mrs. Hoffman died several years ago
I and her estate was not administered upon
i by anybody, but remained intact with
i that of her "husband. When Hoffman died
some time elapsed before the two wills
were found, and the stepdaughter in her
petition states that she is entitled to the
community interest of her mother. The
I heirs of Hoffman who are indirectly rep
i resented by the Public Administrator as
| cert that according to the will left by Mrs.
I Hoffman her interest in the community
| property passed to her husband, and that
I therefore there is nothing upon which the
| heirs can administer.
On the other hand, it is claimed by the
i stepdaughter's attorney that the pnep
i erty being community property must of
i necessity belong equally to husband and
1 wife and that the fact that Mrs. Hoffman
i willed her share to h^r husband and that
| her estate was not administered upon does
| not estop her heir at this time from claim
ing her interest. The two petitions will be
heard in the Superior Court next week.
SOULE FOB BBIGADIEB.
OAKLAND, May IS.â M. Gibson, once
a Judge of the Superior Court of this
county and a colonel in the army during
the civil war, forwarded the following dis
patch last evening to Senator Perkins:
"OAKLAND. Cal.. May 17. IS9S.
"Hon. George C. Perkins, United States
Senate, Washington City, D. Câ l sug
gest Professor Frank Souie, West Pointer,
for brigadier-general. .
"E. M. GIBSON."
Mr. Soule graduated from West Point
in 1566; was ordnance instructor for three
yfars and. was In charge of the ordnance
bureau at Plttsburg for two years and lias
been a State University professor since
IS7I.
Â« â¦ â 
Tried to Snatch a Purse.
OAKLAND, May IKâ A robber attempt
ed to snatch a purse from the hands of
Miss Harriet M. Sherwood, who lives at
937 Adeline street, last night. Miss Sher
wood had just emerged from her home,
and as she reached the sidewalk the man
approached and, grasping ncr arm, de
manded her purse. The lady fought with
her assailant, and at the same time
screamed for help. The screams attract
ed attention and the robber fled, but
without the purse.
Mothersole's New Lease.
OAKLAND, May IS.â Georgf F. Mother
sole, who was the first manager of the
Macdonough Theater, has taken the lease
and management of the Oakland Theater
from W. Spencer. Mr. Mothersole has
long believed that a theater in this city,
presenting first class plays at popular
prices, is really needed, and he will now
ciarry out his ideas. The patriotic play
"Triss" is drawing big houses this weeek.
Bills of Fare in Fashionable Res
taurants.
The question has been mooted over and over
again whether the engrafting of French and
German dishes upon the bills of fare of the bet
ter class of American restaurants is or is not
an improvement. Many pretend that before
their introduction our cooking was coarse, bar
baric. This is an open question, but no bill of
fare presents attractions to the dyspeptic, but
they like the bilious, malarious and persons
with' weak kidneys, can be cured by Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters.

Sacramento Club Was
Offered for Sale.
CALIFORNIA IN THE EAST.
SAM MERTES, THE SWINGER,
â MUST REFORM.
Bright and Newsy Notes of the Local
Teams and Their Individual
Members â Games in
View-
By Joe Corbett.
Four two-baggers Is hitting the ball.
Mr. Stultz made this record in last Sun
day's game at Fresno.
At the last meeting of the consolidated
leagues. Messrs. Kripp and Hennesy of
fered to sell the Sacramento club, in
cluding lease of grounds, for $2300, and
there were no bidders, or, rather, there
were no takers. I am of the opinion that
Kripp and Hennesy were but "Jesting."
It seems absurd that this club, the best
drawing card in the league, could bo
bought at such an insignificant figure.
Don't make that proposition again,
"Spike," or Bunker of sausage fame will
surely buy you out.
California players are going right to
the front back East, the latest one taken
under the "wing" of the Major League
being Sam Mertes. This is Sam's sec
ond chance in fast company, and it is
to be hoped that he remains there. Cali
fornians who have watched him play are
unanimous in the opinion that he is a
gTeat player, his base running especially
being much admired. However, an in or
out fielder must have the other very nec
essary qualificationsâ fielding and bat
tingâas well as base running. Sam, in
my opinion, swings too nervously at the
ball when batting, and will experience
the same difficulty in connecting with it
as he did in '96, if he does not practice
"snapping at ttu- ball." Pitchers tnrow a
much faster ball in the National League
than most people imagine. To bat them
sucessfully, one must meet the ball, not
swing with all ones might. When Mertes
joined the Philadelphia club two seasons
ago he was a failure because he could
not bat. I watched his work very closely,
on account of his being a San Francisco
boy, and know that he was unable to
connect with the ball, principally through
his â¢'swinging tactics." During his slight
engagement here with the San Francisco
club a month or so ago t'ne methods em
ployed by him when at bat were the
same. He could afford to "swing"
against the pitchers out here, however,
as they are hardiy fast enough to compel
Eastern players to do otherwise; yet I
predict that if Sam does not learn to
meet the ball for a base hit instead of
endeavoring to knock the cover off. his
troupes will be similar to those experi
enced in '96. As a feeder and base run
ner he has few superiors in the National
League. His success in those depart
ments is assured, yet the sooner he
learns that snapping or meeting the ball
is the correct ana proper way to bat the
Quicker will he reach the top of the
ladder.
The Fresno team is putting up a great
article of ball at present, and from every
indication trill continue to do so. What
they will accomplish when on the road is
a rather delicate proposition to handle. ;
Manager Hennesy thinks they will go to
the bottom when away from Fresno, so
hurry up, "ye raisin growers"; we fans
up here want to get a line on how you
win games. To show there is no lack of .
"patriotism" in your part of the country,
bring up a few carloads of raisins when
you come; Col. T. P. is a trifle shy and
there is nothing like being generous.
"I saw Hughes." says an Eastern play
er, "before Jennings or the tourists
reached California, and I recommended i
him to Canny Mack weeks before the
Baltlmores and All-Americas arrived at
the coast. For .^nme reason or other 1
failed to reply to my letter until
Jennings had Hughes signed with the
Baltimore?.' Mack's negligence was a
good thing for Hughes. Had he Joined j
the minor leagues there is no feeling i
when he would have been given a chance
to mix in fast company.
Umpires can spoil a game as well as
A lulse decision by the umpire
is often as disastrous as a ghastly error
by a fielder, so far as the artistic points
oi' the game are concerned. Umpires haVe i
spoiled many a game where the spoiling
Lttributed to the player. And why?
Because the error of the umpire inspired j
doubt, indifference and lack of confidence
in the player. Such is the philosophy of
Manager Coffroth.
Henry Krug has a delivery similar to j
that of Wilson, now pitching for the \
Glevelands. Hennie is doing just as good
w^rk, too.
Another scalp for Hughes. The "Qua
kers" of Philadelphia fell down before his i
mysterious caroms Wednesday, and in j
winning that game Hughes stopped what â¢
appeared to be a "slide down the tobog
gan" for the Baltimore club. I cannot
understand why Hanlon is pitching
Hughes und McJames so often. In the j
case of Hughes, 1 am afraid he is not
acting wisely. The season is very long, j
and when the real hot weather sets in a I
pitcher must be strong. Hughes, I under- j
stand, likes warm weather, but he won't
think so much of it if he permits
Hanlon to work him out before it arrives.
There is nothing like looking out for your
own interests in baseball. If you don't,
nobody else will, and I am talking now
from experience. Hughes should not i
pitch over two games a week at the most.
He might be strong enough to stand it,
yet it does not bring any more money, j
and very little thanks. With Hoffer and
Nops pitching good ball. Hughes might
pitch seven games a week. Should his
arm become sore there is a chance for
rest. The way things are at present, !
however, it would be impossible to give I
him a rest, as Hoffer and Ross are !
having very bad luck and Hanlon only i
likes to work those who can win; he has |
little use for the loser. Therefore "Jim- ;
mie" should remember that old proverb,
"Charity begins at home."
Pitcher Thomas of Fresno from all ac- |
counts is a "wonder." Last Sunday he let j
Stockton down with one nit and one run,
also striking out seven men. Very muchly !
"a la Hughes."
Pink Mclntyre has been suspended for ;
one month, reason kept secret. This I
should be a warning to all players who j
are inclined to be "giddy." The league !
will not tolerate conduct that is not of the j
best, and should be complimented for such '
a stand.
The "Athletics," comprising as it does
the "creme de la creme" of the San Fran
ciscos and Olympics of the defunct Pacific
Coast League, is now considered one of I
the strongest teams in the league, which !
fact was clearly demonstrated when a
week ago they met and defeated the
"Beachcombers" by a score of score of 14
to 8 on their own grounds.
Jack Johnson and "Blockers" Hanley
have been appointed sole agents, for a
patent arm medicine. They claim it will \
do wonderful things with a "dilapidated
arm" (surh as Blockers') and all the
players are now using it.
"Contsey" Billings Is satisfied that i
Fresno lias the best team in the league, j
but "Cootsey Wootaey" was in Fresno j
when he made that statement and cvi- |
dently forgot that San Francisco was |
still supporting a team, which Is second to
none in the Stat.\

MANY SURPRISES SPRUNG DUR
ING THE ENTERTAINMENT.

Plenty.
"If you want to sea the real thin* in
fighting without incurring the risks of
! travel and fever in a trip to Manila you
â¢ must take in a tournament of an ama
â  teur athletic club. For a small admis
; sion one is presented with slugging, sci
: ence and singing, all of which will bring 1
i out all the enthusiasm you possess," said
! an old ringgoer last night.
He was leaving the clubrooms of the
San Francisco Athletic Club, after wit
nessing the close of an exciting amateur
tournament from a hard board seat in
the gallery when he said this, and every
one within the sound of his voice backed
him up by nods of acquiescence and
passed out into the night.
A more enthusiastic gathering of fol
lowers of the game of "block and get
away" never witnessed a more surprising
end to a tournament than that last night.
Every one present felt positively certain
that there was only one man in the fray,
and that was a lad named Pries. Many
were so sure of his winning that they ex
changed bets On the result. They figured
that Pries' fine showing at a previous
meeting, when he knocked the man he
was to meet round like a shuttlecock,
was enough to insure their money.
They might have won their money and
had the satisfaction of picking a winner
but for the overconfidence of their choice.
Pries felt so sure he would win that he
did not devote as much time as he oueht
to training for the event. On the otner
hand, Dierks, profiting by the last meet
ing, trained to a nicety, and with a de
termination to win. He showed the lat
ter spirit at the sound of the gong by
poing- at his man, with head lowered,
pell-mell. The onslaught was so unex
pected that Pries tried to check his ardor,
with the result that he was soon winded.
Lack of condition hampered him through
out the next three rounds, but he .still
showed that he possessed remarkable
science. The aggressive work of Dierks
gained him a decision.
Afterward a long and lanky youth
named Perry, who by force of arms and ,
grit managed to get in the finals, boxed a
bye with a rotund lad named Kenny, and
when both men were completely rested
the closing bout to decide the champion
ship was put on.
Perry proved himself to be a clever
two-handed fighter, with a complete
knowledge of the game. He was able to '
land on powerful young Dierks at will, not
without receiving some hard smashes in
return. Both lads were willing, and dur- |
ing the four rounds set a fast and merry ;
clip. Trained to the minute, they went
the distance without over-puffing, and
when the men went to their corners a
howl arose from the throats of the audi
ence in favor of Perry, ihe judges were ;
quick to respond by awarding Perry the
championship, amidst more howls. Again
\v;is the talent dumped. They had fig
ured on Dierks as a winner and had bet
accordingly. Although many were losers
the outcome of the contests proved en
tirely satisfactory, as the best man
earned his laurels.
Many would like to see Pries and Perry
in the ring as opponents, and it is more ,
than likely that a meeting will be ar- j
ranged.
Among the boxers to appear were: Dean ;
and Smith. O'Brien and Suter. deaf- !
mutes, and Granfield and Condon. Mr.
Hanson sang and James J. Jeffries lent I
pugilistic dignity to the affair by his !
presence.
Efforts are being made to match Char
ley M^Keever and Frank McConnell.
THE BOSTON QUARTET.
Another Success Scored by the Knei-
sel Combination.
The second concert given by the Knelsel
quartet from the Boston symphony or
chestra at Sherman. Clay & Co.'s Hall
last evening only served to deepen the
favorable impression made on Monday.
The audience was larger, and, if any-
thing, more appreciative, and six and
seven recalls after many of the move
ments were frequent-
The quartet in D major by A. Bawdine
was a novelty, and the dainty Scherzo,
the dreamy Notturno and wonderful An
dante-Vivace carried the house by storm.
In striking contrast was Schubert's pos
thumous quartet, "Death and the Maid
en," which received a delicacy of treat
ment rendered more exquisite by the
power and strength which lay beneath it.
Schumann's quartet in A major, op. 41, No.
3, was the final and most popular number,
and at the conclusion of the "Assai agi
tato" the artists had to bow again and
again. In all throe works the players
again showed a unanimity of feeling and
perfection of ensemble which can only be
gained by adequate preparation and long
association. The audience, as usual, was
late, but Kneisel and his associates dis
played a commendable patience by wait
ing" until every one was seated.
After the concert the Bostonians were
tendered a reception and banquet by the
Orpheus Club at its rooms on O'Farrell
street. The last concert in this city will
be given Saturday afternoon at Sherman,
Clay & Co.'s Hall.
IN AID OF ST. PATBICK'S.
Successful Entertainment Given in
Odd Fellows' Hall.
There was a most successful entertain
ment given in Odd Fellows' Hall last
evening for the "benefit of the bazaar to
be held by St. Patrick's parish. Music,
vocal and instrumental, made up most of
the programme, and encores were as nu
merous as the numbers rendered. The
programme was not a long one, and the
reason was plain when at its close it
was announced that the floor would be
cleared for dancing. The audience was
just well enough divided to make danc
ing a most acceptable diversion, and it
was well along toward lateness when the
last couple left the floor. Those in charge
of the entertainment were: Miss Mary E.
Flaherty, who afterward acted as floor
manager; Mrs. R. Reid, Miss Mary Bar
rett, Miss Mary Leonard, Miss Margaret
Sullivan and Miss Klttie O'Neil.
Mantell's Extended Engagement.
Robert Mantell's present engagement at
the California Theater has been so sue-
cessful that arrangements have been
made by which the dates for his appear
ance at near by cities have been canceled
and the actor will remain for another
week begining with next Monday night.
The production of Charles Osborne's "The
Face In the Moonlight," which Mantell
and his company are presenting this week,
has been an unqualified success. It will
be given to-night and again on Sunday.
The repertoire for the coming week has
been arranged for the presentation of the
charming romance. "A Secret Warrant."

Wednesday and Thursday nights Mr.

Bobbed a Blind Man.
Patrick Brady, a blind peddler of pen
cils, key rings and shoe laces, swore to a
complaint in Judge Low's court yester
day for the arrest of a bedmaker at the
Revere House, 675 Mission street, on a
charge of petty larceny. He said he en
gaged a room there Monday morning, and
he missed his valise. When he accused
the bedmaker of taking it he was kicked
and an attempt was made to throw him
downstairs. He had to buy a new outfit

Convention of Officers and Delegates
of the Companions of the Forest,
A. O. F.
The first session of the Supreme Grand
Chele of the Companions of the Forest,
A. O. F., was held Tuesday in Forest
ers' Hall. There were present all the
supreme grand officers and delegates from
thirty-one circles, whose credentials wera
favorably passed upon by J. J. Roberts of
Piedmont Circle. Mrs. Fannie Jonas of
Eureka Circle and Mrs. William Wetmore
of Pride of the Forest Circle. There were
also present three past supreme officers
and seven members of the executive
board.
The supreme grand president, Mrs.
Sarah Beversen, delivered her address
which shows that during the past year
the supreme inner guaid, Mrs. Lena
Schweitzer, resigned, and that Mrs. M.
Ash was chosen to fill the vacancy; that
twelve death claims were promptly paid;
that while tho order did not make any
great gain in membership during the year
it is still doing well and everything is
harmonious; several new circles have
been instituted in the Kast, and there are
piospects of new ones being instituted in
this State shortly. She expressed her
t banks to John Falconer. P. S. G. C. C,
for assistance, and to Mrs. Florence N.
Morrow, the grand secretary.
.k communication was read from the
subsidiary high court of the Ancient Order
of Foresters announcing that the resolu
tion adopted at San Jose recognizing the
( ornps&nions of the Forest as a branch of
the Ancient Order of Foresters had been
ail.rmed by a unanimous vote, which in
formation was received with applause.
It was decided that there should be no
c!ia::ge in the written or unwritten work
of ihe order.
The report of the committee on the state
of the order showed that at the previous
session thfe order was In debt, but that
since, by careful and economical man
agement, all obligations had bee,n met and
that there was a sufficient sum to meet
all expenses of the convention and still
have a balance on hand. The membership
of the order is 1548.
At the session of the Grand Circle yes
terday Mrs. Nevins and Mrs. Ninnis, pa-st
officers, who had resigned from the order,
were restored to their former standing.
The following were elected officers for
the current year:
Mrs. Sarah Beversen, grand supreme chief

STRUCK THE GRIPMAN.
A Bow on a Street Car Leads to the
Arrest of Frank Brown.
Frank Brown, who Is employed in the
office of the United States District At
torney, was arrested last night on a
charge of battery. Brown and a friend
named J. B. Shexrard boarded a Market
street car, and had some words with the
conductor over the payment of their fare.
Sherrard, It is claimed, struck the grip
man in the face, almost knocking him
down. The conductor, fearing further
trouble, blew a police whistle, which was
answered by Officer Morrissey. As the
conductor pointed out Brown as the man
who struck his fellow-workman, the of
ficer placed him under arrest. Shortly
after he was locked up in the City-
Prison Sherrard appeared and put up $20
rash bail for his release. He admitted
that he was the cause of the disturbance,
and threatended to "do it again" under
similar circumstances.
The Opposition Withdrew.
A meeting of the stockholders of the
Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Com
pany was held yesterday afternoon for
the purpose of electing officers for the
ensuing year. There had been rumors of
a clash among the stockholders, but when

TWO REPORTS
AS TO HAWAII
House Committee For
Annexation.
A SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION
FOUR OF THE MEMBERS
FAVOR IT.
Some Logical Arguments Advancec
in Opposition to Acquisition of
the Islands by This
Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Ri&STS House,
Washington, May 18.
Chairman Hltt has presented the
majority report of the House Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs in favor of
the annexation of Hawaii by Joint
resolution. It states that the proposi
tion is not new to either Government.
For fifty years it has been apparent
that so small and feeble a Government
must be merged with a stronger
power.
The report states that "there Is no
undue pressure on the part of the
United States as a great power; no
surprise to any one; no possibility of
objections by other governments. It is
1 simply the obvious result of the natural
course of events through a long period
of years, thus completed with the cor
dial consent of the sovereign powers of
both governments. The only question
involved is whether the proposed pos
session of the Hawaiian Islands would
! be advantageous to the United States."
The strategic importance of the isl
: ands is then discussed, also the risk
of delaying acquisition, as there is dan
ger of the islands falling under Japan
; ese influence and control. American
commercial interests would be pro
moted and action, the report says,
would do away with foreign complica
i tions over the islands. A brief argu
: ment is made upon the subject of ac
l quiring territory by legislative act, and
it is declared that there is nothing In
the constitution to prevent such acqui
sition. In conclusion the report says:
The acquisition of these Islands does not
contravene our national policy or tradi
tions. It carries out the Monroe doctrine,
which excludes European powers from
interfering In the American continent and
outlying Islands, but does not limit the
United States; and this doctrine has been
long applied to these very islands by our
Government. As Secretary Blame said, in
1881, the situation of the Hawaiian Islands,
giving them strategic control of the
North Pacific, bring their possession with
in the range of questions purely Ameri
can.
The annexation of these islands does
not launch us upon a new policy or de
part from our time-honored traditions of
caring first and foremost for the safety
and prosperity of the United States.
The minority report on the Hawaiian
annexation question, signed by Messrs.
Dinsmore, Clark, Williams and Howard
of the committee, sets out eight reasons
against annexation and offers a substi
tute resolution practically establishing
a protectorate over the islands.
It declares that the Hawaiian people
have not been consulted, nor have the
American people, charging that . the
only hope for action is under the cry
of "war emergency" before the people
can be consulted. The other counts
specified against annexation are that
annexation in the manner pro
posed is unconstitutional; the islands
are too remote and furnish too
much additional coast line to be
defended; the population is not racially
nor religiously nor otherwise homo
genous with our own; political domin
ion of the islands is not commercially
necessary; the islands are not from a
naval or military standpoint necessary
to our defense; and, admitting that its
foreign occupation would be dangerous
to us, and that there exists a single
nation willing, in the face of our re
peated diplomatic declarations of our
position, to incur the dangers of war
with us in order to seize or hold them,
this danger may be met when the first
overt fitcr ffr open domonstration shows
its actual existence, or may be pre
vented by the passing of the minority
resolution heretofore cited.
GRADUATING CLASS BANQUET.
Brilliant Affair Given by the Univer-
sity of California Alumni.
The banquet given "last night at the
California Hotel to the graduating class
of '98 by the Alumni Association of the
University of California was a brilliant
affair. The bnnquet hall was patriotical
ly decorated with a profusion of Ameri
can flags, and the guests, to the number
of 150. partook of an elaborate menu.
William R. Davis, '74, presided at the
feast, while on his right sat Pro
fessor E. A. James of the Chicago Uni
versity as guest of honor. Twenty ladies,
members of the Alumnae, were also hon

The programme was as follows: "The

A MOTHER'S SWORN STATEMENT
My little daughter May's head and face
broke out in one solid mass of bleeding sores,
and one of her ears was so affected, that the
doctor thought that it would slough off. Her
suffering was intense, Retting no rest at all,
unless under the iufluenoe of opiates. The
physician tried every known remedy, but in-
stead of getting better, they seemed to get
Trorse all the time. Distracted with her con-
dition, I was advised to try Ccncnu Reme-
dies. I administered Cutiocra Resolvent
inwardly, 1 bathed her with CmcrÃA. Soap.
and used Ccticitra (ointment)freely. Before
the first Keek I noticed that the little tufferer
was beginning to get rrlief. In lt*Â» than ttco

dcrabt. In spite of the big talk that 1b
being: Indulged In regarding- the alleged
enmity that marks the political inter
course between Budd and Phelan. The
wise ones who profess to be able to see
behind and beyond the veil of diplo
macy with which the gTeat men seek
to hide the real intent of their acts as
sert that the Governor is "doing" San
Francisco politics with so masterly a
hand that he has already grot the game
in his awn hands before his less bril
liant party associates have even
divined his intent.
The conditions as stated are these:
Mayor Phelan seeks political prefer
ment for the honor that such prefer
ment will bring him, a sentiment not
the less laudable because he happens
to be in a position to ignore the ma
terial benefits that would follow. In
pursuit of his quest for further honors
Phelan set his eye on the Governor's
chair â and found, somewhat to his sur
prise, that he was encroaching on the
political preserves of the incumbent.
As Phelan was insistent and Budd
firm, there remained but two solutions
of the difficulties of the situationâ there
must be either open warfare or a re
sort to diplomacy.
The subjects of the two opposing
leaders declared for war, and have
since been industriously arming them
selves for the expected conflict, the
marshaling of the Sullivan forces on
the pert of Phelan and the Harney
forces on the part of Budd being the |
visible evidences of their activity. In
the meantime the leaders were not idle.
The Governor conceded that the Mayor
had a perfect right to seek for honor
and power. He was even willing to as
sist the Mayor in his quest, providing !
it was made outside the State pre
serves. If the people of San Francisco
could be induced to accept the proposed
charter, what greater power could mor
tal man desire than to be elected
Mayor under its provisions? The |
honor attached to the position might I
be somewhat doubtful, but what was
lacking in this respect could be sup- j
plied by the Governor in another way.
He could appoint Phelan a Regent of
the State University, one of the most
honorable positions in the gift of the
Chief Executive. Having thus sup
plied the honor, the Governor could
then use his immense political power â
a power that is his through the benefi
ciaries of his patronage in this city
and in the State at large â to secure
the adoption of the charter, and thus
put the longed-for power within the
reach of Phelan's ambition. In return
for all this Phelan would withdraw
his objectionable presence from the
field of State politics.
And this is precisely what it is
claimed has been done.
Phelan was appointed a member of
I the Board of Regents, contrary to the
expectations of every one who was
. aware of the supposed enmity existing
J between the Governor and the Mayor;
the Harney factionâ which is the Budd
faction â of the local Democracy has
; been instructed to offer no organized
; opposition to the adoption of the new
charter: Phelan has withdrawn his
lieutenants who were booming his can
didacy for the gubernatorial nomina
tion in the interior of the State; the of
ficials who are eating the cake of
Budd's patronage in this city are lend
ing their moral support to the com
bined effortt of Phelan and his follow
ers to secure the adoption of the new
I charter. In the face of these facts it
I would seem that the apprehensions of
those who profess to be able to see the
trend of events is not unfounded.
Governor Budd's power in this city
can be estimated at a glance. He has
control of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee. His is the hand that
guides and directs the policy of the so
i called Harney Democrats. He has at
his command the power and influence
that gt>es with the patronage of the
water front, the Board of Health, the
Board of Park Commissioners, the Reg
; istrar, a part of the Board of Fire Com
missioners, a part of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners, a part of the Board
of Railroad Commissioners, the Insur
ance Commissioner, and the attorneys,
secretaries and others who hold their
present positions at the pleasure and
by the grace of the Governor. A very
formidable array, to be sure, and one
I that will be a very material aid to the
] man who has resigned his claim? to th-^
I Governor's chair in order to be the Czar
of San Francisco under the new char
ter.
Should the proposed charter be adopt
ed and Phelan achieve his present am
bition to be Mayor under its provisions
j he would then be in the possession of a
power greater by far than the wise pro
visions of a republican form of gov
ernment have heretofore seen fit to
give to any one individual. He would
have the appointment of the Board of
j Education, the Civil Service Commis
| sion. the Board of Health, the Board of
i Election Commissioners, the Board of
j Park Commissioners, the Board of Fire
Commissioners, the Board of Police
; Commissioners, the Board of Public
i "Works, besides a secretary, usher and
I stenographer. These appointments
i would be his direct patmnape. HI? in
: direct patronage would include all of
; the appointments that would be made
i by the various boards and commissions
| named, which include the greater part
â  of the salary roll of the city and coun
i ty. His indirect patronage would be
his as absolutely as the direct patron
age, for the reason that he is given the
power to remove from office any one
whom he appoints without giving any
better reason than that of "incompat
ibility of views." If. for instance, the
Board of Health refused to appoint any
one or all of the 200 or more employes
i who are in that branch of the govern
t ment and who might be nominated by
the Mayor, then he could remove the
members of the Board of Health and
appoint a new board which would obey
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 19, 1898.
his commands. And this, too, without
assigning a reason for his act further
than that their views were not com
patible with his.
Besides all this the Mayor will have
a salary of $6000 a year, besides a fund
of $3600 a year, for the expenditure of
which he is not required to give an ac
counting. His other powers under the
new charter are so numerous that to
enumerate them all would require the
use of several columns of this paper.
There certainly seems to be "some
thing doing" In local politics, and that
"something" is what is worrying the
wise ones among the politicians who
make It the business of their lives to be
In at the death.
FOULKS MADE A
SCHOOL PRINCIPAL
BUT THERE MAY BE TROUBLE
OVER THE PLACE.
Three New Lumber Inspectors Ap
pointed at Salaries Which Are
at Present Indefinite.
A principal for the Business Evening
School was elected at the meeting of the
Board of Education yesterday, but It Is
not at all certain that he will be allowed
to take the place.
By resolution signed by Carew, Bantel.
Derham, Head, Barrington, Armer and
Waller, George H. Foulks, the present
vice-principal of the school, was made its
principal by the votes of those who signed
the resolution, and with ttt&t of Galla
gher. It is Gallagher's vote which may
cause trouble, however, for he voted no
on the first call, and then before the re
sult was announced he changed his vote
and gave notice of a reconsideration at
the next meeeting. So there may be more
legislation before Mr. Foulks gets the
place.
S. H. Kent. Daniel Powers and T. M.
McLachlan were appointed by the presi
dent as experts in lumber furnished the
School Department. This was done in
pursuance of a resolution passed at the
meeting of April 30. Mr. Head asked
what salary the experts would get, and
Mr. Barrington said it would probably
cost $10 a day each. Mr. Head objected,
because the department was not in a con- j
dition to pay any such sum. but he was
interrupted by a point of order by Waller. j
who declared the appointments were \
made In pursuance of a resolution passed !
in due form and they were not debatable
Barrington ruled the point well taken,
but the matter will come up again.
The question of a text book fnr draw
ing came up again, and a resolution ac
cepting the bid of D. C. Heath and the
Thompson system as the one for the
schools, conditional upon the court rul
ing that the board had power to make
such a change, was voted down, but it
may come up again at the meetlner Fri
day night, to which time the board ad
journed.
The resignation of Mr. Carew as an ad
ditional member of the Finance Commit
tee was accepted after some personal re- i
marks. It was ordered that the drill i
corps of the different schools should turn
out on Memorial day.

FERRY DEPOT WORK.
The Plumbing Inspector Reports on
a Few Discrepancies.
The Poard of Health has at last taken
cognizance of the fart that the ferry de
i pot has not been built up to a strict or
; even a liberal interpretation of the plumb
ing rules. A report was submitted to the
Health Office yesterday by Plumbing In
spector Sullivan, which shows that eleven
of the rules of the board have been vio
lated, though to what extent does not fig
ure in the report.
I The contractors have not lived up to
the requirements in pipe connections, in
rain-water leaders, in washbasins, in

; ventilation, nor in the fouilamg- of waste

The report was ma-dc to Dr. O'Brien
( but he has left the office, and Dr. Oallwey
has not yet taken hold, so it is somewhat
of a problem to determine what will he

on by the new Health Officer after he has

The Ballots Were Marked.
The Supreme Court ha? reversed the
judgment of the lower court of Modoc
County in the election contest ca?f> <>f
Estpp and I>aurer. At the election of 18%
W. F. Estes received a certificate of elec
tion to the position of Supervisor at the
hands of the Election Board. E. Laurer
contested the matter and after much tes
timony the lower court set aside the issu
ance of the certificate, holding that the
contestant had the majority of the votes
cast. The Supreme Court Justices re
versed the judgment on the gTound that
some of the ballots cast for Laurer had
"identifying marks" thereon, and conse
quently were illegal. Aside from these
Estes had sufficient ballots to secure his
election.
A Technicality Misfires.
In passing upon the appealed case of
Frank Prather yesterday the Supreme
Court took occasion to again uphold the
provisions of section 956 of the Penal Code.
Prather was convicted of stealing cattle
after a fair trial in the Superior Court of
Yolo County. According to the indict
ment, the defendant stole the cattle from
the "estate of James G. Fair, deceased."
Demurrer was made to the indictment on
the ground that the Information was too
vague and should have stated the heirs
or legatees- In upholding the Judgment of
the lower court the Supreme Court dwells
with some force on the section mentioned,
which provides that where there is suffi
cient certainty in the information to
identify the act an erroneous allegation
as to the person Injured Is not material.

GALLWEY NOW
HEALTH OFFICER
Takes O'Brien's Place,
but Not His Salary.
HELPING HAND TO A FRIEND.
DR. PILLSBTJRY FINDS POISON
IN SHRIMPS.
Ie Butchertown Variety, He Says,
Will Kill Rabbits, and He Sug
gests That Their Sale Be
Stopped.
Dr. John Gallwey was appointed Health
Officer yesterday to nil the vacancy made
by the enlistment of Dr. A. P. O'Brien as
one of the surgeons of the First California
Volunteers. The appointment was made
In pursuance of an offer of service on the
part of Dr. Gallwey, and the conditions
imposed are an object lesson in the militia
circles of this State.
Both Dr. Gallwey and Dr. O'Brien are
members of the Sanitary Corps of the N.
G. C, Dr. Gallwey on the division staff
and Dr. O'Brien on the Surgeon Corps of
the First Regiment. When the First was
mustered into the service as a volunteer
regiment Dr. O'Brien took his place with
the others, giving up his position as
Health Officer and also the large practice
which he held. Dr. Gallwey has not been
ordered out, so to make the sacrifice of his
brother surgeon as light as possible, he
has volunteered to take O'Brien's place
as long as he is away, but the salary at
tached to it will go to O'Brien's family as
if O'Brien himself were holding the posi
tion. He also stipulates that if he is
called out there will be other members of
the Sanitary Corps who will follow his
example and take the place of the same
terms.
Dr. Gallwey's offer of services was made
in the following letter:
May 18, 1898.
To the Honorable Board of Health of the
City and County of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen:
Owing to the necessity for moving troops to
Manila at once, the sanitary corps of the Na
tional Guard of California is called upon to
detail certain of. its officer* to serve with this
force. As Dr. A. P. O'Brien is one of the
medical officers assigned to duty with the First
Regiment, and in common with every officer
of the corps, volunteered hi? services. It will
be nÂ«--essary for him to depart with the first
detachment.
It Is therefore incumr^r.t upon him to resign
his position as health officer, and as this step
will result In a material hardship on those
depending on him, I hereby take the liberty
of tendering my services to your honorable
body as health officer during Dr. O'Brien's
absence, upon the express condition, however,
that the salary of the position shall be paid
to his family.
The sanitary corps Will highly appreciate the
co-operation of your honorable board, an i in
the event that I shall be called upon while this
proposed arrangement is in force, the corps
will be able to supply an nher substitute for
Dr. O'Brien upon the condition* herein named.
Trusting that this matter will receive favor
able consideration at yi or hands. I remain
your obedient servant. JOHN GALLWEY.
Colonel and Chief Surgeon of Division Sanitary
Corps, N. G. C.
The offer was gladly accepted by the
Board and by Dr. O'Brien. A leave of
absence for six months was granted to
Dr. O'Brien, but this will be extended
should the service of the regiment keep
him in the field longer than that time. In
the meanwhile his place will be ably filled
and in such away that he will lose noth
ing by his willingness to serve with his
command.
In the case of William H. Tobln, laun
dry inspector, who is also an officer of
volunteers, a leave of absence for three,
weeks was granted in order to allow htm
,to draw full salary for the month of May.
Hi? successor was not appointed.

by merely injecting under their skins a
few of the microbes he obtained from
the Butchertown shrimp. The San Pablo

be sold. The matter was referred to Dr.

On suggestion of Dr. John Gallwey a
valuable dislnfector was loaned to the
volunteers by th<Â» Health Officer, the sol
diers not being able to procure one before
they are ordered away. Dr. O'Brien asked
the sanction of the board for what he had
done, and it was given him.
The suspension of Richard If. Jones,
disinterment inspector, was reported, and
as his successor J. "W. Cameron was ap
pointed. John Washington was madp

CTJRSED FLAG AND COUNTRY.
James B. Gill Chrstises Two Insult-
ing Foreigners.
Foreigners who do not like Old Glory
and the country- which It represents would
better keep their treasonable statements
under subjection â when abroad. A rase
â¢where two foreigners were brought to a
sense of American manliness "was Illus
trated a- few evenings since in a Kearny
street saloon.
There were present standing at the bar
James B. Gill, superintendent of the
Burglar Alarm Company, and another
gentleman when two individuals entered
the place and after calling for liquid re
freshments proceeded to direct their con
versation to all within their hearing. They
were profuse in choice epithets in con
demning the American flag and consign
ing every Yankee in the land to that hot
region where very wicked sinners are said
to go.
Mr. Gill stood the thing as long as he
could, and on seeing that the insulting
foreigners directed their remarks pur
posely for his hearing he turned to them
and remonstrated with them against us
ing such language. Saying that no man
living in this country and protected by its
laws should speak "so disrespectfully of
the flag and the people, he demanded a
retraction, which did not come. Without
losing much time over the matter his good
right arm was propelled against the jaw
of one of the men and his left followed
suit against the other's ear. The result
was that two foreigners lay sprawling on
the mosaic pavement. As soon as they
fot on their feet they slid out of the
oorway like two whipped curs.
Superintendent Gill, who is a most
powerfully built man. said that in future
no man can swear at Old Glory or curse
the American people while he is about
without having a fight on his hands.
Executor's Petitions.
Emma "Wohklmann. the widow of Claus
Wohidmann, filed a petition in the Prn
bate Court yesterday asking for letters
of administration on the estate of her
deceased husband. The value of the
estate is set out to be about $3030.
A similar application was filed by Mme.
Victoire Chaigneau, as executrix for the
estate of her grandson. Frederick Ken
nedy, the amount of which is estimated
to be about $20,000.
Their I>omestic Troubles Ended.
George Rose and his divorced wife
Elizabeth settled their financial troubles
yesterday. Rose granted $12,000 and the
entire furniture of their late but unhappy
home at 725^ Turk street to Mrs. Rjse.
The conditions upon which the settle
ment was made were made a part of the
proceeding, and filed with the papers in
the County Clerk's office.
ROMANCE OF
A BANKBOOK
Mystery of the Life of
Mary E. Collier.
OUTCOME OF A PERSONAL
UNCLAIMED MONEY LIES IN A
VAULT FOR YEARS.
An Army Surgeon Leaves a Snug
Legacy, Which Is Now Being
Claimed by Strangers.
The following personal in the San
Francisco papers a few days ago refers
to the case of a woman whose bank
account has for a long time been a
puzzle to those interested in the af
fairs of the Savings and Loan Bank of
this city:
MART E. COLLIER, who lived In San Fran
cisco in 1564-66, or her next kin, will re
ceive valuable information on communicating
with OSCAH T. SHUCK, attorney for absent
heirs, 609 Kearny st.. San Francisco.
Peculiar Interest attaches to this
case because the money in question
was deposited in her name by Dr. Ben
jamin Tappan, who was a surgeon in
j the United States army, and who was
i killed in an engagement with the
Apache Indians in 1866.
In 1864 the doctor's office was at 622
I Clay street. One day in that year he
stepped into the Savings and Loan
Bank, directly across the street, and
' made a deposit, signing "Mary E. Col
lier, by B. Tappan Jr." No syllable of
information has since been discovered
I concerning the Mary E. Collier in
question.
It has been learned that Dr. Tappan
was born in Steubenville, Ohio. Inves
tigations there led to the belief that
the Mrs. Collier in question had been
discovered in the wife of Dr. J. C.
Denise of Omaha, as Mrs. Denise was
once Mary C. Collier, and a schoolmate j
of Dr. Tappan. The signature of Mrs. j
Denise as Mary Collier was presented !
at the bank, whereupon the signature !
of Mary E. Collier was produced, and
there was not the slightest resem
blance. The real owner of the money,
it appeared, had signed her name to j
an order on the bank as far back as '
1864, directing the bank to honor any !
orders signed by Dr. Tappan as her
agent.
The brothers of Dr. Tappan, one of
whom is Rev. David S. Tappan of
Portsmouth, Ohio, now claim the
money, and assert that no Mary E.
Collier will ever be found. If the
money was originally for Mary E. Col- '
Her, and if the doctor subsequently
changed his mind and needed the
money personally, there is a theory
that he induced some woman to sign
the order which was produced at the
bank. It has not been disclosed how j
much of the money originally depos
ited was drawn by Dr. Tappan under
the terms of the order. A snug sum,
at all events, is now awaiting the true
owner.
A MOTHERS PLEA
FOR HER BOY.
SHE WANTED TO TAKE HIM OUT
OF THE ARMY.
Released on Habeas Corpus. He Was
Arrested by the Military Authori-
ties for Fraudulent Enlistment.
"Give me my boy! The Judge gave him
to me: " cried Mrs. Hilda C. Boyson yes
terday afternoon, as she clung desper
ately to the arm of a strapping young
feilow, dressed in the United States in
fantry uniform.
"Y"U can't have him, madam." replied
Captain Rheinhold Richter of Company
I. First Infantry. California Volunteers,
taking the soldier by the other arm. "He
is under arrest by military authority, and
he must go with us."
Mrs. Boyson is the mother of E. M.
Boyson, a private in the company and
regiment just named. Young Boyson is
srs old, and volunteered with the
rest of his comrades to fight for his
country against the Spaniards.
His mother had him produced In the
United States District Court before Judge
de Haven by virtue of a writ of habeas
corpus setting forth that he was under
age and Illegally restrained by Captain
Kicht*r. lieutenant J. J. Wesi repre
sented the captain in the law proceed
ings. The evidence showed that the
young man was only 20 years of age Thf
mother testified that he was her'onlv
support, her husband being sick and un
able to care for her.
The case was all the more distressing
because the young fellow had set his
heart on going to the war, and dreads the
ridicule that will be showered upon him
should he be released from service. Judge
de Haven found that the hoy had not
bf-en legally enlisted and ordered that he
be delivered into the keeping of his
mother: but a* soon as he got out of the
courtroom he was placed under military
arrest by the captain and the lieutenant
on a charge of having enlisted by false
and fraudulent representations as" to his
age.
He will be court-martialed and prob
ably be taken to Manila, in spite of his
mother's pleas.
