HEARST VALUED HIS SILENCE
AT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
A Futile Effort to Time-
Lock His Malignant
Tongue.
A Great Corporation's Pleading at
the Feet of a Deliberate
Blackmailer.
The Call has reproduced and com
mented on the secret contract between
the Examiner and the Southern Pa
cific Company, in which Hearst through
his representative agreed not to be
malicious, malignant nor to misrepre
sent the interests of that corporation
for a certain time. Mr. Hearst, con
fronted with the indisputable evidence
of his turpitude, shrieks "forgery" and
makes a personal attack on Mr. W. H.
Mills. In justice to the latter gentle
man The Call acquits him of any con
nection with the exposure of this black
mailing scheme of the Examiner. No
one connected with The Call consulted
Mr. Mills about the matter, nor did he
In any way contribute to the astonish
ing exposure which has stung Mr.
Hearst into a red-mouthed challenge
to Mr. Mills to sue him for libel and to
do a lot of other things which Mr. Mills
fcfÂ»B no .'ntereat In doing, as he has had
no connection with anything that has
appeared in The Call.
As well might the Examiner make
mouths at the King of the Belgians and
challenge him to sue it, in a matter
â¢with which he has had no connection
nor relation. The facts we have pub
lished are these, and before we finish
â we will point out to Mr. Hearst a very
easy and simple way in which he can
disprove them, without waiting for a
suit by Mr. Mills or anybody else for an
opportunity to prove that he is not a
blackmailing scoundrel.
In June, 1892, a secret agreement was
made and entered into by and between
the Examiner and the Southern Pa
cific Company. This agreement, which
waÃ the basis of the open contract for
advertising, contains these stipulations:
The company (is to enjoy immunity
from hostility in the columns of the Ex
aminer and) is not to be the victim of
malirious attack of criticism or of mis-
representation; that the Examiner will
rot seek to create hostile sentiment in
#the minds of this community against the
Southern Pacific Company, or any of the
Interests it represents, and that while not
stipulating as against all criticism, it
agrees that criticism shall not proceed
from any motive of malice or maligni'y,
and that such criticism as may be found
necessary to keep and maintain the con-
fidence of the public, to the extent that
any public sentiment may have been
created from other sources is to be avoid
ed as much as possible,
June 15, 1892, the representative of the
Examiner agreed to all of the above
except the part inclosed in brackets.
To learn whether that part was not in
cluded in the agreement, the directors
were asked by Mr. Mills if it accorded
with their understanding, Mr. Mills
Baying in writing that it was his un-

COLONEL CROCKER: The
above is my understand
ing. How does it conform
to your understanding?
W. H. MILLS.
The San Francisco Call
derstandlng and Crocker and Towne In
writing declared that It was theirs.
After the company by those repre
sentatives had refused to recede and
excise the part in brackets, on June 29,
1592, the open contract was made, by
which the Southern Pacific Company
agreed to pay the Examiner $30,000 in
thirty monthly installments for adver
tising: in its Columbian Fair edition,
and that open contract contained this
1 clause:
"And all In accordance with an agree
ment entered into between the Ex
aminer management and C. F. Crocker,
A. N. Towne and William H. Mills, on
behalf of the Southern Pacific Com
pany."
That clause obviously did not mean
the contract in which It appeared, for
A. N. Towne was not a party thereto,
but a prior and perfected agreement to
which Towne was a party and which
was precedent to the contract and a
condition upon which the contract was
made.
The Examiner's Columbian Fair edi
tion was not issued until June 4, 1893,
but the payments on the blackmail
agreement began September 1, 1892,
nine months before the advertising ap
peared, and $8000 had been paid by
April 25, 1893, and on June 8, $2000 more
was paid, making practically a pay
ment of $10,000 before the advertising
had circulation.
On July 24, 1893, W. R. Hearst
hypothecated this open contract to the
First National Bank of San Francisco,
affixing his own signature to the as
signment, but first obtaining the in
dorsement of Colonel C. F. Crocker on
the back of the contract that the same
was valid and would be "paid when
due, according to the terms thereof."
Now, when Hearst assigned this con
tract to the bank putting his assign
ment and signature on its back along
side of Crocker's certificate to it, what
were the legal facts? Crocker certified
that the contract was valid and would
be paid when due "according to the
terms thereof." If there was no agree
ment behind the contract Hearst had
performed his part, for the Examiner
had completed >nd delivered the adver
tising called for, and had thereby com
pleted his undertaking openly written
in the contract. But Crocker's indorse
ment implied legally that Hearst'sVun
dertaking was not completed; that "ac
cording to the terms thereof" he had
something to do besides the advertis
ing which had been completed and de
livered. He may have been watching
crocodiles on the Nile, or listening to
the bulbul in Cashmere when his agents
were selling him to bondage to the
Southern Pacific but when he person-
This agrees with my
understanding quite fully.
Certainly nothing less
would b,e satisfactory.

ally hypothecated that contract with
the clause which made the secret agree
ment a part of It. and with Crocker's
indorsement of its validity if perform
ed "according to the terms thereof"
Hearst could not be ignorant of the
conditions of his sale to the corpora
tion, nor of the time lock it had upon
his lying and blackguardism for the
space of thirty months. â¢
At the date of this hypothecation
there was due on the contract $19,000,
and the Southern Pacific Company con
tinued payment to the Bank until June
11, 1894. The next payment due July
11, 1894, was defaulted by the company
on the ground that the "terms thereof"
had been violated by the Examiner.
The default went into controversy be
tween Hearst and the rajlfoad. On
September 24 Colonel Crocker wrote
Hearst:
"Some time in August' last W. F.

This Is the Contract Entered Into Between W. R. Hearst and the Southern

C. M. Palmer Esq., Business Manager of the Examiner, San Francisco, Cal. â
Dear Sir: We hereby agree to engage space in the Grand Special World's Fair edition of
the San Francisco Examiner, matter to be furnished by us, including cuts, of twenty pages
or one hundred and forty columns, for which the Southern Pacific Company agrees to pay
thirty thousand dollars, ($30,000), gold coin of the United States, payable at the rate of one
thousand dollars ($1000) per month, the first monthly installment to become due and pay
able August 31, 1892, and running thence at the rate of one thousand dollars ($1000)
per month, or in larger installments, at the option of the Southern Pacific Company; and
all in accordance with an agreement entered into between the Examiner
management and C. F. Crocker, A. N. Towneand William H. Mills, on behalf
of the Southern Pacific Company; it being understood that the < said edition shall
have a minimum issue of five hundred thousand copies, and the same shall be published
simultaneously in San Francisco and Chicago, on or about the date of the official opening
of the Columbian Exposition.
And it is further agreed that the said matter shall be subject of enlargement, alter

February 1, 1893. Yours truly,
W. H. MILLS, for the Southern Pacific Company. .

Examiner had fairly treated the rail
road company, and that if you thought
it had not done so you would not ex
pect the company to make any further
payments on the above-mentioned con
tract. â¢ â¢ â¢ It was certainly a part
of the contract between the Examiner
and the railroad company that the Ex
aminer should and would accord fair
treatment to the railroad. In view of
this contract I do not assume for a
moment that you would insist upon the
railroad's paying the Examiner the full
sum of $30,000 if the Examiner had not,
on its part, fully performed the stipu
lations made on its behalf."
Why did Hearst say to Herrin that,
if he thought the Examiner had not
treated the railroad fairly he would
not expect further payment on a con
tract which in its own text said noth
ing about fair treatment a 8 one of its
conditions, if there were no other and

there is a consecutive statement of the
steps In this extortion of blackmail
from its inception, in the spring of 1892,
to Hearst's violation of his blackmail
treaty in 1894, and his admission to
Herrin that if he had not stayed bought
he would not expect the payment of the
balance of his price. We reproduce a
copy of that secret agreement, the orig

This blackmailing blackguard Hearst
is entitled to full and free publication
of the exact form in which he sold and
conveyed himself to the Southern Pa

the real issue. The public will not be
affected unfavorably toward Mr. Mills
by that attack, for every decent man

to purchase "immunity" from Hearst's

by Jbuks Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Oct. 23.â Interest in the
Fushoda incident is increasing.
Indeed, a certain tone of anxiety
is noticeable in pnbii i opinion.
Thtre was a rumor last even
ing that England Intended to send an
ultimatum to-night. The press repeats
it and says it is current in official cir
cles in London. This is probably noth
ing more than an alarmist view of
orders Riven by the admiralty in va
rious directions, notably that warships
at Portsmouth shall bring up their
crews to the full strength. Hava's
Agency announce- that official notes
have been given out to the English pa
pers denying that any warlike prepara
tion is intended in these orders.
As a matter of fact, everything is be
ing done here to settle the question
peacefully. Most of the papers discuss
the compromise as an acceptable ar
rangement. All of them refuse even to
consider the recall of Marchand pure
and simple.
The Liberte, in discussing the speech
of M. Chaplin, says the president of
the local government board is like all
his colleagues. Lord Salisbury himself,
while expressing pacific sentiments and
friendship for France, demands the
evacuation of Fashoda by Marchand as
preliminary to negotiations.
"That," says Liberte, "it must be said
and repeated, the English Government
will never obtain. We don't insist," it
adds, "upon the occupation of Fashoda,
but we do absolutely upon having ac
cess 'i the 1 -le. If an agreement is
possible on this ba*Â»is we ask nothing
better than to subscribe to it. But it
ought to be clearly understood that till
such an arrangement has been concluded
and so long as the region allotted to us
has not been placed undjer our absolute
sovereignty or exactly defined the
i<'rench flag will remain at 1 ashoda
with Marchand guarding it. We pro
voke nobody, but we insist upon our
rights being respected."
What the Liberte says is representa
tive of the French press. War is not
sought, but will not be avoided at the
price of dishonor.
FRANCE'S CLAIMS TO
FASHODA ARE SET FORTH
PARIS, Oct. 23. â A semi-official note
issued this evening says: "There is no
foundation for the alarmist rumors re
garding the relations between France
and Great Britain. It is very incorrect
to say that extraordinary measures
have been taking place at any of our
r.aval ports."
The Fashoda yellow book is volumin
ous, but it does not include Major Mar
chand's report, which will be published
later. The dispatches were largely an
ticipated by the English Fashoda blue
book.
The diplomatic conversations re
ceived show a curious endeavor on the
French side to represent that Mar
chand's mission was quite as important
as General Kitchener's, on the ground
that the struggle was against the Kha
lifa and barbarism.
On September 18 M. del Casse, the
Foreign Minister, informed the British
Embassador to France, Sir Edmund
Monson, in explicit language, that
France did not regard Lord Salisbury's
claim to the Soudan by virtue of con
quest as aplying to Fashoda, on the
ground that the Marchand expedition
went to the relief of the French expe
dition under Captain Licolard, which
dated from a period long before the de
claration in the House of Commons by
Sir Edward Gray, Under Secretary of
State ft r Foreign Affairs in Lord Rose
bery's Cabinet, as to the policy of the
British Government toward the Soudan
and at a time when the equatorial prov
inces were lost to civilization. In fact,
M. del Casse argued unless Great Brit
ain possessed the Sultan's mandate as
wfcU as the Khedive's to acquire all
former Egyptian provinces France con
sidered herself equally entitled with
England to possession of any point oc
cupied by French officers.
Judging 1 from the yellow book dis
patches the foregoing represents the
French standpoint, and M. del Casse
contends that as Marchand reaphed Fa-
Bhoda first England had no right to de
mand an evacuation of Fashoda prior
to negotiations.
On September 20 M. del Casse de
clared to Sir Edmund Monsun that such
a demand would be equivalent to an
ultimatum and wonld afford a sacri
fice of France's material interests. So
long as her honor was intact, for the
sake of the Anglo-French entente no
one could doubt what would be the re
ply of France to such a demand.
The subsequent dispatches appearing
in the yellow book relate to conversa
tions between Baron de Courcel, French
Embassador in London, and Lord Salis
bury, the latter contending that the
capture of Khartoum entitled Egypt to
possession of all the Mahdi's dominions,
and the French Embassador arguing
that Major Marchand had captured
Fashoda before General Kitchener took
Khartoum and that France had for a
long time held several posts on the
Bahr-el-Gazel.
Lord Salisbury retorted that the
French forces in the regions referred to
were too weak to constitute effective
occupation.
A final dispatch dated October 12
from Baron de Courcel to M. del Casse
records a conversation with Lord Sal
isbury in which the French Embassa
dor claimed access to the Nile through
the Bahr-el-Gazel and asked for an
amicable delimitation of the respective
spheres of interest of the two powers,
in replying to which Lord Salisbury in
dicated that it would be necessary for
him to consult his colleagues.
ENGLAND CALLS HOME
ALL RESERVE OFFICERS
CHICAGO, Oct. 23.â Major James R
Graham, an officer in the Yeoman Cav
alry Regiment in England, a branch of
the service which corresponds to the
militia in the American military es
tablishment, who has been visiting
friends in this city, to-day .received an
order from an officer in command of
the division of which his regiment
forms a part, to return to England at
once to prepare for military duty.
"Since receiving the cable," said Ma
jor Graham, "I have communicated
with a number of British officers whom
I knew to be on leave and visiting in
this country, and found ail had received
a similar order. But one interpretation
of the order can be made to my mind.
] believe my country is on the verge of
war with France over the Fashoda in
cident and that the entire military es
tablishment including the reserves, of
which my regiment forms a part, is
to be put upon a war footing. That offi
cers in the regular service should be
called home is not surprising and would
scarcely cause comment, but when offi
cers and men of the reserves are per
emptorily called it is safe to say the
situation is regarded seriously by those
high in authority. I shall leave at
once."
SITUATION HAS AN .
OMINOUS OUTLOOK
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The French yel
low book on Fashoda seems to Indicate
an intention of the French Government
to utilize the Marchand affair as a
means of raising the whole Egyptian
question. This impression is confirmed
by the comments of most of the Paris
papers this morning.
The London press admits the gravity
of the situation revealed by the yellow
book, but the papers are unanimous in
declaring that it is impossible for Lord
Salisbury to consent to any negotiation
until Fashoda is evacuated. As, how
ever, the French Minister, M. del Casse,
with equal firmness, declines to with
draw Marchand without previous nego
tiations, the situation has an ominous
outlook.
The Times in its editorial said Lord
Salisbury has replied to Baron de Cour
cel's pretensions with the decision
which might have been hoped for.
Baron de Courcel, after a long confer
with M. del Casse, left Paris for
London yesterday.
According to the Temps, he had an
important conversation with Lord Sal
isbury before he left London, and will
have another on returning there.
Another dispatch from Paris says it
is rumored that he is bringing to Lon
don definite proposals for the evacua
tion of Fashoda on condition that
France be granted a Nile outlet on the
River Bahr-el-Gazal, one of the tribu
taries of the Nile, entering it about 150
miles southwest of Fashoda at Mok
rem-el-Bohur.
M. Lockroy, the Minister of Marine,
expects that the movement of the
troops to Cherbourg is merely one of
relief forces for Crete a..d the colonies.
ACTIVITY OF THE
FRENCH ARSENALS
CHERBOURG, France, Oct. 23.âOr
ders have been received at the military
and naval arsenals here to prepare for
the arrival of a large body of troops to
morrow. The barracks are being hur
riedly put in order for their reception.
SHIPWRECKED SEAMEN
' CANNOT BE RESCUED
Clinging to the Bigging of a Strand
ed Bark, but Lifeboats Are Un
able to Beach Them.
HALIFAX, N. S.. Oct. 23.â Tugs which
have been endeavoring for hours to
reach a large square rigged vessel ashore
on Thrumpcap Shoals, about a mile and
a half from here, have abandoned the
effort to save the crew of the unknown
craft. The vessel was discovered on the
rocks at daylight this morning, having
gone ashore in the heavy gale last night.
Only the masts are visible from shore and
five have been counted on the masts of
the stranded steamer. At first the vessel
was thought to be a fishing bark.
During the morning the crew could be
seen making signals, but the blinding
spray of the sea breaking over the hull,
prevented them being understood. Life
boats from the Devils station were early
on the scene, but could not get within a
half mile of the shoals. The noise oÂ£ the
surf was terrific. This afternoon tugs got
near enough for Mr. Crosby, the Halifax
agent of tno barkentine Irma, which was
due from Turku Islands with salt, to ven
ture the opinion that the vessel was the
Irma, It was conjectured that the vessel
might be the barkentine Ida Maud, but
the dismasted hull appeared too large.
A life buoy attached to a email Hne was
sent off from the stranded vessel this
evening and was allowed to float down to
one- of the life boats. An attempt was
then made to pass a heavy line, but the
small railing broke and darkness coming:
on, another attempt could not be made.
As only five men were seen on the vessel
and the crew of the Irma numbered nine,
it is feared that four have been lost. The
sea is still high a.nd further efforts to
rescue the crew have had to be aban
doned.
It is feared the vessel cannot hold to
gether much longer and much anxiety
exists. The Irma is 2223 tons, owned in
Liverpool, N. 8., and Commanded by Cap
tain Taylor of this city.

HAVANA, via Key \Vest, Oct. 23.â
Pazy Libertad, one of the daily papers
of Cienfuegos, published with sanction
of the Government, prints a manifesto
with over 300 signatures, a great many
of which are those of Spaniards, openly
proclaiming Cuban independence.
Owing to the fact that Spanish of
ficers are selling commissary stores at
any price obtainable, army, supplies are
now a drug in the market in the in
terior, making legitimate trade impossi
ble. It is asserted as the Spanish rule"
in Cuba draws to a close, corruption
and robbery daily become more open
and wholesale. The committee of trans
portation, charged with furnishing pas
sage tickets to Spanish officers return
ing to Spain, are charging an arbitrary
rate of $4 each for a berth. If the vic
tim refuses to give up he is made to
wait for several stearm â¢Â« the commis
sion claiming that there is no room.
This abuse is openly spoken of, but the
present situation is a free-for-all, grab
as-grab-can game and every one ap
pears, eager to make money while the
Spanish sun shines.
The official report of the burials in
the city of Havana since the first of the
present year shows that there have been
16,821 interments. The average death
rate keeps on steadily at 47 per day.
Great discontent prevails among the
Spanish troops because of non-pay
ments, in some cases for six months, i
in others for seven months and in still |
others for even eight months, and the j
soldiers fear that they will be embarked j
for Spain without receiving their pay. j
The poor quality of food supplied to |
nearly all the soldiers has occasioned
much ill-feeling and serious insub

ties. In the province of Puerto Prin
cipe, of the 400 members of the civil
guards 300 have deserted and gone over
to the insurgents. At -Nuevitas the
Tarragona Battalion became insub

MEMPHIS, Oct. 23.â A special to the
Commercial Appeal from Forest, Miss.,
says: As a result of an attempt to ar
rest a negro near Harpersville, Scott
County, in the eastern part of the
State, one white deputy was killed, three
wounded and according to the latest re
port nine negroes have been killed by
the citizens of the Harpersville neigh
borhood and. the Sheriff's posse com
bined. The pursuit of about fifty ne

to prevent his arrest and capture, and
which ambushed the party attempting
the arrest, continues and by morning
the number of fatalities will undoubt

The whole country is terribly aroused
and the Sheriff's posse has been rein
forced with men from all the neighbor
ing towns.
GoVernor McLaurin has gone to the
scene, which is about ten miles nor'.h
of Forest, the nearest railroad, point.
The trouble originated last Friday,
when a negro named Burke had an al
tercation with his employer, Charles
Freeman, a white man," in which the
negro got the better of the difficulty.
The next night a crowd of white men,
headed by Wallace Sibley, went to
Burkes house. When they arrived
upon the scene and called for Burke
they were greeted with a fusillade from
the negroes concealed in the bushes
surrounding the house and in the house
itself. Wallace Sibley, the leader, fell
dead at the first volley and three more
white members T3f the crowd, James
Johnson, James Hilton and Jamea
Wells, were -wounded. The whites re
turned the fire, but were unable to do
any execution, as their assailants were
all concealed. There were not more
than eight men in the white crowd, and
finding it impossible to resist effectively
they dispersed toward Harpersville. It
was not known at that time that Sibley
was injured, but upon a return to the
scene this morning he was found dead
in the yard. The wounded deputies
were able to get back to town.
This occurrence took place early in
the night. When the crowd returned to
Harperville the news spread like wild
fire. During 'the night a large crowd
gathered. They Immediately went to
Burkes house and got from his mother
the names of all the parties in the
crowd who had ambushed the whites
the night before. In all there were
about forty negroes who had gathered
to prevent the arrest of Burke, and a
list was made up at her dictation. All
of them had fled. Then the pursuit and
search for each of the proscribed dar
kies began. According to the state
ment of reliable citizens, six negroes
were found and killed by the crowd of
armed and determined citizens before
the Sheriff arrived.
This morning Sheriff Stevenson was
wired of the condition of affairs and he
was asked to get together a posse and
come to Harpersville. Gathering a
posse of twenty men he Btarted. He
was Joined by a crowd of citizens num
bering over 300 men. Immediately
soldiers by furnishing them with good
and plentiful rations. Many soldiers
until recently were deserting, but Gen
eral Blanco's decree regarding disband
ment has put a stop to the defections.
Over 5000 soldiers have been mustered
out- since the issuance of the decree.
The sanitary brigades of Havana,
Guanabacoa, Regla and Gunes. with
several other localities in Havana
province. have petitioned General
Blanco that they be disbanded so that
they may -remain in the island. Some
of the engineer brigades have also
asked for their discharge. The greater
part of them are composed of the best
drilled soldiers. Over 400 of the 700
members of the Orden Publico at Ha
j vana have also asked that they be mus
tered out in order that they might re
main in Cuba, 50 per cent of the civil
guards in the island have made a simi
lar request. None of the artillerymen,
however, have asked, to be allowed to
remain. The reason for this is said to
be that the artillery chiefs maintain an
honest administration, and that the
soldiers are well supplied with food and
clothing and are paid up to date.
About fifty Cuban patriotic clubs have
been organized in Havana under the
management in a large majority of
cases by physicians, lawyers and other
professional men. Many of the mem
bers of some of these clubs attended the
first meetings wearing the Cuban and
American flags crossed. The presiding
officers of several of the clubs, noticing
the insigna in the buttonholes of the
coats of members, ordered that in fu
ture only the Cuban flag should be
worn. In many instances this order was
complied with.
Cuban General Re"o has arrived at
Havana from Puerto Principe and is
preachin- in the Havana cafes and the
insurgent camps near the city a holy
war aprainst the Americans. He has in
terviewed many of the leaders of the
Cubans and has urged the carrying on
of the war against the Americans if
independence is not at once granted to
Cuba.
Cuban Colonel Torriet has also ar
rived at Havana from the east, and is
carrying on a strong campaign against
the Americans and Calixto Garcia,
whom he professes to look upon as a
after leaving the house where the first
tragedy was committed the negroes
scattered through the surrounding
country.
A reliable telephone message was re
ceived at a late hour to-night that three
more negroes were found and killed,
making a total of nine killed to-day,
with about forty more to be heard
from. Sheriff Stevenson, realizing the
danger apprehended, immediately wired
Governor McLaurin at Brandon for aid
in quelling a probable widespread dis
turbance. Upon receipt of his telegram
the Governor wired Adjutant General
Henry W. Jackson to get together a
company of the National Guard and
proceed to the scene upon the first
train. General Henry Immediately re
sponded that there was no National
Guard obtainable, but he would get to
gether a company of armed men and
render all necessary assistance.
In the meantime the Governor se
cured a special train at Brandon and,
accompanied by a posse of thirty men,
proceeded to Forest. Arriving here
early in the evening and finding that
there was little danger of the riot as
suming proportions beyond the abillty
of the pos3e on hand to keep in bounds,
he wired General Henry that it was un
necessary for him to bring his volun
teers from Jackson.
The posse is operating in the swamps
about a mile from Harpersville. where
most of the fugitives are supposed to
be concealed. There is a message here
to the effect that the citizens are ap
prehensive of armed negroes entering
the town to-night, and guards will be
set to prevent a surprise. The Gov
ernor and Mr. Henry are naturally
counseling moderation, but in the ex
cited state of the public mind a general
fear is expressed that the public will
not regard the suggestion favorably.
Their presence will have a good effect
in restraining the number of fatalities
after enough negroes have been killed
to satisfy the outraged feelings in that
section.
WHITF GUARD SHOT BY
NEGROES IN THE NIGHT
Sequel to the Riots at Ashpole, N. C.,
Pursuit and Capture of Four
Assassins.
WILMINGTON, N. C, Oct. 23.â A
special to the Star from Lumberton
says: At 3 o'clock this morning a squad
from the negroes who were dispersed
at Ashpole, Robeson County, crept up
to town and shot three whites stationed
there as guards. They were Albert
Floyd, Robert Inman and William Bul
lard. Bullard is seriously wounded and
the others are slightly hurt. A hundred
whites with bloodhounds are now In
pursuit, and it is said four of the ne
groes have been caught. The whites
are telegraphing the principal towns in
the State for Winchester rifles to be
sent there immediately.
The four negroes who shot the three
white guards were captured near Ash
pole. They were brought to bay by the
whites and are now confined in box
cars at Ashpole and heavily guarded.
It is feared that the negroes will at
tempt to assassinate the guards, which
will so exasperate the whites as to
cause more serious trouble. The guard
was composed of eight or ten men who
were standing around the fire In the
open air, thus becoming easy targets
for the negroes^ w;h.o fired under cover
of darkness and then fled.
The Ashpole incident has increased
the excitement at Wilmington, which
is near the riot line.
INDIGNATION CAUSED
BY AN EDITOR'S ARREST
MADRID, Oct. 23.â Lieutenant Gen
eral Correa, Minister of War, threatens
to resign unless the Government up- I
holds the action of General Chinchilla,
Captain General of Madrid,, who. last
week imprisoned Senor Flguerea, editor
of El Nacional, for publishing an ar
ticle not previously submitted to the
censor â the imprisonment being resent
ed in certain quarters as an infringe
ment of Figuerea's alleged immunity
from arrest as a member of the Cham
ber of D ( --'Utles.
Senor Gamazo on Friday last tender
ed his resignation as Minister of Public
Instruction and Public Works as a pro
test against the arrest of Senor Fl
guerea. Hlb resignation taken with the
traitor to the Cubans, having been
bribed by American gold. The colonel
in an interview with one of the leading
newspapers in Havana has made all
sorts of charges against Garcia and the
Americans, but the censor would not
allow an account of the interview to
be published, fearing that it might give
rise to disturbances.
A secret circular has been sent to the
presidents of all the Cuban patriotic
committees denouncing a large number
of Cubans who are looked upon as
traitors to the cause of Cuban inde
pendence and are charged with being
attached to the Americans. The cir
cular recommends a vigorous contest
against not only Spanish residents, but
against the Americans as well, "who
are endeavoring to steal the Cubans'
victory."
The Spanish Colonel Cervera, Mili
tary Governor of Mariano, pays daily
visits to the insurgent camps in his dis
trict, advising the Cubans not to sur
render their arms and to make resist
ance until the independence of the
island is declared. Colonel Cervera is
an intimate friend of General Parrado,
president of the Spanish Evacuation
Commission. '
During the last two weeks several
hundred Remington carbines and large
quantities of ammunition have beer
sent from Havana, it is presumed, by
some of the Spanish chiefs.
The Spanish residents, manufac
turers, merchants and planters are
somewhat alarmed and criticize in se
vere terms the behavior of some of the
Spanish chiefs, who, it is alleged, are
acting suspiciously in many places and
are working in favor of Cuban inde
pendence, advising the Cubans to per
sist in their revolutionary attitude. For
this reason many of the Spanish resi
dents here have written long letters to
friends in Madrid in order that the
home Government may be acquainted
with what is happening in the islands,
and have requested that on behalf of
Spain's interests and the part of the
Spanish residents the evacuation may
be completed as soon as possible, so as
to avoid prolonging the existing dan
gerous condition of affairs.
threat of X3eneral Correa, Indicates a
radical division of sentiment in the Sa
gasta Ministry on the subject.
The Madrid newspapers, according to
a cable dispatch Friday have addressed
a complaint to the Supreme Court of
Madrid against General Chinchilla's ac
tion. The Captain General on the ap
pearance of the uncensored article, or
dered the suppression of. El Nacional,
but the suspension order was event
ually annulled. .

SAGASTA CABINET
TO STAY IN POWER
Special cable to The Call and the New York-
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, Oct. 23.â 1n spite of what
you may hear to the contrary there is
every possibility that the Ministerial
crisis will be arranged amicably to
morrow. This will be due to the ap
peals made to those who wish to re
sign that in the present condition of
affairs it would be unpatriotic to leave,
and probably with the departure of
Senor Gamazo the matter will end.
Senor Sagasta is disposed at all haz
ards to hold his party in power, and
the chances of Silvela are further off
than ever. Should there be a change it
would be General Polavieja with a Min
istry composed of non-political men.
He had an audience of two hours yes
terday with the Queen Regent.

Jamaica, is going to Washington to ob

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CORNING, .lowa, Oct. 23.â The long
est lived and undoubtedly the most
nearly successful 'experiment ever made
in the Western Hemisphere with pure
communism, came to an end, when,
late yesterday afternoon, Judge H. M.
Towner in the District Court entered
an order discharging the receiver of the
New Icarian Community, and formally
declaring the business of the commu
nity wound up.
Etienne Cabet, scholar historian,
agitator, sociologist and philanthropist,
who two generations ago was stirring
France with his socialistic and commu
nistic writings; who contributed much
toward inciting the revolution of 1848,
of which he was afterward historian;
contemporary and co-worker of Proud
hon in behalf of the poor and oppressed
of France, and finally, exiled from his
own country, was the founder of the
community which, after an existence
of almost half a century, came to an
end yesterday.
Cabet, scientific communist, tried to
found his first colony in France, but
the Government of Louis Philippe was
opposed to such experiments, and its
opposition forces to the Icarians, as ad
herents of the new communistic doc
trines called themselves, to go to the
new world. The Icarians went first
to Texas, where they were offered an
area as large as a pood-sized French
department for experiment. The em
issaries, after looking over the pros
pect, decided against it, and went back
to New Orlenas. Here they were joined
by others, and at last, when the Mor
mons left Nauvoo, Illinois, the Icari
ans, who had bought the old Mormon
holdings, secured from the Illinois Leg
islature a charter granting special priv
ileges and Immunities. About 2000
French enthusiasts joined them, Cabet
at their head. He was practically dic
tator of the community: for years no
question was raised as to his authority,
and so long as he was in charge all
went well. The community grew and
prospered and there was peace and
plenty.
Dissensions arose, however, and Ca
bet decided to "o farther "West, and in
1853 4000 acres were secured near this
city, where .New Icaria was established.
The" were compelled to mortgage the
settlement, which caused another dis

to California was discussed, but finally
defeated. The mortgage was eventu

younger men and women constrastinsr
their primitive habits of life with the
comparative luxury of their neighbors,

HIS FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT
DECLARES HIMSELF A SUPPORT
EB OP McKINLEY.
Believes Every Foot of Soil Acquired
by American Valor Should
Be Retained by the \
Government.
George A. Knight, the well known
lawyer and orator, of this city, has for
mally announced his candidacy for the
United States Senate In the event that
GEORGE A, KNIGHT.
the next Legislature is. controlled by
the Republicans. The following state
ment over his own signature is a suffi
cient guarantee that he win make a
hard fight for the honor:
TO THE PUBLIC.
I take this method of announcing
to the people that in the event of
the success of the Republican party
in the election of a majority of the
members of the Legislature this
fall, I will become a candidate for
L'nitf-d States Senator.
I believ.? it is but fair to the
voter that those who aspire to that
exalted position should so declare
their candidacy before the election
of members of the Legislature, so
that the citizen may have some
Idea, at least, for whom he is
voting.
Should I be chosen United States
Senator. I only can pledge the peo
ple to be honest with them, loyal
to my party, and true to my indi
vidual sense of right and justice.
1 am a McKinley Republican, and
if elected to the Senate will assist
in holding up the hands of that wise
statesman and in sustaining his
policy.
I believe this nation has a greater
destiny than Its founders ever
dreamed of, and that no man or
organization of men should be per
mitted to obstruct its progress;
that every foot of soil acquired by
the valor and blood of the Ameri
can soldier and sailor should be
retained as a part and parcel of this
great republic, and that American
industry and American commerce
should be extended to the four
quarters of the globe.
I fe<M that the people of Califor
nia, knowing me as they do. will
give m<- the credit of being at least
the proprietor of my own manhood,
an.l of being Independent of the
domination of, any individual or in
fluence that may be considered in
imical to the interests and well
being of the State. If they have
not this confidence in me, I do not
desire their support.
It has been my practice In every
national and State campaign for the
past twenty years to stump the
Slate in behalf of the Republican
ticket, the success of which, in my
estimation, is paramount to the in
dividual aspirations of any man.
No one should be elected to that
high office unless he be the decided
choice of the Republicans of this
State were they permitted to vole
upon such choice.
In any event I am a Republican
and a Calffornian, and in public or
private station will do all I can to
further the harmonious interests of
both. GEORGE A. KNIGHT.

REPUBLICANISM IS
STRONGER THAN EVER
WEBSTER DAVIS ARRIVES IN
THIS CITY.
The Assistant Secretary of the In
terior Thinks California Is a
Strong Republican State.
Webster Davis, Assistant Secretary of
! the Interior, and onft of the prominent
I politicians of the country, arrived in this
: city yesterday morning. His visit to the
i coast is partly for pleasure, but chiefly
' for political reasons.
Since leaving his home In Kansas City,
Mr. Davis has delivered a number of
speeches on national topics. On Saturday
: evening he spoke to a vast audience in
Sacramento. This evening he will ad
dress a meeting at Oakland; Tuesday
evening at San Jose; Wednesday he will
be heard at Modesto; Fresno. Thursday;
Bakersfield. Friday, and Los Angeles Sat
1 urday. One week from to-night he will
I address a San Francisco audience and
'â  them go north.
Mr. Davis said last night In the Palace
'< Hotel: "The country looks Republican
' and if the meeting which I attended in
1 Sacramento on Saturday night raav be
taken as a basis of judgment this State
: is certainly of the same spirit and the Re
1 publican party will be victorious in the
coming election. I have been stumping
. for the party for some weeks and it Is
my sincere belief that Republicanism
to-day is stronger than ever before. The
people seem to be in accord with the ad
ministration and they should be. The
i next few years will be trying ones and
: the President will need the support of the
â  people. McKinley has well deserved the
confidence of the public. He has wnrlced
: Incessantly since the difficulty with Spain
: began, refusing to rest from his labors
; In the heat of summer when all others
considered their work done for the time."
Mr. Davis' Itinerary will carry him
| through Oregon and Washington. He will
t then return to his home in Kansas City.

York Xteals With Maguire.
Dr. J. L. York, the liberal orator, ad
dressed a large an enthusiastic audience
at Scottish Hall last evening upon "Poli
tical and Religious E%-olution."
Speaking of the political situation Pr.
York said: "From my standpoint the
Democratic party Is the home of the
un-American element In this country. It
is not a great liberty party, and from its
national record of forty years it has been
found wanting in statesmanship and con
structive ability and unfit to control the
destiny of this nation. The varied inter
ests of this republic will find greater pro
tection and security in reatlning our pres
ent national administration during The
present crisis of affairs.
"Let McKinley and a Republican Con
gress finish their work and place our
country beyond the clouds of war, with
v r^nce that will preserve the respect and
honor of thiÃ nation with the nations of
the whole world.
"Magulre and Phelan are both demaÂ»
rogues seeking office 'mi,d the dust of
false Issues. We find to-day only the two
great parties from which to choose, and
we draw the line at this hyda-headad
combination known as the fusion party."

WHY MR. GAGE DID NOT
SPEAK AT WILLOWS
Misunderstanding Between Commit
tees â Contemptible Act of
J. Aubrey Jonas.
WILLOWS, Oct. 23.â The citizens of
Willows, Democrats and Republicans
alike, are extremely indignant over the
account of Henry T. Gage's reception
here yesterday, as printed in Maguire's
organ at San Francisco. That Mr. Gage
did not deliver an address here is true,
but the cause of the disappointment to
the large crowd of people who were here
yesterday lies between the State Central
Committee and the local committee.
When Mr. Gage alighted from the train
he started for an eating house, and when
he was escorted to the improvised stapd
he waa amazed and surprised, knowing
nothing of a reception or occasion for a
speech. His apology was ample, good
natured and should have been sufficient.
The cheers for Magulre came from mis
chievous youngsters, but that stones
were thrown at the car is not true, nor
was any insult offered to Mr. Gage. On
the contrary, his reception was enthu
siastic and sincere, and that even one
vote was lost to Mr. Gage by the unfor
tunate mistake of the local committee
in advertising a twenty-minute speech
here, is not true. The only loss of votes
will' fall upon J. Aubrey Jones, the Demo
cratic nominee for Congress, who so dis
gracefully took advantage of the occa
sion to harangrue the crowd. He will lose
many Silver Republican votes through
his conduct, which every good Democrat
deplores.
Mr. Lilienthal Honored.,
On Thursday evening last E. R. Lilien
thal was presented with a beautiful al
bum by the retail liquor dealers of thÂ«
Red Cross Society, in appreciation of his
work in behalf of the latter society. It
was beautifully bound in red morocco,
and the accompanying resolutions were
the artistic work of Henry London. Harry
B. Adler acted as chairman of the pres
entation committee, which also contained
Jesse B. Marks, E. G. Osborn, J. M. Par
ker, R. H. Flschbeck, J. E. Crumb, T. M.
Ferguson, Charles A. Green and W. F.
Roeder. The presentation speech by Mr.
Mnrks met with an appropriate response
from Mr. Lllienthal.
Young Men Missing.
Alfred Falrweather, an employe of the
London and Paris Bank, and Richard
Drum, his companion, are missing. They
visited the water front last Saturday, in
tending to bid good-by to a friend who
was about to embark on a long voyage.
Since then they have not been seen. Last
night their disappearance was reported to
Chief Lees, who detailed two of his best
men to find them.
REPUBLICANS
TO CONTROL
THE HOUSE
This Fact Now Seems
Assured.
PROBABLE LOSSES IN EAST
WILL BE OFFSET BY THE GAHTS
IN THE WEST.
Many Who Deserted the Grand Old
Party on the Silver Issue Are
Expected to Return to
the Fold.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Eepublican control of the next
House of Representatives seems cer
tain unless there is a political landslide
in favor of the Democrats on Novem
ber 8.
In the present House the Republicans
have a clear majority over all opposi
tion of fifty-six. It is hardly possible
that they will have so large a majority
In the next House, but present indica
tions are that they will control by a
safe majority. They will lose a number
of districts in the Bast and in Illinois,
which are nominally Democratic and
which they could not have hoped to
carry but for the popular uprising
against Bryanism in 1896.
It is improbable, however, on the
other hand that they will gain enough
districts in the West to compensate for
some of those lost in the East.
The best information indicates that
there are 162 districts in which the elec
tion of Kepublican| is practically as
sured. In 124 districts the election of
Democrats may be considered certain.
In five districts the Populists are Bure
of success, and three more will be car
ried by Silver men who owe allegiance
to neither Democrats nor populists.
There are sixty-three districts that
may be classed as doubtful. Of these
the Republicans seem to have the best
chance in thirty-seven, the Democrats
in eighteen and the Populists in eight.
Some of the leading features of the
campaign are the going back to the
regular organization of thousands of
Democrats, especially in the East, who
left it on account of the silver issue in
1R96, and the apparent breaking up of
the Populist forces in many States, doe
to many of the men going into the
Democratic party and many others, es
pecially in the West, going back to the
Republican party, from which they
were attractea by the argument that
depreciated money meant prosperity.
These two movements of voters explain
the probable Democratic gains in the
East and probable Republican gains in
the West.
On the Pacific Coast the Republicans
have already elected two Representa
tives from Oregon, and while it is prob
able Washington will return a Demo
crat and a Silver man. the strength of
the territorial expansion sentiment in
California will probably lead to Repub
lican gains in that State.

TWO MORE BATTLES
FOUGHT IN FORMOSA
Hundreds of Natives Killed by Japa
nese Troops â Overflow of the
Yellow River.
CHICAGO, Oct. 23.â A special to the
Record from Tacoma says: The steam
ship Victoria brings the news that two
more battles have been fought In Formosa
between Japanese troops and the native
Buvagres, who seem bent on exterminating
all the Japanese on the island. So seri
ous are the disturbances that Europeans
and numbers of Chinese merchants are
fleeing to Amoy by every steamer.
A month ago luOO aborigines attacked
and set fire to one of the principal Japan
ese military stations. After eight hours'
desperate lighting the natives retreated.
In this battle more than 200 were killed.
On the following day a large band of na
tives advanced to Hankyo, burning the
station at Tajao. Japanese troops reach
ed Hankyo at the same time and sur
prised the aborigines in their headquar
ters at Ankow, which was burned.
In another battle scores of natives were
shot down. The Formosa rebels have
been supplied with arms and equipments
by the Chinese, hundreds of whom have
landed from Amoy.
The overflowing of thp Yellow River in
Shantung province has caused the most
appalling disaster of modern times in
Central China. Villages wens swept away
by hundreds. One hundred thousand peo
ple are ruined and homeless, crouching
along the river banks in the pitiless rain.
Two thousand were drowned. The gen
eral distress Is augmented by the spoil
ing of the cereal crops by floods. Famine
will prevail this winter in a district pop
ulated by more than one million people.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA Oct. 23.â The commission
of Spaniards sent by General Rios,
Spain's chief representative in the
Philippines, and Governor-General of
the southern portions of the archipel
ago, arranged a temporary commercial
convention, and accordingly interis
land traffic was resumed, but it is now
again interrupted, this time by orders
from General Rios.
The steamer San Nicholas, which left
Manila yesterday, flying the American
flag, was compelled to return by a
Spanish gunboat, whose commander of
fered as a plea for his action that the
crew consisted of Filipinos, who might
smuggle contraband articles. The San
Nicholas after reporting her experience,
sailed again, followed by the United
States gunboat McCulloch.
The insurgent steamer Muriola enter

which was promptly hauled down by
the Americans.
Yesterday the British Consul at Ma

to discuss the commercial deadlock.
British capital to the amount of $200,
000,000 has been lying idle here for six
months. In the existing conditions
business relations with the provinces
have been in many instances directed
suspended. The meeting resolved to
make an urgent appeal to the British
Government to endeavor to hasten a
settlement of pending issues.
The attitude of the insurgent troops
has become very menacing. Their sup
plies are growing scarce, and they are
becoming very desperate. Their leader
assures the trnnpp who have had no pay
for months that they will soon capture
Manila.
The Filipino newspapers insist upon
absolute independence and denounce
annexation to the United States or an

WHITE WINGS DOT THE BAY.
Closing Cruise of Corinthians and
San Franciscos Presented a
Lovely Sight.
Never during the yachting season of
1898 has a prettier sight been seen on the
bay of San Francisco than was presented
yesterday by the Corinthian fleet. Short
ly after 11 o'clock in the morning nearly
thirty yachts, following the flagship
Eolus, sailed in squadron to Sauaalito.
Thence they directed their course toward
the Heads, and later sailed along thÂ© city
water front. There was a fair breezÂ«
and no sea. During the morning the tide
ran out and In the afternoon flooded, po
the conditions were favorable for a chan
nel cruise. Besides the Corinthian fleet
Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill's Cygnus sail
ed out to the Golden Gate, followed by A.
Sutherland's Catherine and J. R. Sa
vory's Juanita. The fine schooners Ra
mona and Aggie also went for a channel
cruise.
Yesterday served as a most agreeable
and picturesque closing day of the sea
son. Next Sunday the drawbridge at
Tiburon will be opened and tne Corin
thian yachts will pass through into their
winter quarters in the lagoon. Commo
dore Dr. T. L. Hill of the San Franciscos
will sail his yacht up to Larkspur and
lay her up there for the winter. Vice
Commodore G. T. S. White will keep his
sloop Will o' the Wisp in commission for
some time longer, and Commodore Hill
will amuse himself during the winter
with a half-rater.
YOUNG MEN AND THE CHURCH.
Lecture of Rev. John A. B. Wilson
at the Evening Service.
At the Strangers' Sabbath Home, How
ard-street Methodist Episcopal Church,
between Second and Third, a large con
gregation assemble^ to hear the pastor,
John A. B. Wilson, D.D., tackle the young
man and the church problem. His theme
was "Has Christianity anything to offer
a young man in compensation for the ser
vice which it requires." His text was
1 Tim., iv:B, "Godliness is profitable unto
all things having the promise of the Ufa
that now is and of that which is to
come."
The sermon showed the advantage in
the present life of Christianity to the in
dividual and to nations, and was illus
trated by actual examples. The demon
stration was that the teachings of the
Bible were in exact harmony with the
laws of being, and that self-denial fur
nished its own compensation in the length
of days of comfort of mind and propriety
which are the legitimate outcome of prac
ticing the system, and that the character
so developed Is that unto which is prom
ised the eternal rewards of the future.
The service will be continued next Sab
bath night, and young men are requested
to continue writing letters to the pastor
in answer to the question why do not
more young men in this city attend
church"? All are requested to sign names
and give their addresses. Names will not
be read from the pulpit or given to tbe
press.
M. L. WASHBTTRN ARRIVES.
The Report He Brings From tha
Cooks Inlet Gold Diggings la
â¢ Not Encouraging.
M. L. Washburn, agent for the Alaska
Commercial Company, returned from
Cooks Inlet yesterday, after an absence
of several months. His report on the
condition of affairs in that portion of
Alaska is not very glowing. Washburn
has made an annual trip to Alaska dur
ing the last twenty years and has a
thorough knowledge of exislting condi
tions in the far north.
Shortly before leaving the inlet news
was brought to his camp of the wreck of
a sloop, Johnson, captain. The nine men
on board, miners, in search of new dig
gings, were lost.
The coal belt, which commences at the
mouth of Cooks Inlet, and of which so
much has been written, is, according to
Washburn, of little value. The coal is
of a very inferior quality, useless as a
commercial product and ser.-ing the sole
purpose of fuel. Washburn will return
to Alaska in the spring.
Drew Pistols on Girls.
Thomas J. Madden, a horseman, was
arrested on Grant avenue last evening by
Officers Rainsberry and Barry, and
charged at the California-street police
station with assault with a deadly
"weapon. The complaining witness, Irene
Wilson, claims that during an altercation
Madden drew a pistol and threatened to
shoot her. Madden denies the charge.
John Hoist, a laborer, was arrested at
the Klondike saloon on Kearny street by
Officers Flinn and McGrayan and booked
on the same charge which was placed
against Madden. Hoist went Into the
saloon, and after drinking with a girl
named Mabel Wilklson, he quarreled with
her, and drew a revolver. The barkeeper
gave Hoist a blow in the face which
necessitated his removal to the Harbor
Receiving Hospital, from where he was
taken to the California-street police sta
tion.

0 BETTER WEEK IN TRODE.
LAST week showed considerable improvement in
trade over its predecessor. Some lines, hitherto
dull and unsatisfactory, exhibited more life, and
the tendency in prices seemed to be upward again.
The leading feature of the week was the rise in wheat
under an enormous export demand for Europe,
though the shipments were less than those during the
same week last year by almost 500,000 bushels. The
demand last year, however, was unprecedented.
Another gratifying feature last week was the
scramble among European financiers to provide gold
for America, to pay for our heavy shipments of grain
and merchandise to Great Britain and the Continent.
This tended to still further ease the money market
and restore confidence, which, however, needed very
little restoration, never having been shaken to any
marked degree. In international commerce the
United States has had the whip hand for a year or
more, and is such a creditor of Europe that it bids fair
to hold it for some time to come.
Still another good feature was the improvement in
several staples which have recently been distin
guished by abnormal depression. Thus wool, which
has been in the slough of despond for months, showed
indications of doing better, the transactions being
larger than for some time, though prices showed no
gain. In fact the Boston sales, which were free, were
made at slight concessions. The woolen trade also
reported more liberal sales, with an extensive inquiry.
The manufacturers hope that this improvement is the
beginning of the long-deferred demand, though the
call at present is for low-priced goods. Cotton, too,
seems to be on the point of a revival. The spinners
have agreed upon a selling agency, which has hung
fire for some time, and also upon a curtailed produc
tion, and in consequence there is a bettej demand for
goods, with fair prospects for an increase in the fu
ture.
But it is in cereals that the improvement in trade is
most pronounced. The advance in wheat was purely
legitimate, being based upon actual European de
mand, and was wholly free from manipulation. Corn,
too, participated in the improved inquiry, and ad
vanced slightly, the shipments from Atlantic ports
being 2,634,400 bushels, against 652,400 for the same
week last year. Indications of a Franco-British war,
though vague, have served to increase this legitimate
demand for cereals, and it was a fine week in grain
all around.
Against these gratifying conditions, however, were
a halt in the iron trade and a relapse in Wall street,
where a profound depression settled down. The pub
lic again deserted the street, leaving the market
wholly in the hands of the professionals, and on at
least two days the sales on the Exchange fell to less
than 150,000 shares. The causes of this depression
were the uncertainty regarding the election and ap
prehensions regarding the Fashoda affair, which at
the moment hangs like a cloud over international
finance and tends to financial caution all over Europe.
London got pessimistic over it and did some realizing
in Wall street. In spite of these unfavorable condi
tions, however, the public hung on to their securities
and prices did not decline except in a very few in
stances. The undercurrent of the market was strong,
holders basing their confidence on the ease of the
money market, the large earnings of railroads and the
heavy exports of cereals already mentioned. A strong
-feature to the situation was the utter indifference of
the street to the recent rise in discounts and bank
rates in England and on the Continent.
Here in California conditions were steady and some
changes were apparent. First, there was the rise in
wheat, which led to lively chartering of ships for ex
port, advanced tonnage rates materially, and gave a
brighter aspect to the whole grain trade. The dried
fruit market, too, which has been very dull for sev
eral weeks, showed signs of emerging from its apathy,
and the Eastern markets came through stronger,
owing to the cooler weather there, and several de
scriptions advanced. The rise has not yet reached
this market, however, though it probably will before
long at the present rate of progression. The course
of this market this fall has puzzled the oldest heads
in the business. With remarkably short fruit crops
all over the world, we should have had a lively mar
ket, whereas we have had a dull and weak one. No
body in the trade has yet explained why this is, for
the very good reason that the trade are all at sea.
It was a good week, too, for the vineyardists. The
price of grapes increased 50 per cent, and the de
mand increased in proportion. The crop is turning
out shorter than expected, and the wine-makers find
that if they want to make wine this year they will
have to pay up for the grapes. Stock-raisers also
found a good market for their cattle and sheep, and
the price of hogs advanced at the close.
Altogether it was the best week in general trade
that the country has enjoyed for some little time.
Harold Frederic's death is ascribed to Christian
science, but even those who bring the charge will ad
mit that heart disease has been known to be fatal
even in the absence of disciples of this science.
PHELfIN'S FORLORN HOPE.
a a AYOR PHELAN'S campaign for re-election
/ \ >s now reduced to a forlorn hope. His only
*â  * chance for success is to win over to himself
a strong following of Republicans. Large numbers
of his own party will repudiate him. The independent
voters who trusted him two years ago can no longer
be deluded. Unless by some means he can carry a
considerable portion of the Republican vote, he will
be overwhelmingly defeated.
He has only himself and his flatterers to blame for
the heavy odds now against him. The disaffection of
the Democrats is due to the high-handed manner in
which he usurped all authority in the party and set
aside the tried leaders and the rank and file for the
purpose of making himself supreme. Never before in
this or in any American city did a political boss ever
so completely override the principles of popular gov
ernment and so contemptuously ignore the people as
Phelan did when he joined with the Committee of
One Hundred to put up a so-called Democratic ticket
without giving the members of the party any voice
or representation in the selection of candidates.
Deprived of their right to participate in the nomi
nation of candidates, there is but one way by which
Democrats can rid their party of the incubus that has
fastened upon it, and that is to refuse to recognize
the Phelan nominees as a Democratic ticket and to
vote against it at the polls. That is what will be done.
The leaders of the party are outspoken in their oppo
sition to the usurping committee, and the great mass
of the rank and file who believe in true Democracy
and in self-government are determined to overthrow
what they call "the gang of the plug-hat boss."
Phelan now perceives the mistake he made in
tricking the Democratic leaders and refusing to allow
the Democratic masses to have a voice in the nomi
nation of the Democratic ticket. He sees he has lost
the support of his own party, and is now trying by ?
thousand devices to win Republican votes.
He poses as a man of ultra respectability, virtue
and honesty. It is known that he obtained his nomi
nation by a high-handed fraud upon his party, and
by methods showing he is utterly unscrupulous in
politics, but he asks Republicans to believe he did that
only because Democrats cannot be trusted to nomi
nate honest men, and that if elected he will be most
scrupulous and most honest in performing the duties
of Mayor.
It is hardly likely any intelligent voter in the Re
publican party will be deceived by this presumptuous
pretender to the honors of a political reformer. A
Republican convention which fairly represented the
masses of the party has nominated for Mayor a gen
tleman who does not have to pose or to seek the pur
chased praises of fawners or flatterers. His nomina
tion came without his solicitation; he is making a
canvass on the highest plane of citizenship, and can
be relied upon to fulfill the duties of the Mayoralty
with the economy and efficiency of a man of business,
the progressiveness of a true civic patriot, and without
arrogance of any kind.
Phelan's search for Republican votes is a forlorn
hope. It is as desperate a hazard as ever a political
adventurer made in an effort to redeem follies and
frauds and blunders. Republicans will stand by their
ticket, independent voters will stand with them, and
hundreds of self-respecting Democrats will unite to
crush the would-be boss and give San Francisco a
good government under the administration of Charles
L. Patton.
THE REPUBLICAN JUDICIAL TICKET.
ONE of the strong features of the Republican
local ticket is the excellence of the nomina
tions made for judicial offices. The vital ne
cessity to the community of having on the bench, men
learned in the law and of the highest probity was
recognized by the Republican convention and great
care was taken in selecting candidates for the judge
ships. As a result the party presents to the people
a judicial ticket worthy of the unanimous support of
the community.
Such men as James M. Troutt, Davis Louderback,
John Carson and Henry N. Clement hardly need a
recommendation to the voters of San Francisco.
None of them has lived his life in a corner. Each
has a high repute for legal ability and for integrity
among the members of their profession and in the
community generally. Judge Troutt has already shown
on the Superior bench his fitness for the office.
Judge Louderback's record as Police Judge attests
his qualifications for the place to which he now
aspires, while Mr. Carson and Mr. Clement hold a
high rank at the bar and can be counted on to main
tain when elected the best traditions of the bench. An
equal merit is to be found in the nominees for
Police Judgeships and for Justices of the Peace.
The people can afford to take no chances in the
election of Judges. An honest, able, independent and
courageous judiciary is the only safeguard to the
rights and property of citizens. Even those persons
who never have suits in court are benefittcd by the
virtue of the judiciary and would be injured by its
corruption. Any weakness, inefficiency or moral or
intellectual dishonesty on the part of our Judges is
at once felt by intelligent men to be a menace to all.
It is, therefore, one of the most important political
duties of the citizen to elect good Judges. It was on
that understanding the Republican convention made
its nominations, and all voters, without respect to
party, can serve their own interests and those of the
community as a whole by voting for every candidate
on the Republican judicial ticket.
A PREPOSTEROUS CLOIM.
DISPATCHES from Paris arc to the effect that
"the critical point" in the negotiations be
tween the United States and Spain has been
reached by the Commissioners, and European author
ities are reported to be uneasy about the result. The
so-called critical point is that raised by Spain in the
demand that the United States assume the debts of
all colonies of whose sovereignty Spain is deprived
as a result of the war.
The whole tenor of the European discussion on the
subject shows an evident desire to work up sympathy
for Spain and to induce the United States to assume
the debts that Spain has contracted. Of course the
source of this desire lies in the fact that the bonds
representing the debt are held by European bankers,
particularly by those of Paris, and it would be very
pleasing to the bondholders to have our Government
guarantee their payment.
The claim is a preposterous one, and neither the
diplomacy of Spain nor the persuasive eloquence of
its Parisian sympathizers can change its nature or
make it appear just. It is asserted that by depriving
Spain of her colonies the United States inflicts upon
her a loss of upward of $600,000,000, and that it would
be becoming to our greatness and magnanimity to
deal generously with the conquered and relieve her
to some extent of that loss.
In this claim the fact is overlooked that the United
States has incurred an expense estimated at about
$360,000,000 to carry on the war. That it was a con
test not of our seeking. That we demand no money
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 24, 189 S.
indemnity from Spain. That we are not going to
exact heavy revenues from the liberated colonies to
repay us for our expenditures. That, in short, we are
going to bear our share of the cost of the conflict,
and therefore are not dealing harshly when we insist
that Spain bear whatever burdens she has brought
upon herself.
Had Spain been at war with any European power
she would not now be talking of inducing her con
queror to assume any part of her debt. She would
be pleading to escape from some such heavy in
demnity as that which Germany exacted from
France. We have been generous enough. We can
not in common justice impose the Spanish debts on
the Cubans or the Philippine islanders, neither would
our Government be justified in imposing them upon
ourselves. Spain contracted the debts and she must
pay them. The bondholders who loaned her the
money to maintain her power over the people of Cuba
and the Philippines must look to her for repayment.
PREBLE AGAIN TO THE RESCUE.
If is an attribute of the people who want to confiscate
land and make of the owners of all other property
a privileged class, enjoying the protection of gov
ernment and paying none of its cost, to object to the
obvious conclusions and deductions from their theory
and its statement.
In his first letter, defending Maguire's defense of
anarchy, Mr. Preble quoted the Judge's speech and
said: "Every syllable of that speech must be in
dorsed by enlightened citizens who believe in the
great democratic principle of political equality and
freedom, whose minds are not biased by race or class
prejudice."
This is a plain declaration that Maguire's indorse
ment of anarchists and nihilists was a declaration of
principles. After defending the anarchists in several
ensuing sentences, Mr. Preble returned to a restate
ment of Maguire's principles, saying: "What Judge
Maguire stands for is broad-minded liberalism, free
dom of thought and action, the reward "of service and
abolition of privilege, the highest ideals of the most
exalted human prerogatives â all that Paine and Jef
ferson and Franklin and Lincoln and Henry George
stood for in the onward march of human progress."
Mr. Preble now denies that he is in sympathy with
anarchists. If this be true, he has changed since his
last letter and is not one of the "enlightened citi
zens who must indorse every syllable" of Maguire's
anarchist speech. He also denies that he intended to
say that Paine, Franklin, Jeffetson and Lincoln
stood for what Maguire advocated in that speech
which all "enlightened men" must indorse.
Therefore in his letter published to-day he pulls
Maguire out of the exalted company of those sages,
or pulls them out of Maguire's exalted company, he
does not state which.
He draws also a distinction between "hunger-crazed"
and "poverty-crazed," and says in using the latter he
meant mental poverty. Well, we will admit that
many are born that way, under all institutional forms.
Mr. Preble says it is caused "by the denial by a class
of the right of the mass to the use of the earth on
terms of equality and justice." This class are the pri
vate land-owners, to confiscate whose property Mr.
Preble declares to be his religion, "just and holy, in
consonance with the laws of God."
We invite the attention of land-owners to this sec
ond letter of Mr. Preble, that they may find out what
style of abandoned wretches they are.
A man works on the streets at unskilled labor or in
the shops a&^a mechanic; he is prudent, temperate,
keeps his character upright, and saves money. When
his savings have accumulated they represent his
stored up labor; his tastes lead him to rural life and
instead of investing his money, the proceeds of his
labor, in personal property and business, he buys a
piece of land and makes upon it his home. Imme
diately, according to "Mr. Preble and Judge Maguire,
he becomes "a monopolist," a "denier of the right of
the mass to the use of the earth on terms of equality
and justice," with a land title "of indefensible origin,"
and "may at any moment be justly expelled by the
lawful owner, society."
He is told by Maguire and Preble that he is the
cause of anarchy, of that "poverty craze" which makes
men commit murder to recover the rights he has
robbed them of by investing his earnings in land.
Now Mr. Preble declares that in these characteri
zations of the land-owner he is hurling at this class the
thunder of "God's law." No fanaticism is as dan
gerous as that which piously asserts itself as an
agency of the divine purpose. Not many score of
years ago, in this country and Europe, old women
with moles on their chins or surplus hairs on their
chops, were being hanged, burned, put between
boards and sawn asunder or crushed between planks
for the crime of witchcraft. When their judges and
executioners were reasoned with, they replied, with
the shibboleth of Maguire and Preble and the land
confiscators, that belief in witchcraft was their re
ligion. Mr. Preble says that millions of the brightest
intellects believe with him and Maguire that the land
owner is a criminal against God's law. The witch
burner made the same answer, and truthfully, and
could point to that enlightened Judge, Sir Matthew
Hale, and the brightest props of church and state in
Europe and America.
It does not occur to these self-chosen adminis
trators of God's law that inequality of right to oc
cupy land as property was destroyed in this country
when Mr. Jefferson destroyed entail and primogeni
ture; that now men may earn money and invest in
land and buy and sell because there is no entail by
which land may be monopolized. The transfer of
land ownership is the same in law and morals as the
transfer of the ownership of personal property. The
laborer who saves money and buys land, and there
are more of that class in this country than elsewhere
in the world, owns that which his labor has bought,
and is not a criminal against God's law, nor the cause
of mental poverty, nor a monopolist and robber and
oppressor, though he is accused of all these by Judge
Maguire and Mr. Preble.
South Omaha has an enterprising Chief of Police
who believes in prize-fighting when the purse can be
so split up as to give him a share. It is for this rea
son he has been arrested as accessory to murder, a
pugilist having suffered the discomfort of being killed
in the ring after he had paid the Chief for the privi
lege. The questions naturally arising involve not only
the moral status of the official, but revive a debate
as to whether to kill a pugilist can be regarded as a
crime.
Pullman profits were never so great as for the cur

MR. PHELAN AS THE NEW LIGHT.
A "Plain Citizen" Resumes His Discussion ol tne Plug-
Hat Boss and His Uniitness lor Office.
Editor San Francisco Call: Our American system of Government was
devised by men who knew the value of popular rights. They formulated the
principle that the people were the depositories of political power. They
knew it was necessary for the conduct of government to delegate that
power to individuals. But they made the delegation reluctantly and ex
pressly declared that rower not delegated in set terms remained with the
people.
The fathers of the republic gave power grudgingly to officials because
they 1. iew that power given by the people might be used against the
people. They did not take into account the honor, dignity, convenience or
ease of the political official; they consulted only for the security of the com
mon people. They made no provision for giving a free rein to great and
good reformers. They legislated for the ordinary politician. Wise, wealthy
and benevolent statesmen they knew might arise in the 'nture to lift the
masses to their own level and to benefit the populace In spite of itself. But
for theÃe benefactors of humanity our forefathers made no provisions. They
thought it better that the people should slowly and painfully climb the
heights through their own efforts rather than that they should through
the agency of some angelic politician be suddenly lifted by the hair of the
head into the clear and serene atmosphere wherein dwell the professional
non-partisan and the googoos.
HENCE OUR CONSTITUTION
Shows an elaborate hatred of the concentration of nn^-T and betrays In a
hundred places the anxiety of the founders to divide and subdivide politi
cal auihority. By a device up to that time unknown they split the supreme
authority into three parts and lodged it in three co-ordinate and independ
ent bodies. The power of making laws the- gave to a legislature; the
power of enforcing laws they conferred on a chief cxc utive; the power
of interpretating the laws they placed in a supreme court. These three pow
ers they made independent the one of the other, and so hedged them round
about that their attributes could not be confounded. Neither the President
nor any of his appointees could sit in Congress. No legislator who took
office could retain his seat in the Legislature. The Supreme Judges were ap
pointed for life so that no President could in the ordinary course of hu
man events control a majority of them and so that they would not be con
taminated by the party passion or swayed by the t opular fury that might
dominate a legislative assembly*
All this divl- 1 â "f authority has only one end, namely, to prevent the
power of the neople from being used against the people. As long as the
supreme authority is so split up the plain citizen is safe. No official can be
come so great as to override the law, and as long as law reigns, the Dlain
citizen, that is, you and I, has nothing to fear.
BUT IN OPPOSITION
To this elaborate system of checks and balances there Is another system
which apr-als to certain minds. When a general is sent out with an army
he mrÂ» â¢ those about him. Therefore it may be well for him to choose
his own staff. But whether he chooses them or not, they must obey him
and carry out his orders implicitly. The army Is one great organization.
The general is the head. The officers are the nerves that carry his mes
sages, the muscles that move the members.
Such a system is wondrously effective. The army does its work. A gov
ernment organized on such a plan would perform its duties at a minimum
of pxpense and at a maximum of efficiency. But it would not be a free govern
ment. It would be an unmitigated despotism.
Under our system we have deliberately chosen to prefer liberty to effi
ciency. A certain lack of effect, of cheapness, is the price we pay for our
freedom. Every method has been devised to prevent any one man from ob
taining a monopoly of political power. This is true of the State Governments
as well as of the Federal Government. The system is carried down to the
counties and municipalities on which the State rests. Freedom cannot
spring from despotism as a pure stream cannot flow from a polluted
source. If tie towns and counties are not free the State cannot be free.
Liberty does not come from above downward; it mounts from below up
ward.
Therefore In the government of this municipality of San Francisco the
general principles of the American system appear well developed. Politi
cal power Is divided between a Mayor with several executive officers, a
judiciary and a Board of Supervisors. The limits of their authority are
sharply defined. One must not tresDass on the bounds of the other. The
power given by the people may be used to hurt the people. Division of power
means the protection of the plain citizen, such as you and I.
Since this system has been elaborated for the benefit of the plain citizen,
that is, for your benefit and mine, it is our duty to stand by it, to preserve
it, to perpetuate it. Any tampering with it demands a Jealous eye. It is
our protection and we must guard it well.
NOW THE FIRST OBJECT WHICH A BOSS
Has in view is to gather to himself the powers thus divided for the good of
the plain people. He schemes to control the executive officers, the Super
visors, the Judges. A boss may hold office x>r not. Whether he does or not
makes little difference. His power consists in the fact that other officers are"
controlled by him. If he runs for office the people may defeat him. But
such defeat cannot destroy his power as long as he retains influence over
others. Some are now saying 1 that if we are to have a boss let us have one
elected by the people. But election by the people does not make or unmake
the boss. The boss has power because he controls men that hold office, not
because he holds office himself.
Where we have many bosses the control of officials Is in many hands.
One boss holds the Supervisors, another influences the judiciary, a third the
Sheriff's office, a fourth the County Clerk's. The incumbents of these offices
may be each his own boss. As they are always looking for more power
and are usually antagonistic the purpose of our government is fulfilled.
Power is divided and no official becomes so great as to contemn the reason
able demands of the private citizen, that Is, of you and of me. In such a
condition of affairs we can always play one boss against the other, and
where all are looking for popularity popular interests may receive some at
tention.
But if one man can control the whole city government where are our
guarantees? If one man can name the executive officials, the Board of Su
pervisors, the Judges; if one man can not only name them, but control
them, where is the protection for the plain citizen? You and I then become
mere' pawns on the chessboard. We are moved without our consent or
against our will wherever, whenever and however the master mind dictates.
NO BOSS PRETENDS
That he Is striving for political control. He uses many means to compass
his ends, and his means, as they are made known to the public, are de
scribed as being for the benefit of the public. Mr. James Phelan is by no
means a dull man. He has shown an aptitude for politics very creditable
to his. talents. He gauges public sentiment and he knows the cry that will
s.tir the people's hearts. He knows when to appear on the platform so as to
receive the applause. He has calculated to a nicety the psychological mo
ment when a veto or a message will catch the pnbllc attention. Even such
little details as paving a street do not escape him, and he knows how to
defer gently the fulfillment of a contract months old until its performance is
calculated to render the heart of the onlooklng voter as soft and as warm
as the asphaltum plaster that covers the patent blocks.
Therefore Mr. James Phelan does not come before the people with any
crude or undigested arguments as to his fitness to boss this town. He
comes to the people and proclaims himself one of them. He says: "It la
for your benefit that I am sacrificing myself. Day after day I am working
overtime. Consider my sad caseâ so hard have I labored in your behalf that
in a whole year T have been able to take only a two months' vacation. I am
in this fight for your benefit. You want good government, and I am going
to see that you get It and from me.
"But," he continues, "if lam to give you good government you must
trust me. You must give me men who will support my policy. I admit
that I have done nothing during the last two years. The Board of Supervis
ors blocked me here: the Auditor thwarted me there; the Assessor would
not do what I wanted him and half a dozen other officials had the impudence
to think for themselves. I wanted to do good and I knew nothing could be
done well as long as it was not done in my way. When I could not have
my way I did nothing. Therefore now give me men who will support my
policy and let me have my own way."
THE PLAIN CITIZEN
Marks, swallows and Inwardly digests these words. The plain citizen, that
is, you and I. thinks within himself "to support my policy" means to "let me
have my own way," and both are a new method of saying "to do my bid
ding." The campaign, therefore, made by Mr. Phelan is an appeal to the
people to upturn their own institutions. The people are committed to a plan of
the division of power. This argument is a demand for the concentration of
power. Fill all the offices with the nominees of James Phelan and James
Phelan will pee that the government is run as James Phelan thinks best.
The test of fitness for office, therefore, In the new dispensation is not
honesty or independence, but agreement with Mr. Phelan. This is the one
political virtue Tin which hang all others. The man who agrees with Mr.
Phelan's policy is the true and pure patriot. The man who ventures to dis
agree with Mr. Phelan's policy Is a thief and robber.
Neither Mr. Phelan nor his followers deny that this Is the new touch
stone of honor. He makes the plea himself, his followers make it for him.
HIS ONE CRY IS,
"Give me men who will work with meâ Supervisors who will do my bidding
officials who will bow at my nod." In the City Hall to-day there are certain
men of the same party as Mr. Phelan whose honesty has never been ques
tioned. They are few, it is true, but their characters are above reproach
Mr. Phelan's campaign is ostensibly made to put such men into office!
But the Committee of One Hundred has coldly passed them by. They had
the misfortune to differ from Mr. Phelan. This is the unpardonable s ln. In
every other walk of life men may differ honestly. Plain people have a way
of holding: on to their own opinions. You think one thing; I think an
other: but we do not on that account, call one another rascal or thi<f But
it is different with Mr. Phelan. Every man who is not willing to work with
him, to support his policy, to let him have his own wayâ ln other words
to do his bidding, must be rejected and must be rejected in the name of
good government. When the other bosses refuse to give a man the nomi
nation at least they leave him his character. The new boss refuses a man the
nomination and in refusing it leaves the unfortunate applicant without a rag
of reputation to cover his shame.
For the plain citizenâ for you and for meâ the Issue 1b joined in this
campaign. The political wisdom and the political experience of this country
is embodied in our constitution. That constitution holds that the welfare o*f
the plain citizenâ your welfare and mineâ demands that power be divided and
that no one man shall control it all. Here is Mr. Phelan, a politician, who
comes to us and sets himself against the system under which he has been
born and reared, and says: "It is all wrong. There is a better way. Con
centrate all the power in my hands. Forget the wisdom of the past. I
am the new light." The plain citizen is suspicious of new lights. You and
I have heard of the wandering fire that draws the benighted traveler from
the safe and ancient road across marsh and moor and fen. Oayly it dances
before him, deceiving his eyes and filling his mind with thoughts of comfort
by the warm fireside and good cheer. These dreams lend fresh courage to
his sou!. He struggles on, forgetting all behind. And, lo! when he thinks
the gleam is in his reach he stumbles into an open grave.
NUMBER TWO.
A PLAIN CITIZEN.
MOGUIRE AND ANARCHY.
Editor Call: In your issue of the 12th
Inst., in an editorial headed "Maguire
and Anarchy," fou do me the honor of
characterizing me as Maguire'a "de
fender and supporter," "friend and
spokesman." I am proud to be regarded
as his friend and supporter, but as. to
being his defender and spokesman I
must disclaim any right to such dis
tinction until his course needs defend
ers and his matchless ability to act as
his own spokesman has waned.
I wish, however, that you would
grant me space to make one or two ob
servations which your editorials fol
lowing my letter of October 5 have
called forth and to correct some mis
statements you have made concerning
things I said, misstatements made, I
am charitable enough to believe, not
deliberately or maliciously, but care
lessly and due perhaps to a faulty
memory and a failure to read beyond
the type and accurately interpret ray
meaning, though I tried to be plain.
First, in speaking of such revolu
tionary anarchists as the slayers of
Carnot and the Empress of Austria, I
said "poverty-crazed," not "hunger
crazed." There is a difference. There
are a good many in this land of plenty
who are well nigh poverty-crazed, yet
who have never known the loss of a
meal or felt the pangs of hunger.
The knowledge of monopolized nat
ural sources of wealth held out of use,
or used to enrich the captains of privi
lege at the expense of the masses, is a
far greater menace to the stability of
this or any other Government at the
hands of the masses before they have
got to the hunger-crazed stage than it
can be after the life and spirit have been
starved out of them. I used the term
"poverty-crazed" advisedly and In its
fullest sense. The poverty of intellect
which permits a human being to be
lieve that any wrong can be righted by
murder is the child of a material pov
erty caused by the denial by a class of
the right of the mass to the use of the
earth on terms of equality and Justice.
You are doubtless correct in your as
sertion that Herr Most is not a hunger
crazed wretch. He was one of the
strongest supporters of Mr. McKinley
of Canton in the campaign of 1896, if I
am not mistaken. I do not imply by
this, however, that Mr. McKinley is the
associate, apologist or defender of an
archists.
In my letter I took special pains to
say that I was not defending anar
chism or pleading its cause, nor am I
now attempting an apology for any
thing I wrote. You wrong me in sayinff
that I avow myself in sympathy with
anarchy. I am in sympathy with noth
ing but absolute justice and freedom of
thought and speech. Your suggestion
that my letters be used as a campaign
document by the Republican State Cen
tral Committee is a good one. I hope it
will be done. I am egotist enough to
believe that it would, in conjunction
with the small pamphlet issued by
them, entitled "Maguire, the Farmer,
the Single Tax," do much to advance
the cause of truth.
You said in your article of the 12th
inst, in speaking of anarchists and
their doctrines, "These are the princi
ples which Mr. Preble says were the
same as Paine and Jefferson, Lincoln
and Henry George stood for in the on
ward march of human progress."
Now, Mr. Editor, if in your wisdom
you see fit to leave out any or all of the
preceding portion of this letter I hope
you will at least set me right before
your readers in this regard. What I
said was: "Judge Maguire stands for
broad-minded liberalism, freedom of
thought and action, the reward of ser
vice and abolition of privilege â the
highest ideals of the most exalted hu
man prerogatives â all that Paine, Jef
ferson, Franklin, Lincoln and Henry
George stood for," etc. â some difference
between that and "Do as you wish, "
"Everything is everybody's," "Down
with government in all its authority
and all its forms."
I do not object to criticism or even
ridicule for my opinions, but it is not
fair to misquote and misrepresent. Of
the single tax, I have but to say that
who attacks it attacks my religion â not
only mine, but that of some millions of
others numbering among them many
of the brightest intellects and natural
law-and-order-loving people In the An
glo-Saxon race throughout the civilized
world, who regard it in principle and
theory as being right, just and holyâ m
consonance with the laws of God and in
line with the evolutionary spirit and
progress of modern fiscal policy. Re
spectfully submitted.

ARRIVAL OF THE SAN JUAN
THE NICARAGUA CANAL BOUTE
BEING EXAMINED.
Arrival of a Party of Experts Prom
New York Causes Much Un
easiness on the
Isthmus.
They are having lively times In Pan
ama. According to the news brought by
the Mall steamer San Juan a goodly por
tion of the business part of the town has
been burned and the authorities are
terribly worried over the building of the
Nicaragua canal. Naturally the people
of the isthmus do not want to see that
scheme carried through by the United
States, as it would be a death blow to
Panama.
The fire which did so much damage to
Panama broke out a few days before the
Ban Juan sailed for San Francisco. Jt j
began in the store of Francisco Torm and
Is supposed to have been of incendiary
origin. Thirty-two buildings and their
contents were burned and five were de
molished in attempts to stay the progress
of the flames. The loss. including mer
chandise, is estimated at $300,000.
They have no water works In Panama,
but the Panama Railway Steamship Com
pany got its pumps to work and saved
a lot of property besides its own wharves. j
The city had plenty of hose, but the coup
lings would not fit the steamship com
pany's appliances, so little could be done. j
Large quantities of alcohol, rum and ker- j
osene were stored in the burning build- |
ings and they materially assisted the con- i
flagration. In the store of Hipolito de la j
Oliva, dynamite was stored, and when the |
explosive went off everybody thought the
end of the world had come. There was al
most a panic and the troops had to be
called out to preserve order. Fresh goods
had been ordered and the work or re
building many of the stores had begun be
fore the San Juan sailed.
The arrival of the steamer Finance i
brought to Panama F. Eyre of W. R.
Grace & Co., Edward Cragin of Chicago j
Drainage Canal fame, Frank Washburn j
of Washburn & Sons, contractors of New j
"York and Alex Bacon, a New York attor- |
ney. They remained a short time on the 1
isthmus and the people were hoping j
against hope that their visit might have I
something to do with the Panama canal.
All their hopes went a glimmering, how
ever, when the gentlemen in question
took passage for Corinto, Nicaragua, with ,
the avowea intention of going over and
making a thorough examination of the
Nicaragua canal route. They will return
home via San Francisco, but will probably ,
have very little to say about the scheme. I
According to the officers of the San Juan !
the Eyre, Cragin, Washburn party will j
remain in Nicaragua a month.

were Maurice Drake, : Mrs. Thraylkill,

The new yacht Gladys, built for Thomas j

deck of the Andrew Welch. The hand
some little craft met with a bad mishap
before she was got aboard. She was
brought over from Stone's shipyard last
Thursday morning and the vessel was to
go to sea as soon as the yacht was safely ;
aboard. In order to get the Gladys into
the space reserved on deck for her she
had to be taken between the Andrew
Welch and the wharf. The swell from a
passing ferry steamer threw the bark
against the yacht, jamming the latter
against the piles, smashing a couple
of her planks, starting others and doing
gome minor damage. The builder worked
all that day and all night on the yacht
and got things shipshape again se> that
the Andrew Welch was only detained a
day.

MANILA HEROES TELL OF THEIR
EXPERIENCES.
"THE citizens of San Francisco had
J their first real opportunity yester
day to gaze upon a lot of genuine
heroes. The invalid soldiers who re
turned on the Rio Janeiro were
the cynosures of every eye at the
Presidio. Not only were they
visited by the men now en
camped at the Presidio and about
to depart for the Philippines, and who
wanted to know all they had to ex
pect, but many hundreds of citizens as
well plied the heroes with questions
until the men grew weary of answer-
Ing. The boys who have been, and
seen and conquered and lived to re
turn are not loth to talk and tell of
their experiences, and while the most
of them, especially those that return
with wounds, are extremely modest,
yet a pinch of salt has to be taken
with the statements of a few.
Major Matthews stated that all of
the men are doing nicely, and of the
dozen who are really sick he has hopes
of recovery in all but one case, that of
Private William S. Jefferson, an un
assigned recruit of the First Colorado.
He has typhoid fever with complica
tions and cannot recover. His death
is but the question of a few hourÃ.
Private Fred Carver, Company G,
Fiftv-flrst lowa, is also lying at
death's door with the same disease.
The returned soldiers took advan
tage of the beautiful weather to re
main out of doors as much as possible.
They gathered upon the verandas and
steps of the barracks, and each and
every man was surrounded by an In
terested group of admirers, who lis
tened eagerly to every word that fell
from the lips of him who had been
there. Major Matthews permitted tha
California boys to go into the city and
visit their homes, and he also allowed
others who had friends here to go and
see them.
The men who have returned will be
furloughed just as rapidly as they get
well enough to leave the hospital.
Those members of the Thirteenth
Minnesota who are sufficiently re
covered will leave for their homes on
r private car to-night. The car was
provided for their especial benefit by
the Governor of the State. Some of
the men are Soldiers whose time of
service is nearly up, and who have
been sent back with only a few days
40 serve, and when this is up they will
be discharged. All of the soldiers are
happy to be at home again and not
one of them haÃ so far expressed any
desire to return to Manila. They all
declare that this country is good
enough for them, and that while their
patriotism has not cooled in the future
they will think twice before they go
again.
jKose Who Wear
the J^auser's Scars
THERE is no doubt that to those of
the soldiers who brought home the
mark of a Mauser bullet upon their
person was accorded the greatest hom
age yesterday by the crowd that went
out to visit the hospital. The men
who were so lucky as to be wounded
and then live to return felt repaid
for all they suffered In the adoration
of their friends. The heroes of San
Juan and El Caney were not more ad
mired in the East than were the
wearers of honorable scars received at
Manila, at the Presidio yesterday. All
of the wounded are getting- along nice
ly, and of the fifteen who returned
all have so far recovered as to be out
of danger, although some of them will
require close attention for some time
to come. The . boys spoke of their
wounds as little scratches and the
majority of them are superficial, but
there are some who will never know
perfect health and freedom from pain
again as long as they live. The follow
ing is a list of those soldiers who were
shot and a description of their wounds.
The majority of these were wounded in
the battle of August 13, when the as

The Balloon Ascension Yesterday
Was a Complete Success.
A horde of hoodlums made Rome howl
at Glen Park yesterday. As a result sev
eral of them are registered at the Central
Station, and they are not likely to repeat
their actions. The racket started by the
refusal of a couple of fellows to pay for
drinks they had ordered, whereupon the
bartender called a special policeman and
he placed them under arrest. A gang of
\ their pals Interfered, and the fracas soon
I spread to many parts of the grounds. A
j message was sent to the Central Station
! and several officers were Immediately dis
j patched to the scene, but everything had
! quieted down before they arrived.
The balloon ascension made by Profes
sor F. P. Hagel was a complete success In
every particular. The balloon soared to
the dizzy height of 5000 feet from the
professor cut the parachute loose, and
he landed within 200 feet from the point
of ascension. The large crowds could
hardly be handled by the railway com
panies, and the terminus of the San Fran
cisco and San Mateo Company will be
changed to the park entrance instead of
at the junction of Thirtieth and San Jose
avenue. Next Sunday a stage will be

Both are deft and" handy with their wea

will be used as a cafe, will be opened for
the first time. It is capable of seating

were brought in and cared for is most
interesting. He says:
"As fast as a man fell he was bun
dled into a carametta, which is a small
two-wheeled cart, generally drawn by
a pony much smaller than the cart.
The wounded soldiers were placed in
these without much regard for their
ease or comfort. A guard escorted
the cart to the hospital, and the pony
was always driven by a native. Aa
soon as the hospital was reached the
native backed the cart up to the door
and the man was taken into the op
erating room. At first it was awful,
but finally I grew accustomed to the
sight of men torn and mangled. Their
cries were heartrending until they
were got under the influence of chloro
form. The physicians operated upon
the soldiers just as rapidly as possible.
Frequently at night the last sound I
would hear would be the groans of
some poor fellow, and it would be the
first sound that fell upon my ears in
the morning. I became accustomed to
the sight of seeing men die and be car
ried out for burial. When a soldier
was dead they would sew him up in a
sack and take him out. Then a detail
would come for him, and th.it was the
end of it all. It was horrible, but
finally I came to look upon death just
as one looks upon any other thing in
life and these daily occurrences made
no impression upon me."

pearance of logs that have been hol
lowed out, while the head and foot
of the casket have a convex shape.
These bodies were embalmed at Na
gasaki by Japanese and were placed in
the caskets. Yesterday when one of
the bodies was called for Major Mat
thews found himself in a predicament.
The names of both men were upon the
caskets, but they were written in Jap
anese. The major declared that he had
forgotten all the Japanese he had
learned at school and no one was
found who could interpret the names.
The question, and it wÂ»s a serious one,
was which was which. It would not
do to send Shuter's remains to Ord
way's friends, and vice versa. There
was as far as could be seen, no dis
tinguishing mark of identification, and
Major Matthews was at his wit's end,
when one of the hospital stewards
found upon the bottom of the casket,
written with a pencil. In a small hand,
the names of the men. But for this
piece of good luck the caskets would
have had to have been opened before
the men could have been identified.

CERGEANT GEORGE "W. SMALL,
0 Company L, First Colorado, had
an experience during the night at
tack of July 31 that will remain green
in his memory for some time to come.
He describes it as follows:
"I was in charge of the outpost sen
tries that night. It was my duty to
post the sentries. With the relief I ,
was sitting in front of the fire think
ing of home when the firing com- '
menced and the fcullets began to sing
all around us. The small branches
that were cut away by them fell like |
rain. One of the sentries came in and
wanted to know if he could not He '
down as the Mausers were too thick '
for comfort. He said he could see (
just as well and he thought perhaps .
a little better. I told him yes, and <
he went back to his post and threw ,
himself upon the ground. Just then
a bullet ripped up the earth beneath i
his leg and one whizzed by my ear.
1 told the boys I thought it was get
ting too warm by the fire, and that i
we had better get behind trees and
cool off. I saw no use in uselessly '
exposing myself and men, especially |
as we were not in the fight and could
not see from where the bullets were (
coming. I felt rather frightened, and ,
during it all I had to leave that tree
and go out and post my relief. I shall I
never forget my sensations upon that .

Doings of the

THE Utah Troop of Cavalry, which
has been doing duty In the
Yosemite, has been ordered to the
Presidio.
The funeral of Private Deutchen,
Battery I. Third Artillery, who died
at the post hospital of typhoid fever,
took place yesterday afternoon.
Private James N. Mcadors of the
Eighth California, who was recently
acquitted of the murder of Private
Try of the same regiment, has been
arrested and -confined at the Presidio.
He will now have to appear before
a military tribunal to answer the
charge of conduct prejudicial to good
order and military discipline. He can
not be tried for murder again.
The Indiana will sail this week. It
is now expected that the Pennsyl
vania will get away before the Ohio,
as the latter has required much more
repairing than was at first thought
she would.
Private Charles P. Tuthill of the
Corps of Engineers, who was returned
as insane, is thought by Major Mat
thews to be only shamming insanity.
The man talks intelligently and there
Is nothing about him to indicate that
he is mentally unbalanced. He was
tried for conniving with the insur
gents and was convicted and sen
tenced to be shot, and it is said that
he escaped upon the groginds of in
sanity. The man has only fourteeen
more days to serve.

ous Mob, and Demand Back
Salaries.
HAVANA, Oct. 23.â Another demon
stration of the displeasure of the city
officials at ..Â»e non-payment of arrears of
salary took place yesterday, when about
200 entered the City Hall, a clamorous
mob, and demanded payment.
The regular guard being unable to dis
perse the orowd, and fearing to take
drastic measures, the civil Governor was
advised of the situation. He appeared on
the scene, addressed the crowd and or
dered immediate dispersal under a threat
of loss of positions In the municipal ser

sired effect, but unless back salaries are
paid there will be more serious trouble.

of" Cornfield, by the tug's hawser part- j
ing. Soon after the Admiral sprang a
leak and collided with the second barge.
The men on the Admiral were lost, but |
the crew of the Scully, by means of a :
line, rescued seven men. two women and
ii baby frum the other barges. The res
cued were taken aboard the tug and the
woman with the baby was dragged
through the heavy sea apparently little
the worse for her experience.
About 9 o'clock this morning an un
known schooner off shore was wrecked in
the gale and those aboard drowned. The ,
accident w:is witnessed by several per- j
sons at Goshen, but up to to-night there j
had been no wreckage washed ashore |
that would give any clew to the iden- j
tity of the schooner. The craft was a ;
good-sized one.
CHIPPEWAS LOYAL
TO THE GOVERNMENT
Unique Assurance Received at the
Indian Bureau From a Law-
Abiding Band.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â The following
unique assurance of loyalty to the Gov
ernment has been received at the Indian
Bureau from the Grand Marias band of
Chippewas of Minnesota:
The Great Father: The Grand Marais band
of Chlppewa Indians of Minnesota are in coun
cil this evening, October 15, 1898. We wish to
say to you that our forefathers for many gen
erations have lived here in the eastern part of
the State of Minnesota, when there were a
great many Indiana, and we have never heard
of them committing any wrong against any
white man or the Government up to this time.
The reason we say this to you Is that we hear
of those foolish Indians at Bear Island. Leech
Lake of the wrongdoing and the mistake they
have made in fighting the Government. And
we also hear of what Chief Bug-Ah-Mah-Ge-
Shig said when, holding up his right hand to
heaven, he declared that all the Chippewas of
Minnesota were backing him. When we heard
of this remark that he had made we did nnt
like It. We are n<>w living in peace and hope
that we will continue to live so. We are Chris
tians and live up to the rules of our church.
The Bible tells us In the fifth commandment:
"Thou shalt not kill," and how could we wrong
our neighbors?
We say now, as Indians living in the eaet
of Minnesota, that we don't approve of what
the Bear Island Indians are doing and do not
propose to help them or encourage them.
On behalf of the council.^ CARinoo
J' iIIN M< MiIUSON,

A COSMOPOLITAN CITY.
"The cosmopolitan character of Mexico
City was never so forcibly Impressed
upon my mind as it was to-night," said
a commercial traveler at the Grand Ho
tel la6t night. "I. went into the res
taurant of th's- hotel to take my dinner
and In the two or three dozen people
that were sitting about the tables I no
ticed that nearly every one of them rep
resented a different nationality. It was
an easy matter to pick out the citizens
of different countries. I noticed an Eng
lishman, Frenchmen, Germans, Ameri
cans, Mexicans and Spaniards while we
were waited on at our table by a negro.
This makes about seven distinct nation
alities, the largest I have ever seen
thrown together in onÂ© dining-room. I
have often noticed the number of for
eigners who are coming to Mexico, and
I nave no doubt that a walk down San
Francisco street will result In one see
ing more nations represented than In a
walk the same distance in any other city
in the world."

THE DAKLANDS
EASILY DEFEAT
THE FLORISTS
Good Game Witnessed
by Hundreds.
O'NEIL AND RUSSELL SHINE
THEY BOTH DO MOST BRILLIANT
WORK.
How the Great National Game Fared
at the Hands of the Playesr in
at the Hands of the Players in
Cities.
By Joe Corbett.
An immense crowd, almost the equal of
that which turned out to see the Gilt
Edges play on Sunday last, assembled at
Recreation Park yesterday afternoon, and
saw tho Oaklands defeat the "Florists"
of San Jose by the score of 6 to 1.
They also, necessarily, saw one of the
best games the Oaklands ever played, and
this, by the way, is a something not seen
every day. The fans were, therefore,
given an unusual treat, and outside of
this, Tip O'Nell, that erstwhile and reli
able, gave them an illustration of how he
can play the national game when things
come his way and the fates are generous.
It was a great day for the Oaklands and
It was also a great day for the only Tip.
The team played most steadily; Tip,
well, he jvas the bright, particular star
of his own side and the game. Pickups and
assisting in double plays were his speci
alty, and the neatness with which he exe
cuted those plays is deserving of great
commendation. If I had the space I
should speak more glowingly of his beau
tiful work, but there are other times,
rest assured.
The Oaklands won the game through
Russell's great pitching and steady play-
Ing by his cohorts, which at times bor
dered on the magnificent.
They found Pitcher Thomas quite easy
at the proper time, and batted him ac
cordingly, sending in enough runs to win.
The "Florists" had many opportunities
to score, having two men on bases with
no one out at three different times, but
Foor playing at bat lost them runs, and
felt at one stage, the game. It turned
out, however, that Russell was entirely
too steady, and when hits meant runs he
could not be found.
All told it was an interesting contest
well deserving of the large patronage.
The San Joses developed a weakness at
the bat that will bear investigation. The
score follows:

A Game for Gilt Edges.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 23.â Gilt
Edges won from the Athletics to-day by I
a score of 6 to 2 in one of the slowest and
most tedious games ever played hero by
league teams. Except for Shanahan's
good work in the field there was no re
deeming feature. The crowd took excep
tion to the rulings of Umpire Hughey
Smith and made life miserable for him.
Smith erred on one decision in the first i
inning, by which a score was tallied for ;
the Athletics, and the crowd never forgot |
nor forgave. Toward the end of the game j
he became somewhat erratic owing to the .
insultÃ cast at him. After the game and !
while coming downtown on a street car |
he was obliged to demand protection from
the crowd at the hands of the police.

make much of a stand against the Pacific
bowlers. Sewell's underhand balls proving
particularly fatal to them. C. K. Turner,
17, and W. B. Paul, 10, were the only bats
men who obtained double figures. The
innings closed for SS, Sewell having taken
8 wickets in 80 balls for 44 runs. C. P.
Coles captured the other two wickets at
a cost of 10 runs. The match was thus

PEACE JUBILEE
Opens With Prayer and
Songr.
ALL THE CHURCHES IN LINE
PBELTTDE TO THREE DAYS OF
FESTIVITY.
Quaker City Beautifully Decorated
and an Elaborate Programme
Arrang-ed for the Joyous
Occasion,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 23.â The
peace jubilee be~an to-day. It fittingly
opened with special services of prayer
and thanksgiving in all the churches
of the city, irrespecti of creed or doc
trine. Sermons were preached on the
Inevitable horrors of war and the con
sequent blessings of victorious peace,
and there were services of song and
worship on these themes. This was the
spiritual inauguration. The material
and spectacular beginning will * be
until Tuesday, and the intervening day
â will be devoted to housing the city's
-vests and perfecting the final details.
Conceived pure*- as a local tribute to
the might of our arms on Bea and land
and the valor of the men who bore
them, the celebration has broadened
into a 1 tional fete of greater magni
tude than any public function in many
years past. In it will participate the
President and 'ie Vice-President of the
United otates with the officers of the
Cabinet; General Miles, General Wheel
er and other military notables; Com
modore Philip, Hobson and other he
roes of the Merrimao and scores of
naval warriors ' lesser fame and the
Governors of many States with their
Etaffs.
In time it will occupy three full days,
c< untl- the actual opening as on
Tuesday. In scope it will embrace an
Imposing greeting to the nation's navy
as represented by the ships which
fought and won as the ships of no other
navy afloat ever fought and won; a
dignified and comprehensive display of
our civic virtues as exemplified by a
procession showing the country's
progress in commerce and art, and a
great military parade of the men
whose endurance and prowess made
possible this festival.
Wednesday will be Civio day. The
President, Vice-President and members
of the Cabinet will arrive in the after
noon. In the evening a reception to the
President and his par.ty will occur.
< m Military day, Thursday, the mili
tary and naval parade will be reviewed
by President McKinlp". and there will
be a reception to the President and dis
tinguished guests at the Academy of
Music. The principal vessels that will
take part in the revi. w are the Texas,
New Orleans, Topeka, Dolphin, Glou
cester, Marblehead, Columbia, Minne
apolis, Vixen, Winslow, Hudson, Oli
vette, Morrill and Algenquin. Many of
the ships are already moored at their
respective - ositions.
The decorations throughout the city
are lavish and beautiful. The piece de
resistance of the procession is the
court of honor, from a stand in the cen
ter of which President McKinley will
look at the parade. It consists of a
â¢succession of white pillars, twelve on
each side of Broad street extending
from Chestnut to Walnut streets. Each
of the columns is surmounted by a
great eagle and globe of shining gold,
â while the four at the ends bear the
legends "San Juan," "El Caney." "Ma
nila" and "Santiago."
In the center of this court the street
is spanned by the magnificent triumphal
arch. This is simple but impressive,
the prevailing: tone being white and
gild. It is elaborately festooned with
flags by day and illuminated by a
beautiful array of incandescent lights
at night. The arch is surmounted by
an enormous figure of Victory mounted
on char-ers.

UNVEILING OF
A PEACE CROSS
Impressive Ceremony at
Washington.
PRESIDENT'S HAPPY SPEECH
THBEE HUNDRED EPISCOPAL
BISHOPS PRESENT.
In Clerical Robes, Accompanied by
Choir Boys, They March, to the
Summit of Mount St.
Albans.
SpeaUl Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28.â -A most im
pressive ceremony in this city was the
unveiling to-day of the peace cross on
the summit of Mount St. Albans, the
site of the new Episcopal cathedral.
This ceremony was in lieu of the laying
of the cornerstone of the edifice, which
"will bÂ« known as the Cathedral of
Sts. Peter and Paul.
President McKinley was present and
delivered a brief address. Many other
distinguished men, including 800
Bishops and other high dignitaries of
the church, were present. They
marched in solemn procession in their
clerical robes, accompanied by choir
boys of the different churches of the
city. An audience of many thousands
was present.
Bishop Satterly delivered the address
of welcome, while the sermon was by
Bishop Doane. The drapery was
dropped from the stone while President
McKinley was speaking.
Mount St. Albans is some distance
from the city proper, but it overlooks
the capital and from its site the many
public buildings, the domes of the
Capitol and Congressional Library and
the Washington monument are plainly
visible. The situation, the surround
ings and a beautiful day combined to
make the scene inspiring and the oc
casion lmpressjve.
The President rose and said: "I ap
preciate the very great privilege given
me to participate with this ancient
church by its Bishops and its laymen
in this new sowing for the Master and
for men. Every undertaking like this
for the promotion of religion and edu
cation is a positive gain to citizen
ship, to country and civilization. And
in this single word I speak I wish for
this sacred enterprise the highest in
fluence and the widest usefulness."
While the President spoke the
drapery of red, white and blue was re
moved, revealing a huge lonian cross,
twenty feet high, cut from a single
stone.
After a chant by the choir. Bishop
Whipple read a special prayer of
thanksgiving for victory.
Bishop Doane in the course of his
sermon safcl: "I am speaking here In
the name of all Americans. The cross
here unveiled stands on a mount which
bears a name holy to all English
speaking people. It overlooks the
capftol of a great nation of free men.
The chief magistrate of our great coun
try has added the dignity of his most
welcome presence. A representative
assembly has gathered. I take It that
there Is here to-day In this assembly
the only union that can exist between
the church and state in this country."
He spoke of the suggestiveness of the
peace cross, the peace which had come
to the nation and which was commem
orated by the cross.
FREAK COMING TO THE
CITY TO CELEBRATE
San Quentin Convict Who Has Not
Spoken Nor Cut His Hair
For Years.
SAN QUENTIN, PRISON, Oct. 23.â E.
J. Cunningham, one of the greatest
freaks ever confined in this institution,
was released and took the train for San
Francisco to-day. Cunningham was in
carcerated for a term of six years for
burglary committed in Orange County.
When he donned the stripes he swore that
he would not speak nor cut his hair un
til the day he was a free man. For five
years the oath was religiously kept, but
about six months ago. under the stress
of great excitement, he uttered a few
words. From that time until his release
to-day not a word has passed his. lips. As
he walked out of the gates and started
for the stage to Greenbrae his hair
measured four feet In length. He talked
volubly when told he was free, and said
he would go to the city, get a hair-cut
and then celebrate.

CLEWS THAT ARE NEGLECTED

THE SUSPECTS.
Finds Them Extremely Nervous and
Contradictory in Their State
mentsâAlibis Will Be
Hard to Prove,
WATSONVILLE, OctJS.â There was
a big .baseball game In this lively little
city to-day, and everybody attended, In
cluding law officers who were Bupposed
to be searching for further evidence
necessary to hold for trial the men who
are believed to be guilty of the at
tempted abduction of the young daugh
ter of Postmaster Osborn.
The fact came to light to-night that
for two days it has been known to the
law officers that there was a witness in
this city who stated on the day after
the arrest that he had seen Romero in
company with a young American in the
neighborhood of Osborn's house, the
two eveningÃ preceding the commission
of the crime, and that he saw them in
the same vicinity late on the night the
girl was carried out of bed from her
home. Nevertheless that witness, Jos
eph Littlejohn, has not been sought for
by the peace officers, notwithstanding
he was on the principal street during
the afternoon to-day.
Littlejohn, who hails from Castro
ville, met' Jose Gomez to-day, to whom
he made the statement regarding Ro
mero, and abused his friend for giv
ing to the officers the private informa
tion imparted. He told Gomez that as
there was no v itness to the declaration
he could not prove that JLittlejohn had
made the statement. The reason of L,it
tlejohn's anger was that he did not
want to be mixed ut> in the case and
possibly get into trouble. It was an
nounced to-night that he would be sub
poenaed and given an opportunity to
tell what he knows under oath.
There has been rather severe criti
cism by citizens of the manner in which
the case has been handled thus far,
as it is feared there will not be suf
ncent evidence to hold the men. Some
of these people are unkind enough to
say that election time is at hand; that
there is a large Spanish vote here, and
that the accused men are Mexican half
castes. This appears to be harsh, and
it would probably be more generous to
say that lack of experience and knowl
edge of the value of clews is responsible
for the conditions. This is illustrated
by the fact that the young American
who is supposed to have furnished the
information regarding the location of
the girl's room is not being looked for,
nor has an effort been made to learn
what man of that description Romero
has been associating with recently.
It was learned this afternoon that
Postmaster Osborn is so anxious about
the outcome of the case that he has
had a private detective at work se
cretly lookir~ up evidence for the past
forty-eight hours. What has been ac
complished Mr. Osborn refuses to state.
"I do not want to be the cause of
punishing an innocent man," said he,
"but it does seem to me that it will be
almost impossible to explain away the
frets that point to the guilt of these
men and I ho->f> there will be some
thing forthcoming to-morrow to
st engthen the case. I am simply do
in my best to get at the truth and mete
out -unishment to the fniilty man or
An interview with the accused men
had to-day by The Call correspondent
diclosed the fact that they are exceed
ingly nervous. Romero, who is a black
visaged Mexican, with a scar on his
right ear that looks as though he had
been slashed with a knife, was the more
self-possessed of the two, but grew
quite nervous when told that the evi
dence against him was strong and was
expected to be much strengthened be
fore the examination to-morrow after
noon. He asserted in a husky voice
that he went to bed in the Cosmopolitan
lodging-house at 10 o'clock that night
and slept till 7 a. m. When asked if he
could prove the allegation he replied
in the negative. He also ueclared that
he had not been in the neighborhood
of the Osborn residence prior to the
night of the crime, but it is stated that
the prosecution expects to produce wit
nesses to prove that he was seen round
there on several occasions. He admit
ted his inability to account for the pres
ence of the sugar factory weight card
in the buggy or for the fact that the
tracks of the vehicle led to the side
walk of the house in which Carnes
lodged. Romero was about to leave the
city when rearrested, but thinks that
was entirely proper.
"I am an innocent man," said he,
"and can prove my former good charac
ter, but I know that it is possible to
railroad an innocent man to prison and
they may do that for me. I think I can
clear myself, though. No, I do not
know anything about Carnes. I never
associated with him except during the
short time we worked together. Now I
won't talk any more; my attorney has
forbidden me to do so."
Romero, in a badly depressed state,
was then locked up.
Carnes, when brought out and ques
tioned, was in a pitiable condition. He
was so nervous that he could neither
stand still nor walk straight and had
much difficulty in finding his voice. He
averred that on the night of the crime
he went to bed at 7 o'clock, but ac
knowledged that he could not establish
the fact. He contradicted his former
statement to Marshal Bridgewater re- i
garding his disposal of the telltale tag. I
In the first instance he said that he had
torn the paper to pieces, and to your
correspondent he declared that he had
simply taken it from his pocket and
thrown it away. Carnes will have diffi
culty in establishing an alibi, as the
landlady of the house where he lodged
was absent on the night of the attempt
ed abduction, and cannot say whether
or not he came in early or late. The
prisoner Is well known In Ventura and
Santa Barbara. The examination will
begin before the committing magistrate
at 2 p. m. to-morrow.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
PASADENA. Oct. SS.â Rain at an
early hour this morning came to the
rescue of the 200 exhausted nre-flghters
In the San Gabriel Mountain range,
back of thlÃ city. The fires had spread
and were raging in different canyons.
In Henniger's Flats, about four miles
beyond Mount Wilson, the biggest
squad of men was working when the
clouds began rolling In at 2 o'clock Sun
day morning. From then till T o'clock
the mists kept drizzling. One crew com
ing down the canyon about daybreak
found an old man, who had become ex
hausted, lying unde a ledge of rocks,
so that the raindrops could fall In his'
mouth. Water and sandwiches revived
him sufficiently to hobble out
Though the fires leap, twist, whirl.
Jump and run for hundreds of feet in
terrific fury, the men have thus far es
caped being caught, though many ad
ventures are reported. One squad, led
by Thomas Banbury, was in the canyon
between Wilson's Peak and Mount
Lowe when a change in the wind sent
the conflagration leaping from forest
to forest, licking up whole acres of
chaparral in a minute, covering all with
smoke and ashes. A fortunate turn in
the wind permitted them to escape, but
one of them, Cliff Rogers, struck a high
gait down the mountains and never
quit running until he got to Pasadena.
Thomas Zachary Is thanking his
lucky stars for a narrow escape. He
was hundreds of feet down a narrow
canyon when he saw a great bowlder
rushing with tremendous velocity down
upon him. With rare presence of mind
he darted under a bushy clump just
In time to see it bound over him in its
resistless force. Many other men have
been bruised, but the Pasadena Red
Cross Society have a raemDer of the
Seventh Regiment Hospital Corps on
the ground to dress all wounds.
Alpine Tavern and the Mount Lowe
Railway property have all been saved.
For a time it looked very dubious when
the flames were darting over the crest
of the ridge above and when hot ashes
were falling among the great pines
around the antique hotel up there, 6000
feet above the sea, but the vigorous
work of the fighters, spurred on by Man
ager J. S. Torrance of the Mount Lowe
Railway, promising the men double
wages to save the property, had its
effect and the picturesque railway and
hotel remain as a delight to all tourists.
Prompt action has also saved the
stately forests and green mountains
around Wilson's Peak and Martin's
Camp. Though the fires are under con
trol and the men are returning patrols
are keeping watch of the smoldering
embers and smaller fires. Unless there
comes more rain danger will not be all
passed for many days yet.
All through this fight Commissioner
Newhall has demonstrated incompe
tency and unfltness for his position. He
is a good man, but should be in a Red
lands Sunday-school rather than at tho
head of a Government attempt to
protect our valuable water sheds. Man
ager Torrance, Harry Wilcox, Ranger
Border, Ranger Thomas and other i
Pasadenans have had to bear the brunt !
of the burden of this fight. Between
3000 and 4000 acres of these forest-cov
ered mountains have been swept bare
by this last fire. The expense has been
heavy because of the Government send
ing many useless men into the moun
tains and by not acting more promptly
on the first alarm.
Professor E. W. Claypool, the Throop
Institute scientist, who has watched
forest fire fighting in EJurope, comes
forward with the statement that the
only way to save the forest is by cut
ting anti-fire paths in and through the
forests, so that the fires are stopped
by these paths before they get under
headway.
TOOK THREE SHOTS AT
GREEK FISHERMEN
Deputy Fish Commissioner Makes a
Display of Authority Off
San Quentin.
SAN RAFAEL,, Oct. 23.â An excited
Deputy Fish Commissioner and a re
volver formed a combination nearly re
sulting in a tragedy yesterday. Three
shots were fired at a number of Greek
fishermen engaged in fishing for sturgeon
off East Brothers 1 lighthouse, north of
San Quentin, two of which pierced the
sail of their little smack. The fishermen
were John George, keeper of the Point
House at San Quentin; John Constan
tine, who lives on ,one of the Marin
Islands, and another person whose name
was not learned.
Just as the string of sturgeon were be
ing hauled into their boat the Fish Com
missioner's launch Quinnat rounded a
promontory, having on board three men
and three ladies. As soon as the launch
was sighted the string was thrown into
the bay and sail hoisted. The sail was
hardly in place when one of the men
rose in the launch and fired. The bullet
pierced the sail, and the unknown fisher*
man became so frightened that he jumped
averboard and swam to land. The launch
grave chase to the smack and two more
3hots were fired. One tore another hole
In the sail, while the last whistled harm
lessly overhead. At the third shot George
wid Constantino threw all their lines I
overboard to destroy evidence, and the
Quinnat desisted from the chase.
It is evident that the men must have
been using "China" lines to catch the
3turgeon or they would have had no rea
ion for destroying the evidence, as plain !
iook-and-line fishing is not illegal. George i
isserts that no warning was given of the |
ntended shots and that nothing could j
lave been done to avoid them. The iden
:ity of the Quinnat passengers could not
De discovered. _

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 23.
There can be no doubt that the present
generation In Alameda County has been
surfeited with "professional" politics.
This fact Is more plainly demonstrated at
each political gathering. It is a cam
paign of distrust, no one being able to
feel any confidence as to how his neigh
bor and friend will vote. This is not con
fined to any one party, but is painfully
general. It is shared by candidates as
well as voters. Party lines have been so
intermingled and there has been so much
coquetting that politics has been lost to
Bight and personality has been substi
tuted. The Republicans are, of course,
united on State and Congressional nomi
nees, but for county 1 offices it is every one
for himself and his ambitions and
schemes. Party honor has been banished
to the winds and many openly declare
they are not bound to vote on party lines.
This is the result of the rule or ruin
policy which has been a feature of local
politics for some years. Whereas, years
ago. it was a novelty to find a scratched
ballot, I venture to predict that two
weeks hence a majority of all the ballots
Cast will not be straight. Not so very
long ago a man was honored for having
been the choice of his party for office and
the prefix "honorable" was something to
be proud of. Now, the sacred word is so
often misapplied that I have heard it fre
auently call forth derision. This is be- I
cause the grand constitutional idea or j
politics in government has been de
baaed by professional office hunters un- ;
til it is simply a business with a party
name for a trade mark. I can conceive ;
of nothing more revolting to a patriot
than for a man to creep on his hands ana
knee? and drivel out such words as -'Lin
coln." 'â¢Jefferson," or "McKinley,* 1 when
his sole ambition is to get his hand in ;
the county treasury and take out a salary
ten times" greater than he deserves or ,
could earn in any legitimate walk of lire. ,
One of the genii of the "union" party
made a great discovery last week. It
â¢was that Supervisor Talcott had spent all
his road district money In the township
where he resides. As the lawmakers
w :e discreet enough to decree that a Su
pervisor, in common with every other dis
trict officer In the State, must reside in
the district which he represents, it is not
easy to see what particular merit there is
In the "discovery" of this fact. Mr. Tal
cott has, we are solemnly informed, spent
large sums of money on the roads "in the
vicinity of his own home." Truly re
markable! Had he done anything else
the grand Jury might have handled him.
Mr. Talcott is not a "colonized Super-
Tne statement made for the purpose of
misrepresenting one of the most honest
Supervisors Alameda County has ever
known, is the greatest compliment he
could desire. Had it been insinuated that
the money spent had not gone "into its
roads," but into some pocket, then Mr.
Talcott might have felt aggrieved. This
would have been too palpable a falsehood,
however for Mr. Talcott's roads are the
delight of every wheelman, teamster
and pedestrian who travels over them.
Since the Democrats have paraded their
weakness by such silly opposition to Mr.
Talcott, his "assurance of election has been
doubly assured. _^
There are hundreds of politicians who
try to create the impression that they are
honest, well knowing that they are not; ,
there are others who believe they are hon- ,
est. and yet others who are honest, but
bo lack judgment that they do nothing
but arouse suspicion. There are a few who
bo conduct themselves that, without any
effort on their part, they force their hear
ers into the belief that they are honest.
Of this latter class is J. V. Webster, the j
San Luis Obispo farmer, who headed the j
populist State ticket in '94. I spent three !
hours with Mr. Webster a few evenings â 
ago and each hour added to my firm con
vfctlon that the two leading articles of his i
creed are truth and sincerity. A man of
mature experience and marked political
views, twenty years ago, he sat as a dele
gate In the constitutional convention and ;
some of the most notable sections of the
State constitution are his work. Now the
whitening head and kindly features and
Intellectual expression at once invite the j
respect and confidence which his speech j
and argument later compel. Mr. Webster j
la out of place in his party to-day. He i
went into the People's party from an
honest motive. He believes its principles
are nearer the practical solution of mod
ern economy and political complications
than those of any other party, and his
greatest regret is that a few "piehunters" j
nave almost wrecked the ship which more
honest men built.
Nothing could be more widely separated
than Maguirelsm and the principles of
Mr. Webster. Mr. Ifaguire'a diatribe of
apology, abuse and self-adulation deliv
ered at the Tabernacle a few weeks ago
left not a single principle for an intelli
gent hearer to ponder over. His speech â
same old .speech delivered everywhere â
simply resolved itself into this: "I'm an
egotistical ass, I know, but put me in a
position where I can make a bigger ass
of myself than I am, and I'll grasp the
opportunity.'
And what does Mr. Webster say of Mr.
Maguirc's issues": "The Governor of
the State has no more authority to regu
late railroad traffic than the man in the
moon. The single tax principles, if en
forced, would quickly place every farm
in the State in the hands of the bankers
and mortgage holders, which would be
more than the corporations would dare to
ask. These are the only two strings to
Mr. Maguire's harp. "What reform does
he stand for? What on earth has he in
common with the People's party?"
Private Meadors showed excellent judg
ment when he chose Alameda County as
a fitting place to practice homicide. Many
other manslayersâ a long list extending
over thirty years â set the precedent for
Meadors. and with two notable excep
tions, all are now alive to tell about It,
â¢Cnlcss nature has come to thoir relief.
Just why Meadors should have killed but
one man instead of wiping out half of
CÂ«mp Barrett is not quite plain. Certain
ly he had nothing to fear from the law
as interpreted by an Alameda County
Jury. The four Judges should get their
panels together and frame a new defini
tion of manslaughter, for it is evident that
there is at present nothing in the statutes
that fits the case. Justice Allen must be
a man of nerve to desire a four-year term
as District Attorney of this county.
People traveling on the street cars In
the country to-day were somewhat sur
prised to see a portion of the trunk of
a tree. For several weeks such a sight
has not been witnessed, but this morn
ing a piece of bark was visible. It was
due to the storm last night, which blew
away one of the candidate's cards. News
that there was a spot available for anoth
er card soon reached the candidates'
headquarters and two hours after day
light. aftÂ«r a keen struggle t^een blll
posters, the tree was.dfaln blotted from
view. STUART W. BOOTH.

English Dog Carries
Off the Honors.
MIND YOUR EYE IS DEFEATED
BETTUra HEAVY ON ALL FAV
ORITES AT OraLZSIDE.
Dogs in Good Condition and the Hares
Exceedingly Fast â Snort-Eridera
Unable to Accomplish
Much.
The coursing at Ingleslde yesterday
touched the highest notch of expectation.
The weather was favorable, the crowd
was there and played their money freely.
As on Saturday, the favorites ha<i the
better of the game and little money was
risked on the shorteiiaers, i,o*An-^ta-.a
ing the odds In some cases were very
high. In the course between Miss Divi
dend and Mind Your Eye, a little money
was droppeu. The bettors clung to Mind
Your Eye, which was favorite, and raised
the odds to a 6 to 1 shot. When the
hounds left the slips the favorite led by
two lengths, and by clever work kept
on the hare. He made a final Jump for
the rabbit, but slipped and lost his bear
ings, and the other hound had the game.
Up to the disastrous slip the dog had
scored eight points while his mate had
none. Some of the sports cursed fate.
In the course between Connemara and
,Patria, the former dog took the first turn
on the outer circle by two lengths, show
ing his extraordinary speed. On the final
between Connemara and Royal Prize, the
bets were 2 to 1 in Connemara's favor.
The best run of the day was between
Hot Stuff and Forget. Its time was 1:55,

Hot Stuff's four. The winners were as

MYSTERY OF A
PAWN TICKET.
An Oakland Woman Thought to Have
Plunged Into the Bay From the
Ferry-Boat Piedmont.
THERE was no rift In the clouds
that hung over the bay when
the Piedmont left the Oakland
mole at 11:43 Saturday night, on
her last trip to this city.
TA'hat wind there was came from
the south; and it was raining- stead
ily â it was. In short, what seafaring
men would- call a dirty night.
It is believed that among- the few
passengers on board was a Mrs.
M. Miller, formerly of 363 Prospect
avenue, Oakland, and it is surmised
that her body is now tossing- to and\
fro on the dark waters of the
bay.
About five minutes before the
Piedmont touched the wharf on this
side, two soldiers on board heard a
cry for help, which they reported
to the police, and in the ladies' toi
let room, on the port side, just
abaft the paddhwneel. was found
a lady's hat, a small handkerchief
and a pocketbook. The hat was of
black velvet, with a wide brim,
BRUTAL CRIME
OF A JEALOUS
WAGON-MAKER
Fiendishly Assaults
His Wife.
USED A WOODEN SLIPPER
THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IS
LIKELY TO DIE,
Ernest Kilian, in a Moment of Rage,
Almost Beats His Bet
ter Half to
Death.
In a moment of frenzy caused by drink
Ernest Kilian, a wagon maker, employed
by Warren & Malley. contractors, last
night almost beat his wife, Annie, to
death with a wooden slipper.
The Kilians live at 123 Eighth street.
Yesterday was Kilian's birthday and In
order to celebrate the occasion he had a
kegr of beer sent to his House. Both he
and his wife partook largely of the foam
ing beverage, until they were almost help
less from its effects.
to the statement of the
woman she staggered into her bedroom
and fell on the bed. A few minutes later
Kllian appeared and asked her to have
another drink.
Without waiting for a reply Kilian !
picked up the wooden slipper and repeat- I
edly struck his helpless victim. Her '
screams attracted the attention of one of !
the inmates of the house, who quickly
summoned Police Officers Flynn and
O'Dea. When they entered the room
they found Kilian and his wife in bed.
She presented a sickening spectacle.
Her face was beaten into an almost un
recognizable mass, and a deep exit In her
heaa showed that her skull was frac
tured. Her body was devoid of clothing.
After hearing from her lips that her
husband was responsible for her condi
tion the officers promptly placed Kilian
under arrest. His unfortunate wife was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
an examination disclosed that she was
fatally injured.
To Dr. Bunneil, who treated her, she
said her husband was jealous of her and
frequently threatened to kill her.
"We were married about eight years
ago," she feebly remarked, "and, al
though I was a faithful wife to him, he
seemed to think that I did not love him.
"I have two children by a former hus
band, and for some reason Kilian has al
ways had an aversion for them. He
wanted me to get rid of them, and be
cause I refused, he treated me most
shamefully. Being anxious to celebrate
his birthday, he ordered a keg of beer
and Invited a number of friends to attend
the festivities. After they had left I
went to my room and laid down on tha
bed. A few minutes later he staggered
Into the room, and â¢with an oath, pro
ceeded to beat me with a wooden slipper.
I pleaded with him not to kill me. but,
despite my entreaties, he continued to
assault me.
"As I was losing consciousness two
police officers appeared and saved me
from being murdered outright. I want
to die and hope that my injuries will
prove fatal. *My second marriage haÂ»
been a. failure, and rather than live with
shaping at the back almost to a
point, and was surmounted on the
left side by a large bunch of black
and white ostrich feathers.
The handkerchief was small and
plain, and bore no distinguishing
mark. There was nothing in the
pocketbook, which was black, but
a pawnticket numbered 11.904, show-
Ing that on Saturday Mrs. Miller had
borrowed $1 25 on a plain gold ring
of the Baldwin Jewelry Company,
948 Market street, this city.
The clerk at the latter establish
ment remembers the loan distinctly,
and says that it was made at about
6 o'clock Saturday afternoon the
lady giving the name and address
of Mrs. M. Miller, 363 Prospect ave
nue, Oakland. He describes her as
being perhaps 32 years of ago, of
good general appearance, and weigh
ing about 150 pounds. She was well
gloved, and wore a light, fawn
tolored sack.
There was nothing, he says, in her
appearance to Indicate a troubled
condition of mind. Oakland police
officers observed a woman on the
train connecting with the Piedmont
apparently much cast down. On the
sill of the toilet room window marks
of shoes were found, leading to the
assumption that Mrs. Miller, if she
it was. jumped from the sill into
the water. Captain Jones of the
Piedmont is under the impression
that the unfortunate woman made
the passage to Oakland with him
on the 9 p. m. trip.
my present husband again I would pre
fer to be buried under six feet of earth."
Kilian, when locked up in the City
Prison, showed traces of having been oh
a protracted spree. In a maudlin voice
he denied that no had beaten his wife and
asserted that she had been injured by
falling against the bed in the room.
The slipper which Kflian used on his
wife was found in the room. It was be
spattered with blood. The officers took
possession of it and subsequently booked
it as evidence against the prisoner.
Broke His Wife's Arm.
At a late hour last night Margaret Ray
had some trouble with her husband at
their home, 121 Fourth street, and called
him a bum. Her husband, taking excep
tion to the epithet, struck her on the eye.
knocking her down. In the row which en
sued her left arm was fractured. The in
jured woman was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where her arm was treated by
Dr. Bonnell. The husband has not yet
been arrested.

TWO FATAL FALLS
DOWN STAIRWAYS
The falling of two men down different stairways resulted In fractured
skulls for both. One of the men died shortly after his accident, and the
other Is unconscious and the doctors attending him have no hopes for his
recovery.
Eugene Guy, 59 years of age, a glovemaker by occupation, returned
to his home at 441 O'Farrell street about 3 o'clock yesterday morning and
while ascending the stairs to his room, missed his footing and fell. The
noise of the fall awoke his wife, who Immediately summoned Dr. Wefea
burg, but before the physician arrived, the man had died without regain
ing consciousness. The back of his head had struck on a step, resulting in
fracture of the skull.
The Becond accident was to Salvator Pelici, who returned yesterday on
the schooner Buelah from Alaska, where he has been engaged In fishing for
the past six months. Pelici, as soon as he reached shore, went to No. 5
Greenwich street to visit some friends. As he went up the steps he
slipped and fell to the bottom of the stairs. He was taken in an uncon
scious condition to the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Fitzgibbon
found that he had sustained a fractured cheek bone and skull. His In
juries were dressed, but up to a late hour he had not recovered conscious
ness, and the physicians think he has little chance of living. Pelici is a
married man. His wife and a young child reside on a farm, near Black
Diamond Point, In Sacramento County.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1398.
ADMITS THAT
HE MURDERED
JULIA KEELEY
Dan O'Shea Says He
Fired the Shot.
SEVERAL WITNESSES FOUND
WHO HEARD HIM CONFESS TO
THE SHOOTING.
Sister of thÂ» Dead Girl Arrives From
San Joee and Is Almost
Prostrated With,
Grief.
Tortured with remorse, Daniel O'Shea,
the steamboat fireman, who ruthlessly
murdered Miss Julia Keeiey, his sweet
| heart, last Saturday night, presents &
miserable spectacle as ne sits cowering
in a cell at the City Prison.
For a time yesterday O'Shea clung to
the story he originally told about Mlbs
Keeiey going to his room, 1126 Howard
street, Saturday evening about 7 o'clock,
and the two having a lovers' quarrel, dur
ing which the girl seized his revolver that
was lying on the bureau and attempted
to use it; that he grappled with her, and
during the struggle the weapon was dis
charged three times. Finally, however,
the murderer seemed to realize that it
was useless to attempt to deny his guilt
any lunger, and to Detectives T. L. Ryan
and E. M. Owens he admitted that he had
killed the girl without provocation. Af
ter that, O'Shea lapsed into silence and
refused to answer any further questions.
Miss Mary Keeiey, sister of the dead
girl, came up from San Jose yesterday
and was almost prostrated with grief.
She remained by the side of the lifeless
body all day and could not be comforted.
Detectives Kyan and Owens were busy
on the case ail day and gathered much
valuable evidence against O'Shea. The
officers made careful measurements of the
room in which the tragedy occurred, the
hallway at 1126 Howard street, and found
several important witnesses.
Mrs. Margaret Monahan. aunt of the
murdered girl, in whose lodging house the
shooting occurred, made a statement to
them. She said that about 7:30 o'clock
Saturday evening she heard a noise in
O'Shea's room, and going to the door de
manded admittance. O'Shea opened the
door and said: "I have committed mur
der and I want to go and give myself
up." He turned down the gas so Mrs.
Monahan could not see what had occurred
within. She went inside and turned up
the gas and saw her niece lying on the
bed. At the same time O'Shea ran down
stairs. In a short time he returned with
a policeman and Mrs. Monahan heard
him say to the officer: "I have killed
her." The two then carried the body
downstairs into the lower hallway, and
the patrol wagon was summoned.
Miss Mary Barry, a roomer In Mrs.
Monahan's house, also heard the -poise in
O'Shea's room and heard O'Shea call
"Maggie," three timesr Then she heard
three pistol shots and she hastened to
O'Shea s room. O'Shea ran downstairs
and soon returned in company with a
policeman, to whom he remarked: "I shot
her," and handed the officer a pistol.
Miss Rose Cutberk, another roomer In
the house, heard the shots and saw
O'Shea come out of his room and run
downstairs. As he did so she heard him
say: "I have committed murder and they
will put a rope around my neck for it.
I made a pood job of It. I am sorry I
didn't kill myself."
Miss Cutberk's mother says she too
heard O'Shea admit that he killed the
girl.
Andrew Fritz, a drug clerk employed a
few doors from the scene of the murder,
said that between 7 and 8 o'clock Saturday
night O'Shea rushed into the store and
said he wanted to telephone for the
patrol, as a murder had been committed
at 1126 Howard street.
These witnesses, with the letters O'Shea
wrote before the shooting, will make it
almost impossible for him to escape pun
ishment for his crime.
At the Baldwin Hotel, where Miss
Keeiey /was employed, all the attaches
speak In highest terms of her.
ANTI-FRAUD SPIRITUALISTS.
Meeting in Scottish Hall, at Which
Fake Mediums Are Denounced.
An anti-fraud spiritualist meeting was
held in Scottish Hall yesterday afternoon.
There were about 300 people present, the
majority being ladies. Bishop Garrison
presided.
Several speakers, among them Mrs.
Dunham, Mrs. Drynan, Mrs. Huesmann,
Mrs. Ellis and R. S. Stitts, addressed the
m.-eting denouncing fake mediums and
urging the State board to appoint an in
vestigating committee to thoroughly sift
the matter and expose the tricksters and
frauds who were, it was alleged, numer
ous in this city. Mrs. Drynan and Mrs.
Heusmann were particularly bitter in
their denunciation of fakers.
Bishop Garrison and President Norton
of the State board had an altercation the
previous Sunday, during which Garrison
charged Norton with calling him a vile
name. Norton was In the hall yester
day afternoon and wanted the privilege
of being heard, but he was told to hire
a hall for himself. Some unpleasant things
were said about the State board which
roused Norton's Ire.
Estate of Mark Strouse.
The family of the late Mark Strouse re
turn heartfelt thanks to his friends and
the public for the generous patronage and
kindly consideration extended him during
his eighteen years of business life In this
city.
We invite and hope to merit and receive
a continuance of that patronage and good
will, and give assurance that the excel
lent service and good reputation for
which the Bay City Market has so long
been famous will be maintained.
* EMILIE STROUSE.
Thrown From a Car.
Henry Sneath, secretary of the Jersey
Farm Company, was thrown from a
Howard-stret car shortly after 6 o'clock
last evening, as the car was turning the
corner at East and Howard streets. He
was taken to the Harbor Hospital, where
hla injuries were found to consist of
lacerated wounds of the face, his tongue
nearly bit In two and concussion of the
STRUCK A LIVE WIRE.
Narrow Escape From Electrocution of
Policeman Patrick McGee,
POLICE OFFICER PAT McGEE of the Cewtral division nearly lost his
life at an early hour yesterday morning by coming in contact with a
live wire. While patroling his beat McGee discovered a broken elec
tric wire at Turk and Taylor streets. One end was stretched across the
street, making it extremely dangerous for any one to pass by.
Fearing that some belated citizen would become entangled In the deadly
wire, McGee, who, prior to his appointment on the police force worked as
an electrician, started to remove it. Taking his club in his hand he touched
the wire, intending to cast it into the street. With an agonizing shriek
McGee Immediately dropped his club and staggered back several feet. A
citizen who was watching his efforts to remove the wire siezed him. pre
venting him from falling.
The shock was so severe that it was some time before the policeman
was able to speak. With the assistance of a friend he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital. He complained of severe pains in the left leg, and
also the right arm. Subsequently he was removed to his home, where he Is
still confined, unable to do police duty.
In telling his experience McGee said: "I noticed a crowd standing 1 at
Turk and Taylor streets, and, thinking something had happened, I re
paired to the scene. I saw the piece of wire stretched across the side
walk and at once realized that it was charged with electricity.
"After cautioning the crowd against getting too near the wire, I
started to remove it so that some belated citizen would not run afoul of
It. One of the crowd Informed me that the electric light company had
been notified of the dangerous wire, but, being an electrician and
anxious to prevent an accident, I determined to cast it into the street.
"After taking out my club I touched it to the wire and received the
shock from which I am Btill suffering. It seemed to paralyze my
muscles, and for a moment I thought it was all off with me. I was ren
dered speechless, and if my life depended upon it I could not move my
tongue. The force of the shock threw me back several feet, and as I was
about to fall a citizen seized me by the arm and helped me up. I still feel
sore about the legs and arms, and from present indications it will be some
time before I am able to do police duty."
McGee is one of the most popular men In the department, and his es
cape from instant death was a source of extreme gratification to his
fellow officers.
OLYMPIANS
ESTABLISH NEW
CYCLING MARKS
Fuller and Bozio Are
the Heroes.
SPEEDY RIDING AT FLMHURST
MAJORITY OF RECOitDS UP TO
FIVE MILES REDUCED.
Owing to the Absence of Multicycle
Machines Only Unpaced Trials
Were Madeâ The New
Figures.
George P. Fuller and 13. A. Bozio
both added priory to the Olympic Club
Wheelmen yesterday. They continued at
Elmhurst track their assaults upon the
cycling record table and established
some notable figures, especially at the
distances under one mile, which work
was especially delegated to Mr. Fuller.
The Olympians had arranged to send
Fuller for all track records from one to
five miles, but the record breaker, after
a glance at the pacing talent present, de
clined to try for any distance above the
mile. At this juncture Bozio arrived, and
hearing of Fuller's decision, announced
his readiness to go for the longer marks,
although he had undergone no prepara
tion for the severe trial.
Fuller was first upon the track. He
rode a fast half-mile behind a triplet
machine, manned by George Kroetz. Ed
die Kragness and \V. L. Loos. The tim
ers were remiss in their duties and failed
to properly record the performance. Ful
ler next tried to lower the record for the
same distance without assistance from
pacemakers. In this he succeeded admir
ably, capturing en route the TTne-thlrd
mile record. His time for the one-third
mile was :36 3-5 and for the half :57 4-5.
The former cpast record for the half
mile stod at 1:04 2-5, while the one-third
mile was :38 3-5. held by Hardy Downing
of San Jose.
Ivan Treadwell, Bay City Wheelmen,
tried for several records, but was un
successful.
Bozio was the last to "go against the
clock." He looked far from being fit, his
outward appearance not indicating his
ability to go over a long distance of
ground. He decided to try for the rec
ords up to five miles. He started quick
ly, covering the first half mile in 1:01 1-5,
a pace the spectators thought too fast to
be maintained.
He slowed down a trifle before the end
of the first mile, but after that main
tained a steady swing until five miles had
been ridden. His record figures were:
One mile, 2:101-5; two miles, 4:28 1-5; three
miles, 6:53; four miles, 9:18 3-5, and five
miles, 11:42 3-6. The officials in charge of
the trials follows:
Franklin P. Bull, referee and starter;
Herbert D. Clark, C. C. Williams and
Irving C. Orth. judges; Clarence N. Rav
iln, W. A. Terrill and I. Silverberg,
timers.
