TWELVE SPANISH SHIPS
REPORTED DESTROYED
BATTLE SAID TO
HAVE OCCURRED IN
WINDWARD PASSAGE
Story of a Decisive Victory Over Cer
vera's Fleet by the American
War Vessels.
But Confirmation of the Encounter Is Lacking, and
Washington Naval Experts Believe That Samp
son and Schley Will Bottle Up the Enemy's
Fleet at Santiago de Cuba,
CAPE HAYTIEN, May 21.â 1t is rumored h>ere that a naval
battle tooK place yesterday in tbe Windward Passage, off Mole
St. Nicholas. According to the report brought by a passenger
who arrived on a coasting vessel fron) Port de Paix, there
were twelve Spanish war vessels sunK, but only two of ttye
American vessels were disabled. I have been so far unable to
confirn) the rumors.
It is reported here from a vague source tr;at cannonading
was heard off th>e rr)ole to tt)e northward, ceasing at nightfall,
and tt)at the firing was renewed early to-day and continued
until noon.
CALL OFFICE,. RIGGS HOUSE, WASHINGTON, May 2.
The cablegram from Cape Haytien conveying a rumor that in an
engagement off Mole St. Nicholas twelve Spanish ships were destroyed
and two American vessels disabled created some excitement to-night,
and although at this hour (11 P. M.) nothing further has come either to
verify the report or to indicate that such a battle has occurred, it was
given more credence than usually attaches to such rumors because, not
withstanding reports for the past day or two locating Admiral Sampson
at Key West, it has been suspected that not all of his vessels returned
there, but since leaving San Juan and touching at Cape Haytien he has
been lying in wait for the Spaniards in the Windward Passage,
Mole St. Nicholas is very
near Cape Haytien. It is at
the northwestern point of
Hayti on a promontory that
extends westerly into the
Windward Straits and is about
ioo miles from Santiago. 11
such an engagement has oc
curred Admiral Cervera was
steaming north through the
straits, for if he had been re
turning to Spain he 8 would
have sailed easterly or south
easterly from Santiago on a
track over ioo miles south of
Mole St. Nicholas.
The fact that the Key West
correspondents have yes
terday and to-day been mak
ing persistent efforts to pass
the censor and convey to
their papers covert intimations
of important developments
to occur within twenty-four
hours also lends a degree of
probability to the Cape Hay
tien story
When it was reported from
Key West yesterday morning
that Sampson's and Schley's
Fquadrons had effected a
juncture at Key West the
naval strategists here made
no denial. Indeed they
seemed to encourage a popu

lar belief that both Sampson
and Schley were there.
To-night a naval offi
cer stated positively his
disbelief in the Cape
Haytien story. "It lacks
plausibility," said he,
"for, in the first place,
there are not twelve
vessels inSpain's squad
ron ; secondly, Admiral
Sampson is not at Mole
St. Nicholas, and, third
ly, we believe the Span
iards are still in Santiago
harbor."
The official spoke as if he
had definite knowledge of
the whereabouts of the two
fleets, and gave The Call cor
respondent to understand
that our swiftest war vessels
under Sampson's command
were steaming as rapidly as
possible to Santiago
The four monitors together with the
blockading vessels are guarding the ap
proach to Havana from Yucatan chan
nel. It is evident that Navy Depart
ment officials do not expect news of a
battle for a day or two, for, assuming
that Sampson's entire fleet was really
at Key West for coal and ammunition
on Friday morning it would lake him
over sixty hours to reach Santiago,
even though he had only fast cruisem
with him. But with battleship* in his
squadron he could not make the trip
in less than eighty hours, steaming at
a speed of ten knots an hour.
It is not ykely that hÂ» could do this, I

SPANISH FLEET
HAS LITTLE FOOD
AND POOR FUEL
For Days Before It Put Into Curacoa
the Crews Had Subsisted on
Beans.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Hayti, May 2!.â Rear-Admiral Osbon arrived here this
morning on the Dutch steamer Prins Frederik Hendrik, from Curacoa, where
he met the Spanish fleet, consisting of the cruisers Viscaya, Infanta Maria
Teresa, Equidabo (presumably the Almirante Oquendo) and Cristobal Colon and
two torpedo-boat destroyers.
The Spanish squadron took on 300 tons of bad coal and 100 tons of pro
visions and left Curacoa on Sunday evening at 6 o'clock. At 10:30 o'clock it
could still be sighted steaming westward.
The ships have little or no coal and scant supplies of provisions. The al
lowance to the men of the ships' crews for five days had been nothing but beans.
The torpedo-boats are almost empty and in such condition that they would be
unable to do much damage.
It is the general belief here that the battleship Oregon has by this time
joined Rear-Admiral Sampson's fleet, enabling him easily to be victorious over
the Spanish fleet.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 21.â A

MILES STANDS
IN THE WAY
OF MERRITT
NEW YORK, May 21.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
In the minds of not a few observant
persons the Philippines at this moment
are the determining factor of a greater
war situation. General Merritt told
me to-day just before the train moved
out of the Pennsylvania station that
from 18,000 to 20,000 was the number of
troops he expected to command. He
said he thought this number would be
sufficient to cope with obstacles in the
way. Â»
General Merritt was accompanied by
his aide-de-camp. Captain T. Bentley
Mott. They expect now to make one
short stop at Chicago.
A feeling at last pervades not only
the departments but better-informed
public men that somebody has blun
dered; that some order has come too
late and that this order may prove to
be with regard to too tardy movement
of the troops to the Philippines. The
opinion is distinct and emphatic in a
suppressed way that our Government
should at once send at least 10.000
troops to Manila to aid Admiral
Dewey.
From a Spanish source telegrams
â¢were received to-day that the public
; and technical opinion in Spain is unan
imous in advising the Government to
send the reserve squadron with a
strong contingent of reserves and ar
tillery to Manila at once. I learned to
day from a source that is to be relied
on that General Merritt has had the
warm co-operation of the President,
who has told him constantly that he
couM have what ho wanted, hut it was
relurtlantly stated to me that no soon
er would General Merritt put in an ap
pearance at the office of the Adjutant
General than he would find all plans
that had been made at the White
House had been set aside by two oth
er elements of which the public has
had hitherto no knowledge â namely,
General Miles and the Secretary of
War.
The Secretary of War Is doing the
best he can, all Bay, and he is on the
best of terms with General Merritt and
his plans. But General Miles is doing
the best he can for Cuba, and undoubt-
edly, according to authentic Informa
tion, grudges everything taken from
the "regulars" and allowed to General
Merritt.
Thus, while General Merritt, it was
thought, would start to the Philippines
with 6000 regulars, it is now thought he
wilT not be able to get more than 4000
regulars. General Miles stands con
stantly in the way, I am told.
General Merritt will not leave San
Francisco until he sees his regulars
at least well aboard. He said this
much this afternoon, but his mind did
not seem to bÂ» dwelling so much upon
the difficulty of getting troops as upon
the difficulties of getting transports. I
asked Captain Mntt if should the delay
continue much longer American forces
would be able to arrive in due season,
and he replied:
"Yes; the Spaniards have 1300 more
miles between them and Manila than
the American forces will have to go
from San Francisco."
I learned to-day from one thoroughly
informed that the regulars would cer
tainly not sail before ten days and the
last of the volunteers will not have
weighed anchor before two weeks.

ARMY OF IMMUNES TO

Six Regiments Will Be Recruited in
Gulf States for the Invasion

NEW YORK. May 21.â A special to
the Tribune from Washington says:
The intention of the War Depart
ment to force the Cuban campaign was
sufficiently indicated by the steps
taken to-day for the ppeody mobiliza
tion and equipment of the immune
regiments authorized by congress last
week. This law, which empowers the
President to authorize an additional
volunteer force not exceeding 10.000 en
listed men, "possessing immunity from
the diseases incidental to tropical cli
mates," will be Immediately put into
effect by the formation of six regi
ments of nearly 1000 men each, to be
recruited in the Gulf States.
The President to-day selected the
colonels of these immune regiments
from among the best officers in the
regular service, and orders will be Is

practice inst Monday afternoon. While
cruising along the north coast of Cuba,
100 miles east of Cardenas light, she
sighted three Spanish gunboats and gave
chase to them. The Spanish vessels were
painted black and were about thf> size of

BERLIN, May 21.â Public attention
In this country has been temporarily
diverted from the war between Spain
and the United States to the significant
speech recently made at Birmingham
by Joseph Chamberlain, the British
Secretary of State for the Colonies. The
bulk of opinion since the text of the
speech has been available corresponds
to the utterance of Prince Bismarck,
which was telegraphed on Wednesday
last, when the former Chancellor was
quoted as saying: "The importance
thereof depends upon whether Mr.
Chamberlain's private opinions are
those of the British Government."
Diplomats say they do not believe
that an Anglo-American alliance is
feasible except, possibly, for purely pa
cific and defensive purposes. They ut
terly repudiate the idea of Germany
joining such an alliance.
The Government is cautious in ex
pressing an opinion on the subject, but
is inclined to be favorable toward Mr.
Chamberlain's declarations.
The Schlesische Zeitung, one of the
leading semi-official papers, says: "It
is a mistake to undervalue a man who
so intimately knows and expresses the
ideas and wishes of his countrymen.
Far from being an expression of Great
Britain's weakness and embarrass
ments, this perhaps must be regarded
as the exposition of a political leader
who is so sure of the strength of his
country that he does not hesitate to
point out weak places."
The Liberal press favors a friend
lier understanding between the two
countries, but even the most favorable
of the papers do not go to the length
of. advocating an alliance with Great
Britain, still less with the United
States.
A notable example of Anglophobia is
furnished by an article in the Tag
liche Rundschau, strongly indorsing
the scheme of the Russian Prince I'eh
tomaskl for an anti-British European
combination for dealing with an Anglo-
American alliance. This paper says:
"The British lion would rather roar
than fight. It sounds well and costs
nothing. But England finds herself
confronted with the question of her
very existence. Consequently \he na
tion of sheep-killers suddenly raises
the cry of 'a kingdom for an alliance.'
and behold an ally appears in the shape
of Brother Jonathan. America, with its
mismash of waste pieces of nationality,
millions of immigrant murderers, Eng
lish tongue and black, red and yellow
skins, suddenly becomes an Anglo-
Saxon race."
The Tagliche Rundschau then pro
ceeds to argue that "money-bag sel
fishness constitutes the basis of the
coming alliance between the Cockney
and the Yankee, and, in order to coun
teract this, Germany must join Rus
sia, thereby also helping to increase
France's anger against England.
Relative to the war between Spain
and the United States much impatience
is manifested in this country over the
alleged dilatoriness of the belligerents.

ability to put a military force in the
field strong enough to overcome the
BLANCO'S DAILY
LYING REPORTS.
Cables That American Warships
Hoisted Spanish Flags, But
Were Routed.
MADRID, May 21.â Captain General
Blanco cables from Havana that
"in order to deceive the garrison at
Guantanamo, the American war ships
hoisted Spanish flags, but were imme
diately recognized and repulsed."
The captain general also reports that
Insurgent bands have been defeated in
the provinces of Matanzas and Havana
and that several insurgents have been
killed.
Prices on the Bourse to-day rose in
expectation of favorable news.
PARIS, May 22.â A dispatch to the
Temps from Madrid says: The Span-
lsh Governor-General denies that the
Cuban leaders have submitted, and
admits that only a few unimportant
leaders have accepted the autonomist
government. Generals Gomez and Gar
cia, the Spanish further admit, have re
jected the offers made to them.
The Temps, during the course of a
war article, observes that "public opin
ion in Spain is beginning to understand
that the armed mediation of neu
trals was never even discussed
practically, a fact which should
be recognized and proclaimed by the
American organs which have been
pleased to ascribe to France a propo
sal to address a threatening note to
the United States supported by a naval
demonstration."
Continuing, the Temps remarks:
"Nevertheless, the Spaniards abandon-
Ing the hope of collective immediate
action cherish another hope and flat
ter themselves with the not very at
tractive idea that we are upon the eve
of a universal conflict in which they
will nn3 allies."
Great indignation Is felt here over
the statement contained in General
Blanco's telegram that the American
warships hoisted the Spanish flag be
fore attacking Guantanamo. The news
papers contain savage attacks on
Americans regarding the alleged action
of the United States vessels.

Spanish or to quickly end the war are
again in the ascendant.
A high German military authority,
in speakiag oÂ£ this matter, said to a
correspondent: "It will ere long be
seen probably to the astonishment of
the Americans that a war of invasion,
even against a power classed in the
third rank, cannot be made with
militia."
The superiority of the American navy
is also again questioned and the failure
of Rear Admiral Sampson's ships to
locate and meet the fleet of Admiral
Cervera is regarded in German naval
circles as a sign of weakness.
Many newspapers comment on the al
leged lack of discipline in the American
fleet and publish stories in connection
therewith.
Count yon Radewltz, the German
Embassador at Madrid, sent a report
this week to the German Foreign Office
on the political situation in Spain. He
expresses the opinion that an outbreak
of the people is a matter of short du
ration, and further Spanish reverses
must launch a revolution.
Although there is yet no real famine
In Germany bread and grain prices are
rising, especially in South Germany,
where the price of bread is 50 per cent
above the rate that prevailed in Janu
ary' last.
The Liberals and Socialists claim that
this condition of affairs is the result
of agrarianism and blame the Govern
ment for not reducing the import duty
on grain.
Some papers urge that maize should
be used largely, but the Socialist press
condemns this and declares that maize
is unhealthful and unfit for human be
ings. -They express the hope that all
German workers will refuse to buy
maize bread.
The speech of Emporer William at
the closing of the Prussian Diet on
Wednesday last, in which he praised
the Prussian State railroad system, has
been sharply criticised on all sides.
Even the semi-official papers say the
speech has met with contradiction and
amazement everywhere.
The Foreign Office incumbents say
they have received no information in
regard to the repeated stories of troub
les in Samoa, and they do not credit
them.
The Prussian Government has Issued
a new decree urging the provincial au
thorities to pay the strictest attention
to the importation of American pork
and other meats, arid citing the al
leged frequent occurrence of trichinosis.
It is pointed out that sixty-four cases
of trichinosis occurred in a single sub
urb of Berlin and that 127 cases have
been discovered within six months in
the district of Stettin.

ORDERED TO REFUSE
CLEARANCE PAPERS.
Port Collectors Will Not Permit the
Departure of Vessels to Aid
Spaniards.
WASHINGTON, May 21.â Secretary
Gage has ordered that clearance papers
be refused for all vessels bound for
ports in the West Indies, Bermuda,
Mexico and Central or South American
port? on the Atlantic coast. This is for
the purpose of cutting off from Cuba
the supplies that might reach that
country in an indirect way from the
United States.
Collectors of all pcrts are moreover
ordered to at once telegraph to Wash
ington full details of all vessels apply
ing for clearance in which there is any
evidence of intended treason, so that
energetic prosecution may be at once
begun. No more permits will be given
to foreign vessels to enter Havana
harbor for any reason whatever, except
that warships will be allowed to enter
for the purpose of bringing away clti
|Zens of their nationality. The Gov.ern
ment wishes as far as possible to cut
off all means of communication be
tween Cuba and the rest of the world.
For the present this prohibition of
clearance papers will apply only to ves
sels loaded with coal.

LONDON. May 21.â A special dispatch from the Barbadoes dated
Friday says: The American battleship Oregon arrived here yesterday.
All well. She took on board 200 tons of coal and sailed to-day. Her
destination is not known here.
According to the above dispatch the battleship Oregon was at the
Barbadoes on Thursday. If she left there the same day and steamed
fourteen knots an hour she could have easily reached St. Thomas on Fri
day, the distance being only 346 miles. The Herald's correspondent at
St. Thomas cabled on Friday: "Important arrival from the north here
at noon to-day." The censor would not have permitted a dispatch
about the Oregon to pass, and it was entirely possible the battleship's
arrival was news he tried to send the Herald, classifying the Oregon
'as "from the north," that is, from the United States. If the Oregon is
maintaining- her usual speed, and the dispatches have located her cor
rectly she should be to-morrow morning passing along the north coast

"cornered" by J. F. McLaughlin, well
known on the Chicago and Toronto
Boards of Trade. He has been here
several weeks in the interest of Chi
cago speculators. Most of the grain
merchants were caught napping, and
a number of them have not a bushel
of oats to sell and cannot get them ex
cepting at fancy prices.
McLaughlin worked quietly. Nearly
every farmer in the province has sold
him, and he has now for future de
livery thousands of bushels. In fact,
he controls the stock here. The price
has advanced $5 a ton, and Jocal mer
chants say it will reach $50 a ten. Be
fore coming here McLaughlin worked
in Manitoba and the Northwest, and
the people he is acting far now con
trol the stock from Winnipeg to the
coast.
The legitimate demand here la very
active and grain merchants expect to
be badly squeezed.
TWO GREAT ACTORS CHAT.
"Think of the time now gone, when
Edwin Booth made his annual visits to
his dear old friend (Joseph Jefferson),"
writes Josephine Robb of " 'Rip Van
Winkle' as he is at home," in the May-
Ladies' Home Journal. "Can you not
see these two, with ail the rest of the
family, sitting around the open fire in
the big dining-room? These two great
artists and dear friends are talking
of days that have gone by â one telling
the story of some unfortunate predica
ment in which he had been placed; the
other speaking of some day when they
had met, and who else was present at
the meeting. And then the history of
some happy time would be told, and it
would be, 'Xed, did you ever think?'
or, 'Joe, will you ever forget?' And so
the conversation would go on, and they
would be boys again. The light from
the bright fire â which was the only
light in the room â shows these two
faces to perfection. One would tell
some old jokes and both would laugh
merrily â so merrily that all the family,
down to the smallest child. Joined in.
Then the tears would glisten in the eyes
of each as the name of some old com
panion was mentioned â some one
whose life had been full of sorrow and
who had gone before, perhaps â who
knows? â to show them the way. The
wonderful profile of Edwin Booth looks
as if it were cut in ivory, while the ex
pressive face of Mr. Jefferson changes
so continually it would never suggest
anything so firm; it is more like wax
â but wax with a soul. There came a
time when the dear friend was there no
more, and none but Mr. Jefferson him
self will know how much he, has been
missed."

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK,
Ga., May 21. â A passenger train on the
Chattanooga, Rome and Southern
Railroad, which left Chattanooga at
8:30 o'clock this morning, ran into the
third section of the military train car
rying the First Missouri Volunteers,
who arrived in Chattanooga last night,
near Rossville, Ga_, killing Private
George M. Walker, Company D, and
painfully injuring A. Maynard Lane,
Company M; Howard Brolaski, Com
pany D, and slightly injuring several
other occupants of both trains. It ap
pears that the passenger train had or
ders to run through to Rossville, and
the second section of the military train
with a portion of the First Missouri,
which was expected to run through to
Rossville, was delayed at a switch a
mile from Rossville on account of the
congested condition of the tracks, just
beyond the wooded curve.
The conductor of the military train
sent back a flagman to warn the pas
senger train, but the flagman did not
go far enough, and the passenger train
came around the curve at the rate of
about twenty miles an hour. The en
gineer did not see the danger signal
until within a short distance of the
military train. He reversed his engine
and put on brakes, but did not have
time to stop his train, which crashed
Into the rear of the military train. The
rear car was a palace horse car, in
which Walker was riding, and waa
completely demolished. Three of the
horses were also killed.
Next was a baggage car In which
Brolaski and Lane were stationed.
This car was badly torn up, but none
of the occupants were seriously hurt-
The wreck was cleared by 1 o'clock
and trains were resumed.
Following are the killed and in
jured: George M. Walker, Company
D, killed; Howard Brolaski, Company
D, left hip injured; Edward Tarans
bury, Company A. multiple contusions,
not serious; A. M. Lane, Company M,
left hip dislocated, not serious; R. D.
Leida, Company H, back sprained and
leg bruised, not serious.
Dr. G. A. Baxter, surgeon of the
Southern railway, was put in charge of
the wounded and had them taken to
St. Vincent's Infirmary of the Catholic
Sisters of Charity, where all were
placed in pleasant surroundings.
Engineer Wheeler and Fireman Han
by of the passenger train were arrest
ed by Lieutenant-Colonel Covends and
taken under guard to the park. They
were afterward turned over to the
civil authorities.
A trial will be held and a judicial in
vestigation ordered.
General Boynton, John Jacob Astor
and a number of other officers were on
the passenger train, but none of them
were hurt. Several passengers were
bruised by being thrown against the
stumps, etc., but none were seriously
injured. The First Missouri after the
accident reached the park without
further incident and was assigned to
camp and placed in the Third Corps.
Other arrivals were the Fifth Mary
land Infantry, twelve companies, 986
men, Colonel L. Dorcey Cole (assigned
to Third Corps); and the Second Ne
braska, twelve companies, 1091 men,
Colonel J. C. Bills.
GERMAN AND AMERICAN SOL
DIERS.
A German savant connected with the
Berlin "War Office has recently pub
lished some interesting statistical
measurements of the rank and file of
the different armies. He writes that
the minimum height from 1840 to 1860
was 1.659 meters, (1 meter equals 39.37
inches). The present measure for the
German army, by a decree of August 3,
1593, has been lowered from 1.57 to 1.54
meters. For the guards, with the ex
ception of light cavalry, the railway
regiment, and the aerostatic battalion,
the measure is 1.70 meters down to 1.67
meters. In the French army the meas
ure has gradually come down from
1.624 meters under Louis XIV, in 1701,
to LSI meters; for the cuirassiers the
standard ranges from 1.85 to 1.70
meters. The minimal measure for the
Italian army is 1.55 meters. In the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy the mini
mum measure in 1858 was 1.578 meters,
but the law of 18S9 reduced it to 1.55
meters. England has the highest mini
mum standard, namely, 1.65 meters; the
majority of the recruits exceed 1.68
meters in height. The Russian mini
mal measure i 51.54 meters; the Swiss,
Belgian and Dutch minimal standard fs
1.55 meters; for the Swedish army, 1.608
meters, and for the army of the United
States 1.619 meters.
There are nearly 270 different reli
gions in the United Kingdom.

Michael Davitt Speaks
Plainly on England's
Attitude.
Declares That Chamberlain Real
izes European Powers Will
Not Ally With Britain.
Copyrighted. IS9B, by Jamea Gordon BennÂ«tt-
LONDON, May 21.â 1 am told that at
the present moment there Is no Irish
man in the House of Commons, or, for
that matter, anywhere else, whose
opinions carry greater weight with his
countrymen than Michael Davitt. I
therefore sought an opportunity to
question him with regard to his an
tagonism to Mr. Chamberlain's idea of
identity of interests of England and
the United States and eventually lead
ing to an alliance of the two countries.
"How do you justify your attitude
in this matter, Mr. Davitt?" I asked.
"Well, in the first place," he replied,
"I do not pretend to speak merely as
an Irishman. All my ties, except that
of birth and my political work, which
belongs to Ireland, are American.
"My only regret is that my two boys
are not old enough to fight for Old
Glory. With reference to the position
Irishmen should take up, I say no
Irishman has a right to ask America
to do anything contrary to American
interests in order to serve Ireland, and
no patriotic Irish-American citizens
ask that she should.
"But I asked Mr. Chamberlain how
he expects seventy million citizens to
exhaust their sympathies solely to
England among various European
countries, from which these seventy
millions sprang, for it Js obvious that
the motherland of America is not Eng
land, but Europe. You have only to
cast a glance at the proportion of the
different nationalities in the United
States in order to realize this.
"Why does Mr. Chamberlain want
this alliance? Manifestly because, as
he candidly confessed at Birmingham,
none of the great European nations
will ally themselves with England.
Now, as a friend of America, I ask,
where does the advantage to America
come in?
"As for the Idea of a coalition of
European powers against America,
that is a farce of the London press, a
pure fabrication, without a word of

STRATEGY
CRITICIZED
Naval Men of prance Say
the Admiral Scored a
Good Point.
But t^e English Naval Expei
Columb, Declares the SpaQish
Blundered fatally.
3Â«cri4s&t*d. I**, by JftmM Gorton Benattt.
PARIS, May 21. â The general
opinion is that Cervera has scored
the first blood in a very skillful
strategical movement. He is safe
In a harbor absolutely impregna
ble, defended by four forts and so
narrow at the entrance that any
attempt to force it would be fool
hardy in the extreme. He is thus
master of the situation. While he
remains there the blockading fleet
must keep in the neighborhood.
He thus renders them useless
should Spain decide to send a re
serve fleet to harass the American
coast.
Naval experts here call atten
tion to Senor de Bernabe's remark
about a heavy blow being struck
before the war is over. The in
dustry with which the report that
a reserve squadron is to be sent to
Manila is teing circulated in
Madrid and other Spanish agencies
arouses suspicion in the minds of
those whose opinion is of the
greatest authority, both on ac
count of their eminent position as
naval authorities and their great
experience. They dwell with em
phasis upon the skillful way in
which Spain has misled public
opinion â as, for example, the j
famous dispatch announcing the j
return to Cadiz of Cervera's \
squadron.
At the present moment Manila
is in every one's mouth. They
say a squadron must be sent to
Manila. Infantry and artillery
must be sent to Manila. The
Spanish navy must avenge the)
defeat in the Philippines before i
Manila itself.
The Herald's Valencia corre-
spondent judiciously observes to
day in this connection that, al
though all preparations and public
announcements point to the Philip
pines as the destination of the
troops being concentrated at
Valencia and any battle-ships
which are to accompany them
from Cadiz, many military and
naval authorities whisper that the
expedition will probably sail in
the opposite direction. At any
rate, it would not be safe to as
sume the expedition is going to
Manila until it has passed through
the Suez Canal. This opinion is
generally held there.
There seems every reason to be
lieve that \he reserve squadron

will try to follow Admiral Cer
vera's tactics. Every one agrees
that these tactics deserve un
stinted admiration. Their incon
trovertible success proves how in
adequate were the measures taken
by the strategical board in Wash
ington to counteract them. It is
possible, then, that the reserve
squadron may effect a conjunction
with Cervera's forces, which, in
the meantime, are quite safe from
persecution, or may descend upon
American coast towns left unde
fended by the enforced stay in the
Antilles of the American fleet,
owing to the necessity of keeping
Admiral Cervera's force shut up
in Santiago Bay.
One point all parties are agreed
upon â that is, Admiral Cervera's
squadron should not again be lost
sight of, now that it has once been
definitely located. This, then, is
the situation. Admiral Cervera
has shown himself a superior strat
i egist to America's admiral. He has
succeeded in entering without dif
ficulty a place of perfect safety.
His presence immobilizes the
blockading squadron, and the re
serve fleet now at Cadiz is left
free to follow out any line of pol- i
icy that seems best to the Spanish
naval authorities.
SAYS CERVERA HAS
MADE A MISTAKE.
Vice-Admiral Columtj Thinks the
Spanish Admiral Has Blun
dered Fatally.
LONDON, ENG., May 21.âAc
cording to the best expert
opinion in London if Admiral
Cervera has gone to Santi
ago de Cuba he has made a fatal
mistake. Vice Admiral Philip
Howard Columb, retired, the au
thor of a number of naval works,
including "The Naval War !
Game," writes that he is con-
vinced the Spanish Admiral is now
unlikely to strike at all. He adds
that if he enters a-south Cuban
port it will scarcely effect the
United States blockade, for Rear
Admiral Sampson will onJy have
to detach a somewhat superior
force of his heavier ships to cover
Cervera's fleet, while a group of
the lightest and swiftest vessels
would be watching to see that he
did not move without being re
ported, and all the rest of Rear
Admiral Sampson's fleet could
devote themselves to the blockade
of the other Cuban ports.
ARE NOW PRAISING
AMERICAN STRATEGY.
Certain Newspapers of Paris Coming
Out Boldly in Favor of
Uncle Sam.
NEW YORK, May 21.-A dispatch
from Paris says: There are remarkable
indications in certain Paris journals
hithertojnimical of a complete reversal
of the French disposition toward
America. Â«
The Gaulois, for example, extols the
cleverness with which Admiral Sampson
! has maneuvered, taking advantage of
' his opponent's slowness to effect a
I junction with Schley and thus enable
him to divide the forces into two parts.
M. Jaures, in the Petite Republique,
; writes in the same strain of America's
"admirable attack and defense, which
, have been directed with energy and
; life."
M. Jaures derides Spain for allowing
herself to be made the sport of clerical
ism and militarism.
There is also a strong article in the
Echo de Paris, signed Henry Beaure,
calling French hostility to her ancient
friends and clients beyond the Atlantic
foolish and illogical. "France," the
writer says, "is naturally drawn to
America as a republic and should not
give way to sudden tenderness for
Spain."

MONTEGRO BAT, via Kingston,
Jamaica, May 21. â A letter received
here yesterday from Santiago de Cuba
under date of May 15 says that Col
onel Castelvi de Bourbon, chief of the
guerrillas In Eastern Cuba, has been
imprisoned for an assault upon a
young Cuban girl. The girl was one
of a family who had fled to Santiago
for protection from the insurgents,
having obtained safe conduct of Ca
prilles. Colonel Castelvi de Bourbon
made advances which the girl indig
nantly rejected. During the night she
was kidnaped, and when an attempt
was made to rescue her in the streets
of Santiago three of her male relatives
were murdered. Colonel Castelvi's
guard at the time were acting under
orders of General Toral, military chief
of Santiago.
A few days before this affair, while
a party of Insurgents were conveying
arms and ammunition to General
Garcia from Santiago, near the vil
lage of Cabre. they saw a flock of vul
tures. On investigation they discov
ered the bodies of twelve persons, all
of them horribly mutilated. Eight of
the women were identified later as a
party which had left Santiago for the
country, owing to the lack of food
supplies. They had been followed by
a band of Castelvi's guerrillas. The
men, after assaulting the women, shot
them.
Colonel Castelvi de Bourbon has been
ordered to trial by the civil Governor.
The military commander is endeavor-
Ing to effect his release. This infor
mation comes from an authentic Cu
ban source.
TWELVE SPANISH
SHIPS REPORTED
DESTROYED
Continued from First Page.
I Spaniards will not think of returning to
i Spain without meeting our ve.^.seis and
hence that if they do not remain :n
I Santiago harbor they will make for
Ctenfuegos with all speed. Jt is true
that Santiago harbor is naturally the
| best fitted for defensive purposes, but
â  as no railroads reach there any gop
i plies landed for Blanco would bÂ» seized
by Garcia's insurgents which now in
fest southeast Cuba. Even if the ex
pedition succeeded in eluding the rebels
these supplies would have to be totaled
three hundred miles overland.
Although Admiral Cervera has been
congratulated upon eluding our ves
sels and entering Santiago harbor, his
mission has not yet been successful,
for he crossed the Atlantic to bring
supplies and ammunition to General
Blanco. For him to now return to
Spain without having either delivered
his goods or engaged our fleets would
be most humiliating to Spain as well
as dangerous to the welfare of the tot
tering Spanish Government.
For these reasons it Is very generally
[ believed that Admiral Sampson will
| either bottle them up in Santiago har
bor or else he or Commodore Schley
will catch them at Cienfuegos.
Censored reports from Key West and
j Tampa bring very little definite infor
| mation concerning the military expedi-
I tion to Cuba, yet being read between
the lines convey covert intimations
| that the troops are soon to embark.
I This agrees with reports from Tampa.
The correspondent at that point, after
wiring that unusual activity prevails
in army circles there, and that Impor
tant developments are expected, con
cludes his dispatch by complaining of
the "rigid censorship" now instituted
by order of General Shafter.
There was also a great commotion In
the War Department to-day. All of
this indicates that the troops are being
made ready for the invasion, which
may occur on any day.
The order sending the coast defense
vessel Monterey to re-enforce Dewey
indicates that Spain's announced inten
tion of sending troops to the Philippines
is no longer discredited by the War and
Navy department officials.
The Navy Department officials are
expecting great events to occur at any
moment. What they most fear is the
effect that might be produced upon our
people by greatly exaggerated and mis
leading reports from Spanish sources
of some great naval engagement if the
Spaniards should claim the victory. It
is realized that the first news of an en
gagement in the neighborhood of Cuba
off to the eastward may reach the
United States through the Spanish
cables via Madrid, and these are al
most certain, no matter what the result
may be, to make a claim of victory for
the Spanish. Obviously the only man
ner now in which the truth could be
discovered would be through our own
officers. _____

WHALERS
SAID TO
BE LOST
Five of the Fleet Are
Reported Crushed.
RUMOR FROM POINT BARROW
MEAGER DETAILS RECEIVED
BY HUME BROTHERS.
News Sent by Their Agent at Kar
luck by Way of Seattle â The
Number of Men in
Peril.
Five whaling 1 vessels are reported
here as having been caught in the Ice
off Point Barrow early In the fall. The
news comes to Hume Bros., the well
known packing-house, from their agent
at Seattle, who Is said to have received
the intelligence from an agent, Charles
Pfaff, at Karluk.
The letter says that few details
have been received. A Norwegian
sailor had brought the news to the ef
fect that the fleet was a total loss. He
also reports the loss of the sealing
schooner Alexandria, which the North
American Commercial Company had
sent with the supplies to the northern
stations.
The Hume Brothers give credit to the
authenticity of the news and attribute
the paucity of details to the belief that
Pfaff had barely time to catch a south
bound vessel.
The latest heard of the whaling fleet
was brought down by Third Mate
Walker of the steamer Orca.
Walker crossed 'in Point Barrow to
Mackenzie River, and brought news up
to November 1 last. At that time 186
whalers were camped near Point Bar
row.
-he steamer Orca had been crushed
in the Ice and the Freeman had been
burned, so that the fleet remaining in
: the ice was composed of the st,*amers
Belvedere and Fearless, the steam
, tender Jeannie, the schooner Rosario
and the bark Wanderer.
All these vessels were fast in the
ice, but Walker declared that there
should be no difficulty in their getting
out as soon as the Ice broke up in the
! spring.
It is thought that the ice must have
broken up suddenly and great floes
crushed the imprisoned vessels before
they could reach clear water.
This disaster places 186 men in great
peril, as, if they did not save the Bton s
from the ships, they may run out of
supplies before the relief expedition,
now on the way from St. Michael, can
reach them.
FACTS ABOUT LAKE SUPERIOR.
Lake Superior, to begin with, is the
largest body of fresh water in the
world. It is water of wonderful pur
ity, which it holds, too; and some time,
, and in the not very distant future,
: either, the people who live in the large
! cities to the west and south will come
to this lake to get the water for their
homes. It will not be so remarkable
I an engineering feat to pipe the water
of this lake, pure and sparkling and
\ fresh from its cold depths, to these cit-
US which art- now struggling with the
question of their water supply and
meeting all sorts of difficulties in their
efforts to get water fit to drink.
All down through this thousand feet
of blue there is a peculiar coldness. At
the very most the temperature varies
through the winter and summer nut
more than 6 degrees. Winter j.nd sum- !
I mer this great lake never changes to â¢
! any appreciable extent, so that if you !
dip your finger tips in the blue sur- j
face on a day in July, or if you test it
some day in the early winter when you
have been out on some belated, ice- i
i mailed fishing smack, or when you
1 have gone out to watch the fishermen
I spearing their supplies through the
thick ice in mid-January y<ru will find
but a trifling difference in the tempera
; ture. Away down at the bottom, too, I
; there is but little variation in the ter- ;
perature, for it stands at nearly 40 de- j
! grees Fahrenheit at the bottom, and i
I varies from 40 to 4G degrees winter and
: summer at the surface. The other
lakes though c>ld are not in this re- |
spect like Superior.
The whole bottom of the lake Is be- I
lieved to be a strong rock basin, though !
'it would seem that there must i
j be great springs at the bottom to help j
! keep up the enormous volume of water. I
i From the north there is a large amount i
! of water pouring into the lake year In
j and year out. the swift-rushing, nar- j
i row-banked Nipigon and other streams
furnishing no small part of the supply.
These streams in a large measure make '
up for the loss on the surface. One of \
the old lake captains, a bronzed, kindly
faced man, who had been for thirty- I
five years on the lakes and had faced |
death many a time in the frightful j
storms which sometimes sweep across
these beautiful bodies of water, told me,
as we were passing along near the
north coast of Superior, with the head
lands and inlets and glossy green bluffs i
of that most picturesque shore in full '
view, that the theory that the lake is
slowly going down in size was true. He :
maintained th; ' he couid tell from cer
tain landmarks along the shores, with
which he is as familiar as he would be
with the strer.ts. of his old Scottish I
birthplace, that the lake was slowly â I
very slowlyâ but surely receding. How- !
ever, it will be some centuries yet be- ;
fore there will be any appreciable less- !
ening of the great lakes, so that we !
need not be concerned.
Strange aj it may seem, the lake 1
has tides, tooâ well-defined tides, dis- j
covered in 1860. It is what is called a
self-registering tide, with a regular ilux j
and reflux wave, caused, so the scien- !
tific men say, by the sun and moon. The j
average rise and fall every twenty-four :
hours is 114-100 of a foot; the maxi- |
mum at new and full moon is 1 28-100 of
a foot.
MAKES IRON DIGESTIBLE.
On account of the difficulty of assim
ilating iron as a medicine, as it gen
erally fatigues the stomach, a French
man has sought to introduce it into the
stomach in a digestible manner by
what he terms ferruginous eggs. Henn
can digest iron easily, while rendering
it back through the albumen of their
eggs in a form which is easily digested
by the weaker stomachs of mankind. A
salt of iron is given to the hens with
grains of wheat. A dozen of these
medicated grains of wheat a day make
the hens, after three or four days, lay
eggs which are very rich in iron al
ready digested.â Philadelphia Record.

Request.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 21.â As a result
of the Call's work in sounding the note
of alarm to the people of Sacramento
in the matter of the prison sewage at
Folsom polluting American River, D.
A. Lindley has addressed the following
report to the Chamber of Commerce:
To the Board of Directors, Sacramento,
Chamber of Commerce â Gentlemen: Pub
lic attention having been called to the
sewage dumped into the American River
at the State Prison, I visited the prison
last Saturday for the purpose of ascer
taining if it would be reasonable to re- :
quest the proper authorities to correct the
evil, William Graham, civil and hydrau
lic fnglnfer at Auburn, met me by ap- i
pnintmput at Folsom and rendered ma
terial and valuable assistance in the in
vestigation.
Our conclusion was that a request to !
abate the nuisance would be entirely
within reason and the problem very sim
ple. We found the evil of considerable
less magnitude than the community had
been led to believe, but, nevertheless, one
which should be abated. We found the ,
prison authorities alive to the situation
and abundantly able to take oare of the
m&tter promptly as soon as funds can be
provided. Thrir efforts to render the evil '
as Innocuous as possible with the present
facilities of disposal are to be commended.
I would suggest fhat a committee be
appointed to wait on the prison directors
at Folsom this coming Saturday to peti
tion them to ask the privilege of the
State Fioard of Examiners to create a de
ficiency of from ten to fifteen thousand
dollars for the purpose of disposing of this
sewage, which can be done either by fll- I
teration, incineration, or on a sewage
farm, as the prison directors may deter
mine.
Prior to visiting" the prison. A. J. Bru
ner.-Secretary (\ilenian anrl myself called
on the State officials here and we have
every reason to believe the request for
a deficiency will be granted. Respectful
ly submitted.
D. A. LINBLET, President.
A committee from the Chamber of
Commerce attended a meeting of the
Board of Prison Directors to-night at
Folsom, and were successful in obtain
ing from the board the request to the
Board of Examiners for a deficiency
sufficient to, erert the necessary plant
at the prison. Thus an abuse of twenty
years' standing ir about to be abated
through the endeavors of The Call.
WOMEN AS ZOOLOGISTS.
The committee for the endowment of
an American woman's table at the zoo
logical station at Naples has succeeded
in the first task set for itself, and is
now securing funds to be applied to the
expenses of the successful candidates.
It is the belief of the committee that
the usefulness of the table will be much
Increased and the appointment of the
best qualified women â irrespective of
their ability to meet the expenses of a
year's residence in Naples â insured if
at leant ten annual subscriptions of $50
each are placed in its hands to be thus
applied. The effort has been made to
obtain subscriptions from the governing
boards of colleges for women, coedu
cational colleges or universities having
;; special endowment for women stu
dents, women's departments of univer
sities for men, or associations for the
furtherance of women's education. The
New York Tribune states that eight of
the colleges and associations represent
ed in the committee have subscribed to
the table: Rryn Mawr, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Radcliffe,
Smith. Vassar, Wellesley, the Associa
tion of Collegiate Alumnae and the
committee on science lessons of the
"Woman's Educational Association of
Boston. The zoological station at Na
ples was founded in 1872 by Professor
Anton Dohrn for the collection of bio
logical material and for the study of
all forms of plant and animal life. Un
der his personal direction the station
has developed into an international in
stitution of vast importance for scien
tific research and for the professional
training of the students of all coun
tries. Contributions to the support of
this Institution have been hitherto in
great part personal tributes to the
genius of the director. It seemed de
sirable that a permanent endowment
be attempted.â Chicago Times-Herald.

REGULARS
START FROM
PORTLAND
Soldiers Just Back From
Alaska Coming to San
Francisco.
Hundreds of Sacramento People
Will Visit the Boys at the
Presidio To-Day.
PORTLAND, May 21.â Two compan
ies of the Fourteenth Infantry left for
Ban Francisco to-night. They came
over to Portland on the steamer Undine
and landed at Ainsworth dock, then
marched directly to the Union depot.
They we*nt south in three tourist cars
attached to the regular Southern Pa
cific train, having also a box car filled
with rough-and-ready rations and com
missary stores.
These two companies were A and G
of the Fourteenth, and were in com
mand of Captain L. S. Uatele, his
officers being Captain F. F. East
man and Lieutenant E. W. Clark. The
command numbered 120 men, and they
were all sturdy soldiers of pretty nearly
perfect physical proportions. Their
belts were filled with cartridges, and
they had all the symptoms of being
ready for business.
These are the soldiers who returned
from Alaska last Wednesday. They
have been up north since February, and
have become inured to hardship, so an
active field campaign has no terrors
for them. This was fully illustrated by
the sight of three of the men stretched
out at full length on the depot platform
with only Oregon fir for spring mat
tresses and their full cartridge belts
doubled up for pillows. They seemed to
be dozing very comfortably, and such
soldiers can sleep anywhere and make
themselves at home under all circum
stances.
SACRAMENTO, May 21.â The excur
sion train which will leave Sacramento
to-morrow morning promises to be not
only one of the largest that has ever
left the city but one of unusual inter
est and " moment. Mothers, wives,
sweethearts and daughters will be the ;
passengers on this journey to the sea, |
where the last farewells are to be given i
to those who are severing the tender
ties of home and family to fight for
their country. Every one who is going |
is on the gui vive of expectancy, be- I
cause their is a meaning to this |
excursion which renders it something
more than an ordinary event.
There are boys at the Presidio who
have never been beyond the watchful
care and solicitude of a mother. There
are boys at the Presidio who are the
only means of family support. There
are boys at the Presidio wh<> may never
come back, and it is for these reasons
that the excursion to-morrow carries
with it a deep and profound signifi
cance.
The train which will carry the excur
sionists will leave at 7 in the morning
and will return in the evening. George
W. Ficks, delegated by the Grand
Army post, will nave charge of the ar
rangements.
Incidental to the purpose of bidding
the boys good by and godspeed there
will be a flag presentation. The cere
monies will be held at 1 p. m. at the ar
tillery camp, where the battery is lo
cated. Those going from here will as
semble at the Palace Hotel at 11
o'clock, whence they will proceed in a
body to the camp. The ceremonies at
tending the flag presentation will be
opened by an address by Mayor Land.
D. A. Lindley, president of the Chamber
of Commerce, will make the presenta
tion speech. Elwood Bruner will recite
an original "Ode to the Flag," and S.
Luke Howe will sing "The Star-Spang
led Banner."
Two trainloads of Utah volunteers
will pass here about 6 o'clock Sunday
morning and will reach San Francisco
about 10. There will be no other ar
rivals during the day, but Sunday night
about thirty carloads of Pennsylvania
troops will reach here en route to San
Francisco.
WASHINGTON, May 21.â Colonel
Russell B. Harrison has submitted a
petition to the War Department asking
that the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth
Indiana be assigned to service in the
Philippines. Senator Teller has pre
sented the request of the Colorado in
fantry to be sent with General Merritt.
He said it was a rugged body of men
and had seen rough service during the
Leadville strike. It is commanded by
Colonel Irving Hale, who graduated in
the West Point class of '82.
CHICAGO, May 21.â A special to the
News from Washington says: It was
said to-day that it will take at least
two weeks before all the re-enforce
ments for Admiral Dewey can start for
Manila.
PRACTICAL TRAINING
IN THE ART OF WAR.
Volunteers at Chiekamauga and at
Tampa Have Settled Down to
Hard Work.
CHATTANOOGA, May 21.â A1l the
regiments in Camp Chickamauga have
settled down to hard work and are
doing practical training in the art of
â¢war. The business-like methods em
ployed by General Brooke will make
the army available for active service
much earlier than many army officers
believed possible.
Supplies of every description con
tinue to pour in. Carload after car
load of provisions arrive, and a vast
amount of clothing and equipage is
being received. The indications are
that the entire army will be equipped
during the next two weeks. Captain
W. K. Wright, assistant quartermas
ter, received notice to-day that 4,500,
000 rations in addition to the first order
had been purchased and are now en
route. Prosper, Lazard & Co. have be
gun work on an immense bakery in
the park. This firm has a contract to
supply the army with 75,000 loaves of
bread daily.
The chaplains of the various regi
ments have started a fight against the
liquor saloons scattered all over the
camp. They have a strong backing,
and the saloo-na will probably be
abolished.
The park army now numbers nearly
35,000 men, and each day adds a few
thousand.
The formation of the first army corps
has been completed.
During the last few days a number of
serious depredations have been com
mitted by the worst elements of the
volunteers. The miscreants have been
so severely punished, however, that no
further trouble is expected.
The Second New York Infantry, 1000
men; Battery A, First Illinois Artillery,
125 men, and file First Missouri Infan
try, 1026 men, arrived last night, and
went into camp in the park this morn
ing.
The formation of the third army
corps was begun to-day. the Fourteenth
New York, Colonel Fred Grant; the
Second New York and the First Mis
souri being assigned to the First Bri
gade. The brigade will be commanded
provisionally by Colonel Grant, who is
the senior colonel in the brigade.
The Second Kansas, which arrived
to-day, will be assigned to the second
brigade. Inspector-General J. C.
Brecklnridge and staff arrived at the
park this morning. General Compton
was to-day transferred to command
the Third Corps.
The commissary department an
nounces its readiness to supply all uni
forms and equipments.
TAMPA, May 21.â Major General
Shafter to-day assumed formal com
mand of the Fifth Army Corps, com
posed of the regular and volunteer
troops stationed at Tampa and vicin
ity. There were no formalities attend
ant upon the transfer of the corps com
mand from General Wade to General
Shafter beyond a short formal order
by the former giving notice of relin
quishment of the command and a sim
ilar order by General Shafter assum
ing charge. General Wade and his
staff leave for Chickamauga to-night.
Unusual activity again prevails in
army circles -fiere and important de
velopments are expected in the near
future. It is impossible to speculate on
their nature on account of the rigid
censorship. W. C. F. .fellers, manager
of the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany at Tampa, was to-day sworn in
as official censor by order of General
Shafter.
WASHINGTON, May 21.â With to
day's arrival 8351 volunteer? are un
der canvas to-night at Camn. Alger,
the mobilization point near Falls
Church. Those now in camp are as
follows: Sixth, Eighth, Twelfth and
Eighteenth Pennsylvania; Seventh and
Eighth Regiments and one battalion of
colored troops fmra Ohio; Sixth Illin
ois; First New Jersey and Sixty-fifth
New York. Thp enthusiasm of the sol
diers was dampened by the first death
to occur in the campâ that of Private
Bloodsoe of Rock Island, 111. He died
of typhoid fever.
JEFFERSON'S BIG FAMILY.
Around "Crow's Nest" Are Clustered
the Summer Homes of His
Children.
Josephine Robb gives a delightful
peep of Joseph Jefferson and his sum
mer home on Buzzards Bay, in the
May Ladies' Home Journal. "In the
houses around Crow's Nest," she
writes, "live Mr. Jefferson's sons.
Charles Jefferson, the eldest son, is a
little farther away from the manor
than the others, but in his pretty cot
tage lives a jolly household, consisting
of his sister, Miss Josephine Jefferson,
and his four danghters. The two elder
girls are married â Margaret to Glen
McDonough, the playwright; Josephine
to Charles Rolfe of Boston. There is
a little cottage close at the left of
Crow's Nest, where Joseph Warren Jef
ferson, with his wife, Blanche, and
their two beautiful babies, make their
home. Both Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Jef
ferson Jr. are members of their father's
company. On the right of ("row's Nest
is the home of Thomas Jefferson, the
second son. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Jef
ferson have four children, and Mr. Jef
ferson is his father's manager. In an
other cozy little cottage lives 'Auntie
Con' (Mr. Jefferson's sister), known to
the social world as Mrs. Jackson, and
to the theater-going public as 'The
Cricket.' At the manor-house at Crow's
Xest the family consists of the master
and mistress, their son Will, who is
21 years old and unmarried, and Frank,
a charming boy of 13, the youngest of
Joseph Jefferson's children. Mr. Jef
ferson's eldest daughter, Margaret,
married the novelist, Benjamin L. Far
jeon, and lives in London.
WON, BUT WALKED HOME.
As the shades of night were closing
out a holiday of more than pleasant
memory there strode across Barnes
rv.mmon, heading for Hammersmith
Bridge, an occasional racegoer with
metaphorical poppies in his hair. And
presently he encountered one who knew
him.
"Hullo, Froggit!" cried this person,
"what's up? Doing it for your liver?"
"No, dear boy." replied Froggit, "I
am making the best of my way home,
and if my boots hold out I reckon to
pass the 'Nag's Head' at Holloway in
about two hours' time."
"And where have you come from?"
"Kempton Park races. I had seventy
pounds to ten about the first winner!"
"Never! Then why are you walk
ing?"
"Oh, ye of simple faith!" exclaimed
Froggit. raising his left boot and tear
ing a fragment of worn leather from
the heel, "there were six races after
that!" â Judy.
HOW HIGH IS YOUR CHAIR?
Some curious experiments have been
made by a Harvard professor to prove
what is really the best height for the
chair you sit on and the desk you
write at. Every person. It appears,
ought to have a chair specially made
to suit his or her height, and the seat
of the chair sho-ukl be exactly, one
quarter of your height from the floor.
Thus, if you are six feet high the chair
seat should be eighteen inches. The
width of the seat should exactly equal
its height, and it should slope back
ward three-quarters of an inch to the
foot. The back should be a trifle higher
than the seat, and sloped slightly, not
too much. Finally, your desk should
be two-thirds as high again as the seat
of your chair. Thus, if your chair seat
is twenty-four inches, the desk should
be forty inches in height. When you
have attended to all these little details
you can sit and write all day without
feeling that backache that comes from
chairs and desks that don't fit you. â

PORTLAND, Or., May 21.â Abel Ug
low, a wealthy Englishman of Dallas,
Polk County, left for San Francisco to
night in the hope of securing the re
lease of his son John, who is enlisted in
the Oregxm volunteers. The boy left
home without the knowledge of his
parents, and after coming to Portland
refused $1000 to return to his home and
promise not to enlist. The parents are
wild with grief and the old gentleman
is determined to bring the boy home
again if it is within the bounds of pos
sibility.
Young Uglow knew that his parents
would oppose his enlistment in the vol
unteers and rather than have a scene
he quietly left home one day last week
and was next heard of In Portland. His
mother left Dallas at once and coming
to Portland found her son at Camp
McKinley, where he was about to en
list in a company with a view of being
attached to the band, as he is an ex
cellent cornet player.
The mother produced a sack contain
ing $500 in gold and offered it to him
if he would leave the camp and go
home with her, promising to add a
second $500 on his arrival at Dallas.
The young man firmly refused the of
fer and after bidding his mother good
by presented himself for examination.
He passed muster and enlisted. Mrs.
Uglow remained in Portland until the
day of departure in the hope that her
boy might be persuaded to change his
mind. He gave no indication of any
such intention, however, and she re
turned to Dallas almost heartbroken.
RAILROADS IN CHINA.
A Missionary's Account of the Diffi-
culties Under Which They' Are
Conducted.
A missionary writing from China to a
friend in this city recently described the
difficulties under which the newly com
pleted railroads are conducted in that
country.
Passengers in the first-class coaches, he
said, exhibited so strong a desire to carry
off various articles from the cars as sou
venirs of their trip that the coaches were
speedily stripped of those things that con
tribute to the comfort of the passenger.
They took away with them hat and bun
dle racks, mirrors, lamp brackets, hooks,
small tables, and even doors. They were
considerate enough to leave the car frame
and wheels. And the purloiners were
Government officials and people belong
ing to the wealthy classes.
The stations along the railroads over
which the writer traveled wt-re rude
Â»heds, rtry unclean and without a chair
or bench. The cars, too, were very dirty.
While this was especially true of the sec
ond-Class coaches, which wore oftentimes
crowded with half-naked, unwashed peo
ple, the first-class coaches also became
very unclean in a short time. It soon be
came necessary to take out all the up
holstery and replace it by plain seats.
When the railroads were being built re
ports were spread that the foreign con
tractors were stealing Chinese children
and burying th^m in the roadbed so as to
propitiate the god who rules over rail
roads. These reports greatly excited the
people, and in one instance a mob n\
tacked two missionaries near Peking and
would have killed them had not a detach
ment of soldiers rescued them. T'nder
guise of these reports children were really
kidnapped and taken into the cities for
immoral purposes.â New York Sun.

GOVERNOR POWERS AND DANIEL
WEBSTER.
Governor Powers of Maine is a handy
sort of an executive to have around.
His offer to be responsible for all the
extraordinary expenses of the State on
account of the mobilization of the
militia means the saving of the expense
of an extra session of the Legislature.
The Maine Governor's generosity dif
fers from that of Daniel Webster, who
offered to pay the national debt, in that
the Governor has the means wherewith
to make good his offer.â Boston Her

NOT PERMITTED
TO TAKE COAL
ST. PIERRE. Martlnque, May 21.â There is nothing to report as to
the movements of the Spanish torpedo boat destroyer Terror and the
hospital ship Alicante, which are still at Fort de France. The Spanish
Consul there yesterday made a desperate attem-t to allow the British
steamer Twickenham to discharge her coal cargo or to supply the Ter
ror and Alicante with coal, but the Government positively refused to
allow this to be done.
It was rumored to-day at Fort de France that the Cape VerdÂ«
squadron from Curacoa would call there for coal.

General Assembly Adopts Resolu
tions Declaring for a Union
of the Two Anglo-Saxon
Nations.
WINONA LAKE, Ind., May 21.âTo
day the Presbyterian General Assem
bly resolved itself Into a patriotic meet
ing. Enthusiasm ran high. Resolu
tions were passed favorable to an An
glo-American alliance and were vo
ciferously cheered. This resolution was
adopted:
That the Presbyterian church in the
United States indorse the wise and patri
otic course pursued by the President in
the conduct of the war and hereby
pledge to him and to the army and
navy, our sympathy, our prayers and our
support.
A supplementary resolution Intro
duced by George F. Pentecost of Yonk
ers. N. V., recognized the sympathetic
expression of fellowship on the part of
the British people in the present crisis,
based upon the solidity of the Anglo-
Saxon race, and expressed the "heart
felt desire that all old animosities here
tofore existing between ourselves and
the mother country be buried under
the new and rising tide of blood kin
ship, and that henceforth the two
great countries may be united in an
indissoluble union that shall make for
universal peace and righteousness.
Dr. Charles Work of Cincinnati pre
sided at the meeting. He said that the
Presbyterian church must be true to
its traditions of liberty.
"One hundred years of freedom are
looking down upon us," he exclaimed
"Loyalty to the Cuban cause is loyalty
to God." . ,- ' ,
A speech was made on behalf of col
ored people by Dr. David Brown, a ne
gro from South Carolina.
Rev. Theodore F. Burnham of Cali
fornia told of the work done on beha.f
of the Ballon in the navy at Mare Isl
and, and as he sat down Dr. Cook
called for "three cheers for the Web
feet and the Jackies all."
One of the features of the afternoon
was a speech of the Rev. J. M. Bar
clay of Detroit, whom Dr. McCook
greeted as a "Johnny Reb." He dwelt
upon the present patriotic ties uniting
North and South, glorying in the fact
that the first blood split in the present
contest was that of the South, and that
it was mingled with Northern blood on
the deck of the Winslow off Cardenas.
SPAIN IN 1800 AND IN 1900.
How Her Great Empire Over Seas
Has Vanished in a Century.
Although the decadence of Spain be
g^an as early as the reigrn of Philip 11,
her American possessions at the begin
ning of this century embraced a large
part of the New World. Truly enough,
Spain's rule over some of the lands
which she called hers was merely nom
inal, but still the fact remains that the
territory then considered to be Spanish
In North America comprised within its
limits what new constitutes Oregon,
California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado,
Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana
and Florida and the Mexican Republic, j
All of Central America, with the excep- j
tion of the little English colony at Be- â 
lize, was Spanishâ Guatemala, Hondu- I
ras, Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicar- |
aqua. The territories which now form j
the republics of Venezuela, Colombia, i
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argen- ,
tina, Uruguay and Paraguayâ that is to ,
say, all of South America, excepting j
Brazil and the small territory known as j
the British, Dutch and FrenC. Guianas
âwere Spanish. In the Antilles Spain
still had Cuba, Porto Rico and the east
ern part of San Domingo. In all. these
territories embraced nearly b.000,000
square miles. .
But it was beyond all human possi
bility that a nation so poor and back
ward as Spain should be able to retain
her vast domain. On January 16, 1801.
the Spanish Governor of San Domingo,
Don Joaquin Garcia, was compelled by
Toussaint Louverture to withdraw
from that island. By the treaty of San
Ildefonso, Louisiana, with all the Span
ish territory to the north on the west- ,
crn side of the Mississippi, vas ceded I
to France. <
In 1819 Florida was sold to the United ,
States for '5,000,000. In 1813 Buenos !
Ayres became an independent country, j
By the battle of Maypu, on April 5 1818.
Chile established her independence. |
Venezuela and Colombia became free ;
on June 24, 1821, by defeating the Span- .
ish at Carabobo. Peru followed on July j
28, 1821, when Lir % was occupied by the j
army of liberation.
Quito, now Eucador, came next, in
1822, and finally, on December 9. 1824, j
the emancipation of the Spanish colo
nies in South America was completed |
by Sucre's victory at Ayacucho. which

CAUGHT HIM NAPPING.
A Novelette in Which a Life Phase
Was to the Fore.
The fair girl clung to him despair
ingly. Her golden tresses swept over
his manly chest, and her blue eyes,
filled with tears, glistened in the dim
gaslight.
"You must not go. Don't go, Regi
nald," she pleaded. His name was
John, but she called him Reginald. "I
don't want you to go." She unclasped
ono hand and began to smooth his
hair. It had always worked before
this, she murmured to herself. "Don't
go. pleasel"
His voice shook, but he was firm.
"Duty calls me. I must go," he said,
huskily, not daring to meet her eyes.
"Oh, you horrid thing, you never
think of me. It's always that horrid,
horrid duty. She looked at him nar
rowly. His glance was directed stern
ly at a still life picture of oranges, fish,
cigarettes and ice water. She made
an effort, and tears welled in her eyes.
"If you go," she choked, "if you go â
I'll â I'll â cry â I'll â cry â so â there."
And she buried her head, with its
mass of golden hair, on his broad
chest, while her shoulders heaved con
vulsively.
What could he do? What could he
say? He looked helplessly at the fair
young girl. Then he faltered. "Don't
cry. Eh I'll do anythingâ l'llâ l
promise â I won't go. Don'tâ"
The mood of the burden in his arms
changed. "You won't go." She stif
fened in his arms. "Why, John Au
gustus Thomas, you horrid, mean thing.
You won't go? You just will go, so
there. Why, Blanche Cresson's fiance,
Bob Somers, is going, and she's just
made him a red, white and blue sofa
pillow to use in camp, and I've started
one for you. and all the girls will laugh
at me if you don't. They'll laugh at
me. Oh, you must go." This time she
was crying in earnest.
An hour later John Augustus
Thomas departed a sadder, wiser
man. He will enlist. And the fair
girl will weep again when he marches
away to the front.â Philadelphia

ANTIOCH, May 21.â An intelligent

old baby near here yesterday. A fam

about half a mile from Tracy. A hun
dred yards from the house water is
kept in a trough for the convenience of
travelers' horses. Yesterday morning
a man and woman were seen to stop
at the troug-h, and, after giving their
horse a drink, drove rapidly away.
Later a drove of hogs came along and
attempted to- go up to the trough to

drink, as was their custom, but the
ranch dog belonging to the Reeds
would not let them go near the trough.
He kept them off for about fifteen
minutes, all the time barking and
fighting viciously.
At last Mr. Reed's attention was at
tracted by the unusual antics of the
dog. He went down to investigate th.?
cause. When he neared the trough he
heard the wail of an infant, and upon
ck.-ser search found, covered by a
quilt, a three weeks' old baby girl.
Had it not been for the intelligent
dog the ravenous hogs would have
made short work of the little one. In
human parents had left the baby there
either to perish or be cared for by
strangers. Officers have secured war

In England the manifestation of feel

English so often talk, does not play

evidence of this fact would be forth
coming by this time in unmistakable
rations, which have not been made
to the present. No single public
man of prominence in English public
lite has yet declared himself on the side
America.
The fact I believe to be that the se
cret sympathy of England, like that of
of 'the monarchies of Europe, is
with Spain. Material interests counsel
them all to go with the liberation of
Cuba but the monarchical sentiment,
which animates them all, makes them
c same time tend toward Spain.

In Ireland the war is regretted for
one reason and for one reason only. I
have more than once referred to the
rations â which are being made by
the Irish at home for the celebration
of the anniversary of '98. A chief part
in that celebration, was to have been
taken by Irish-American pilgrims. it
was fully expected that some thou
pnnds at least of the Irish settled in
the United States would come over this
summer to visit the battlefields of the
insurrection and the graves of the men
who fell in the course of that attempt
to secure the liberation of Ireland. The
greatest and most widespread disap
pointment is now felt at the prospect
of the war defeating the accomplish
ment of this programme, especially as
extensive preparations have been made
in various places for receiving the in
tended visitors. Nor can there be any
doubt that, if the visitors from Amer
ica flock over still, some remarkable
demonstrations will take place, and
that the war will be alluded to in un
mistakable language in the speeches
which will be delivered. In Ireland,
too, no doubt, as I have said, there
Is. a minority which sympathizes with
Spain; but, as I have also said, it is a
very small one. Let me add that out
side the Nationalist masses It consists
of; the Orangemen, whose invariable
tendency is to ally themselves with
any power toward which the majority
of their countrymen 'have a friendly j
feeling. Irish- Americans are their spe- '
cial detestation, and as America is the
'"! n , +l , of th Â° , Irish -Americans they
dislike the American nation alÂ«=o But
they. too. count for nothing in' Eng
land or in Ireland.
We have been engaged all the week
in the. House of Commons in discuss
ing the details of the local government
bill. The. points debated, however
which would be of interest outside Ire
land, have been few. The most nota
ble of them has been that raised by
that clause in the bill which proposes
to give power to the new Irish author

money in relief of exceptional distress.

ous one. The great objection to it is
that It tends to shift from the English
Government a responsibility which is
exclusively its own. English poliry
has alone produced that terrible social
condition in the west of Ireland, from
which a partial famine springs up on
the occasion of every bad harvest Th..
authors of that policy, accordingly,
ought to provide for its consequences.
But if the burden of providing for
those consequences be thrown in the
first instance on the local authorities
in the distressed districts, it is clear
that the chief responsibility will be
shifted from the right shoulders. In
the next place, the plan of making the
counties in which distress exists con
tribute to the necessary relief secures
the surest and quickest way for ren
dering them absolutely bankrupt. They
are too poor to bear such charges. As
things stand they can Just barely get
along. To burden them with, addk

tional charges would be equivalent to
i overwhelming them with a debt which
they could never discharge. Moreover,
it would almost infallibly prevent the
inflow of charity from outside. On
those grounds the proposal of the Gov
ernment was resisted for nearly two
days. It has, however, been carried,
i and for my own part I cannot but an
, ticipate the worst results. The policy
; of the Government seems to be to stick
ito their bill in its present shape. It
i is a ridiculous policy, but it is to be
! hoped, at least, that it will be adhered
Ito when the measure goes to the
i House of Lords, which has never yet
i been called to discuss a measure of re
; form for Ireland that it has not mv
; tilated and all but destroyed.
In connection with this matter it may
be mentioned that Gerald Balfour, the
Chief Secretary, has brought himself
into such odium as he will not soon get
rid of in Ireland. A few days asp he
was being tackled for -the sixth Lor
seventh time about his inadequate
measures for the relief of distress in the
west, and he incautiously let slip a
sentence which: began as follows: "No
doubt if we could give the distressed
people champagne and send them to the
i south of France." "When he had got
so far he was naturally met 'with a
chorus of Irish cries of indignation, and
the remainder of the sentence was lost.
At once it appeared to every one, his
own supporters in Ireland, as if he had
spoken in a remarkably callous style of
a subject which demanded at least a
sympathetic treatment. ' Yesterday '_ he
tried to mend his hand by explaining in
the â  course of the debate on the clause
of the local government bill to which I
have been, alluding that all he meant
was to lay down the general proposition
that champagne and a ; visit to the Con
tinent .would be the best remedy, for the
distress, if It could be adopted,' but that,

such remedies. But this attempt to do |
away with the effect of what he did
say was entirely unsuccessful. The
truth is, I think, that Mr. Balfour is a
man of fretful and impatient: temper,
and in a fit of that temper he allowed
himself to give utterance to a bitter
and callous jest which he afterward re- j
gretted? But the fact that he did give
utterance to ;it remains, ; and I fancy
that as long as he lives he will continue
to hear something about it. After all.
he was not 'so much off the track of
traditional English policy toward Ire
land, and it is ; the feeling that \ such is
the case that makes Irishmen resentful.
It is fortunate for Mr. Balfour that he
governs Ireland in quiet times. In the
stormy days of the Land League and
Parr ell's obstructive, tactics in the
House of Commons he would have been
out ;of '<â  office after ; a few months, : and
so would â ; any ; one who ' was %. not pos
sessed of an Imperturbable temper.

of Commons last night on South Afri
can affairs. It was initiated by the
Liberals, who are incensed or pretend
to be incensed at the reappointment bt
2>\i\ Rhodes to a po-oition on the board
of the Chartered Company, but the at
tack on the Government and on the
Colossus of South Africa was a hollow
one after all, despite appearances.
What the Liberals are at it is difficult
to see. If they carried out their prin
ciples to their logical conclusion they
would surrender Rhodesia to its right
ful owners, the native population; but
they are no more prepared to take that
course than are the Tories, and, there
fore, it would seem that, if they In
tend to keep it, the best thing they can
do is to put at the head of affairs there

HOLIDAY TO HONOR THE SOLDIERS.
1~) EFORE Dewey met and annihilated the fleet of
r^\ the Spanish a great danger threatened California.
* â Had the tide of battle turned the other way no
earthly power could have kept the ships of the foemen
from our coast.
It is fitting that there should be an acknowledgment
of the feeling of gratitude which thrills the people.
But when this peril threatened and there was a call
for volunteers, who made the response? Brave and
gallant boys from every State. In the far East the vol
unteers naturally went toward Cuba, where also there
was need. But in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, in
the wilds of Wyoming, among the valleys of Utah â
everywhere this side of the Missouri â men sprang
to answer the call to arms. They had no fear for their
own, they lived where the menace of no foreign foe
could reach, but they were ready. The honor of the
flag had been assailed. The shadow of the flag is
over all.
Thousands of these soldiers arc here. Let them
know that the sacrifice they made is appreciated, that
the patriotism inspiring them is a common heritage.
Extend to them all courtesies. They have severed
family ties, thrown their prospects to the winds, 'to
battle for their country, for our country. The least
that California can do will be to make a legal holiday
when they shall sail away. Then the schools should
be closed, business suspended and the populace be out
with flags, with music and with cheers to give the
boys a godspeed. Then the national colors should
wave from every building, be worn by every citizen;
the hours devoted to the soldiers. Many an hour and
day and dreary month will they devote to us. Some
will never more see the land of their birth. Let them
know that they go from it with the love of all they
leave behind. There is a long voyage in prospect,
in the far-away Philippines a hostile reception. San
Francisco's farewell must be a time of music and
flowers and cheers. There is no doubt that the Gov
ernor will declare a legal holiday. Nothing less
would be commensurate with the stately solemnity of
an occasion when for the first time in the history of
the nation its defenders will go to a foreign shore,
there to maintain the flag even at the cost of life.
RESPECTFULLY SUGGESTED TO
STREET RAILWAY COMPANIES.
WHILE the soldiers are in this city, honored
visitors from every part of the West, the street
car lines are certain to reap a vast profit.
Thousands of civilians will daily visit the camp
grounds. Does not this fact involve extra profit
enough?
The Call suggests that to grant the soldiers them
selves the privilege of riding free would be but a
gracious act, in keeping with the spirit being dis
played by citizens, merely a tribute to the patriotism
of which the boys in blue are the tokens. The uniform
they wear would be good for a passage over any line
in San Francisco if the companies felt as citizens feel.
No such demand can be made as a right. The plan
is mentioned as one according with the popular sen
timent The corporations could lose nothing in the
end. A course so kindly and considerate would create
toward them a feeling of regard which is in some in
stances absent now.
If the soldiers in after time, telling of their expe
rience here," were to say, "Why, even the street car
lines would not take a nickel from us," it would but
show the world the sentiment existing here. We want
the boys to enjoy themselves, to have the freedom of
the city, and are ready to believe that the street car
companies need no more than this hint to be induced
to practically indorse this suggestion. Our new sol
diers are not rich. Their Uncle Sam has not lured
them into sen-ice by the promise of gain. Men and
women work gladly to add to their comfort. Will
not local corporations add their mite?
If the Cubans join with the Spanish against the
Americans they may be sure that above the stable
government Uncle Sam intends to establish in the
islands there will float a flag of which stars and
stripes are prominent features.
There is no support in law for thumping a man who
reviles the flag, but just at this time the citizen who
does so will probably not be heavily fined.
A Spanish paper remarks that American victories
do not look very big in cold type. Well, in cold
Spanish type they don't.
Anybody who does not like the sort of war news
that is coming has the blessed privilege of
doubting it.
Any Indian tribe which shall seize the present op
portunity for an uprising must be wijjcd out
PATRIOTISM OND CRITICISM.
SOME members of the Seventh Regiment of the
Illinois National Guard who enlisted in the
Volunteer Army are reported to have been so
discontented with the provisions made for their en
campment as to have become quite outspoken in their
complaints. Whereupon, according to the Inter
Ocean, Colonel Marcus Kavanagh said to the whole
regiment: "Any man of the Seventh who doesn't like
the way the War Department does business had better
go back home at once. When once we are enlisted we
will belong to that department for two years, or until
the end of the war. We had best begin to like their
style right off. The men who think they can't learn
to like it should go home, and may God go with
them."
It is scarcely necessary to say the speech was re
ceived with cheering. It put an end to the com
plaints. It silenced the fault-finders in the ranks.
Since then the men of the Seventh Illinois, like their
comrade volunteers of other regiments, have accepted
the War Department provisions with as much cheer
fulness as they will accept its orders to march to
battle, whether the command takes them to Cuba or
to the Philippines. That is the spirit of the American
volunteer. That is the quality which makes him the
sure reliance of the nation in its hour of need and
enables the republic "to meet whatever foe may come
without fear of any lack of loyal hearts and strong
arms to maintain her cause.
This unhesitating readiness on the part of the vol
unteers to accept without complaint the way the War
Department does business imposes upon those in
authority the responsibility of more than ordinary
care in providing for the troops. Where complaints
aÂ»-e permitted it is easy to discover abuses and to trace
the cause of them, but when every man's lip is sealed
by a sense of patriotic devotion it will be difficult for
those in command to find out when things go wrong.
It was for that reason Napoleon encouraged his
veterans to complain to him of the commissary and
quartermaster departments. If his troops were not
well fed or well equipped he wished to know it, and
he owed much of his success in war to the fact that he
did know it whenever it happened, and knew also
how to provide a remedy with promptness and effect.
That the management of the business part of the
war has not been fully efficient is evident from what
is going on under our eyes in San Francisco in the
preparations made for sending troops to Manila. The
Call pointed out yesterday that the arrangements
made for the transport of the volunteers on the City
of Peking were of such a nature as to constitute an
outrage, and that was by no means the only instance
of abuse brought about by blundering or parsimony
on the part of some one in authority.
The volunteers will not complain of these abuses,
but the country will. The hearts of the people are
with the soldier boys. They know that true patriot
ism does not consist in being silent when the brave
men in arms are made to suffer by reason of negli
gence or incompetency on the part of high officials.
They are aware that under such circumstances criti
cism is patriotism, and will apply it with a patriotic
fervor.
0N AUXILIARY NOVAL FORCE.
I N adopting on Friday the House joint resolution
I pioviding for the organization and enrollment of an
* auxiliary naval force the Senate subjected it to an
amendment providing that the enlistment for the
fotce shall not exceed 3000 men. As Rear Admiral
Erben, who has general charge of the coast patrol,
recently estimated that it would require at least 3600
men to properly attend to the work, it appears that
in adopting the amendment the Senators were ani
mated by the old desire for parsimony rather than by
an earnest will to provide our long reach of seaboard
with a suitable guard.
The object of the auxiliary force is to provide the
coast with what naval tacticians call "a second line
of defense." The battle-ships and cruisers form the
outer line, which may be thousands of miles from
the coast, as in the case where Dewey protected the
Pacific seaboard from assaults from Spanish ships by
destroying those ships in the far off harbor of Manila.
The land batteries and forts form the inner line. Be
tween these is the intermediate or second line, which
is maintained by an offshore patrol whose duty is to
operate in conjunction with the coast defenses, keep
the forts andbatteries warned of the approach of hos
tile ships, and pursue and capture any adventurous
cruisers of the enemy that might be found scouting
off the shore.
This work is now being done by a few of our
lighter cruisers in conjunction with such vessels as
the Harvard, the Yale and the St. Louis. The field
of operations, however, is so wide that a further force
h necessary, and the bill now under consideration
aims to establish a corps of men who can be drawn
upon for the work whenever necessary. The naval
auxiliary would probably be made up from the present
naval militia of the various seacoast States just as the
Volunteer Army has been made up of the National
Guard. Such an organization would render the naval
militia more effective, and according to naval experts
the men who compose the militia would be more val
uable for the inner line service than they are likely
to be for manning the heavy sea-going ships.
The importance of the patrol is made evident by
the needs of the coast in the present war with Spain,
and it is easy to see how imperative such needs would
be in a war with a naval power of the first class. It
is therefore to be regretted that the Senate has seen
fit to limit the force to so small a number of men.
The perfection of modern machinery applied to
shipping enables us to construct vessels so fleet that
a small number can patrol a considerable extent of
ocean, and yet it is doubtful if 3000 men could effect
ually keep watch over the whole coast line of this
country on the Atlantic, the Gulf and the Pacific if
the enemy had ships as fleet as our own and were
enterprising and bold in operating them.
Under a Chicago date comes a telegram detailing
"secret information to the War Department." Of
course the information which follows is purely fake,
but it is unusually kind for the papers printing it thus
to brand it.
Pennsylvania's crack regiment will come to San
Francisco. If it is as good as it is reputed to be Mer
ritt ought to feel as gratified ns though he had been
given an equal number of regulars.

range for a European alliance. Sf>ain, appended to
any international combination, would be as useful and
ornamental as a sore thumb.

THE SAX FKAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 22, 1898.
WOULD IT IMPROVE THINGS?
THE main argument relied upon by the pro
moters of the proposed charter is expressed in
the phrase, "Well, the document is an improve
ment upon the present system." This was the burden
of the speeches made at a new charter meeting held
on Friday evening. The same idea runs through all
the literature with which the advocates of the charter
are now Hooding the city. It is not contended that
the instrument is perfect â in fact, some of its defects
are frankly admitted â but it is declared to be an im
provement upon the present system, and on that
ground the people are asked to vote for it.
It may be doubted, however, whether this argu
ment can be maintained. As a general thing it must
be admitted that it is better for the people to endure
the evils with which they are familiar than to fly to
uncertainties which may involve them in expense and
trouble. A sufficient number of legal questions has
already been raised in connection with the proposed
charter to swamp the municipality in litigation. 'I here
is nothing plain nor direct in the instrument. The
tax system will undoubtedly prove a failure. The
street improvement system is a mass of contradiction
and incongruities. All power has been taken from
the legislative branch of the government and lodged
in an official called Mayor. There is no question
whatever that this latter will result in multiplying
abuses without number.
The charter is too long and too complex. It is
not a grant of power, surrounded with restrictions
and capable of easy interpretation, as the organic
law of a city should be. In many respects it conflicts
with general laws, and portions of it will undoubtedly
be declared unconstitutional. An attorney who was
interviewed the other day concerning it expressed the
opinion that more than half of it would be annulled
by the courts.
If all this is trueâ and the charter promoters admit
a portion of it â can it be considered wise to adopt the
proposed instrument? We are willing to concede that
the present charter is about as bad as any that could
be devised. It has been made worse by mingling
general laws with a special law system. But are we
going to benefit ourselves by adopting a charter
which introduces entirely new methods of govern
ment and which is to a great extent experimental?
What reason have we for believing that this city
abounds with men who in the office of Mayor can
be trusted to administer its entire government?
Under the consolidation act for forty years there has
been practically no stealing. Will the individual re
sponsibility system yield a similar result?
It is our opinion that the present is the time to go
slow. Better that a hundred charters should be de
feated than that one calculated to promote corrup
tion and put a premium upon political combination
and extravagance should be adopted.
I~^HE Senators who are pressing financial fads as
amendments to the war revenue bill all take
pains to profess support of the administration in
carrying on the war, while by their acts they are
loading the President with every possible embarrass
ment.
An immense and costly expedition must go to the
Philippines. Vast camps of raw civilians must be
drilled and hardened into soldiers. Cuba must be in
vaded, soon or late, by an army of probably 300,000
men. Anns, ammunition and commissary for these
great masses of men must be provided. All the ex
penses of the Government are increased by the war,
and yet up to this hour Congress has made no finan
cial provision for all this expense since its first vote
of $50,000,000, which was mostly exhausted in getting
a navy together.
The administration is at this moment practically
carrying on a foreign war on credit. Its income is
less than a million a day, and its war outgo alone
is three millions a day. As is always the case m war,
the usual revenues will decline. Imports are less, and
consumption falls off. The people, faced by higher
taxes, are forced into economies. Special taxes must
be provided, located where economy cannot evade
them, and, in the nature of things, these are inade
quate. The administration must have money, and in
its stress Senators profess the intention to support it
and hold up the revenue bill to make speeches to the
country about free coinage and greenbacks! They
might as well be discussing why a dog's nose is cold.
Pretending to support the administration, they op
pose a measure which they know has the administra
tion's support, and they go further, not scrupling to
ascribe vile motives to the framers of the bill.
Rejecting a bond loan at 3 per cent, which would
be taken at a premium on twenty years' maturity,
they substitute for it a one year stock at 3 per cent,
which will not command an equal premium to the
other because of its short maturity. Every one that
thinks sees that this is whipping the devil round a
stump. When the 3-1 loan matures in a year the
treasury will have no money to meet it, and it may
run indefinitely, or finally be funded in a long bond.
But these Senators who are striving to make home
politics while the President is making foreign war
I desire to make capital out of what prejudice can be
created against bondholders. Yet their greenback
i scheme will cost the people more than bonds, and
their 3-1 plan will cost as much as the 3-20 bond.
While they palter and mark time the President,
without a war chest, is using credit to send the great
1 est force that ever left our shores to the support of
! Dewey. 7000 miles away, and is preparing the invasion
and delivery of Cuba.
When these things are done it is highly probable
that the war will have only commenced, and they
may be done before the fiat Senators get done trying
to conjure something out of nothing.
A lady in Soledad believes herself one of the heirs
to a $300,000,000 estate. She is certainly in luck, and
is counseled to get from this belief all the joy there
is in it. Similar beliefs have brought pleasure into
many a humble home, and are worth cherishing so
long as this may be done without advancing any legal
fees.
When the United States Government has interfered
with the partition of China it will listen perhaps with
some degree of patience to Russia's dictum as to the
Philippines. Until then Russia will be granted undis
turbed the boon of attending to its own business.
Evening papers state that the Spanish have made a
"fatal mistake." It is indeed strange how many
mistakes of this sort a Spaniard can make and sur
vive.
When the war !s over the American public will re
member the packet line which sold its ships to Spain,
nor will the people forget to travel by some other
line.
People who declare that the war must be made short,
sharp and decisive forget that there are two sides to
eveo; battle-

Immediately after the death of Rem-
I enyl a lawyer named Kowalsky rushed
I forward with a tender of his services.
There was not much to be done in be
half of the silent musician, little, in
fact, but to take charge of the precious
violins, from one of which the last con
scious act of Remenyi had been to
draw a note of melody. Upon the
more valuable of the two instruments
there had been placed an estimate of
$6000, the other being rated at $1000.
According to my understanding of such
matters, possibly meager, there is a
public official whose duty it is to as
sume temporary control of the prop
erty of a decedent. This official's
name is not Kowalsky. It is far from
easy to discern in the Kowalsky rec
ord anything stamping him as fitted
for a position of trust. Perhaps the
Remenyi violins are worth $7000, but a
fear arises that the violins to emerge
from the tender custody of the legal
gentleman will be worth a different
rigure. To the inexpert one violin looks
much like another. Impelled by no de
sire to reflect upon the Kowalsky char
acter, a character whose luster no sim
ple words could tarnish, but rather,
feeling an impulse to protect the
widow, I would advise her to have the
property of her late husband carefully
inspected before giving a receipt for it
or inditing to Kowalsky a note of
thanks for his tboughtfulness. Per
haps the honest administration of es
tates is Kowalsky's specialty now, but
such $6000 fiddles as I may accumulate
will never get into his hands unless for
the purpose at playing a Joke on un
worthy heirs.

It Is a strange circumstance that the

by the masters of trading vessels, who
are too lazy and too near a state of
treason to try to avoid them. I know
nothing about mines except that they
occasionally blow up and work serious
inconvenience to their environment. It
was natural to suppose that even to
drag them from their moorings would
be a process not devoid of danger. I
hope this supposition is correct and
that the next wanton offender will be
blown so high that his descending
remnants will besprinkle the sea in

There is a Connecticut boy on his

father forbade him to enlist on penalty
of beinp cut off as an heir, a threat
which had an effect in accelerating the
boy's speed in the direction of the re
cruiting office. When the son was mus
tered in the father made good the
threat, whereupon the young soldier
petitioned for the right to change a
name he justly regarded as a dis
grace. Perhaps the old man feels sat

it. There is better blood in the bass

f Mor)terey Ordered
to Join Dewey's
Fleet.
Cruiser Charleston Off Red
RocK 011 Ready to
Sail.
MANY messages passed over the
wires between "Washington and
San Francisco yesterday. It Is
known that General Otis, U. S.
A., wired a plain statement of
facts and received additional Instruc
tions, but the news in this respect was
closely guarded. Last night it was said
that the Peking would not sail in ad
vance of the City of Sydney and Aus
tralia, but that the three vessels would
go as a fleet under proper convoy.
The regiment of Oregon volunteers
now encamped at the Presidio stands
a fine chance of going with the first
expedition. The Call ascertains that
the troops already assigned for the
Manila expedition are the Oregon vol
unteers, the First and Seventh Cali
fornia regiments of volunteers and the
Fourteenth United States Infantry. It
le definitely decided that the Sixth
California and the Washington volun
teers are to remain here for Pacific
Coast defense. The Fifteenth United
States Infantry ordered to this city
will join the expedition to the Philip
pines. The Government will accept
the eight companies of the Sixth Cali
fornia Volunteers as a regimental or
ganization.
The happiest men In San Francisco
yesterday were the crew of the Mon
terey. When the news that the coast
defense monitor had been ordered to
Manila was made known the men for-
I line momentarily and gave
three hearty cheers. It will take about
four days U* coal the Monterey and
get her ready for the long voyage to
the Philippines. As soon as she has
f Hte<l out an immediate start v.- 11l
ade for Honolulu. From the lat
ter port a coal-laden vessel will ac
company the monitor to Manila in or
der to keep her bunkers supplied on
the way.
Tt is said that the Government is ne
gotiating with Koser.feld's Sons for the
charter of the big collier Peter Jebsen.
The latter is now on her way here with
a load of Xanainii! coal, and should
the negotiations be carried to a head
tii- .7fh.Â«en "ill proceed to Honolulu
with her load. Incidentally she and
Monterey mi^ht go down in com
pany.
The Monterey is at present com
manded by Lieutenant Commander
James W. Carlin, a gallant officer, who
esses line executive abilities. If he
is not assigned to the command of the
vessel he will surely hold an impor
tant station aboard the monitor. He is
well acquainted with the Monterey,
and places a high estimate on the fight-
Ing qualities of the vessel. With the
Monterey added to Dewey's fleet and
the guns of Oavite manned by Ameri
can artillerymen Admiral Dewey would
be able to stand off the entire Spanish
navy in Manila harbor. The Monterey
can carry sufficient coal to steam to
Honolulu. Going: directly from this
port it may be necessary to take coal
on th decks, but going from this har
bnr to San Diego and recoaling at the
latter port the run can be made to
Honolulu with ordinary storage of
coal. From Honolulu to Manila the
monitor would require a tow or a col
lier.
Rear Admiral Miller, U. S. N., and
Adjutant General Barrett held a con
ference yesterday in accordance with a
suggestion from the Seceretary of the
Navy. The exchange of views is llkely
to bring the Naval Reserve of Califor
nia into active service. On the part of
California General Barrett tendered to
the admiral six hundred capable re

The news event *ot the day with the
Navy Department was the dispatch of
' the order for the Monterey to proceed
i to Manila to re-enforce Admiral Dew

I tower of strength in herself, and her
addition to Admiral Dewey's force, to
gether with the dispatch of thousands

that the administration has assumed no

formidable monitor In the -world, yet
she combines with the enormous effen
slve and defensive qualities of the mon
itor type a seaworthiness that is al
most phenomenal. The Monterey is
described technically as a barbette tur
ret, low free board monitor of 4000 tons
displacement. She is 256 feet long by
69 feet beam and 14 feet 6 inches deep.
She carries in two turrets, surrounded
by barbettes, two 12-inch and two 10
inch guns, while in her superstructure
between the turrets are mounted six 6
pounders, four 1-pounders and two
Gatlings.
The turrets are 7% inches thick and
surrounding- the barbettes are 14 inches
and llMs inches of steel, and against the
armor all the batteries in Manila might
thunder away without effecting an en
trance.
The Monterey's personnel is 19 offi
cers and 172 men, and once she is In
the entrance of Manila harbor nothing
in the shape of a navy would be likely
to budge her from her position. Her
dispatch may have an important bear

The publication in the Bulletin a few
evenings ago of an uncalled for and un
just criticism of the cruiser Charleston
has brought to the front any number of ;
reliable men who are willing to make oath j
that the vessel is one of the best of her
kind afloat, and that only the best of
material was used in her construction, j
One of these is E. H. Forst, who at the L
time the Hhip was being built was in the f
employ of the Gave rnrnont, and he tested |
every particle of matt-rial that was used.
He declares tliat better material could 1
nut be found than is 'ri the ship. Bfing |

Henry T. Bcotl has received several let-,
tera from the officials at Mare Island j
navy yard relative to the Charleston pit
ting hack after making the start for I
Manila.
One of the officials stated that the bad
condition of the condensers, the cause of I
the return, had been exaggerated. There. '
were only eleven tubes that leaked, six on
the starboard and five on the port side.
These tubes come from the Eaut, as no
work of this kind is done on this coast, j
lof the way to the Philippines. It is
probable that the Monterey will go in
; convoy, and after exhausting the coal
that she takes on in Honolulu she
must either be towed about 2000 miles
of her trip or perform the difficult op
eration of coaling at sea.
CHARLESTON ALL RIGHT.
SOLDIER GUESTS THE LURLINE BATHS.
One gracious courtesy which the soldiers will appreciate has been
extended by the management of the Lurline Baths at Bush and I>ar
kin streets. To-morrow this institution will be open without charge to
the boys wearing the uniform of Uncle Sam. They will need no other
credentials. Suits, towels and the freedom of the place will be theirs.
From 7 in the morning until 10 In the evening they can have full sway.
Naturally, a swim will be a luxury to the boys who have been sleep-
Ing in tents or are still cramped as the effect of long rides across the
country'- Tne Datns ar Â« easily reached by the Larkin or Sutter street
cars, or by a pleasant walk. There Is no doubt but the great pool
will be crowded to-morrow, and it is hoped that officers will not only
partake of the benefits offered, but permit their men more than ordinary
freedom In the matter of leave from camp.
As soon as possible Mr. Scott sent to
the navy yard 3600 new tubes, and after
repairs were made the Charleston had
1000 tubes to spare in case any more leaks
should be found. Mr. Scott says that
there is not likely to be any more trouble
with the machinery of the big cruiser.
Yesterday he received the following let
tor from one of the prominent officers of
the navy yard, which is self-explanatory:
"I have" to acknowledge the receipt of
the condenser tubes. â¢ â¢ â¢ The accom
modation in furnishing these tubes at

the promptness with which they were de
livered enable the Charleston to proceed

delay, and the energy displayed by tie
Union Iron Work merits the highest com
mendation. I thank you In behalf of the

KANSAS AND MINNESOTA
Arrival of Stalwart Troops
From the Middle West.
With the arrival of 3000 more troops
from beyond the Rockies yesterday, 10.000
troops of the Philippine invading army
are now located in this city. They be
gan to come in by thf first boat from
Oakland, and 10:88 a. m. the Last detach
ment was landed at the foot of Market
street. They reached Oakland last even
ing and during the night, so it was merely
a matter of running the trains down the
Mole and marching on the boats in the
morning. This was accomplished as ex
peditiously as the Southern Pacific can
accomplish anything in the way of
transportation it undertakes.
The first to arrive was a battalion of
the Thirteenth Minnesota, the best
equipped regiment that has reached San
Francisco so far, and they are willing
and anxious to match themselves against
the famous Tenth Pennsylvania, which
is on the way here. Early us the hour
â jvas â 'i:3O a. *m.â the ladles of the Red
Cross Society were waiting to receive
them, and as soon as firms were stacked
the men were marched Into the baggage
roum, where they were served with h<>t
coffee, sandwiches and the like in abund
ance.
The next boat brought over the Third
Battalion of the Twentieth Kansas, the
other two battalions having gone into
camp Friday night. These were followed
by the remainder of the Thirteenth Min
nesota, and by 8:"0 o'clock the last of
them had been fed. T^in^ was formed

Volunteers From the Centennial
State Join the Column,
Scarcely had Kansas troops started up
' Market street than the first detachment
of the First Colorado Infantry landed at
the ferry. This regiment is about as well
equipped as the Minnesotan. and every
man is a born fighter. While the First
Battalion was being; cared for by the Red
Cross Society, the Second Battalion,
headquarters and band arrived. They,
too, were amply provided for, and by that
â  time the last of the regiment was on the
dock. By 10: 30 a. m. the regiment was
' ready to go to camp, but its tents were
missing. The baggage came through with
the regiment, and all but the tents was
landed at the ferry. As it threatened to
rain, the officers did not care to expose
their men needlessly, so they were held
at the ferry until nearly 1 o'clock. Final
ly the tents were located at Second and
Townsend streets, having been sent
across on the freightboat. Trucks were
dispatched for them, and the regiment
started for camp. Including; the twenty
six members of the band, the regiment
numbers over 1000 officers and men. The
roster of officers is aa follows:

SIGNIFICANT ORDERS.
Troops Getting Ready to Break
Camp at the Presidio.
It is talk among the volunteers that
to-night will be the last night of the
First Regiment in camp at the Presidio.
The First California, the Oregon regi
ment and twenty-five men each from
Companies A and D of the Heavy Artil
lery, under the command of Captain
Geary, may break camp to-morrow morn-
Ing and sail from San Francisco Monday
night on the City of Peking, the City of
Sydney and the Australia, with the Mon
terey accompanying them as a convoy.
The two detachments from the Heavy
Artillery and Colonel Summers of the
Oregon regiment have been unofficially
informed that they are expected to break
camp to-morrow morning. The official
orders will doubtless be received by
Colonel Summers and Captain Geary to
day.
Colonel Smith, while he has not been of
ficially ordered to do so, expects and is
prepared to go aboard the City of Peking
to-morrow. All day yesterday he was
busy seeing to the hauling of supplies to
the vessel. All company property wa?
removed from camp, and it is known that
the field orders of the First have been
called for.
General Otis all along has been fight
ing to have the three transport vessels
sail together, and ft now looks as if he
had carried his point and that the three
commands named will sail to-morrow
night.
Major Robe of the Fourteenth has re
ceived no orders as yet as to when ho
must leave, but he said yesterday that
he thought his battalion would be or
dered to leave to-day or to-morrow.
It is impossible to get accurate infor
mation from the various commanders, for
they do not seem to know what the Gov
ernment's Intentions are, and the only
fact they are conscious of is that the
FLOWERS FOR THE BRAVE
Decorations Bestowed Lv California,
signal of "On to Manila" may come at
any moment. Colonel Smith held a final
inspection of the regiment yesterday af
ternoon, in heavy marching order.
The band of the Seventh Regiment re
ceived its uniforms yesterday from Gen
eral Barrett, he having made some ar
rangements with General Merriam for is
suing the same.
Private Charles Tripp of Company B,
Heavy Artillery, was knocked down by a
car of the Union-street line yesterday,
and suffered an abrasion of the head. He
was treated by Captain Rottanzi and
sent to his command.
BRING ON SUPPLIES.
More Provisions Needed to
Maintain California's Re
cord for Hospitality.
"More provisions" is the cry sent up by
the Red Cross Society, and the cry must
be heeded by the citizens if they would
retain California's fair reputation for hos
pitality. Troops arrive here after a trip
across the continent In cars that It would
be cruelty to place cattle In. Their field
rations are exhausted, and except for tha
Red Cross Society, they would be com
pelled to march to camp on empty stom
aebs, pitch camp and cook beans and cof
fee before they could break their fast.
More heroic work was never done than
that performed daily by the committee
at the ferry depot, but their labors must
cease unless contributions are sent In and
at once.
Three thousand men were fed yester
day between 6:"0 a. m. and noon, and
a hungrier lot â or more grateful â could
not be found. Several times provisions
ran short and hurried raids had to be
made on neighboring restaurants. The
latter responded promptly, and the ladies
managed to feed all the troops. Had an- â¢
other regiment come in during the day,
however. It would have fared poorly.
More troops are to arrive, and must be
fed. People living arrov the bay, ac
well as San Franciscans, can aid in the
good work by sending sandwiches, cotd
moats, cake, pies, etc.. to the Red Cross
Society at the ferry building.
CARE OF SICK SOLDIERS
Drs. Bunnell, Hill, Hartley, Zabala and
Dlggins were kept busy with sick soldiera
at the Harbor Receiving Hospital yester
day morning. Many of the men were suf
fering with a fever, and were sent to the
French and St. Luke's hospitals. Steward
Grau of the hospital corps that came
along with the troops was treated for a
lacerated wound of the finger, and O. S.
Taylor of Kansas for a contused wound
of the left hand. The others who were
taken care of were: Roy Kenyon, Her-,
bert Hull, J. J. Hickman, E. W. Lasell
and George Darrell of Colorado; Paul
Irvine Zimmerman, Fred Holmes, J. A.
Fisher, J. H. Fides, W. G. Reid and John
Johnson of Minnesota, and Thomas!
Brown and B. Bowker of Wyoming.
Duncombe's ambulance was placed at
the disposal of the Red Cross Society and
moved nearly ail the patients to the hos
pitals.
Jack Tracey, the driver of the Harbor
Hospital ambulance, refused to cross the
bay in order to bring over some of the
patients. Dr. Diggins, from motives of
patriotism and humanity, turned driver,
as well as doing duty as surgeon, and
assisted in moving the sick men. When
Tracey was good and ready to do some
driving he wanted to teach the surgeons'
who accompanied the sick' soldiera how
many should be put into the ambulance.
If he had been given his own way, all the
sick men would have been packed In like
sardines, and he would then only have
had to make one trip.
During the altercation that followed,
Tracey got so abusive that Captain,
Petzsenger of the State tug Go\-ernor
Markham interfered and knocked the
driver down. For a time fhe hospital waa
more like a prize-ring than anything else,
and peace was only restored when Tracey
promised to do his duty in a manly way.
An examination at the Receiving Hos-
pital by Dr. Bunnell showed that Hick
man was suffering from nausea, Hull
from rheumatism, Lazell, Darrell, John
son and Bowker from tonsilitis, Kenyon,
from earache. Holmes from bronchitis.
Brown from neuralgia and Reid and Zim
merman from pneumonia.
The Staff of General Otis.
According to general orders the follow
ing officers are announced as constituting 1
the present staff of General Otis:
Captain John L. Sebon, assistant ad
jutant general and aid-de-camp.

VACANCIES IN THE POLICE
COMMISSION.
Republicans Claim the Action Was
Taken Because the Deposed Men
Were Foes of Gotham
Gamblers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, &Laj 21.â Mayor Van
Wyck to-day removed Police Commfs
sioners Phillips and Hamilton. He ap
pointed Jacob Hess in the place of Cora
missioner Hamilton. Hess came to
police headquarters after noon and pre
sented his certificate of appointment.
The board then organized, re-electing
B. J. York president. Then the board
retired Chief McCullagh on a pension
of $3000 a year with the Mayor's ap
proval. The board appointed Deputy
Chief Devery as acting chief.
Upon news of the removals of the
Commissioners and to a number of re
porters, who called at the Mayor's of
fice to obtain a confirmation of the re
port of the removal of the Commission
ers, the Mayor said:
"I have just been asked if I have re
â  moved Police Commissioner Hamilton
and Phillips. I have, and I have also
appointed Jacob Hess to succeed Mr.
Hamilton. I want you to say to the
people that the Mayor, their servant,
whom they elected last fall, has re
sisted every attempt to raid the public
ti â â  asury and he will continue to do ;o.
He will also continue to run the af
fairs of the city government for the
benefit of the people and in the interest
of the people who elected him, confi
dent that at the end of his term he
will be indorsed by such an overwhelm
ing majority as has never been given
in the history of the city.
"I will," he continued, "administer
the affairs of the city without inter
ference from either Platt or Quigg. Tell
the people this and let them know that
I am at the helm and while 1 am |
Mayor, which will be for the next four â 
years, their interests will be safe in
my hands from raiders of all kinds.
"I have not yet appointed the suc
cessor of Mr. Phillips."
The Mayor did not go into particulars
or specify* any of the reasons which in
duced him to remove the two Police
Commisioners, but it is known that the
result was due to friction in the Police j
Board for some weeks over the transfer
of some captains and policemen.
John McCullagh, the Chief of Police,
just dropped, was a Republican and re
fused to make certain transfers the
Democratic Commissioners wanted, j
The two Democratic Commissioners ;
voted to retire the Chief, but were over
ruled by the votes of the Republican
Commissioners.
McCullagh called at the City Hall
next day and had a stormy interview
with the Mayor, during which he was
told to go back and run the department
without regard to politics, the Chief re
torting that in the matter of removals
he would do as he pleased. Since then
there have been numerous interviews
between the Mayor and the Police Com
missioners.
The Tammany version of the trouble
between McCullagh and the Mayor and
the Police Commissioners is that Sena
tor Platt and Congressman Quigg inter
fered with the running of the depart
ment. It was said that during an in
terview between the Mayor ond Com
missioner Hamilton the latter said he
would not vote for the transfer of a po
liceman if the action was not sanc
tioned by Quigg and j^latt.
The Republican version is that ever
since Tammany returned to power cer
tain gamblers and poolroom owners
have wanted to run "wide open," but
that McCullagh's opposition to this has
brought down the official ax upon his
neck.

DECLARED ABLE TO
CARE FOR HERSELF.
Rich Margaret Copsey of Stockton
Restored to Competency After a
Long Fight.
STOCKTON, May 21.â Margaret Copsey,
full of years and with a great fortune at
her command, has at last been restored
to competency. For this she has fought
In court In different ways for two years.
It took but thirty-five minutes in Judge
Jones' court this morning for the attor
neys to show to the satisfaction of a
jury that she was competent. Drs. A. W.
Hoisholt, Asa Clark and C. W. Ruggles
were sworn as exports and gave testi
mony favorable to the old lady. She her

to her property.
NATURALISTS PUZZLED.
Strange Animal Shot by Boys Hunt
ing Near San Kafael.
SAN RAFAEL, May 21.â While hunting :
birds' nests on Wolfs Hill, between this
city and Hn?s Valley, yesterday after- '-
noon, five boys killed a small animal that j
has excited the curiosity of all the local j
naturalists. The animal was discovered i
in the forks of a tree and shot by Roy j
Prescott with a parlor rifle. Its body is j
about one foot long and the tail a trifle
over seven inches. Its color is a soft gray, !
the back a reddish tint, with white on the !
stomach and cheeks, the ears tufted, and j
the tail ringed with black and white. The !
animal is pronounced by competent per- !
sons to be a ring-tailed lemur or maki. |
but this is a native of Madagascar. If j
it is a lemur, the common supposition is
that the animal must have escaped from
captivity, though it was very wild.

NICARAGUA
CANAL NEEDED
Would Now Be of Great
Naval Value.
LYMAN E. COOLEY'S VIEW.
THE ROUTE BETWEEN OCEANS
SHOULD BE SHORTENED.
With the Completion of the Water
way Uncle Sam Would Be
Supreme in the Atlantic
and Pacific.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, May 21.â Lyman E.
Cooley, the well-known engineer who
spent two months of last winter on the
route of the proposed Nicaragua
canal. In an Interview says:
"As a bluff, if nothing more, the
Nicaragua]! canal in operation to-day
would be worth $100,000,000 to this Gov
ernment. Completed we could perpetu
ally say to all nations that our fleets
In a moment of necessity could com
mand the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
as no other fleet in the world would be
able to do.
"In a race for Manila, we, starting
at New York and Spain at Cadiz, we,
with the Nicaragua canÂ»J, could reach
the Philippines before any fleet pass
ing through the Suez canal could do
so."
Mr. Cooley has studied the Journey
of the battle-ship Oregon around
South America with extraordinary in
| terest. since if the Nicaragua canal
' had been completed the Oregon might
! have been with Sampson weeks a^ro,
or in an emergency any part of our
i navy could be dispatched to the Pa
j cine Coast with the saving of thou
! sands of miles of journey.
"Suppose," said Mr. Cooley, "that
:it costs at the least $04, 000.000
to construct this canal, or at the most
$133,000,000, what would that amount
' to, in view of the fact that at the
I present moment every city on the Pa
ciflc Coast could be destroyed by a
! hostile fleet before a battle-ship of
: ours could round Cape Horn? When
we could reach the ruins of San Fran
cisco the enemy would be at Hawaii,
and when we were there they would be
at Manila or anchored safely at home.
"Leaving aside all question of the
i value to us of the canal as a powerful
I agency for developing our commerce,
look at its construction from a war
point of view. The Atlantic coast will
always be the concentration point for
) the cream of our navy. New York City
; is 14,000 miles from San Francisco with
; out the Nicaragua canal; that is, via
i the Straits of Magellan, steamers leav
| ing New York are over 13,000 miles from
! San Francisco, and sailing vessels via
; Cape Horn, 15,600 miles away. The
canal would shorten one route 8267
I miles and the other route 10,753 miles.
j A man-of-war sailing ten knots an
[ hour, or 240 miles per day, would save
I in the one instance forty-four days,
! and. in the other thirty-four days' time.
! In other words, if the Oregon is at Bar-
I badoes, sixty-two days were occupied
! by her in reaching that point from San
j Francisco, via Cape Horn. With the
Nicaragua canal completed, forty-four
days' time would have been saved over
one existing route and thirty-four days \
I over the other. The journey from San
I Francisco to New York could be made
' in eighteen days by a slow vessel and
I in nine or ten days by a swift one.
"Would not this be of value to the
Government in time of war, when so
\ much depends on the rapidity with
which our vessels must be moved from
point to point?"
Mr. <v,oiey also said that the charges
through the canal would be less than
the wages paid the men on the vessel
' and the coal consumed in a trip around
Cape Horn. In conclusion Mr. Cooley
I said:
"We could create a naval station at
Lake Nicaragua second to none in the
world, and from which our vessels
could pass for the protection of either
of our coasts with 8, rapidity un
equaled. The Spanish war and the
journey of the Oregon will awaken the
general punlie to the necessity of hav
ing the canal as nothing else could
have done. Once built the canai. from
a strategic or a commercial point of
view, means that our flag and our ship
ping will enter every port in the world
and we will be the maritime power of
the twentieth century."
SETTLE THE DELICATE
NIGER QUESTION.
An Agreement Said to Have Been
Beached Between France and
England.
PARIS, May 21.â The Figaro pub
lishes the important announcement
that the delicate Niger question, which
threatened to lead to an Anglo-French
war, has been settled and that an
agreement between the two govern
ments will be signed this week at the
Paris Foreign Office.
The agreement will be satisfactory to
both nations. It Involves mutual con
cessions, the chief being that the town
of Boussa, which the French occupy,
but which England claimed by earlier
treaties, would be given to England,
while France will retain Nlkki and two
towns on the Middle Niger. The line
of demarkatlon starts from 110 on the
Niger and runs southwest, leaving
Nikkl Inside the French sphere. The
Importance of Boussa lies in the fact
that It Is the highest town to which the
Niger Is navigable.

Small Holdings to Be Consolidated
Into One Large Mine to Be
Worked by Improved
Machinery.
.... ' ~~ " . -
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, May 21.â The Cascade Min
ing Company of Milwaukee has pur
chased for a quarter of a million dollars
twenty-four picked placer claims in
Swauk district, Kittitas County. The
sale was made through L. H. Jansen,
one of the claim owners, who has been :
working for two years to consolidate
these claims into one big placer mine.
Once San Francisco and Boston men
had an option on the property, but did |
not close the deal. The claims are now
worked on a large scale with the latest
hydraulic machinery, using the water
of Swauk and Williams creeks. It is J
known they will prove immensely |
profitable, because their owners have i
been taking from $5000 to $20,000 a sea- i
son out 'of the best of them, working in j
the most primitive way.
For years the Swauk district has |
been known as the greatest nugget pro- ;
ducing section in the State, numerous j
nuggets exceeding $500 in value having
been found. John Black, a pioneer of !
the district, found one nugget worth ;
$565. Gus Nilson last year took out j
the camp's champion nugget, valued at '
$1004. Other nuggets ran from $222 to !
$745. The miners have heretofore paid
little attention to saving gold dust, but
have instead sunk to bedrock and ;
searched there for nuggets. All their
tailings will now be worked over.
The gold is found chiefly in bars.
which cover the old creek channels
along the banks of the Williams, Swauk
Boulder and , Baker creeks.

CINCINNATI, May 21.â Plaudit -la a
. double derby winner. . This afternoon
j he won new laurels by easily defeating
Lieber Karl, who was the only starter
against him in the great $10,000 derby
at Oakley. There is no longer a ques
tion of doubt as to which is the better
horse of the two. Plaudit is in a class
by himself. This afternoon a big event
was won without an effort by the gal
j lant son of Himyar, after running un
j der restraint the entire distance.
Those who came to the track ex
pecting to see a hard fought contest
! were disappointed. Bannockburn and
i John Bright, the other two named to
i start in the derby, withdrew, leaving

CONTEST A TERRIER'S PRIZE.
SMAJLL PRICES FOR DOGS AT
AUCTION.
Presentation of Diplomas to the
Bench Show Committee and
the Distribution of
Prizes.
The? San Francisco Kennel Club's
p iCOtkH annual bench show has passed
into history. It was beyond question
the most successful show ever held in
this city, and 1 s been eclipsed but
once in the number of dogs benched,
but in no other respect.
The attendance was a record one.
The exact figures have not been com
piled, but when tho club's profit anÂ«l
loss account has been made up then 1
â¢will be a largÂ» balance to be placed at
the disposal of the Children's Hospital.
The principal event of the day was
the awarding: of the Hearst silver cup
for th^ most perfect specimen of any
breed in the show, and Superintendent
Oldham's offer of $25 for exhibitors of
kennels scoring the highest number of
points. Judge Bell had a ditfieult task
before him in making- the award, and
he chose the Irish setter as the win
ning breed. Lady Swivel! r, who won
the cup for her proud and happy own
er. Alec Truman, is not far removed
from b?ing th-- h Better.
Verona Kennel won the |25, which
will be used for the purchase of a
medal. The award was a popular one.
As already stated Judge Bell's awards
have in the most Instances been re
ceived with satisfaction, lie has made
some mistakes, but no man is infallible,
and his record excels that of any other
judge who has judged in San Francisco.
The auction sale was not a success,
only a few dogs being sold and those at
ridiculously low prices.
Henry J. Crocker, vice-president of
the club, distributed the prizt-s to the
winners, amid great applause.
The following presentations were
made:
To Judge George E. Bell, a bouquet
of flowers (contributed by Superin
tendent McLaren of Golden Gate Park)
and a leather diploma, with the inscrip
tion:
"Great powers move slowly, but they '
get there."
To Superintendent Oldham a leather
diploma with the inscription, "Cleanli
ness, Godliness, Sanitas," and to Vice-
President H. J. Crocker a bouquet of
flowers, as the must popular member of
the bench show committee.
The show has not been allowed Xo
pass without th lodgment of a protest.
S. Cnristenson has protested against
the award to J-'hm Tail's Rastus of the
first priJte in tlv> limit 'lass and of the
winner's prize. He bases his complaint
on section IS of the A. K. C. rules for
the government of the bench. The sec
tion reads ;is follows:
â A person or club guilty of miscon- â¢
duct in connection with dops, dog !
Phows or field trials, may be suspended
by the president <<Â£ the American Ken
nel Club, or in his absence by the vice- i
president or by the committee of the
show or trial where the offense was
committed. The disqualification of an
owner shall apply to nil dogs owned by i
him or connected with the perpetration
of a fraudulent act."
It appears that Poley's Rene, thÂ«
dam of Rastus, was bred to Christen- j
Bon's Imported Woodco-te Venom on
the understanding that Foley should
pay to the stud dog's owner the sum
of $26 or allow th^ latter to have the
first choice of the litter. Foley has
failed to perform either alternative of
his agreement, and christenson claims
Rastus as his choice and protests
against the latter receiving the awards
on account of the fraud perpetrated by
the breeder. Foley. Mr. Christenson
also alleges that John Tait, in whose
name Rastus is entered, is not the ,
bora-fide owner of Rastus, which be- ;
longs absolutely to Foley. This pre
sents a very pretty squabble, which
will, ultimately, have to be settled by
the Associated Kennel Club.
J. P. NORMAN.
MAKES A CLEAN SCORE.
Elliott Wins the Wing Shot Cham
pionship of America.
KANSAS CTTY, Mo., May 21.â J. A. R.
Elliot of Kansas City won the wing shot
championship of America to-day and in
cidentally became the permanent posses
sor of the Kansas City Star cup. The
championship race between the five
crarks who have at different times held '
the cup, was the feature of the closing
day of the Missouri shooting tournament.
This race for the permanent possession
of the trophy was close and exciting.
J. B. Reiliy of Kansas City was the first
of the contestants to miss. His sixth
bird fell dead out of bounds, but he fin
ished with a total score of 24. Sim Glover
of Rochester. N. V., saw his seventeenth
bird fall dead out of bounds and his
eighteenth was a clean miss. His score
of 23 was the lowest of the five. Charles
W. Budd of Dcs Moines, lowa, lost his
twenty-second bird, which fell dead out
of bounds, and Fred -Gilbert of Spirit
Lake, lowa, had the same misfortune
with his twenty-third bird. Elliott,
though he drew perhaps the hardest lot
of birds, won the championship with a
clean score of 25.
"Mies and out" was the manner of dis
posing of the second money. Budd went
out on his first bird, Gilbert missed his
eighth, and Reilly. by killing his ninth,
took the purse.
The closing event of the meeting was
FOOD COFFEE.
CRISP BACON.
He Who Did Not Write Shake-
speare's Plays.
"A man's nature runs either to herbs
or weeds, therefore, let him seasonably
water the one and destroy the other."
In other words, cultivate your pow-
ers and put aside the things which rob
you of strength and energy, which can
be turned into money and fame
Of course 'the crowd" float along and
don't care much what happens, so they
can deaden the body with narcotics
like whisky, coffee and tobacco, but
there are those who have the Divine
desire to amount to something in this
world, and to such these words are ad-
dressed.
If you have constitution enough to
Btand whisky, coffee and tobacco, well
and good. If not, trade them off for
success, and that only comes as a re-
sult of energy enough to aptf- oneself
If coffee interferes in the least with
your digestion, nerves or heart, drop it.
Success is worth more than coffee.
Use the food drink, Postum. It has
much the color and taste of coffee, but
Is made of powerful pure food elements
that sustain and nourish body and

in the company's service for a number of
years. The captain cheerfully complied.
as he understood it was merely to bid
him good by. In this he was mistaken,
ns ho no sooner took his place among his
late com] anions than Max Claussinneus
addressed him on behalf of his compan
ions, and in a neat speech presented him
with a sword as a gift from those with
whom he had been associated.
Captain Warren was very much affected
on receiving the gift, and in a few words
thanked them for their kind remem
brance of him. He said he would retain
the sword and wherever it was there he
would be.
During the many years in which he has ,
been connected with the house of O'Con- ;
nor & Moffatt he occupied a very prom
inent position in the firm. He had charge
of one of the most important branches
of the concern. He will join his regiment
to-morrow at the Presidio, but can have
his position on his return. In the mean
time liis family will not be neglected.

GRADUATED WITH HIGH HONORS.
SOME CHAMPIONS OF THE KENNEL CLUB'S SHOW
GETAWAY DAY
AT THE RACES
Long Season of Sport
Finally Terminates.
OUTSIDERS GOT THE COIN.
VELOZ TOOK THE DISTANCE
EVENT AT ODDS OF 100 TO 1.
Jockey Powell Distinguished Him
self â Munroe Johnson on Zarro
First in the Darktown.
Derby.
After nearly seven months of contin
uous racing, the long session was brought
to a close at Oakland yesterday. The
California Jockey Club made the occa
sion a gala one by donating the entire
gate receipts for the completion of the
Contra Costa tunnel, and between COOO and
7000 people passed through the turnstiles.
Racing was seen in all its varied forms.
Veloz. a 100 to 1 shot in the betting ring,
enlivened the afternoon's proceedings by
winnlng in a big gallop, and the Dark
town Derby, with chocolate-hued riders
in the saddle, furnished much amusement
for the crowd.
The day was fine up to the calling of the
sixth event, ami then rain sent everybody
under cover. It was a disastrous inning
for the "regulars." and many of them
failed to get the necewwry "getaway"
stake. Hurly Burly alone of all the
seven favorites crossed the plate in front.
Although a baker'a dozen of fortunate
speculators held tickets on Veloz, the
outsider's victory in the two-mile event
was a most unexpected one. Wheel of
Fortune, with Joe Piggott in the saddle,
was considered unbeatable, and went to
the post an even money favorite. Though
her odds receded in the betting. Argen
tina carried a bundle of good-sized com
missions, and the Baldwin mare made a
bold bid for first money. Jt was not until
a mile and three- | iart< rs had been cov
ered that it was seen that Veloz had her
measure. Then with gisantic strides the
long shot, with little Powell on his back,
assumed the lead, and won in romping
fashion covering the distance in 3:30. The
favorite seemed In trouble from the first,
!,in finished gamely under -unlshment,
taking the show.
From the very commencement it looked
dark for the first choices, for in the
opening five and a half furlong scramble
âfor which Lady Ashley lu-ld sway in
the bettingâ Amasa. a 15 to 1 chance, rid
den by "Kid" McNicholS, nosed out the
8 to 1 shot, Saticoy, the favorite falling to
get inside the money.
A bad mix-up at the start proved a
strong element in the success of another
outsider. Sir Irian, in the four and a
half furlong spin for two-year-olds. The
wise ones said it was a case of Kitty,
dose the Door." for Thorpe's mount.
Obsidian, and they loaded up accordingly,
at the short price of 7 to 5.
\\ hen the barrier was released tAome,
with Holmes up, fell, and during the at
tendant confusion the chances of the first
choice were ruined. Ojni. a IS to 1 shot,
headed La Parasseuse in the stretch and
looked a winner to within tour jumps of
the wire, where Powell got up With Mr
Urian earning the verdict by a scant
head The winner went to the posi at
odds of 40 to 1. Magdalenes, the second
choice, Rnished In tha show.
Flandes went to the post a slight fa\ -
orite over Klsmore for the mile selling
run but Thorpe could not land him inside
the coin. In a hard drive Macklin on
Mistleton y,f>t his mount over the line a
neck in advance of Klsmore. which hnr.se
made h One run from the rear.
The Contra Costa Tunnel Handicap,
over one mile and a furlong, fell to Crom

which coupled in the betting with Buck'

out the running for his stable mate, and
when it came to cutting loose time in
the stretch, Macklin. who had the mouni
on Purser's big gelding, took good care
of the other starters, with the result that
Cromwell was able to b--.it hup. Mistral

Sam Hildn-th's filly Hurly Burly was
favorite over Miss Etowena for the six
furlong sprint, and won about as she
pleased. The latter secured the place
from Bitter Root Just as handily.
Colonel Munro Johnson was "de fust
pus' son dat issued from de dusk" in the
DarktOWli Derby. The pood natured em
ploye of the Jockey Club had the leg up
on Zarro, against whom 6 to 1 was laid,
and after Captain Jackson on Metaire
and Major 'Whitney astride Mahogany
had raced their mounts' heads oft', colonel
Johnson eul himself loos-, and there was
nothing to it. The black horse won eased
up from Metalre. Wnen the colonel re
turned to the stand be was presented
with a huge bouquet, the colored swipes
and attendants howled until they were
whit* 1 in the face, the crap game keepers
rubbed their itchy hands with glop, and
the curtain fell on the last day of equine
sport for some months.
TRACK NOTES.
Powell, an unassuming little chap, was
the pilot of both of the victorious long
shots, Velox and Sir I'rian. He should
cut some ice on the Montana circuit this
summer.
Bookmaker George Rose laid one bet
of $2400 against $30 on Velox. The play,
though, was fast and the penciler quit
winner on the day.
There is a dispute as to who is entitled
to the services of Dick Clawson, now
riding for Sam Hildreth. John Mackey
of Rancho del Paso claims that he en
gaged the ciever saddle artist some six
weeks ago to ride for Marcus Daly. Yes
terdiiy he laid the thing before the Cali
fornia Jockey Club, but President Will
lame decided that It was not a matter
for his association to handle, and Mackey
will have to appeal to the Western Turf
Congress or the Jockey Club if he wants
redress.
Marsh Redon, the dry wit of the book
ing brigade and one of the shrewdest
layers of prices in the business, will make
book for George Rose on the Eastern
tracks. Marsh can get the coin in any
country- Â»
The Onlden Gate Driving Club will have
an outing on Memorial day at Oakland
track. The gate will be free and a grand
card of trotting and pacing events will
be decided.
The California and Pacific Coast Jockey
Clubs combined have decided to give the
Red Cross Society a benefit, and Friday
May L 7, has been set as the date. Fivo
or more races will be given.
John Mackey, manager of Rancho del
Paso, has brought suit against Book
maker George Rose. Two years ago the
bookmaker leased a stable' of runners
from the big establishment, agreeing to
pay all expenses and to give Mackey half
of the surplus. It appears that the stable
was never a success from the start and
Mackey now sues for an accounting It
is understood that a similar action has
been commenced against Tommy Liot
tridge of the firm of Atkin & Lottridge

THE "KIDS"
WERE KINGS
Worried All Ball-Players
Except Hennie.
AND THE FRISCOS WON OUT.
BEACHCOMBERS WERE TOO ANX
IOUS TO SWAT THE BALL.
Nevertheless It Was a Rattling
4 to 3 Game at Recrea
tion Parkâ To-Day's
Contest.
BY JOE CORBETT.
It was children's day at Recreation
Park yesterday afternoon and they
were there in full force, making as
much noise as possible and making It
very unpleasant for some of the play
ers with their jeering and at times very
sarcastic remarks. "Handsome" Hennle
Krug wan the only one on the diamond
capable of winning them over. They
would cheer him every time he made
a move, and whether it was his good
looks or his great playing that was re
sponsible for the applause he received
from these little ones I am unable to
state, but it was a fact that Hennie put
up a game at third base which was
simply beautiful to gaze upon. It would
be utterly impossible to play a better
game. No infielder ever threw a ball
with such speed and precision, picked
up grounders with such grace and
pulled down flits which such ease as
did all-around-playing Hennie. Alto
gether he accepted twelve chances
Without an error, and some of them
were very hard chances, one in partic
ular causing those little boysâ who, by
the way. knew a good play when it oc
curs â to sit down and whisper. It oc
curred at the iifth inning, when, with
one man out. Captain Blanco Dovcr
eatuc endeavored to bunt. He succeed
ed, so far as dropping the ball was con
cerned, but when dashing Hennte, who
was playing unusually deep for such
a play, came tearing in, and picking
the ball up with one hand, shot it over
to first in time to put "Big Bill" out,
it was really time to drop pencils,
score cavils and every old thing, and
show Henry by tearing a few boards
out of the stands that his good play
ing was being appreciated.
The game was a very good one, and,
.-is usual, the unexpected happened. It
looked like a walk-over for Panta
Cruz and evidently they were laboring
under such an impression. After
knocking Wheeler's shoots all over the
lot in the second inning and scf.-ring
three runs they appeared to have step
ped into oblivion, and on retiring found
themselves defeated by a score of 4
to 3.
A game of baseball is never over un
til the last man is out, and If those
"salted almonds" from "expjosive
ville" had but remembered that old say
ing, played ball, and scored runs when
they had a chance, without waiting
for batters to knock the ball over the
fence, there undoubtedly would be a
different story to tell. Mr. Balsa, how
ever, was really responsible for the
loss of the game, he making two wild
throws to bases, each of which cost a
run. Outside of this Mr. Balsz pitched
a magnificent game, striking out six
men and allowing but seven hits.
Wheeler on the other hand pitched a
good game save in the second inning,
when the "Beachcombers" got their
eye on the ball, and it looked for
awhile as If they would never etop
making base hits. Hennie Krujr, how
ever, came to the rescue by knocking
down a base hit and throwing a run
ner out at the plate. After this inning
he steadied down and pitched excel
lent ball, also accepting five chances.
The San Franciscos deserve more
than ordinary credit for yesterday's
victory, being sadly crippled without
their star players, Murphy and Mona
han. They went into the game, how
ever, as they always do, determined
to win or die in the attempt, and al
though Mr. Balsz was unreasonably
generous with his wild throws when
they would do the most harm, that
fact should not lessen the glory of the
victory. "Never give up until the game
is nver," is the motto of the Frisco
team, and playing to win when the
game was apparently lost is what land
ed victory on their side. To Dunleavy
is due the credit of making the hit that
won the game, and what a pretty hit
it was, going clear to the right center
field fence. It happened in the seventh
inning, the score at this stage being 3
to 2 in favor of Santa Cruz. Pyne, the
first man up, led off with a clean hit
to right field, and made second while
McGrath was fumbling the ball. Egan,
the next man in order, hit the ball to
Balsz, who picked it up and threw it
ten feet over Devereaux's head, en
deavoring to catch Pyne, who was
making for third. Before the ball was
recovered Pyne had scored, and Eagan
rested on third. Then came Dunleavy,
who straightened out one of Baltz's
curves for two bases, sending Eagan
home with the winning run. It was a
grand and unexpected finish. The fea
turesof the game were "Truck" Kazan's
running catch and H. Krug's all round
playing.

HOT BALL. FOR TO-DAY.
The Athletics to Be Pitted With
the Hard-Hitting Stock
tonians.
To-day's game at Recreation Park
promises to be a red hot affair. Both
teams have been working hard for the
past week, and from all accounts the
Stocktons purpose returning home with
a victory. Much rivalry exists be
tween the two teams, and as it is the
country against the city, the rooters
should not be conspicuous by their ab
sence. Firing begins at 2 p. m., and

THE SCHOOL
BOARD AND
THE CHARTER
Age Limit on Night
School Pupils.
IT WILL BAR MANY OUT.
POWERS OF THE APPOINTED
AND ELECTED BOARD.
A Little Joker Which May Allow
of an Unlimited Number
of Positions Being
Created.
Among: the many things burled away In
the voluminous pages of the new charter
are several rules governing the Board of
Eduoatlon to ba appointed by the Mayor
which are of a peculiar nature. In some
this Is patent on the surface at a cursory
flanoe, while in others little jokers are
cunningly buried under a mass of seem
ingly meaningless words.
Section 2, chapter 2, of article VII reads:
"Adults shall be entitled to free instruc
tion in the evening schools; bat no child
under 14 shall be admitted to the
â chools." This section has been found
particularly objectionable not only to
those on the outside who have given the
matter a second thought, but to many of
the present School Board, who are loud
In their condemnation of it.
In speaking of the matter last night,
President Barring-ton said:
"This is a matter which was not form
erly regulated by law, but was left to the
Judgment of the board. Our rules re-
Btrioted the age to 1:2 years, with a modi
fying proviso to the effect that the com
mittee on rules might at its option per
mit children under 12 to attend. This law,
If It is passed, will bar many from ob
taining an education. We all know that
there are many under 14 who are obliged
to earn a little toward the support of the
family. Again, some children of 11 or 12
are as competent physically and mentally
as others of 14 and 15. "We also have the
condition confronting us in many cases of
children under 14 who are obliged to
stay at home during the day to care for
younger ones, while the mother goes out
to earn the daily bread; and is it right
or Just to deprive any of _Uiese of an ed
ucation simply because tiiey have not
reached the age of 14 years? In these
cases there is simply the alternative of
Bending the children to be cared for in a
charitable institution or deprive them of
an education. "We have had many of
these cases brought to our attention In
past years, and it is a condition which
will always exist, or at least as long as
there is poverty in the world."
In section 2. chapter 3, of the same
article is found another cunning little
thing, but it Is not thrust out so plainly.
In fact, it requires a st-cund or third
reading before Its true meaning can be
seen. It empowers the appointed board
of four to employ "such teachers and
persons as ma\ be necessarj tv carry
into effect its duties," etc. This is very
similar to the present regulations of the
board; but the effects it may produce
are vastly different, according to the
opinions of many prominent members of
the board, who have carefully studied it.
The following Interpretation is given by
some of the nest-informed members:
"We ar>> allowed to appoint and fix
the salaries of teachers, inspectors and
other necessary officials, but we are not
allowed to create and fix salaries for the
thousand and one supernumeraries who
might be brought in under the broad title
of 'persons.'
'â¢Another thing, we hold our positions
through election by the people and are
responsible to the people for our actions;
but how different is the position of the
board provided for by the new charter.
This board is to consist of four people;
these four will be appointed by the
Mayor, and does it not stand to reason
that ut least three out of the four will
endeavor first and foremost to please
this Mayor In order to hold their posi
tions? it would be a poor Mayor who
could not control three of th*e four men
he appointed. Now if the Mayor wants
a certain number of vacancies made in
the department the members of the board
can. if they choose, appoint a certain
number of 'persons' under the name of
Inspectors, or any other title by which
they may choose to call th*-m. These
Inspectors will, of course, b<_- .nothing
more or less than private detectives. They
can lay traps, trump up charges, bring
to light a number of petty shortcomings,
or in fact do almost anything to prove a
teacher unworthy of holding his position
In the eyes of a board which has appoint
ed them to make such discoveries, and of
course the appointing power will be
fileased at the result. Ilia friends, polit
cal or otherwise, may get all the ap
pointments In the School Department
they choose, and tnere is practically no
restriction.
"Other parts of the charter allow of
Just as much jobbery. The Superintend
ent of Schools and his four deputies may
Juggle with the certificates to an almost

Incidents have been related. He was a

manner of expressing himself. The col
onel held the position of penitentiary In
spector some years ago, and was In the
habit of making his tour of Inspection on
a saddle mule, an animal especially fitted
for travel In that mountainous district by
reason of his great strength and sure
footedness. One day the colonel was vis
iting one of the prisons, and after tying
his mule to a fence rail he went inside to
pursue his investigations. A trusty who
had for a long time planned a little
scheme of escape on the colonel's mule,
watched his opportunity, and. untying the
brute, he Jumped on his back and was
soon speeding off for the mountains. At
that moment the colonel himself came out
of the prison for some purpose or other
and at a glance took in the situation of
the fleeing convict. Gazing in amazement
not unmixfd with admiration at the bold
dash for freedom, the colonel threw his
hat up In the air and yelled vociferously,
'Go It. you liberty-loving cuss, go It!'
and soon the escaping trusty was lost to
view In the recesses of the mountains."

CLEMENT WAS UNPATRIOTIC.
The Driver of a Delivery Wagon
Properly Punished for Uncom
plimentary Remarks.
J. Clement, a driver of a delivery wngon,
made some uncomplimentary remarks re
garding the Minnesota troops as they
were marching up Market street yester
day afternoon on their way to camp. He
had Bald very little when he was cau
tioned to desist by some of the bystand
ers, but It had little effect In closing off
his' flow of disparaging statements. "A
soldier Is only a dub," he said in reply
to the advice given him. He had hardly
got the words out of his mouth when he
was dragged off the seat of his wagon
and sent hurtling through the air by the
patriots who were Incensed by his state
ment. The unpatriotic driver was buf
feted about like a shuttlecock for a few
minutes, and he was a physical wreck
when he was allowed to escape.
Clement was driving a delivery wagon/
for George Swain, who had a contract to
deliver the goods of B. F. Lucke, and the
Bhoe dealer's name was painted on the
side of the wagon Clement was driving.
Lucke was a witness of the incident, and
he immediately notified Swain that no
man of the stamp of Clement could drive
a wagon that carried any of his goods.
Clement was promptly discharged and a
more patriotic man put in his place.

CREATES A
MONARCHY
The New Charter Said
to Have That Object.
SENTIMENT OF ARTISANS.
A MASS MEETING IS HELD AT
SCOTTISH HALL.
The Workingmen Are Addressed by
Ex-Attorney General Hart,
Attorney Schooler and
Colonel Roberts.
One of the greatest public denounce
ments that have thus far been hurled
against the adoption of the proposed
charter by public opinion was the mass
meeting held last evening at Scottish Hall
by two bodies of combined working men
of the city, led by several able speakers
and close students of the document that
will be launched for public approval or
ct'idemnation next Thursday.
The fundamental object of holding a
meeting of this character was Co draw in
one universal body representatives from
different sections of the city, who, as a
whole, would discuss the glaring defects
in the charter and use and disseminate
their influence WffffiPt the institution of
an arbitrary one-man power in this mu
nicipality. Already there are two sec
tions of the city representedâ North
Beach and that section lying in and
around Jlaight street in the vicinity of
the parkâ and at the conclusion of the
meeting last evening representatives of
the central portion of the city enrolled
themselves in the general army of oppo
sition against th" instrument that will de
prive them of their individual rights and
invest the Mayor of the city and his min
ions with absolute and arbitrary prerog
atives to govern the masses as they see
tit to the exclusion of public approval or
opposition.
Before the final day dawns that will de
cide whether San Francisco is to be a
free and self-governing community, or an
absolute miniature monarchy for Phelan
and his I(X> associates, an organization of
laboring men will be t-ffpcted which, in
its strength alone, will be sufficient to
destroy all hope of the adoption of the
charter, as Attorney Schooler in review
ing the instrument last evening re
n.arked.
Among the prominent speakers who
aided Air. Schooler in placing before the
people the true nature, of the charter, and
pointed out the various equivocations,
which mean usurpation and tyranny, were
ex-Attorney-General Hart and Colonel
Huberts.
Among the various resolutions adopted
the two following were the most Impor
tant:
Whereas, The advocates and framers of the
proposed new charter claim tor it many anti
corporation proclivities and tendencies, still
section 21 of article II effectually prevents any
and all future competition against our pres
ent light and watetr systems, thereby making
them greater monopolies than ever; and
Whereas, Great stress is by them laid upon
section 24 of chapter 11, which, speaking of
the power of the Hoard of Supervisors, reads
to fix the hours of labor or service required
of all laborers In the service of the city and
county and to fix their compensation, provided
that eight hours shall be the maximum hours
of labor In any calendar day and the mini
mum wages of laborers shall be $2 a day, they
well knowing that the laborers opportunity
to benefit by that section Is very small, owing
to section 14 of article VI, which reads: "All
public works authorized by the Board of
Supervisors to be done under the supervision
of the Board of Public Works shall, unless
otherwise determined by the Board of Public
Works, be done under written contract; and
Whereas, Neither paid section nor any other
section in the charter determines what shall
be the minimum wages or what hours shall
constitute a day's labor for the contractor-,
and
Whereas. The contract system has been and
still is the curse of labor and the cause of
great annoyance and expense to small prop
erty owners; therefore, be It
Resolved, That we denounce the proposed
new charter as a snare and fraud, framed
without any Intention or desire of benefiting
the poor or laboring man, but for the sole
purpose of increasing the ' emoluments and
power of the few; and be it further
Resolved, That we pledge ourselves to use
every honest endeavor to accomplish Its de
feat at the coming election. -
Upon unanimous recommendation and
approval the temporary chairman, Tim
othy Sullivan, and Secretary Noon were
elected as permanent officers, of the new
organization to serve as such during the
entire campaign*.
"The Worst Charter."
The executive committee of the Con
tinental League last night adopted the
following call to voters:
Whereas, The proposed charter for this city
j was prepared by fifteen freeholders â owners
I of land, upon the theory of monarchical gov
ernments that only the "landed ariKtocracy"
! Is tit to make rhartera for a municipal gov
j ernment ami that citizens, especially working
men who own no land, are unfit In a free
country to be members of a convention to
frame a municipal charter; and
Whereas, This body of fifteen freeholders se
: leeted upon this artatu< ratio principle has pro
duced a charter based upon the monarchical
principle and distrust of the people of a mu
nicipality; a, charter which will Increase our
annual expenses over a million dollars a year,
and In addition will establish a bond mill to
| augment our Indebtedness and Impose addl
' tional taxes on our people, which creates a
Lord Mayorâ a municipal boss with immense
powers and patronage, which destroys the
j usefulness of all public officials, making them
j the serfs of his lordship, the Mayor; a Char
! ter which gives ex-Hayora a seat for life In
I the Board of Supervisors, creating an arls
> tocracy of Lord Mayors with oligarchical pow
1 era for life and making ex-Mayors our munlci
[ pal nobility, such a provision has nerer before
! disgraced a charter made for American free
! men; a charter which entrenches the city rall
j roads In their franchises and power, and by its
! Impracticable and unreasonable requirements
; will prevent the establishment of rival and
; other railroads in this city; which creates such
a board of public works as In other cities
, has resulted In Imposing a treat burden of
. taxation and creating immense corruption; a
i charter full of oh.iectionable and unreasonable
provisions, which will Impair the efficiency and
usefulness of municipal government.
The Continental League therefore calls upon
all citizens Irrespective of party, who believe
In the equality of rights and the right of the
people to elect their own officers and to gov
ern themselves, and who deHlre an economical
and efficient municipal government, to oppose
.this, the worst charter ever drafted for an
! American city.

WAS WETTSTEIN THROWN OUTP
Captain Gillen Investigating Into the
Cause of His Death.
From information received by Captain
Gillen of the Seventeenth street station
an inquiry has been started by him into
the cause of t lie death of Kdward Wett
stein. who was run over by the wagon
which he was driving on the San Jose
road last Friday. The report that was
furnished to the police and Coroner was
to the effect that the wagon while going
over a rut in the road pitched Wettstein
out, when the wheels went over his
chest and crushed his life out. Since
then information has been conveyed to
Captain Gillen that Joseph Canencend,
who was silting on the seat with Wett
stein, was seen to strike him and after
ward throw him off.
Acting on this, Officers P. McKenna and
! T. Kennedy were detailed to investigate
j the case and in the meantime bring C&
j nencend into the station for interroga
i tion. This they did, and In his pocket was
I found a portion of Wettstein's watch
chain. He explained the presence of the
broken chain by saying that he did not
like to give it to the dead man's widow
as it would only increase her grief.
Considering the nature of the informa
tion Captain Gillen decided to detain Ca
nencend until further investigation may
be had as to whether he did or did not
throw Wettstein off the seat.
A Police Officer Injured.
Officer Peter Coleman, one of the old
est members In the department, while
riding in the police patrol on his way to
the Presidio to serve a subpena, waa
thrown out as the vehicle rounded a
curve and sustained a sprained wrist and
hip and an abrasion of the face. He was
removed to the Receiving Hospital.
LUMBER GOES DOWN.
The Pool Has Been Forced tc Lower
Its Own Schedule.
After repeated efforts to force up thÂ«
price of lumber, the lumber pool, known
as the Pine ' Manufacturing Association,
has at last been forced to draw back, and
in all probability the prices will soon be
down to the old level.
The claim Is made that there has been
an overproduction and an under-con
sumption. A very slack season is also
anticipated owing to the war and the ex

YSAYE AND GERARDY
ARRIVED LAST NIGHT.
HERE TO FILL A LOCAL
ENGAGEMENT.
The Eminent Violinist Has a Kind
Word to Say for His Illus
trious Contemporary,
Bemenyi.
Ysaye, the distinguished violinist, and
Jean Gerardy, the famous Belgian violon
cellist, arrived in this city late last night
on the overland, accompanied by their
American manager, Victor Thrane of
New York, and the party registered at
the Baldwin. They have come to this
city to play a local encasement, which
gives promise of being thu musical sen
sation of the year.
Ysaye needs no introduction to the
music-loving public, and those who have
had the good fortune to listen to hi
matchless execution and technique on the
king of instruments will no doubt gladly
avail themselves of the opportunity of
hearing so distinguished a violinist again.
It is a singular coincidence that both
Ysaye and Gerardy are natives of Liege,
Belgium, and a still more noteworthy
fact that Gerardy, who has now reached
a point of excellence where he may suc
cessfully challenge comparison With any
living exponent of that sympathetic and
most difficult instrument, "the violoncello,
is but 2u years of age, a mere boy in a.p
pearance { and made his American Jebut
in New York just three years ago.
Ysaye in an interview said: "ft is true
that 1 will organize an orchestra in
America, and I am on the lookout for
good musicians, who are sometimes
found where you least expect. At the
same time 1 desire it understood that 1
do not intend to pose as Anton yÂ«-i<l l's
successor, and 1 have not made any prop
osition to the members of the SÂ«td]
orchestra toward assuming leadership
over that body. My orchestra will be
composed of musicians of my own choos
ing:, and if I can get such men .is will
suit me rrom the Seidl orchestra, I will
certainly make arrangenu-nts with them.
Anton Seidl made me a very tempting
offer to become his concertmeister just
before his death, and the matter was to
have been discussed between us on the
very evening Upon which Mr. Seidl died."
"When the name of Remenyi was men
tioned, the illustrious virtuoso said, sad
ly: "Ah, poor fellow; his was a pathetic
death. J heard him play once, about six
months ago, and he gave evidence of the
musical genius that possessed his soul.
lie was of another generation, however,
tmt none the less a magnificent artist. I
could have wished that he had not de
ecended to vaudeville; but we are all
creatures of circumstances. "What a
beautiful though tragic death, dying with
his beloved instrument clasped to his
heart, and one on which he liad evoked
so many delightful strains:"
Gerardy, a bright, handsome young
man, is a quiet, unassuming person, and
his modest conversation gives no evi
dence of the wonderful talent he pos
sesses. "I began to study the violoncello,"
he said, "when 1 was 7 years of age, with
Bellman of the Heckman Quartet of
Cologne, and made my iirst public ap
pearance in Liege in ISSS. Shortly after,
in Antwerp, 1 performed the Trio of
Rubenstein in conjunction with Pader
ewski a.nd Ysaye, and 1 believe that it
was the proudest moment of my life, for
I considered it an extraordinary compli
ment to a boy only 11 years to be con
sidered by those great artists worthy of
performing in trios with them. I made
my first appearance in England at that
time, and when 13 years old I played with
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra of
which Hans Rirhter is the conductor, and
after that went to Berlin, where 1 played
with Yon Hulow."
Patriotic Elks.
An enthusiastic meeting- of Golden Gate
Lodge No. 6, Benevolent Protective Oruer
of Klks, was lu-ld last Friday night. Elo
quent and patriotic speeches were made
by many of the members, and when the
beautiful new silk American flag was un
furled lor the first time excitement was
great. The flag has recently been pre
sented to the lodge by its lady friends.
Golden Gate No. 6 is the only lodge of
Elks which has pledged itself to cart- for
all members who enlist in the United
States service, and also their families,
during their absence. The lodge will visit

Pawning Jewelry His Failing 1 .
Mrs. Qeorgie Hubbard, who lives in the
Burnett House on Market street, last
night caused the arrest of John Edward
Tibbetts, an ussmyer. She claims that
John visited her in an intoxicated condi
tion, and during a conversation was
given a watch to have repaired. Instead
of carrying out her wish he pawned it.
The next day he induced her to lend him
a diamond ring valued at $200, which he
also pawned. Finding out his falling she
had him arrested, with a view to curing
him and of getting her Jewelry back.
Helieved of Diamonds and Money.
Mrs. W. C. Wise reported to the police
last night the loss of a diamond ring, a
set of diamond earrings and a sum of
money. She informed them that she
went to Camp Richmond to see the new
arrivals, and while buying oranges for
the boys in blue some one relieved her of
a purse containing the above articles.
Stuck on the Ways.
The tug Alert of Spreckels' fleet was
sent out at midnight to relieve a vessel
at the Fulton Iron Works. An attempt
had been made to launch the boat, but
she stuck on the ways and it was found
necessary to bring the tug to her aid.

THE AUDITOR
STRUCK FIRE
Criticisms Which Did Not
Exactly Suit Him.
DENOUNCED IMPERTINENCE.
ELECTING OFFICERS FOR THE
CHARTER ELECTION.
A Meeting of the Election Commis
sion at Which There Was
More Than Routine
Business.
The Election Commission met yester
day to make arrangements for the com
ing charter election, and apropos of the
business in hand Mr. Broderick waxed
wroth over the antics of a morning
paper and spoke his mind about it with
a freedom befitting the expressions
used.
The Election Board has decided that
the most feasible method of securing
election officers would be to retain all
those who served at the freeholders'
election, filling those vacancies which
had occurred since that time by reason
of death, employment in public office or
anything else which, happening since
their service, would disqualify the
former officers from serving again.
There was an attempt to cast suspicion
on this procedure, and it was an
nounced that the friends of the charter
\v*ere afraid that the officers decided
upon would not give the charter a fair
chance in the count, forgetting that the
same charge was urged against them
in the freeholders' election and was ex
ploded when it was found that the con
vention's ticket was practically elected.
Despite this there was a fear that the
officers who had done well once would
not do so well again, and an attempt
on the part of the Examiner to lay the
blame on Broderick brought forth an
expression of opinion which, being plain
and to the point, was necessarily
rather poignant. V,
.Mr. Broderick pointed to an article
which stated that he and Mr. Creswell
would make a hard light to have re
tained those officers who had moved
from the districts which they had for
merly represented, and denounced it as
false and an insinuation that he and
Mr. Creswell had political reasons for
wishing to keep certain men on duty.
He denounced the paper and the course
it is pursuing and the policy It claims
to adhere to; he said the columns were
purchasable, but the only man who
made money out of them was the man
aging editor; he said, too, that he be
lieved the paper was subsisting in a
great measure on blackmail, and that
Hearst, however responsible he might
be, was kept in ignorance of the true
state of affairs by his subordinates
here, and was therefore not wholly to
blame in the matter. He then paid his
respects once more* to the managing
editor, and, having relieved his mind
thoroughly, he was ready to proceed
with the business of the meeting.
Most of the session was devoted to
the consideration of election officers,
but at the last moment, despite the
fa< t that the board had continued in
session over an hour and a half, more
than was intended, time was found to
denounce and to order destroyed the
posters which had been pasted on the
voting booths by the friends of the
charter â friends whose knowledge of
reform did not reach or would not
reach to the fact that such election
eering is strictly prohibited by law.
Each one of tlte commission, and all
were present, expressed himself as
much opposed to any work of that
kind, and the registrar was ordered to
have all the obnoxious signs removed.
Proceedings were opened by Mr. Cres
well, who, on account of the impos
sibility of observing the law of ap
pointing election officers and also for
expediency ( moved that all of the elec
tion officers who served at the free
holder election, held December 27, 1897,
who have answered the notice of ap
pointment sent to them by the registrar
of voters, be sworn in by him as officers
of the special charter election, to be
held May 26, 1898; and that the Elec
tion Commissioners proceed to fill the
vacancies occasioned by those who fail
to appear and qualify, and such others
who are employed in or have held a
position in municipal or other depart
ments of the Government ninety days
preceding the election.
This passed without opposition, and
then it was decided to appoint succes
sors to those who it was known would
not act in the special election. This,
too, passed, and for two hours the
names ( >t' various candidates were con-
Bidered. Several known vacancies were
provided for, and then the board ad

CAMP AT THE PRESIDIO.
Colors Presented to the Sixth
Infantry â The Gentle
Rain.
In the matter of regimental colors the
two battalions of the Sixth Infantry have
not been forgotten, for yesterday morning
a very handsome stand of colors was pre
sented to Colonel Johnson's command by
a committee representing the citizens of
Stockton.
Colonel Berry of the Seventh kindly
loaned the Sixth the services of his band
for the presentation ceremony, which took
place upon the parade ground of the
Fourteenth Infantry. The committee that
presented the colors consisted of Orrin S.
Henderson, chairman of the Board of
Supervisors of San Joaquin County; Wil
liam Inglis, Mayor of Stockton; Frank E.
Dunlap, Arthur Levinsky. Colonel George
E. Sperry. C. M. Weber and Francis Cut
ting. Mrs. Henderson and Mrs. Sperry
were also present, having accompanied
their husbands here.
Mr. Henderson introduced Mayor Inglis,
who in turn presented Mr. Dunlap, the
orator of the occasion. He spoke in a pa
triotic way, and Colonel Johnson fittingly
responded as he accepted the colors on
behalf of the battalions.
Captain Carrington has received orders
from the War Department to close up his
affairs immediately. From this he antic
ipates that in the very near future he
may receive orders detailing him for ac
tive service. It is known positively that
if the Government permits of the addi
tion of another battalion to the Sixth In
fantry Captain Carrington will be com
missioned as its colonel by Governor
Budd. The brigadier generalship, which
has been mentioned in connection with
the captain, is by no means an impossi
bility, as it is reported that his twenty
years of active s.rviie in the army will
more than discount the political pull of
some of the inexperienced soldiers now
seeking the position.
Major McCarthy, acting under instruc
tions from Major Surgeon White. U. S.
A., yesterday issued orders to Captain
Farrell of the First, Captain Russell of
the Seventh and Captain Rottanzi of the
Sixth to hold themselves in immediate
preparation and to be fully equipped to
leave with the first expedition that sails
for Manila,
It is now definitely known that Major
McCarthy will remain behind in charge
of all the volunteer surgeons until the last
detachment of volunteer troops has been
ordered to Manila, when he will leave
with them. Captains Rethers and Rooiee
are still in charge of the brigade hospital,

Camp life at the Presidio has again be
come one of the hardships that fall to
soldiers. The rain of yesterday after
noon, while not as heavy as that of the
first of the week, has once more reduced
the company streets to that state of
stickey paste that makes walking diffi
cult and covers every person and every
thing with mud. One new case of pneu
monia was reported in the Seventh yes
terday, and it was removed to the post
hospital. The case Is a serious one. Be
sides this, the general health of the dif
ferent regiments is excellent. No new
cases of the measles have developed In
the Oregon regiment, and Major Mc-
Carthy is of the opinion that the threat
ened epidemic has been successfully
checked.
DRUMMED OUT OF CAMP.
Expelled in Disgrace From thÂ©
Seventh Regiment of Cali
fornia Volunteers.
William G. Mitchell, formerly of the
Seventh Regiment of the National Guard,
who came to this city with Colonel Ber
ry's command, has been drummed out
of the Seventh's camp in disgrace, and
ordered by Colonel Berry not to put his
foot inside the Seventh's lines again.
The charge preferred against him at his
trial yesterday morning was in substance
the obtaining of money under false pre
tenses.
Mitchell rame as a private in the hos
pital corps, but never enlisted. He hung
around the Seventh's hospital corpÃ' tent,
and represented to Colonel Berry that he
had secured a position as a private clerk
or orderly to Colonel Smith of the First
Regiment. "When hr came here he wore
the uniform of a private soldier. Ha
managed by some means to obtain from
the quartermaster a first sergeant's
blouse, and donning this he yesterday
canvassed among tho visitors in camp for
funds for the hospital corps, representing
that it was sadly in need of funds. One
of the stewards saw some ladies give
Mitchell $2. He never turned over the
money, but appropriated it for his own
use. Mitchell comes from Los Angeles, it
is said, and does not bear a good name.SLIPPER WREN
AN EXPERT
Dogs That Ran Evenly
From the Slips.
SPORT AT UNION PARK.
LAURELWOOD IS WITHDRAWN
AFTER A NO COURSE.
The Probable Winners of the First
Round at the Meeting Which
Is to Take Place
To-Day.
Great hares, great slipping, were the
Interesting features of yesterday at
the Union Coursing Park Association's
grounds.
James Wren, who is probably better
known among the patrons of the leash
as "Smiling Jim," made his inaugural
appearance on the green sward as
official slipper for the park.
"Wren for several seasons was the
liberator, of hounds at meetings held
on the great coursing plateau of Mer
ced County, and he was never known
to have made a mistake excepting
when he happened to get the toes of
his nimble feet caught in a squirrel
hole.
Yesterday Wren, in a desperate at
tempt to get the first brace of dogs off
on an equality, made a double slip and
ft trip which sent him sprawling on all
fours. The dogs, however, got away to
a good start, and the slipper was the
recipient of a hearty cheer from the
interested spectators. But his slipping
afterward was simply grand, the dogs
breaking away evenly. The gathering
which will be on the grounds this af
ternoon will be afforded an oppor
tunity of seeing what an old hand at
the game can do when his reputation
Is at stake.
In yesterday's run down of the big
stake Fireball came near losing the
course with Fleeting Fancy owing to
ni9 lurching habits. The first upset
to the talent came in the fourth course
when Mystery put out Vanity Fair in
a long course. The last named dog
had the best of the first part of the
course, but lost ground at the finish.
Laurel wood came within an ace of
'â¢dumping' 1 the "longenders." He sold
at 20 to lon Kill Boy. The white and
fawn dog scored many points in the
early part of the race, but quit badly
when the hare reached the soft ground
which is near the escape, allowing Kill
Boy to roll up several points to his
credit. The judge â¢'doffed" his cap,
which signal meant a "no course." The
owner of Laurelwood then withdrew
the dog and the poolsellers returned the
sports their money, which was consid
ered a rather strange proceeding, but
the park managers said that it was ac
cording to rule.
Little Dorrit, a shortender, disposed
of Harkaway after a "no course" and
Little Dottie followed suit by sending
Wlldflower to her kennel.
Log Boy, owing, it was said, to an
injury, was withdrawn and his op
ponent, busie, ran a bye with Electric.
Morning- glory also had a bye with
.-i.kwood.
Mission Boy, a shortender, disposed
of McKinley after a no course. Ow
ing to the absence of the bench show
dog. Skyball, Move On had a bye with
Fleeting Fancy. " Little Doubt hand
somely defeated Gilt Edge, a 2 to 1 fa
vorite, after ano course. In a sharp
race, which terminated the day's sport,
Diana ran away from White Chief and
maybe among the winners of to-day.
The result of the run down of the big
stake is as follows:
Van Knapp beat Uncle Sam; Terrona beat
Wheel of Fortune; Fireball beat Fleeting
Fancy: Mystery beat Vanity Fair; Black
Prince beat Pigeon Toes; Dottle Dimple beat
IMy 'Wheeler; Forget beat Empire; Sportsman

At a. meeting of the Civic Rights League
last night the following address given
by John F. Wetzel was unanimously
adopted as expressing the sentiments of
its members:
Alter careful consideration of every article
and every section from the time the free
holders began their tusk until the present day.
without bias and wftU the hope that they
would frame a charter that would be accept
able to a majority of the people, we are sorry
to say that we can find no merit and much
demerit In the Instrument they have submitted
tor our adoption or rejection on Thursday, the
26th day of May, IS9S. .. >
Much or it is like the magic pictures that
contain hidden things, which, once pointed out
or discovered, may never escape detection after
ward. These which might be called the negroes
in the woodpile or the hidden cats, are, when
once detected, fatal blowholes in the armor of
the new instrument. Among a hundred reasons
why we should vote against the new charter,
each of which Is almost BUincient of Itself, we
will choose a few as being a direct attack upon
popular government by majorities; and the sap
ping and mining of our American institutions,
lor the purpose, always present but never
avowed of disfranchising the common people
and gradually and persistently erecting upon
its ruins the oligarchy of .wealth, with all the
special privileges, all the sinecures or lifetime
tenure in office, all the appointive powers, all
the legislative powers, all the administrative
powers and ail the judicial powers or' govern
ment. Outside of the Supervisors and a few
executive officials, 3000 public servants are
directly or indirectly, dependent upon the power
of the Mayor tor their positions. lie is vested
with the sovereign powers that mark the
monarch as opposed to the sovereignty of a
free and independent 'people. He may not only
elect the various boards and officials, but in
directly all seml-otncials and employes, and
discharge them at his pleasure and fill the
vacancies with his relatives, friends and par
tisans. He may even cause to be removed the
very elected officials, even the Supervisors, if
to bis interest, and the same endeavor of our
present Mayor, which proved a failure un
der the present instrument, will be an un
qualified success under the new instrument if
it should unhappily become the organic 1 law of
tho city.
The Mayor Is clothed with legislative power
to override the will of all majorities and com
pel even the Supervisors to repass any popular
measure in ilie ratio of 5 to 1 before it be
comes a law, even if of. the most urgent necea-
sity.
Ha la clothed with executive power even
above the will of all the people, including all
officials, heads of departments and chief of
police, to command the police force, appoint
deputies, call upon the Governor of the State
for military aid if any of his recommendations
shall be neglected by the people's elected offi
cials, among which might be the suppression
of tree speech, freedom of the press or the
gathering together of. the people In organized
and orderly manner to petition for redress of
grievances, He is clothed with inquisitorial
powers and many remove from official position
any one who fails to inform upon his ap
pointees even before the commission of an
oveit act. He is clothed with power to revoke
franchises and other special privileges and
recommend that they be let to more favored
parties. He may demand that the people's
elect do convene to suit his interests, dictate
and limit them to his pet object, and If not
suited with their act veto it and make it In
operative. He has control of the disbursement
of almost 90 per cent of the city's finances, at
present aggregating almost five millions, be
sides the other millions that may illegally pass
because of, the multiplicity of powers granted
him and denied to the people.
When he is clothed with power to appoint
the police judges the liberties of the people
will be completely at his mercy; right 01 con
tract between the Employe and his employer
will be suspended and the liberty of the worker
to quit his employment will be denied, when
the wages fixed by the heads of departments
shall be the same as in private employment
of the same grade and below a living wago.
He shall appoint the boards of public works,
health, education, police, lire, park, election
and civil service commissions and certain other
officials, who snail each make laws for their
own government and of their appointees and
employes and virtually determine either con
sciously or unconsciously the politics and re
ligion and the sort of morality they shall be
lieve and practice. Thus upon the will of one
man will depend the living, the liberty and
the happiness of many other men.
The concentration of power is not confined
to the Mayor alone, but the Chief of Police has
full power to detail any or all The force in the
case of a strike or other, tumult. Neither is
it confined to the elective officials that repre
sent the people, but the Fire Marshal and as
sistants shall be appointed by a private cor
poration, and all policemen- and deputies shall
be under his orders, with all the powers of
Sheriff* and their deputies to suppress organ
ized gatherings, protect property and enforce
all laws relating to explosives, etc., the dis
posal of same and the arrest of all suspected
persons, all of these to be paid by the cor
poration appointing them, but not by the city
and county. A sort of censorship over the
books, journals and periodicals the common
people ;r.->- read is exercised by certain per
sona, who may appoint their own successors
in office forever.
One man will decide what books and teach
ings may be excluded as religious and sec
tarian and what others may be allowed in the
schools.
Class legislation is again apparent this time,
and the only time. In favor of the common
people, wherein text-books are furnished to
indigent pupils exclusively, thus covering
them with shame and disgrace in the eyes of
their more fortunate companions.
Many other serious wrongs are perpetrated
besides the concentration of power, among
which we will mention the following on ac
count of their immoral tendency: The pension
fund for superannuated and disabled fire and
police officials is largely maintained from
reprehensible sources, fines levied upon grog
shops and unfortunate women, property of ar
rests, pawnshops, gambling-houses, second
hand receivers of stolen goods, junk shops
and from corporations and others for protect
ing them and theirs in case of strike or other
Imaginary danger.
A sort of premium is placed upon the unmar
ried state by forfeiting a widow's pension If
she remarries or if she removes from the
State to parents, or friends who assist in the
support of her and her children. Any pen
sioner Is placed in the same category as felons
and habitual drunkards and his pension for
feited If he removes from the State.
Neither in case of war, famine, pestilence or
other cause of excessive cost of living can any
salary be Increased In Justice and equity In
proportion to the decreased purchasing power
of the money received. The public acquisition
of the only utilities possible for years to come
would only Increase illicit patronage, cheaper
water, light and telephone service to the
propertied classes by burdening future genera
tions with Increasing bondage at high Inter
est and In denominations that can in no way
facilitate exchange. There is no intent to fur
nish cheaper and better homes or cheaper fares
to the residence districts. Neither can we have
cheaper fares through free competition in
street car lines, because the new charter ef
fectually blocks the letting of franchises to
any such end, but does in fact perpetuate the
present monopoly. Even the power of alter

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, MAY 22, 1898.
nate proposition Is removed from the people
and placed at the mercy of these corporate In
fluences, which we properly place among the
immoral tendencies of the new charter.
Political patronage Is brazenly admitted and
secured by statute to the persons where it will
do the most good to partisan effort and be
easiest of access; also any employee informing
upon any person who shall levy political or
private assessments shall be removed by the
appointing p m er.
Even the Mayor is made the custodian of a
corruption fund levied annually by statute, be
side the Illicit fund that might pass into thiÂ»
hands uf a venial incumbent.
The olalm of public employment by day
labor at not less than $2 a day is immoral,
false and in line with the rest of the de
ceptive instrument, because all work in value
over $500 must be let by contract and all day's
labor must be at no higher than current wages
for similar employment. Even the street
sweepers may be displaced by contract work,
and the city purchase the machines for the use
of the contractor.
Duplicity Is manifested In making promises
not Intended to be be fulfilled. Powers granted
the people to acquire public utilities, public
buildings and Improvements in one article are
nullified in another, and only rendered Pos
sible after wearying delays, herculean efforts
by non-interested parties, unreasonable bond
age at prices fixed by present owners, limited
to the least desirable at any one period, under
a system that would soon make it obnoxious
to the people.
The power of alternative proposition Is also
placed in the hands of the Mayor, which
should be only In the hands of the people, for
we are likely to find the second alternative
much less desirable than the first.
Majority rule Is again ignored and the prop
ertied class favored in the ratio of 3 to 2 in
voting upon any public utility, building or im
provement, and even then there will shall be
set aside ir all Indebtedness exceeds 15 per cent
of the value assessed by one man, a mere hu
man being, subject to all the frailties of the
flesh, who may not be able to resist the temp
tations to which he will be subjected. He Is
not omniscient, and yet he shall be empowered
not only with the task of fixing a value upon
the poor man's possessions, but upon the
princely estates of the associated villainies, and
upon his decision rests the financial possibil
ity of public ownership and the possibility of
conducting the city government.
If bonds should Issue the Supervisors, sub
ject to the veto of the Mayor, and not the
people, shall declare what legal money may be
a tender in payment, the constitutions of the
Lnited States and the State ot California to
the contrary notwithstanding.
The one hundred and fifty pages of 500 words
to the page, in all about 75,000 words, in
many sections unconstitutional, contradictory
and fallacious fB longer than the great Eng
lish charter, bill of rights of England, the
Declaration of Independence, Constitutions of
the United States and the State of California
combined, grants powers in one section, only
to deny them in another. To one board in one
section and to another board In another section.
To the people In one section and to the
Supervisors or the Mayor in another. Public
ownership In one section, a dollar limit, 15 per
cent property valuation, to annul it in another;
disclaiming reduction of taxation, while mak
ing a million dollar increase in the cost of
municipal government Is not an Instrument
that will appeal to the best sense of the peo
ple and secure their indorsement. The method
of amending the new charter is unconstitutional
even If it were possible to secure the co-opera
tion of the Mayor or fourteen of the eighteen
Supervisors, three-fifths of all electors and
both houses of the State Legislature, which
the new charter would cause to be necessary.
Majority rule and true home rule Is evidently
considered dangerous to the propertied class.
the corporations, the bosses, the political hang
ers on and. other interested parties and every
provision of the so-called new charter seems
to be an attempt to grasp some special privi
lege and to dispossess the common people not
only of elective, legislative, executive an.l
judicial powers, but to make them dependent
for the very means of existence upon the favor
of a privileged class, in which life liberty and
pursuit of happiness would be entirely at their
mercy.
"When a charter is presented to us that we
have a voice in framing, which will grant us
a popular form of government with all that
term implies and gives us a chance to con
duct our public business as we would our
private affairs we will give It our hearty sup
port, but we will resist to the last any en
croachment upon popular government and ma
jority rule.
We want amendments to our present charter
and to the State constitution which will give
us true home rule and believe they can be se
cured In shorter time and with less effort and
expense than any amendment to the new
charter. We want the right and power to
remove OUT public servants, including the
Mayor, whenever they are derelict to duty.
We wast the final voice in all legislation,
administration and Judicial decision whenever
the public weal demands such obligatory
referendum by a popular initiative.
We want the public utilities, municipal
buildings and improvements whenever we can
control them in the interests of the whole peo
ple, either by condemnation and appropria
tion, which is possible now under the present
charter or by the Issue of notes of small de
nomination, low interest and short time mode
receivable for public service as soon as State
legislation can lie secured to that end.
We want a civil service that will not pro
vide life-long sinecures for one class to the
exclusion of another class that will not en
croach upon popular rights, individual sov
ereignty and majority home rule.
When such a new charter la presented us
for our adoption it may be certain of our in
dorsement and hearty co-opÂ»ration to make
San Francisco the model Democratic city of
not only the United States but of the whole
world. JOHN F. WBJTZEL, Secretary.
SENATOR SHINE TOOK
THE MARSHAL'S OATH.
SWORN IN BY UNITED STATES
DISTRICT JUDGE DE HAVEN.
The Civil Service Status of the Office
Deputies Now Before the United
States Supreme Court.
Senator John Shlno of Tuolumne County
was sworn in as United States Marshal
for the Northern District of California
by United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday. The new Marshal will not as
sume the duties of his office until the 29th
of this month, that being the time when
Marshal Baldwin's term will expire.
It is not known whether Marshal ShinÂ©
will make any changes in the personnel
of the office deputies, of which officers
there are five, viz.: Chief Office Deputy
A. L. Farlsh and Deputies Monckton,
Moffitt. L-ittlefleld and Gallagher. It Is
contended that office deputies of United
States Marshals aro protected by the
Civil service system, and a decision to
that effect has been {riven by a United
States court in the East, but the matter
is now pending before the Supreme Cou^t
of the United States.
Chief Deputy Farish has held the office
i for twelve years, and was highly com
i plimented recently on the neat and accu
! rate manner in which the accounts of
the office have been kept, the Department
of Justice at Washington having ex
pressed that opinion on more than one oc
casion within the past few years. The
remaining deputies have faithfully per
i formed their duties, and by their uniform
i courtesy have gained the good will of all
I persons having business with the office.
j They are naturally anxious for the deci
sion of the United States Supreme Court.
The position of stenographer, now filled
; by Miss Charlotte A. Schrage, was ere-
I ated under the civil service system four
i years ago, so that she is a pioneer in
' that capacity in the Marshal's office. She
! will not be affected by the change. She
: has given satisfaction in her position, and
I her four years of experience in the office
; will be of great benefit to the adminis
tration.
Soldiers at the Chutes.
The Chutes are a.nxlous to put a little
pleasure into the lives of the soldiers
now in the city, and so the hospitality of
the Haight street grounds has been ex
tended to every boy In blue now in San
Francisco and to all those expected. Ev
ery man wearing Uncle Sam's uniform
will be welcome at any and all times to
the grounds, theater and Zoo.

"landlords ARE
Disappearing.
Out in the Heyman Tract they have forgot-
ten that landlords ever existed. There are no
renters there. Every family In that prosper-
ous neighborhood owns its own home. The old
plan of renting benefited the landlord onlyâ
the new plan of buying your home on month-
ly Installments, the same amount that you
used to pay In rents, benefits you directly,
for each payment brings you nearer to the
time when you will have to pay no more.

tages, just completed in the Heyman Tract;

TEN THOUSAND
TROOPS IN CAMP
Continued from Page Seven.
THE WASHINGTON TROOPS.
Anxious to Go to the Philip-
pines, So Says Lieutenant-
Colonel Fife.
The report that the Washington volun
teers will not go to tho Philippines, but |
will be retained here for guard duty at i
various ooints on the Pacinc Coast, has j
had a dampening effect upon the ardor
of the men who enlistt-d in the hope of
going to the front at once at Manila. The
statement that the order was counter
manded on a request of the troops th^m
felves is branded as false, and informa
tion received yesterday afternoon shows
that Governor Rogers of Washington
knows nothing whatever of the matter
and is indignar.i over the change of pro
gramme. It la Intimated that if any
change has really been made Captain
Taylor, the mustering officer, i.Â« In some
way responsible for it, as his reports
have been of an unfavorable character
from the start.
"It was Governor Rogers' intention to
get the First Regiment of Washington
Volunteers to the front among the very
first," said lieutenant Colonel Fife yes
terday afternoon. "This regiment was
one of the first volunteer organizations
to go into camp. The majority of the
men are old National Guardsmen and |
many of the officers and soldiers have '
been in service on strikes and at the i
great Seattle fire and other important and '
eventful occasions. I know of no reason j
why the First Washington Regiment
should be held back. The officers are
nearly all men of experience. I am sure
that our men will average up with those
of any other regiment. I have no official
knowledge that we .ire to be held here
for guard duty. We can be easily
equipped for the Philippine expedition.
Every man that I know of Is anxious to
go to* the Philippines. I do not think there
is an organization that is in any health
ier or hardier condition. There is not a
sick man in it to-day. Our regiment is
composed largely of men who have had
outdoor occupations and exercise. There
are very few who have been engaged in
sedentary employments. I know that the
ambition of Governor Rogers is to have
this regiment among the first in the field.
When the men enlisted they fully under
stood that they were to go to the Philip
pines and every one seemed eager to go.
Of course" we expected the First Califor
nia would be the advance column, but
we hoped to be the second, and we think
we are entitled t<"> second place. If we
are pent to the front I am confident that
the Washington men will distinguish
themselves and be heard frnrn at the first
opportunity. It Is my opinion that, if
there has been any protest against our
going to Manila it certainly did not ema
nate from any of our officers or men. If
any man desires to be relieved from going
on the expedition we can easily let him
out. All we want is fair play in this mat
ter, as I know our regiment, is made up
of men who have the requisite soldierly
qualities."
The Third Battalion of the Washington
Volunteers will arrive in San Francisco
to-day on the steamship Puebla.
â -â¦- -
AT CAMP RICHMOND.
Four Thousand Five Hundred
Volunteers Are Now on the
Tented Field.
The old Bay District race-track grounds
have been transformed into a martial
fi e l(j_a city of tentsâ and is now known
as Camp Richmond, the camping place
of the volunteers for the Philippine ex
pedition.
There are now four full regiments and
one battalion quartered at Camp Rich
mond, making a total of about 4500 troops.
The grounds are admirably adapted for
a military camp, being level, divided into
convenient sections by fences enclosing
nine large blocks, all completely supplied
with water through pipes and hydrants
put In by the Spring Valley Water Com
pany during the last three days. The
soil is of a loose, sandy nature, easily
absorbing all surface water from any rain
fall that may occur. Besides, there are
ample sewerage facilities, which have
boon provided by the Crocker Land Com
pany, which owns and has improved the
Bay District tract. The sanitary condi
tion of the camp could not be better.
The First Nebraska Regiment of Volun
teen, under command of Colonel J. P.
Bratt. was the first to arrive at Camp
Richmond. The 1024 men are very com
fortably located, and are housed in tents
which "they brought with them. At regi
mental headquarters the officers have tel
ephone and telegraph instruments, which
will be in operation to-day. It is very
likely that the Nebra^a headquarters
will be made the headquarters of the
camp. This regiment Is equipped with
Springfield rifles of 45 caliber. The mas
cot of the regiment, an eagle named Ne
braska, presented by Hon. W. J. Bryan,
keeps a vigilant eye over the camp of the
Nebraskans.
The First Kansas, composed of 1054
men. commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Edward C. Little. Is camped on the block
directly south of the Nebraskans. They
arrived in three sections Friday evening,
and had their camp in good shape yes
terday afternoon. They are supplied with
Sihley tents, each tent accommodating
twenty men. As to tents, they are the
best equipped of any volunteers who
have yet arrived here. They were very
much pleased with their reception all
along the line, especially at Sacramento
and San Francisco The First Battalion
arrived at Camp Richmond In time Fri
day evening to pitch their tents and sleep
therein. The Second Battalion slept
without the shelter of tents, and the
Third Battalion passed the night in the
cars at Oakland The colonel of the Kan-I
sas regiment, Frank Funston.has been as
signed to duty on General Miles' staff.
The Minnesota volunteers, 1056 strong,
under command of Colonel Reeves, are
camped west of the Kansas regiment, and
are already perfectly "at home" in their
comfortable tents They are fairly well
equipped. Two cases of'metfsles have de
veloped among the Minnesotans, and they
have been sent to the hospital.
The First Colorado repriment marched
to the camp yesterday from the ferry by
way of Market and Geary streets, and
made a fine showing. The colonel is Ir
ving Hale. These men are very well
equipped, and have seen considerable ser
viceâin the I.rndville strike and the trou
bles at Bull Hill and Cripple Creek, with
in the last two years. They are located
west of the Nebfaskans.
The Wyoming battalion, consisting of
four companies, in command of Major F.
M. Foote, marched into camp yesterday
afternoon, and was assigned to quarters
ir: the block just north of the Coloradans.
The commnnd consists of 33S men and
fourteen officers.
The tents and equipage for two com
panies of Wyoming volunteers failed to
arrive at camp last night until after dark,
hence some of the men occupied a barn
of Warren & Malley on Fifth avenue and
others were quartered for the night In
Peter McHugh's barn, near Central ave
nue.
No rations have been issued to the Kan
sas. Minnesota, Colorado or Wyoming'
troops by the Government since their ar
rival, but they have sufficient from the
rations issued for the journey from their
respective States to last over some days.
The ladies of the Richmond District are
supplying the guards of the respective
regiments with delicacies.
Tiie colonel of the Twentieth Kansas
volunteers announces that there Is an op
portunity for musicians to enlist in that
regiment, as three vacancies exist In the
band.
The volunteers from Minnesota, Kan
sas, Colorado and Nebraska are well shel
tered at the camp. The rain produces
no hardship.
WILLING TO HELP.
An Incident Arouses a Desire to
Help in the Knights Templar.
How to provide for the Incoming troops
that the Government seems so powerless
to provide for was the subject of a con- ;
ference between the Mayor and a delega- j
tion from the Knights Templar yesterday, j
Mr. Phelan was asked what had been â 
done by the city and by himself toward
properly receiving the troops, and in re- j
ply he detailed tne work of the Red Cross
SÂ«x lety and also the fact that he had se- â 
cured bands, which meet every detach- i
ment and tscort it to its destination. He j
said the troops were arriving at all hours, j
despite the agreement of the railroad ,
company that no men should be sent ;
across the bay after 4 o'clock, and that j
as soon as any men arrived they were i
taKen in charge by the ladies of the Red
Cron Society and were cared for as well
as time and opportunity allowed.
The interest of the Knights was aroused
by a little episode related by Frank W.
Sumner at the banquet of Golden Gate
Commandery on Friday evening. Sumner
was on his way to the banquet and on
passing- down Jackson street he saw a
number of weary soldiers plodding over
the hill and evidently much confused as
to their location. He inquired and found
that they were in search of the race track i
and had been told to go over Post street.
How they came to c on Jackson street
they could not tell, except that they
were obeying orders as well as they :
could.
When Sumner reached the banquet hall
patriotic speeches were being made and
he was called on to speak. He took ad
vantage of ibv opportunity to tell what he [
had seen just before, and to call attention
to the need for a display of a little of that
hospitality f'>r which the city has so long â 
prided itself.
Simmer's remarks so stirred his hearers ]
that it was decided to do something in the <.
mutter at once, and as a consequence the !
following committee was appointed to!
take the matter in charge:
California Cnmmanderyâ John P. Fraser
(commander), J"hn Tonnlngsen, W. IT. Frank
Titus, H. B. Ream, Martin Jones, Hiram T.
Graves. A. A. Katkin, John K. Clark, Isaac .
Giant, Thomu.s Morton. C. W. Taber. Frank W.
Marston, James F. Logan, K. I. Hurlbut, J. !
M. Lltchfleld, Kugene N. Deuprey, George H.
Dyer.
Golden Ghk> < ummanderyâ Frank \V. Sum
ner, C. L. Field, Philip Code.
This committee called on the Mayor yes
terday, and various plans were discussed
for the reception of the troops. It was
suggested that the commanderies might ;
establish a cook shed and serve meals to j
the men, but their I'unds are not in a i
condition to stand such a drain, at least ]
for the present. It was finally suggested
by the Mayor that the gentlemen tender
their services to the ladies of the Red
Cn>s.s Society, with an offer to help in
any capacity, and this was acted upon.
After the merting in the Mayor's office
Judge Cook, with a number of the com
mittee, went to the ferry and reported to
the ladies of the Red Cross.
From the ferry the committee adjourned
to the Occidental Hotel, where further ar
rangements were made to assist the
ladies. Money is no object with the Ma
sons, as each man present expressed his
willingness to contribute sufficient to meet
all expense necessary for the object in
view.

War Incidents.
There was joy In the ranks of the volun
teers who hail from the sunny south
Friday, and Mrs. L. Thorn was over
whelmed with the thanks of a lot of
grateful volunteers. On Thursday Mrs.
Thorn took up a collection In her mili
nery establishment on Geary street with
the most gratifying results, and on Fri
day the donations were converted into
corned beef, tobacco, baked beans and
other army delicacies. Early in the after
noon the lady personally distributed a
truck load to the Californians, and she
Is prepared to treat the Nebraskana in
the same hospitable fashion to-day.
Company C, Seventh California Regi
ment of Volunteers, was substantially re
membered by the ladles during the past
week, and a grateful note of thanks from
the "boys," framed In white and gold, is
among the ladies' prized possessions.
The German General Benevolent So
ciety (German Hospital) at a directors'
meeting last evening passed a resolution
that all members and subscribers who
may have joined the volunteers during
the time of the war shall retain their full
membership without payment of dues.
At the annual meeting of the San Frau-
Cisco Fusileers, composed of exempt and
active members of Company I First In-Â»

were elected: President. J. Rinlen- vice
president P. H. Will; recording secretary,
J. D. Ralph: financial secretary. William

dues, fines and assessments of those who
are members of the Fusileers and have
enlisted be remitted until their return.
Yesterday afternoon a man answering:
to the name of Deane created a disturb
ance at the Presidio by attempting to
pass up one of the company streets after
having been forbidden to do so by the
guard. Lieutenant McGuerren, seeing
the trouble between the guard and the
civilian, took the matter into his hands
and when he found that the man would
not listen to reason ordered the guard to
run him out of camp at the point of. &
bayonet, and his order was obeyed.

A FAIR DEAL
The Rector Editor Sees
Some Small Politics.
GOES AFTER YON BOKELYN.
DECLARES HE IS I>foT THE BOSS
OF THE DIOCESE.
Sequel to the Sensation Raised at the
Diocesan Conference Recently
Held in San Fran
cisco.
â¢safcland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 21.
The little sensation created by Dr.
Marshal! Law In San Francisco last week
by charging that politics were being done,
has been supplemented by some direct
statements, made by the rector-editor,
affecting prominent members of St. An
drew's Episcopal Church.
The rector of the Church of the Advent,
in his published statement, openly asserts
that some enemy has made and circu
lated false figures and facts. The letter,
which will no doubt be iteresting to the
whole of the diocese, is as follows:
If you will glance at the names of the stand- :
ing committees and compare them with the
names of the delegates to the General Conven- ',
tion (aa reported on page 9 of the Pacific |
Churchman of May 15), you will see one of the
points which the rector had occasion to criti- :
cisc in the elections at the late convention. No
man ought to hold two of these most Import
ant positions when there are seventy good and
true clergymen in this diocese, and three times
as many laymen. Of course everything would
have been sweetly harmonious if the rector had
not the eftrontry to rise up and expose the
efforts which were being made to retire Mr.
\ a^entine (our senior warden), from the stand- ;
Ing committee, and put in his place the for
mer senior warden of St. John's, of St. Paul's
since the former church was burned. Per
sonally it would be much pleasanter not to fight
unfair methods, but when the wardens and
vestrymen of this parish are unfairly assailed
in their absence by such methods as were used
to get Mr. Valentine's naturally invincible
candidacy out of the way at this convention,
the rector will be on hand arid right in front
although a thousand regret the â¢â¢lack of har
mony in the closing hours of the convention.
One thing is certain, and that is that after the
rector had thrown a little light upon this "har
monious proceeding, Mr. Valentine was Im
mediately re-elected over Mr. Haven by a vote
? .1 "A or thereabouts. "What were the ob
jectionable methods?" somebody asks. Only the
innocent" report that Mr. Valentine had de
c.i..e<l to serve; that he was a hopeless invalid;
%- J?H T , \ n3 th 3 p ? st year he had nt attended
the meetings of the standing committee at all
therefore cast your vote for Mr. Haven."
.None of these statements so quietly and In
dustriously circulated are true. Mr. Valentine
has been sickâ who has not? He is off on an
Oriental voyage of business and pleasure com
binedâand who would not like to take a similar
trip 7 If * the re tor of the Advent had only
acquiesced after he found out that these things
were being said by the run-about button-hole
process of electioneering what a sweet-spirited
person he would have beenâ to be sure' And
.Jr. Haven could have taken Mr. Valentine's
piace without friction. We are not only In
debted to \V. A. M. yon Bokelyn largely for
circulating these reports (after working for
-Mr. \aientine last year), but also for Borne
other back-handed favors, which the parish
ought to know about. Our payments on
bishop s salary were tardy this year on account
of extra burdens In paying off church debt and
for improvements. So when the auditing com
mittee were gathering in the Occidental Hotel
a few days before the convention the rector
was there and told Mr. yon Bokelyn in the
lobby that we would be "all squared up" be
fore the convention opened. He replied "I
will remember that." Notwithstanding this
he circulated in an open session of the con- | :
vention a printed statement showing us to be 1
delinquent Jill on bishop's salary, which hnd ! i
been paid in mil to him before the convention
opened. The rector privately charged him '
with this and he said he would correct it ver- ;
bally in open convention, which he did not Ob
But worst of all, a whole week after the con- <
vention's close he mailed these same un- 1
changed reports, unauthorized by anybody, l
about the diocese, requesting those who re- |
ceived bunches of them to distribute the same. i
Mr. Read, our treasurer, got five of thÂ«-m.
For- 75 cents he could have made a printed .
correction of them if so disposed. Or he could
have drawn a pon through the whole line in
stead of coolly correcting an error In figures
in It as he did. Frankly, It is about time W.
A. M. yon Bokelyn was made to understand
that he is the servant, not the boss, of tills
diocese. â 
A DISAPPOINTED SOLDIER.
Planned His Wedding but at the Last
Moment the Girl Refuses.
ALAMEDA. May 21.â Dennis P. Quinlan
of this city, now a member of Battery H,
Third Artillery, at Fort Point, is a very
much disappointed man. He came over
to this city yesterday afternoon on a fur
lough, expecting to be married last even
ing to the girl of his choice, Maude E.
Allen, also of this city, and with whom he
had been acquainted for a long time.
The couple were engaged to be married
some time ago, but no definite time had
been set. Miss Allen has a stepfather,
and It Is said her engagement to Quinlan
was opposed by him and her mother. This
made matters unpleasant for the girl at
home. A few days ago it reached such a
pass that she wrote to l^uinlan telling him
she was ready to marry him at any time.
But Quinlan was in the hospital with an
injured arm at the time and did not re-
Ely. In two or throe days he got out,
owever, and at once set about making
preparations for the wedding, obtaining
the license and engaging the minister.
Yesterday he came over to carry out his
plans, but to his disappointment found
that his fiancee had changed her mind
and now concluded she did not want to
marry a man who was about to be or
dered away on service. All Quinlan's
persuasive powers had no effect, and after
trying in vain to get her to change her
mind he went back to his barracks still
a bachelor.

THE FIFTH'S LOSS.
Adjutant D. A. Smith's Companions
Congratulate Him Upon His
Appointment.
OAKLAND, May 21.-The local mem

surprised to hear that Colonel Smith of
the First Infantry California Volunteers
had appointed the g-allant adjutant of the
Fifth, Captain D. A. Smith, to the posi

many other officers who are yearning to
have their swords accepted In the defense

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
tude to Colonel Smith In bestowing such
great honor on one of their officers. Ho
is certainly one of the most enthusiastic
and best-known officers in the National
Guard of California, and is a most daring
horseman. He is of a modest and unas
suming disposition, and. like most great
soldiers, is a man of very few words.
He will have a most responsible position
to fill as ordnance officer, and will have
in liis personal charge the ammunition of
the raiment. With his well-known en
thusiasm, he will, no doubt, have many
opportunities to distinguish himself in the
face of the enemy. While the tilth re
grets the loss of such an enthusiastic
officer, it was de..g-.ted to hear of his

of incalculable value to it, and possibly
his new colonel will find him .even more
valuable than he was to the Ilrtn.

BANDIT AT BAY.
Minnesota Troops Have a
Taste of Uncle Collis'
Methods.
No regiment will go to Manila better
equipped or be better cared for after it
lands at the Philippines than the Thir
teenth Minnesota, which arrived yester
day.
Before starting on its lor.gr campaign the
citizens of that State equipped the men
throughout, including shoes, undercloth
ing and other necessaries. Even the
tents are new, as well as all other camp
equipage and blankets. Moreover, the
regiment will have a tidy sum to draw on
for incidentals when it reaches Its des
tination; James J. Hill, the president of
the Great Northern road, has cabled to a
Hongkong bank placing $7500 on deposit
for the regiment, and the citizens of Min
neapolis, when they learned of the rail
road man's splendid gift, uupllcated the
sum, so there is now $15,000 awaiting the
Thirteenth in the Orient.
Luring the Civil War Minnesota fur
nished twelve regiments of volunteers,
and when the call for troops came a few
weeks ago and that State was required
to furnish three regiments, instead of re
taining the numerical dr Mgnations by
which they were known as national
guardsmen, the three bodies mustered
into the volunteer service were renum
bered, continuing from the regiments fur
nished during the Civil War. The Twelfth
and Fourteenth regiments have been or
dered to Ghiekamauga. Th^men in the
Thirteenth were somewhatuntasy at first
over thc-ir number, but they believe now
that thirteen is their lucky number. It is
rc-markablo how that number is identi
fied with the regiment. It was ordered
to San Francisco on Friday, May 13, and
Colonel Reeve's father formerly com
manded the Thirteenth United States In
fantry. While on the road a cyclone
swept between the third and fourth sec
tions of the train, the third section barely
escaping disaster. The regiment arrived
here with thirteen men sick.
The regiment includes sume of the most
pruminent business and professional men
in the State. Captain Carriston is a lead
ing attorney; Major Bean resigned the
Shrievalty of St. Paul County to remain
with the regiment, and the ranks are tilled
with men of means and high social stand
ing. Company D won the prize for the
best drilled company at the National
Guard tournament at New Orleans, last
year.
At Ogden, the Minnesotans had their
first bout with Southern Pacific minions,
find the encounter raised a vivid com
parison between the generosity of "Jim" j
Hill, Minnesota's railroad magnate, and j
the brigandage of Uncle Collis. Attached J
to the section bearing Major Diggles'.. bat
talion was a stock car containing the
horses of the Held and staff officers.
Transportation had been contracted for
right through to San Francisco, but the
outlaw who acts as agent for the enra
pany at Offden presented a new contract
to Major Diggles and demanded $5u a<i<ii
tlonal f'>r the stock car. Major Diggles
protested, but the agent was obdurate.
Captain Carriston, the- legal luminary of
Minneapolis, quoted law in his innocence.
It was the first time he had been in a
hold-up, and he was not expected to
know that footpads laugh at the law. The
bandit merely reiterated his demand for
the $50, backing it up with the threat
that the train could not move until it
was paid.
Major Diggles refused to be robbed,
however, and finally ran a bluff which
worked to a charm. Turning to his order
ly, he dispatched him for two men in the
regiment whom he named. They soon
appeared and the officer coolly inforirn'fl
the agent that they were experienced
train men and would take charge of the
train. Then he ordered the men to climb
onto the engine and run the train through
to Oakland. "And if anybody attempts
to interfere with you." he added, "kill
him."
The railroad official surrendered and
promised to send the train through with
out further delay. He kept his promise.
Accompanying the regiment is Mrs.
Reeves, wife of the colonel, and several
newspaper correspondents.

DIED WHEN RECOVERY SEEMED TO BE NEAR.
OAKLAND, May 21.â William L. Prather, for many years secretary of the
Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institute at Berkeley, died at his home in this city
this morning. Mr. Prather has lived an interesting life of 72 years and was born
In Kentucky. Forty-seven years ago he married the lady who still survives
him. His early life was spent in the tobacco planting industry, and in 1872 he
came to California. He became interested in the development of the tulo lands
along the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and dredged and reclaimed some
large tracts. Later he went into the insurance business in this city, and the
family is one of the most prominent in the county. Mr. Prather always kept out
of politics, and was so fond of home life that he did not take membership in any
lodge or club. His children are: Thomas Prather, Samuel D. Prather, Miss
Laura D. Prather, Mrs. H. East Miller, Mrs. Harrison Clay and "W. L. Prather
Jr. Mr. Prather had only been sick a month and his recovery was supposed to
be certain, when additional complications arose, causing death.
GROWERS ASK
GOOD PRICES
Prospect of Fruit Crop
in Alameda County.
CANNERS NOT IN A HURRY.
APRICOTS WILL COMMAND A
HIGH FIGURE.
â¢
Rain Has Hurt the Hay, but It Has
Guaranteed a Good Crop
of Sugar Beets *at
Alvarado.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 21.
In spite of the many drawbacks of the
last few weeks, the fruit crop of Alameda
County will be a medium one. During the
past week the first raspberries and cur
rants have been shipped to market from
San Leandro. Late cherries bid fair to
be of the usual size.
The rains have done considerable dam
age to the hay which hod been cut, and
many cherries of the Rockport and Gov
ernor Wood varieties are badly cracked.
The first currants brought $1 75 per box
of 10 pounds, and were in the market a
week earlier than last year, when they
brought $1 60.
The orchardlsts who are fortunate
enough to have apricots are holding out
for good prices. About $50 per ton is the
price that is expected for them, but the
cannere and their agents Bay that $40 a
ton is enough. A few years ago $40 was
the regular price, and growers now de
clare that if they hold out they will get
their price, as the crop is light. The apri
cots seem to have suffered more than any
other truit.
The San Leandro Reporter says:
The cherry growers are contident that the
cunning of the canners will prove that the
cherry growers are pretty sharp themselves.
The canners are endeavoring to create the Im
pression that they do not care to pay the
reasonable prices asked and they name prices
below the figure which it would cost to pick
the fruit and market it. Nevertheless their
agents have instructions to let them know
when a sale has been made. Some outside
canners have about closed contracts at very
fair prices and it looks as though the sharp
San Francisco combination will lose the- cron.
Some of the fruit transportation companion
nave guaranteed some of the growers 3 cents
a pound. This will result in large shipments
East, and with the small crop in thin section
the canners will be lucky if they don't pay
fancy prices before the season is over.
The contract for the construction of the
new cannery at San Leandro -is not yet
signed, and Is waiting on the payment of
subscriptions. It is important that the
promises be redeemed as soon as pos
sible, as only a few weeks are left the
committee in which to sign the final
agreement which will add another indus
try to the town. The committee desires
all subscribers who can now pay not to
wait until the last moment.
Information from the beet-gTOwing dis
tricts is to the effect that the late rain
has insured a large crop, so that the op
erations of the Alvarado factory this year
will be on a large scale.
Norton Is Heard From.
OAKLAND, May 21.â Mrs. Norton, wife
of the manager of the Galindo Hotel, re
ceived a letter from her husband to-day
which clears up his hurried departure.
Mr Norton Is now on his way to New
York, and will leave for home next Tues
day. He says' a big mining deal In which
he is interested, necessitates his travel
ing considerably at present, but the pros
pects are good for making a rich haul.

APPRECIATIVE SOLDIERS.
Visiting Regiments Thankful
to the Red Cross So
ciety.
There Is no lack of gratitude among
the volunteers who arrived in this city
during the past few days for the kind
and royal reception received at the hands
of the Red Cross Society. The cheerful
surprise that awaited their disembark
ment from the ferry-boats, ending as it
did a tiresome Journey of many hundred
miles, led them to give expression to
their appreciation in cheers and letters
of thankfulness. The latest communica
tion received was from the officers and
men of the Nebraska troops, and reads
as follows:
Headquarters Coagpany G, First Regiment
Nebraska Volunteers.
To the Ladies of the Red Cross Society of
San Francisco, Cal. : We, members of the Ne
braska Volunteers, Company G, First Regi
ment of Infantry, desire to express our thanks
tv the ladies of the Red Cross Society of San
Francisco for the kind and benevolent treat
ment received at their hands on our arrival
in this city.
The boys of Company G will long remember
the kindness received. Should they be so for
tunate to be called to a foreign port for actuul
service, the rweeteet remembrance of San
Francisco will come to them as the showers
and summer sunshine come to the waiting
blossom. T. A. WILLIAMS, Captain.
CLAUD H. OXJOH, First Lieut.
B. FISHER. Second Lieut.
Twenty-six hundred men, composing
regiments from Wyoming, Nebraska, Col
orado and Minnesota, were refreshed at
the ferry by the ladies of the Red Cross.
Oakland is anxious to share In the good
work. Mrs. Requa, the well-known so
ciety lender of that city, has gathered
around her a number of pretty girls and
will establish a large table at the ferry.
The French Hospital voluuteered to
take care of those who have been taken
sick and are being attended by the Red
Cross Society. Its offer was accepted
and six patients were sent to its insti
tution.
On Decoration day the Ladies' Boston
Vaudeville Company will give an enter
tainment in Central Park. Besides giv
ing fifty vaudeville acts the entertain
ment will conclude with a realistic pic

The following: patriotic letter was re
ceived from the, Gleaners' Club of 621
O'Farrell street:
At the regular meeting of thÂ« Gleaners' Club
Monday, May 16, it was decided by unanimous
vote to send to the ReO Cross Society JlO from
the club treasury fund to be used in the care
of sick and wounded in the present war with
Spain. This small donation is the gift of girls
who are in the midst of the fierce fight for
daily bread and f'>r stan<l!ng--room In the
world. Girls who can appreciate the sacri
fices of a soldier's life because of the dally
sacrifice they are making in the same fierce
marts of trade and field of toll; girls whose
patriotism is of, that broadly humane kind
which covers all sacrifice, of suffering in
causes of righteousness in every land. The
patriotism which stands by its own country
because its banner symbolizes liberty and Jus
tice to all nations and because it promises the
same to its own children.
Trusting our small offering may not be de
spised, we are sincerely and loyally,
THE GLEANERS' CLUB,
Per Cora A. Moss.
There Is no abatement in the number of
money contributions. The society reported
a fund of nearly JIS.OOO yesterday, and it
will not be k<ng when the $20,000 mark is
reached. The important subscriptions
yesterday were: Cox Seed and Plant
I'ompany, $23; Dr. M. Herzstein. Miss

houses yesterday. Court Golden West,
Foresters of America, last evening sent
$10 as a. donation to the Red Cross So
ciety, the good work of which was com
mended at the time the motion was made
for the donation.
An emergency committee consisting of
about twenty-five members of the Red
Cross Society of Oakland was organized
this morning under the direct supervision
of Mrs. I. L. Reuua and Mrs. F. M.
Smith.
The cause of this move was the infor
mation given them that 3000 soldier* had
remained in this city over night and left
this morning without a bite to eat.
The ladies soon arranged to provide an
Oakland table at the ferry depot in San
Francisco. Many volunteered to furnish
sandwiches and other necessaries in
abundance, and a request was made to
Oaklanders going to the city to carry
flowers and supplies and leave them in
the depot.
The ladles In charge of the matter are
Mrs. I. L. Remia, Mrs. F. M. Smith Mrs.
Major O. F. Long, Mrs. Wallace Ever
son, Mrs. A. B. Ny9i Mrs. Lieutenant
Dunwoody, Mrs. A. D. Thomson, Mrs.
Paul Losee, Miss Mary Keeno, Mrs. S.
M. Martin and Miss Veitch.
Should soldiers have to remain in the
cars on the switches overnight again
this committee will see that they are
given coffee and sandwiches before they
leave here. They have arranged to feed
incoming trainloads of soldiers at the
mole on this side from 7 to 12 o'clock to
morrow. Lunches should be sent down
early.
The Red Cross Society has determined
that none of our soldiers shall go to the
Philippines in ignorance of the dangers
which they will have to encounter. Ow
ing: to the sudden change from a tem
perate to a tropical clime many of the
men may suffer from their own Inexper
ience or rashness. By way of instruction
Mr. Rose-Soley, at the request of the ex
ecutive committee, has compiled a folder
vhlch each man leaving for the Phil
ippines will carry. Upon this little leaf
let instructions are given for stopping
bleeding by applying a tournlque.t, and
the course of the arteries througn the
human body is shown.
There are also a number of practical
hints which will serve to maintain the
soldiers' health in the tropics, instruc
tions for making stretchers, dealing with
cases of sunstroke, poisoning, etc. Yes
terday the executive committee of the
Red Cross Society accepted the offer of
Messrs. Spauldlng of Clay Street to print
the first 10,000 of these leaflets, and care
will be taken to have a copy handed to
each man who leaves for Manila.
Yachtsmen's Hop Put Off.
Owing to the rain the hop of the San
Francisco Yacht Club programmed ior
last night at Sausallto did not take place,
the house committee in charge of the en
tertainment thinking it better to defer it
to some more genial evening. The tug
Sea Queen that had been chartered to
convey guests from the city to Sausalito
at 7:30, and to start back from Sausallto
at 11, was countermanded. About a score
of people who had assembled at the Mis
sion-street wharf with the intention of
taking the tug were disappointed.

Much Hearsay Evidence Is Admitted
Against the Fair Plaintiff
to Help Out the
Defendant.
OAKLAND, May 21.â The fourth ses
sion of the investigation into the charges
against Superintendent George Xall of
the Thirty-fourth-street Methodist Epis
copal Church was held to-night, and most
of the testimony went to prove that Mrs.
Long was of questionahle character. This,
of course, was given by her enemies, and
is fully refuted by others. The publica
tion of the amended answer in this morn
ing's Call surprised the good brethren,
and they imagined that Attorney Talcott
was to blame for it. He was as surprised
as they when he learned that it was out.
To-night's witnesses were C. J. Tyme-
Bon, Mr. Chrissinger, Mrs. D. F. Young,
Mr. Nail, Mr. Level, Mrs. Armstrong,
Charles Armstrong's mother, and Mrs.
Ida B. Armstrong, his wife, the last two
named being the only ones to give any
sensational testimony.
The mother was asked: "Do you know
anything against Mrs. Hattie Long's
character?" , ,
E. S. Finch, one of the board, asked:
"These charges are against Mr. Nail;
what difference does it make what her
character is? Did Nail or did he not make
any improper proposals to her?" -
Rev. Van Every, representing the de
fendant, replied: "We propose to show,
if we are allowed to, that she is of a
loose character and has been running
around with various men."
In order to ascertain whether it was
admissible testimony. Mrs. Long's stand
ing in the church had to be ascertained.
Rev. E. F. Brown testified that she had
withdrawn while in good standing and
was not a member now. Then Airs.
Armstrong was allowed to answer. She
said :
"I know nothing."
She then proceeded to tell what she had
heard.
Mrs. Ida Armstrong said: "Mrs. Long
went out to where my husband was at
work and asked for him. I object to any
woman of her character calling- on him."
Rev. Kovard asked: "Did you ever say
that if you had Mrs. Long in your power
you would pull heir hair out?"
"Yes, I did," she snapped, "and I'd do it,
too." As all joined in the laugh, she de
clared that Mr. Nail never said at Mr.
Brown's that he had proposed to Mrs.
Long a trip to the Cliff, but that he did
say that Mrs. Long made the proposal
iind kept at It.
At 11 o'clock an adjournment was taken
until Monday night, when it is believed
that a verdict will be reached.
George Long, whose wife is the chief
witness in the Thirty-fourth Street M. E.
Church investigation now being held, de
clares that his first impulse when told
of Nail's proposal was to kill him. but he
will now only act upon the defensive.
When asked what he had told the board
of Inquiry, Mr. Long said:
"I simply answered their questions and
told of what my wife had said after Nail
and Armstrong had been to see her. She
came to me immediately with her story,
and my first impulse was to kill the
blackguards, but friends persuaded me
from my purpose, saying that I would
run my neck into a halter without doing
anybody any good. I wished to avoid
subjecting my wife to the unenviable
notoriety. I do not blame Nail so much
as I do* Armstrong. I believe he Is a
snake in the grass, and put Nail up to
do this thing.
"Do you know," continued Long, point
ing with his cane to the little building,
"that I used to belong to that church?
Yes; one ill fatod day I was induced to
join the thing, but it took me only a
short while to learn that I could be a
better Christian by staying at home. The
place is full of backbiting hypocrites, and
I am done forever with this so-called re-
Ugfon I really think, though, that
Brown Is a great deal better than the
people who are talking about him."
When asked if he had a revolver Long
answered:
"It is too late now for that. I ought
to have killed him when I first heard
about htm approaching my wife, but that
was a long while ago. I would have done
it then if they had only left me alone."

BUSH STREET BOULEVARD.
Property Owners Are Still Laboring
to Defeat the Scheme.
David Rich, as president of the Bush
street Improvement Club, has forwarded
a communication to the Supervisors giv
ing reasons why the street should not be
declared a boulevard. In the communi
cation several reasons are advanced,
among which Is the expense of repaying
and repairing the street, the total of
which amounts to $46,185- In conclusion
he says:
Your petitioner begs leave to Inform your
honorable board that the cost of doing said
work will be fifteen (15) cents per
square foot, the contractor to take the cob
bles and basalt blocks.
In presenting these figures to your honorable
board, your petitioner begÃ leave to advise you
that the sentiment agralnst what appears to
be your contemplated action in making a so
called "boulevard" of Hush street, has not in
any way changed and that the property owners
have formed an organization to continue the
active opposition to the "boulevard scheme"
for the reason that they believe it is injurious
to their property, and should not be paawifl by
your honorable board. All of which is re
spectfully submitted.
Interfered With an Officer.
Frank Abrian. a butcher, was arrested
last night for interfering with Officer Mc-
Entee. The latter had Jack Tomalty in
custody for disturbing the peace, and was
on his way to the patrol box, when Ab
rian and the prisonfr's father attempted
tc release the prisoner. They threw Mc-
Er,tee to the ground and tried to relieve
him of his club and pistol, but McEntee
proved a big undertaking 1 . He struck .-j
rian over the head with a club, inflicting
a deep gash. Abruin was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, whore the wound was
dressed, and then lodged In the city
prison along with the man he tried to
rescue. The elder Tomaliy escaped ar
rest, but will be taken in charge on Mon
day, when a warrant will be sworn out
for his arrest.
United States Gunboat Alert Here.
The United States gunboat Alert, com
manded by Captain Leutze, reached port
yesterday afternoon and anchored in the
bay at the foot of Harrison street. The
Alert is one of the old wooden vessels of
the navy. She has been at Panama and
cruising in the Pacific for some time, and
as she came north touched at various
points. The last place was S.an Diego,
from which port she made the run in
three days.
Street Cars Collide.
Owing to slippery rails there was a
collision between cars on the Turk and
O'Farrell street lines yesterday. The elec
tric car was nearing Jones street when
the motorman saw the cable car in his
path. He attempted to stop, but the
brakes would not hold and the cars
crashed together. The passengers re
ceived a shaking up, but luckily no one
was seriously injured.

EXTRAORDINARY
POWER GIVEN THE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Comprehensive Facts Culled From
the Proposed New Charter
for the Guidance of
Citizens.
The extraordinary powers granted
the Mayor by the provisions of the new
charter form the strongest argument
that can be urged against the adop
tion of the proposed organic law.
Probably not more than one man out
of every ten who will go to the polls
to cast a vote for or against the char
ter has more than a vague idea of the
extent of the authority given the
Mayor by the new law. Even those who
have carefully perused every section of
the instrument cannot carry in their
minds more than a general idea of the
power granted the Mayor by its pro
visions.
For the benefit of those who have
sufficient regard for their citizenship
to wish to know the facts regarding a
matter that vitally affects the future
welfare of the city the following ex
tracts from the proposed charter, hav
ing reference to the powers of the May
or, have been made:
He appoints:
The Board of Education, consisting
of four School Directors, at salaries of
$3000 each per annum.
The Civil Service Commission, con
sisting of three persons at salaries of
$1200 each per annum.
The Board of Health, consisting of
seven persons, five of whom are ap
pointed by the Mayor. The other two
members are the Chief of Police and
the president of the Board of Public
"Works, to serve without compensation.
The Board of Election Commission
ers, consisting of five persons at sala
ries of $1000 each per annum.
The Board of Park Commissioners,
consisting of five persons to serve with
out compensation.
The Board of Fire Commissioners,
consisting of four persons at salaries
of $1200 each per annum.
The Board of Police Commissioners,
consisting of four persons at saJaries of
$1200 each per annum.
The Board of Public Works, consist
ing of three persons at salaries of $4000
each per annum.
TO VETO ANT BILL OR RESOLU
TION :
Providing for any specific improve
ment.
Providing for granting any fran
chise or privilege.
Providing for the lease, appropria
tion or disposition of public property, i
Providing for the expenditures of
sums of $200 or over.
Providing for levying any tax or as
sessment.
Providing for imposition of a new
duty or penalty.
TO VETO erne or more Items sepa
rately in the appropriation of money
or in fixing a tax levy. On such vetoes,
unless they are overruled by fourteen
out of thf eighteen members of the
Board of Supervisors, the vetoes are
sustained.
DEMANDS for more than $200 shall
be presented to the Mayor for his ap
proval.
RESOLUTIONS directing the pay
ment <-'i money (other than salaries or
wages) when the amount exceeds $500
shall be published for five successive
days. These two provisions are con
tradictory of Section 13, page 6.
MAYOR'S APPROPRIATION of
$3600 per annum to be made, for which
he need furnish no vouchers of the
expenditures.
MAYOR TO PASS on sufficiency of
sureties on bonds on the report of the
Finance Committee of the Supervisors,
which must be investigated every six
months.
MAYOR in the event of a misde
meanor or a defalcation of an officer
may suspend the officer, etc.
MAYOR TO APPROVE bonds ac
companying bids for street railroad
franchises. *!;â¢-
MAYOR TO APPROVE ordinance
granting railroad franchise. In case of
veto it requires the vote of fifteen Su
pervisors out of the eighteen to over
rule the veto. After bids are called
for, received and passed upon ninety
days must intervene between the in
troduction and the final passage of the
ordinance.
MAYOR HAS POWER to postpone
final action on any franchise that may
be passed by the Supervisors until
such proposed franchise shall be rati
fied or rejected by a majority of the
ADVERTISEMENTS.

ton. About three years ago my son brought
home a box of Cdticora (ointment), and I
picked up the circular that was around it, and
learned about the Ccticdra' Soap, and told
him to get me a cake. When I got it, the cir-
cular advised its use for the bath, teeth, scalp,
etc. I had been a great sufferer all my life
from sore eyelids, the whole lid outside and in
was red as a beet. I had to sit in a dark room,
evenings, for eight and a half years, and wear
black spectacles to keep the sun from my eyes
in the daytime. When I got the Cdticura
Soap, I got a fine, soft cloth, dipped it in hot
water and rubbed it on the soap and washed
my eyes with it. I can't tell you how much
good it has done me, although it smarted
very much at first. My eyes are as clear and
bright as when I was a young lady. I had to
go backwards in getting spectacles and wear
No. 15, the same as I did twenty years ago, 1
can read medium sized print in daylight with,
out any spectacles. As a matter of course lam
kind of a walking advertisement of Cdticdba.
People will call to me when I am going along
the street and tell me how much good my
Ccticcba Soap has done their eyes.

YELLOW POSTAL FAKE
OFFICIALLY EXPOSED.
GEO. W. BEAVERS DENOUNCES
AN EXAMINER FALSEHOOD.
He Did Not Come Here Unannounced,
and Was on a Regular Tour
of Annual Inspection.
The Examiner yesterday morning con
vulsed the Postofflce officials with merri
ment by printing 1 an attempted sensa
tional story to the effect that the arrival
of George W. Beavers, chief of the Post
office salary and allowance division, had
thrown postal employes into a fever of
excitement, not to say apprehension. The
I fake went on to state that Mr. Beaver
sneaked into the city about a month ago
and eluded the argus-eyed hotel reporters
by taking a suite of rooms at the Palace
f Hotel and by neglecting to register.
The fact of the matter is that Mr. Bea
[ vers arrived in this city on the evening
of May 17, anil his arrival was noted in
I The Call the next morning. He at once
I called upon Postmaster Montague and in
quired of him as to the wants of the San
| Frajicisco office. He came here in the
I course of his usual routine duties, and,
; after the customary Inspection of the
i books, complimented Mr. Montague high
: ly upon the efficient manner in which his
: office has been and is being conducted.
Mr. Beavers said further that he would
do everything in his power to prevent the
, lowering of the appropriation for the San
i Francisco office, and that he would rec
j ommend the increase of the appropriation
in several particulars.
He denounced the Examiner article as a
falsehood pure and simple, with no basis
whatever. He is not a secret agent in any
senpo of the words, and does not sneak in
; or out of towns spying upon Postmasters,
i If thp writer of the Examiner article were
1 not donsc-ly ignorant of Federal affairs
' he would know that the secret service
i work in postofflces is done by postal in
j spectors.
PATRIOTISM IN COURT.
I Judges Joachimsen and Low Imbued
With the Prevalent Enthusiasm.
Because throe boys cheered the incom
ing troops on Geary street, near Rich
mond, Friday night. Policeman T. Fell
arrested them and booked them on a
charge of disturbing the rjeace. Their
names are Richard Walsh, H^nry Dosher
and William Fredericks. They appeared
before Judge Joachimsen yesterday morn
ing, accompanied by their parents. The
policeman testified that the boys were
jeering at the soldiers, but the boys said
they were cheering them and yelling,
"Down with Spain!" The Judge, after
reprimanding the officer, discharged the
boys and told them to cheer as much as
they liked.
John Mullen appeared before Judge Low
yesterday to answer a charge of robbery.
The complaining witness, Kdward Good,
a sailor, testified that he had been drink
ing with Mullen and did not know how
he had lost his watch. He might have
dropped it and Mullen had picked it up.
Mullen told the Judge that he wan chief
cook on the City of Sydney and was going
to Manila. The Judge remarked that he
did not believe that any robbery was com
mitted and he told Mullen to go back to
his ship and treat the boys well on the
â¢voyage.
Of Public Interest.
During an Interview Mrs. O. T. Mor
rlll of 207 Jones street stated she suf
fered several years from cancer of the
breast, doctoring and trying every
known remedy without avail. Hearing
of Dr. chamley, the Cancpj Specialist
of 17 Third street, she went to him for
treatment and In two weeks a two and
a half pound cancer was painlessly re
moved by the doctor and the cure was
po complete that she says: "You can't
put it too strongly for me, and to help
Buffering humanity I willingly testify
to its efficacy."
Another lady who consulted Dr.
Chamley was Mrs. L,undahl of 517
Shotwell street, who is most enthusi
astic over the cure effected in her case,
declaring her life was saved, and asks
any one interested to call and see her.
A cancer had been cut from the top of
her head, but had returned and was
growing so large and fast tltat Dr.
Chamley feared he would fail, yet in
two months it was removed, leaving
only a small scar.

mors Cured Without Knife or Pain,"

ROBBED HIS
VICTIM AS
HE SLEPT
Bold Crime of a Daring
"Porch-Climber."
SECURED VALUABLE BOOTY.
HE ENTERS THE RESIDENCE
OF DAVID CTTLLEN.
The Police Say He Is the Elusive
Burglar Who Operated in
San Francisco Last
Winter.
The daring 1 "porch climber," who
gave the police so much trouble last
winter, is again at work. ' During the
past week he has entered at least a
half-dozen houses and got away with
considerable property. His latest vic
tim is David Cullen, who lives at 1717
Ellis street.
Some time after midnight Friday the
bold burglar entered Cullen's room
through an open window and while his
victim slept he searched his clothing,
securing a gold watch and $25 in money.
His presence failed to disturb his
sleeping victim and it was not until
Cullen awakened after daybreak that
he discovered that he had been robbed.
Last night he reported the occurrence
to the police and Detectives Bee and
Harper were sent to make an Investi
gation. They found that the nocturnal
visitor had gained an entrance to the
house by climbing one of the supports
of the upper porch. Finding the win
dow of Cullen's room partly open he
raised it sufficiently to allow him to
enter.
The police are unusually reticent
about the operations of the daring
burglar and refuse to give the list of
houses entered by him. Last night
Captain Wright, acting under instruc
tions from Chief Lees, issued written
instructions to the different captains
to keep a sharp lookout for the porch
climber. The instructions were trans
mitted to the patrolmen of the various
stations, and every effort will now be
made to effect his capture.
During the short *ime that the dar
ing porch climber op?rated here last
winter the police admit that he got
away with considerable money and
jewelry. His scheme Is to pick out the
house "that he intends to enter, and
after waiting until the patrolman on
the beat is about to report off he
climbs to the parch and quietly enters.
The operator became so bold that
the head of the Police Department es
tablished a blockade, but, despite the
vigilance of the officers, he continued
unmolested. Several times he was de
tected burglarizing a house by one of
the occupants, but managed to es
cape. Just before the daring porch
climber disappeared from the city he
was caught in the act of entering a
house in the Mission district, and sev
eral shots were fired at him. He es
caped uninjured, and, realizing that
the police were hot after him, he left
the city.
From the description given of the
work of the man who entered the resi
dence of Mr. ('ullen the police are con
vinced that he is the daring poroh
climber who operated in this city last
winter.
BURGLAR'S AGAIN AT WORK.
Clothing and Jewelry Stolen From
Baum's Tailoring Establishment.
The store of Moritz Baum, a tailor, at
fioi O'Farrell street, was entered by
thieves on Friday night and about $150
worth of clothing and jewelry stolen.
The burglars effected an entrance by
forcing the front dor of the establishment
with a jimmy.
A Mother.s Fear of the Spaniards.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday heard argument in the matter
of the habeas corpus proceeding on be
half of James Mullaly and Edward M.
Bnypnn of the First Regiment of Cali
fornia Volunteer*, who are under mili
tary arrest for enlisting on the fraudu
lent statement that they were 21 years
old, when, in fact, they were only 20.
The matter will be decided next Thurs
day. The mother of young Bnysnn went
into hysterics in the courtroom aÂ»nd de
clared between sobs that they were go
ing to tako her boy to the Philippines
to be slaughtered. Lieutenant "West as
sured her that the boy would be kept in
the guardhouse at the Presidio and would
not be sent a way.
Two More Concerts.
The third concert of the Knplsei quar
tet, from the Roston Symphony^ Orches
tra, served ti"> crowd Sherman, flay &
Cn.'s Hall yesterday afternoon. So great
has been the success of these artists
since their arrival here that Manager
Marks has folded to postpone their
Portland engagement, and two additional
concerts will be given next Thursday
afternoon and Friday evening at the
same hall. On Thursday the Dvorak
quartet will he repeated, and Alwin
Sohroeder, the great cellist, will play two
solos. On Friday Franz Knetsel will be
the poloist. The sale of seats will begin
to-morrow at Sherman, Clay & Co.'s.
The Plea Was Weak.
Fong Hong was convicted of the crime
of arson in the first degree. He appealed
the case to the Supreme Court, and one
point made in his appeal was decidedly
out of the common. His attorney took the
position that "It is not arson to burn
one's own building," therefore it was in
cumbent upon the prosecution to prove
that the defendant was not licensed to
destroy the building in the manner set
forth. The Supreme Court did not see
that this argument could be applied to
the case, and the judgment of the lower
court was affirmed.
The Bush-Street Pavement.
An estimatp of the cost of paving Bush
street for a boulevard was submitted to
the Supervisors by the property owners
yesterday. The estimate makes it $36,607
for the tearing up of those blocks now
paved with basalt and repavlng them with
noiseless pavement, and $10,121 for filling
up the ruts left by the tracks of the old
car line and repairing such suitable pave
ment as is already down. The petition
ers also repeated their former demand
that the street be not declared a boule
vard before the street had been put in
suitable condition.

AN UNCERTAIN RECEPTION.
FATTED CALF IN NO DANGER
OF DEATH.
Both Governor Budd and Mayor
Fhelan Said to Be Leagued
Against the Congressman
From the Fourth.
There Is considerable agitation In the
Democratic camp on account of the an
nouncement that Congressman Maguire
will soon visit San Francisco for the pur
pose of giving greeting to his late con
stituents.
The announcement has caused some
comment among Californians who are
patriotic enough to . believe that in the
present war crisis the place for a Con
gressman is at his post of duty, rather
than at home mending political fences.
It may be that those who hold to this
opinion overlook the fact that it will
require about five months for the states
man to explain why he called American
seamen pirates. This calculation does not
take into account explanations that may
have to be made regarding his introduc
tion of a single tax war revenue bill. As
the coming election is to be held early
in November, it can be readily seen that
the time at his disposal is somewhat lim
ited.
If present indications count for any
thing, Maguire's home coming will not be
j made the occasion for the slaughter of
: any fatted calves by the local Democracy.
I His erstwhile friends, the reformers, are
just at present engaged in a struggle for
existence â a struggle that Maguire's pres
ence will more /than likely render futile.
There are several reasons for this, and
all of them are good ones. The reform
ers are led by Mayor Phelan, who is
credited with having a secret understand
ing with Governor Budd, the opposing
leader. The understanding is that if Budd
I will assist in bringing about the adoption
of the proposed charter Phelan will ask
to be elected Mayor under its provisions.
In return for this aid Phelan will lend
his political followers to Budd for the
purpose cf defeating the gubernatorial
aspirations of Maguire. In the event of a
defeat of the proposed charter all bets
will be declared off and Phelan will try
to win for himself the place at the head
of the State ticket. It will be seen, there
fore, that no matter how the tide turns
Maguire need not expect aid or comfort
from the Phelan Democrats. It is also
apparent that he stands about as much
show of rounding up the Budd contingent
of the local Democracy as the Spanish
do of capturing Chicago.
While Maguire has been creating trou
ble for himself, some of his rivals in the
Democratic fold have been sawing con
siderable wood. Frank Gould, for in
stance, has not been letting any moss ac
cumulate on the rolling stone of his polit
ical ambition. Some time ago he an
nounced that he was forced to refrain
from declaring himself in the race for the
high honor of appearing before the Demo
cratic convention as an aspirant for the .
nomination for Governor because he felt j
that he could not afford the expense of
such a campaign. He added, as a Saving
clause, that if it should so happen that the
convention demanded that he accept the
nomination he would not refuse it. It is
not without the range of possibility that
he will be confronted with such a demand.
He is certainly not throwing any obstacles
in the way of those who are trying to
bring about such a condition of things. It
was Gould who introduced the resolution
in the Democratic State Central Commit
tee providing that the basis of represen
tation of the various counties at the con
vention should be the vote cast for Bryan
Instead of the vote cast for Budd. This
was a nail in Maguire's coffin, as it re
duced the representation from San Fran
cisco and increased it in the interior,
where thÂ« Congressman's single tax doc
trines are not i.eld in great esteem. Gould
is also a membei of the committee of nine
having in charge the task of adjusting
the differences among the local Demo
crats. It is not to be presemed that he
will lend his voice to any agreement that
will prove of benefit to Maguire.
Lieutenant Governor Jeter is also tak
ing advantage of the situation to promote
his boom for Governor. He has the advan
tage of a great personal popularity and
has never given voice to any incendiary
utterances against the nation's defenders.
Recent events have served to blast the
hopes of at least one Democratic aspir
ant to gubernatorial honors. Railroad
Commissioner I>a Rue allowed CWlis P.
Huntinpton to escape over the State line,
and now he despairs of his ability to
make it plain to the voters of the btate
that he did not connive at the clandes
tine departure of thp railroad magnate.
It is Paid that he contemplates givng the
glad hand to Maguire upon the latter s
arrival in this city. A consolation handi
cap will then be in order.

on one side of a pape. and then pasted
together the two blank pages to give

Heroic Services of Major Belle Reynolds.
SOME OF TriE MOST EVENTFUL SCENES IN THE LIFE OF MRS. REYNOLDS WHEN AS A YOUNG BRIDE SHE ACCOMPANIED HER HUSBAND TO THE FRONT IN THE WAR OF 1861.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., May 20,
1898. â The only woman who was
ever commissioned regularly in
the United States army is Major
Arabella Macomber Reynolds.
She is a distinct and conspicuous fig
ure In the annals of the war. Com
paratively few veterans of the Rebel
lion saw so much of the horrors at the
conflict as she. Her services are men
tioned twice in General Sherman's
memoirs, and several pages regarding
the services of Major Reynolds are to
be found in the "Official Record of the
Armies of Illinois in the Civil Con
flict."
Major Reynolds is better known in
military circles in the West as Major
Belle Reynolds. She lives in Santa
Barbara and is invited to attend all
Grand Army of the Republic encamp
ments and veteran reunions held west
of the Rocky Mountains. She is now
the president of the Women's Parlia
ment of Southern California,
When President Harrison was in
Santa. Barbara in 1891 he paid more
attention to M^jor Belle Reynolds than
to any of the hundreds of political
leaders and rich men of California who
gathered, around him.
Major Reynolds' maiden name was
Arabella Maromber. She was born in
Shelburne Falls, Mass., in 1843. Wh-n
ehe was 14 years old she moved with
her parents to lowa, which was then
a wild and unsettled country. Two
years later she went East to complete
her education, and upon her return
taught the first school in Cass County,
lowa. In April, IS6O, she was married
to John G. Reynolds, and with him she
moved to Peoria, 111. Rumors of thr>
war were already rife, and on the first
anniversary" of her wedding day the
North was thrilled with the news that
Fort Sumter had been fired on. Mr.
Reynolds, having determined some
time before to be the first to enlist in
case of war, was among the first four
men enrolled in Peoria, enlisting among
the Seventeenth Illinois Volunteers
three months men, and soon was or
dered to- the front.
In the following August Mrs. Rey
nolds decided to Join her husband, who
How to Succeed as an Author :By William Dean Howells.
MT regular procedure Js first to
select the topic of the story.
This is usually something that
has occurred to me, perhaps
years before, and that has
been developed by occasionally think
ing about it.
The next step is the selection of char
acters, which is the matter of greatest
care and study, and I never map out
the exact course of the story in ad
vance. Naturally I have a more or lens
distinct notion of hew it is to go, but I
find that after I begin writing one
chapter suggests another and the story
grows of itself.
Do I receive requests for advice from
young writers? Very often, ana if the
number of such Inquiries coming to me
affords any Indication there is no dan
ger of the extinction of the American
novel, of which some critics seem to be
afraid.
There isn't much that can be said to
these young aspirants for literary fame.
The beet advice I know is: "Go ahead,
do your best, write the truth that you
have as you see It; and if one other per
pon feels and appreciates it as you do
the effort will not have been wasted."
was then in camp at Birds Point, Mo.
Friends and relatives by the score ad
vised and entreated the young bride
to keep at home and not take the aw
ful risks of a soldier in the flel<i. But
it was all to no avail. She arrived in
camp on the 11th. Three days later
orders came to- break camp and she
went along.
She was but 19â tall, handsome and
vivacious. The whole camp was de
lighted to have her there, and among
the sick and wounded her presence was
as a visit from a guardian angel. The
officers begged her to accept better and
different fare than theirs, but she de
clined, preferring to accept the lot of
her husband and to be where she
might do the most good in the cause
fi-r which her husband and the other
soldier boys had enlisted. She ate the
same food as did the soldiers, kept on
the ground for days at a time, drank
from pools and brooks as did the poor
est private, and never murmured at
forty or fifty mile furred marches. Sh
was busy all day long with her needle
and thread for the soldiers and passed
many nights with the sick and wound
ed soldiers. Her letters to newspapers
;it the North did incalculable good in
informing the Union women what they
might do in alleviating the hardships
and suffering of thr- boys at the front.
"Hundreds of soldiers," wrote Gen
eral Rawllns to Governor Yates. of
Illinois, "will never forget the work of
charity and bravery that Mrs. Rey
nolds is doing, single-handed, these
days. I know of no woman who is
helping the sick and melancholy sol
dier boys like this brave young? woman
â scarcely more than a schoolgirl."
A few years ago General Lew Wal
lace wrote in a war article in the Cen
tury Magazine: "The Union troops at
Shiloh blessed the day that the wife of
Colonel John G. Reynolds came among
them."
At Cape Girardeau the regiment went
Into garrison duty for a month or so.
The battle of Fredericktown followed.
and in it Mrs. Reynolds tasted for the
first time the horrors of war. During
the battlesheremained in the rear, suf
fering the anguish of uncertainty as to
the fate of her husband. Twice there
came the news that her husband had
been mortally wounded at the front,
but later she found the report was
false.
When the battle was over she went
on the field, ministering to the needs of
M riting is so different from other
kinds of work, it depends so much upon
individual character and habits of mind
that it is impossible to lay down any
hard and fast rules In relation to it. No
sooner have you done so than somebody
violates them all and still comes out on
top. Still it may bo possible for an old
stager, who has kept in more or less
intimate touch with the literary world
for a good many years to say a word or
two, chiefly in the way of encouraging
and reassuring the beginner, that will
not be wasted.
I will not attempt to instruct the be
ginner as to how to prepare himself or
herself (we mustn't forget the "her" in
this) for writing. As I said before, liter
ature is bound by no hard and fast
rules. There is no set of books, as in
law or engineering, from which one
.must get his first principles. I don't
mean that an acquaintance with the
best writing is of no value, but of vast
ly greater importance is the ability
and habit of observing the life that ex
ists about one, which nobody has yet
put into a book.
If the young person we are discuss
ing has the gifts of mind which will
make him a successful writer these
qualities may be safely left to indicate
the course which his "preparation"
shall take. Only in. this way can varie
the pick and dying. She was the first
mi on the Qeld, and the good she
did there is inexpressible. The official
war dispatches to Washington all told
of her labors for the wounded and
dying, and Horace Ofeeley wrote a
stirring editorial in the New York
Tribune concerning her patriotism and
goodness. For three days and nights
she worked hourly with the wounded
and dying. She made no distinction be
i the blue and the gray, and it
seems that she, as well as Miss Barton,
might well lay claim to having been the
first to initiate the individual work
based on no lofty scheme of action, but
merely the faithful following of a
tender-hearted woman's instincts.
Within nine days â on February 6.
1862 â came the battle of Fort Henry on
the Tennessee River. Mrs. Reynolds
was a witness to that engagement. She
paw Commodore Foote's gunboats pour
shot and shell into Fort Henry, while
General Grant's Illinois soldiers ad
vanced to victory by land. It was bitter
cold weather. Mrs. Reynolds worked
for a week with but a few hours' sleep
and without removing her clothing,
among the hundreds of soldiers that
crowded the 1 capitals. She on her own
responsibility organized a corps of
young people, whose duty was to cheer
the last hours of the dying.
Almost immediately the Seventeenth
of Illinois was ordered to move south
ward. The great camp was full of ex
citement. Mrs. Reynolds' request to go
with the troops to what every one felt
was to be the mightiest battle in the
West was denied. The officers believed
the campaign was too rapid and severe
for any woman. So, while the Illinois
regiments marched hastily away, with
no camp outfits or .extra bag-gage of
any description Mrs. Reynolds re
mained at Fort Henry and labored for
the comfort of the mÂ«Â»n in the hospitals.
A week later, February 18, 1882, the
news of Grant's and Hunter's wonder
ful victory at Fort Don-elson on the
Cumberland River thrilled the North
as much as the news of the battle at
Manila has, and Mrs. Reynolds hast
ened there with all speed to help the
soldier boys. There were over 900
wounded in the hospitals and in the
country homes of that locality, and the
woman â then Just 20 years old â threw
all her vigor into her hospital service.
She was relieved on March 22, and
went southward to join in the fortunes
of the camp of the Seventeenth Illi
ty, originality and strength be pre
served in our literature.
From this you may see that I am
not one of those who constantly uphold
the classic standards as models for the
young literary workers. I guess that
fact is well enough known to those who
are sufficiently acquainted with me to
be interested In what I say. The nat
ural development of the novel has been
from the classic, through the romantic,
to the naturalistic. I like the latter
term better than realistic because real
ism, in the minds of many persons, is
associated with what is sordid and un
pleasant.
(if course that isn't true, for reality
has its cheerful and encouraging sides
as well as the reverse. Realism or nat
uralism being the present, and per
haps the permanent, garb of the novel
in its highest form, it follows that the
writer's only textbook which he must
never disregard, is life, life in so-me one
of its infinite phases. Sincerity is the
great essential. Truth is the one motto
that the young writer should put in
big letters above his desk. Ro long as
he conforms to that his work cannot be
wholly lost.
The tendency of recent years has
been, I think, toward naturalism. By
that I do not mean that it has com
manded the greatest number of read
nois. Those were great days in war
fare. The army of the Southwest was
massing 40,000 strong at Shiloh Church,
near Pittsburg Landing. The Confed
erates, 60,000 strong, under Generals
Albert Sidney Johnston and Beaure
gard, were coming from the South. The
belief that a tremendous battle was at
hand was shared by every one. Three
weeks before Shiloh was fought Mrs.
Reynolds met her husband in camp.
Colonel Reynolds had meanwhile been
made assistant adjutant general upon
McClernands staff. Here in camp, in
sufficiently fed, through chill and frost
and rain, the troops slt-pt on the
ground, and Mrs. Reynolds shared the
common lot- It is a wonder that all did
not die of pneumonia. There were
sounds of cannonading and skirmishes
in the locality of the camp every day.
There were signs that the battle might
begin at any hour. Mrs. Reynolds never
left the camp.
On Sunday, the morning of the 6th of
April, she procured a can of peaches
and some fiVur from the sutler and be
gan to prepare a feast for herself and
husband over the open mmpfire burn
ing In fmnt <<f th^ headquarters. For
\ eks B desultory firing had been kf>pt
up between the two armies, which
were drawn up facing each ot;iÂ»r and
when this firing Increased no attention
\v;is paid to the circumstances until an
orderly dashed into carr>i>. bringing In
formation that the rebels had made an
attack In force, and conveying orders
for the Seventeenth to fall in and move
forward. The camp was instantly ex
Â«.it>'d. Mrs. Reynolds emptied the con
tents of her frying pan into her hus
band's haversack as he came out of
the tent ready for the advance.
"Here, take these; you will need
them." she said.
â¢'I don't know where I'll find you
when this thins? is over, Kelle," he re
marked, anxiously, to his wife.
"Oh, I'll remain here if possible." she
replied, cheerfully, "and if I'm not here
I'll be on the quartermaster's boat."
Sunday, April T. night darkness set
tled down with the Northern troops
panic stricken. It was necessary to
arm those on board tlie boats to pre
vent them from being overrun with un
hurt men fleeing to them for shelter.
Mrs. Reynolds, by the order of Captain
Norton, stood guard, armed with a re
volver, which she was pledged only to
shoot In the air. Later that night the
ers. Mankind, at least the majority
of him, is conservative, sticks to ac
cepted standards, demands the same
kind of food that he has been accus
tomed to.
Kut I think it an evidence of ad
vanced and educated literary taste that
the most intelligent element of the
reading public now demands, not an
absorbing story, but a strong delinea
tion of character, a bit of nature or life
transplanted to the pages of a book. It
is well for the young writer to get it
thoroughly settled in his mind that no
body in the future will be reckoned
great who is false to humanity and that
there is no true picture of life which is
not, by that fact, a work of art. The
question for the writer to ask himself
constantly and searchingly in contem
plating his work is, "Is It true â true
to the thoughts and principles that
shape life?"
As an example of the tendency to
subordinate plot take Tolstoi, who is,
perhaps, the greatest of realists. Some
of his stories are scarcely more than
exquisite delineations of character and
motives and yet they are masterpieces
of fiction.

boatload. of wounded was conveyed to
â  Savannah. Another load was taken
on during the night, and on Monday
morning the boat returned for its third
: load. ; ; v All night Mrs. Reynolds and
other devoted patriots worked without
rest to alleviate the suffering . of the
'wounded. ' '
Monday night came the news that the
rebels had been beaten and were in
retreat toward Corinth. The dead on
both Bides numbered 4300 and there
were Over 9000 Union and Confederate
wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel Smith,
who brought the tidings, was also the
bearer of a message to Mrs. Reynolds
from her husband, the first she had re
ceived since he went into action. Col
onel Smith and his men were literally
starving. None of them had partaken'
of food since Sunday morning, anÂ«l
some of them had not tasted a crumb
since 'Saturday night. Mrs. Reynolds
had no authority to give out stores, but
she knew where some nice loaves of
bread had pone into a locker on the
steamer. She broke open th locker,
seized a bifurcated garment that she
found among sanitary commission
stores, tied a knot in each leg, jammed
these improvised receptacles full of
loaves, and dragged It to Colonel
Smith, who threw It across his horse
and galloped off to his famishing men.
Tuesday morning was clear and
cloudless. Mrs. Reynolds, Mrs. Nor
ton and Mrs. Cunningham, a profes
sional nurse, ho had in the meantime
arrived, left the boat and made their
way between the dead of both armies
to the little log church of Shiloh, which
had been turned into a hospital, and
presented a ghastly sight. Here the
army surgeons were at work In the
small anteroom attached to the church,
their nporntlne t^ble being Improvised
of a nlank rÂ»InrÂ»Â«l across two barrels.
It was a fris-htful pÂ»Â»no. Strops meT*
could not look upon it. On the. floor of
the church were men writhing and
cursing and pleading for water, which
nobody had undertaken to bring. Mrs.
Reynolds stepped outside and called fo>
volunteers to go with her to the river
for water. Fifteen soldiers responded,
and at the boat they were furnished
with buckets, coffee and hardtack, not
the prescribed diet for invalids, but. a
blessing to the wounded, many of whom
were starving. That night the women
returned to the boat, which had taken
on another load. The next day these
horrible scenes were repeated.
comes from his own individuality.
When our young person sets out in a
serious attempt to write, having fully
absorbed, let us say, the life about him,
he is surprised to find that it is hard
work He decides that he cannot hope
to become great for he has been taught
that the great writer, the genius in lit
erature, throws off his masterpieces
without an effort. I know of nothing
more discouraging to the young writer
than this genius theory, and for the re
lief of any to whom it still exists as a
bugaboo, I will say that I am pretty
sure it's a myth. The only genius
ivorth talking about in writing as in
everything else is the genius of hard
work.
Of course brains are necessary and
not all men have the mental equipment
to become successful authors, but the
idea that good literature comes as a
sort of heaven-sent inspiration is erro
neous. Not to mention myself, I can
say from my acquaintance with suc
cessful authors, that most of the good
literature of recent years has been
ground out by painstaking and labori
ous work. I suspect that the same
thing would be found to be true of
earlier writer*, had there been news
papers and reviews to probe Into their
daily lives and habits of work.
Closely akin to this genius delusion
ESOLD!
When Sunday came once more, Mrs.
Reynolds hart not been in bed for seven
nights and .lays. The little rest she had
caught had been while sitting with her
head restiner for a few minutes on th"
rail of the boat, when she would be
again mused to care for i le wounded.
On this day Governor Totes of Illinois
arrived, accompanied by a corps of
physicians. Among the latier were Drs.
Guth and Colburn a* Feoria. her home,
men who had known her a year before
as a blooming bride. They were shocked
by her changed and haggard appear
ance, and insiste' upon her returning
home for rest.
Too worn ou' h.nd feebl- for resist
ance, she assented to the plans they
made for her to return on the following
day with the tri:' â  i tori â¢' party In the
steamer Black Haw!:. Twenty mem
bers of her husba id's regiment, all of
them severely wounded and some of
them going to die, were on the steamer.
Naturally the battle of Pi'sburg Land
ing, of which she had been an eye
witness, was the chief topic of con
versation. She was called upon to ans
wer many technical questions, and gave'
such an accurate description of the en
gagement that Governor Yates of Illi
nois (the man who gave General Grant
his first commission in the war of the
Rebellion) exclaimed as sue concluded:
"Why this woman is more deserving
of a commission than half of the men
who have them."
"Why not Rive her a commission,
then?" asked Dr. Colburn.
Governor Yates called for a blank
commission and for a pen and ink. Of
this document, which is registered in
the Illinois State House, the following
is a copy:
SPRINGFIELD. 111., April X 1862.
To All to Whom These Presents Shall
Comeâ Greeting:
Know ye. that Mrs. Bf>lle Reynolds,
having been duly appointed to the hon
orary position of "Daughter of the Reg
iment" for meritorious conduct in camp
and on the bloody field of Pittsburg Land
ing, I, Richard Yates, Governor of the
State of Illinois ami commander-in-chief
of the Illinois State Militia, for and on
behalf of the people of said State, do com
mission her to take rank as major from
the "th day of April, 1862.
She is. therefore, carefully and dili
gently to discharge the duties nf said of
fice by doing and performing all manner
of things thereunto belonging, and I do
strictly require all officers and soldiers
under her command to be obedient to her
orders, and she is to obey all such or
is the idea that a man can write with
gond results only when the fit is on him.
This is a lazy man's theory, but it is
easy for a young author to persuade
himself into it. The only way for a
writer to accomplish anything Is to set
aside certain hours of the day (not too
many) for his work, and devote him
self to the work then as completely as
though he were in an office or a factory.
It may be hard at first, but he will soon
become accustomed to it. and will grow
into the habit of working at that
time.
I don't believe in trying to write so
many hundred words every day, but if
the writer devotes a certain amount of
time to his task, even if he does not ac
complish much at each Bitting, he will
find the results mounting up in a sat
isfactory way. The man who waits
for inspiration is likely to wait a long
time for recognition.
I don't believe that a writer should
try to lose himself in his story, as is so
often recommended. The advice sounds
well, but it isn't sound. I hold that
the greatest actor is the one who
never forgets himself, and so it is in
writing. The author should stand con
stantly In the attitude of critic and in
quire, "Is this true? Is it the way

Two weeks later, rested but far from
recruited, she returned to the corps.
General McClernand used to tell of the
scene in the camp of Illinois volunteers
the day the first woman commissioned
in an American war (perhaps in the
world) showed her commission to the
soldier boys. There was a shouting
and a yelling with delight, and over
3000 of the soldiers marched past IfaJ *
Belle Reynolds' tent and saluted her ai
they passed.
It was several years before Major
Reynolds recovered from the shock and
exposure she underwent that spring of
â¢specially in the week succeeding
Shiloh. Although an Invalid and un
able to minister to the wants of the
soldiers in camp where she was, she
remained with her husband until the
fall of IM>4. She saw I ore t the mighty
events in American history. Shf heard,
the cannonading on th' 1 .Mississippi and
the crash of mm ketry in the dozen
skirmishes thnt led up to the taking of
Vicksburg. She was close to the bat
tle of Champion Hill where the Grant
army defeated Pemberton and his Con
federate forces with a terrible loss of
life. She was with the Seventeenth
Illinois when it advanced with Grant
toward Vicksburg. Although an invalid
ate hardtack without a murmurand
often thought a blanket on the ground
a luxury for one in the ranks. She was
very ill when the final bombardment of
Yirkshurg beeran. but she kept posted
on every movement of the Union
troops Vicksburg wafl surrendered by
General Pemberton on July 4. 1563. and
on Tuesday, the 6th. she entered the
city with the conquering hosts.
In spite of the entreaties of her
friends in Illinois Major Reynolds re
mained with the Seventeenth Illinois.
Her relatives urged her to abandon her
life amid scenes of carnage and go
home. But she felt that she h^d a mis
sion to perform at the front of war.
She was the soldier boys' comrade,
their friend and fellow soldier, and they
stood on no ceremony with her, al
though she was a major. Yet she ex
erted the strongest and the most cheer
ing influence upon them because of this
very feeling of comradeship. She was
the soldier's comforter and counselor.
All through the war she sat many an
hour with a sick and wounded man
until death or health relieved him.
Once when she had almost yielded to
the entreaty of her sisters to go home
General L. E. Ross wrote to her:
"I wish you would stay if you pos

under such circumstances?" He should
have all his characters clearly delin
eated. They should stand out plainly
before his mind's eye. But, after all,
they are the creations of his own indi
viduality, and must remain so, if the
story is to be worth anything.
As to the best time and the best way
to work each man must decide for him
self. I used to do most of my work at
night, a survival of the newspaper
habit, I suppose. But now I have
changed to the morning, and nearly all
my work is done before the noon hour.
I think that that is really the best time,
that a man's mind is fresher and more
vigorous then. In composing I generally
use a pen, because I want to see the
last w-ord or sentence I have written,
where careful thought is involved and
I am going slowly. But I have a type
writer In my study, and when I see
plain sailing ahead I turn to that.
I may say, too, that my greatest dif
ficulty, and one that I probably share
with many other writers, is in making
a beginning. It is mighty hard work
sometimes to start a story that will al
ways carry itself along once it is under
way.
It is often said that too many books
are written nowadays. I don't agree
with that.18
/am opposed to the annexation of
the Philippines because it would
mean a reversal of the traditions of
our Government, an increase of our
army, centralization of Government
and higher taxation. â Chauncey Depew.
IF we should keep the Philippine
Islands we would reverse the tra
ditions of this Government from
its foundation. We would open up
a new line of policy. Let us see
what that would mean In the first
place it would mean the establishment
of a military government over possibly
ten millions of people 6000 miles away
from us; it would mean the increase
of our navy to the navy of France or
Germany.
It would mean the increase of our
army to 150,000â more likely to 200,000
men. It would mean the increase of
our annual expenditures to double what
they are now. It would mean that the
United States Government would be
brought in closer contact with the peo
ple than ever before in the history of
this country-
We have known that there is a Fed
eral Government only as representing
our flag, our nationality and glorious
traditions, but we have not felt the
burden of its support or been con
fronted with the possibility of the
payment of an enormous annual mili
tary tax except during the Civil War.
In Europe, where great armies and
navies are maintained, the people are
taxed directly for their maintenance.
Our revenues have been obtained here
tofore by indirect taxation, with the
exception of a slight tax on whisky.
But with the increase o-f our expen
ditures by 100 per cent the taxes to
support the Government would be felt
in our homes and in our offices. We
should feel them in both the neces
saries and the luxuries of life â in our
homes, in our tools, in our food, in our
:-l( 'thing, in our carriages and in our
svagons; in our checks and notes and
bonds and transfers of propertyâ in
every transaction of every-day busi
ness life. For if we are to maintain
armies and navies like the pow
ers of Europe we must raise the reve
nue for them by the means mentioned
and also by a stamp tax that will face
us at every turn.
These conditions are contrary to cur
present form of government. To-day
we know that the customs collector
exists. He sits in his office at the cus
tom-house, and few of us ever think
of him â fewer still have ever seen him
or felt the taxes collected through him.
Under the new regime tax collectors
wuuid necessarily be excise men, with
offices everywhere. They would be
known not only in New York and the
other great centers of commerce, but
in every town, village and hamlet In
the United States. Our people respond
with patriotic alacrity to every bur
den, sacrifice or tax for the successful
carrying c-n of war. Whether they
would with e<iual cheerfulness do the
same for the new policy of the colonial
empire furnishes food for considera
tion.
What else does a world-wide policy
mean to us? It means a centralization

lations of the United States to the

these populous colonies would be cen

beyond imagining that they could form
a representative government on our 4
lines of universal suffrage, for they are 1
not like the people of Cuba, capable ofi
self-government. They are semi-bar-,
barous Malays and savage tribes, whose
only knowledge of government is that'
of an autocratic chief. <
Spain has not made the Philippines'
productive. Perhaps that is due to<
Spain's form of colonial government. <
So far, I believe, they have enriched (
only the officials and a Governor-Gen
eral. But the taxes have been raised"
by enforced taxation, upheld by mili-<
tary rule. And still Spain herself, I(
learn, has found her dependencies for (
several years an actual source of loss;
but then there has been great corrup
tion in Spanish officials. <
It is possible that we could hardly C
civilize the people of the Philippines mc
a hundred years and make them self-c
governing. Meantime we would haye Â£
to keep an army of 50,000 men on the
islands to hold them in check. Â£
Some one has suggested that theC
Philippines could be made a district^
like Alaska.
The conditions are wholly different.
Alaska is governed as a district be
cause it has no population, or at least^
the population is inconsiderable. Touc
have there a territory adjunct to vs c
nearly as great as the whole United
States and a population of about 5000. c
In the Philippines you have a popula-C
tion of ten millions in a country olderc
in settlement than ours, and still the_
people are not fit to be admitted as
citizens of a territory of the United 0
States or to send Representatives to theo
Senate as a State. o

There are those who claim that the :

as much as the people of Cuba, and.
that we are as much bound in morality

Ido not think so. In the first place,;

with her. For three years we have
sat by and seen her people struggling

up helpless within Spanish fortified

have intervened to rescue them because

SPAIN AND THE MEN WE ARE FIGHTING.
o S~\ NE fact that needs to be appre-
I elated in order to understand
I the situation in the present war
\^J between the United States and
Spain is the difference in the
Â°extent and accuracy of the information
0 which each country possesses in regard
Oto the other.
3 Americans are, as a rule, well read
3 and well informed. They don't know
0 all about Spain, but they know in a
0 more or less general way of its extent
3 and its resources. They know, too,
D something of the habits and character
_of the people. A good many of them
have actually visited Spain and have
D seen the country for themselves; near
ly all the others have read about it. To
3be sure, I think the ideas which our
3 people have formed regarding Spain
3 are not altogether accurate.
3 We are apt to regard the upper
j classes of Spain as ignorant, lazy and
j worthless and to believe that the rest
jOf the nation Is made up of bull-flght
ers and muleteers who are good for lit
tle else. As a matter of fact, the re-
} sources of Spain are apt to prove sur
prisingly gTeat, considering the desper
>ate condition in which she is now
'placed, and the average Spaniard,
> though he may be averse to ordinary
,labor, looks upon fighting as an honor
able and worthy employment, and gen
erally has enjoyed some training for
it. Mind, I am not casting doubt on
'the result of the present war; it can
have but one ending. "What I may say
is that we must not expect Spain to
crumble to pieces at the first touch of
a hostile nation. The fully Informed
people of this country do not expect
that, but they realize that Spain is
immeasurably weaker that the United
States. In general, the ideas in regard
to our opponent which prevail in this
country are pretty accurate^
When one turns to Spain,' however,
JOHN SHERMAN AGREES
The Ex-Secretary of State Approves
Mr. Depew's Views on the
Philippines.
WASHINGTON^. C. May, 1898.â
In my judgment we ought not to em
barrass .ourselves with the ownership of
the Philippine Islands, distant so far ;
from the United States. I concur in the
opinion expressed by Mr. Depew and :
have always opposed the accession of]
any outlying territory, the defense of]
which might be embarrassing to our.
country. JOHN SHERMAN. '.
Why, trade them for something that
we want. Or, if Spain should recognize
the inevitable before long and come to
us saying: "We will release Cuba;
European nations have agreed to help
us out on the pledge of these islands,
with the war indemnity you demand;
we will repay you now." Then we

the situation is very different. The
people of Spain, taken en masse, are
not well educated or widely traveled,
and they are particularly ignorant as
to what this particular part of the
world is like. Even those whom one
would expect to find well posted in this
particular cherish singular delusions.
That these incorrect ideas persist is
due, I believe, to the fact that they
are constantly put forward by the edi
tors of newspapers and the civil lead
ers who know them to be false.
One cannot avoid the conclusion that
there is systematic and willful misrep
resentation of the United States on the
part of the Spanish leaders. Why this
is so is hard to say, but it accounts for
the general misinformation that ob
tains throughout Spain on this partic
ular subject. Well-educated Spaniards
believe that there is a small cultured
class in the United States, but that as
a nation we are made up chiefly of
shop-keepers and ditch-diggers.
They have been told over and over
again that we have no courage, that
we are afraid to fight, that our navy is
useless, or nearly so. and that our lead
ers are all blowhard politicians. Nat
urally they have come to believe this,
and so confidently expect to whip us.
As for the lower classes, they actual
ly believe that the principal industry of
America is the raising of hogs, and at
the word Americanos they conjure up
visions of swine herders and their
droves.
One or two instances will give a bet
ter idea of these popular misconcep
tions. A comic paper has just been
started in Madrid. It is called "The
Porker" and is devoted to the ridicule
of Americans. The title does not seem
at all crude or exaggerated to the av
erage Spaniard, I'll warrant. The other
day the Spanish press printed a report
that the savages of Ohio and Illinois
had risen and that all the regular
troops would hav â¢:â  to be called from
the seaboard to quell the outbreak.
From what I know of the state of
public information in Madrid I dare
say this story didn't raise a smile of
incredulity in all the capital unless it
was in the case of seme American born
iÂ«thls, we must adopt the Eastern policy
Kof the nations of Europe and utilize
fc our conquest by further expansions.
It Already with England they have be
lc gun to divide up China. England's
policy is the policy "of the open door.
Russia, France and Germany have
taken slices of China and said that
'these territories and their ports would
cbe closed to the commerce of other
= nations. If we are to become a great
: trading nation like England, we, too,
. must pick out our port in China and
.seize, fortify and hold it. Then, from
\ that naval and military port, we must
; begin to build railroads into the in
: terior and thus open up to our goods
; markets among the Asiatics. We cer
: tainly cannot be dependent for our
; Asiatic port on the friendship ~6f Eng
. land, and we must be ready to say to
Continental Europe that we want our
fair share of the East or we will fight
for it.
I certainly think It would be possi
ble to reserve a coaling station for our*
selves in the Philippines and thus avoid
this international complication.
There are something like a thousand
islands there, I believe. All we need
to do before we hand the islands over
to some other nation is to pick out the
island that we want for a coaliner sta
resident. It seems to be the settled (
policy of the Spanish officials and
newspapers to increase rather than to*
dispel this iernorance. Therefore the<
Spanish people are likely to experience <
a rude awakening before this war is,
over, an awakening that may be
fraught with danger to these same of- (
ficials. (
At the same time I believe that those {
who expect Spain to yield the present
contest without a struggle are badly c
mistaken. The Spaniard is really a c
desperate fighter when he is pushed c
to it.
What^ Spain has done toward quell
ing the"* insurrection in Cuba is not to*
be taken as a fair test of what she cane
do in an extremity. There may have c
been sufficient reasons why the Span
ish generals did not wish to bring the c
Cuban war to a speedy end, and anyC
way in that contest the Spanish na- <
tion has not been straining every nerve
as they will against the United States.
The Spaniard's boast about shedding C
the last drop of blood in defense of hisc
country's honor may be partly bun
combe, but it is not altogether with
out foundation. C
Some of the wars between the South c
American countries, whose people are_
of Spanish blood, give instances of this
desperate species of bravery. In theC
war between Chile and Peru, after thee
Chilean vessel had been sunk and whileÂ©
her crew were struggling in the water,
they still fought with their knives 0
against the Peruvians who came too
rescue them and died rather than ac- o
cept aid at the hands of their enemies.
I have been asked if I think that theÂ°
present plan of raising an army byO
calling out the national militia will pro- o
vide a more efficient force than the
North had at its command at the be
ginning of the Civil War. O
The conditions are widely different, q
biit they are alike in this: At the be
ginning of the Civil War it was neces
sary to make an army and now it isO
necessary to make' an army. Thereo
was militia to be called on then as_
now. Perhaps it is a little more num

better equipped now. O

I am opposed to the permanent oc
cupation of the Philippine Islands, or
any other conquests that may accrue
to us through war.
We could not govern the millions or
people on the Philippine Islands by the
laws of our country. They are entire
ly dissimilar in every respect. And It
would be out of the question for us to
colonize the islands with white labor
from this country, because they could
not stand the climate.
From a commercial point of view
there would be advantages in the per
manent possession of the islands, but
to my mind these advantages are far
more than counterbalanced by the dis
advantages.
I think the wiser plan would be to
follow the principles of our forefathers.

The policy of holding any conquests
we may make in this war is destined
to gather very great force and may
carry the country off its feet, reverse
our historic policy and eventually
change our entire system of govern
ment.
The evils that lie in it in the future
may be wisely avoided by abstaining
from making this a war of conquest.
The destruction of the Spanish fleet at
Manila was necessary for the protec
tion of our Pacific Coast. The tem
porary occupation of Philippine points
that can serve Spain as her naval base
is also necessary to protect the Pa
cific Coast.
The permanent occupation of the
Philippines with the duty of civilizing
their ten millions of half savages in a
climate in which the Anglo-Saxon race
cannot flourish is a policy that should
not be thought of.

BY SENATOR WILLIAM E. CHANDLER.
SENATOR WILLIAM E. CHANDLER of Now Hampshire Is one of the
few men at the front of public life at the capital to-day who were ac
tive as young men In the larger war days of what Horace Greeley aptly
called "the great conflict." He was conspicuous in the National Sen
ate in the recent debates as an advocate of the recognition of Cuban in
dependence, concurrently with the declaration of war. and was largely in
strumental in securing the adoption of the joint resolution asserting that the
people of Cuba "are and of right ought to be independent," which Spain
treated as a direct challenge tÂ«. war. and which the historian will no doubt
regard as the immediate cause of the conflict.
Nevertheless, he is not fire-eater, and is hopeful that the war will be
short and its results highly ben< ficial to mankind in the lareer sense.
re are some original vic-ws by him on the present war and its probable
results:
I HAVE no particular sympathy
with the idea that every genera
tion must and ought to have a
war, in order that the courage of
the nation may be preserved and
the sterner virtues of manhood be
maintained. That is a theory which
has been held by men of considerable
eminence, who have believed that with
out the hard discipline of wars, occur
ring at more or less regular intervals,
the virility of the nation is in danger
of being lost, so that its people will
degenerate into softness and weak
ness.
But, while I do not share this view
of war, I note it as a curious fact that
in the past century and a quarter of
our existence as a nation events have
conspired together in such a way as to
give us exactly one war to every gen
eration. Thus, in the first quarter cen
tury, we had the War of the Revolu
tion, in the next quarter century the
war with Mexico, in the third quarter
century the War of the Rebellion, and
now, when its last quarter was running
to its close without any war, lo and be
hold! we have this war with Spain.
Whatever .may be said about the
blessings of peace â and assuredly
they are very greatâ it is undeniable
that war, particularly when it is a war
waged, as this one is. for what the na
ticrn believes to be a just and righteous
cause, must have an enormous and
wholesome tonic influence, bracing up
not merely the lower and physical but
the higher and moral life of the nation
engaging in it.
Suppose, if you please, that this
Spanish war were to come to an end
now, and that no more fighting were to
be done. It wo-uld have been a short
conflict, with no great loss of life, and
THE SAT* I K V^CISCO CAT^L, STTXDAY, MAY 22, 1898.
yet we would have already made not
only a great naval, but a great mili
tary demonstration; we would have
given ourselves assurance, and at the
same time shown to the whole world
that we have a mighty reserve power,
both on land and on sea. We have
made a demonstration something akin
to the memorable grand review that
took place at the close of our Civil
War, and which gave us a spectacle
on Pennsylvania avenue which, as I
look back to it, I feel was a splendid
object lesson as to the vital strength
and resources of the republic, and was
of incalculable value in its moral influ
ence upon foreign observers.
A similar thing is now going to hap
pen again. We shall put our 125,000
militia in line, and. whether we have to
send them all to the front or not. we
shall, by-and-by, bring them together
in one great assembly here in Wash
ington, and the moral effect of that as
a demonstration of our latent power as
a nation will be great and valuable.
The war may be too short to require
us to use this latent power on which
we have made a first call â and the
shorter the war is the better we will be
pleased â but even if it ends to-mor
row, this demonstration of our capacity
for war on a great scale has been
made, and its moral effect will remain.
Moreover, attention having been
called in a pointed way to our defi
ciencies in military organization. In
coast defenses and in naval equipment
at various points, the country will now
insist, that they shall be remedied at
whatever cost, so that we shall never
at any future time find ourselves taken
by surprise or at a disadvantage in fac
ing any foreign complication.
The next broad view which comes to
me is that this war is a fortunate war
in many ways. It comes at a good time
and under fortunate circumstances for
us. It is, in my opinion, going to save
this country a bigger war, and perhaps
several other bigger wars. If we had
shown pusillanimity now we should
have taken our place as a second-class
power instead of a first-class power,
with this extremely probable result â
that other nations, perceiving us to be
a second-class power, not willing to
fight even Spain on a question involv
ing American principles and American
interests in this hemisphere, would
have taken advantage of the discovery
to embark in various ambitious enter
prises of their own on this side of tb.<
world.
Emperor William might possibly, in
such an event, have bought St. Thomas
and St. Croix: other powers might have
bought other American possessions;
P^ngland. without conquering Vene
zuela, might have purchased Venezuela,
and a whole series of similar acts
might have followed on the part of
European powers in this western half
of the world if we had proved in this
exigency that we were not ready or
willing to fight Spain for good cause.
The Monroe doctrine would thus have
bf-en made to disappear, unless we had
been prepared to enter upon an armed
contest to prevent such action by these
great powers, a war with any one of
which would have been much harder to
fight than this one with Spain. Hence it
is quite clear to my mind that this war
is most fortunate, in this respect at
leastâ that it will have the effect of
preventing larger wars, which other
wise would have come upon us, unless
we had been willing not only to give
way to Spain but to surrender our Mon
roe doctrine.
The Monroe doctrine is only inci
dentally touched by our action in the
case of Cuba. The Monroe doctrine has
always implied the recognition of ex
isting European governments in this
hemisphere, but only upon this condi
tion â that any European power having
possessions here which it grossly mis
governs, we shall feel it to be our ri^ht
and duty to expel. We have never
taken the position that European
powers already established here were to
be driven out, but simply that they
should make no new establishments
here and, as a corollary, that such ter
ritories and peoples as were already
under their dominion should be well
governed.
This exceptional attitude which we
have taken toward Spain â demanding
that she must go, bag and baggage, en
tirely out <>f America â is the only case
of the kind that can arise, because
Spain is the only European nation that
misgoverns on this side, of the world.
England does not misgovern her colo
nies; she holds those of her colonies
that are composed of civilized people
capable of self-government with their
own consent, and, bo far as I know,
that is true also of France and Ger
many. So that the reason for which we
are fighting Spain, while it bears inci
dentally upon the Monroe doctrine,
cannot possibly lead us into a war with
any uther European power.
We are in armed conflict with Spain
because of her war methods, which are
barbarous; because of her long and
terrible misgovernment of the Cuban
people; because of her bad faith, as
shown in the De Lome letter, which re
vealed her as practicing deception upon
us in the matter of autonomy, and at
the same time insulting our President,
and last, but not least, because of her
allowing the Maine to be blown up by
some of the extreme Spaniards in Ha
vana. We are fortunate, again, in hav
ing such strong specific causes for the
war we are making.
This war is fortunate, too, in this,
that, while Spain is not so powerful a
nation as to make it prudent to avoid
conflict with her, yet she is not so weak
a nation as to make her an unworthy
antagonist, or one whose defeat will be
an inglorious thing in itself. Her
strength and resources, and the extent
of her naval and military establish
ments, are not so small that we can be
charged with making a cowardly fight.
Her expulsion, by force, from this hem
isphere is indeed, no holiday affair.
It is, furthermore, exceedingly for
tunate that the United States goes into
this war not for itself, nor to gain any
thing for its own aggrandizement, but
simply to fight for friends and neigh
bors. Yet another piece of good fortune
for us is that things are so situated in
Europe at this time that Spain cannot
get any help from the "concert of Eu
rope," which, three or four years hence,
she might be able to get. All the con
ditions of the time, and, it seems to
me, all the circumstances of the war.
are in our favor.
My feeling is that it is "manifest des
tiny," clearly indicated by these fortu
nate circumstances to which I have al
luded. I think it will appear in history,
both as to its immediate outcome and
as to the far-reaching consequences of
which I have spoken, as altogether one
of the most fortunate wars in which
any nation ever engaged. And the
world may well infer that if we will
take suc*h a stand and make such sac
rifices for a neighboring people we
would certainly fight for ourselves and
our own interests still more readily and
resolutely.
The new feature in our international
relations is already evident in the great
change which has taken place in the
'â  ling between England and this
country. This change of feeling is
palpable in both countries. The way
in which the British Government has
acted during the past few weeks, ever
since <>ur dispute with .Spain reached
its culmination, has made a deep and
lasting impression upon the American
people.
The logical outcome of this change will
be an understanding amounting to ani
alliance between England and the
United States. No actual written
treaty with England is to be expected
or desired, because we do nt.-t seek
entangling alliances with foreign na
tions in our day any more than our
fathers of old. But we can have a mu
tually good understanding between the
two countries without having it form
ally expressed in a treaty. There has
never been any very bad feeling be
tween England and the United States,
except what has grown (rut of what I
may call the assumption of England
toward us of the tone and manner of
the big brother to the little brother.
England, in times past, has been dis
posed to play the big brother. When
we have had a difference with her she
has seemed to assume to treat it. and
to decide it, not as if we were a nation
of equal power and dignity with her
self, but as if she, having that big navy
of hers, was entitled to act on the big
brother principle and say, "We are go
ing to have it so and so, and you help
it if you can."
In order to get at a working- basis
of alliance with England, which this
war has brought into sight as a dis
tinct possibility, some method will have
to be found, of course, of deciding
questions between the two countries on
some other principle than that.

WILLIAM EWARG GLADSTONE
A Study of the
Life of theQreat
English States
man.
B\j One Who Kr\eW Him.
THE passing of England's Grand
Old Man is an event of world
wide interest. For more than
half a century he stood in the
front rank of the makers of his
tory. And he was a maker of history
not merely through the accidents of
birth or of political and social condi
tions, but by virtue of the elements of
a strong and unique personality. His
influence upon the life of his time was
due not to lucky circumstance, but to
the strength, wisdom and humane sym
pathies of his own personal character.
In the last analysis and when his
tory issues its final verdict upon the
career of William Ewart Gladstone, it
will be found that his versatility, his
eminence as a scholar, as a financier
and as a statesman were secondary to
his sterling moral-qualities as a man
and a lover of mankind. In truth, his
versatility as a public man was the
natural outcome of the many-sidedness
of his personality and the many points
at which the sensitive qualities of h S
character touched the interests of his
Tor'oncTthe adage, -The child is the
father of the man." was belied by the
life of Gladstone. He first entered Par
ament as a Tory of the old school a
fSional h and PconventionalP conventional order there
seemed to be no reason *hy hes^
not achieve success as a great k'i.v
leader What would have become of
Disraeli in that event it were both dif
ficult and useless to conjecture.
Gladstone and Disraeli crossed paths
in almost opposite directions from di
rectly opposite starting points Glad
stone, although born and raised a Tory,
*-as constitutionally predestined to be
a Liberal and a reformer. Among his
innate qualities were those of a Lin
roln and a Garibaldi.
â 'Th? greatest good for the greatest
number was his political motto as
â Son as he sufficiently understood him
self and his political bearings to adopt
a. motto. And this motto ever re
mained his pillar of cloud by day and
"is Pillar of fire by night throughout
all the changes of his great career.
Gladstone, as a great leader and re
former, was unique in the possession
and control of two kindred essential
qualities of leadership in all great en
terprises, namely, sincerity and enthu
siasm. From predilections of early
associations and training he was not
during most of his public life one of the
first to perceive a new political ideal,
but once perceived it was never lost
Fight of The more ardent progress
ives of his party often grew impatient
at the slowness and caution with
which he took hold of a reform pro
ject, but when he had once taken hold
his grasp never relaxed, but rather
tightened, until the project took final
shape among the statutes of the realm,
to the advantage and liberties and cus
toms of the people.
A close political observer once re
marked to me "How Gladstone grows
upon you:"
It was quite true. In like manner
Gladstone grew upon the entire nation
throughout his entire career. His
greatest enthusiasm appeared in the
latter part of his life. His views of
truth were ever broadening and his
sympathies were ever intensifying, and
bo it came to pass that in Gladstone
the world beheld the rare spectacle of
an octogenarian toiling as a reformer
with the sympathy, ardor and enthu
siasm of youth.
To render any estimate of the moral
qualities of Gladstone's character is to
suggest to all who knew the man a
very striking contrast in the person of
his great antagonist, Benjamin D.is
raeli, afterward the Earl of Beacons
field. Disraeli was always a politician,
often a political buffoon; Gladstone
was never less than a dignified states
man. Disraeli was the "hired howler"
of his party in the political game of
cricket, and was so treated by his own
side; Gladstone was the honored cap
tain of his party and always respected
by the other side, whichever won the
game. The political cartoons of Punch
published from week to week during
the years when these two men were
antagonists in the.political arena point
the contrast In a very vivid manner.
A few years ago these cartoons were
republished In separate volumes â
"Gladstone" series and a "Disraeli"
series. In the Disraeli series Disraeli
Is often the smarter of the two antag
onists, but his cleverness Is usually
that of the sleight-of-hand juggler, the
political mountebank.
In the Gladstone series, however,
Gladstone is rarely exhibited in any
such character. Many of these cartoons
are laudatory and heroic in purpose
and character and the mistakes which
they occasionally expose or satirize are
almost always mistakes that are con
sistent with honesty and sincerity of
purpose. And Punch in so estimating
and comparing the characters of the
two men ' expressed in substance the
judgment of the nation regardless of
political party In those days.
History may modify the Judgment of
Disraeli pronounced by his contempo
raries, but it will never rob the fame
of Gladstone of the priceless gems of
purity, honesty and sincerity.
To these qualities of character, com
bined with the native strength of his
personality, was due in large measure
the fascination which Gladstone's
speech always exercised over his fel
low men. I was witness to a grand il
lustration of this which occurred one
Saturday more than twenty years ago
It was during the first excitement
caused by the published reports of
Turkish ' atrocities in Bulgaria and
Gladstone had been announced to ad
dress his constituents at Blackheath.
There 1 eing no hall of sufficient ca
pacity in the neighborhood it was ar
ranged to hold the meeting on the open
common. Before the time announced
for the meeting i: began to rain and
the rain fell In steady perpendicular
torrents, continuously throughout the
afternoon. There was no possible shel
ter except for the speaker and about a
dozen others including members of the
local political committee and represen
tatives of the London press.
Did the rain spoil the meeting? Not
at all. Gladstone spoke for over two
hours, and throughout the whole of
that time there stood around that
hustings as many thousands of men as
could pack together within hearing of
the great orator's clear, sonorous voice.
As I looked down upon that forest of
heads I wondered whether the man
ever lived before who could hold such
a host of men with his lips for so long
under such adverse conditions. ',â â ! can
not remember a single word of that ad
dress, but neither can I forget ?ts gen

garding Turkish misrule and its hor
rible results in Bulgaria.
A few months Later I witnessed an
other equally suggestive and memor
able illustration of Gladstone's remark
able fascination as a speaker on a
smaller scale. The incident occurred
within th- precincts of the British
Houses of Parliament, in the main cor
ridor between the two houses, a few
paoes from the lobby of the House of
Commons. Mr. Gladstone had just
passed out of the 10l by. apparently on
his way to th.' House of Lords, when
he met another member of Parliament
and Btopped to speak to him. Strangers
ami members were passing and repass
ing.
Suddenly, in less time than it takes
to writ.- it. 1 s.iv a group form around
Mr. Gladstone an<l his friend. Two
passing one way Btopped and almost
simultaneously three passing the other
way Btopped also. A crowd began to
gather which a police officer hurried up
to disperse. As they were dispersed I
kept my eyes upon the first five who
formed the group.
One of them turning to me said:
"Who's that man?" Before I c;uld
answer another made n similar Inquiry,
pointing to Mr. Gladstone.
Within a few minutes I found that
neither of the five strangers knew
Gladstone by sipht. They were simply
all lirought to a halt when passing him
in the corridor, attracted, half unc-un-
BCiOUSIy, by the subtle fascination of
his calm, pleasant, but earnest tone and
manner of speech to his friend. Such
was the man. the grand soul of him
expressing Itself even In small, ordi
nary casual talk with a neighbor.
I saw Disraeli once and Gladstone
more than once under provocation. The
Tory leader fumed, stammered, splut
tered with rage? Gladstone posw
his tt&Ol in calm dignity with resultant
discomfiture to bin foes, on one such
Occasion a small Tory mr iber sprung
a sensation in the House of Commons
by apparently quoting from the records
of the House a former opinion of Glad
stone's widely at variance frojp his
later utterances.
Gladstone quietly left his seat, went
to the library, possessed himself of a
volume and returned. The whole House
Was on the tiptoe of expectation, await
ing Gladstone's reply. At a suitable
opportunity he rose, opened the boole,
remarked upon the accuracy with
which the records had been quoted and
reread the whole passage referred to.
The reading: was hailed by the Tories
with a furor of derisive applause.
Gladstone stood calmly until order was
restored and then quietly remarked, "I
find that the words I have read were
uttered by Mr. Whlteslde"â an insig
nificant member whom no one would
have thought of quotingâ and then
quietly resumed his seat.
On another occasion a young mem
ber of Parliament, with political as
pirations, but who has pln^e become
and is now a member of the Salisbury
Government, undertook to win favor
with hiÂ« party by baiting and taunting
the great Liberal leader. The incident
was dramatic, but cannot be adequate
ly described in words. The impudence
of the young Tory suggested a cur
barking and snapping at a mastiff, and
the question was, What would the
mastiff do about it?
Later during the evening Gladstone
rose, his hands full of papers, to take
a great and historic part In the debate
of that time. For a moment he stood
hesitant, then glancing across at the
Tory benches, he seemed seized by a
sudden impulse, and laid his papers on
the table. Then he directed a steady
gaze across to that point on the Tory
benches where his young friend of the
gibing speech sat for rather lolled)
back in his seat, his hands in his pook
ots and his hat tilted forward and rest
ing on the bridge of his nose. As Glad
stone's first sentence made it evident
that he was about to pay his young
friend the compliment of a little atten
tion, the Tory's hat was taken off. But
the hands were returned to the pock
ets and an effort was made to main
tain the previous nonchalant demean
or. The great orator warmed to his
task, and with calm politeness and dig
nity, treated his small antagonist, for
once, as if he were somebody great.
For the space of ten minutes, in chaste,
classic, but scathing English, the gjreat
Liberal made the adventurous young
Tory regret his rashness. But before
the episode was half through attention
was directed from Gladstone to his

papers, in preparation for more serious

huge sigh of relief, and seemed to drop
back into his seat, as if the cur had

That Tory troubled Gladstone no
more for many years, if, indeed, he
ever did so again.
In the old days when the crying
abuse of purchase in the army was en
trenched iii that last ditch of all hered
itary political abuse, the House of

in more recent years had to fare the
hostility of that same foe to popular
progressâ the House of Lords.
SAMUEL BLOCOMBg.
HUNTING FOR
DURHAM'S GOLD
ONCE more the treasure hunting
craze has struck Butte County.
This time people are digging for
the long buried gold of old man
Durham.
It is true this gold has been be
neath the surface of the earth a long
time. So long. In fact, that many peo
ple have forgotten all ah, mt the man
who put It there, and why he put it
there. But that does not hinder their
digging for it now.
Long ago, when golden nuggets fresh
from the bosom of mother earth were
more plentiful than now, and sleek, fat
I cattle roamed by the thousands over
the grass covered hills, Robert Durham
rode on the top of the bright hued wave
lof prosperity. He had fortunes safely

i State' and all the time his herds were
Increasing in numbers. The world was
| going just as he wanted it to. and his
only hope was that it would swing
! along forever in the groove that suited
i him so well.
But as all lanes must have a turn-
Ing, so did Robert Durham's road of
life. From good health he was one day
suddenly brought face to face with the
grave. "But I'll be all right to-mor
row," he said.
This happened one Saturday morn
ing, and that afternoon a man called
on Durham and closed a deal for the
sale of many thousands of cattle. The
papers were signed and the money paid
over. This sum with what he had on
hand at the ranch amounted to about
$100,000 in gold.
At this time Durham was living at
his favorite ranch a short distance out
of Chico. Had he been well he Would
have gone to town and put the money
in bank, but as it was he was com
pelled to postpone his trip and secrete
the money. "I'll go on Monday," he
told his wife. He was feeling a. little
better at this time.
On the day following, Sunday, he was
stricken with a nervous fear over the
safety of so much money in the house.
He thought that some inkling of thÂ«
gold being there might get out and that
thieves would break in and steal It. He
must hide it.
Weak as he was from his late attack
he managed, without being seen, to
walk some distance from his house, dig
a hole, and then make several trips
back to the house for his gold which he
carefully covered up with sods.
"I'll dig it up again to-morrow and
take it to the bank in Chico," he said,
to his wife.
But the morrow only found him pros
trated completely. The doctor who had
been summoned shook his head and
said it was only a matter of minutes
before the end would come. Old Dur
ham then thought of his gold. He must
tell his wife where he buried it.
Calling her to the bedside he pointed

aged to gasp, while his hand shook like
a leaf in the wind.
"Dig at theâ" and then he drew a
long breath and breathed his last.
Of course a search was immediately
made for the buried gold, but nobody
ever found a trace of it. At least as far
as is known.
There are neighbors who firmly be
lieve that some members of the family
dug up the gold before the old man's
body was cold. The story goes that they
then divided it among themselves and
kept the matter a secret. Others there
are who believe just as stoutly that the
gold is still in thi place where sick, old
Robert Durham Becreted it.
At any rate that is the gold some peo
ple are still digging for in Butte County
to-day.
SUPERSTITIONS
ON WAR VESSELS
THE most picturesque superstitions
of the seas are those which gov
ern a modern man-of-war. Every
old salt in the navy believes in
hoodoos and spells which may
work all sorts of evils on his ship and
must be carefully guarded against.
The powers of a ship's hoodoos com
mence before the ship has entered the
water. It is generally accepted super
stition that if the first blow which is
struck the keel brings pparks the ship
is destined to suffer from a raking fire
from the enemy.
The old-time practice of stealing a
piece of wood and imbedding It in the
prow for good luck is. of course, im
possible in the case of steel ships,
though it is considered lucky to have a
piece of stolen wood on board.
Another old superstition Is satisfied
by placing a silver coin in some crevice
of the fighting-top of the mainmast or
some place below decks where it
touches the steel mast. Originally it
was a very common custom to Imbed a

The ceremony of launching a ship is
merely a concession to an old super "
stition. The various formalities ofsmp
christening have been followed with lit
tle variation for centuries. v
In the early days of shipbuilding it
was the custom for the captain and
the crew to eat their first meal Btowea
wav In the mold loft The,r meal in
variably consisted of eggs and f sulphur
From this custom has come the pres
ent-day practice of Providing cakes and
wine for the crew. And the old liba

over the prow of the ship as she slippi a
into the water has been replaced by
every masthead. In order to gratify

no one begrudges this extravagance.

a The "superstition about women is a
relic of the old belief in Witchcraft. It
is thought that a woman by throwing
sand in the air on shipboard can pro
duce violent storms.. Not many years
ago some women Who traveled on
English warships were tortured during
a storm to make them quiet the waves.
These barbaric beliefs, however, are
partially compensated by the supersti
tion which sailors have held for cen
turies that beautiful children bring a
blessing of a ship. The "Neck was a
handsome boy with golden curls. It is
said- that he is always accompanied by
a black lamb and carries with him a
golden harp. Our old salts have es
pecial confidence in a ship which is
christened by a child.
The average sailor is superstitious
about the ringing of the ship's bells.
In olden time the bells were blessed
before they were used. At present, if
a mistake is made in striking the hour
the sailors Insist that the bells at once
be struck backward to break the spell.
And If by any chance the wind should
catch the bells and swing them all the
way around, or If they strike nine
bells, it is believed that it will be the
last of that ship. â 
All good warships go to the "shores
of Fiddler's Green" as a final resting
place. Just where this mythical har
bor is situated no geographer has yet
decided. It is In every way the anti
thesis of "Davy Jones' locker!" A
warship which goes down to battle
with her flags flying, as occurred sev
eral times during the Civil War, goes
to- "Fiddlers' Green."
The tattooing habit is of course very
common in the navy. It Ib believed
that an arm or a leg decorated with
the design of a gun or a sword or
some such a design will never be lost
in battle.
INSURANCE AGAINST SHOT.
Risks from war in any form are ex
cluded from the standard Massachu
setts fire insurance policy, but the com
panies are apparently besieged with
applications for such insurance, and the
Attorney General has been asked to
give an opinion to the Insurance Com
missioner respecting the right of the
companies to waive the war risk clause.
As he has already decided that a fire
policy cannot be made to cover loss by
explosion, he will presumably decide
that it cannot be made to cover loss
by bombardment or by fire which has
been started by a shell explosion or
other war device. This would leave the
seashore cottages and exposed city
property to seek insurance in some
other direction against the shots of
Spanish cruisers.
Some of the fire companies in New
York are writing war risks on shore
properties, notably the expensive villas
maintained on the Long Island and
Jersey coasts.

DOES THE COLD OF ALASKA
CURE BALDNESS
Stories That Beat Anything Told by "Hair Restorative" Agents Brought BacK by Returning Prospectors.
THE experience of Roderick Dhu
Smith â who recently returned
from the Klondike region with
a big budget of experience, quite
a little sum of money and a
head of hair which almost qualifies
him to take an engagement as a Cir
cassian girl !n a circusâ is of especial
Interest to a large contingent of his
fellow men and women. For be it
known that Roderick, before making
his perilous way to the Arctic regions,
though otherwise pleasing to look upon
and still on the sunny side of forty,
was the owner of a head which made
theater ushers, whenever there was a
ballet on the programme, escort him
down to the front row without even
glancing at his seat check.
While this might have been consid
ered an advantage by some people, it
was not pleasing to Mr. Smith, who is
an essentially modest man and averse
to being made unduly prominent on
any occasion. It is said, too, that his
baldness was the real cause of his
starting out in search of gold, since he
spent all his patrimony in the purchase
of hair restorers, and it was necessary
for him to do something, no matter how
desperate, to retrieve his fallen for
tunes.
Be that as it may, he went to Alaska,
and after a two years' residence there
has returned amodern Samson, as far
as ehevalure is concerned, and he de
dares that the transformation is en

in that quarter of the globe.
"The intense cold kills all germs and ;
microbes," he asserts, "and stimulates
the- scalp, and nature does the rest,"
and he proudly exhibits his lion-like
mane as proof of what nature can do
when she takes a fancy, unassisted by
washes or oils or unguents of any kind.

for this tide and the fast that he
took advantage of it, Bidel would
never have been a great animal

his own life which in U way is a most
interesting volume. It is full of narra
tives of intensely dramatic experience,
but the grent incident of his life stands
out from these like a diamond in a pile
of pebbles.
According to his own story, Bidel was
born in Rouen, in 1539; his father, trav

rates his story as to the virtues of that
frigid clime as a hair-producer.
"My hair was always thick," he says,
"so I cannot speak from personal ex
perience, but the way the dogs put on
hair up there is a caution; they get as
shaggy as Shetland ponies; and now I
think of it, I never saw a bald-headed
fellow anywhere around there. To tell
the truth they all look, after they have
got t<> work, as though a razor and a
pair of scissors were far more needed
than a hair restorer, and I think a mis
sionary barber could do good work
among them."
G. H. Henderson, who has a claim on
Dominion Creek, and has been up in
that vicinity for two years, heartily
echoes Mr. McLeod's sentiments.
There is something about the intense

he thinks that the fact that people are

Why the Seventh Adventists See the End of the World in the Present War
BY every one this message of war is interpreted
in a different and purely personal way. There
is among us a band of people who look upon it
all calm-eyed and seriously expectant. To them
it is merely the fulfilling of the prophetic ut
terances of Joel, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Daniel, Habakkuk.
James, John and others whose portentous words have
been pres^rvf-d to us in the old and new testaments.
These people are known as Second Adventists, as
they believe in the literal and personal second coming
of Christ. A portion of them have differentiated be
tween themselves and the rest of the Christian world
by observing Saturday instead of Sunday as the Sab
bath of the Lord, claiming that God himself set apart
this day for his special service, while men alone de
cided upon Sunday for the purpose and these call
themselves Seventh Day Adventlsts.
Both branches of this church, however, put im
plicit faith in the Bible, and find therein reasons for
everything that has happened, and a clear and ex
plicit exposition of all that is to come.
It is their belief â justified to them by past and pres
ent events â that we are now living in the last days of
this earth; that the end of the world as we know it
is close at hand, and that many of us will ourselves
see in the body the hour when the Lord shall appear
In the clouds of heaven surrounded by his angels, and
carry his elect away with him to the heavenly man
sions prepared for them; whence they shall come, 1000
years after, to dwell forever in this earth, which has
meanwhile been perfectly purified by fire.
Feeling assured of. this the members of this church
stand firm and constant, for it has been foretold that
a universal war shall precede the first judgment day,
and the present war, with the possibilities involved,
but confirms them in their belief Jn the nearness of
the glorious time to come, when, the great battle of
the last day being ended, the Lord shall come in his
power to reward them for their steadfastness in the
faith.
Three men. prominent in this church, here present
their views on this subject as follows:
That the glorious yet awful
"Last Day" is close at hand
can be doubted by no one who
is conversant with the divine
plan as set forth in the Bible
and who has eyes to see and ears to hear and a mind
t'i understand the occurrences which are taking place
In the world around us.

The "increase of riches," the "increase of knowl
edge," the "increase of disease," the "waxing old of
the-earth,"â evidenced by the frequency of earth
quakes and cyclones, the failures of crops, the changes
in climatic conditions and areas, and all su^h mani
festationsâand the "rise of divers kinds of religions,"
are but a few of the many special features which
clearly indicate that we are surely and swiftly nearing
the end of the period of probation.
Another Thing which particularly impresses this fact
upon the candid observer Is the frequency and enor
mity of the crimes which are being committed on our
earth at the present time. Trusted officials in every
land are proving too weak to resist temptation; rob
beries small and great are being perpetrated every
hour; murders and suicides and an manner of evil
deeds are so common everywhere as to win little more
(han passing notice from all those who are not directly
and personally interepted either in the crime, the
criminal or his punishment. Unmistakably we have
reached the "last day," in which the Savior tells us
the earth shall be "filled with violence."
That the present war with Spain is the beginning- of
the "great general war," which is to include all nations
and to occur just preceding 1 the second coming of our
Savior, is undoubtedly true. While peace may and
probably will be made between the United States and
!i"r present foe and there may be a delusive period of
quiet and inaction for a time all over the world the
war spirit which has now found an opportunity to
assert its existence for perhaps a brief space will not
be exorcised. It will grow stronger and stronger no
matter how carefully it may be concealed; it will work
and ferment like yeast, and break out here and there
on slight pretexts until at last, in the words of our
Savior, "nation shall rise against nation and kingdom
against kingdom."
But there are prophecies yet to be fulfilled this
side the close of the period of probation, such as the
closing words of the messageâ Revelation xviii, 1-4.
and of the powers of earth. Revelation xiii, 11-18, and
chapters 16 and 17, and until these are completed the
end shall not come. Of this we are assured.
The parliament of religions, the evangelical alli
ance and the peace and arbitration societies all talk
of the blessedness of peace and most truthfully, but
the countries in which all these talkers live are spend
ing millions for new implements of war. for arms and
ammunition and torpedo-boats and men-of-war and
mines and forts and all manner of offensive and de
fensive materials. And new inventions of things cal
culated to wound and kill more swiftly and surely than
the weapons which were satisfactory in the past are
continually being brought to the notice of the dif
ferent governments and being experimented with and
adopted by their war departments.
We are told in Holy Writ that one of the signs to
be given us when the judgment day was near ap
proaching would be that "the nations were angry."
The nations of earth present a warlike attitude to
day which is without a parallel in history, and in
their marshaling together of armies and navies we
see an unmistakable sign that the judgment is at
hand. Of a surety the world is preparing for the great
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, MAT 22, 1898,
A Directory Is Kept, in Which Aff the
Names o( the Charitably Inclined
Are Indexed, and Information Is
furnished Beggars for a Per
centage of the Charity Bestowed.
DID you know that there was a
private directory in San Fran
cisco lhat is patronized and made
use <>f by beggars alone? The
shrewd owner of it has indexed
all the philanthropically inclined
people in the city, with their faults,
weaknesses and what they are Inclined
to give. When a tramp or beggar
wants "to work" any particular class
of citizens he goes to the owner of this
directory and obtains from him for
payment all his private information
about the people he thinks will give the
most.
Of late I have heard more of the
directory, with some detailed informa
tion as to its possessor and form. The
directory itself is a comparatively small
book, bound in leather, after the
fashion of the indexed notebooks car
ried by collectors, and is arranged by
streets instead of alphabetically. Its
ssor Is ;i creature who, like Solo
mon's lilies, toils not, neither does he
spin, >et -he not only keeps himself well
dressed but smokes a good cigar at
times and occasionally goes upon a
spree with abundant funds to keep him
drunk as long as he desires to remain
so. But he never becomes drunk
enough to part with his directory or to
talk about it to the uninitiated.
For some time 1 have been connected
v.ith an Institution which deals' with
young tramps and stray boys of all
kinds, trying to teach them manliness
and self-reliance. A hard tsiwk when
a bÂ«>y has learned how easy it is to beg
and live without any further exertion
than that rendered necessary by a
change of residence from town to town
<h casionally.
The confidence of the boys once ob
tained It is ii"t I"HK before they tell me
tales of th< Ir exploits in begging that
would horrify the believer in the
dignity of labor. But there was no
Ity in sucti tales. The only thing
peculiar about them was the fact that
boys who had been In the city but a
few days, coming from distant parts of
the country, had, with singular unan
imity, all visited much the same list of
people in search of money or clothing,
and met with much the same experi
ence, apparently, upon their visits.
The facts seem to be about like this:
Every city has a place regarded by the
tramp rr hobo fraternity as a "hang
out." and a boy tramp arriving In San
Francisco naturally gravitates to one
or the other of the numerous "luing
.luts" with which Pan Francisco- has
favored. Here he is shortly ap
proached by the owner of the directory,
who suggests that he con put the new
arrival onto a "good thing" if he is will
ing to "divvy-up" on the proceeds.
Upon the new-comer's agreeing to give
the informant from 20 to 50 per cent of
the proceeds according to his experl
t inexperience in such work, he
is taken out to certain houses, posted
as to what sort of a story to tell, given
a description of the person he is to see
and goes on his way.
!t BUCC ssful in his first venture he
is posted is to other people, and so
works slowly over the entire list per
haps, making a stay of some months
if he turns out to hÂ° a very successful
: i-. All this resulting to the v.v>-.w
advantage ":' the owner of the direct
ory, who is all the time enlarging
and amplifying his directory so as
to make it thoroughly up to date and
entirely correct.
Thi.'- particular directory man seems
t<> be quite a student of human nature,
too, .for he never seems to send the
wrong kind of boy to a place, so that
if a man is fond of relieving homeless
orphan boys who are looking for dis
tant relatives in Pan Francisco he is
not troubled with half orphans who are
trying to earn money to get back home
to their fathers or mothers. He gets
just the kind of cases he is fond of.
though one would exneet him to wonder
Borne times whether there were no other
forms of distress in the city.
&cv. â¬. <?. Jfnctrosj
Capitalists, bankers, ne- -paper men,
doctors, lawyersâ all classes of chari
tnble peopleâ they are in this directory,
properly classified and described. An
entry read? something like this:

a bald head and clean-shaved
face. Wears eye-glasses. Best
time to see him about 7 o'clock
in the evening. Tell him Mrs.
White sent you. Will be very
Bhort and sharp with you at
first. Will tell you you should
SOME kind-hearted people will be pained to learn that in San
Francisco there is a man engaged in the business of supplying
beggars with information about the best persons to go
to for charity. This man keeps what is called a tip-book, a
regular directory in which he indexes all the philanthropic and
benevolent people and all those who bestow charity on special
pleas. Under each man's or woman's name follows a list of their
personal characteristics; whether they are sour, surly, good-natured
or gruff; whether they give food, clothes, money, work or promises
and any particular information that may be of benefit to the beggar
in approaching them for charity.
In return for the information furnished by this man the beg
gar is required to pay from 25 to 50 per cent of whatever he suc
ceeds in getting. The amount of the percentage depends on whether
the customer is hard or easy "to work."
The book containing the information is indexed according to
streets so that the beggar can start at one end and work right
straight along.
All our prominent bankers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, so
ciety women and every one charitably inclined are carefully indexed
in "Spider Kelly's"' directory, and a good deal more information is
appended than is furnished by the Blue Book or City Directory.
be at work Instead of begging.
Tell him you have been trying
to get work, but can't because
you are new to the city ana can
give H" references. Tell him
you will be glad to work if he
will Bend you to some place
where you can obtain work. He
will probably give you a couple
<>f meal tickets and two-bits to
get a lodging and tell you to
come to his office in the morn
ing, giving you a card to send
in to him. Go in the morning,
and he will think you mean

a place, but will give you one or
two dollars to keep you going
tilt you ran find work. Prides
himself on always investigating
cases applying to him. Has been
known to give as high as $5.
So Mr. Green has been supplied with
a continuous stream of- deserving boys,
all looking for work, all genuine cnses
and all carefully investigated â by Mr.
Green's methodâ and all relieved to thÂ«>
extent of the loose change in Mr.
Green's po<. ket when the 1 y makes his
second appearance. Sometimes h =
varies the performance by telling th^
boy to come and see him again next
week if he fails to find work. This th^
boy doesâ invariably.
Other entries are concerning people
who give clothing, but never money,
and people who can always be depend
ed upon for meal tickets or an order
for a bed. The meal tickets are bought
up by the directory man at half-price
and sold at a slight advance. The
clothes, if used by the boys, are ap
praised by the directory man and a
percentage paid him out of the boy's
next cash gift, so that pretty nearly
everything Is flsh that comes to his
net.
All this would be merely funny, and
we could laugh over how these people
are being gulled were it not for the !
fact that a direct injury is being per- I
petrated upon those who can least af- j
ford it. Not a pastor of a church in I
battle of Armageddon, but the angels of God are hold
ing the winds of this universal war until the work of
the Lord on the earth is finished. That time is surely
Dear at hand, nearer perhaps than any of us realize,
for with Him all things are possible, and if it be His
will event will follow event with a swirtness Incon
ceivable.
That we arc living in thÂ» last days of this earth,
as it now is, cannot be gainsayed. The word of God is
true from the least to the greatest, and the words of
His inspired prophets are lights to our feet.
Looked at in the all-illuminating light of prophecy
a grander and more awe-inspiring time was never
viewed by mortal man. We are rapidly nc-aring the
dawning of that eternal day whose sun shall know no
setting. We are almost at the gateway, the portals
of which shall soon swing open at the coming of the
King of Kings.
The intense war spirit that
now exists among' the nations
of the earth is but one of the
many signs that point to the
near coming of our Lord.
One of the most striking features of the year 1897
and thus far In the year 1898 has been thÂ« continual
"alarm of war" that has come from all tne nations of
the world, and Bishop Newman well said not long
since: "This is the most unsettled condition of the
world since the crucifixion of Christ. The stability of
government is no longer a fact. Change is In the
atmosphere."
The fact cannot be longer concealed that the nations
of the world are fairly frenzied in the Intensity of
their effort to prepare for war. General Nelson A.
Miles said not long since: "I have seen all the great
armies of Europe except the Spanish army. What I
have seen does not indicate that the millennium is at
hand, when swords will be beaten Into plowshares.
There never was a time when so much energy, in
genuity and wealth were being devoted to war pur
poses."
From simply a human standpoint it la not a thing
to be considered unlikely that soon the nations of the
earth will be engaged in a life and death grapple,
in which the terribly destructive weapons with
which the armies and navies of the world are now
equipped will cause such carnage as to deluge the
earth with blood.
This is all in direct fulfillment of the prophetic
word: "Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles: Pre
pare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of
war draw near: let them come up; beat your plow
shares Into swords and your pruning hooks into spears;
let the weak say I am strong. The Lord also shall
roar out of Zlon and utter His voice from Jerusalem,
and the heavens and the earth shall shake."â Joel ill,
9, 10, 16.
Again: "I am pained at my very heart; my heart
maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because
thou hast heard. O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,
the alarm of war. Destruction upon destruction is
cried, for the whole land is spoiled; suddenly are my
tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment." â Jere
miah iv, 19-20.

the city but has cases presented to him
of needy people, well known to him,
and deserving, who cannot be assisted
because there are no funds available,
or whom he assists from an already
overtaxed salary, while people of his
own congregation are contributing to
the supt)ort of this worthless parasite
who is preying upon society in a more
cowardly manner than ever the much
despised Fagin preyed upon London
through his corps of juvenile pickpock
ets. There is not a suit of clothes

by them sold to the dealers in second
hand clothes but could be placed on
the back of some boy who really needs
it and perhaps suffers for the want of
it. by any one of half a dozen well
conducted charities of this city, and the
pity of it is that these boy tramps who
receive the gifts are rendered more dif
ficult of reformation by the well-in
tentioned but badly directed kindness
of these people who have not time nor
patience to investigate cases presented
to them for relief, yet insist upon dis
pensing their own charity.
I have heard this directory described
by ton many boys who have seen it to
doubt it for a moment, and I have seen
its reputed possessor, too, a well
dressed, dissipated looking man, appar
ently about 34 or 35, and known to the
hobo fraternity as "'Spider Kelley."
How long the directory will remain
as valuable as it seems to be now, I
cannot say, but I wish that I might
go over the book and tell each of those
spoken of in its pages of real cases or
boys who could be helped to become
manly and useful by a little of the as
sistance now given to juvenile tramps.

Once more I quote from the inspired writer: "And
I p^iw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the
beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For
they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which
go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the
whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great
day of God Almighty. Behold, I come as a thief." â
Revelation xvi, 13-15.
That this present war is the beginning of the end,
which will be universal destruction (Jeremiah xxv. 30
33), I believe most fully. But that there will not be a
brief period of peace following this struggle I cannot
say. The angels of God are commissioned to hold the
winds of war until the servants of God are scaled â
Revelation vii, 1-3.
This work is not yet fully accomplished. I believe.

â trouble just before the second
coming of Christ the Messiah, and because such a time
of trouble is on the world now, I believe the war we are

the nations of the earth before it ceases.
Listen: "Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And
great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and fam

shall there be from heaven." â¢ â¢ â¢ "And there shall
be signs in the sun and in the moon, and in the stars;
and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity;
the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing
them for fear, and for looking after those things which

And good cause or causes there are for this state of

The rich men have accumulated so much wealth that
they couldn't get a satisfactory rate of interest on
their money so thr succeeded in making a world
wide corner in money and as a result of their greed
the debt r class of every nation on earth, every poor
man on this planet, is suffering to-day from the action
of these relentless, cruel money lords.
The first nine verses of the fifth chapter of the
book of James in the Bible tells what the fate of these
same money lords will be.
Next as to terrestrial conditions: "And great earth
quakes shall be in divers places and famines and pes

SECRET SERVICE IN THE ARMY.
DURING the Revolutionary War
Washington had secret service
agents in the British camps.
Lafayette furnished sympa-
thetic ink obtained from
France, which was visible only -where
the sheet of paper on which the mes
sage was washed with another fluid.
It was customary to write with sym
pathetic ink on blank paper, and
Washington suggested that a com
monplace letter be written, after which
the message could be written in sym
pathetic ink on the margins.
In the early history of the Govern-
*Dr. Seorge jC. Jfy/cA,

is the word of God and be
cause the Bible says there

ment of the United States Co-ngres*
made an annual appropriation of $30,
000 for secret service, and this custom
has prevailed unto the present. This
is payable by direction of the Presi
dent and Secretary of State, and no
voucher is necessary.
During the rebellion the secret serv
ice branch of the Government was
very active. General Butler o..ce paid
$50 for a hand organ and monkey. It
was used by an officer who-, disguised
as a beggar, was enabled to pass the
enemy's lines.
The Confederate Government had an
army of secret agents at Washington,
and the Federal Government was daily
betrayed by these agents.
famine and pestilences I want to more particularly
call attention.
An editorial from The Call of May 13 tells us a part
of what is happening. It reads as follows:
"Europe is just now going through such a crisis.
Bread riots have occurred in Spain and in Italy, and in
both countries the professional agitators and revolu
tionists have taken advantage of them to incite the
people to revolt. The situation is bad in Spain, but
even worse in Italy. Although there is reason to be
lieve that the censorship of the press at Rome has
suppressed as much as possible the truth of the ex
tent and degree of the riots in that country, enough
has been published to make it certain that insurrec
tions amounting almost to the dignity of civil war
have broken out and the very integrity of the king
dom is threatened.
The situation is the more serious because there is
every prospect that economic conditions throughout
Europe will grow worse before they become better.
The wheat crop is scarce in all parts of the Continent.
To prevent a further rise in the price of bread the
French Government has suspended the duty on the
irhport of wheat. Germany is not better off than
France, and according to recent reports the crop in
Russia is so small that the Government of that coun
try proposes to prohibit the export of wheat in order
that it may retain enough for its own people."
But this is not all. It is a well-known fact that
Austria has not enough food this year to feed its own
people, yet where can she buy, admitting she has the
money?
Australia has been buying food from us for a con
siderable period, and now California is purchasing food
from Oregon and the East, owing to the drouth in
this State, while the famine in India is too recent to be
forgotten. In China the conditions are fully as bad.
so here are the famines spoken of over at least half
the earth.
Now as to pestilences: Those who read the papers
know somewhat of the way the plague has done its
work in India. India and China are being decimated
by the plague. In China there are whole districts In
which the people have ceased to bury the dead. They
carry the bodies out to the fields and the carrion
crows, the jackals, dogs and wolves feed on the car
casses, and the disease is constantly spreading.
And now as to the "wars and rumors of wars."
Was there ever a time when the manufacturers of
deadly weapons were so busy as at present? In fact
there is not a nation on earth over which the war
clouds are not lowering, and worst of all every sign
points to the certainty that the struggle so clearly
hovering over the earth is to be a religious war, al
ways the most malignant form of strife.
To my mind the prophetic winds of Messiah. Jesu3
Christ, the Savior of the world, are coming true.
War. famine and pestilence are all on us and "men's
hearts are failing them for fear," and soon I believe
we shall see Him coming in the clouds of heaven with
power and great glory as He said He would, and then
we shall have the era 'when the lion and the lamb
shall lie down together and a little child shall lead
them."

WONDERFUL THINGS DONE WITH AND WITHOUT A STOMACH
A Woman of This City Has Her Stomach Successfully Removed,
and Now Eats Three Hearty Meals a Day and Goes About
Her Tasks as Usual, and They Say She Doesn't Even
Know Yet That She Has No Stomach*
MRS. LORA MAG IN I,
The San Francisco Woman Whose Stomach
Haa Been Removed.
THE story of the successful re
moval of a woman's stomach
three months ago by Dr. Brig
ham of this city has Just been
published in all its details by the
Boston Medical and Surgical
Journal. Outside of the removal of
the stomach the most wonderful part
of the story to the mind of the ordin
ary layman will be the fact that the
woman does not yet know that her
stomach is removed. She eats several
meals daily, goes about the house as
usual, has almost recovered her full
weight and says the doctor has com
pletely cured her. Before the operation
she could not retain solid food on her
stomach. Now she eats chicken, oys
ters, etc., and consequently feels that
she is all right.
Dr. Brigham followed the â¢ main
lines laid down by Dr. Carl Schlatter
In performing a like operation on a
woman in Zurich. In many particu
lars, however, Dr. Brigham was con
fronted with new problems, and the re
sult of the operation shows with what
skill he met them.
In speaking of the matter the editor
of the Boston Medical and Surgical
Journal says:
The operation in San Francisco of the
removal of the entire stomach has been
for the first time successfully perform
ed by Dr. Charles Brooks Brigham. As
a surgical achievement this operation
THIRTY YEARS' DISPUTE
OVER A SWINGING DOOR
JJeitftep .Husband <Nor Wife Wauld Give Up tfte Stubborn
Contest Till tfye .Man Was on .His
Deathbed.
THIRTY years of family quar
reiy. thirty years of unhappi
ness, thirty years of life wasted.
And all on account of a kitchen
door.
Such is the story that comes from
Mokelumne Hill, in Calaveras County,
and the strangest part of it all is that
the two people concerned were of
sound mind during the period. That
human beings could be so foolish hard
ly seems possible. But they were, and
there is plenty of evidence to prc-ve it.
One of the parties to this strange
story died a few weeks ago and the
other is now in the- poorhouse, a
broken-down old woman. But # time
was when they were the healthiest,
wealthiest and happiest couple in this
section of the county.
That was nearly half a century ago,
but there are neighbors still living who
well remember the day that Henry
Williams and his wife, Martha, came
into their midst. At the time the man
was about 30 years of age and the
woman a few years younger.
They took up a tract of land in fer
tile Happy Valley in Calaveras Coun
ty, and from the start prosperity was
with them. Henry built with his own
hands a comfortable log cabin, and
Martha did the work about the place
with a light heart. Their craps did
well and there, was no sickness among
the cattle, which multiplied so that each
year a goodly numoer could be sold
and a neat sum deposited in bank.
After twenty years of success and
happiness a change came. At this
time Henrj*. could have signed his
check for tens of thousands of dol
lars, and between them the couple
agreed that they had better build
themselves a new house and vacate
the log cabin that had been their home
for so many years.
"We'll need a nice place to spend our
old ag-e," said Henry.
"And I think we both deserve it.
Let's send for the carpenters to-mor
row," said Martha.
The carpenter came, and there was
no trouble at all about deciding how
i certainly takes rank as an operation of
I the first magnitude. Dr. Brigham's
i operation differs from that performed
j by Schlatter, in that he was able to unite
| the lower end of the esophagus directly
j with the cut end of the duodenum. The
] good judgment of Dr. Brigham was
I amply vindicated by the result. A brief
| consideration will justify the deduction
i that cases suited to this operation are
I rare. It is certainly ~- uncommon cx
i perience for a surgeon to meet with a
i cuse of cancer of the stomach in as
: good physical condition as was Dr.
Prigham's case. The pale, thin, worn,
cachetic victims of this disease are sel
1 dum in a condition to withstand so for
; midable an operative procedure. Drs.
j Schlatter and Brigham have shown that
I there exists a certain (probably small)
j proportion of cases in which resort to
the most radical surgical procedure
may for a time at least rescue the pa
tient. The prolongation of life may be
by no moans inconsiderable.
The portions of the report most in
teresting to the lay reader are as fol- I
I lows:
Lora Maglnni, widow and housewife,
66 years of age, had complained of pain
in her stomach for the last year. She j
was able, however, to digest her food j
until Christmas time, when she vomited j
any solid food that she took. Not car- |
ing for bread and meat, she confined |
herself to liquids and to thickened
gruels, and so was able to keep her
usual weight of 135 pounds. She did
not worry about her forced abstinence
from solid food, because she was un
able to chew properly, having but six
teeth in the lower with no correspond
ing ones in the upper jaw.
She is a remarkably healthy woman
in other respects, having a strong heart
and lungs and a clear complexion and
a good deal of color in her cheeks, a ;
woman of simple tastes, born in the
country, in the north of Italy; active,
and a woman of good common sense.
It is a difficult thing to keep her in
bed, in any ordinary illness, and she
does not complain of pain, unless it is
severe.
I saw her first in February, 1898, She
came to me for advice, on account of
the pain she felt in her stomach. There
was a hardness in the pyloric region
which was painful on pressure. All
solid food was vomited soon after it
was taken. My diagnosis was cancer
of the pylorus. At a subsequent visit
a few weeks later an operation for the
removal of the growth was suggested
and agreed upnn and the patient en
tered St. Luke's Hospital.
the house was to look, and everything
went alc.-ng smoothly. The new house
was to be built near the old log cabin.
Slowly the house came into exist
ence, and Henry and Martha watched
it like two children. For hours they
discussed the happy days they would
spend after they had "moved in."
And they would have moved in all
right if it had not been for the car
penter asking a simple question. He
had gone right ahead and done what
seemed best to him until the house
was almost finished. The couple were
always pleased with his ideas of the
way the house should be built. If he
had only gone straight ahead when
he came to the kitchen door he might
have saved two people thirty years of
misery.
"Shall I make this kitchen dooi*
swing in or out?" he asked one day as
Henry and Martha stood watching
him.
"Which is the easiest?" asked Henry.
"One way is as easy as another," an
swered the carpenter.
"Then make it swing in," said Henry.
"It will be easier for me to carry in the
wood."
"But that will give me less room in
the kitchen," objected Martha.
"Nonsense," Henry said, smiling.
"You have more room now than you
need and it makes a big difference to
me."
"Indeed!" Martha retorted, "you are
looking out for yourself and don't care
what I have to put up with."
Then the domestic storm began.
The carpenter sat down to wait until
the two people had settled their diffi
culties, but as the argument kept up
until dark he went home, thinking
surely all would be well on the mor
row. The hanging of the door was all
there was to do on the house. But days
went on and the stubborn question re
mained undetermined.
The carpenter got tired of the inter
minable dispute after a while. He
could not keep track of the reasons that
were brought up for having the door
THE KITCHEN DOOR THAT CAUSED A THIRTY YEARS' DISPUTE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE.
THE SA27 FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 22, 1898.
On the 24th of February, 1898, Dr.
Samuel Boyd assisting, strict antisepsis
being observed, the patient was ether
ized. The operation occupied two hours
and a quarter. There was practically
no loss of blood in removing the sto-
The gradual Improvement in the gen
eral condition of the patient and the in
crease In her appetite, notwithstanding
the loss of her stomach, are set forth
as follows:
February 24â At noon after the opera
! tion, pulse 116. Temperature, 9S degrees;
an enema of brandy and water was given,
i and three hours after an enema of eggs,
| peptonolds, milk and broth; these nutri
ent enemata were continued every four
hours. The patient was very restless and
thirsty. An eighth of a grain of morphine
I was given subc.utaneously, and the mouth
i was frequently washed out with water.
I The longest sleep at any time was not
i over an hour, but there were many short
naps which refreshed the patient.
February 25 â Pulse, 96. Excessive
thirst, but no pain and no vomiting. No
water allowed, but the mouth constantly
moistened.
February 2G â Pulse, 100. Claret and wa
ter, in two-drachm doses, varied occa
sionally with the same amount of hot
black coffee or chicken broth were given.
February 27â Pulse, 92. Four-drachm
doses of liquids now given. Coffee with
milk and chicken broth with an egg beat
en up in it.
February 2Sâ Pulse, 92. A fresh egg,
slightly boiled, was relished by the pa
tient, who said "It tasted nice and
sweet."
March Iâ Patient takes six drachms of
some liquid nourishment every hour,
night and day.
From March 2 to March 13â One or two
eggs daily, broth, gruels made with
prune juice, coffee with milk, and a tonic
in half-ounce doses.
March 13 to 16â For breakfast patient
had some minced chicken, a cup of coffee,
a poft-boiled egg, half a slice of toast and
two ounces of water. From this time food
was given at regular intervals of three
hours.
March 17â Pulse, 100. The patient's
nourishment consisted of: Breakfast â
Cup of coffee with milk, a soft-boiled egg,
a third of a baked apple. Noon â A cup of
green pea soup and a dozen oysters, an
ounce of milk with somatose. Afternoon-
Some orange jelly, one raw egg, a half
cup of pea soup and a dozen oysters.
Eveningâ Half-cup of asparagus soup.
In the intervals she took four drachms of
whisky with water and an ounce and. a
half of a tonic.
March ISâ Pulse 92. The patient is up in
a chair daily and walks a little in the
room. In addition to two dozen oysters
she took a part of a lamb chop and sev
eral spoonfuls of ice cream.
March litâ Pulse f'2. Patient on the hos
pital piazza in a rolling chair for nearly
ooooooooooooooooooc
I hung as each wished, and after a time
he remained away hoping: that the dis
pute would reach an early and a natu
ral end. But days went by into weeks,
and weeks wore into months, and still
no decision was reached. At *ast the
carpenter thought it best to intercede
with a suggestion, and so try and settle
the ouarrel.
"Let me make It a sliding door," he
proposed.
For a while both seemea to be struck
by the idea and each waited for the
other to speak. Henry looked at Mar
tha. She remained silent.
"All right; go ahead," he said to the
carpenter. "That suits me."
"But it doesn't suit me," objected the
wife. "I don't want any sliding doors.
Dirt gets behind them; they get out of
order; lots of things happen to sliding
doors. If you make that a sliding door,
Henry Williams, you can live in that
j house all by yourself, and that settles
that point."
And so the quarrel became a feud.
There was enough pride in the old
couple to desire to keep the fact of their
quarrel a secret. And they succeeded
for a time. The carpenter was paid for
his work and allowed to leave the sec
tion. For a time the neighbors won
dered why the new house was not occu
pied. Questioning the old couple
brought unsatisfactory answers.
"Will move into it when we are
ready," said Henry.
Gradually, however, by close watch
ing and dint of cross-questioning the
story of the kitchen door came out.
Then the whole country side marveled
and watched for the outcome of the
stubborn contest.
As the years wore on and the neg
lected house was going to ruin hus
band and wife scarcely spoke to one
another. If one or the other ever at
tempted to speak the kitchen-door sub
ject was sure to crop out and cause a
lively quarrel.
Ten years, twenty years, twenty-nine
years passed and the stubborn point re
mained steadfastly unsettled.
Then one clay a few weeks ago Henry
was taken very sirk. Inquisitive neigh
bors asked questions and the doctor
shook his head.
"You must get Mr. Williams out of
this old house." he told Martha, "or T
will give up the case. Your husband
is no longer a young man and ho will
die here in two or three days if you
pf-rsist in keeping him in this old cabin.
Why don't you move him into the big
house?"
I two hours. In addition to her regular
nourishment the patient enjoyed squab.
March 20 to 23â In addition to other
nourishment seven ounces of mulled wine
were given at bed time.
March 23â Pulse 102 Patient walked
from her room to the piazza, where she
sat for two hours In the sun. Then walk
ed back to her room.
March 24 to 28â Patient gained five
pounds. Prom 116 increased to 121 pounds.
March 2Sâ Patient in a reclining position
out on piazza most of the day. For the
first time since the operation said she felt
really hungry; the way she ate a squab
amply proved it.
It is still a question with her how to
I produce sleep without an opiate. Sulfo
! nal, trional. bromo caffeine and bromide
of potash all excite rather than soothe
the restlessness. Morphine alone is suffi
cient if given in quarter-grain dosea.
March 30 to April 7â Patient gained one
j pound; is on the piazza all day; walks
| alone; raid's the paper and is very active
and cheerful.
April 10 â The following shows the
amount of food taken by the patient a
day from now on: At 6:30 a. m., a cup
of coffee and n raw egg; a.t 10 o'clock, two
dozen oysters and a bowl of broth; at 1
o'clock, half a broiled chicken, with toast
and stewed strawberries; at 5 o'clock.
half a boiled chicken, two slicea of toast
j and a cup of tea. Pulse 84.
April 14â Weight 122 pounds.
The symptom which gave the most
j anxiety after the operation was the rest
! lessness, which was unusually marked.
; This was without doubt the result of the
i surgical shock which was caused by the
j removal of so important an organ as the
; stomach and the interfering with its yes
â¢ sels And nerves.
The season of the year in California,
j with mild, sunny days, and the careful
and constant nursing are among the fac
torfe which made the operation a success.
Many old people can stand in the sur
! gioal point of view much more than is
I generally supposed.
The patient was not worried about her
1 self. All she wished for was to be re
j stored to health; how this was to be ac
: eomplished she never asked. AND TO
THIS DAY SHE DOES NOT KNOW
i THAT HER STOMACH HAS BEEN KE-
MuVED.
She has a fine color. Complains of noth
ing as far as the functions of her body
goes; eats whatever she wishes; has no
pain whatever; is of a very cheerful dis
position. She is out of doors most of
the day from 10 to 5 o'clock; her tem
perature and pulse is normal an\l she
sleeps well without an opiate.
Although she has food eVery three
hours she feels quite hungry at times and
says she could eat twice as much as is
given her. She is regaining her normal
weight.
In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge
my great indebtedness to Dr. Carl
Schlatter of Zurich for his description of
the operation and subsequent treatment
which has been invaluable to me in mak
ing this case successful.

The patient has been gaining five

Martha's heart softened.
Going in to her husband she called
: him gently and said: "Dear. lam win
1 ing to have the kitchen door swing in
! and we'll move into the new house to
! morrow."
Henry promptly felt ashamed of him
| self for the course he had pursued in
the dispute. "No," he answered. "We'll
move if you want to and the kitchen
door can swing out."
"But, really," urged Martha, "it does
not make any difference which way the
door swings."
"Then fix it to suit yourself," said
Henry.
Martha had the door hung to swing
in. She then had a few pretty things
brought from town, moved in some fur
niture, and then the neighbors carried
: Henry over and put him into his new
j bed. Martha became something like
â  her old self and bustled about as well
!as her years would permit to make
| Henry comfortable and nurse him back
! to health.
In this she partly succeeded, for in
a few days the old man was up and
moving about the new house. He was
as happy as a child and enjoyed every
new thing and the bright surroundings
to the utmost. "It's really much bet
ter than the old place, isn't it?" he said.
"And the door'sâ well, the door's all
right. What did we ever row over it
for, anyway?"
Martha shook her head sadly. "L.ci
it pass with the thirty years." she said.
"We haven't many more of them to
enjoy."
Sure enough, the happiness of the old
couple in their new home was destined
to be brief. Age was already telling
on the husband and the question over
the door being gone he seemed to settle
quickly.
After a few days he had a relapse
which the. doctor could not overcome-.
One day Martha came into the room
after half an hour's absence and found
that her husband had passed away.
And now some of the neighbors are
wondering if the old gentleman
wouldn't have remained alive had he
remained Imbued with his willful and
stubborn spirit to have the door swing
as he wanted it to.
An Ailing Professional "Glass Swailower" in St. Louis Has a
Miscellaneous Lot of Glass, Nails, Tacks, Cartridges and \
Knife Blades Removed From His Stomach and Is Now
Doing as Well as Ever on a Glass Diet*
SIGNOR RfINANA GIVING AN EXHIBITION OF SWALLOWING BITS OF IRON AND GLASS.
The above miscellaneous lot of nails, screws, cartridges, tacks, pieces of chain and knife blades represent part of
the stuff taken out of a professional glass swallower's stomach during a recent operation In St. Louis. Signor Ran
ana had been in the business for years giving exhibitions daily without suffering any evil effects. At last he was
overtaken with "stomach-ache." He was placed under an X ray and it was quickly demonstrated that he contained
the contents of an ordinary junk shop. After the operation Signor Ranana said he was as well as ever and ready to
eat a bottle factory.
AVERT curious case of "glass |
swallowing" has just been made \
public by the American Medical
Association Journal of Chicago.
The case is that of "Signor
Ranana," who swallowed nails, glass,
bits of chain, knife blades and almost
anything he could get into his mouth.
He did this publicly for several years;
then he was taken ill. His stomach was
cut open by Dr. A. H. Meisenbach and
a miscellaneous junk shop was re
moved from his interior. Signor Ra
nana termed himself "The Human Os
trich," and had followed the profes
sion of swallowing glass, metal, etc.,
for a period of nine years. He presented
himself to the clinic of Dr. Meisenbach
and stated that his father and mother
were living and of a very nervous tem
perament. He was 22 years old and
had received a very fair education, at
tending public high school and college.
While still at school he witnessed in
March, 18S8, an exhibition by a profes
sional glass eater. He paid $10 to learn
the feat and after a few days he found
he" could perform the operation nicely.
First he gave private exhibitions and
took great interest in swallowing other
objects, as nails and sword swallow
ing^ In 1894 he joined a specialty com
pany and since that time he has been
continually giving private and public
exhibitions, at least one or two a week.
He does not remember the quantity of
things swallowed.
In the early part of March, 1897, he
started out on a trip, and, on account
of scarcity of funds, was obliged to
give as many as from six to twelve ex
hibitions daily in saloons and else
where, but he did not swallow much at
a time, only a bit or two of glass, four
or live nails, screws and a few fence
staples. He always carried a supply
of objects, so as to be able to give an
exhibition of swallowing at any time.
In his repertoire were pearl top lamp
chimneys, two, four, six and eight pen
ny nails, wire fence nails, barbed wire
fence staples and thirty-two and thirty
eight caliber cartridges. He never
swallowed tacks.
The patient stated that, up to 1897.
he never had any trouble; but on
March 15 he gave a number of exhibi
tions, and on March 16 he began to
feel ill. Dr. Meisenbach examined the
patient and found he weighed 133
pounds; his color was pale, his gums
spongy, and his breath very foul; his
pulse 76, temperature 9S degrees and
respiration 23.
The stomach was inflated with air,
so as to more clearly outline its lower
part. It was decided to demonstrate,
if possible, the mass of foreign mater
ial by the use of X rays.
Having enlarged the stomach Incision
the doctor introduced his hand. He
scooped out the remaining articles and
worked very carefully, so as not to in
jure the stomach walls and also not
to cut his fingers on the sharp points
of the nails, staples and the broken
pieces of glass.
The objects were all clean. The Iron
was blued and smoothed, 1 the pieces
of glass and copper of their natural
color and bright. During the opera
tion of the removal of the objects there
was a continued secretion Into the sto
mach taking place, so that it was ne
cessary every now and then to mop
this out by means of gauze sponges.
The list of articles removed from the
stomach and shown in our engraving
is as follows: Twenty-five staples for
barbed fence wire; fifteen 1 Mi-Inch
screws; six 2-inch horseshoe nails; six
teen 2-inch wire nails; thirty I^-inch
wire nails; sixteen 32-caliber "cart-AT THE CASEâ ANY OLD OFFICEâ MIDNIGHT.

WHO wouldn't be a striking
printer?
Truly that Individual at
the present time ought to be
the happiest man alive. He
has nothing to do but eat, drink and
sleep and amuse himself. And all be
neath the cool shadows of a poetic re
treat in a giant redwood forest.
How does this dream of sylvan joy
come about at a time when the men
concerned are supposed to be hard up?
That's just it. They are hard up. But
they have struck a new scheme that
seems to contain the possibilities of
helping their cause and giving them a
good season of outdoor recreation at
the same time.
All this came about as a result of the
present printers' strike not turning out
exactly as was desired. That is the
strike showed a disposition to last
longer â a good deal longer â than was
figured on.
Then came the important question:
"How long can we hold ut?" From
the outlook it was calculated that the
bosses might hold out for a good long
time. This led to a consideration on
the part of the rtrike managers as to
the best wty of husbanding resources.
In other words t< make the money on
hand last as long as possible and go the
farthest among the printers out on
strike.
Surely there are wise men among the
strike managers of the Typographical
Union for th y hit upon the unique
scheme of sending the strikers into
camp in the country where their living
expenses would be cut down to the low
est possible figure. Here the encamped
printers are in a position to hold out
against the proprietors for months and
months and it becomes a Question of
nip and tuck.
To find a suitable camping place was
not a difficult matter in a country
where they are as plentiful as in Cali
fornia. After looking at a rood many

mittee decided on a nook in Paper Mill

â  â town for lack of the trading instinct; \
England maintains her supremacy by j
commercial enlightenment, and Ameri- i
Jca prospers beyond all other nations
through her unparalleled resources and
rare business energy and insight.
Wherever we look we see the world's j
interest and its subjugating hosts col
lecting at the dictates of commerce.
Now it is Africa, Australia and the sea-

STRIKING PRINTERS
ENJOYING LIFE IN CAMP
I struggling to control its western shoreÃ
j California is preparing to stretch out
i an answering hand, and very appro
priately, because of its partially en
forced isolation eastward by mountain
and by desert. With a population
equal to that of Paris and with an area
equal to that of France; able to flood
Eastern markets and yet unable to ex
haust its own capacity to produce, its
j westward glance shows it the Pacific,
inviting to a great commercial con
quest.
As early as 1868, in the act that
I founded the University of California
| appears a statutory provision for the
establishment of a college of com
merce, but until the present this act,
notable as the first of the kind in the
I United States, has remained in abey
; ance. The time now being deemed
| ripe for executing the plans of the
founders, a special committee, of which
President Kellogg is a member, was
appointed early last summer and has
just reported.
The committee considers that there
1 are at least forty subjects which should
come within the scope of a college of
; commerce. Some of these are already
; taught in the university, others could
i easily be provided under existing con
ditions, leaving about fourteen for
which special provision would be neces
j sary.
Some of the more interesting fea
; tures of the new department will be a
i commercial museum, where will be col
Creek Canyon. It is about two miles
this side of Camp Taylor on the San
Francisco and North Pacific Coast
Railroad and is as pretty a spot as
can be found in the Stat and seems
admirably suited to the purpose.
The first batch of men was sent up
there about two weeks ago and since
then the numbers have daily increased
until at present there are about fifty
enjoying life in the wildwood. In real
ity there are two camps, the typesetters
and the pressmen, but they are close
enough together to be just like one.
Both of the camps are supplied with
the best the market affords and are as
comfortable as they can b made. Not
a thing is wanting that can be con
veniently added to the camp.
From the very first the striking print
ers took to life in camp with great zest.
There was a certain amount of novelty
about it and at the same time it was
enjoyable. Added to this was the fact
that they were aiding their cause by
staying there and making it easier for
the others. The less they used of the
union funds for their own support the
more there would be for the married
men.
For the purpose of seeing just how
the striking printers put in their time
I paid a visit to their camp a few days
ago. It was not as pleasant a day as
they had been having, the delegation
that met me at the train said. The
sun was just managing to shine and
there was a cold dampness in the air
not pleasant to say the least.
The printers, however, did not seem
to notice it. Some were running around
in their shirt sleeves and a few were
wading in the waters of the creek. A
big log fire burned near the base of a
redwood tree and filled the air in its
immediate vicinity with a most whole
some warmth, but nobody appeared to
take advantage of it. L.ying on a log
a few feet away one of the campers
was reading, apparently as comfortable
as if he were in a parlor in San Fran
cisco.
""We don't care whether the strike
lasts all summer." said Lieutenant Til
ly, the spokesman of the crowd, as he
led the way to the "kitchen," where a
big pan of freshly caught trout were
beine: browned in sizzling butter. A
coffee pot. boiling noisily, filled the air
with aroma and some toasting bread
lected specimens of all kinds of raw
material, with models of the most ap
proved methods of working them; a
course on means of commerce, which
will include all details of harbors, ves
sels, motors, railroads, telegraphs, tele
phones, postal service and lighting; the
course on insurance agencies, loss of
property and life, embracing the im
portant matter of employers' liability;
the course on international trade and
its usages; the course on foreign com
mercial legislation, which will explain
the various artificial trade hindrances,
and the course on fiscal legislation,
which will deal with customs and
taxes; also the consular service, where
in will be included those subjects that
are too often but little understood by
appointees sent abroad purely for polit
ical reasons.
There Is a system in vogue in cer
tain European trade schools by which
three years" traveling scholarships of
about $50 a month are given. The re
cipient has to spend most of the time in
such foreign ports as may be agreed
upon, and to give occasional reports
to show that he is making the best use
of his time.
This plan will also be adopted by the
University of California College of
Commerce and tend vastly to the
breaking down of international preju
dices.
Unfortunately, It does nnt belong to
America to claim priority of thought in
the direction of such a college, though
in thoroughness of plan it will probably
excel all. There are probably sixty
commercial high schools in the German
empire, ten in France and Belgium and
fifteen in the Austrian empire and
Italy, which schools average 125 pupils
each. Some of these were founded over
a hundred years ago, but most of them
quite recently.
Instruction usually extends through
three years, covering generally the
â  same subjects in all the schools. The
1 first two years are devoted to train
ing appropriate to retail business,
while the third year seems to prepare
students. for wholesale business. Here
â  the work is broader and more compre
hensive, and many who take this
course are those who have already
taken their bachelor degrees in some
other faculty.
The success of these schools has been
decidedly creditable considering that
i they have been developed outside of
j and in spite of university and pedagogic
| effort, growing according to the en- j
: lightened-spirit of their communities. It !
: is said that not one of over a thousand !
graduates of these schools in France j
has abandoned his chosen career, and
! that about 18 per cent of these gradu- I
j ates are devoting themselves to for
' eign commerce. :..'v
In the United States there are a few
similar schools of recent establishment.
About fifteen years ago the Wharton
' School of Finance and Economy was
i established in the University of Perm
: sylvania. This excellent department
affords instruction which should cer
! tainly form a part of a complete col- .
j lege of commerce. The president of the I
University of Chicago also has recently j
I announced a prospective department in
that institution with aims and methods '
similar to those of the Wharton School, i
to be called later a college of commerce j
and politics.
The new College of Commerce of the
University of California will be started j
this year. ____________Â»_Â«
PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S KINDNESS. \
"Three tiny kittens were crawling j
about the tent at the time. The moth- j
er had died, and the little wanderers j
were expressing their grief by mewing |
piteously. Mr. Lincoln picked them up, j
I took them on his lap, stroked their soft
! fur and murmured: 'Poor little creat
i ures, you'll -be taken good care of," and
turning to Bowers, said: 'Colonel. I
hope you will see that these little moth
erless waifs are given plenty of milk
and treated kindly.' Bowers replied: j
'I will see, Mr. President, that they are !
taken in charge by the cook of our
men, and are well cared for.' Several
times during his stay Mr. Lincoln was
found fondling these kittens. He would
wipe their eyes tenderly with his hand- j
kerchief, stroke their smooth coats and j
I listen to them purring their gratitude ;
;to him. It was a curious sight at an ;
I army headquarters, upon the eve of a
! great military crisis in the nation's his- \
tory, to see the hand which had af- !
fixed the signature to the Emancipation j
Proclamation, and had signed the com
mission of all the heroic men who
served the cause of the Union, from
I the general-in-chief to the lowest lieu
| tenant, tenderly caressing three stray j
kittens. It well illustrated the kindness '
of the man's disposition, and showed
the childlike simplicity which was min
gled with the grandeur of his nature."
indicated that somebody was about to
eat.
"Whose is this?" called out the lieu
tenant as soon aa he discovered the
tempting layout.
"They're mine," answered a man who
had been chopping wood a few feet
away and came hurrying out to take
care of what he was cooking.
"But it's only 10 o'clock," ventured
the lieutenant.
"Don't care if it's only 9," answered
the owner of the fish, as he turned
them over and caused them to sizzle
more than ever, "I had breakfast at 5
and I am hungry now and I tell you I
am going to eat."
"That's the way with these fellows,"
said the lieutenant, "they rre no sooner
done one meal than they start in on
another. It seems to me they are eat
ing all the time."
But there was plenty to eat and
drink, too, for that matter. Nailed to
the trunks of trees were big cupboards
filled with all sorts of edibles. In a
big Dutch oven a roast of beef was
cooking and a pan of bread was "rais
ing" near by. There was no sign of
want in this camp.
Then the lieutenant led the way and
showed how the boys put in the time.
All along the banks of the creek patient
anglers were trying to lure the trout
from its hiding place beneath the rooks,
and they were succeeding pretty well,
judging by the partly filled baskets.
Every few minutes the crack of a
gun told that somebody was shooting
in the woods and bringing down game,
tco. Some of the boys simply amused
themselves by watching the others.
"We'll eat the game after they get
it," they said.
The little work about camp really
amounts to nothing. The keeping of
the tents in order and repairing the
table and chairs is really all there is
to do except cooking and they take
turns at this so that it does not really
count as part of the duties of the day.
The rest of the time the striking
printers put in as they please and
surely it is put in pleasantly. At night
the crowd gather around the camp
fire and toll ptories and sing songs as
campers will until it is time to retire,
and then they go to sleep ami dream
that the strike is going to last forever
hfrause the camp is such a great suc
cess.
ARE SUDDEN DEATHS
ON THE INCREASE ?
Cororrjents of Prominent Physicians on the Untimely Taking Off of Remenyi, Judge Campbell ar)d
Manager Walter aod the Causes That Lead to Such Sudden Deaths.
ARE sudden deaths becoming
more common?
Physicians are divided in their
opinions. There are those who
stoutly assert that sudden
deaths due to apoplectic at
tacks and heart disease are more num
erous than of yore, and there are
thos<' who combat this statement.
The sudden deaths of Remenyi and
Judge Campbell have occasioned re
newed interest in the debatable theory.
Both of these men were struck down
in the midst of performing their duties;
the one while attending the meeting of
a society of which he was president,
the other while playing to a big au
dience.
Judge Campbell, from all accounts,
felt no premonitory symptoms until a
few hours before he passed away.
Remenyi had been warned months be
forehand that he had alarming symp
toms. And only the day before the
physician whom he consulted, Dr.
Winslow Anderson, told him that his
attempting to play might prove fatal.
Just before going on the stage and
while standing in the wings Remenyi
turned to Manager Morrissey and, pat
ting his violin, said, "This is the best
friend I have." And while playing his
third encore, the beautiful pizzicato
passage from "Sylvia," he stopped sud
denly pitched forward and dropped
dead.
It is a curious fact that most musi

cians, no matter what the cause of
their deaths, are said to have had a
premonition some time beforehand.
Mendelssohn felt that his end was
near despite his apparently good
health. A deep gloom settled on him.
In vtiin his friends tried to help him re
gain his habitually cheerful nature.
He met their advances with the reply,
"The time is short and I must work."
He had just finished one of the most
beautiful of the "Songs Without
Words" series when he was seized with
an apoplectic attack from which he
never recovered.
Mozart was .sitting alone in the twi
light, when a stranger in a peculiar
gray garb appeared, and giving an or
der for a requiem to be composed with
out fail in a month, departed. The
stranger went as silently and myster
iously as he came, leaving neither his
name nor address. The appearance of
the stranger, his mysterious manner,
the half-dark setting for the seene â all
combined to make the supersensitive
Mozart believe that he had seen a vis
ion.^
"The requiem will be my own," he
said.
His wife and friends tried to per
suade him that the whole affair was
but a twilight fancy. Hut the next i
night, at the same time, the stranger i
came again and reminded Mozart of ;
his promise, then vanished.
Mozart thenceforth became the prey
of superstitious fancies. Silent and
melancholy, he commenced to labor j
with intense absorption on the funeral
mass. A fatal pallor was soon no

score till he swooned away, and only
came to consciousness to bend his wan
ing energies again to the ghastly work.
He felt bound by his promise to com-.
plete the work, though it was plainly;
killing him. His misery became un
bearable, and while working on the
almost completed requiem he breathed
out his life.
The mysterious visitor, whom Mozart
believed to be the precursor of hia
death, was the eccentric Count "Wai- j
seek, who had lost his wife and wished
a musical memorial.
The list of noted people who have
died suddenly is made up for the most
part of men; women are less subject to,
apoplexy. There are several notable
exceptions, as In the case of Cath-i
erine II of Russia, who, although ab
stemious in her eating and very tem
perate, was found dead from an apo
plectic stroke. â¢
The physicians, when called In for
sudden death, often find it a fine point
to determine whether the falling down
produced apoplexy, or whether apo
plexy caused the fall.
Dr. Winslow Anderson, who attended
Remenyi the day before his death, said ;
that apoplectic cases are becoming j
more common. "People eat and drink,
too much, and that accounts for the In-;
crease in the number of victims of apo-,
plexy. There is almost always a pre
monition beforehand. A slight shak-,

Don't be shocked; this doesn't
necessarily mean that she is pur

neither does it meanâ horrible thoughtâ
that she is getting her hair bleach on;

With a very fashionable hairdressing of
her own.
When I say the summer girl is getting
her summer hair "ready," I mean that
she is studying her face and her cos
tumes. These to the summer girl mean
a great deal.
The styles for summer hair is either
very high or very low. That is as she
may fancy. But the hair must be puffed
around the face. This is arbitrary. You
must take your hair and form it into a
Marlborough puff, reaching from ear to
ear across the crown of the head, or you
cannot hope to be really in style. If
you want to wear your hair parted you
need puff only the sides, but the puff
is quite necessary.
There are four distinct and distinctive
styles for the summer hair. One is the
Marlborough or round coiffure. This is
very easily made, and yuu can do it
yourself without any trouble. Divide the
hair across the lop of the head about
at the line known to hairdressers as the
â¢â¢half dead line." Tie the back hair se
curely with a string. Choose a string
that matches your own hair, so that it
will not show. Con.b the front down
over your face and pin the long pompa
dour puff or "rat" in the hair. Fasten
it on each side and on the top. Now
comb the front hair back over the "rat"
and fasten it with hair pins at the point
where the hair is tied. Twist a knot

NEGRO CAMP-MEETING
WHY DOWN IN DIXIE
JACKSONVILLE. Fla.. May 9.â
Northern people have little idea of the j
strange doctrines sometimes preached
to negroes in remote districts. The
hymns and sermon here quoted were
actually delivered at the "passover" of
the "church made without hands," and
were taken down verbatim.
That the title of the church, remind- i
ing him of old Puritan baptismal !
names, is appropriate, the visitor sees
at a glance. The place of worship is
within the border of a wild orange j
grove, where the trees, below the frost I
line, are so thick as to be impervious to
any but the hardest shower. The seats
are of pine logs, and the pulpit has been j
fashioned of stumps and dwarf trees j
with considerable ingenuity. It is just
such a temple as our forefathers wor
shiped in when the hatchet was as yet j
the only tool, and the primitive effect is i
greatly heightened by thf 1 simple col- |
ored congregation with their scant fin
ery, their barefooted children, the ox i
carts across the crooked path, and the :
mothers tending their babies outside
the sanctuary, yet near enough to re- j
ceive the full benefit of the sermons.
For that matter one might be quite out :
of sight and still hear every word dcliv- j
ered in the stentorian tones of the col- ,
ored country preacher. Their opening
hymn is always the same:

coll itâ just as you may please.
Before beginning to dress the hair it is
a rood thing to wave tne entire front.
To wave it properly take a very large
hair curler and heat it. Open the curl
er wide and twist the strand around the
bar of iron. Twist it to t!ie very end
of the bar. Close the clamp upon it
and hold it long enougti to count sixty
slowly. Release the .strand of hair and
yon will find that it is in the form of
;i long curl. Do this with a few strands
until the whole front is curled. Wavers
do very well, and you can purchase those
that wave three waves at a time.
The Delia Fox curl is a distinctive
name given to a certain coiffure which
was made popular by the little comedi
enne. The Delia Fox curl consists of a
tiny curl right in the middle of the fore-
The hair is turned back and
waved on the sides. The strand is then
brought down in front and given a twist
with the tongs. This makes the center
curl. Small ringlets are twisted up at
the temples and the coiffure is com
pleted by twisting the hair in a curl at
thÂ»' (rown of the head and sticking fancy
pins in it.
The distressing points so observable <n
square foreheads may be obviated by
these little temple curls. They may be
small or large, tight or loose, only they
must be short and sure to stay in curl.
Women who have low foreheads can re
joice that they do not need these temple
curls. â 
The beauty coiffure is the prettiest one
of alt. It "is adaoted to all faces and
the woman whu wants to be very sure
of looking well can follow it. It can be
made almost entirely of lung hair and is
in all respects the best coiffure for sum
mer US".
To fashion the beauty coiffure it is nec
essary to have the hair well shampooed.
The hair should be shampooed at least
once a month and, preferably . once in
three weeks in order to keep out the su
perabundance of natural oil. Now. with
the aid of the hair-curler, lay waves In
the entire front, sides and back of the
hair where it borders on the neck, and

A word about the use of hair ribbons.
Let them be absolutely fresh. "Do not
wear a ribbon more than once" is the ad
vice given by a very celebrated fashion
writer of Paris. This, however, is so ex
pensive that the average woman cannot
follow it. lietter to make a small bow
and use It two or three times with great
care. But if a ribbon is actually tied
around the hair It becomes too soiled at
one using to be presentable again.
Combs for the hair are high and very
ornamental. You can scarcely get them
too fancy. A woman of the Latin quarter
of New York gave a Bohemian tea to her
artistic friends. She wore the literary
coiffure, and nestling in her hair was a
comb of huge proportions. The top was
of black bent work of a nature that did
not readily reveal itself. The lady ex
plained afterward that, the comb was
made by herself of bent iron work and
was fitted to tho teeth of a small back
comb. A great deal is possible with these
shell combs, and one can really make
very pretty comhs. Although this is not
actually advocated, an instance may bn
mentioned of a comb that attracted much
attention and was certainly cheap.
A woman who belongs to the aforemen
tioned literary clique of New York was
the mists of a shadowy past.

A -'nute later they are joining in one
of the hymns peculiar to the race:
CHARACTER IN WALKING.
Experts say that handwriting never
varies In its essence â that is, that its
true characteristics are always pre
served, even rhen one attempts to
imitate the writing of another. But
still we know that forgeries suffi
ciently clever to bewilder handwriting
experts have been perpetrated, and it
is also certain that, granted a certain
"knack" and peculiar talent, a most
characteristic signature can be so imi
tated as to defy anything more than
grave suspicion of the committal of a
forgery.
Walking, however, says Tit-Bits,
comes under another category. No
man can imitate another's walk for
more than two or three steps without
making it obvious to any but the
densest observer that he is actingâ
walkingâ part; that he is thinking
constantly of the length of his stride,
of the way the foot should reach and
leave the "ground, of the speed and of
the swing of the body. So very char
acteristic is walking that even the most
unobservant requires only to hear
three or four footfalls in a passageway,
etc., without seeing the walker, to be
absolutely assured of his individuality,
if, of course, the walker is familiar to
the listener.
And how does character show itself
in walking? I should be inclined to say,
"In every way." For example, could
one imagine a busy, alert criminal law
yer lolling along with a long, heavy,
laborious stride, or could one imagine a
lethargic, unambitious, routine life liv
ing farm laborer pass along a street
with a springy, alert, active and nerv
ous tread?
The cautious, auspicious man could
not possibly walk In the same manner
as the hail fellow well met, open handed
sportsman, neither could the walk of
the dignified High Church clergyman
resemble that of the bustling, all-there
grocer bent on making himself a mil
lionaire.
The cowardly cannot walk as do the
fearless, the restless not as the phleg
matic. And for this reason it seems to
me that the police have often some
thing stronger to go on when they find
a prisoner's bootmark tallies with the
Impress of the foot of the known crim

desirous of wearing a suit of cerise or
coral red. When it came to her hair she
rejected the small cerise bow of ribbon
provided her, and, selecting a large rub
ber comb, she dipped it in melted sealing
wax until It became a very beautiful and
gorgeous ornament for the hair. Its
small curves showed off beautifully in the
red wax, and its gloss made it the most
attractive decoration imaginable.
The style of wearing the hair depends
this summer less upon the shape of the
fare than ever before. Every woman, no
matter how broad her face may be. wears
tho side puffs if she feels like it. and ev
ery woman, no matter how tall her face
may be, wears the high pompadour if she
wants to.
This pompadour, however, is not adapt
ed to either the sailor or the alpine hat,
and should be left out of the coiffure
when these hats are worn. As it is to be
a curl summer, it would be refreshing to
the summer girl to know that she can
buy very small love curls sticking to
hairpins. These may be stuck into the
coiffure wherever they produce good ef
fects. Of these hairpins it may be said
that they are warranted not to loosen,
and the summer girl need not worry about
losing them.
hailed from the Middle Westâ who led
the manners, customs, even the emo
tions of one and a.ll. She was acknowl
edged queen and had, with a subtlety
born of French extraction, established
laws and rules which bound the other
guests to a conventional line of pro
cedure from which neithc- old nor
young ever attempted to diverge. The
scepter she wielded was one of money
and family coupled with an undisputed
talent for generalship; but above all
she was gifted with an exceedingly
sharp tongue. And people were afraid
of this society matron. She cared not
what she said, nor in what sort of
language her views were communicated
and her weapons were indeei formid
able. That she inspired fear she was
well aware, and she took so much pride
therein that many a reputation fell by
the wayside to strengthen and gird the
power of her sway.
One bright, sunny clay Captain Dewey
arrived at the resort and registered.
The society matron sniffed at the U. S.
N. inscribed after his name and inti
mated that our navy was all for show;
however, it was but an intimation, for
the captain had only just arrived, she
knew naught against him and had not
decided whether to make or mar him.
Moreover the men of our navy were
adjuncts to cotillons, Friday nights,
Fortnightlys and other social functions
and were not to be lightly disposed of.
That night Captain Dewey wandered
into the cafe attached to the hotel in
search of congenial spirits. While lean
ing upon the counter waiting for the
filling of his order the captain entered
into conversation with Ivo or three
guests of the hotel who were standing
about.
"Six lemon seltzers for room 23," said
a bellboy as he entered the bar.
And the gallant captain, whose
trained and lightning glance saw
everything in a flash, oDserved that this
order was promptly filled while others.
THE DELLA FOX CURL.
ENGLISHWOMEN AS VIEWED
BY A CALIFORNIA GIRL
ASIDE from the dirty, dingy ap
pearance of London, the thing
that must strike the American
visitor mr.-st forcibly is the con
trast in the appearance of Eng-
l ish men and women. An Englishman
! dresses with a simple elegance that is
j not to be equaled except by some
! American men, while it would seem
: that the women, in order to make their
I lords and masters appear to better ad-
I vantage, clothe themselves in gowns
j that should have been consigned to the
j ragbag a couple of generations ago.
An infallible way of telling that an
J Englishwoman has on a new gown is
j from the air of conscious superiority
with which she passes her less for
tunate sisters.
London presumably follows the
French fashions, but by the time they
have been modified to suit the English
idea at beauty they are hardly recog
nizable. The English are very slow at
adopting a new fashion.
In America the styles appear almost
simultaneously with Paris, but it takes
almost a year for a fashion to cross the
channel. There are certain fashions of
purely English origin that never go out.
The tailor-made Jacket kept its com
paratively small sleeve when all the
rest of the world was wearing large
ones, and the very straight, very nar
row and very short skirt is a thing that
is to be seen at all times. That it is
practical is very true, but when one
considers that there is Uttle choice be

his own among them, were put aside.
A hero is not always a hero and Cap
tain Dewey waxed exceeuing wroth at
this.
"First enmc first -served!" was the
gist of his further remarks. But some
body carelessly said:
"Oh, it's for room 23, you know!"
Captain Dewey said no more, but
room 23 was engraved on his heart in
letters of blood and the seeds f a great
revolt were planted in his breast that
night.
When his glass was handed to him
he looked smilingly around with re
stored good nature.
"Glad to see you on board!" he said,
jokingly employing the naval toast.
Just then a small yellow dog came up
to him and, rubbing against his leg,
looked up into his face with big. pa
thetic, intelligent eyes and the captain
stooped down and patted him on the
head.
ThÂ« barkeeper started to chase the
canine intr ider from the -.amaculaie
precincts of his bar, bu. the dog only
shrunk closer to the captain, while
gazing at him with his serious brown
eyes, in which ail the beauty lacking
in his small body seemed concentrated.
It appeared that the dog had wan
dered in, a stranger among strangers,
and he had no place and no master in
the fashionable hotel â nor maybe in
the whole world. "I'll adopt you, my
tween English and Chicago women i
where feet are concerned one would :
expect the fashions to be regulated ac- i
cordingly. The advantage, however, lies '
with the Chicago women, for, like all
Americans, they are well shod, and a
well-fitting and presentable pair of
boots c.-f English make are not to be had
for love or money.
The styles in coiffure are also sup
posed to be Parisian, but as English
women always wear their hair Hat at :
the sides of the head the modifications ,
in the style are very slight. The co- !
quettish little knob which the fair
Parisians pose with such artistic effect j
at different angles on their heads j
swells to unsightly proportions in Lon
don.
English women as a rule, have beau- |
tiful heads of hair, but they like to :
give the impression of having even |
more, the result being that they often \
give their heads an unwieldy look.
The French women and their figures
are laughed at in England, and be as- |
sured no compliment is meant if one is
told one looks French. The ideal Eng- i
lish figure is thin, straight and angular,
no curves, and anything approaching
the pretty roundness or the French
and American figure? is regarded as be- ;
in- "disgustingly stout."
The Englishwoman has but one pro
fessionâmarriage. It Ifl instilled in her
from childhood that the crowning point
â¢ltd object of her life is a "good mar
riage"; from a worldly point of view,
of course. Her early aspirations are for
a title, a little later on money will do,
but in the end she is generally content
to take what she can get, for spinster
hood is considered a disgrace.
The education of the average Eng- ;
lish srirl does not tend lo develop he
boy," said Captain Dewey, at last, "and
I'll christen you Toddy In commemora
tion of your arrival with a very delic
ious one."
And so Toddy had a master and the
devotion he felt for him must have
been born of the martial tie between
â Joe Toddy was a fighter.
His big, pathetic brown eyes could
change at the sight of a canine rival
into sparkling orbs, emitting red flashes,
and his tail would assume a saucy,
bristling aspect calculated to exasper
ate the enemy to charge.
Now, it so happened that in all this
big hostelry there was but one other
dogâ dogs not being barred by the
management â and he belonged to room
23, and the society matron; and he reÂ«
joiced in the name of "Whisky." He
was about thrice the size of Toddy, but
not brave in proportion, and it was
thought that Toddy inspired the canine
battle.
A swift rush and scamper was
heard, followed by angry barkings,
snarlings, whinings, yelpings and sul
len growlings.
The sounds were ominous; the guests
on the veranda started to their feet.
It was not more than a moment be
fore the society matron of room 23 was
on the scene.
Captain Dewey appeared at the
same moment.
The owners of the dogs were fol
lowed by every man of which this coun
try resort could boast â each and all
glad of a break in the monotony of
country life â and by several conserva
tive ladies, would-be backers of the so
ciety matron.
Whisky and Toddy had met; and the
fur flew.
"Separate them!'.' "Gee whiz!" "Oh,
my!" and "Sick 'em!" were heard from
all sides.
So energetic was the attack that it
was almost impossible to distinguish
one do? from the other, or to deter
mine which was getting the better of
the encounter. But Whisky was th-.
better dog, in regard to weight and
size, and at last it became evident that
he was too much for the intrepid Toddy.
The captain determined to interfere ana
advancing upon the struggling dogs he
planted a well directed kick upon Whis
ky which sent him whimpering to the
other end of the field.
Then did the battle cry of defiance
and revenge ring out from the very soul
of the society matron, and she gave
voice to her indignation, as she alone
co"ld do. ;
But to the surprise of the attendant
throne, the captain did not retreat un
der the fire of her words. Nay, he
retorted, full as strong, and then and
there the society matron met her
match.
The war of words raged fiercely: the
piercing scream of the society matron
was answered by the bursting of the
captain's angry eloquence lashing his
opponent into a fury of splutterings.
The captain steered for the center of
the enemy: he did not change his
course? but met unwavering her diapa
con which only succeeded in maklnr?
him hotter and inspiring him to put up
a gallant fight. , v " : . ; ' *
Captain Dewey finished his run ana
then went off for rest and refreshment.
The cheers at his unprecedented
achievement., though necessarily sub
dued, were heartfelt, for Captain
Dewey, had met and fought the society
matron with her own weapons, and the
victory he had won that day has earned
a place in the annals of California his

Even the hot and vengeful victors were content. They
had taken their men alive. At any time during the long
chase they could have brought them down by a rifle Bhot,
but it would have been unsportsmanslike and have ended
in a free fightâ instead of an example. And. for the matter
of that, their doom was already sealed. Their end by a
rope and a tree, although not sanctioned by law, would
have at least the deliberation of justice. It was tho
tribute paid by the vigilantes to that order which they
themselves had disregarded in the pursuit and cap

and gave a certain dignity to the climax.

wild taunt of his invalid wifeâ the insult of a woman to
a womanâ until his white face grew rigid, and only that
w.-sti-rn-American fetish of the sanctity of sex kept his
twitching fingers from the lock of his rifle. Even her
husband noticed it, and with a half-authoritative "Let
up on that, old gal," and a pat of his freed left nand on
her back, took his last parting. The ringleader, still white
under the lash of the woman's tongue, turned abruptly
to the second captive. "And if you've got anybody to say
'good-by' to. now's your chance."
The man looked up. Nobody stirred or spoke. He was
a stranger thereâ being a chance confederate picked up by
Red Pete, and known to no "iif. Still young, but an out
law from his abandoned boyhood, of which father and
mother were only an ugly forgotten dream, he loved
horses and stole them, fully accepting the frontier penalty
of life for the interference with that animal on which h
man's life so often depended. But he understood the good

loosed by his captors. Then she paused, her shy, fawn
like eyes grew l.old and fixed themselves upon him. She
took the chewing gum from her mouth, wiped her red lips
with the back of her hand, by a sudden lithe spring placed
her foot on his stirrup, and. bounding to the saddle, threw
her arms about his neck and pressed a kiss upon his Tips.
They remained thus for a hushed momentr-the man
on the "threshold of death, the young woman In the full
ness of youth and beautyâ linked together. Then the
crowd laughed; in the audacious effrontery of the girl s
act the ultimate fate of the two men was forgotten.
She slipped languidly to the ground; she was the focus
of all eyesâ she only. The ringleader saw it and his oppor
tunity. He shouted: "Time's upâ forward :"' urged his
horse beside his captives, and the next moment the whole
cavalcade was sweeping over the clearing into the dark
ening woods.
Their destiny was Sawyers Crossing, the head
quarters of the committee, where the council was still
sitting, and where both culprits were to expiate the
offense of which that council had already found them
guilty. They rode in great and breathless haste â a haste
In which, strangely enough, even the captives neemed to
join.
That hast* possibly prevented them from noticing the
singular change which had taken place in the second
captive since t lie episode of the kiss. His high color
remained as if It had burned through his mask of indif
ference. His eyes were quick, alert and keen. Ills mouth

mare. In an instant they were all on their feet again,
but in that supreme moment the second captive had felt
that the cords which bound his arms had slipped to his
wrists. By keeping his elbows to his -sides, and obliging
the others to help him mount, it escaped their notice. By
riding close to his captors, and keeping In the crush of

a few moments they would be on the open ridge, whence
eloped the common turnpike to ''Sawyers," a mile away.
It was the custom of returning cavalcades to take this
hill at headlong speed, with shouts and ones that heralded
their coming. They withheld the latter that day as incon
sistent with their dignity, but, emerging from the wood,
swept silently like an avalanche down the slope. They
were well under way, looking only to their horses, when
the second captive slipped his right arm from the bonds
and succeeded In grasping the reins that lay trailing on
the horse's neck. A sudden "vaquero" jerk, which the
well-trained animal understood, threw nim on his
haunches with his forelegs firmly planted on the slope.
The rest of the cavalcade swept on; the man who was
leading the captive's horse by the riata, thinking only of
another accident, dropped the line to save himself from
being dragged backward from his horse. The captive
wheeled, and the next moment was galloping- up tne slope.
It was the work of a moment. A trained horse and an
experienced hand. The cavalcade had covered nearly
fifty yards before they could pull up; the freed captive
had covered half that distance uphill. The road was so
narrow that only two shots could be tired, and these broke
dust two yards ahead of the fugitive. They had not dared
to fire lowâ the horse was the more valuable animal. The
fugitive knew this in his extremity also, and would have
gladly taken a shot in his own leg to spare that of his
horse.
Five men were detached to recapture or kill him. The
latter seemed inevitable. But he had calculated his
chances; before they could reload he had reached the
woods again: winding in and out between the pillared tree
trunks, he offered no mark. They knew his horse was
superior to their own; at the end of two hours they re
turned, for he had disappeared without track or trail. The
end was briefly told in the Sierra Record:
Red Pete, the notorious horse-thief, who has so
lone eluded justice, was captured and hung by the
Sawyers Crossing vigilantes last week; his confed
erate, unfortunately, escaped on a valuable horse
belonging to Judge Boompointer. The judge had
refused $1000 for the horse only a week before. As
the thief, who is still at large, would find it difficult
to dispose of so valuable an animal without detec
tion, tne chances are against either of mem turning
up again.
*****
Salomy Jane watched the cavalcade until it hart disap
peared. Then she became aware that her brief popularity
had ceased. Mrs. Red Pete, in stormy hysterics, had in
cluded her in a sweeping- denunciation of the whole uni
verse â possibly for simulating an emotion in which she
herself was deficient. The other women hated her for her
momentary exaltation above them; only the children still
admired her as one who had undoubtedly "canoodled"
with a man "a-going to be hung"â a daring flight beyond
their wildest ambition. Salomy Jane accepted the change
with charming unconcern. She put on her yellow nan
keen Bonbonnetâ a hideous affair that would have ruined
any other woman, but which only enhanced the piquancy
of her fresh brunette skinâ tied the strings, letting the
blue-black braids escape below its frilled curtain oehind,
jumped on her mustang with a casual display of agile
ankles in shapely white stockings, whistled to the hound,
and. waving her hand with a "so long, sonny!" to the
lately bereft but admiring nephew, flapped and fluttered
away in her short brown holland gown.
\\*-v father's house was four miles distant. Contrasted
with the cabin *he had just quitted, Jt was a superior
dwelling, with a long "lean-to" at the rear, which brought
the eaves almost to the ground and made It look like a
low triangle. It had a long barn and cattle sheds, for
Madison Clay w.if a "great stock raiser and the owner
of a "quarter section." It had a sitting room and a parlor
organ, whose transportation thither hud been a marvel of
"packing." These things were supposed to give Salomy
Jane an undue importance, but the girl's reserve and inac
cessibility to local advances were rather the result of a
cool, lazy temperament and the preoccupation of a large,
protecting admiration for her fatherâ for some years a
widower. For Mr. Madison Clay's life had been threatened
in one or two feuds â it was said, not without cause â and
It is possible that the pathetic spectacle of her father
doing his visiting with a shotgun may have touched her
closely and somewhat prejudiced her against the neigh
boring masculinity. The thought that cattle, horses and
"quarter section" would one day be hers did not disturb
her calm. As for Mr. Clay, he accepted her as housewifely,
though somewhat "interfering." and, being one of "his
own womankind," therefore not without some degree of
merit.
"Wot's this yer I'm hearln 1 of your doin's over at Red
Pete's? Hnneyfoglln' with a horse-thief, eh?" said Mr.
Clay two days later at breakfast.
"I reckon you heard about the straight thing, then."
said SaKmiy Jane unconcernedly, without InoKing round.
""What do you kalkilate Rube will say to it? What are
you goin' to tell him?" said Mr. Clay sarcastically.
"Rube." or Reuben Waters, was a swain supposed to
be favored particularly, by Mr. Clay. Salomy Jane
looked up.
"I'll tell him that when he's on his way to be hung I'll
toe; When the squad-rons meet, when id fleet to fleet, And_
steel; When the ratt - ling blasts, front* the ar-'mored masts, Are"
aim > &Â° l a blow will fail, on the crumb-ling mail, And the
I front to front_ with Spain; From_ ship tc ship, from i,
hur - line their dead -li - est rain; Let their voices - ces loud, through the
waves that en - gulf the slain, Shall_ sweep the decks of (he
I lip to lip Pass_ on the_ quick re - frain: "Re - mem - ber, \
blind-ing cloud, Cry, cv - er, the fierce re â¢ frain: "Re - mem - berÂ» | Re
blackened wrecks Witn the than-der-ing, dread re - frain. ft Re - mem- ber,)
i mem-ber, re-mem-bes the Maine!"
kiss himâ not till then," said the young lady brightly.
This delightful witticism suited the paternal humor,
and Mr. Clay smiled, but, nevertheless, he frowned a
moment afterward. , . .
"But this yer hoss-thief got awny arter all, and that 8
a hoss of a different color." he said grimly.
Salomy Jane put down her knife and fork. This was
certainly *a new and different phase of the situation. She
had nev'pr thought of it before, and, strangely enough, for
the ftrM time-she became Interested in me man. "Got
away," she repeated. "Did they let him off?'
"Not much," said lier father brieliy. "Slipped his
cords, and going down the grade. pulled up short, just
like a vaquero again' a lassoed bull, almost draggin the
man leadin' him off his hoss, and they Bkrutted up the
grade. For that matter, on that hoss o* Judge Boom
pointer's he mout have drugged the whole posse of em
down on their knees of he liked! Sarved 'em right, too.
Instead of strinjdn' him afore the door or shootin him
on sight, they must allow to take him down afore the
hull committee 'for an example.' 'Example' be blowed !
Ther's example enough when some stranger comes unbe
knownst slap outer a man hanged to a tree and plugged
full of holes. That's an example, and he Knows what it
means. Wot more do ye want? But then those vigilantes
Is allus clltigin' and hangin' onter some mere scrap o tho
law they're pretendin" to despise. It makes me sick! Why.
when Jake Myers shot yer olÂ« Aunt Yineys second hus
band, and I laid in wait for Jake afterward in the Butter
nut hollow, did I tie him to his hops and retch him down
to your Aunt Viney's cabin 'for an example' before I
plugged him? No! (in deep disgust) No! Why, I just
meandered through the woods, careless like, till he comes
out, and I Just rode up to him, and saidâ"
But Falomy Jane had heard her father's story before.
Even one's dearest relatives are apt to become tiresome
in narration. "I know, dad," she interrupted, "but this
yer manâ this hoss-thiefâ did he get clean away without
gettin' hurt at all?"
"He did. and unless he's fool enough to sell the hoss.
he kin keep away, too. So ye Â»cc, ye can't ladle out that
purp stuff about a 'dyln' stranger' to Rube. He won't
swaller it."
"All the same, dad." returned the girt cheerfully, "I
reckon to say itâ and say more; I'll tell him that ef he
manages to get away, too, I'll marry himâ there! But ye
don't ketch Rube takin' any such risks in gettin' ketched,
or in gettin' away arU-r'.'
Madison Clay smiled grimly, pushed back his chair,
rose, dropped a perfunctory kiss on his daughter's hair,
and, taking his shotgun from the corner, departed on a
peaceful Samaritan mission to a cow who had dropped a
calf in the far pasture. Inclined as he waÂ» to Reubens
wooing from his eligibility as to property, he was con
scious that he was sadly deflcien't in certain qualities in
herent in the Clay family. It certainly would be a kind
of mesalliance.
Left to herself, Salomy Jane stared a ions time at the
coffee pot. and then called the two squaws, who assisted
her in her household duties, to clear away the things
while she went up to her own room to make her brd. Here
she was confronted with a possible prospect of that pro
verbial bed she might be making in her willfulness, and on
which she must lie, in the photograph of a somewhat seri
ous young man of retined featuresâ Reuben Water* â
stuck In her window frame-. Salomy Jane smiled over her
last witticism regarding him, and enjoyed it, like your
true humorist, and then, catching sight of her own hand
some face in tho little mirror, smiled again.
But wasn't it ftmny about that horse-thief getting off
after all! Good Lordy! Fancy Reuben hearing that he
was alive and going round with that kiss of hers set on
his lips! She laiiÃlied again, a little more abstractedly.
And he had returned it like a man, holding her tight and
almost brf-athless. and he going to be hanged the next
minute! Salomy Jane had been kissed at other timea, by
force, chance or stratagem, in a certain ingenuous forfeit
game of the locality known as "I'm a-pinrn'," many had
"pined" for a "swe^t kiss" from Salomy Jane, whi>'h she
had yielded in a sense of honor and fair play. She had
never been kissed like this beforeâ she would never again
â and yet the man was alive! And behold, she could see
in the mirror that she was blushing.
She should hardly know him again. A young man with
very bright eyes, a flushed and sunburnt cneek, a kind o(
fixed look in the face, and no beardâ no, none that she
could feel. Yet he was not at all like Reuben â not a bit.
She took Reuben's picture from the window, and laid it
on her workbox. And to think she did not even know thU
young man's name! That was qu^er. To be kissed by a
man whom she might never know! Of course, he knew
hers. She wondered if he remembered it and her. But of
course he was so glad to get off with his lire that he never
thought of anything else. let she did not give more than
four or iive minutes to these speculation*, and, like a
sensible girl, thought of something else. Once again, how
ever, in opening the closet she found the brown holland
gown *he had worn on the day before, thought it very
unbecoming, and regretted that she had not worn her
best gown Â«>n her visit to Red Pete's cottage. On such an
occasion she really might have been more impressive.
When her father came home that night she asked him
the news. No. they had not captured the second horse
thief, who was still at large. Judge Boompointer talked
of invoking the aid of the despised law. It remained, then,
to see whether the horse-thief was fool enough to try to
get rid of the animal. Red Pete's body had been delivered
to his widow. Perhaps it would only toe neighborly for
Salomy Jane to ride over to the funeral. But Salomy Jane
did not take to the suggestion kindly, nor yet did she
explain to her father that, as the other man was still
living, she did not care to undergo a second disciplining at
the widow's hands. Nevertheless, she contrasted her situ
ation with that Of the widow with a new and singular
satisfaction. It might have he-en Red Pete who had
escaped. But he had not the grit of t the nameless one.
She had already settled his heroic quality.
"Ye aint harkenin" to me, Salomy."
Balomy started.
"Here I'm afkin" ye if you've seen tnat hound, Phil
Larrabee, sneaking by yer to-day?"
Salomy Jane had not. But she became interested and
self-reproachful, for she knew that Phil Larrabee was one
of her father's enemies. "He wouldn't dare to go by here
unless he knew you wore out," she said quickly.
"That's what gets me," he said, scratching his grizzled
head. "I've beÂ«n kind Of* thinkin' o' him nil day, and one
of them Chinamen said he saw him at Sawyers t'rossing.
He was a kind of friend o' Pete's wife. That's why I
thought yer""might find out ef he'd been there."
Salomy Jane grew more self-reproachful at her
father'? self-interest in her "nefffhborliness."
"But that ain't all." continued Mr. Clay. "Thar was
tracks over the far pasture that warn't mine. I followed
them, and they went round and round the house two or
three times, ez ef they mout hey bin prowlin'. and then I
lost them in the woods agnin. It's just like that sneekin'
hound Larrabee to hey bin lyin" in wait for me and afraid
to meet a man fair and square in the open."
"You just lie low. dad. for a day or two more, and
let me do a little prowlin . said the gin. with sympa
thetic indignation in her dark eyes, "hf it's that skunk
I'll spot him soon enough and let you know whar he's
hiding"
"You'll just stay where ye are. Salomy," said her
father decisively. "This ain't no woman's workâ tho' I
ain't sayin" you haven't got more head for it than some
men I know.

When the steamer Crescent city ar
rived from Crescent City yesterday Cap
tain Stockfleth reported the sudden death
of one of his passeng. rs. During the run
down the coast everybody aboard was in
the best of spirits and the captain and
P. Deerby, Town. Clerk of Crescent City,
were two of the jolliest of the party.
About midnight Air. Deerby began to feel
sick and complained of pains in the re
gion of his heart. He grew gradually
worse and at 1:60 p. m. died. The body
will be embalmed and sent back to Cres
cent City by the steamer.
Joseph Coffey, known as one of thÂ«
"Horseshoe gang," was arrested by State
Wharfinger R. Stafford and locked up In
the Harbor Police Station on a charge
of petty larceny. Coffey and a com
panion secured an express wagon, and
driving down Clay street wharf, picked up
a wheelbarrow which one of the State's
sweepers was using and putting it in tlia
wagon drove away. W. Morrisey saw
them drive away and followed the pair
as far as Beale street, where they tried
to sell the barrow. Then Morrisey put
in an appearance and the two thieves
ran away. The express wagon was driven
back to the chief wharfinger's office ana
the horse tied up. Half an hour later
Coffey tried to recover the wagon ana
was captured by Stafford. While the
wharfinger was getting ready to take him
to the police station Coffey made a 1-r.;'. k
for liberty. The race up East street that
followed was a most exciting one, and
Coffey very nearly escaped. He ran into
a produce store and hid behind some
boxes, and it was only by an accident
that Stafford found him. In an un
guarded nrmment Coffey stuck his fool out
and the wharfinger spied it. The har
bor police are now looking for the owner
of the express wagon, as it is thought
that it also was stoleij.

He is one of the most popular comman

STANFORD'S SORROW.
A. B. Morgan, President of the Stu-
dent Body, a Confessed Ballot-
StufEer.
Disappointed and conscience stricken,
A. B. Morgan, president of the Stanford
| student body, university debater, and
candidate for treasurer of the Associated
Students, has confessed himself guilty of
having stuffed the ballot in the annual
I election of student body officers, held at
the college on May 5. when he was
presumably chosen to look after the uni
| versity finances for the ensuing year.
Every detail of the crime which has agi
! tated Stanford college circles for a fort
i night has come to light and the shadows
. liavf* been removed from the names of
| several prominent college politicians who
would otherwise have had to suffer from
unjust suspicions.
Since the confession, nothing but the
fraudulent act and the events that led
up to its discovery have been talked of.
Now every one sees how easy it was to
slip the eighty-seven* illegal votes Into
! the box while the count was in progress,
I and afterward fix up the book containing
! the names.
When the ballots wore counted on elec
tion eve and the unprecedented vote of
002 announced, doubts began to arise in
the minds of the defeated candidate's
friends. The polling list was demanded
and a scrutiny begun. It was soon dis
covered that the names of students no
longer in college had been marked off
as voted so that the register would agree
with the ballots in the box. This incrim
inating evidence was made known and a
mass m-eting of students was called.
Here a resolution was passed for a care
ful scrutiny of the proceedings. The mat
ter of appointing a faculty committee was I
left in tht-- hands of Dr. Jordan, who
selected Professors Brauner, Whittler,
Green, Elliott and Durand. After three
days of careful investigation, the commit
tee reported that fraudulent voting had â 
done and recommended a new elec- j
tion for all contested oUlces. This re- :
<:â¢!<-< tion took place on Wednesday last !
and resulted in the repudiation of Morgan.
Ex-Varsity Captain Fickert was the
choice of the student body by a majority
of over 150 votes.
The next day Morgan confessed to his
crime and withdrew from the univer-
sity.
The indignation at college against Mor- ;
pan is tempered with a feeling of sad
ness. He has held the best offices in the *
gift of the students. His previous repu
tatlon has been irreproachable, and his
marked ability is recognized by members
of the faculty and students alike.
There is great belief in college circles
that but one man is responsible for this
stain on university politics. It was feared
at first that a scheme in which several
had their parts had been worked out to
carry the election by fraudulent means.
The manner in which the disgrace *as
been cleared up removes such suspicion.

KNIGHTS OF THE MACCABEES.
At the last held review of San Fran

| the greater number of members, between
a team of the reds and one of the blues,
was decided in favor of the reds, who

i the other team brought in only twenty

loud applause, the losing team joining in
with a will. The penalty, In the shape

ARE SUDDEN DEATHS
ON THE INCREASE?
Continued from Page Twenty-three.
apoplexy two years ago, felt the first
signs while eating his dinner.
"The symptoms for heart disease art
generally a tightening of the breath
and heart and a dizzy, choking feel
ing.
â¢â¢Exercise, less eating and drinking
would reduce the number of apoplectic
cases, that are now certainly on the
I increase."
I Dr. McNutt said: "Both cases of
j apoplexy and of heart disease are cer
tainly very numerous. In apoplexy the
I suddenness of death depends on the
size of the artery that is broken and the
portion of the brain in which it breaks.
Mrs. General Shafter, who was stricken
â  with apoplexy wh.le coming out of the
i Century Club, was brought in here and
â¢ kept alive until word could be sent to
; the Presidio, when they moved her :
home. She lived almost twenty-four
! hours after the stn ke.
"Neuralgia and paralysis of the heart
! and apoplectic stroke? are the most i
j common causes for Budden deaths,,"
Dr. McMurdo does not think apo
plectic strokes are becoming any more
common than in former years. "Apo- :
plectic strokes often occur in people
who have robust constitutions and |
I who take little or no exercise. A de- i
posit of lime forms on the inner coat ,
iof the artery. This hard deposition in
terferes with the elasticity of the ar- !
, teries, they become brittle and at a j
slight' shock break. Apoplexy is most \
' common in people over 50 years. Men i
j are mr.-re subject to it than women. |
;Of course there are exceptions. Cases !
! of children of 10 dying of apoplexy have j
< been recorded. There are certain char- |
' acterlstics which point to the proba- :
! bility of an apoplectic stroke. Stout, I
medium-sized persons with thick necks
! are likely to get them. Heredity is an
important factor.
"The two chief cau^s of apoplexy are |
! the hardening of the arteries and the
abuse of alcohol. People of apoplectic
tendencies are generally seized while. !
performing work of some kind. Pre- j
monitory symptoms are not as com- |
mon as many believe.
"People of violent temper have been !
known to drop dead while in a fit of !
anger. The heart then beats so fast i
that the arteries cannot empty into the '
veins fast enough, and the distension
produces a rupture."
Dr. Beverly Cole: "Ca*es of sudden
death are and have been remarkably
common in California, There are two
reasons for this. One cause is the
electrical conditions of the air; the i
other cause accounts for so many of i
the pioneers going off suddenly. In
the hustle and bustle of the early days j
men lived constantly under a high ten
sion. The nervous strain exhausted ;
them and their hearts became weak, i
They used artificial means to stimulate \
it. but there came a time when the i
stimulant was forgotten and then an
i other case of a 'man found dead in his
bed. 1
"Fatty degeneration of the heart
fatty deposit outside the heart and
apoplexy are all common causes of
sudden deaths."
In the "insectary," or bug-hatchery
in the Government Bureau of Ento
mology at Washington much interest
is centered in the experiments with a
butterfly which grows wild in immense
numbers in the forests of Mexico.
The cocoon is about nine inches long
and is the common house of one to two
hundred crysalids, each in time to be
come a butterfly. This habit of com
bining together to build a cocoon seems
to be peculiar to this one species, which
are found no place but in Mexico.
The cocoon under a powerful magni
fying glass Is seen to be composed of
an infinite number of exquisitely fine
glossy strands of silk, crossing each
other in every direction.
If this silk could be spun, as experts
are trying to do, the "gregarious but
terfly" would quickly displace the silk
worm and transfer the silk industry in
a large measure from the Orient to
America. The cost of silk would be
very greatly lessened for this butterfly
is very hardy and grows wild.
THE ENGLISH GIBBET.
For the present generation t he dread
ed name of "gibbet" holds but small
significance; nevertheless there still ex
ist old folk who can tell blood-curdling
tales of the creaking gibbet and its
gruesome load, and of spots of evil
fame where the restless spirit of un
buried malefactors were wont to walk.
There are still some half-dozen gib
bet posts preserved In their original po
sitions, notably th.' Coombe gallows on
Inkpen Beacon, near Xewberry; the
Caxton gibbet on the North Road, and
Jacob's Post, which stands at the north
end of Ditthling Common. Sussex.
Four and a half miles from Winches
ter is to be seen a quaint old cross, said
to be the remnant of an old gallows,
last used about 1832.
It stands in the middle of a hedge
where four roads meet, at a spot locally
known as "Three Maids."' from the
gruesome legend concerning it that tells
hree girls were "quick buried," or
buried alive to their necks for murder
ing their father by pouring molten lead
into his ear. A kindly wayfarer, so
the story goes, fed one Âf the girls with
an apple, which k^pt her alive three
days longer than her sisters. â London

T F you wish to retain your interest :
I in the drama these days in San
I Francisco you must become a mv- |
I sic lover. This doesn't sound very
sensible, but, like some otherthings
not sensible, it's true. Tragedy's
nose Is out of joint and Comedy's lips
have taken a pitiful downv,ard droop.
They're both jealous of Melody, and
they have good reason to be.
The programmes of five out of the
eight places of amusement in town are
fairly saturated with music. The best
theater in town offers music as its
sole attraction. The best entertain
ment to be had, outside of this, is also
music. Music at the Baldwin; music
the star feature at the Orpheum; mu
slc at the Tivoli, of course; music at
Sherman & Clay's Hall, equally of
course. And at the Californiaâ though
it's a long step from Franz Kneisel to
Dan Polkâ there are still people in the
world who contend that the banjo is
a musical instrument.
Though this is a culminating week
In Melody's honor, it is not a sudden
triumph. Much of the charm of Pilar-
Morin's pantomime was due to the
musical accompaniment. The "Passion
Play" requires Mrs. Morrissey's strong,
sympathetic soprano and the notes of
ihe organ to heighten its artistic ef
fect. And one of the largest and most
enthusiastic crowds of amusement
seekers seen in San Francisco lately
was gathered to testify musical fealty
f to Fritz Scheel last week.
Ysaye, Gerardy, Lachaume, Remen
yl, Marino, the Kneisel quartet and
Scheelâ Melba too a short time since
and the Henschels not so long agoâ
are Music's knights. And Drama?
Who is there to wear her colors In the
amusement tournament? Where's the
theatrical star to rival Ysaye? Who'll
break a lance with Gerardy? Name the
actress at present in San Francisco
with power to move the hearts of men
as Remenyi could when he played as
an artist, not as a sensationalist.
Imagine the delicate, artistic comedy
that would bear the same relation in
the dramatic world that the Kneisels
do in the musical. Imagine it; for, if
your imagination be powerful enough,
that is about all there is for you in
theatricals at present.
Time was when one couldn't hear
good music in San Francisco. To-day
there's more provision made for the
entertainment of. the musical ear than
for the artistic eye or the intelligent
mind. And yet the number of people
who appreciate good music is limited
compared with those who enjoy a fin
ished dramatic performance. For tha
r:rarna appeals to more in us than mu
sic. It is more human, less ethereal;
more intellectual, less emotional.
Now it cannot truthfully be said of
the theatrical manager that the great
aim and philosophy of his life is "the
smallest happiness of the fewest num
ber." Of course, the difference in the
expense of musical and dramatic im
portations is a great factor in deter
mining what we shall enjoy â or go hun
gry. But a point not to be overlooked
is that music has be^n steadily, ten
derly nursed in San Francisco, till an
educated taste has been evolved, upon
which managers might rely. The elite
of musical audiences has been coddled
and petted and coaxed to be pleased,
while the corresponding dramatic audi
ence has been ignored.
The Carr-Beel concert^, the Sym
1 bony concerts and others popularized
music to such a degree that the
fashionable world could take notice of
it. And after that the deluge â a small
one, it is true â of dollars. But we're to
have another season of symphony con
certs next year, and where is there a
corresponding hope In the dramatic
heavens?
To say that there's always room at
the top is no novelty, but an odd thing
about the situation in San Francisco is
that there 1b room only at the top.
Xever was the entertainment of the
great middle class, intellectually and
artistically speaking, so bountifully
provided for. Of course the theatrical
manager who fails to consult the
wishes of the majority may expect the
fate that would meet any business man
so unpractical. But the merchant who
offers for sale only the coarser fabrics
goes to the other extreme, neglects a
source of income and limits his stand
ing in the mercantile world.
Just as people have been found to
make profitable the advent of good
musical attractions, so will patronage
for the better quality of dramatic en
tertainment be forthcoming. If any
theater in town be patient enough and
shrewd enough to make for itself a rep,
utation to gently woo back to dramatic
enjoyment the people who have desert
ed the theaters, because there was
nothing to tempt them there. Tragedy
may yet lift up her head and Comedy
smile again. Our isolated position
makes theatrical re-enforcement from
the East a precarious hope. The stage
should take a lesson from Melody's suc
cess, and patiently, perseveringly build
up as she has done. This is bound to
come. It's the one solution to the the
atrical problem in San Francisco, and
the demand will in time force a supply

DROOP. THEY'RE BOTH JEALOUS OF MELODY, AND THEY'VE GOOD REASON TO BE.
! It may be only of a day, should the
favorable prophecies be unfulfilled. But
! if half of what is claimed for it be true
! San Francisco will welcome this local
composition and learn to be proud of
it. There is no success so gratifying as
a local one; witness "The First Born."
There is no failure so complete as a
home-made one; and every prophet
' whose gift of foretelling has been de
1 nied in his own country bears doleful
testimony to this effect.
"The Poster" is "a satirical musical
1 travesty," written by John P. Wilson,
! who hay furnished the book for all sorts
of Tivoli productions, and L. G. Car
penter dramatic critic on the Post. The
music 'is by Chester S. Packard.
On the worth of the music depends
the Immediate fate of "The Poster."
F<rr judging by the plot, this is not a
beautiful burlesque, nor a farce
comedy with a topical song or two in
terspersed. It's a musical satire on the
craze for posters and the devotees of
poster art. It has a little love story,
but all of the second and third acts
are devoted to the presentation of the
artist's dream of posters rampant.
It is the music that first attracts the
ordinary listener in a comic opera. It
is the sugar coating which disguises
the satirical pill. Later, of course, the
audience becomes aware of the excel
lence or unworth of the satire and
values or condemns it for itself. But,
in the beginning, unless the musical
score be a success, no cleverness of
lines can save it. The godsâ theatrical
gods, of course â approve, and mortals
rejoice at the union of a Gilbert and a
Sullivan. But comic opera, the goal at
which botfo aim. can better spare the
satirist than the musician. The keen
ness of the satirist's wit is often sacri
ficed to the exigencies of musical de
livery. And,, incidentally, unmusical
comedy might benefit by the divorce.
The comic opera that has an inane
libretto and a good score Is only an-
I other example of the lop-sided part
nership we've had to become accus
} tomed to. But the opera that has no
| music in its soul and relies upon the
i librettist Is a farcical musical pyramid
, trying to stand upon its apex.
People will whistle "Cupid, Cupid,
! God of Love." and they'll enjoy "The
j Rainy Day," a topical duet. There's
i "The Bee and the Lightning Bug," too,
! and "Ye Ancient Time"â this the opin-
I ion of one who has watched "The Pos
j ter's" rehearsals â but those who ex-
I pect to see a boisterous farce set to
| music will be disappointed. "Which is
j a consummation devoutly to- be wished,
j for the theater-goer who has expected
> anything else of late has had his share
of disappointment, and every dog, dra
matic and otherwise, is entitled to his
day.
The Baldwin.
The Ysaye engagement at the Bald
win Theater will begin on Tuesday
evening, May 24. He will appear here
on the evenings of May 24, 25, 27 and 2S,
with a matinee on Saturday. Gerardy,
the famous cellist, and Lachaume,
pianist, will also appear.
M. Eugene Ysaye, the distinguished
violinist, was born at Liege, Belgium,
which place is. according to the illus
trious Vleuxtemps,"the cradle of classic
violinists." He is young and has a
striking personality. Of all the famous
violinists who graduated from the con
servatory at Liege, Ysaye is the most
famous. He is the second son of a
family of distinguished musicians, and
received his first lesson from his father,
Nicholas Ysaye, who was also an au
thor and composer. Following this

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 22, 1898.
I came the discipline of ttfe conserva
i tory, where he had as a master Mas
! sart, a member of that renowned fam
ily which did so much for the art, and
I who is yet chief of one of the first
| classes at the Paris Conservatory, not
i withstanding his 75 years. After his
; studies at Liege, which were completed
i in 1874, Ysnye enjoyed for the follow
! ing year private lessons at Brussels
from Wieniawski. Shortly after Vieux
temps heard him in concert. His recep
tion by the audience was so enthusias
tic and the impression made on Vieux
| temps so great that he, in a fit of un
controllable admiration jumped upon
the stage and shouted, "Thou art in
spired," and with tears streaming down
his cheeks he embraced and kissed
i Ysaye, calling him "his son" and "star
| of his school, upon whom the mantle of
greatness had fallen." His triumphs
now came thick and fast, and by the
recommendation of Vieuxtemps Ysaye
was furnished by the Belgian Govern
ment with a liberal purse for his travel
and study In Paris, in which city he
finally completed his course.
By constant association with Vieux
temps he imbibed the manner and
methods of that great genius. Then
Ysaye made a series Of successful
tours thro-ugh Kurope, which were in
terrupted when he received the nomi
nation to the Royal Conservatory of
Brussels. In 1880 at Cologne he played
at the commemorative festival of Men
delssohn, and at Frankfort with
Clara Schumann. In Russia at a grand
festival in honor of Liszt he appeared
before the Russian Imperial Society
under the direction of the great R.ubin
stein, who said he saw In Ysaye "a
master of masters." After these tri
umphs the King of Holland decorated
Ysaye Knight of the Oak Crown. He
then played in Germany from time to
time at the Gewandhaus of Leipzig.
After resting he made a new sensation
at the Conservatory concerts in Paris.
In September, 1886, at the suggestion,
of M. Javaert, he was appointed high
professor at the Royal Conservatory

! at Brussels, where he successfully con-
I tinued the school formerly presided
I over by his two masters, Wieniawski
and Vieuxtemps. The effects of his
close attention to his school are al
ready potent, and to-day the Brus-
I sels Conservatory boldly claims that it
produces as great violinists under the
instruction of Ysaye as the Paris Con
servatory or the School of Joachim.
Since the high honor has been con
ferred upon him at Brussels Ysaye has
played each winter in the symphony
concerts or in the Chamber of Music,
originated by him in the salon of
! twenty, and has given two series of
! auditions consecrated to the new
I school of French music. He has since
been promoted Officer of Public In
i struction by the French Government.

his brother, Theophile, the pianist,
Ysaye played at the Quirinal, and was
I elected Knight of the Oak Crown of

scoring sensational hits at both can
certs.

Morocco's next attraction will be the
engagement of W. J. Elleford and Jes-
Fie Norton, in their play, "Mrs. Par
tington and Her Son Ike," a roaring
farce comedy drama of New England
life. The Ellefords are well known in
this city and all over the coast, having
played the interior towns with their
own company for several years. An
other addition to the cast will be James
(forrigan, a member of the Elleford
company and clever character come
dian. The drama is in four acts, intro
ducing humorous types of Yankee
home life, with the resultant funny
situations produced by the tricks <>f
the widow's son Ike. This character
will be enacted by Miss Norton, who
is a clever and vivacious soubrette.
Mr. Elleford plays the garrulous Mrs.
Partington. Clever specialties by the

We've been the Roman army and we've
been the Paris mob.
We've marched with Dave Belasco s
boys in blue.
We've fought in Shenandoah, and we ye
often had the job
Of assisting in the Taming of the Shrew.
We're battled-battered veterans of every
blessed age â
We can stand before a stage director's
"Damn" â
But we've made our last appearance and.
we're going to engage
For a season on the road with Uncle
Sam.
We've rushed across from R to L. pur
suing empty air.
We've done some noble slaughter in the
wings.
We've fired a thousand volleys on a foe
that wasn't there.
And it seems to us we're fit for better
things.
We want to feel the fever of a realistic
Â» fight,
And we want to storm a fort that ain't
a sham;
We're sick of being soldiers, at a half a
plunk per night.
So we're going on the road with Uncle
Sam.
And it isn't for the glory, and It Isn't tor
the pay â
For none of us expects to be a star-
But it's just the human longing for the
madness of the fray.
It's the wanting to be really what wo
are.
So we've quit the Roman army, and we've
laid the props aside.
And the stage-door shuts behind ua
with a slam,
And we ain't afraid of dyingâ for we've
very often died â
And we'll gladly die again for Uncle
Sam.

M*rs. Lease's speech at Washington. If
the reader is not thrilled by the throb

FIGHTING STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN AND SPANISH NAVIES.
The accompanying: tables of the navies of the United States and Spain include â so far as relates to our nayy â only such as are c fective war vessels. In the Spanish navy list, while it apparently shows great numerical
strength, many of the smaller craft are of questionable utility, and this refers especially to the torpedo boats. The auxiliary navy list is correct up to the latest available data. The sum of $8,000,000 has
been expended in the purchase of these vessels and more are daily added, making it impossible in the absence of official data to give the actual strength of this part of the present navy.
Where no names of commanding officers are found opposite the respective vessles, the vessel has not yet been placed in commission and is still undergoing alterations or receiving outfit at the navy-yard.

The outlook for the summer girl of 189?
Is gloomy. An exodus of men has begun.
The sola fields of the Klondike are at
tracting the adventurous and the hardy,
They go for the sake of gold. The south
eastern coast of the United States is
swarming with soldiers who are eager tc
get into Cuba. The aummer girl is lefi
alone. It seems likely that she will en
joy her ribbons and laces and prettj
draperies in solitude this year.â St. Louif

put forth that commonplace, tiresome lit
tle diary of hers. Hut Hawaii's ex -queen,
though she devotes time and paper in
abundance to the little frivolous details
of women's lives â whether they be queens
or hula dancers; though she takes a naive
delight in describing her gold and white
brocaded gown that came from Paris,
when Kalakaua, her brother, was
crowned; though she lacks a sense of pro
portion in lustingruishing the important
from the unimportant, has written a dig-
I, interesting, valuable book.
Read this story of Liliuokalani'B, with
your memory reproducing, in all its rain
bow-like loveliness, that "Hawaii, a
warm, tropic Isle, which blossom' d and
baek'd in the sun's constant smile."
Every place that is mentioned will be
vivid with tropical lite, from beautiful
Wa'kiki to Kauaiâ that deep-tinted, fairy
like paradise of the Pacific, with its silver
waterfalls falling into the deep blue of
the ocean; with its majestic, lava
crowned mountains covered with the ten
flerest green; with !ts warm, green, trans
parent bays; its white beaches; Its palms;
its forests and its dark-skinned, sweet
voiced, simple-hearted people.
There never was a more beauti\il set
ting for a picture. There never wa* a sad
der story than this of the extinction of
an old race.
The genealogies in the back of Llliua
kalani's book are pathetically significant.
It's the tragedy of the death of a people,
of the passing of a nation that makes this
story of the last of the Hawaiian queens
a matter of historic as well as poetic in
terest.
"Immediately after my birth," she
writes, "I was wrapped In the finest soft
tapa cloth and taken to the house of Ko
nla, a granddaughter of Kamehameha I.
by whom I was adopted. * * * This was
and, indeed. Is in accordance witli Ha
waiian customs. * * * This alliance by
adoption cemented the ties of friendship
between the chiefs."

waii's throne.
"When I recall the instances in which

HAWAII`S STORY
igniting fire from the friction of sticks)
we could cook and consume without the
knowledge, of our preceptors."
Isn't it an odd mixture of civilization
and barbarism? But that's just the very
charm of Hawaii, with its telephones and
its hulas, its street cars and its
naked, amphibious sun-burned boy divers,
its Woman's Exchange and its gardens of
tropical palms and trees Laden with gor
geous flowers, its electric lights and its
Queen, who at a dinner given by Presi
dent Cleveland, Liluokaiani says, wore
the national holoku, a mother hubbard
of "white silk brocade artistically em
broidered with heavy raised and richly
worked designs."
The girlhood of a young Hawaiian Prin
cess must have been an idyllic period in
the time of Kamehameha IV.
At Hilo, in 1859, the widowed exile
writes, "we were joined by the King and
his party, and having many agreeable
acquaintances among the naval Officers,
the time sped quickly in social pleasures.
We lived in a large grass house, one side
of which was occupied by the ladies and
the other by the gentlemen, while the cen
ter was a room used for a banquet i.all
or ballroom. When any of the royal party
had occasion to go from one place to an
other. We were drawn in carriages of na
tive construction, the people themselves
furnishing the power usually supplied by
horse. Sometimes we were stuck in a
mud hole or water course, from which the
most determined efforts of our devoted
followers could not extricate us; and it
was then necessary to have a horse led
to the side of the vehicle to take us off
on horseback. But we were light hearted,
merry and happy; the naval officers were
perfect gentlemen and guilant in their at
tentions."
This was Liliuokalani's life at 21.
The book is full of accounts of these
fetes and progressions. When I,iliuoka
lanl was proclaimed heir-apparent she
toured the islands, and the names of the
first four people who entertained the
royal party are an odd evidence of trie
queer mixture of peoples the Sandwich
Islands have taken in. First there was
Ah Kau. a very wealthy Chinese, a culti
vator of rice, and then Judge Pii. and
then Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Boy a, and then
Mrs. James Campbell, a handsome Ha
waiian married to a wealthy Scot. Hut
all these halcyon journoyings and festiv
vals were not, LUiuokalanl insists, evi
dences of extravagance. She believes
with Napoleon, that "it is wise and patri
otic to spend money to awaken in the
people a national pride."
Kamehameha IV. says the writer, had
"all the characteristics of his race; and
the strong, passionate nature of the
Kamehamehas is shown In his benevo
lent as in his less commendable acts."
This is the King who in a fit of passion
phot and killed his private secretary, H.
A. Neilson. "No legal notice of tho
event was in any way taken," says the
author. "No person would have been
foolhardy enough to propose it. l"p to
thirty years ago the right of life and
deatli was unchallenged.
It is a great step from an absolute
despotism, paternal though as an easy
jroing, tropic despotism must be, to a re
public in less than a third of a century.
This temper of the Kamehamehas "in
cidentally led to the seating of the pres
ent dynasty on Hawaii's throne. "When
the young Prince was about 4 years old
he became dissatisfied with a pair of
boots and burst into an ungovernable
fit of passion. His father sought to cool
him off by putting the boy under an
open faucet of cold, running water. The
little one appeared to be unharmed,
but later in the day broke down with
nervous weeping and could not be com
forted. Then it was discovered that the
cold douche and shock had brought on
an attack of brain fever. From tin's he
did not recover, but died on the 27th of
August. 1-
Liliuokalani, by her own account, must
have had a strong, vigorous will. In fact
it is to tfiat very determined trait of

Last Thursday evening Court Southern
Heights gave a smoker In the ; Potrero
Opera House and the attendance of mem
bers and visitors was large. Stirring ad
dresses were delivered by G. A. McElf resh
H. C.R., and Charles S. Peery. H. V. c'
R. Among other things the high chief
ranger stated that the laws of the order
will not in any way Jeopardize the' good
standing of the members who may-enter
the service of the United States for the
war, and that the * magnificent reserve
fund is available to pay death claims to
the widows and orphans of those who may
die In the defense of Old Glory. He also '
stated that he had ' received a dispatch
from Supreme Chief Ranker : Dr. Oron
hyatekha stating that members employed
by the Government who : may be ordered
to ; the Philippine ; Islands will not be â¢ re
ought to be sole regent. * â¢ If there
was a council of regency there would be
no need for any regent.
Which Is sound sense and well ex
pressed.
All dwelling on petty details vanishes
when the ex-Queen begins to discuss the
political situation in Hawaii. "Pious ad
venturers." she calls the missionaries,
"whose purpose was to . minimize or en
tirely subvert other interest and espe
cially the prerogatives of the crown. * "
Although settled among us and drawing
their wealth from our resources, they
were alien to us in their customs and
ideas respecting ge^ernme-n-*-,- and- desired
above all things the extension of their
power and to carry out their own special
plans of advancement, and to secure their
own persona] benefits. It may be true
that they really believed us unfit to be
quired to obtain a permit nor be required
tv pay any increase of rut by reason of
going there. The court will keep in good
standing all of its members who may go
|to the war. The speaking was followed
by an excellent programme, in which the |
following named took part: Thomas!
Nowlan, Professor Edmondson, Mr. Footc, j
Messrs. Loepfer, Hernandez, Chapman, j
Gretland, Reed, Kelly, Hlnton, Hines and
Brown took part. A very enjoyable even- i
ing was spent.
The hlfrh chief ranger, who is in this :
; city for a few days, will pay a visit to the
i local courts.
It Is probable that he will be present at

I coner, president of the Pasl Chiefs' As

of the evening. Letters of regret were
read from Messrs. GOldarecena, G. W.

spent, and the most noticeable thing was |
the great harmony that prevailed and the i
joy at the assurance that order is now I

At the election held on Tuesday It was
Mrs. Futherir of Sacramento who was
elected grand outside guard and Mrs.

IMPROVED ORDER OF RED MEN.
The members of this order In this city j
are very enthusiastic in regard to the
parade to take place on the Fourth of
July.
The official visit of the great sachem
and great chiefs to the wigwam of Al- J
thomas Tribe in Franklin Hall last week I
was a very enjoyable affair. There was i
a large number of Red Men present, and
during the evening they were interested j

from a Christian nation, who have erect
ed monuments, universities and legisla
tive halls by that method." And the third
cause of her dethronement, the licensing
of opium, she justifies in this way: "The
British Government has long since adopt
ed license instead of prohibition â¢ â¢ â¢
yet I have still to learn that there has
been any proposition on the part of the
pious peoDle of London to dethrone her
Majesty Queen Victoria for issuing such
licenses."
The book is a dignified exposition of tha
royalist side of Hawaiian affairs. Liliuo
kalani does not whine nor scold. She
scornfully alludes to the "little comedy
for precedence" when the pretensions of
the wives of the Ministers â "those quasi-
Americans, who call themselves Hawaii
an s now and Americans when It suits
them"â clashed: and remarks that "the
passion for dignity and place is not con
lined to courts of royalty or to those who
sustain them." She reiterates her right
to the crown lands of Hawaii. "They are
by legislative act and the rulings of the
Supreme Court my own property at this
day."
The chapter in which the author de
scribes the royal brother and sisters com
peting for musical renown, their musical
clubs and the poetry they composed â
which, as In patriarchal times, was
passed along, unwritten, till Liliuokalanl
herself wrote, the pathetic "Aloha Oe,"
which every Hawaiian sings, and which
haunts the memory of all foreigners who
have heard itâ reminds one of the Idyllic
days at Trianon, when Louis and Mane
Antoinette played at being milliners; or
of the golden days of the court of Louis
XIV, when royalty made madrigals and
sonnets and was author or actor, and
never dreamed of the deluge to follow.
The book closes with an appeal to the
American people.
"Oh, honest Americans, as Chris
tians, hear me for mjf downtrodden
people. Their form of government
is as dear to them as yours is
precious to you. Quite as warmly
as you love your country, so they

THE WOMAN'S WHIST CONGRESS. j
THE second congress of the Woman's
Whist League has passed into history. In j
point of numbers it was a grand success, !
and sreat credit is due to Mrs. T. H. j
Andrews, president of the league, who did
all In her power to make the affair memorable
in the history of whist. The attendance was
between five r.nd six hundred, and nearly
every State in the Union was represented.
It was given out that during the tournament
the contests and scoring would be conducted
on the plan adopted by the American Whist
League for the Put-in-Bay Congress, which
proved such a grand success, but fur some un
accountable reason it was abandoned at the
last moment in most of the matches, and the
result was Just what might have been ex
pected, and to read the comments In the dif
ferent papers it must have bÂ«en the worst
jumbled-up mess of whist potpourri that ever
took place In this country, and the prediction
made in Brooklyn last winter by the then
president of the Woman's League that the
women would show the men how to run whist
congresses was not strictly carried out.
If those in authority in this league had taken
the good advice offered them by the whist
editor of the New York Pont the result of the
whist play at the congress would have been
a grand success instead of a flat failure, with
tW.> .-â N.'.'i tIOOS.
The play for the Toledo and.Brooklyn trophies
wont off without a hitch. When the former
way presented to the league Mrs. Clarence
Brown, first vice-president-elect of the U-a.gue
and j. resident of the Ladies 1 Club uf Toledo,
Ohio, who gave the trophy, used good foresight
and excellent judgment in stipulating how the
play should be conducted, an.l she was there
in person to see it was carried out. The ex
ecutive ability of Mrs. Brown as first vice
president of the league will be a sufficient
jjirirar.tee that the whist contests at all future
meetings of this league, while she is one of the
heads of the institution, will be conducted on
an entirely different plan.
R. F. Fester, the whist editor of the New
York Sun, is off on a good many things he
writes, according to our way of thinking but
he knows how a whist tournament should be
conducted.
In the Sun of May S he gives a lot of good
advice, and after the harsh edges are worn
off It should be digested carefully by those
in the league who do the thinking two or
three years in advance â and profit by it.
HONORS TO MRS. GEORGE E. BATES.
Mrs. O. D. Thompson, secretary of the Wo
man's Whist League, has Just officially notified
Mrs. George E. Batesâwife of ex-President
Bates of the San Francisco Whist Clubâ of her
election to the board of governors of the Wo
m.in'r* League, nt thnir second annual congress
recently held in Philadelphia,
In the selection of this little lady to fill this
very important and honorable position, no bet
ter choice could be made. Mrs. Bates Is a na
tlvÂ° daughter of California, and was born at
Sacramento. Her father, Judge H. O. Beatty,
was a member of the first Supreme Court of
the State of Ne\ ada, and her brother. Judge W.
H. Beatty. is present Chief Justice of the Su
preme Court of this State. It is said a Judicial
mind is necessary to be a good whist player,
and if this be true. Mrs. Bates comes naturally
by her whist perception.
'When the San Francisco Whist Club was
formed in 1892 Mrs. Bates became a charter
member, and has continuously remained one of
its most influential and earnest supporters.
Mrs. Bates is almost a duplicate or "double 1 ' of
Miss Kate Wheeloek, the "Whist Queen," in
:â .!?.Â«-. looks, action and disposition, ami is one or
the best lady whist players in the State. When
Mr. Milton C. Work, author of "Whist of To-
Day," was in the c\ty a few weeks ago, he
played one whole evening with Mrs. Bates, and
he told the writer that she was one of the best
luÂ«ly whist plajren he ever sat down with.
The Woman's Whist League has every reason
to feel proud of their California representative,
Mrs. George E- Bates.
The balance of the officers elected are as fol
lows: President, Mrs. Joseph R. Hawley,
Washington. P. C. ; first vice-president, Mrs.
Clarence Brown. Toledo, O. : second vice-presi
dent. Mrs. Waldo Adorns. Boston, Mass. ; treas

WHIST AND WAR
When four are gathered together and have
sorted the suits, and the north has led, shall
wars and rumors of war disturb them?
Not much.
â \Vhtin second hand signals, shall news or
Shakespeare the fame of having been
himself. To a certain small proportion of
the readers and thinkers of trie world
there will always be doubt as to the iden
tification of Will Shakespeare, actor, with
the master poet of all the ages. But to
the world at large the matter is not of
the smallest consequence. Books may be
written on the Baconian theory and argu
ments may be heaped till they hide the
theory they "were made to render plain,"
but the name of Shakespeare will be in
alienably associated with svnat we have
learned to love and admire as Shakes
peare's, and if Injustice be done thereby to
the one marvelous mind which has more
richly endowed the world than all others
that preceded or followed it, why the in
justice is merely superficial, after all.
What matters It to Shakespeare now,
whether he be worshiped as Shakespeare,
or Bacon or Marlowe?
Wilbur Gleason Zeigler believes that
Shakespeare is neither himself nor Bacon.
He believes that he is Marlowe. And to
bring about the conversion of others, he
writes this book. "It Was Marlowe."
Despite the parallel evidences of simi
larity in the dramas of Marlowe and
Shakespeare, "the tendency of each to de
generate into pomposity and bombast in
passages of tragic pathos." according to
Mr. Zeigler. "the similar treatment of
characters and the like spirit that per
vades them," the theory which dethrones
Shakespeare and elevates Marlowe will
not readily be accepted. The burial regis
ter which records the death of "Kynd Kit
Marine" in 1593 must be taken as evidenec
of the departure from this world at the
age of tweny-nine of the man who Swin
burne says might have rivaled Shake
speare had he lived. For the rest, Mar
lowe and Shakespeare were both satu
rated with the spirit of the time in which
they lived, and tho puzzle of reconciling
what we know of Shakespeare's life with
the picture of Shakespeare's universal
mind the world worships in his plays is
not solved by supposing the after-exist
ence of the author of "Tamburlaine."
In its second purpose, thoughâ to in
crease the "reader's interest in a being a3
grandly illumined with the flame of pure
intellect as any who have, since his conse
cration, knelt at tho shrine of ideal beau
ty or aspired to ideal power"â "lt Was
Marlow" cannot fail. It's a good or
rather there's the plot for a good story
in it. But the author's proselytizing
spirit has marred the artistic value" of the
book. Ho preaches instead of entertain
ing. He reiterates the statement of proofg
instead of allowing the reader to deduce
his own conclusinons. He permits him
se!f tho luxury of a confusion of pro
nouns of tho second person. His heroine
is only a iisrure. and notwithstanding his
own great interest in Marlowe his pen is
not strong enough to recreate "the muse's
darling" and bH him step nut from the
musty past of old-style lettering and sev
tntoenth-century oblivion into the life
and light of one's book-loves'.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath it, if any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure ; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In thÂ«> Interior and low
along the const, and the isobars extend north
and ?outh along the coa=t, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite remit.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 21- Dealings were not
large nor important on the Stock Exchange to
day. Operators almost without exception,
maintain their attitude of waiting for the
situation in West Indian waters to clear Itself.
The rpport that the Spanish fleet had gone into
Santiago and had succeded In getting away
again was not generally credited, coming as
it did from Spanish sources. But It exercised
some depressing effect nevertheless. It was
probably the cause of the decline In prices after
the rise. The ripe in Spanish fours in London
and Paris showed it was not without its effpr-t
also in foreign markets. There was selling for
London which kept up a depressed tone in some
of the internationals, New York Cnral and
Louisville being conspicuous sufferers. Rock
Island also showed the absence of inside sup
port, but waÂ» bid up quickly on the final rules
to a level above last night's close. The rally
in the market was due to the strong bank
statement. Prices rose a fraction above last
night's close, and in some cases a point or
more.
'A feature of the trading again was the iso
lated movement of obscure and dormant stocks.
Pullman and Great Northern preferred, each
with a handsome surplus to be some time di
vided amone stockholders, moved upward.
Wheeling and Lake Erie' and Rio Grande
Western stocks were quite conspicuously active
and all movod strongly upward. Tobacco,
Sugar and Leather preferred among the in
dustrials were all in demand. The closing was
strong at the top prices.
The stock market has not moved widely dur
ing the week and it has become evident that
operators regard the present level of prices
as favoring a fair equilibrium between the
conflicting factors in the outlook. On the one
side is the chance of a naval reverse. This Is
considered remote.
But it must be conceded that In Wail street
more weight attaches to this possibilty than
was the case a week ago.
As i* is prices are substantially higher, the
grangers naturally leading owing to the ex
traordinary movement oX fraia. xnere were
' numerous Indications of a strong Industrial
i and financial outlook which are coming to have
I more and more influence in spite of the ln~
! cubus of the war.
Railroad earnings shew striking Increases
I not only over last year, but over previous
years, and in some cases all records are broken
; for this season of the year. There is an in
crease also In thf> bank clearings of the coun
i try. The wholly unprecedented condition of our
i foreign trade balance has also received re
i newed attention, the more so as the heavy ex
j cess of exports over imports still continues
I now, which is the season when the balance
generally turns against us. With a favorable
; trade balance of $314,000,000 for ten months of
i the fiscal year, against the best previous
' record of less than $300,000,000 for a full year,
, there is no room left for timid apprehension
i alwut the country's future money resources.
' Increased activity early in the week in the
bond market resulted from large releases of
money seeking employment. The demand was,
however, largely confined to the more specu
i lative Issues. Prices are quite generally higher
1 and held steady, even through the reactions
which occurred in the stock market.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 21â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were idle to-day, but firm. Span
ish fours have risen one point.
Argentines were good and Kaffirs were bet
ter.
Americans were lifeless.
Grand Trunks were strong.
Brazils have risen sharply here. I learn from
an undoubted source that the Brazilian Presi
dent-elect is In this country and is negotiating
with the Rothschilds a scheme for reconstruc
tion of Brazilian finances. 1 have reason to
believe this scheme provides for a funding loan
based on customs coupons on the existing debt,
to be paid in bonds for three years, similar to
the method employed by Argentine. These
plans when known are likely to cause a sharp
rise in Brazilian exchange.

ASSOCIATED BANK STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, May 21.â The Financier says
1 this week: In the face of the showing made
by the New York banks for the week ending
j May 21 It is difficult to see how the money
i market is to be sustained wnen on the present
lower level for any length of time, with banks
. now holdipg an excess reserve of $50, 71.", 250.
'. the highest reported in fourteen months, and
the total cash In bank has rarely exceeded the
present volume. The circumstances which have
brought about the remarkable changes in the
statement are not difficult to understand. The
steady demand for interior remittances has
given way to a decided movement to this cen
ter. The shipment to the interior has not
equaled gold imports for some time.
Added to this, the Treasury is disbursing
. large sums oi money and until two Weeks agOi
I high rates forced a constant liquidation of
: loans and sales of accumulated sterling bills.
; The result has been to throw a mass of idle
i money into the bank?. Fortunately the situa
j tion b,as so much improved that the banks are
! finding use for part of this money and the ex
j pansion of $7.557,500 in loans for the week Is a
; cheering sign. What proportion of this In
crease represents mercantile demands cannot
he estimated but it Is true that some very
| active buying of sterling bills is again being
indulged in.
The expansion of averages for the week can
be traced to several large banks, notably those
1 which are concerned in international move
| ment, but on the other hand the institutions
i making a specialty of country accounts report
1 Increased deposits, showing the return to be
! from the interior. Under normal circum
] stances a movement in favor of New York is
: only natural in this season and now that the
â  proposed Government bond issue has been de
layed New York will probably continue to gain
heavily.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
3 I CHICAGO, May 21.â The Wheat speculators
8 | to-day appeared disposed to leave the ' entire
* i market here to Its chief manipulator and busi
3 ! ness was very small except for about forty
, j minutes after the opening and again during
1 ! the last hour of the session. September, ab
; ! sorbed the bulk of the trading. Liverpool
f worked the Improvement here by cabling ad
, vances of from l%d to 2' 2 d and it was gen
- I erally believed on the floor that Letter worked
r I Liverpool. The excessive rains of the last few
3 days had raised some misgivings about the
â  possible effect on the Wheat crop, especially, in
i sections where the plant is approaching ma
l I turity. Continental markets were quoted easier,
I Antwerp being the equivalent of l%c a bushel
i and Paris lower by 1 cent a bushel for /hay
| and %c for September. Leiter was evidently
neglecting to support the Continental markets,
but he was attending closely to those at home.
His brokers bid from $1 40 to $1 45 for June
j and from $1 50 to $1 60 for May and incidentally
! whipped up September when It needed an ap
1 j plication of the gad. July Wheat closed with |
'â â  a gain of 2%c and September Is 1%@1%c high
er. May ranged from $1 47 to Sf 1 60, the latter
] figure being the closing price, a gain of 15
: I cents for the day.
I Corn acted to-day as It did yesterday. In
i clined to bull, but not able to advance very
. far. July closed %c lower on realizing.
Oats were entirely neglected. The close was
unchanged from yesterday.
Provisions were barely steady without much
i activity, as if the liquidation had been pretty
I thorough. Pork and Ribs gained 7% and

Receipts of outside Hay are steadily dwind

not bring what it â  would if It were properly
cured. .Reports from the Sacramento Valley,
wmch was depended upon for a good daal of
Hay this season, are that the stand will be al
lowed to go for grain, owing to the moist
weather of the past week.

THE THREE FOUNTAINS.
THE Lob-Lolly poked Sinbadinthe
ribs and Sinbad laughedâ laughed
so that his spectacles fell from his
nose upon the Market street pave
ment and broke both lenses out.
But that did not seem to make any dif
ference with Sinbad's sight. Katy and
Charlie picked up the pieces of lens and
looked through them and found that
they did not magnify one bit. But that
is neither here nor there, except that
it shows that Sinbad only pretended
that his eyes were poor.
"V-e-r-y well," said Sinbad, when he
was through laughing; "that will do
very well. And the children? Well,
they will think it out of sight."
The Lob- Lolly led the way and I and
Sinbad and the children â Charlie and
Katyâ followed. When we came to
Lotta's fountain Sinbad said that he
was thirsty, and he was about to go
over for a drink when the Lob-Lolly
said that he knew a trick worth two of
that. He would call the fountain over.
So he did. and the fountain actually
came to us.
It hoisted Itself slowly and painfully
from its pedestal and clumped heavily
over the paving stones, and its drink
ing cups clinked against its sides as it
wobbled.
"It is a landlubber," said the Lob-
Lolly, "and it hasn't got its sea legs on
yet."
"Dash my tarry topllghts!" answered
Sinbad. "I have lived two thousand
years in Bagdad and I never have seen
anything like that."
"Bagdad is slow," remarked the Lob-
Lolly. "You have to come to San
Francisco to learn; but you'll do, after
a while. Bah! What is this? Plain
water? I would not call a fountain off
Its base for that! Ho, there! Soda
water, if you please, and nothing less
for my young friends."
How the fountain gurgled!
Sodawater it*was! There was a hiss
ing sound within the fountain like
steam, and directly there leaped from
every side of it the best ice-cold soda
water I have ever tasted. Where the
lettering is on the fountain telling how
Lotta gave it to a thirsty city there
started Into view labels mentionlngthat
vanilla and lemon, chocolate and rose,
catnip and cauliflower, orgeat and
pineapple, strawberry and banana,
onion and mince pie, and I don't know
how many more syrups, were to be
had there.
Ta, ta, ta ra! Ta, ra tan tivy! Did
you ever hear the tune the pied-piper of
Hameline played? Not more children
followed him than there now came
forth when the Lob-Lolly, making a
trumpet of his hands, signaled them to
leave candy stores and doll shops and
toy counters, and come to him.
"Children," said the Lob-Lolly, put
STARTLING EFFECT UPON THE BUMPKINS AND THE GRANGER OF A NIGHT ALARM OF A SPANISH SPY IN CAMP HARD TACK.
ting his sailor hat upon one side of his
head and looking very comical, "last
week I gave the bo>*s of San Francisco
â an even 500 of them â a great swing.
To-day is for the girls, and they are
going to have all the icecream soda
they can drink. . Step up, little girls,
and say what you will have."
"What a mob of little girls, with Katy
this time in the front rank! There were
dozens and scores and hundreds, and
they all shouted out the name of the
flavor they liked, and all wanted to be
helped first. For the first time the Lob-
Lolly looked unhappy.
"There will not be enough to go
around."
He covered his face with his hands as
if ashamed.
The Lotta fountain saw the trouble.
Bless its heart of iron! There must be
a soft place In it after all. Clump,
clump, clump! Out Market street it
traveled until it came opposite the Na
tive Sons' monument. The fountains
bowed and bowed and drew nearer
We could see then that the Native
Sons' monument was also full of soda
water, and, luckily, had a full assort
ment of syrups.
How the little girls chattered and
laughed and drank icecream soda out
of the drinking cups, until they were
satisfied and happy; and they gave
their dollies a-plenty also.
But the boys got never a drop!
'Huh! " ejaculated Charlie; 'come on,
boys. I know where there is another
fountain on Market street. Let's go
down there and perhaps we will have
some luck."
Five thousand wild young Arabs tore
down Market street, yelling, to where
the Cogswell fountain had stood so
long.
Charlie was the master of ceremonies,
and he was a great success in that ca
pacity. The fountain fizzed, and from
It came soda of all flavors, and all the
boys had their treat, and they rollicked
and jibed at the girls.
Down came the Lob-Lolly and Sin
bad.
"Good boys," said Lob-Lolly. "Do
you like medicine?"
"Yes, yes," said Sinbad. "Do you
really Jike castor ile?"
A fearful suspicion came to each and
every boy, which rapidly ripened into
a sickening certainty. They had been
fooled, one and all, and had drunk a
large quantity of that oil which chil
dren dislike more than anything on
carth â the New England dose of brim
stone and molasses not excepted! In
stantly they all rushed for the water
front "and grazed upon the sea for
awhile painfully.
"My watch needs winding," said the
Lob-Lolly. "I think I will use Uncle
Collis' turntable to fix it!"
The queer Lob-Lolly â while Sinbad
chuckled at his clevernessâ drew forth
a fine wire, one end of which he fast
ened to the turntable upon which the
cable-cars revolve. The other end he
fastened to the key of his old watch.
One revolution of the turntable turned
the key many times, completely wound
up the Lob-Lolly's watch and Sinbad's
and stirred up a milk-shake machine.
The Lob-Lolly drank milk-shake, and,
when he was not drawing in his
breath, whistled shrilly through his
teeth. D. H. W.
THE LOST CHILD.
BY JULIETTE DRISCOLL
SAN FRANCISCO.
THE following notice appeared in
every morning paper in the town
of X, and the people of the town
were very much excited over the
announcement, which read thus:
"A large reward offered for the re
covery of a child, aged 5, has fair hair
and blue eyes. Anyone knowing the
whereabouts of the child will please re
port to station C."
Yes, It was true, pretty little Ruby
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 22. 1898.
Gray had been either stolen or lost; but
it was supposed by the majority of the
people that she had been stolen, as no
one had seen her and she had been
missing two days. Her father was one
of the principal business men of the
town and he kept a large tin store.
The father and mother were nearly
frantic with grief, as no trace of the
missing child had been found. Time
went on until a whole year had passed
and still no trace had been found. Mr.
and Mrs. Gray have changed com
pletely and both are careworn and sad.
No wonder, for this was their only
child, beloved not only by them but by
everybody who had the pleasure to
know her.
During all this time the above notice
appeared every day in all the papers.
At last the father had an idea that if
he would disguise himself as a man
with tins' to mend and go through the
surrounding towns he would perhaps
find his child. So he went and into
every small town, traveling day after
day, but It seemed of no avail and he
began to think that his search was
fruitless.
One day he happened to go to some
little far away town. He had almost
given up all hope and this seemed to
be the only town he had not visited.
He went around all the morning until
he came to an old cottage where an old
beggar woman lived. He knocked at
the door and waited a while, but no
body came.
At last he heard somebody coming
up a path which led to the house. He
turned, thinking it was some women,
when, to his surprise and joy, he saw
his own child. He knew her, although
she was dressed in rag's and differed
much from the bright happy child c-f
fifteen months ago.
At first she did not recognize her
father in his disguise, but as soon as
she heard his voice she uttered a cry
of delight and rushed into his arms.
They were then interrupted by the ap
pearance of an old woman, who came
to see whom "her child," as sh. termed
her, was talking to. As soon as she
saw Mr. Gray she knew it roust be the
child's father and she confessed her
guilt, saying she had stolen the child
one day while she was walking in the
woods, because she wanted hei to siny
while she begged, as she made much
more in that way than she would
otherwise.
The old woman asked for mercy and
Mr. Gray was so happy at the recovery
of his child that he almost forgot all
about the old woman and said "yes,"
for he was thinking of the good news
he would carry home to his wife â not
only news, but his child.

â 
IT was a cold, stormy night. We sat
close by a blazing fire trying to
drive away the homesick feeling
which would creep into our hearts.
My maiden grandaunt, Sister Kate
and myself were on a short visit to my
uncle and his wife in San Francisco,
but they were necessarily called
away for the evening, so we were left
to the tender mercies of our own
thoughts and society.
We were aroused by the ringing of
the bell and I reluctantly left my com
fortable seat to answer it. Aunt Ho
nora and Kate stood a little way back
in the hallway in view of the door, to
come to- my rescue in case some des
perate character should make his en
trance, knowing the absence of the
male element of the household. All
things were possible in a large city,
and besides, we had heard that large
numbers of tramps visited San Fran
cisco during the winter months.
"Please, Miss," said a very humble
voice, which brought Uriah Heep to
my mind, "kin yer do a little somethin'
for a poor man?"
Here my aunt ami sister appeared.
He told us he was subject to rheuma
tism, and showed us his fingers, which
looked remarkably stiff One of his
lower limbs was affected in like man
ner, which made him use it with a pe
.culiar swing. Poor fellow!
He was very anxious to do a little
work so as to help some in the support
of his wife and numerous children. He
had lost his situation through illness.
Kate asked if he wouldn't like to go
into the country. She knew further
needed some one to do the little odds
about the farm. But the man thought
the climate wouldn't agree with him,
and then he couldn't bring himself to
part with his family, the only thing
left him in the world. We all sympa
thized with him, find Kate^felt asham
ed for having asked him such a thing.
Aunt Honora invited Mr. Poor Man
in. She left us to entertain him while
she went to the kitchen to- prepare
something hot. " Dear, sweet Aunt Ho
nora ! Always ready with sympathy
and a helping hand.
Kate and F took our visitor upstairs
to try on a pair of uncle's shoes, his
own were so worn out. He admired
various costly articles which were
scattered about the room. Nothing
seemed to escape him. Kate and I felt
that there must be something appre
ciative in his nature which made him
feel the value of what he saw. I
thought I heard him say "Oh. Solomon,
that's a corker!" to a handsome pen
knife that lay on the table, but Kate
did not hear any such comment, and
she thought, when we talked it over
afterward, that I must have been mis
taken, because he seemed such a gen
tlemanly fellow, and such an expres
sion was beneath him.
Having found a pair of shoes which
fitted him, we went downstairs to the
dining-room, where my aunt had a
nice warm supper spread.
He just ate and ate and ate, and how
he did enjoy everything! He was very
confidential and told us all his trou
blesâand how many he did have!
Aunt Honora gave him some money.
He was very, very thankful, and in his
humble way said, as he took his de
parture:
"May God keep yer well an' happy,
ladies, and bless yer with good hus
bands."
We were all very much affected, but
Aunt Honora was particularly touched,
and told him to call again whenever he
was in trouble, and gave him an extra
dollar. .
Everything was quiet and peaceful,
apparently, and after a time we slept
soundly, a-s healthy people are wont to
do. Suddenly it seemed as if a great
earthquake shook the house. The
shrill screams of my Aunt Susanâ
which were very shrill indeedâ mingled
with the loud, deep voices of men
awoke us from our slumbers. Kate
and I jumped up very much fright
ened. A knock on the door, anC the
gentle voice of Aunt Honora, very
much agitated, bade us hasten and un
lock it.
"What is the matter?" cried Kate.
"A burglar!" gasped my aunt, com
ing in quickly and then making sure of
all locks. Locks! Why, they were
mere playthings for such men. Noth
ing would do until wo pushed the bed
up against the door and then sat on it
to give it additional weight. That
would surely keep him out.
An intense stillness catne over the
house. NotÂ«a breath or morement could
be heard. We did not move a muscle,
but sat looking in a wild way at one
another, thinking possibly the burglar
having subdued my aunt and uncle,
was making his way toward us. We
sat numbed by awful suspense. A
hand was on the doorknob and gave
it a quick turn. Oh, the horror and
dread of that moment. We did not
leave our seats, but remained cold and
still, with glaring eyes fixed on the
door, or on as much as we could see o-f
it. Another turn, and yet another, and
then Aunt Susan's voice called, "Open,
quick!"
The relief was so great that for a
moment we were all helpless. We
gradually recovered, and moving the
bed to one side, let my aunt in.
"Where is he?" I whispered, opening
the door about two Inches for fear Mr.
Burglar might attempt following her
in, but, dear me, I miscalculated Aunt
Susan's size. Before she was wholly in
the room, the door was opened to a
considerable extent..
"Safe, thank goodness" â in reply to
my question. Then, loc-king around in
a bewildered way at the general hap
hazard fashion in which the furniture
stoodâ "Why, what's the matter?
Afraid of the burglar?"
Then, breaking into a very hearty
laugh, she said: "Oh, children, the
burglar is nobody but your own mis
chievous brother, who thought to play
a joke on you. He was also the tramp
who- came to the door with such a tale
of woe, and whom you so generously
wasted your sympathy upon. He says
the supper Aunt Honora prepared for
him tasted awfully good and he in
tends buying each of you girls a me
mento with the money donated to the
wants of his seventeen children."
Aunt Honora, dear soul, looked em
barrassed, and I for one was speech-
Clitra Malter.
Our young friends must not expect
"Brer Uncle Sam" to have an unbroken
series of victories over "Brer Spain."
Indeed, the Spanish rabbits have come
upon the scene to-day with a "moni
tor" which looks very dangerous to
"Brer Uncle Sam."
THE YARD OF COTTON.
ONE day not long ago a groan was
heard proceeding from a lunch
basket hanging in th<> cloakroom
of room No. 12, Bryant School,
Tacoma, Wash. A voice from
another basket hanging near asked
what was disturbing its neigh
bor that he uttered such mournful
sounds. Conversation continuing close
attention was given and this story was
heard: "I am bemoaning my fate. To
morrow I will be burned and I fear
will reach the end of my existence.
"Away down in Louisiana, several
years ago, a cotton planter gave me,
with several more of my kind, to his
little girl, to plant a cotton garden for
herself. I was an ordinary cotton seed
of irregular oval form and measuring
a fraction of an inch. My little mis
tress planted me and when I grew to be
a white tuft of cotton I was picked and
sent to the gin to be separated from the
seeds which grew with me. I was then
packed into a bale and sent to a town
where there are several cotton factories
and was there put through a carder,
which combs and straightens the fibers,
and then the spinner made me into
threads, which were afterward woven
into one yard of white cloth.
"Some of my comrades were sent to
the dye house and transformed into
pretty colors. I was sold later to a
flour bag manufactory and then to a
flouring mill, whence in course of time
I came forth bearing fifty pounds of
white flour. A lady bought me, and
great was my joy to find I had again
entered the home of my little mistress.

apron, and as I was fine and white and

THE FORGETFUL
MERCHANT.
BY J. G. LYLE
SAN FRANCISCO.
In the office of a large wholesale
house in the City of C , sat the
owner, Mr. Logan, who was looking
over some of the firm's books, when he
was interrupted by the appearance of
the elevator boy, Joe Barris.
"Mr. Logan," he said, "the elevator
gate has been broken nearly a week
and I am afraid some one will be
hurt."
"I'll have it attended to at once,
Joe," was the merchant's reply. And
he turned to his work once more.
Just then a man entered the office
and held a short conversation with Mr.
Logan. Then they left the store.
On Mr. Logan's return Joe again re
minded him about the broken elevator
gate.
"I'll send right out and have it fixed,"
was the merchant's answer, and then
he turned to converse with a friend.
Still Joe felt uneasy about the broken
gate. He knew if any one was to lean
against it the gate would open and the
she was economical, I was made into
the apron. I loved my little ' maid â â  so
much that I stayed by her five days In
the week, the other two days being
spent in the laundry.
"My new position pleased me so
much that -I resolved to last as long as
I could, but the harsh treatment given
me in the laundry wore me out, and I
was deposited in the rag bag. One day
the little maid wanted a slate cloth for
school, and her mother wanted a nice,
soft face cloth. I was taken from the
rag bag and divided to fill these wants.
You can imagine how pleased I was,
as I feared I would never see my little
maid again. I did not last long in my
new place, and was again thrown into
the rag bag, this time to be sold to a.
peddler, who turned me over to a fac
tory where I was made into wrapping
paper.
"I was sold by the factory to a store
In Tacoma and a few days ago I was
wrapped around . a parcel of cloth and
delivered to a house in the west end.
Some things inside of the house looked
familiar to me." and when the children
came home from school I was overjoyed
to find among them my little maid, who
had emigrated to Tacoma during my
absence. I was afraid she would not
know me, but she must have done so,
for she used me this norning to wrap
up her luncheon. Now I am sorrowful,
for I will no doubt be used in the
morning to start the breakfast fire. My
last wish is that the flames may turn
me into a cottonseed again, and that
I may become the property of another
little maid."

person would fall to the basement and
would most likely be seriously hurt.
The elevator was used a great deal
without Joe being in it and so he could
not caution everybody.
Two more days passed and the ele
vator gate still remained in the same
broken condition. Joe resolved to
speak to his employer once more.
When Joe spoke to Mr. Logan for the
third time about the gate, he exclaimed,
"It slipped my mind, I'll send Harris
(the janitor) to have it fixed at once."
And then he went out on some im
portant business.
On the following day Mr. Logan went
up in the elavator while Joe was absent
to select some certain goods. He had
evidently forgotten about the elevator
gate being broken, for on his way down
he leaned against it.
The gate gave way and Mr. Logan
fell to the floor below.
The noise brought several of his em
ployes to the scene. He was removed
to his home and a doctor summoned,
who found his injuries were not very
serious.
The next day Mr. Logan sent word to
the store to have the elevator gate fixed
at once.
Mr. Logan said, "It Is one of the best
lessons I ever learned In my life.
Never put off until to-morrow what can
be done to-day."

LITTLE GRETCHEN.
BY FLORENCE E. TILLEY
SAN FRANCISCO.
One morning, one of those exquisite
mornings that are to be had only in Hol
land, known as the home of the windmills,
little Gretehen was enjoying her usual
morning walk.
In this place nearly everybody raises
one's own vegetables, and Gretchen'3
family is one of the many who do. So
this is how she manages to get her usual
stroll. She is waked up every morning
an hour or two before breakfast, and
with her willow basket on her arm she
goes out to gather up the vegetables for
the day.
Innocent little Gretchen never dreams
of the o.uaint little picture she would
make for* some artist.
At last Gretchen has gathered up all she
needs. So she starts for home on a new
route. This leads through pleasant lanes
and through fields Vith brooklets by their
sides.
In the house breakfast has been prÂ»-
pared by her father, for her mother Is
unable to be about.
She often wishes her walks were longer,
for she loves to drink In the pure air but
she being the oldest is obliged to help,
and yet she brings in a great deal of sun
shine with her quiet ways to her poor
invalid mother.

These citizens constitute the new Grand

The jury was impaneled yesterday
morning by Presiding Judge Belch
er of the Superior Court. Twenty
three citizens of the thirty whose names
were drawn from the Grand Jury box
last Saturday were present when court
convened, and they were examined one
by one. Four presented excuses and were
discharged, and the remaining nineteen
were accepted. Atter appointing M. 11.
Hecht foreman, tne court proceeded to
deliver [he charge, and from its tenor it
is manifest that affirmative action is anx
iously hoped for. it was as follows:
"Gentlemen of the Grand Jury; You
are admonished to carefully remember

ilar, It is your sworn duty, under j
the .aw, to keep your own counsel, and

NEWS OF THE MINES.
Possible Complications
in Exempting Soldier-
Miners From As
sessment.
The Philippines May Become
a Field for American Min
ing Energyâ A Week's
Developments.
There is little doubt that Congress will
pass the pending bill exempting owners
of mining claims who enlist in the army
from doing the $100 worth of assessment
work on their claims. When it becomes
a law there will be room for much dis
cussion and many complications. If the
soldier owns a half or a quarter Interest,
how about the civilian partners? If the
half-owner who stays at home must do
$50 worth of work half the claim might
be Jumped if this half of the work was
not done and the soldier would not know
who his partner was until he got home.
Could the jumper change the name of the
mine and develop it without the soldier's
knowledge and consent? Various prob
lems would arise in connection with un
divided interests regulated by different
rules. On the other hand if the soldier"s
interest would exempt the whole claim
half the army would soon have partner
ship interests in mining claims. The law
will have to be carefully prepared. None
will dispute the primary justice of it.
While the Stars and Stripes float over
the Philippine Islands it is of interest to
know something of their mining possi
bilities. A mining manager of that part
of the world says of them: "As a min
ing country I have never seen its equal;
there is gold everywhere. The little
streams are full of placer gold and the
mountains a perfect network of small
ledges, some of them running as much as
from four to six ounces per ton; but the
people are at least one thousand years
behind the times; no work has yet been
done here in a systematic manner, and
for several reasons it is almost impossi
ble to prospect here. The Government
does not give the proper protection to
justify any man spending his time pros
pecting. Another reason is the interior
of the islands, which, in my opinion, is
the richest portion of them, are peopled
with wild tribes of Indians that are al
most as ferocious as wild beasts, and no
prospecting could be done in their terri
tory unless the prospectors went in large
iiiirties- and another reason is that the
foliage, which is a regular jungle, is so
thick that a man cannot get through it.
If any other nation on earth except the
Spaniards had this country, it would very
soon be the largest gold producing coun
try in the world, but everything is so
handicapped that it is impossible to get
capital to come in here, and it will take
capital to make a success of it. The ore
is all high grade, but I am a little afraid
it cannot be successfully worked by free
milling process. I have all the machinery
on hand for a 100-sta.mp mill, and, if it is
a success, the company will at once in
crease their works. They have any
amount of ore, and in this country of
cheap labor, they are bound to receive
large profits."
Regarding the present status of the in
teresting scheme of the Utica Mining
Company to firive an exploration tunnel
under the town of Angels Camp in a
search for new veins, the Mountain Echo
says: "The Utica Company will un
doubtedly receive the consent of every
property owner along the route selected
by the company to explore. Those who
nrst object.-d to granting the privilege
have since taken a different view of the
situation ami have signed the petition.
That is right; none of us can reach the
ores, if there are any, at a depth of 500
feet from the surface of our lots, while
the company can, with much ease, ex
plore at that depth for deeply hidden
ores."
The Albany Flat and Storm King
quartz mines have been bonded by Do
mingo Rolleri to the Nellie Mining Com
pany, having its headquarters in Stock
ton. The purchase price is $15,000, $1500
cash and the balance on or before Feb
ruary 3, 1900. The Nellie Mining Com
pany is composed of several leading citi
zens of Stockton, among whom are Dis
trict Attorney Nutter and Dr. L. Oli
vieri, and it is the Intention of this com
pany to immediately commence opera
tions.
It Is reported that the California Ex
ploration Company (limited) has at last
succeeded in purchasing the Thorpe mine
in Calveras County. The purchase price
Is over &iiXi,OoO.
At the (iwin mine they have an eight
foot ledge in the face of the south drift
on the 1400-foot level. At the south shaft
they have the water out down to the
1200-foot level. Free coarse gold has been
drawn up by the pumps and the water
is full of sulphurets. The water is run
through a flume, in which riffles are
placed to catch the free gold and hang
up the sulphurets.â Calveras Chronicle.
Several of our hydraulic mines are
likely to remain idle this season on
account of the scarcity of water. Tho
owners will put in the time fixing up
for next winter's supply of rain and
snow, without making any attempt to
turn In the scanty supply of water that
may be afforded before the dry, hot days
arrive. The San Francisco company
operating the Wright and Eastlick mines
at Oro Flno are working them energeti
cally, with the Evans elevators and
giants, which are operated with consider
able less water than the old elevators
formerly used. The company has still a
food supply of water in the ditch from
almon Mountain, but the season will be
shorter than usual. On Indian Creek in
Scott Valley, water is very scarce al
ready, hardly enough to supply the aras
traa tor crushing purposes.â Yreka Jour
nal.
Reports from Copoer City are to the
effect that a four-foot ledge of native
copper has been encountered on Bully
Hill on the property owned by Sallee &
McDonnell. Ever since the conclusion of
the Iron Mountain sale, in which these
gentlemen were interestedâ one :is an
owner, the other as a promoterâ they
have kept a force of men developing and
prospecting on Bully Hill. Two long tun
nels have been run into the mountain,
and several ledges and ore bodies have
been cross-cut as the work has been ex
] tended. Last Thursday, it Is reported,
I the miners operating under Superintend
i ent Penrose struck a ledge of fabulously
rich copper oreâ so rirri, in fact, that a
shot could not be put in with effect.
Chunks of native copper so heavy that
the men could hardly handle them were
taken out, and our informant saw several
specimens taken from the dump that
looked like the refined product.â Redding
Searchlight.
A rich strike in a ledge five feet wide
is reported from near Wniskytown. Shas
ta County.
The indications at the old Mineral Hill
mine, which adjoins th Spanish in the
Eureka district, are so favorable that in
p. few days the construction of a flve-
Ptamp mill will be commenced on the
property and a large force of men put to
work in order to more systematically de
velop the property. Eugene J. Hegarty
of San Franrlsco, who has a bond on the
mine, arrived recently. Mr. Hegarty
is a real estate dealer, and is a son of
Charles Heprarty, the well-known mer
chant of M. >ores Flat. In years gone
by the Mineral Hill paid well, and being
situated in a good locality, the outlook for
good returns are very encouraging. There"
is a ledge formation of forty feet between
the walls, from which good rock has
been extracted. With a mill on the prop
erty, the ores can of course be worked to
better advantage.â Grass Valley Union.
Prospecting is rather ory. work or is
becoming so. Pocket hunters who have
been waiting for water are In nearly the
same condition as tho farmers. It takes
water for the miners as well as the
farmers, but there Is one advantage the
pocket miner has some show even when
ft is dry. Pocket mining is a science and
is acquired after years of experience. It
is very common in our town for a pros
pector to bring in a rich specimen and
often a handful of them, and tho news of
the find is never heralded outside of the
town limits. Many of these finds if in
the vicinity of the north pole would load
a Great Eastern with prospectors for that
locality.â Mariposa Gazette.
It wns reported yesterday that James
Waugamnn was on a deal to sell his
Greenhorn mountain mine from which so
much gold has been taken in the past
year. The price to be paid was said to
be $4.".fi00. The deal was claimed to be a
sure go. The names of the proposed pur
chasers were not learned. The mine is
a valuable one and ought to bring a good
round price. There is some valuable ma
chinery to go with the trade.â Kern Coun
ty Echo.
The Centennial and other properties
bonded to T. B. Dillon and by him trans
ferred to the Columbia Gold Mininer Com
pany have reverted to the original own
ers, represented by A. Caminetti. The
company accomplished nothing except the
expenditure of about $10,000, which, of
course, is a dead loss to all concerned. â
Amador Ledger.
The shaft in the Harrison mine, Jaek
sonvillp. Is down 210 feet. Drifting and
crosscutting are groins on at that depth.
The Alameda shaft has reachod a depth
of 650 feet. The ore contains much high
grade sulphurets. The mine is soon to be
equipped with a twenty-stamp mill, work
on which will be commenced on the 20th
of the present month. At the Sell mine
over 500 feet of the old tunnel has been
straightened out and retimbered. leaving
about the same length to be attended to.
In the meantime a great deal of ore is
being taken from the stopes.â Sonora
Union-Democrat.
The new mill on the Lifghtner mine, ad
joining the Ttica on the West, was start
ed up the other day. Only five stamps
were put in motion in the beginning, but
we have learned that five more stamps
are now in operation, making in all ten.
This mill has a capacity of twenty
stamps, and is one of the finest mills ever
built in this county. The Lightner mine
I has a history. It was first located and
worked nearly forty years ago, and was !
then known to be a valuable property, i
Facilities for working ore at that time i
Wfre rather crude, and the parties who i
were attempting to work the mine had j
but little money and very little knowledge â¢
of how to reduce ore successfully. At that I
time there were no concentrators and no
means of saving the sulphurets, which
contains the greater portion of the gold,
other than by sluices riffled with gunny
sacks and blankets. Therefore, the mine
was not at that time a success. Under
the present improved system of reducing
the ore and concentrating the rich sul- ]
phurets the mine is hound to be a suc
cess. The parties having the mine in hand
at present have plenty of money and ;
every facility to extract the gold from the
ore, and, therefore, we may look for !
grand developments in this mine in the
near future. â Mountain Echo.
A fine ledge was encountered In the
Potazuba mine in Amador County last
week. Where discovered it was only two
feet thick, but gives promise of widen- i
ing. The regular monthly clean up at !
the South Eureka mine last week showed â 
no decrease in the richness of the ore. j
Sinking in the north shaft is still going :
on, and a depth of nearly 1500 feet has 'â 
been obtained.â Oalaveras Citizen.
The liveliest mining camps in the coun^ j
ty at present are on the rivers, where
work is crowded day and night in get
ting down to the pay channel. The sea
son, by reason of low water, is favorable !
for bottoming the channels with excel- I
lent success, and in a short time we ex
pect to hear of rich strikes in several
claims.â Yreka Journal.
Preparations are being made to Imme
diately commence development work at
the Jupiter gravel mine above lowa Hill, j
An incline will be run. to tap the channel. '
Steam power will be used.
Great activity prevails in river mining ,
in the Honolulu section of Klamath j
River. The claims are being worked night j
and day. The Manzanita, Versey Creek I
and McConnell & Qulnne and several |
others are hoisting pay gravel. Before j
very long the Pacific, P.enz Ear and !
others will have their wingdams com- i
pleted so as to begin hoisting. It is ex- I
pected that large yields of coarse gold
will be made in that section ere long.â
Aetna Standard.
H. Z. Osborne of the Los Angeles Ex- J
press is again in this district in the inter
est of his Coffee Creek property, the Ca- ;
ton mine. He has just returned from New i
York, where he went to Interest Eastern j
capital. Mr. Osborne was recently ap- j
pointed a United States Marshal for his j
district, and must be home within a week
to qualify. A miniature Coffee Creek
rush is again taking place, although noth- |
ing to compare with what is expected be
fore the season is fairly over. George L.
Carr has a ledge of copper ore sixty feet !
in width. He has done but little devel
opment work on the property, although it j
is admirably situated. The ledge shows i
plainly in the bed of the creek and ex- j
tends up the mountain side on each side j
