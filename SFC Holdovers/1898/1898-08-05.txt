FIRST DASH OF T HE POWERFUL FARRAGUT
Th>e Terrible Torpedo-Boat Destroyer, Turrjed Out by the Union Iron WorKs of this City, Was Given a Successful
Preliminary Trial Trip Around" the Bay Yesterday.
THE torpedo-boat destroyer Farragut made a dash around the bay yester
day, and attracted the notice of throngs of people along the water front.
The performance of the boat was simply an engineer's trial, to observe
how.the engines and machinery connections worked. Among the builders
aboard of the craft were Henry T. Scott, president of the Union Iron Works;
Robert Forsyth, superintending engineer, and others. Captain Minor Qoodall
' commanded the boat. â  â  ..
The boat is so lightâ only an eighth of an Inch in thickness of hullâ and the
engines so powerful, that it was hot safe to allow many revolutions of the
engine at the clock; hence for the trial of the machinery it waa decided to put
the: boat ] n the stream. At'u-r several turns around the lower bay from the
works to Hunters Point the Farragut was headed for San Pablo Bay, whil<i
steam was raised in all the boilers. No effort was made to develop a high

. PONCE. Porto Rico, Aug. 3.â By The
Call-Herald dispatch-boat to . St.
Thomas, I). W. 1., Aug. 4.â Major Gen
i pral Miles, having received information
that the fine military road from Ponce
to San Juan had been mined by the
Spaniards, has formed practically a
now plan for the Porto Rican cany
paign. In accordance with this new
plan General Stone, with some of the
Wisconsin troops, is pressing rapidly
j toward Arecibo on the northern coast
of the island, and General Brooke, who
has arrived with General Harris and
! 1200 men, will advance toward San
Juan from Arroyo. By this plan Gen
eral Miles- will avoid risking the lives
, of the American troops through the ex
j plosion of mines along the military
road and the use of explosives which
the Spaniards have hidden : in the
bushes along the way. At the same
time, he will foil a considerable body
of Spanish troops in the town of Al
bonito, where the enemy Is. understood
to be ready to make a strong resist
ance. .
The unsafe portion of the military
road, by the reports brought to Gen
eral Miles, lies between Juan Diaz and
j Albonito. General Stone, after occu
; pying Adjuntas to the north of Ponce,
has taken Company C, Second Wiscon
sin Regiment, as far. north as Utuado,
fifteen miles beyond Adjuntas. This
road is not adapted to the transporta
tion of artillery and wagons, but cav
alry and Infantry will have no diffi
culty in advancing by this route to
Arecibo, from which point the railroad
and a good dirt road' extend to â  San
Juan. The artillery and wagons will
be sent by' transports to Arecibo, and
it will be a simple matter to take
them with, the army toward San Juan.
While the Spanish . capital is being
threatened from the. west by. the ad
vance of General Stone's troops, the
troops under General Brooke and Gen
eral Harris- will be moving from Ar
royo to Cayey, where.t hey will seize
the military road beyond the danger
points, and from which place the
Americans can advance rapidly upon
San Juan. :
The Spanish troops who are prepar
ing to resist the Americans at Aibo
nito, unless they make a forced march
from that place toward San Juan, are
likely to find themselves beset by the
American . troops on both sides. The
Americans who landed at Ponce are
steadily pushing forward, and their
outposts now are twenty miles beyond
this city; No large forces of Spaniards
have been encountered and the Stars
and Stripes are waviner over all the
neighboring towns. Our troops are be
ing welcomed everywhere with enthu
siasm. The importc.it town of Coamo
is still unoccupied by the American
troops. At dusk on Monday ja recon
noltering party under Lieutenant Fin
nerty advanced to the suburbs. Think
ing there was no considerable force
near they at once opened lire upon the
volunteer picket which was inoffensive
ly observing the approach of the sol
diers. The volunteers immediately
fled from the town without returning
the fire of the Americans. Our soldiers
numbered less than twenty. Believing
themselves opposed by a strong Span
ish force they retired and retraced their
way to Juan Diaz. I went six miles
beyond our picket lines to-day, which
are now a mile beyond Juan Diaz.
From where I stopped I could see the
picturesque village of Coamo nestling
among the hills. I met several of the
citizens, who showed an exceedingly
friendly disposition toward the Ameri
can people. They said tney were anx

ARROYO, PORTO RICO, Aug. 3, by
The Call-Hei-ald dispatch boat Min
dora to St: Thomas! D..W. 1., Aug. 4.â
With sharpn-ell from the St. Louis and
Cincinnati, bursting on the hills back
of Guayarna Bay the American troops
under command of General Brooke are
being landed- here. â¢ "While the Spanish
troops were being kept away from
shore by this fire.. Colonel Halhes with
the Fourth Pennsylvania, Fourth Ohio
and Third Illinois, has been landing
through the. surf. General Brooke
went ashore early from the St. Louis.
The village of Arroyo was turned, over
to him by Lieutenant Commander
Wainwright of the Gloucester, to whom
the village had surrendered on Mon- .
day.
Lieutenant Woods and fifty marines
from the. Gloucester have been holding
the village since its surrender.' A de
tachment of mounted Spaniards in an
effort to. regain possession of the vil
lage made an attack on Monday, night.
After a sharp skirmish the Spaniards
were repulsed without loss to the
Americans.
The members of the Third Illinois
were landed yesterday, being covered
by the fire of the Gloucester. Against
this increased American force the
Spaniards' made a second attack to
day and were again repulsed, .and.fif
teen of their soldiers were taken pris
oners. ' . â¢
The work of landing the American
troops is still under way to-night,
searchlights being used to facilitate
the landing.
When all of the troops have been sent
ashore, General Brooke to-morrow will
advance against Guayama, while the
St. Louis and Cincinnati will pour a
hot fire of shrapnel in the direction of
t!*e place. It is expected the Spaniards
will make a desperate resistance. It is
understood they have a considerable
force in the bills between here and
Guayama, and the garrison in the
town is reported to number 1500 men.
This evident determination of the
enemy to resist the American advance
at this point is due to the strategic im
portance . of Guayama to General
Brooke. He .will advance from Guay
ama to the San Juan military road,
and. thus- be able to either frighten
the strong Spanish force from Albonito
or else. will put them in a pocket. This
brilliant stroke was devised by Gen
eral Miles.
WADE'S DEPARTURE
HAS BEEN POSTPONED
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.-^A Washington
special to the Herald says: "According
to the. present understanding there will
be a suspension for the present of the
proposed expedition to Porto Rico un
der command of Major General Wade."
This statement was made to" me by
an official at the War Department to
day. General Corbin denied that such
an order had been issued in writing.
One reason given me was that the re
moval of the sick from Santiago was
the first object now. Another reason
stated was that the peace negotiations
might render unnecessary a second
Porto Rican exepdition.
At the Adjutant General's office it
was stated the expedition would ei.i
bark as fast as there were transports
to take the men. This means, under
the present conditions, practically an
indefinite postponement.

to convince the builders that the contract requirement of thirty knots an hour

A trial of speed will not be made. In the Santa Barbara channel, but the

Speaking of the Farragxit yesterday.- Henry T. Scott, did not express, the
slightest doubt o.f .the boat's ability to make thirty knots an hour. "If she
does not," remarked Mr. Scott, "thera will be a fine pleasure boat in the bay."
AGUINALDO COWED
BY THE FIRMNESS
OF GEN. MERRITT
Special Cable to The Call and tiiÂ«- \evÂ» York Herald. Copyrighted, 1888,
by James Gordon. Bennett.
CAVITE, July 30, via Hongkong, Aug. 4. â It is believed
that the course that is being followed by General Merritt,
. commander of the American military forces here, will avert the
threatened trouble with the insurgents. He is taking a very
firm attitude toward the rebels, with the result that there is a
very material change in the situation.
Aguinaldo, the rebel leader, is dismounting from his high
horse, and instead of acting, as he did for a time, as though he
was master of the situation* he now is adopting a far more
conciliatory attitude, lie doesn't talk in such a grandiose man
ner of what the Filipinos intend to do when Manila has fallen.
On the contrary, he has asked permission of General Mer
ritt to march Filipin troops, through the city after the Ameri
cans have captured it. He also suggested to General Merritt
the formation of native regiments to be commanded by Amer
ican officers.
It is very evident that a great light has dawned on Agui
naldo and that he realizes the futility of opposing the wishes
of the Americans. His suggestion regarding the placing of
American officers in command of native, regiments is well un
derstood to be prompted by. his desire to avoid disarmament of
his followers, a course that was sure to have followed had the
threatening attitude of the rebels toward the Americans been
maintained.
The Astor battery of artillery, which arrived here on the
steamer Newport, is now in position before Malate, a short dis
tance from Manila. The battery is occupying trenches from
which, the insurgents were withdrawn. It is supported by a
battalion of the Third Artillery, acting as infantry. The bat
tery is within a thousand yards of the Spanish lines.
Fathers Doherty and McKinnon went to Manila to-day
under a flag of truce to see the Archbishop for the purpose of
impressing on him the futility of further resistance on the part
of the defenders of the city. The Archbishop wields great in
fluence, but it is not known that he can be prevailed upon to
use it to prevent the slaughter that will surely attend the tak
ing of the city by assault. At the time of the sending of this
dispatch the American priests had not returned from their mis
sion. . â¢..â¢â¢

from Iloilo, brought up to July 15, show
that the operations against the Insur

skirmishes with bands in the Camarines
Province, the. insurgents being beaten,
and that the insurrection in the. north
ern provinces had been suppressed.
According to the same report a Brit
ish steamer, loaded with natives and
a cargo of arms, was coasting along

SUCH THE
BELIEF OF
McKJNLEY
But if Spaniards Learn the
True pever Conditions
It May Cause a
Delay in Peace.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â The Washington 'correspondent o!
the Herald sends the following: President McKinley is now
waiting for Spain's final acceptance of the terms laid down by the
United States as the basis on which peace negotiations are to be
conducted.
Spain not only knows the terms on which the United States
will conclude peace, but she now knows, as the result of the con
ference of Embassador Cambon with President McKinley yester
day, that those terms will not be changed and that she can do one
of two things â either accept them in their entirety and bring hos
tilities to an end, or reject them and let the war go on.
The President is convinced that one result of his latest con
ference with Embassador Cambon is that Spain will accept. He
believes that the Spanish Government has had enough fighting,
and realizes if the war is continued that the conditions will be
much harder in the end.
There is only one thing about which the authorities are un
easy. They are pfraid that if the Spanish Government learns the
truth about the deplorable condition of Major General Shafter's
army at Santiago Sagasta and his associates may be encouraged
to continue the war, reiving on the climate and fevers of the West
Indies to prove more efficient in defeating the armies of the
United States than are the Spanish soldiers. For this reason the
War Department has instituted a strict censorship on all cable
grams going to Europe in which any reference to the health con
ditions in American camps in Cuba is made. It may be impossi
ble, however, to keep the information from Spain, as foreign em
bassies and legations here have doubtless informed their Govern
ments of the situation, and the truth may leak from some other
European capital to Madrid.
SPAIN CANNOT GET
BETTER CONDITIONS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.â There is a
confident belief among the administra
tion officials that the Spanish Govern
ment will accept the terms laid down
by the President and the delay of a day
or two in recognizing the inevitable is
to be accounted for by reason of Span
ish internal politics, which would not
countenance an unresisting submission
without at least a display of a purpose
to improve the terms. This, however,
cannot be accomplished and the French
Embassador. who is well aware of the
fact, unquestionably has so informed
the Spanish Government, though that
Government has preserved its record
in good form to meet criticism of its po
litical opponents by submitting the
counter proposition presented yesterday
by M. Cambon to the President.
PUBLICITY IS NOT
RELISHED IN SPAIN
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, . 1&98, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, Aug. 4.â The most rigor
ous censorship ever seen here is placed
upon everything concerning peace ne
gotiations. Ministers observe a mys
terious attitude and sphinxlike silence.
You can therefore easily imagine the
feelings excited in official circles by the
telegram from "Washington to the ef
fect that President McKinley has ta
ken the entire American people into his
confidence regarding the terms of
peace. The ill effect here is little con
cealed. The Ministerial organ, El Lib
eral, in an article evidently inspired,
says under the heading "American In
discretion": "The governors of North
America understand and conduct in a
plebeian manner the art of politics and
the resources of diplomacy. For them
professional reserve and absolute si
lence upon which depend the salvation
of a nation are ridiculous antiquities,
admissible only for the people of Eu-
rope. In our opinion, it is much bet
ter to stop giving information to the
press and give no information or note
of any kind to the vulgar."
The Heraldo, however, takes the mat
ter on much broader lines. It says:
"The American Government proposes
to discuss the terms of peace in the full
light of day, consulting the opinions of
notable men of the country and prin
cipal Senators, communicating with the
press, fortifying itself with the spirit
of the army in Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, and personages of
other parties, and does not need to heed
either the general peasants or general
public opinion."
The Queen is taking means to con-
sult with all important leaders, politi
cal and otherwise, before she takes def
inite action on President McKinley's
propositions. Campos, Robl^do, Sil
vela, Montero Rios, president of the
jÃenate, and Marqjies Vera de Aris<\
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
president of Congress, will give their
opinions, besides others.
A statement made in the Paris Temps
that the yueen had sent a letter to
President McKinley asking him to deal
leniently with Spain is pure fiction.
The Minister of War denies the sen
sational story that Colonel Martin haa
been shot in Porto Rica
All political interest to-day centers
in the meeting of leading politicians
with the head Government. It is said
they are one and all in favor of peace.
The consultation between the Pre
mier, the presidents of the chambers
and other prominent persons are de
scribed as being of a really national
character, with a view of ascertaining
the views of all parties. The Govern
ment has not yet entered upon any
agreement regarding terms for con
cluding the war with the United States.
The Cabinet will follow the advice of
the party leaders and will leave to the
crown the liberty of choosing new ad
visers.
All the leaders consulted thus far
have observed the strictest reserve,
with the exception of Senor Romero y
Robledo, the leader of the Weylerite
party, who declares himself in favor
of continuing the war.
An official dispatch from San Juan
de Porto Kico says: "Most of the vol
unteers are in a disorganized condition
and are abandoning their arms."
SAGASTA DESIRES
TO PROCEED SLOWLY
LONDON, Aug. s.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says: Though
peace is regarded as assured it may
not be obtained so early as is generally
expected. Senor Sagasta objects to be
ing hustled and insists on everything 1
being done in a quiet, orderly and dig
nified manner. He considers it neces
sary to have full and satisfactory ex
planations as to all doubtful points, in
order to enable him best to protect the
national interests against the aggres
sive tendency of the Washington Cabi
net. He has to examine very minutely
the exigencies of the internal situation
and home politics, so as to avoid popu
lar dissatisfaction and political unrest.
The Spanish people, though sincerely
desirous of peace, are disposed to ad
mire this hesitancy and tenacious hold
ing out till the last, although aware
that it implies greater sacrifices.
As an illustration of this feelingf,
while General Toral is blamed for ca
pitulating at Santiago, Captain General
Augusti, continuing a hopeless resist
ance at Manila, bids fair to be a popu
lar hero. It wc-uld be premature to
suppose that the political consultations
now proceeding foreshadow the resig
nation of the Liberal Cabinet when
peace is concluded. The Conservatives
have so constantly and loyally sup
ported Sagasta throughout the war
that no- factious opposition need be
feared from them.

Daily Mail says: P"*e Government has

BY SECRETARY ALGER
The Leader of the Rough Riders Told
Not to Make "Invidious

WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.â The follow

Colonel Roosevelt and Secretary Alger:
"SANTIAGO, July 23, 1898.â My Dear
Mr. Secretary: I am writing with the
knowledge and approval of General

"We earnestly hope that you will
send vs â most of the regulars, and at
any rate the cavalry division, including
the Rough Riders, who are as pood as
any regulars and three times as good
as any State troopsâ to Porto Rico.
There are lÂ«00 effective men in this di
vision; if those who were left behind
â were joined to them we could land at

close to 4000 men, who would be worth
easily any 10.000 National Guards armed
with black powder Springfields or other
archaic weapons. Very respectfully,

The following reply was cabled to
Colonel Roosevelt to-day:
Y>>ur letter of the 23d is received.
The regular army,' the volunteer army:
and the Rough Riders have done well,
but I suggest that unless you want to

ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs the following: As an earnest
intention of the administration to pro
vide protection for American interests
In the Pacific and the far East, steps
have been taken to establish a coaling
station at Pago Pago, in the Samoan
Islands. Plans'- and specifications for
the proppsed ' buildings and pier have
been practically perfected and con
tracts for their construction on the Pa
cffic: Coast will be let by Commander
Z. L. Tanner (retired), who is now on
hi? way to San Francisco.
As to the cause of the administra
tion's action, it can be stated on the
highest" authority that the President
directed the storing of coal at Pago
Pago because of Mis desire to put the
navy into a position to meet on equal
terms in the far East the navy of any
other nation, not that there is any dan
ger of hostilities with any European
ptfwer, but the possibilities of compli
cations growing out of the Philippines
are so great that McKinley deems it
prudent to be prepared.

RUSE OF SPANIARDS FAILS

Excellent Work of the Auxiliary
Warship While on Guard
Off the Harbor of
Neuvitas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Aug. 4.â No confirma
tion has been received here of the re
port that Neuvitas, the chief port of
j the province of Puerto Principe, has
I been evacuated by the Spaniards after
a bombardment by American warships.
The auxiliary cruiser Badger cap
tured three prizes off Neuvitas on July
26 and left with them that day for the
Tortugas, arriving: here this morning.
Captain Snow said that at the time of
his departure all but about 1800 Span
ish troops had left the city and a gen
eral evacuation was expected, but that
to all intents and purposes the place
was still held by the enemy and there
had been nothing in the nature of an
attack.
The Badger was covering the block
ade station at Neuvitas on July 26
when one of the Spanish boats slipped
stern foremost to the mouth of the har
bor and took a peep at her. The enor
mou: hull of the American ship brist
ling with Nordenfeld guns scared her
and she scurried back to shelter.
A little while later three vessels were
observed coming out in excellent for
mation and Captain Snow thought a
good fight was coming. He brought his
ship up to the mouth of the harbor and
prepared to give the Spaniards a warm
greeting when it was discovered that
Instead of gunbjats the advancing
ships were a tug, a brigantine and a
barge, the last two in tow, all flying
Spanish and Red Cross flags. A couple
of shots from a six-pounder was fired
in their direction and they promptly
surrendered. The tug was the Hum
bert Rodriguez, fine and new and worth
about $7000. The brigantine was the
San and the barge was the San Fran
cisco.
A party from the Badger boarded the
prizes and found distributed over them
about 400 Spanish soldiers who it was
said had been ordered to Havana by
General SaJcido. The surgeon in charge
asserted that there were six cases of
yellow fever among the troops, but a
careful examination by the Badger's
doctor and afterward by other phy
sicians at Tortugas snowed there was
no infection among the men and that
the Red Cross flags were used as a ruse.
At Neuvitas the Badger also took
aboard eight deserters from the Span
ish army who are still on board the
ship. They are a sergeant and seven
privates of the Twenty-second Cadiz
Battalion.
The Badger proceeded with her prizes
from Neuvitas to Havana, where" she
reported to Commodore Howell, who
ordered them to Tortugas. At that
place Captain Snow communicated with
the Washington authorities and was
instructed to send all the prisoners to
Havana If one ship could carry them
or if not to put some >? them on a
second ship and send them to New
York. In accordance with the depart
ment's instructions Lieutenant Edward
M. Peters with two officers and two
men was put in charge of the prizes
and left with them for Havana, He
will then proceed with a tug load of the
Spanish prisoners to New York.
The Badger Is manned by New Jer
sey naval reserves.
ADMIRAL CERVERA THANKED.
Incident of a Benefit at Which Lieu-
tenant Hobson Presides.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â The benefit for
the New York Soldiers' and Sailors'
Families' Protective Association held
to-night at the Metropolitan Opera
House, was more in the nature of a re
ception to Lieutenant Hobson, Minister
to Spain Woodford and Captain Phil
lips of the Texas, than a benefit. The
opera house was jammed with people,
almost 6000 being present.
General Woodford came out upon the
platform and the audience received him
with a great outburst of enthusiasm.
A few minutes afterward came Presi
dent John Byrne of the association,
who introduced Lieutenant Hobson as
the presiding officer. The introduction
was a signal for a continuous round of
cheers. Lieutenant Hobson made a
speech In which he recalled the actions
around Santiago and described in de
tail how he and his companions Bank
the Merrimac.
A resolution was adopted on behalf of
New York, thanking Admiral Cervera
for his magnanimous conduct toward
Lieutenant Hobson and his companions.

LARGE SQUADRONS TO
GUARD OUR INTERESTS
Those on the European and Pacific
Stations Will Be Strongly
Reinforced.
NEW YORK, Auk. 4.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Lung- announces to-day that as soon us
peace is declared he proposes to rc-is
taMish the Kuropean and Pacific squad
rons. Th(? Secretary has been consider
ing the status of the navy after war is
ended and has already entered into a
preliminary discussion with bureau chiefs
of the department respecting a reorgani
zation of the service. I understand he
intends to retain In the service some of
the best auxiliary cruisers and- yachts
which have been doing such effective ser
vice in Cuban waters. while others, he told
me, would be sold, the proceeds being put
into the treasury.
The department cannot yet determine
which vessels will comprise the Euro
pean and Pacific squadrons, in view of
the prospect of the dispatch of strong
reinforcements to Rear Admiral Dewey,
but the Secretary Intends to attach
to each station a force which will ude
quately represent the service and In Eu
ropean waters particularly demonstrate
to foreign governments the ability of the
United States to defend itself.
GILKISON IS CENSURED
AND THEN RE-ELECTED
League of American Municipalities
Disciplines Its Secretary
for Irregularities.
DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 4.â The League
of American Municipalities this after
noon adopted the report of its special
auditing committee censuring Its secre
tary, B. F. Gilkison of New York, for
Irregularities in the handling of the
league's funds. The league, however, re
elected the secretary in consideration of I
his sorvicfs In perfecting the organiza
tion and on thf- theory that his failure
to turn over the funds to the treasurer
and to give the vouchers required by the
auditing committee were technical errors
and ought not to be construed as a re
flection upon his character or ability.
A warm debate succeeded the reading
of the report, several delegates contend
ing that its adoption would be unfair to
Gilkison and discreditable to the league,
especially since Gilkison had been the
prime mover and worker in organizing
the league. Others asserted that the bus
iness of the organization should be con
ducted on strictly business principles and
could find no excuses for the secretary's
derelictions.
For secretary. Gilkison received the
votes of twenty-seven cities against thir
teen for John Mahoney of Indianapolis
and one for President Macvlcar.
Mayor Black of Columbus, Ohio, was
elected president, receiving the votes of
thirty-one cities, against the votes of
thirteen cities cast for Mayor Maybury
of Detroit. Mayor Taylor of Bridgeport,
Conn., was elected treasurer. The newly
elected trustees are: Mayor Macvicar of
Dcs Moines, Mayor Smythe of Charles
ton, S. C, and Mayor Ashley of New Bed
ford, Mass.
Syracuse, N. V., was chosen as next
year's convention city.
The advisability of municipal owner
ship of public service industries is ap
parently no longer questioned by the
members. The subject waa discussed In
to-day's meeting. While aM had apparent
ly come to favor the proposition the quts
tion of how to effect a transfer of plants
from private to public ownership remains
a knotty problem, varying greatly ac
cording to the local conditions. It seemed
to be the consensus that local civil ser
vice ought to be applied as a primary
requisite before municipal ownership can
be generally and profitably effected.

BLOCKS A ROAD AND
DESTROYS A BRIDGE
Lumber Company's Method of En
forcing Its Claim to Land
Near Boulder Creek.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 4.â Boulder Creek
Is excited over the Pescadero Lumber
Company placing: a barbed-wire fence
acroSÃ the road In Big Basin leading to
H. L. MJddleton's lumber mill. In conse
quence, Mlddleton has to move hia Itim^
ber-yard to the side of the hill. The Pes
cadero Lumber Company also destroyed
a bridge, which caused Middleton trouble
In delivering 20,000 railroad ties for which
he had a contract. F. N. Walters has 700
cords of wood which he is unable to get
to a shipping point. There are several
four-horse teams and mules in the block-
I aded district, which cannot be got out
until tho bridge is replaced.
The Peacadero Lumber Company claims
the land by the Sioux script act. The
I road has been open since 1881, and is
! claimed to be a public highway. Lltiga
; tion will result. Many owners of land in
! Big Basin are affected by the closing of
i the road, bting unable to get their wood
out.
WATER COMPANY MAY
COLLECT THE RATES
Judge Shaw Temporarily Dissolves
the Injunction Granted
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 4.â Superior Judge
Shaw to-day dissolved temporarily the
injunction restraining the water company
from collecting water rates for the month
of August. His reason for so doing was
that he was disqualified from sitting in
the case, ns he was a ratepayer and,
therefore, an Interested person. This ac
tion is taken without prejudice and the
city's application for an Injunction and
requesting the appointment of a receiver
to take charge of the water Compaq -.
plant pending a determination by a. .
trators as to its value, will now go before
Superior Judge Oster of San Bernardino
for settlement.
The decision of Judge Shaw to-day In
no way can be regarded as a defeat for
the city. According to the decision of the
Supreme. Court of the State in the San
Diego city water case there remained
nothing for Judge Shaw to do but to dis
solve the injunction.

MOST RETREAT

Shafter's Army Ordered
to San Luis.
SOLDIERS SHOULD GO NORTH
OFFICEKS POINT OTJT GRAVE
DANGER AT SANTIAGO.
As the Result of a "Round Robin"
the General Demands That His
Men. eB Removed With
in Two Weeks.
Copyrighted. 1898, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 3 (de
layed in transmission).â Summoned by-
Major General Shafter, a meeting was
held here this morning at headquarters,
and in the presence of every command
ing and medical officer of the Fifth
Army Corps, General Shafter read a
cable message from Secretary Alger,
ordering him, at the recommendation
of Surgeon General Sternberg, to move
the army Into the interior to San Luis,
where it is healthier.
As a result of the conference Gen
eral Shafter will insist upon the imme
diate withdrawal of the army north
within two weeks.
After Colonel Roosevelt had taken the
initiative by writing a lettftr to General
Shafter explaining the situation and
the necessity of the prompt removal of
the men to avoid the risks of yellow
fever, the general officers united in a
"round robin" addressed to General
Shafter. It reads in part:
We believe that yellow fever in the
army at present Is not epidemic; that
there are only a few sporadic cases, but
that the army is disabled by malarial
fever to the extent that Its efficiency is
destroyed, and that it is in condition to
be practically destroyed by an epidemic
of yellow fever, which Is sure to come In
the enar future.
We know from the reports of compe
tent officers and from personal observa
tions that the army Is unable to move
into the interior, and that there are no
facilities for such move if attempted,
and that it could not be attempted un
til too late. Moreover, the best medical
authorities of the island say that with
our present equipment we could not live
in the interior during the rainy season
without losses from malarial fever, which
Is almost as deadly as yellow fever.
This army must be moved at once, or
perish. As the army can be safely moved
now, the persons responsible for prevent
ing such a move will be responsible for
the unnecessary loss of many thousand
lives.
Our opinions are the result of careful
personal observation, and they are also
based on the unanimous opinion of our
medical officers with the army. We un
derstand the situation absolutely."
WILL BE REMOVED BY
THE END OF AUGUST
That Is the Best That Can Be Done
for the Fever-Stricken Troops
in Shaf ter's Army.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 4.â Colonel Theo
dore Roosevelt of the Rough Riders has
succeeded In hurrying the movements of
the War Department in fetching Shaf
ter's army away from Santiago, though
in his disregard- of the conventionalities
he has drawn on his head a rather sharp
rebuke from the Secretary of War, who
evidently regards the course pursued by
Colonel Roosevelt as being calculated to
Injure discipline, though inspired by the
most worthy motives. It Is only fair to
state that the War Department for some
time has been intent upon removing these
troops, and it is now more than a week
ago that General Shaft er waa Instructed
by a special cablegram to cheer up the
soldiers by publicly Informing them of
the determination. It was rather a ques
tion of ways and means than a lack of
intention to redeem this promise that
caused delay. As far as the question of
removing the troops back into the moun
tains was concerned (the question which
seems to have precipitated the indigna
tion meeting among American cnmmand
erÃ at Santiago), it is learned the medical
department here made no such recom
mendation. All that it had to say on this
subject was that if the troops must re
main near Santiago an effort should be
made to remove tnem at once to some
healthier camping ground.
Burgeon General Sternberg agrees thor
oughly with the opinion expressed by the
signers of the "round robin" atÂ»Santlago
that men who have suffered from the se
vere malarial fevers of the south Cuban
coast, so far from being Immune against
attacks of yellow fevar, as has been as
serted in some quarters, are actually in
wry much greater danger than those
who have escaped the malaria.
The department to-day gave out a
statement of its resources in the way of
transports at Santiago, and as an inci
dent directed attention to the fact that
the troops cannot bo withdrawn as a
whole until the Spanish prisoners are dis
posed of. It is the expectation, however,
that all of the American troops will have
been removed from Santiago to the Unit
ed States by the end of this month, and
that is probably the very best that can be
done under the circumstances.

BIG FALLING OFF IN
THE ASSESSMENT ROLL
Indications Are It Will Be Many
Millions of Dollars Below That
of Last Year.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 4.-The State
Board of Equalization will be at work
during the remainder of the week com
paring the Assessors' figures of this year
with those of last. So far it is found that
there has been a general falling off of
values except In the mountain counties,
these latter having, as a rule, slightly
increased their rolls.
The indications are that the roll this
year will fall many millions of dollars
below that of last year. This is estimat
ed on the basis of the Assessors' reports,
nearly all of which havo been received.
The board will be able to determine be
fore the middle of next week what coun
ties, if any, it will cite to show cause
â¢why their rolls should not be raised.

Origin of a Rumor That a Spanish

SAUSALITO, Aug. 4.â The network
of torpedoes in the bay seems to be by
far a greater menace to navigation and
the health of small boys than does the
Spanish navy. One or two accidents
and several foolhardy ventures have
kept the public mind in a state of un
easiness, resulting lately fn the circu
lation of various extravagant rumors,
A story went the rounds to-day to the
effect that a Spanish spy had been de
tected in the act of cutting one of the
cables holding a. torpedo in place and
was fired upon by the guards at the
torpedo station a mile south of here.
The torpedo was said to have been
brought to Sausalito by a number of
small boys. Inquiry from the guards
at the station proved the rumor
groundless. ,None of them had even*
heard of such a tale.
"On July â 2 V stated Lieutenant
Shunk, the officer in charge, "the pro
peller of a steamer c + the cable hold
ing a torpedo, which floated out beyond
the heads and was brought back by
some fishermen. If a vessel had
struck it there uilght have been a repe
tition of the Maine. disaster. This occur
rence was probably the source of the
rumor."
Two weeks ago four lads from San
Francisco hired a boat and went row
ing. .They pulled their boat alongside
a torpedo buoy, and began to poke it
with their oars, evinentlv unaware of
its dangerous nature. A guard rushed
down to the shore and shouted to the
boys, who yelled back uncomplimentary
remarks and tried to pull the buuy from
its moorings. At this four rifle balls
were sent over their heads, whereupon
they rowed back to Sausalito in affright
and took the next boat for Ssan Fran
cisco.

of taxation and tariff and navigation

whether laws exactly similar to those
governing this country will be applied
to Hawaii. There will have to be a
uniform system of taxation.

been much talked of and it seems to

are not ready for statehood."
HAWAIIAN TRADE OPEN
TO FOREIGN VESSELS
XEVT YORK. Aug. 4.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Acting
Secretary of the Treasury Spauldlng to
day decided that trade between ports
in the United States and ports in the
Hawaiian Islands was not coastwise
trade within the meaning of the law,
and that it was open to vessels of all
nationalities, except those of Spain,
with which this country is now at war.
This decision was called out by in
quiries from shipping men who wanted
to know whether they could load car
goes for the Hawaiian Islands on ves
sels flying foreign flags, or whether
they would be required to use only
American vessels, as is the case in
trade with United States ports.
The decision that foreign vessels can
be used was based on the decision by
the Attorney General, announced last
week, that, the annexation resolutions
having expressly provided that exist
ing laws should remain in force In Ha
waii until changed by Congress, navi
gation laws must be enforced as before
annexation. Under the decision of Act
ing Secretary Spaulding trade relations
between the United States and Hawaii
will remain unchanged by Congress,
Just the same as if Hawaii were a for
eign territory. When Congress meets
the whole question of whether trade be
tween the United States and outlying
countries like Hawaii, Porto Rico, the
Ladrones and American possessions in
the Philippines is to be considered as
coastwise trade and limited to vessels
of the United States, will come up for
consideration.

Special Dispatch to The Call. â *â â  '
BERLIN, Aug. 4. â To-day's ceremony
was brilliant and impressive as regards
court display, but quite disappointing
in other respects. It bore traces of
haste and half-heartedness. The church
was Inadequately decorated and the
public displayed no enthusiasm In the
ceremonial, which, so far from having
the exceptional character of great na
tional mourning for a great statesman,
differed hardly any from hundreds of
similar functions that may be wit
nessed here at any time.
Perhaps the most disappointing fea
ture, though It was known beforehand,
was the fact that not a single member
lof the Bismarck family attended. The
royal pew, set apart for their accom
modation, remained significantly
empty. It must be admitted that the
deceased stateeman was not altogether
popular with the masses in Berlin, but
on such an occasion this alone could
hardly account for the sparseness and
nondescript character of the public at
tracted to the scene. The bitterness
of the old chancellor toward the young
Kaiser seems to reach beyond death.
To-day's incident was emphasized by
the fact that Prince Herbert Bismarck
came to Berlin during the afternoon on
private business.
The proceedings were characterized
by the utmost simplicity, but the Em
peror's invitations in the official world
were liberally responded to, many of
the leading men coming from distant
places for the Bole purpose of being
present. The Emperor and Empress
arrived by train at Charlottenburg and
drove to the church in an open, lan
dau, drawn by four- horses with pos
tillions, preceded by outriders and es
corted by two squadrons of cuirassiers.
Shortly after the service they left for
Wilhelmshohe. The Kings and Federal
Princes of the empire were not there in
person, but only by representatives. All
present wore mourning except those
who appeared in uniform. The pres
ence of Dr. Carl yon Boettlcher, for
mer Prussian Minister of the Interior, '
attracted much attention.
A company of the Second Foot
Guards constituted a guard of honor.
This regiment had old relations with
I the late Prince, and sent Its band to
serenade him after Blind's attempt on
| his life.
The American Embassador, Andrew
White-, and the Spanish Embassador,
Senor Mendez de Vigo, arrived almost
together and sat side by side. The ab
sence of all well-known adherents of
the Bismarcks was most noted, es
pecially as many of them came up to
Berlin immediately after the death, pre
sumably to confer on the attitude they
would . observe.
Their Majesties took Beats in two arm
chairs in front of the altar. The Em
peror wore the uniform of the Foot
Guards and the Empress was In. simple
mourning attire. The church wae not
filled by those that were invited, so
some of the remaining congregation
obtained admittance. Cm entering Em
peror William shook hands with Prince
Hohenlohe, the Chancellor.
After the singir- of a choral came
"Gott Thut Das Ist Wohlgeban."' and
the hymn, "Jesus Lebt." Dr. Faber
offered an extempore prayer, based on
the 149 th psalm, which he said had once
been commended to Prince Bismarck,
at an important crisis in hi.s life, by an
old friend as a source of comfort and
strength and which the departed had
often quoted. The prayer was a Ger
manic pean of triumph and gratitude
for the achievements of Bismarck and
his contemporaries. One passage ran
thus:
"All â who speak the German tongue
will laud Thee to the most distant days,
and the hearts of their singers will
praise Thee ln ever fresh strains be
cause through him and through all
those loyal, great mpn who stood by the
side of King William \n the perilous
deeds of war and in the noble work of
peace Thou didst show Thy good pleas
ure ln us and didst gloriously help us.
Thou gayest into their hands sharp
swords to execute vengeance among the
nations who set themselves against us
and to bind their kings and nobles with
iron chains and with fetters of the
might of our armies, but afterward
with the gentle bonds of reverence for
true greatness so that they were forced
â¢to do right as it Is written on the tables
of the world's history, to acknowledge
the right of the re-established German
empire and the right of the German
name, once again come to honor. Be
cause all that swells the patriot's
breast with Joyful exultation Is bound
up with the name of Bismarck, we
therefore thank Thee that Thou didst
give him to us."
After the choral. "O, Haupt Voll Blut
und Wunden," as their Majesties left
the church, the organ burst into their
favorite hymn,- and the crowd outside
gave the Emperor and Empress hearty
cheers as they drove away.
FRIEDRICHSRFHE. Aug. 4.â A
magnificent wreath bearing the In
scription "The German Reichstag to
the First Chancellor of the German
Empire" was laid to-day upon the cof
fin of the late Prince Bismarck by a
delegation composed of former Vice-
President Spahn. Dr. Bochem and Herr
Gergheim. Councillor of Accounts.
Prince Herbert Bismarck, Count Wil
liam and the Countess Yon Rantzau,
coming to Frledrichsruhe for this spe
cial purpose, received the delegation
and conducted Its members to. the
death chamber, where the delegation
formally expressed the condolence of
the Reichstag. Prince Herbert on be
half of the family, warmly expressed
gratitude. â

SAN JOSE, Aug. 4.â The Good Gov
ernment Club of Santa Clara County
has issued a letter to its members and
all independent Republicans urging
them to turn out and work at the pri
maries to be held on August 10 in or
der to rid th- party of the influences of
"Boca" Rea and his gang. The letter
1b a. strong arraignment of the methods
of the big boss. Several thousand
copies have been printed and will be
distributed about the county. The club
Is making a viiorous tight for purity
in the Republican party. The letter is
as follows:
A Republican primary election Is to be
held iv each precinct in Banta Clara
County on August 10 for .the selection of
delegates to vie county. Congressional
and State conventions of the Republican
party. The polls will be open trom t>
o'clock a. m. until ti o'clock p. m.
For years the Kepubiican party of thi3
county has been owned and controlled by
a ring. Its hold has gradually tightened
upon us. It has dictated our nominations,
and controlled our otneers after their,
election. We havu been driven as sheep
to the shamble*. As slaves, the Kepubll
can voters vi this county have been
valued only because they could execute
the will or the master. Such a system
bus ut last borne its legitimate fruits.
Our local public affairs have at last come
to such a stale that there Is a Job, if
nothing worse, In nearly everything In
a public way done In the county. Fav
orites and creatures of the ring are re
warded at the expense of the taxpayers.
Merit and faithfulness In the public ser
vants Is little regarded, and loyalty to
the ring and willingness and ability to
execute Its commands have come to be
the chief qualifications of the otllceholder
in Santa Clara County.
Criminals, if they oelong to the ring,
are not only often quietly overlooked,
but it is commonly reporteo. that they are
sometimes protected and assisted to es
cape the just punishment that the law
declares shall be meted out to them. In
nocent people are often persecuted and
sometimes even killed by incompetent and
unprincipled oflk-ers. This ring has tilled
the schools of San Jose with its creatures
and is now reaching out for the schools
of the county. But why continue the dis
gusting recital? Our beautiful county has
become a byword in the . whole State;
our politics are a shame and a disgrace
to every voter in the county.
Shall this state of affairs continue?
This question Is addressed to you per
sonally as much as to any voter In the
county, beÂ»*use upon you. as upon each
Individual votei depends the responsibil
ity of answering. Our State Central Com
mittee has taken a courageous, manly
stand In this matter and has mada it
possible for the Republican voters of
Santa Clara County to free themselves
from this slavery. Let us take the full
est advantage ot this opportunity. Will
you not give a few days â at least one
day â to this work? Patriotism is demand
ed here and now aa much as In the
trenches of Santiago. We beg of you to
come out to the primary and get all your
neighbors who are not owned by the ring
to come out and see to it that independ
ent and fearl-ess men are sent out to our
conventions from your section.
The ticket indorsed by the Good Gov
ernment Club has not been named by any
ring, but has been put forward by the
Independent, anti-ring . Republicans of
your neighborhood. See that, so far aa
you can contribute to that end. It is
elected. Only so can you discharge your
duty to yourself and the community. The
enemy is active, unscrupulous, powerful
and thoroughly Intrenched, and, there
fore, the friends of good government must
be especially active and vigilant.
The primaries on August 10 will be
closel/ watched by members of the
Good Government Club and no loop
hole will be left t: "-ough which the
gang can stuff the ballot boxes.. The
Democratic County Central Committee
also will be on the juert. . Its watchers
will aid the Good Government people
and any Democrat who votes at tho
Republican primary will be barred
from votin- .at his own party's pri
mary. _ .

PBACTICALLY VINDICATED.
Findings in the Suit Against Ex-
County Clerk Boring.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 4.â The fincZngs In
the suit of Santa Clara County against
ex-County Clerk S. W. Boring were
filed to-day and are practically a vin
dication of the charges of defalcation
made against th. . official. The report
finds that there is due the county
from Boring the sum of $39 35. At the
time suit was brought it was declared
Boring was Short over $6500.
Ex-County Boring is a strong
anti-gang man and during his tenure
of office incurred the enmity of Rea
and his followers because he refused
to bow to their t lctates. As soon as
he got out of office they openly charged
him with belr~ a defaulter and using
the public's money. They boasted he
was short from $6000 to $12,000. H. S.
Foote was put in to expert the books
and he claimed to have discovered that
Boring was indebted to the county over
$6500. .

PLANS FOR LAYING
THE PACIFIC CABLE
How It Is Proposed to Connect San
Francisco With Hawaii, the
Philippines, Formosa,
China and Japan.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Hawaii, the Phll
â¢lppines, Formosa, China and Japan are
to be connected with the United States
by cable, if the project of the Pacific
Cable Company meets the approval of
Congress. I understand a company,
which includes such financiers as J.
Pierpont Morgan and J. A. Scrymser,
requested President McKinley to give
authority to land the American end of
the cable at San Francisco. The com
pany was recently granted the right
by the Hawaiian Government to land
its cable at Honolulu and only the con
sent of the American Government is
necessary before it begins the work of
laying the line.
. What action the President will take
upon the company's request Is not
known, but in view of the recent opin
ic-n of the Attorney General declaring
that Congress only had the right o*
landing cables at points within the
jurisdiction of the United States It is
doubtful if it will be approved. The
company is making arrangements for
the introduction of a bill in Congress
immediately after it convenes in De
cember, and no doubt is felt that it will
be passed. The plans of the Pacific
Cable Company are to connect San
Francisco and Manila by a line from
Honolulu. The line will be laid to Apia,
Samoa, and from Manila to Borneo tnd
Australia. The line will also be run
to Formosa and Japan and will touch
at a point in China. It Is also pro
posed to connect the line with the cable
which ramifies through Europe and the
Far East.

TO RECOVER
IMMENSE SUMS
Attorneys Prepare to
Sue the State.
ON OVERPAYMENT OF TAXES
EVERY COUNTY IS INTERESTED
IN THE MATTER.
Overcharge Presumed to Come in Col
lection of Money in Excess of
Requirements for De
linquency.
The Information received from Los An
geies yesterday, to the effect that two
prominent law firms of this district had
proposed to recover for the county a sum
of money which they claim is an overpay
ment to the State, arising from settle
ment of collections of State taxes and
revenues, excited much curiosity here.
An air of mystery has been thrown
about the matter from the start. The
dispatches from the south were to the ef
fect that no mention is made of the
amount involved, nor in what connection
the overpayment was made. The firms
mentioned are Rodgers, Patterson &
Slack of this city, and Devlin & Devlin
of Sacramento. From neither of them
could a direct solution of the matter be
obtained.
'â¢These suits were instituted by Dev
lin & Devlin," said Van R. Paterson,
speaking for his firm yesterday. "They
retained us as their attorneys and with
out the consent of our clients we could
not go into particulars regarding the
suits. We understand that we are to be
made parties to the contracts signed with
the various counties."
?n t o information was to be had from the
Capitol City firm. Robert Devlin is dan
gerously ill, while his brother is away
from home.
The following outline of the matter, in
the prosecution of which the attorneys
agree to bear all expenses of the suit
against, the State for the recovery of
money, upon a contingent fee of 50 per
cent of. all amounts recovered, has been
obtained from a reliable source:
The tax levy for #ach year instructs I
the members of the State Board of Equal- |
izatlon to make a levy sufficient to raise
a designated amount for the general j
fund, school fund, university fund and
interest and sinking funds. In addition
provision is to be made for a certain
percentage for delinquency and cost of
collection. In ISSI. 1883. 1685. 188T and ISB9 !
this was 12 per cent. In 1891 this was cut
down to 9Vs per cent, while in 1898, 1896 and
1597 but B per cent was allowed.
The inference is that this percentage
was greatly in excess of the requirements
for the collection and delinquency, hence
these suits, which will, to all appearances,
be filed In every county in the State.
State Controller Colgan of Sacramento
does not think there is anything in the
contention of the attorneys in the matter
of the State's obligation for uncollected
commission. He said last night:
"Prior to 1593 a commission was allowed
the various counties throughout the State
for the auditing, assessing and collec
tion of State taxes due from the counties
to the State. The law passed in 1893
changed the arrangement and since that ,
time no such commissions have been al
lowed Ido not think that Los Angeles
County has any claim upon the State j
The First Consignment Arrives In the City
Duly Certified.
Herewith Is a fae-slmlle of a certificate received from the Federal au
thorities at Philadelphia as authentic proof that the soil contained in the
casks received is genuine Irish earth shipped from the various counties
of the Emerald Isle for the coming Irish fair at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
It is one of the many proofs that are shown to the skeptic as convincing
proof that the sod is genuine and dug from the various counties to bo rep
resented at the fair.
The. long-expected sod arrived yesterday afternoon and will be hauled
from the ferry to its final destination next Saturday evening. The purpose
of procuring the soil is to make a topographical map of Ireland to be lo
cated in the west end of the balcony as a sort of a Mecca for true-hearted
Irishmen and all those who are desirous of honoring Ireland's soil. As the
sod is supposed to be from the various counties in Ireland any Irishman
hailing from any of the thirty-two counties of the Emerald Isle will be
privileged to tread upon his native soil and dream of happy days by the
Lakes of Klllarney of on the streets of old Dublin. The soil came shipped
in fifteen huge casks, containing about eight hundred pounds to the cask,
and forms the first consignment of several which will be received in a few
days by the members of the Celtic Union and Irish societies.
Architects are busily engaged in preparing the inclosure at the Pavilion
for the reception of the precious earth next Saturday evening. Commit
tees have been appointed to arrange a parade in honor of the arrival of
the sod and have decided to have the place of formation in front of the
Occidental Hotel. Between twenty and thirty carriages will be provided
for those who will have charge of moving the casks from the terry to the
Pavilion and every effort made in making the event a memorable one
among the Irish population of the city. Representatives from the various
Irish societies in the city will participate in the parade. The line of march
will extend from the place of formation at Market and Sutler streets, up
Sutter to Kearny, down Kearny to Market, along Market to Hayes, and
thence direct to the entrance to the Pavilion. Several floats with fire
works, including rod, white and green fire, will precede the parade. A
number of the Irish merchants along the line of march have promised to
decorate and illuminate the fronts of their establishments, particularly Hale
Bros, and the firm of j. J. O'Brien & Co.
THE SAN FIIAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 5, 1898.
for any commissions uncollected prior to
1593. It is improbable that the Audit
ors of that county would fail to hold from
their remittances to the State the com
missions due.
"It has been my experience that the
various Auditors throughout the State
have in no manner overlooked anything
that might by right belong to their re
spective counties. It is Improbable that
Los Angeles County has been overlooked.
Of course, I do not know what the con
tention of the attorneys that be, but I
do not believe there exists a right of ac
tion against the State, and shall strenu
ously resist one should it be commenced.
Mr. Colgan said he knew of no other
obligation that might arise from any
source in the course of financial transac
tions between the counties and the State.
Some years ago the firm of Devlin &
Devlin "made a collection from the State
in favor of Sacramento County, but State
Controller Colgan maintains that the
claim was made by reason of there being
an amount actually due the county for
collections made for the State prior to
the passage of the law of 1593. The stat
ute referred to by Controller Colgan is
chapter VIII of the Statutes of 1893, and
reads as follows:
Section Iâ All commission or fees raid by the
Stntp to the r.fflcere of any county or city and
county for services rendered In the assessment,
equalization, auditing and collection of ad va
lorem taxes are hereby abolished.
The employment of Rodgers, Paterson
& Slack by the Sacramento firm indicates
the importance they attach to the suits
which they have instituted.
LEES IS STRIPPED
OF ALL THE GLORY
WEBER MURDER REWARD CASE
IS FINALLY DECIDED.
Wladislau Zakrewskei Meets Defeat
but Gets the Fame the Chief
Tried to Appropri
ate.
Wladislau Zakrowskei has been denied
the reward offered for the apprehension
of the murderer of the Webers, Ivan
Kovalev. Zakrewskei piloted the police
officers to the room occupied by Kovalev
and was, in consequence. Instrumental In
his arrest. He secured the confession of
the murderer, accumulated other evidence
against him, went on the stand in Sacra
mento, and through his testimony Kova
lov went to the gallows. Isaiah Lees,
Chief of the police force of this
city, tried at the timo to patch up his
fame and incidentally fill his purse. He
applied for the reward, but his ambition j
and greed were jarred by the decision of j
the Supreme Court, which held that he
was not entitled to pecuniary gain or
glory.
Then Zakrewskei brought suit for the
reward. Each day saw Lees beside the
State Attorney in court, his willing ally.
Lees saw his fame vanishing away, and \
took strenuous efforts to prevent the
claimant from recovering, and with par- i
tial success. In the decision handed down
by Judge Hunt yesterday, the court held
that although the claimant had greatly
aided in the apprehension of the mur
derer and his testimony as to the confes
sion made by Kovalev had much to do i
with the latt'"*s conviction, the circum- i
stances would not justify his recovery of
the reward. Other circumstances Lees j
put before the court showed that import- i
ant bits of evidence were added by other I
parties, and thereby Zakrewskei was de- I
feated. Loop, however, overreached him- j
self and by Judge Hunt's decision he has
been stripped of all the glory. The de
cision made no mention of the part played :
by Lees. The court did not wish to hurt
the old man's feelings, so refrained. But
others were credited with the capture and
conviction of the murderer, which to Lees j
is as galling as though his inefficiency
had been commented upon.

PASSING OF
BYRON C. HOLLY
A Sketch of the Noted
Horseman.
HORSE ITEMS FROM HAWAII
RUMORED CHANGE OF TRAIN
ERS IN THE B. & W. STABLE.
Small Fields of Gallopers at Sara
toga â Danny Maher and "fa
ther Bill's" School of
Riding.
When Byron C. Holly passed away sud
denly at Butte, Mont., late Wednesday
night one of the most famous figures of
the American turf was no more.
"By" Holly was known on every race
track from San Francisco to New York,
for he had campaigned both runners aid
trotters within that territory, and 1Â»1
won races galore with them during a
career as trainer and owner that began
along about 1870 in Michigan. Mr. Holly
came to Colorado about 1875 and had
horses of all kinds in partnership with
Jim Carlile, a well known politician of the
State of Teller and Tabor. They also bred
horses at Pueblo, and had a lease for a
time on Hickory Jim, who raced until he
was twenty-one years old. Among the an
' imals Mr. Holly brought out to California
in the early eighties was Fusillade's Last,
the mother of Fly, Montallade and Hor
ton. He campaigned Ninena, Irish Lass,
Sid and other gallopers with considerable
success in the eightk-s, and drove trot
ters on the California and Montana cir
cuits as well. It was Holly that condi- i
tioned and developed the trotting stallion I
Woodnut until he was considered to be
worth $20,000 by Robert Steele of Phila
j delphia, who paid that sum to the clever
horseman for the son of Nutwood. This
sale and the money he won at Sacra
mento on the horse, said to be $25,000, put
"By" on his financial feet, and he after- |
ward acquired and fitted for track work j
! such celebrities as Revolver, Happy Day, |
j Sympathetic's Last and El Rayo, and |
; made a great deal of money with them.
For ten years or more this turfman,
| who was of gypsy origin, had resided on
a fine ranch at Flosden, just a few milts
from Vallejo, Cal., and here he raised
his own trotters and runners, among them
many that by their racing ability made
the veteran horseman better known than
i ever. He owned for years Rosette (the
' dam of Acclaim, Royal Flush, Rosie P.,
i Francesca and others that won good
; races). Fusillade's Last (dam of Fly,
Montallade and Hortonj and Ninena 01am
of Sidney and others). Horton, a crack
erjack two-year-old, is by his good El
Rayo from the mare he loved so well,
Fusillade's Last.
There was a good deal of sentiment
! about B. C. Holly, and no man loved a
good joke better than he. The Flosden |
â¢ turfman owned a select string at the I
; time of his death, including Horton, Tor- 1
slon, Charlotte M and imp. Devil's j
Dream, and with Lucky Star he had made
a considerable sum this season at Denver
and Butte. However, horsemen got to
running the latter up in selling races, and
he let him go one day, not long ago, a
Montana turfman securing the fast son
of imp. Friar Tuck.
Four years ago the old turfman could
have written his chock for over $100,ODO
and had it honored, but he had met with â¢
several reversrs since that time, and his |
speculations had not always turned out !
well, so that it is doubtful if he died I
worth much over a quarter of the sum i
mentioned.
Mr. Holly, who waa 56 years of ag>\
leaves a widow and young lady daughter
to mourn his loss, and he was as kind as |
a father to Joe Narvaez, W; Clancy, Bert
Hart and Tod Sloan, alt of whom owed
their success as riders, at least in part,
to the knowledge "Old Man" Holly had
of the art, and to his ability to impart
that knowledge. It was Messrs. Holly
and J. H. Shields who grave Tod Sloan
his first real opportunity as a horse pilot, j
That the swarthy, intelligent face of this
acknowledged prince of traintrs will
be greatly missed wherever the Flosden
turiman was known and that his memory
will be cherished by a host of horeemon
and racepoers throughout a broad ex
panse of this American country goes
without saying.
Harry Agnew of Santa Clara County is
back from a business trip to the Ha
waiian Islands. While in kanakaland he
sold Loupe, the fast pacer by John Seven
Oaks, for $750. When Agnew disposes of
his stock farm near San Jose he will re
turn to the islands, and there take up
his permanent residence. He says that
Venus, the Verano mare purchased for
$100 by Mr. Cornwall of that country, is
considered the fastest mare ever brought
down there. She won everything she
went after. Venus once belonged to Dow
Williams, ruled off the turf some years
ago, together with Jerry Chorn, Cheva
lier and "Little Pete."
The Mallard,, the big Fellowcharm horse
that ran sev#ral races ovor Buy District
course three or four years ago. is siring
some very handsome colts on the island
of Maul, and is held in high estwrn.
The fit-Ids are uniformly small at Sara
toga. We noticed one day three races
where there but throe starters, another
race with four entries, another with six
âthe latter the best race of the after-
noon.
There is a strong rumor In turf cir
cles that Jimmy MeCormlck (for the past
three seasons with Burns & Watcrhouse
as chief trainer) will shortly sever his
connection with the big racing stable-
In fact, it Is declared he will not accom
pany the string to this coast from the
East next October. If this comes about
it is more than likr-iy Ben Timmons will
be McCormick's successor. He has been
with Burns & Waterhou.se about as lone:
as McCormick, is a veteran at the busi
ness and. a very capable man. For years
he handled gallopers for J. B. Haggin.
Timmons is handling about twenty two
year-olds now of the B. &. W. stable at
Oakland track. McCormick. who was a
Jockey in his younger days, is quite
wealthy and, it is said, prefers to live
in or around New Tork City, where ha
has spent most of his life. He has been
in receipt of the salary of a Congress
man since ho has been with Burns & Wa
terhouse, a-nd just what he will do if he
leaves is not known at present. The Cal
ifornia firm has had as high as sixty
nine horses in active training at one time
and the string had to earn about $W.OOO
per annum to meet stable expenses.
While it has won what looked like a large
sum to persons that did not stop to con
sider the enormous outlay, it is doubtful
if the horses have been a paying invest
ment for the owners of the Candelaria
Manor rode tho first five winners at
Brighton Beach yesterday and was third
in the sixth race. He is pressing the
older idol. Tod Sloan, very close for the
riding championship. Maher is a pupil
of "Father Bill" Daly, from whose school
graduated Jimmy Mclaughlin, "Snapper"
Garrison, Lamlc, Kcefe and many other
shining lights of the pigskin firmament.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC
BUYS WAR STAMPS
ABOUT $3500 EXPENDED DUR
ING THE MONTH OF JULY.
Between 'x'wo and Three Hundred
Thousand One-Cent Stamps
Are Used Monthly for Re
ceipts of Packages.
It Is Just a month since the war revenue
has been in effect and the large carrying
corporations are beginning to compute the
amount of money expended for the month
of July. The Southern Pacific has not yet
prepared a detailed and itemized bill of
expenditures for the use of war stamps,
but an average has been made by Treas
urer Captain Smith.
â¢'I think the amount expended by the
company." ho said yesterday, "will Teach
tit least"s3soo a month. This doer, not seem
much when considered as a monthly ex
pense, but when you figure it up for the
year it amounts to $42,000. Until I hoar
from the outside agentsâ about 4f>o in
numberâ l shall not be able to ascertain
definitely or accurately what money was
expended for the use of revenue stamps
during the month of July. The great bulk
of this now but necessitous expense lies
in the use of the 1-cent stamp, of which
the company buys between 200,000 and 300,
000 a month. On an average the company
purchases $2500 worth of these stamps.
The 2-cent stamp for drafts and checks
will not add up to any such amount. Com
paratively few of the 5, 10 or 20 cent
â¢tamps are used.
"The reason that so many 1-cent stamps
are used is that every package which is
handled by us must have affixed to it
stamps of this denomination. The com
pany is willinp to lifar the burden of this
new tax, for in few cases are the ship
ments so small as- to materially decrease
the net profit of the shipment."
Preparing for Election Day.
The Board of Election Commissioners
met yesterday morning and authorized the
Registrar to post notices in all of the pre
cinct registration places inviting citizens
to make complaint agamst the misconduct
r incompetency of registration offlcer3.
The board also decided to offer a reward
of $500 to be paid by the county for the ar
rest and conviction of any person violat
ing the registration or election laws.
The commissioners will meet every day j
until after registration closes to listen to I

REPAYING MARKET STREET.
SINCE the Supervisors Have determined to re
pave Market street between Second and Sixth
with bituminous rock, it is to be hoped they
will introduce at least a few business principles into
the work. If as soon as the space between the "rib
bon"' already laid and the cable tracks is repaved it is
proposed to grant a franchise to another car company
to run down the highway, we respectfully suggest that
the francliise be granted and the track built prior to
the work now proposed being done.
We recall the fact that a few years ago Eddy street,
between Mason and Taylor, having risen to the dig
nity of a mudhole in winter and a sand pestilence in
summer, was paved with bituminous rock at an ex
. pense of $9000. The block was hardly dry ere the
Metropolitan Electric Company obtained a franchise
on Eddy street and proceeded to tear it up from end
to end. When the double track of this line had been
finished the beautiful pavement looked asÂ« though it
had been struck by a Kansas tornado. Substantially
the same thing happened on Stockton street between
Market and O"Farrell. The business men on this
.block suffered from unused car tracks, cobbles and
.dirt tor many years. Finally the city paved the block
with bitumen at an expense of about $5000. â  The
day after the work was done it occurred to the
Spring Valley Water Wojks that it needed a pipe in
the block, and the vandals of that corporation dug a
â  hole through it in short order.
If anything of this character needs to be done upon
Market street between Second and Sixth the time to
do it is before the pavement now projected by the
Supervisors is laid. At the very best the bitumen will
. be frequently torn up; it will be impossible to stay
the hands of the side sewer vandals and the building
â¢ operations of enterprising citizens. But the water,
â¢ gas and telephone companies can at least be com
pelled to put their pipes and conduits in order for a
long season of repose.
If something of this sort is not done, not only will
a great deal of money be wasted, but the street will
-.'â¢â¢ be maintained in a constant state of impassability.
Every time a bituminous pavement is torn up a per
: nianent scar is made which gradually develops into
â¢ a "chuck hole." As the city has no facilities for re
pairing "chuck holes," the first resort of the Street
Department is to fill them with macadam. This has
been done on Third street, which is now in a worse
condition than it was before the basalt blocks were
removed
If Market street is going to meet the fate that has
overtaken the streets we have named, it had better be
restored to the control of the street car monopoly
. arjd allowed to continue its revel with cobbles, ba
salt blocks, carbolized wood and asphalt. A great
improvement in the appearance and usefulness of the
magnificent thoroughfare can be made by introduc
ing into the work now in progress a little sense and
reason. The introduction of these things may shock
the politicians at the City Hall, but they ought to
stand it in the public interest.
ONE UNCONQUERABLE FOE.
AS to the necessity for hurrying Shafter's army
out of Cuba there can be no question. The
opinion among medical men is unanimous that
if . retained there the men must perish by thousands,
for the yellow fever cannot by any application of.
â¢science be much longer kept in abeyance. In case
of an outbreak it would find the troops weakened by
malaria and less deadly maladies, so that they would
be swept away. by thousands. There is no call for
such sacrifice.
One of the strongest statements of the conditions
prevailing there comes from "Colonel Roosevelt.
That he is a brave man he has proved. That he is a
patriotic and level-headed citizen was known before
Â° he led the Rough Riders on their splendid dash
toward Santiago. Yet Roosevelt is anxious to have
. the army moved to the north. He points out the
awful rcsutts of delay and the futility of condemning
soldiers to the devastation of the scourge. As he
makes clear, the men would not repine if by remain-
Ing at whatever risk they would accomplish aught
for their country. But for the time their work has
. been done, and done in a manner which was a glory
' to the land. Now let them be granted a haven of
: safety, a chance for life.
Even with peace seemingly assured the death list
has been long enough to carry sorrow to homes in
every State of the Union. There should not be
added to it uselessly another name.
. â¢ Just as Garcia is reported as having retired in dis
gust comes the news that he has met and defeated a
wing of the Sp nish forces. He appears to be about
â¢ as uncertain a quantity as several others which enter
into the composition of the situation.
â¢ The prospects that Americans may have to fight the
rebels in the Philippines ought to be more distressing
to the rebels than to anybody else.
A WOODPECKER CAMPAIGN.
POLITICAL contests begin much earlier in the
Eastern States than on this coast, and as a con
sequence the classification and naming of new
political features as they appear in each succeeding
campaign devolve upon the experts of that region.
In the contest that is now approaching the most
notable feature is the determination of the Demo
crats to make the fight on State issues only. This is
such a novelty in our politics that it requires a name
of its own to avoid confusion, and accordingly the
Eastern authorities on political nomenclature have
by general consent agreed to call it a "woodpecker"
campaign.
The name will be perplexing to some. It is but a
short time ago that Democracy was flitting about the
country as a cuckoo, answering to that call very
readily, and its appearance this year as a woodpecker
it must be admitted is somewhat surprising. In fact
there is no telling to what extent these rapid variety
changes may go. The old Democratic bird that be
gan its career as a game rooster may yet wind up as
a pewee.
Surprising as the name may be, however, it has not
been inaptly chosen, as any one may learn who
chooses to make a study of woodpeckers in relation
to Democrats. The Century Dictionary tells us
there are 250 species of woodpeckers, and it is well
known there are just that many kinds of Democratic
factions. If this be not sufficient proof that the two
creatures are birds of a feather, all doubts will be re
moved by the further statement of the dictionary
that the woodpecker is a scansorial, saurognathus,
sagittalingual pecarian; that the tongue is capable
of being thrust far out of the mouth and is lumbrici
form.
With these facts before us and with the campaign
rapidly approaching in our beloved State it is clearly
the duty of intelligent patriots to study woodpeckers.
Of the many species of the bird there are some of
special interest to us by reason of their numbers on
this coast and the part they are likely to play in the
contest. The most common of these is the Califor
nian woodpecker, Melanorpes formicivorus, de
scribed in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the most
provident bird in the woods, but withal so senseless
that he cannot distinguish an acorn from a pebble,
being about as apt to pick up the one as the other
on his foraging expeditions. This is the kind of a
woodpecker that in a political flurry would pick up
such a hard old Populist pebble as Maguire and
think it good stuff. '
Another local species deserving attention is the
hairy woodpecker, Picus dendrocopus villosus, a
rural creature of the Ah'ord type, hard to be dis
tinguished from a jay, and also incapable of knowing
a pebble from an acorn until after swallowing it.
Next come the yellow-bellied woodpeckers, com
monly known as sapsuckers, but recognized among
politicians as papsuckers. These yellow fellows are
exemplified in the McNab specimen and generally
pest with the Hearstlings.
We may pass the gilded woodpecker, a species of
gold bug votary who will not be conspicuous in the
campaign, but we cannot ignore the bristle-bellied
woodpecker of the genus asyndesmus. Many people
who have never heard of a woodpecker with bristles
will be inclined to doubt the existence of this species.
If such people, however, will only look around they
will perceive a good many of the bristling kind. As
a matter of fact, in some instances, as in that of the
Harney bird, the bristles just now are even more
conspicuous than the feathers, and the species is at
tested mainly by the sagittalingual tongue.
With such a variety of the game in sight, California
ought to make something like a picnic out of the
woodpecker campaign. It remains to be said only
that in this State there is no close season for wood
peckers. Anybody may take a pot shot at them at
any time.
FLINCHED UNDER FIRE.
WHILE there seem to be grounds for the belief
that the Seventy-first New York was tem
porarily panic-stricken before Santiago, the
men should not be too harshly condemned. As sol
diers they were entirely raw. The great majority
knew nothing more of war and its weapons than had
been learned in peaceful parades and picnic encamp
ments. They were facing a fearful fire coming from
an invisible foe. At first there were no trained troops
to set an example. These civilians, suddenly trans
formed into a fighting force, were at the front. If
for a time they gave way to the impulse of fear, they
seem to have redeemed themselves.
Any student of history knows that in battle there
are conditions under which even veterans quail. To
advance against a storm of bullets, not knowing the
strength of the enemy, not certain that there are re
inforcements at hand, is a terrible ordeal. Moreover,
a panic is an unaccountable phenomenon. Let it
once get started, whether from a tangible cause or a
mere prompting of timidity, and it spreads like a
flame in the dry grass. People who have not the
vaguest idea what they are scared about join in the
rout.
To such experiences as these soldiers are particu
larly subject. Cowardice is an infection, and one
faltering poltroon may spread dismay in every direc
tion.
WHAT GOES WITH THE FLAG.
IN a recent interview Mr. Hitt, one of the two Il
linois members of the Hawaiian Commission,
talked interestingly of the effect of our flag upon
the prosperity of the territory over which it floats.
He instanced General Grant's attempt to annex San
Domingo. During that effort Mr. Hitt visited San
Domingo and says that he found there representa
tives of American syndicates negotiating for fran
chises and privileges which covered the resources
and capacities of the country, but which were all taken
contingent upon annexation to the United States.
He transfers this condition to our possession of
Hawaii and, prospectively, to the countries and colo
nies we may take from Spain, and quotes it to show
what goes with our flag.
To a cool observer this seems to imply that the
transfer of the flag to more territory does not mean
an enlargement of the individual opportunities, but
opens a new field for the rapacity of combined cap
ital, made secure in its gains by franchises and privi
leges. There is no talk of an opening for individual
enterprise, of a field for hundreds of thousands of
American laborers in which to better their state and
advance more rapidly to independence. The lure is
to hundreds of millions of American dollars, with a
chance to increase their profits entrenched behind
privilege.
It must be confessed that this is not what the flag
always stood for. During more than a hundred years
it was an invitation to the man and not the dollar.
Men responded, and, flocking here from Northern
Europe, they brought thrift and industry, a fresh
stream to mingle with our original blood, and a de
votion to the principles of our government which
produced the enlarged opportunity for betterment of.
THE SAIN" FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 5, 1898.
the fortunes of the individual. Men feel emotions,
they thrill to patriotism, they bring to institutions
that enduring love of country which is necessary in
peace and war. To the accumulation of wealth there
is no objection, if it be not accompanied by the with
drawal of individual opportunity.
To say that special franchises and privileges go
with the flag is to emphasize a new era in our na
tional development, which may have to come in the
history of all nations, but that nation is the happiest
in which its coming is the longest delayed.
It has an evil sound when uttered in connection
with the annexation of Hawaii. The chief end of our
form of government has been supposed to be the
prosperity and happiness of the people brought under
its influence, and their encouragement by the full
protection given to the rights of person and prop
erty. But as man is the producer of wealth, by con
version thereinto of natural resources, his interests
as an individual can never be safely forgotten. That
they are in danger of being forgotten when wealth,
and not its producer, becomes the first object of
governmental care, seems to be true.
We fear that Mr. Hitt's idea of the advantages of
annexation and expansion sounds a note of alarm.
PROVOKED BY fl LIAR,
THERE are occasions which call for plain lan
guage and acts which must in honesty be de
nounced as knavish and cowardly. There are
liars who to th# sin of falsehood add the crime of in
gratitude and the despicable quality of cowardice.
Such an occasion was the appearance in the Kansas
City Times of an article, unsigned, traducing San
Francisco, and such an act was that of the nameless
and shameless poltroon who wrote it.
In this San Francisco is denounced as a modern
Sodom and Gomorrah, its citizens held up to ridicule,
and its ready and lavish hospitality maligned in such
terms as a blackguard may command.
There is an intimation throughout the missive that
it is the work of a member of the Kansas regiment.
If so that regiment, which by its deportment here has
made friends, about whose pitiful state of unprepared
ness upon arrival there was a storm of indignation,
whose incompetent Governor was denounced for
having sent his men unclad and unarmed, for whom
the Red Cross provided food and clothing, that regi
ment contains one man who is a sneak, who would
bite the hand extended to greet him. who would
thrust a knife into the back of a benefactor and who
in camp or in distant lands will be a disgrace to the
soldiers with whom he associates.
The letter enlarges upon the wickedness of the city.
All great centers of population have their evil spots.
San Francisco has its share. But the soldiers have
been warned concerning them. They have been
begged to stay away. The papers have solicited them
to avoid excesses; their officers have given them or
ders, but all in vain. In any city they would have had
a similar experience. The police have befriended
them, piloting them from dangerous quarters and re
fusing to arrest them unless offenses were too flag
rant to be overlooked. Perhaps the writer of the ar
ticle in question is suffering from the indiscretion of
not heeding well-meant counsel. Yet San Francisco
is accustomed to the libel of being called wicked, and
will pass this by. One street is described as being
like a lane through Hades. While the accuracy of
the description must remain in doubt, common sense
would suggest that a street of this character be
avoided.
But there are specific libels. "California regiments
then stationed here were made up of the worst class
of south of Market hoodlums," continues this measure
less liar, and he tells about the "sallow-faced" Cali
fornians who were raised with a "hop can" and
"fairy lamp" at their side. He adds that there is no
law here against opium-smoking. While the futility
of replying to one who is so completely vicious, so
absolutely dead to the sense of decency, in fact such
a fool, is apparent so far as touching his intellectual
Â»*oid and his absent conscience is concerned, there
are people at a distance whom he might mislead.
The Californians who have gone to the front consti
tute a regiment made up of the best blood of the
West, fine, manly, patriotic, a thousand strong; they
went with the tears and blessings of people who
loved them and took pride in them. No better regi
ment serves under the flag we honor. But this mis
erable scoundrel must traduce them, slander them, try
to give out the impression that these big, brave boys
are opium fiends! Was there ever affront more con
temptible? The fellow deserves to be whipped from
the army as a snarling and rabid cur.
His crowning insult is to the hospital^ which has
been lavished on every soldier. He says it was all
for the Native Sons of the Golden West. The whelp
lies again knowingly and maliciously. It cannot have
escaped him that in jhis hospitality there has been
no distinction. The First California Regiment was
early removed from the scene. Then came other
regiments, from lowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Penn
sylvania, Kansas, Montana, the Dakotas, Utah, Ore
gon, Washington, Tennessee, Wyoming; at inter
vals there would be additions to the regular army.
All of these were greeted with equal fervor, all made
welcome, all fed. They were all "our boys" and the
common heart went out to them. Some were poorly
equipped, ragged, unarmed. For such there was a
particular manifestation of regard. Money was poured
out freely. Women gave their time to providing
necessities which the Government had been slow to
furnish. Thousands of dollars were freely contrib
uted and spent for blankets, shoes, delicacies. The
badge of the Red Cross became a badge of honor,
and none was too proud to wear it. There had been
official neglect, or at least tardiness, and every effort
was made to remedy this. For the hardships the boys
suffered at the hands of unscrupulous contractors the
greatest indignation was among the people of San
Francisco, and the outcry they raised was the means
of bringing the rascals to time. When a camp site
was selected where the cold winds brought in the
fogs it was the people who protested and caused re
moval to a more healthful spot. From all over the
country came messages of gratitude for the atten
tions bestowed on brothers and sons.
This Kansas mongrel struck the first discordant
note. Does he know that a humble employe of this
paper, happening to hail from Kansas, started a sub
scription among fellow workmen and presented, to
the Kansas regiment an expensive set of surgical
instruments? Or, knowing it, is he a cur too yellow
to appreciate? The gift was never acknowledged,
but no matter. When the men of the regiment learn
of it they will be grateful. It is not the stray, yelping
canine from which thanks are to be expected.
San Francisco is glad to have the Kansas regiment
here. It has the fullest sympathy with the ambition,
to sail for the field of action. When the regiment de
parts it will be given a farewell and a hearty god
speed, for with all our faults we are not so small as
to judge the men of Kansas, the loyal, young citi
zens, by the one debased and scurrilous scoundrel
who has invaded their ranks.
It is as we suspected. When Aguinaldo's head had
a $25,000 price set upon it it began to swell.

LIEUTTNANT
TO COLONEL
IN A DAY.
"Just after we left Ogden a sergeant
In one of the companies came up to me
and with a more than ordinary respect
ful salute begged me to allow him to get
off at the next station and fill his can
teen, as he was feeling ill and needed
fortifying of both spirit and the body.
He seemed to be the personification of
honesty, and I granted him permission
to do as he deaired.
"The next station was passed and he
appeared again. "Well, sergeant, what is
wrong now?' I asked. 'If you please,
captain, I am a very sick man, and I
need some more medicine,' he replied.
Of course, I told him that at the next
station he might refill his canteen, but
advised him not to take too much.
Hardly had I settled myself for a com
fortable sleep on the seats, after passing
the- second stop on the route, when Mr.
Sergeant appears again. This time it was:
'Major, 1 am feeling worse and worse;
wouldn't you please let me till this tin
again at the next station?' Hoping that
the next canteen would prove disabling,
I told him It was all right. The next
station was reached and passed, and
there stood the gentleman with bibulous in
clinations, pleading just one more favor.
'Now, colonel, I need ' this medicine
badly. Let me off at the next sta-shun
anil be your fren fer- llfâ sure.'
"I had to htop his medicine taking for
my own protection. If I had allowed that
man to continue lon the same tack I
would have been on the retired list long
before I reached San Francisco."

HISTOBIC VALLEY FOBGE.
To many of those who celebrated Evac
uation day at Valley Forge the visit was
a revelation. For the first time they re
alized the extent of that historic winter
encampment and saw for themselves that
what has been acquired by the State for
the purpose of restoration is but a small
portion of the territory occupied by
"Washington and his troops during the
memorable winter and that if any proper
restoration is to take place the remain-
Ing territory covered by the encampment
must be acquired. Some half-fllled earth
works still exist and the remnants of a
system of defensive fortifications are
still visited, but very little remains to fur
nish e\fc?n an outline of the Valley Forge
encampment in its entirety. With the
maps and descriptions still available a
restoration could be effected, and the
sooner the land Is acquired and the work
undertaken the better. AVhile no battle
was fought at Valley Forge, it was In
this historic camp that the revolutionary
soldiers were transformed by discipline I
from raw. untrained militia to the well
drilled, heroic army that compelled the I
evacuation of a score of field's in the
South and triumphed grandly at York
town. Schooled in the hardships and pri
vation of winter camp these heroic men I
here acquired the patience, discipline, en- |
durance and unconquerable love of liber- j
ty that made them invincible on the fu
ture battlefields of the revolution.âPhil

With th* tropic grasses bending over,
Wherf? the royal palm, all undenied.
Shall be their constant lover:
There, on the hillside over the bay.
Over the beautiful Cuban valley,
Tenderly, tenderly lay them awayâ
Where they won their last fierce rally!
Oh, the desperate charge they made â
The Hag of the Stars and Stripes before
themâ
And never a heart of these hearts afraid
To strike for the land that bore them!
Peace!â the chaplain is calling their names,
â peace to the ashes and dust returning:
But earth cannot cover the light of their fames
Or darken the glow of Its burning!
Cowboy, clerk and packer are hereâ
Fortune's favorite, dauntless and true, â
One, in their scorn of a ciÂ»wnrd fear,
One, in their love for the Blue!
Northland. Southland. East and West-
Northland, Southlandâ never again!
\J*est and East in a love confessed
Over these voiceless men!
Chaplain, call us again the rolls!
For earth hath never a melody
As sweet as the names of the hero soula
That strive to make men free!
Leave not one from the shining list â
Kach is something transfigured now;
Over our eyes sweeps a holy mist,
A shadow is on each brow!
But "God will give" in the days to come;
God will give as ever He gives;
After the roar nf musket and drum
He knows. He cares, He lives'.
And these our mother is taking to sleep
In her deepest breast, by the Cuban bay,

ings that, like "Virtue brings its own re

good and you will be happy" cannot be
traced to origin. In 1866 the question asked
by this correspondent was asked by some
one in the East and, being: taken up by
the newspapers, attracted attention
wherever the English language was spok
en. A search for the origin of the phrase
was made in the old and new world, and
everybody gave it up. but a bright wag
of the time announced that he had dis
covered the origin, and in proof of his as
sertion quoted the followlnK. f whlch.- he
said, was taken from the ballad â¢Jolly

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 5, 1898.
FURLOUGHS FOR THE SICK.
Modified Order Transmitted by wire From
Washington to General Merriam.
ADJUTANT GENERAL CORBIN'S order granting thirty days' fur
lough to convalescent soldiers has, of necessity, been greatly restrict
ed. The original order gave power to grant furloughs to regimental
and detachment surgeons and commanders, and it was apparent to
every one that one of the largest effects of the order would be a big in
crease in the sick list.
With this result in view, further instructions were asked of General
Merriam. and yesterday he received a telegram from Washington, which
is incorporated in the following circular:
HEADQUARTERS INDEPENDENT DIVISION, EIGHTH ARMY CORPS, CAMP
MERRITT, SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., August 4, 1898.
The telegram from the Adjutant General. U. 8. A., of the Ist inst., relative to
granting lurloughs by surgeons in charge of hospitals. Is limited in its application
to the surgeon In charge of the Division Field Hospital.
Sick in regimental or other hospitals to whom furloughs should be gTanted

entirely obliterated, while only seven

effect that mail for Honolulu by the

numbers of the board, has been attached
to the field hospital, and his place has
been rilled by Dr. Huffman of the Twen
tieth Kansas.

timates placed the figure at about three
to the company; later developments Bhow
an increase to seven or eight to the com-
pany. â¢

ILL AT CAMP BARRETT.
First Case 01 o^rious Sickness
Reported in tho Eighth
California.
CAMP BARRETT. Bather Tract, Aug.
.4.â The first case of what Is regarded as
serious. sickness " was reported to-day at
the headquarters of the hospital corps,
and the patient, Private Frank Bush, of
Company F of Oakland, was immediately
removed to Fabioia Hospital. He was
first taken, sick a week or so ago, suffer
ing from a severe cold. The last four
days, however, his temperature ran ex
ceedingly high, and strong symptoms of
typhoid-pneumonia â¢ were manifested to
day; hence his removal.
The quartermaster's department was
kept busy to-day on account of the ar
rival of a large shipment of shoes, uni
forms, blouses and trousers, blanket bogs,
for marching and complete equipment of
shelter tents for the entire regiment.
Colonel Henshaw has ordered all supplies
.to be equally distributed among the vari
ous companies. The regiment is being
conducted on as. practically a military
basis as possible. The proposition is be
ing reached of having the regiment look
first-class and yet carry no surplus. The
regiment '* is : now equipped with every
practical necessity, and is in a position
to be ordered to the front at any moment.
Much has been accomplished in a short
space of time, although the Eighth has
not yet been attached to any brigade.

PREFERRED
DEATH TO
SEPARATION
Mrs. Van Ness Tries
to End Her Life.
VICTIM OF DISCARDED LOVE
HANDSOME LIEUTENANT WHO
PROVED ADAMANT.
Dr. Rodgers Removes the Bullet and
Gives Hope for Her Hecovery. .
Strict Secrecy Was
Enjoined.
A pistol shot startled the inmates of a
lodging-house on Post street, near Grant
avenue, last night. The smell of powder
issued from an open transom and the
braver inmates of the house forced open
the door and found a handsome young
woman, a Mrs. Van Ness, stretched out
on the carpet with a revolver at her
side.
A messenger was hastily dispatched for
a physician, and with the moans and in
articulate cries for the man she loved the
attempted suicide lapsed into uncon
sciousness.
On the arrival of Doctor Rodgers she
revived and pointed to an ugly wound in
her arm. The physician administered an
anesthetic, and after a. great deal of
probing dislodged a thirty-two caliber
bullet.
When Mrs. Van Xess recovered con
sciousness she continued to moan and
bee to be allowed to die. The perfidy of
a heartless man was the reason for her
act. She would first pray to see the man
*he loved and then hurl anathemas upon
his head for forsaking her.
Every effort was made to hush up the
affair by the friends of the hysterical
woman. It appears that Mrs. Van NfiU,
who is a very intelligent and well trav
eled woman, arrived in this city about
a month ago, bringing 1 with her trunks
filled with the fruits of her extensive
travel. She took the finest apartment In
the apartment hou^e and engaging a
colored maid set up housekeeping. Her
rooms were decorated with beautiful Jap
anese and Indian curios and furnished
in a manner befitting a woman of re
fined taste and one used to luxury. She
dressed in the height of fashion and at
tracted great attention by her appear
ance. Among her few visitors was a
handsome young lieutenant who arrived
from the Eaut a short time ago with his
regiment, which is now encamped at the
Presidio. He Wftfl often ycon in her com
pany and everything pointed to tho fact
that a b'>nd of afffx-tion existed between
them. She often accomiianled him to
dinner and places of amusement until a
slight quarrel estranged them. His visits
ceased entirely and the charming woman
began to show signs of his absence. She
no longer dressed in bright colors and
seldom left her apartments. Last night
she learned that he wan about to leave
for Manila on one of the outgoing trans
ports, and feeling that she had nothing
more to live for tried to end her exist
ence.
She sent her maid out on a frivolous
errand and. taking a pearl-handled re
volver from her bureau, pointer! it at her-
Mlf and fired. Luckily she was nervous
and left-handed, and the hall passed
through her right breast and lodg-ed in
her arm.
Although the wound If painful Dr. Rod
prrs believes she will recover.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â was obvious from
the developments in to-day's stock market that
wealthy and powerful speculators were plac
ing very large amounts of money in the granger
stocks in anticipation of a rise in prices. There
' were many indications also that some of the
funds which were being placed in the grangers
were delved from sales of some of the more
prominent Industrial specialties, which have
shown such recent large advances In price as
- to yield a handsome profit on the sale. ' This
shifting of speculation is an episode which
invariably occurs In the course of a long-con
tinued advance in prices. The preliminary
movement- in the highly speculative industrials
is generally quite apart from any general con
dition of business and Industry. The late ;
awakening of the more substantial railroad
stocks is looked upon as Indicating a more vital
stage of speculation -and investment. There
was a broad and confident 'â¢ demand to-day
. through the whole of the .railroad list, which
most have -come from the outside public. In
â  many stocks .this growing demand was met by
a steady stream of offerings which sent prices.
In spite of quite a large Volume of transactions,
only slightly higher than last night. The shift-
Ing of speculative accounts- involving profit
taking in the industrials encouraged bear at
tacks, but the whole railway list held remark
ably firm, showing a strong, tone at or near
the top. â  "THiIM - '
There were very heavy dealings in railroad
bonds to-day, the demand being very widely
distributed,- but most urgent in the reorganiza
, tion 4 per 'cents. The total sales of $7,475(000 is
eaid to be the largest day's business on record.
There were large dealings in the Government
Ss to-day at 106, one block of (415,000 going at
that price. A small block of the issue sold for
105%. United States old 4s coupon advanced
% in the bid price. There was no other change.
â¢ The total sales of stocks to-day were 320,800
shares, including-: Atchiaon preferred, 7634;
Burlington. 33,532; Louisville and Nashville,
6920; Metropolitan, 3265; Missouri Pacific, 8390:

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Aug. 4.â Weak Liverpool cables
.and generally flne weather throughout the
United Kingdom and Continent started wheat
lower. Some phases of the domestic situation.
however, were anything but favorable to thÂ«
bears. As the bullish factors began Imme- I
diately after the opening to be emphasized by
figures the market quickly threw off the im
pression with which it started. Chicago re
ceived only TO cars against 149 the correspond
ing day last year. Minneapolis and Duluth
receipts were 77 carloads against 150 the pre
vious year. In consequence the shipping de
mand for wheat was extremely good. The
threshing returns from Ohio were said to have
forced a reduction In the estimated yield in |
that State of fully 60 per cent from a month I
ago. That was also helpful to the bulls. The i
close was %@%c higher for September. Decem- I
tier is unchanged. i"~: :
The first bull inspiration corn has had In ;
several days was the statement to-day by the
Price Current claiming that only three quarters
of a crop would be raised. This seemed to
brace the nerves of some longs who needed en
couragement to keep them from selling out.
The general tone of the market became strong
and continued so to the end. September closed
with a gain of %<s%c. -. â¢<
Harvesting returns, which showed an In
creasing deficiency in the crop, together with
the strength of the other grains, advanced oats.
September closed %c higher.
Provisions ruled firm on light speculative
offerings and a good trade in the cash products.
The rally In corn was also an Influence. Pork
left oft 5c higher, lard 10c and ribs ."c higher.

ALAMEDA HAS
BROKEN AWAY
FROM PARDEE
Fourteen Delegates Will Go to
the Sacramento Convention
Unfettered.
Oakland Strongholds Will Follow Suit if the
Dictator Persists in His Present
Course.
. OAKLAND, Aug. 4. The revolt of Re
.'â  j>uMU>ns against Dictator George C
-Pardee is assuming proportions decidedly
â  alarming to that aspirant for guberna
â  torial 'honors, but that rule -.or ruin spirit.
Which has ever, been his -strangest, char
acteristic holds in .check a strong incli-'
"... Ilatiqn to trim his sails, and', In cbnse
'â  qaehecs. the Pardee political hark is rap*.
idly hearing the shoals of 'destruction. :
â The movement in Alamcda has- spread
' iey'ond- all control, and .the fourteen "votes
;.of. that' district are" hopelessly lost to Par
dee. Not only that., .bur- Republicans
â â â  of AlaLmeda will work with ail their might
to- .-.defeat l'ardee's men " elsewhere, for'
. they -feel that they have been most shab
bily treated by the doctor. â¢.,..
. it just leaked out â¢â â -. i.ty -that two. days
â â "ago. 'a" committee of representative Re
' publicans came over fr.om-Alamcda to
ascertain from Pardee direct if The Call's
exposure of his plan to take the naming
of candidates for .delegates entirely out
. of th. hands and to set himself up. as- a'
dictator were correct. The 'committee
..â found Pardee in- close.- conference with
â¢â¢Guy C,".-Earl, and without unnecessary
â â¢ ceremony the Alamedans stated -the ob
ject of their visit. When they, had
finished Dr. Pardee attempted' to explain
.that he thought it was only right that
â he should name the men. he wanted to
' represent him at Sacramento.- He had
every confidence In his Alameda friends,
etc.,' but â
The Alamedans did not want any buts".
â They were warm clear through, and they
' had hesitancy whatever in 'telling the
doctor- just what they thaught of his
methods. They declared then and there
that they would not permit . him. to foist
upon them a lot of men who, although
acceptable to Pardee." might be-most-ob
jectionable to them in more way than
â¢ one. ':â¢â¢â¢â  . â¢
After-making this declaration the Alar
â¢ tn^da insurgents recrossed -the trocha and
.reported the result of their interview to
. their comrades. Pardee had told â¢ them
â¢ plainly that they would not be allowed to
select their own delegates," but must
'.: meekly -accept the men he ordered them
: to vote for: ...â¢â "â¢'
War. .'was declared on Pardee then- a.nd
there';-- .Every mother's son of them start
ed in. to. work, nor have they ceased their
â labors â¢ yet: Yesterday, last night and -to
day-, they have continued their consulta
tions... which they have practically com
pJetOd:--. Dr. Pardee may name his can
didates' from Alameda, but they will not
â¢be. elected. It is safe to say they -will
hardly, receive votes enough to make it.
worth while to count ' them. Fourteen
delegates are now being selected and they
â¢wft! b<" absolutely -free To vote for any
"boriy they may see fit. These' fourteen
â will be elected beyond a shadow of doubt,
and in. consideration of the snub .to the
cpmniittee. In addition to the further af
.front to every Republican In the Encinal
City, Â together with all â¢ others i; the
â¢county/ in presuming to dictate to them,
it is. not to. be supposed they will wear
; themselves out at Sacramcnto'in wirepull
ing tot the doctor, more particularly -as
Alameda County has another candidate
In the person of V.*. R. Davis.
. . Bat- the Alamedans are not the only
people- who refuse to be herded by Dr.
.Pnrdee. Signs of revolt are rapidly in
creasing here In Oakland, while in the
country thnse who are not tied hand -and
foot, to the Pardee circus wagon are
openly avowing their Intention of voting
for- whom they please,- whether it suits
the doctor or not.
â ;'". A stanch Bupp< rter of Pardee, who is a
power in the Fourth Ward, cine of the
.-.doctor's strongholds, said to-day that if
...the dictator persisted in his present
â¢curse he would find the Fourth follow
ing 'in Alameda's footsteps and electing
.an. uninstructed delegation. The Fourth
â .:wardera are particularly annoyed .at
Parde< '-â¢ threat to place Charley Ott.
Sanitary Inspector, on his slate. Ott is
.any thins: but in favor of that ward and
the Republicans almost to a man have
, declared against him. even at the sacri
r-Pardee's ambition. And the Fourth
.-â Warders do not pledge themselves- to ac
et-p.tthe Pardee list, even if he consents
â¢to. shelve his ott. They are an'independ
Â«nt crowd and they feel keenly the dic
tatorial attitude of Pardee. They de
clare they will critically scan the list
'â of "names the doctor sends to them, and
if they are not entirely satisfactory they
â  â¢will vote for whom they please for dele
prates.- Should Pardee attempt to crowd
his men down their throats they will not
hesitate to let him 'slide and send a del
egatlpn" to Sacramento entirely untram
;me.led.
' â¢ In the Sixth Ward practically the same
'condition exists as in the Fourth, accord
' ing to another Pardee man, who is him
. self ah aspirant for office, although so
far- the doctor has, not signified his in
tention 'of naming anybody particularly
? distasteful to them. Nevertheless they
â will not accept anybody who is distaste
ful .to .them because Pardee wants him.
â¢but should any 'distasteful men be named
i they will have to come down or the doc
tor will see an uninstructed delegation
go. to Sacramento from that ward.
;â¢'â¢ And as. It Is in the Fourth and Sixth
.wards so It will be in the others. Dr.
â¢Pardee'.s determination not to allow his
supporters even the poor privilege of vot
ing for their friends who may be ambi
tious to represent the party in "State con
â¢â  "ntion has already cost him many votes
. and the end is not yet.
â  An- instance may be given of the dcs-
. perate methods to which Pardee is re
s'rthiK-to carry the country districts.
'.The county committee left the arrange
rm-ntR for the primaries entirely In the
? hands, of the individual members who
yii r- to. provide polling' places, election
r .bnV;c-rs,"otc.. for their respective localities.
â¢.This'plan has been carried out and now
from .Murray Township comes a decided
ly; audible protest against the very crude
work -of Committeeman Harris in the in
,-xerest of Pardee, whose staunch support
' er he Is. â¢
: .Murray Township Is situated in the
â¢ eastern -part of the county in a sparsely
â¢ 'â¢â¢â â¢region, and. therefore, covers a
â  rf ', at /: r ar.e:a than any other political sub
division of the county. The supporters of j
Farmer- and pavia are grouped In neigh
bor-hoodg which made Harris plan easy
â  ib carry out.

are strong Pardee towns, and in both
places' Harris baa provided every facility
for voters to cast their ballots. Polling
places have been located at frequent in
tervals; thus enabling the Pardee con
stituency to get in their votes with little
inconvenience or loss of time. ' â¢
On the other hand, Sunol and Altamont
and the adjacent country are overwhelm
ingly for Davis, and at both of these Har
ris signally failed to consider the conveni
ence of the voters. Polling places arc dis
tressingly few and far between and their
location would seem to indicate that they
were selected- for no other purpose than
to discourage voters from Hunting them
out. In one Instance the nearest polling
place was located at a point that would
require a considerable number of voters
living in one neighborhood (and all Davis
men) to make a round trip of several
miles in order to vote.
At Tcsla, the new coal mining camp,
the situation is even worse, and so far
Harris has manifested no disposition to
correct it. In order to vote, the miners,
who. are almost to a man for Davis,
would have to lose a day's work and
travel to Liivermore, nearly ten miles dis
tant. The superintendent positively re
fuses to grant the miners leave of ab
sence, as- it would necessitate the closing
down of the mine.
Consequently" there are a large number
of Davis votes in Tesla that will not be
cast unless Harris can be prevailed upon
to "provide a polling place, in that town.
The protests in some localities have be
come so pronounced that Committeeman
Harris has been forced to take some
steps -toward pacifying the complainants
by providing .more polling places and
changing others to more central loca
tions, but even the present arrangement
is far from satisfactory in those places.
It. Is by such frauds and with the aid
of the Buckley-Magnlre Democratic out
laws that Dr. Pardee expects to carry
the county. That his case is desperate
is amply demonstrated by his resorting
to such underhand methods. â 
M-etcalTa friends are positive that some
sort of. secret ' alliance exists between
tlillmrn and Pardee, and they are busily
engaged in putting a razor edge on their
scalping knives preparatory to a raid out
side the confines of their reservation.
They argue that when they succeeded in
.g the State and Congressional pri
maries separate it was tantamount to an
Understanding that there .was to be no
combining of forces. Metcalf and Davis
baye .strictly' adhered to this understand
ing, and now if Pardee has allied him
to Ifetcalfs opponent Metcalfs I
friends, and they are legion, believe the
time is propitious to call Pardee to ac
count.
A new turn was given to the guberna
torial light to-day by the formal SDtrtUÃCe
Of Secretary of State Lou Brown into the
arena. Alameda Republicans have heard
in a rourrd-at>out way that Brown was :i
candidate, but they have been so absorbed
in the light between their own aspirants
that they have paid no attention to the
troubles of outsiders. Consequently it
a surprise when Alexander Sinclair
came, down from Sacramento to-day i:i
the interests ot the Secretary. Sinclair is
an old resident of Oakland and at present
a position in the t'apitcl building.
Sinclair, pays he has formed no derlnite
plans yet. but he will look the ground
over carefully and ascertain what quar
ters offer the most inducement to begin his
missionary labors. It Is probable that he
will seek to secure the delegates for
Brown as their second choice, but of i
course his best efforts will be put forth
on the Alameda and other unpledged dele
gates. Sinclair says that Brown is gain
ing strength daily throughout the north
ern counties and thinks that neither Par
lee nor Davis will be heard of outside their
own little coterie from home.
The. straight Populist County Commit

MALOON'S MEMORIES
OF EARLY OAKLAND
MANY STREETS WERE OPEN
TO THE WATER FRONT.
â 
Slow Progress in the Trial That May
Permanently Settle Four Long
Years of Litiga
tion. â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 4.
The feature of to-day's hearing in the
I Oakland water front suit was a series of
! contentions between opposing counsel as
| to the method of proving the dedication
by the city of Oakland of property along
the front between the low and high tide
j lines for the use of the public at the time
of the compromise of 1888.
Attorney Pringle, conducting the case
| for the city, contended the proper way to
be by testimony of users of the streets.
He proposed to introduce a number of
old residents to establish this point. A
considerable controversy ensued.
Henry Maloon, who has resided in Oak
land from his infancy, and who in his
testimony showed a remarkable memory
and acquaintance with streets as they
existed prior to 1868, was the principal
' witness of the day. When asked whether
| or not prior to ivtis thore was any city
here having streets and houses Attorney
Moore registered an emphatic objection
i on the ground of Incompi tency tor the
reason thai before oral testimony may
I be introduced to- prove the dedication evi
dence must be produced to show that the
city or the owners made an offer of
dedication over and across land which
was own d by the person making the
offer of dedication, so that by user or the
like dedication could be made complete.
Attorney .Moore contended that if there
was any attempt to show dedication over
lands between Ordinary high and low
ti.le lines to connect with Bileola laid
down on the Kellersberger map it would
first be necessary that it should appear
by competent evidence- that the city, in
passing the ordinance shown in the rec
ords already in evidence, owned or had
control over the land alleged to have be
come dedicated.
After considerable argument by oppos
ing counsel Judge Ogden finally overruled
Attorney Moore's objections and permit
ted proof by user.
Witness Maloon occupied the stand the
entire afternoon and his testimony was
interesting as showing the condition of
the streets prior to the (Seeding of the
property to Carpentier by the city.
Maloon held his own all through the
cross-examination by Moore. lie de
scribed in detail the condition of streets
west of Market street as they existed
between 18C3 and ixtX; the rapidity with
Which that section was populated and im
proved; he admitted that none of the
streets In the district mentioned were in
an improved condition at that time, but
showed clearly that many ran out a con
siderable distance in 1863 to 186S, when
they were used by oyster men In hauling
oysters from the schooners to high land.
On account of three of the attorneys
being engaged in the Supreme Court the
n.xt few days the case went over until
next Tuesday afternoon.

SENSATIONAL TRIAL OPENS
COL. EVANS RETUBNED ''TOBAC
CO SMELLING TRASH."
The Plaintiff Makes a Deposition and
Describes the Papers She
la Anxious to
Regain.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9UB Broadway, Aug. 4.
The first stop in the trial of the suit
brought by Mrs. Pedar Sather against
Colonel .T. V. Evans. Collector of Customs
for Manila, was taken to-day, when
Mrs. Batter testified before the Commis
sioner. The deposition was taken by At
torneys M. M. Kstee, Harold Martin and
W. J. Robinson to the latter's office !n
this city before NotaJ-y R. J. Montgom
ery. BCassrs. A. A. Moore and John A.
Sanborn were pres -nt to represent Mrs.
Sather. The deposition was filed with the
court this afternoon.
The purpose of the deposition was to
obtain from Mrs. Sather detailed infor
mation regarding the one hundred and
ten documents for which she is suing.
When the suit was filed two weeks ago
Mrs. Sather declined to say one word re
garding it, and her deposition is the first
testimony given by the plaintiff.
Mrs. Sather related that some time ago
Colonel Evans was her attorney and that
be had full charge of her affairs. He In
vestigated the business transactions be
tween Mrs. Sather and William J. Dingee,
who had been her agent. It was discov
ered that there was about JlS.ow) differ
ence in favor of Mrs. Sather and at this
lime M. M. Estee was consulted, 10-dtiy
Mrs. Bather said that it was with Mr.
Kst.e s knowledge that she paid the in
terest on the mortgage represented by
the (18,000, ii ml she also understood that
he wits aware that she had agreed to pay
tin: principal. , _, ,
Mrs. Sather stated that when Colonel
Evans acted as her attorney she turned
over to him all the papers relating to her
transactions with Mr. Dingee. \\ hen the
colonel settled with Mrs. Sather she says
he did not return the valuable documents,
but "a lot of old trash, smelling very
strongly of tobacco."
On being pressed to accurately describe
the documents, Attorney Moore objected
on the ground that Mrs. Sather had al
ready stated that they were financial
statements between her and her agents.
The witness state.) that the papers she
sought were monthly statements relat
ing to the collection of rents and the pur
chase and sale of real estate. She believed
there were one hundred and ten of these
statements not in her possession, and she
further believes that they would be of
great value to her should she be able to
procure them.
At one time when Colonel Evans called
on her in relation to disputed matters,
Mrs. Sather testified, he said, "My dear
child, why did you do that?"
â¢Who called you 'my dear child'?"
ejaculated Mr Estee, creating the lmpres- I
sion that he thought she was testifying
of her conversation with him.
"Colonel Evans," said the lady, where
upon Mr. Estee appeared to be much re
lieved.
On the whole Mrs. Sather's evidence
was not particularly satisfactory to the
d< Cendant, as the attorneys did not elicit
from her the detailed nature of the docu
ments which they desired.
Attorney Sanborn is trying to got the
papers t>i enable a complete examination
to be made into th* affairs of Mrs. Sather.
About a year ago Mr. Dingee ceased to
be the ngent of Mrs. Safher, and her
new agents. Heron & Holoomb, put an ex
pert to work on her former accounts. A
little discrepancy was found and she then
employed Colonel Evans as her attorney.
Dealings between them were not altogeth
er satisfactory, and Mr. Sanborn became :
her attorney and brought suit to recover |
the missing monthly statements. Mr. i
I>ing.-e says if any of the statements
have been lost they can easily be dupli
cated. He declares he does not under- ;
stand how Mrs. Sather can place any
value such as $25,000 on the missing pa
pers, and he says that he has Mrs. Sath
er's acknowledgment that all accounts be
tween them are settled and correct.

Mandamus Proceeding's Brought to

AI,AMKIM. Aug. 4.â The Harbourne defal
cation rather unexpectedly cropped up to-day
In the shape of mandamus proceedings brought
in Judge Greene's department of the Superior
Court against the Board of Free Library Trus
tees of the city of Alameda, commanding them
to pay the sum of $000 to A. M. Robertson, as
assignee of the claims of Blake, Muffin &

. William Doxey and Mysell & Rollins. These
an? the bills on which' Harbourne collected and
pocketed the coin. %
The Library Board, It .Is understood, will,
set up in defense, that the claims have been
audited and warrants Issued therefor to the
'proper parties, which la as ax â¢as their, re
sponsibility goes. It will probably be main
tained by the Treasurer, who paid the war
rants, that he had recognized Harbourne as
the agent of the parties named in other trans
actions, and that they' hail also so it-cognized
him, so that in paying the warrants sued on
thÂ« city was acquitted of any further obliga
tion. The prospect is for a very pretty com
plication before the matter is finally settled.

A NEW BODY
IN POLITICS.
Will Reorganize Within
a Few Days.
THE INDUSTRIES ACTIVE
A HOT CAMPAIGN FOR PURE
FOODS AND GOOD ROADS.
Several Big Commercial Bodies Unite
to Stand for Legislation Ben
ficial to the
State.
"Within the next ten days or so the As
sociated industries will be reorganised
and put in thape for the coming cam
paign. This organization came into ex
istence In December, ;; v .'t>. and was com
posed of the Manufacturers* and ro
ducers' Association, Chamber of Com
merce, Merchants' Association, State
Board of Trade, California Minors' Asso
ciation and the Mechanics' Institute. The
object was to further all legislation bene
ficial to California. During the earlier
part of its existence its members were
instrumental in .sending- a line exhibit of
the products of the State to the Guate
malan Exposition, resulting in an In
crease In trade between that country and
California. It also had inserted In the
â¢ Code the clause compelling all State of
ficials and managers of State Institutions
to purchase supplies of California make
and production. The body took a decided
stand against a scheme of certain poli
ticians which would have thrown many
free men out of employment and given
the work to convicts. The scheme was to
have ail the rock on county roads broken
by the Folsom crusher. The efforts of
the officers of the Industries limited the
output of this convict work until only
â a few roads in the neighborhood of the
prison were built of this rock. They also
fclookod the game of the Prison Directors
In the latter's efforts to introduce the
manufacture of many articles in the
prisons, thereby interfering with free
labor. , , .
The proposition to reoganize the body
has already nut with favor and to-day
at i he meeting of the Manufacturers t nd
J-roducers" Association President Sbar
boro will bring up the matter, having had
the assurance of nearly all at the old
members that they would be ready to
tcke up the work again. The plans for
future action have been practically
evolved, and before very long the body
will appear in politics in such a manner
as to command the attention of the poli
ticians. Among the objects to be at
tained is that of having passed stricter
pure food laws than now exist in the .stat
utes, so that all boards of health will
have the power to deal with the evils
of adulterated and impure foods. It is
proposed to have the laws so iron-bound
' that no red tape will be required to stamp
out the evil. The members of the organi
zation will make an effort to have a good
sized pure food plank introduced in the
platforms of the two big political par
ties and every legislative candidate will
1. "sounded." before he is indorsed by
the organization. The members are look
ing especially to the Republican party for
its indorsement of the pure food proposi
tion because of the stand taken by the
leader of that body. President McKinley.
It will be remembered that the strict pure
food laws of the State of Ohio were the
creation of Mr. McKinley, who made one
of the hardest rights of his life in hav
ing them become laws. In the coming
viection if a candidate has not commit
ted himself to the cause of the protection
of the health of the public in the matter
of pure foods he may expect opposition
from^*the commercial ami mercantile
bodies composing the Associated Indus
tries.
Another purpose 1b to co-operate with
those who have the good roads movement
in hand. The Qood Roads League of this
State has become a very strong organi
zation, its branches being established in
nearly every county, and even town, in
California. A combination of these two
bodies will cut a big figure in the coming
campaign. At the present time J. A. Fil
cher of the State Board of Trade is the.
president and Julian Sonntag the treas
urer of the Associated Industrie;;. Before
anything can be done in the matter of re
organizing the industries an election will
have to be hold, but this can be easily
effected as soon as the movement is
started at the meeting of the manufac
turers to-day.

Ford W. Thomas, Customs Broker,
Wins a Hard-Fought Battle.
Collector Jackson was notified by a dis- j
patch from Washington 'yesterday that
the United States Attorney General had i
rendered an opinion to the effect that
â¢when the quantity of sugar used in ex- |
ported canned, fruit can be ascertained
the drawback on said : sugar should be
restored.
. Ford W. Thomas, customs broker, had i
been working for several months on the ;
Washington authorities In order' to bring I
about this decision, and his arguments
were so cogent and unanswerable that
the Attorney General acknowledged their
force â¢- and rendered the decision just
quoted. ~ ,

HE SUBDUED THE LION
The Spectacle of Cannon, the Fat Man,
in Tights Proves Too Much for
" Wallace."
THERE was a dress rehearsal at
the Chutes yesterday, the prin
cipals in which were Wallace,
the fierce^ African lion, and
Henri Maurice Cannon, whose claim
to fame is based on the fact that he
weighs over 600 pounds. It has been
arranged that he shall give public
exhibitions in the lion's cage and
the affair yesterday was in the na-
ture of a try out for both the man
nnd the king of beasts.
Wallace was removed from his
cage in the menagerie to another
erected in the open for exhibition
purposes. He at once made a sur
vey of his temporary quartors and
then awaited developments. Cap
tain Cardono, who is in charge of
the animals, was the first to enter
the cage and soon had his charge
growling and snapping viciously.
Attorney J. T. Fleming, who was on
the ground, was then induced to en
ter and spent an unpleasant ten
minxitts while Wallace was put
through his paces.
All this time Cannon was pacing
WELTER WEIGHTS
FIGHT TO-NIGHT
A SCIENTIFIC BATTLE IS PROM
ISED.
Tom Tracey and Frank McConnell
in First-Class Shape for a
Hard Contest.
If Tom Tracey Is not on the retrograde
he should surprise some of Frank Mc-
Donnell's most ardent admirers this even-
Ing. '
Reports have stated that Tracey Is not
physically as able a mail to-day as he
was on the evening he met George Green
in Woodward's Pavilion. There may be
some truth in the whisperings that have
been wafted from the other side of the
big mountains concerning Tracey's ways
of living since his last appearance In this
i city, but it goes without suying that his
look's belie all reports of a kind that may
do the Eastern welter-weight an Injus
tice. Tracey, to all outward appearance,
is in first-class condition, and if all goes
well he should give an excellent account
of himself this evening. True, he is not
as rapid a fighter as McKeever, but what
he is lacking in speed he fully makes up
for in punching powers. It must be re
â¢ membered that when he fought Green
he had to give away chunks of weight,
as Green at that time would not fight any
man who was at all near his (Green 8)
fighting weight. '
Tracey was born in Australia, and has
been fighting since 1891. His . first battle
of any importance was against Dummy
Mace in Melbourne, which ended in a
draw. His hot engagement in January,
1593, with Billy Gallagher of Oakland in
the old Pacific Club, which was then
; managed by Billy Harrison. Is still fresh
in the minds of many sport-loving citi
zens. Gallagher had Tracey all but out,
| but the Australian proved his great
sameness, and struggling to his feet in
an almost bewildered state he put his
; right on Gallagher's jaw, and that turned
the tide of battle. Oakland Blfty went out
in the nineteenth round. In April, lslM.
Tracey met the black demon Walcott and
was knocked out In the sixteenth round,
i after a hard battle. It was on the even
ing of October 8 that he met and was de
! feated by George Green in ten rounds.
McConnell's record is very short. His
only batle of note was that in which he
defeated McKeever, not by a chance
, blow, as many people suppose, but by a
! display of excellent judgment, backed up
< by the good fighting qualities that are
possessed by men who attain champion
! ship distinction.
McDonnell is unquestionably a polished
boxer, and his fight with McKeever im
pressed, many good judges, who did not
hesitate to pronounce him a rising star
; in the sky. of pugilism. .
Tracey will need use very great caution
i when he tangles up with the local cham
i pion this evening, as at close range Mo
! Connell can handle himself to the very
best of advantage, and his shifts are well
1 worthy of closest attention. In the sec
ond round of his light with McXeever.
McConnell executed what is known in
fighting parlance as a double shift, which
took the clever McKeever entirely by sur
prise; and an unguarded jaw was a target
: which McConnell missed by scarcely an
Inch. The blow would have ended the
; battle had it landed. Â ,-, â
The betting strongjy favors McConnell.
i but the odds are false, as Tracey Is a far
! better man that local sports imagine.
; Those who have laid $10 to JS may have
cause to regret their hasty action. The
i game is certainly not an easy one for
! either man. . ". >â â¢'â¢' â ' - ' â  .
A COWARDLY BLOW.
James Leahy of tne Kansas Regi
ment Punished for Striking
a Woman.
James Leahy, a member of Company
A, Kansas regiment, appeared before
| Judge Mogan yesterday to answer a
! charge of battery upon Mrs. Clotllde
j Hourcade, who owns a shooting gallery
: on Pine and Dupont streets.
The evidence showed that Leahy and
1 a comrade patronized the shooting gal
lery Wednesday night and refused to
pay. As they turned to leave Mrs. Ilour
caae seized Leahy's comrade by the arm
i and threatened to call the police. She
I blew a police whistle and a crowd made
! a rush for the gallery. During the ex
citement Leahy went behind Mrs. Hour
( cade and struck her a violent blow In the
: face, blackening one of her eyes.
Leahy did not deny striking the blow,
and the Judge told him his action was
that of a coward to strike a woman. He
sentenced him to pay a flno of $30, with
the alternative of thirty days in the Coun
ty Jail.

up and down the grounds. His wife
fluttered about, drawing from her
weighty lord the comment: "In-
Btead of giving me courage she is
frightening me to death." "Old Av
oirdupois" was a sight to make the
angels weep. He was dressed in
white tights with red trunks. Over
his shoulders was thrown a long
cape like a toga and the Roman ef
fect was heightened by a pair of
open work shoes reaching half way
to his knees, or where one would
Judge his knees ought to be.
When the time came for him to
enter the cage his wife retreated a
short distance, sat down and re
tired behind a newspaper. When
ever the lion roared she would hide
her face with the paper and would
then peep out from behind it to
note the progress of events. The
few loungers about the grounds
kept quiet after Cannon entered the
cage until Captain Cardono told the
fat man to hide behind him. This
proved too much for the spectators,
as the lion tamer could hide
but a email portion of his compan
ion. The lion snarled and showed
his teeth, but his demonstration of
vlciousness did not go beyond this.
Cannon never took his eyes off him
while in the cage and as he backed
out through the false door said,
"A^dleu, Wallace, adieu!"
HE CALLS CHRISTIAN
ENDEAVORERS FRAUDS
AN ANONYMOUS WHITER BIT
TERLY DENOUNCES THEM. ,;
Says Neither the Society Nor Its
Members Will Pay a Bill If
It Can Be Avoided.
In a recent issue of Our Youth, a paper
published In the Interests of the Boys'
Home at 26 Laurel place by A. Hutchin
son, appeared an article severely arraign
ing the Christian Endeavor Society , as a
whole and its members as individuals.
The author of the article, who. care
fully conceals his Identity, attempted to
get up a Christian Endeavor, column in
Our Youth, in hopes of gaining subscribers
to that paper, but failed, as the corre
sponding secretaries of the unions neglect
ed to send him any items. He also had a
I somewhat bitter experience as one of the
owners of the Pacific Coast Endeavorer,
which suspended publication over a 'year
ago, because, he says, the subscribers
failed to pay their subscriptions. All these
things have combined to turn hie love
Into hate, and he openly accuses the \En
deavorers of being swindlers who use re
ligion as a cloak to hide their innate
selfishness and crookedness. In his arti
cle he says;
We have known a district Christian Endeavor
Union to escape paying for a special edition
after It had been issued and circulated on
the barest technicality. We have known a
branch committee of the great '97 convention
to object to a printer's bill after being given
the lowest 'possible rates until It was too late
for the bill to be audited, and the printer was
thus compelled to make an unwilling contribu
tion to the '87 fund of over $10.
We are not Burprtsed when a hard-bakeS
sinner does something dishonest or mean, but
when a society whose members not only prom
ise to "strive to do whatever Christ would
have them do." but proclaim that fact by
meana of a badge, la guilty of meanness, It
(fives those who sneer at Christianity far
greater occasion for their gibes than all the
well-worn falsehood â¢of the ungodly.
In saying these things we are inspired by no
feelings of bitterness. We have outlived the
disappointment we felt ' when obliged to sus
pend our paper because the Endeavorors failed
i to pay their debtÃ. The society Is a grand one,
its leaders sincere and Us work great, but if
God would allow his clionen people under
Joshua to suffer defeat because of one Achan
he is not going to hold the Endeavor army en
tirely guiltless when they pass unrebuked lit
tle acts of petty dishonesty or meannees that
tend to cause the > world to sneer at Christ and
his followers as no better than the children
of the evil one.
Prominent members of the society,
when seen, disclaimed all knowledge or
unpaid bills of the convention, and point
to the fact that there was a surplus of
$1500 after all bills were paid. Little or
nothing is known ,of Mr. Hutchinson by
them, but the few who do know him de
scribe him as "just the kind of man who
would write such an article." He dis
claims having written it, but says that
every word of it is true and that he is
willing to vouch for it and can back up
I his statements with ample proof.

HUNTING FOR
A LIBRARIAN
A Successor Wanted for
Arthur Jellison.
ONLY ONE NAME SUGGESTED
DIRECTORS WANT AN IDEAL
MAN FOR THE PLACE.
H. L. Ticknor Claims the Mechanics'
Library Is Deplorably
Behind the
* / Times.
Ever since the death of Arthur M. Jel
llson, the librarian of the Mechanics' In
stitute, it has been a matter of conjec
ture as to who will be appointed to the
responsible position as his successor.
Rumor has given birth to various theo
ries and has outlined a host of appli
cants, but these are denied by those di
rectly concerned in the management of
the institute.
H. L. Ticknor, chairman of the em
ployes committee, averred yesterday that
no one had been mentioned for the posi
tion and that the board of directors had
not decided as yet as to who was the
most eligible man to succeed Jellison.
He maintained that it was the univer
sal decision of the members of the board
to get the best man obtainable to ful
fill the duties of the position.
When asked as to whether Graves, the
acting librarian and Jellison's former as
sistant, would be ujiowed to take charge
of the institute as permanent librarian,
he said that Graves was a good man and
had done much in the interests of the
library, but inferred and clearly indicated
that he was of the impression that he
was not the best man that the directors
were vainly seeking for.
"We want a librarian," said Mr. Tick
nor, "that Is a man of letters, capable of
guiding the public in the selection of lit
erature. A man holding such a position
should be well educated and conversant
with the different and various books of
the library and capable of advising and
instructing subscribers in the choice of
books. He should lend, by his qualifica
tions, a certain prestige to the Institute
which would undoubtedly encourage the
public and increase the patronage of the
library.
"Who will be the librarian," he con
tinued, "depends solely on the man best
capable of conforming to the ideal libra
rian as outlined by the directors.
"We are behind the times and, knowing
this, we must do our best to keep abreast
of them by selecting careful, capable and
efficient officers to control and build the
library to what it should be. We have
been in a state of inertia for years and
It is now about time that we should en
deavor to take a step forward. We are
like the merchants of this cityâ living
buck in the days of '49.
"In the selection of an officer to fill
the vacancy occasioned by the death of
Mr. Jellison we have determined to make
this our initial effort in the furtherance
of the work contemplated. There has
been no one as yet found who has suited
us, and we propose to wait until the right
and the best man steps forward to assume
the responsibility and the duties involved
in the acceptance of the position.
"The rumor that an Kastern man of
education and extensive experience has j
been decided upon for the vacancy Is lin- j
true. There has been absolutely no one :
suggested and absolutely not the slightest |
indication that there will be in the near i
future."
F. B. Graves, in speaking of his chances
of becoming the permanent librarian of
the institute, stated that, although he
has no definite knowledge as to the prob
able action of the board in his favor,
still he thinks that his name should meet
with considerable consideration, as he
has been connected with the library for
nearly fourteen years, lie oialms that
all the directors are not favorably dis
posed toward him in the matter of the
appointment, but the majority are, which
fact, he hopes, will be proven at the elt?c
tion which will be held in about sixty
days. In all probability the names of sev
eral applicants will be presented to the
board for consideration at the next regu
lar semi-monthly meeting.
BONDED WAREHOUSES
WILL GET THE TEA
SHIPPEKS PBEPARING A PRO
TEST TO WASHINGTON.
They Contend That the New Ruling
Imposes a Burden on Consignees
Without Benefit to the
Government.
Importers of tea are very much exer
; clsed over a ruling' of the Secretary of
I the Treasury to the effect that all shlp
: merits of the fragrant herb must be
| placed In bonded warehouse until the tea
| has been passed upon by the Tea Ex
aminer and the duty of 10 cents per
pound paid upon it. Heretofore they
; have been In the habit of storing the tea
i In their own warehouses, thus saving: the
i bonded warehouse charges, but under
the new ruling they will be put to an
expense which they consider unneces-
sary.
Hence the shippers and consignees liavo
prepared a strong: protest, which they
will forward to-day by tolesraph to
Washington, asking for the rescinding of
the rule. They contend that It imposes
a burden additional to the tax, and that
the Interests of the Government would
be just as well subserved by allowing the
protestants to store the tea In their own
warehouses, as heretofore.
CHAMPIONS WILL COURSj<}.
The Big Match Race and Two Splen
did Stakes at Ingleside.
The champion stake and the "puppy
event to be run at . Ingleside to-morrow
and Sunday -were drawn at Pythian
Castle last evening. The champion stake
filled to the limitâ thirty-two performersâ
and never before was a better â  aggrega

Mr. Foote was elected a delegate at
large from Alameda County a few days
ago. When he was informed of the
fact he declared his Intention of refus
ing to serve, giving as his reason that
he did not propose to tahe a hand in
the deliberations of a body the action
of which had been anticipated by a set
of self-appointed bosses. M. F. Tar
pey, whir is also one of the three dele
gates at large from Alameda County,
was of the same way of thinking as
Mr. Foote. He- declared that he would
not serve because he could not support
the cut-and-dried fusion arrangement
i that had been prepared and was to be
served up at the convention. Party
leaders from all parts of the* State have
Importuned both gentlemen to lay aside
personal scruples and go to Sacra

lieve It to be my duty as a Democrat
to lend such aid as I may in fighting
against a condition of things that seems

party and the wishes of its members,
and who have apparently used their
self-delegated power to further same
private or individual ends.
"I believe that we should do what is
right regardless of what the immediate
consequences may be, for it is better
to be right and lose than to gain an

here let me say that I am opposed first,

delegates to the State convention and
rob the voters of the right to have a
voice in the sedection of the men who
are to represent them, they having al
ready been robb<ed of the right to select
the men who cwnpose the governing
body of the local Democracy.
"I believe that this is the time when
all Democrats wttio have the welfare
of the party at heart should stand to
gether and fight for the principles that
have made the party what it is â one
of the two great politicaJ organiza
tions of the greate:Â«c nation on the face
of the globe."
The views expressed by these gen
tlemen are heartiljr indorsed in every
quarter where the subject of Demo
cratic politics is dis mussed. H. T. Fort
man is outspoken in his disapproval of
the manner in whicb the Populist, pro
gramme is being stuffed down the
throat of the Democratic party.
"I wish to have it distinctly under
stood," he said yesterday, "that I will
never submit to any such programme
as these hand-made bosses have pre
pared for the State cojirention. I am
in favor of nominating a. straight Dem
ocratic ticket, and I beiileve that such
is the wish of the grea t majority of
the voters in the party. I cannot bring
myself to believe that men who call
themselves Democrats will ever con
sent to play second fiddle in the Popu
list band."
It is apparent that the .MeNab-Alford
combination is becoming apprehensive
and that every nerve is being strained
tg stop the leaks that threaten to
swamp their political cocEileshell. To
do this it is necessary that they shall
have the naming of the cha.irman of the
convention. A chairman favorable to
their interests would name a committee
on credentials which vvtfuM submit to
the convention a report favoring the
seating of the programme delegation
from this city as against tl^e Harney
delegation. fcJuch a chairman would
also name a committee on ord*>r of busi
ness and a committee on resolutions.
The first would report an ordi;r of busi
ness caJling for nominations for Gov
ernor, Treasurer and so <m through the
very limited list of offloes that have
been saved for the Democrats. The
committee on resolutions would report
a resotution for the ratification of all
n on) in at ions made by th.c Pqpulist con
vention. In this manner the j >rogramme j
would be forced upon the convention \
and, with the aid of the soil d block of
154 votes from Pan Francisco, it would
probably pro through.
The programmers wish to have either
Alford or Gould elected chairman, but
they are fearful that the convention
will refuw to trust either of the gen
tlemen. They therefore consider it a
better plan to put forward Robert M.
Fitzgemld for the place. .As they are
not sure that Fitzgerald wtill faithfully
perform all of tho duties that they will
assign to him they are bringing pres
sure to bear on him through his brother
Edward F. Fitzgerald, who is a candi
date for the nomination for Assessor in
this city. The combination hopes to
force its choice- for chairman to carry'
out its wishos by threatening to knife
his brother if he fails to do so.
These are the m*"-n nnd thr>se are the
methods which the honest Democrats
of the State have decided to-put on the
shelf.
REPUDIATES THE
"ONE HUNDRED."
R. P. Doolan, the Member
From the Thlrty-Finst, De
clines to Name the
Delegates.
One member of the Democratic commit
tee of 100 has shown marked disapproval
of the rule established by that body,
which seeks to deprive the Democrats of
San Francisco of the right to name dele
gates to the State convention.
R. P. Doolan went before tho meeting
of the Thirty-first Assembly District
Democratic Club last night and informed
his fellow members that as a member of
the committee of 100 he proposed to break
a rule of that eommtttee, or words to that
effect, by relinquishing 1 to tho Democratic
club of the district the right to choose
ten of the eleven delegates to the State
convention, to which the district is en
titled. Whereupon Mr. Doolan was ap
plauded. He proposed, however, to keep
the list within the membership of the
club, and announced his intention of se
lecting his appointees from the list direct
ly it was presented to him, so that if
there should be any objection made it
could be made before the committee of
100 got a chance at it. . He proposed to
let nls club actually name the dele
gates.
Mr. Doolan was ngain applauded. And
then he was interrupted by an outsider,
who was denounced, and who declared
that the member of the com
mittee of Democratic bosses was
putting up a Job. So Mr. Doolan
decided that he would take time
to think over the names nnd consult the
persons named. Sixteen names were pre
sented, from which ten will be selected as
the club's delegates, and Mr. Doolan him
self will name the eleventh. The sixteen
are those:
Dr. Robert J. Lowroy, M. Cella, John
Reed, M. J. Pilva, Thomas Clancy, C. J.
Gallagher. Major Enright. John Mc-
Geary. Thomas Hlckey. T. E. Tracy, D.
J. Qulnlan, Jeremiah J. Sheahan, Patrick
Savage, John McDonald, J. J. Joell,
James McElearney.
The Tommy Bree Banjo and Mandolin
Club and Messrs. O'Neil, Hahn, Kelley,
Peaaley and Schwartz served the club
with music in preparation for a speech
by Judge Robert Ferral.
Thomas Hickey and Mr. Clnrk also ad
dressed tho meeting and Timothy E.
Tracy marie a little speech declining to
bo sent to Sacramento as a delegate, pro
vided ho should be appointed from the
list chosen. And the meeting broke up
harmoniously.
MAGUIRE WILL ARRIVE
NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT
Arrangements for His Recep
tion Now Being Made by

Charles H. Holcomb, president of the
Central Democratic Club, received a tele-
gram from Congressman Magulre yestor

HARNEY WING WILL
NOMINATE DELEGATES
District Clubs Will Begin Choos-
ing Representatives to the
Convention To-Night.
An air of quietness pervaded the head
quarters of the Harney Democracy in the
Baldwin Hotel last evening. The political
situation was discussed by a few dozen
followers, seated about the room. The en
rollment, which began on Wednesday
evening, was still in progress, and sev
eral thousand additional names have
horn added to the list. To-night the va
rious district clubs will begin nominating
their delegates to the Sacramento conven
tion, and by Monday evening it is thought
the entire list of those who will Journey
to the capital will be completed.
MAKING PLANS FOR

Dixon's New Hat Store.
The many friends of Mr. S. W. Dix
on, the popular hatter, will be pleased
to learn that he haf severed his con
nection with the Emporium and has
opened an elegant new hat store at 7C7
Market street, opposite the Phelan
building.
Always alive to the demands of the
public in his line, Mr. Dlxon offers a
superior quality of hats at popular
prices. He has a complete stock of the
most seasonable goods direct from the
best Eastern manufacturers. Mr. Dix
on, contrary to the prevailing custom,
is ready to take a reasonable profit on
a volume of sales, instead of demand
ing while goods are new a price for
Â«tvle and reputation, that as soon as
shop worn dealers are accustomed to
sell for half price. A specialty is made
of $1 $2 and $3 hats. The reputation
for reliability in his business methods
enjoyed in the past by Mr. Dixon is an
assurance of further success in his new
departure.

HAS CAUGHT A

The Fascinating Actress Says
She Will Marry Baron

Tschirne et Janowitz en Silesie (fvang.; t 10 Janv. 1858); 2Â° a Trach

Notwithstanding the somewhat an
noying publicity of the Hollander-
Blame incident, which is now closed,
and the accidental fall received while
dancing the cancan in a rehearsal of
the play, "Lostâ Twenty-four Hours,"
the consequences of which have
thrown her upon a sickbed. Miss Made
leine Bouton, late leading lady of the
Frawley company, is a happy woman.
Miss Bouton is soon to be married.
She has caught a German Baron. His
name is Guido yon Nimptsch.
Miss Bouton, who is at the McNutt
Hospital, made the happy confession
last evening mid tears and smiles. It
was drawn from her by means of a
dispatch from New York, which was
shown her. The telegram stated that
a sensation had been created in New
York by the announcement that she
had been married to Baron yon
Nimptsch more than a year ago, and
that the fact had been carefully con
cealed all this time, as the Baron's
family would be very much onposed to
his marrying an actress. The story of
their first meeting, as told in the tele
gram, was as follows, and the scene
would not be inappropriate in one of
SISTER CLAY DISPUTES MADELEINE.
NEW YORK, Aug. -s.â Miss Clay St. John, a sister of Medeleine Bou
ton, in an interview yesterday said:
"My sister has been Baroness yon Nimptsch for over a year and a
half. She and the Baron were married in New York In December of
1896. I was told by Madeleine to keep the news a secret. The Baron did
not care to have his relatives in Germany know of the marriage for fear
he might be disinherited for marrying an actress."
the plays in which Miss Bouton has
made so many successes:
"It came about through a rainy day
on Broadway. Miss Bouton's maid was
hurrying past the Hoffman House to
reach the elevated station, when her
foot slipped. There was a wild effort
to balance herself, she fell, and then
gave a cry of pain. All this happened
just as Baron yon Nimptsch was being
driven down Broadway in his carriage
on his way to his office in the Empire
building. He saw that she was seri
ously hurt, and taking her in his arms
he carried her to a near-by drug store.
There a doctor was summoned and it
was found that the maid's ankle was
badly sprained. There was no possi
bility of her walking, ani for her to
try to get home alone was out of the
question. The gallant Baron placed his
carriage at her service and accompa
nied her to the flat where Miss Bouton
was living at the time. As the rescuer
of her maid the Baron was introduced
to Miss Bouton, and was frequently
seen to call at the flat afterward, and
finally they were married."
Miss Bouton read this dispatch with
the deepest interest. Then drawing a
long sigh she burst into tears and ex
claimed, "Why can't they let me
alone!" The next moment she broke
into smiles and laughter.
"That story is all rot! It's a fairy
story!" said she. The rapid change
from tears to Laughter was quite an
emotional scene, and was much enjoyed
by the audience: "Then it is not true
that you're a Baroness?"
"Not yet, but I hope soon to be," she
replied. "I shall be married to Baron
Guido yon Nimptsch a^ soon as I re
cover from my illness. I suppose I
might as well tell all about it now, in
order to correct that silly New York
story.
"I became acquainted with the Ba
ron eighteen months ago. My maid
didn't cut any figure in that romance..
That sprained ankle of hers was not
one of the properties in the play. I
first met the Baron at a dinner party
at the residence of a well-known fam
ily â most charming people â who were
among my most intimate friends. He
became very attentive to me, and that
acquaintance ripened into love. He
asked me to be his wife; I made him
happy by giving him an affirmative
answer. That was one. year ago.
Since that time we have been most de
voted to each other.
"Just before coming to San Francisco
I had the choice of going to Europe on
a wedding trip or playing a season's
engagement with the Frawley com-
pany. Being wrapped up in my pro
fession, and having secured a rich and
elegant wardrobe, my woman's pride
naturally led me to appear upon the
stage for one more season, the under
standing being that we should then be
married.
"I bade the Baron good-by and came
west, while he went over to Europe on
important business. You know the rest.
Here lamon a sick bed. They are
building me up in order to prepare me
for a surgical operation which I must
undergo in a few days. God only
knows whether I will come out of it."
"Does the Baron know of your mis
fortune?" she was asked.
"Oh, yes! I cabled him yesterday,
and he Ju-s answered that he will come
to San Francisco at once. I have re
ceived letters Jrom him in every Eu
ropean mail. Here's his last letter in
which he says he intended to sail for
New York on August 15, and might be
obliged to go to Chicago, and possibly
to San Francisco."
"I just think the Baron is the only
pebble on the beach. Please excuse
the expression, as it conveys my feel
ing for him. I am very proud of him.
He comes from a distinguished family
âthe Hatzfeldt fa-nily. He is a cousin
of that Prince Hatzfeldt who married
Miss Huntington of this city. .
By reference to the Almanach de
Gotha it is learned that Baron Guido
yon Nimptsch is the son of the Coun
tess Francoise Hatzfeldt and Paul yon
Nimptsch of Jaeschkowitz. Tschirne
and Janowltz in Silesia, who were mar
ried in 1849. He is about 47 years of
age. His mother married a second time,
to Walther, Baron of Ix>e. The name
of the Nimptsch family is found con
nected by marriage with the Hatzfeldts
in 1847.
