Celebrated War Correspondents, Army and
Navy Officers and Artists Who Will Join
in Sending Accurate Descriptions
of All Battles,
NEW YORK, April 24. â The elaborate preparations which have been in progress for
perfecting The Call-Herald news service is completed. It will be the best equipped and
most thoroughly organized newspaper service ever put into operation.
Richard Harding Davis, who has a world-wide reputation as a correspondent, is with
the fleet before Havana. Charles Akers, the army expert and an experienced newspaper
man, is going with the army. In addition to the powerful tugs Sommers N. Smith and
Albert F. Dewey, now with the fleet, the ocean-going steamer Tyr, flying the Danish flag,
has been chartered. She sailed from Baltimore for Porto Rico yesterday with Half a dozen
correspondents and artists, and will cover the blockade. Matter will be cabled from St.
Thomas or Kingston, as circumstances will permit. Five special correspondents, who speak
Spanish, left for the south to-day and will join an army corps in Cuba.
On the tugs are half a dozen men with specially constructed cameras for taking sea
views, and also artists who will sketch for The Call-Herald picture telegraph machine now
at Key West. There are special men on all the West Indies, who will send matter as long
as the cables remain uncut. Call-Herald correspondents still remain in Madrid, Cadiz,
Barcelona and St. Vincent, and preparations have been made for a full and comprehensive
cable service. With each squadron there are half a dozen naval officers who will act as
special correspondents for The Call-Herald, and will have peculiar facilities for describing
with accuracy all naval engagements.

HAVANA MAY BE
BOMBARDED AT
DAYLIGHT TO-DAY
Admiral Sampson's Alleged Notice That
Causes Consternation at the
Cuban Capital.
While the United States Warships Are Shelling the
Forts the Insurgents Will Rally in the
Rear to Aid the Invaders.
HAVANA, April 24 â The United States fleet will begin the bombardment of
Havana to-morrow.
Rear- Admiral Sampson has sent notice of his intention to Mr. Gollan, British
Consul-General here, who, acting under instructions from his Government, is in
charge of the United States Consulate here. Mr. Gollan has told Captain-General
Blanco that real war is about to begin. The city is terror-stricken.
Admiral Sampson's notice simply stated that he intended to begin bombard
ment. It is not known whether his ships will confine themselves to the batteries,
and, after silencing them, take Havana with his sailors and marines, or will try to
eoropo! a surrender by shelling the city itself.
General Blanco visited all the batteries as soon as he was told of the intention
of the American commander. He is now at Santa Clara, where are the guns that
are most depended upon as defenders. He will remain there all night. The first
shot is expected at daybreak.
There is no rest in the city to-night. The streets are crowded and troops are
being moved hither and thither to strengthen the defenses.
General Pando, who hastened to the remote batteries as soon as the United
States fleet arrived here, returned to the city to-night. I was told that he had a nar
row escape from capture by a rebel band, and that the report was accompanied by
another to the effect that the insurgents are moving in toward the city, so as to be
ready to dash in and assist the United States forces should they invade the city.
No troops can now be spared from the main defenses to drive them back.
PHILIPPINES WILL
ALSO BE CAPTURED
NEW YORK, April 24.â The Herald's Washington
correspondent sends the following: Spain's possessions in the
far East will be under the guns of the American squadron com
manded by Commodore G. H. Dewey by Tuesday next.
Official information, it is understood, has reached Washington
of the preparations for the work which the Navy Department
has laid out for it to perform. Accompanying the men-of-war
are the revenue cutter McCulloch and a number of colliers
conveying coal and other stores needed for the fleet in its
operations against the Spanish naval force in the waters of
the Philippines and against the fortifications of Manila and
other seaports of those islands.
It is the expectation of the experts of the Navy Depart
ment that the squadron will cover the 628 miles separating
Hongkong and Manila within sixty hours, so that when the
offensive operations begin Congress shall have formally de
clared war and the President's approval to the declaration
shall have been affixed. The vessels which comprise Com
modore Dewey 's fighting force consist of the protected cruiser
Olympia, flagship of the squadron and of 5870 tons displace
ment; the protected cruiser Baltimore of 4413 tons, the pro
tected cruiser Raleigh of 3213 tons, the protected cruiser Bos
ton of 3000 tons, the gunboat Concord of 1890 tons and the
gunboat Petrel of 892 tons. In addition to these vessels the
revenue cutter McCulloch, of 12S0 tons, will undoubtedly
perform excellent service. Immediately upon her arrival at
Hongkong she was supplied with a modern battery and tor
pedo'tubes, and she is now superior in fighting ability to the
Petrel.

probably be given to the Detroit .-non

The Cataluna is of 479Â° gross and 34Q1

understandings.
Spain Has Replied to McKinley's
Ultimatum, Leaving That Na=
tion's Position Clearly
Defined,
Call Office. Rlggs House,
Washington, April 24.
A resolution formally declar
ing war against Spain will be in
troduced in the Congress of the
United Suites to-morrow. The
decision to d<> so has been reach
ed afu-r mature deliberation. All
the arguments pro and con were
discussed this afternoon at the
Whitv House at a conference in
which President McKinley, At
torney-General Griggs, Assis
tant Secretary " Day and Sena
tors Davis and Hale partici
pated, and on its breaking up
the announcement was made
that Con? ss to-morrow would
be asked to declare what it is
held already exists.
This was the most important Wash
ington development on tlv first war
Sunday. The President will send a
message to Congress to-morrow to be
delivered immediately after its con
vening, setting forth the facts in the
and asking Congress to formally
declare war, in order thai there may be
no misundi rstanding on the part of
nations.
The most important point in the mes
sage from a news point of view will be
the announcement that Spain has
made formal reply to our ultimatum.
This reply has not been given to the
public, and it was supposed that none
had been reached. The document is a
formal acknowledgment by Spain, and
is an acceptance by that country of the
ultimatum as a virtual declaration of
war. Congress will therefore !>â â  asked
to recognize- this condition of affairs,
and declare it to the world, using
Spain's concession as a reason for it.
The war resolution has been pre
pared, and it is understood that the
two committees having charge of the
foreign affairs fur the two houses of
ress will be prepared to report on
it very shortlyâ probably immediately
after th" reading of the message. An
effort v. ill then be made to have the
resolution taken up and passed forth
with, and it is not now believed that
there will be any formidable opposition
to this course in either House.
Otherwise the news of the clay here
related almost entirely to the execution
of plans hitherto expected.
For the President and his Cabinet
officials Sunday pass.^a quietly and un
eventfully. Secretary Alger took his
daughter to the "White House during
tin- morning, and she m company with
the President, attended divine services
at the Metropolitan Methodist Church,
Secretary Alger going to a Presbyter
lan church. Secretary and Mrs. Gage
also drove to the White House and
accompanied the President q,nd Miss
Alger to the Metropolitan. Mrs. M<-
Kinley has not yet returned from her
trip to New York City.
General Corbin and Secretary Alger
conferred during the afternoon respect
ing the arrangements for calling on the
Governors of the States and Territories
for the quota of troops they are to fur
nish under the President's proclama
tion asking for 125,000 men. The num
ber of men in each branch of the serv
ice â infantry, cavalry and artillery â
remains to be settled, besides many
other matters of detail.
In the State, War and Navy Depart
ments many of the officials were at
their desks directing the execution of
policies heretofore determined upon.
Neither Secretary Alger nor Secretary-
Long wa.s on hand, but Assistant Sec
retary Meiklejohn and Assistant Sec
retary Roosevelt were on duty for sev
eral hours. .Mr. Meiklejohn has al
ready received a large number of ap
plications fn.-m newspapers to permit
their representatives to accompany the
army, but, as stated in the circular
issued yesterday, the number to be ac
corded the privilege will be limited.
Assistant Secretary Day is busily en
gaged in making the general
tion for the transportation of troops
overland and also to Cuba, for which a
large number of vessels will be char
tered.
In the quartermaster's office nearly
thf> whole clerical force was on hand.
The details arc far from complete, but
the quartermaster-general believes
everything will be in readiness by the
time the troops are ready to move. It
may be that the railroad arrangements
for the transfer of troops overland will
be left to the immediate charge of the
quartermasters of the various army
department.s, who are fully acquainted
with the facilities at hand for doing
this work. Some understanding with
the railroads on the basis of uniform
rates of travel will be arranged if pos
sible, so that the soldiers may be sent
by the shortest possible route with the !
least charge to the Government. Ques
tions of equipment of the troops with
uniforms and tents also are to be set
tled, although many of the State or
ganizations are prepared in this re
spect. The department has a number
of branches in which tents, uniforms,
etc., are manufactured, but it will be
compelled to rely on the service of out-
Bide firms to meet the present demands. !
It is said at the Naval Department
that all the militia which will be used
in the deep sea patrol vessels already
has been ordered to them. Those re
maining will be utilized in manning
the signal stations along the coast and
the vessels of the close-shore auxiliary
fleet.
Commander Richardson Clover ox
pects that the gunboat Bancroft, which
he is to command, and which is now
undergoing repairs at Brooklyn, will
Bail for Norfolk within a few days to
take on her ammunition. The proba
bility is thai the vessel will then be
sent to* join Admiral Sampson's fleet.
It is said to be definitely settled that
Captain Albert E. S. Barker, a member
of the joint army and navy defense
plan hoard, will command the protect
ed cruiser Newark, now fitting out at
Norfolk. She will be ready for service
some time In May.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt to-day
announced that the Government had
purchased the steamer yacht Aliene
for the navy. This# r essel, so like many
others that have been acquired, *ls of
Urbt draught and excellently fitted far
patrol duty in shallow waters. She is
of 151 tons gross register, 119 feet long
and 20 feet beam. She was built at
Chester, Pa., and her home port is
New York.
It was said at the Navy Department
that no additional information had
been received of the movements of the
Spanish fleets rendezvoused at Cadiz
and at the Cape de Verde Islands.
Every step taken by these fleets is
promptly reported to the department
by the agents abroad. One officer ex
plained that it was very necessary to
receive with the greatest caution re
ports of the ships, as Spain naturally
will try in every way to mislead the
United States.
Most of the vessels of the Asiatic
squadron, which, according to press
d is] latches, is to sail with sealed or
ders, according to the latest published
advices, were rendezvoused at Hong
kong. The squadron is under com
mand of Commodore George Dewey, a
well-known and trusted naval officer,
and is made up of several vessels, ex
cluding the colliers recently purchased
by the department. The Olympia, a
protected cruiser, is the flagship, with
a speed of over twenty-one knots, while
the other ships are the protected cruis
er Baltimore, of twenty knots; the pro
tected cruiser Raleigh, of nineteen
knots; the protected cruiser Boston,
fifteen knots: the gunboat Concord, of
nearly seventeen knots; the gunboat
Petrel, of nearly twelve knots; and the
iron ship Monocacy, of eleven knots.
PRESIDIO MEN
IN A WRECK
Third Section of Their
Train Runs Into a
Freight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL PASO, Texas, April 24.â The third
section of the special Southern Pacific
train engaged for transporting the
First Infantry of the United States
army from the Presidio at San Fran
cisco to New Orleans was wrecked last
night at midnight near Aden, N. Mex.,
fifty miles west of this place. The
third section of the soldiers' special
was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Bisby. It passed Aden at midnight,
seven minutes ahead of time. A west
bound freight had orders to take the
siding at Aden to make way for the
last section, but the soldiers' train
passed the Riding before the freight
reached it and the two trains met in
a head end collision a few rods beyond
the siding.
Neither train was running at a high
rate of speed, but the shock was suffi
cient to wreck both engines, derail sev
tral freight cars and smash a number
of flat cars in the special, which were
loading with ambulances and army
wagons. Many wagons were shattered
Into kindling wood and portions of
others were strewn over the prairie in
the vicinity.
The men on both engines jumped in
time to save their lives, but a man
named Kline, who was stealing a ride
on the freight, was crushed beneath
the debris and died later.
The soldiers were badly shaken, but
none were injured. Their train was de
tained at Aden twelve hours until the
wagons had been replaced on other flat
cars sent out from El Paso and the
track cleared by a wrecking outfit. The
first two sections of the train arrived
here at 2 o'clock last night and lay
over at this point during the entire day
awaiting the third section, which did
no-t arrive until 4 o'clock this afternoon.
The men and officers complained bit
terly against the Southern Pacific, at
tributing the delay to mismanagement
This is the second long delay which
has occurred on the Southern Pacific
since the troops left the Presidio. The
train bearing the Third Artillery, which
preceded the Infantry, was detained
ten hours by a wreck on the same line
at Dragoon Summit. The entire in
fantry force pulled out at 5 o'clock for
New Orleans, with the exception of six
privates, who, while out seeing the
sights, missed the train. The force
passing here to-day numbered 500 men
and about twenty-five officers, under
command of Colonel Evan Miles. |
Nearly all the soldiers have seen serv
ice during the Indian wars.

WAR MEASURES
IN CONGRESS
Formal Declaration the
First Duty of Each
House.
Dingley's Revenue Bill May
Meet Considerable Oppo
sition.
Will Finally Be Passed, Though Dem
ocrats Say They Should Have
Been Consulted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 24.
It is the expectation that the Senate
work this week will begin with the re
ceipt of a message from the President
asking that Congress shall make a
formal declaration of war and that
there will be a quick response to the
request. There has been some appre
hension that there might be a renewal
of the effort to secure a recognition
of the independence of the Cuban in
surgents in connection with the war
declaration, but the best information
now is that this will not be undertaken
and that there will be practically no
opposition in the Senate to a war reso
lution. It is suggested on the part of
some of the members of the Committee
on Foreign Relations that it will not
even be necessary to refer the Presi
dent's message to the committee when
received, but that a resolution can be
Immediately introduced and passed. If
this suggestion should not prove prac
ticable the committee will report
promptly.
The Senate will resume consideration
of the naval appropriation bill at the
earliest possible moment. The only
disputed point undisposed of in connec
tion with the naval bill is the provision
in relation to the price of armor, which
Senators Tillman and Butler are mak
ing an effort to have reduced from $400
to $300, after the three battleships now
building are supplied. Both these Sen
ators and probably others will make
speeches in support of this amendment
and the debate will in all probability
be quite sharp. It does not appear
probable that the amendment will be
accepted by the Senate.
The Senate also will take up the army
reorganization bill as soon as it can be
reached after it is reported from the
Committee on Military Affairs, by
which It will be given prompt consider
ation. The committee will also take
cognizance of -the supposed defects in
the volunteer army bill with a view to
correcting them if found as serious as
reported. This bill has been investi
gated by some of the best lawyers of
the Senate and most of them express
the opinion that it is not defective.
It is not believed that the war reve
nue bill will receive consideration from
the Senate this week, owing to the
probability that it will meet with suffi
cient opposition in the Finance Com
mittee to delay it there for some time.
The Democrats will seek to eliminate
the bond features of the bill and they
may attempt to incorporate a provision
for an income tax when the bill reaches
the committee, and a stubborn contest
is promised both in the committee and
Senate. Whether the bill is amended
in the committee or reported as it
comes from the House, the indications
are quite positive that it will be made
the basis of a prolonged discussion in
the Finance Committee.
If the President sends a message to
Congress to-morrow calling fo*r a decla
ration of war, as is now anticipated,
the response will be prompt and em
phatic. Now that war has been entered
upon even those Congressmen, like Mr.
Johnson of Indiana and Mr. Loud of
California, who have hung tack pro
testing to the last, have sunk their in
dividual ideas in the common cause,
and all are now anxious to give to the
President a united support in every
measure deemed essential, or neces
sary to prosecute the war to a speedy
and successful conclusion. In order to
show the world that all facti mal divi
sions have ceased and that the repre
sentations of the American people are
arrayed in a solid and imposing pha
lanx behind the Chief Executive the
declaration of war will be passed with
out a word of debate and upon the roll
call it is not likely that there will be a
dissenting voice.
Following the declaration of war the
House will proceed to the work of pro
viding the sinews with which to prose
cute it. But upon this there will not be
a unanimity. The Republicans and
Democrats hold widely different views
as to the methods by which the reve
nues to carry on the war should be
raised. No factious opposition, how
ever, will be offered by the minority.
The leaders of the minority are ex
tremely anxious, and they will insist
so far as they are able upon present
ing such substitute propositions as are
in line with their ideas and doctrines
for the bill framed by the Republican
members of the Ways'and Means Com
mittee which Chairman Dingley intro
duced into the House yesterday.
The Democrats of the House and es
pecially the leaders and the members ,
of thi^Waa*?. and. MÂ£ans Committee, I
feel ftssrie?ed. because they have
neither been consulted nor had a voice
in the preparation of the war revenue
measure. In face of a foreign I
enemy they say they have sunk party
consideration and have voted to uphold
the hands of the President, and they i
believe that in realizing war inasmuch
as they are expected to acquiesce they \
should have a share. For the Republi- !
cans to meet in secret and prepare a i
measure strictly according to their own
ideas they maintain is a display of par
tisanship such as should not have been
piven at such a time.
The bill will not be presented to them |
formally until to-morrow morning, and I
Chairman Dingley expects to get it be- j
forÂ» the House during the day. He i
thinks *v,Â« bin should pass and go to I
the Senate by Tuesday night at the lat
est. The Democrats will protest against
this expedition, but will probably not
carry their opposition beyond that.
Mr. Bailey, the Democratic leader, !
and other Democrats realize the nee- j
essity for prompt action, and whlie I
they feel they have been unfairly !
treated under the circumstances they j
will make no factious opposition. They j
are particularly desirous of the oppor- I
tunity to present substitute proÂ»osi- j
tions for various features of the bill as j
prepared. Mr. Bailey said they would
probably be willing to forego general j
debate if an sirranerement could be |
made to consider the entire bill for j
amendment tinder the five-minute rule. ;
The chief amendment they desire to j
offer is for an income tax which they j
believe a considerable proportion of the i
war tax should be raised from this
source. They are also opposed to some
of the pro-isions ,of the stamp tax
which they believe will prove enerous j
and irritating, and it is likely they will
offer propositions in lieu thereof for a I
tax of go cents per barrel on petroleum
and a graduated tax on railroad and !
other transportation tickets, both of
which propositions were considered by
COMMODORE GEORGE DEWEY, U. S. N., Command
ing the Fleet Which is Now on the Way to
i Blockade the Philippines.
[ the Republicans of the Ways and
j Means Committee, but rejected.
There is also considerable opposition
to the bond feature of the bill on the
i Democratic side, and whether with
\ unanimity or . ot, a motion will un
i doubtedly be made to strike it out. Mr.
! Bailey, however, is understood to
! recognize the necessit-' for an authori
zation for borrowing money. Some of
the Populists desire an authorization
for an issue of greenbacks. The bond
feature of the biil will probably be bit
terly attacked.
The whole week in the House Is likely
to be given largely to the consideration
of war measures, but some time will
probably be consumed in disposing of
two election cases and other minor
matters. Possibly the general defi
ciency bill might be taken up before the
week closes.
TO CAPTURE AMERICAN
MILLIONAIRES' YACHTS.
bpanish Craft Will Keep a Sharp
Lookout on the Mediterranean
Sea.
MADRID, April 24.â The decision to
reserve the right to issue letters of
marque is received with satisfaction by
the population in Spanish ports and
toast towns. It is estimated, though it
is difficult to say upon what grounds,
that in a very brief period between 1500
and 2000 corsairs can be equipped ready
for scouring the seas in search of con
traband of war destined for the United
States.
Much indignation is expressed here
over the capture of the Buena Ventura,
which is said to be contrary to the
usages of war, hostilities not having
been openly proclaimed before the ves
sel was taken.
There is a great deal of talk about
keeping a sharp lookout for yachts be
longing to American millionaires,
which, as the Imparcial ingeniously
says, would be worth capturing, as
those in the Mediterranean alone at the
present time represent a value of many
millions. Among them are the Valiant,
Marguerite, Sultan, Nahm and Arctu
rus. Swift vessels belonging to the
Spanish navy are to cruise about the
Straits of Gibraltar, the Suez canal
and the English Channel, so as to make
prizes of any of these yachts that may
attempt to pass through.
Spanish Ironclad Sails.
TOULON, France, April 24.â The old
Spanish iron clad Numanira, which has
been under repairs for months past at
the Lazarine ship yards, started yes
terday for Barcelona under sealed or
ders. Her repairs not being completed
she was towed by the Spanish steamer
Cabonea from Marseilles, starting in
the darkness in order to escape obser
vation.
SPAIN TO
DEPEND ON ,
CRUISERS
Will Not Issue Letters of
Marque, for a Time
at Least.
Madrid Decree Sets Forth the
Rules to Be Recognized by
That Government Dur=
ing the War.
MADRID, April 24.â A royal
decree has been published say
ing Spain maintains her right to
have recourse to privateering,
and announces that for the pres
ent only auxiliary cruisers will
be fitted out. All treaties with
the United States are annulled;
thirty days are given to the
United States ships to leave
Spanish ports, and the rules that
Spain will observe during the
war are outlined in five clauses,
covering neutral flags and goods
contraband of war, what will be
considered a blockade, the right
of search and what constitutes
contraband of war, ending with
saying foreign privateers will be
regarded as pirates.
Continuing, the decree adds:
We have striven with strictest fidelity
to observe the principles of international
law and have shown the most scrupulous
respect for morality and th*> right of
government. There is an opinion that the
fact that we have not adhered to the
declaration of Paris does not relieve
us from the duty of respecting the prin
ciples therein enumerated. The principle-
Spain unquestionably refused to admit
then was the abolition o f . privateering
The Government now considers it most
indispensable to make absolute reserve on
this point in order to maintain our liberty
of action and uncontested right to have
recourse to privateering when we con
sider it expedient.
First, by organizing immediately a
force of cruisers, auxiliary to the Davy,
which will be composed of vessels of our
mercantile marine and with equal dis
tinction in the work of our navy.
Clause 1. The state of war existing oe
tween Spain and the United States annuls
thÂ«- treaty of peace and amity of October
27. 1796, and the protocol of January 12,
1^77 and all other agreements, treaties cr
conventions in force between the f*o
countries.
Clause 2. From the publication of these
presents, thirty days are granted to all
ships of the United States anchored in our
harbors to take their departure free of
hindrance.
Clause 3. Notwithstanding that Spain
has not adhered to the declaration of
Paris, the Government, respecting the
principles of the law of nations, proposes
to observe, and hereby orders to be ob
served, the following regulations of mar
itime law:
1. Neutral flags cover the enemy's mer
chandise, except contraband of war.
2. Neutral merchandise, except contra
band of war, is now seizable under the
enemy's flag.
3. A blockade to be obligatory must be
effective, viz: it must be maintained with
sufficient force to prevent access to the
enemy's littoral.
4. The Spanish Government, upholding
its right to grant letters of marque, will
at present confine itself to organizing,
with the vessels of the mercantile ma
rine, a force of auxiliary cruisers which
will co-operate with the navy according
to the needs of the campaign, and will be
under naval control.
5. In order to capture the enemy's ships
and confiscate the enemy's merchandise
and contraband of war under whatever
form, the auxiliary cruisers will exercise
the right of search on the high seas and
in the waters under the enemy's jurisdic
tion in accordance with international law,
and the regulations of which will be pub
lished.
6. Defines what is included in contra
band of war, naming weapons, ammuni
tion, equipments, engines, and in general
all the appliances used in war.
7. To be regarded and judged as pirates,
with all the rigor o-f the law, are cap
tains, masters, officers and two-thirds of
the crew of vessels which, not being
American, shall commit acts of war
against Spain, even if provided with let
ters of marque, issued by the United
States.
WASHINGTON, April 24.â The Span
ish article published by the Gaceta as
to the attitude of that Government re
garding privateering and the question
whether or not coal shall be held con
traband of war was discussed by the
State Department officials to-day. In
response to questions put to him, Judge
William L. Penfield, the solicitor of the
department, made the following un
official statement, which, he said, is
not to be regarded as indicating in any
way the action and policy of this Gov
ernment, but is given for the informa
tion of merchants and shippers:
This Government has not yet officially
prescribed a list of articles which it will
treat as contraband of war. If Spain has
taken any such action it is not yet made
public.
Each Government is competent to pre
scribe its own list for the guidance of its
own authorities. Such list is conclusive
upon the Government making it and upon
all neutral nations, in the absence of any
disregard of the treaty engagement and
of international law. Any gross disre
gard of such law or treaty obligations
would perhaps provoke the interposition
of any neutral state affected.
Until such list is prescribed the ques
tion whether articles are contraband
of war will be governed gener
ally by the law of nations and specifically
by the treaty stipulations by the bellig
erent captor and the neutral state to
whose subject the articles belong
International law gives no hard-and-fast
rule for the determination of the ques
tion whether articles are contraband ex
cept the general rule that all articles of
an essentially warlike character and des
tined for an enemy's use are contraband
Many articles, such as provisions, coal
etc.. are of an equivocal character, and
if destined for the enemy's use are
deemed contraband.
It follows that if such lists should be
prepared by the United States and Spain
they may be identical or may be widely
divergent, depending on the policy of
each Government. The action of each
Government will bind only itself and its
own prize courts and neutrals. The ques
tion whether contraband or not might
therefore depend upon whether the cap
tor was American or Spanish, and ship
pers in neutral vessels would not only
consider the goods shipped, but whether
destined for American or Spanish ports
and whether the goods are included in
the list denounced as contraband by the
one or the other state.
This Government has already on
nounced that it will not resort to pri
vateering Spain has announced the
same policy. In the light of the previous
declaration~by this Government Spain's
announcement that she will treat our
privateers as pirates is brutum fulmenâ
worthy of Don Quixote. The Spanish
Government has published its Intention
to exercise the right of search. The right
to do so is undoubted. But the right can
be lawfully exercised only for the pur
pose of determining the nationality of
the ship and its destination, whether its
goods are neutral or enemy, whether
contraband or not, and whether its con-,
duct is unneutral or neutral. If Spain
adopts the policy adopted by this
Government that the neutral flag pro
tects the goods if the vessel and its con-
duct are neutral only contraband good.s-^
in such ships are subject to capture. Of
course all merchant ships must respect
an effective blockade on the penalty of
capture and confiscation.
MARCHED WITH HER SON
THROUGH CHICAGO STREETS.
Gray-Haired Woman the Central
Figure in a Pathetic Scene Wit
nessed by Thousands.
CHICAGO, April 24.â A sight fop
Spartan eyes was witnessed here to
day as the first detachment of naval
recruits from Chicago and Milwaukee
marched down the smooth asphalt of
Jackson boulevard to the Pennsylvania
depot, en route for New York to enter
active service. Notwithstanding that
the escort of 500 blue jackets of the Illi
nois Naval Reserve were showing a
faultless drill, while the strains of "The
Star Spangled Banner" were resound
ing from a gorgeously arrayed band,
said to be one of the first outdoor or
ganizations ever gathered in Chicago;
notwithstanding that every man of the
124 recruits was waving a small Ameri
can flag, there was something else that
had greater interest for the crowds of
people that lined the sidewalks in front
of the hotels, clubs, theaters and Board
of Trade. Everybody watched one fig
ure in black.
Right among the marching recruits
and keeping close alongside <>f a strap
ping young fellow in a light ov<
who was carrying a small traveling
grip was a woman of nearly sixty
years. She was dressed in mourr.ing,
and many a hurrah was hushed as peo
ple caught the first glimpse apparently
of a widowed, gray-haired mother per
sonally taking her son Into the rnrk
and file of the boys in blue. She kept
an arm around hint and hec hi .
bowpd, noticing no one else, 1 â¢â â 
twenty other ynmen and girlsâ m"i
ers. wives and sweetheartsâ walk' .
with the recruits, but the attenti.
the spectators followed only the
woman in black until she was lost in
the distance.

ST. VINCENT, Cape de Verde

formed to-day by a naval of leer,
whose position is such that in
formation coming from him may
be taken as absolutely reliable,
that the only reason rW the de
tention of the Jpanish squadron
here is that the admiral has not
yet received his sailing orders
from Madrid.
This strictly confirms the denial
cabled to the Kerald yesterday of the
reports "f a mutiny in the crew and
the machinery of the vessels had
bled. My informant also told
me that the admiral and the other of
s of the squadron were expecting
orders to sail I at almost any
minute. This statement is borne out
by the fact that every vessel has been <
for two days all prepared for a hur- \
ried departure, fires being kept banked, j
Every one in the fort is be-in? made!

BUENOS A.YRES. April 24.â The
Spai un vessel Temerario
is now lyii-g r in the inner

has not steam up and that there
â¢\>> unusual Bigns of activity on

she is noi likely to sail to-day. It
la the general that the Span
ish vessel will not undertake to give
battle to th nited States battle-ship
md gunboat Marietta, wbicn
in thi vicinity on
their way to the United States. The
run t>> the outer roads was
to try the machinery and to give the
k ice run.
The Oregon and Marietta have not
een sighted at Montevideo. Sub
scriptions for war purposes which have
iniiertakon by Spaniards here are
Ing with gooO success. Among the
ribers are many Frenchmen and
us. The Uruguayan Red Cross
â¢y has informed the Ppanish com
mission that it is prepared to send an
expedition to Cuba. The Herald cor
ndent in Rio de Janeiro informs
ri" that 300 Americans there have ex-
pressed a wia t" go as sailors on

f(irm"Â«l by the Spaniards now includes
more than 500 men.
NEW YORK, April 24.â The Wash
ondent of the Herald
dcs being officially informed
to-day that tn Spanish fleet at St.
Vincent was still at that point, the
Navy Department received advices that
the Spanish t< rpedo gun vessel Teme
rario which was reported yesterday to
i g Ayres, had simply
dropped down !h>- roads, and is still,
ntine waters. The
that the Temerario has not put to
rarded as most suspicions by
. :!iid In connection with
the retention of the Spanish fleet at
Verde Islands, in regarded as In
tive of the purpose of tht- Madrid
Government to use the little effort to
..pass, if possible, the destruction
of the American battleship Oregon and
her consort, the gunboat Marietta.
I was told to-day that on account of
the b trail tions between the
United States and Spain during the
past two months, the exportation of
coal from the United States to South
American countries had been greatly
ed, and that there is danger of a
coal famine in Brazil.
Having knowledge of this fact, the
Spaniards, I was told by a member of
th" late legation of Spain before his
departure from the city some 'lays ago,
would lay In wail in force for the Ore
gon oft Cape St. Rogue and give battle
to that vessel and the Marietta as soon
as they were sighted. Of course the
Ish Minister in Brazil will cable
to his Government the arrival and de
parture of American ships, so that
Spain Will be able to gauge the move
ments of her fleet with a view to the
prompt interception of vessels flying
thf- stars and strips.
Th^ report that the Navy Depart
ment was advised by cable yesterday
of the arrival of the Oregon and Mari
etta at Punta Arenas is without foun
â¢ . In the first place, there is no
cable communication with Punta Are
nas, and in the second, the authorities
hrtvf' reason to believe that the Oregon
hns pass"') through the Straits of Ma
gellan and is now on her way up the
Atlantic to Rio. The fact that the in
struction* given to the Oregon and
Marietta required thr-m to meet at
Punta Arenns may have givon rise to
the report of the arrival of vessels
there.
It is the bflipf of officials that the
m v ill b>. able to. take care of her-
Belf, and that the Marietta will assist
in this very noble duty.
Tf it should be found that Minister
I'ryan Is unable to <"'btain sufficient
coal at Rio for the American ships col
liors will bo sent down to the West In
dies to meet them.

between that point and Ja-
> maica, thus entirely severing
communication
between Cuba and the out
side world, except such mat
ters as are sent through the
United States censorship.
This censorship has already
been rigidly established at
Key West. The Government
I has seized the cabie office at
: that point and discharged all
; the operators except one, who
has been put under oah not
to reveal any matter sent
from the fleet to Washington.
Besides this he is closely
watched to prevent his com
municating information to
correspondents. A detail of
marines is constantly on
guard at the cable office. It
is said the censorship will be
extended to Punta Gorda.
Orders have been issued
by the Navy Department to
prevent newspaper boats
from following the fleet, thus
doubling the difficulty of ob
taining accurate information,
as well as greatly delaying it.
The officers and crew of
the captured ship Buena Ven
tura have been given their
liberty after a consultation of
the navy and army officers
at Key West. The captain
and purser, as well as the
crew, were compelled yester
day to shovel coal into the
Helena notwithstanding their
strenuous objections. They
were not held as prisoners of
war, because they were cap
tured on the high seas before
war had been formally de
clared.
Colonel Mac Arthur, chief of
General Wade's staff, to-day
inspected the Plant line
steamers at Port Tampa. At
present the Olivette, Florida
and Margaret are lying there.
As soon as the Mascotte ar
rived this afternoon she was
boarded by officers and thor
oughly examined. Colonel
Mac Arthur expressed himself
satisfied with all the vessels
for transportation purposes.
A large number of refugees
came over from Key West on
the Mascotte, swelling the
large colony already domi
ciled here.
Matters were quite quiet
out at the big soldier camp
to-day. General Wade vis
ited and inspected it, and
issued the first general orders.
A quantity of commissary
and quartermaster supplies
arrived. Work may begin on
an extra warehouse at Port
Tampa at once. Thousands
of citizens took advantage of
Sunday to visit the camp. In
the forenoon religious serv
ices were held. More citi
zens than soldiers attended.
Many officers went to Port
Tampa in the afternoon. In
the evening there were sa
cred concerts by regimental
bands. General Graham,
commanding the Department
of the Gulf, arrived from Key
West on the Mascotte. He
left for the North to-night.
THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 25, 1898.
Bi rdseye View of the Western Half of Cuba and the Adjacent Waters, Showing the Disposition oF the American Fleet,
With Current Incidents of the Situation.
On the left watching the coasts about Matar.zas and Cardenas are the monitors Puritan and Amphltrite with the cruiser Cincinnati and the
Castine. Across the island to the south of the important port of Cienfuegos are the Nashville, Machias and Detroit.
About Havana anil to the west along the Mariel Cabanas and Bahia Honda coasts the main body of the fleet,, including the New York, lowa and
Indiana, under Admiral Sampson's Immediate direction are maintaining a close watch. In the immediate foreground the speedy flagship New York is
shown overhauling a Spanish merchant steamer, while the swift little Ericsson is on the wing as it were to the cable office at Key West with dis
patches. Away in the distance, near the Isle of Pines, is the Mangrove on her way to cut the cables running from Santiago de Cuba to Jamaica and
other points. On he land to the left is General Gomez with his army covering the country to the east of Santa Clara and Cienfuegos, and effectually
blocking the way of communications with the eastern half of the lalan '.
The principal towns and cities held by the Spaniards, of which almost every one Is a "reconcentrado" station, are indicated by small Spanish
flags.
As may be noticed, the coast land on the south side from Cape San Antonio west to Cienfuecos is low and swampy, and that port is the only one
on that side of the west half of the island admitting an-- but very light draught vessels, and is therefore the only one requiring any special attention.
The blockade, as established, shutting, as it does, all the ports connected with Havai.a by rail, is as effectual as if the whole island were in like man
ner encompa sed with war ships.

NEW YORK, April 24.â The "Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
says: Spain's commerce will suffer
from the ravages which the cruisers
Minneapolis and Columbia are expect
ed to make. I learned to-night on ex
cellent authority that the primary
cause of the departure of these two
I commerce destroyers from Hampton
i Roads last night was the ascertaining
â  of the whereabouts of Spanish men-of
war which were reported yesterday as
having left St. Vincent, their destina
'. tion unknown. The commanders of the
Minneapolis and the Columbia are in
structed to capture any Spanish mer
i chantman which they might chance to
meet on their cruise.
The immediate necessity of informa
tion of the location of the Spanish fleet
has been obviated by reason of the fact
that the Navy Department learned this
afternoon from an official source at St.
Vincent that the report of the depart
ure of any of the Spanish vessels was
erroneous. As to the length of time the
cruisers will remain at sea the officials
are silent, but it is generally under
stood that they will not return to port
without having some prizes to show as
a result of the voyage they are now
making.
The work which the Columbia and
Minneapolis have been called upon to
perform is work for which they were
especially constructed â that of scout
ing and preying upon an enemy's com
merce. These vessels are the swiftest
of their class in the world, their triplo
screw design being the suggestion of
Engineer-in-Chief Melville.
HOW ENGLAND WILL
OBSERVE NEUTRALITY.
LONDON, April 24.â 1t is announced
the Prince of Wales held a council yes
terday at Marlborough House on be
half of the Queen, for the purpose of
approving the draft of the neutrality
proclamation. It is supposed that the
proclamation will he strictly in the line
of precedents, calling attention to the i
British foreign enlistment act. etc., and
warning British subjects against block
ade breaking or aiding the belligerents
in any way.
The foreign office will send to the
treasury and the home, colonial and
Indian "offices the usual notice prohib
iting Spanish and American ships the
use of British harbors for warlike pur
poses.
The coaling question will be met by
a provision that belligerents would be
supplied at British ports with no more
coal than is sufficient to carry them to ;
the nearest port of their own country
or some nearer destination, and no
more coal would be supplied to the
same vessel within three months, ex
cept by special permission. Armed
ships will be prohibited from carrying
prizes into British ports, including
those of the colonies.

MADRID, April 24.â There were |
slight demonstrations early this morn- I
ing and again this evening, but they i
were dispersed by Governor Aguilera. j
The one subject of conversation j
throughout the day has been the cap- \
ture of the Buena Ventura prior to a
formal declaration of hostilities or the
lapse of the time limit in the American j
ultimatum. The papers describe it as
an act of piracy.
Many rumors are afloat as to cap- j
tures on both sides. The papers warn
the populace not to be elated or de
pressed by such statements, insisting
that many of them originate on foreign â 
bourses for gambling purposes.
The attitude of the citizens of Madrid
to-day is irreproachable. Several Amer- !
ican correspondents left by the Sunday i
express. Probably the fact that the j
Cabinet Council was held in the morn- i
ing instead of this afternoon, as had |
been arranged, means that news has i
been received necessitating prompt ac
tion, but nothing has been divulged to
the public.
Advices have been received from j
Manila. Philippine Islands, to the ef- i
feet that when news was received there
of the sailing of the American squad- i
ron from Hongkong an imposing popu- J
lar demonstration took place, all classes \
offering their property and lives in de- !
fense of the country. The_ enthusiasm |
is described as "tremendous."
Rumors are being circulated that the
Philippine filibusters are co-operating j
with the American squadron, but there i
is no official confirmation of them.
GOMEZ TO DO MOST OF
THE LAND FIGHTING.
WASHINGTON, April 24.â Secretary
Sherman said to-day that it was his
expectation that for the present and
the immediate future the insurgent
army would do the greater part of the
fighting in Cuba. He added the state
ment that there was no intention of
taking the militiamen and new re
cruits into Cuba until thoroughly in
ured to the hardships of actual mili
tary life, and that probably the regu
lars would be held in this country un
til later in the season.
The Secretary expressed the opinion
that Admiral Sampson's fleet would
take the first opportunity to form a
junction with Gomez' army, and that
thenceforth there would be perfect co
operation between those two organiza
tions in conducting the war against
the common enemy.
"The insurgents are the best men for
this service at present," said the Sec
retary, "and they can be trusted to do
serious work when well armed and
well clpthed."

FORT MONROE, April 24 (on board

enemy Commodore Schley of the flying
squadron has issued a practical censor
ship over those in his command relative
to the divulging of the reason for any ;
movements made or to be made by the

responsibility is thus minimized.
Sunday here passed very quietly.
The Maryland resLM'ves, â who are to
man the Yosemite and Dixie, arrived
by boat early this morning. The two
converted boats will be ready in a day
or two, being at Newport News yards
undergoing improvements.
When the Maryland reserves passed '
the Brooklyn they cheered heartily.
The Sioux, a converted tug under
command of Lieutenant Gherardi, and
which mounts several rapid fire guns,
left the ship and the men c-n board the
Brooklyn gave her a hearty cheer as
she passed out. The hospital boat Sol
ace left Newport News for Norfolk,
where she will take on medical stores.
To-night the precaution was begun j
of putting out a patrol fleet of steam ;
cutters fully equipped to- fight and to
give warning if any enemy appeared.
The work of strengthening the forti

day with a large working force, as did
also the work of laying mines in the

KINGSTON, Jamaica, April 24.â 0n
the steamship Ely which arrived herÂ»
from Cuba was Alfredo Triay, United
States Consul at Paracao, for whose
safety fears have been expressed. With,
Mr. Triay were his wife and two chil
dren and several other foreigners,
mostly Cubans. By request of thÂ«
United States Consul here, Mr. Dent,
the local government released the Ely
from quarantine. She came up tho
harbor at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
Among her thirty-one passengers wera
Mr. Branet, a naturalized American, of
Branet & Co. of Guantanamo, and hi 3
family. Of the Cubans aboard the prin
cipal ones were Senora and Senorita
Brooks, relatives of the head of the firm
of Brooks & Co. of Chilbos.
When the Ely reached Guantanamo
on Firday morning Brooks & Co.
chartered her, erbling to .bowringr &.
Archibald of New York and paying
$1000. The Ely left the same evening
at 8 o'clock. Spanish officials made no
opposition to the departure of the
refugees, but the populace was angry.
There were demonstrations and crowds
paraded the streets shouting "Viva
Espana," drawing American flags
through the mud and pelting them witli
dirt and stones. The passengers left
without passports.
The adjacent town and ports of San
tiago de Cuba have been evacuated
and all troops have been concentrated
in Santiago. Mr. P.ranet says Chat
some Americans connected with the
mines may still be left in Santiago, but
they in all probability sailed on the
Juragua Company's steamer, which, it
is expected, may touch at Porto An
tonio. Two English steamers from
New York were expected to touch
shortly after the Ely left at Guan
tanamo and Santiago.
Great activity has been shown by the
Spanish in Santiago in preparing de
fenses. The Spanish are drafting
troops there to go to Havana. Two
boats were to leave with regiments on
April 21.
The refugees will remain here for
the present. The British war vessel

NEW YORK. April 24.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Secre
tary Alger a: d Major General Miles,
commanding the army, were at the
War Department for several hours to
dcy, attending t< the details of army
organization. All chiefs of bureaus,
â¢with nmst of their assistants, were in
their offices the entire day, many of
them working late into the evening to
facilitate the work of Increasing and
equipping the military force.
Assistant Secretary of War Meikle-
John, Adjutant General Corbin and offi
cials of the adjutant general's and
Judge adovcate general's offices, were
engaged all day in perfecting regula
tions of the department regarding en
listments in the volunteer army, necessi
tated by President McKinley's procla
mation calling for 125.000 troops. The
officials have been besieged with U-le
grams from State officers and mem
bers of the National Guards, requesting
further enlightenment on the interpre
tation of the new volunteer army law.
Many of th^so telegrams give evidence
of a general objection on the part of
the National Guards to becoming a
part of the army fur the occupation of
Cuba, if they cannot retain their pres
ent identity in the organization.
Secretary Alger <? expected to issue
to-morrow rul.s and regulations of the
department, which will govern the en

of States will each be addressed in a
Utter from the Secretary of War stat
ing the authority and the object of

the regular army poets will be used as
recruiting Btations.
All volunteers who present them
selves at recruiting stations will
subject to the regular medical examin

by the department prescribed for re

Those who pass this examination will
be furnished transportation to camps
of concentration, where they will l>e

National guarlsmen who volunteer will
necessarily sever their connection with
their State organizations. This will
not prevent entire companies and regi

provided each member of the organi
sations can pass the necessary examin
ation for entrance into the United
States service. Enlistments, however,
â will all be individual and the muster-
Ing in of whole companies or regiments
Will be done by United States officers
only as a concession to the wishes of
men who may desire to serve with
those with whom they have been iden

VALENCIA, April 24.â T0-day's war
demonstration here surpassed in
strength and in patriotic enthusiasm
anything witnessed in this country
within the memory of man. The city
turned out en masse. More than 100,000
person? of all classes â the poorest and
the richest, side by sideâmarched
under thousands of national flags
to swell the note c-f fierce defiance
to what is termed American aggression
which now vibrates throughout the
land. The gentle se::, arrayed in the
classic mantilla and decked with
flowers and ril-bons of national colors,
outrivalled their brothers in bellicose
ardor.
Some venerable relics of Spain's past
glories figured in the procession. Among
them was the standard that was borne
before Don Jaime, the Conqueror, when
he besieged and took Valencia from the
Moors nearly seven 3nturles ago, and
a fac simile of the f!ag carried by T^ti
Juan de Aupt ' â  at the memorable
battle of Lepanto.
The most conspicuous mottoes were:
"War to the and No Quarter";
"Long Live Privateering," and "Don't
Buy Anything From the English."
The dry basin of an ornamental foun

UNITED STATES HAS
NOT SEIZED HAWAII
WASHINGTON, April 24.â The report that Admiral Miller has seized the Hawaiian Islands and
raised the American flag by order of the President is denied in the highest official circles. At the Navy
Department it is said that such a course would be extremely unwise in that it would add to the responsi
bilities of the United States the necessity of nrotecting the islands. They are now neutral territory, and
Great Britain and Japan would certainly join in maintaining them as neutral. There is no doubt of the
strong friendship of the Hawaiian Government for the United States or the willingner of President Dole
and his Cabinet to welcome a seizure. But it is regarded that seizure would be a poor strategic move, and
it has not even been advised by prominent navy officials. It is further authoritatively sta'ed that Admiral
Miller will return to the United States in a very short time and assume command of the Pacific Coast
squadron. *

ON BOARD THE FLAGSHIP NEW
YORK, OFF HAVANA, April 23â
(Filed at Key West, midnight, April
23).â The Puritan, Nashville, Marble
head and Ericsson arrived from Key
West this m< rning. The Ericsson al
! most immediately returned to Key
West with dispatches. At 10 o'clock
â  this morning the monitor Puritan, the
j cruiser Cincinnati, the gun boats
1 Machias, Nashville. Castine and New
! port and the iorpedo boats Root and
' Winslow left the squadron to blockade
j Matanzas, Mariel and Cardenas. They
formed separate divisions, and after
â  they had passed out of sight the re
'; malner of the fleet took up a regular
I formation, having drifted some fifteen
; miles from Morro Castje. The general
j advance was made at half speed. Cap
. tain Evans, not quite certain of the po
i sition he was entitled to take with the
j lowa, caught v-> abreast of the flagship
i and shouted through the megaphone:
"How near may I go?"
Rear Admiral Sampson, who was
standing on the after bridge, replied:
"As -near as you can without damage
from the fire of the batteries."
"All right." Captain Evans shouted
! back, in tones that expressed the keen
est disappointment. The lowa then
j went ahead.
About a half hour after the squad
j ron was well under way, the cruiser
I Cincinnati was seen on the eastern
horizon, smoke pouring from her fun
| nels. She had been headed for Matan
j zas. and evidently had turned back to
; chase some vessel. The object of her
| pursuit was soon made out, standing
veil in toward the coast. The flagship,
the cruiser Marblehead and the gun
boat Wilmington immediately turned
out of the course to head the warship
off. The remainder of the squadron
proceeded to the westward. Smoke
poured from our ships. The flagship
was making eighteen knots, the whole
j vessel throbbing with the vibrations of
! her twin screws. The little Wllmlng
i ton steamed up in splendid style, and
j the fast cruiser Marblehead kept nearly
I abreast. The formidable trio bore
1 down upon the warship. Then a shout
"She is a Spaniard."
For the next ten minutes the excite
ment was intense. The distance which
separated the vessels rendered it im
possible to make out the warship's
identity. She was thought to be the
Vizcaya or the Oquendo, heading hard
for Havana. The men at the puns
phouted with glee. The stokers off duty
also cheered vociferously and begged
to be allowed to go on deck to help
shoot at the first armed enemy met.
The officers crowded on the quarter
deck as elated as the men, though un
der better comtrol. The bugler blew
"general quarters," and all hands flew
to their posts. Down came the shrouds
with a rattle. Life lines vanished from
the d<v k. Rear-Admiral Sampson,
standing on the bridge, said deliberate
ly to Captain Chad wick:
"Yes, the Oquendo or the Vizcaya,"
and then added: "I should like to bag
them both."
Then it was seen that the chase was
flying an Italian flag. But this was no
proof that behind her still invisible
guns Spaniards were not concealed,
ready to shoot under advantage of
subterfuge. All the guns on the New
York's port side and in the forward and
after turrets were trained on the stran
ger. A few minutes later, when about
1500 yards separated the New York
from her target, the American flag was
run up by the warship and then it was
known she was not a Spaniard. A puff
of smoke issued from her sides and
the boom of a gun Rounded across the
waters. It was only a salute, but at
first many on board thought Rear-Ad
miral Sampson had been deceived. Rut
she fired one of her guns as a salute,
which was returned by the flagship,
whlrh also flew an Italian flag.
The stranger was then made out to
be the Giovanni Bausan. a powerful
cruiser. Without further formalities
she pursued her course and entered Ha
; vcina harbor.
Thus an exciting incident ended in
disappointment, but it served to show
how anxious all hands are for a real
fight, and how splendid the discipline is
when a conflict seems imminent.

CHATTANOOGA, Term., April 24.â
All roads led to Chickamauga to-day.
The national park where â were en
camped nearly 8000 of the United
States regular troops was the loadstone
which drew thousands of people from
all the surrounding country and for
the day nearly depopulated Chat
tanooga. Even before sunrise the
stream of humanity had started toward
the park, and by afternoon fully 50,000
people were scattered through the vast
grounds watching the incoming soldiers
unload and march to their as
signed camping places, and noting with
interest the different phases of a sol
dier's life on the field. Kodak fiends
by the score were there and took snap
shots at every opportunity.
The long Government road leading
from Chattanooga out through Ross
ville and Ross Gap to the park was
fairly choked with vehicles all day.
Excursion trains brought in thousands
from Nashville, Memphis, Cincinnati.
Atlanta, Huntsvllle, Ala., and all the
Intermediate towns and villages. It be
ing Sunday all drills were suspended,
and the soldiers, who were fairly \vell
settled in their camping places, had
little to do but lounge around. Around
the railroad yards it was a busy scene.
The arrivals of troops during the day
were heavy, but very few delays OÂ£
curred on this account.
The Eighth Infantry from Fort Rus
sell, Wyoming, 500 men, under Colonel
Van Horn, which were among last
night's arrivals, were switched out to
the park about noon. They were fol
lowed by seven companies of the
Eighth Infantry, which are from Fort
Logan, Colorado. This regiment con
sisted of about 550 men, and was com
manded by Colonel Benham. With the
Eighth Infantry it was assigned a
I camping place in a field to the east of
I "Bloody Pond."
Late in the afternoon an escort of
colored cavalry came in. They were
followed by eight companies of tho
Seventh Infantry, which arrived from
Fort Douglass, near Salt Lake City,
with 164 men and officers, under com
mand of Colonel J. F. Kent. Many
troops are expected in to-morrow morn
ing, including the First Infantry from
| the Presidio and Benicia barracks, Cali
i fornia, the Second Infantry from the
Montana posts and Batteries C and F,
Third Artillery, from the Presidi >. By
to-morrow it is expected that close to
10.000 solidiers will b. located at the
park. Nearly the entire colored popula
tion of Chattanooga and the country
around was apparently gathered
around the camping places of the Ninlh
and Tenth Cavalry and the Twenty
fifth Infantry. The latter was the
special object of homage.
The Twenty-fifth had religious serv
ices during the afternoon in the open
air. The eh: lain, Rev. Theopilus
Steward, preached a short sermon to
the assembled sable-colored warriors,
the regimental band fur:.ishing the
music.
A striking incident occurred at the
close of the services. The band struck
up "My Country, 'Tls of Thee." and
instantly every soldier was on his feet
with his hand raised in salute, wh?>
from hundreds of dusky throats the
grand words of the American natinvU
song poured out. The throngs of people
lingering near ook up the refrain. The
staff of Major-General Brooke is now
complete, and by to-morrow all de
partments will be located at the park.

adier-General William R. Shafter, com
manding the U 'ted States troops

It is understood his visit to Wash

I learn that the administration has
under consideration a plan for the im

Cuban port from which communica
tion may be had with the insurgents.
To garrison and ' old this port and the
adjacent country it will be necessary
to send t > Cuba an army of about 15,000
or 18,000 men. This force would consist
of two divisions, each to be com
manded by a major-general. It is
stated that if this plan is adopted one
of the major-generalships of volunteers
will be given to General Shafter and
the other to -irigadier-General Elwell
S. Otis, former j commanding the de
partment of Colorado, and that these
officers will direct the first military op

General Shafter would command the
expedition. Constant communication
wuuld be kept up between the gulf

Washington, April 24.
Secretary Lcng has received from
Rear-Admiral Sampson dispatches
telling of the capture of several of the
Spanish merchantmen, which are to be
held as prizes and to be disposed of ac
cording to !avv if the protests made
against such seizures are held to be
without ground. Judge Advocate Gen
eral Lemley. the law officer of the'
Navy Department, has been looking
up the statutes on the subject, and is
prepared to assist the Secretary in any
way necessary. The law provides that
the condemnation proceedings in tht
matter of prize vessels shallbeconduct
ed under the supervision of the Dis
trict Courts. It is made the duty of
the commanding officer of the vessel
making a capture to secure the docu
ments of the ship and cargo, and send
them, together with certain witnesses
from the captured vessel, to the Dis
trict Court in which the proceedings
for the distribution of the prize money
are to be had. The attorney for the
United States is to promptly file a
libel against the prize property and
take other proceedings necessary.
The evidence is to be taken by prize
commissioners, not exceeding three in
number, one of whom is to be a naval
officer, and at least one of the others a
member of the bar of not less than
three years' standing and acquainted
with the taking of depositions. If the
sale of. the prize is ordered the gross
proceeds are ' to be deposited with the
Assistant Treasurer of the United
States at the place nearest to the sal 6.
subject to the orders of the court. The
court is to make a decree of distribu
tion, determining what vessels are to
share in the prize, and whether the
prize was of superior, equal or inferior
force to the vessel or vessels making
the capture. The net proceeds of all
property condemned as prize shall,
when the prize was of superior or equal
force to the vessel or vessels making the
capture, be decreed to the captors.
This provision was evidently put in the
law with a view to encouraging ves
sels' captains to exert their greatest
effort when meeting a foe of superior 01
equal strength, as the same section of
the law provides that when the prize
vessel was of inferior force to the cap
tors one-half of the net proceeds is to
be decreed to the United States and
the other half to the captors. In cases
where the amount In controversy ex
ceeds $2000 an appeal may be taken to
the Supreme Court.
PHILIPPINE
INSURGENTS
ARE ACTIVE
TACOMA, Wash., April 24.âHong
kong 1 advices received to-day, per
steamer Braemer to Astoria, state that
the present Philippine Island rebellion
is rapidly spreading to all important
provinces. A month ago the insurgent
leaders and their sympathizers in
Hongkong came to the conclusion that
the United States would soon be at war
with Spain. They have accordingly
been preparing to strike Spanish rule
in the Philippines to the quick when
the most favorable time should arrive.
The situation at Manila Is described as
almost one of consternation. Spanish
merchants, half castes and rich na
tives are selling out and leaving Ma
nila and other seaports. Some of the
latter sympathize with the insurgents
and will aid them from Hongkong and
Amoy.
The establishment of a Philippine
Junta at Hongkong is probable, such a
plan being under consideration. It
practically exiÃts now tinder the man
agement of General Aguinaldo and
other leaders, who were hired to leave
the Islands in January. The excessive
taxation offers one excuse for the pres
ent outbreak. All the natives are re
fusing to pay the increased taxes levied
in order to pay off the immense debt
Incurred in crushing the last rebellion,
ending three months ago. Zambales,
Tarlac and Pangasinan and adjoining
provinces are in open revolt, and emis
saries have been sent into the southern
provinces.
Last month the Insurgents made a
renewed attack upon the Spanish
camps at Apalit and Subig, defeating
the Spanish troops and capturing a
large quantity of arms, ammunition
and supplies. In the north of Luzon
some insurgents were captured and or
dered executed. The rebels gathered
quickly and rescued their comrades.
The victorious insurgents then proceed
ed to Bollnao, where they cut the
Spanish cable and destroyed the lana
lines connecting the cable station with
Manila. This has greatly interfered
with Manila's business and had the
important result of demonstrating that
the insurgents were again able to go
about and do as they pleased. The in
surgent leaders greatly hope that the
United States will aid them to secure
independence as one means of punish
ing Spain. A month ago there were
five Spanish cruisers, five small gun
boate and three troop ships at Manila,
and the Spanish cruiser Reina Cris
tina at Amoy.
PLOT TO RAID
DAWSON STORES
Tale of a Daring Con

a Klondiker.
Says Roughs at Circle City
Have Organized a Rob

Was Compelled to Taka Their Oath
but Succeeded in Making His
Escape.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, April 24.â 0. S. Cham
berlain of Austin, Texas, who -was a
passenger from Skaguay on the
steamer Ningchow, tells an extraordi
nary story of a secret society formed
by a crowd of the rough element of
Circle City with the avowed object of
raiding the stores of the North Ameri
can Trading and Transportation Com
pany and the Alaska Commercial Com
pany at Dawson.
Chamberlain says he left Circle City
about ten weeks ago, and two weeks
prior to leaving he was approached by
two men who lived in the cabin ad
joining his and asked if he would not
like to join a crowd which had a
scheme for making a big haul. In an
swer to all his queries as to what the
scheme was the two would say nothing
more than "wait and you'll see."
The night following they came into
his cabin and took him to Lidstone's
saloon. He was conducted into a room
at the rear, and there he found about
twenty desperate-looking characters.
One, whose name was given as Corey,
announced himself to Chamberlain as
the leader of the society, and asked him
if he knew what would happen to him
if he broke his oath. In reply he said
he had taken no oath.
"Well, you will," said the leader.
"Hold up your hands."
Chamberlain demurred, demanding
an explanation, but on seeing several
revolvers pointed at him, he put up his
hands. The leader then repeated an
oath, which Chamberlain says was, aa
near as he remembers, as follows:
"You, who are about to join the
Raiders, promise that you will render
every assistance in our scheme and
that you will not divulge what you will
hereafter Jiear."
Chamberlain then put down his
hands and the "scheme" was explained
to him as follows: The society was to
go to Dawson, and at night, when only

Chamberlain left hurriedly soon af

SANTA BARBARA'S MAYOR
TALKS OF DEFENSE.
Believes His Town Should Be Pro
tected Against Attacks by
Spanish Craft.
SANTA BARBARA, April 24.âYes
terday Mayor Burke -wired the Gover
nor, asking that two 6-inch disappear
ing guns and a suitable number of
small arms be shipped to Santa Bar
bara for the defense of the place. Mr.
Burke is the first municipal magistrate
in the State to call for an armament
for defensive purposes. In convers-tion
to-day he said:
"We are at war with one of the mon
archies of the Old World: there ia no
longer any question about it. The time
for action has arrived, and while we
are far removed from the scene of hos
tilities, the fact remains that port San
ta Barbara is in a defenseless condi
tion. Realizing that the Channel City
affords excellent opportunities for the
encroachments of Spanish privateers, I
deemed it important to communicate
with Governor Budd and make an
effort to secure armament. I asked for
two 6-inch disappearing guns, other
pieces of ordnance and 250 stands of
arms. I fully appreciate the serious
ness of warfare; yet, inasmuch as the
United States and Spain have actually
begun hostilities, naught now remains
but that every citizen of this republic
should do his utmost to vindicate her
honor and punish treachery.
"Xot all can take the field, but pa
triotism finds a way for the humblest
citizen to lend some aid in the!impend
ing conflict. In a perilous time like
this an unprotected seaport like Santa
Barbara should be provided with a
means of defense. At present the
proper course to pursue would be the
mounting of ordnance on Dlblees Hill
and Booths Point, both of which over
look the channel.
"As we have several hundred able
bodied men r^ady to arm and drill, we
need have no uneasiness after we re
ceive from the Governor arms and per
| mission to organize. With two compa
nies of home guards and three heavy
! guns no privateer would be able to ef
j feet a landing here. In my judgment
! similar action should be taken by
: other coast towns in this State.
"Our proposition was promptly trans
mitted by his Excellency, the Governor,
to Adjutant-General A. W. Barrett,
; and we believe that it will be favorably
: acted upon. We have in this city many
; ex-officers and soldiers who are ready,
! able and willing to prepare for the de-
I fense of Santa Barbara. Old warriors
consider it not unlikely that Spanish
privateers may be fitted out on this
j coast in some South American port. We
expect that a division of the State
militia will be stationed here, and it
! Will be the province of home guards to
j support it."

A gentleman, whose business is a constant strain upon
his nerves, relates that one night recently he was unabie
to sleep. On previous occasions he had observed a bene-
fit arising from the use of Ripans Tabules. On this
particular occasion, believing that heroic measures were
necessary, he took three. The result was really surpris-
ing. The effect was as quieting as though the medicine
had contained a narcotic, which every one knows it does
not. There was an immediate feeling of ease, rest and
quiet, extending in a few minutes over the entire system,
and sleep came as naturally as to a child.

FASTEST OF THE SEASON.
The Colts Deieat Bunker's
Team in a Hysterical
Game.
One day during the season of 1890, Oak- !
land and San Francisco met at the j
Haight-street grounds In a game that
seemed likely to give the winner a de- j
cided advantage In the California League
race. There was a big crowd present,
and more fireworks were touched off that I
day than w< re ever exploded on a Cali
fornia diamond. Both teams surpassed
themselves, and they had both â  gives
ample evidence many times before that
they could play bait Ordinary doubles
and triples were shortened into singles or
plucked from the clouds by outfielders;
basehits were devoured and turned into
acrobatic ats that could be Been in half I
a dozen three-ring circuses. The sc Â«i c |
was tied and untied until the spectators
wore in a frenzy, and when tne game
finally terminated with the Oaklands one
run to ' the erood there threatened to be ;
a general uprisl
That game was duplicated yesterday at
Recreation Park. Its equal has not been i
seen on the Pacific Coast for years. Of
late people have gone to ball games with
the feeling that If they could become In- i
terested enough to remain till the end
they were satisfied.
Only one man left the grounds yester
day until Lee let in the winning run In
the last half of the ninth by dropping ;
Hardio's fly, and he escaped to avoid a ;
threatened attack of heart failure.
To enumerate the â  atures would neces- :
Bitate a description of almost every play i
made during the game, but perhaps the
episodes that aroused the greatest en- ;
thusiasm was a double play in the sixth
Inning that would have i>een a triple had
the ball not been eked out of Stroeck
er'B hands. It was like this:
Russell was safe on a line drive which
Trenberth blocked but could not hold. :
Schmeer and . sklman were given bases
on balls, filling the corners. Peters tired
a projectile which Wheeler handled,
though it most lifted him off his feet to
do so, and returned it to Stroecker, nail
ing Russell at the plate. The catcher
drove the ball to tirst and cut off Peters.
Meantime Schmeer had been streaking It
from second, and when the ball started
for lirst he had rounded the turn for ;
home. Murphy saw him coming, and the i
ball hardly struck his pocket before It
â¢was on its way back to the plate. Stroeck
or was ready for it. but ju.st as the ball ;
reached him Schmeer arrived, head first,
Jarring him bo that he dropped the bail,
and the runner scored the lirst tally for
Oakland. Donovan's single scored Mos- I
klman.
That is only a sample of the goods of
fered. While: five errors are charged
against each team they were all of the
hardest brand. Not a point wa-s over
looked, every man lighting the best he
knew how. Hughey Smith looked as if
he needed the ambulance to carry him
horn*- when he had finished his job of
umpiring. Almost every decision he gave
was disputed by one team or tne other, as
a rule without the slightest pretext,
though a- few times his judgment on balls
and strikes may have been questioned
with propriety, In the la-st half of the
ninth it looked as if there was going to
bo a riot when Hughey sent two Oakland
runners, who had advanced a base, back
to their original stations. But he was
right about it and llnally succeeded in
quelling the disturbance.
Schmi r -r opened up with a single and
Bwett, who was back of the pitcher, or
dered Stroecker to brush the dirt off the
plate, suspending play in the meantime,
While this was being done, Wheeler shot
the ball to second to catcli Bchmeer, but
throw high and both runners moved up.
Smith properly held that the game was
suspended and ordered the runners back
despite the ki< king of the entire Oakland
team. The < Ision did not affect the re-
Bult though, for Oakland managed to win
out with something to spare, though at
the time the Colts were two runs behind.
The red (ire began t" glow when Alona
ban stepped to the plate in the first in
ning. The best be could do was to strike
out. Then, when ECrug went out on
O'Neil's asslsi to first and Murphy flew
to Bchmeer, the spectators began to real
ize there was trouble In store for Bun
ker's men.
Donovan worked Wheeler for a base,
but when Connelly did his great hurdle
a<-t and annexed O'Nell'a fly that ought
to have been good for two bases the
crowd began to yap. Lange's grounder to
Monahan and out at first put Donovan
on second, and he went to third on a
passed ball. It looked like a tally when
the prodigy came up, but Wheeler made
a monkey of him.
The leaders went out in one, two, three
order again, while the colts got a man as
far as second, but a lightning double play
settled his hope of completing the cir
cuit. Shea sent a long fly to Connelly,
which was duly stamped and Russel
dropped the ball in front of the plate and
beat It to first. Bchmeer was given lis
base and Moskiman settled it by sending
a liner over short that seemed good for
three bases. But Trenberth went un in
the air and pulled it down, then sent the
ball to second before Russell could make
a move to get back to the bag it was
a beautiful double play and it set the
crowd wild.
Frisco broke the ico In the third lnnine
Trenberu. and Stroecker were given their
bases and Monahan bunted and beat the
ball to first, after Wheeler had gone out
on a fly to Hardie, who returned the ball
before either runner could move up. Krug
sent a grounder to first and was retired,
but Trenberth scored. Murphy was as
sisted out at first by Schmeer.
Oakland was again robbed of a run by
the daring work of the Friscos, and
neither side accomplished anything in the
fourth, .though Hardie reached third for
Oakland before anybody was out. His
associates could not help him over the
plate, however.
Frisco took two in the fifth. Wheeler
marl- a scratch hit and went to second
on Monahan'a long fly to Shea. Krug
sacrificed him to third and Murphy sin
gle sent him home. Donovan muffed
Hearty's high fly, and while the Oak
lands stood lost in astonishment Murphy
sneaked around home.
Two more in the sixth, and it began
to look as though Frisco had a cinch.
Then Oakland began Its run getting, tak
ing two. as has been described, whon
Stroecker failed to complete a triple play. |
In the seventh Frisco got one more i
run. Krug: was hit by the ball, stole ,
second and scored on Hearty's single, j
Then Oakland took the lead by scoring
five run*.
Lange was given his base, and Hardin j
hit for two bans. Trenbarth fumbled .
Shea's grounder, allowing Lange to score.
Russell drove Hardie across the plate
with a single to right, Schmeer hit to
Trenberth. and Shea was caught at the
plate. McKinnon flew to I.e. Russell
scoring on the throw in. Then Peters
laced out a triple, sending Schmeer in.
and he followed a moment later on Don
ovan's single. O'N'eil's grounder forced
Donovan at second. y---.
Nothing was done in the eighth, but
Frisco again took the lead in the ninth,
and looked like a sure winner for a time.
Monahan was given his base, and took
second on a short passed ball. Krtig hit
to short and beat the ball to first, Mona
han going to third. Both scored on Mur
phy's double and O'Neil's error of Hear
ty'fl drive let Murphy In. The next three
batters went out in order, and Oakland
went to bat badly handicapped, for their
â weakest stickers were up. At least it
was supposed so. but Schmeer and Mos
kiman led off with singles. Then, after
the dispute with the umpire. Peters got
soaked in the slats, filling the bases.
Schmeer started home on a short passed
ball but gave it up. tried to get back, i
and' was caught at third. . Donovan was
also hit by the Ditcher, and the bases
were tilled again. O'Nell hit to Krug,
and Moskiman beat the ball home.
Lange's single sent Peters in and tied the
j score while pandemonium reigned. Har
dlt sent out a high fly, which Lee dropped
after a hard run, and Donovan tallied the
winning run.

CENTRAL PARK.
For ten Inning? yesterday San Francisco
and Oakland struggled for supremacy at
Central Park. Both teams played as if
it were the deciding game In the series,
and the fair crowd which attended was
mated to the really first good game on
the grounds this season. Krrors were
plentiful on both sides, but this was due
to the heavy hittinp. Both- Johnson and
Eapan pitched steady ball and were
touched up hard and often.
In the seventh the score stood Beven to
seven, and for the next two innings
neither side could tally. In the tenth
Croll dropped Sweeney's fly and the run
ner took second on Eagan's wild throw
to catch him napping at first, and scored
on Gosllnsky's high throw to Brockhoff.
Croll opened for Oakland by singling to
left. Eagari ripped out a corker to Kro
gan, who ran backward and nailed it
with his left hand and then threw to
Johnson to double Croll. and was entirely
successful. The play created a sensa
tion md won the game for San Fran
cisco.

between Fresno and Sacramento was the
best exhibition of ball playing seen here
this season. In the ninth inning the
score stood 3 to 3. but the Sacramentos
took exception to the ruling of the umpire
and refused to go on with the game. The
umpire gave six minutes for the Giants
to play, and at the end of that time gave
the game to Fresno by a score of 9 to 0.
The decision bf the umpire was obviously
correct. Fresno bad one man out and
Tawney on llrst, Thomas knocked a pop
fly which was not caught. Tawney tried
to make second, hut returned to first.
The umpire called the batter out and the
runner safe. Tawney was not touched
by the ball, hence ho was not out.
Thomas, Fresno's new pitcher, was in
fine trim and pitched a great game. Pitts
for Sacramento also did splendid work in
the box. Fresno put up an errorless
game, while Sacramento made but one
error. Snyder made some grandstand
running catches, while McHale for Sac
ramento also took In everything in center
garden for Sacramento. Moore and
Courtney accepted several difficult
chances. The scpra was a-s follows:

Athletics Sustain a Crushing
Defeat at the Hands of
San Jose.
SAN JOSE, April 24.â The ineffective
ness of Fltzpatrick's pitching, together
with poor support, caused the downfall of
the Athletics of San Francisco to-day.
The score was 11 to 4 In favor of San
Jose. The visitors played like school
boys, and at no stage of the contest were
in the game. Hanley's sensational one
hand catch was the finest ever seen on
the local grounds. Ed Smith was in

favor of Pliil Knell. The score:

GOOD COURSING
AT TWO PARKS
The Talent Suffered and
Others Were Glad
of It.
Fast Hares and Fleet Hounds
Amused Large Crowds of
Enthusiasts.
A Great Improvement Can Easily Be
Seen because of Attention Paid
to Breeding.
When the talent dropped at Ingleslde
Coursing Park yesterday afternoon the
thud could be heard for two blocks. Fav
orite after favorite went down to some
fleet neglected ones, and in consequence
those who rely on the small money to
carry them through the day successfully
were elated at their unexpected success.
As was predicted in The Call, Patria was
not able to carry through the work of the
day although a strong play was made
on the well-bred hound
The crowd was something out of the
ordinary, ad it was almost Impossible to
pass from one end of the grounds to the
other. Money was "loose" the entire day,
and the pool boxes had all they could do
to handle what was put over the counter.
Flrenza was one of the good things which
was Badly neglected by the form players,
and should have won the course with Koo
Lawn had it not been for a bad fall when
victory seemed inevitable. The Sapling
stake also brought forth some surprises,
especially when Trinket went under, but
In the present days of coursing It is hard
to guess the winners when brer-ding Is so
carefully watched by all owners and en
thusiasts. ,
Flrenza and Patria had two no poes.
but in the third the white flyer won after
a rather spirited struggle. Bach time
Patria would load to the hare, but the
superior work of Firenza would show up
to great advantage in the workout.

pion stake, limited to twenty-four entries,

Coffey-, of the Probate Department,
Henry Sutliff. a oisdr dealer at 832
K.amy street, would be mourning the
lops of the contents of his till, and John
Clark, a young man with a penchant for
stealing, would still be at liberty.
Clark, In company with two accom
plices, visited the cigar store occupied by
| Sutliff, and while two of them engaged
i th<> proprietor in front of the store, Clark
sneaked behind the counter and was bus
ily occupied In robbing the till. At this
juncture Judge Coffey and Nephew Jerry
entered, causing Clark to suspend opera
tions and conceal himself under the coun
ter. Seeing that his chances of escaping
were curtailed by their presence, Clark
I boldly stepned from his concealment and
! started to walk to the door. His move
ments aroused suspicion in the minds of
i.ncle and nephew and they warned Sut
liff. As soon as Clark reached the side
walk he took to his heels with the dig
niiied representative of the judiciary,
nephew Jerry and Sutliff, closely follow
i Ing, yelling "Stop thief." Unmindful of
those behind him, Clark increased his
I pace, and might have escaped had not the
i yelling of outsiders attracted the atten
| tion of Officers J. R. Freel and T. R.
: Plynn, and as Clark turned into Mont
i goinery avenue he ran Into their arms.
When searched at the California -street
station. Clark's overcoat pocket contained
$1Â», the contents of Sutllff'a till, and he
1 was charged with rubbery. During the
excitement the prisoner's accomplices
escaped.

THE WAR AND BUSINESS.
COMMERCIAL conditions all over the country
are now changing to conform to the new state
of affairs occasioned by the war, but it is yet too
early to definitely specify what the individual changes
will be. Wheat has already declared its new status in
a sharp advance, both in Europe and this country, and
coffee, sugar, rice and several other grocery staples
have appreciated, but the great majority of the com
mon commercial commodities have not yet exhibited
the final change from a peace to a war basis. Nor is
it wise to attempt to forecast. 'Generally speaking,
however, those articles which will be needed to supply
the army, and those which will probably be subject to
a war tax, will advance in price, while those which
are commonly exported, and which will therefore be
liable to seizure on the high seas, will decline, or at
least relapse into an unsettled and fluctuating con
dition, dependent from day to day upon the varying
phases of the combat. This is as near to it as human
judgment can come at the moment. As time goes
on, however, things will fall naturally intotheir proper
levels. Thus the New York stock market has already
established its equilibrium, as has been seen, and
wheat is in process of doing the same, as just re
marked. The other lines will follow in due time.
Up to the present there has been no change for the i
worse in general trade. Railroad earnings have been
14.3 per cent larger than last year for the first half of
April and 4.8 per cent larger than iÃoj, with railway '
tonnage eastbound from Chicago about 10 per cent
larger than 1802. Neither are clearing-house trans
actions gloomy, the week's payments being 33.6 per
cent larger than last year. The failures last week were !
only 204, against 218 for the same week last year.
These exhibits indicate an increase, rather than a de
crease, in business, hence the war has thus far done i
no harm to trade, so far as can be seen. A further
slight decrease in the distributive trade of the East
and South is reported, but this is offset by increased â 
activity in certain lines, accompanied by sharp ad- [
vance. It is these contrary conditions which render
the commercial situation vague and complex at the
moment and make a definite exhibit of the state of
trade almost impossible. But it is worthy of remark
in this connection that the money market, that most
sensitive of all trade barometers, has thus far exhibit
ed no stringency, and that the supply of funds for all
ordinary mercantile and financial uses is abundant.
In this respect the country was never on a sounder
basis nor so well prepared for war. Spain presents
a pitiable contrast, being agitated by a financial panic
and runs upon almost every bank in the kingdom.
The local situation partakes of the general uncer
tainty, .and values for many articles are unsettled.
During the past week wheat has made a sensational
advance, and is stiff at the rise, with an active demand
for both export and local milling account. Barley has
also started up again, and flour has gone up 50 cents
per barrel. Truthfulness compels the admission that
we will have very little wheat for export this year,
something that has not happened before since Cali
fornia began to export this cereal in any quantity. Of
course the other grains arc in a similar plight, and the
year 1808 will go on record as the great dry year.
There will be enough of everything for our own use,
however. The upward tendency in hay is less pro
nounced, but there is little prospect of any decline.
The canned and dried fruit markets are firm, and while
not especially active, business is sufficiently brisk to
warrant the belief that stocks of both will be reduced
to a minimum by the time the new crop comes for
ward. The fruit-growers will probably do well this
year. The merchandise markets are in good shape
as a rule, and fluctuations are neither numerous nor
sharp. Everything seems to be on a normal basis,
without excitement, the merchants are not complain
ing, and times may safely be called good, the dry year
to the contrary notwithstanding.
Eastern correspondents who are so certain of the
plans of the naval department seemed to have
dreamed the information they are loading on the
wire. Appirently they think the world will believe
the Navy Department to be as gossipy as a sewing
circle.
It would be interesting to know if the whacking of
a doctor over the pate by another of the craft is any
violation of the justly celebrated code of ethics of
which so much is heard and so little known.
The Topeka seems to have had a narrow escape.
It appears that some ship came into collision with
some other, and had the Topeka been one of them
it might have been damaged.
As to naval engagements, the word of Florida
fishermen will not be accepted. They nay know all
about clams, but war is out of their line.
OUR WAR NEWS SERVICE.
r\ MPLE arrangements have been made by The
/ \ Call in alliance with the New York Herald to
furnish the public with prompt and accurate
reports of all events growing out of the war with
Spain, no matter in what part of the globe they may
occur. These arrangements are the result of prepara
tions made long before actual hostilities broke out,
and as a consequence are superior to any that may
row be made hurriedly to meet the emergency.
As the course of the struggle, for the present at
any rate, will center mainly around Cuba, special care
has been taken to provide good correspondents
throughout that island and the West Indies generally.
In addition to reporters located at important points
and thoroughly familiar with the situation, a corps
of accomplished writers and experienced news
gatherers has been dispatched to follow the army and
the navy so as to be present whenever and wherever
anything of note takes place.
Amoni the representatives of The Call
and the Herald at the seat of war are Rich
ard Harding Davis, who is now with the
fleet, ani Charles Akers, the well-known
military expert, who is with the army. To
assist in gathering the army news five spe
cial correspondents who speak Spanish have
been sent ?outh to be ready to follow the
first corpa that makes the descent upon
Cuba. Two powerful steel tugs, the Som
mer.s N. Smith and the Albert F. Dewey,
each carrying a staff of writers, artists and
photographers, arc already with the 'fleet
and in addition thereto The Call and the
Herald service will be increased by the fleet
ocean steamer Tyr, flying the Danish flag.
This steamer, with a competent corps of
correspondents and artists, is now on her
way to Porto Klco, and will cover the detail
of the blockade.
Arrangements for the prompt transmission of news
have been as carefully prepared and as effectively
made as those for gathering it. Dispatches will be
sent from St. Thomas or Kingston as circumstances
dictate, and special reporter- are stationed at all the
West Indies, and will send dispatches as long as the
cables remain uncut. If the cables are dctroyed or
communication by them is in any way interrupted the
swift tugs of The Call and Herald will be ready to
firing the news to the American coast wft'aou* delay.
It is to Le further noted that correspondents of The
Call and Herald will remain at Madrid. Cadiz, Barce
lona and St. Vincent, and arrangements have been
made for a comprehensive cable service from Europe
in order to bring these correspondents into close
touch with this country. Finally :herc are with each
squadron half a dozen or more naval officers, who
will act as correspondents of The Call and Herald,
and, as these have special facilities for acquiring in
formation and special aptitude for describing naval
affairs, their reports will be of great value to the
public.
It should be borne in mind that these arrangements
made by The Call and Herald are not the result of
hasty action. They were planned long ago. A host
of correspondents are already on the field. They in
clude men who have lived in the We>t Indies for
years. While the hastily organized staffs of other
papers will be involved in the confusion of affairs
they do not understand and will be forced to rend" out
as news a multitude of rumors and reports cf m more
value than as many fakes, the reports of The Call and
Herald will be accurate and relinM.-.
THE PRIVATEERING QUESTION.
DEBATES in the United States Senate and the
British Commons have disclosed the fact
that there was a misconception in the re
ports given out a few days ago to the effect that our
Government had given assurances to Europe that it
would not issue letters of marque to privateers in
case of a war with Spain. The declarations made by
the Government referred to clauses of the treaty of
Paris of 1856 other than those which relate to the
question of privateers.
The subject was brought up in the Senate by
Money of Mississippi, who, after saying he had no
ticed in the pre^s a report that the State Depart
ment had announced that during the approaching
war there would be no privateering on the part of the
United States, and that this Government would abide
by the treaty of Paris, asked if any member of the
Committee on Foreign Relations could inform the
Senate if the report was correct. To this the chair
man of the committee, Senator Davis, replied: "I
have heard nothing about the matter except what I
have seen in the newspapers."
The discussion in the Commons explains the con
flict of statement. Balfour, in reply to a question on
the subject, said the British Government had re
ceived from the United States a notification that it
would adhere to the treaty of Paris so far as regards
neutral vessels. A declaration of respect for neutrals
is quite a different thing from a declaration that we
would not sanction privateers, and leaves that im
portant question open for decision as the needs of
the emergency may require.
Senator Money directed attention to the fact that
the power to issue letters of marque and reprisal is
under our Government confined exclusively to Con
gress. This fact in itself shows that the report so
extensively circulated was in error. Whether or no
we shall send forth privateers to prey upon the com
merce of Spain is for Congress to decide, and there
is no reason to believe that it will be in any hurry
to reach an absolute conclusion on the matter.
The whole policy of our Government has been to
respect private property in war as much as possible.
The history of American privateers has been one of
courage and daring, but in our admiration for the
brave men who carried it on we have never inclined
to make that form of warfare perpetual among na
tions. It is well known that the only reason we did
not agree to the treaty of Paris was not because it
went too far in suppressing privateering, but that it
did not go far enough in guaranteeing the rights of
neutrals. In the same spirit of honorable war Con
gress will deal with the problem in this emergency.
We may have no desire to enter upon it, but if Spain
tries it she will find that privateering is a game we
hp.ve played before with distinguished success, and if
need be we can play it again with equal vigor.
FACTORY LABOR IN THE SOUTH-
AN impressive illustration of the far-reaching
effect of human actions is afforded by an un
foreseen and unintended outcome of the re
cent strike of the cotton mill operatives in New Eng
land. The strikers aimed to maintain the former
rate of wages in their own localities, but completely
failed. The local effect of the strike was merely a
few weeks of idleness on the part of some of the
operatives and the closing down of a few of the mills.
It is in the far South that the greater effects are felt,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 25, 1898.
and' the results there may prove in the end to be
among the most important ever brought about by a
labor strike in the history of the United States.
This unexpected development was brought about by
the fact that among the causes which enable South
ern cotton mills to undersell the Northern mills is
the long hours of labor required of the Southern
operatives. The Northern mill-owners pointed out
to their employes that they had to compete with
workers in the Southern States who toiled twelve
hours a day, and for lower wages at that, and conse
quently that the Northern operative would be at a
disadvantage so long as the Southern mills are run
under the present grinding system.
Out of this there came at once a demand and an
agitation for better labor laws in the South. The
strike in New En.' land is over, but the agitation for
Southern reform continues. This, it is already seen,
is the most important thing accomplished by the
strikers. They have not achieved anything of impor
tance for themselves, but they have rendered a valu
able service to the fellow-workers in the Southern
States. They have directed the attention of the na
tion to the evil conditions of factory operatives in
those States, and by doing so have started a move
ment which in the end can hardly fail to result in a
far-reaching benefit to an overworked and ill-paid
class.
The agitation has of course aroused a great deal
of opposition in the South, but this was to have been
expected. The movement for labor laws has been
bitterly fought in every portion of the world where
it has been started. The South is industrially to-day
where the Northern States were twenty years ago,
when in 1874 Massachusetts adopted a ten-hour fac
tory law, and the fight for labor there will be as hard
as was the long fight for it in the North. In the
end, however, it will be successful, and the Southern
operative will have occasion to give thanks to the
New England strikers who precipitated the battle for
their relief.
A PARCELS POST SYSTEM.
/â ""Â» ONSIDERABLE interest has been expressed
I in the East over a recent statement in the House
of Commons that the failure thus far to arrange
a parcels post system between the United States and
Great Britain is due mainly to the reluctance of the
Postoffice Department of the United States to enter
into such an arrangement. The subject has given rise
to no little discussion, and as a result there has de
\ eloped so strong a sentiment in favor of such a pos
tal system that it is probable earnest efforts will be
made to induce our Government to arrange for one
as speedily as possible.
The proposed scheme is not of so much interest to
the Pacific Coast as it is to the Atlantic seaboard,
where the interchange of parcels with Great Britain
amounts to an enormous traffic, and yet we can read
ily perceive the advantage it would be to the peop.le
of both countries. The parcels delivery is one of the
successes of the British postoflice. It provides the
people with a means of sending small parcels with a
security equal to that of the best express companies
and at a comparatively small cost. If extended to the
United States it would largely increase the trade in
sr -all articles between the two nations and thus lead
to a better trade in all classes of goods.
The chief benefit of a parcels post to the people of
California would be the facilities it would afford our
manufacturers and fruit preserving men to send small
samples of their wares to Great Britain for inspection
and trial. In that way we could make known to the
dealers of London many articles of California pro
duction for which there would grow up a large de
mand in the course of a few years. In addition to
this there would be other advantages of considerable
importance. It is therefore likely that the Eastern
agitation for the establishment of the international
parcels post will find almost as much favor here as
there, and that the country will be virtually a unit in
urging it upon the Government.
It is not clear why our Postoffice Department has
been opposed to the project, although it is likely the
fear of increasing expenditures at a time when we
have a yearly deficit in the department has been the
chief reason. If this be so, we have another cause to
complain of those members of Congress who defeated
the Loud bill for reducing expenditures and have
failed to advance some other means for effecting that
object. The deficit in itself is bad enough, but it be
comes worse when it stands in the way of postal ex
pansion in a direction that would be of great advan
tage to all.
OWIXG to the imposition in the way oi fake ex
tras which has of late been practiced upon the
public, and for the purpose of guarding the
people against such deceptions and frauds, The Call
will at once make a notable extension of-.its news
bulletins and publish dispatches of every notable
event of the war in such a way as to make the news
accessible at once to readers in every part of the
city without cost.
To accomplish this The Call will print every dis
patch of importance as soon as it arrives, and post it
not only on the bulletin boards of The Call office, but
on the boards of every Call agency in the city, and
also at other places where the people congregate. No
time will be wasted in getting out .extras to be hawked
about the streets. The moment a dispatch is received
at any hour of the day or fore part of the night it
will be at once printed on a special press, and the
copies, as soon as struck off, will be sent by mes
senger boys on bicycles to The Call agencies and to
such other notable places as may be selected, and
there posted for all to read.
These dispatches thus publicly posted will furnish
the people with the news as fast as it comes to San
Francisco, and will save them from the fake-extra
fiends who issue sheets proclaiming battles when no
battles have occurred. The public will have a reliable
record of events as fast as they occur, and will have
no occasion to pay out a nickel in order to .read a
rumor or fake.
In addition to extending its bulletins in the city
The Call will give a larger service than ever in its
bulletins throughout California, Nevada and Arizona.
At the present time The Call is sending such bulletins
to upward of ioo points, and will soon add new ones
to the list as well as increasing the service to those
already reached. In this way the people of all im
portant places in this State and in Arizona and Ne
vada will be kept posted on the progress of events as
rapidly as they occur.
The reports obtained by The Call are tl.e most ac
curate received in this city. The public has doubtless
already noted that The Call has published no fakes.
The superiority of our service is due to the fact that
it was arranged for long beforehand, as it is not made
up on the spur of the moment out of rumors and fan
tastic fancies like those of journals that waited for the
war to break out before they arranged for getting the
news. The Call bulletins will be accurate as well as
prompt. Look out for them.

NAVAL GUNS!
And What It Costs \
to Fire Them.
fl TTENTION was recently directed
A by a naval official to the fact that
our naval ordnance was defective
as compared with foreign ships in
the lack of quick-firing Runs. It Is four
years since the first 6-inch gun was con
verted at the Washington yard into a
quick-firer, and since then only about a
dozen more have been thus converted. It
costs about $1000 for ep.ch gun and the
present capacity is five months to each
lot of twelve guns, working eight hours
daily. By putting on three shifts the
time would be reduced correspondingly,
and every forty-five days would add a
dozen quick-firing 6-inch guns to our
ships' batteries. The efficiency of the bat
tery is nearly tripled in the 6 and 5 inch
guns and doubled in an S-inch rifle. Tha
importance of rapid firing cannot be over
estimated.
In the following table the principal data
of United States and Spanish naval ord
nance are given. The guns Indicated by
a star are quick-firers, and the powder
charges of the Spanish guns are smoke
less powder or cordite, while that of our
guns is given for common brown pow

The rapidity with which guns can be
served and discharged is recorded from
actual tests on board ship at target prac
tice:
134-inchâ7 rounds in 12 minutes.
13-Inchâ l round in 2 minutes.
12-Inchâ l round in 1 minute lfl seconds.
10-inchâ l round in 2 minutes.

4.7-inch, quick-lirinKâ s rounds in -2 seconds.
6-pdrs â 10 rounds in 1 minute
The disadvantage of a ship with ordi
nary breech-loading G-inch rifles against
another with quick-firers is quite appar
ent.
. Another clement in naval gunnery Is
that of cost, which is enormous as com
pared with that of thirty years ago. The
cost of Elswick guns ten years ago was
as follows: 13., inch. $51,111; 12 inch.
$33,093; 9.2 inch. $21,615; 8 inch, $10,268; 6
inch. $5127; 5 inch, $1600; 12 pounders. $1000.
Quick-firing guns had not yet come into
general use, and their introduction en
tailed of course additional cost. The cost
of United States guns is not at hand, but
they are not likely to be less costly than
those above enumerated. The ammuni
tion which would be expended in a half
hour's engagement of a battleship of the
Oregon class would be quite a fortune,
and approximately as follows: Four 13
inch guns discharged fifteen times each,
making sixty rounds, the cost of each
discharge would be nearly $600, or a total
of (36,000. The eight t>-\v lines: n:~,t
twenty times each or collectively one
hundred and sixty rounds, would cost
J25.C00. Two hundred and forty rounds
from the four G-lnch jfttps ai >â¢"â -->,;
would foot up $9600: twenty G-no"""i^-Â«
firing 300 rounds each would cost $17,000.
and four 1-pounders peppering away at
the rate of thirteen shots a minute would
expend $174ti. making a total of nearly
$90,000 gone- up in smoke in half an hour,
or $45,000 in one-quarter hour engage
ment. Then there are the torpedoes,
which cost $2500 each of the Whitehead
pattern and $2200 for the Howell. Half a
dozen of these missiles sent off would be
at an expense of over J14.000. and to this
should be further added the fire from the
machine guns when sufficiently close to
make them effective, making not less
than $G4.000 expended during a fifteen
minute engagement. Add to this the cost
of damage done to the ship by the adver
sary, which may be merely nominal or
destructive to the vessel, and it will give
some idea of the cost oÂ£ modern war
fare. __^_______â -
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Russian Navy Department has or
dered twenty Yarrow water lube boilers
from the Baltic Engineering and Ship
building Works at St. Petersburg. The
boilers arc for torpedo-boat destroyers
and torpedo-boats in course of construc
tion.
The latest improvement in the one
pounder Maxim quick-tiring gun is a dis
appearing carriage, making the gun par
ticularly well adapted for smaller vessels.
The entire outfit weighs only 2130 pounds.
The shell complete weighs L4G pounds,
fired with a charge of 1 ounce 110 grains,
which gives a velocity of ISOO feet per
second. Its firing capacity Is 250 rounds
per minute.
The d'Entrecasteaux, armored cruiser,
built in France soon after the United
States cruiser New York of that class had
had her highly successful trial, has re
cently had a preliminary speed trial at
sea. She made nineteen knots with 12.M0
horsepower, and when the engines are
worked up to their maximum power of
14,000 horsepower a speed of twenty knots
is anticipated. The d'Entrecasteaux is
8114 tons, against the New York of 8200
tons, which developed a speed of twenty
one knots on 17,400 horsepower.
The French battleship Formidable, of
12,165 tons, was launched in 1885, but has
been completed now, after undergoing
various changes on the original design.
She has received new boilers, and the bat
tery and gun protection has been entirely
changed. The ship has a steel belt of 21^
Inches in thickness, and her two 14.0-inch
rifles are located in barbettes, or open
turrets. 17% inches thick. Eight C.3-inch
quick-firers are protected by 6-inch case
mates, and her eight oVi-inch quick-firers
have heavy shields. The dimensions of
the Formidable are: 322 feet length, 6!Â»Mi
feet beam and a draught of nearly 30 feet.
The coal-bunker capacity is tons, and
she is expected to steam 1G knots under
forced draught.
An order was recently received at Brest
to mobilize the first division of the French
squadron in the shortest possible time,
as a test of the efficiency of the arsenal.
The division included the Hoche, Jem
mapes and Valmy. battle-ships; Dupuy
de Lome, armored cruiser, and four
smaller vessels. The order came at 8
o'clock in the forenoon, and by 10 o'clock
all the crews were aboard, and by 10
o'clock at night the ships had taken in
coal sufficient to steam twenty-five days
at twelve knots an hour, and all other
war stores, ammunition and provisions
up to full war requirements were on
board. It was demonstrated that Brest
could, in a few hours, fit out a squadron,
but it is alleged that if there had been
any doubt on this point the order would
not have been given. In other words, it
was a prearranged plan got up for some
political effect to secure supporters for
certain naval expenditure appropriations.
An official list of vessels building abroad
for the Japanese navy gives the following
facts: Three battle-ships are building at
the Thames Iron Works; Thompson &
Co., Glasgow, and at Elswick. The first,
named the Shikishima, is 43S feet by 75
feet 6 inches, and has a displacement of
15.088 tons on 27 feet 3 inches draught. The
Asaki, at Thomson's, is 13 feet shorter,
but displaces 15,440 tons, and the third,
not yet named, is 440 feet by 76 feet 6
inches and 15,240 tons on 27 feet draught.
Their speeds ace to be eighteen knots and
their date of completion is set for May 4
and October 5. 1899, and March 24, 1900.
Three armored cruisers, two of them of
9855 tons, and the third of 9906 tons, are
building at Elswick, two to b. completed
this year and the last in the summer of
1899. They will have speeds from 20% to
21V6 knots. One is not yet named; the
others are known as the Asama and Ta
kiwa. A protected cruiser, called Taka
sago, is nearly completed at Elswick. She
is 4227 tons, and is to make 22% knots. An
armored cruiser, Azuma, is being built in
France, to be completed in June, 1900. She
is 9460 tons and of twenty knots speed.
The Vulcan Company in Stettin is build
ing an armored cruiser of 9SOO tons, to be
delivered April, 1900; speed twenty knots.
The protected cruisers Kasagi and Chi
tosi, building at Cramps' and the Union
Iron Works, are to have a speed of 22Â»Â±
knots, and are to be delivered next De
cember. The distribution of this naval
work insures for the Japanese Govern
ment all the advantages arising from
competition, and the natural tendency of
each builder to excel his rival in turning
out ships that will bring more work to
the yard.
IN AKREST.
A private comes after me all the day long.
With a gun In his lmpldent holt.

If I took a notion to bolt;
The others are drillln' an' polishln' arms
An gittln' all ready to go.
While I'm cleanln' ditches an' mendin' the

In front of the officers' row.
The sergeant comes by with his awkwardeat

An' ev'ry thick-headed recruit
Cocks up his off eye an' he wonders about
The man In the Olrty brown suit.
It's 9 and the guard mount's about to begin â

You couldn't expect 'em to know
It's because I licked Peters I'm cleanln' the

That runs along officers' row.
The boys are all readin' the papers; I hear
Them arguin' war as they pass.
Or when I work near to some lazyln' crowd
That's wearln' the green of the grass;
I'd like mighty well to chip into the talk
For just half a minute or so.
But I'm In arrest, an' the guard must be strict

But never you mind. When It's time to play

They'll order me out of arrest:
I'll throw oft the brown an' I'll march out In

The same as the others are dressed:
An harder than when I licked Peters I'll fight.
If nghtin should come, for you know
That one kind of scrappin' ain't paid for

THE COMMERCE OF SPAIN.
Secretary Wilson of the Agricultural
Department lias authorized the publica
tion of a bulletin on the subject of Spain's
foreign trade from IS9I to 1895, inclusive,
prepared by Frank H. Hitchcock, the
chief of the section of foreign markets.
It shows that Spain's commercial trans
actions with the rest of the world amount
annually to more than $300,000,000. In 1895
the merchandise imports amounted to
Â£61,829,516 and the exports $155,355,759.
Spain's foreign trade is largely mari
time. Of the merchandise imported and
exported during 1891-95 only 15.9 per cent
was transported by land, while 84.1 per
cent was carried in sea-going vessels.
In the earlier years of the decade 1888
1895, says the New York Press, more thnn
one-half of Spain's maritime commerce
was carried by foreign vessels: but since
1891 there has been a change, and the na
tional shipping is now in the ascendency.
The imports and exports made under the
Spanish flag during 1896 amounted to
$146,969,806, and thus.- under flags of other
nations to only $115445,676.
The total value of the merchandise
annually exchanged between Spain and
Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, the
Canaries and her various minor posses
sions exceeded $50,000,000. The United
States ranks third among the sources of
Spain's import trade.
Coal, which constitutes the most im
portant item among Spain's nnn-agricul
turaJ imports, is procured chiefly from the
United Kingdom, the receipts from the
United States amounting to less than 1
per cent of the total.
In 1896 there were entered and cleared
at Spanish ports 36.856 merchant vessels.
Of these vessels 19.169 carried the flag of
Spain and 17/>S7 vessels the flags of other
nations. The average yearly tonnage for
the five years. 1891-1895, was 24,374,939,
while that for the preceding five years
was only 22.4f9.590. This increase, was duo
to the growth in the tonnage of the
Spanish merchantmen.
On December 31, 1896, the latest date for
which there are available statistics, the
merchant marine of Spain comprised 1783
vessels, having an aggregate tonnage of
719.572. Compared with the statistics for
1895. this is a slight increase in the size of
the fleet and a marked one in its tonnage.
The steam vessels increased from 431 In
l.w, to 523 in 1896. The ships entered and
cleared on the Atlantic amounted an
nually to 19.704. as against 15,738 along
the Mediterranean.

met and never misses an opportunity to
try a new dish. The other night he, to
gether with his star, Ferris Hartman,
and his star's friend, one Tomaso Leary,
who was discovered some years ago by
Hartman when that gentleman was en
gaged In exploring the scenic forests of
ihe Tivoli, went into a cafe adjacent to
the BaMwin Hotel for a light supper.
The three of them sat down to a table,
and when the attendant appeared to take
the order Leary said he was not feeling
vjry well, so he would only take a small
dish of boiled beef and greens, with a
half-gallon of beer to wash it down.
Hartman had been to the races playing
Joe Eppinger's tips, so he thought that
a thin cracker and a glass of water would
be about his limit. But Bowles, the re
splendant Bowles, had been in the box
office all the afternoon attending to the
advance sale of tickets for his show, and
consequently nothing on the entire menu
was too good or too expensive for his
hypercritical taste. He took the bill of
fare, and, carefully scanning it. he saw a
dish called 'â¢mousannilni aux frambosil,"
which was a new one on him, and conse
quently he decided to have some.
When the dish appeared it proved to be
a veritable triumph of the culinary au,
and thj enchanted Bowles insisted on h's
frlenc's Uying each a mouthful, so they
could ,ice how good it was and know
what U call for, if they ever happens
to come into the place with money In
their pockets. Leary and Hartman both
tasted and were delighted with the dish
and 'nsisted on knowing what it w.'.s.
"There is the name," said Bowles, point
ing to the menu, "but what it is 1 have
not the slightest idea. However, we'll
call the waiter and find out." He beck
oned the menial and, turning to that in
dividual said: "Young man, this dish
with whi-n you have provided us is deil
cate in the extreme. Can you tell ma
what it is?" "Yes," answered the waiter,
"it's $2 40." .

KESENTED THE INSULT.
A Spanish Sympathizer Put to Flight
by a Soldier.
John Murray, a soldier stationed at the
Presidio, engaged in a wordy dispute
â¢with a man on Powell street lasi even
ing as to the outcome of the war with
Spain. The stranger espoused the cause
of Spain and referred to the soldiers of
UnclÂ© Sam as a "lot of stiffs." Murray
became incensed at the remark and
Btarted to annihilate bis opponent. The
latter took to his heels and darted int >
a Baloon close by. Murray followed him
but before he had a chance to chastise
him for the insulting remark a police
officer appeared on the Bcene and ar
rested the soldier. As he was under the
Influence of liauor a charge of drunk
enness wa-s re<-.Jided against him.

THE INTEREST
WAS DIVIDED
Cuba and Kotzebue Held
Equal Sway on the
Water Front.
The Pumping Barge Char
tered by the Farmers Now
on the Sacramento.
Smart Work Done by the Steamer
Humbo dt Between Dyea, Skaguay
and This ForL
Cuba and Kotzebue Sound divided the
attention of the public on the water :runt
yesterday. Cuba was represented by the
coast defense steamer Monterey, the
naval battalion sloop-of-war Marion and
the cutters Grant and Corwln. while the
barks Kufus E. Wood. Alaska and Mer
maid and barkentir.es Catherine Sudden
and Jane A. Falkenburg attracted the at-
I tentlon of the gold hunters and their
friends.
On the Monterey everybody was on the
gui vlve, and orders are expected hourly
for the coast defense vessel to co out on
a cruise. The boats, save two, have been
taken off the davits and either to-day or
10-morrow the warship's steam launch
will tow them to Mure Island. A few
visitors were allowed aboard durinc the
day, but a.s a general rule both officers
and men were too busy 10 make their
frit-ads heartily welcome.
Very few people were allowed on board
the Marion, and those that did manage
' to reach her deck had to pass a double
: line of sentries. Half way ap Howard
1 street wharf the first guard was sta
tioned, while the second was at the gang
plank. Nearly the entire strength of the
battalion was on board during the after
noon, and one. crew went out in the whale
boat for a practice row. Captain Louis
Turm r Is hurrying back from the north
to resume his command, and on his ar
rival it is expected that the Marion will
be hauled out into the stream and put
in commission. It is not so very long
;i; it j" since the sloop-of-war was doing duty
on the Asiatic station, and she Is still
(or many years of sea service.
U lien the Yukon Kiver opens the Marion
may be put into service to convoy the
steamers that will bring the gold down
from St. Micnaei.
On the revenue cutters very little was
beir.g done, as the captains and otfkers
are mply awaiting orders.
There was a steady stream of visitors
to the Koizebue Sound boats during the
day. The bark Alaska is to sail next
Thursday, and nearly all of her 110 pas
sengers were down during the day. Berths
were being selected, baggage stored away
a:.Â«l things generally got in readiness for
tht; start.
The Jane. A. Falkenburg has been thor- ;
oughly overhauled and is now ready tor
her passengers. It will be v. couple of !
w< eks before she gets away, but her
owners expect to not only heat the Alas
ka, but have their men on the gold licids
,i week ahead or her.
The alterations to the Catherine Sudden
are not yet completed, but judging from
the present outlook they will be equal
if not superior to anything that will so
north. Tlie Sudden ujiJ i?"alkenburg will
both take their steam launches on deck,
so that when Kotzebue Sound is reached
all that will be necessary will be to put
the boats over the side, man and pro
vision them and start up the Kuouck
River. In the case of the Alaska the
river boat has been built hi sections and
will have to .be put together at St. Law
rence island before the trip up the river
can begin.
The -Mermaid was also well patronized
bj- visitors yesterday, and she and the
Budden and Falkenburg will all get away
about' the same time. Sho also is carry
ing her launches on deck, so it will be
a=pretty race Uetwetsn the three boats to
see hlch will get her passengers iirst
into the river. Although going: into a
practically .unknown country, still every
one of the gold hunters expects to come
back a millionaire in a year or so.
The Rufus E. Wood is not going to
Kotzebue, but will carry passengers and
freight to .St. Michael. She is one of
. the Alaska-Yukon Company's boats and
should make a quick trip to the Yukon.
. The brig Harriet G, another of the
Klondike fleet coming- here from the
East, arrived from New York yesterday.
The gold hunters on board of her call
themselves the Manhattan-Alaskan Trad
; Ing and Mining Company, and after fit
ting out .here they are going o.i to St.
Michael. The Harriet G took lit days
to come here. On January 1G she was "at
Montevid-eo. and on March 5 she anchored
oft Juan Fernandez (Robinson Crusoe's)
: Island instead of putting into Valpa
raiso. They replenished their water
: tanks and secured a supply of goat meat
and vegetables from the natives and
sailed again the same day. The trip up
the coa^-t was an uneventful one.
The Spreckels tug Fearless, which ar
i rived from Dutch Harbor Saturday night,
] will be turned over to the United States
authorities to-day. Yesterday the crew
was engaged in putting the hawsers
ashore and getting their belongings to
gether. Captain Clem Randall's friends
; were all down to see him during the day,
and they gave the clever master of the
Fearless a hearty welcome home.
The barge Merritt, from which so much
is expected by the farmers on the Sacra
mento River, started for her destination
yesterday In tow of the tug Elizabeth.
She was tried prior to the start and the
compound engine on board easily pumped
20.000 gallons an hour. The Elizabeth will
take the barge halfway up the Sacra
mento, where she will be taken In tow
by one of the river steamers and towed
to J. YV. Browning's ranch. As told in
Last Monday's Call exclusively the barge
la to be towed from ranch to ranch and
pump water from the river over the
levees Into the irrigating dltcheÃ dug by
the farmers. In this way it is hoped to
save the crops and perhaps grow a sec
ond one.
The Humboldt Steamship Company's
fine new steamer Humboldt, which ar
rived from Seattle yesterday; did remark
ably well on her last round trip to Dyea
and Skaguay. Her run from Skaguay to
Seattle in three days and twenty ho"urs.
including the necessary anchorages la
the fastest run on record, while the" round
trip In sixteen days and twenty hours, In
cluding: two days spent at Seattle, speaks
for Itself. Of all the vessels that are and
have heen en*ajÂ»ed in the Hyea-Skaguay
trade the ITumhnldt is probably the one
that has *iven the most satisfaction. She
will probably make two ,nore trips to
Ska*uay and will then be put on the St
Michael run.
Among the pnssenjrers who came down
on the Humboldt was Captain E. Clem
ent, the well-known Alaskan pilot. Tie
was formerly master of the steamer City
of Kingston, but pave up his vessel ns
soon as the rush to Klondike bejran. He
will probably go back north on the Hum
boldt.
Thrashed His Wife.
William F. Murray, a big. husky labor
er, living at 727 Minno ntreet. went home
drunk yesterday morning and brutally
beat his wife. Their three children began
to cry and he beat them also
H<Â» was arrested by Policemen
Owens and Coleman and taken
to the City Prison, where a charge of bat
tery was booked against him. Mrs. Mur
ray and the children were taken along in
the patrol wagon, and after the husband
had been locked up she was sent to tha
Receiving Hospital, where her wounds
and bruises were attended to. Murray
claimed that his wife had been drinking.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
i<' children will be asked to look into the
case:

HAD A BUGGY OUTSIDE.
The Police Have an Accurate De
scription of the Two Robbers
and Are Searching for Them.
T>v) men, under the Riiise <f deputy
sheriffs, committed a daring robbery Ba*.
urday aiternoon, nearly frightening a
woman to death at the .same thn?.
About 3 o'clock two men drove up in
a buggy to the Swedish and American
Bakery, 988 Folsom street, owned by J.
Lander. Lander, unfortunately, happened
to be away at the time, but his wife
was In the store. They told her that
they were deputy sheriffs and had called
to collect a bill of $65 for flour. One of
them threw back the lapel of his coat
and showed a badge, but Mrs. Lander
did not notice whether anything was en
graved on it.
She told them that she did not know
of any bill being due for $65, as her hus
band, who was not in, looked after these
things. She asked them to call again
when he would be in.
"We can't wait, said one of the men,
"and we must collect the money at once.
c will go downstairs and see what
Hour you have got in the cellar."
They went downstairs and returned in
a few minutes. They said there was not
enough flour to cover the bill, and sug
gested that they should go upstairs to
the living rooms to see what they could
levy on there.
Mrs. Lander begged them not to go up
stairs, and one of them said: "Well
let s see what you have got in the till. 1 '
Mrs. L-amlei planted herself in front of
the till and again begged them to wait
until her busband returned, but she was
rudely Belied by the arm and thrown
aside. One robber made two unsuccess
ful attempts to force open the drawer
but the third was successful. He
grabbeti the money in the till, between
X and $4, and demanded to know if that
was aU the money she had. The poor
m man was by this time almost in a
hysterical condition, and with tears in
her < â¢>> s told them it was all the money
she had, and implored them to go away.
Finally they took their departure, after
telling her that they would return about
i> o clock. She saw them jump into the
buggy and drive off along Folsom street
in the direction of the ferry.
As soon as her husband returned Mrs
Lander informed him of what the two
mr-n had done. He did not wait tc see
ii they would return at 5 o'clock, but at
r nee notified police headquarters, and
Detectives Ryan and ODea were detailed
on the ease.
Mis. Lander was seen yesterday. She
is still suffering from her nervous fright,
and it will be some time before she will
pluck up sufficient courage to remain in
t!:-- store alone again.
'â¢One of the men," she said, "was very
rough and violent. He was a short thin
man with a reddish mustache, and it was
he that robbed the till and threw me
aside. He had such a fierce look that
I was afraid of my life. The other man
was taller and stouter. He had a full
round face and dark mustache. I would
know them both again. They were both
fairly well dressed. The baiige that the
smaller man showed was not bright 'is
the stars of the policemen. I was too
excited to take notice whether anything
was on it.
"After taking: the money out of the
till the robber tore a piece of paper from
a bau on the counter and wrote some
thing on it and pitched it at me. i don't
know what was on the paper my hus
band has given it to the police. The men
die not return."
The detectives last nieht arrested a
young man named William Rilev on sus
picion of being one of the robbers lie
was take, to police headquarters and
Mrs. Lander was sent for. After care
fully looking at him the woman declared
that he was not the right man, although
he resembled the smaller of the two rob
bers.
Riley was then released from custody.

The race for half-raters did not come
off, there being only one entry. Very few
of the small sailing craft are in commis
sion yet.
The clubhouse stood open most of yes
terday and was visited by many friends
of the members. Ladies in summer
dresses chatted on the piazza or were
taken out upon the bay in launches or
yachts.
At about noon Commodore Dr. T. L.
Hill's flagship Cygnos got under way
and the rest of the San Francisco Club
and visiting yachts followed upon signal
from the commodore. There was a pip
ing breeze, which carried the cruisln*
yachts quickly over to the San Francisco
water front. Thence the California
Yacht Club contingent shaped its course
for Oakland Creek, while the San Fran
cisco and "Corinthian boats sailed back
round Angel Island. The Corinthian boats
went to their moorings at Tiburon and
the San Francisco yachts reached Sau
pu.ll to soon after 4 o'clock.

LEAGUE OF THE CROSS RALLY.
James O'Brien of Company E Wins
the Silver Medal for Elo
quence in Debate.
The regular Quarterly rally of the
League of the Cross Cadets took place in
Native Sons' Hall on Mason street yes
terday afternoon. The hall was crowded
to its utmost capacity by the friends and
relatives of the cadets, who had come to
witness the debate between the cham
pions of four parishes, the winner of
which was' to receive the silver medal
whtah would entitle him to enter the
grand debate for the Riordan gold medal,
which debate will be held in August next.
The four contestants were- Private
James O'Brien of Company E, St. Marys
parish; Color Sergeant George Shaw of
Sacred Heart parish; Private Hunt of
Company M, St. Francis' parish; Sergeant
Frank J. Callighan of Company G, St.
Bridget's parish.
Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas F. Ryan
presided and the judgea were Julius
Kahn, Silas White and Dr. Mahoney.
The subject of the debate was 'â¢Tem
perance the Foundation of True Man
hood," and each of the speakers did so
well that when the judges finally retired
to decide who should receive the coveted
medal they had some difficulty In coming
to a decision, but llnally decided that
the honor belonged to James Ryan, and
accordingly he was presented with the
trophy by Rev. Father Ryan, the spirit
ual director of the cadets.
During the intermissions In the debate
i patriotic selections were rendered ou the
piano and addresses were listened to from
I Rev. Father Makeham of San Mateo
: Seminary, Julius Kahn and others.
At the conclusion of the debate it was
1 announced that a grand competitive drill
i for the Montgomery medal will take place
ion May 24 in the Mechanics' Pavilion,
i and that an admission of 50 cents would
be charged for the same.
The patriotism of the cadets is at the
fever heat, as could be seen by the en
i thusiasm with which every little allusion
! to a probable call for active service was
j received, and if the 700 who volunteered
| are allowed t<> go to me front they can
be trusted to uphold the honor of the
i names many of them bear, which have
heretofore appeared on the death roll of
every hotly contested battle in the mod
ern history of the world.

SAD FATE OF
A COLORED
PLUNGER
William Gibson Is
Locked Up in a
Padded Cell.
His Friends Fear That
He Is Hopelessly
Insane.
Pours Carbolic Acid Over His
Back to Cure an Im
aginary Pain.
KNOWN TO RACE-GOERS.
An Effort to BÂ« Made to Have
Him Sent to a Private
Asylum.
William Gibson, one of the best known
colored sports in the city, is locked up
in a padded cell in the Receiving Hospital
pending an examination as to his sani'i.
His friends fear he is hopelessly insane"
For a number of years Gibson was a
familiar figure at the race track. He
operated a roulette game in the interest
of Joe Harvey, and was known to ever>
race track goer. Some time ago he begai
to act strangely, and Harvey was forced
to dispense with his services. Last Sat
urday he created a scene on Kearny
street, and a deputy sheriff, who wit
nessed it, concluding he was insane, took
him to the Receiving Hospital. Superin
tendent Feishthaller refused to receive
him. as the deputy sheriff did not have
the necessary warrant.
Last tfVening Gibson went to police
headquarters, and after announcing thai
he was organizing a company to assist
the United States in whipping Spain
started to enlist several policemen.
One of them, realizing he was mentall.%
deranged, took him to the hospital, where
a charge of insanity was recorded ogams 1
him. After being placed in a padded eel
Gibson complained of severe pains in his.
back. He -was taken into the operating
room, and when stripped his back pre
sented a sickening appearance. From the
neck to his waist the flesh was burned, j
presumably by some powerful acid.
When asked how he had received the j
Injury, Gibson remarked that he was not
telling his professional secrets to any
body.
To a friend who afterward visited him
the unfortunate man, in explanation of
how he had received the burns, said he
was troubled with pain in his back, and
to eradicate It he applied pure carbolic
acid.
"It jest gone an' kill de pain," he re
marked, "but yer kin bank yer last cent
that made me jump when I poured it
over my back."
A number of Gibson's friends visited the
hospital last night and announced theli
intention of having him sent to some
private institution in the hope that he will
regain his mental equilibrium.
WRECKED THE HEARSE.
Serious Runaway Accident on Golden
Gate Avenue.
Two horses attached to a hearse, which
was being driven by James Portley, ran
away on Golden Gate avenue yesterday
afternoon. At Gough street the hearse
was overturned and Portley was thrown
from his seat, but fortunately escaped with
a sprained ankle. The glass of the
hearse was broken, but no other dam
age was done.
Portley was . returning from a trip to
the cemetery when the runaway occurred.
Routed His Assailants.
Dr. Frank Fitzglbbon of the Receiving
Hospital staff had an exciting encounter
with three men on Fourth street last
night. The doctor was returning from a
visit to a patient, and When near Folsom
street he was accosted by an evil-looking
stranger, who demanded money. He em
phasized his demand - seizing the man
of medicine by the arm. Just then his
two companions, who were concealed in
a doorway, sprung out on the doctor and
vainly endeavored to force him to give
up his purse.
Realizing he was In the hands of des
perate men the doctor determined to give
them battle. Raising his cane he brought
it down on the head of one of his assail
ants, while with his disengaged hand he
struck another in the jugular. As he fell
the doctor struck him with his cane,
breaking it in several pieces. As the
third man rushed at him the doctor, with
the piece of broken cane, jabbed him in
the neck, cutting a deep gash. At this
Juncture two policemen appeared on the
scene and arrested the wounded man and
one of his companions. The other man
aged to get away. At the City Prison
they gave their names as Robert Brad
shaw and William Johnson, and they
were each booked on two charges of bat
tery and disturbing the peace. The
wounded man was subsequently taken to
the Receiving Hospital where the cut in
his neck was stitched.

of his brother soldiers, on hearing- of his
valiant deed, warmly congratulated him.

UP WITH THE STANDARD
OF THE RED CROSS!
WA.R, once the pastime of kings, is
io\v civilization's surgical opera
tion. As the keen cut of
the scientist's knife is supplement
ed by the deft care of the trained
nurse so is the sanguinary ex
cision of the festering ulcer from the
body politic of the world tempered by
the gentle ministrations of the Angels
of Mercy wearing the red badge of
peace.
That which once spread devastation
for the personal aggrandizement of the
rulers of men has become the weapon
turned against tyranny and oppression
in behalf of humanity, and, as the hosts
of a conquering despot were followed
by hordes of human vultures intent
upon spoliation of dead and dying on
the bloody field, it is a fit antithesis that
the dove of peace, bearing aid to the
unfortunates who fall, should tread
close on the heels of the army battling
for the uplifting of man.
This is the sentiment which civiliza
tion imbues in the breasts of those who
go forth to fight the cause of, the weak,
and this is the sentiment that brought
forth the Red Cross Society and makes
its modest flag the glad harbinger of
peace and surcease from pain after the
uproar and turmoil of the crimson
field.
There are other duties than that of
bearing arms in response to a call to
defend the nation from invading foes.
Even as Joshua's hands were upheld
in times of old so must our country's
defenders have'thcir arms sustained by
those whose place is not at the front.
It is the duty of every non-combatant
to do that which lies in his or her pow
er to ameliorate the condition of those
who face not only the bullets of the
enemy but also those insidious allies of
the foe â disease and neglect.
Of the tens of thousands of broken
down men whose emaciated and crip
pled forms bear silent but eloquent tes
timony to their braver)' wherever vete
rans of the late war axe seen, not one
tenth of the number oxe their afflic
tions to the saber or bullet so much as
to the lack of care subsequent to the
battle, and thousands fill graves in the
swamps and uplands of the South who,
to-day, might be with their friends on
earth had they received proper nursing
during the days of burning fever and
wasting disease brought on by privation
and exposure.
To California belongs the honor of
organizing the Sanitary Commission,
which was such a potential agent in les- |
sening the horrors of the war of the
rebellion, and California will again
lead the nation with .her angels of
mercy even as she stands ready to lead
the hosts of war. To-day active work
will begin with this end in view, and
the ready response of the State to the j
suggestion of The Call shows that the I
Golden West is not only open-handed
in her lavish hospitality to those who
follow the sun across the snowy ranges :
to the genial shores of the Pacific, but I
when times of trial beset the nation she
is as ready to shed her last drop of
blood in its defense and spend her last
dollar toward minimizing the dangers
which surround those who give their
bodies as living shields to their coun- I
try.
All cannot lead, nor is it possible that
all can even take active interest in the
front, but all â every man, woman and
child in the State â can do something to
further the cause which has for its ulti
mate object the welfare of the country.
War is a costly operation, and all the
adjuncts pertaining to war require
money. The work of the Sanitary
Commission calls for millions of dol
lars if it is to be properly carried on,
and it is these millions that the great
mass of the people who remain behind
can furnish to those whose duty calls
them to the tented field.
MANY NATIVE SONS DEPART FOR NEVADA CITY
IF the promises made by the jolly
crowd of Native Sons who left
this city yesterday morning are to
be believed, there was a hot time
in Nevada City last night.
To-day is the date fixed for the an
nual meeting of the Grand Parlor, the
supreme legislative body of the order
of Native Sons. Delegates from local
parlors and their friends to the number
of 150 left this city by special train at
8 o'clock yesterday morning and ar
rived in Nevada City, the place of
meeting, late in the afternoon. The
party included a score or more of la
dies, the wives of delegates, who will
partake of the gayeties of the coming
week.
The obligation to combine pleasure j
with business is always religiously ob- j
served by the Native Sons. The ne
cesslty for the liberal mixing of whole- j
some enjoyment with the duty of fram- :
ing the laws for the order is, if not
a part of the ritual, at least a part of
the unwritten code of ethics that is
never violated. It is becoming that a
eon of the Golden State should have no i
Let every- Californian give from his
store that which can be spared, and
whether it l^the thousands of the mil
lionaire or the mite of the little child
i 1i 1 wii? have equal weight in the grand
total which will furnish those necessities
and nurses which will undo the deadly
work of Spanish bullets and Cuban
fevers.
Hold up the Sanitary Commission
even as the Sanitary Commission backs
up the brave boys in blue, and let the
patriotic tide set forth so strong from
the Golden West that the wave of en
thusiasm will sweep over the country,
washing out every thought except that
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from
Columbia to the Gulf â north, south.
east and west, the whole nation stands
together, shoulder to shoulder, in the
battle for human liberty against op
pression and misrule.

A WIDE FIELD FOR OPERATIONS
CHICAGO, April 24, IS9S.
To The Call, San Francisco: I am In full sympathy with you. I have
every confidence in the patriotism and humanity of the people of Cali
fornia and success is already assured the Red Cross Society which your
citizens will organize to-murrww. At noon on Monday citizens of Penn
sylvania, New Jersey and Illinois will meet to organize a national relief
society in the spirit of the Christian Commission of '61. There will be
a wide field for your operations and there wiil be much for you to do.
You cannot organize too early, and you must be prepared for many
emergencies. We must and shall save our soldiers from the awful suffer
ings that made the late civil war so terrible. God speed The Call and
the noble citizens of your State. b. F. JACOBS
afternoon with much enthusiasm at the
P'irst Congregational Church, and before
the meeting, which was presided over by
Rev. George E. Swan of St. Mark's Epis
copal Church, had adjourned HI members
had signed the roll. The new society,
which will co-operate with the general
Red Cross Society, has, as has already
been stated, for its main objects, to pre
pare surgical dressing and bandages, to
aid the wounded and to keep a record of
the sick and wounded.
The following officers of the eociety
were elected:
President. MrÂ«. Charles R, Greenleaf; first
vice president. Martin Kellogg, president of the
University of California: seoond vice presi
dent. Rev. George E. Swan; third vice presi
dent, Harry Hlllarrl; secretary, Mrp. George
Stratton; treasurer. Whitney Palache.
The following individuals signed the roll
of the society:
Mr. and Mrs. T. M. Osmont, Colons and
Mrs. C. R. Greenleaf, Mr. and Mrs. c. M

Mrs Harry Hiilard. Mr. and Mrs. Clinton Day,

care that cannot be lightened with a
smile.
Among the departing delegates were
many who are familiar figures. For ex
ample there was Grand Treasurer
Henry Martin. Every school boy in
the State knows Henry Martin and
knows that his popularity and great
good nature is only exceeded by his
weight. It is said that some of his
friends recently proposed that he take
command of a company of volunteers
to fight the Spaniards in Cuba. Martin
quietly but firmly refused, and when
pressed for his reasons gravely re
marked :
"A commander should be a level
headed man. I would never do because
I could not keep cool â in Cuba."
Of course that settled it. There is no
use to argue with a man who will joke
about so grave a matter as war. How
ever, this will not prevent his loving
friends from re-electing him to the of
fice of Grand Treasurer without opposi
tion.
Bob Martland, the popular manager
of the Native Sons' Hall, was a con
spicuous member of the throng. A
Grand Parlor without Martland would
be like a wagon without wheels. The
thing would drag. The annals of the
order contain only one instance when

Colonel Greenllef, by request, pave
some interesting and valuable unofficial
advice to the members of the new society
gathered from hia varied experiences in
the civil war. The colonel advised that
the society deal only with authorized
agents of the Government in order that
funds and supplies collected for the front
reach their destination. It was said after
the civil war that $1 toward the end of
the campaign did the work of $5 at the
, beginning beoause of the lack of proper
! organization. Tho routine of demand for
service of the kind that could be ren
dered by such a society as the Berkeley
branch would be, first, a request from the
surgoon-general to the Government for
supplies or service, and then, in case of
a temporary governmental shortage a de
mand would be made, most possibly
through Miss Barton, for the help of such
volunteer associations as the auxiliary
Red Cross Societies. The colonel advised
! the formation of committees for the un
i dertaking of specified lines of work as
; first, aid to the wounded, the making or
surgical dressings, the making of litters
etc., and keeping tho records of sick
wounded and dead, which latter, if it had
been effectively looked after during the
civil war \v( uld have saved an immense
amount of trouble in after years Then
a committee of finance is necessary for
often the appropriation for some specified
need of tho army will fall short during
war. and then is the time when effectual
help can be rendered by these patriotic
associations. The Bpeaker was sure that
the Berkeley physicians would be only
too glad to place themselves at the ser
vice of the members of the society, in the
he failed to appreciate a good joke It
was soon after his appointment to his
present position. This was just prior
to the session of the Grand Parlor held
two years ago at San Luis Obispo. As
a matter of business Martland had
some cards printed, across the center
of which there appeared in bold type
the words "Manager, N. S. G. W. Hall "
! His own name appeared in smaller type
in one Â«orner of the bit of cardboard.
Prior to his departure for San Luis
Obispo he telegraphed ahead to the Ho
tel Ramona to have apartments re
served for him. When he arrived at
the hotel he handed his card to the I
clerk and asked to be shown to his I
mom immediately. The clerk glanced ;
at the card and then at Martland, and
said:
"I am very sorry, Mr. Hall, but the
house is full and you will have to go
elsewhere for accommodations."
When the full significance of the sit
uation dawned on Martland he said not
a word, but beckoned to the circle of I
grinning friends and disappeared in the I
direction of the refreshment counter.
Ex-Milk Inspector Dockery, who is !
| one of the funmakers of the order, was
j a conspicuous figure in the crowd of j
Natives assembled at the ferry. He is
authority for the statement that there
will bo something doing when he and I
Ben Davis reach Nevada City. Davis' i
specialty is the preparation of little
surprises for candidates for initiation
Into the mystic rites of th-> side degree
of Argonauts. The friendly rivalry be- j
tween the Argonauts and the Curly
Bears is well known, a condition that
has led Davis to devise some new and
wholly entertaining (to the spectators)
features of the initiation of this year's
crop of candidates.
Mayor Phelan, who is a delegate from
Pacific Parlor >,o. 10, was among the ;
departing Natives. There was also i
Fred Lees, who enjoys the reputation of
always being able to participate in a ;
standing vote during the sessions of the
Grand Parlor. Joseph E. O'Donnell and
Judge Frank Kerrigan, who won fame
at Redwood Cltv last year by getting
lost and spending the whole of one 1
night in following the changing current j
in a tide slough, were on hand, each
having promised not to venture outside
the corporation limits at Nevada City, j
Kerrigan confided to several intimate
friends that he had been misrepre- !
sented in the tide slo.ugh Incident, a ,
fact which he attributes to the Invent
ive imagination of H. R. McNoble of
Stockton who is familiarly known j
among his brothers In the order as |
Judge Slough.
Another noticeable figure in the
crowd was that of Henry Lichtenstein
of Alcatraz Parlor No. 145, who enjoys
the reputation of being the Adonis of
the local delegation. There were also
many others whose faces have been
seen at every gathering of Grand Par
lor delegates during the past half
dozen years, and who are known to al
most every member of the order in the
State. It was as jolly a crowd as one
would wish to see and they may be ex
pected to give a good account of them
selves during the five days' session of
the Grand Parlor. Ample provision
had been made for their creature com
fort during the trip by rail, a circum
stance that did not add to the gayety
of the envious but admiring friends
who gathered at the ferry to bid them
farewell and good luck.

TO REPAIR THE DISASTER.
The Red Cross an Aid to the Resources of the
Hospital Copds.
About the only Immediate moans of repairing some of the disastrous
havoc wrought with the human anatomy during actual warfare are
through the medium of Red Cross societies or similar organizations. In
the formation and operation of such a humane institution as that you
are now establishing you have the hearty co-operation of all the sur
geons of the sanitary corps of the National Guard. Under the folds of
Red Cross banners sickness and wounds of friend and foe alike will re
ceive attention, and It is to the credit of humanity that whole-souled
philanthropists are placing at our disposal the means for allaying suffer

WANT CALIFORNIA'S CO-OPERATION.
WEST P HILADELPHIA. Pa., April 24, 1898.
To The Call, San Francisco, Cal.: The representatives of three States
will meet to-morrow to organize a national relief association. It will be
on the general plan of the Christian Commission, which was organized
during the civil war. Its object will be to assist the Government in car
ing for the sick and wounded on the battle-field and for the support and
care of the needy families of those who took up the musket at the coun
try's call and went to the front to battle for their homes and for tbe
cause of humanity. California and The Call are doing a noble work in hur

possibly drawing very near, for we have had,

we are unhappily involved I would (imp a
sober word of caution. Fancy not that the
United States with its fifty warships is goinj
to win an easy victory- over Spain with her 150
war vessels actually in commission. Fifty war
vessels cannot fizht the battles of starving
Cuba and guard the whole Atlantic seaboard
as well as the Pacific. On the chessboard of
war one United States Ironclad cannot watch
three Spanish ironclads and set the oppressed
Cubans free into the bargain without the help
of the God of battles. True we are waging a
war of humanity, and it is right that we
should.

deaths in Cuba by starvation than occurred in

prince of the powers of darkness is no mean
foe, and, while our cause is just, the hell of
devilish hate Is full of fire and somebody la

quench glowing brimstone. It is the business
of an enemy to deceive. Telegraphic reports
may be bulletined and published In good faith
by th.> newspapers, but while they proclaim
that the fleet in the Philippines still rides at

which sent them out may be steaming toward

OAKLAND SETS A
NEW PRECEDENT
Competition in. Utilities
May or May Not
Be Good.
"all for Volunteers Will Not
Cause a Dearth of
Candidates.
No Great Progress Can Be Made
Till the Water Front Case
Is Settled.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 24.
Onklnnd is now studying: a little prob
lem and is not in a hurry to reach a con
clusion. While it is generally realized
the world over that competition, espe
cially in the matter of supplying those
things often referred to as public utili
ties. Is desirable, this city seems to have
proved the contrary. This is not sur
prising, because Oakland generally has a
way of her own of doing everything, and
In this respect undoubtedly possesses
more individuality than any other city in
the country.
In the rr^pent instance Oakland is
thoughtfully reviewing the possibility of
competition in the supply of her lighting
system in the light of her experience
with water companies. Four years ago
everybody rejoiced at the prospect of be
ing released from the monopoly of The Co
ntra Costa Water Company. Mass meetings
â were held, bands played, all kinds of re
joicing were manifested, and had a throne
of gold been available at that time Mr.
"William J. Dingee would have been car
ried Into it on the shoulders of the popu
lace. Time passed on, and the history of
water companies since that time is known
1. Fur a while water was cheap,
thru it was cheaper, for a short time it
almost given away; and then uime
table. The enemies combined,
the Council was persuaded it was its
\ extortionate water rates, and
- ect now is that water-users will
than enough the next liscal
to m;ik> up to the late rival com
b ali they have lost iv their leglti
sea as well as in politics.
Sow then :> a prospect of another gas
nterfng the Held. It is starting
: the same principle as that
â â  water company. An endeavor
. to secure contracts to sup
:u;iit at a lower ligure than is now
i- :r,g charted. The new venture has
: it yet made any investments nor will
!; do so until sufficient inducement is of
â \\ nether it will ever materialize
or not is, however, not the most impor
feature of the problem. The old
company, which baa it ;>.<.. i â 
: that it does not want a fight
It has shown this desire
to avoid competition for many years and
has been gratified. It has on more than
one occasion, in fact on many, met the
nds of the people half way, and in
.though a corporation and
a monopoly, it cannot be said to be un
popular. There is on the part of the peo
feeltng of satisfaction that the rield
on thii the bay is sufficiently In- |
viting to attract a rival company, and
there is a general idea that the best pur- j
mmunlty will be subserved
g the competition between the
one hand, using the willingness
of capital to come here as their lever, and
mi any 'on the other hand,
rather than have two companies com
with power to keep out other capi
rrayed against the people with prac
no defense on their side. This po
. is not without much to recommend
it and is somewhat unique when com
pared with the general opinions regarding
. impetition. â¢
Hut Oakland has a happy knack of dis
regarding precedent.
Jf the present war should be the means
of transporting from this county a mod
erately sized regiment of office-seekers
and of keeping them away until after
next November there are many ordinary
citizens who would have no regrets.
Neither should this be a difficult matter,
the expressions of patriotism coming
from those willing to sacrifice themselves
for the public service are sincere. Nearly
one of them now considers It neces
eary to wear a little flap on his lapel, and
ever he meets a knot of voters to
aa the most fulsome love for his
â  and regard for her in the hour
â  peril. Such sentiments are to be
.- adzdired, but if those uttering
were to patronize the recruiting of
â¢ the volunteer station Instead ol tae
I where votes may be influenced the
t for them would be no less than
bresi â¢;. With the cape which tne
: alian ballot system makes it pos
for Independent candidates to get on
allot, there is a prospect that the
dates' li*t in this county next No
r will be as long as the roster of
the largest company of National Guards
within the Stale.
There is aparently no possibility that
the number of volunteers among offlce
pÂ»eking politicians who will rally to the
c of their country will cause a
dearth of candidates for county offices.
Once again Oakland's attention is called
to her water front. After forty-five years
of a contest, the whole matter seems as
Intricate as ever, and is far from a solu
tion. In the meantime, Oaklanders are
forever asking why their city does not
grow faster. Who ever heard of a city
with a magnificent water front expecting
to grow normally until its harbor is de
veloped? Considering the opposition to
Oakland's progress since the town incor
porated in 1552, its development, remem
bering its nearness to San Francisco, has
been remarkable. The city of to-day,
however. Is but a sample of what It would
have been had this great question been
settled twenty years ago. If the popula
tion on this side of the bay is to increase
(as some believe) until it exceeds that of
Ban Francisco, it will only be done by the
establishment of manufactories. Such
places can only be built on the water
front, and will never be built until the In
vest â¢â its can be guaranteed immunity from
attacks on their title.
Surely this little argument Is enough to
convince any skeptic of what is the para
mount duty of Oakland.
The School Board has a pleasant task
on its hands. It has $15,000 to spare and to
spend, and it is almost at a loss how to
g<n rid of it. Some time ago the School
Board acquired Ji.'.ooo for the purpose of
purchasing a lot and removing the Tomp
kins School to a more northern locality.
The city Council, after hearing argument,
decided not to permit the removal of the
school; consequently there Is a nice little
cum lyinj; Idle. Several propositions have
already been advanced as to how to spend
the money, but it would seem to any one
on the outside tliat the question has been
already answered. When Superintendent
McClymonds appeared before the board
to advocate the removal of the Tompklns
ij be -stated that It is absolutely
sary to have more school accommo
: s .somewhere in the neighborhood of
. und Tenth streets. Mr Krosnahan
l that for less than $15,000 a small
bi I 00l that would relieve the pressure in
that district could easily be built, and
&Wiarently this is the logical use to which
the money should be put.

PEACE, WAR,
RIGHTEOUSNESS
Rev. R. F. Coyle Declares

Good for America, Good for

Rev. R. F. Coyle of the First Presby
terian Church spoke to-night on "Peace,
War and Righteousness," taking for his
text "The work of righteousness shall be
peace, and the effect of righteousness
quietness and assurance forever." After
referring to our moving army and navy
and the spirit of war that pervades every
one he said:
Now all this Is worth thinking about in con
nection with our present difficulty with Spain.
It may paralyze trade, it may cost a vast
deal or treasure, and the life of many a gal
t lant soldier and carry sorrow and heartache
: Into many a home. It may mean destruction
, on sea and devastation on land, and produce
consequences that will be felt around the
; world. Now that the start has been made no
; one is wise enough to tell where it will end.
It may be short or it may be long. It may
: be local or it may spread along all our
coasts. But however far it reaches and how
ever dreadful it may be, the outcome of it will
be goodâ good for America, good for Cuba,
good for the world.
; And particularly so, because the United
States draw.s the sword, not for purposes of
conquest, not for territorial extension, not for
commercial advantage, but in the name and for
the sake of humanity. Our neighbor* are in
trouble. They are suffering and starving and
dying. They have been robbed and plundered
and oppressed until their groans and appeals
nave sounded across this broad land and
aroused its sympathy and kindled Its Indig
nation: and through its Congress and Presi
dent the people have said to Spain: "Stop 1 .
Hands off. Get out: In the name of hu
manity you shall no more crush and con
' tume these brave islanders! By your treach
, erous and infamous mlsgovernment you have
forfeited the right to fly your dishonored flag
i over Cuban soil any lunger. Begone, and leave
these people free and independent!" Uncle
Sam was a good while saying itâ too long, per
hapsâbut he said it at last with an emphasis
that made tyranny tremble, and now he Is
backing It up with the solemn and 'mmortaf
declaration with his soldiers and battleships.
To my mind there is something grand and
sublime about It. In all history so far as I
can recall. It stands alone. The principle be
\ hind this struggle on the part of the Unite*
States partakes of the lofty altruism of the
Gospel of Jesus Christ. We are going to war
for the welfare or the other man. We are
playing the good Samaritan. We are bind
ing up the wounds which Spain nan made. We
, are spending millions of money and giving
â  tens of thousands of soldiers to die if need
i be, to liberate a poor, ignorant, impoverished
I race, whr.se help we do not need and whose
: Independence will probably do nothing to en
rich us. Our purpose is purely unselfish. All
we propose to do Is to emancipate Cuba and
compel the Spanish Pharoah to let her peo
; pie go. It Is a noble misÃlon and can no
more fail than the purposes of God can fan.
It Is a cause worthy of the flag which Wash
ington carried and Lincoln defended and
hundreds of thousands of heroic men died to
keep In the sky. As it goes into the battle,
on land or on sea. It will go at the head of
soldiers who fight for Justice, for liberty for
humanity, for God. And as it comes out of
the battle it will come out victorious, as It
always has in tha past, and be more than ever
"Old Glory- It will be one on which heaven
can smile In benediction. This uprising is holy.
Our cause Is righteous, and the fruit of right
eousness is peace. Beyond this struggle and
because of it. on the open gates of the twen
tieth century, the eyes of the worM will read
the great lesson enforced by the United States. I
that tyranny must stop, and that the poorest |
and weakest and most Insignificant of men
have a right to be Justly and humanely gov
erned.

FATAL FALL OF
A YOUNG GIRL
Ellen Smith Picked Up
Dying in a Back
Yard.
No One Saw the Accident,
but a Neighbor Heard
the Fall.
Only a Month Ago the Mother Was
Claimed by Death, at San
Hafael.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 24.
Ellen Smith, a young miss of 14 Rum
mers, fell down a back stairs this morn
ing at 1668 Williams street and died in
twenty-five minutes.
No one saw the accident, but Mrs. Dris
coll, the next-door neighbor, heard the
child stn.ve the ground and was the first
one to reach her. She was unconscious
and never recovered sufficiently to speak.
The Smiths only recently came to this
city from San Rafael, where the wife
and mother was buried about a month
ago. The father was left with the daugh
ter and a 10-year-old Bon.
Mr. Smith was occupied in placing some
carpet in the house when Mrs. Driscoll
notified him of the terrible accident. The
child was carried Into the basement and
Dr. J. Maher summoned. He reached
the sufferer about fifteen minutes after
the accident and found that circulation
had stopped. She was removed to the
house and placed in bed.
Restoratives and stimulants were ad
ministered, but without avail. The child
opened her eyes once and tried to speak,
but made no sound. In ten minutes after
the doctor arrived she was dead. Dr.
Maher made an examination, but a mark
on the nose was the only sign of the ac
cident. He pronounced her death due to
the failure of her heart to withstand the
shock. He said Internal injuries might be
found upon a post-mortem examination.
The Coroner will hold an inquest.

IN CHURCH

Lively Scene in
Church.
Attempts to Interrupt the

The Sight ol a Police Sergeant Causes
Mrs. Davis to Go Into a
Swoon.
OAKLAND. April 24,-Sergeant Peter
son of the police department was called
upon during the opening exercises of the
Central Christian Church to-night to put
out the Rev. Edwards Davis, the former
pastor, for ra.ising a disturbance. Mrs.
Davis fainted and a genuine sensation
followed. As soon as his wife recovered
sufficiently, Mr. Davis, his father, moth
er, wife and a half-dozen of his support
ers withdrew.
The Christian Church has arranged for
a trial of the charges of the retired pas
tor by representatives of the First Church
in this city, two churches in San Fran
cisco and the Alameda and Berkeley
churches. The meetings are to begin to
morrow night, and would have been kept
quiet but for Mr. Davis' actions. This
evening early he demanded of Mr. Saw
yer that a public announcement should
be made from the pulpit before the
church officers. If it were not, he de
clared that he would make it himself.
Mr. Sawyer said he would do nothing of
the kind, that he was paid to run the
meeting and it would be run without In
terruption, and if Mr. Davis attempted to
speak he would have him put out. Mr. !
Davis replied that there should be six i
good strong, men to do the ejecting.
Just before the service Mr. Sawyer
asked his deacons whether he should
make the announcement of the coming '
trial. They agreed that he should, stat- I
ing that Mr. Davis had asked that it be
aA&ounced. When the regular announce- I
ments were made this was included as j
a request from Mr. Davis. The song was
fiven out, and as the pastor sat down
ir. Davis arose and attempted to deny
that he had asked for a trial. Mr. Saw
yer insisted -that he should not be heard,
but Mr. Davis tried to talk at the same
time. Sergeant Peterson, who sat in the
audience aa a precaution against trouble,
stepped forward at this exciting time and
introduced himself. Mrs. Davis fainted,
and the evangelist saw that he was out- 1
wilted. He turned his attention to his
wife, instead of the pastor, and with help '
soon had her out of the hall. When seen
on the street, just as he came from the
meeting, Mr. Davis said:
"I never saw anything so outrageous in
my life. When 1 attempted to defend my- |
self they called in s<n officer. Of course, I j
could do nothing, for I was disturbing a â 
religious service, and he would have i
taken me out if I had kept on. A week
ago I returned to Oakland after two
months' evangelistic engagement to de
mand specific statement of the ambiguous
charges through the mouthpiece of Mr
Sawyer. The week passed, and Saturday
night I received word from said party
that an investigation might be had. The
officers w<_-re not consulted in the matter
until later. But meanwhile the preacher
detective had arranged with an enemy to
select my juilpes.
"This morning I received a letter from
a ,ady member, asking me to take no
action to-day aa the investigation should
be averted, while she at the same time
was visiting the parties to be invited. I
would not tru^the character of my own
holy mother in the hands of some she
had selected. I hereby publicly state that
I am willing to stand examination before
the elders of the Central Christian
Church, and to abide the action of the
congregation If public announcement is
made with that in view, but I am not go
ing to be Investigated by a committee ap
pointed by a set of enemies, and be
judged by a general assembly to which
Mr. Sawyer has sent out the investiga
tions. So many of the members of the
church have become disgusted with the
star-chamber council, that I would not
be surprised to have it proved that I had
horns and hoofs. The elders of the
church have not been present for weeks,
Deacons Magill, Griffith, Tate and Mc-
Arthur have all resigned. I will not fight
with a fragment. It may investigate.
But it will not investigate me until such
a committee shall be arranged by the
church and its officers in a proper way."
The investigation will commence Mon
day night behind closed doors.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. Xtie top fig
ures at station Indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath It, If any, the
â¢mount of rainfall or of melted snow In Inches
and hundredths during the . ast twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear en the Washington -oast. When
the pressure Is hlch In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
nnd south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "hlph" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In Rummer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce aa
opposite result.

What Epworth League
Is Striving and Hop
ing For.
An Interesting Convention
Brought to a Successful
Determination.
All Satisfied With thÂ» Work Accom
plished, but Further Efforts Will
Be Put Fortli.
The closing exercises of the Epworth
League Convention were held last even-
Ing in Metropolitan Temple. Enthusiasm
and patriotism were at a high pitch and
the Interesting addresses delivered wore
applauded with a will. The work of the
convention and the success attained lias
been most gratifying to the members of
the organization, and better work is
looked forward to during the coming year
because of t!;.- gathering.
Yesterday morning sunrise prayer
meetings were held In the various church
es in the city, and the attendance showed
that the majority of those, both local and
visiting, had taken an interest in the ser
vices. At 11 o'clock the regular services
were held in the places of worship and
later the Sunday school classes held their
meetings.
In the evening the League hold devo
tional services in the Howard-street
Church, and by special arrangement
preaching pervi.-es followed. During the
day a large number of the members ex
pressed their intention of joining the
SONG AND CHEERS MARKED A SUCCESS
The Epworth Leanuers Close Their Convention and
Praise The Call.
The Epworth League is the Young People's Society of the Methodist
Episcopal Church. It has a membership of nearly 2,000,000. Ten thousand
>c are within the boundary of the California Conference, which em
braces the northern portion of California. This is the first conference
convention we have held in the California Conference, and its success has
lur most sanguine expectations. The attendance has been
1753. These come from thirty-two counties. San Francisco furnished the
large?' Alameda came second in point of attendance, Santa
Clara third and Sonoma fourth. Considering the limited population of
the patronizing territory, this has been an exceptionally well attended
convention.
The programme has given the best satisfaction. The papers during
the day have been practical and helpful, and the evening addresses have
roused great enthusiasm. The audiences have filled great auditorium.-.
The results, we believe, will be all that could be desired. It will give
new methods of w irk; II will give fresh inspirations for work, and It will
prove a great ;;;â :; In the personal Christian life of very many young
Christians. It has been a patriotic body of young Americans, who were
ready to chc i sing the songs with the warmest fervor.
Some of its members are members of the militia, which will stand ready
i" fight for national honor and human freedom.
Our work will receive a splendid Impetus from this convention, and
we have every reason to feol that it has been a grand success.
The reports in The Call have been highly appreciated for their fullness
and fairness and accuracy, and ha\-e been a means of communication to
thousands of leaguers all over the State.
We shall look for the best year of league work we have had In North
ern California. E. P. DENNETT, Conference President.
party which will visit lit. Tamalpals to
day, and in the evening they will gather
hundreds strong to listen to the words of
John P. D. John, who will deliver his re
ply to Robert Ingersoll, "Did Man Make
God or Did God Make Man?"
Following the preaching services a mass
meeting was held in the Temple and the
crush was so great that an overflow meet
' ing was held tn Central Church, where
hundreds who were unable to find even
standing room in the Metropolitan Tem
ple gathered to listen to the words of
Rev. Dr. Locke. The Temple had been
still further decorated for the closing ex
ercises and presented a beautiful scene.
The stars and stripes were In profusion
and the scarlet and white banners of the
League Reemed to be everywhere.
At the opening ol the services Rev.
Richard Moyle, of the University of the
Pacific, sang "Come Unto Me." A song
service followed, and then Rev. E. S.
Chapman delivered his address on "The
'League vs. the Salo n." Amonz other
things he said: "This is not a war with
Spain, but against King Alcohol. He has
caused more suffering: than all the Cuban
outrages, and each day adds new hor
rors to the scene. They tell us that to
morrow the President will declare war.
We have already declared war, and
against a terrible foe to piness and
comfort. The nation wantH volunteers
Jor one and two years, bul we want them
for ever and ever. We are rmined
that the saloon must go, and our deter
mination must win. We must organ
ise arainst the evil and thrust It
from the face of the earth. We must
fnirify polit and the young men who
go to the polls should vote for right and
right only. The women should be al
lowed to vote, and what a help they
â¢would be to our cause. We nt-ed en
thusiasm among our young, and we will
have it as the proper spirit is becoming
enthused into their veins. The day of
battle is upon us and the day of victory
close at hand."
"Christ for the World, and the World
for Christ" was the subject of the in
teresting address delivered by Rev. W.
C. Evans, D.D. In part he stated that
activity In the work and loyalty to God
â were the main points to be depended
tipon and success would follow, as Christ
had saved the world and the world should
appreciate it. "An open Bible and closed
saloons," he said, "will accomplish our
object in view and for which we are striv
ing with our might." Dr. W. w. Case,
chairman of the resolution committee,,
read a report In which the work was
compliment'il ,-md thanks tendered to the
press. It was also resolved that the
members of the league lead their hearty
support to the interests of the Red Cross
Society.
At this tim personal testimony and
Suggestions from members of the con
vention were heard on "The Beat Things
In Experience and in Work," under the
leadership of Dr. Cnase. A call by dis
tricts was made and Interesting but brief
Ideas given. Consecration followed and
(i successful and highly interesting con
vention of the Bpworth League of the
State was brought to a close.

lift sound inviting, in view of other bar-

The piece calls for a long cast of live

noted, gets them. Frederick Paulding,

tneatricalism and extravagance play
directly into Mr. Pauldmg's hand, but his

be attributed only to this temperamental I

Trilby, too. seems to find a fortunate
interpreter in Fannie Gillette, who, al
though now and Hun a bit too grandiose
in delivery for the frankness of the girt,
gives the part with pretty feeling. The

At this time of day it is not necessary
to discuss the dramatic values of the
Potter-Du Maurler hypnodrama. It is
perhaps enough to say that the piece still
has its charms for many persons and
that it does not lose them in the presenta

Handball With an Inovation.
A game of handball will be played In
Phil Ryan's San Francisco court, at 858
Howard street, on next Wednesday after
noon at -:20. in which an innovation in
the ancient game will be introduced.
This departure from the customary way
is brought about by a French professor
from Buenos Ayres, who has played his
way up from the southern clime, "defeat
ing all competitors. In the City of Mex
ico and elsewhere he met none to beat
him. hence he has thrown down the gaunt
let in this city to any two of the local
champions. The French professor's in
novation in the game is that he plays
with an Instrument shaped like a racquet
bat, such as is used In the lawn tennis
court, with the exception that he is
made of solid oak.
Thi" match for next Wednesday after
noon will be between the champions and
T. K. Bonnet and R. Llnehan, for a
prize of SluO. which will be used as a
trophy in the coming' games scheduled
at this court as previously announced.
Thi.^ game promises to be full of life
and fun, as the newcomer will meet two
of the best local players.

THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 25, 189 S.
CONFIRMATION AT
ST. PETERS'
Over Two Hundred Children
Receive the Sacrament From
Archbishop Riordan.
Hundreds of Catholics and Non-
Caiholics Crowd the Edifice to
Witness the Ceremony,
Amid the chanting of hymns, the recital
of prayer and the organ prelude of the
glorious Veni Creator, the sacrament of
confirmation was administered to over
two hundred boys and girls yesterday
afternoon at St. Peter's Church. The
church, as is usual, was crowded to its
utmost capacity with non-Catholics and
1 non-Catholics alike who crowded the aisles
and blocked the entrance to the edifice
eager to see the impressive ceremony,
one of the most Impressive in the Catho
lic church.
Promptly at 2:30 o'clock as the Arch
bishop, robed in his sacred vestments
and followed by his assistant priests, en
tered the sanctuary, being met with
chant of the childish voices accompanied
by peals of music from the great organ
which echoed and re-echoed throughout
the church. The children upon the en
trance of the Archbishop rose and in or
derly procession marched to the altar
rail where they waited the anointment of
chrism and the blessing of the church.
The girls, over a hundred in number,
were robed in white, their faces being
covered with veils of white, the emblem
of purity, while the boys were dressed
in black suits with white and gold rib
bons attached to the left arm.
Upon the conclusion of the ceremony
a brief addrfss was delivered by Arch
bishop Rlorqan upon the object of con
firmation and the necessity of the sac
rament as a means of salvation. He lik
ened that stage of life when a knowledge
of self, religion ami the world is demand
ed before tile sacrament i-an be adminis
tered, to the budding time of springâ the
spring time of life.
The Rev. Fathers Mulligan and McDon
ald assisted at the altar as masters of I
ceremony. Upon the conclusion of the i
benediction, which followed the ceremony
of confirmation, the sacred blessing of ;
the Archbishop was given, and that con
cluded the services.

A Robber Identified.
The two Japanese gardeners who were
held tip in their house on Harold avenue,
Ingleside, Thursday niglit, called at the
City I'ii son yesterday, and one of them
Identified Charles Leonard, the one
armed man, as one of the robbers. An
other witness will be taken to the prison
to-day to have a look at Leonard, and if
he identifies him also Leonard will be
booked on the charge.
Killed Himself With Poison.
Frank Williams, residing with his wife
and two children at 2 Wheelock place,
committed suicide yesterday afternoon
by taking a dose of poison. The only rea
son alleged for his taking his life was
that he had a trifling disagreement with
his wife during the fore loon. This made
him angry and he left home, but re
turned and uade his wife and children
good-by. The next seen of him was when
his dead body was found. The Coroner
was notified and had the body removed
to the Morgue.
RANSACKED A STORE.
Burglars Carry Off a Wagon-Load of
Provisions.
Burglars, last Saturday night, broke In
to a grocery store at Post and William
streets, and stole a miscellaneous assort
ment of liquors, cigars and provisions.
An entrance was effected by prying open
the front door with a jimmy.
The proprietor, Michael Merigan, closed
the store shortly after 10 o'clock. Several
hours later a policeman found that the
place had been thoroughly ransacked.
Shortly before midnight last night
Merigan visited police headquarters and
asked that an officer be sent to watch his
store. He feared that the burglars
would return and carry off everything
they could lay their hands on. He said
he saw two suspicious looking characters
around the store. From the fact that
they got away with a large quantity of
provisions he Is inclined to believe that
they had a wagon in waiting.
After listening to his complaint the
officer in charge sent two policemen to
watch the store in the hope that the
burglars might return.
HELENA STACK'S
TRAGIC DEATH
Speculation as to Whether It
Was Accidental or
Suicidal.
The Deceased Was a Bright and
Ambitious Student at thÂ«
State University.
BERKELEY, April 24.â The body of
Miss Helena Stack, the young woman
who met death yesterday in the waters
of the bay near Tiburon, was to-day
brought to the Stack residence, 2601 Dur
ant avenue, Berkeley. The members of
the family are prostrated by the shock of
the tragic and sudden death of the un
fortunate young lady.
Considerable mystery surrounds the
death of the young lady. She had been j
for some time a sufferer from ill health, j
and in addition was a very hard student.
She was a member of the junior class
of the State University in the college of
letters and a hard worker. It is believed
by some that ill health and overstudy j
drove her temporarily insane, and that in
a fit of mental aberration she sought her
own destruction. The college work in
the classical course, which she was pur
suing, is considered particularly difficult,
and the approaching annual examinations
may have caused the unfortunate student
to tax her mental powers beyond their
limit.
For the past three weeks, however,
Miss Stack had been forced, on account
of ill health, to take a vacation and tem
porarily to abandon her college work.
She had been advised to take trips occa
sionally into the country, and it is be
lieved that she started for Tiburon yes
terday on an outing for her health.
Whether she was suddenly seized with a
suicidal mania after she started, to row
from Tiburon to Belvedere, or whether
she was suddenly seized with sickness
and fell accidentally into the water, is
uncertain. The fact tbat the body was
found lloating within five minutes after
the young lady disappeared beneath the
water lends some support to the theory
tbat she was unconscious when she fell
into the water.
The unfortunate young student was
particularly bright in her studies. In IR9I
she graduated with honors from the Va-
I'-nrlÃ, now the Harare Mann Grammar
School of San Francisco, and with simi
lar distinction from the Girls' High
School four years later. She was ambi
tious to graduate from the university
next year with the degree of bachelor of
arts.. Both she and her sister. Miss
Katherine Stack, who was taking the
same course, were quite wrapped up In
their coll<>pp work. It was principally for
their convenience that the family moved,
pome timo since, from their former resi
dence, 20 Hill street, San Francisco, to
the university town.
ArninÃements for the funeral have not
yet been definitely made. The members
of tho junior class at the university will
probably meet to-morrow to pass resolu
tions of regret and condolence upon the
death of their classmate.
SAN RAFAEL, April 24.â A jury was
Impaneled by Coroner Eden this morn-
Ing to Inquire into the cause of tho death
of Helena Stack, who was drowned near
Tiburon yesterday.
The mo.<--t Important evidence given was
by P. de Sella. the boatman who rented
the idrl the t">at. He said that she got
it about 1:15 p. m.. telling him yhe knew
how to handle one. and then asking that
extra cushions be put in as she would
meet a party at Belvedere. She appeared
cheerful, and started to row away in good
pplrits. The discovery of the body and
tin boat has already been recounted.
After some discussion the jury decided
that Miss Stack came to her "death by
accidental drowning. The father was
present at the inquest, and left for Berke
ley with the remains at 11 a. m. The
only testimony the father gave of any
Importance vas that he did not know
the girl intended to leave home for Bel
vedere at all.
George Green Goes East.
George Green, the well-known boxer,
will leave for the East to-morrow morn
inp. accompanied by Frank Foster of the
Olympic Club. Ho will go by way of thi>
north, visiting Seattle, Tacoma and Van
couver. In New York he expects to win
pugilistic laurels In return matches with
Charles McKeever and YValcott.

SAN FRANCISCO ALERT FOR THE FOE
THE local situation yesterday ex
hibited a high pitch of war feel-
Ing in spite of the fact that it was
Sunday. A number of San Fran
cisco patriots are doing all In
their power to organize companies of
volunteers, and their efforts are meet
ing with success.
The militia boys are expecting to be
called at any moment, while the harbor
defenses are progressing to completion
rapidly wherever a few finishing
touches were necessary.
A casual study of the sermons and
lectures delivered in the city shows
that speakers all take the point that
this war is one for the rights of man.
Without going into legal details the
general tendency of the sermons and
lectures delivered in the city was to
the effect that the cause of the United
States rests on the broad grounds of
Christianity and humanity, and while
many deplored the horrors of war as
a remedy for the evils of the situation
all agreed that severe measures are at
times necessary to stamp cmt old
abuses and inhuman methods of perse
cution.
EXPECT ORDERS.
Governor Budd Waiting to
Hear From the War
Department.
It was a quiet flay at the adjutant
generaTa beadquartera yesterday. As
had been expected by the Governor and
his staff, no orders were received from
the War Department at Washington, D.
c. bo another day of anxious vigil was
the reward of th>>se who patiently waited,
hoping that the eagerly awaited orders
might come.
The local press announced that Califor
nia's quota of men that she will be re
quired to furnish under the army volun
teer bill Is 2238. This was the subject "of
much discussion at headquarters, as the
adjutant-general ami Captain Carrington
arc unable t<> ascertain upon what basis
the Government figures this to be the
number <'f men which the State will be
: upon* to furnish. If the census of
1890 is taken as the basis, and it is un
od that the call Is based upon the
population of each State at that time,
then California's quota will be 2411 men.
total population of the United
s was 62,622,250. 'Hi- call is for 126,
men, and California's population In
1890 was 1,208,130. Multiplying the State's
ation by the total number of men
. for and dividing by the entire pop
ulation is the only way tv get each State's
pro rata, and this gives California 2411 In

to know what he should do, and was told
by the adjutant that he would have to

EACH TO HIS DUTY.
A Strong Call to Arms
From the Pulpit.
At the Churrh of the Holy Spirit, 2127
Jackson street, Rev. Oliver C. Miller
preached a strong sermon on the war, of
which the following is a part. He took
for his text Joshua x:13:
"And the 6un stood stfH, and the moon
stayed, until the people had avenged them
selves upon their enemies."
"Solomon has said there Is a time for
every purpose under the sun, a time for
war and a time for peace. War is now
the duty of the hour. Let all that is
heroic rise within us. Let each one re
turn to his God and ask, â¢What wilt thou
have me to do?" and then bravely do It.
"That our world has reached that ad
vanced stage of civilization that does
away with war is a deceptive dream.
The world is still full of brutality, ani
malism and injustice, and blood-letting is
Btili good for nations. The Scriptures de
clare that wars shall increase and in
volve the whole earth, until the second
coming of the Prince of Peace. The name
"Joshua' has come to stand for courage.
It is the same as 'Jesus,' who was the
bravest man that ever trod the earth. To
be his followers we must be brave or our
lives are an absurdity and a lie. Paul,
who stood next to his Master In cour
age, said: 'I count not my life dear unto
myself,' and like his Master laid down
his life in the cause of humanity. Jesus
Was :t patriot.
"The text Is God's indorsement for
righteous warfare. Then let us rally
around our President and say as did the
peopl'- to Joshua, "Slack not thy hand."
Do not let us waste time talking who
fired the lirst shot. That was fired weeks
ago and an awful one It was, hurling 266
of our brave sailors without a moment's
warning before the judgment seat. Our
cause is that of humanity. Jesus the
Captain of our salvation fell upon this
came battlefield. Had we not taken these
steps as a nation it would have been a
shame to have been called an American
citizen. No one can appreciate the bless
ing of good government until It is imper
iled; without it there Is no prosperity
and happiness. It must therefore be
maintained at all hazards. But let us
i dI enter the conflict in a bitter spirit,
but p<i In the Spirit of the Captain of our
Salvation, praying for our enemies. Let
out motto be. 'Pray as you fight and
fight as you pray.' On both sides our
Lord will be with those who are his; and
should they fall, will give them a quick
transit from the blood and horror of the
battlefield into the realms of eternal
peace. It is the same with a nation as
it is with an Individual. Sin means suf
fering. Our nation is not free from sin;
she must therefore suffer and bo purified
as by fire. For nation and individual the
law of eWanslng is the same. "Without
the shedding of blood there is no remis
sion of sins.'
"Yes, let the sun and moon of peaceful
pursuits stand still. War is the duty of
the hour. Let us sacrifice all to regain
that "pearl of great price,' 'a truly pa
triotic and humane spirit.' Let us call
a halt in living for worldly pleasure and
money-making, and let our hearts throb
with higher purposes. As the sweet,
aelf-sacrificlÃK spirit of Queen Isabella of
Spain pledged her jewels to give us
America, let us lay upon the altar of
sacrifice all that is dearest to give her
in return a true Christian civilization
The God who stopped the sun to prolong
the victory of Joshua will watch over us
from heaven. Let us make Jehovah Jesus
our Commander, and 'the stars in their
courses that fought against Slsera' will
fight for us. Let us enter the conflict
orayerfully. Let those who stay at home
GENERAL MERRIAM AND STAFF INSPECT THE GUNS.
All Fortifications in the Harbor of San Francisco Visited.
THE GENERAL AND HIS OFFICERS LANDING AT THE PRESIDIO,
When the Government steamer General McDowell cast off from Clay-street wharf yesterday morning at 9
o'clock, there were on board, besides her regular complement of officers and men. General Henry C. Merriam, com
manding the Department of California; Major Thomas H. Barry, adjutant general of the Department of the Col
umbia, and Colonel Suter, of the United States engineer corps. The object of the trip was for the purpose of visit
ing the different fortifications In San Francisco harbor, and to make such observations as may be of advantage to
the military authorities stationed here.
The General McDowell proceeded to the Presidio, stopping at Alcatraz and. Angel Islands and at Fort Mason,
taking on board, at the different points, Major Edward Field, acting adjutant general of the Department of Califor
nia; Colonel Marcus I. Miller, Third Artillery 1 ; Captain Sedgwlck Pratt, Third Artillery, and Lieutenant Eugene
T. Wilson, Second Artillery. Upon their arrival at the Presidio the party was met by Lieutenant Colonel Louis T.
Morris, of the Fourth Cavalry. Immediately upon leaving the steamer the entire party entered conveyances and
were driven to Fort Point, where the ten-Inch, flfteen-lnch and eight-inch muzzle loading guns, the ten-inch and
twelve-inch breech-loading guns, and the dynatmite guns were Inspected, after which General Merriam, and It he
other officers accompanying him, returned to the Presidio, where they boarded the McDowell and were taken to
Lime Point, and a thorough inspection made of the high power guns recently placed there.
The steamer was next headed for Raccoon Straits, where careful and extended observations were made,
presumably for the purpose of selecting an advantageous location for the establishment of a new point of harbor
defense, where it Is expected high power guns will be mounted.
Leaving Raccoon Straits, the McDowell returned the officers to the various posts from which they had been
taken.
No review or display of any kind was made at the fortifications Inspected, and the prescribed salute of thir
teen guns, due a general of the army, was, by direction of General MeiTiam, dispensed with.
serve and pray for those who go to bat
tle. Let each in the right spirit enter
the conflict at some post of duty, lest the
angel of the Lord shall say unto us,
'Curse ye Meroz, curse ye bitterly the In
habitants thereof, because they cam* 1 not
to the help of the I,ord, to the help of the
Lord against the mighty.' "
WAR FOR HUMANITY.
Sermons of Drs. Mackenzie
and Jenks at First Pres
byterian Church.
The confjrefcation at the First Presbyterian
Church on Van Ness avenue and Sacramento
street was treated to two sermons at the
morning and afternoon ser%-lce yesterday on
the coming war that will long bf? remembered
by those whose good fortune it was to be
present.
Dr. Mackenzie took his text from Isaiah,
lx:ll: "Therefore the Lord shall set up the
adversaries." He said this is not a war of
conquept, a war of Invasion or a war oi re
venue, but a war for humanity. The history
of Spain was gone over to show Its cruelty
A ROYAL PRINCE IS HERE.
The Nephew of the King of Belgium a
Guest at the Palace,
Albert Leopold Clement Marie, Comte de Flandre and Prince of
the Blood, has arrived and is at the Palace. He came in yesterday after
noon from the Yosemite, where he has been passing a few days on his
way from Los Angeles to this city.
The Count is the nephew of Leopold, King of the Belgians, and is
making a tour of the United States for pleasure and to extend and en
large his education. He is a young man, being only 23 years of age, and
is accompanied on his travels by M. Joostens, secretary of the Belgian lega
tion at "Washington; H. Jungbluth, aid de camp, and Dr. L. Melis, his own
private physician. Besides these gentlemen, the party Is Increased by
several servants, who travel ahead of the rest for the purpose of looking
after the accommodations and taking care of the twenty odd trunks
which constitute the baggage of the young Prince and his suite.
The Prince left London on March 2, and came directly to New York.
From there he went to Washington, visiting the intermediate cities en
route, and then proceeded westward to the Pacific Coast by the way of
New Orleans.
He Is traveling in strict incognito, and when he registered at the Pal
ace yesterday he appeared on the books of that hostelry as plain Mr.
Rethy. He will remain in the city and the vicinity some time studying
the different institutions of the State and gleaning as much information
of a social, political and institutional character as is possible In a short
length of time. Where the party will go after leaving here has not yet
been finally decided, but it is probable that, before they leave the coast,
a tour of inspection will be made of all the northern coast and Sound'
ports.
THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 25, 1898.
through all ages when it hail the power to be
cruel. Having: ha<l at one time the possession
â¢>f all this part of America it lost it by no
other cause than that of Ita cruel treatment of
Its subjects. The present cruel war waged on
the Cubans was gone over very minutely to
prove this assertion.
In the evening I >r. E. H. Jenks, the assist
ant pastor, lectured on the same subject. He
took his text fmm Isaiah 1111:61. He said the
teaching of Christ was for peace, but when
the spirit of tolerance, justice and humanity
Instead of spreading peace has led on to fresh
outrages, then there is cause for war. This
Is a war for humanity. Tills nation Is the
magistrate, her armies the executive to pun
ish criminal*. It is a contest between me
dieval and modern civilization. We disclaim
sordidnesÃ. America is the proper nation to
perform this high and holy duty in the name
of the higher Christian civilization.
Out of this will come free Cuba and free
Spain, a united people, knowing no north,
no pouth, no longer two hemispheres, but one
world, Anglo-Saxon, civilizing and leading the
upper forces of the world.
THE FIRST CHECK.
Mrs. William Alvord, the first regent
of Sequoia Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution, and the present
honorary State regent for California, sent
her check yesterday to Mrs. A. S. Hub
bard, the regent, as her contribution to
the Red Cross League.
Mrs. Alvord, besides being the first
woman in the State to come forward with
offers of financial aid, has conferred upon
Sequoia Chapter the distinction of having
been the first patriotic society to enlist in
this noble cau.se.
It will be remembered that Mrs. Al
vord w:is president of the Sanitary Com
mission in the late civil war, and her
valuable services have never been for
gotten. She is descended from a long
line of soldiers, distinguished in the
field, and is herself thoroughly imbued
with patriotic zeal.
S''iu r >iii Chapter will be heard from
again, as a special meeting will be called
at an early date, at which distinguished
speakers will be present, who will ad
dress the members on the all-absorbing
topic. "What Can Our Society Do for the
Wounded Soldiers?"
DOWN WITH SPAIN.
Rev. W. E. DuÂ£an Thinks
Spanish Barbarism
Should Cease.
The Rpv. W. E. Dugan, pastor of tho
Stewart .Memorial Presbyterian Church,
delivered a spirited address last even
ing upon the cause of the Spanish-Ameri
can war and cited the many arguments
why this country should forever sweep
the Spaniards and their inhuman govern
ment from the Cuban isle. He said:
The cause of the war between Spain and
the I'nited States has not been hasty action
on the part of the latter, but barbarism on
the part of the Spanish. It is the outcome of
cruel outrages, sickening enough to make the
heart of a cannibal tremble with shame, or
the heart of a "bloody Nero" throb with pity.
The. moon always keeps the same face
toward the earth, but as ?he has looked down
upon the barbariaxn of Spain she has felt
like turning her face away In disgust.
We have been forced Into this conflict by
Spain's refusal to comply with the requests of
civilization. While I do not take issue with
the United States, yet I think it would have
been better for us to have fought Spain upon
the Issue of the Maine rather than the free
dom of Cuba. In my mind the Maine was
deliberately blown up, and if we go to war. It
ought to be to teach Spain that she cannot
trifle with Americaâ that Old Glory stands
for liberty and union now and forever, one
and inseparable, and that those stars will burn
with glory when the name of Spain la a by
word of contempt and a hiss to teach her that
those white Lands of Old Glory are emblem
atic of the white bands of purity and Justice
that bind us to the throne of God, and that
the red of Old Glory is emblematic of the
power of the conquering Christ who is opposed
to all savagery. If fight we must let us unite
all energies into a stream that will sweep from
Cuba every vestige of Spanish authority and
set the Queen Regent on her own throne with
such a thud that she will awake to the idol
ization that clvrlization has been born Into
the world and grown Into a strong man, not to
be trifled with. Let us sweep the footprints of
the Queen and baby King from the sacied
Isle.
VOLUNTEER
COMPANIES
Firemen and Independents
Want to Fight for
the Country.
There is a great deal of patriotism of a
fighting character outside of the National
Guard, and several enthusiastic civilians
are already taking steps to organize com
panies for the army. One of the most en
thusiastic movements ai this character
is that started by F. H. Kenny, James
Brannan and Charles Daken of No. 4 en
gine house at 142 Second street.
Speaking of the matter yesterday Mr.
Kenny said: "We have decided to do all
in our power to get up an entire company
and jt now seems more than likely that
we shall be successful, because we have
really just started the movement and we
already have more than twenty on our
lists. The boys on the extra list are
pretty free to go, but there are a number
of regulars who are also ready to volun
teer to fight for their country. We shall
know the result of the movement in a few
days."
Attorney George W. Johnson of 927
Market street Is eager to organize a com
pany of independent volunteers. Steps to
that end were taken by him yesterday,
for which purpose he held a conference
with several committeemen in sympathy
with the movement. It is believed that
he will find no trouble in inducing a
goodly number of patriotic persons to co
operate with him in the movement.
JUSTIFIES THE WAR
Mrs. R. S. Lillie lectured last night to
the Society of Progressive Spiritualists,
her theme being", "Is War Necessary to
the TTlgher Spiritual Civilization?" which
question she answered in a qualified way.
The speaker held that war would not be
necessary in the future, but that it is
a necessary evil to-day. She described
early tribes in history as preying upon
their neighbors and waging wars of con
quest, and stated that nature is gradually
developing the highest characteristics and
will some day reach a point when wars
will be a matter of the past. She held
that the United. States is right on prin
ciple and that the only way to settle the
present difficulties is by force. She corn
pa^d nations that will not do right
toward the weak and the defenseless to
men who have bad tempers which they
will not control, and she left the infer
ence that Spain was like such a man.
MAY BE CALLED
TO WAR
Many University Students
Anxiously Waiting for
the National Guard
to Be Summoned.
BERKELEY, April 24.â The probable
calling out of the National Guard may
cause a number of senior students at the
university to forego graduation. A great
many of the students are members of the
various compfinies in different parts of
the State, and may be called on to leave
Berkeley immediately to join their com
panies. It is not improbable, however,
that in such a case the faculty of the
university will grant decrees to the can
didates without requiring them to remain
until th* close of the term.
In the probable event of Lieutenant
Clnman's transfer from command of the
Cadet Battalions to active service with
the army, the cadets will lie left at the
opening 1 of next term, in August, without
a commandant. A retired army officer or
some member of the faculty, possibly
Colonel Edwards or Colonel Soule, would
be detailed for the Work. A large number
of graduates, formerly commissioned offi
cers in the Cadet Battalion, have tendered
an offer of their services to Governor
Budd in case of war. Among them is
Professor A. P. Hayne of the viticultural
department staff, who graduated in ISB9
with military honors.
NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN
The Men Are Ready, but
Have Not Service
able Rifles.
During the past week there has been
more activity in the armories in this city
than has been known for some time, and
all on account of the war between this
country and Spain. Every member of
the guard h;us been expecting orders that
will call him to duty, and almost every
man is ready to go upon the order from
the command< r-in-chief. The desire to go
has been augmented by the assurance
of employers to National Guardsmen that
if called to serve in the defense of flag
and country their places will be secure
to them on their return. This movement
on behalf of the National Guardsmen, in
augurated by The Call a short time since,
has spread, and is still spreading among
employers. It is likely that by the time
California selects her auota every em
ployer will have said to his employe who
belongs to the guard: "Rest assured that
when you come back from the war your
position will await you," and that many
of these will add: "While you are gone
we will take care of those dependent upon
you." _j
ARMING THE GUARD.
Those at the head of the National Guard
of this State are now realizing the truth
of what was announced in this depart
ment more tha.n a year ago. That was
that the guard of this State was not
armed with the rifles which could have
been had at that time for the asking by
our representatives in Congress, provid
ing they had been firm and persistent in
their demands.
The adjutant-general, A. \Y. Barrett,
has made several attempts to obtain an
exchange Â°f rifles for the guard, but i
action m the matter did not receive the ,
Bupport it should have had. When the
regular army substituted the Krag-Jor- ]
gensen Titles for the Springfields, model ;
of ISB4, the Springfields were relegated to
the arsenals, and it was generally under
stood that these would be issued to the
National Guard of the several States in ]
exchange for the Springnelds of l t v7o, pro- i
viding a demand was made for them in j
proper form, that is, by an act of Con
gress, but the spirit of procrastination
prevailed and It was said there was time
enough, and the old rilles were good
enough for parade duty. The States of
Illinois and Nebraska, though somewhat
tardy, woke up about six months ago
and realized that there was coming a
time when their National Guardsmen
would need something more serviceable
than parade rifles, and they succeeded in
getting a bill through which permitted
them to make an exchange. The adju
tant-general of California estimates that
there are not less than 2300 rifles in the
guard that are not serviceable, and he re
cently forwarded an exchange order for
thai number of rifles to the Ordnance
Department at Washington, and in reply
received a letter from Acting Chief of
Ordnance Shaler announcing that the ex
change could not be made.
It is not very creditable to say that the i
4200 National Guardsmen are ready at a
moment's notice to take the field, "and at
the same time assert that 2300 of that
number are not provided with serviceable
rilles. There is, however, a hope that
this difficulty may be overcome. When
the guardsmen are called for duty they
will have to be mustered into the service
of the United States, and then it will be
come the duty of X'ncle Sam to provide
the men with suitable weapons.
THE EMERGENCY ROLLS.
The emergency rolls of the First Regi
ment of Infantry were opened last Mon
day at both armories and were kept open
on the drill night of each company. The
applications for enrollment were greater
than was expected for tho first week. A
large number of individuals visited the
armories each night, many of them be
ing men who never before had been con
nected with the guard; while their names
nnd residences were taken the preference
was given to ex-members of the guard.
Each company has received applications
from ex-members who are at present out
of the city. They express a willingness
to come here and enlist as soon as noti
fied either by letter, telegram or tele
phone. By means of the emergency roll
the companies will have no difficulty in
recruiting up to the full strength, which
is 103 rank and file.
Not only has this plan been adopted in
the local regiment, but the idea has been
carried out by the guard throughout the
State, and from reports received here it
is apparent that there will be more appli
cations than will fill the rolls.
WAR SERMONS.
Sermons were preached yesterday on
matters pertaining to the conflict be
tween the United States and Spain by
Rev. W. H. Tubbs at the Bethlehem Con
gregational Church, Rev. H. T. Shepard
at the Olivet Congregational. Rev. P.
Coombe at the Richmond Congregational
and Rev. F. R. Ferrand at the Howard
Presbyterian Church.
A Policeman Robbed.
Thomas Keneally was arrested last
night and charged with robbery. He is
said to be one of the men who last De
cember attacked Policeman Heffernan
and robbed him of his club and pistol.
