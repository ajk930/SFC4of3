BUENOS AYRES, April 30.â Advices from the Herald's cor
respondent m Rio Janeiro, Brazil, state that the United States
battle-ship Oregon has just arrived there, after an uneventful
trip.
The Argentine Government was about to order the Spanish
torpedo -gun vessel Temerano to leave Argentine waters, when
her commander announced to the authorities that he was only
remaining here for the purpose of taking on coal and provisions.
The Temerano, accordingly, is still anchored in the port of La
Plata, but she now has steam up.
The Herald's correspondent in Montevideo informs me that
the author/ties of Uruguay have prohibited a meeting that was
to have been held by Spaniards and Spanish sympathizers, as
they held that it might compromise the posit/on of neutrality
which the Uruguay Government had assumed.
RIO JANEIRO, April 30.â The Marietta has arrived. Neither \
the Marietta nor the Oregon knew of the existence of war. They
will sail probably on Tuesday. The Government declared coal
not contraband.

Emperor Nicholas replied di

be learned from officials of the de

there is no doubt that, in ac

Captain Clark commanding the bat

Having knowledge of the safety
of the warships in Brazilian waters,
the officials have ceased to pay any
particular attention to the torpedo

to be at La Plata, Argentina. It is

SPANISH TORPEDO
FLOTILLA STILL
HEADS DUE WEST
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
ST. VINCENT, Cape Verde Islands, April 30.â The Spanish
squadron, consisting of the first-class cruisers Vizcaya, Almirante
Oquendo, Infanta Maria Theresa and Cristobal Colon, and the three
to ped.-boat' destroyers Furor, Terror and Pluton, is steaming west
ward across the Atlantic, and will probably be heard from next at
Porto Rico
When the squadron left this port yesterday morn
ing the steamer Avery Hill, engaged by the Herald-
Call, followed, without giving the fleet any intimation
that it was being watched.
As I cabled yesterday, the Admiral received his sailing orders late
Thursday night, and early next morning the vessels put to sea â this
time for some strategic and active move.
The Herald-Call's special steamer waited until the Spanish
squadron was well out to sea before an attempt was made to follow.
Then the steamer started with full steam up to keep in the wake of
the Spaniards as long as possible.
The Avery Hili followed the track of the Spanish squadron during
the entire day. For twelve hours the steamer sped over the seas,
dropping gradually hour by hour behind the switt-going Spaniards,
whose vessels were proceeding at lull speed in a westerly direction.
The squadron did not change its course to any appreciable extent.
There was only one inference to be drawn â that was that the fleet was
at last on its way across the Atlantc.
The Herald-Cali steamer was still within a mariner's glass dis
tance of the Spaniards at sunset. As darkness came on the squadron
passed out of sight, with the prows of the vessels pointing west
wardly.
RUMOR THAT
DEWEY BEATS
THE SPANISH
It Is Said That He Has
Destroyed the Philippine
Defense Squadron.
The Governor of the Islands Says
That He Will Hold Out, and
Then the Cable Is
Cut.
NEW YORK, May I.â A Washington dis*
patch to the Herald, sent at 2 P. M., says:
A report is in circulation here early this
morning that the Spanish and American
fleets fought a battle off Manila yester
day, and that all the Spanish ships and
two of the American vessels had been
sunk*
No confirmation of it could be obtained, but, on
the other hand, it was asserted, on the highest authority,
that no information had been received from the Philip
pines.
Nevertheless, officials of the Navy Department be
lieve that the first naval battle of the war with Spain
was fought to-day at or near Manila, between the
squadron of Commodore Dewey and the Spanish fleet
in the Philippines, possibly supported by land batteries
at Manila.
It is believed that the first news of this conflict will
probably be received to-morrow, but as it will come through
Spanish sources, for the reason that the Spanish control the
cable from the Philippines, it is expected that the first re
port will be that the American squadron has been defeated.
No credence will be given by officials here to any re
port of operations off Manila that come through Spanish
sources, and assuming that the expected conflict occurred
to-day, it is not beloved that any reliable information con
cerning it will be received in Washington before Monday or
Tuesday at the earliest. It is believed that Commodore
Dewey will be compelled to send a vessel back to Hong
kong to send his dispatches, for even if he succeeds in cap
turing Manila within the next few days, it is believed that
the Spaniards will have cut the cable so as to prevent his
using it.
It is known that his orders contemplate the destruction
of the Spanish fleet as his first step. This accomplished, he
will be forced to take Manila in order to secure a coal depot
and base of supplies.

THE NEW YORK
FIRED UPON BY
SPANISH TROOPS
Alleged Bombardment of Cabanas
Batteries Was a Bit of
War's Grim Pleasantry.
Copyrighted, IS2S, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Cuba (via the Herald-Call
dispatch boat Somers M. Smith to Key
West),' April 30.â The flagship New
York, reconnoitering down the Cuban
coast yesterday evening, fell afoul of a
company. of Spanish soldiers, who saw
her and fired a futile volley at the big
cruiser as she swung lazily past the little
harbor of Cabanas.
There being no reply from the man
of-war, another gleeful volley was sent
in her direction. . Captain Chadwick,
busy with his glass and marginal notes
on a chart laid out before him, had no
knowledge of the performance on shore
until his attention was attracted to the
firing.
He looked in the direction indicated
and saw a thin cloud of blue smoke float
away from a dark clot on the landscape.
A moment of inspection through the
glass, another moment of deliberation
over the impertinence of the thins
and then, as the fourth vollry re-eciioed
faintly from shore and a few stray Iml-'
lets came kicking from spots on the blue
a nuict order was given, an eager gun
crew went swarming to their quarters,
and a moment later the bang, bang,
bang of a four-inch rapid-fire gun was
punctuating the stillness. The shells
flew fair and true, glanced along the
dry sward and brush, and burst where
the riflemen had stood. The sun was
dipping then, and at one stride came the
short southern twilight and then the
dusk of evening. The order to cease
firing was given, and when it came the
men of the flagship, peering through the
gloom, could not teM what the result
of their brief fusillade had been, but there

cussion in naval circles as to the ad
visability of sending one. of the men
of-war at Rio back to find and destroy
the ship. The probabilities are, how
ever, . that just as soon as they are
coaled they will continue on their
way to Key West in accordance with
the plan outlined by the Naval War
Board.
Considerable satisfaction, was ex
pressed, by naval experts whom. ,1
told of the arrival of the American
vessels at the execellent run they
made around the Horn. The Oregon
left Callao, Peru, on April 7, and
upon arrival at Punta Arenas joined
the gunboat Marietta, which had
gone to that point from Valparaiso,
where she had coaled. After taking
on board a supply of fuel at Punta
Arenas, which they reached on April
17, the ships started on their way to
Eio. The distance from Callao to Bio
is 5095 miles, so that the average
speed maintained was 10.8 knots per
hour-
In view of the fact, however, that
the Oregon and Marietta vere de
tained a couple of days at Pur.ta Are
nas, taking on coal, naval experts
, say it is evicent that a speed of more
than eleven knots was made.
In accordance with instructions
sent him by the State Department, it
is suppose . that Minister Bryan has
made all arrangements for coaling
the American men-of-war at Rio, and
that they will be ready to sail by
Monday at the latest. The cruiser
"Nictheroy may accompany the Ore
gon and Marietta to Key West,
though this is not all certain, in view
of the possibility that the department
hÂ»Â« other work cut out for the Oregon
were no more replies from the beach.
Having finished her investigation, the
flagship swung around and went steam
ing toward Havana again.
Speaking of that saffron city, I
passed it twice to-day. On the second
run the Smith was not more than eight
miles distant, and an excellent pair of
glasses showed that new efforts in the
way of defensive works are being made
to the eastward of Morro. The land
scape is scarred by a long, reddish mark
of the newly upturned earth, and a bit
further to the eastward of that and
somewhat nearer shore marks of the
pickax and shovel are again seen.
As we drew abeam of Morro we
swerved a bit nearer, but no sign of life
could be seen anywhere in the city.
Yellow, it lay in the burning sunshine,
with a thin haze hanging over and be
yond the town. We drew near enough
to distinguish the great arched gateway
which marks the entrance to the ceme
tery, but the city of the dead was not
more lifeless than was Cuba's warworn
capital.
Steaming abeam of the Smith came
the little gunboat Wilmington. The
flagship was miles ahead and out of sig
naling distance. We on the Smith
wondered what the Wilmington might
be up to, for her course carried her
within easy range of the shore batteries.
We peered through our glasses and
waited for white dots of smoke from
port and for the skipping and burst
ing of shells, but none came.
Apparently these artillery men of Ha
vana have heard of that Matanzas inci
dent, and their dogs of war are not so
very eager to bay at these ships of ours.
to perform before that vessel arrives
at Key West. Coming to the States
from Rio Captain Clark will keep in
cable communication with the de
partment, so that a junction between
him and the other naval vessels can
be effected without delay in case in
formation should be received that the
Spanish fleet is coming to Porto Rico,
and it should be deemed desirable to
assemble all the armored men-of-war
in order to crush the upanish force.
It is supposed by the department
officials that just as soon as the Ore
gon, and Marietta dropp3d anchor in
Rio harbor the fact of their presence
was at once cabled to Madrid by the
Spanish Minister to Brazil. In view
of the departure of the Spanish fleet
yesterday from St. Vincent, it is not
believed that an attempt will be made
to meet the Oregon and Marietta,
though this cannot be stated definite
ly. Before reaching home waters the
American ships still have 4500 miles
to cover, so that they cannot possibly
arrive at Key West under seventeen
days. It will, of course, be possible
for the two ships to be intercepted by
Spanish armored cruisers and torpe
do-boat destroyers. But Secretary
Long and other officials of the de
partment are confident that if the
Oregon and Marietta do fall in with
the enemy, the latter will suffer just
as much as this Government.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, April 30.â City Clerk
Wright says last summer he was intro
duced to a Spaniard on the beach
whose actions aroused his suspicions,
leading him to believe he was a spy,
and he so informed Lieutenant Gov
ernor Jeter. Before any action could
be taken the man had left. He was
here for several days previously, pre
tending to go out fishing, but it was
noticed he made notes of the entrances
to the bay and surroundings, and his
conversation betrayed a knowledge of
the fortifications erf this coast. He is
supposed to have visited the powder
works. He was constantly seeking in
formation, his extreme politeness hid
ing any evidence that would lead
toward suspicion as to his motives.
Three Italian laborers, who left San
Francisco on April 17 in search of em
ployment, are missing, and if is
thought by their friends that they are
the persons who swelled the death list
at the explosion of the Santa Cruz
powder works. The three men were in
San Jose on Sunday last, and there
they met a friend to whom they said
they were to start the next morning
for the powder works, expecting that
they would be able to get a job there.
They were to walk the distance be
tween San Jose and the powder mill
and they expected to cover the gTound
by noon on Tuesday. Each of them
had his blankets with him, and it is
thought the unidentified roll of blank
ets found near the scene of the explo-.
pion was the property of- one of them.
Two of the men were tall and the other
was under medium size and would pass
as a boy. The two tall men wore
brown corduroy trousers. One of them
had on a red sweater an<? the other
wore a black sweater. The short man
wore a dark suit and a brown sweater.
All three had dark soft felt hats.
Their friends believe they would
have reached the powder works at
about the time of the explosion, and
they are of the opinion that these three
missing men were blown up instead of
the supposed Spanish spies.
FAILS TO AGREE
ON THE NAVAL BILL
House Refuses to Accept the Amend-
ments and Sends the Measure
Back to Conference.
WASHINGTON, April 30.â T0-day's
session of the House was devoted chief
ly to consideration of the conference
report upon the naval appropriation
bill, presented yesterday by Chairman
Boutelle. The report was rejected after
three hours of debate, and further con
ference will follow.
The only ground upon which the fight
against the leport was made waa found
in the Senate amendment to compen
sate naval officers for Government use
of their inventions and authorizing
them to have their claims, for such
compensation adjudicated in th? d.uvt
of Claim 3. Boutelle led the support,
of the amendment and Cannon and
Sayers the opposition. A resolution,
introduced by Cannon, insisting upon
eliminating the amendment, was adopt
ed. 118 to 42, and the naval bill was
t gain sent to conference.

Journals That Justify the Inter

But the Monarchist Soleil Says It Is a

Copyrighted, 183S, by James Gordon Bennett.
"PARIS, April 30.â 1t Is as well that
Arn^ricans should have a more accu
rate knowledge of the feelings enter-"
tamed among Latin nations, more es
pecially France, as to the war between
the United States and Spain than can
be gleaned from the few personal opin
ions published in the papers. These
feelings I have endeavored to evolve
by a diligent study of the most influ
ential organs reflecting all shades of
opinion in the great centers of France.
One of the first distinctions neces
sary is entirely political in character.
Advanced journals, radical and oth
erwise, including nearly all who sup
ported Dreyfus and defended Zola in
the recent great trial, like Clemen
ceau's organ, L'Auroee; Goblet's rad
ical socialist organ. La Petite Repub
lique; the woman's rights journal. La
Frende, in which Mme. Severine daily
peroratesâ these, with all red Repub
lican organs, consider it due to their
principles to protest against what they
style Spanish tyranny in Cuba, and,
without discussing the motives or con
sequences of American intervention,
see in it only help given to the op
pressed against the oppressors.
To this list should be added Roche
fort's journal, which, by a strange
contradiction on this occasion, joins in
the chorus vith those he most furious
ly opposed during the Zola trial. But
it would be a great mistake to regard
as serious Rochefort's statement in
the cablegram to Senator Morgan that
all Republicans are one at heart with
the Cubans and their liberators.
The great conservative Republican
organ, Debats, thus concludes a long
article on the attitude of the European
powers: "In the action of the United
States there is no justification in pre
cedents of the rights of nations. It is
not even to be found in the famous
Monroe doctrine, which, already con
testable, becomes with this fresh ex
tension a direct menace to every power
possessing a square inch of terr.'*ory
in the new world. The principle itself
and its brutal application cannot fail
to arouse on this side of the ocean a
strong protest from public opinion in
the name alike of the international
rights and manifest interest of the na
tions of Europe.
M. Judet, in the Petit Journal, de
votes a loite article to the conditions
of the conmct, and comments severely
on thp motives that provoked it. He
says: "Tjh.t has happened to Spain
proves it^Ps be^t to have the right on
one's side, but you must not count on
the impartiality' qr honesty of the other
nations unless you "mean to be taken by
surprise or by disloyal aggression."
The Petit Paresian, one of the widest
circulated popular organs, takes a
broader view of the question. It says:
"What constitutes a new and impor
tant fact is the intervention of the
United States in the dispute between a
colony and its mother country by vir
tue of a right which is very hard to dis
cover on this ground. Â»= the question
widens far beyond the actual one of the
war with Spa-m. It is the right of Eu
rope to hold territory in America that
is called, in question."
The monarchist journal, the Soleil.
develops an idea wider extending it to
conflicts of race. It says the war now
beginning is more than a violent con
flict between two nations: it is a
struggle of the Latin race against An
glo-Saxon invasion, Catholicism against
Protestantism, monarchy against re
publican democracy.
All other conservative organs sound
the same note. The Gaulois has ap
plied to the syndicate of the French
pre-ss to organize in some representa
tive form a demonstration of sympa
thy for Spain. â  â¢

SALINAS, April 30.â When the mus
ter roll of Troop C was opened for
signatures this evening the armory
was crowded with young men anxious
to sign. Within a half hour the full
complement of 103 had been secured.
The signers *are all young men, most
of them sons of the best families here.
They average 25 years in age, five feet

pounds in weight. One, an lowan, is
six feet four inches, and is powerfully
built. The men will be ready for mus

ACCIDENT AT LIME
POINT FORTIFICATIONS
Laborer Sustains Severe Injuries
While Employed in Dumping
Concrete.
SAUSALITO. April 30.â Another seri
ous accident occurred yesterday morn
ing where the Government fortifica
tions are being constructed at Lime
Point, by which a laborer named B.
Cupfer sustained a dislocated shoulder
and may have been injured internally.
Cupfer was employed in dumping
concrete from a sort of mining car into
the excavations. This car is so made
that the body turns at right angles on
the truck and a door at the end opens
as it tips, hut if the door does not open
at once the car is likely to tip over. In
this case the door did not open easily,
and in trying to keep the car from tip
ping Cupfer was carried over and
hurled down into a nine-foot excava
tion, receiving a dislocated shoulder,
several contusions of the body and
head and perhaps internal injuries.
The injured, man was sent to his home
in San Francisco on the Government
boat Yosemite.
About 175 men are now working in
three shifts, from 3 a. m. to 8. p. m.
Sixteen carpenters under charge of
Foreman Milo Hoadley were obliged to

TELEPHONES
IN WARFARE
For the First Time They
Will Be Used in
Actual Service.
Owing to General Greely's De
vice Communication Is
Made Easy in Battle.
New Rules Issued by the War De
partment to Cover Selection
of Summary Courts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 30.
For the first time in the experience
of any army in actual service the com
manding officers of the United States
troops will have complete outfits for
maintaining telephonic communication
with the various brigades, regiments,
etc., that go to make up divisions or
corps of any army.
For this the officials are indebted to
General Greely, the' chief signal officer.
By this means of communication thus
afforded commanders will be able to
immediately send instructions to sub
ordinates in the field and to receive re
ports of movements. General Greely
also has equipped and has ready for
service his field telegraphic outfit.
Several years ago Congress enacted a
law providing for the creation of sum
mary courts, the presiding officer of
whfch was to be the second officer in
command at a post. These courts were
to dispose of various small infractions
of military rules by the soldiers. They
were limited to "time of peace." Ac
cording to an order issued by General
Miles to-day, this being "time of war,"
the provisions of the summary court
act are dispensed with and they are re
placed by the field officers' court.
This is in accordance with the
eightieth article of war, which provides
as follows:
"In. time of war a field officer may
be detailed in every regiment to try
soldiers thereof for effenses not capi
tal, and no soldier serving with his
regiment shall be tried by a regimental
garrison court-martial when a field
officer of his regiment may be so de
tailed."
DR. BRUNNER GIVES
VALUABLE INFORMATION.
Tells of the Sanitary Conditions in
Cuba, and Thinks an Invading
Army Should Not Be
Sent.
SAVANNAH, Ga., April 30.â Dr. G.
W. Brunner, formerly United States
sanitary inspector at Havana, has just
returned from Washington, where he
went to place valuable information in
the hands of the surgeon general and
of General Miles and the War Depart
ment.
Dr. Brunner, while in Havana, for
the sum of $5 30 a month, had the orig
inal reports from all ths. Spanish mili
tary posts' hospitals. These reports
are now in the possession of Surgeon
General^ Wyman. They show. Dr.
Brunner states, that there were in the
Spanish hospitals daily, out of an
army of 110,000 men, from 30,000 to 32,
000. The unsanitary conditions sur
rounding the men and the insufficient
attention given them, together with a
lack of food, are responsible for these
facts.
Dr. Brunner also secured in the same
way information about all of the conat
fortifications around Havana and per
sonally saw planted eight of the sub
marine mines now in the htu-bor there.
The plans have been placed in the
possession of the War Department.
Dr. Brunner does not think an army
of invasion should be sent to Cuba, on
account of the likelihood of great mor
tality from yellow fever. He says that
with the volunteers and regulars the
Spaniards will soon assemble an army
of about 80.000 men in Havana.
DECLABES FOR FUSION.
OGDEN, May I.â At midnight the
Washakie Club, the strongest political
organization 'in Utah, and of which
"William J. Bryan is an honorary mem
bor, made the first break in the Demo
cratic ranks of the State in favor of
fusion. It held a six-hour discussion in
which all the bitterness of religious
warfare has pone through.
The resolution indorsing National
Democratic Committee Chairman
Jones' propo-sition of co-operation of
all the silver forces was passed. The
Silver Republicans and Populists had
already agreed to fuse, and the State
Democratic committee is now consid
ering the question.
! nrys. Only those who endured the
hard ips of the soldiers in the late
war can realize the sad condition of
many of the comrades ajfter the con-
flict. Many did not break down im-
mediately, but sooner or later, the ter-
rible exposure endured in malarial dis-
tricts, together with the privations and
sufferings experienced in the service,
have broken down those previously
rugged. To all such I urge that Hood's
Sarsaparilla be given a fair trial. It
seems especially adapted to counteract
and overcome poison and disease con-
tracted in the South, and comes as
near as possible to making the veteran
feel young again.
"My official duties keeping me quite
closely confined, it is particularly es-
sential v.ith the approach of spring
that I take a medicine to brace me up.
Hood's Sarsaparilla has done this ef-
fectively for many years, not only at
spring time, but whenever I felt run
down. It purifies my blood, tones up
my system and gives me a good appe-
tite. In fact, it sends through me a
thrill of new life^
"I am glad voluntarily and publicly
to indorse Hood's Sarsaparilla and to
recommend it to all who know me or
who may read these words." â Joseph

Copyrighted, 1858, by James Gordon Bennett.
GIBRALTAR, April 30.â During the
last few days I have had many oppor
tunities of obtaining the views of sev
eral naval officers upon the present
crisis, and in these days naval officers
of high position are often placed in
situations where immediate decisions i
of vital importance have to be taken, j
bo that finally they become better
judges than trained diplomats. Their
opinions may be summarized as fol
lows:
Whatever may be their ideas on the |
technical procedure of the United
States, on general principles they side
â with America as a sister nation. The
opinion of one of the most able is that
the war could have been averted and j
the same results obtained had America j
given more time, and that this matter
is going to be more troublesome than
the United States imagined, the Span
lards having the fixed intention of
drawing it out. knowing that every
day is enormously damaging to the
United States.
But more often than any other have
I heard the opinion that this is only ;
the beginning of great international j
complications which England has fore- j
seen for some time past, and for which
her navy is so thoroughly prepared.
Then England's lot must necessarily
be with the United States, and when j
the time comes she will be found tuned i

preparatory to leaving to-morrow or
Monday. The feeling that there would
come an order for all to move was ac
centuated to-night when It was stated
that the Third and Sixth Cavalry had
also received orders to be ready to
move at a moment's notice.
The Sixteenth Infantry, from Fort
Sherman, Idaho, and Rainbow, Wash.,
reached Chickamauga to-day and went
into camp on the Kelley field. Orders
were received to-day from the War De
partment transferring this regiment
and all other troops at the park be
longing to other departments to the
Department of the Lakes.
Captain E. E. Hardin, Seventh In
fantry, was granted an indefinite leave
of absence to-day to accent the col
onelcy of a regiment of New York vol
unteers. First Lieutenant Albert S.
Front was granted leave to accept the
colonelcy of a South Dakota regiment
of volunteers. First Lieutenant C. C.
Ballou, Twelfth Infantry, was ordered
to Springfield, 111., for duty at the vol
unteer camp.
Captain Jack Pitcher, Troop A, First
Cavalry, was thrown from a new
horse which he was breaking to service
this afternoon, and his leg was fright
fully mashed and sprained. The sur

service, are much talked of as an indi
cation.
While the report, published this even
ing, is probably without foundation, that
the German fleet is going to Manilla with
orders to prevent a blockade, it has
aroused naval sentiment still more,
and there is not a naval officer here
who would not like a good lick at them.

sharp patrol work as heretofore. This
is probably on account of the expected

the part of the Spanish authorities to
the necessity of having forts and guns
of a character suited to modern war
fare. The near approaches to Manila
itself, by both land and sea, are now
defended by forts and batteries with
guns of new pattern, and Cavite, on

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1898.
HERALD-CALL BOAT
DEWEY FIRED UPON.
Copyrighted, 189S, by James Gordon Ben

KEY WEST, Fla., April 30.â
The Herald-Call dispatch boat
Dewey, storm-beaten, decks
awash and funnel white with
crusted salt, was fired on five
miles northwest of Sand Key
light while bound into Key West
this morning. At 2 a gun
flashed four times astern, but
shells were neither seen nor
heard aboard the dispatch boat.
We could not make out the boat
using the gun, but it was show
ing one white light at first and
subsequently burned a blue and
then a red flare. None of these
is the fleet signal, and the Dewey
drove on her course. She gained
rapidly after the first gun, and
it was decided not to heave to,
as the identity of the pursuer
was in question. After the flash
of the gun a second time I dis
played the signals named by the
admiral for use of dispatch
boats In case they are challenged
by a patrol of the squadron. This
signal had no effect, but the
Dewey was too far ahead to fear
shell, and came into port. The
lights shown by the stranger
makes the matter somewhat
mysterious at this writing.

ing the Proclamation
of Neutrality.
In This Peculiar Line of Action
the Wishes of Spain Are
Ignored.
More Than This, Prominent German
Officers Offer Their Services to
the United Stales.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ISERLIN, April 30.'â The United
ites embassy does not regard the fact
Germany's not issuing a declaration
neutrality as indicative of unfriend
ess, but rather the reverse; while it
terates that the Minister for For
n Affairs, Baron yon Buelow, has
en repeated assurances, some of
ich have been quite recent, that Ger
ny will observe the strictest neutral
, not only now, but throughout the
r, coupling with these assurances
iressions of the most friendly feel
ings of the present German Govern
ment for the Government and people
of the United States.
In conversation upon the subject the
United States Embassador, Andrew D.
White, said: "There is absolutely no
reason to expect anything but fair and
impartial neutrality from Germany,
which is all the United States wanted
or expected."
As a matter of fact, Germany's deci
sion not to formally declare neutrality
means nothing more or less than that,
while it leaves the Government's hands
free, it is expected to enable German
merchants to reap a harvest by selling
freely to both combatants. At the
same time it may be gathered from the
fact that Spain strenuously sought to
induce Germany to proclaim neutrality
that she regards neutrality as condu
cive to her interests.
During the visit of the United States
Embassador to Dresden several inter
esting incidents occurred. When en
route for the audience with King Al
bert to present President McKinley's
congratulations upon the twenty-fifth
anniversary of his accession to the
throne Mr. White met the Spanish Em
bassador to Germany, Senor Mendez
Devigo, upon the stairs of the palace.
There was a moment of embarrass
ment, then "both stretched out their
hands and exchanged greetings.
Mr. White, in presenting President
McKinley's letter, made a neat speech
assuring his Majesty that he was held
in high esteem and affection in Amer
ica, at which the King was much
gratified. Mr. W r hite was also pre
sented to Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria, who warmly welcomed him.
It is generally remarked that the
Austrian Emperor has aged greatly
lately. His hair and beai'd, which a
year ago were only streaked with gray,
are now snow white, and the expres
sic-n of his face has become most sad.
Mr. White, while at Dresden, had
frequent conversations with the Papal
Nuncio, Mgr. Lorinzelli, who told him
that the Vatican had been ill-advised
at its recent attempt at mediation, i
Continuing. Mgr. Lorinzelll said:
"What the Pope ought to have done
was to Induce Spain to give the Pope
Cuba, he giving it to the Cubans."
Despite denials, it is a fact that
many well-known German officers,
whose aristocratic names, if published,
would create a sensation in Germany,
applied at the United States embassy
for permission to join the American
forces. A large percentage of the
American students are en route home
to offer their services to the Govern-
The German-American Club of Ber
lin, at a special meeting this week,
adepted resolutions expressing sym
pathy and encouragement "in the
righteous war against tyrannical
Spain."
The Prussian Diet on Wednesday ex
haustively debated the questions of
American meat imports. Members
characterized American meat inspec
tion as a hoax. They said the meats
were affected with trichinosis and pre
served in acids which were ruinous to
health, and pleaded in favor of their
total exclusion.
The Minister of Agriculture. Baron
yon Hammerstein-Leexten, then an
nounced that an imperial decree to
that effect, which would be valid
throughout Germany. was to be
passed. It is understood that a bill to
this effect will be presented to the
Keiehstag and passed before adjourn
ment.

DIVIDES
THE FLEET
OF SAMPSON
War Department Details
Commodores to Aid
the Rear Admiral.
Watson and Remey Will Each
Command a Division of the
North Atlantic Squadron
in Cuban Waters.
NEW YORK, April 30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Signifi
cant action was taken by the Navy
Department to-day to improve the ef
ficiency of the North Atlantic squad
ron in case of operations against the
Spanish. It has been determined to di
vide the fleet into two divisions, one of
which will be commanded by Commo
dore J. C. Watson and the other by
Commodore G. C. Remey. Rear Admi
ral Sampson will continue in command
of the entire fleet.
In taking this action the department
has been guided by the evident neces
sity of placing sufficient flag officers in
charge of vessels to direct their move
ments against the enemy. Orders to
Commodore Watson, issued to-day, di
rect him to report immediately to Rear
Admiral Sampson for such duty as that
officer may direct. Instructions given
by the department to Rear Admiral
Sampson direct him to place Commo
dore Watson in charge of a division,
composed of half of his force, most of
which are on blockading duty on the
southwestern coast of Cuba. The de
partment declines to name the vessel
which will be Commodore Watson's
flagship, but it will be either the cruis
er Cincinnati, commanded by Captain
C. M. Chester, or the < ;patch boat Dol

Commodore Remey has been tem
porarily assigned to duty in charge of
the naval base at Key West. It is ap
preciated by the department that this
is a most important post. It was po
considered during the Civil War, when
an officer of flag rank was kept on duty
there during practically the entire re
bellion. Commodore Remey will not,
however, continue at Key West for
any length of time, but will be assigned
to command the first division, which
will be temporarily retained by Rear
Admiral Sampson, while Commodore
Watson will get the secon-1 division.
The assignment of these two officers
will relieve Rear Admiral Sampson of
SELECTION OF
THE GENERALS
First the President Will
Name the Seniors
for Service.
Politics and Influence of the
National Guard Creep
Into the Contest.
At First It Was Intended to Name
Only Regular Army Men for
Most of the Hijh Hlacies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 30.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: The senior major
generals of the volunteer establishment
will be the first officers selected by the
President and their nominations will
probably go to the Senate Tuesday. I
was assured to-night that with these
nominations would be sent the appoint
ments of several officers to be commis
sioned as brigadier generals.
Probably five major generals and ten
or twelve brigadiers will constitute this
first list. The President's later appoint
ments will be governed by the capacity
shown by the senior colonels of the
army in the coming expedition into
Cuba and by the development of officers
from civil life and militia now colonels
and lieutenant colonels of the State
quotae.
The history of changes made in the
list of general officers, as prepared by
the President early this week, is an in
teresting one. He had at first deter
mined to select two prominent North
ern and one Southern general in the
late war to command the three army
corps into which the volunteer army
was at first divided by the War De
partment. It was at the time under
stood that the first appointments of
brigadier generals were to be entirely
selected from officers of the regular
army. But National Guard influence
has been brought to bear, with the re
sult that less than one-half of the
brigadiers first selected will be taken
from the list of available regulars re
commended by the War Department.
Two of the three men first selected
for corps commanders with the rank
of major general were General Dodge
and General J. H. Wilson of Delaware
both veterans of the Northern armies,
and the third was held for one of the
prominent Southerners. General Fitz
hugh Lee was popularly supposed to
have been selected for the honor. La
ter politics began to figure, and mem
bers of Southern delecations crowded
the White House with recommenda
tions of the candidacy of General Jo
seph Wheeler of Alabama. It is
claimed that if the war is to be suc
cessful the higher generals will have to
represent the interests of sections from
which they are appointed.
Yesterday, as exclusively stated in
the Herald. General Dodge refused to
accept a senior command. This leaves
but one more name on the list of ma-
jor penerals â General Wilson â who will
undoubtedly receive one of the highest
commands. Brlsradier General Shatter
has become pror. inent for one of the
corps commands, since it hag been
known that he will be the officer to J
a great deal of labor and make them
directly responsible to him for any ac
tion they may take.
Further than this, the assignments
are important in view of the strateg
ical results expected to ensue. For
instance, when there is a junction of
the flying squadron with the North At
lantic squadron, Commodore Watson
will be left in command of the blockad
ing force off Cuban ports, while Rear
Admiral Sampson and Commodore
Remey, in whose division will be the
armored vessels, will sail with Com
modore Schley's command, which will
comprise the second division of the
united force to attack the Spanish
men-of-war.
It was pointed out to me to-day that
Rear Admiral Sampson's force had
now grown to such proportions that it
was absolutely impossible for one man
to handle it without overworking him
self, and Rear Admiral Sampson is too
good an officer for the department to
permit to be run down at this critical
juncture. There are fifty-four vessels
under his command, including two
battle-ships, one armored cruiser, four
monitors, four cruisers, one dispatch
boat, ten gunboats, seven torpedo
boats, and the remainder is composed
of revenue cutters and converted
yachts and tugs.
The division of the North Atlantic
squadron and assignment of flag offi
cers to command each division was in
accordance with the recommendations
c-f the naval war board. As to the
junction of Commodore Schley's com
mand with the vessels of those of Rear
Admiral Sampson, it developed to-day
that the sailing orders given to Com
modore Schley yesterday were prepar
atory in character, and that his ships
would not sail for a few days, possibly
not until the armored ships of the
North Atlantic squadron have succeed
ed in reducing a Cuban point, to be ta
ken as an American base of operations.
Much depends, of course, upon the
movements of the Spanish men-of-war,
as will be reported to the department
by the scouts which are now scouring
the seas on the lookout for their ap
pearance.
lead the first regulars to Cuba. He
has been strongly recommended, and
his friends indulge the hope that he
will receive the volunteer appointment.
Brigadier generals who are certain to
be chosen from the National Guards
are General Roe of New York, General
Garretson of Ohio, General Otis of Cal
ifornia and either General Snowden or
General Gobin. from Pennsylvania.
The probable appointments are those
of Colonel Adams of Lafayette Post,
Npw York, and Colonel Francis Greene
of the Seventy-first New York.
Regular officers who will receive high
commands besides General Shafter are
Lieutenant Colonel Ludlow of the corps

STRIKE IN SAN QUENTIN.
RAN QI'ENTIN, April 30.â The twelve
Chinamen in the laundry went out on
strike to-day. They were Immediately
brought up to Captain Edgar, who. after
invcstiÃfitins their case, ordered them all
into the dungeon, where they will remain
for at least thirty days. To make the
punishment a little more severe they will
be shackled to their cells.
The reason for their going on a strike
w:is that the officer of the laundry had

ATTEMPT TO
DESTROY TWO
WAR VESSELS
Bomb Exploded Beneath
y a Wharf at Portland
Iron Works.
Torpedo - Boats Barely Escape
Destruction at the Hands
of a Skulking
Spaniard.
PORTLAND, Or., April 30.â An at
tempt to set fire to the shop or to
frighten the workmen on torpedo-boats
12 and 13 was made under the wharf
of the Wolff & Sewicker Iron Works at
11 o'clock last night. While nothing
could be learned of the perpetrator, a
Spaniard or Mexican who was seen
hanging about the place all day and
who had been several times ordered
away is suspected by the police. An
Investigation to-day disclosed the frag
ments of a heavy bomb scattered di
rectly below the wharf.
The late workmen, who were just
quitting the building, were startled, as
the whistle blew, by a dull report, ap
parently just below the wharf on which
the torpedo-boats are building. It
shook the structure to its foundations.
R. <\ Redman, in charge of the Madi
son street bridge at night, also heard
the detonation and saw a blinding flash
directly under the torpedo-boats. Niprht
patrolmen! as far distant as Eighth
and Sherman streets, a mile away,
heard the explosion.
Ed Davy, material clerk of the iron
works, with Henry Poehler and Con
rad Boe Buebeke, night watchmen,
seized lanterns and hurried beneath the
wharf. Just as they reached the ground
a second report like that of a shotgun
or revolver was heard and they saw a

Precautions Taken to Pre
vent Cablegrams of
Spaniards.
No Cipher Messages Are Per
mitted to the West
Indies.
General Greely Completes All the
Arrangements to Cause the
Restrictions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 30.
Many complaints have been received
here to the effect that the Government
hkfl not taken full precautions to pre
vent the transmission of important
military' dispatches between the Span
ish Government and its colonies in the
% est Indies.
"The truth ' out the matter." said
Major Greely, chief signai officer, who
has charge of the supervision exercised
by the United States Government over
cable messages going out or ''oming in
to Key West, "is that the President has
acted promptly in the matter, but at
present there is no cable running out
of the United States that is not under
proper restrictions as tc the character
of the messages sent."
General Greely has amicably adjust
ed these delicate matters with the
Western Union Telegraph Company
and with the Postal Telegraph Com
pany. "Both of these companies." he
Baid. "have patriotically accepted the
restrictions placed upon them
by the Government, and no
cipher messages are handled between
this country and the West Indies over
American cables, except such as are
exchanged between the officers of the
United States and neutral Ambassadors
and Ministers and the designated Con
sular officers of the country they repre
sent in the West Indies."
General Greely has just returned
from New York, where he completed
arrangements relating to certain con
ditions of the restriction above referred
to. He says it is now doubly hard for
the Spaniards to communicate with
their representatives in the West In
die?. Their communications now will
have to be made either in a round
about way via South America or from
the British cable running from Halifax
to Bermuda.
College Records Broken.
PHILADELPHIA, April 30.â 1n the
annual race carnival of the University
of Pennsylvania at Franklin Field to
day W. P. Remington of New York
broke the intercollegiate record for the

was 22 feet 11% inches. J. C. Mc-
Craeken broke the intercollegiate
record for the hammer-throw, sending

RIVERSIDE, April 30.â The first rain

all.
Groping about by the dim light of
their lanterns they were unable to find
anything which could have caused an
explosion and they finally decided to
abandon the quest till daybreak.
The Spaniard whom the police sus
pect of having caused the explosion,
either with the deliberate purpose of
blowing up the torpedo-boats or settingr
fire to the building, or thinking to ter
rify the contractor, had been slinking
about the place all day. He visited the
saloon on the corner, where he ques
tioned the workmen during the noon
hotir, being very careful to inquire of
Nightwatchman Poehler how many
men were on watch and at work at
night.
His actions finally became so sus
picious that the police were notified,
and a patrolman was sent over to in
vestigate. He returned with the re
port that the man was all right, and
nothing further was thought of the
matter until the explosion occurred.
When news of the attempt reached
the police station the captain dis
patched several men to look Into it, but
in the darkness they were unable to
learn anything further than the watch
man told them.

an unfriendly attitude toward the

NIPPING THE PLOTS
OF THE SPANIARDS.
Vice-Consul Bruga of Tampa Is Up
to Mischief and Will Soon
Be Arrested.
JACKSONVILLE. Fla., April 30.â A
special to the Times-Union and Citizen
i from Tampa, Fla., says: Chief of Po-
J lice Burke of -the Tampa force and Gen
eral Wade held a lengthy consultation
a few evenings ago, the subject of
which has just come to light.
Spanish Consul Soils left about three
days ago and Vice-Consul Bruga left
about two days later. The vice-consul
; said that, he was going to Jamaica by
: way of New York and on the evening
' prior to departure he was given a fare
j well party by his Spanish friends.
A few evenings ago a Spanish woman
I told two of her American girl friends
; that something would happen soon.
Her significant remark in connection
with the many rumors of Spanish plots
iin circulation aroused suspicion. On
Thursday night, as Chief Burke was
returning from Ybor City, he was sur
prised to see Bruga, who he supposed
was on his way to Jamaica, at the
Spanish woman's house.
Major Connelly of the Florida State
, troops has also been informed by a
i Cuban resident that Bruga is in town.
It is also reported that the Spaniard
has been seen at night disguised. A
Spanish boarding-house and another
house owned by Solis. where Bruga is
supposed to visit, are being watched
by the police^to-night, and if Bruga is
seen he will be arrested.
Another plot is in course of develop
; ment that will be nipped. It is to the
i effect that there is a soldier here with
| the regulars who speaks Spanish whose
term will soon expire. It is asserted
| that he had been approached and urged
I to re-enlist with the intimation that he
' might make $250 a month.

THAT LAST
SHOT FROM
THE PURITAN
Gunner's Mate Jackson
the Hero of the Block
ading Squadron.
Released the Missile That Dealt
Death at Matanzas After
"Stop Firing" Had Been
Signaled,
Copyrighted. IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, April 30.â The most
popular of the ships In the harbor at
present Is the monitor Puritan, now
here taking coal. The Herald told on
Thursday, in its exclusive account of
the shelling of the Matanzas shore bat
teries, of the wonderful shot with which
the Puritan finished the action, demol
ishing the battery and hurling earth
works, gun carriages and concrete sixty
feet in the air in one terrible volcano
of iron, earth and stone.
"Black Jack" Harrington, the Purl
tan's caj)tain. has been here to-day and
that last shot is the talk of the week.
I learned to-day from an officer of the
Puritan that the man who sighted that
death-dealing gun at a distance of
nearly two miles and a half from the
shore batteries was Gunner's Mate
Jackson, one of the most popular lads
on the monitor. Jackson had just
sighted his piece, and, as he afterwards
explained, he had the range ao perfectly
that he felt sure of a center shot. At
that critical moment the flagship sig
nalled to stop firing. Jackson could not
bear to lose that beautiful chance so ]
he let go a moment after the action was
officially declared off.
If he had made a bad shot Gunner's
Mate Jackson migl t have been repri
manded, but when thÂ» men of the en
tire squadron witnessed the terrible
execution done by Jackson's last shot
500 caps of "Jackies" came off in a jiffy.
Cheers rang lustily from the decks of
the Cincinnati, the flagship and the
monitor, impromptu hornpipes were ex- ,
ecuted on the gundeck of the Puritan,
and the marksman was Beized and
hugged again and again like a lost
brother.
"I knew I had her that time," was
Jackson's smiling comment, "and the

Banquet,

LONDON, April 30.â At the Royal
Academy banquet to-night there pres
ent the Prince of Wales, the Duke of
Cambridge, Duke of York, Prince
Christian. Prince Edward of Saxe Wei
mar, Prince Christian Victor, Joseph
Chamberlain, Colonel John Hay, the
diplomatic corps, with the exception of
the Spanish Embassador, . and many
other leading men. The Duke of Dev
onshire, in the course of an address,
s*d:
"At present we are spectators of the
war between one of the proudest and
most powerful nations of Europe, and
the youngest and most powerful com
munity of America, in the foundation
of which Great Britain has taken so
large a share, and in whose fortunes
she has taken so much interest."
The Duke of Devonshire said he be
lieved that both belligerents admitted
that Great Britain had no right or in
terests which prescribed any other
course than one of strictest neutrality,
and while he admitted that "not even
the dictates of humanity warrant ac
tion on our part that could
be construed as uncalled for in
terference in a quarrel which is not
ours," he felt sure that the country
would join in the wish that If oppor
tunity ever offered itself the good of
fices of Great Britain, if asked for,
should serve to bring to a speedy and
honorable conclusion a war which,
however inevitable it might have been,
was attended by conditions more than
usually pathetic. The address was re
ceived with applause.

whole navy couldn't stop it after I had
it sighted."
Key West has her daily prize again
to-day. The patriots of this coral reef
have become so accustomed to lining
the wharves and rushing to" the house
tops in answer to the hail "Another
prize is coming," that they begin to
look for it as a regular daily diversion.
To-day's victim is a little fellow, but
he presents some unique features.
The small Spanish fishing smack
Lolo. loaded with fish, intended for Ha
vana, was caught off the Cuban coast
by the Dolphin. In the hands of Lieu
tenant-Commander Lyons, the Dolphin
has become quite formidable. There
are scoffers on the flagship, who say
to-day that when the Dolphin put a
prize crew of four aboard the redolent
Lolo and rounded her up last evening
close by Admiral Sampson's splendid
vessel, the prize crew made the mis
take of coming up to the New York
from the windward. Many protests
were heard from the New York's gold
laced officers as they sniffed the aroma
of the Lolo's cargo, and Captain Chad
wick is said to have signalled the prize
crew to take their charge to the lee
ward immediately under penalty of
court-martial.
Be this as it may, the admiral ruled
again to-day, as he did in the case of
the Ericsson's fishing smack prize, that
fishermen are exempt from seizure un
der the law of blockade, and promptly
ordered the release of the vessel. But
an unexpected complication ensued.
The captain of the Lolo protested in
vigorous Spanish that he did not want
to be released. His greatest aim in
life had just been achieved when he
succeeded in forcing the Dolphin to
seize him. He begged that he should
not be set free, and said the worst fate
Americans were likeiy to visit upon
him would be preferable to being per
mitted to run his cargo into Havana,
where General Blanco would surely im
press him into the Spanish service.
The patriotic fisherman was accom
modated and he arrived here this morn
ing, a willing prisoner, glad enough
to have escaped conscription.

PAPERS HAVE
CHANCED TUNE
The German Press Called
Down Very Hard by
the Government.
Take Their Lesson and Now
Praise the Stand Taken by
the United States.
Of Course This Change Is Due to
the Former Unfriendly Altitude
Shown by France.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April 30.â Public attention
is so engrossed with the Hispano-Am
erican struggle that the re-convening
of the Reichstag and Prussian Diet
have been almost unnoticed. The news
papers print entire pages of war news
from all parts, mostly unreliable, and
much of it is unfavorable to the United
States. Extras are repeatedly issued
alleging great naval disasters to the
Americans. One of the worst offenders
announced on Wednesday evening last
that four American warships had beeji
blown up (giving among the victims a
fictitious ironclad) off BuenoÃ Ayres.
As a whole, however, the German press
has ceased its hostile tone toward the
United States. For this change the Gov
ernment is entirely responsible, as all
the newspapers which are in the habit
of obtaining information from the For
eign Office, which includes all news
papers of importance in the empire,
were this week given a hint to stop
their abuse of the United States as be
ing directly opposed to the Govern
ment's attitude, besides being unpa
triotic and politically unwise. The hint
was effective, and not a line directly
hostile to America has since been print
ed in any paper. Several newspapers,
notably the Frankfort Zeitung, have
adopted a distinctly friendly tone re
specting the war.
The fact that Paris, Rome and Por
tuguese newspapers, which are even
more unfriendly to the United States
than the German newspapers were, all
point out that the war is a conflict of
the Latins against the Anglo-Saxons,
also has had some effect in bringing
about the quick change in Germany, and
some of the formerly most hostile Ger
man newspapers are now emphasizing
the view that the interests of Germany
are entirely on the side of America.
For instance, the Berlin Post, which en
joys close relations with Prince Ho
henlohe, the Imperial Chancellor, and
which hitherto has roundly abused the
United States as "rapacious" and
"Pharisaical," now quotes utterances of
French newspapers and deduces there
from that it must be clearly to' Ger
many's interests to side with the ene
mies of France.
Among a mass of articles dealing with
the war the Kreuz Zeitung, a favorite
army paper, publishes an article con
tributed by Major Scheibert, who,
judging from personal experiences dur
ing the Civil War in the United States,
says: "The Americans, doubtless, will
incur serious reverses at the com
mencement of hostilities, and unless
their navy is strong enough to force
a great battle and demolish the naval
resources of Spain, which I think very

doubtful, the war will drag along for
years and cost America much more
blood and treasure than her people be
lieve possible."
Herr Liebknecht, the Socialist leader,
writes as follows: "The war means a
new grouping of the powers. Hence
forth Europe will have to reckon the
United States as a decisive factor in
the world's politics. If the German
Government is blind I must open its
eyes to this fact and shape its political
course accordingly."
In concluding Herr Liebknecht says:
"The United States, as well as Great
Britain, has been preparing to form
during the past year the newest Drei
bundâthe United States. Great Britain
and Japan. If it is effected it means
the end of the old European paramout
power in the world's policy."
In the Reichstag also this week, dur
ing the debate upon the Kiaochau af
fair Herr Liebknecht told the Govern
ment that while they had not informed
the Reichstag of it. he knew that, dur
ing the Chinese-Japanese war, the
United States had informed European
cabinets that it had vaster material in
terests to guard in the far East than
all the European powers, Great Britain
excepted, and whatever was done in the
far East the United States must be
consulted. This statement was con
tradicted in the House by the Govern
ment.
The war is already seriously affect
ing German interests. The increase
in the price of cereals since April 1
is greater even than the rise in New
York and Chicago. Wheat has risen
| from 198 marks to 221, the highest in
recent years, the effects of which are
much felt by the poor. The price of
meat also is un considerably.
German exporters have decided
henceforth they must insure against
war losses. Premiums now range
from one-eighth to a half per cent. Ex
porters of Berlin, Chemnitz. Klingen
thal, Barmen, Sogingen, Gera, Greiz,

to 1800. Japan is willing to furnish
Hawaii with as many contract laborers
as the plantations require, and there
is practically no check upon this im
migration, except the mere will of the
Hawaiian executive, which practically
surrenders to the planters' wishes
while pretending to control them in the
interests of that white labor which is
much talked of, demanded by law and
the contracts between the planters and
the Government, but which has not yet
put in an appearance.
The Call's correspondent spent a
ploasant quarter of an hour with the
Japanese Minister this morning, in the
hope that progress might be reported
in the arbitration negotiations between
Hawaii and Japan, which have almost
passed out of the public view. These
negotiations arte still Slumbering in the
Hawaiian foreign office. Minister
Cooper is too busy with legislative work
to attend to them. The real reason is
that the executive is' depending upon
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1898.
annexation news "by the next steamer"
(this time the Alameda, due on the
27th), in the hope that they may then
wash their, hands of all their burdens
and responsibilities and place them
upon the broad back of Uncle Sam. The
delay does not appear to disturb the
courteous equanimity of Minister Shim
amura who, for the present, is more
interested in the problem of peace or
war on the international chess board.
Except for occasional "scare fakes"
in Honolulu's "progressive" journals a
stranger here would never judge from
our dolce far niente temperament and
attitude that our national independence
was at stake. We are simply waiting
for the verdict and the return of J.
O. Carter and the dilatory news by the
next steamer.
Attention may be called to a statement
by a Cabinet Minister to-day to a lady
relative of one of the British claimants
for redress for illegal confinement in 1595
Her nephew is one of the claimants that
Great Britain hns informed the Hawaiian
Government must be compensated. The
lady, in viov; of leaving for Australia next
week, desires to learn the probabilities of
the Government accepting the decision of
the British Government. She was frankly :
Informed by the Minister of Finance that ;
Hawaii would not pay the claim unless |
compelled by threats of force so to do. A
mere demand for yayment from Great !
Britain would not suffice; it must be ac
companied by an armed force or its equiv- i
alent As all the nations, except the !
United States, which has ignored the
cries for assistance and redress on, the
part of Its citizens iHega)'.\' imprisoned,
are waiting Great Britain's final decision,
some little excitement may be anticipated
before summer ends.
It may be stated from the very best of
authority that the fate of the Scrymser
Pacific Cable bill is sealed. No matter
what action this Legislature may take
the executive has decided to op
pose any exclusive franchise act, be
it Hawaiian. American or foreign. Gen
eral Alfred S. Hartwell is making a gal
lant fight for the cable, but it is a fruit
less one in the face of the opposition en
gendered within the past two or three
days There are those who say that there
is a card in the shape of foreign cable
combinations up the Government's sleeve,
which is being used piplomatically to force
annexation and will be openly played if
necessary.
Of course the Government, when ap
proached on this delicate subject, takes
refuge in the stereotyped paragraph, i
"Why, surely, you axe aware that at pres- !
ent no foreign cable can be landed on i
Hawaiian soil without the consent of the J
United States. I cannot discuss this sub- !
ject until the question of annexation is j
decided."
The Senate of Hawaii has placed itself
09 record with a few oratorical "bulls'
this session, of which one uttered yester
day is as good as the next. A young
Senator was advocating, on behalf of the ;
tenants, an .amendment to the landlord ;
and tenant's law, and he mellifluously,
tn a rich North of Ireland brogue, de
scribed landlords as "sharks who come
down like an eagle on the prey simply !
to devour it." The Senate being a land- j
lord and corporation house, his oratory I
did not save the bill, whose body was j
handed over to the wolves and connor- j
ants.
We have had a great fuss in the L-egis- j
lature over the Charles L. Carter memor- !
ial fountain. Young Carter, one of the
brightest, most distinguished and com- I
potent of the Hawaiian born sons of mis
sionaries, and a young man full of prom
ise was unhappily killed in the emeute
of 1595. Hla companions in the Citizen's
Guards idolized him as a political hero
and martyr, and subscribed for a memor- I
ial fountain. This they went so far as to
begin to place it on Palace square, or, as \
they have termed it since Stevens hoisted I
the American flag. Union square. Their
announced wish was to keen alive the
prejudice against the "rebels" of 1895.
This sentiment, encouraged by M'nisters
Cooper and Smith, whose safeguarding
shadows are the army and police, was
opposed by the whole conservative body
of the community, who wish bygones to
be bygones and harmony and independ
ent republicanism to reign in lieu of per
petual strife. The fight commenced in
the Senate by a question as to the power
of the executive to grant the site on Pal- |
ace square. The judiciary committee of I
that body reported that the Government j
probably had the authority "by implica- |
tion": but they followed it up by thff j
following concurrent resolution, which ;
was adopted unanimously:
He It resolved. That It Is the sense of â the
Legislature pf the republic of Hawaii that the
occupation of a certain portion of Union square
in the city of Honolulu. Island of Oahu. by a
memorial 'fountain- will -be an obstruction to
the public use of said square; and be it further
Resolved. That a copy of this concurrent
resolution bo furnished to the executive. ââ¢
When the resolutions went to the llousp
Minister Cooper defended the action of
the Government on account of the press
ure brought to bear upon it by th*- <'if i-
zens' Guards, and the resolution was re
ferred to a special committee instead of
being adopted. The reference only delay?
its adoption, although the memorialists
are fighting: hard to retain the site. The
future location of the monument will
probably be KapSolanl Park.

THE HEROES OF THE HOLD.
LORD CHARLES BERESFORD is quoted as
having stated in a recent speech that since he
joined the navy "the proportion of non-com
batants on board a ?hip of war has risen from 7 to 57
per cent by reason of the increased use of machin
ery." These so-called non-combatants are the men
who have charge of the engines and the fires on
which the power of the ship depends, and by way of
illustrating how complex is the machinery of a war
ship and how important is the work of the men who
operate it he pointed out that in a ship "of the type
of the Magnificent there are sixty-eight single en
gines and seventy-eight double engines."
The conditions of our own navy are of course al
most identical with those Lord Beresford describo!
as prevailing in the British warships. Among the
men who are now serving the nation in the fleet off
the coast of Cuba are a gallant host of workers in
Â»he holds of the ships who will see none of the fight
ing and have little or no share in that fierce delight
of battle which is so thrilling to the hearts of the
brave. Their work is down in the hold of the great
ships. Their care is to keep up the fires and watch
the steam gauges. The safety of the ship and its crew
is dependent upon them not less than upon the fight
ing force above that is handling the big guns and
training upon Spanish ships or forts the fire of battle.
When the war now begun rages in earnest and sea
fights are fought on a scale commensurate with the
magnitude of rrodern armaments we shall hear much
of the valor of the marines and the gunners of the
fleet. The names of the officers will become familiar
as household words. All the combatants of the ships
will have glory and honor from loyal Americans
everywhere. There is danger, however, that we may
then overlook the heroism of the men of the hold
and forget how important is the part they perform in
even- naval battle. They are non-combatants in name
only. Whether engaged in the task of directing the
engines or in the more laborious toil of shoveling coal
into the furnaces, they will be fighting for the flag and
â will deserve to be remembered among the heroes of
the war.
For about ten days the public has been treated daily
to the announcement that the fleet has sailed from
the Cape Verde Islands. Possibly it has, but Spain
manifests a disinclination to take the world into her
confidence. IT the announcement ever come from her
officially then may we know the fleet to be anchored
right where she says it isn't.
Germany's warlord seems to overlook the important
fact that riobedy has asked his permission as to the
conduct of American vessels at Manila. The gentle
man has a large territory in which to indulge his fad
for warlordinfr. When he puts "Keep off the grass"
signs in the Philippines he is getting out of his juris
diction.
Sharkey expre a willingness to fight Spain, but
he must remember that Spain is not in the heavy
weight class and has yet to win a reputation. How
ever, if technical points be mutually waived and Spain
consent to a go tire fight must be to a finish, and no
Wyatt Earp for referee.
If by any strange circumstance the Spanish were
ever to achieve a victory, however slight, they would
be utterly at a loss for language in which to express
their joy. They have lied so heartily already that
there could be nothing left to say.
Profound ignorance as to the movements of war
vessels is professed by the Navy Department, which
knows all about them. Profound knowledge is pro
fessed by yellow fellows without number, who know
nothing about them.
When the Spanish capture a coal ship and tow it
into the Philippine Islands they are going to unneces
sary trouble. The United States will merely take the
islands, and any collier tied to them will naturally be
included in the haul.
The people are disposed to leave the management
of the war to the administration, yet there would be
much satisfaction at the spectacle of Sampson re
peating his Matanzas affair on a larger scale before
Mcrro.
Spain declares she will not issue letters of marque
unless her war fleets shall be destroyed. This being
the case, she might as well be having a rough draft of
the letters prepared.
One reason the United States battle-ship the Span
ish reported aground was not injured seems to be that
the battle-ship wasn't there.
SHOW THE BOOKS.
THE Railroad Commissioners will not do their
full duty to the State in the proposed investiga
tion of Southern Pacific accounts unless they
serve a subpena duces tecum upon Mr. C. P. Hun
tington. The constitution expressly confers upon the
board the power to send for persons and papers, and
in this inquiry it is absolutely necessary that Mr.
Huntington should be compelled to appear, when he
appears, with his books. The Commissioners will
never be able to ascertain how much the corporation
has paid out for newspaper silence until they get a
look at the accounts kept by its auditing and dis
bursing officers
One great point to be settled will be how much the
Southern Pacific has from first to last paid the Ex
aminer for its services in pretending to be an anti
railroad organ, while in fact it was a subsidized at
tache of the monopoly. If Mr. Huntington's books
have been kept in such a manner as to cover up the
transactions with this sheet, the Commissioners may
ascertain the truth by serving a subpena duces tecum
upon Mr. Hearst's representative in this city. It is
true the constitution does not authorize the commis
sion to regulate or fix newspaper rates of blackmail.
But we understand the power to send for persons and
papers extends to all questions germane to the sub
ject of railroad charges. It is not unlikely that the
best evidence that can be obtained showing that the
Southern Pacific has been wasting its money on news
papers will be found in the Examiner's books.
If a rule is established by the Commissioners in the
matter of showing books it may embarrass the own
ers of other newspapers in this city. We are assured
that the Examiner is not the only local journal which
has succeeded in breaking into the Southern Pacific's
treasury. But this should not influence the Commis
sioners. They are bound to do their duty without
reference to the interests or feelings of any class of
blackmailers. Their duty to inspect the Examiner's
books is plain. It is a notorious fact that that journal
had a contract with the corporation for thirty months
of "advertising" at $1000 a month. It is also charged
that its proprietor held the corporation up on other
occasions for amounts aggregating $15,000. The
Examiner's books may be brought in to establish the
fact that this was railroad money wasted. If that
journal employ attorneys to resist the subpena duces
tecum all well and good: the duty of the Commis
sioners will have been performed.
We do not think we misstate public feeling when
we say that there is a general desire for the showing
of books all around. The people want to see
Iluntington's books, Hearst's books and all other
books which tend to explain why the Southern Pa
cific does not pay dividends to its stockholders. We
are informed that if the officers of the First National
Bank of this city are subpenaed they will be able to
give testimony concerning the Examiner's contractual
relations with the Southern Pacific. It is said that
they have in their possession interesting correspon
dence upon the subject. They should be summoned
to produce this correspondence and those entries in
their books which show that the Examiner's "adver
tising" contracts with the Southern Pacific Company
were hypothecated with them for overdrafts.
The Railroad Commissioners must do their duty in
this matter or there will be a vociferous demand to
know the reason why they evade it.
ALL AMERICANS.
T"*IIE statement has been frequently made that the
policy of the Kaiser is affected by the number
of Germans in America.
With inconsiderable exceptions the men of German
birth and blood in the United States are American
citizens. They are not subjects of the empire, but
citizens of the republic. So it is with the bulk of our
immigrant population. They are not English, Irish
nor Scotchmen. They are Americans. Their service
is due and will be freely rendered to this country, not
because of European ties or antagonisms, but because
it is their country, and their allegiance to any other is
forsworn.
While there has been some unwarrantable talk
about religious aspects of the present war, it is not
true that we are fighting Spain because of the re
ligious beliefs of her people. Religious v\'ars are over.
The grudges of the centuries have long been probated
and are not to be reopened and pleaded in a modern
struggle. This country and England have caused it
to be understood in the world that religious and poli
tical allegiance have no relation to each other. Men
of antagonistic creeds have the same civil rights and
find them protected by a common flag. In the
United States there is no Catholic patriotism and
Protestant patriotism. It is plain American patriot
ism, felt by all alike, no matter by what form and
ritual they worship. Herein is the strength of our
Government. To it all the creeds of Christendom are
alike, and Jew, Gentile and infidel have precisely
equal standing. They all fight in our armies, trade
in our marts and toil in our shops and fields under
the obligations of a common citizenship, and the
same requirement of honor to uphold the Govern
ment which gives them equal rights of conscience.
Other Governments may have to play one creed
against another. Ours commands them all in the
name of that equality and toleration which it secures
to them.
Nationalities on our soil are elevated to the same
plane of equality. They sought this country freely.
It compelled no man to come. They receive its
citizenship and enjoy it equally with those to whom it
is a birthright, and must equally defend it. If the
German empire and this republic should clash the
Kaiser would, look in vain for German subjects. The
spirit of our people in this respect had final illustra
tion in our Civil War. The State in which a man was
born and whence he had migrated did not hold his
allegiance. Thousands of families had soldiers in
both armies. They were at war over an idea, and its
importance obscured ties of birth and blood. What
native Americans did then is expected now and for
ever of naturalized Americans, and they will not fail.
We cannot assert our private judgment as to what
country ours will fight nor what alliance it shall make
in its own interests, nor can they. We may fight a
people with whom their native land is in alliance,
but they cannot therefore put off their allegiance like
a worn garment and, staying under our flag, refuse
to defend it or to follow where it leads in aggression.
They may quit our jurisdiction and abandon our pro
tection for another if they choose, but that must be
settled with their individual conscience. These re
flections are of importance, because it is evident
that through this war the United States will rise to
a policy that increases our contacts with the diplom
acy and affairs of the nations and enlarges the risks of
friction that may chafe any or every nation- whose
subjects we have received as immigrants with whom
we have freely shared our American birthright. What
ever adds to the power and prestige of this nation its
Government will do, and therein will command the
person and the purse of every man under its flag.
THE SA3T FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1898.
THE BOND ISSUE.
rROM the vote taken on the war revenue bill
in the House of Representatives, as well as from
the tone of the debate on the measure, it appears
evident that the Democrats and Populists have de
cided to make a fight against the administration in
the campaign this fall upon the proposed issue of
$500,000,000 of bonds. That was the only feature of
the bill strongly opposed, and the vote to strike it
out was supported by every Democrat and every Pop
ulist in the House, with but six exceptions.
The issue is one on which the Republican party
can willingly meet its combined opponents when the
time comes to submit it to the people in the Con
gressional elections. It is one which involves directly
the controversy between the silver and the gold men
and indirectly the Democratic proposal of an income
tax. Both of these questions are familiar to the peo
ple, and there will be little or no confusion in the
public mind on the new phase of the contest.
The bonds provided for by the bill as adopted by
the House are to be issued as a popular loan in va
rious denominations, some of them being for sums as
low as $25, so that they will be in reach of all who
wish to subscribe for them. They are payable in
coin, but it is important to note that Mr. Bland, the
veteran leader of the silver forces, stated in the House
during the debate that "payable in coin" means at
this time "payable in gold," since, as he pointed out,
the country is at this time conducting its finances
on the gold standard and will borrow money on that
basis.
The objections made to the issue by the combined
opposition were of three kinds. First, that no bonds
should be issued at all, but that the Government
should use the silver in the treasury for present ex
penses and impose an income tax to provide a future
income. Second, that if bonds are to be issued the
amount should not exceed the sum of $150,000,000, as
the prospects of the war from the present outlook do
not justify a larger loan. Third, that whatever bonds
are issued should be made specifically payable in gold
or silver, at the option of the Government, so as to
retain the right to- pay them in silver if the people
should ever vote for the remonetization of the white
metal.
It will not be difficult for Republicans to meet these
objections with complete refutation. The Govern
ment cannot fight the war on silver, since the people
at the last election declared by a large majority for
the gold standard, and, moreover, to do so would be
to largely increase the cost of the war. Neither can it
impose an income tax, even if one were desirable,
in the face of the recent decision of the Supreme
Court on that form of taxation in the Wilson tariff.
A large bond issue is better than a small one, since
it is not wise to underrate the foe nor to send our i
fleets and armies with all their brave men to the field
ill equipped by reason of parsimony in providing sUp- j
plies. Finally, no provision should be made for pay
ment in gold or silver at the option of the Govern- j
nunt, for the Government when it borrows in gold
dees not desire such an option. This is a gold coun
try, and will remain so. On that issue the Republican
party is ready to go to the country at once. It
means victory complete and triumphant.
A QUESTION OF NOMES.
BY all odds the Congressional Record is the
greatest compendium of useless but interesting
information ever issued by a civilized Govern
ment. This is well illustrated by the number for
April 21, which contains, among other entertaining
matters, a discussion in the Senate on a bill regulating
the appointment of professors at the Annapolis Naval
Academy that developed into a debate on the ad
visability of calling things by their right names.
Senator Lodge made a very learned speech in favor
of the present system of selecting professors of math
ematics at the academy, and on its conclusion Sen
ator Chandler asked him to state to the Senate the
employment, in which those professor are now en
gaged. To this Lodge replied, "The Senator under
stands as well as I do that the term 'professors of
mathematics' is a mere technical designation." He
then went on to point out that one of these "pro
fessors of mathematics" teaches ethics and English,
another teaches the Spanish language and a third
teaches drawing.
In reply to further questioning Senator Lodge said
there are six professors of mathematics *of the naval
academy who are bona-fide professional mathema
ticians. It appeared later on, however, that one of
these is engaged at the naval observatory, one in the
Nautical Almanac office, one in the War Records
office, one in the Bureau of Ordnance,, one in the
Bureau of Docks and Yards, and one teaches mathe
matics at the academy. Thus of the nine dignitaries
who are carried on the payrolls of the nation as pro
fessors of mathematics at Annapolis only one is ac
tually employed in that work.
On this showing of facts the discussion over names
took place. Senator^Lodge .asserted that the anomaly
of calling a drawing-master or a superintendent of
docks and yards a "professor of mathematics" did no
harm, and should be continued, as it has now become
a venerable precedent of Annapolis nomenclature.
He was supported by Senator Morrill, who declared
that the title of the observatory at Washington is it
self "a misnomer for a name. It might just as well
be entitled an agricultural observatory as a naval
observatory."
To all this Senator Chandler replied: "It is always a
great deal better in public and in private life to call
things by their right names, and there is not any
sort of propriety in calli.g a professor of ethics and
English a professor of mathematics, or calling a
teacher of languages a professor of mathematics."
He added by way of clinching argument, "The Sen
ator knows the teaching of modern languages is not
an exact science, which mathematics is."
The conclusion of the matter is not the least in
teresting part of it. Senator Hale of Maine agreed
with Lodge and asked for an immediate vote, where 1
upon Chandler said: "Only one word. The Senator
from Maine was called out of the chamber and asked
me to defend this clause against the junior Senator
from Massachusetts. I have done it as best I could.
Now that the Senator from Maine has given in I
gracefully retire." The vote was then taken. The
drawing-master, the teacher of Spanish and the in
structor in ethics at the naval academy and several
bureau officials in Washington will continue to be
known as professors of mathematics.
It may be stated as practically certain that if the
Supervisors find a "job" in the bids for furnishing
sustenance to prisoners, and are not in on it, that
"job" is as good as dead.
The historian will find difficulty in writing an ac
count of the present war which will be acceptable to
such of the Spanish as are able to read.
Blanco seems inclined to make concessions. He
admits that a mule has been killed.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
By HENRY JAMES.
People of this country read with as
tonishment and indignation of the
treatment Americans are subjected to
wherever within reach of Spanish in
sult. It is a matter for surprise that
some Americans are exhibiting a spirit
fully up to the Don's standard of
meanness. I refer particularly to the
forced resignation of Carlos Sobrino,
who had been engaged as pianist to
tour with a certain fiddler, a foreigner
whose love for this country is meas
ured by the dollars he can woo through
the mystic melody of vibrant catgut,
and who faithfully takes his -winnings
back to Belgium. I have known So
brino for a dozen years. It is true he
is a native of Spain, but America is the
home of his choice and his affection.
He is a skilled musician, Us standing
being shown by his touring Europe re
cently as the companion of Sarasate.
He is of a gentle and extremely sensi
tive nature, a gentleman in the com
plete sense, and to be hissed off the
stage because of his Castilian blood
was an affront which must have been
a bitter blow. Sobrino is married to a
charming woman whose voice was a
delight to the public in the old days
when the Boston Ideals were in their
prime. She happens to be a native of
Germany, but has become as thorough
ly American as her husband. The pi
anist is an unusually handsome man.
His picture, which the Sobrinos to
gether did me the honor to present in
seasons past, attracts the admiration
of all who chance to- see it. It is es
sentially the face of the artist, the man
whose world is the world of music, and
whom a jeer would cut like the lash of
a whip. I feel disgust for the narrow
minded hoodlums of either sex who
thought they were expressing patriot
ism when they hooted off the stage a
gentleman whose offense was that he
had been born in Spain. They should
be ashamed of themselves.
After having determined once to say
no more about the poetry fired at me,
but to stack it in the corner with a
view to its ultimate sale by the cord, I
am induced to recant. In the presence
of the war song of the esteemed Exam
iner, admiration sweeps stern resolve
away and the heart beats to the lyric
strain like the drum of a Salvation
corps. It is not permitted me to know
the name of the poet. I am told that
it was Mr. Thomas Garrett, who had
never been suspected of inclination to
"bust into werse." At least he has
been the war editor of the Examiner's
bulletins, a position in which he has
covered himself with glory, and this
poem constituted one of the bulletins.
If he were not the architect and build
er of it, he recognized its merits and a
portion of the fame shall ever be his.
The real poet must in fairness snatch a
few leaves from hi^ own crown of bay
and decorate therewith the brow of
Garrett. I cannot refrain from repro
ducing here the last stanza of the im
mortal five:
The MangTnvp caught the Panama,
Helena caught the Jover;
We'll have the entire Spanish fleet
Before the war Is over.
So there now! It was only last week
I expressed a hope that some one
would arise to voice the sentiment stir
ring the country. Apparently he has
ariz. Far be it from me to refuse to
recognize merit, even though its habi
tat be the camp of the enemy.
. The "purple cow" came into existence
with the Beardsley school of freak art
and went out on a tide of derision. But
the bright blue horse is with us. A
glance at some of the current war pic- 1
tures not infrequently discovers a cav
alryman bestride a beast of this de
scription, the hoofs of the steed lost in
a carpet of red grass, a pink stream
babbling merrily alongside, yellow
trees nodding in the breeze, and over
all a rich green sky.

There is no particular reason for
commenting at length on the death of
a pugilist from a blow received in the
ring. If to hurt a man is good, to kill
him is better.

A little spitfire named Emma Gold
man, by the laxness of law and the for
bearance of Providence permitted to
be out of jail, has been shrilling her
nonsense hereabouts and has attracted
more attention than deserved. Some
have gone so far as to speak of her re
spectfully. Even deference to her sex
would not permit me to do this. I have
for the Goldman creature all the ven
eration due a snake. Of this unlovely
entity she has every quality, aggra
vated because she possesses an intelli
gence denied the serpent. To attempt
to combat her absurd theoTies, to class
ify her various iniquities, would be to
pa.y her undue attention. It is enough
to say that any one who could be mis
led by her venomous drool would be a
scoundrel, and certain to reach the
penitentiary or the gallows through
the natural process of evolution, so she
Is incapable of acute harm. The
woman, to express her worth mildly,
has all the elements of the assassin,
save the single one of bravery. She Is
despicable as the villain who applies
the torch, who outrages innocence, or
thrusts a dagger into the back of the
unsuspecting. She is unfit to live iÂ« a
civilized country, and there is only one
such country in the world which would
tolerate her unrestrained presence. She
is unfit to live among savages, because
they know and practice a form of jus
tice. The beasts of the field are above
her. She is an accessory to all crime,
a teacher of immorality and treason,
an insult to decency, a travesty on
womanhood, an example of black and
irredeemable obliquity. Such is the
opinion I am pleased to entertain- of
her, although in expression of it ham
pered by the desire not to use terms a-s
har^h as befit her character. I think
she ought to be hanged by the neck un
til dead and considerably longer.
A gentleman who says he "Loves
boys better than horses" writes a pro
test against the never-ending races
which are doing so much to corrupt
youth in this city. He says the races
are teaching the boys to be dishonest, .
idle, and leading them into actual
crime. More than this, he avers that
the Supervisors know these facts. All
of which has the merit of being true
and timely. He suggests as a remedy
that a purse be subscribed to induce
the Supervisors\to limit the racing 10
reasonable bounds. The remedy does
not appear feasible to me. The racing
as conducted is an offense. If the
. Supervisors were honest men, enter
taining any regard for the morals of
, the community, they would need no
cash inducements to give the book
makers a long rest. Being the men
they are, I am afraid they could not
be purchased from vice by any purse
virtue could offer. I regret to have
noted that virtue is often more ready
with an admonition than with coin. It
is a matter painful to contemplate that
it is prone to rely on the precept which
costs nothing, and the prayer which,
however effective, is free. There will
be no reform while the present Super
visors are in office. It would not even
be wise to buy them, for not a man
in the lot has clear title to himself,
and would stay bought. The only way
I can see is to lay for the fellows when
they try for re-election, and try to
put creditable men in the places oc
cupied by a set who constitute a dis
grace to San Francisco. If they could
not only be defeated, but a majority
of them sent to jail, there to pick jute
beside a lot of School Directors, the
youth would have a better chance.
There is a familiar story concerning
a notice posted in a wild western the
ater: "Please do not shoot the or
chestra; they are doing the best they
know how." It seems to me some
friend of the Examiner, if friend it has,
ought to advise that concern to fling
from its outer walls a banner bearing
a legend of similarly benign import.
In its frantic effort to present the news
of the war that paper is doubtless do
ing the best it knows how; and the
demonstration of the little it knows is
painful. One would, if not moved to
pity by the spectacle, have a heart ot
stone. But, although scooped on the
blowing up of the Maine, and forced to
steal its account of the first battle from
the columns of The Call, it could beÂ»
in a measure consistent. Saturday
morning it stated editorially the fact
that Matanzar could easily be reduced
had been shown by Sampson's brush
with the batteries. In one news col
umn it told of the brilliant engagement,
the courage of the navy, the perfec
tion of discipline, the terrible execu- 1
tion, and said 300 shots were fired, 104
of these from the New York. In the
next column it set forth that the en
gagement amounted to nothing, was
not, in fact, serious enough to disturb
the good people of Matanzas; that sev
enty shots were sent into the city, fail
ing to explode, and that no liarm was
done. Of course all this gives to the
reader the advantage of a wide rang*
of choice, but it is possible that some
readers would like to find out what lo
happening at the front.
In the absence of veneration for the
flag and respect for the men defending
it by land and sea, there should be, for
the sake of decency, some method of
enforcing at least the semblance of a
due regard. It is now unlawful to de
face the national emblem by advertis
ing device, and properly so. But pic
tures of the flag are woven into adver-
tisements of all sorts, "Remember the
Maine" exhibited like a piece of junk,
the personnel of the army and navy
made to do duty as dummies on which to
display the latest styles of cheap cloth
ing. Just at present there is a consid
erable feeling of friendliness for these
men, and about them center immediate
hopes for the welfare of the country.
To employ their faces, now grown fa
miliar, to boom a line of goods. I be
lieve to be an exhibition of taste worse
than merely bad. It is prostitution to
the commercial instinct of a mighty
patriotism which should be at least as
sacredly secured against the vandal as
are the stars and stripes which wave
as its visible token.
â¢ â¢
A gentleman known as "Stingy Jim"
writes to tell of a number of inventions
he would like the world to know about;
and really, although the spread of such
information is a little out of my line,
I think the world ought to know. As
may be common with inventors, the
geniuses? whose heads are in the clouds,
Jim scorns all recognized styles of spell
ing and composition, the combinations
of letters he builds being but another
evidence of a lofty impulse to break
away from fixed rules and contrive
better ones of his own. However, this
is immaterial. The burningtruth is that
he has thought out a machine which
is at once a churn and an icecream
freezer. He has a posthole digger of
great local renown, a nail-puller which
tackles the carpet tack -reedily, nor
pauses in the superior presence of the
railroad spike. He can set up a unicy
cle which can be ridden by a child or
anybody else. In very truth Jim's mind
seems full of wheels and other me
chanical fragments. I do not feel cer
tain that these few remarks will be of
distinct use to him, but hope they may.
In conclusion he explains that he once
contributed to the press, but quit when
his poem on "Predestination" was re
jected. I have a distinct admiration
for Jim, and he has reason to be proud
of what he has done. Any of us could
write a poem on "Predestination" and
get it rejected, but how pitifully few
of us are authors of a posthole digger?
To whom among us had occurred the
idea of combining in a beauteous whole
the useful churn and delightful
freezer? Would not the unicycle be be
yond us and the nail-puller above our
intellectual reach? "Stingy Jim" ia a
credit to the Shasta and Igo Cross
roads.

It had always been my impression
that the Spaniards would fight, but
this impression seems to have been
wrong. They like to cut a throat when
they catch a wounded enemy asleep,
and to dabble in any amount of gore
that can be safely shed. But if they
are not cowards they are playing so
deep a game of diplomacy that it can
be followed only with difficulty So far
this seems to consist of keeping out of
harm's way, and lying. It seems to me
Ananias got a pretty heavy sentence
for his one bad break while Weyler
and Blanco make a worse one every
time they open their mouths, and en
jc-y good health right along.
Just once have I indulged in pro
phecy in this column. It was in rela
tion to the future of the United States,
and to the effecet that it was to be an
armed and almost aggressive nation,
checking European greed at the point
of guns, the same having large caliber.
It is far easier to read the future of
Spain. That cc-untry is seeing its last
days as a monarchy. The manner in
which the people are being deceived
by officials, the measureless lies of vic
tory, the absurd assertions of a confi
dence which is not in any measure felt,
all point to the certadnty that when the
truth shall dawn upon the ignorant
but fiery Spaniards there will be reac
tion such as must rend the kingdom,
overturn the throne, and make place
j for a new form of government. Even
the new form will not be stable, as the
I populace, wont to go abroad and ma
chete haJf-starved subjects, deprives
! of this ber.ison, will turn the blade to
! the throat nearer home. At last, whol
ly incapable of domestic control, Spain
will become a prey to the ravening
powers ever ready to take that men
does not belong to them provided it
can be safely accomplished. As tn .
glory of that land is but a memory, so
will be Spain itself.

I cannot believe the Governor of the
Philippines is such a fool as his pro

in the position of Governor would nat

EDUCATION IN SPAIN.
To the Editor of The Call: An article
appeared in the Sunday Call of the 24th
inst. in reference to Spain. The article
in question stated that the "Census re
turns show that a very large proportion
of the inhabitants of Spain are illiterate,
nearly 12.000,000 in the kingdom can neither
read nor write. In the whole of Spain it
was found that but 5,004,460 persons could
read and write, 608,005 persons could read
only, and yet Spain supports 24,529 public
and 5576 private schools."
In matters relating to education Spain
is ahead of England; those classed as
illiterate may not be able to read or write
Castilian, the national language, yet they
understand and are familiar with the
language of their own province in which
they reside, being able to. both read and
write. It is therefore very unfair to class
these people as illiterate. Kindly allow
me to quote from the Monitor of the 23d
inst.:
"Spain has four different languages, the
Basque in the northwest, the Galician,
Castilian and Catalan. These, are not
mere dialects; they differ widely. Castil
ian is the national language and a per
s-on not able to read or write Castilian is
returned as illiterate. Suppose the valleys
of California were colonized by different
races speaking different languages. Now,
if all who were not able to read and write
the language of the dominant race were
returned as illiterate, the statistics would
show the inhabitants in a false light. This
is precisely the case with Spain. Over 40
per cent of the population do not speak
Castilian, and although they may be able
to read and write their own language,
they tigure as illiterates. Primary educa
tion is compulsory on all children of
school age and is free to the poor. Mul
hall, the greatest living authority on sta
tistics, gives a table of the average at
tendance of school children per 1000 popu
lation. Spain is credited with 106. while
Great Britain and Ireland have 123. But
in higher education, which is the better
test of a nation's culture, Spain far sur
passes England. 'The number of univer
sity students,' says Mulhall, 'is much
greater in Spain and Belgium than in
other European countries.' The report of
the United States CunimiHsioner of Educa
tion for ISSS-S9 gives the number of pupils
in English universities as 8802 and in
Spanish as 15.787. The population of Eng
land at the time was 27.826,798 and of Spain
only 16.5M5. 75i5. Spain has ten universities
and England four." Very respectfully,
JOHN S. AVELBANK.

for the new cMty and County Hospital,
after the board has ..formally and to all

members of the Board of Health.

by the. Board of Supf-rvisors. that would
annul the selection of the present site,
and bring -abnut the selection <>f a new,'
'I'll.- jirisent site comprises about
nine acres <â !' land and is situated td
the west <â !' the I'alboa boulevard, arid '
Is contiguous to property owned by
Butro.X-: The proposed Dodge site com
- t u -fnty-riv'' acras, is located to
the east of" the boulevard, and is re
mote, comparat i\fly speaking, â¢â¢.â¢â¢ from
the lands of the ex-Mayor. It may lie
stated that Supervisor Rottanzi has
also been ; brought around to Dodge"s
way of thinking on this matter. Dodge
Is chairman of the Hospitals Commit
l tee of the Boai'l of Supervisors, arid
Rottanzi is a member of that commit
tee: .Pr. Clinton is the third member
of the committee!
In order to .fully appreciate Dodee's
nt attitude in this affair a brief
historyof the manner in which the site
was sele<-tf-.<l is necessary. Kottanzi's
position is not quite so inconsistent.

In accord with this report the Board
of Supervisors on the same day by the
unanimous vote of the- eleven members
present adopted a resolution formally
approving and accepting the site.
c gives as his reasons for agi
tating a change of site that, the pro
posed new site is larger, gives a fine
view of the suri'ounding country, and
may in the remote future have street
car facilities.
By those who are aware of the care
ful and painstaking manner in which
the present site was selected/ it is said
that Dodge is showing bad taste' if
not positive discourtesy and lack of
confidence in the Board of Health, by
his proposed course. - >
At the time the Almshouse tract was
examined by the Board of Health the
twenty-five acre tract was under con
sideration, but was not considered de
sirable because it was much too large
for the purpose, was too steep in many
places and was too much exposed.
Dodge states that he proposes to see
the members of the Board of Health
and try to induce them to come to his
way of thinking. He may then bring
the matter formally before, the Board
of Supervisors.
The questions that are now being
asked about the City Hall are: Why did
Dodge, as chairman of the Hospitals
Committee, approve the present site,
and vote for it in the board? Why did

of Admiral Sampson; bombarded

inflicted considerable damage. What were
the number and names of the vessels en

from both the batteries was so dense
that, at the distance of 300 miles, it was
quite impossible to make things out. As
soon as the firing had ceased, however,
your minister plenipotentiary, with his
usual bravery and disregard of life when
the interests of the public are to be.

and unusual dispatch boat, which the

that its subscribers may get the earliest

'General Blanco, wading into the surf up
to his ankles, with a total disregard of
the fine new patent leather dancing: pumps
that ihe has secured from the blockade
runner Montserrat, held up his machete
and shouted 'Death to the Yankees.' It
was explained to him that the approach

the great and only New York Diurnal.
At once his demeanor changed. With
profuse apologies for his seeming inhos
pitality, he invited your special ambassa

the editorial columns of the great daily

consideration by the thoroughly cowed

â¢Janseri, it : was stated,' was on the stage,'
carrying out her part, and could" hot De
seen until the play was 1 : over. /Messrs.-:
Ludlow and Ward were anywhere in gen
eral, and. nowhere .in- particular. 'â¢' â¢ .'
"â¢ The. Sheriff's deputies then . withdrew
around the corner of the box Office, where
they could be heard but not seen, and
discussed the situation- They had just
about decided upon making a raid behind
the scenes in search of | ihe lair Marie
when a corpulent gentleman with numer
ous chins approacned and -asked if they
desired to see Mr. Ludlow. On being
informed that such was ; the : case, he
stated that he was the man wanted, and
in a brusque manner told them to go
ahead. He was served with the summons,
and in response gave a grunt that might
have meant anything or nothing, pocketed
the papers and walked away, after mak
ing a few remarks derogatory '~ to the
antecedents of Sheriffs' deputies in gen
eral. - . ' Â«
When confronted by a Call representa
tive he was at first as affable as a press
agent who expects a free advertisement,
but when â  a few leading questions had
been put he changed his tone entirely.' :
At first he made the bare and bold as
sertion that Montaine's wife had been a
member of the company but had been
discharged. J When further questioned he
replied: "See here, young man, if you're
looking for information you'll r have to go
somewhere else to get it. ; See? I'm not
here to answer your questions. This man
Montaine is no good. I am manager of
this company, and >my word goes. Mon
taine was with us, and we fired him for
getting, Â«Jrunk. That's all 111 tell you,
and that's. the whole story. He can keep
on issuing attachments until 'he gets
tired.". -. â v^^^gÃFg^^Jff^i^i^^a^*
After positively refusing' to answer- all
further questions regarding Mr. Mon
taine's connection with the company, the
corpulent manager withdrew, and as ; his
florid face resembled that of a : man ' in
â¢ imminent i danger of being ; stricken with â 
apoplexy; or gout ohe was not further
pressed with questions. ;:, ; f
There are many claims against the
company in . which - Marie , figures ,as the
star, but as * the ; company â  carries nothjng
attachable it is doubtful- if the claimants)
will ever realize; ; anything. '-, On -.-.. Friday
night an : attempt was made ;. to attach the
company for $123 75, but it was impossible
to do so, as there was absolutely nothing
to attach. .- If â¢ the company ever ; makes
a return engagement" it will > undoubtedly
be ; met with a ; most Â«' formidable 'â > writ 'â¢; of

IN SEARCH
OF HIS LOST
HELPMATE
â¢
Mrs. Pinard, Aged 16,
Disappears From
San Jose.
â 
She Left Husband and
Home to Go With
a Friend.
Chief Kidwood in This City
Looking for the Erring
Woman.
MARRIED TWO MONTHS
Her Mother Fears That She Has
Been Foully Dealt
With.
Alfred Pinard, a resident of East San
Jose, visited police headquarters last
night and invoked the aid of Chief Lees
in finding his wife, who is only 16 years
of age. They were married about two
months ago. Last Wednesday morning
Mrs. PlnaFd disappeared from East San
Jose after telling a friend that she in
tended never to return.
"I am sorry for Alfred," she remarked;
"but married life is a failure, and I am
determined to sever the bonds that united
us."
After leaving her home it was ascer
tained that the young woman met a com
panion, who is known as Nellie Amadore.
She also has a husband living in East San
Jose.
Like her chum, she was married only
a few months ago. After a short conver
sation with Mrs. Amadore, it is claimed,
both women agreed to leave their hus
bands. It is known they bought tickets
for the city, arriving here last Wednesday
night. Since then their whereabouts has
been wrapped in mystery.
Anxious over his wife's absence, Pinard
last night visited police headquarters and
enlisted the sympathies of Chief Lees in
assist him in locating her.
"1 cannot understand why she left me,"
remarked Pinard, who is only two years
older than his wife.
"She seemed to be devoted to me and I
did everything to please her. I knew she
was on intimate terms with the Amadore
woman, and realizing that the latter was
not a lit companion for her, I vainly en
deavored to break off their intimacy. At
first my wife seemed inclined to listen to
me. and promised not to have anything
further to do with Mrs. Amadore. As I
had . inipllcit confidence in her I conclud
ed that she meant what she said, and
â would no longer tolerate the woman, who
is mainly responsible for the wrecking of
my home. To my surprise a friend sub
sequently came to me and cautioned me
against allowing my wife to associate
with Mrs. Amadore. He informed me that
they- were still fast friends, and that my
wife was daily seen in her company. I
noticed them for several days, but, as
they were evidently apprised of my ac
tion, they did not meet. Last Wednesday
pyening : 1 returned home and was sur
prised to find my wife gone. An investi
â J gation revealed that she had left for San
; Krancisco accompanied by the woman,
1. who has forever destroyed nty domestic
happiness.";
After listening to his story Chief Lees
at once detailed Detective Anthony to find
the misstng woman. They visited a num
ber -of lodging-houses, but were unable
to find the erring wife.
Ul is believed that the women have al
ready left the city, presumably for the
north. Ptnard claims that his mother
in-law is greatly worried over her daugh
[ter's disappearance, and is inclined to be
| lieve that -she has been foully dealt with.
1 Chief of Police Kidwood of San Jose ar
i rived here Vast night in search of the
missing women. Circulars containing
their description have been sent to the
various interior Sheriffs asking them to
be on the lookout for the two newly
made

and four troops of the Fourth Ca\
One battery is on duty holding the for
midable position at Fort Baker, on the
Maria bluffs opposite the Presidio..
Another battery garrisons Alcatraz'

man the modern high power guns and
rifled mortars and dynamite guns.iiear

LOS ANGELES. April 30. 1898.
Brigadier-General A. \Y. Barrett, Cali
fornia Hotel, San Francisco, Cal.: Rolls
all complete and on way to these head
quarters.
. C. F. A. LAST, Brigadier-General.
Lieutenant Sidney A. Cloman, Fif
teenth United States Infantry, who
has been detailed as acting assistant
quartermaster and commissary of sub
sistence, called upon Captain Carring
to-n at headquarters yesterday. They
held a conference relative to matters
connected with the' mustering in of the
National Guard. Captain â¢ Carrington
has not yet received the mustering
blanks from the War Department. He
has to seleot quarters where he will
open his office for the purpose of mus
tering in the men. The First Regi
ment armory would, in the opinion of
Captain Oarringtc-n, be a suitable place
for mustering in the troops, but he has
not yet. ascertained if he can secure it.
He would be obliged to have the entire
first floor of the armory, and this
would necessitate the. companies giv
ing up their company rooms, which
they can not conveniently do, so- Cap
tain Carrington will probably have his
quarters elsewhere.
Governor Budd was at headquarters
from noon until 4 o'clock. Only rou
â¢ ' : tine business occupied the attention of
the Governor. He stated that- : there
was no change in , the situation = and

FOOD COFFEE.
NOT FOB. FBIENDS
Are We to Eat What We Don't
Want.
A famous physician, in a late article
On the subject of health, speaking par-
ticularly of the value of good diges-
tion, says:
"Don't eat anything you don't want,
evf-n to please your friends.
"Don't be afraid of microbes; they
"Will not hurt you.
"A healthy condition of the stomach
makes a healthy skin and a erood com-
plexion;
â 'Learn and practice good habits;
they are easy and most pleasant.
"A diet with an eye to acquiring
flesh should consist of liquidsâ milk,
water, : but not coffee or tea; no hot
breads, plenty of butter and cheese.
;â¢ '-'Above all, eat slowly and never ex-
ercise until half an hour after meals."
Another says: "I have known weak
eyes cured by leaving off coffee, and
hundreds of other 0.-ses of nervous
troubles like kidney complaints, dys-
pepsia, liver and heart trouble, and
bowel complications directly relieved
by the abandonment of coffee and the
use of Postum Pood Coffee."
The alkaloids of coffee are a serious
poison to many people, and when one
finds disease coming on, it is hitfh
time to stop the cause and take some
natural food like Postum Food Coffee,
which rebuilds the broken down nerve
centers all over the human Lody. Ten
days' trial will nrove the facts and fur-
nish great relief to the sufferer.

hundred, maskers were on the floor when

hall several times to the gTe.at enjoyment

Several hundred dollars'; worth of valiK
ab}e prizes were distributed among those
who, were selected by the prize commit^ i
tee as being the most originally, fanci- j
fully or fantastically attired. Then the
1 band began a lively waltz and the fun
'broke loose. The war spirit seemed to
f pervale even the revelers, for there were
j several Columbia?, a Red Cross nurse,
' innumerable American flags and Uncle

Resisting An Attack I
WHAT IT MEANS TO FIGHT
THE ENEMY NOWADAYS.
MODERN SCIENTIFIC METHODS.
. â . ' ;â â¢ â  . . â¢â -.â 
If we are involved in a war with
Spain >r a foreign nation In the im-
mediate future, the best authorities
believe, that the battles will be fought i
at long range whether on sea or land, j
Boarding the enemies' ships and the I
old. Nelson. business of muzzle to muz- '
zleii done away with. The modern i
science of war is altogether different I
front the oldr-fashioned methods. Hand-
to-hand encounter with the cutlass or |
the bayonet was the old way. Now the
guns and mortars of our batteries on
land and sea will destroy an enemy two
miles or seven miles distant. A paral-
lel to these modern methods in the sci-
ence .of war is the modern methods of
medical scienc . In the good old days
this doctor used a lancet on a man at i
the least provocationâ blood letting was |
the brd^f of the day â when a person's]
blood was disordered, or when it was j
desired to: fortify him against the at-
tabk of any fever or disease.

A CRITICAL MOMENT.
A fortification against the sudden at-
tack of all disease-carrying germs is
health, and this should be obtained at
any price, Wr is the modern scienti-
fic method? Health to-day means a
pure and rich blood for the system and
aii active liver to guard the weak spots.
If there be/a scrofulous condition of the
system, catarrh or bronchitis, the germs
are sure to attack these weak spots.
Once the enemy have a foothold in the
breach, they destroy the port they have
taken. The germs thrive and increase
in strength and number and at the
same time make inroads in the neigh-
boring parts, constantly increasing
their domain. This is the battle ground
fo^r+he individual; it is fight or die for
him! This is where Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery comes to the rescue
Just in the nick of time. It purifies the
biood of all the poisonous waste mater-
ials with which it is often burdened,
it builds up. the strength of the body
and puts on wholesome flesh. The bod-
ily weight is thus increased perman-
ently. â  :
In. the beginning consumption is not
such a serious matter. It may be
stopped. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery comes to stre ;then and as-
sist the resisting forces when help is
needed. The odds are in favor of the
germs if our liver is inactive and our
blood impure, or if our health is re-
duced below the normal standard.
What is required is an Increase of our
germ-fighting strength. To resist the
attacks of the germs of consumption,
grip, malarial fever, the dread typhus
fever of Cuba, and many other diseases
of germ origin, the body must put on
healthy flesh, the liver must be incited
to vigorous action and the blood purU
fled so that there will not be a weak
part within the lines of the body, and
this can be accomplished by the use of
this "Discovery" of Dr. Pierce. A
great many cases of wasting disease
which have been cured by Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery -have been
diagnosed by doctors as cases of con-
sumption, when they were really severe
cases of bilious poisoning and mal-
nutrition, accompanied by a hacking
cough. If you want to know more
about all the ordinary diseases, their
common-sense methods of cure, besides
chapters on Physiology, Hygiene,
Anatomy, the Origin of Life, and those
on Nursing, a subject on which every
one should be informed, will be found
fully treated of in Dr. Pierces thousand-
page book, the People's Common Sense
Medical Adviser, which can be obtained
free, as stated at the end of this article.
The grand reputation which Doctor
Pierce has built up in the -ast thirty
years as a regularly qualified practicing
physician inspires such universal confi-
dence as few doctors enjoy. As chief
consulting physician to the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute of Buffalo.
N. V., he has had probably a wider
and more practical experience in treat-
ing severe chronic diseases than any
other physician in America. His pre-
scriptions are standard remedies all
over the world. His "Favorite Pre-
scription" for weak women is the only
proprietary remedy for its purpose, ex-
pressly prescribed by an educated phy-
sician. Any one may consult Dr. Pierce
by mail and will receive sound, careful,
professional advice without charge.
"I beg to state that I have used three
bottles of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery, since my correspondence
with you, and find great improvement
in my case," writes Mr. A. F. Novotny
of New York, N. V., P. O. box 1437. "I
feel that I am in need of no more medi-
cal assistance. When I started to take
your medicine I had a regular con-
sumptive cough of which I was afraid,
and everybody cautioned and warned
me concerning it. I was losing weight
rapidly, was very pale and had ro ap-
petite whatever. Now my condition is
changed entirely. I do not cough at
all, have gained eight pounds in
weight, have gained my healthy color,
and my appetite is enormous. In con-
clusion I beg to state that I can and
wiil recommend your medicine to
everybody who r.iay be in n?ed of same,
as it is a sure cur and is by far the
superior of all similar medicines.
"I have recently obtained a copy of
your 'Common Sense Medical Adviser 1
and I prize it highly. I think every-
body should have one, whether of
sound health or not."
"I had a terrible cough something
over a year ago and could find nothing
to stop it or even to do me a particle of
good," writes Mr. J. M. Farr of Cam-
eron, Screven Co., Ga. "I chanced toj
DR. PIERCES MEDICINES.
see an advertisement of yours, and
forthwith bought a bottle of your in-
valuable 'Goiden -7 'edieal Discovery.'
Before I had taken half a bottle I waa
entirely" well.
"Previous to this, my oldest boy (who
is now nearly five years old) had a ter-
r bie cough the winter before I con-
tracted mine; he had it the whole win-
ter and all summer. Physicians did
him no good and nothing my wife and
I could do did him any good. After
your 'Discovery' had cured me so
quickly I wrote my wife to bring him
back from the country, she having car-
ried him there to see if the change
would do him good. We were living in
Savannah, Ga., at the time. She
brought him back and r'ter giv-
ing him your 'Golden Medical Discov-
ery' five days he was entirely well.
"I keep the 'Discovery' all the time
and would not be without it for any-
thing. Am truly thankful I have found
a remedy that I can depend upon. I
have been the cause of about two
dozen people using it, since I learned
its value. Am certainly grateful to you
for having discovered such a wonderful
medicine."
"I will forever thank you for the ad-
vice you gave me to take Dr. Pierce'a
Golden Medical Discovery," writes Mrs.
James Murphy of Fonda, Pocahontas
County, lowa. "It
has cured me of
chronic scrofula
of twenty years*
standing. I had
doctored for the
trouble until I
was completely
discouraged. I also
had chronic diar-
rhea for twelve
yearst lam In good health nowâ bet-
ter than I ever was in my life, owing to
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery.
"I return thanks and it is with pleas-
ure I send you my name to publish if
you wish to do so."
"I am using a good many of your
medicines in my practice," writes Dr.
Joseph Fike of Lost Springs, Marion
County, Kansas. "Ten years ago there
was an emigration from Rusland to
this country, and there was a lady in
the outfit who was badly afflicted with
that dreadful disease, scrofula. Her
mouth and throat were in an awful con-
dition, and there were lumps on the
outside below the jaws the size of a
hen's egg. Other doctors had been
called and they said it was a fatal case.
I was called and made my diagnosis;
I felt confident that none of my reme-
dies would do her any good. It came
to my mind that Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery was recommended
for it, so I went to the drug store and
bought one bottle and gave it to her
to use as directed. Five bottles cured
her and she is well to-day. She is
married now and has three healthy
children. â -' Â
"If this is a credit to your medicine
you can use it."
"After using about five 'bottles of Dr.
Pierces Golden Medical j -.covery my
boy seems to be all right," writes J.
W. Price, Esq., of Ozark, Monroe Coun-
ty, Ohio. "He was very bad when I
commenced to give him Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery. The doctors
claimed he had consumption and we
doctored with them uni- he was past
walking. It has been ten months since
he stopped taking your medicine, and
he is still in good health. We are very-
thankful to you for saving our son for
us."
"Your medicine is the best I have
ever taken," writes Mrs. Jennie Ding-
man of Vanburen. Kalkaska County,
Mich. "I was not able to do hardly
any work at all; had pain in my left
side and back, and had headache all
the time. I tried your medicine and it
helped me. Last spring I had a bad
cough; got so bad I had to be in bed all
the time. My husband thought I had
consumption. He wanted me to get a
doctor, but I told him if it was con-
sumption they could not help me. We
thought we would try Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery, and before
I had taken one bottle the cough was
stopped, and I have had no more o/ it
returning."
"Several years ago (the night my
house and contents burned up)," writes
Mrs. Susan C. Tulloh, of Sulphur Mines,
Louisa County, Va., "I was taken with
such a shortness of breath and palpita-
tion of heart, which grew worse all the
time until a few months ago, when I
commenced the use of Dr. Pierces
medicines. Before that, I could
scarcely eat s nything, and If I did I
could not rest at all. I could not sleep
at night; I had to sit up some nights
nearly all night. TV as not able to do
any work and could scarcely get
around even in the house. I had given
up all hope of ever being well again,
but was advised by several who had
used your meoicines to try them. I
did so, and now as far as my disease
is concerned am as well as I ever was.
I give Dr. Picrce's medicines all the
creditâ all the praise for the benefit of
my health, and many thanks for your
trouble and advice. I have taken
about two dozen bottles oi more of
Doctor Pierces Favorite Prescription
and 'Golden Medical Discovery' and
several bottles of the Tenets.' I felt
better all the time from the use of the
medicines. I have no commensurate
term by which I can speak of the praise
due Doctor Pierces remedies. I hope
this may induce others, who may be
suffering as I was, to give your medi-
cines a trial."

Several surprises .happened yesterday a-t :
the field day of the Pa^fic Athletic .Asso
ciation 'of the American Amateur : Union j
the most notable, of .wiiich were the lower- ;
Ing of Drum's colors in the 100.-yard. dash )
and the remarkable .performance Vof J
Broughtori in the broad: jump. -i. The latter i
gentleman: just separated himself 23 feeet j
4 inches from the starting: board by a I
single leap, and he. is now. the proud pos- ;
Bessor qfi.th-e. coast record for the .broad '
jump. This was done in the face of a,
strong wind, 1 with the mercury' so low that [
nearly every undressed ' athlete .on v; â¢ the
grounds,'. was, chattering from the marrow
piercing cold. The old-time athletes pres
ent are unanimous in -the opinion that
Broughton would^ have broken -the world's: ,
record under favorable weather \ : condi- !
tions, and they ; took upon this 23 feet 4 I
Inches jump as ; something : worthy Of ; in
delible I inscription 4a, ; athletic archives. â¢â¢â¢. . : ; J
The .historic; jump of . Sehiefferstein, j
made many years -ago, .is now a record of
the past. For several years the jumpers :
have worked to Improve upon It, but not j
until yesterday was. it even approached. . j
Another surpriseâ a sorry â  one: to the !
officers of the associationâ wa^s. the slim i
attendance. .The bleak grand stand of the
Olympic grounds shone put in. all its pris
tine bareness, with : the exception o;f a few ,
black spots . on It. herÂ« and there; , The
chilling blasts, and an .overcast sky are.
charged with . the. poof ; attendance. A.
south wind rattled through the ratters,
and the sluggish circulation of the spec
tators refused to .-respond, to the- false ex- â¢;
citations of stamping and shouting. Is ow.
and then, when some exceptionally fine,
performance on the track or field drew
their attention, the benumbed = limbs and
hands were forgotten for the moment..
Considering the few -people, there, a. re
spectable volume of noise emanated from
tne grand stand, but this, no aoiu>t. was
due to the vain attempt on the part of the j
spectators to shake off the. cold, not a
spontaneous explosion of pent-up en
thusiasm. â¢> ... â¢ . ; . - â¢ : â  ...
It took three heats to settle who should
run in the finals of the 100-yard . dash. .
A. Abadie. A. A. 1,.. with .wings, on his .
feet; Drum; -who. since his entrance at ;
college has not tasted of defeat in : : any
race, and Broughton, his college mate, ;
ail started on the. mark. Abadie, with a |
dash, took the lead, and gaining an ad- |
vantage by a speedy start, tore down]
the stretch to the tape. The few yards
framed by' the start was an " absolute, j
quantity, knowing no. variance, and .]
Abadie "finished just as far in advance, of j
Drum, once the undisputed but now the .
migarlanded champion; for Drum's record i
of 10 1-5 seconds was not touched by his <
younger competitor. The time was 10 1:-5 ,
seconds. â¢ â  . ';â :.?.-
Soon after the 100-yard race was run ;
the announcement of Broughton's rec- .j
ord-splitting adventure caused a wave of
excitement, and it looked as if something!
wonderful was about to happen every |
minute. But the half-mile, well run and j
in good time, gave the perturbed feel- I.
lngfa of the grand stand occupants time i
to settle. Neither Smith of Stanford or,
Carroll of California entered, so. the race
went not to the very swift, but to the
second-rate men. Carpenter of California
took first place, with Straut of Stanford I
second, and Goshen, A. A. L., third. The;
time as fast, two minutes and three J
seconds, which shows a great improve
ment in Carpenter's . running since last
Saturday. . j
The star performer of the day was
Morgan of Stanford. The wind that neu- j
tralized its quickening influence in the
long distance races by blowing on the
backs and against the faces of the run
ners alternately favored Morgan in the
high hurdle race, lie took the sticks
beautifully and in the fast time of 15 4-3
seconds. In the low hurdles, the way in
which he moved over the ground and the
vigorous finish told the spectators, that
very fast time was made. Morgan ran I
the 220 hurdles in 26 seconds flat, equaling j
Torrey's record made on an Eastern !
track. In the high jump Morgan, got sec- |
ond place, which combined with two vic
tories in the hurdle races gave him the
all-around championship of the day.
There was no question who would win
the banner after half the programme had
run its course. California will have an
other emblem to add to its collection of
track trophies. ; California I . scored :55
points, the -A. A. 1,. 40 and Stanford 20.
The mile run brougt out Finne, a
sprinter of great promise. He won easily
from Carpenter and Jackson, the tried ;
athletes of California.
In the 440 the pride or the A. A. L,.,
Cadogan, won from Wool sey and Hi-nz.
neither of whom could catch the "prep"
school-boy. Cadogan covered the distance
in 52 seconds, which was very fast time
for the day.
Plaw, the hammer thrower, did -what
â¢was expected of him- beating out Edgren ;
and the California contingent with ap
parent ease. â  . , â â

in Â« Very Despondent
:â¢'â¢--- Mood. ;.. /. â  :...â â 
Ex-City Treasurer A. C. Widber ap- â 
peared before Judge Cook yesterday
i morning for arraignment on an indict
ment charging him with the embezzle
ment of $117,083 79 from the public treas
ury. ' â  â â  .:
There was quite a crowd in the court
room, as it was expected by many that
Widber would plead guilty and ask to
have sentence at once passed. The pris
oner, looking pale and haggard, entered
the courtroom shortly before 10 o'clock
In charge of Chief Jailer Sattler. He held
his head down as he passed through the
crowd to where his attorney. Edgar D.
Pflxotto, was sitting. He tried to avoid
the glances of his former friends and ac
quaintances, anil seemed to be suffering
I under high nervous tension.
When the case was called. Attorney
Peixotto made a motion that the matter
of arraignment be postponed for one
week.
Assistant District Attorney Hosmer op
posed the motion, whereupon Judge Cook
! instructed Clerk Tolle to proceed with
the arraignment. "When the reading of
the indictment had been concluded, Peix
otto again asked for a week's time before
I entering a plea.
No objection being â ade to the second
request for delay Judge Cook granted the
motion.
After a few minutes' conversation with
his attorney, Widber arose and was taken
back on a street car to the County Jail.
Widber has suffered greatly since his
arrest, and a close watch is being kept
over him at the jail, as It is feared that
if he Is given an opportunity he may
commit suicide.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.

During breaks in machinery the air would become bad, causing; first .

three days I was a new â¢ man, my head is clear, stomada well, no dys-

BY J. J. CLANCY
Â, DUBLIN. April 16:â V: question
â¢whether the ' measure of. : mi Ivor home
. ; rule which has been proposed for.\ Ire
land by the present government is to
.pass into law without having 1. -eh first
mutilateil to suit the .view s--. of the nii
/: norityâ "the : loyal : minority,-' as they.
call themselvesâ has : practicfilly been
decided this week. The Irish and
. . lords : met in convention in this -city
â :â¢ yesterday* and the day. befwre. to .cw.- ;
sider the question, and to the ; surprise
' .-::;â { >f a good many they agreed t<> accept
;.'.-.â â  the bill substantially as it stands -now.
v This fact, of course, insures that rip*
.-.â : change for the worse will be made In'
: the bill either :in the House ..f Coin
liions or in the House of Lords. â  More
t>\or, it insures that there will be no.
prolonged struggle over it in either
chamber. No doubt the bribe offered
to the landlords, in connection with- thÂ«
:.:â  billâ namely, freedom as landlords
from all future lia.bility: :in .- respect :of
local ratesâ has had "something to^'do
: ;. ' with this denouement. But it is nut
. the sole cause of it. The truth is that
â  -?â ; a '"â ; change â  has come Â°. V r-' â  the ; spirit of , :
:. the; dream of â â  the said minorityâ at all
â events, of. â -â â : part of:- the: â â -minority."
Svhi h t-nnsists of the landlords, who
;:r>> beginning to see that,, ' after all,

themselves by trusting the . bulk . of

We all here continue intensely inter
ested in the crisis that has arisen be
tween the United States and Spain.
All the. principal Irish papers publish
every day a very ample supply of ca
bles from Washington and Madrid, be
sides abundant comment. It is scarcely
necessary to say that the Nationalist
Journals ajl but universally take em
phatically the side of America. 1 On the
other hand, the Unionist or Pro-Eng
lish journals - strike no _ very definite
note. These latter.. always follow Eng
land's lead, and England has not yet
shown her hand, and hence their inde
cision; the former want no lead, being
always on the side of America, right or
wrong, and in favor of every country
struggling to be free. As matters look
this day, war seems hardly capable of
being avoided, and so we are on tenter
hooks just as I write. It is to be hoped
that the crisis will J ; not last long, ! arid
that,- if war should unfortunately : en
sue,-it, too, will be of short duration.
As to how it will end of course no one
has any doubt. Srtain cannot be a
match for the great republic. I '

SOUTH SEA ISLANDERS
WED AT SAN RAFAEL
Dusky Aristocrats United for Life
According to the Christian
Bites.
SAN RAFAEL, April 3O.âCupid Bon
neau was considerably surprised a few
days ago while engaged in the marriage
license traffic, accustomed as he is to
incidents of a peculiar nature, to have
a good-looking South Sea Islander,
dressed In immaculate style, drop into the
office and ask for the document that
would make himself and some dusky
belle one. The novelty of the affair lay
not in the application for a license and
the appearance of the man so much as it
did in the explanation given.
"You see," remarked the applicant, with
a suave smile, "I came here several years
ago from Fanning Island and brought
my sweetheart with me. We entered the
bonds of matrimony in accordance with
the regular tribal customs, but residence
under the protection of the American
eagle has civilized us somewhat. A day
or two ago my wife came to me and
explained that some Caucasian friends
had informed her we were not living ac
cording to the rules laid down by Boyle;
so I guess I want a marriage license."
Bonneau gave the man the license and
he went away happy, to be united later to
his inamorata by a Christian minister in
the parlors of the Tamalpaia Hotel.

sion, owing to a,:, condition of neutrality.
: The Minister believes this condition, if
made, was given ' by the Viceroy and
applies only to the province of Canton.
As to whether: .the- Emperor will de
cree neutrally he is not able to .say.;
It is remembered, however, that no de
cree of neutrality i was issued : during
the :! Frarico^Prussian :;: war 7 and . that
China : has not been in < the habit Of is
suing â¢ neutrality decrees on the out
break of wars in other parts of .the â 
world. .i ; Now, however, that China is
keeping In : - touch with the methods of
international procedure this former in
action ' may give way to the adoption of
an .attitude of neutrality. This would
have been .done . during .' the .. Franco-
Prussian war had not President Grant
used his good offices tof bring about an
arrangement by whiihVl^ench- and
German ships at "Asiatic ports refrained

ing toward* the United States Wu feels
that this wotfld not justify the with

would . array Spain against China.. ,.; . ;
' China has a . large number: of treaty .
ports with fine harbors scattered along

with coal,^ahd. ! other supplies, and any
one of them would be, mos,t advanta
geous as ah arb of â  for. the American
fleet In case one was required in the far
East,' It is said;, however, that even,.
without a neutrality; decree by China
these harbors could not be : used as a
naval base of operations. At. most,
they could be. used only for temporary
refuge and for ; such coal and supplies
us .would take the American fleet to the

The authorities feel that the United

securing a coaling station from China
during the recent controversy which
led 'â  to Germany . securing Ktaochau
Bay as : a coaling station, Russia se
curing Port 1 Arthur and England se
curing Wei Hai Wei. There is good
reason to believe that the - friendly
spirit Of China toward the United
States would have made it possible. for
the United States to have secured the
harbor of Mirs Bay, or â¢ some other ; ad
vantageous point on the Chinese coast.
At the present. time, however, it.is said
this China could not voluntarily grant
without assuming a distinctly hostile
attitude toward : Spain. I It is possible
that China's neutrality decree may be
issued any day, and yet the delay is in
no way exciting the authorities, here,
owing to the feeling that, it leaves Chi
na's ports. open to Commodore Dewey's

ST. LOUIS, April 30.â Local represen
tatives of powder manufacturing con
cerns were warned to-day that two
Spanish spies were in town and %vere
planning to blow up powder mills and
magazines near St. Louis.
The information was laid before Chief
of Detectives Desmond and he imme
diately detailed men to investigate.
The informant is Captain H. J. Bailes
of the Cuban insurgent army, who has
been in St. Louis about a month. His
statements are positive and he says
these men have been gathering every
possible bit of information about St.
Louis. A third was with them, but he
has gone to New York. The other two,
Captain Bailes said, visited Jefferson
Barracks and left for Eureka, Mo., to
day. The powder magazines of a num
ber of St. Louis powder companies are
situated at Eureka and telegrams of
warning have been sent there.

found the glazing arid wheel mills had
been struck by lightning and the pow

Ing/the buildings Âto splinters. '. One
man, Levi Hill, an old employe, who
had worked . with powder for fifteen
years, was killed. V .â â .:â â¢;': â  : . >.'â :' ''â 'â  f -
â . Superintendent W. H. Gaffett says
the damage is comparatively slight.
The works had been running only since
Monday of this w.eek, having been shut
down several months. But- 6000 pounds
of powder was blown up, and the dam
-age; to > ' buildings ; and ;r; r all will not
amount to . more than $600. .... . \[ . J
: â :. "You can say," said Gaffett, "that
the i lightning struck both the glazing
and the wheel mills simultaneously,
and that no infernal Spaniard had any
thing to do with it. The only lament
able part of it was the death, of ; poor
Hill. We will be running again in four
or five days." :<: <- -.; ; : '..: ;â  .;â ' 'â .â y'. ,
' The Clipper Gap powder â works are
located on: the main line of the Cen
tral Pacific, seven miles above Auburn.
. The works are . the property .of the
Giant Powder Company of San Fran
cisco, . and manufacture black powder
solely: This- is the third explosion at
the works, the first one killing several
men, and the second doing great dam
age to property. : All have taken place
in the glazing mill. The powder manu
factured here was used in the mines.
Each figxire in a first-class waxwork
exhibition has to be remade every four
or live years. The wax loses its color and
becomes soft and spongy after that time.

:;7 HEALTH CATECHISM. ;
To Be Committed to Memory by All
/Dyspeptics, Invalids and
' . : Consumptives.: . ' . .
What is the first cause of nine- tenths
of all disease? :â â â  .'.â¢â â ' .: '
â  ; . Imperfect digestion of. food. : . : â¢ . :
- : : Why does . imperfect digestion cause
disease of other organs? â  ," â¢ ..'. . ;
iÃecausei Because blood, nerves, muscles, bone
and flesh are derived from the food we
eat and digest. If digestion, is perfect
the blood is pure, nerves and muscles
strong-, flesh firm. If the digestion is
poor, the blood is supplied from half-
digested, ; fermenting food, irritating
every nerve and organ. The result is,
sooner or later," organic disease, be-
cause: every organ being poorly nour-
ished the weakest gives way first and
we have liver trouble, kidney com-
plaints, heart disease or consumption.
. Is : not dieting the usual and best
treatment to cure indigestion? .: â 
No, because the dyspeptic has been
starved long; enough; what is needed
is abundant nourishment, not the lack
of it. The stomach and blood demand
nutriment, not bran crackers.
What is the best method of cure? .
Plenty of wholesome food well di-
gested. 'â .'â ' -.'.':â 'â¢â â  â -'... - : . â â .-: â '-.- :.
But how can a weak stomach digest
plenty of wholesome food?
By taking with the food after each
meal certain harmless remedies which
are known to digest food and thus
nourish the blood and rest the weak
stomach. :
What are these harmless remedies?
The most valuable are vegetable fer-
ments, pure .pepsin, Golden Seal and
fruit salts. All of these are now com-
bined in the form of pleasant tasting
tablets sold by druggists under the
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. .
Are these tablets superior to the. va-
rious liquid preparations so-called, dy-
spepsia cures?
Most decidedly, because â  all liquid
medicines become stale with age and
lose whatever good qualities they may
have had originally, while the tablet re-
tains its properties indefinitely. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets can be carried In
the pocket, always at hand ready for j
use. when. traveling or at daily occupa- |
tion. They cost but 50 cents and should
be kept in every family. They keep
the digestion perfect and save doctor's
bills by warding off disease.
Are Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
adapted to all forms of dyspepsia?
Yes, because in all cases the trouble
results from indigested, fermenting-
food. Stuart's Dyspepsia ; . Tablets
cause the food to be digested before it
has time to ferment. , .
-T If you . wish to . know more about
them ask your druggist for a package
and try them. 'â¢

AN UNPOPULAR
APPOINTMENT
An Uproar of Indignation
Over Harrison G.
Otis.
A Born Disorganizer Who Is
Opposed by the National
Guard.
Few Men of this" State Would Follow
His Leadership as Brigadier-
Genera!.
There is an uproar of indignation in
the National Guard of California over
the rumor from Washington that the
President has about decided to appoint
Harrison G. Otis of 'Los Angeles a
brigadier general of volunteers, to
command the troops of this State. Of
all the men mentioned -or the place,
Otis is the most unpopular, and many
believe the one least entitled to recog
nition. -He is no better qualified to lead
troops than others whose names have
been submitted ' to the President.
Granting that he has a good war rec- ;
ord, the same can be said of a thou
sand veterans of the Union army of
1861, who have! signified in a decent,
soldierly style their readiness to serve
wherever/ and . in whatever manner
their services are ; required. In . no
sense of -the word is Otis an organizer,
j His chief function is to disorganize
and demoralize. â¢.; I;. : . â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢'. ' ' . :
Even if he possessed all the attributes â 
of military genius which he claims for
himself his appointment as . brigadier
general .to command troops of ; this
State would be most unfortunate and |
ill-timed. *f As late as April 21 he cast
slurs at the men who- will ; constitute
â  the main part of the volunteer column
from^California. . : lij . this . paper, the
Los Angeles Times, he : said: . : :
. "Wlhere Shall the Veterans Get InP '
. If the advices : from Washington are
correct -in the statement given. out to the: j
country that ; the. Government is not; going
Vto call for volunteers, except from the
National V Guardsmen . : of . the . various
: States (Who are the ; militia and nothing
else).,: it. is quite apparent that a mistake,
and; a: . very ; seriousione^ is being ; made
at ,the : outset', -for .. While .the. . National
Guard and its .officers /their purpose
; with fidelity in time of peace, so long as
j there is an. experienced and seasoned
body :â¢ of; soldiery in the country; it is
manifestly impolitic not ; to place this
force of war-tried men in. position to do.
effective service in the event of an actual
contest. Under the conditions, as they
appear to stand, this ; splendid \ material
men who led companies, battalions and
regiments in the old amry through four
years of deadly warfareâ is to be :â  com
pletely sidetracked, and there is to be sent I
to the. front. In command of the auxiliary j

; Perhaps it is not <rood military judg
ment to allow volunteers to select their
own leaders above the grade of captain,
but 1 it does not follow that a : man who
starts out by casting reproaches on his
"followers should be appointed to lead.
If Otis was a splendid disciplinarian, he
would discipline himself. Â»â  : r : :.
The young 'men of this country will
fightiiarid it will be the duty of officers

It appears that disease carried off more
than the casualties of war and other ac
cidents, and 2272 violent deaths were not
all due to war service, but incident to or- !
dinary service. Thus, there were 10 deaths
from accidental shooting, 37 from scalds
and burns, 265 by drowning, 14 suicides,
etc.: and the final totals chargeable to
casualty of war were 1804 dead from gun
shot wounds, etc., 95 dead from cruelty in
Confederate prisons, and 373 deaths from
other causes, making a total of 2272. The
surgeon-general also reported 1638 wound
ed, but gives no information of the num
ber who recovered. The total violent dead
for the war were, however, 2272. Large
as this number appears, lt falls short of
the general idea of the mortality incident
to war. Some of the engagements, in
i which fleets were engaged and thousands
of lives were exposed, did not result In
great losses, and the following table of
notable incidents during the war will
j show how slight the losses were when the
| results are considered.

Individual ships sustained heavy losses,
such as Port Hudson, where the U. S. S.
Mississippi was set afire by the enemy's
shells and about fifty were drowned. The
sinking of the monitor Tecumseh by a
torpedo in the attack on Mobile accounts
for ninety drowned. In the first attack
on Fort Fisher three guns burst on ships
of the Union fleet resulting in the death
of fifteen and wounded of twenty-three,
which materially reduces the casualties
caused by the enemy's fire during the
two days.
There were many smaller engagements
and incidents In which the losses were
proportionately far greater than in the j
battles above enumerated, and which go i
to swell the total up to 2272 violent deaths. |
The raid of the Confederate ironclads!
upon the Union blockading fleet off j
Charleston January 31, 1863, resulted in j
twenty-seven killed and thirteen wounded. I
An explosion of a magazine at Galveston
January 1, 1863, killed eighteen and
wounded thirty-three. A steamer. Cham
pion No. 3, getting too close to a Con
federate batten* up Red River, received
a shot throitgh her boiler, and 141 out of
150 of the crew and contrabands on. board i
were scalded to death. By accidental ex
plosion of boiler on the Tulip, November
; 11, 1864, there was a loss of fbrty-nhie
killed. On the other hand, the victory of
the Monitor over the Merrimac, on March
9, 1862, was gained with but three casualties,
all wounded and recovered. When the
Monitor foundered off Cape Hatteras, De
cember 30, 1862, fourteen lives were lost,
and the monitor Weehawken sinking at
her anchorage In Charleston roads, De- j
cember 6, 1863, carried down thirty-six oÂ»li- j
cef s and crew. The engagement between
the Kearsarge and Alabama, June 19,
1864, resulted in three casualties on our
side, one of them mortally wounded.
"Every bullet has its billet," and many
tons of iron and lead fly wide of their
mark. One man out of 206 was shot
and killed during the last war, but other
incidental dangers are as much to be
dreaded. Whatever may be In store for
the blue jackets in the matter of shot,
shell, torpedoes and other war Instru
ments, they may take consolation in the
fact that life on board ship is now far
more comfortable and less conducive to
sickness than it was in the early sixties,
and that while great advances have been
made toward killing men, there have also
been vast improvements in the practice of
medicine and surgery, for the want of
which many lives, no doubt, were sacri
ficed in our late war.

Mr. Kodona comes to America in a semi

' ; Mr. Kodona says that the Japanese are
jvist beginning to realize that . railroad
manufactures, can hti purchased much
more cheaply in .America than In England.
and, : consequenttly, the tide of Oriental

"TOO DIRTY
TO TOUCH
WITH TONGS"

terized as a "Smut
Factory."

NO DISCOURTESY I NTENDED
Trie pi'ection of Irving M. Scott Was
Perfectly Regular and
Proper.
The article which appeared in a
morning paper yesterday, purporting to
be an interview with Mrs. Stanford, in
which she severely handles the mem
bers of the board of directors of the
Central Pacific Company for electing
Irving M. Scott to fill the place left va
cant by the death of Judge Spencer, is
thought by most of those having
knowledge of the inside workings of
the railroad to be a piece of exaggera
tion founded on but little fact and ex
ploited by the Examiner at great
length as a part of its policy toward
Huntington ever since that wise old
gentleman stopped the payment of the
$30,000 tribute.
There is a bare possibility that Mrs..
Stanford may have said every word
that was attributed to her. But, if she
did, those who ought to know say it
was because she did not fully under
stand the methods and modes of pro
cedure that pertain to the operation of
the board. Moreover, it is thought,
that this lack of knowledge was worked
upon by others, and the interview was
the result of the fine work of men
holding their enmity to Huntington
above their interest for Mrs. Stanford.
C. P. Huntington, when seen regard
ing the matter, said:
"I will say that I do not know, but
am inclined to think that the publica
tion of the alleged interview is a mis
take, as the board of directors repre
sent the whole share capital of the
companyâ 6Bo,ooo sharesâ and the board
is expected and required to fill any va
cancies: that it did not consult me in
reference to the matter, and I cast
about ninety-seven thousand votes;
but I am glad to hear that Mr. Scott
was elected as a director, as he is one
of our best citizens and always knows
the right and has the courage to do it,
so that I am quite certain that no
shareholder could have reason for ob
jecting to a man of his character hav
ing a seat in the board or being one of
the directors of the Central Pacific
"Of course Mrs. Stanford, being a
woman, may have said some little thing
on the matter, not perhaps, thoroughly
understanding it. I feel confident,
however, that whatever she did say
was said at the inspiration of others.
She has the utmost respect and good
will of myself, and, as far as I know,
every one else connected with the rail
road. There was no reason why the
directors should have notified her in
advance of the proposed election any
more than they should have notified me
or any other one of the numerous
stockholders. The board of directors
is created for certain purposes, and the
filling of such vacancies is one of the
duties that belong to it and to it alone.
"That smut factory that is known to
its few readers by the name of the Ex
aminer will say mostly anything, no
matter how distorted, if It imagines it
can hurt me in any way. Possibly it
did have an interview with Mrs. Stan
ford, but I want better evidence than
what is printed in its pages to be sure
that such was the fact. I cannot say
that I don't understand the reason of
this hostility to me, for I do. You see
the Examiner has a -rievance against
me, and a very substantial one at that.
I stopped a blackmailing income of a
thousand dollars a month that it en
joyed at one time, and ever since it has
been down on me.
"I never worry myself about the ar
ticles that it prints. Willie Hearst is a
dirty boy; too nasty to touch with a
pair of tongs, and I think that by this
time about everybody knows him' for
what he is.
"No; I don't know of anything else
that is news: everything is going along
quietly. Ovext Saturday I am going to
give one of my little family dinners at
my home on California street to about
a hundred of the gentlemen connected
with the railroad, and I hope they will
enjoy the dinner as much as I enjoy
having them. If they do. they will
have a right good time."
Irving M. Scott, the newly appointed
director, had but little to. say on the
matter. He merely stated tha.t he im
agined that he was being elected with
the consent and good will of every one,
and had no idea that his position on
the board could be taken as an affront.

WHEAT PRICES
WERE FORCED
But the Decline of Late
Regarded as Equally
Too Severe.
It Is Not Thought That the
Market Will Sink Much
Lower.
Tha Local Fluctuations of Yesterday
Showed a Condition of Ex
treme Nervousness.
The past week has been one to be re
membered by the wheat trade. One
week ago Saturday December wheat
sold at $1 68, with May at $1 70, and the
following Wednesday the price had ad
vanced to $1 87% and $189, an appre
ciation of $4 per ton. The cause for
this advance was a sharp rise in Con
tinental and United Kingdom mar
kets.. â : '"â¢ ' â -..-. â¢ -â ; .
The very high prices reached in this
market show plainly that an oversold
condition existed, which has given the
market a very weak undertone during
the latter part of the week, the price of
December dropping from $1 87% on
Tuesday to $1 7iv 2 on Friday â a break
of 16% cents from the top. The ex
treme low prices reached by wheat
during the past four years had educat
ed the speculator to regard $150 as be
ing top prices for that commodity, re
sulting in a general shorting of the
market. This pressure was not strong
enough to cope with the influence of
strong and rapidly advancing foreign
markets, fhe more short selling the
higher went prices, until a general
scare overtook the market, which re
sulted in heavy losses to the persis
tent seller.
As soon as this congested condition
wa-S; expelled from the market prices
began to drop of their own weight,
giving the market to the casual ob
server a weak groundwork. This ap
pearance is liable to be misunderstood
while it is admitted prices were forced
too high. Yet it may be justly said
the decline has been equally too severe.
With present conditions $1 75 per cental
does not seem too high for California
grown wheat. Millers' demands will
far exceed supplies, and this will af
ford home producers XÂ£e added differ
ence in freights, which means $2 50 per
ton, reducing the actual export value
to $162%. This price is much below a
Liverpool basis, using a 30 shilling
ocean rate. The wheat crop of Oregon
and Washington is not yet harvested,
and will have to result in a full crop,
as that condition has been fully dis
counted by the trade. The conditions
which will mostly control American
wheat values for the coming crop, will
be the situation abroad, regardless of
the fact that the crops abroad are most
promising. The demand for American
wheat will be large. English and
French stocks have never been so near
ly exhausted as at present. This is in
the face of America's statistics of two
hundred and ten million bushels since
July 1, 1897. compared with one hun
dred and forty-five million bushels for
the year ending at that date, showing
that the United States and Canada
have exported fifty-five million bushels
more wheat during the past ten
months than the twelve months pre
vious.
Leiter, who controls the Eastern
wfteat situation, says he finds a ready
foreign market for his wheat, notwith
standing spot wheat is selling at 120
per bushel in the Chicago market. It
is estimated two and a half million
bushels of contract wheat, which cost
him upward of 110 per bushel, will be
delivered on Monday. It is not con
sidered a squeezing transaction at all.
He has sold the wheat ahead to for
eigners, and asks for its delivery in
order that he may meet his own sales.
The May option seems congested.
Many have sold, trusting to past ex
periences to favor the paper seller. The
conditions east of the Rockies since last
harvest can b<j as easily handled on
this coast. The milling demand will
be a factor of vital importance in shap
ing wheat values this year. The war
going on will result in neglect of farm
work and prove of no small conse
quence. In reviewing the situation at
home and abroad one can hardly fig
ure out a condition that will favor
much lower prices than those prevail
ing at present.
Yesterday's market was one of ex
treme nervousness. Closing Liverpool
cables quoted September wheat %d and
December %d higher, the advance com
ing in the face of a big decline in Amer
ican markets yesterday. At the ini
tial trading yesterday December sold
at 174: Heavy offerings by local plung
ers broke the price quickly to 173 from
where It rallied to 174 V&. The advance
was of short duration, buyers becoming
timid and selling out, thereby assist
ing the shorts in hammering prices.
The market did not find a resting place
urttiri72% was reached. Good support
ing orders stopped the decline and
caused a rally to 172%. May was nomi
nally 174; May sellers gave notice of
deliveries! for Monday. Shippers are the
principal holders of May contracts.
The market closed for the week in
an oversold condition. Should foreign
markets show advancing tendencies
this week no doubt shorts would find
wheat offerings scarce and a sharp ad
vance result.
Barley has been dull and worthy of
no special note. Prices held fairly firm
in the face of heavy importation of corn
into the State. The market will not
probably feel the true result of corn
feeding until stock has been educated
to its use. At first only light feeding
of corn can be indulged in, its feeding
being graduated. There are now en
route 1700 cars of corn from the East
destined to points in the State. De
cember barley closed at 133% with few
buyers or sellers. . All May contracts
will be met, -which ma.y overstock the
spot market.

BOBB2D HIS EMPLOYERS.
Arrest of Arthur Kern, Aged Six
teen Years, for Grand
Larceny.
Arthur Kern, aged 16 years, and James
! Dormady, aged 21 years, were arrested
: last evening by Detectives Ryan and
i ODea and locked up in the tanks. Kern
is employed by the Columbia Tea Com
pany of 250 Sixth street in the capacKy of
clerk. During the past week, it is claim
j ed, he managed to get away with $120 be
i longing to his employers.
His scheme was to await a favorable
1 oportunity and then rob the cash
i drawer. As suspicion was fastened on
I him his employers notified the police,
I with the result that Ryan and ODea
were detailed to make an investigation.
I Last evening, becoming convinced that
I Kern was the culprit, they decided to ar
i rest him. He was found in the company
I of Dormady, who was also taken into cus
tody. When searched at the City Prison
i $108" was found in the possession of Dor
mady. He admitted that the money had
been given to him by Kern. The latter
made a confession to the detectives, ad
mitting his guilt and claiming that Dor
mady had received most of the money.
i It Is more than likely that Dormady will
be charged with being an accessory to the
crime.

Melba's au revoir to San Francisco
In selected scenes from nve operas
was unceremoniously parted in the
middle last night by a fire which,
broke out in a neighboring livery
stable and blew some of its smoke
and flame through the windows in
the rear of the gallery in the Cali
fornia Theater. The house was crowd
ed to almost the last stretching point
with the flower, fashion and musical
element of the town; hundreds of per
sons were standing in the aisles, on
the several flights pf stairs and lit
the foyer; and every seat was occu
pied. The situation was everything
vnat it should have been for a sick
ening panic But,, by an odd humor
of fatej there had been a false alarm
of fire earlier in the evening â a steam
pipe, used for heating t-ie stage, had
sprung a leak and interrupted the
'â¢Rigoletto" sceneâ so when the real
thing happened and the gallery com
menced shuffling and murmuring,
and the downstairs part of the au
dience rose, Manager Marx came be
fore the footlights a second time and
politely asked the crowd to keep its
seat and avoid a silly panic. And
thanks to the burst steam pipe and
the cool head of Mr. Marx an almost
limitless loss of life and limb was
avoided. ;
The excitement "was, of course,
immense. The orchestra musicians,
whose business it was to keep cool
and play soothing music (a selection

before I knew it half the big au
dience was outside the theater,
frightened, but unharmed; and the
other half followed leisurely.
In spite of the wild rush for the
stage which marked the first part of
the scene, the general determination
of the crowd seemed to be to keep

; cool-headed. And, as I have said be

' the house a half hour or so earlier in

phere of accident and impatience. A
great deal of time was taken up in
patching the steam pipe, and when
the act from "Bigoletto" (which the
steam had interrupted) was resumed,
it was noticeable that Melbd was
nervous and out of the spirit. She
fainted, I am told, at the first news of
the fire and was carried to her car
riage by Mr. Ellis and several mem
bers of the company.
ASHTON STEVENS.
A rushing 1 , maddened crowd, inter
mingled with plungling horses, met on
California and Bush streets last even
ing because of a fire in the St. George
stables, which threatened t%carryaway
the whole block.
An alarm was rung in from box 46
early in the evening, and the Fire De-
: partment quickly responded, knowing
full well that the ilames had broken
; forth in a dangerous neighborhood.
; The. California Theater was packed
with people who had gathered to listen
i to the sweet songs, of Melba, and the
fire caused almost a stampede in the
building. The people in the gallery
were the first to hear the alarm and
rushed for an opening, quickly follow
ed by those, on the. "lower floor. Those
who were in the boxes, jumped 'to the
stage and made their escape in the
best manner possible.
Me'lbaVwho was in the act of deliver
ing one portion of the programme, was
fortunate enough to reach the wings
before, she completely collapsed and
was carried to' her rooms in the
Palace Hotel in an almost unconscious
condition. Many others belonging to
the company were overcome with the
excitement, and pandemonium reigned
ort the stage, although those in the
audience were allowed to escape with
out accident. Early In the evening a
steam pipe in the theater exploded, ajid
one fainting lady was carried to the
fresh air outside. This seemed to be a
warning- of what was to come, and
within a few minutes the fire broke out
in all its fury. . ...
It was a remarkable and yet almost
blood-curdling sight when the patrons
of the theater rushed out but to meet
the excited horses which were being
led to a place of safety by those in
charge of the stable. It is hard to
imagine a more exciting scene than a
large audience rushing from a theater
with flames pouring from the right, and
turning but to meet a number of rapid
ly hauled buggies closely followed by
plunging animals. The Fire Depart
ment acted in as speedy a manner as
possible, owing to the scarcity of water
in the neighborhood, but the flames
seemed to gather headway until the
old standby water tower poured its im
mense stream into the top floor of the
building.
For a time the sight was exhilarat
ing, but when it was realized that
many lives were in danger the sight
took on a serious aspect. The man
agement of the California Theater is
partially responsible for the order kept
while the audience left the theater, but
the drummer in the orchestra should
receive a gold medal and other things
on the side for bravely marching up
the aisle of the theater slowly playing
a march to which the gathering soon
fell into line and went forth into safe
ty's arms without a scratch or a
bruise. That man is almost too good
for active service, and should be re-
; served for exciting times, as he keeps
his head and knows when and how to
act during excitement.
The only loss reported through the
excitement "was Mayor Phelan's hat,
j.but the owner of the head, covering
1 quickly recovered his equilibrium and
made a speech which tended to hold the
audience in the theater in check. A
; more, critical position can hardly be
, imagined. Thousands rushing to a place
of safety were repeatedly thrown off
their feet by the fire laddies who were
I stretching lines to the scerie of the
i blaze, and many spectators went home
: wringing wet from the streams which
j seemed to fill the entire block.
Very little outside loss was reported.
The saloon, Laurel Palace, was flooded
, by water, and the damage is estimated
â  at 5150, but other establishments in the
I neighborhood escaped without injury.
The damage, which is only partially
covered by insurance, will amount to
about' $15,000, and the cause is thought
I to be a crossing of electric wires in the
i building where the flames broke forth.
Fire Marshal Towe is at present look
ing for the man who wired the build
ing, and an Investigation will probably
follow. Chfef Sullivan was rather sur
prised at the nearness of the fire and
eorisequently worked like a beaver to
keep the flames from his feather bed,
which has allowed him many hours of
much-needed sleep. Luck is the main
factor of the blaze, as many smaller
fires have resulted in accidents hardly
to be thought of.
In all probability the engine house
adjoining the stable where the fire first
started will have to undergo improve
ments, and the theater next door will
remain closed until Monday night.
Heat has also a faculty for removing
Democrats from resting and debating
quarters, for at the time the flames
broke forth Sam Rainey was deep in
the problems of politics, surrounded by
anxious admirers, but when the blaze
became too strong the meeting &&
journed sine die. It was later rumored
that the gathering had met in a fire
proof building in the neighborhood, but
there was no proof found for the ru-
However, the parties will meet again.
Another rumor or rumors came to light
i that Spanish spies had endeavored to
destroy the army- headquarters in the
California Hotel, but many think the
heated discussion led by Rainey had
considerable to do with the disastrous
blaze.
As soon as the fire was discovered the
attaches of the stable immediately be
gan the rescue of the contents of the
building. In this they were assisted by
a large number of men and boys who
volunteered their services. Wagons,
buggies, phaetons, surreys and car
riages loaded with harness were quickly
trundled into the street. The horses
were led out on the run and almost be
fore the department had started its
streams there was little left in the
stable which could be gotten out.
The grade from the stables to Kear
ny street made the running of the ve
hicles to a place of safety an easy mat
ter, but was also the reason for a num
ber of accidents.
Every one was excited, and when
starting from the stable would run as
rapidly as porsible and when the grade
was struck the speed could not be
stopped, and many of the men assisting
in the work were thrown to the ground
and run down by the buggies they were
taking out. A number of spectators of
the fire who ventured too close to the
stable were struck by the unruly vehi
cles and knocked down, but fortunately
no one was seriously injured.
The horses behaved remarkably well,
none of them refusing to leave the
building. The fire was confined entirely
to the top story so none of the animals
got sight of the flames, which account
ed for their easy handling.
After the audience had left the thea
ter the house hose was taken from the
rear of the stage and attached to the
hydrants on each side of the building
In the gallery, but they might as well
have been attached an empty barrel
so far as their usefulness was con- j
cerned, for there was not one drop of
water In the hydrants.
In the mean time the hose from the
department's engines were playing on
the flames from the outside, yet the
heat was so great that it burst the two
end windows adjoining the theater on
the east side and burnt out the win
dow sills.
Police officers swarmed Into the the
ater and made a very careful exami
nation of every tier of seats in search
of valuables. Several capes, hats and
wraps were found thrown under the j
Beats, all of which found their owners
on the stage and about the back en
trance leading into the alleyway.
While all the confusion was going
on, in and about the front of the the
ater, Arthur Schearin, the property
man, had a gang of men busy remov
ing trunks and bundles belonging to
the theater, and the actors to a place
of safety on the outside.
MELBA COLLAPSED.
The Great Singer Did Not
Faint, but Succumbed to
Excitement
A card sent to Mme. Melba's room In
the Palace shorty after the fire last
night brought forth an immaculate re
sponse in dress suit and spotless Hnen,
who is known to fame as the manager
of the queen of song.
Mr. Ellis, the immaculate one, said
that Mme. Melba could not be seen, as
she was engaged, with the help of a
few friends and a substantial repast, in
overcoming the excitement and fatigue i
of the night.
"No," said Mr. Ellfs, "madame did
not faint. She is very brave in the
hour of danger. True, she might have
become nervous to the verge of col
lapse, but I am sure she did not faint.
Due cannot do else than- wonder at her
heroism when one stops to consider the
succession of frightful experiences she
was forced to go through. To begin
with, a pipe from the hotel boiler which
ran under the stage, exploded. The es
caping steam crept: up . between the
cracks' of the. stage and enveloped
Melba in a halo. of mist. That was bad
enough, but when a crowd of mechan
ics, who have no more poetry in their
souls than a steel crane, began to ham- |
mer on the pipe with a total disregard i
of the melody above them, you may |
imagine how harrowing it was to the
artistic. soul that stood before the foot
lights. Right on top of all this the fire !
broke out. It started in a stable arid
spread to the roof. People sprang from '
their seats and I, advancing to the '
front of the stage, implored them to be
calm, but to no purpose. Then I ran
back to find Melba and protect her. I j
j discovered her keeping calm while a |
couple of people- were fanning her. Yes, !
I am sure she did not faint; at least '
not in my presence."
Mr. Ellis says that Melba did not |
fnint in his presence. That is no proof j
she did not faint when he was not j
there. The general report has it that
she did. Whether she did or did not
this much is certain: At exactly 11:37;
p. m. she was so far recovered that she
could stand the society <>f friends, a I

WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO SAN FRANCISCO IN THE WAR
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO SAN FRANCISCO /F COMMODORE DEWEY DID NOT HAVE THE SPANISH FLEET IN CHECK IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
"While this strategic play was going on, San Francisco would be threatened. A couple of fast cruisers, heavily armed, would bring up one morning just outside the Golden Gate, opposite the
ocean beach. A formal demand would be made upon the Mayor of the city, for indemnity-^or bombardment. The sum demanded.might.be anything the enemy fanciedâ -ten, twenty, fifty or one hundred
million dollars. The mint alone could furnish a mighty sum. The city would be given scant noticeâ probably, twelve hoursâ to furnish the sum ;if not, the shells would begin to crack over the housetops."
'/~*\ OUL.D San Francisco be bom-
I harded by our Spanish foe?
It is a question which affects
\^ j vitally every dweller in the great
~~^~* â '. center of California, commerce,
for if a "blow is ever struck at this coast
our city will obviously have to bear
the brunt of it. Nowhere on this side
of the Pacific is to be found such an
aggregation of wealth, such richly
stocked warehouses, such treasure-filled
bank vaults.
Already it is rumored that the Span
iards are going to send gunboats to the
Alaskan coast to prey upon the gold
vessels coming out of the Klondike. We
may take this rumor for what it is
worth; probably it is but an idle ship
man's taJe. The Spaniards, just at
present, have their hands full in Man
ila, and cannot afford to detach ships
for such distant service. But one thing
is certain, however. Should the dons
ever reach this coast with a hostile ex
pedition all the gold ever brought out
of Alaska would be a mere bagatelle
compared to the ransom which could
be wrung from defense'ess San Fran
cisco.
A few figures will illustrate the vast
amount of wealth concentrated in this
city. The assessed value of personal
property in the city- last year was $82,
251,831, while the real estate roll
showed the enormous total of $275,334,
295. Of course landed ; property cuuld
not be much injured by a bombard
ment, but its owners -would have to
bear their share of the burden laid on
the city.
Still more important; as holding
wealth in the most accessible of all
forms, are the thanks and the United
States Mint ;m<l the sub-treasury.
There are sixteen commercial banks in
San Francisco, having a total paid up
capita] of over $18,000,000. â¢ "The premises
owned â¢byth.fts.e- hanks -are alone worth
nearly $2,000,000, and they have depos
ited with tnem .sums which""- range ac
cording to the Btatepl the money mar
ket, from J30;000,000' to. SiO.OUu 000 Of
course the banks .do not â¢ keep â  all this
money In their strong Tooms-'much of
It goes out again on loan. But they al
ways -have on hand at least $10 000 000
In splid cash, and at .times the amount
rises to $14,000,000-. To be exact on the
Blst of last July; the total amount of
solid cash on hand was .sl2, 296,579. Here
is a splendid prize for any : national rob
ber who may have the power to take it
This is by no means, all. We must
not omit the savings banks. There are
ten of these institutions doing business
here, and owning bank premises and
ali>or re*l estate worth more than Ja.
000,000. In their vaults these banks
Btnre away some. $2,500,000 in cash, -.the
property of poor, thrifty depositors.; to
whom its loss would be a terrible blow.
Then there is the city treasury. The
Auditor's report shows a balance on
hand of a million and a half . dollars,
and at times this sum may rise to over'
two million dollars. ; = . ' . ' â¢ \ .
Next, the Mint, which must undoubt
edly be. the objective point of ; arty
treasure .seekers. The authorities here
are not communicative; they guard
Uncle Sam's financial secrets too well.
As a high official pointed out to me, it
is not considered advisable to .issue a
detailed statement of the treasure hid
den in the Vaults of this great build
ing. But he admitted that there were
some fifty million dollars in silver in
the strong rooms, to .say nothing of a
million or two in gold waiting for coin
age. Thus the Mint is worth any
where from fifty to Bixty million dol
lars to any one. who can take It.
The secrets- of the various safe I de
posit, concerns s are 'still more carefully
concealed. . No one, even the official
In charge, knows the amount* of , the
treasure hidden In these burglar and
fire proof vaults. But it must be many
â  millions, for men of substance are wont

Many people are familiar with the
United States Subtreasury on Commer
cial street. On the outside it is a plain,
unpretentious business-like building,
but within the display of gold and sil
,ver is amazing. It is a perfect treas
. ure house. Behind the counters men
are .to be seen all day counting gold
eagles and silver dollars. The big
strong room at the back is crammed
with coin. ; Here is the official state

If it were necessary one could con
tinue at great- length this list of the
city's wealth. It is needless, however,
to tell the ' world â¢ that this . city is - a

the "West. The American and Spanish
squadron may meet- near Manila any
day, and upon this battle the fate of
the Philippines and, in a lesser degree,
of the Pacific Coast cities depends.
There is no doubt that Commodore
Dewey will be able to easily dispose of
the Spaniards, but if such an improb
able disaster as an American defeat
should come about, then the whole
ocean would be at the mercy of the
Spanish cruisers.
The ships of the United States would
disappear from the face of the Pacific,
and a descent in force would undoubt
edly be made on this coast. Nothing
but the coast defense squadron would
stand between San Francisco and de
struction. Fortunately, there are
some strong vessels available for
the purpose â the monitors Mon
terey and Monadnock, the protected
ed cruisers Baltimore, Philadelphia and
Charleston, to say nothing of a host of
mosquito craft which would prove in
valuable for scouting purposes.
This fleet would be more than a
match for the strongest squadron
Spain could send here, and only In the
event of their being drawn off by a
feint could this city suffer.
If the Spanish fleet was strong
enough it would undoubtedly make a
false attack on one of the Puget Sound
cities, or perhaps on San Diego, to the
south.' The 'eviast "squadron would issue
forth to battle, and the Spaniards
might easily, by a pretended fltght or
other sjubteTfuge, keep the fleet Occu
pied for a few days.
The" policy of the Spaniards" would be
to- avoid a decisive action, for their dis
tance from their base of supplies would
make the result disastrous. Even if
the Spanish vessels were not captured,
they would be damaged to an extent
which would render it impossible for
them to find their way home across the
wide waters of the Pacific. Sooner or
later, they must fall into the hands of
an American cruiacr, and hence, at all
hazards, the Spaniards would decline a
pitched battle.
In the meantime, while this strategic
play was going on, San Francisco
would be threatened. A couple of fast
cruisers, heavily armed, would bring
up one morning Just outside the Golden
Gate, opposite the ocean beach. A
formal demand would be made on the
Mayor of the city for idemnity â pen
alty for non-compliance, bombardment
and destruction of the town.
The sum demanded might be any
thing the enemy fancied; ten, twenty,
or even fifty million dollars. The Mint
alone, as our figures show, could fur
nish the latter sum with ease. The city
would be given but scant notice, prob
ably twelve hours, to furnish the money
if not the ball would open.
What of our splendid fortifications,
our heavy guns dispersed about thÂ»
entrance to the Golden Gate? What of
the submarine mine fields about which
we have heard so much?
They are all there and ready to pro
tect the harbor against any hostile ves
sel. San Francisco bay ia practically
Impregnable. No fleet, however strong,
would attempt to force its way through
the Golden Gate.
But, unfortunately, though the har
bor is so well protected, the city is ab
solutely â  defenseless. Between Point
Loboa and Lake Merced there is a space
of ocean commanded by no" heavy gun.
There is .nothing to prevent an enemy
anchoring, -there and bombarding- the
city at its leisure: the range of mod
ern weapons is more than equal to the
task.
Those who saw Paris shortly after
the Prussian siege will realize the dam
age which can b^ done, even by shells
of moderate caliber. The Prussians,
during the bombardment, fired over ten
thousand shells daily into Paris, and
of these at least five hundred went
right into the heart of the city. Great
buildings crumbled into ruins, streets
w^re torn up and fires were of con
stant occurrence.
Since then the science of high ex
plosives has made marked progress,
and what happened to Paris in 1871
would be slight compared to the dam
age which a few ten or twelve-inch
guns, firing high explosives, could effect
on San Francisco.
Even so far back as 1882, when the
British fleet bombarded Alexandria, the
damage done was very severe, though
the fire was directed only at the fortifi
cations. The city suffered terribly, a
large portion of it was burned, and the
demoralizing ruin resulted in the down
fall of Arabi Pasha.
The case of San Francisco w >uld be
many times worse, not only becauso
explosives of much greater force would
be used, but because the Spanish fire
would be directed solely at the most
vital parts of the city.
Unlike a warship, a city cannot
move around and alter its range. Noth
ing but a seismic convulsion can shift
it from the spot whereon it is placed.
Therefore, to an enemy possessed of
modern charts, its range is known to
a foot. The Spaniards, from the ocean
beach, would never catch a glimpse of
San Francisco, but none the less their
shells would fly unerringly over the
sandhills, and drop right in the center
of the city, say along the line of Mar
ket street, from the City HaM to the
ferries. And every building struck
by one of these half-ton shells, charged
with high explosives, would be doomed,
the loss of human life would be awful
and the whole business of the city
would be suspended.
There is little fear, however, that
such a bombardment would take place.
The city, supposing the Spaniards to
hold the winning cards, would pay
rather than suffer. The bank vaults
and the city treasury, the strong rooms
of the Mint and the safe deposits would
be rifled of their contents, and San
Francisco would be saved.
It would be a costly escape, however,
especially when we consider how easily
the whole danger could.be avoided. A
few heavy gun batteries, planted
among the sandhills between Point
Lobos and Lake Merced, would com
pletely protect the city. Their cost
would.be but thousands, while the cost
of a bombardment to Saa Francisco
would run into millions... It is the one
weak. point in our systom" of defense,
and it should be seen to.

OUTFITTING.
THE ARMY
IT IS related of Yon Moltke that
when awakened in the dead of night
with the announcement that Fra/ice
had declared war against Germany,
he remarked: "Look in my cabinet.,
file A, drawer 23; send off the telegrams
you find." Then he turned over and
went to sleep again.
An army is like a snake; it has great
length of body and a small head. The
head is the fighting part, and one of its
most important duties is to protect the
body, which consists of wagon trains
and lines of supplies; for if the body be
injured the head becomes powerless.
In time of war, or in preparing an
army to take the field, a vast amount
of supplies, forageand equipment must
be constantly on hand or in easy reach.
While the provisioning of a company,
battalion or regiment" of- a thousand
men is perhaps not a difficult task, the'
supplying of a meal for 100.000 men is
a far different matter; and it is abso
lutely essential that transportation
from the base of supplies should at all
times be uninterrupted and subject to
no delays. For this reason the- Gov
ernment would assume control of such
railroads and vessels as might be nec
essary, and they would be run tempor
arily as an adjunct of the army, pri
vate business* being permitted only so
far as it did not conflict with military
necessities.
If war should be suddenly declared,
and it became necessary to put an
army in condition to take the field, the
general in command, upon an order
from the Secretary of War, would at
once recruit the regular military estab
lishment up to its full limit of effici
ency.
These men, together with the volun
teers who have been requisitioned
from the Governors of the various I
States, or had been raised by direct '
enlistment, would be assembled at j
some convenient point where they I
would be formed into regiments, bri
gades and divisions under officers of
sufficient rank in the regular army.
Most of the volunteers, when they
reached the rendezvous, would be
found to be imperfectly clothed and
shod, and also, in many cases, entirely
ignorant of the simplest features of the
life of a soldier in the field. These men
must be taught to know what is ex
pected of them on the march and in
camp, and what they must do to pre
serve their health.
With an army in the field hardly onÂ©
day in thirty is given to fighting. The
other twenty-nine days of waiting must
be lived through in order that every
thing may be in readiness for the one
day of work. It is not the one day of
fighting which turns the hair of an
officer gray, but the twenty-nine daya
of anxiety for his men, the supply of
their food and clothing, and the main
tenance of health and good spirits
among them. Men do not fight well In
battle on empty stomachs, and yet the
ordinary soldier rarely takes care of
the provisions which are issued to him
for forced marches. He eats them all
at once or throws them away on ac
count of their weight, and at the end
of a long day's march he is hungry,
with nothing to appease his hunger.
Then comes the trouble. He does not
reason; he grumbles and expects to be
supplied wi'h more.
In outfitting an army other things
must be looked to besides the men.
Horses and mules for carting, artillery
and transport service have to be sup
plied and trained. A cavalry horse dif
fers in weight and general character
from One which is to serve with the ar
tillery, and as much knowledge is re
quired in choosing animals fiÂ»r military
service as in selecting men..
Medical officers als*o have to he com
missioned and instructed in the- pecu
liar duties which will devolve upon
them, and supplies of drugs, medicines,
hospital equipment and tents must be
arranged for. Where many new and
unseasoned men are gathered there is j
sure to be more or less call for the
services of a doctor. All that pertains
to the medical department of the army
is u'ndeV the charge of the surgeon gen
eral. The drugs are all supplied by
contract.
Soldiers expect to be paid, no matter
how much they are fired by patriotism,
BO the paymiiSter general and the offl- |
cers of his department must, through
requisition on the treasurer of the
'United States, see that the private sol
dier receives his $13 every month.
In short, every department and every
officer fulfills certain duties, and it is
on the prompt and accurate adjustment
of all the wheels of the complicated ma
chine that it goes and performs the
duties for which it was created.18

matic household constitutes the delega
tion of the Cuban Republic. ,
The term "Junta" has been applied
because such a body or council was at
tached to the diplomatic department of
| Cuba during the ten years' war. As
the authority of the Junta frequently
restricted the action of the delegate
the promoters of the present revolution
decided to eliminate it; yet the name
remains, and is used and accepted to
designate Mr. Palma and his asso
ciates.- -.:;.'. \
. The Junta, as the representative of
the Cuban Republic, acts on high au
thority, for the delegation was ap
pointed on September 19, 1895, by the
Constituent Assembly that formed' the
Government and commissioned Maximo
Gomez chief commander of the Cuban
army. At the same time it made Mr.
Palrna delegate and Cuban representa
tive abroad, with authority to apnoint
I Ministers to all governments and 'to
By One of the California Hundred.
I.t made us all resolve right there and !
J then that if we were to come back at |
â  all it must be as victors, and the rec
1 oids of the company show that in 'â .
' about fifty battles participated jn by :
I the company almost all were won by j
1 the California hundred and the Seco.nd |
Massachusetts Cavalry. They made a j
; proud record for themselves.
I spent the last ten months of the
war in Andersonville Prison and my j
j memory's rather poor in consequence, j
Well, we were escorted by music, the i
band playing "The Girl I Left Behind
Me," and other airs of the same kind.
(>t course, there were many patriotic
scenes during the leavetakings, but to I
those of us unmarried or had no home j
ties it was a glorious day. All. we
wanted was to fight. We had our wish,
have control of all of Cuba's diplomatic
relations ar.d representatives through
out the world. Besides this Mr. Pal
ma is the duly accredited Minister
from Cuba to the United States, and
in the event of the Cuban Republic be
ing recognized would be received as
such.
Under his authority Mr. Palma has
appointed sub-delegates, or diplomatic
agents, in France, Italy, Mexico and
the Central and South American re
publics. Cuba's independence not be
ing acknowledged by these nations, her
Ministers are not officially re.cognied,
but are often unofficially received at
the "back door," and exert ati influence
for the benefit of Cuba in the' countries
to which they are appointed.
Mr. Palma is in reality the head of
the Cuban revolutionary party abroad,
which is one of the three departments
of the Cuban revolutionary Govern
ment, the two others being the civil
government and the army of libera
tion.
This Cuban revolutionary branch waa
all right.
When the ferry was reached there
was just time for a few good-bys and
then we were marched aboard the Gol
den Age for our trip East.
Then occurred an amusing incident.
We were pelted with apples and
oranees in Hpu of flowers. I don't think
we ever got under a. heavier charge of
bullets than that rain of fruit. There
were a few parting cheers and then we
were off, and of all the hundred volun
teers who started off that morning only
twenty-five. answered the last rollcall.
One of the best fights we made was at
Santa Ana bridge in Virginia. We not
only took the bridge, but over two hun
dred prisoners. . We were acting as
Company A of the Second Massachu
setts Cavalry.
founded by Jose Marti, who Is regarded
by Cubans as the apostle and master
mind of the Cuban revolution.
Mr. Palma is not only the head and
front of the Junta but he is the one
person in whom its authority is cen
tered. He was born in Cuba about sixty
years ago.. So direct, gentle, yet deter
mined are his methods, and so unas
suming and plain is he in speech and
manner that he soon became known as
the "Cuban Franklin," and more firmly
has- the name become attached to him
since the potent influence of his diplo
macy has been felt â¢ throughout the
world.
During the ten years' war Mr. Palma
was President. of the Cuban Republic;
made prisoner by Spanish troops,- and
sent to Spain, where he was imprisoned
until the close of the conflict. While in
hardships of imprisonment, he .'was of
fered freedom if he would swear alle
-'ance to the Spanish crown.
. "No!" was his answer. "You may
â shoot me if you will, hilt i.f I am shot
it will be as the President of the Cuban
Republic."
Oh, yes; and one time later on â I
can't just bring to mind where â we
captured Fitzhugh Lee, the present
Consul to Cuba. He will remember the
circumstance. He was wounded at the
time.
Soo%, after that I was. captured by
Captain Mosby and remained in An
dersonville Prison until after the close
of the war.
My son Alfred gave up hfs place yes

it would not be so easy for me now
as it was in '62, for now there is a wife

would be willing to let me serve my

ABRAHAM LOANE
Besides Mr. Palma, the only members
% of-.the delegation appointed by the Cu
ban Government are % . Dr. Joaquin D.
Castillo, the sub-delegate; Benjamin J.
Guerra, treasurer of the Republic
abroad, and Gonzalo de Quesada,
Charge d'Affaires at Washington.
Dr. Castillo is vice-delegate and would
take Mr. Palma's. place in case of his
death or inability to act. Before en
tering actively into thÂ« Cuban revolu
tion he was a surgeon in the United
States riavy and was aboard the cut
ter Rodgers on her northern expedition
to the relief of the Jeannette. He was
a leading physician in Cuba, and wrote â 
a treatise on yellow fever that gained j
for him the title of member of the Aca
demy, of Science in Havana.
When the present revolution broke
out Dr. Castillo was appointed surgeon- â¢
general of the Cuban army, with the
titje of brigadier- general. He was after
ward transferred to his present post
in the United States.
Mr. Guerra, treasurer of the republic
abroad, who has charge of all the for
eign funds rai: d for the revolution, is
a tobacco merchant of New York, who
has been one of the most active spirits
in the Cuban revolutionary party since
its formation. He was intimately as
sociated with and much relied upon by
Jose Marti in his great work of or
ganization.
. Gonzalo de Quesada, Charge d'Af
faires, is a lawyer, a graduate of the
Colu.-ibia Law School, and a writer of
note.
Horatio S. Rubens, who was an inti
mate friend of Jose Marti, gives his
services free as counsel to the Junta.
He is the head of its law department.
He and the assistant counsel, Leon J.
Benoit, are graduates- of the Columbia
Law School. With them is associated
Charles Richmond, chief clerk of the
department.
Besides these there are as secretaries
to the delegation Dr. J. A. Gonzales
Lanuza, duardo Yero Buduen, Federi
co Perez t_arbo, Luis M. Garzon, J.
Nicolas Hernandez, Manuel Ros, Octa
vio A. de Zayas, D. M. Mayo and B.
Giberga.
Dr. Lanuza was Judge of the Su
preme Court at Havana and professor
of penal law in the Havana University.
Shortly after the war "broke out he was
sent to Ceuta, the Spanish penal col
ony in Africa, on account of his connec
tion with the revolution, and was after
ward released under an aâ nesty decree.
He went to New York and was ap
pointed secretary of the delegation.
Mr. Hernandez was Chancellor of the
Cuban republic during the ten years'
war, was made a prisoner at the same
time Mr. Palma was captured, and,
with him, was sent to Spain, where he
remained until the close of that revolu
tion At flic beginning of the present
war he attached himself to Mr. Palma,
hfs friend in peace and war, as his sec-
retary.
With the exception of Dr Castillo,
Treasurer Guerra and the Charge
d'affaires at Washington, who were
commissioned by the home government
on nominations by Mr. Palma, ail
PUTTING A MAN-OF-WAR
INTO COMMISSION
HERE has been much talk of late
f I about putting vessels of the navy
I "into commission." The full
| meaning of the term Is something
-*- of which few have any adequate
conception. To put a modern warship
into commission involves an enormous
amount of work which can be fully ap
preciated only by one who has observed
the process from beginning to end.
When a vessel of the navy is laid up
in reserve, "in ordinary," as it is
called, it is far from an attractive ob
ject and could hardly be recognised as
the same ship when in thorough trim
with crew aboard. The ship is an
chored at a convenient navy-yard; the
stores are sent ashore, her engines and
guns covered with oil and an anti-rust
paint, her decks are allowed to be
come dirty, her sides dull and stained
from rusty chains. Thus she lies per
haps for months, aRd then an order
comes from the Secretary of the Navy,
through the Chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, directing the commanding
officer of the yard to get her ready for
sea. , , *â  â _"_-
The first thing to be done is to bring
as many men as possible from the re
ceiving ship which lies hard by, and
these, with the force of . the
yard, under the direction of what
ever officers are available, begin
at once to put things to rights and re
move the accumulated dust and dirt
from the different parts of the equip
ment, the engineer's force goes at
once to the engine and boiler-rooms;
the anti-rust paint is removed from
the engines; new packing is put in the
valves and joints; the pumps are test
ed; the rust and dirt knocked from in
teriors of fire-boxes and boiler tubes
and grate bars renewed.
Outwardly everything is now in fair
condition, but this is only the begin
ning. It remains to get up steam in
some of the boilers, turn over the en
gines to. see if they are in proper trim,
start the dynamos, test the electric
lights and the pilot-house signals:
turn on the searchlights, start the fans,
work the steering gear and steering
engines, set the hoisting machinery jn
motion, and put the boat cranes in op
eration. Every engine, boiler, pipe,
I wire, tube, rivet, bolt, nut and plate is
i carefully inspected, and if found un
others received their appointement
from Mr. Palma, who made his selec
tions >>n account of special fltrtess, In
nearly all casts made evidei.t in pre
vious service on the field or in the
council chamber.
Then besides, these there is a corps
of journalists Under the direction of
the Junta that has charge of the Pat
ria, the official organ of the. delegation.
The Junta is the organization through
which Cuba's frfe.nds reach the Cubans
in the field. In many places these
friends are banded together and work
for the Cuban cause as organizations.
In the United States and Europe there
are 300 Cuban revolutionary clubs, with
a membership claimed to be more than
50,000. These clubs were the outcome
of a suggestion originating with Joae
Marti, and their organization has been
accomplished by the delegation, with
whom they are all In closest touch, to
whom they all account, ana through
v horn they all make contributions in
money, clothing, provisions, arms and
munitions for those -who are enduring
the hardships of the war. Before the
I revolution began these clubs $100,
i 000 in bank as a war fund.
These most vital contributions must
| reach the army in the field, and It is
the business of the delegation to see
that they get there. And they have
been getting there under most adverse
and trying circumstances and amid
perils of land and sea where enemies
are watching and where a friendly
I Government has had to guard against
j the violation of neutrality laws.
For accomplishing its work the Junta
has in no way been restricted In au
thority, the Cuban Government having
even granted special authority allowing
Mr. Palma to issue a limited amount of
' b"nils, coin money and grant letters ot
marque.
It has further been the business of
the Juntaâ attended by risk of life to
its agents â to keep in communication
with the insurgents. This has been
done by secret agents, who come and
go from New York to Key West, from
Key West to Havana, from Havana
into the Spanish cities of Cuba and
through the provinces of '"\e island.
The headquarters of the Junta are in
a narrow, unpretentious five-story
brick business block at 56 New street.
New York, where no outward sign
shows its presence except that the
stars and stripes and the single starred
flag of Cuba wave from the third story
window, where is Mr. Palma's office.
A narrow hall and tortuous stairs lead
to the office of the delegate, where on
every side are signs of active business,
with shelves, tables and desks holding
heaps of letters, books of- accounts and
documents of various sorts. Here the
delegate works, receives his friends, co
workers and agents.

Next the equipment storehouse is vis
ited and a full allowance of beef, pork,
beans, potatoes, coffee, sugar, salt,
flour, meal, clothing, shoes, hammocks,
blankets, paint, tobacco â in short, the
whole miscellaneous assortment of the
commissary de -^trtmont is placed on
board. The paymaster of the ship is
responsible for every article received,
and a strict account is hept of each.
Then the galley or cooking store has
to be examined to see whether it is
complete in all its findings. The out
fit of a galley usually consists of two
copper kettles of thirty rallons each,
a fifty-gallon kettle with cast iron
jacket and copper-hinged covers, two
steamers for vegetables, each with a
capacity of thirty-two gallons, two sets
of saucepans, a fine set of tools for
lifting and firing and the ordinary
cooking implements.
The line officers look after the condi
tion of the guns, the rigging, the boats,
the cables, the anchors, the flags and
signals, the charts, the nautical instru
ments and other parts of the ship's
equipment. What this means can only

the ship arrives, and, reports himself to
the yard commander, little rematns for

have ".been brc-ught together to consti

Sometimes they are enlisted particu

into service,, at other times they are
withdrawn from other ships which have
just been put out of commission. The
crew and marines report aboard with

EXPERIENCE OF A WOMAN NURSE IN THE FIELD
DEAR FRIEND: This morning I have helped to make our hospital
flag. Our duties at present are much those of a housekeeper. We
attend to the beds, linen and clothing of patients; have a pantry
and storeroom, are required to do all the cooking for the sick and
see that it is distributed according to urgeon's orders. You
would have laughed to see me this morning, mounted on the ledge of the
second tier of berths, making beds on the third tier.
We have just received, stowed and fed 245 men, most of them ill with
typhoid fever. As each came on board, raised from the tugboat and
lowered to the second deck of ours in cradles, he was registered and
"bunked." In my ward, as each was laid in his berth, I gave him brandy
and water, and after all were placed, tea and bread and butter if they
could take it or more brandy if they were sinking.
The men were all patient and grateful. Some said "You don't know
what it is to me to see you," or "This is heaven after what I have suf
fered," or "To think of a woman being here to help me!"
One little drummer boy thought he was going to die instantly, but I
said "Pooh, you'll walk off the ship at New York. Take your tea."
Â»At first he was a bit indignant, but soon had demolished a huge slice
of oread and was asking for more.
Then the doctors made their rounds.
We begin the day by getting them all washed, freshened up and
breakfasted. Then the surgeons and dressers come, open the wounds,
apply the remedies and replace the bandages. This is an awful hour.
I sat with my fingers in my ears this morning.
When it is over we go bark to the'
men, put the ward in order, remake
beds, give clear handkerchiefs with a
little cologne or bay rum on them,

WHAT THE RED CROSS LEAGUE
IS DOING
IN CALIFORNIA
ON Monday of last week The Call's
suggestion that California organ
ize a Red Cross League was car
ried into effect. Governor Budd
had previously appointed a com
mittee, which met and effected perma
nent organization, electing officers as
follows:
Honorary president, James H. Budd.
President, Mrs. William B. Harring
ton, 1118 Sacramento street.
Vlce-presidep* â Rev. Father Wy
man, Paulist Fathers, 628 California
street; Rabbi Voor*,nger, southwest
corner of Post and Franklin streets;
Rev. Dr. Foute, rector Grace Church,
1915 Gough street.
Secretary, Dr. G. F. Hanson, N. G. C.
Sanitary Corps, 639 Kearriy street.
Treasurer, William Alvord, Bank of
California.
The purposes of this body of earnest,
patriotic men and women are explained
by the president, Mrs. W. B. Harring
ton, as follows: "We desire to prepare
ourselves for emergencies that may
arise in case the present war goes on.
FIRST HOSPITAL SHIP TO FLY THE RED CROSS
THE United States navy is to have a hospital snip,
and. strange as it may seem, the first in the history
of the world.
While thousands of workmen have been busy day
and night transforming the steamships built for
commerce and passenger traffic into men-of-war gangs of
men have been incessantly at work during the last week

pital ever designed for service in war.
The Solace is a 3800 ton ship, with a speed of seventeen
knots, which will enable it to keep close to the American
fleets on any expedition against the enemy. The Red Cross
will protect it from menace. There is not a thing about
the Solace to provoke attack on the part of the ships of
any civilized nation.
Such comforts as are to be found in a well equipped
hospital on land are present in this hospital of the seas.
Never before in battles on the seas has there been such
provision to allay suffering and prevent death that might
ensue from lack Â«f proper attention.
Two large steam launches form a part of the equipment
of the Solace, and whenever there is opportunity; they will
dash around among the warships of the tleet to remove
such of the wounded as cannot be properly cared for -in
the sick bay and carry them to the hospital ship. Of ne
cessity this transferring would have to be done after an
engagement has ended, but in' the event of a shin being
i sunk many of the ship's company will be saved from
drowning by these swift launches.
Wounded officers and sailors will be lifted from fhe
launches to the deck of the Solace by a cable and tackle

HOW TO SUCCEED
AS A JOURNALIST
By Chas. H. Taylor, Editor Boston Globe.
HOW to succeed in life Is a very
hard question to answer. I
think that hard work has been
the chief reason for success In
the lives of most men and
women. Good looks, attractive man
ners, circumstances, friends^-each or
all may hiU in the battle of life, but
earnest, honest, hard work secures
most of the results. There may be
such a thing as luck in the world, but
I have noticed that as a rule the peo
ple who do the fighting, .the workers
who are struggling early and late to
get ahead and make progress are those
who find what luck there is. The man
or woman who waits for lueit to come
to him. or her /will be sadly disap
pointed. 'â¢â -....' â 
The best rule for success in life that
I have ever found is to do a little more
than is expected of you.
Whatever your position in life may
be, whether In an office, factory,, store
or workshop, under any and all cir
cumstances, do a little more than is ex
pected of you, -and you will never be
overlooked, be the establishment large
of small. It is the peop-le who begin
about noon to look at the clock and
commence to feel, afraid that : they will
not be "washed up" and dressed and
ready to rush through the door at the
exact minute the clock strikes or the
bell rings who usually fail to win any
success.
In my own case I owe my entrance
into journalism wholly to the fact that
I was industrious and willing to work,
I naturally had that ambition, hence I
do n<ft state it as a quality for which I
am entitled to any great credit. I was
employed as a boy in an office where I
had very little to do. and got very little
for it, to wit. $150 a week.
A schoolboy friend of mine was at
work in a Boston newspaper office,
where he had to work through the day
and four nights in the week untillO or
II o'clock. For his services he was re
ceiving $3 a week. As he was always
groaning because he was overworked,
and I was complaining because I did
not have enough "to do, I proposed to
him that we exchange places. I intro
duced him to the firm for -which I
â worked, and then went and applied for
his position, and secured it. I was will
ing to work to get on and he was not.
I worked long hours then and did for
many years afterward. For all kinds
of success one has to pay a price equal
to the result.
At one time, for a period of more
than five years, I worked in my pres
ent office from 8:30 a.m. until 11:30 p.m.
without a single vacation. Perhaps
the reader may get an impression that
I am pressing home this point too
strongly, but it is the basis o-f sub
stantially all of the success which has
been achieved by men and women in all
lines of life and In all positions of pow- |
er and inlluence from the beginning of
the world.
One of the most successful men I
have ever K-.own won his position and
a large fortune because he possessed
certain qualities which would have at
tained success in an" profession or oc
cupation. He possessed industry, am- j
bition, he was economical, he was hon- j
est and truthful, and he was always
Just and helpful to others.
To succeed in journalism one needs
about the same qualities that are re
quired in the other professions, or most
any kind of business. Men who are
born Journalists, like those who are
born physicians, or poets, or preachers,
or mechanics, or great traders, find it
much easier to succeed than men who
have not great naturaJ aptitude. Jour
nalism offers three distinct careers, a
literary, a business and a mechanical.
Men can be trained for either of these
divisions. The measure of success which
can be secured depends upon the ambi
tion, the industry and the fighting qual- |
TWO STRANGE CREATURES
FROM AUSTRALIA
CATERPILLER THAT IS PARTLY
WOOD.
THE steamer Alameda, which ar
rived the other day, brought over
two of the greatest curiosities
ever seen on that Teasel. One is

newspaper work.
i ities of the individual. There is no royal
road to success.
It is hard to tell exactly what special
! Hives of study and investigation are re-
Quired for each of these divisions. Men
! who have natural qualities and special
tastes will easily excel in that for which
; they are best fitted. The ablest and
â  most successful men and women will
, work out their salvation in their par
1 ticular field.
I might sum it all up by saying, as
I Rudyard Kipling said the other day in
reply to a question by a young author
as to what he should do to succeed,
: "Keep on trying till you either fail or
1 succeed."
It may be, however, that when I was
asked to write this article on "How to
! Succeed as a Journalist" it was ex
pected that I would give some practical
hints to that large class of young
Americans whose ambition it. is to be
i come efficient writers for the daily
press, and eventually graduate to cdi
â  torjal positions. That is, to be sum,
1 only one branch of journalism, but no
â doubt it is the one that is most at
1 tractive to young men just starting out
in life. To such young men, I may of
i fer, perhaps; a few helpful suggestions.
! It- requires a very broad and com
i prehensive mental taste to be an effl
: client member of a staff <>t newspa
i per writers. Men whose mlmi* naturally
tend to some one line of thought should
' avoid the newspape r field, because a
newspaper is a kaleidoscope, in whi< h
the topics to be written about are
changing . every day. To-day war is
the foremost topic, next week the
I Klondike will be at the front agin, and
: a little later it may be that yachting
i or baseball will be the all-absorbing
| theme. Suddenly, in the fall, the scenes
: will shift, and politics will be the sta-
i pie news of the day.
To begin with, a young man who pro
'â  poses to enter the wide yet keenly
i competitive field of reportorial and edi
| torial work for the daily press will do
well to t>e quite sure that he has an
aptitude for such. work. It is true of
I every 'profession and trade that some
men who are in it are peculiarly well-
I fitted for its duties, while others are
I not quite so well fitted, and still others
' are not fitted at.all. There is doubtless
I a place for every willing and capable
I man somewhere in the busy world, but
! it is also true that many men never
' find the place which is truly theirs.
Henry Ward Beecher once remarked
that a large part of the misery in the
; world was due to the fact that too
j many square men were in round holes,
| and vice versa, and that he had known
many poor musicians who might have
made very superior carpenters.
The idea that I wish to convey is that
the highest success as a reporter or
editor is not to be hoped for by any
! man whose temperament and abilities
I are not well suited to the peculiar work
which newspaper reporters and editors
have to do. There is such a thing as
"the journalistic temperament." There
is such a thing as "the nose for news,"
by -which term is meant a quick, prac
tically instantaneous appreciation of
, what is news, and how much value on?
j piece of news has when compared with
â  another piece of news that comes in at
! the same time.
This faculty of knowing what the
j news is and of weighing its relative
i value and importance is closely allied
i to another equally necessary, namely,
the faculty of seeing where a good
piece of news may be dug out and
brought to the surface right in the nick
of time, when it is most interesting and
valuable. lam incjined to think that
this gift of news hunting is born with
some men, and that they make the best
journalists in the reportorial and edi
torial sense. And if this gift is not a
part of the young man's natural equip
ment, if he does not have a keen and
all-alive sympathy with the events of
the day, as they present themselves
every mornin^ and evening, then I ad
vise him to try some other occupation:

by any amount of industry', when the
man is not naturally built that way.
Hence it follows that a newspaper
writer who aims to rise to any of the
higher editorial positions must have a
wide range, not only of information,
but of sympathy. He must be able to
know something of a great many
things rather than to know any one
thing profoundly. He must be able |
to switch his train of thought from one j
track to another suddenly, and to throw
his pen with something like equal in
telligence and spirit upon half a dozen
different subjects within the same
week.
It follows, therefore, that success as
a writer for the daily press will be
greatly helped by wide rather than
deep reading. Ido not mean by this
to say that the writing journalist
should know "a little of everything and
nothing much," but only to say that
if he is deeply read and thoroughly in
formed on one topic onlyâ say on pol
itics, for exampleâ he will never achieve
success as an ail-round newspaper
man.
I think no young man contemplat
ing a career as a reporter and editor
will make any mistake in laying a
foundation by a course of reading
which will acquaint him, first, with the
history of his own country; secondly,
with the history of his own State and
city; thirdly, with the history of Eng
land, and, fourthly, with a general
knowledge of the present condition of
the leading European nations, enough
to enable him to feel that he is in
fornn-d correctly as to their relative
population, wealth and resources, ami
the general drift of their present poli
cies in relation to other countries, and
particularly in relation to our own.
Twelve months of close reading, giving ;
to it from three to four hours a day,
making notes of the main points as he
tr... s . will be well given to this prepara
tory work.
This is a scientific age, and he should
study the popular sciences sufficiently
to enable him to write an intelligent
account of a new electrical machine,
or a new locomotive. If he nims try
become an editorial writer, then all
knowledge is his proper province, and
he should never consider his education
finished, but should road omnivorously.
It is true of newspaper writing, as or
everything else, that what a man does
not know he cannot tell, and it is only
the subjects with which a man is fa
miliar that he can readily write about
with credit to himself or profit to his
reader.
I would further advise young men
who aim at success in the field of
newspaper writing to master the useful
though somewhat difficult art of short
hand writing. There is no occupation
of our day in which the ability to rap
idly take down the exact words of a
speaker is more valuable. I do not
mean by this that it is at all essential
for a newspaper writer or editor to be
a verbatim stenographer. As a mat
ter of fact, there is very little verbatim
reporting done in the daily press, but
there are a hundred and one emer
gencies in a newspaper writer's life in
though undoubtedly mammals through
out the greater part of their structure,
are oviparous, laying eggs which close
ly resemble those of a reptile.
The animal is found throughout the
islands of Tasmania and th^ southern
portion of Australia. It passes most
of its time in the water, swimming ana
diving with the greatest ease, atid form
ing, for the purpose of sleeping and
breeding, burrows in the banks whicti
generally have two orifices, one jusf
above the water level, concealed among
the long grass, and the other below the
surface. The passage at first runs up
ward sometimes to a distance of as
much as fifty feet and expands at its
termination into a e&vity, the floor of
which is lined with dry grass ana
leaves, in which its eggs are laid and
the young brought up. Their food con
sists of aquatic Insects and worms
which are caught under the water, the
sand and small stones at the bottom
being turned over with their bills to
find them.
Swimming is effected chiefly by the
action of the broad fore paws, the hind
feet and tall taking little share in lo
comotion in the water. When asleep
they roll themselves into a ball and
in their native haunts are extremely
timid and wary and very difficult to
approach, being very rarely seen out o*
their burrows in the daytime. When
irritated they utter a soft low growl
resembling that of a puppy.
Captain Howard's specimen is a per
fect one and it was procured for him
in Australia by Purser Smith of the
Alameda. Years ago, when the cap
tain was In Tasmania, he saw one of
the animals and ever since has dosire<l
to possess one. It will be added to
his collection of curios gathered from
the four quarters of the globe during
the wanderings of a lifetime.
which the ability to make shorthand
notes rapidly is extremely useful, and
gives him a decided advantage over
the man who has to trust either to
his unaided memory, or to such long
hand notes as he can hurriedly jot
down.
I might instance in this connection
the work of the interviewer who seeks
out a citizen of prominence and de
sires to obtain a full expression of his
virus on some important public ques
tion. He may be able to make a fair
and tolerably accurate report of the.
man's remarks by the help of his mem
ory and his longhand notes only; but
if he is a good shorthand writer he
can make the interview photographi
cally correct.
Moreover, if he is called upon to has
tily make a literal copy of some docu
ment of whic-h he can only have pos
session for a short time â possibly at
a consulting libraryâ it is easy to see
that he can bring his shorthand writ
ing into service with great effect. It
seems to me, also, that there is a large
and growing field of special newspaper
correspondence in foreign countries, in
which brilliant and highly paid work
is called for, in the doing of which a
knowledge of other languages than
English is indispensable. I would
advise the ambitious young man who
is thinking that he has in him the mak
ing of a good foreign or war eorre
Bpondent 1" acquire a workable knowl
edge of French, Spanish and German.
Beyond these things the successful
newspaper writer needs to cultivate the
art of making friends. He. must learn
most, after all, from men. not books. It
is very important for him to gain the
confidence of public men, official and
unofficial â n - fill sorts of men and wo
men who have news to give and in
formation to impart. To this end he
must learn the meaning of the little
word "tact." It requires tact above
all things to win the personal confi
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
According to
MRS. MARY BAKER EDDY
IT IS now thirty-two years since
Mrs. K.ldy gave to the world the
keynote of the philosophy of
Christian Science in the state
ment: "All causation is mind and
every effect a mental phe
nomenon." To-day tr- mother church
at Boston, erected at a cost of
$200,000, and having a local mem
bership of twelve hundred and a
general membership of ten thousand,
together with the branch churches lo
cated in nearly every city of any size
in this country, all having thriving con
gregations, bear testimony to the won
derful growth of the movement.
â  San Francisco is also in the line of
progress in thfs direction. The move
ment here began ten years ago when
Miss S. E. Bradshaw, a personal pupil
of Mrs. Eddy, located here and began
to sow the seed of her faith and per
form her cures.
From the handful of people who a
short time ago assembled for service in
Miss Bradshaw's parlors, a flourishing
church with an active membership of
over a hundred and a floating attend
ance of nearly three hundred has
grown.
Services of the church are held twice
a week, with Miss Bradshaw as the
leader. The Sunday morning service
consists of Bible readings, while the
Thursday evening service is conducted
after the manner of an experience
meeting. At this session a topic which
has been assigned at a previous meet
ing is thoroughly interpreted by volun
tary speakers, while at the same time
many accounts of demonstrations of
healing are Riven for the benefit of in
terested visitors- who are not familiar
with the workings of the science. But
the people who are most interested in
science consider the healing properties
as of secondary consideration, and the
end, of which it is but the means, is
spiritual growth and understanding.
Christian Science, as expounded by
Mrs. Eddy, claims that the soul,
through belief in God, triumphs over
sickness and death, and performs mir
acles of' healing such as are related in
the Bible. It is described briefly as the
Christianity of the Bible rediscovered.
It ignores time. It takes no note of
birthdays. Age. is supposed to leave
untouched such as are perfect in
health, as taught by Christian Science.
The movement has 600,000 followers
in this country and many in other
lands, professed or secret. Its follow
ers number many persons of great
wealth and cultivation, who devote
their means and ability to spreading the
faith. Their churches are artistic and
beautiful. Teachers and readers are
surrounded always by beauty and by
evidences that Science never lacks for
money.
On Falmouth street, in the Boston
Back Bay region, on a $40,000 lot given
by Mrs. Eddy, a church worth $200,000
was recently built by voluntary con
tributions as a monument to Mrs.
Eddy, to whom the church and all it
dence of people and obtain from them
the assistance that is constantly neces
sary to be obtained in gathering news
and preparing articles for the daily
press.
I do not know that I can say any
thing more of practical value to young
men who intend to try their chances on
the reportorial and editorial Fide of
journalism. I may add, however, that
the same solid qualities of character
which help men to success in other
fields of work will help them in this.
The man of good habits, who keeps
his head clear, his stomach sound, and
his general health good, will have at
least three chances of success to every
one that the man who is physically un
fit will have.
Newspaper work is arduous and ex
acting, and if any young man is think

MRS. EDDY'S HOME LIFE.
â¢ Mrs. Eddy is the founder of the Christian Science School and lives in
Concord, Mass., which is the center of the Christian Scientist faith She
claims about 600,000 folowers to-day. Mrs. Eddy's home life is most idyllic,,
and she lives among the most spacious surroundings at '-'Pleasant view.
Every room in the big house is filled with the most magnificent gifts,
though she is greatly opposed to receiving gifts. She is fond of the best music.
There are in the house three pianos, an organ and a large music box.
Bfsides her house in Concord Mrs. Eddy owns a residence on Common
wealth avenue, Boston, and a fine country place at Roslindale. just outside
the city. She holds all the copyrights of her books and various publications,
of which "Science and Health" alone has sold 140,000 copies. There are nine
other books with wide circulation.
When the official asked her if she was a millionaire she is said to have
replied: "No I will never own $1,000,000 worth of property while so many
others are poor. I could have been. worth many millions. My college alone
has an annual income of $40,000, but I manage to give away enough to balance
my account with conscience."
It was said that '$300 was the rate for instruction for the first course of
lessons given by Mrs. Eddy, and classes of sixty were common occurrences,
while crowds waited for an opportunity to be admitted. Another $200 was asked
for a second course of lessons. Mrs. Eddy herself sa> s that ncr students
have numbered about 5000 since 1867.
held was offered as a gift, only to be
refused.
Twelve years ago Mrs. Eddy with
drew from the center of the world of
Christian Science, which she had lo
cated in Boston, and retired to Concord,
N. H., to finish a book which she was
writing. This book, called "Science and
Health, With a Key to the Scriptures,"
is the text book of the denomination.
One hundred and forty thousand copies
are" in circulation already. This book,
is the "pastor" of the 300 churches. A
few years ago Mrs. Eddy abolished the
personal ministers of the Church of
Christ, and this book was installed in
their place.
And now I come to the strangest
phase of the strange controversy which
has lately raged about Mrs. Eddyâ to
the belief of her intimates in the faith
that she is immortalâ to the belief of
certain opponents -that she is subject
to "ossification and mental assassina
tion"; that she is already in a measure
dead.
Among Mrs. Eddy's pupils are many
who have failed to adhere to the strict
lines of Christian Science. They prac
ticed and taught hypnotism and "mind
cure" instead of healing through faith
in God. These either voluntarily sepa
rated themselves or fell into disrepute
with the governing body of Forty First
Pupils in whom all authority for the
faith was vested, and they became out
casts from Christian Science. Many of
them, it was claimed, had no other pur
pose than that of making money. While
Mrs. Eddy has finally permitted her
pupils to receive money for instruction,
it was long against her rulings. Â
Many of these people have made spe
cial claims for themselves, and gath
ered followers about them. Most of
tW-se, naturally, are not friendly to the
Christian Science powers, and espe
cially to the discoverer of the belief.

To guard against these people â
though Mrs. Eddy herself expressly dis
claims the need or efficacy of such as
sistance â the faithful surround the
Mother of Christian Science with a
body-guard of noble thoughts. To pro
long her life, as we should say; to ward
off, in the Christian Science phrase,
those visible traces of lengthening
years that are due not to nature's
changes, but to malign designs of men
tal malpractitioners, this great leader,
a^.s;.iled by those who have soiled the
faith she has revealed to the world, is
guarded by friends, whose white
thoughts, pure and undefiled by day.
whose loving dreams by night, form a
thick veil born of God's spirit to shield

When Mrs. Eddy was told of the
growing sin of thieving among women,
and asked what influence would cure

as she had i several times done before,
that the . mere mention 1 of evil things

to do anything for a long time until I
am rid of it."
Mrs. Eddy herself was healed befor*
she healed others. Her own cure led
to her discovery of the doctrine she haa
given to the world.
These teachings were for years ac
companied by wonderful cures that led
to all sorts of confusion in the minda
of the public.
Two oi these cures have been recently
related by Judge S. F. Hanna, editor of
the Christian Science Journal, in a,
secular magazine.
In 1870, when Mrs. Eddy was visiting:
in Chelsea, Mass., a cripple, distorted
and strapped to crutches, stopped at tha
door.
Mrs. Eddy gave him money. Not long
after her hostess came across a smart
looking peddler in whom, to heramaze
ment, she recognized the same man
who was apparently donmed to a living
death. He explained that immediately
after calling at her door his sufferings
had become so great that he had to lie
down at a near-by house. In an hour
ail changed as L-<- a miracle, and he was
entirely cured.
Alterward the former hostess asked
Mrs. Eddy if she thought such a man
could be healed. Mrs. Eddy answered:
"I do believe that he was restored to
health." In explanation she said later
that when she saw the man her heart
gushed with unspeakable prayer and
pity, and after that she thought noth
ing more of him until she heard of his
cure.
Early in her experience, in 1567, an
escaped lunatic rushed into her room,
seized a chair and raised it to. dash at
her. She looked quietly at him and
spoke to him. The man dropped the
chair, exclaiming. "Are you from
there?" pointing upward, and in a mo
ment was kneeling. When he spoke
again hf> said a terrible weight had
disappeared from his head. Mrs. Eddy
found he was talented and educated
and a son of a wealthy Beacon-street
family. A couple of years later the
same man called to tell her of his life.
He had taken his place again and was
a successful man with a lovely wife and
children.
"A< the present rate of Increase iT be
lieve that in fifty years, aye, less,
â Christian Sciei.ce will be the dominant
religious belief in the world; that it will
have more adherfents than any other

"Why are so many attracted to it?"
Then Mrs. Eddy gave proof of the
practical side of her character.
"My dear." she said, "''hey have re
ceived a great gift. They believe be
cause they know. They themselves
have been healed and have personal
knowledge of the power <>f God as
demonstrated by Christian Science.

cent years were those of Alexandria
and Paris. In both cases the attack
[led over the defense, notwith
standing that the fortifications of both.
were immensely strong and up
to-date in every particular. However,
there were extenuating circumstances
in each case which accounted for the
premature success of the enemy.
The contest at Alexandria was short
but decisive. Within ten hours the
British fleet, under Admiral Seymour,
had effectually silenced every gun on
the shore. Ten thousand shell and
solid shot were poured in on the thor
oughly frightened Egyptians, and a
complete evacuation of the forts was
the result. Yet very little execution
was done by this veritable hail of iron.
: â¢ the great parapets of sand, which
protected the batteries, rendered harm
less the huge thirteen-inch projectiles,
and it was only because of the havoc
caused by the fragments of shells
which flew around everywhere and ac
complished a frightful slaughter among
the gallant adherents of Arabi Pasha,
joined to a knowledge that their want
tit accuracy in aiming left the fleet
practically unharmed, that . the de
fenses were so speedily relinquished to
the British admiral.
As every one knows, the guns were
mostly all spiked or blown to pieces by
a landing party of marines, but outside
of the forts themselves, the destruction
was very small, for the presence of
friends as well as foes in the city for
bade an extensive shelling of any but
the recognized native quarter, yet suf
ficient damage was done by the incen
diary shells to start a fire that almost
destroyed the entire town. In this en
gagement the enormous power of the
eighty-one ton guns, the projectiles of
which weigh over 1700 pounds, Was
amply demonstrated; but it was also
made evident that the quickly thrown
up and inexpensive embankments of
sand form an invulnerable defense
against even these terrible weapons.

COLONEL EVAN MILES.
ON THE WAY TO THE FRONTâ GETTING THE ARTILLERY ON BOARD THE TRAIN,
SAN FRANCISCO.
The most iateresting and exciting
episode during this lons siege was the
ferocious attempt made by the Span
iards toward the close, when they
strained every nerve ,to dismay and
overcome the already exhausted but
still unflinching garrison. More than
lo 000 troops and 170 pieces of ordnance
of large caliber were at the disposal of
the Spanish general, and an 1 ingenious
type ot floating batteries, strongly re
sembling the famous "cheese-boxes on
rafts" of the late war had been de
vised by the dons, who expected great
things of them in the meditated as
sault.
The numbers of the opposing forces
were ludicrously disproportionate; be
sides the above mentioned troops and
suns the Spanish possessed nine line of
battle ships, 15 gun or mortar boats,
covered boats sufficient to land nearly
40,000 men, and in addition the 10 float

ing batteries, which consisted of large
vessels, their sides protected by a
banking of timber seven feet thick and
the dfoks ana guns screened with a
slanting roof of shot proof material.
To this gigantic armament the defense
could only oppose some 7000 rapn, many
of them sick or wounded, and all re
duced to scanty rations for many
months past, ammunition was limited
and the cannon even then were anti
quated.
On the Bth of September, 1782, fire
was opened on the fortress, at a pre
concerted signal, by the entire strength
of the Spanish artillery, both on land
and alloat. The "floating batteries"
were moored within half range and
proved indeed invulnerable to shot and
shell, which lasted all night and day,
until late on the 12th. On that day the
garrisc-n. unable to make any impres
sion on the fleet, whose efforts were be
ginning to Rive the small force of de
fenders considerable trouble and in
convenience, conceived the brilliant
idea of loading their guns with red-hot
shot and burning shells, which though
of little or no penetrating p"ower,
turned out to be very effective against
the wooden sides of the , battle ships
and gun boats; \ in fact within a . very
few hours every one of the 'floating
batteries lay perfectly quiescent on the
â  water, a useless mass of burning
hulks. â¢ ' . ,ââ 'â ..
The endeavors and energy of the de
fenders finally prevailed over the vast 5
numerical superiority of their oppon
ents, and on the 14th of the. month 1 the
desperately conducted ' ' attack was
given up and the Spanish troops re
tired to their lines, / severely crippled
by the enormous losses they had suf
fered, winter quarters ; were taken up,
the bombardment practically aban
doned and peace was', declared on the
2d of February .following. 3. Thus ended
the most memorable siege that can be
found in the pages; of history; remark
able for many reasons but most of all
far the small loss of life among the de
fenders who, during the - three :- years
and a half that the investment lasted
lost in all but 500 men, whilst- they in
flicted on the enemy ; a total loss 'of
several thousands of lives. â  â â -:
To return to our story, it is evident
â¢ that Havana, not enjoying the admit
ted impregnability of Gibraltar, nor. yet
possessing the magnificent defenses
tnat were the ..boast of , Paris, is more
comparable to Alexandria,'; which | simi
larity is indeed further borne out by
the resemblance between the climates
and strategical positions of the two
cities- and, though Havana is lacking
in quantity to equal the Egyptian bat
teries the deficiency may perhaps be
compensated for by the more modern
quality of the guns and a superior class
of gunners. 1 - This : last desideratum is
a most- important one,, for it is indisput
able that, with good guns . and well
trained men behind them, even though
the number 'of both leave much' to be
desired, and the fortifications be any
thing but invulnerable, any fort ought
to give a good account of itself against,
even greatly superior odds, for a short:
time, "at least.
With the improvements of late years
in range-finding instruments, and the
enormously increased- destructive range
of high-power guns, the advantage is
all in favor of a stationary fort, from
which distances are merely a matter
of momentary calculation and direc
tions easily observed, as opposed to a
constantly moving snip, on board
which distance observations are prac
tically a matter of trial, while the roll
ing of the sea constantly interferes
with correct laving!"
Especially is this the case in any kind
of a heavy sea; but once let the guns
of a fleet be properly trained on the
fort, and a couple of good shots made;
and it will take a most powerful set
of fortifications to resist annihilation,
for one the range is definitely obtain
ed the pitching and tossing of the ship
as well as its capability of constant
motion, altering both speed and direc
tion, combine to form a great element
of security; whereas the fort is now
a fixed and immovable target.
The capture of the Havana, there
fore, would not only be an important
strategic movement, but also one easy
of accomplishment, except in the event
of the presence of a large Spanish
squadron in the immediate vicinity of
the harbor, since there is no reason to
fear the power of the guns of Morro
Castle in a prolonged bombardment.
The capture of Havana in 1762 by the;
combined English and American forces
was a notable event.
The cause of the war with Spain in
1762 was the treaty between the Bour
bon princes -then reigning in France
and Spain, which they called the
"Family Compact," to support each
others' thrones. Lpuia^^^s at war
with England, and was so near the
end of his resources that his tottering
throne needed 1 the help of Spain, and
Charles 111, who then ruled the Dons,
was incensed with England because of
an insult given him when: he had been
King of Naples. The Spanish King
made an attempt to keep the compact
secret until the immense treasure col
lected at Havana could be transported
to Spain, but the British Premier, Pitt,
learned of the compact and planned an
immediate war in order to intercept the
richly laden Spanish fleet on i^ way
from the Indies. Pitt was balfffed in
this design by the coming- to the throne
of George 111, who wished for peace.
But later war was found inevitable,
and Pitt's plan of an armed expedition
to Havana was adopted by the new
Minister Bute, though it was too late
now to catch the treasure ships.
The details of the expedition were
suggested by Admiral â¢ Knowles and
the plan was submitted by the Duke oÂ£
Cumberland to the Government, which
allowed him to nominate the leader.
He chose his friend and pupil, Lord
Albemarle, who had fought by his side
in many battles. The expedition con
sisted of 200 .vessels, one-fifth of which
were men-of-war, and 14,000 men, of
which number 11,000 were classed as
effective. They sailed on the sth of
March. 1762, and did not reach Havana
until June 6. They landed the next
day between the forts of Bocanao and
Coximar, within an hour and without

only 4600 regulars, but their entire
force was over 27,000. So, with the
strong fortifications, they . had very
much the advantage.

later re-enforced M" the arrival from
New York of a body of colonial sol
diers, under General Phineas Lyman.
They consisted of '.00 men Trom the
Jerseys, son from New York and 1000
from Connecticut, under the leadership
of the famous Revolutionary hero,
Israel Putnam. The transport in which
Colonel Putnam with 500 of his men
embarked was wrecked on a craggy
beach. The weather was so tempestu
oua that the other vessels could give
no aid, but the wrecked men managed
to get a line to shore, and by means of
this and of rafts they escaped from the
death that had so closely threatened
them. Putnam toc-k up an entrenched
position as soon as all were landed, and
later the transports came and bore
them to the main army.
The Spaniards prepared for defense
by stretching a strong boom across the
harbor hiouth and sinking large ships
as obstructio.-ns. Their 9000 sailors and
marines were very active in assisting
the land forces by erecting and man
ning batteries.
The first move that the Spanish made
in the game was a charge by 1000 cav

upon the invaders in such formidable
array that our men were for a while
alarmed, but when the Spaniards
reached a hundred .yards from their
opponents their hearts failed them and
finding that a bluff was utterly inef
fectual on the Anglo-Saxons they
turned and rode back to Havana, be
hind the shelter of their fortifications.
There was such a deficiency of good
water that many of the besiegers died
in the agonies of thirst; many more fell
victims of fever; there was but three or
four hours of the fever to take a soldier
from strong manhood to death; hun
dreds of carcases floated on the ocean.
At the time when the distress was
most disheartening "'the arrival of the
provincial troops in 'perfect health was
a most important contribution toward
the completion of the works and the
reduction of Havana, but these North
Americans, in their turn, suffered so
much from sickness that very few ever
found their way home again.
The incident of the siege that made
the leaders of the expedition most trem
ble for the success of their undertak
ing was the getting afire of their bat
teries. There was such a scarcity of
both water and earth that the flamea
could not be extinguished and one wing
of their fortifications was destroyed. It

THE AMBASSADORS PIGEONS
AS THE EMBASSfIDOR'S COAT FELL fIWAY IT EXPOSED fl CAGE CONTAINING FOUR PIGEONS.

his tent and gazed down upon the famous city of
Baalbek, seeing it now for the first time. Tho
niglmbefore he had encamped on the heights to
JL the south of Baalbek, and had sent forward to
that city messengers to the prince, carrying
greetings and acquainting him with the fact that
an embassy from tho governor of Damascus awaited per
mission to enter the gates. The sun had not yet risen, but
the Bplen'dor in the East lighting the sky with wondrous
colorings of gold" and crimson and green announced the
speedy coming- of that god which many of the inhabitants
of Baalbek still worshiped."
The temples and palaces of the city took their tints
from the flaming sky, and Haztddin, the ambassador,
thought he had never seen anything so beautiful, notwith
standing the eulogy Mahomet himself had pronounced
upon his own metropolis of Damascus. â¢-'â -_, " r
The great city lay in silence, but the moment the rim
of the sun appeared above the horizon the silence was
broken by a faint sound of chanting from that ornate
temple", Seemingly of carven ivory, which had bestowed
upon the 'city its Greek name of. Ileliopolis. The Temple of
the Sun towered over all other buildings in the place and.
as if the day god claimed his own, the rising sun shot his
first "rays upon this edifice, striking from it instantly all
color, leaving its -rows of pillars a dazzling white, as if
they were fashioned from the pure snows or distant
Lebanon.
â¢ The sun' seemed a mainspring of activity, as well as
an object of adoration, for before it had been many min
utes above the horizon the ambassador saw emerging
from 'the newly opened gate the mounted convoy that was
to act as his escort into the city; so-, turning, he gave
a quick -command which speedily leveled the tents artd
brought his retinue Into line to receive their hosts.
The officer sent by the Prince of Baalbek to welcome
the .ambassador, and conduct him into me city, greeted
the visitor with that deferential ceremony so beloved of
the Eastern people, and together they Journeyed down the
hill to the gates, the followers of the one mingling frater
nally with the followers of the other. As if the deities
of 'the wonderful temples they were approaching wished
to show the futility of man's foresight, a thoughtless
remark made by one of the least in the ambassador's
retinue, made to one of the least who followed the Baal
bek general, wrought ruin to one empire and saved
another from disaster.
A mule driver from Baalbek said to one of his lowly
profession from Damascus that the animals of the north
ern city seemed of superior breed to those of the southern.
Then the Damascus man, his civic pride disturbed by
the slighting remark, replied haughtily that if the mules
of Baalbek had endured such hardships as those of
Damascus, journeying for a month without rest through
a rugged mountain country, they would perhaps look' in no
better condition than those the speaker then drove.
"Our mules were as sleek as yours a month ago when
â¢we left Damascus." As Baalbek is but thirty-one miles
north of Damascus the muleteer of the former place mar
veled that so long a time had been spent on the journey,
and he asked his fellow why they had wandered among
the mountains.
The other could but answer that so it was, and he
knew no reason for it, and with this the man of Baalbek
had to content himself. And so the tale went from mouth
to ear of the Baalbek men until it reached the general
himself. He thought little of it for the moment, but
turning to the ambassador said, having nothing else
STORIES OF EXPERT TELEGRAPHERS
JUST at present the air Is sur
charged with a great deal of elec
trical talk apropos of the tourna
ment of telegraphers to be held
in New York at the Madison
Sqi;::i" j&arden during the month
of May iind T-the auspices of the New
York BJle ;â â  al Society.
Roughly, the tournament Is divided
into tsvo b\% classes, the sending
events and the receiving events, the
former being much the more important.
Competitors in the sending events send
off as many words as they possibly
can during a period of rive minutes.
Those in the receiving events "take"
as many words as possible sent to them
during a period of thirty minutes. In
the tournament of 1593 some surprising
records were made.
F. J. Kihm of the Brooklyn Eagle
staff, C. D. White of the Associated
Press and Frank Catlin tied at 248
words, though White had a few errors
against him at the finish. Gibson made
a record of 246 words, Frank English
239 and Hinnant 236.
All these men are expected to com
pete again this year, and it is quite
possible that last year's best record
may be bettered by one of them. The
prize in each class will be $100 for first
and $75 for second place. Special events
will be a sending contest, limited to
female operators, and a code contest
for senders and receivers, unknown
matter in the Phillips code to be han
dled.
The expert telegrapher is as far re
moved from the ordinary operator as is
the orator from the stammering school
boy. In sending his dispatches all the
mechanical side of his craft seems to
be eliminated; he loses all conscious
to say: _
"How long has It taken you from Damascus to
Baalbek?"
"Then the ambassador answered:
"We have done the journey in three days; it might
have taken us but two, or perhaps it could have been
.accomplished in one, but, there being no necessity for
speed, we traveled leisurely."
Then the general, remaining silent, Bald to himself;
"Which has lied â rumor or the ambassador?"
He cast his eyes over the animals the ambassador had
brought with him. and saw that they indeed showed signs
of fatigue, and perhaps of irregular and improper food.
Prince Ismael himself received Haziddin, ambassador
of Omar, Governor of Damascus, at the gates of Baalbek,
and the pomp and splendor of that reception was worthy
of him who guve it, but the general found opportunity to
whisper in the ear of the prince:
"The ambassador says he was but three days coming,
but a follower of his told a follower of mine that they
have bren a month on the road, wandering among the
mountains."
Suspicion fs ever latent In the eastern mind, and the
prince was quick to see a possible meaning- for this wan
dering among the mountains. It might well be that the
party was seeking a route at once ettsy and unknown by
which warriors from Damascus might fall upon BaalbeK,
yet, if this were the case, why did not the explorers
return directly to Damascus rather than venture within
the walls of Baalbek? It seemed to Prince Ismael that
this would have been the more crafty method to pursue,
for, as it was, unless messengers had returned to Damas
cus to report the result of their mountain excursion, he had
the whole party practically prisoners within the walls of
his city, and he could easily waylay any envoy sent by the
amha-SP.iilor to his chief in Damascus.
The prince, however, showed nothing In his manner of
what was passing through his mind, but at the last mo
ment he changed the programme he had laid out for the
reception of the ambassador. Preparation had been mad.a
for a great public breakfast, for Haziddin was famed
throughout the East, not only as a diplomatist, but also
as physician and a man of science.
The prince now gave orders that his officers were to
entertain the retinue of the ambassador at the public
breakfast, while he bestowed upon the ambassador the
exceptional honor of asking him to his private table, thus
giving Haziddin of Damascus no opportunity to confer
with his followers after they had entered tne gates of
Baalbek.
It was impossible for Haziddin to demur, so he could
but bow low and accept the hospitality which might at
that moment be most unwelcome, as indeed It was. The
prince's manner was so genial and friendly that the
physician, Haziddin, soon saw ho had an easy man to deal
with, and he suspected no sinister motive beneath the
cordiality of the prince.
The rod wine of Lebanon is strong, and his highness,
Ismael. pressed if upon his gurst, urging that his three
days' journey had been fatiguing. The ambassador had
asked that his own servant might wait upon him, but the
prince would not hrar of it, and said that none should
serve him who were not themselves among the first nobles
in Baalbek,
"You represent Omar, Governor of Damascus, son of
King Ayoub, and as such I receive you on terms of
equality with myself."
The ambassador, at first nonplused with a lavishness
that was most unusual, gradually overcame his diffidence
and became warm with the wine, and so failed to notice
that the prince himself remained cool and drank sparingly.
At last the head of Haziddin sank on his Dreast, and he
reclined at full length on the couch he occupied, falling
into a drunken stupor, for indeed he was deeply fatigued,

simultaneously. It is the same in the !
matter of receiving. In reading a page <
of print the reader never stops to sep- ',
arate the sentences into words and the
words into letters. He does not spell.
The shape of the word is enough. It Ik
so with the expert operator. The gen- j
era I sound of the clicks is all that is j
necessary.
The writer remembers once talking !
with a telegrapher at a time when his
whole attention was absorbed by what
I was saying:. For over ten minutes
an instrument had bfÂ»en clicking away
near at hand. Suddenly my friend
wheeled sharply about and went to the
key. lie had heard his name in the
clicks of the instrument. To him it
j could not have been plainer than it
I some one had shouted it in his ear.
Another curious fact is style in tele
graphing. The manner of the clicks

I operator to detect at once variations in
the sendings. The writer has seen
cases of this in the Western Union of

i to telegraph to each other by the hour

One of these men â his name was

up in an Indian row and. according to
report, was killed. Five years later

Chicago called up, asking who was

"Sturgis, is this you? We heard that
you had been killed." And Sturgis it
was, sure enough. Just what it is
that gives this style to operators, and
precisely what the style* itself may bÂ«,
cannot be very clearly explained, but
telegraphers have* their styles for all
that, just as writers do, and they can
be detected thereby.
But the expert, or even the average
operator, is not confined to his key in
the matter of sending messages. Two
operators can talk to each other by
the mere touch of their fingers in the
dark, or, if needs be, can communicate
to each other in a crowd, unnoticed,
by the same method.
There is a story of Edison â the wiz
ard â that is well worth repeating here.
Edison was a marvelous operator in his
younger days and at one time managed
to transmit his messages even when
his wires had been broken. He was
the agent in a railway station located
upon one side of the Ohio-; the next sta
tion was on the other bank of the river
and also in a railway office. On the day
that the wires parted all communica
tion .was cut off until Edison got
aboard a switch engine that was stand
ing at the depot and began calling up
the other side by means of the engine's
whistle. The other c.-perator understood
at length, and during almost the entire
day the two engines were hoarsely
whistlin? messages at each other.
Homer sometimes nods, and even the
expert operator can make mistakes. C.
S. Lawton, a sometime employe in the
Western Union offices, tells the follow
ing amusing anecdote on himself. He
was receiving a dispatch from Albany,
in which the sender was not over care
and had spent the night before sleepless.
As his cloak fell away from him, it left exposed a
email wicker cage attached to his girdle, containing four
pigeons, closely huddled, for the cage was barely large
enough to hold them, and here the prince saw the am
bassador's swift messengers to Damascus. Let loose from
the walls of Baalbek, and flying direct, the tidings would,
in a few hours, be in the hands of the Governor of Damas
cus. ITuaiddin t hen > was spy as well as ambassador. The
prince also possessed carrier pigeons, and used them as a
means of communication between his armies at Tripoli
and at Antioch, so he was -not ignorant of their con
sequence.
The fact that the ambassador himself carried this
email cage under his cloak attached to his girdle showeu
the great Importance that was attached to these winged
messengers, otherwise Haziddln would have entrusted
them to one of his subordinates.
"Bring me," whispered the prince to his general, four
of my own pigeons. Do not disturb the thongs attached
to the girdle when you open the cage, but take the am
bassador's pigeons out and substitute four of my own.
Keep these pig. ons of Damascus separate from ours; we
may yet have use for them in communicating with the
Governor of Damascus."
The general, quick to see the scheme which was in the
prince's mind, brought loud Baa.lbek pigeons. Identical with
the others in size and color. He brought with him also
a 'cage into which the Damascus pigeons were put, and
thus the transfer was made without the knowledge of the
slumbering ambassador. His cloak was arranged about
him so that it concealed the cage attached to the girdle,
and then the ambassador's own servants were sent for,
and he was confided to their care.
When Haziddin awoke he "found himself In a sumptu
ous room, of the palace. But he had a hazy remembrance
of the latter part of the meal with the prince, and hl3
first thought went with a thrill of fear toward the cage
which had been under his cloak; finding, however, that
this was intact, he was much relieved in his mind, and
could but hope that In his cups he had not babbled any
thing of his mission which might arouse suspicion in the
mind of the prince.
His first meeting with the ruler of Baalbek after the
breakfast they had had together, set all doubts finally at
rest, because the prince received him with a friendship
which was unmistakable. The physician apologized for
being overcome by the potency of the wine, and pleaded
that he had hitherto been unused to liquor of such
strength. The prince waved away all. reference to the
subject, saying that he himself had succumbed on the
same occasion, and had but slight recollection of what had
passed between them.
Ismael assigned to the ambassador one of the palaces
near the Pantheon, and Haziddin found himself free to
come and go as he pleased, without espionage or restric
tion. He speedily learned that one of the armies of Baal
bek was at the north near Antioch, the other to the west
at Tripoli, leaving the great city practically unprotected,
and this unprecedented state of affairs, jumping so coin
cident with the designs of his master, that he hastened
to communicate the intelligence. He wrote r
"If Baalbek is immediately attacked, It cannot
be protected. Half of the army Is at the" shore of
the Mediterranean near Tripoli, the other half is
north at Antioch. The prince has no suspicion. If '
you conceal the main body of your army behind the
hills to the south of Baalbek, and come on yourself
with a small retinue, sending notice to the prince
of your arrival, he will likely himself come put to
the gates to meet you, and having secured his
person, while I with my followers hold the open
gates, you can march into Baalbek unmolested.

Lawton took the address as follows:
"Dr. A. Wing, room car agent, central
depot, New York." The dispatch came
back with tho marginal report that
there was no such person at the address
named.
The operator at Albany was called
up and explanations followed, in con
sequence of which the address was cor
rectly changed to drawing room car
agent, central depot. But even a more
absurd mistake was one made in the
same offices when a wire was received
for "James W. Gilles, pie clerk, Brook
lyn nasty yard." This was afterward
amended to read "James W. Gillespie,
clerk, Brooklyn Navy Yard."
The expert telegrapher's great chance
comes at the time of national conven
tions and Presidential elections. Speed
ltke lightning variety is then a requi
site of his every movement. During the.
last Republican convention Frank J.
Kihm, press operator of the Brooklyn
Eagle staff, covered himself and his
paper with glory, and established a
speed record which will long remain
unbroken. Kihm had planned far this
feat weeks ahead by learning to ope
rate a linotype. At the time of the nom
ination Kihm placed himself at the
linotype, his sounder at his elbow. As
the sounder began to click the news
from Chicago Kihm "received" the
message and ran it off on the linotype.
The first part of the speech was in the
newspaper foTms ready for printing
before the speech itself was ended, and
the paper, with a verbatim report of
the speech, was being sold upon the
streets of Brooklyn before the audience
in the convention hall of Chicago had
ceased its applause.

the roof of his palace, his gaze turning now westward,
nOV The r third r nigh! after the second message had been
sent the ambassador paced the long, level promenade of
his roof, ever questioning the south. A full moon slwne
down on the silent city; c and in that clear air -the .plain.,
outside the walls and the nearer hills were distinctly
visible, as if it were daylight. There was no sign of an
approaching army. Baalbek lay like a city of the dead,
the splendid architecture. of Its countless temples gleam
ing ghostlike, cold, white and unreal in the pure reful
gence of the moon. , , Â --
Occasionally .the ambassador paused In his walk and
leaned on the pirapet. He had become vaguely uneasy,
wondering why Damascus delayed, and there crept over
him that sensatffTn of dumb fear which comes to a man in
the middle of tli* night, and leaves him with the breaking
of day. He realized keenly the extreme peril of his own
position impri&ned, and at the mercy of his enemy,
should his treachery be discovered. And now as he leaned
over the parapet in the breathless stillness, his alert ear
missed an accustomed murmur of the night. ..Baalbek was:
lulled to sleep by the ever present â¢ tinkle of running
water the most delicious sound that can soothe an Eastern
ear, accustomed as it Is to the echoless silence of the arid,
rainless desert. . â¢â¢' ' â  â¢â¢'
'The little river which entered Baalbek first flowed past
the palace of the prince, then to the homes of the nobles
and the priests, meandering through every street and lane
until it came to the baths left by the Romans,
whence it flowed through the poorer quarters, and at
last disappeared under the outer wall. It might be termed
a liquid guide to Baalbek, for the stranger leaving the
palace and following its current would be led past every
temple and residence in the city. It was the limpid. thread
of life running through the veins of the town, and without
It Baalbek could not have existed.
As the ambassador leaned over the parapet wondering
whether It was his imagination which made this night
seem more still than all that had gone before since he
came to the city, he suddenly became aware that what he
missed was the purling trickle of the water. Peering over
the wall of his house, and gazing downward on the moonlit
street, he saw no reflecting glitter of the current, and
realized with a leap of the heart that the stream had
run dry.
The ambassador was quick to understand the meaning
of this sudden drying of the stream. Notwithstanding his
vigilance, the soldiers of Damascus had stolen upon thÂ«
city, unperceived by him. and had already diverted the
water course. Instantly his thoughts turned toward his
own escape. In the morning the fact of the Invasion would
be revealed, and his life would lie at the mercy of an exas
perated ruler. To flee from Baalbek in the night he knew
to be no-easy task, all the gates were closed, and not one
of them would be. opened before daybreak, except through
the intervention of the prince himself. To spring from
even the lowest part of the wall would mean Instant death.
In this extremity the natural ingenuity of the man came
to his rescue. That which gave him warning would also
provide an avenue of safety.
The stream, conveyed to the city by a lofty aqueduct,
penetrated the thick walls through a tunnel cut in the
solid stone, just large enough to receive Its volume. The
tunnel being thus left dry, a man could crawl on his hands
and knees through it, and once outside, walk upright on
the top of the viaduct, along the empty bed of the river,
until he reached the spot where the- water had been
diverted and there find his comrades.
.Wasting not a thought on the jeopardy In which ha
left his own followers, thus helplessly imprisoned in Baal
bek, but bent only on his own safety, he left his' house
silently and hurried, deep in the shadow, along the obscure
side of the street. He knew he must avoid the. guards of
the palace, and that done, his path to the invading army
was clear. But before he reached the palace of the prince
there remained for him another stupefying surprise. -..- â â 
â¢ Coming to a broad thoroughfare leading to the square
In which stood the temple of life, he was amazed to see
at his feet, flowing rapidly, the full tide of the stream
shattering into dancing discs of light the reflection of the
full moon on its surface, gurgling swiftly . toward the
fin 113 t*p
' . The fugitive stood motionless and panic-stricken at
the margin of this transparent flood. He knew that his
retreat had been cut off. What had happened? Perhaps
the strong current had swept away the impediment placed
against it by the Invaders, and thus -had resumed its ;
course into the city. Perhapsâ there was little use in
surmising, and the ambassador, recovering in a measure
his self-possession, resolved to see whether or not.it
would lead him to his own palace. â¢ â  .â -â 
Crossing the wide thoroughfare Into the shadow
beyond, he followed it toward the square, keeping his eye
on the stream that flowed in the moonlight. The rivulet
flowed directly across the square to the temple of life;
there, sweeping in a semi-circle half round the huge
building, it resumed; Its straight course. The ambassador
hesitated before crossing the moonlit square, but a
moment's reflection showed him that no suspicion could

temple of life was the only sacred edifice forever open. * . .
i The temple of life consisted of a huge dome, which was
supported by a double circle of pillars, and beneath this
dome had been erected a gigantic marble statue-repre

BIGGEST MOOSE HEAD IN THE WORLD.
THE monarch of all the moose has been. slain. His mas
sive head, adorned by the most magnificent antlers of
which there is any record, now har.gs in the office of
C. F. Periolat, in the Masonic Temple, Chicaeo. It is
valued at $1000.
Some idea of the size of this monster may be obtained by
comparing the spread of the antlers, or the distance across
from outermost tip to outermost tip, with the distance between
the finger tips of a man with outstretched arms. The average
man, by stretching arms and fingers to the utmost, can reach
from 63^ to GSfo inches. The antlers of this monster moose
measure 74 inches across, or C feet 2 inches. The antlers of the
average sized moose measure only 40
inches across.. -: â¢â 'â

Professor James Ward; the ; naturalist,
gives it as his opinion the monster must

.;* In a most perturbed state of mind" the- ambassador
sought his own house, and there wrote his final dispatch
to Damascus. He told of his discovery, of the water tank,
and said that his former advice regarding the divertlg
of the stream was no longer of practical value. ; He/ said
he would investigate further the reservoir under tho
Temple of Life, and discover, if possible, how the water
was discharged. If he succeeded in his quest he would
endeavor, in the case of a long" siege, to set free Baalbek's
store of water, but he reiterated his belief that it was
better to attempt the capture of the city by surprise and
fierce- assault. ThÂ« message that actually went to Damas
cus, carried by the third pigeon, was "again different in
tenor. - â¢ â 
"Come at once," It said, "Baalbek la unprotected,
and the prince has gone on a hunting expedition.
March through the pass of El-ZaM. which is unpro
tected, because it is a longer route. The armies of
Baalbek are at Tripoli and at Antioch, and the city
is without even a garrison. The southern gate will
be open awaiting your coming."
Days passed and the ambassador paced the roof ot
his house, looking in vaJn toward the south. The stream
flowed as usual through the city. Anxiety at the lack
of all tidings from Damascus began to plow furrows in
his brow. He looked careworn and haggard. To tho
kindly inquiries of the prince regarding his health he
replied that there was nothing amiss.
One evening an urgent message came from tha palaca
requesting his attendance there. Tha prince met him with
concern on his brow.
"Have 'you had word from your master, Omar, Gov
ernor of Damascus, since you paj*ted with him?" asked
Ismael.
"I have had no tidings." replied the ambassador,
"A messenger has just come In from Damascus, who. â¢ â¢
says that Omar is in deadly peril. I thought you should â¢.
know this speedily, and so I sent for you." .â¢ â¢ â¢
"Of what nature Is this peril?" asked the amtassadpr;- :
turning pale. *
"The messenger said something of his falling a pris
oner, sorely wounded, in the hands of his enemies."
"Of his enemies?" echoed the ambassador. "He has
many. Whiqh one has been victorious?"
"I have had no particulars, and perhaps the news may. . : ;
not be true," answered the prince soothingly. â -..'.'.
"May I question your messenger?'.' Â: .â 
"Assuredly. He has gone to the Temple of Life to pray;'.'.
for some of mis own kin, who are in danger. Let us go.
there together and find him."
But the messenger had already left the temple' before â¢ââ¢.".
the arrival of his master, and the two found the great ".-..â¢â¢:
place entirely empty. Standing near the edge of the slab
before the mammoth statue, the prince eald: :._â 
"Stand upon that slab facing' the statue, and I will tell
you more faithfully than any messenger whether your
master shall live or die. and when â "
"I am a Moslem," answered Haziddin, "and' pray to
none but Allah." ' . â¢
"In Baalbek," said the prince carelessly, "all religions
are tolerated. Here we l*uve temples for the worship; of
the Roman and the Greek gods, and mosques for the; .'â¢ â¢
Moslems. Here Christian, or the Jew, sun worshiper, or .
Pagan implore their several gods unmolested, and thus
Is Baalbek prosperous. I confess a liking for this Temple
of Life, and come here often. I should, however, warn .
you, that it is the general belief of those who frequent
this place that he who steps upon the marble slab faring
the god courts disaster, unless his heart is as free from
treachery and guile as this stone beneath him is free from
flaw. Perhaps you have heard the rumol\ and therefore
hesitate."
"I have not heard it, heretofore, but having heard it,
do not hesitate." Saying which, the ambassador stepped
upon the stone. Instantly the marble turned under him,
and falling-, ' he clutched its polished surface in vain,
dropping helplessly into the rfeservoir beneath. Th.c air
under his cloak bore him up and kept him from sinking.
The reservoir into wljich he had fallen proved to be
as large as the temple itself, circular in form, as was the
edifice above it. Steps rose from the water in unbroken
rings around it, but even if he could have reached the
edge of the huge tank in which he found himself, ascent
by the steps was impossible, for upon the first three
burned vigorously some chemical .substance, which luridly
illuminated the surface of this subterranean lake. He
was surrounded immediately by water, and beyond that
by rising rings of flame, and he rightly surmised that this
substance was Greek fire, for where it dripped into the
water it still burned, floating on the surface. A moment
later the prince appeared on the upper steps, outside the
flaming circumference. :
"Ambassador," he cried, "I told you that if you stepped
on the marble slab you would be informed truly of the
fate of your master.- I now announce to you that he dies
to-night, being a prisoner in my hands. His army, was
annihilated in the pass of El-Zaid, while he was on his
way to capture this city through your treachery-. In your
last communication to him you said that you would inves
tigate our water storage and learn how it was discharged.
This secret I shall i proceed to put you in possession of,
but before doing so :I beg to tell you that Damascus has
fallen and is in my possession. The reservoir, you will
obsery-e, is emptied by pulling this lever, which 'releases
a trapdoor at the center of the bottom of the tank."
The prince, 'with berth hands on the lever, exerted his
strength and depressed it. Instantly the ambassador felt
the result. First, a small whirlpool became indented in
the placid surface of the water, exactly in the center of
the disc; enlarging its influence-, it grew and grow until
It reached the outer edges of the reservoir, bringing lines
of fire round with it. The ambassador round "himself
floating with increased rapidity, dizzily round ami round.
He cried out in a voice tnat rane out against the stone
ceiling:
"An ambassador's life is sacred, Prince of Baalbek. It
Js contrary to the laws of nations to do me injury, much
less to encompass my death."
"An ambassador is sacred," replied the prince, "but
not a spy. Aside from that, an ambassador's duty is to
precede his master, and that you are about- to do. Tell
him when you meet him the secret of the reservoir of
Baalbek."
This reservoir, now a whirling maelstrom, hurled its
shrieking Victim into its vortex, and then drowned shriek
and man together.
The moose was killed last season by an Indian chief named
Kushetan Tyone, about 275 miles from Yakutat Bay.
H. H. Cross, the animal painter, came from Butte, Mont,
to Chicago to have a look at the head.
"That is undoubtedly the finest moose head In existence."
said Mr. Cross. "I have seen hundreds of moose in Alaska, but
I never saw anything approaching this fellow either in size
or beauty of form. The animal in life must have stood 22^
to 23 hands highâ larger than any horse in existence. He must
have weighed 2500 pounds. A moose weighing 1509 pounds is
considered remarkably large. The average weight is SOO to 900
pounds.
"You will notice that the neck is so short that the animal is
unable to feed from the ground. See
those bristles,' ten Inches long, ori the
neck? They stand erect when he dis
covers the hunter. There are large, open
areas In Southern Alaska where the grass
grows luxuriantly. Tne moose frequent
these' openings during the season when
their antlers are growing to avoid knock-
Ing them against trees and shrubbery,
for the antlers while in the velvet are
exquisitely sensitive. About the middle
of summer the new antlers have com
pleted their growth and the moose re
turn to the forest. A bull moose is very
proud of his antlers. lie will spend a
great deal of time rubbing the velvet oft
on trees and polishing them to the proper
degree. I cannot hazard a guess as to the
age of this big fellow. It la impossible to
tell the age of a moose after he is 10
years old."

THD unfortunate Emperor Maxi
milian of Mexico .was shot March
19, 1866, in accordance with an
edict which he himself had is
sued the previous year. Among
Us most devoted followers was Quar
termaster Edward S. Kerr, who,
through the adverse fortunes of war,
â¢was driven to seek a refuge in this
rlty. He has lived here for more than
thirty years, but his most exciting life's
adventures were while he was trying
to get out of Mexico after the death of
his leader, Maximilian, and the scat
tering of the Austrian soldiers.
Mr. Kerr'i soldierly In appearance
even at, this day, is a man of good tyrth
and education, who was born at Trieste,
Austria, in 1*27. Though at the present
time much broken by age and the
vicissitudes of a life which early prom
ised great prosperity, he recalls with
clearness for a man of 71 years the va
rious events which led to the tragic
death of his beloved Emperor, as well
as the detaUs concerning his own share
in that part of history which treats of
the sojourn of the Austrian army in
Mexico:
"The people â¢ there never showed
proper respect for the Emperor," Mr.
Kerr remarked, indignantly, in his
broken English. "They never accorded
hirhr his royal trtle, but spoke of him al
ways as-- "Maximilian,' the Austrian.
"They also ridiculed his plain man
ner of living 'and djress; for both him
self and the Empress ordinarily wore
the simple, inexpensive costume of mid
(!'â  -class cit'izei>s, and the Empress also
labored faithfully in the schools which
she organized for girls, teaching them
herself with untiring patience day
after day.
"No, I was not with the Emperor at
the time at his final capture. At the
time I wu a prisoner of war."
Mr. Kerr was not with his beloved
Emperor at" the time of his execution
by the Mexicans. He was on an expe
dition designed to release a party of
Austrian soldiers- who were penned up
by the victorious Mexicans in Oaxaca.
the Chabot Observatory are the two i
astronomers who traveled to distant
India and risked so much for the sake
of photographing the corona. They
w-ere . the only American astronomers
who â¢ ventured, many others being de-r
terred .by the fact that the path of
totality was about fifty miles wide and j
situated in the jungle in that part of
India known as the Decc'an, the heart
of the plague and famine district.
The path of totality of the eclipse
previous to the last one was in Japan,
and astronomers the world over were
on the spot to photograph the corona.
But the expedition was a complete fail
ure owing to the cloudy weather;
But members of this last expedition
to India have brought home excellent
and marvelously clear plates and sci
entists believe that when they shall
have had time to make deductions from
them many knotty points will be |
settled.
Professor Campbell and Professor
Bu-ro'k halter did not go to. India as
members of the same expedition.- Pro
fess* r Campbell was sent by 'the Uck
Observatory, the lens for the occasion
having been donated by the late Colonel j
Crocker. Professor Burckhalter of the
Chabot Observatory was able to under
take the eclipse expedition through the
generosity of William M. Pierson of j
this city, who paid all the expenses.
Mr. Pierson Is somewhat of an astrono
mer himself and Is very much delighted
at the success of the expedition. Dr.
Parde^ of Oakland donated an extra
lens, a precaution that was deemed
necessary in event of the other lens
being injured.

contained in addition a novel feature
never before used. This device was of
his own- invention and one upon which
WITH MAXIMILIAN IN HIS LAST STRUGGLE.
The plan was to rescue these men, join
all the scattered Austrians in one
body and with Maximilian at their
head fight their way to the coast and
liberty.
So it was that Mr. Kerr joined the
500 Austrians who determined to free
thoir countrymen penned up in Oaxaea.
The Mexicans, however, discovered the
movement, and President Juarez man
aged to surround the little band with
10,000 troops. Over 200 of the ."00 were
kiiled before they would surrender. The
I survivors were marched off to captiv-
I ity, and among them was Mr. Kerr.
Then began his dreadful experience as
a prisoner in a Mexican fortification.
.Mr. Kerr tells the story as follows:
"After our defeat the Mexican sol
diers bfgan plundering tro living as
well as the dead, and in this way I los:
many mementoes which money could
never replace. I was also forced, by
the soldiers who took immediate
session of me, to change my uniform
for whatever articles of clothing they
chose to discard; and so, instead of the
dress of an Austrian officer, I found
myself wearing a pair of flashed leath
| er breeches, a pair of broken shoes, a
wide sombrero with several dangling
ornaments and a greasy, badly fitting
Jack"t.
'â¢'When we reached our destination
our complaints reached President
Jaurez, whom every one acknowledges
to have been a just, kind-hearted man,
and he commanded the regiment that
effected our capture to bring all arti
cles taken to a certain plac?, where he
assured us we should claim our be-

he has spent years of labor. It proved t
satisfactory beyond his most sanguine !
hopes and as a result he has the only |
plates which give a distinct photograph |
of the inside details of an eclipse and j
the outside corona at the same time, i
He took a great many pictures while
In India and gathered a great deal of |
interesting information about its in- I
habitants.
"I left San Francisco on October 30,"
he said, "and arrived at Bombay De
cember 20. Before I left I had written
to the Secretary of State requesting
him to use his power in getting the
Indian Government to pass my instru- ;
merits without unpacking them. The
American Consul at Bombay informed
me on my arrival that the Government
had passed resolutions permitting the
instruments and personal baggage of I
astronomers to pass through undis- |
turbed and in addition would furnish
them with tents.
'Professor Campbell's camp was four !
miles from Jeur. which is about 240 j
miles from Bombay. 1 located two <
miles further, near the village of i
Wangi. There are dozens of villages in
each district and the Mamiadar, who
is practically the czar of his district, :
called upon me on the day of my ar
rival.
"I had brought with me a package
of seeds, including almost every variety
of vegetable. Through the native cook
that I had brought with me from Bom- i
bay and who spoke a little p:nglish, I
made clear to the Mamiadar the nature
of the seeds. He thanked me pro- j
fusely for the gift and said that if even '<
one variety would grow in that famine
stricken district it would be better than
a present of a hundred thousand dol
lars. .He examined my instruments !
curiously and was especially interested
in the fact that the -little box on legs' j
could make a likeness of himself. I j
took his photograph and gave it to
him, thereby winning his friendship.
"He summoned the two chief men of
the village, called pat Us. one of whom â 
has the civil and the other the criminal
authority. He instructed them to visit
me daily and see that I lacked nothing.
"I had a great deal of difficulty in
fixing up my camp. The native help la
practically useless and all the hard
work devolved on me. Wood is very j
scarce snd is sold by the pound.
â¢I suffered from the intense heat, but
despite that fact every minute of the
twenty-seven days before the eclipse
had to be used getting ready for the
event The only pleasant incidents j
were the daily visits of Mrs. Campbell
and Miss Beans, who accompanied Pro- j
fessor Campbell and made his camp, ,
two miles away, seem like the oasis In â¢
the desert.
"The natives of the little village saw
the pictures of the patils, and every
day "they came begging to have their
own picture taken. I made a number of
blue prints and gave them away. They
! seemed disappointed when I had the
interpreter explain that there was no
magic connected with the taking of a j
picture. In their ignorance and super- ;
stition they regard most ordinary
events as magical manifestations.
"Owing to the number of natives
daily visiting: the camp I was afraid
that something would be carried off
that would handicap or perhaps even
ruin the apparatus. I determined to
hire watchmen and consulted with the
patils. They gravely informed me that i
the only desirable watchmen were |
those of the 'robber caste.' Being rob
bers themselves, none others of their
caste attempt to Mich from places where
their brethren are employed. Odd as it
may seem to us, during the dull sea
! son the Indian robbers make valuable
| watchmen.
"I employed two of this caste who
! lived up to their occupation as watch
' men by sleeping most of the time.
While it is hot all through the day, the
I weather changes every hour during the
i night, and the covering must be ccm
away the earthworks which had been
raised during a previous fight. No dis
tinction was made; all had to work
alike. Ah! How my hands bled with
that shoveling!
"Apart from the hard work, we were
in a continual state of anxiety, for we
never knew at what moment we might
be led out and shot down like curs,
with no chance, in our unarmed condi
tion, for resistance. Our dread of this
fate was not without reason, for a
threatening mob was continually about
our place of confinement at night, and
made a show of numerous great blood
hounds to teach us the uselessness of
attempting escape.
"After our imprisonment that much
discussed promise was made Maximil
ian of 6,000,000 pesetas and the sup
port of several thousand men if he
would relinquish his intention of de
parture, and so he was induced to re
turn, only to find that neither money
nor army awaited him. Instead he
w .s confronted by the Liberal general,
Escobedo of the Carreto, against whose
army he had made the brave defense
at Queretar<>.
"He would have reached Vera Cruz
with the remainder of his body guard
even after his defeat had he not been
betrayed." Kerr continued: "Ah, the
arch traitor. His name was Lopez.
The man whose debts the Emperor had
paid, whom he had raised from the po
sition of a common oflicer of low rank
to a generalship in the body guard of
the Empress. The man he had loaded
with honors and who repaid him by
treachery and consigned him to death!
"The news of Emperor Maximilian's
death added to the uncertainty of our
fate, but after nine months' imprison
ment we were released with the pro
viso that we were to leave Mexico in
something less than two months.
"Though freedom was welcome it
brought new troubles and difficulties;
for we had been without communica
tion with our friends and were with
out money or sufficient clothing in a
country where we were looked upon
by the majority as objectionable char
acters. Finally I succeeded in obtain

changes. The heat radiates rapidly,
and at 6 o'clock in the morning two
weeks before the eclipse the thermome

was 96 degrees in the shade. During
the daytime I had to have a native
constantly hold an umbrella over me,
otherwise I wo-uld have succumbed to
the heat and plague.
"Not being willing to trust to the na

Several thousand people came from
Bombay to view the eclipse, but they

"The sky was unusually bright for

SPAIN'S ARMY.
From an officer of our army we have re
ceived an interesting- statement of Spain s
military strength. On the first of October
last 201 000 troops were reports! to be In
Cuba and Porto Rico, and 37,000 in the
Philippines. Since then reinforcements, a
tew thousand strong, have gone to Cuba,
but tbese have doubtless been far more
than counterbalanced by the losses in
General Blanco" 3 campaigns, while Sena
tor Proctor has re< entlar sut forth the
enormous difference between nominal and
effective strength in Cuba.
For the home strength, or that which
is not employed In the colonies, the sta
tistics furnished us go back to the preced

"Having: no money to spare for pis

to their heels.

consecrate me to God.
"When I was Very little I used to
heartvoiees. They called me. They
spoke my name. "Mary! Mary!" I used
to go to my mother and say: 'Mother,
did you call me? What do you want?'
and she would say, 'No, child, I didn't
call you.' Then I'd go away to play,
but the voices would call again dis
tinctly.
"There was a da" when my cousin,
whom I dearly loved, was playing with
me when she, too, heard the voices. She
said: "Your mother's calling you.
Mary,' and when I didn't go I could
hear them again. But I knew that it
wasn't mother. My cousin didn't know
what to make of my behavior, because
I was always an obedient child. 'Why,
Mary,' she repeated, 'what do you
mean by not going?'
"When she heard it again we went
to my mother and my cousin said:
'Didn't you call Mary?' My mother
asked if I had heard voices and I sail
I did. Then she asked my cousin if
she had heard them, and when she
said 'yes' my mother cried. She talked
to me that night and told me when I
heard them againâ no matter where 1

felt badly. Mother noticed it and
asked me if T had heard the call again.
When I said I was too frightem.l to

with me and told me that next time I
must surely answer and not fear.

Last year there was an accident at
the mills in the canyon. Powder pro
fessionals refer to such disasters as
nature explosions." Strange to
Bay, it occurred after midnight, when
all the operatives were asleep. In a
large building, filled with heavy ma
chinery, were 16,000 pounds of the
strongest kind of black powder, one of
the most dar.rex*ous of explosives
known The site of that structure is
to-day a deep h- le in the ground into
which the water has seeped, forming
a little lake. Of the dense .growth of
redwoods around it nothing remains
but a few trunks, burned almost to the
roots, and a ghostly survival of euca
lyptus. Bitter manroot twines about the
blackened tree stump 3, and across one
of them a rusty bit of twisted iron pipe
lies where it fell, like a meteor from
a molten sky.
The shock roused with terror the
sleeping world for miles arond, and
flung from their beds in a house a half
mile up the mountain side the superin
tendent, his wife and babe. The win
dows of their residence were' shattered.
No one was killed and none knew how
it happened. No one ever knows just
how "premature" explosions occur.

are the result of carelessness. We

EXPIIOSION .OF THE WORKS. !
<
WITHIN a few hours after the accompanying article was put
into type a series of explosions occurred at the powder works,
killing outright eleven men, totally destroying the nitro-glycer
ine storage-house with its contents, wrecking the smokeless
powder buildings and interior powder magazine and shaking
the city of Santa Cruz, some three miles distant, as though by a ter
rible earthquake.
Five explosions occurred in rapid succession, followed by fire,
which spread quickly to the many buildings, burned the dwelling
places of the employes near by and for a time threatened the entire
demolition of the works.
The Naval Reserves were summoned by bugle call and divided
themselves into two squads, one squad to fight the fire, the other to
search for bodies.
All but one of the unfortunate victims wore burned and mutilated
beyond recognition.
Meanwhile along the roadway the wives and children of employes
were hurrying with blanched, tear. stained faces to the scene of death.
The prismatic powder plant escaped by a miracle and there will
be no delay in filling the Government's three million pound order.
Construction of new buildings was at once commenced.
Spontaneous combustion in the nitro-glycerine plant is the sup
posed cause of the disaster; but there is also a rumor that it was the
work of a Spanish emissary, who had managed to elude the vigilance
of the guards and private detectives on duty.
Governor Budd had for some oays strongly urged the appointment
of a large force of United States Deputy Marshals to guard the
Government's property, as the destruction of the works at this time
would be a greater loss than the sinking of a cruiser.

their way when practice is going on.
They had somehow misunderstood or

awaited the touch that would send it

"Velocity and pressure," explained
the superintendent, "are the two main
requisites in proving powder. The Gov
ernment is very specific in its contracts.
It demands that when fired under ser
vice conditions, in the gun for which
it is intended, powder must give to the
projectile a muzzle velocity of at least
a certain number of feet per second
without producing a pressure of more
than a certain number of tons to the
square inch. For modern guns the
velocity required varies from 2000 to
2300 feet in a second, and the pressure
is not allowed to exceed fifteen tons to
the square inch. In some of our guns
of the present day the amount of en
ergy stored up in the powder charge
is so tremendous as to be almost in
credible. The limit of energy upon the
projectile cannot be estimated, so vast
are the possibilities.
"For example, I may cite the Ore
gon's thirteen-inch rifles. Five hun
dred and fifty pounds of powder in
these guns impart to an eleven-hun
dred pound shot a velocity of 2100 feet
per second, and the energy of the pro
jectile is nearly thirty-four thousand
foot tons. This power is sufficient to lift
such a vessel as the Oregon eight feet
out of the water.

of these forms that Lieutenant Jiraun
ersreuther and his clerks are about the
hardest worked of any of the Govern
ment officials, even at the present time,
when they are all working harder than
they have done for many years.
The whole matter is managed in the
most regular, business-like and impar
tial manner imaginable, the only "pre
ferred" persons being veterans of the
Civil War, and men who have served
twelve years in some branch of the
fighting force of the United States, and
it seems as if no possible misconcep
tion or trouble could follow such plain
directions, simply and honestly carried
out, but a day spent as a volunteer aid
to kindly and efficient Lieutenant
Braunersreuther shows one the fallacy
of this idea.

an assistant. "They are bringing their

principal ones in use are composed of
guncotton and nitro-gly'cerine, either
alone or in combination with bodies, the
function of which is to reduce the vio
lence of the action. The component
parts are mixed In the presence of a
liquid which has ;t solvent action upon
the guncotton. A dough-like substance
is the result. This mass is placed in
a prf-ss similar to that used in making
macaroni, from which it emerges
squeezed Into Bat ribbon shape. After
running: it between rollers to obtain the
proper thickness it is cut into gTains
and dried."
In answer to a question thp superin
tendent said that nitroglycerine is not
used in the manufacture of smokeless
powder.
"It is not adapttd for sporting pur
poses, though ;m adm}rable component
of military power, in a Bhotgun its
combustion is not complete and the
funus from it give very violent head
aches to the shooter. Only the finest
of gun-cotton is used, the other ingre
dients being quite small in quantity.
The most of our cotton comes from
Georgia."
"Those screens between the cannon
and the breastworks are electric chro
nographs, one hundred feet apart from
each other and the cannon and they
register the time of the projectile's
flight with absolute accuracy."
"And absolute accuracy is â what?"
"The millionth part of a second."

then the doorway is filled with the am- i
pie and dignified form of the smiling j
lieutenant.
"We have an hour's respite now," he
says. "Would you like to go up to the
paymaster's and see how much Gov
ernment money can change hands in
half an hour?"
We go out thro-ugh the barnlike store
room to the paymaster's quarters, the
drive and veranda in front of which
are already packed with men in work
ing garb. Eacli of them carries in his
hand an oblong bit of pale blue paper.
The side window of Colonel Barry's
office loi.-ks out into a mass of bowery
green, and the front gives a view ol
the quiet, orderly crowd of workers
waiting patiently their different fore
men's orders to "line up." Inside the
office are big shallow boxes covering
the tables and the floor, each full of
small envelopes ol stout manila paper,
sealed and standing bolt upright. On
each of these envelopes is a number, a
name and a statement of cash, and
they are passed, a dozen or so at a
time, by the officer in charge of them
to an officer who stands at the shelf
and hands them to their rightful own
ers.
The department clerk sits on a high
stool and calls a name and a number;
the "gang foreman" stands outside ami
watches that the right man answers to
charcoal is burned â madrono for blast-
Ing and low-grade powders, willow and
alder for better gradesâ the red and
brown coals by superheated steam, a
dellpate operation; the making of wads;
the blending room with its machine like
a merry-go-round, from the compart
ments of which the prisms are sorted
and made into bag sections according
to weight; the house where nitro
glycerine, mixed with acetone to insure
perfect safety, is storedâ all this and
more is kaleidoscoped In my memory,
for each process is wondrously inter
esting in its way.
But there is one impression more
vivid than the others which I shall
think of and shudder at so long as I
live. A great machine at work seems
almost human, but this creature of
iron, fiendish in its power, sullen in its
movement as a lion pacing in dull rage
the confines of its prisonâ this thing
of monster proportions, traveling its
circle like a horrible juggernaut, is
neither beast nor human, nor yet ma
chine. _
"We call it the wheelmill, said Su
perintendent Peyton. "There are four
others on the place, and the men are
blasting rock to make a. bed for two
more, to be placed In a granite house.
Each of these wheels weighs 15.000
pounds; the new ones will weigh 20,000,
solid iron, connected like these by a
short axle and running on an iron bed.
Powder must be thoroughly incorpor
ated. Placed upon this bed the char
coal and saltpeter are ground to the
fin. ness of powder. This becomes high
ly explosive.
"To keep it together and render it
snfe a certain moisture must be main
tained. Should the man at the wheel
neglect his dutyâ should he let the
ponder reach the explosive degree of
dryness â there would be an explosion
sufficient to wreck the place. This ma
chine has killed two men. It is hard
to tell by just what act of carelessness.
One of them may have miscalculated
the time for adding moisture, or In
cleaning this plow which scrapes the
powder from the sides he may have
used a metal instead of wooden instru
ment. It takes very little friction to
cause a spark, and the tiniest of sparks
will do the mischief.
"In black gunpowder, as all the world
knot's, there are three components â
charcoal, sulphur and saltpeter, thÂ«
latter supplying the oxygen producing
the summons; the bit of blue paper,
which is a statement of account and a
receipt previously signed by the work
er, is exchanged for its proper cash
laden envelope, and the procession
moves on, each man that passes out
of s-i^rht the happier for the possession
of two weeks' pay and the "overtime,"
which counts "time and a half, " and
being frequent in these days of hurry,
swells the amount gratifyingly.
In a little more than thirty minutes
by the watch $64,000 is divided among
1140 men. Then the pay-window is
closed, the tired wage disbursers sink
into chairs and wipe their perspiring
brows.
I hurry back to my post of observa
tion and arrive there just in time to
escape the crowd of applicants for work.
They swarm off the ferry-boat and
up the stairs to the office door. The
space outside the separating rail is
packed almost instantly; the doorway
is full of shoving shoulders and eag^r
faces; the landing is a jam of anxious
humanity and the staira groan under
their burden of impatient feet.
The lieutenant advances smiling to
the fray and with a few concise direc
tions evolves something like order out
of this animate* chaos. Half of them
âpoor fellowsâ 'have toilfully traveled
here i'or the purpose of securing blanks
and information which they could have
got at home by the expenditure of 1
cent invested in a postal card.
The directions accompanying the
combustion of- the first two. The com
position of sulphur and saltpeter is
fixed, whereas charcoal is a mixture
of many chemical compounds. An al
most indefinite series of charcoals can
be obtained, from wood to a nearly pure
carbon, each of which, made into pow
der, differs in quickness and energy and
the manner in which that .energy is
manifested. Black and brown powder
are variations of the same thing, the
brown being developed from the black.
"Yes, we ow materials in big quanti
ties here. That load-lined brick tank
over there holds 20,000 gallons of alco
hol. Sulphur by the shipload comes to
us from Japan and Sicily, saltpeter in
hundreds of tons from India."
One woman â such a mite of a woman
she is. to have so much braveryâ earns
her living at the mill.
"Do you ever feel afraid?" I asked,
watching her dtft finders as they
pasted labels to cartridge boxes at the
rate of 1000 a day. She smiled up at
me with blue eyes, her cheeks ilush
blanks are plain and simple enough for
even a child to understand and follow,
but it is astonishing to see into how
intricate a tangle carelessness, or ig
norance, or attempted duplicity, can
snarl the straightforward statements.
Some bring these documents rein
forced by letters from Congressmen and
Senators and others high in authority,
but these "extras" serve no purpose
whatever.
"It is a fair field and no favor here,"
says the lieutenant, "and all this pil
ing up of recommendations is a sheer
waste Of time. We receive and take
account of only these official blanks
properly filled out, and anything else is
waste paper as far as this office is con
cerned."
As if to prove his words a. small,
hard-faced man makes his appearance
at this juncture, elbowing his excited
way through the throng with an im
portance of manner that makes even
the boldest fall away before him as if,
indeed, he were a mounted policeman.
He bears an open letter in his hand,
and with a look of triumphant prido
essays vainly to give It into the keep
ing of the head of the board. It is
written on the executive mansion sta
tionery, and the little man says: "This
is from President McKinley, sir. He
knows me. I would like you to put it
with the application that I filed the
other day," but the lieutenant shakes
his very decided head.
"Not allowed," he answered briefly,
ing at the unusual experience of seeing
a visitor where visitors are not al
lowed.
"Oh, no," she said, simply. "At first
I was, a little. But you get used to it
after a while. My husband is the
gate keeper. An accident? Well, if
it should come we would all go together
â our little boy and ourselves.' 1
A black-eyed lad, no^ pausing in his
work of loading layers of pressed pris-
matic powder, answered my question.
"Afraid?" he repeated cheerfully.
"No. A fellow can't die moro than
once, you know. Besides, you g^t used
fro it and don't think much about get
ting killed when you've handled tne
stuff as long as I have."
The assistant chemist smiled at the
suggestion that a powder mill was a
dangerous place in which to li^e out
one'a life.
"It is more the idea of it than thÂ«
reality," he remarked. "I got used 1o
it after a while."
An old man turned a bearded face to
the light and laughed good naturedly.
"I've worked in this powder "it ill since
the War of the Rebellion broke out,"
said he. "Does that look as though
it were a dangerous calling? I guess
I'll live to see America whip Spain."
In a room where brown powder is
pressed into layers, and its iluÂ«t, rising
thickly, is so inflammable that the
workmen must wear wo iJen pegs in
their shoes to avoid friction, a sturdy
Hibernian showed a set of gleaming
Jeelh in a smile that sent the powder
<lvp f . in flakes from a face the c:>lor of
the layers he was handling.
"Dangerous? Why of course not,"
he assured me, "not half so much as a
sawmill or a limestone quarry, or a
common road, for that matter, for a
man who worked here thirty years waa
killed one day on the way home by a
tall from his horse. But we are care
ful, to be sure: very careful since two
men were blown up in the very cor
ner where you â â  -Ending now, not
wishing to frighten you," he added
kindly.
In the cartridge factory something
had been said about bicycle riding.
"I could never make use of a wheel,"
remarked the superintendent.
'Why not?" I asked.
"Because," said theman who lives, a*
it were, over a volcano of the deadliest
explosives, "I think that bicycles arÂ»
too daneerous."
Which shows that there is everything
in the point of view.
"but a man with a letter like that need
not waste his time waiting for a job
that may never come here at Mare Is
land. It's a kind of civil service up
here, you know, but if you take that
sheet of paper down to the city among:
the politicians you won't need be out
of work long."
And with this crumb of encourage
ment President McKinley's protege de
parts, somewhat humbled, but still
hopeful, while the smile disappears
from the lieutenant's face as he glances
over the next lot of papers handed to
him and then looks the man who
brought them sternly in the eyes.
"The signatures to this trade and
character certificate are forged," he
says quietly, "and you have laid your
self liable to serve a term in San Quen
tin. If I were you â ," but the detected
fraud is already slinking through the
crowd without even an attempt at ex
planation.
Forgery of this kind is common and
there are certain enterprising individu
als in the pretty town of Vallejo who
for two bits or so will fill out certifi
cates galore for utter strangers. One
man, depending on the fact that his
is only one in a crowd of strange faces,
secures his blanks and brings them
bark in the course of half an hour
nicely filled out and signed by parties
in Salt Lake City. Another claims to
have made a trip to Oakland and back,
irrespective of car and boat time-tables,
in an hour's time, and produces the sig
natures of two of Oakland's well-known
business men in proof of his assertion..
Others, like the first culprit men
tioned, bring certificates signed by the
proprietors of the Union Iron Works,
not knowing, as does the board, that
these gentlemen never deviate from
their rule of non-recommendation.

in perfect harmony with Its system.
Our formal application for admission
to that body has already been for
warded. The true American spirit
would be the giving of our services
where those services are most urgently
required, whether the sick and
wounded were our own men or the
brave swldiers sent from other States.
"While it is tru<- the War Department
has said that women nurses will not
be needed in Cuba, the urgent neces
sity for them in that unhealthy coun
try may arise. This is why we pro
pose to be prepared to respond to calls
for help. I have a dozen applications
on file from skilled nurses who are will
ing and anxious to go at the moment
the summons comes. Letters are com
ing to me from all over tne State, ask
ing for information as to the forming
of branches, and volunteering help. To
show how universal the sentiment is
among old and young, in all walks of
life, here is a letter just received:
Dear Chairman of the Red Cross
League and Sanitary Commission
ot California: I want to serve our
nation, but my age will bar me
from enlisting, although I am well
and hearty. It would please me to
enlist under your banner. Respect
fully yours, 11. N. TURNER.

"No movement can be carried on suc
cessfully without perfect system. We
are nut acting hastily nor ill-advisedly,
although we are anxious that arrange
ments for operation should not be de
layed. A circular has been sent out to
1 the leading business men of the com
munity, asking for their advice and co
operation. To-morrow night at 7:30
o'clock, in the California Hotel, a meet
ing will be held to which the public is
cordially invited. An executive com-
I mittee will then be appointed and
1 work commenced in earnest. The
nucleus of a fund, $20, hate been re
ceived from Mrs. William Alvord, presi
dent of the Sanitary Commission dur
ing the War of the Rebellion.
"Should war cease before expenditure
of money is needed, donations Rvill be
returned or disposed of according to 1 the
wishes of the donors. If only a portion
of the fund be used, donors will receive
their regular pro rata.
"Every move that we make shall
first have the approbation of the pub
lic. Without co-operation and good
will we cannot hope to carry on
the work. Every cent received will be
duly accounted for and expended with
wisdom. No salaries will be paid.
"After Monday we shall be provided
with suitable headquarters in a con
venient locality down town, with some
one in attendance.
"The noble work of the Red Cross
League and the service rendered count
less suffering thousands by the United
States Sanitary Commission during the
last war prove that we are undertak
ing no experiment, but banding to
gether from the most loyal and prac
tical of motives, ready to go to the
rescue, if need for rescue arise.
"And it must be women who shall
do this work. Men are at their busi
ness and cannot take the time. The
women of America did their duty at the
first sound of war in '61. They will be
ready to do their duty in '98."
COL. SMEDBERG'S RECOLLECTIONS
OF RED CROSS WORK IN
THE CIVIL WAR
THROUGHOUT the entire war the
services rendered by the Sani
tary Commission in general and
its women in particular were of
inestimable value in saving
lives, alleviating pain, and cheering the
dark hours of loneliness and despair
which thousands of the sick and
wounded experienced.
To this day the boys remember with
grratitude the gentle, efficient attention
of their women nurses, who cheered
them when they were despondent and
tided them through many a crisis by
words ot encouragement and the

! stimulus of sympathetic companion- ;
ship.
I know frrtm experience how it is to |
have such help near when it is needed.
A woman of this noble kind visited me ,
twice a day when I was laid up in ;
! "Washington after the amputation of 'â 
my leg. She was always jolly â had a
i bit of interesting army gossip to re- ;
| late, or news from nay regiment and |
: brigade, and she told it in a breezy ,
â  way that braced a fellows spirits just
to listen. She wouldn't let me give up
to "the blues" if I had wanted to.
One day I heard her cheery iaugh as I
she entered the door, and thinking that i
the sheet was perhaps not as carefully
arranged over my wounded limb as it
should be when a lady visitor was ex
pected, I made an effort to adjust it.
She laughed outright in her hearty way
and said with a reassuring pat on the
coverlid, "Never mind that, my boy.
I've seen men with less cover than that
in Libby Prison." And weak as 1 was
I laughed too.
Mrs. Kicketts was the wife of Gen- '
eral Ricketts of Washington. He was |
wounded at the first battle of Bull ;
Run in '61. taken prisoner and sent to
Richmond with other officers of our
army. As soon as his wife heard of it
she applied for a commission to pass
through the lines. It was granted, and
she joined her husband. She rema ; m-d
there several months and was the only
woman in Libby Prison, doing practi
cally all the nursing for the officers,
and there were many of them there
who were wounded at Bull Run.
They regarded her as not only a min
istering angel, but several angels rolled
into one, and there is no question but
that her presence during that terrible
ordeal saved their lives.
Afterward Mrs. Ricketts returned to
Washington, where she devoted herself
to visiting the regular army men, near
ly all of whom knew her, in the hos
pitals, talking to them, making them
laugh so that they might have faith to
believe they were not going to die after
ail, and doing them good every day of
their lives.
It Is curious what influence the mind
will exert over the body. I remember
a case in point where two officers of the
regular brigade had been injured, one
with what was considered a mortal
wound, a bullet through the lungs; the
other with a flesh wound â what we
used to call a furlough, for a hole in
the arm meant thirty days' leave of
absence at home.
When I visited them the man with
the perforated lungs who couldn't
speak, smiled, and his bright eye show
ed unflinching courage and determina
tion. The othrr was very despondent.
Said the surgeon, "If they continue
in their present frame of mind the
really sick man will recover from sheer
grit and the man who is merely gloomy
will die." And so it proved.
But if a cheery woman had been
there to pull him out of that slough of
despond I believe he would have got
well.
When we came up from Fredericks
burg after the battle of the Wilder
ness, by boat, after being carried
some fifteen miles, the surgeons came
aboard to chop us up. I had already
had my leg taken off, Ifut' I had my
ov.u sanitary commission to look after
me my sister having come on to meet
me.
That fortnight was a busy one at j
Fredericksburg with the Sanitary Com- i
mission, for the battle of Spottsylvania ;
followed soon after. The ambulance
corps had been sent on with the wound- j
ed to Fredericksburg, where they were i
detained if convalescent, or shipped on I
to New York and other places of hos
pital safety if in serious condition, so
the poor fellows who were wounded had
to be sent from the field in army
wagons without springs, and were
worse off than we because they had
had nearly two weeks more of fatigue.
I have seen women writing letters
for men whose arms were shot off. I
have seen them reading home letters to
men with holes in their heads, band
aged so that they could not see â per
haps never could see again.
The presence of these self-sacrificing: |
women in the hospitals was a blessing !
that cannot be overestimated.
COMMODORE SCHLEY
AS
OFFICER AND COOK.
A HIGH officer In the navy recently i
wrote to a relative in this city re
garding Commodore Schley, who is
in command of the flying squadron:
"It Is proof conclusive that the fly-
Ing squadron Is Intended to fight from
the mi>re fact of the appointment of Com
modore Schley as its commander. Schley
would be useless either as an apostle of ]
j peace or a procrastinating warrior. He i
j is a fighter."
That is the general verdict of the navy
i and of all men who know Commodore
j Schley.
"Winfleld Scott Schley is one of the most
interesting personalities of the men in i
command at the front. He is a singular
combination of characteristics. While he :
is known to the outside world as a man
of genuinely bellicose temperament, he is
in his ordinary dealings with men one of j
the most affable and congenial of com- !
panions. In heart he is a Bohemian, with
a love of good fellowship and gastronomy.
He prides himself on his ability to cook,
and possesses a library of works on gas
tronomy that would adorn the home of
i any chef of international fame.
While in San Francisco several years |
ago he was attending a social function,
and, acceding to the importunities of the
ladies present, he delivered an informal i
lecture on the culinary art.
A Marylander by birth and education,
he learned at an early age how duck and
| terrapin should be properly prepared. In
later years he developed the art of cook- |
ing on scientific grounds. â  . I
Here is an incident illustrative of j
Sohley's fighting qualities. In 1891 the
Baltimore, Captain Schley comraandina
was ordered to Valparaiso. The Chilean
[ insurrection was at that time filling
Americans in Chile with great alarm for
the safety of their property. Schley was :
ordered to look after their interests. The |
big, white cruiser In the harbor, flying
the stars and stripes, was an object of j
execration to the Chileans.
It is a matter of international etiquette
that foreign boats are entitled to the right
of way In landing or in leaving the
wharves. This rule of etiquette was sys
tematically and offensively disregarded
by the Chilean boats. The Chileans would
increase or decrease their speed so as to
run across and frequently foul the Balti
more's boats. Such mishaps may have
occasionally happened by accident, but
constant repetition showed them to have
been acts of intention.
The matter was brought to Schley's ,
notice. He immediately wrote to Commo- |
dore Fernando Veil, the Chilean com
mander, informing him of the discourtesy
and also warning him that if the offenses
were not promptly discontinued he â 
(Schley) would instruct his officers to de
cline no controversies of any kind.
The result was that the practice of foul
ing the Baltimore's boats came to an
abrupt end.
Schley won fame In the long four years'
struggle of the rebellion, when he earned â 
the title of commander. Upon the re
organization of the navy at the close of [
the war his rank was reduced to lieuten
ant, from which grade he has steadily ad
vanced until now he is a commodore with '
prospects <>f immediate promotion.
As commander of the flying squadron >
he controls the first fighting fleet of ihe
nation. _____^___^___
WAYS TO CURE
POISON OAK.
ALONG the entire Pacific slope,
from Canada to Mexico, there
grows a particularly poisonous
member of the Rhus family,
commonly* known as poison oak. It
grows everywhere and is such a harm
less looking, rather attractive plant,
that one's first acquaintance is not a
happy one. No place else in the world
is this particular species to be found.
Remedies are as varied as the pa
tients, every sufferer having his own
methc-d of obtaining relief, even, on a
sort of homeopathic plan, eating the
leaves of the plant, sometimes with al
most fatal results.
Many interesting experiments have
been tried with the plant, and the cause
of the utter failure of physicians to
successfully treat the poison is believed
to lie in the fact that the poison has
always been supposed to consist of an
acid, whereas experiment has proved
that the poison is a non-volatile oil.
This would call for an entirely different
treatment from the one ordinarily used.
To some people the plant is perfectly
harmless and to others, even in the
same family, it may become fatal. An
authenticated case of a servant boy is
one in point. He had been engaged in
pulling up the plants which grew
on the grounds around the house.
When he had finished he washed his
hands carefully in hot water and soap
and afterward in vinegar. Then he
took the young son of the house to a
pond to bathe. He held the child by
the arms, rubbing his back carefully
with the bare hand. Three days after
deep ulcers appeared wherever the ser
vant boy's hand had touched the child.
No medication was effective and the
child died.
Dr. Frank says in the Medical Record
that he has been most successful in
treating the poison by handling it ex
actly like any septic wound.
A portion of the skin has absorbed
poison which can be carried to other
portions of the body by the contact of
the patient's hands.
The first essential is cleanliness, a
bath in water with soap. After cooling
applications of antiseptic emulsions to
prevent the spreading of the poison,
such as formaline, lime watÂ°r, glycer

which, had they availed themselves 61
it, the Anglo-Saxons had lost all. But
so firmly did the besiegers hold their
position and so promptly begin to re
pair the breach that the Spaniards
failed to enter this opening for victory.
The guns of Morro Castle were
silenced by the 15th of July. When the
besiegers advanced upon it they found
yawning In front of them an immense
ditch, SO feet deep and 40 feet wide. A
narrow ridge of rock had been left to
save this ditch from the action of the
waves. This ridge was so very narrow
that two men abreast could not cross
it. Along it the miners made a daring
rush and quickly burrowed themselves
into the wall of the castle.
The Spaniards now realizd their con
dition to be desperate. They resolved
on a sortie. At daybreak next morning
25,000 of them climbed the hills and
made three attacks upon our posts.
Our troops, though surprised, stood
their ground resolutely.
General Keppel then charged the dons
and drove them down the hill in con
fusion. Some got to their boats and
many were drowned in trying to reach
Havana. The Spanish loss in this sally
was 485 men. It was in this charge that
the North Americans specially distin
guished themselves. A battalion of
them were in the rush that forced the
dons to take water.
On the 30th of July the mines were
sprung under the right bastion. A part
of the wall fell in. but it was hardly
wide enough to admit one man at a
time. General Keppel ordered the as
sault at once. Lieutenant Forbes led
it. The soldiers swiftly passed in single
file along the ridge and scrambled up
the steep and narrow opening in the
wall. Reaching the top their formation
was prompt and intrepid. The Span
ish had been drawn up to receive them,
but surprised by the resolute courage

All ointments and powders are dis
tinctly injurious, as they prevent the
escape of the poison discharge by form
ing a crust, which causes the ulcers to
eat into the flesh.
The popular remedy, bi-carbonate of
soda, or any alkaline solutio-ri, only
serves to increase the irritation and in
flammation.
Any one either exposed or in danger
of exposure could find almost certain
protection in a hot antiseptic bath.
Carbolic acid, lysol or bichloride of
mercury are easy to use by a non
professional when it is remembered
that all antiseptics are deadly poison
when taken internally.
Bichloride of mercury or corrosive
sublimate comes in small tablets with
accurate directions for use and dry
can be carried in the pocket.
In the German public schools there
are always charts of the poisonous
plants which grow in the region round
about and the children are taken to
the fields and learn the plants to be
avoided. Much suffering is thereby
saved, for there are more fatalities,
particularly among the children, than
would be imagined by one whose at
tention had not been called to . this
matter by statistical reports.

Bowling alleys are being fitted with

Wires can be easily spliced by a new

the passage of the main wire, while the
other jaw has a slotted ear through

Don Luis de Velasco. the Governor of
Morro Castle, gathered a hundred men
in an entrenchment he had made round
his colors. He disdained to call for
quarter, and. receiving a mortal wound,
he fell offering his sword to the con
querors. His heroism was recognized
by both the Spanish and the English.
Lord Albeniarle described him as "a
gallant man" to the Duke of Cumber

was summoned to surrender on the 10th
of August. He proudly refused. At
daybreak on the 11th, at the sign of a
rocket, the batteries opened. At noon
the dons had enough. At 2 o'clock Ha
vana was hung with flags of truce. On
the 12th the terms of capitulation were
settled. The Spaniards in recognition
of their plucky defense were allowed to
march out with military honor.
The booty of the conquerors was im

PRETTY NECKWEAR
Special to The Call.
MEW YORK, April "28.â This Is
certainly to be a necktie sea
son.
"You can be fairly well
dressed with a skirt and a
necktie," is the laconic way a
fashion writer begins an article.
This, while not quite literally true.' is
figuratively so. It is to be presumed that
the wearer of the skirt and necktie made
some simple pretense at a waist, but the
waist was so insignificant that the fash
ion chronicler did not think it worth
while to make a note of it.
If you have an 61d.Â»wais-t you can make
it look very much like .a new one with the
right kind of four -Jo-hand . tie. If you
have no waist .all.- you. can get a very
cheap plain one thai will be. elaborate, af
ter you have put:- the 'tie on-. These four
in-hand ties- arc, of extreme, .size, as you
can Judge w&eb'-ygu' .read t"h'at they are
eight inches ;\s ; itl'e : at the ends'. They nar
row down irii._th.e : :iniddl"e to a mere band.
This band â¢'&!' Carried- -twice around the
neck and the;.erid'g : .:ar.e.:tlien tied in regular
four-in-hand' ifashipii. â  T ,
Below ihekn.o't ends fall to the
waist, v. ;.â  re broaden out in a most
surprising :-w.ay:..'T.6' .- train, these ends in
the. way. they ;stt6u!d.'-go, small fancy pins
are necessary, aYijT this affords an oppor
tunity for the -display of small diamond
fancies. ..; One of" these fancies is a little
clover 'leaf â¢of crystal embedded in a uny
band of dtinipnds. These can be obtained
in the semi-precious terns, which are
quite the fancy this year.
The semi-precious cems are worth a
paragraph. Formerly all stones that were
not diamonds, .rubies, emeralds, pearls
and sapphires, were considered "Imita
tions" and were relegated to the "junk"
counter. Hut this idea has been put aside
as a bigoted and erroneous ope and the
pemi-preeious gem has come into vogue.
It is possible to have a stone which looks
like the real gem, yet in no way imitates
it. For Instance, take the olivine. This
stone is a deep green very much like an
emerald, yet differing from it in opaque
qualities. It is made up in pins for the
neck, hatpins and brooches, but it looks
well in all. The olivine pin is perhaps the
most fashionable for spring, for it is
green, and if there is a color toward
which fancy turns with thoughts of love,
It is green at spring time.
The violet neck ornament is as numer
ous as it is beautiful. You Bee these four
in-hand ties of pure violet satin and you
behold them in all the shades of lavender,
purple, paxme and royal violet.
The violet tie is at its lust in the Ro
man stripes. Roman ties come in many
different colors with the violet predomi
nant. For example. the most fashionable
tie is striped, witli a band of white be
tween two bands of violet; then comes a
pin stripe of green, a broad one of violet;
a tiny one of yellow and another violet
band. With this brilliant conception in
vio-iet ' the tie becomes very gorgeous
when placed- upon the neck. It is fastened
ai each Bide with a tiny violet pin.
1 The "French Maid 1 * bow is another
ful conception, which is distin
guished by Its size. If you want to be
Kure of getting one that is large enough
it Is best to secure a picture of a genuine
French maid. Note the s'ze of the white
lie upon her neck and be governed ac
cordingly. The "French Maid" tie is pat
terned upon this model, and of course to
be very fashionable it must exceed it in
size To make this tie you get a yard of
chiffon, which will cost at least $1 t yard.
You cut it lengthwise in three strips and
eew the strips together very neatly, fas
tening down the raw edges so that they
will not fray, for nothing tears out and
fray? like chiffon.
Upon the end sew a deep ruffle of sun
plaited chiffon, a*d if you want to be
quite regardless of expense, fasten a nar
row ruffle of lace over the chiffon, alter
nate with another chiffon ruffle and so
continue until you have trimmed the
chiffon ends to the depth of an eighth of
a yard Now put your chiffon tie around
neck and tie it into a bie bow under
your chinâ the larger the better. Pull
out the ends of the bow until you have a
large broad effect. You can be assured
that you have a very fashionable tie.
A great many people find it untidy -to
wen- these fancy chiffon ties next to the
neck. The perspiration of the skin BOft
he tie In one wearing, and the result
is that it looks soiled and unfit for -a sec
ond wearing. To avoid this, a white col
lar is worn next to the skin and the chir
fon tie Is then brought over the collar.
This protects the tie and makes it always
look fresh and dainty.
The fashionable colors arc white with
ends of green. Purple with ends of white
is also used and green with purple and
white' ruffles. You can alternate^ the three
colors, purple, green and white, to jour
heart's content and you can. be sure that
you will not go amiss. mini-
Very neat four-in-hand ties of the sum
mer come already tied. Those that are
to be worn with expensive tailor m aae
dresses come with a knot nicely â  tied in
front and with ends hanging to the a Â» st -
At the back there is a hook so .that the
tie can be put on at a moment s notice.
It is sure to look trim. It is .^foiuteij,
impossible to glvefa heavy satin tie that
tailor made appearance which all women
covet, after the first time. The satin*
wrinkled â¢ and the tie is bound to look
mussed. For the spick and span appear
ance nothing exceeds the tied > Ared
hand. With a ribbon or a Roman *tnnea
band or a single piece of satin it_ is all
ferent, but with the lined and satin tie it
is always best to have a made up knot.
Of course there is always an. extreme
of fashion and one of these is the but
terfly chiffon bow. This is, as its name
Implies, a small bow. It consists of a
little knot with ends of chiffon. This Is
difficult to describe unless -; you have
seen it. but to make it you get a very,

fashioned for white collars. All of
them have buttonholes front and back
and the necks have simple bands upon
them. You Will not lino a shirt

it Even the velvet shirt waist is fitted
with a linen band with button-holes front
and back for the collar. These button
holes can be utilized for various things.
They fit the bands on stocks; and on the
stud can be fastened the necktie.
Shirt waists made at home should be
finished very carefully around the neck
and the collar made high. Only, a band
Is put on and a ribbon, a stock, a necktie
or a collar is fastened around this band.
They do not make waists any more with
collars attached, and if any manufac
turer has been so injudicious as to turn
out a supply of them he should be pun
ished by a refusal to buy. for the collars
soil in a day, while the shirt waist re
mains neat. Â£ This makes too much laun
dry work and wears out the waist in a
short time.
THE FOUR-IN-HAND AND THE BUTTERFLY.
The woman who has not much to spend
on shirt waists this summer will do will
to divide her money and give one-half to
neck trimmings. If she has $20 she can
get one silk waist, one nice non-wash
waist for evening wear and the re
mainder of money she spends in
lawns, ginghams, calicoes and per
cale shirt waists. If she is clev
er and gets them at special sales
she can perhaps save $5 of that money,
but she must take it for granted that she
will need at least six waists of various
descriptions to carry her through the
summer, a-nd the sooner she gets to work
at them the better. Her ties are to be
selected with no regard to material, but
with regard to color. If the tie matches
the hat, and the hat matches the gloves,
and the gloves match the skirt and the
skirt is in harmony -with veil and pins,
then the woman may feel that she Is
wearing a suit that is fashionable, even
though her waist be of cheapest gingham
and her skirt of inexpensive light bril
liantine.
Plain gingham dresses trimmed with
ruffles and embroidered with cross stitch
will be very popular, and with them is
worn the most elaborate tie that can be
conceived. A great chiffon bow measur
ing nearly half a yard across and fully
half a yard in length is not too large. A
grent many dressmakers are going back
to the day when long ties were fashion
able, ami are saving out a piece of the
go..dÂ« for the necktie. This piece of good*
is hemmed on both edges and on the ends.
and is trimmed with a white lace ruffle.
This makes a neat finish for the dress,
although not as effective as a contrast
ing color.
The cost of ties is at first sight fab
ulous. But you must select a few of them
and add to them with home-made articles;
The Roman ties you can make at home
by purchasing three yards of broad silk
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1893.
I Ronran ribbon. Fringe out the ends, and
if the fringe i 3 not heavy enough buy a
lew fingers of silk fringe and sew it on
the tie. This tie at the counter would
probably cost $3, but- at home you can
i make it* m> for $l Su.
There are few more attractive counters
lust now than the neckwear counters.
The dealers have a way this spring of
making everything attractive to the face.
For the classic-nosed girl there is the
stiff satin tie; for the girl of irregular
features there is the soft chiffon bow: for
the brunette there is scarlet and yellow;
for the pale blonde there is deep greenand
deep blue. Far the whit. '-haired woman
there are soft prays and soft creams, and
for the woman in mourning there is an
immense variety of black and white
goods. All must be suited.
It Is- very well if you are planning the
summer campaign to buy your summer
ties by the quantity. It is wise to pur
chase a card of summer butterfly bows
in all colors. You can possibly get them
cheap. This will carry you through the
season for that kind of tie and you will
always have a variety on hand. So with
gloves and so with collars and cuffs.
Every store makes a reduction by the
quantity, and you will find it much
cheaper in the end than in buyin~ a sin
gle collar or a single pair of cuffs. With
gloves- the reduction comes in lots of
three. Dollar gloves can be bought three
pairs for $2 50, which makes a saving of
half a dollar.
Every woman. at the beginning of the
summer season should make an estimate
of the amount she will probably have for
her dress. Then she can divide this ac
cordingly. If her allowance in summer
be $5 a week for dressing herself, she can
make a calculation or this and can lay
out the money to better advantage than
if she spent it at random.
A word of advice must be said of sav
ing summer toilettes. Do not attempt to
save them. If you have anything new
wear it and wear it every day. Dress up
and look pretty. Soon the time comes
when every one looks dusty and rusty
like yourself. Jt is very poo- policy to
lay aside your pretty clothes for SuncViy
best wear. Wear the best you have and
when it has given out you have the sat
isfaction of knowing that other people s
clothes have gone also.
Parasols come with trimmings to match
all these ties; and there are slippers and
shoes for every occasion.
WORKING WOMEN'S
ROOMS JLND .HOMES.
THE Question of how to live and
where is quite as important to the
bachelor maid as the question of
what to wear.
Boarding houses offer a shelter and
place of existence, but they become so
entirely wearying after a few years that
one becomes Quite anxious to try some
thing else
Two young women have taken four
rooms in a private house and are so hap
py in their new experiment, which is six
months old, that their experience will be
interesting to the boarding house woman
eager for a change.
A Japanese boy comes to their rooms
for a dollar and a half a week, and
sweeps, dusts and washes dishes. They
pay $14 rent, and by actual ex
perience $10 a month pays for food, fuel
and gas. The Japanese boy does all the
plain v ishing, and the rest Is sent out.
The ~ath room was fitted up for the
common dressing room, as an adjunct,
with two large bureaus. A long mirror
is screwed to the door; a dressing .table,
consisting of a shelf with a mirror and
low chair, fills the room, which was
fortunately of good size.
For the two sitting rooms, blue
denim, made with the gray side up, and
well lined with carpet lining, made a
most artistic iloor covering.
For beds, good cots with woven wire
Killings and mattress to lit are perfectly
comfortable at night, and during the day
make pretty couches. A valance of blue
and v^hite cotton tacked 10 the frame
hides the legs. A spread of the same,
edged with a ruffle and ending with the
top, with pillows in different harmonizing
colors, completes a really pretty piece of
furniture.
I-ow bookshelves, made of common
pine by the carpenter and stained, with
curtains of light blue denim, a small
bamboo tea tab!<-\ rocking chairs, pic
tures and plants complete the furnishing.
Well selected prints from the pictorial
weeklies are cleverly framed for the
walls.
The dining room and kitchen, however,
are the delight of the owners, and a
small coal stove with a box for coal,
made with a lid and stained a dark red,
tills one corner. A long, wide shelf fas
tened to the wall near the sink made a
kitchen table. A large screen, made by
placing the denim on a big clothes
horse, divided the kitchen from the din
ing room. A common deal table with
leaves to let down stands by the window.
It is covered with a blue and white
spread when not in use.
Holders and potlifters made of the
denim in the form of bags to protect the
hand hang by a brass ring in a line
around the stove. A box with a lid fas
tened outside the window like a flower
box holds the vegetables and answers for
a relrigerator.
The girls take turns in doing the cook
ing and marketing, and both agree that
it is no task, but rather a pleasure,
and they have what they like to eat and
for less 'than they have been paying. One
of them had been much troubled with
dyspepsia, and six months' home cooking
and quiet meals have cured her.
Both girls are sure they would be more
than sorry if circumstances forced them
to lose their dainty, pretty rooms and
the new life they have made for them
selves.
HINTS TO HOUSEKEEPERS.
Every housekeeper should know:
That salt should be kept in a dry
place.
That melted butter will not make a
good cake.
That veal should be white, dry and
close-grained.
That the colder eggs are the quicker
they will froth.
That good management Is better than
a good income.
That mutton should be deep red and
close-grained.
That nutmegs shquld be grated at the
blossom-end first.
That to make good pastry the ingre
dients must be very cold.
That the best poultry has the firm
flesh, yellow skin and legs.
That lemons will keep for weeks If
covered with cold water.
That the best beef is moderately fat
and the flesh of a bright red color.
That pork should be fine, close
grained and the rind smooth and thin.
SENATORS AND THEIR WIVES AT HOME
IN WASHINGTON.
WITH "conservative" or "jin
go" attached to their names
our Senators needs must
struggle with their reputa
tions as well as with their
convictions, and it is not al- |
ways an easy matter to live up to one's !
reputation. There must be many a I
day, on the lines of "Oh, what a Dif- !
ference in the Morning," when Mr. Ma- j
son, for instance, if not in a jingo
mood, but realizing what is expected of
him rises to his feet in the Senate de
termined to do or die; to
Give his little Senate laws
And sit attentive to his own applause.
The conservative Mr. Cullom from Il
linois earned his right to be so called, j
If roused or inspired beyond the dig- |
nified limits he allowed himself no
body ever knew of the animation and j
enthusiasm burning under the calm, j
dignified exterior and all went well, j
Nobody disputed his right to an exclu
sive elevation of respectability and the
reputation he desired was always with
him.
But one cruel night this winter a dog
tight was held in the stable? adjoin'-ig
his house and the authorities, hearing j
of it, arrested one and all present. The
Washington papers did not even hint
at the possibility of Mr. Cullom's j
knowledge of, or-absence from, the ca- ;
nine war and ever since an unkind and â 
skeptical public has alluded to "safety !
valves" or "still waters," and whis- j
pered other unvarnished insinuations.
The Senatorial circle has its swells, .
its plebeians and its middle register, like !
every other body of people; its social !
customs are strictly enforced and its j
established etiquette is on an unshak
able basis. The Diplomatic Corps, ex- j
ceptlng the four Embassadors of Eng- j
land, Germany, Italy and France, make j
the first call upon the members of the .
Senate, as representing sovereign
states, and this is balm to many a Sen
atorial heart.
Mrs. Lodge of Massachusetts is ex
clusive, cold, haughty, a daughter of j
Boston's elect. She is a handsome,
aristocratic-looking woman, always ex
quisitely gowned in Paris costumes,
which her beautiful figure sets off to
the best advantage. She looks like a
very young woman; her friends ques
tion if this is because of the impassive
Boston temperament, or if she .imports'
a special complexion cream with her
trunks of French creations. Whatever
the reason, the result is undisputed,
and her eighteen-year-old son appears
as a genuine surprise after one has met
his mother. A perfect manner, a rare j
tact and a sweet, if impersonal, smile
add to Mrs. Lodge's attractions. A pe
culiarity of hers is that she always
wears gloves on her day at home. Per
haps being obliged to shake hands with
hundreds of strangers is the cause of
this very unusual peculiarity.
Senator Tillman has a boast, a pet
boast; it is that he does not possess a
dress suit. For he is a Populist â the I
pride of the people and th despair of !
his tailor.
Senator Cockrell is another Populist !
whose party con Ictlo- have led him !
to the wearing of a gray alpaca coat; !
a garment especially cc'julated for f
comfort on a dustry drive along: a coun- j
try road on a lot summer day.
This gray alpaca coat is the dark
Clood hovering over his j ->tty daugh- j
ter's happy career. Â«-~e has been well j
educated, traveled through Europe ,
when she left school and has had every I
advantage, for her father has not car- ]
ried out his party convictions in her !
case, at least. She is a handsome, j
bright, capable American girl. Her j
father does not care for social gayety, i
which is perhaps as well, considering
the coat, and as she has no rr.Jther she
is always accompanied by so s of her
friends, of whom here axo many proud 'â 
to chaperon so popular a girl.
Another pre J 'y girl, and one who j
made her debut this winter at "Stewart j
Castle," is Miss Fox, the grand- i
daughter of the Nevada Senator, M#. i
Stewart. Stewart Castle has had a ;
more eventful history than most man- :
sions of conservative aspect. At one â 
time, being leased to the Ch se lega- j
tion, it had an opportunity to view the i
life of the Orient under the auspices of j
intimate association. Returning to â 
ita American owners it sued the lega
tion for the astonishing sum of $80,000
for damages cone its elegant interior, j
Mrs. Stewart gave a magnificent ball to j
introduce her lovely granddaughter to |
Washington society nd during the!
brilliant, successful evening she an
nounced to all her friends that they
were attending her fareweii en*ertain
ment, as her home was in the hands of j
agents to be sold for an apartment j
house. And lurking around the mag- j
nificent ball room wherr so many good j
times had been enjoyed many a genuine j
regret was feit at the prospective dis
posal of the house.
The handsome home formerly occu
pied by Senator Stanford and his wife
is still called the" Stanford house," and |
in it is left some of .ie furniture and
j pictures belonging to Mrs. Stanford, j
It is now occupied by Mr. Murphy of
New York. Mr. Murphy is a great po
litical factor ii. the Senate; his daugh
ter married Hugh Grant, May of New
York, and, through his son-in-law, Mr.
Murphy is connected with the political
| element there. His debutante daughter
| is an attractive girl whose position in
Washington society is assured.
Mr. Mantell is the bachelor of the
Senate, and this means much, for the
Senators have a little way of being
| married which has proved most trying
to many a Washington girl.
Mr. Morrill of Vermont is the loved
and respected "grandpa" of the Senate.
"Grandpa Morrill" has just celebrated
his eighty-seventh birthday. Every
year he holds a reception, to which
everybody goes to tender their con
gratulations and good wishes to the
oldest member of the Senate.
Mr. Mason of Chicago and Mr. Lodge
! of Boston are, though so closely asso
ciated in one way, a case of "so near
THE BIG ROMAN RIBBON TIE.
and yet so far," just as thoroughly as
are the two cities that they represent.
.Mr. Lodge is conservative, level-head
ed and cool, balancing his words care
fully and living up to the conscious- j
ness that everything he says carries
weight.
Mr. Mason plays to the gaJlery; his
speeches have fire and are calculated
to make any bosom beat in its coun
try's cause.
Mr. Mason has a small daughter; she
has not left her babyhood far behind,
and she has pretty blue eyes and a i
curly head.
Mr. Gray is a Democrat who votes
for his convictions, entirely regardless !
of party; he is respected for his rug- j
ged integrity and honesty. He was a j
stanch friend of Cleveland and stood j
by him through thick and thin. Mr.
Gray's pet ambition was to be appoint
ed to the supreme bench, but although
Mr. Cleveland had two chances to give
him the position he coveted, he allowed
both chances to slip by. Which gave 'â 
the skeptical a chance to reflect upon ;
friendship and to quote, "Put not |
your trust in princes."
Senator Morgan is another who, al- i
though a strong Democrat, is known to ;
vote, regardless of politics, for a meas- j
ure on its true worth and according to !
his convictions.
We have had Mark Hanna'g photo
graphs, his manners, his ideas, his as
pirations and in fact Hanna from
every point of view. But Mr. Hanna â¢
was taken from an entirely new stand- j
point one evening this winter when he
went to make an informal call on a
well-known diplomat and his wife.
To the Japanese servant who opened ;
the door he said: "I forgot my card, ;
just say it's Hanna,"
And the Japanese sought his master :
and mistress in their sitting room and
bowing low said, "Hanna."
"Who is it?" asked the mistress.
"Just Hanna," was the reply.
"Hanna," repeated his mistress, run- |
ning over the maids of her friends in '
her mind. "Hannah? Oh well, tell her
to send up her message," she added, ,
going back to an interesting novel.
It was some moments later that the '
butler returned and with his usual im- :
perturbable expression and respectful
bow said, "Mark Hanna,"
Mr. Hanna's bright bead-like eyes ;
sparkle with amusement when he tells !
this tale of mistaken identity.
The newly appointed Senator from \
Indiana, Mr. Fairbanks, lives in a j
pretty house formerly occupied by
Chief Justice Fuller. He has a beauti
ful wife, a blonde, whose bright spark- 1
ling face is full of animated, ever
changing expression. 'Mrs. Fairbanks
has the charming faculty of making
every one feel thoroughly at home, and
her hospitality is whfcle souled and \
sincere. j
Thursday is the Senatorial reception
day, and as everybody is privileged to
call on the Senators' wives this means
that the handsome houses at least are j
thronged with sight seera. Mrs. Lodge
of Massachusetts, Mrs. Elklns of West
Virginia, Mrs. Wetmore of Rhode Isl
and and Mrs. Hale of Maine are con
sidered socially at the head of the Sen
ate. Mrs. Elkins was Miss Hattie
Davis of Washington. She is a pretty
woman, years younger than her hus
band. She dresses well, entertains^ ex
tensively and is very popular. Mrs.
Elkins and Mrs. Hale occupy two of
the handsomest houses in Washington.
Mrs. Hale, however, dor not entertain,
having been an invalid for the past
few years. Mr. Hale is the only Re
publican Senator who has stood up for
Spain right along. Mme. Dupuy de
Lome has been given the credit of
having cleverly talked him over to her
country's cause. Now that her influ
ence is removed it is thought that Mr.
Hale's loyalty may waver.
The woman most sought after In
Washington to-day is probably Mrs.
Cushman Davis. Mr. Davis being the
chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, great pressure is brought to
bear on his wife to induce her to in
fluence her husband against war. Mrs.
Davis is a tall, large woman with a
commanding presence. She is dark and
has c rich color, which makes her black
eyes seem even brighter. The Davises
are usually invited to the diplomatic
dinners at the White House, where
Mrs. Davis looks even more stately and
handsome in her rich ball gown? and
sparkling jewels. â
Among the most lavish entertain
ments given in Washington were those
of the recent Senator frDin Ohio, Mr.
Brice. The Brices rented the well
known Corcoran mansion, for which
they paid $10,000 a year, and at one of
their musicales Mme. Melba was en
gaged to sing at a fabulous price.
The atmosphere of the Senate, pre
sided over by Vice-President Hobart,
being dignified and sedate impresses
one so thoroughly with its sober, re
liable, steady aspect that it is im
possible to imagine ev^n its most im
petuous member rising in his wrath
against another of opposite convictions
to hurl at his mistaken head the near
est missile calculated to demolish his
inferior brain. This manner of airy
persiflage is relegated to the House,
but eloquence alone is the sole weapon
in use among the members of the great
est "club" in America â the Senate.
Out of 226,000 farms in Denmark only
1900 are more than 250 acres in extent.
The medical department of the
Queen's household costs Â£2700 yearly,
and comprises twenty-four persons.
The telegraph messengers in populous
French towns use bicycles for the dis
tribution of their telegrams.
A full-grown black ostrich is seven
feet high, and easily carries on its back,
with the speed of a horse, a man of
average size.
Women have an important place in
the English postal department. Of the
total of persons of all ranks of the
service, permanent and occasional, em
ployed by the department throughout
the United Kingdom, nearly 21,000 are
of the gentler sex.

ANCIENT ORDER OF WORKMEN.
Last Monday night Crocker Lodge had
;i smoker In Mission Masonic Hall, at
which there was a good attendance. In
.L.oii -j^ a most instructive address on
the subject of the order, delivered by
Grand Master Workman G. H. Bahrs, for
the information of those who were pres
ent and not members of the order, and
the singing of original songs by Grand
Receiver Sam Booth, there was a splendid
programme of instrumental music by the
Ban Francisco Military Band, of which
Recording Secretary Hollister of Crocker
Lodge, is the leader. The band gave the
Spangled Banner" as an overture,
and the'audience manifested its apprecia
tion of the am hem by loud applause... It
further manifested its love of country by
vociferously applauding other popular
American airs. The lodge provided a col
lation, refreshments and pipes and tobac
co under the direction of S. H. Snyder,
Frank Terramore and J. H. Barron, the
entertainment committee.
Past Grand Master W. H. Barnes and
Financial Secretary Camp, as a commit
tee of two from. Valley Lodge to get up
an entertainment for the friends of that
body, havo reason to feel proud of their
work. Laurel Hall in Shiels building, in
which the entertainment was given, was
well filled, and the programme was a
most attractive and interesting one. There

Hirschberg, for the great services he ren- j
dered to the order during the twenty
years he has been connected with it, and

DEGREE OF HONOR.
Last Wednesday night Grand Master
George H. Bahrs was elected and initi
ated a member of Ivy Lodge. He de
livered an address on the. beneficiary fea
ture of the order, filed an application for
a certificate and his example was fol
lowed by eight others. During the even
ing, the lodge was presented by the two
grand' recorders, F. S. Poland of the
A. O. U. W-, and Mrs. F. S. Poland of
the D. of H.. with a beautiful altar cloth
and a tiro-gilt emblem of the order to
place on the Bible. The fact that hus
band and wife are the two grand record
ers, soim-thing that may never occur
again, was made the subject of many
pleasant remarks.
The proceedings of the last held Grand
Lodge have been printed and are being
distributed.
OIR NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
The orange social given last Monday
night by Las Lnmas Parlor in Mission |
Parlor Hall was another of those delight- !
fill, enjoyable affairs that the members
of this parlor know so well how to ar-
The hall was tastefully decorated
in orange, and on the walls and on the
chandeliers were clusters of orang-es,
whirl, made a striking and effective dec
oration; but the most striking feature of
these clusters was that the oranges were I
all on branches of lilac. It was a sort of i
yellow fake that was excusable for want ;
of orange trees from which to strip j
branches. There was a short programme I
that included music, songs, games ana I
dancing between numbers. Julius Han
cock favored with a vocal solo; Miss â¢
Emma flicks entertained with piano se
lections; Mrs. J. H. Burrington and Mr.
Hancock gave a charming vocal duet;
the "Kricnd of the Native Daughters"
occupied ton minutes telling stories and
the most amusing of the games was the
contest between the United States and
Spain, represented by a row of ladies ami
gentlemen on one side of the line and
another row on the other side. A gas i
balloon was started down the line, and I
each side had to bat it, and when it i
reached the end of the line the struggle |
was to keep it on one side or the other, i
the last one who. held it winning for his :
side. It went to the United States. The
committee that had charge of the affair
was: Miss Mattie Farris, Miss Gimpel,
Waters, Mrs. McAllister, Mrs. S. P.
Daggett and Miss Conlan.
Mont Parlor at Its last held meeting
was visited by Grand President Mrs. Con
r&d. On that occasion fifteen candidates
were initiated. At the next meeting |
eighteen more will be initiated.

On Wednesday, April 20, Grand Chief
Companion Mrs. Emma Harrington of the
Companions of the Forest of America
paid her official visit to Surprise of Wood
land Circle, and she was gratified to note
the interest that the members are taking
in the order. At the exemplification of
the work, the rules were closely followed
by the officers, and the work as a whole
was very creditable. After the business
there was served up a fine collation,
and the following day the visitor was the
guest of Grand Trustee Mrs. Mugge. On
the evening of that day Mrs. Harrington
was invited to the residence of Mrs. Pow
ers, a member of the circle, where a
pleasant time was had, and this Was
heightened by the entrance of the mem
bers of Court Star of Woodland, who

pen and holder.
On the 23d she paid a visit to Freedom

well received and expresses herself well
pleased with the circle. She visited
Grass Valley, and the prospects are that
the circle there will be reorganized in a
short time.
Last Thursday night the erand chief

Mrs. Lizzie Atwood, past grand chief
companion; Grand Sub-Chief Companion
Ira W. Coburn, Grand Treasurer Mrs.
Miller, Grand Marshal Mrs. Connell.
Grand Trustee Mrs. Jacobs, also Grand

that is worthy of imitation by all chief
companions, and the otner officers did
their work in a very creditable manner.
After the work there was a number of.
addresses by the grand officers and visit
ors, and the grand officers paid a high com
pliment to the officers for the initiatory
work and for the strictly business manner
in which they conducted their affairs,
laying particular stress on the excellent
and complete system adopted by Miss
Wishman, the financial secretary, in the
keeping of her books. During the even
ing Mrs. Tucker, on behalf of the circle,
presented the grand chief companion
a cornucopia of oeautiful flowers. A col
lation followed the close of the meeting.
THE NATIONAL, UNION.
At the meeting of Golden Gate Council
of the National Union last Tuesday night
the patriotism of the membership was
demonstrated by the adoption of a reso
lution to the effect that the council will
pay the dues and assessments of any of
its members who may enlist for the war.
The council received one application and
initiated one candidate.
The committee of arrangements haa al
most completed its programme for the

and that the lodges are rapidly adding to
their membership.
Grand Secretary Aschheim states that
the order which up to last September was

WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
At the recent meeting held in Salt Lake
City It was decided to adopt an equaliza
tion plan, by which the order will pay
beneficiary certificates at the age of 70.
The ritual has been printed in the Ger
man language, and it is expected that a
German camp will shortly be established
in this city.
The head camp has decided to levy a
per capita tax of 25 cents for the pur
pose of raising a fund that will amount,
by that tax. to $30,000, to pay special
nurses who will care for wounded Wood
men who may serve during the war.
Golden Gate Camp, at its last held meet
ing, initiated four candidates and received
three applications. This camp had, on
April 1, ISM, 360 members, and it now
hiis a membership of 795. with forty appli
cations on hand. The growth of this
camp has been phenomenal. Its meetings
are always well attended.
General Organiser George K. Rogers
has gone to Los Angeles to complete
plans for organization work In that por
tion of the State.
â¢ Organizers H. B. Jennings and M. B.
Estes are at work on a new campâ being
the third they have established within
the past sixty days.
Organizer Rutherford reports a camp
nearly organized to start in the outlying
Mission district.
Organizer 0. -L. Scott is working on a
new camp to start with fifty charter
members, to be known as California
Junior Camp, its members comprising
many prominent Native Sons living in the
district near Devlsadero and Oak streets.
He is also at work on a new camp in the
Richmond district.
The results of recent organization work
are now very apparent, and it is expected
that there will be twelve strong camps
in San Francisco by August at the time
the Head Camp session convenes here.
Members of the Woodmen of the World
called into the service of the United
States do not lose any of their rights or
benefits. The order collects the rate of
20 cents per $1000 additional of such mem
bers, being the additional rate for all ex
tra hazardous occupations.
Instructions have been issued by Head
Consul Falkonburg to camps, ordering
that in all cases where the relatives of an
enlisted man are unable to pay his in
surance, the camp of which he is a mem
ber is required to do so out of its general
fund thus preserving to the family of
the soldier all his rights and benefits as
a member of the Woodmen of the World.

WAS SUED FOR
ROOM RENT
Wallace S. Taylor Explains His
Case Fully to Justice
Cook.
Ho Was at First Imprisoned and Re
leased and the Present Case is
Under Advisement.
The case of Mrs. Defau against Wallace
S. Taylor for the purpose of recovering
delinquent room rent was brought before
Justice Cook yesterday morning and after
testimony had been given the case was
taken under advisement until Tuesday
morning, when the justice will render his
decision. Taylor was arrested on an
affidavit sworn to by the landlady, Mrs.
Defau, and Mr. Armstrong, attorney for
the Interstate Collection and Law Com
pany, was made attorney of record as he
represented the firm in whose hands the
bill had bÂ«en placed for collection. At
the first proceedings Attorney Meldon rep
resented the plaintiff, who was dismissed
by the justice. He stated that a sufficient
or correct action had not been taken to
warrant imprisonment for the charge.
According to testimony Taylor owed
Mrs. Defau the bill as alleged, but stated
that he was unable to pay it. Then a col
lection agency was resurted to, and as
the landlady owed Attorney Armstrong
a considerable sum of money he was re
tained as counsel and also represents Mrs.
Taylor, who is suing her husband for
divorce on grounds of non-support. At
first arrangements were made whereby
the matter would be settled if Taylor
could have his father sign a note with
him for the amount due, and the note was
forwarded to Brooklyn, N. V., where Tay
lor Sr., who Is reported to be wealthy,
resides. The note was for six months
and was not signed by the father of the
man who is being sue!, and It was stated
that more time should be given. Now the
defendant states through his attorney
that his father has signed the note, but
it has not been presented to the plaintiff,
who is willing to accept it for payment in
full.
It had been stated that Attorney Tom
sky who represents the defendant, was
highly indignant at the treatment his
client had received and would sue Attor
ney Armstrong for having Mr. Taylor im
prisoned, but this Is denied by Tomsky.
BEGINNING
OF THE END
Southern Pacific's Suit
Over Grain Rates Near-
ing a Crisis.
Replication Filed and Notice
Given That Testimony
Will Be Oral.
A Matter Soon to Bo Settled Which
Is of Interest to the Entire
State.
Attorney Herrin of the Southern Pa
cific Company yesterday filed with the
clerk of the United States Circuit
Court the Southern Pacific's replica
tion in the suit to restrain the Railroad
Commissioners from fixing a reduced
schedule of rates.
This suit had its beginning in an or
der of the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners, dated September 17, 1895,
whereby the grain rates over the lines
of the Southern Pacific in California
were reduced 8 per cent. On the 15th
of October, in the san.e year, the
Southern Pacific Company filed a suit
in equity in the United States Circuit
Court against the commission, which
had for its object the annulment of the
order as adopted, and to restrain the
commission from putting any order
into force looking toward the reduc
tion erf any rates then charged for the
transportation of freight v^ithin the
State.
On the filing of the suit a temporary
restraining order was granted prohib
iting the commission from adopting
any order whereby the rates for trans
portation of freight would be reduced.
The suit lagged almig until Novem
ber, 1896, when Judge McKenna, who
was at that time on the Circuit bench,
made a further order continuing in
force that part of the previous order
which related to the action already ta
ken by the commission reducing the
rates on grain, but holding that the
Board of Commissioners had the right
to enact orders reducing freight rates
within the territory over which they
held jurisdiction, after a satisfactory
examination of the books, earnings,
expenditures and general financial con
dition of the road cm which the reduc
tion was to take place. Such order of
the commission, however, must always
be subject to the approval of a prop
erly qualified court.
From the date of McKenna's decision
the suit has been dragging alonÂ§r be
fore Judge Morrow in the Circuit
Courtt going through all the long
course of technical chancery proceed
ings thaft are necessary before that
stage can be reached where the issue
can be squarely put to the front and
decided one way cr the other.
Answers, exceptions, answers and
more exceptions were passed back and
forth until at last the last technicality
had been disposed of and all that re
mained was for the Southern Pacific
Company to file its replication and
bring the matter squarely to a head.
This the railroad did yesterday, and
now it only remains for the day of
hearing to be set by the court. The
railroad has given notice that it will
move to take testimony orally instead
of by depositions and other written
statements as is customary in most
chancery proceedings.
The case is one that should excite a
widespread interest throughout the
State, as its result will be of vital im
portance to every farmer, fruit man
and shipper who has a pound of goods
to send over the lines of the Southern
Pacific.
To-morrow at 1 o'clock the RaJlroad
Commission will meet to commence its
examination of the financial condition
of the Southern Pacific roads, in order
to comply with the above mentioned
order of Judge McKenna, and thus lay
the proper foundation for a genera! re
duction of the freight schedule on all
the road? operating in the State. It is
expected that by the time the com
mission shall have completed its la
bors the public will have obtained a
more extended knowled* of railroad
workings in a little while than it has
acquired during all the years that have
intervened since the two oceans were
first connected.
Scots Will Celebrate.
The St. Andrew's Society will hold Its
thirty-fourth annual picnic next Sunday
at Fairfax. The St. Andrew's Society is
the oldest Scotch society in the city, hav
ing been organized in 1863. It is custom
ary before the annual picnic to hold an
open meeting of the society for its mem
bers and their friends, and this year the
usual open meeting will be held at Scot
tish Hall to-morrow evening, when an in
teresting programme of Scotch music will
be presented.
TRY THE ORIGINAL LEAD OF THE LOW
EST TRUMP.
Some five years ago the writer Introduced
the innovation of leading the lowest trump
from five or even sixâ under certain condi
tionsâto our little whist circle. A year or two
later we mentioned it to some of our Eastern
whjst frlonds, and the report from those who
gave the play a trial was. in their opinion, a
trick winner. These reports came from a class
of tyros like ourselves, that don't and won't
ever lay claim to being experts.
We believe when the original leader of a
deal haÂ« a very strong plain suit with some
trump strengthâ he should lead from that
strong suit and select a card for the opening,
and follow, that gives all the information pos
sible as regards Its length and strength. But
when the original leader's suit is all small
trumps, holding four, five, or even six. and no
plain suit, that Is worth trying to â¢stabltsh,
our claim Is, the best lead you can make is
the lowest trump, and have it convey this
meaning: "Partner, this is my lowest trump.
I have four at least, possibly five or six, and
no plain suit worth trying to establish, and
don't you return trump without good reasons
of your own for doing so."
With such a holding, I claim you don't want
to make a lead that is too tnfonnatory, one
that shows your exact holding; It is Just the
information your adversaries are anxious to
get. It is a very simple matter to show num
ber of trumps later If your partner's play
indicates that he ought to know.
In "Owl's Whist Don'ts," page 22. published
In ISBS, we gave a full description of this play
and how to lead from your trump suit in case
you did want a quick return of same. We
would like to have the committee that was
appointed at the midwinter meeting, that will
be known as the "Bureau of Experiment," try
this Innovation. We intend to go to the next
congress and play at whist, and we will use
this trump lead, and we hope we will not be
charged with using private inventions.

you to page 55, under the heading of "Twenty
Hints for Beginners":
No. 17. "Three remarks only are allowable
at whist during the play of the hand":
(1) The question: "What are trumps?"
(2) The interrogatory: "Having no trumps,
partner?"
(3) The demand: "Draw (or place) your
cards." (The last must be made before play
ing to a trick.)
What are the facts?
Firstâ The first question is permissible, but
the wording is not taken from our code of
laws.
Second â If you ask the second question,
"Having no trumps, partner?" or asking the
corrected one. "Having none of the suit led,
partner?" should your partner have one of the
suit, asklne either of these questions estab
lishes a revoke in your partner's hand.
Thirdâ The third is also not In accordance
with the American Whist League code. As
long as the cards have not been touched for the
purpose of gathering them together any one
at any time may demand that the players draw
their cards.
The first and third are of little consequence,
but the second rather vital, and strange that an
up-to-date whist writer could fall into such an
errorâ that is the law in England, but has not
been the law In this country for several years.
The writer also says: "By courtesy a player
may look at the last trick." This In not so.
A player looking at the last trick Is subject to
the same penalty as leading out of turn, which
Is, a suit may be called from the offender or
his partner the first time it is the turn of
either of them to lead.
The author gives rules for leading. A good
many of them are not in accord with the
American lead system, and for that reason we
cannot indorse his ideas. For instance, he says
on page 28: "With ace. king, queen in a suit
of five or more, lead the ace first." On the
same page he also says: "With ace and four
small cards of a suit pome will lead a small
card first: this Is an error." The facts are the
lead of the fourth best card from ace and four
small has become almost universal and the rec
ognized lead by nearly every expert player In
This work shows that the author is a little
antiquated, but his heart is in the right place.
This little work only costs four bits, and every
advanced whist player should purchase a copy
to help along a good cause.
THE ROTARY DISCARD.
Whist Opinion for April reproduces an article
from the Philadelphia Press, written by
W. A. Hawley, on the Innovation
Introduced into the game of whist by our whist
editor called the Rotary Discard. One of the
strangest features about anything that is in
troduced as new In whist play is it Is con
demned 98 times out of 100 without tha eem
blance of a trial. The article Is a nattering
one. It says:
Of all " the changes which have been sug
gested In latter years the most Important are:
First, the American leads, and secondly, the
rotary discard. â  Both' of these modern Inno
vations are based upon principle and are sure
to be incorporated as such.
< The first of these principles has been demon
strated ' to the entire ; satisfaction :of all. a.i
though at first and perhaps now there were
and are many malcontents. The second prin
ciple is newer a: d has met with a storm -of
abuse but notwithstanding the torrents of '
anathemas hurled at it. there will most likely
be action by the congress at Boston, legitima
tizing It by fixing the arbitrary rotation of suits.
Of course the feature of the play is In the one
card discard, which indicates the strength with
the same force and â  effect as if a card i of the
strong suit was shown - and understood to be a
discard of strength. ; with this. great advantage,
the suit is : not impaired oneliota. '
: The rotation should be established once and
for all time. The moment tills Is done the play
will spring . into universal . favor and take its
place along with the signal and other legiti
mate â : plays vof the game. The Philadelphia
Whist Club used the rotation in the order of
! hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. And they
also only used ; ,the discard when partner was
leading trumps and likely to remain with â¢: it.
Such a scheme of course limits Its use to the
I understood conditions, but when they are In
evidence the plan or rather the discard is most
i valuable; â - In fact, invaluable, : for at such â >. a
time the deal Is in a critical condition and a j
wrong dose will produce a relapse of ft cm one ,
to three or more tricks:, whereas, on the other j
[ hand, the tight lead means sure gain. 'â¢ ,
-There are : some â  hard and fast conditions re
specting the rotary, and â¢ the efforts ,of its
friends will ; be , devoted ' to : their elimination
and ; perhaps some day 'it - can be used for all
discards. As a principle It is certainly ' broad
enough to admit of many applications and va-
I riations. . â¢â  . " '.' â Â« â 'â 
:â¢ T. E. OTIS â¢IN THE NEWARK NEWS.
: Of â¢ the many I papers . â  that we â¢ receive
that have : a whist department we ' enjoy none
better, than â  the Newark News . of Newark, . N.
J., â¢so ably i edited \by Mr. T. E. ; Otis. >' Besides
being a whist player of i the first rank, , Mr. Otis
Is a writer that you can thoroughly understand

I . reproducing 'â¢ selections ; from I his , articles " com
i menting on the system; of ; play used In a late
I Inter-city contest, he says: . . , ,'
VA team which- recently played In the big
, inter-elty contest was reported sto have :a â  sys
tem 'â¢â  which - embraced / forty-three - rules. " The
team 5 finished well down the i| line, and was
never considered, erous. '< Another team, i la ;
the same contest, claimed to have no system.
This team was also quite a distance from the
front ranks at the close. These two teams., rep
resented the two extremes of the system ques
tion, and one was as illorical as the other.
The first told too much and took too long to
tell it, while the latter depended Upon -the
jruesslng anility of its members. If either or
both of these teams had adopted a ml<i<lls
course they would have finished much nearer
the top than thpy dirt. It is useless- to reason
with such people on the question of system, as
they wi!l not he convinced. Their error 4s due
largely to their misconception of the cause of
success at th- whist table. If you whip them
out of their bonts in- a match game they will
defend their beloved system at the expense of
their individual ability, or if they are the ad
vocates of nn system they will lay it all to
bad play and not to a lack of ability to c^n
vev knowledge. They seem willing to sacrifice
everything else except .that which is largely" the
cause of their defeat. The only thing- you can
do with such people is t<-> let them dream on,
and wait untiF they get back to earth. Some
people have come out of that kind of a trance
and done good whist work, but they cannot bÂ«
reasoned with while In it.

AND DRAMATIC CRITICISM AND
PROF. SYLE AND IBSEN.
Now that Ferris Hartman has cut j
out several of the songs which blem- ;
ished the first performance of "The '
Purser" and made a sincere and fairly ;
successful effort not to "mug" the au
dience. and managed generally to blunt
the several bad points in his acting to i
which I called attention Tuesday morn
ing, it gives me pleasure to acknowl- ;
edge the Improvement with the same
publicity that I gave to the need of it. |
I was tempted to see -The Purser" a
second time by a note of Invitation
from Mr. Hartman, in which I was al
most paralyzed to read his thanks for
my suggestions. I have heard actors
and authors say that they are ever
willing to consider criticism and if I 3-
Bible profit by it, but I must confessâ
and by so doing. I hope, justify the
mention of Mr. Hartman's little noteâ
that this is the first time in an experi
of some years that I have been
thanked for anything except, in the
parlance of the Rialto, a "good notice."
Previous acknowledgments received
from other actors and from authors
have been in the nature of warm con
gratulations on my undiluted praise of
their work. Actors, particularly, de> not
like suggestions. The sacred contents
of a "notice book," which usually an
actor values next his life, are rarely
marred by suggestions of any sort or
ausht that is not reconcilable with his
own estimate of the work reviewed. I
remember -once while poring over
pages .of this pasted praise to have re
marked to the paster: "Have you never
been -.'slated anywhereâ haven't you
ever struck a fool critic who couldn't
â¢late you?" And he replied:
"What's the sense in keeping that sort
of rot? If I get my salary, please my
manager and most of my audience and
most of my critics, why should I col
lect souvenirs of a few professional
fault-finders who have been entertain
ing their little audiences at my ex
â  Now there are critics on whom
you can depend." he added with fine
.sis. "Here's a roast you didn't
notice, written by Winter of the New
York Tribune." I read the roast, per
haps with an idea to picking up a trick
Qr two in the gentle art of keeping j
is. It came at the tail end of a not i
unusual Wintery storm against play
and players, and this, as nearly as I
can remember, was it: "Even Mr. Bus
kin Socks, an always admirable actor, j
can appear but awkward and absurd
In the infelicitous opportunities of such
a character." "Now there," said the j
victim of this brutal attack, "is a roast
that wouldn't offend Tim Prawley. I'll
admit that it's justâ l did the best any j
man could have done, but it was a rot- j
ten part." ..
There is no doubt about it that the
criticsâ who would like to regard them
selves as specialized auditors, vir-
B in playgoingâ are not held at!
anything like their own valuations by j
th-> criticized. Even William Winter ,'
himself, the Grand Old* Man of the :
craft, recently wrote that in all his
two score years of theater Jour
nalism he has received but few kindly
acknowledgments from' those whose
work has been the inspiration of his,
and these few only from players whom
he has praised, artists, strangely j
enough, whose genius was above ques
tion.
After all, perhaps it is just as well
that the bond between actor and critic j
is no closer, that the candor of one J
precludes the friendliness of the other.
(Poor Clement Scott paid the price of j
friendship for a few unglittering gen- |
eralitiesl) Twenty "good notices" that;
have warmed the actor's heart, and I
perhaps Induced him to say to himself j
that the writer of them is a tine judge j
of acting, are soon forgot in the suf
fering caused by the brutal injustice j
of one adverse criticism. I suppose that
In a single lifetime I have no right to
AMUSEMENTS.

ask for more than the note I received
the other day from Mr. Hartman, but
I could wish that some eccentric Thes
pians would up and protest against
being overpraised. The only man I
ever heard of who did anything like
this was the author of "The Devil's
Disciple," who protested against the
praises given his play in the New York
press, because forsooth he considered
them neither sane nor logical. But
this author is Bernard Shaw, an in
curable dramatic critic himself.
Speaking of suggestions, I have been
thinking of one submitted in the Sun
day Examiner several weeks ago by
Professor Dv Pont Syle. The more I
think of it the harder I find it to recon
cile it with other ideas of Professor
Syle, who, as you might judge from his
ingenuous comparisons of seasons at
the Comedie Francaise and the Baldwin
and the Odeon and the Columbia, is a
theoretical rather than a practical
playgoer. Yet this suggestion of hisâ
which is nothing less than a scheme to
try on an Ibsen play or two with the
stock company at the # Alcazar â is a
good one. When I first read it I hoot
ed, picturing to myself the complicated
intelligences of the Alcazar stock actors
wrestling with the rugged simplicity
of Ibsen. But the more I thought over
it the less hootable and more feasible
it became. Th< cc iÂ» r<> weamoth ** you
think of it, why the Alcazar should not
do something for the intellectual
amazement of the town. With the
right stage manager and the right
booming in "intellectual circles" a lit
tle season of Ibsen might be made to
pay as handsomely as a little season
of symphonies.
I am sure that many of the sym
phony subscribers, with the proper
provocation, would willingly become
dilettante Ibsenites. And they could
have the fashionableness, the dilet
tanteism, the patrons' glory (as they
have had at the symphonies), so long
as the humble few could derive artis
tic experience from the presentation of
masterpieces (as we have done at the
symphonies.) If we had here Courte
nay Thorpe, Miss Robins, or somebody
of like caliber, the question of stage
management would be settled in an in
stant; but I can name none with any

experience or instinct that would fit
him for the work. Put Ibsen in the
hands of the usual stage manager of
the stage stagey, and he would better
never have been played. It requires
a man of patience, tact and intensity
sufficient to assist the average actor to
unlearn all the cant tricks of his bus
iness. With the exception of four or
five of his big characters. Ibsen is easy
to piay and does not absolutely demand
first-rate actors. But he must be
played without the strut, pose and elo
cutionary crime that the usual mod
ern play is made to fit. If Ibsen is
to be played by the Alcazar actors
somebody must do the staging who can
translate these actors into unaffected
humans and convince them that in the
plays there is nothing subtly cultured,
nothing esoterically significant, noth
ing indeed but exposure of human
character (legitimately exaggerated)
such as is usually concealed on the
stage under pain of being voted life
like and altogether unplay-like. I hope
that a stage manager may be uiw!
earthed, and Professor Syle's sugges
tion develop practical operations. If
necessary I shall forswear my inalien- |
able rights to deadhead courtesy and j
sign the subscription list. A season
.>i Ibsen may make rabid Ibsenites off
the superior few, but I will risk tho
chances and trust to a versatility of !
appreciation to save me from becoming j
Ibsenized to a point wnere I could no
longer endure the plays of Charles
Hoyt and William Shakespeare.

Robert Mantell, a more or less cele
brated actor of "romantic" roles, will
present to Ran Francisco the first new
play of a serious nature in many
months. The play is of the romantic j
type, full of fight and intrigue, and
written for Mr. Mantell by A. W. Tre- j
mayne of Montreal. It is called "The i
Secret Warrant," and takes its title
from one of those sinister documents
which, in the earlier part of the eight

Beaumont, captafn of the King's Guard,
a dare-devil solcMer and a handsomer
man than his royal master, the Re
gent, Philippe, Due d'Orleans. For
tune favors the dauntless Beaumont
until he Â«purns the love of the Regent's
favorite, Uabrielle de St. Victor, who,
in her fury, n"~ out with the hero's
name a blank lettre de cachet, which
has been given to her by the Regent.
How Beaumont is aided by John Law,
the famous Mississippi speculator; how
the Regent trembles lest it should be
made known to the world that he has
issued a blank "lettre de cachet"; how
the hero outwits the iealous mistress
of royalty, outwits the ambitions of
p. Mir Jean Bortrand, the humble gold
smith, to marry his daughter to the
villain of high degree; and how, finally,
he comes- into his heart's own â these
all are parts of the passion and plot
of the piece.
The period gives opportunity for pic
turesque and elegant costuming; and
the manners and liaisons of the Bour
bon court will doubtless be reflected in
the atmosphere of the play. It is prom
ised that the production is liberal and
that Manager Mart Hanley has sur
roundfd Mr. Mantell with capable sup
port.
Bald Win.
Ferris Hartman in "The Purser" will
play all of this week at the Baldwin.
The announced engagement at the
Baldwin on the 9th inst. of the cele
brated French pantomimist. Mile. Pilar
Morin, and her original company, in
cluding among others Mme. Severine,
Messrs. Belknap and Brinton, as well
as young Edmond Morin, the 12-year
old artist, who htu: surprised New York
by his clever pantomime work, already
has attracted no small amount of atten
tion. From present appearances this
theatrical novelf of the year will be
widely attended and will be made quite
a society event as it was in the Eastern |
metropolis,- whence the company comes
direct. Mile. Morin, as a stage attrac
tion, is said to be one of the most
talented artists now before the public,
and in her particular line of entertain
ment to have no suj riur in any coun
try. Her first appearance in America
was made a few years ago in the bril
liant suceeaa "L'Enfant Prodigne,"
and Fince then she has done much
toward awakening interest in thepanto
mime, an Interest which had not been
very prominent until the advent of the
clever French woman.
Mile. Morin will open her engagement
here with the tragic pantomime by
Vance Thompson entitled "In Old
Japan." a wor". that has been decidedly
successful and was a feature of the
fashionable Waldorf-Astor entertain- j

pantomime is particularly Interesting
and tells of the old Japanese I .w which i
doomed the Empress to do herself to;
death when the Emperor died. She was
to suicide by means of harakiri, and j
the plot of the piece tells of the story
of Hui-Nina. the last Empress who
killed herself in honor of her lord.

who discovers her estranged parents
and reunites them, after jrearfl of sep

York," and has been produced in the
East to successful business. It is much
on the lines of Ada Lee Bascom'a
"Bowery Girl," and with the introduc
tion of bright specialties by Miss Le
Vyne, Williams and Casmore, and oth
ers, to say nothing of a fire scene and

Orpheum.
The new bill at the Orpheum will In- j
elude several new subjects in -lerner's i
visions of art which have attracted so â 
much attention and comment during
the past week. Mr. Kerner claims to '.
be able to produce even mare lifelike !
effects now that all the machinery is i
working: smoothly. Other new features
are John W. Ransome, the political
monologue artist, whose impersona- ;
tions of well-known politicians, par- i
ticularly Richard Croker, are well
known here. During this engagement
he will appear as Mark Ilanna, as Gov
ernor Budd and as General Fitzhugh
Lee. It is said that his impersonation
of Mark Hanna and the political talk
he gives as such is mirth-provoking in
the extreme.
Bngart and O'Brien, eccentric musical
artists, are also new. So are Hayes
and Bandy, who claim to do one of the
neatest and cleverest dancing turns
on the vaudeville stage. From last
-week's bill there have been retained
Lizzie B. Raymond, who will appear in
a new repertoire of songs; Reno and
Richards, the comedy acrobats, in a
new act; Fish and Quigg. the human
oddities, in a new act; Robetta and
Doreto, Chinese comedians, and Tony
Wilson and clown.
Alcazar.
"The Gay Parisians," a French farce
thai is a trifle wicked without being j
vulgar, is still the bill at the Alcazar,
where it draws crowded houses at :
every performance. The farce is one !
of the best of its type that has been !
done into English, full of more merit
and surprise and brilliantly construct
ed. The Alcazar company plays it in
a somewhat noisier key thap marked
the original Frohman production, but
the piece seems to stand for it and the
fun is not lost. With L. R. Stockwell

J*lnsica! Jtates.
William Armstrong of the Chicago
Tribune, and one of the foremost mu
sic critics of America, who is now here
on a flying visit, arranging for a series
of lectures to be given next season and
incidentally lecturing at the Stanford
University and in Oakland, pays the
following tribute to Fritz Scheel
through Alex T. Stewart's music col
umn in the Oakland Enquirer:
The orchestra that played in Oakland
last night was not, it seems, the regular
symphony orchestra. But with Fritz
Scheel at its head, it is one that may be
listened to with pleasure. Five years
ago. with his Hamburg orchestra, Mr.
Scheel made a tine impression in Chi
cago. To listen to his reading* last night
wa3 a renewed pleasure. The man is so
thoroughly musical; ho has so much tem
perament. To hold topothf-i the forces
that he conducted last night and to get
the effects that he did must amuse in
creased regard. With an organization of
men engaged exclusively for concert
work, playing only under one conductor,
musical results are far easier to obtain,
but Mr. Scheel obtains these musical re
sults under adverse circumstances, and
in that very point he proves his worth.
In summing up the situation, indeed, a
long search would be necessary to find
a man so well fitted for the present work
as Mr. Scheel. * â¢ â¢ It is a pleasant
thing to congratulate San Francisco on
its symphony orchestra, and both Oak
land and that city in its claim upon so
valuable a conductor.
Mr. Armstrong will lecture in Oak
land on Monday evening at the Uni
tarian Church, his subject being "Un
published Interviews With Great Mu
sicians." The lecture will be supple
mented with a short vocal and instru
mental programme, largely made up of
American composers and interpreted
by Alex T. Stewart, John Metcalf and
Mrs. Alfred Abbey.
The Kneisel Quartet of Boston, com
posed of Franz Kneisel, first violin;
Otto Roth, second violin; Loi'is Sveeen
ski, viola, and Alwin Schroeder, 'cello,
wiil give three chamber concerts at
Sherman & Clay Hall on Monday
and Wednesday evenings, May 16 and
18, and Saturday afternoon, May 21.
The fame of the Kneisels is world-wide
and their concerts here promise to
make a record in local musical his
tory.
The twelfth and final concert of the
; present season of the Symphony So
i ciety takes place on Thursday next, at
3:15 at the Tivoli. A magnificent pro
, gramme has been arranged as a fitting
close of the most successful symphony
1 season ever given in this city. The nov-
e lty will be the first performance in this
city of the symphony "Harold in Italy."
by that master of orchestration. Hector
Berlioz. This symphony was written
at the instigation of Paganini, who
desired a composition in which to
i show his skill on the beautiful but
rare instrument for soloists, the viola,
or alto The part of Harold in this
! work is taken by the solo viola and
| Bernat Jaulus has been selected for the
task. The sympljony is in four parts.
Another notable work on the pro
: gramme is Tschaikoweky's serenade for
j strings. Thp "Kaiser March" by Wag
\ ncr, and Weber's "Jubel" overture,
which closes with the hymn that we
i Americans call "America," will end and
; commence the concert.
Jaznea A.*Keane, a young actor of
this city, who more than once haa fig
ured prominently in local amateur per
formances, is now a member of James
O'Neill's company. The Portland crit
ics are enthusiastic in praise of his
conception of Albert (Mercedes 1 son) in
"Monte C'risto," the critic of the- Ore
gonian saying that the part could
hardly be better played by any one.

by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north

EASTERN
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 30.â There was quite an
extensive taking of profits to-day after the
three days' advance in prices. The realizing j
sales clipped off something from the day's ex- ;
treme advance, leaving net gains in the rail- i
'road list mostly fractional. In some of the
specialties, notably Sugar, there remained over i
a point of net gain. The bull leaders this |
morning had to face the sentimental effect of i
early declines for Americans In London, ex- I
tending to nearly a point in some cases. This !
meant that any advance in the prices hare
would have to carry the burden of arbitrage J
pales. Prices were, however, bid up at every â 
appearance of confidence and the offerings of
the arbitrage brokers were quickly absorbed.
Sugar mounted -nearly 5 points and other lead- j
Ing speculative stocks a point or over. The
safe arrival vof the steamship Paris was ad- |
duced as > a bull . argument, and there were
vague rumors circulated that private informa- â 
tion had been received in the street that the
United States squadron had already fought a !
successful engagement off the Philippines. The 1
aggressive leadership of the big bulls, coupled ,
wi'h the rumors, kindled 'the enthusiasm oi \
buyers, and the small -â¢ trailer*) followed the
lead of the biff ones. . Quite a fair amount of
commusslon-liouse buying: was also done. But
â¢while busint-BS was still active and on a largo '
scale : stocks - began to be supplied. . The offer- j
ings 'were sufficient , to feed the i demand and |
crices ceased to advance and before long com- j
menced â  â  retrograde â  movement. Before the
reaction ; Mad . passed . far the supply ceased.;
Meantime !i handsome â¢ total of stocks had been
market e<l at the advance and sellers felt the
comfortable assurance that their paper profits
had beenturneil. Into cash in the event of an
unfavorable-turn in events over Sunday. There
"!' i m c renewal of the buying demand in the i
second hour, but It did not reach larse pro- j
PO The ' n market for stocks and bonds in the early
days of the. week was the dullest and narrow
.f< that has been seen in years. On Wednes
day the agcregatc sales of all stocks fell to
Ipss than s-I.COo fhares. In so dull a market
here Is â¢ usually- a" natural tendency . of prices
to blit But .there was a marked disposition
In thf ' market .to resist any : downward tend
>ncy ' duTto the conditional orders in brokers'
Offices to buy stocks on any sharp decline.. The
SSdrÂ«B of prices encouraged a powerful co-
I terie of professional operators to enter the mar
i ket for a bull turn. This commenced operations
jon Thursday. The arguments they offered, to
j justify the advance were the naval victory by
the United States squadron off the Philippines
was reasonably certain and the shelling of the
Spanish works at Matanzas had conclusively
demonstrated the skill and superiority of
United States gunners and suns. Both of
these factors, It was argued, grave potent prom
ise in the early success of the United States
arms.
The general public showed no signs of a
] purpose to put their money Into the stock
market under the aggressive leadership de
veloped by the bull coterie. Undoubtedly the
underlying cause of the recovery in prices Is
I the more assured condition In the money mar
j ket and the improved business situation. The
, future of the money market has hinged for
; some time on the action of the Government
| for a. war loan. The consultation of the Sec
: retary of the Treasury with a number of lead-
Ing financiers served to clear the situation.
The success of the proposed loan at 3 per
cent was felt to be assured and the plans
for disbursment seemed to be sufficient to
guard against sudden contractions and strin
gency. This was felt to give promise of easier |
conditions in the money market, where re- i
j serves have been closely held and accommo- â 
j dations much restricted for some time past in
I anticipation of the demand for the Govern
! ment loan. The actual conditions in the money j
| market have In fact, become appreciably eas- i
i ier during the week, and the rate for time !
i loans was shaded from 6 to 5% per cent. The j
I continued demand from the interior for money j
i Is attributed to the desire of Interior banks to |
be prepared to meet the reducements of their
depositors who subscribe to the bond isso*.
Foreign exchange rose sharply early In the
! week, but has lost a great part of the gain,
I and engagements of gold for import were made
I yesterday and to-day. The strength In ex
! change early In the week Is said to have been
j due to some unexpected payments abroad by
the Government and to delay in the receipts
j of commercial bills against grain shipments.
The settlements are coming forward all the
! time and the demand , for exchange from Im
porters is, at this time, small. Another feature
1 in the exchange situation is -worthy of con-
I sideration. The war has largely curtailed the
j prospective traveling abroad by Americans thlÂ«
year, whose annual expenditures are estimated
at as high as $100,000,000. A feature of the
week has been the strength of silver on de
mand from India and from France. The tak
ings by France are believed by some authori
ties to be on account of Spain.
The downward tendency of railroad bonds
has been arrested and some Issues have im
proved during the latter part of the week on
an increased trading.
United States new 4s have advanced 1%,
and the 5s (coupon) %7 while the old 4s (regis
tered) have declined Vi per cent In the bid j
price. Others were unchanged. I

ASSOCIATED BANKS* STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. April 30.â The Financier says:
The bank statement for the week ending April
|Q presents no features of interest beyond the
continued gains shown in the surplus reserve,
which now approximates $44, 500,000. On Febru
ary 2') the reserve of the Clearing-house As
sociation consisted of $56,076,000 legals and $119,
1K6.0W specie, a total of $20.",252,000. On April
&'> the cash holdings were made up of $158,392,-
WO specie and $Â£0, 737,700 legal*, or a total of
$200,130,500.
In a period of but little over two months
therefore, the banks have lost $30,339 000 legal
tenders and gained $39,206,000 gold. Their total
ea*h holdings an; $4.0(10,000 heavier than at the
close ttt February, but in the same time they
have decrease^ their loans 171,680,000, and theii
deposits (70,711.000. This will give an Idea
of the general liquidation that has been in
progress !or sixty day?.
The conversion of sterling bills Into gold im
ports accounts in learge part for the loss of
loans. The decrease In deposits has been influ
enced by the demands of interior institutions.
The loss of loans and deposit* almost coun
terbalance, but ihe reserve requirements of
the banks have been reduced J17.0C0.000, so that
with but ?4.0(i0.0<'0 more cash on hand than re
ported sixty days ago, the surplus holdings
are over $21,C00,000 greater. In other words,
tho excess reserve Ik now $44,504,000. Sixty
days ago it was $22,359,325.
Tne Issue of a Government loan will largely
reduce this amount, but It will not necessarily
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1898.
require a further contraction of the several
Important items of the banks. Up to the pres
ent time the New York institutions have been
taking care of their customers, but the amount
of new business has been almost nothing. Just
what percentages of reserve the interior banks
are now carrying is not known, but that they
are unusually heavy admits of no doubt. The
logical trend once the new bonds are issued
will be toward ai easier market for money.
This conclusion finds a basis in t.:e fact that
the cauntry is recovering from its fear of pos
sible consequences of war, and also in the
tendency of the banks to take out new circu
lation. The increase in that line during the
present month by the New Yosk banks has
been no less than $3.'0,000. The decline In the
price of bonds and the high rates for money
have been inducements which have lent to
this increase. Probably a fair percentage of
the new bonds will be used by the banks for
th-> same purpose, but only In case rates re
main firm.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 30.â Trading In Wheat to- |
day began very quietly at an advance of %c. â¢
Liverpool quoted spot grain unchanged, fu
tures %d higher. Weekly exports of 4,161,000
bushels had a good effect, and July, which i
started at 93% c, rallied to 94c. The strength j
| was only momentary, however, and July sagged
' to 93% c, yesterday's close. Beerbohm cabled
1 an estimate of the total week's shipment from j
' other countries to Europe that might also allay
; foreign fears for any stoppage of supplies,
' the authority in question placing the world's
j export at 8,800,000 bushels. Continental cables
showed %c lower at Paris and l%c advance at
Antwerp. The coarse grains, Corn and Oats, j
showed considerable independence and their
advancing tendencies helped Wheat. John j
Cndahy was credited with buying July to cover ,
short sales and afforded about the best sup- ,
port in the pits. Trade was really narrow and
: orders hard to execute. July closed with a net
: gain of 1%@1%c. May closed %c higher. ,
! Corn was firm and fairly active, but the ;
! advance was confined to %c for May and %c
Â°A very large business was transacted in the |
; Oats department. The main feature was the |
! covering by shorts and at times they had
trouble in buying. July closed %c higher
Provisions were strong from start to nnisn
1 and were at the top prices of the day as the
! session was ending. There was good buying.
I July Pork closed 25c higher; July Lard I<%O. \
i July Ribs closed 5c net higher.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been seven arrivals of coal from
Washington, with 19,395 tons; four from Brit
j ish Columbia, 13,252 tons; one from Australia,
j 3095 tons; one from Oregon, 450 tons; total, 36.
192 tons. The liberal deliveries . here lately
from the coast serve to keep our stocks in
yard Intact, so that the anticipated shortages
for May and June will not be realized; In fact,
foresighted buyers are ordering ahead of their
requiremerits, knowing that an overplus of^uel
is seldom regretted, whereas a deficiency is
disastrous. Just at this time it is really lu
dicrous to listen to the garbled arguments and
deductions arrived at by Importers and large
coal consumers as to the effect the American-
Spanish war will have on coal here, both as
to the supply, sources of delivery and the fu
ture prices which may rule. Some are as op
posite in character as the poles, some claim
a scarcity, others an oversupply by Importers
who look for high figures, some think that
market values will not be disturbed, others
I that war prices must rule. . If no final set
i tlement is arrived at within 'six months, and
a few speedy Spanish cruisers should be or
dered to police the Pacific, thus obstructing
Australian and British Columbian coal ship
ments, but one result, could ensue. The first
word of this sentence makes it all indefinite,
and the writer thinks It very Improbable.
[ Spain cannot afford to scatter her ships, and
we are too far removed from the base of opera
tions, besides we are well able to care for our
interests here If we ever come to close quar
ters. The main problem to be solved now is:
Can foreign shipowners be forced to fulfill coal
charters signed prior to April 21? Opinions
differ on this point. The writer thinks they
can." !

BLOSSOM HAS
A QUEER DREAM
BY VERA CHISHOLM,
SAN FRANCISCO.
THE sun had just completed its
wandering Journey through the
fleecy and tangling clouds and
had sought comfort in the beam
ing west, and the dark folds of
evening had enwrapped the quiet little
village.
Upon the pathway which runs to the
brooklet lay tired little Blossom with
her mind in fairyland. She 'had
not had her tiny head a minute on the
grass when an old lady stood before
her. Blossom became frightened at
first because the old woman looked like
a witch.
"What brought you iiere?" cried the
wltc! in a terrifying voice, which made
little Blossom sigh.
"There are no sighs in Fairyland,
and if the wind should hear you he
would carry you beyond the fairy sea.
I want to know your name and whence
you came."
"I am Blossom. I lost my way and
can't get home."
"Never mind about that." replied the
disagreeable old witch. "Can you sing
anything?"
"I think I can," said little Blossom,
very nervously. "Mamma has taught
me one about the Childish Heart."
"That's enough; don't talk any more,
bu'. come along with me." Leading
Blossom bj the hand the witch set out
across beautiful paths of purple, gold
and silver. The little flowers bowed to
them as they passed the grand lawns
of Fairyland.
They had reached the golden palace,
which was decorated with silvery
laces.
The witch opened the palace door and
disappeared. Blossom looked around in
fright and saw, away up in the sky, the
witch riding on a large goose. Now,
Blossom knew very well that she had
had Mother Goose with her.
"Oh. how cross she was!" thought
Blossom, "I am well rid of her."
Blossom looked up the palace stair
case and a little fairy maiden came
running down to her.
"Come inside, my dear," said the lit
tle fairy, taking ho-ld of her soft little
hand as Blossom shyly stepped upon
the fairy carpet and soon found her
self face to Â£ace with the fairy queen.
A smile spread over Blossom's pretty
face as she looked upon the queen's
beautiful throne.
"Sing us a song, my dear," said the
queen. So Blossom sang her little
song.
"Ah, you shall have a reward," said
the queen, stepping forward from her
glittering throne and clasping little
Blossom in her gentle fairy embrace.
Blossom's face grew* crimson as her
heart was beating with content.
The queen promised Blossom that she
would show her something wonderful.
Leading Blossom by the hand down
the staircase and, followed by her little
fairy maidens, she entered the room of
diamonds. How queer it looked! Why,
therp was a little fairy man moving in
the air and swaying torchlights to and
fro. His eyes were glittering with fire.
Blossom saw little red men coming an
grily toward her. She screamed aloud
and looked around:
"Oh, where is the Queen of Fairy
land?" she cried.
THIS WAS OLD MOTHER GOOSE.
All had vaniÃhed. There was no+hing
but midnight around her.
DOTTY'S VISIT.
BY ALEXANDER HAMILTON,
RIO VISTA.
Dotty was the only child of rich
parents. She had every possible wish
granted to her by her father, but yet
one thing was lackingâ health. One
hot summer, when the air of the large
city became very close. Dotty became
very sick. The doctor said that she
must leave the smoky city and go to
breathe the fresh air of the country.
Mamma decided to take the little
girl to grandma's. How slowly the
weeks seemed to drag to Dotty after
that. But, after a few weeks, mamma
and Dotty were on their way to grand
ma's. Oh, what a pleasant time she
had hunting eggs and playing in the
hay. No more afternoons spent on the
lounge with a raging headache.
The only trouble was that the time
went too fast. When at last the sum
mer was over and mamma and Dotty
went back to the city, papa said that
although he had greatly missed his
little daughter, he was paid by seeing
the roses on her cheeks.
Very soon the boys and girls may be
asked to say what they would do if
they could be war commanders on land
or sea.
The Bumpkins have the war spirit
and are trying their luck with a bomb
throwing mortar at the Presidio. War
will furnish all the excitement the
lively little fellows can need.
SEA FIGHT.
OTTO CARMALT,
SAN FRANCISCO.
jvUST at sundown we sighted a Chl
1 nese junk. I was a boy upon my
Qj father's ship, the Four Winds. We
were sailing the China Sea. My father,
who was the captain as well as the
owner of the Four Winds, had been
cautioned to look out for Chinese pi
rates. His instinct told him that the
junk was filled with pirates.
The air was still; not a ripple upon
the water. The sun was hardly down
when the sea was made light by a full
moon. Then the jun\ got out big
sweeps and began to work her way to
ward us slowly. There was nothing to
do but to wait and make ready to re
ceive her. We had one deck c inon
and a full supply of Winchester rifles
and ammunition to suit. There were
twenty persons on the Four Winds, in
cluding the officers, cook and myself.
We all took Winchesters and stood be
hind a hastily thrown-up barricade of
lumber and some odds and endsâ all
excepting the cook and the second
mate, who volunteered to serve the
cannon.
It was near midnight when the junk
came near enough to hail us. T1 l en
the pirates opened proceedings by fir
ing a cannon ball in our direction. It
was aimed so low that it came skipping
along the water and bounded over our
barricade, dropping with a splash Into
the water beyond us.
"Fire!" shouted my father to the
cook.
Our cannon banged, and a "hot ball
struck the Junk fairly amidship, just
above the deck, and killing some of the
pirates and wounding several.
We cheered and the pirates yelled.
They must have been greatly excited,
for they rashly took to their boats to
board the Four Winds. Directly they
had a dozen boats in the water, all fill
ed with rascals armed to the teeth and
on they came 1 without ceremony, but
soon separated that they might sur
round our ship. We all held our fire
until they were near. My father scat
tered us about the vessel to do the best
work we could. Soon we were firing as
fast as we could and our work was very
good Every few seconds some one or
another of the pirates was hit. We
aimed for the rowers. Meanwhile the
cook and second mate loaded up the
cannon with slugs, pieces of old chain
and bullets of all sorts. Then they
wheeled the gun well forward, pointed
it toward the stern and threw An old
sail over it. We all saw that a "masked
battery" had been contrived for an
emergency. .
We could not keep the pirates off.
They did not return our fire but rowed
for the Four Winds as fast as ever
they could come. They were still two
to our one when we saw them coming
over the sides of our vessel. They were
reckless of life. As soon as they reach
ed our craft my father ordered us all
forward, where the cook's galley was
some protection. It was better that we
should stand together.
Across the deck toward us came the
pirates, led by a burly Lascar. Now
they began to fire and they succeeded
in picking off four of our best men.
They were about to overwhelm us,
w" en my father cried out:
"Unmask the battery. All not serv
ing the gun stanc c ar."
We understood and parted on either
THE CHINESE PIRATE JUNK.
side of the gun, from which the mask
ing sail had been removed, and left a
clear way for the cannon. The pirates
did not know <s hat -ye were up to and
paused. That was their undoing, for,
as they hesita.ed our cannon went off.
The chains and slugs and other mis
siles swept across the deck like furies
and half the pirates fell.
We seconded the work of the gun
with a lively popping of Winchesters.
The pirates who were able were at last
scared. They dropped over the side of
f 3 ship i to thur ioats and hurried
away to their junk. We were too busy
caring for our wounded men to fire at
them. So they were working their
sweeps to get away and they were

OLD PURITAN DAYS.
BY HARRIET S. SNYDER, SANTA CRUZ.
IN the old days, when America was
being settled, there lived. In Ply
mouth a couple of young lovers.
When they were children, playing
in the green lanes of old England,
Enos White and Priscilla May had, in
childish glee, pledged themselves
to each other. Now that they
were older and had, further
more, crossed the sea to this strange
new land, they still stood by the child
ish betrothal. They had come over in
the Mayflower.
Enos was a tall, manly, young fel
low, rather quiet; he was very stead
fast and honest. Priscilla was merry
and affectionate. In her childhood she
had been spoken of by the old people
as "Priscilla, the hoyden." She was
full of life and spirit, quite different
from the staid maidens by whom she
was surrounded.
Every evening Enos and she would
meet under an old pine. At last they
were married by the good old minister
in the little, bare, cold church. They
had a little girl when they had been
married about a year; a sweet, little
maid with big blue eyes and sunny
ringlets She was the idol of her par
ents. They called her Ruth. Soon
Ruth had a brother, Brian, who had
the dark hair and eyes of his father.
All these years wars with the Indians
had teen frequent, and Enos White
had in each case served gallnntly under
brave Captain Miles Standish.
One day, as he was working in the
field, the great church bell began to
toil. It was the signal that all the
men were to assemble fully armed.
Priscilla, as soon as she had heard the
bell, had taken out her husband's
sword. He had his gun with him; for
In those days men and women always
had to have a gun with them. As .soon
as he entered, he buckled on his sword
and, after tenderly kissing his wife and
babies, hurried away to the church.
He did not return. When Captain
Standish came back he had a sorrowful
tale for the young wife. He had seen
brave young Enos White fall in battle,
and had seen the Indians carry him
away. When he had finished the young
widow gave a piercing shriek, and fell.
When Priscilla awoke in the morn-
Ing her hair, which had been a beauti
ful brown, was snowy white. She
seemed to be out of her mind, and lay
staring blankly at a window, while
kindly neighbors performed her house
hold tasks. She remained in this stu
por for six or seven months, making
no sound and showing no interest in
the things about her. In the mean
time Ruth and Brian were cared for
by the neighbors.
One day, almost half a year from the
time she had heard of her husband's
death, Priscilla suddenly spoke.
"Look," she said; "look at the win
dow " and she lifted her arm. A man's
face was looking in. "It is Enos. He
Is come back. I knew he would!" Her
voice sank lower. "Will you please
open the door and let him in?" The
woman rose hasti'" and then ran to
tell the town that "Priscilla White has
spoken!" Â» Â» Â» Â»
In the meantime much -was happening
In the White home. As soon as the
women had gone, Priscilla called gently
"Enos, Enos, come in!" In a moment
he was beside her, and she was lifted
â¢ in his strong arms, while he murmured,
"My poor little Priscilla, 'my poor little
darling!"^ m.'m â¢ â¢
It was in the afternoon of the day fol
lowing the one on which Enos had re
turned. All the town had gathered to
hear Enos White tell how he had es
caped from the Indians, and how his
hair had become gray. This is his
story :
"When I was left by my comrades
I lay stunned, for I had. been hit by an
Indian club. The Indians came and
carried me away to their camp. Here
I was bound? to a tree, while the sav
ages danced around me. They then lay
down in a circle around me and slept.
Thus it was for many nights: I was
bound to a tree, while my guards sleot-
But one night an Indian brave slipped
from the circle of sleepers and severed
the cord that bound me. He then gave
me a large pair of moccasins that com
pletely covered my feet, wornout eshoes
and all, and motioned me to follow him.
"I did not know whether he was a
friend or not, but blindly did as I waa
bid. At last, as we were on a rising
knoll of ground, I saw his face. It was
the Indian to whom we had given food,
wife"â turning to Priscillaâ "when he
was almost famished. â 
"We traveled all night, and when day
came we lay down and slept. We had
plenty of provisions in my knapsack,
vhich my captors had allowed me to
retain; and it was. thus that we lived
for many days. We frequently dis
guised ourselves, and worked for farm
ers, who gave us food in return. We
traveled many days and many nights,
and at last, in many months' time, we
reached Plymouth. Now, Yellow Bull,
come forward and receive your Just
thanks!" â 
A tall, sinewy Indian came forward.
A strange scene was then enacted.
The moment the children saw him they
rushed forward and caught hold of his
long legs. The women blessed him,
and the men shook his hand warm
ly. Then they all partook of the feast
that Priscilla, with the help of the
neighbors, had prepared.
As for Yellow Bull, he stayed with
Enos and Priscilla until he died, ever
a loved and faithful friend. And it
soon became .common to see the tall,
thin Indian with a child on each knee,
telling them of their brave "daddy's"
journey home to them.
Here are Ruth and Dorothy,
They live in Berkel'ey-hy-the-sea,
The peaceful sea whose breezes fan
The cherry blossoms of Japan;
"Whose tides roll in against our door
Along the California shore.
And near to San Francisco town.
Where all the streets go up and down.
The lovely heights of Berkeley rise
As if they meant to touch the skies.
And big waves make a booming sound,
And roses blow the whole year round;
Where grows the fragrant laurel tree
Live little Ruth and Dorothy, -
In lovely Berkeley-by-the-sea.
These little girls wear "overalls"
For play-time, then if either falls
Right in thfe sand they never mind.
But just brush off what soil they find
And trot along all right again.
And no one laughs or scolds, and then â
They hunt for bugs and never know
Papa will take their pictures soâ
He steals along with his machine
Andâ there they areâ as I have seen.
My little Ruth and Dorothy
Who live in Berkeley-by-the-sea.

Conrad H;erman, Thomas' R. Hobson ajid
J. T. Sullivan. â¢ â  " ' .
The document is a lengthy one, filling
twenty-three pages of legal cap paper, in
which reasons are. given why "Mammy"
"be not. adjudged an insolvent debtor,
and that ihe prayeo 1 of the petitioners
herein be. denied, and that she have judg
ment herein in her. favor; and that she
have arid recover costs herein incurred,
a-nd also her attorneys' fees,- and for such
other relief as may be Just and proper in
the premises."
Of all the creditors named but one, ac
cording-to' "Mammy" , Pleasant, Is legiti
â¢ mately a creditor of- hers; and that one is
M. Seligman, to whom she says but $172 45
1b owing on a judgment against her in
the' Justices' Court in this city. One other
claim, that of Conrad Herman, differs
from the majority in that it has accrued
under a judgment against Mrs. Pleasant,
who has "within the statutory time af
ter the rendition of the said judgment
moved lor an order to grt. it her a new
trial." Consequently, the- answer goes on,
all proceedings have been stayed. Should
a new trial not be granted ."Mammy"
says she. will appeal to tnc Supreme Court
of this State.
The demands of all the other creditors,
whether tor goods or wares or merchan
dise delivered or money loaned or services
performed.-, are disposed of in one way.
Tne respondent denies that they were fur
nisned tv her, and says that the demands
consist "of a promise or agreement of the
respondent, wnlch was a special promise
or agreement to answer lur the debt of
one Theresa Bell, and that no note or
memorandum oi said promise or agree
ment was made in writing and signed by
i > spondent or by any cither person by
Her authority or at ail."
Not more than fcWO, "Mammy" deolares,
is tne amount of her indebteuness. She
uenies that ncr place oi ousint-ss is lobl
Getavia street, or that she is or has been
in DUUiness mere or. at. any other place.
Tne most interesting part of the docu
ment pertains to theSlZff alleged to be
out- fh'o&as K. Hobson, to whom Lucius
L. Solomons assignee Dis claim. This
;_.,.â > ".Mammy" Fteasant's version of

of mo^ey : , represe,ntlng to his client that
by ma-king a favorable showing to his
creditors lie -could plat-ate them; that, |
j teWiugf.tb his imporiuinties, and having I
treat <ji.iqtiden.ee and implicit trust in him i
as her attorney and adviser, Mrs. Pleas
ttUt conveyed to Lucius L. Solomons this

was a mortgage or >15,tAK) on condition
that the dfeeq snoulil not be recorded for I
' twelve, months, "if oecorded at all," and
that a reconveyance of the property
should be' made .to "Mammy" Pleasant at
the end. of that time. But -on August 21,
is; 1 ?, thÂ« Cited was recorded, and on Oc
tober 2S Solomons executed a deed of trust
for thi'rf [iropert\ - to J Larry Block and Ben
jamin Harris to secure a promissory noie
for $40yy. . This deed was recorded Feb
ruary 17-1898: "Mammy" swean that .she
was. not aud has not been since indebted
to -Solomons tor any sum of money wnat.- j
soever, and that f'sald conveyance was!
wholly without cons^-.eration."
Mrs. Pleiisaut denies that she "willfully
suftfrreO- judgment to be taken against her
by default in favon of M. Seligman. On
the contrary, she asserts that the judg
ment was obtained owing:, to the inad
vertence and excusable neglect of the
respondent. She denies intent to defraud
ln tlie conveyance of property or that she
contemplates any such fraudulent trans
fer or- conveyance. Of the deed to Mrs.
Theresa Bell of over half of the 1^55 acres
of the Belletane ranch, at present .?ased
by R. Porter Ashe, for the Ruinart stock
farm, Mrs. Pleasant admits that on Feb
ruary 26, IS9B, at Sajita Rosa, a deed was
recorded from her to Theresa Bell, but
she denies that she caused it to be re
corded. The consideration was $20,000,
which "Mammy" owed to Mrs. Bell. The
<teed was made September 2~>, 1*95, ac
knowledged September 28, and after this,
and long prior to February 26, 1898, it
was delivered to Mrs. Bell. "Said con
veyance," the document recites, "was not
made with any Intent to hinder or delay
or defraud her creditors, but was made
in good .faith."- At the time of making
the deed, none of the petitioners, she says,
were creditors of- hers. She avers that
they had "both actual and constructive
notice of said transaction prior to the
recordance."
The lengthy answer concludes with a
general -denial of the charge that It is
"Mammy's" custom whenever she is sued
to conceal herself to avoid the service of
legal process, that she conceals her prop
erty to avoid Its being attached on legal '
process or that she is now removing
property for the same purpose.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
Lack of Money Makes a
Mineral Display at
Omaha Doubtful.
The Precious Metal Yield of the
Last Year as Reduced by
DroughtâNotes.
Whether California shall make a min
eral display at the Trans-Mississippi Ex
position is a question that remains an
open one, with the chances being that
it will be decided in the negative soon.
The magnificent collection in the Mining
Bureau is available for shipment almost
in its entirety, and it could be re-enforcod
by a great many contributions from
throughout the State, but to box, ship,
install and care for the display would
cost several thousand dollars, and the
question is, Where is the money to mmc
from? The absence of any visible source
of this important supply is Â«vhat makes
the question doubtful. *
This State should make a creditable
mineral display or none at all. It needs
to be installed in an attractive way, with
proper spectacular trimmings, and all
that costs money. The Legislature is to
be asked to provide for a State mineral
exhibit at Paris, but there are no public
funds available for the Omaha show.
David T. Day, chief of the division of
technology and statistics of the United
States Geological Survey, and who is in
charge of the mining building at the
Omaha Exposition, while here recently,
endeavored to stir up enthusiasm, and
three commissioners were appointed.
These commissioners have not arrived at
anything definite. Mr. Day wants to
place a terra-cotta cast of the Marshall
monument in a commanding position on
the mining building, as a compliment to
California, and a New Jersey terra-cotta
firm has offered to make the cast if the
original molds are lent to it. It has been
found that some of the molds have been
broken and that to make new ones would
be expensive, so that it is doubtful if even
this contribution can be made.
The official estimate of the gold pro
duction of the State for 1897, placing it
at $15,871,401, will be disappointing to
many. Mr. Tale's estimate for 1896 was
$17,181,562, and this is the record for that
year adopted by the State Mining Bureau,
but the estimate was greatly reduced by
the Director of the Mint. The reason for
the reduction is wholly the short supply
of water throughout the greater part of
the mining regions during most of the
latter half of the yeur. Scores of im
portant quartz mines and many placer
mines were forced to close down for a
time or run on half time, und this condi
tion undoubtedly reduced the output by
$3,000,000 or $4,000,000. During the year
there were more new mines opened, old
mines rehabilitated and mills increased in
capacity than in any year of the last
twenty. Of course, a large part of this
new activity was spent in unproductive
development' work, but there were also
scores of mines that greatly increased
their scale of productive operations and
had the water supply remained normal a
large increase in the product would have
been shown. The coming year may be
expected to show the marked results of
the gold mining revival.
The Call yesterday published the record
of the State's gold production by coun
ties for 1897, as compiled by Statistician

At the first annual meeting of th ft
Mountain copper Company in London
recently. Chairman Keswick's statement
contained this estimate of the vast body
of ore In the company's great property
in Shasta County: "The body of ore
from v. rich we are at present drawing
supplies is the only one which has thus
f;ir been defined with fair accuracy, and
In it we have in sight 1,500,000 tons of
ore; but in addition to this quantity there
is the ore below our present lowest level,
the very large mass of ore we know exists
at the north end of our property (the
quality of which has still to be ascer
tained), and the other masses we hope
and expect to develop under the strong
outcrop which for more than four-fifths
oi its length has not yet been touched.
To the prospecting of these masses at
tention will this year be given as we have
opportunities, and as much Information
regarding quantity and quality obtained
as a moderate outlay wiil procure."

According to the Amador Ledger, the
Oneida crosscut at the 1500 level en
countered the ledge at a distance of 255
feet from the shaft. The ledge is about
two and a half feet thick and some parts
of it are very good, showing free gold
and an abundance of sulphurets. Man

south in the ledge. In the crosscut in
gieenstone and hard, gray slate about
260 feet was made in one month. Three
shifts of four men each did the work with
two power drills.

The miners in the Defiance mining dis
trict, in San Diego County, are endeavor
ing to secure a right of way from the
mouth of San Mateo canyon to the rail
road, says the Fallbrook Observer. This
would enable them to ship out ore and
ship in a smelter and supplies. A good
mining camp at that place would be a
good thing for this county, but the camp
can never develop without a good wagon
road leading down to the railroad on the
cuatt. The men interested in the mines
are willing to construct the road if the
tounty will but furnish the right of way.
Tiie assays made on ore from the differ
ent ledges running through the Defiance
district show the ore to be remarkably
rich, particularly in copper, gold and
silver. It is proposed to send several
carloads of the ore to the Solby smelter
at San FFancisco as soon as possible, for
a thorough test. Every one who visits |
the canyon is surprised at the depth and
width of the ledges, and notices that all
the claim holders there are doing a vast
amount of work on their property.
State Senator E. W. Chapman of El i

The Southern Pacific Company is con
structing twenty-five more tank cars to
be used in the transportation of oil from
Los Angeles to San Francisco, says the
Los Angeles Times. They have, at the
present time, about 100 tank cars in use,
fifty of which are the property of the
company, tho remaining fifty being leased.
The new ones will have a capacity of 130
barrels each, equal to about 6000 gallons.
At the present rate of 51 cents a barrel,
charged by the company for the haul
from Lob Angeles to San Francisco, the
gross freight per car is $68 35. The sec
retary of the oil producers' trustees re
ports shipments for San Francisco going

average.
It is reported by the Los Angeles Times
that some Chicago people have organized
under the name of the Sierra Madre Oil
Company of Chicago, and that they have
purchased 1000 acres of land in the San

from Newhall, on which they propose to
drill for oil for refining purposes. The
president of the company is stated to be
Franklin Head, and the vice-president A.

The Yreka Journal gives the following
notes of mining progress iTF Slskiyou
County:
The Gold Ball Mining Company at Sal
mon River finished a crushing of 500 tons
of quartz last week, the clean-up amount
ing to close on $6000. It is expected future
crushings will pay better as the new
company develops the mine toward doing
better and quicker work. Brown & Reed
er, who have a quartz ledge in Fools
Paradise district on Shasta River pound-
I ed out 45^ pounds of quartz in a hand
i mortar last week and realized $500. They
i have fifty tons on hand to crush, and feel
confident of taking out a large quantity
of gold when the final clean-up is com
pleted. Parties from below offered $JO.OOO |
for a mine on Patterson Creek, Scott Val- |
ley, but when ready for making out pa- I
pers the mine-owners backed out; at
least such a report is circulated by reli
able parties, and that a lawsuit may oc
cur. The second elevator has been put
down in the Eastlick and "Wright mines
at Oro Fino, recently purchased by a San
Francisco company, and the work of get
ting out the pay gravel is carried on with
energy. The season's run will be short
owing to the lack of snow and rain, but
the company expects to do well next
winter. The claim is fitted up in fine
style for good Working While there is a
supply of water, and the owners will make
more improvements on ditches and reser
voirs on the Salmon Mountains toward in
suring a better supply of water next sea-
It' is an ill wind that blows no good. |
I The extremely dry season has done much '>
\ damage, but th.c streams will be unusual
ly low this year, and miners are taking â 
I advantage of the unusually favorable con- |
| ditions to work the deep channels. Within
the last few days a number of locations
by different companies have been filed
in the office of our County Recorder, !
claiming portions of the channel of the
middle and north forks of the American
River. Twenty-nine thousand feet of
these channels were taken up in a few
j days, and some claims have also been filed
on the South fork of the American.â iÂ£l

The Omaha Mining Company has levied
an assessment of 50 cents a share.
As a. mining country we belieya the
northern part of Wyoming, in the Wind
River section, is the coming boom of the
Rocky Mountain region, says the Western
Mining Journal of Salt Lake City. At
present it is closed in by the Shoshone
Indian Reservation, but experienced pros
pectors who have dared to venture in
there Pay it is a rich region for gold
quarts and placer diggings. The Indians
will not allow any one to prospect or mine
upon their territory, knowing full well its
value as a mineral section.
There, are 2246 mines in Colorado being
actively worked and producing ore. There
were 3066 mining companies incorporated
between 1593 and 1897.
The report now comes from the famous
pacers of East Siberia, that a valuable
gold nugpet was found in theso diggings
on the 10th of last January weighing
seventy-four and one-half pounds, avoir
dupois, and the largest ever found. At
this weight the nugget would be 1192
ounces, and at $20 an ounce would make
the nugget worth $23,840. These placers
art owned and being operated by a Rus
sian company.
The famous Tom Boy mine at Telluride,
Colo., is again being worked.
E. Braiien, assayer in charge of the
United States assay office at Hel
ena, Montana, estimates that from
1881 to the end of 1897 the Butte
mines produced the following values:
Gold, $11,118,075 74; silver, $148,883,234 29;
copper, $225 .055,467 02; total, $355 ,086.777 05.
Some, one who has given the matter con
siderable attentive detail figures that it
last year cost 90 cents to produce a dollar
of gold in California, and that the same
amount produced in Alabama cost $3 05
and in Wyoming $5 56. It is also stated
that in Colorado it cost but 50 cents to
produce a dollar, and In Montana 45
cents. These figures are never authentic
and rarely trustworthy. It has been as
sumed by those who have given the mat
ter considerable attention In every age,
and in every nation and community, that
every dollar of gold produced costs a
dollar. This rule probably holds good in
all localities, except the Klondike, where
each dollar produced probably cost $5,
leaving out the immediate loss of life
and the slower suicide of thousands more.
âMining and Scientific Press.
The London Daily Mail's correspondent
at Odessa sends some notes of a conver
sation with a veteran Siberian gold dig
ger of great wealth from Tomsk, the chief
center of a gold-producing district very
like Klondike. He predicts a great future
for gold mining in Siberia, as the sur
face has so far only been scratched.
Towns are springing up like mushrooms
and the population increasing by leaps
and bounds. The Government stipulates
that all gold gathered be- assayed at its
offices and that 10 per cent of the net pro
ceeds goes to the crown. Otherwise every
one, including foreigners, has absolute
freedom to work his claim as it pleases
him. Up to the present only primitive
methods have been employed by the ma
jority of prospectors, but now, thanks to
the energetic action of the Russian Gov
ernment, a new gold mining era has
begun.
Opinions differ in Butte as to the effect
of the war on the price of copper. Sev
eral prominent mining men, like Mr.
Wethey, believe the price will decline,
while others just as firmly maintain that
it will advance, inasmuch as the metal
will be used for waj purposes. During
the past month 3000 tons more copper were
produced in the United States than in
the preceding month, and the price has
acivanted.â Western Mining World.
The Cripple Creek. Colo., mines have
turned out a total of $34,500,000 of gold
since IS9T.
"Mrs. Mitchell," says the Western Min
ing World, "the 'copper queen' of Utah
i.Â« temporarily in the city." She is in
teresHec in some excellent copper propo
sitions at Bingham. A lady of rare at
tainments, Mrs. Mitchell is well versed
in mineralogy and kindred sciences, and
is giving a great deal of thought to the
economical treatment of low grade ores
by chemical processes.

DICK WILLIAMS
GETS ONE YEAR
Judge De Haven Disregards the
Jury Recommendation
to Mercy.
And Imposes the Maximum Penalty
Upon the Ex-Chinese Inspector
for Extortion.
Richard S. Williams, ex-Chinese inter
preter for the Chinese Bureau, appeared
yesterday morning with George D. Col
lins, his counsel, in the United States Dis
trict Court, for sentence on the conviction
of having extorted $100 from Wong Sam
to secure the landing of a Chinese immi
grant at this port.
Mr. Collins made an argument of two
hours' duration in support of his motion
for a new trial on the ground that the
court erred in excluding and admitting
certain testimony and in refusing to read
to the jury certain instructions asked for
by Mr. Collins. That gentleman produced
several law authorities to show that the
rejected instructions word for word had
been approved by the Supreme Court.
Deputy United States Attorney Schlesin
ger showed that Judge de Haven had in
structed the jury on the points cited, but
had seen fit not to use the wording or the
rhetoric prepared for him by the prison
er's counsel.
Judge de Haven remarked that it was
not necessary that the court should use
the exact language of instructions pre
pared by counsel. It sutticed that the
ideas should be given, the language not
being material s > long as the proper
ideas were presented Intelligibly to the
jury.
The motion for a new trial was denied,
and Williams was directed to stand and
receive sentence. After remarking that
the jury had recommended the prisoner
to the mercy of the court. Judge de Haven
said that while ordinarily he was dis
posed to give great weight to recommen
dations for mercy, he did not find in this
case anything in the evidence upon which
to base such recommendation, and he felt
it to be his duty to impose the maximum
penalty, namely, one year's imprisonment
in the County Jail of San Francisco.
Mr. Collins gave notice that he would
appeal.
Another Chance for Art Lovers.
Owing to the great public interest man!
fested in the exhibition now being held,
for the benefit of the California Woman's
Hospital, at the Mark Hopkins Institute,
it has been decided to keep the exhibition
open for another week. Mrs. K. 11. Hatch,
vice-president of the beneficiary hospital,
reports that the attendance has been
daily increasing since the opening of the
magnificent collection of miniatures, etc.,
and that yesterday the handsome home
of art on the hill was crowded to t:
doors. The musical programmes, under tne
direction of Henry Heyman, are not tne
least of the many attractions offered.
