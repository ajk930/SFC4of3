VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO 89.
FIRST COMES AN
INVESTIGATION
AT CAMP THOMAS
Conditions at ChicKamauga Not
Properly Regulated by the Sur
geons if) Charge.
W^y General Sternberg Did Not Protest Against
tr;e Unheard-of Crowding of Troops
Must Be Exolained.
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â The Herald's I
"Washington correspondent sends the
following: After persistent represen
tations as to the shortcomings in the
department of the surgeon general and j
other departments, an Investigation has
been ordered. It is not yet as general j
â¢ in its nature as it will be when more
facts are brought to the attention of
the administration, but a distinct order
has been sent to Brigadier General H.
. V. Boynton at Chickamauga. to find
out what is the basis of the compUi it .
â¢ there and who is to blame. Acting Sec
retary of War Meikeljohn said to-day:
"In view of the statements that have j
been published about Camp Thomas j
.the surgeon general has requested that j
an investigation be made, and it has i
â¢ been ordered. General Boynton ha.->
been conducting the investigation all
day. and as soon as a report is com- j
pieted it will be forwarded to the Sec- j
retary of War and will be made pub- j
lie." *
I was assured to-day by a high offl
. clal of the War Department that some
of the medical officers s>Â» Camp Thomas
were remiss in their duty, and if the ,
report of Gem al Boynton fixes the re- j
spoosibility, the party or parties named \
. will be immediately brought to trial by
court-martial. Speaking of this in- ;
vestigation. Surgeon General Sternberg
â aid to me there had been more <
Sickness at Chickamauga than at j
any other camp. The investigation
therefore under General Boynton will
â¢be far reaching, as the natural sur
roundings at Chickamauga were such
as is thought to be conducive to health. ;
â¢ Notwithstanding the practice during
the Civil War of keeping men In camp
continuously only for about a week and j
of putting them together in number not j
to exceed a division, 40,000 men have
been crowded together in the Chicka
â  rjÂ»mi-> for nÂ«-a.rly three months.
The inquiry will proceed first upon this
basis-:
To discover why the protest of Sur
geon General Sternberg has not been
forthcoming against such an unheard j
of disposition of troops for so long a ,
.time. The next line of Investigation j
will be the hygienic details of the camp. I
The investigation, moreover, will rest
upon specific and perfectly authenticat
ed complaints.
. The percentage of fever cases will be
compared with those of other camps
and the number of nurses and doctors
will be duly noted, and if not found to
be sufficient the finding will be em
bodied in the report. For example, at
Camp Thomas, where there were 40,- |
000 troops, according to General Stern
berg's statement there were only
thirty-eight nurses. The doctors were
in proportion. Complaints, therefore,
from there have been so clear and pro
nounced that it is thought the root of
â  the evil may be most quickly found, as
far as the volunteer camps are con
cerned.
After investigating Camp Thomas it
is expected other camps will be investi
gated. But it will not stop in this
country. There will be a board ap
pointed to review the conditions and
â¢ treatment of the sick in Santiago, and
sensational findings are expected to re
sult under the investigations of this
board.
TO ALLEVIATE THE
SUFFERING IN CAMPS 1
i
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27.â Some state
ments made at the War Department
to-day indicate that efforts are making
to alleviate the suffering in the camps.
The surgeon general reports that up to
the Bth day of August there had been
sent to Chickamauga Camp 3428 cots
and bedsteads, 6536 gray blankets, 7399
cotton sheets and 3250 mosquito bars.
. Another statement shows the number
of nurses which have been provided for
the different camps where hospitals are
established, as follows: Fort Myer,
Va., 63; Fort McPherson, Ga., 10 en
route, 46; Fort Thomas, Ky., 5 en route,
. 13; Fort Monroe, Va., 38; hospital ship

In addition to the foregoing list there
are over 6000 workers of the hospital
corps whose services are available as
â¢nurses.
NURSES NEEDED BY
SICK ARTILLERYMEN
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 27.â The fol
lowing telegram has been received by
the secretary of the Board of Trade
from Surgeon H. M. W. Moore, Bat
tery H, First Ohio Volunteers, at Camp
Thomas, Ga.:
"Can Columbus send two nurses at
once to acompany sick men of Battery
H home from camp? We change sta
" tion soon, and I am unwilling to leave
them here and cannot take them on
the troop trains. Government furnishes
transportation and sleeping cars. No
nurses available here."
Arrangements are now being made to
Bend the nurses.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., Aug. 3Z.â
The San Francisco Call
The exact number of sick men in Bat
tery H, First Ohio Volunteer Light Ar
tillery, cannot be learned at this hour,
but it is and has been for several days
rather large. The request of Surgeon
Moore of the battery for nurses from
Columbus and from Cleveland, in which
he states that none can be secured
here, meant none available to accom
pany the sick home. There are plenty
of nurses here, but none can be spared
to make the long trip.
MANY OF THEf "SICK"
SUFFERED FROM HUNGER
NEW YORK. Aug. 27.â Some of the
nursea in the general hospital camp at !
Camp Wikoff are suffering from dys- i
entery, and orders were issued to-day I
that they be given more time to exer- !
cisc, bathe and rest. More nurses ar- !
rived to-day, and ten more will soon
reach the camp, ready to take the '
places of those overworked. All that I
are needed are here. There are three j
male and three female nurses in each j
ward during the daytime and two on
duty at night.
When the Eighth Ohio was landed I
nearly 300 men were reported sick and
Bent to the hospital, but it developed
that 170 of the "sick" were only suffer
ing from hunger. When these men were
fed they were able to leave the hospi
tal. They repeated stories of hardships
encountered coming up from Cuba, and
said it was almost impossible for them
to get food. One hundred and fifty men I
in the general hospital were allowed to
go on sixty days' furlough to-day, as
they had improved.
The Second Massachusetts, -when it
departed, left behind seven officers and
200 sick men in the hospitals. Alto
gether 560 men departed. As the men
marched to the dock 100 men dropped
out of line, but were aided by their
comrades and urere thus able to con
tinue until the boat was reached.
The hospital report at Camp Wikoff
to-day was as follows: Cases In the
general hospital, 1120, of which 125 are
typhoid: cases in the detention hospi
tal, 430; diphtheria in the detention
hospital, 4; in the general hospital, 1.
Deaths: Edgar H. Train, Second
Massachusetts, typhoid fever; Charles j
Flynn, Company C, Twelfth United
States Infantry, typhoid fever.
ONLY ARMY RATIONS
FOR SICK SOLDIERS
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â When the
transport Yucatan reached the pier to
day and began to discharge the six
companies of the Seventh United States
Infantry which she had 'brought from
Sanitiago, it was learned that seven
men had died on the passage and three
more had died last night while the
ship lay in the bay awaiting her turn
to unload her human cargo.
The Yucatan had 200 sick men on
board. It is alleged that the ship left
Santiago without a sufficient quantity
of proper food or supplies for the sick,
and that she reached here without any
food but army rations, which the sick
troopers were unable to eat. When
General Wheeler learned of this state
of affairs he at once sent on board
some proper supplies. The sick men
are still on board the vessel, waiting
until there is room for them in the
hospitals.
PRESENT A SORRY
SPECTACLE INDEED
NEÂ»W LONDON, Conn., Aug. 27.â The
sound steamer Block Island arrived at
her slip in this city about 9:30 o-'clock
this morning from Montauk, bearing
350 members of the Second Massachu
setts Regiment, United States Volun
teers, from Camp Wikoff. The men as
a rule presented a sorry spectacle.
Some idea of their condition may be
had from the statement of one of them
that in one company alone. Company
B, but thirteen men were able to walk
from their tents to the boat. Accom
panying the troops were thirteen offi
cers out of thirty-six who left Massa
chusetts when the regiment started for
the front.
PATIENTS BROUGHT
ON THE CATANIA
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27.â The sur
geon general of the army received a
telegram this morning from Sergeant
Ireland, at Montauk Point, saying that
the steamship Catania arrived there
yesterday from Santiago with 353 con
valescent patients from the Slboney
hospital and that nine deaths occurred
on the trip. He also reports that Major
McCreary, surgeon, U. S. A., died on the
Catania on the morning of the 23d inst.
from dysentery, following yellow fever,
and was buried at sea. Major Mc-
Creery was a native of New York.
MANY FEVER CASES

GROSS MISMANAGEMENT
OF THE CAMPS WHERE
SICK SOLDIERS SUFFER
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â A Camp
Alger, Va., special to the Herald
says: Some startling facts as to
the management and conduct of the
First Division Hospital will likely
be made public soon, unless report
of Dr. Vaughn. Dr. Shakespeare and
Dr. Reed, -who constitute the board
of visiting surgeons, is withheld.
These physicians were instructed to
make a thorough inspection of all
the army camps. They began their
labors at Camp Alger. There they
found that for weeks a condition
existed that can only be attributed
to gross mismanagement, negligence,
indifference and absolute disregard
of all ideas of humanity. According
to the statement of a regimental sur
geon who has in the past been on
duty at division hospitals, the three
physicians made a thorough inspec
tion and gleaned information that
caused one of them to remark:
"There will be other linen to wash
besides typhoid."
My informant said: "An alarm
ing state of affairs has existed for
some time, and while things have
improved since the visit of the three
physicians, yet there is room for
more. Prior to the visit carelessness
and indifference were manifestâ
conditions that would not be toler
ated in a well-regulated and prop
erly governed hospital."
RECEIVING HOSPITAL AND DISINFECTING BOATS AT MONTAUK.
This Is the Point at Which All Troops Bound for Camp Wikoff Are Landed From the Transports.
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â A Camp
Thomas, (Ga.) special to the Herald
says: Major Parker of the Twelfth
New York, acting inspector general of
Camp Thomas, to-day reported offi
cially to General Breckinridge. by his
order, on the sanitary conditions of the
camp. The report, which is a comDlete
statement of the conditions of the
camp, and the causes leading up to the
unusual death rate, advises the aoan
donment of the camp. In the report
Major Parker says:
"The number of sick men in this
camp increases each week by one
fourth. At this rate of progression, the
sick will soon reach a number which,
with the present facilities, it will \nt
impracticable to handle.
'This park, I think it can be shown,
is? not fitted to be a camping place tor
troops. The park is mainly a fortst
with occasional openings only. Such
camps are not healthy. Being very
largely in the shade, the tents and
ground around them remain damp.
The sanitary action of sunlight on
germ organism is shut off. The park
is incurably infected. Every breeze
carries a stench. The sick report
mounts up day by day. General
lassitude is apparent in the men and
omcers. The months in which typhoid
fever and malaria are most common
are at hand. The cases of typhoid
fever have reached 500, and the whole
situation presages a general epidemic.
"Under the circumstances detailed
above, no remedy exists except a gen
eral departure of the troops from this
place."
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: As a result of Secre
tary Alger's visit to Camp Wikoft
It has been decided to scatter the
troops now assembled at Montauk
Point as quickly as passible.
I am informed on good authority
that Secretary Alger is now con
vinced that the plan of making
Camp Wikoff a permanent encamp
ment is Impracticable, and that aa
rapidly as possible the regiments
now here, not alone the volunteers,
but regulars also, will be ordered
away to different sections of the
country.
I am told that both President Mc-
Kinley and Secretary Alger are of
the opinion that a mistake was
made in choosing Montauk Point as
a camping ground for the Cuban
army. They also think now that
the general plan of bringing this
great body of sick men together into
one camp was another mistake.
The plan now proposed is to order
the regiments now there and re
leased from quarantine to other
portions of the country, thus estab
lishing instead of one great army
camp several regimental campsT
where even with limited transporta
tion facilities 1000 men can be given
the necessary food and attention to
bring them back to health.

Eogland Is I^eady for the Parti

Conflicting Reports as to Whether She Will Act
in Accord With or Antagonize
Russia.
LONDON, Aug. 27.â N0 one except
the actual participators in the negotia
tions knows what is the latest phase of
the international crisis which still ab
sorbs European attention. We are told
to-day with equal emphasis two things
which are of an exactly opposite tenor.
One is that the Anglo-Russian rela
tions are more strained than ever and
a rupture is close at hand. The other
is that Great Britain and the Czar have
reached a complete agreement and Lord
Salisbury has abandoned the policy of
the open door and China will be par
titioned forthwith, Russia and Great
Britain dividing the lion's share.
There is a possibility that neither
story is correct, but Lord Salisbury, be
coming convinced that it is no longer
possible to maintain the integrity of the
Chinese empire, is preparing to fore
stall his rivals by being the first to
seize a share of the spoils. This poli
cy will probably yield the largest re
sults to Englishmen.
It will be necessary at all events for
the Washington Government to decide
definitely and in detail what policy to
pursue in case such action is taken#by
Great Britain or any other power. There
will be no/ time to formulate a policy
after the moment of action comes. It
will then be a question of hours, and
the American voice, if it is to be heard
at all, must speak clearly and emphati
cally if necessary in the European capi-

STRAINED TO THE
POINT^OF RUPTURE
Such Is the Condition Authoritatively
Said to Exit-t Between Great
Britain and 3i-ina.
LONDON, Aug. 27.â An authoritative
confirmation has been received from
Peking by the Dally Mail this morn
ing of the report asserting tha* the
relations between the Tsung Li Yamen
and Sir Claude Mac Donald, the British
Minister to China, are strained to the
point of a rupture, and that Sir Claude
has intimated that Great Britain will
regard as a casus belli a failure on the
part of China to observe her wishes.
The Secretary says that the situation
between Great Britain and China Is
acute, Sir Claude Mac Donald strenu
ously insisting that China shall ob-
serve her engagements with British
syndicates and demanding satisfactory
explanations with regard to the Pe
king-Hankow railway. If necessary
the British squadron, now assembled
at Wei-Hal- Wei, will support the Brit

MADRID, Aug. 27.â Negotiations have
been opened with Washington to obtain
permission for the Spanish in the Ladrone
Islands to go to Manila, as the situation
in the Ladrones is extremely critical.
Great preparations are being made at
Yigo and Pontevedra for the repatriated
soldiers who are expected to arrive there
shortly. All possible sanitary precautions
are being taken.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27.â While Acting
Secretary of State Moore said to-night the
State Department had no information

GENERAL MILES
MAY BE TRIED BY
A COURT-MARTIAL
Unless Published Interviews Are
Denied He Will Be Prose
cuted by Alger.
BOSTON, Aug. 27.â A Washington special to the Journal says: As
soon as General Miles arrives in Washington he will be asked to
affirm or deny the correctness of the Interview published in the Kan
sas City Star, in which he criticized Secretary Alger and Adjutant
General Corbin and condemned the policy of the War Department at
Santiago and in Porto Rico. Should he admit the accuracy of the In
terviews and reaffirm the statements made he will be court-martialed.
This is known to be the purpose of Secretary Alger. The Secre
tary refuses to talk about the incident for publication, saying only
that he does not believe the interviews are authentic, and he evi
dently expects that Miles will disavow them on his return. There are
few army officers, however, who do not believe that the interviews
accurately reflect what Miles has been saying to his friends, and al
though he may deny that he has talked in this way for publication
there is little question that this is what he thinks. It is all too like
Miles not to have a measure of truth. A court-martial of the com
manding general of the army would be an extraordinary thing, and
Miles will probably so handle himself when he is here as to escape
it.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 27.â Major General Miles positively re,_
fuses to discuss the mutilation of dispatches he sent from Santiago,
which was mentioned in the alleged interview with him recently pub
lished in American newspapers. The lines in his face hardened when
I broached the subject and his voice deepened as he sternly said: "I
will not enter upon that subject."

One Is Dead and the
Other Wounded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CRESCENT CITY, Aug. 27.â The old
Willows saloon was the scene this aft
ernoon of a duel to the death between
William Young, the proprietor, and
Dwlght Safford, a half-breed Indian.
Safford lost his life and Young was se
riously wounded.
Young and Safford were at the bar
shaking dice for money. The latter,
being considerably loser, accused
Young of cheating, at the same time
striking him on the face. There was
an almost simultaneous reaching for
weapons, but Safford was the first to
shoot. Both men emptied their revol
vers as rapidly as tfey could crook
their trigger fingers. Both attempted
to reload, but suddenly Safford stag
gered out upon the sidewalk and fell
dead. A bullet had entered his right
breast, penetrating the right ventricle
of the heart, and another had passed
through his right thigh.
Young was hit but once, the ball en
tering the left breast a littie above the
heart and lodging back of the left arm.
The extent to which his- life is endan
gered has not yet been determined.
An inquest held at 2 o'clock this aft
ernoon resulted in a verdict that the
killing was done in self-defense.
Not a word was spoken by either
party during the duel. Although ten
shots were fired, only three took effect.
Those who witnessed the shooting say
that both men were cool and dellb-
crate.

The natives, after their custom, divided the

SAN QUENTIN`S
OPIUM TRADE
Trusties Found Dealing
in the Drug.
LARGE QUANTITY CONCEALED
FEW CONVICTS WHO DO NOT BE
COME "FIENDS."
Contraband Article Discovered in the
Cell of Prison Inmates Hith
erto Regarded as
Trustworthy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Aug. 27.â
For a long time it has been well known
that opium was being smuggled into
the prison regularly in small quanti
ties. The officials were not the only
ones who possessed this knowledge,
despite their strenuous . efldeavor to
keep the news from the public. So
notorious became the use of the drug
by the convicts that many relatives of
prisoners have protested to the officials.
It is known that in endeavoring to per
suade the Governor to pardon certain
young men friends have stated that
their lives were being wrecked by their
acquiring the opium habit.
But a discovery was made a few days
ago showing that the extent of the
evil had not even been suspected. It
was believed by the officials that only
a few of the more vicious characters
were acting as peddlers of the drug,
but it is now known that some of the
best behaved and most trusted prison
ers have been guilty of smuggling the
contraband article through the prison
gates.
A few days ago the attention of S. L.
Randolph, one of the inside guards, was
attracted to the peculiar action of cer
tain convicts quartered in whatlsknown
as the "redroom," a large cell in which
about twenty-five men are confined.
This cell is underneath "murderers'
row," and all kept in it are "trusties."
A Eearch of the cell revealed several
I pounds of opium concealed beneath a
I pillow, as well as $25 in coin. This
j opium and money were the property of
I one Hefferman, who was always
| deemed an exemplary prisoner, but is
! now known to be what in prison par
lance is called an "opium merchant."
The dungeon will be his abode until the
case is disposed of by the prison board.
It is believed that the average quan
tity of opium within the walls of the
prison from week to week is about
fifty pounds.
PROGRESO'S PASSENGERS
BRING KLONDIKE GOLD
SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 27.â The
steamer Progreso arrived here to-day
from St. Michael with 300 passengers
and a large amount of gold dust, the
property of a few passengers. Purser
Griffith claims that he carried $200,000
in his safe. Of this amount J. O. Ekera
had $50,000. A quartet consisting of G.
W. Morgan, L. C. Sihler, J. A. Snow
and George T. Snow had an
equal amount. J. D. Racey had
$28,000. Most of the Progreso's pas
sengers were "tenderfeet," who were in
Dawson but a short time. Captain
Eagles and crew of the wrecked bark
Guardian were also passengers. The
captain of the Progreso reports that
the steamer South Portland is in the
hands of the United States Marshal at
St. Michael for the trifling amount of
twelve barrels of whisky, which were
missing from her cargo. The Pro
greso was attended by a heavy fog all
the way down.
Passengers of the Progreso state
that there are between 200 and 300
men who have drifted down the Yu
kon River in small boats and rafts
camped on the beach at St. Michael.
They have no means to secure passage
to the States. There was considerable
talk among them of applying to the
Government for relief.

SKAGUAY ALMOST
DEPOPULATED BY
A NEW STAMPEDE
Great Rush for Rich Placer DiÂ£
g>ings in British Northwest
Territory,
Discoveries Near Lake Atlin Cause a Vast
Movement of Gold Seekers From Many
Alaska Locations.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Aug. 12.â Placer
diggings, rivaling Bonanza and El Do
rado creeks in richness, have been dis
covered within 100 miles in an air line
from Juneau, and a stampede is now
on, second in excitement to no other in
the history of Alaska. Skaguay is al
most depopulated, and the small
steamers which left this city this morn
ing for the head of Lynn canal were
packed and jammed with ardent gold
seekers bound for the new beds of gold.
About latitude 60 and longitude 131
west lies a great lake named Atlin. It
is Just over the divide and wholly
within British Northwest Territory. It
is about midway due east between the
Chilcoot Pass and Lake Teslin, the lat
ter the objective point of the aban
doned Stickeen River route. Lake At
lin is nearly 100 miles long and varies
in width from two to twenty miles, ex
tending southwest and northeast, and
is shown on the late maps. The re
gion is wild, hard to prosnect, and the
lake is on the west border of a vast
section of country totally unexplored
and unknown. W. L. Weppler of Ju
neau. one of the first to make a loca
tion In the new diggings, has just
come out from Lake Atlin for provi
sions. His story of the discovery shows
the reward of patient prospecting in a
region where the mosquitoes are said
to be as large and hungry as last
spring's turkeys, and the water of the
streams to run as swiftly as railroad
trains.
Fritz Miller, a brother of George Mil
ler, of the firm of Miller & McKinnon,
proprietors of the Circle City Hotel of
Juneau, has been prospecting in the
Lake Atlin region this summer. Mil
ler went up Takou arm of Lake Ta
gish to its head and then poled up At
lintoo River, a very swift stream,
which is the outlet of Lake Atlin. He
crossed the lake due east and started
prospecting on the first creek he saw.
He struck placer gold almost the first
day on the surface and then went
down into the gravel several feet in
different places. The ground panned
out from 40 cents to $12 in coarse gold
and no bed rock in sight. x-'ritz Mil
ler trimmed and located his stakes as
he never worked before. When the
burning sun dropped down behind the
mountains that day he underwent that
change of feeling which stirs in the
breast of a man who suddenly finds
himself at night the winner of a for
tune. Gravel which goes from 40 cents
to $12 to the pan above bed rock means
another El Dorado and Bonanza. This
creek is known by the classic name of
Pine. How Dave Thompson missed a
fortune on Pine Creek is the opposite
in interest to how Miller made it.
Thompson has been piloting boats
through White Horse rapids during tho
rush of the open season. He knew
Miller had gone up into the Atlin
country and followed him. When he
reached Atlintoo River the man he had
with him quailed before the swift cur
rent, fearing that if they got up they
might never get back and would starve
to death, and he refused to go any far
ther. Thompson was forced to re
turn. Thompson is the miner who
nearly laughed himself into a hemor
rhage last January in Juneau when he
heard about a man who had under
taken to drive a flock of chickens into
Dawson over the Dalton trail in the
dead of winter. Nothing has ever
been heard of the man or chickens
since. Thompson is still alive, though
not quite so fortunate as he might
have been.
The new discovery possesses in some
respects the peculiarity of being a fam
ily affair. Fritz Miller kept the find a
secret and came back to Juneau for
more grub and to let his relatives and
friends in on it. This was about three
weeks ago. Weppler is married to a
sister of the Millers. Dockie McKin
non, the two Millers, James McClusky,
proprietor of the Arctic Hotel; Walter
Carter and a man representing United
States Deputy Marshal Staley, who was
let into the secret, composed a party
and announced they were going into
Dawson. This diverted suspicion from
their real objective point and enabled
them to go across Lake Atlln and stake
all the ground that the law allows be
fore they would let the secret out. But
somehow the cat escaped from the bag.
McClusky and Weppler returned yes
terday, and this morning the former Is
sprinkling the street with a hose in
front of his place, surrounded by an
eager crowd and trying to look as
though nothing out of the ordinary had
happened. Where gold seekers are the
news of a strike leaks mysteriously and
spreads with the rapidity of a fire
alarm in a great city. A stampede fol
lows like the rush of the engines and
red helmets. When McClusky and
Weppler were coming down Takou Arm
several days ago on the way out they
passed fleets of boats filed with ex
cited gold seekers, headed for the lake.
This rush has only one predecessor.
That Avas the rush to the Klondike.
Every camp between Juneau and Tag
ish House is deserted. Men have left
tenta and cabins and hurried away
with insufficient food and clothing, in
many instances taking hardly enough
grub for the trip, when the news got
to Skaguay the whole town was electri
fied. It is the one engrossing topic of
conversation. The stores kept open all
night to supply the extraordinary de
mand for outfits. Everybody who can
is already gone or preparing to go. The
small steamers on the river below Lake
Bennett have deserted Dawson and are
carrying crowds up Takou Arm. The
Kilbourne made a brave attempt to run
up Atlintoo River into the lake with
her crowd of passengers, but could not
proceed against the swift surrent. Men
here and in Skaguay who can't leave
their business are rushing around in a
state of excitement trying to find the
right man to grubstake. A sack of gold
from Pine Creek was brought out by
Weppler and is being examined and
much admired at Circle City. Men
who came up the river from Dawson
on the steamers on their way to their
homes in the States have postponed the
home trip and are flocking to Lake At
lin. Efforts were made to get the local
newspapers of Skaguay and Tuneau to
suppress the news of the discovery, so
that a certain few might get In and
make locations before the stampede
came. They might as well have tried
to stop the wind as the news of a strike
when a breath of it escapes. Steamers
charge $20 each way from Lake Ben
nett to the mouth of Atlintoo. The
Ora, Nora and Flora are other steamers
on the run. They are working two
crews and stopping neither night nor
day. It is estimated that four thousand
men are already on the creeks on the
east side of the lake. At the head of
the river on Lake Atlin a town has
been staked out and named Takou City.
Atlintoo River is about seven miles
long. Steps are already being taken
to construct a tramway along it.
The site of Takou City is about
eighty miles from Lake Bennett. A
sawmill is being taken in. Lumber
there is worth $1 per foot. Weppler
says It took his party over nine hours
to get up the river, but that he and
McClusky came down the seven m.les
with the current in eighteen minutes.
The general opinion here is that Wep
pler's watch must have been so
thrilled by exhilaration that it stopped
several minutes on the way down. It
is about twelve miles across the river
to Discovery Creek and the creek it
self is about sixteen miles long. All
the ground on it is said to be located
by this time. .When the last party
left 49 above Discovery had been lo
cated. The distance to Discovery is
about five miles. It is all staked be
low. Frank Hinds, purser of the
Flora, was one of the lucky ones in the
early rush. He got a location and the
first panful of dirt turned out $4 in
gold about a foot below the surface.
The Canadian police are already on the
ground, Major Strickland in charge.
Many of the Skaguay Railroad hands
have quit work and vamosed to the
new diggings. Bed rock in the new
strike is said to be five feet down.
The Miller and McKinnon party took
in five men to work the claims. Wep
pler says they were panning out $40
per day to the man. When sluices are
built and all the preparations com
pleted for working the dirt the output
per day to the man will be much
larger. All reports to date agree in
that a considerable area of very rich
gravel has been found. The rule is
that placer deposits become rich the
farther they go down and that the
maximum value is greatest at bed rock.
The prospects on Pine Creek are- Just
as favorable for fabulously rich dig
gings as they were at Discovery on
Bonanza, El Dorado or any other trib
utaries of the Klondike River. Pulses
which have beat on the even tenor of
their way since the excitement first
subsided over the Yukon are now leap
ing in the wrists and temples of all
men up here who have two hands and
a back strong enough to shovel gravel.
There is another and a near route
to Lake Atlin which promises to be
come a rival of the Lake Bennett way
of getting there. It is up Takou In
let, ten miles below Juneau, then forty
miles up the Takou River by steamer,
twenty miles farther by canoe or small
boat, and then over a portage of about
twelve or fifteen miles by an Indian
trail, whence it is about twenty miles
of floating down Pike River to the
head of Lake Atlin. Business men
are considering the matter of putting
on a small steamer to run from Juneau
up the Takou River. By this route
the distance to the lake Is about 110
miles. This steamer may be put in
commission if good reports continue to
come out from the new mines.

CHILD POINTS AN
ACCUSING FINGER
Point Arena's Mystery
Deepens.
RELATIVE UNDER A CLOUD
JAMES DOWNS SEEN AT MBS.
MOUSE'S HOME.
The Husband of the Aged Victim's
Grandchild Said to Have Visited
the Cottage the .Evening Be
fore the Tragedy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POINT ARENA, Aug. 27.â The mys
tery surrounding the tragic death of
aged Mrs. Morse seems to grow deeper
as the investigation proceeds. Mrs.
Bpaulding, against whom the finger of
suspicion was first pointed, is now be
lieved to be innocent. Many citizens
who accused her of having committed
the crime and favored hanging her
without the formality of a trial are
now sorry that they spoke, so con
vinced are they of her innocence.
A six-year-old girl named Minnie
Bishop is likely to play an important
I part in unraveling the mystery. She is
the daughter of Joseph Bishop, and is
remarkably bright. She lives with her
parents in a vine-covered cottage only
: a short distance from the house which
was occupied by Mrs. Morse.
According to her statement she went
to the Morse residence the evening be
fore the tragedy. While plucking
'â  flowers she was surprised to see James
1 Downs, a blacksmith, leaving the
I house. She spoke to him and asked
I him to assist her in gathering a bou
| quet. Downs, as she claims, took her
i hand and escorted her from the place
after telling her that he was wanted
lat home. He went directly to his house
1 and was met at the door by his wife.
Downs is married to a daughter of Le
Grande Morse, who narrowly escaped
sharing the fate of his beloved parent.
j At the time at which, the child says,
she saw Downs leaving the house of
Mrs. Morse the aged woman was call
ing on Mrs. Downs. She remained
about an hour and a half and then re
turned to her home. The following
morning she partook of the poisoned
mush which caused her death. As it
is strongly believed that arsenic was j
placed in the mush during the ter- i
porary absence of Mrs. Morse, Downs
will shortly be called upon to explain
his presence in her house.
When confronted with the child's j
statement last evening, Downs at first i
hesitated, but finally declared that she :
was mistaken.
"She did not see me," he rather ve
hemently remarked, "and I was not at j
the house that evening, and I can j
prove it by several reliable witnesses. I j
| do not want to say that the girl is tell- ;
â  ing an untruth, but when she declares ;
I that she saw me leaving grandma's
house on the evening of the tragedy I ,
do claim she is greatly mistaken. I j
closed up my shop about 6 "o'clock on
that evening and went to my house, i
While my wife and I were discussing
various events Mrs. Morse entered.
Mrs. Spaulding came into the parlor
while we were there. A short time aft
erward I put on my coat and went for
a walk. I leisurely sauntered down
town and met several friends. Feeling !
fatigued, I concluded to go to bed and I
started for my home. I expected to i
find Mrs. Morse there, but was sur
prised when my wife told me that she
had left about fifteen minutes before
I returned.
"It is ridiculous to think that I would
have gone to grandma's house, know
ing that she was at my house. It is
true I have been in the habit of calling
at her house and was regarded as one
of the family. It seemed so much like
home to me that I did not think it
necessary to knock on the door before
I entered. She was like a mother to
me, and why some people should sus
pect me of causing her death seems
strange, to say the least."
Notwithstanding Downs' denial this
little girl is positive that he is the man
whom she saw leaving the Morse resi
dence while she was plucking flowers.
"I could not be mistaken," she em
phatically said when told of the denial
of the blacksmith. I know it was Mr.
Downs, because he spoke to me. He
wanted me to go to his house, but as I
wanted to get some more flowers I told
him I would see him later. After
plucking a big bouquet I thought I
would stroll down to his house and see
his wife. Mr. Downs was there, and I
spoke to him, but did not mention our I
meeting in Grandma Morse's garden."
Captain Henry Tullner, who sat at
the inquest over the body of the mur
dered woman, is convinced that Mrs.'
Morse was poisoned by one of her rel
atives.
"I have made a thorough investiga
tion," he remarked, "and have satisfied
myself that no stranger committed the
awful deed. It now seems that the
poisoner will never be caught. I first
suspected Mrs. Spauldingr, and wis in
favor of having: her arrested. Le
Grande Morse would not tolerate such
a course and I looked around for evi
dence upon which to baae a warrant
but was unsuccessful. I am in
clined to believe that, while Mrs
Spaulding did not commit the deed
she had a hand in it. There was
more than one person mixed up In the
awful crime and time will prove that
I am right."

' MARIETTA. 0.. Aug. 27.â As a result
of the death and burial at sea of Okey
Eddy, a private in the Eighth Ohio
Regiment, who died of starvation while
returning from Santiago on the ship
Mohawk, his two single sisters have
become violently insane and his mother
tried twice this afternoon to commit
suicide.
When the news of the young man's
death reached the family the women
became hysterical and a physician was
summoned, but he was unable to do
anything for the two sisters â Bertha
and Vesta â who became so violent that
it was necessary to confine them in
. closed rooms and place a watch over
them.
The mother is the widow of Simon
Eddy, who died a few years ago from
a wound received in the Civil war. To
day she took a bed sheet, and tearing it
into shreds, made a rope, with which
she twice tried to hang herself. The

friends she seized a knife and before

beat Taylore's record by 1 2-5 seconds in
the first heat, but the "Major* 1 wiped this
out and tied Betts' record against time in
the second heat. As Taylor was on the
outside for nearly two and a half laps, it
was easily seen that he rode more than a
mile in the time, and shrewd judges who
wuiched the race said that he would sure
ly do better on the third attempt.
That lie fully justified this belief goes
wii.iout saying. After taking up his po
sition on the pole Taylor jumped away at
a hair-raising cH^> and opened a gap of
ten yards in the first lap of the final heat.

There were two professional and two
amateur events on the programme in ad

RECEPTION TENDERED
THE FUSION LEADER
Congressman Maguire Devotes Two
Hours to a Dicussion of thÂ«
Silver Issue.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 27.â The fusion
forces turned out en masse this evening
for the reception to James G. Maguire
at Hazard's Pavilion. About 3000 peo
ple were present. Democrats and Popu
lists constituting a large part of the
audience. Many Republicans also were
present, attracted by a desire to see
Democracy's Little Giant.
J. Noonan Phillips called the meeting
to order and Sutherland Hutton was
made chairman. The programme was
a long one, for Maguire spoke for two
hours and was followed by E. L. Hut
chinson, the Eighth "Ward statesman,
who aspires to be Lieutenant Governor,
and by Senator Stephen M. White.
Maguire spoke at length upon the free
silver question, defending the fallacy
which affords the common bond of
union between the fusion forces. He
devoted much time to the Southern Pa
cific Railroad, charging that Its influ
ence was paramount in the Republican
party of this State and asserting that
the fusion campaign was an anti-rail
road flg'ht:
In alluding to Henry T. Gage, Ma
guire paid tribute to his character and
ability, assuring his audience that the
campaign would not be one of per
sonalities. Incidentally, the speaker
took occasion to deny that he had ever
characterized the capture of Spanish
ships as an act of piracy, and he de
nounced The Call for the publication of
the same.
Senator "White spoke briefly and his
address was chiefly praise of Maguire,
wljom he described as the friend of the
people and the foe of corporations and
monopolies.

STATE TICKET OF
THE FUSIONISTS
IS COMPLETED
Silver Republican Convention at
Los Angeles Indorses Maguire
for Governor,
Walter Van Dyke Named for Associate Justice
and H. M. McCraney for Clerk of the
Supreme Court.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 27.â James G.
Maguire, the omnibus candidate for
Governor, added one more nomination
to his list to-day when the Silver Re
publican State convention meeltly car
ried out the fusion programme by plac
ing him at the head of its ticket. Nat
urally the proceedings were of the most
perfunctory character, as everything
was cut and dried.
The convention thankfully accepted
the two places on the ticket that were
flung to the Silver Republicans by their
Populist and Democratic allies. Judge
Walter Van Dyke, a member of the
bench of Los Angeles by grace of the
Republican party, was nominated for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
H. H. McCraney was nominated for
Clerk of the Supreme Court.
The convention was little more than
a ratification mass meeting. Its com
position was peculiar. The call was for
847 delegates, but the number actually
present was but 328. Of these more
than 200 were from Los Angeles
County and most of the remainder were
from adjoining counties. Of the llfty
seven counties of the State thirty-five
were nominally represented, tht/ugh the
great majority of these had only a sin
gle delegate each.
Seated on the floor of the convention
hall and wearing the badges of dele
gates were a number of well known
Democrats, Including a member of the
Democratic State convention, and sev
eral women. It was obvious the mana
gers of the convention had been at sore
trials to rally a respectable attendance.
Los Angeles County was originally
given 100 delegates, but when it was
found that there would be so many ab
sentees from other parts of the State,
the allotment was increased to 247. As
a mass meeting the assemblage was
quite a respectable affair. As the State
convention of a political party, it was
certainly unique.
The platform was prepared in evident
imitation of those adopted by the Dem
ocrats and Populists. In the main they
were closely followed, but one plank
was incorporated which evidently es
caped Maguire's scrutiny, for it is in
radical conflict with his single tax
views. The platform demands the free
and unlimited coinage of silver on the
basis of 16 to 1, condemns the war bond
issues, indorses President McKinley's
course and demands that all territory
occupied by the United States during
the war shall be retained.
T. H. Wells, a Santa Monica Justice
of the Peace, was elected temporary
chairman by acclamation. J. Mills
Davies and F. J. Cooper of Los Angeles,
Harry L. Baker of Oakland and J. Stan
ley Brown of Redlands were Installed
as secretaries.
While the chair was engaged in mak
ing up the committee L. A. Sheldon was
called to the platform to occupy the
time. This he did wth a vengeance, for
once started it proved impossible to
stop him. After he had been talking
some twenty minutes the delegates be
gan to yell "Time." The chairman then
suggested to the speaker that he had
talked enough. To such mild hints
Governor Sheldon turned a deaf ear.
The convention then attempted to
drown his voice by clamor, but this,
too, was unavailing. Finally, in a
moment of inspiration, a trumpeter was
brought into the hall, and the ringing
notes of the reveille rang out, putting
a quietus upon the silver-tongued ora
tor.
Before the noon recess a delegate
arose and said:
"I heard a gentleman who keeps a
store on Broadway say that In the last
election he did not vote because there
was so much drinking. I hope that the
delegates will keep sober."
With this admonition to practice
temperance, the convention took a re
cess until 2 o'clock.
The entire business of the convention
was transacted In lees than three hours
âbetween 2 and 5 p. m. â and there was
time In between for a number of cam
paign addresses. The work of the
afternoon was the ratification of the
plan of fusion, an Indorsement of the
fusion candidates for State offices and
the adoption of a plan for future ad
ministration of the affairs of the Silver
Republican party, with the appoint
ment of an executive committee to
carry out the provisions of the plan.
The adoption of the postal card pri
mary was the distinctive feature of the
new plan.
Henry T. Hazard nominated Dr.
George F. Dixon of Sacramento for per
manent chairman. He was secondr-'i
by J. Noonan Phillips, and elected by
acclamation. Dr. Dlxon was escorted
to the platform by Major Bugbee and
Kimball of San Luis Obispo.
The programme provided that H. A.
Ingalls of Oakland should nominate
Mapruire as Silver Republican standard
brarer. Mr. Ingalls put all the life he
could into his nominating speech, but
Its eloquence was dampened by the
knowledge that what he was doing was
merely a form. In accordance with the

It Is Recommended That

WASHINGTON, Aug. 77.âAssist
ant Naval Constructor HobÃon was
to have been examined for promo
tion last week, but owing to his
duties he could not go before the
board. It was ordered that his rec
ord be examined to see If that
would entitle him to the higher

"The board Joins with all the

The report then refers to the va

recommendation that he be promot
ed to naval constructor.
spirit of Maguire's campaign, Ingalls
devoted his time to roasting the cor
porations and declaring that the Re
publican party was the slave of wealth
and corruption. He assailed the Su
preme Court of the State. At the end
of his moral lecture, Mr. Ingalls inci
dentally mentioned that he wished to
nominate Maguire for Governor.
The motion was carried by acclama
tion and Maguire was escorted to the
platform by Dr. Boynton, J. Noonan
Phillips and Mr. Ingalls.
Maguire stood up and bowed to the
yelling mob of delegates. Phillips was
behind him, waving his arms in the air,
and when the excitement flagged he
waved his arms more wildly than ever
and aroused the cheering again. On
Maguire's face was a glow of excite
ment and gratified ambition. He step
ped forward, and, drawing up his stocky
figure, waited until everything was
quiet. Then he thanked the convention
for the honor bestowed on him. Said
he:
I feel that this Is no mere personal
compliment to me. This great intelligent
body of representative citizens entertains
on many questions views different from
mine, yet agrees with my party as now
constituted on the great paramount issues
of the day. Your action means a rising
I above party for the sitke of principle. My
I selection is not for the sake of person
! aiity. but for the sake of permanent prln
i ciples. You have testified your confidence
in my integrity and my capacity to carry
out these principles.
I will not try to discuss the issues of the
campaign at this time, as to-night I am
to address you again on these tonics. I
will only thank you for your cordial and
unanimous indorsement, and assure you
that 1 will strive for the great principles
and common purpose which bind together
your party and mine in the ties of patri
otic union.
I fully realize that the uprising of the
great Silver RepuL..cun party and the
great Democratic party and the great
Populist party gives evidence that the
people are entering upon a new battle for
civilization, human rights, liberty and
j equlty s as important as any battle in the
j history of the human race. 1 have met
\ you in the past as an antagonist. It is
inspiring beyond expression to find that
common principles now unite us in the
struggle for human rights. You have
withdrawn from your party, not for self
ish but for patriotic purposes. The in
terests of your party demanded that you
i should do so. You made the heavy sac
| rifice Â«f breaking your party associa
1 tions. The Populist party is made up of
! those who went out of their party to
right for those principles which unite us.
We of the Democratic party have been
not less patriotic in our work during the
| past four years.
The difference between your position
and our position is only in the extent to
which we succeeded with ours. We are
obliged to tight the same forces which
drove you out of your partyâl should
rather say the forces which took your
party organization away from you. If
we are to judge from the principles often
enunciated by your great party leaders
from Abraham Lincoln down, then you
are the Republican party in very truth.
But you will bear im mind that in IS9O
what is now the Democratic party gained
its position and placed itself where it now
stands by overthrowing the forces which
supported the interests for aiding which
you condemned the national Republican
organization.
All party organizations must be main
tained by patriotic citizens for the coun
try's good. It is the duty of every citizen
who loves his country to leave the party
if it does not represent his ideas of right.
Patriotism rises above party. The Re
publican party of Abraham Lincoln, basted
on the principles expressed By him, is not
the so-called Republican party of to-day.
The reason is not far to seeic. A great
system of special privileges has grown up.
supported by laws unwise when not cor
rupt. The agents of the corporate inter
ests are at the seat of governmentâna
tional. State or loc*l â continually at work.
They understand the necessity of aiding
the party in power. They are continually
taxing the people for their own Interests.
They give their services to the party in
power and continually seek to obtain a
foothold in Its councils. Gradually,
through the growth of thi* insidious evil,
the party in power abandons Its princi
ples and comes to be the supporter of
privileges prejudicial to the national
good. The end is ultimate and final sur
render of the party to corporate domlna- <
tlon.
So it must be with every party In
power. Good citizens must be kept in
the lines of warfare against monopoly
and corporate influence. The people
sleep and allow their influence on the
party to become weak and frail. Their
opponents work tirelessly to the destruc
tion of the people's interests.
Against these evils there is a new ris
ing of the people of the country, a new
declaration of independence. Not one.
but three great parties have cast their
strength toward this movement. The uni
ty of their principles has been recog
nized. They have united their forces, in
stead of allowing the enemy to conquer
by disunion. In terms of honorable- co
operation we have come together to fight
for a common purpose.
I am proud and grateful that the peo
ple in this new uprising of patriotic sent- i
iment should have chosen me to be their
standard bearer. They did this because [
of my past record in political service.
I shall endeavor to leave behind me a re
cord as stainless aÂ» has been that of my I
past life. I shall try to be as faithful j
in future service as I have tried to be in j
the past. , .
I cannot go on further now without de
laying other more Important things. I
desire to close by thanking you sincerely
and by promising that in everything I
shall try to be faithful.
E. L. Hutchlnson was nominated for
Lieutenant Governor and delivered a
platform speech in which he confided
to the convention what he will do when
he presides over the State Senate.
Judge Walter Van Dyke was nomin
ated for Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court, but Judge Phillips an
nounced on his behalf that he thought
it beneath the dignity of a candidate
for that solemn honor to imperil the
awe which surrounds it by speaking in
public from the stage.
H A. McCraney, candidate for Clerk
of the Supreme Court, the only Silver
Republican candidate except Judge
Van Dyke, who has won a place on the
fusion ticket, was put forward by Carl
Schultz, who turned his back to Ma
guire; and E. L. Hutchlnson announced
that McCraney was the 'best known,
most capable and handsomest man on
the fusion ticket."
The other nominees of the fusioniats
and the plan of fusion Itself were then
ratified and resolutions adopted thank
ing everybody and everything.
The platform adopted is voluminous
and touches many issues and imagin
ary issues. It refuses to follow the
growth of the RepubJlcan party during
the recent years on financial lines, and
looks back to 1860 for a solution of pres
ent problems; declares that bonds
should be payable in either gold or sil
ver; demands currency composed of
gold, silver and paper, wholly under
control of the Government; favors the
free and unlimited coinage of silver at
the ratio or 16 to 1; declares that the
policy of the national administration
on financial matters has been dishon
est; advocates tariff for revenue, with

horticulturists of the State. We there

reform in the laws governing the as

faithful administration of such laws."
This repudiation of heavy taxation of
land owners is the only plank touching
Maguire's pet theory of placing all
taxation on them.
DIED FilOM HER BURNS.
Nellie Davis, a Young Resident of
Nevada, Passes Away at
St. Luke's.
The sufferings of little Nellie Davis, an
eigh^-year-old resident of Lovelock, Nev.,
who was severely burned ten days ago,
were relieved by death yesterday morn
ing at St. Luke's Hospital. For ten days
the child tossed and moaned in her bed
of torture from the burns sustained while
playing with an older sister, and despite
the care and attention given her by kind
attendants the end came in death.
The death of the little one recalls the
terrible accident that occurred nearly
two weeks ago. While playing with a
bunch of matches the little one's dress
became ignited, and the flames
could be extinguished she was severely
burned about the back and arms.
Every effort was made oy local physi
cians to relieve her pain, but with only
temporary success. ab the sufferer
needed constant attention it was decided
to bring her to a hospital in this city.
St. Luke's was chosen, and on Wednes
day afternoon she was taken to that in
stitution.

BY J. J. CLANCY.
DUBLIN, Aug. 13.â "We are all excite
ment here in expectation of the celebra
tion of the Wolfe Tone centenary on Mon
day next. The Nationalist newspapers
for the past week have been devoting
column upon column to reports of pro
ceedings in connection with the event,
from which it is easy to gather that the
demonstration will bo exceptionally large
and representative â possibly the largest
since that which Dublin witnessed on the
occasion of the funeral of Parnell. One
thing in particular proves the deep hold
which the memory of '98 has on the popu
lar mind. It Is that by the mere force of
public opinion Monday is to be kept as a
general holiday. Such a circumstance
would not be surprising if it occurred In
the provinces outside the northeast corner
of Ulster, for the minority which favors
English rule in the provinces of Ireland
Is everywhere very small. But in Dublin
It Is a very considerable minority and it
possesses a good deal of the wealth of
the capital. Tet In Dublin all the Im
portant employers of labor have resolved
to give their employes an opportunity of
attending the Wolfe Tone demonstration,
and among the first to announce this de
cision were the great firm of Guinness &
Co. The feeling must be pretty strong
and universal which Induced that body to
take *uch a step. It is less wonderful
that Sir Robert Sexton as chairman o*
one of our local boards a few days ago
seemed to smile benevolently on the idea
of the board's employes going out to do 1
honor to Wolfe Tone. It is true that the |
board in questionâ the South 'Dublin j
Board of Guardiansâ has long been j
known as one of the most extreme
Tory bodies in the country; but then it
must be remembered that Sir Robert Sex
ton is now a candidate for the Mayoralty
of Dublin, and as such cv"en he must
count Nationalist sentiment. The whole I
set of circumstances is a curious com- I
mentary on the theory of the present
Government that the local government

bill, which, by the way, yesterday re
ceived the royal- assent and is now the
law of the land, will solve the Irish ques
tion.
The Lord Mayor of Dublin and Wil
liam Field, one of the members of Par
liament for Dublin City, have just con
cluded a tour of the distressed districts
in the west of Ireland. They went down
there as the representatives of the Dub
lin Mansion House Committee, which has
been dispensing relief among the neces
sitous, to inspect and report. They vis
ited various parts of Galway and Mayo,
and were everywhere received with mani
festations of the liveliest gratitude. It is
quite plain that but for the work of the
Mansion House Committee many persons
would have died of starvation In the wesi
during the earlier months of the
year and that the crops would never
have been sown last spring In many of
the small holdings bordering the coast.
But the indirect result of the efforts of
the Mansion House Committee has been
at least as Important as the direct. They
forced the Government to take action and
to spend Â£60,000 in relieving distress and
supplying seed for the crops. That the
Government d'd spend so much money
Is proof of the reality and Intensity .if
the distress within a certain area. But
this is not all. The problem of the dis
tressed west has bf>en shoved to the

SIR ROBERT SEXTON, LORD MAYOR-ELECT OP DUBLIN.
I cur there are at last felt by the Gov
ernment itself to be a disgrace, and more
than one Indication has of late been given
that its solution on permanent lines may
be attempted next year. How it is to
be solved everybody in Ireland is agreed,
and the Lord Mayor- of Dublin and Mr.
Field are the latest witnesses on this
point. There is .only one real remedy for
the chronic poverty of the west. It i-s
to enlarge the holdings of the peasantry,
who are now huddled together on little
patches of land which are too small to
produce enough of food by their cultiva
tion, and to establish such cottage indus
tries as elsewhere serve to keep such a
population profitably employed. A remedy
like this cannot, of course, be adopted
without the aid of imperial money, and
there is, I understand, at least one man
in the Ministry who both admits this fact
and is ready to vote the moneyâ l mean
A. J. Balfour.
The fourth session of the Fourteenth
Parliament of Queen Victoria came to a
close yesterday. It has been, in respect
of beneficial legislation actually passed,
the most important in its results for Ire- |
land since 1884, when the franchise was
extended to its present level, and that, of
! course, by reason or, the passing
of the local government bill, which,
'as I have mentioned above, yes
l terd&y received the royal attest.
That act, to state Its effect briefly and
'. broadly, finally disestablishes the pro-
Englip'h minority in Ireland, and particu
larly the landlord section of it. So far as
: the political favor of that minority is con
! corned, it was swept out of existence In
: ISB4, when the. household franchise was'
â  extended; now the monopoly it has hith
erto possessed of local government and
administration is finally destroyed. If it
ruiitinues to retain any part, it will be
solely by the free will of the people, and
most sensible persons hope that the people
will allow it to retain Its proper share. If
' the people do take that course the last
argument against home rule, or national
self-government, will have disappeared.
The local government act ia not the only
concession of importance which has been
won for Ireland during the Parliamentary
cession lust closed. The imperial grant in
relief of local rates lias been raised from
Â£ISO,OOO a year to Â£730 000 a year, and there
: have boeri other fresh grants also for
IriÂ»h local purposes. These financial con
cessions are clearly due to the financial
: relations agitation, and they are not in
: considerable; but they do not reduce the
financial grievance of over-taxation, the
existence of which the report of a royal
. commission has declared to be proved.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 1898.
c, consequently, that agitation will
tlnue and will probably be a prominent
ure of the coming political campaign
in Ireland. In this movement, fortunate
ly, all Irishmen (with the exception of a
few in Belfast) are united, and there is a
general determination to press for the last
farthing due to the country. Even Belfast
seems at last to be coming round to the
general view. That city has hitherto kept
aloof from the financial movement be
cause it thought that it discerned in it
something of Nationalism and "Popery"
combined; but It is getting rid gradually
of the ridiculous idea.
The Gladstone statue project, as I an
ticipated, has been, as it were, nipped in
the bud. The corporation on Monday
unanimously refused to grant a site for
a statue to any Englishman in the streets
I Dublin till a suitable monument had
t been erected to Charles Stewart
nell. Not only was this decision come
unanimously, but there was scarcely
discussion about It. This was rather
inge, in view of the fact that there
several anti-Parnellites in the corpo
on, and that the anti-Parnellite Jour
* had for several days tried tried to
work up an agitation in support of the
English proposal, the Independent alone,
the organ of the Independent or Parnell
ite party, denouncing it. The explana
tion, of course, is that Dublin 1b over
whelmingly Parnellite, and that we ara
soon to have a general municipal elec
tion. The anti-Parnellite Journals, or
rather one of them, now threatens an
agitation to reverse the vote of the cor
poration, but that threat is mere bun
combe. An agitatior for such a purpose
could not be gotten up and could not
be maintained in Dublin for a single day.
It would be regardf-d as a fresh anti-
Parnellite campaign, and however that
might fare in the provinces, it would
have no show in the capital. The Eng
lish Liberals, of course, if one may judge
from the comments in the English Lib
eral press are wild with the Parnell
ites. But they ought to have known
what would happen, and have refrained
from inviting the rebuff they have re
ceived. Their present behavior is re
garded as a fresh attempt to dictate to
Irish Nationalists in a matter which
concerns Irish Nationalists alone.
An interesting ceremony took place in
the City Hall op Saturday last whenjtwo
beautiful flags were presented by
John E. Redmond, M. P., on behalf of
the Irish Ladies' Association of New
York to the veteran patriot, John
O'Leary. aa the chairman of the '98 Cen
tenary Committee. The flags were sent
across to Mr. Redmond in substitution
for the presence of Irish-Americans ,who
would have been present In person this
summer but for the war. They are beau
tifully designed, and will be prominently
borne in the Wolfe Tone procession on
Monday. Interesting speeches were made
on the occasion by Mr. Redmond and Mr.
O'Leary, and the whole incident has
caused gTeat satisfaction in the Nation
alist ranks. But, needless to say, the
Irish people, and the Dublin people espe
cially, are nevertheless sorry that cir
cumstances will not permit the Irish-
American invasion, to which they have
beeo looking forward since the opening
of the year. I may add here that the
accounts which have reached us of the
sufferings of Irish and other American
soldiers at Santiago deeply stirred public
feeling. Not a few Irish-American offi
cers are reported to have succumbed to
yellow fever whose names had been fa
miliar one way or another in this coun
try, and it is hard to realize that they
have passed away. The consolation, of
course, is that they have died under the
Stars and Stripes, fighting in the defense
of human liberty.
Now that the centenary of 98 is being
celebrated, the work of the Rev. P. F.
Kavanaugh, O. 8. F., of Cork, on the
Insurrection, is being largely read. It was
first published some years ago and had
an extensive sale, but it now, of course,
Is being read more widely still. It is a
work of painstaking research, and of
high literary merit. Father Kavanaugh
is by nature, instinct and family fitted
to be the historian of '98. He is a grand
nephew of Father Michael Murphy, who
was killed at the battle of Ross in that
year, and inherits his ancestry's patri
otic devotion. As a man and as a priest
he Is universally esteemed tn Cork.
WOULD EXPEL THE FRIARS.
Letter of the Philippine Islands'
Committee to President
McKinley.
LONDON, Aug. 27.â The Philippine
Islands Committee In Europe haa ad
dressed a letter to President McKinley
regarding the appeals made to him by
high Roman Catholic ecclesiastics In
America to protect the religious orders
in the islands. The expulsion of the friars,
the committee contends, is a necessary
antecedenr" to moral reform. The letter
names particularly the Archbishop of
Malay and the BiÃhops of Nueva Sagovia
and Neuva Casea as men whose acts of
hostility agairtet both natives and Ameri
cans and also apr&inst tn"e Jesuits and
other respected religious Institutions, are
condemned by every one.
The committee urges President McKin
lev to "aid the Filipinos to suppress the
Immorality of the diabolical institutions
fostered by these monks." and concludes
as follows: "Your name can never be as
sociated with that of the friars and the
sense of right of the noble nation at
whose head you are placed will never per
mit the ever-victorious and humanitarian
Stars and Stripes to protect them.

The most Important events of the
week in domestic politics have been the
national convention at Crefeld, Rhen
ish Prussia, and the attitude adopted
by the Socialist party toward the com
ing Diet election. The Crefeld con
vention, for the first time, took a dis
tinctly friendly tone toward the Gov
ernment. Bishop Schmitz of Cologne
eloquently expressed strictly loyal
sentiments. A telegram sent to Em
peror William, assuming him of the
loyalty of the 7000 delegates of the
German Catholics assembled, and his
reply to It were noticeable features of
the occasion.
Another notable departure was a res
olution adopted by the convention to
establish Catholic peasant societies
everywhere in Germany. This was a
strategic move designed to compete
with the peasant federation of Bava
ria. It was also significant that the
death of Prince Bismarck, the author
of the Kulturkampf, Instead of being
used as a basis for hostile comment,
drew out a few semi-laudatory re
marks, one speaker contending that if
Bismarck were alive and Chancellor
he would have signed ere now a bill
to recall the Jesuits.
The various socialist local election
committees have decided upon their
course of action with regard to the
Diet election. In Berlin an overwhelm
ing majority has resolved not to par
ticipate, as under the three-class elec
tion system the socialists have no
chance of electing their candidates.
On the other hand, Breslau, Erfurt,
Frankfurt, Lebuz. Schleuslngen. Biels
feld, Elberfeld, Elnbeck, Brandenburg
and other towns have decided to run
their own candidates or to support
Freisinnige candidates. In a number
of other districts the socialists have
concluded to participate openly in the
elections, which may mean the ruin of
many socialists.
Prince Bismarck's memoirs are now
in Berlin. Privy Councilor Kroner
received a special hint from the Gov
ernment and brought the bulky manu
script, which Is now undergoing exam
ination. There is, however, a duplicate
manuscript at Frledrichsruhe, and aB

promptly took control of the firemen
and the flames were soon extinguished.
There is unusual activity in the ship
yards at Kiel, Stettin, Elblng and
Hamburg. The Government has placed
a number of orders among them, In
cluding commissions for six big tor
pedo-boat destroyers of thirty-three
knots speed, to be ready for service
early next year. In addition there are
orders from Russia, Spain, Brazil and
Argentine Republic. It is a curious
fact that the Government has ordered
the Vulcan Shipbuilding Works to pay
a duty of 261,000 marks on the floating
dock built in England, although the
company cites against the ruling the
provision of the German tariff law
which declares that vessels are free of
duty.
It is announced that the Navy De

Naval Tags Iroquois and Vigilant Go
Out of Commission.
VALLEJO, Aug. 27.â The auxiliary na
val tugs Iroquois and Vigilant went out
of commission at Mare Island to-day, the
officers being placed on waiting orders
and the men disc-arged and sent to San
Francisco on the tug Unadilla. This ac
tion on the part of the Government Is
a great Injustice to the men, some of
whom not only received no money but
were in debt to the Government for their
outfits. The Iroquois will be retained aa
a yard tug and the Vigilant will be fitted
out as a tender to the apprentice training
ship Pensacola, which will shortly be re
moved to Goat Island. The Vigilant will
be fitted with tanks to carry water to the
island from San Francisco.

THE PEACE COMMISSION.
WHILE the reports may have been true that the
President found much difficulty in his efforts
to get strong representative men to serve on
the Peace Commission, it is certain he succeeded in
the task. We may have sonre reason to complain be
cause no representative of the Pacific Coast was
appointed, but the nation at large will be well satis
fied to leave the settlement of the issues arising out
of the war to such men as Secretary Day, Senators
Frye and Davis, Justice White and Embassador Reid.
Strong as the commission is it will have no strength
to spare when it comes to grapple with the Spanish
officials in the field of diplomacy and undertakes the
task of bringing the controversy to a speedy conclu
sion. It is Spanish nature under all circumstances to
do nothing to-day that can be postponed until to
morrow, and in the present emergency the natural
tendency to delay will be augmented by a thousand
motives of pride, exasperation and the hope that by
prolonging the talk something may occur which will
redound to the benefit of Spain and impel us to grant
some of her many claims.
Statements recently made by Sagasta show the
policy the Spanish representatives will pursue when
the commission assembles. "The peace question,"
said the Spanish Premier, "is at present very compli
cated. The Paris conference will settle the Philippine
question, and will also arrange commercial treaties by
which Spanish goods may obtain tariff advantages in
Cuba and Porto Rico in exchange for similar ad
vantages given to the Americans in the Philippines."
As if there were not enough impudence displayed in
this cool assumption that Spain has either the right
or the power to arrange tariffs in the Philippines in
exchange for favors granted in the West Indies, Sa
gasta went on to say that while Spain will surrender
Cuba and Porto Rico it will claim all Governmental
property in the islands, including national buildings
of all kinds, and will insist in having a voice in the
settlement of such civil and criminal cases as are now
pending in the courts. Spain, it is further announced,
will stand firm against assuming the payment of any
part of the Cuban debt. Finally she will maintain
that the. Philippines are still legally her possessions
because the surrender of Manila did not take place
until after the protocol of peace was signed.
It will be readily seen that if the American Com
missioners consent to discuss these propositions the
end of the conference will not occur during the few
years that are left of this century. The Commission
ers in debating such a multitude of claims through the
slow processes of diplomacy will remain in Paris to
see the exposition of 1900 and still remain there when
it closes. Negotiation on such a basis will be as long
drawn out as that of a European concert, and the re
sults will probably be as ineffective.
Fortunately the American Commissioners are men
who are not likely to give much consideration to these
Spanish claims. The Philippines, as well as Cuba and
Porto Rico, are in our hands. The Government prop
' erty is ours as much as the soil of the country in
which the property stands. It is for us to offer terms
and for Spain to accept the offer or renew the fight.
So far from being a complicated problem, as Sa
gasta asserts, the making of this peace is one of the
simplest problems ever submitted to diplomats.
Several instigators of a prize-fight in New York
have been arrested because one of the principals hap
pened to get killed in the ring. For some reason this
course is taken after each similar event, the law ap
parently deeming it a necessity to make a bluff of
caring how many pugilists die with their gloves on.
A. J. Drexel, the Philadelphia banker, is to have a
$1,000,000 yacht, to which he has a perfect right, and
for which he will doubtless pay cash. But it is to be
built abroad, and there is no reason why it should not
have been built in this country.
The Spanish paper which says that England wishes
the United States to annex the Philippines so as to
have them for a British base of operations against
France and Russia would better guess again.
When the Democratic section of the fusion plat
form refers to the good deeds of all the Democratic

It is demonstrated that California is a citrus belt

going to suck it, either.

DR. SANGRADO MAGUIRE.
UNTIL he became a candidate for Governor
Judge Maguire had but one remedy for all the
evils of society, and that was the single tax.
Sangrado bled for all disease, and Maguire proposed,
by bleeding the land-owner, to abolish crime, poverty
and all unrighteousness without regard to any moral
change in the personal character of men.
On account of the single tax he bolted the Demo
cratic party in 1886, and for that he kicked and de
feated Hastings, Ferral and McCoppin in succession
as Democratic candidates in his Congressional dis
trict. In each of these bolts against the Democratic
ticket he was aided and abetted by his next friend,
Barry, who is now the Democratic candidate to suc
ceed him in Congress. In addition to all these bolts
and betrayals of Democracy, in 1887 he by letter per
manently withdrew from the Democratic party be
cause it would not indorse the single tax. For that he
cursed and quit it, remarking, as he left, that it was
a rather nasty party any way, with which no honest
man or gentleman could safely associate. Now, as
he found the Democratic party unfit to stay with in
1887 because it did not indorse the single tax, why
does he go back to it now? Has it indorsed the sin
gle tax by indorsing him?
Until now in everything Judge Maguire has written
or said the single tax appears as inevitably as the
head of Charles lin the essays of Mr. Dick. He left
his seat in Congress to make long single-tax cam
paigns in Delaware and boasted that he had broken
down the Democratic party of that State by raising
the single tax issue. He lately addressed the single
taxers of the State of Washington, saying the single
tax is the sole issue worthy the support of a good
citizen. No longer ago than the 18th of last February
(see Congressional Record, V01.31, N0. 54), discussing
the bankruptcy bill, he said: "In the course of my
remarks on the floor to-day I referred briefly to the
causes of bankruptcy in the United States, and ex
pressed the opinion that legislation for the relief of
ruined merchants and others who are carrying on the
wealth-producing and wealth-distributing enterprises
of our country is a poor substitute for legislation that
would remove the great universal cause of nearly all
I the unmerited distress and bankruptcy among our
' people." Then quoting Henry George on effects of
I the single tax, he said: "Socialists, Populists and
I charity-mongers, the people who would apply little
I remedies for a great evil, are all barking up the wrong
: tree. The Upas of our civilization is our treatment of
I land. It is that which is converting even the march
'< of invention into a blight. Thtrt is but one cure Jor
â  business deprission, there i% no other: that is the single tax. 1 '
If these were his convictions only seven months
i'ago, is he honest in becoming the candidate of three
j parties which fuse upon the single proposition that
the free coinage of silver is the one cure for business
depression?
Fusion here and everywhere is upon free silver as
i the panacea, but seven months ago Judge Maguire
said there was but one remedy, and that not free sil
1 ver, but the single tax. If that were true then why is
'it not true now? If free coinage of silver then were
I the remedy for business depression, why did he say
the single tax was? *
Does Judge Maguire believe in free coinage of sil
! ver? Does he believe it will cause the economic re
i form declared to be its purpose by Mr. Bryan, Con
gressman Towne, Coin Harvey and its other pro
ponents? If he does so believe his single-tax theory
lis a myth and sham. If his single-tax theory is true
then free silver is a lie and a sham.
Is there anything.honest in this free silver fusion on
I a candidate who denies that there is any remedy for
business depression except the single tay, and by that
denial repudiates free silver?
THE WAR DEPARTMENT SCANDALS.
WHETHER true or false, the many reports of
mismanagement on the part of the War De
partment have now reached proportions of
such magnitude that neither the administration nor
Congress can afford to ignore them. What at first
j were but little more than mutterings coming from
â  obscure sources have grown to the clamors arising
< from all sides. Dispatches from the East teem with
statements of blunders or worse, committed in the
! conduct of the war, and some of these are of a nature
that compel attention even from persons most skep
tical of general rumors.
As the matter stands the complaints concerning the
j ill usage of the troops at the front and at the various
; camps established in the Eastern States have been
; made the basis of sensational attacks upon the Secre
, tary of War and the commanding general. The result
'â  has been that the whole subject is involved in such
a mass of self-evident exaggerations that the fair
! minded citizen cannot distinguish what is true from
\ what 4 false, and finds it difficult to decide whether
! the evils were caused by wrongdoing or were the in
evitable outcome of an effort to hasten the war to a
swift conclusion instead of proceeding slowly and
taking ample time for preparation.
In this condition of affairs the public should be on
' guard against the attempts that are being made in
I certain quarters to array one set of officials against
j another. It will be remembered that the yellow jour
; nals not long ago endeavored to place Sampson and
', Schley in conflict, and at one time went so far as to
assert that the two heroes were personally antago
nistic. A similar attempt is now being made to array
! General Miles against the Secretary of War and to
j provoke them to mutual recrimination.
Up to this time all these efforts to embroil high
1 officials in the scandal have failed. To a reporter who
i asked him what answer he had to make to certain
statements said to have been given out by Miles Sec
retary Alger replied: "I have seen what was in the
papers about General Miles' reported utterances, his
i demand for an investigation, and charges about with
held or garbled messages, and I will say frankly I
j don't believe a word of it. I don't believe he ever
1 said it."
The answer was in every respect proper. If Miles
has charges to make they should be formulated and
submitted in an official report. It is certainly not
credible that he has made grave complaints reflecting
upon the War Department to irresponsible persons
and sent them out in a form easily subject to the ex^
aggerations and misrepresentations of every one who
repeats them.
That much suffering among the troops has resulted
from the insufficiency of the supplies furnished them
may be accepted as fully proved, but that the amount
of the suffering and the degree of insufficiency of sup
plies have been grossly exaggerated is beyond ques
tion. What is needed now, therefore, is an investiga
tion that will separate the truth from the falsehood
and make clear the real condition of things. It will
then be possible to determine whether the War De
partment has been mismanaged or whether it has
done the best that could have been done in making
ready a volunteer army and hurrying it to the front
in order to close the war before the yellow fever sea
son began in the West Indies. Such an investigation
I is imperative, and the sooner it is begun the better.
Of course Major McLaughlin will be chairman of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 1898.
DEOTH ACCORDING TO FICTION.
THE death of Rev. A. P. Dodge of Georgia was
sufficiently different from the ordinary style of
shuffling off to merit notice. Mr. Dodge, aside
from being a minister of the gospel, was very rich,
and could afford to indulge his foibles. Among these
was the preservation'of the body of his first wife. The
lady had left her tenement of clay some fifteen years
before, and stipulated that it should be preserved un
til he had left his own, at which time the two should
be buried side by side. Mr. Dodge not only agreed
to this, but got a new wife to help him watch over the
first.
Suddenly the minister was told by his physician
that there remained to him of life a period not much
over fifteen minutes. Dodge was not rattled. Indeed,
he did not seem to care particularly. Instead of grow
ing maudlin or preternaturally pious he ordered
glasses and wine, and upon their arrival proposed a
toast to the long life and prosperity of all present.
Then he sank back on his pillow and his soul took
flight to regions where human judgment may not fol
low.
This is not the style of death which is expected
from the truly good, and certainly not the sort in
which a minister of the gospel is supposed to indulge.
It breaks clear away from old traditions and .follows
the pattern laid down in recent fiction of which "Quo
Vadis" is a sample. We hope Dodge will rest well
and that the bones of Mrs. Dodge No. i, having
found a grave after all these years, will enjoy the same
boon. As to No. 2, she is entitled to double condo
lences. May the fortune left by the two deceased
bring to her a measure of comfort.
THE WAR AS A PUBLIC BLESSING.
ALL the world has by this time recognized that
our war with Spain has resulted in a benefit to
humanity. Even the Spaniards themselves
doubtless perceive in their lucid intervals a distinct
profit in getting rid of colonies that were a source of
corruption in their politics and the cause of wars that
entailed heavy taxation upon their people. As for the
other nations of Europe they are so well aware of the
benefits growing out of our victories and conquests
that they are devising ways and means of getting a
share of them and getting it early.
There is then no question of the good resulting from
the war, as it affects the larger destinies of mankind
and the development of industry and commerce. These
larger issues, however, by no means include all the
benefits flowing from the victories we have achieved.
There are some of a minor nature of sufficient import
ance to attract attention and merit notice. Two of
these are reported from New York, and may be cited
as examples of the whole group.
The first is the development of a genuine patriotism
in a class of people who have been in the past more or
less indifferent to their duties to the nation. Colonel
John Jacob Astor, it appears, affords a striking illus
tration of this. It is reported that while serving in
the army he saw the need of the Government for
money, and learned by companionship with his com
rades in the field how hard is the struggle for exist
ence among a large proportion of his fellow-citizens.
He thereupon determined that hereafter he would pay
the full measure of taxes upon his estate, and since his
return home has ordered his agents to go over the list
of his holdings, properly appraise them and make a
return, which it is said will result in largely increasing
his taxes.
A more curious benefit is reported by a New York
physician, who asserts that-,a large number of persons
who would have died during the depressing heat of
the summer, under ordinary conditions, managed to
gain strength and live by reason of the animation with
which they were inspired by the outbreak of war and
the glorious victories that followed. Patriotic ardor
was the medicine that roused them and bore them
safely through the crisis of disease. According to this
authority more people were saved by the war than
were killed in its battles, and as a vitalizer and health
preserver the hundred days of hostilities were more
efficacious than any nerve* tonic on the market.
A question whether it was worth while to go to war
to attain these minor benefits is not pertinent to the
issue. Of course it would not be expedient as a gene
ral rule to whip a foreign nation every time we wished
to make an Astor pay his taxes, nor to call out 200,
000 volunteers and set all the brass bands of the coun
try playing patriotic airs for the purpose of bracing
up the languid invalids of the sweltering East. It
would be cheaper to let the big man dodge taxes
as usual and to help the sick by sending them to
spend the summer in California, where the air is al
ways invigorating, and where, according to Edison,
the waters endow the human liver with so much vi
tality that after death of the man the liver has to be
killed with a club.
Nevertheless these minor benefits are worth adding
to the sum total of what has been gained by our
"pleasantness" with Spain. A new thrill of life spirit
ual and physical has been felt in New York, and in
the rest of the country as well. Let us therefore re
joice and cheer ourselves on this delightful day of rest
by indulging the hope that these good effects will be
as lasting as those produced in the world of politics
and government.
Members of the Federal Court have no need for
personal worry over the circumstance that the Gov

jurists, as yet unborn, be wearing the gowns of office.
Ex-Secretary Sherman may be old and out of polit
ical life, but he occasionally makes remarks to which
the country is ready to listen. In his objections to the
way American soldiers have been treated there is not
the slightest evidence of dotage.
It appears that the American soldier killed recently
in the streets of Cavite brought his own fate upon
himself by discharging a revolver when there was not
the slightest occasion for doing so. There is no
profit in getting too gay.
Americans will not tolerate abuse of American sol
diers. The country pays to have them properly cared
for, and if they do not get the care the responsible
persons may expect a large dose of trouble.
Two young shoplifters have been dismissed with a
reprimand. There was no doubt as to their guilt, but
they did not claim to be victims of kleptomania, and
naturally the court felt kindly toward them.
Admiral Sampson may attend the peace jubilee at
Omaha, and he would be certain of a hearty greet
ing. Sampson knows a thing or two about the best
modern methods of creating peace.

statement that no more troops are to be sent to Man

some sense knocked into them.

is now virtually a part of the United States. There

WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
To say aught ag-ainst a woman is
never a pleasing task; but when a
woman descends from her high estate
to become an unholy and unclean wan
ton, polluting her environment with
the utter foulness of a total and irre
deemable depravity, her sex no longer
protects her. To permit it to do so
would be a wrong to others. I do not
refer to the outcast, for misfortune
may have been her lot, and charity ex
tends to her a hand, knowing her to
be no worse than some to whom is
permitted still to wear the cloak of
respectability. I refer particularly to
that wretched and despicable creature,
Margaret L. Shepherd, who parades
her own infamy for money, and while
doing so professes to be a reformer. In
her chosen task she slanders women
the hem of whose raiment she is not fit
to touch, and in telling of the lewdness
of Sisters of Charity, one of whom she
professes to have been, lies with a
venom unequaled, and shows a black
ness of heart never exceeded by thetra
ducer of innocence. Lost to all shame,
dead to the impulses which stir wom
anhood and purity, her words are the
words of the abandoned. A slanderer,
a liar, a mischief-maker, she deserves
the scorn of men, the loathing of
women. I can write this fairly be
cause all the traditions of my youth
were of the severest type of Protest
antism. In the town whew I was reared
there was no Catholic church, and as a
boy I had no idea that a Catholic looked
and acted like any one else. It was my
boyish notion that Catholics were of a
separate type. But later in life there
came to me a knowledge that Catholics
and Protestants serve one Master, only
through different form, are touched by
kindred emotions, are under the same
flag, love the Sams' country and the
same God. I have learned to revere
the unselfish devotion of the Sisters,
their courage, their kindness and their
whiteness of soul, and I abhor such
vermin as this Shepherd, a tonguing
strumpet, unfit to associate with de
cency and beyond the desire of reform.
That she can find profit in selling her
wares is a reproach to our civiliza
tion.

Democratic, Republican, Populist nor

a ticket which is destined to be licked,
partly because it deserves this fate and
partly that the Republicans have been
shrewd enough to put up a better one.
But neither gathering had special rea
son to feel proud of itself. I had ex

speeches, and to get spellbound, but
out of the dozens delivered there were
not above four appealing to any emo

delivered by General Barnes, who was
there only as a spectator, and kindly
filled in an interval which Reuben Lloyd
had created by lingering over lun^h.
Another was the address of Davis in
nomination of Gage. It was finished,
scholarly, incisive, giving evidence of
nicety In preparation of phrases; in
construction and delivery the work of
an elocutionist, not an orator. The
best speech from a delegate was that
of T. B. Hutchinson in behalf of Judge
Buckles, the Judge subsequently going
down to honorable defeat. I must also
advert to the remarks of Van Duzer
and the witty monologue of Matlock.
Otherwise the talk was not only com

place themselves on exhibition. ,As to
detail of the convention. It was so com
pletely covered by the exhaustive re
ports of The Call that nothing remains

simply to lead up to the status of Sac
ramento as a convention city.
Sacramento was the very essence of
hospitality. The citizens had decor
ated the Pavilion to a place of beauty

of the perspiration shed was due either
to the outflow of oratory or the re
ceipt of the same. Nights were cool
and under their somnolent influence
the crickets reposed and permitted vis

be leisure for an experience so common-

tinue to be a convention city it must
provide hotel facilities. Ido not see
why It cannot have as .good a hotel
as Los Angeles, San Jose, Santa Cruz
or other Californian towns. Why
should Fresno and San Rafael excel it
in this respect? Never having been

away. Yet, as damaging as appear
ances are, I take it there is no justice
in the hasty assumption that Mrs. Bot
kin is a murderer. Accidents will
happen, and long series of coincidences,
forming an almost perfect chain, will
at the last be overthrown. I do not
see why the possibility of accident
should have been overlooked. Candy
is not always pure. A gentleman in
this town, who sells chemicals, one day
got an order from a candy manufac
turer for a chemical which had the
power to stain a bright yellow, but was
a deadly poison. Thinking there must
be a mistake, he communicated with
the head of the candy house, who in
formed him that it was the poison that
was wanted, that by using it a quar
ter of a cent per pound could be saved
in the manufacture of candy. My
friend declined to fill the order, but
there is no reason to suppose that all
other dealers refused. If manufac
turers use poison even in infinitesimal
quantity the likelihood of their
slaughtering an occasional customer
must be recognized. But to make a
technical flght for Mrs. Botkin, or to
advance the absurd plea of insanity,
would be an error. If a gift deliber
ately poisoned was sent to Mrs. Dun
ning the sender is sane enough to merit
any punishment the law may prescribe
for the most unforgivable form of as
sassination.
Despite the valorous achievements of
the American army, out of the clamor
of accusation against the War Depart
ment there is likely to come a definite
demonstration that some one in the
War Department has been negligent,
that the brave soldiers have undergone
unnecessary hardships, and that some
of them have been driven to their
graves by the criminal brutality of
those superior in authority. I hope the
investigation will be bo thorough that
the guilty shall all be punished, even if
the head of the department be involved.
I never ran across any particular rea
son for having confidence in Alger, and
never had any, but that he is guilty of
cruel wrongs against the troops,
wrongs profitable to himself and his
friends, is simply beyond belief. How
ever, the charges are so direct that un
less he insist upon an investigation
there will remain a cloud upon his rep
utation so long as his reputation sur
vives, and he does not need this. But
while one shrinks from crediting the
ru/nors there Is evidence that on. board
shipa bearing sick and wounded delica
cies furnished by the Red Cross for
Just such emergencies were sold to the
sufferers. This Is too bad to be fitting
ly characterized. The guilty men should
have swung from the yardarm. As
they escaped this they should at least
be exposed, branded as murderers and
thieves and be dismissed in disgrace
from the positions they dishonor.

It would pain me to call the attention
of the Examiner to certain of its short
comings, save that I do so in the spirit
of kindness. I am grieved to be
obliged to state that the reputation of
the Examiner for honesty has been Im
paired. It is regarded as occupying the
moral plawe on which are to be found
the confidence man and the picker of
pockets. Now there is an opportunity
to demonstrate that it has a shred of
conscience left, that it is once in a
while ashamed of its indecency. Of late
the sheet has been advertising a cer
tain pyrotechnic show, has begged
patronage for it on the ground that a
portion of the proceeds were to go to
the Maine monument, to be erected to
the glory of Hearst. This is the same
monument for which solicitors have
been promised a rake-off of 10 per cent
on all sums collected. The offer was
not publicly made, for, despite rumor
to the contrary, Hearst has a moiety
of modesty left and does not propose to
let the world know how he loves him
self. The pyrotechnics have been and
gone. I suggest that there be an open
accounting of receipts and a statement
as to what share is to go to the Hearst
monument. The people who were
begged in the name of patriotic char
ity to attend have a right to know all
about it. If the information be with
held a suspicion will surely arise that
a new bunko scheme as low as the
baseball tournament of a few months
ago has been sprung on them. I have
heard that the tournament was an ar
rant swindle, and labor under the sor
row of believing the information cor
rect. While assured that my personal
opinion Is not by the temporary and
empty head of the concern held of high
value, I can assure him that there are
others taking my view. Has the pub
lic been done up once more? Proba
bly, yes. To overthrow the contention
requires only that a few figures be pro
duced, duly sworn to by somebody not
connected with the Examiner office.

As nearly as I am able to Judge, ex-
Marshal Creed of Sausalito is a bully
and a coward, as bad a citizen as he
was official. He is a big fellow, run
ning mostly to paunch, and rig-ht in the
forefront of that protuberance should
be deposited a kick. Creed has Just
whipped a reporter of half his own
weight for having told the truth about
him. Had the reporter been two-thirds
the Creed avoirdupois this would never
have happened. I hope the overgrown
swaggerer will soon run against a man
of sufficient size to mix up with him
and teach him a lesson in manners.
It is a strange circumstance and
verges on distressfulness that in the
effort to advocate a movement entirely
proper and commendable I am certain
to run counter to the ideas prevailing
in the Home of Peace. To state. that
this home is the editorial den of the
Examiner is hardly necessary. There
love abides, and there Andrew, put
ting on a halo and a frown, directs the
destinies of the world. Sometimes the
destinies fly the track, but no matter.
It seems to me that when General
Shafter return 3to this city he should
get a reception radiant with red fire,
noisy with bands and with shouting,
and that the people should all be out
to welcome the hero of Santiago. But
I know the Examiner will not agree. '
The unpleasant duty of bouncing the
Examiner's representatives from Cuba
because next to the yellow fever they
were the most malign things there fell
to Shafter. That he performed the duty
quickly and well is of record. Of course
a wave of rancor invaded the Home of
Peace and some traces of it remain.
Nevertheless, sympathizing as they do
with the exiled outfit, the residents of
San Francisco confess to a liking for
Shafter and a degree of pride In his
achievements. I think the Examiner
can be induced to permit the giving to
the general of a reception, and even
that it will later go so far as to claim
entire credit for the affair.
HUMORS OF SCHOOL, EXAMINATION.
It appears that at an elementary ex
amination in English which was lately
held in a school near New York two sen
tences were given out to be corrected by
the younger scholars. The first sentence
was to be corrected as to its subject mat
ter, and the second sentence as to Its
syntax. These were the sentences:
"The hen has three legs."
"Who done it?"
When the papers were handed In it waa
found that one of the examinees had ap
parently regarded the sentence as subtly
connected in thought, for his answer waa
as follows:
"The hen didn't done it; God done it."â

Furor in Two County

NEGOTIATIONS OUT OFF BY A
DECISIVE VOTii.
Dittmar Announces VThat He Shall
Decline the Nomination for
Congress in the First
District.
SpÂ«eial Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Aug. 27.â The County
Central Committees of the Democratic
and Populist parties set the date for
the county nominating conventions of
each party for the same day, August
27,. with the end In view of accomplish
ing fusion of the two organizations.
Both conventions convened in this city
at 10 o'clock this morning, and up to 6
o'clock In the evening nothing had been
accomplished. The proeeeedings were
characterized by scer.-s of confusion
never equaled In the political history
of Northern California.
Early in the day the Democratic con
vention appointed a conference com
mittee to meet with a like body from
the Populist convention, and it was not
until 6 o'clock that they got together.
At 7 o'clock the Populists rejected the
whole fusion proposition by a derisive
vote. The Populist platform was then
taken up and read in the convention.
During the confusion of the afternoon
a plank in the platform was read in
dorsing T. W. Shanahan for Governor,
Fowler for Lieutenant Governor and
Dr. J. A. Cole for Congress in this dis
trict. While the convention was wait
ing on the conference committee a
more pacific plank was substituted, in
dorsing the entire middle-of-the-road
State ticket. The substitution of this
plank without the convention's con
sent was singularly not noticed by any
of the delegates, though the middle-of
the-road declaration went through
with a rush.
I T pon the adoption of the platform
M. E. Dittmar, the fusion nominee for
Congress in the First District, arose
and in a calm and dispassionate speech '
declared that while he should decline
the nomination for Congress, he would
support the Maguire ticket and take
the stump In Its behalf. His newspa
per, the Morning Searchlight, would
support Democrats and Populists alike
throughout the campaign. He then re
fused to take further part in the delib
erations of the conventions.
The failure of the fusion proposition
will Insure a clean sweep for the Re
publicans in county affairs and give
to Henry T. Gage a large plurality for
Governor.

PLANS FOR THE CAMPAIGN
GOOD GOVERNMENT LEAGUE IN
THE SADDLE.
County Ticket Will Be Nominated
and the Support of All Re
form Forces Solicited in
Its Behalf.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 27.â The Good Gov- j
ernment League delegates, who were
deprived of their seats In the county
convention through the disreputable !
tactics of the Rea gang, reassembled !
In convention at Rutherford Hall to- j
day. J. R. Johns was chairman and ,
K. W. Conant secretary. A majority
of delegates was present and the meet- j
ing was an enthusiastic one.
It was decided to take an active part j
In the campaign and put up a ticket j
including men who would command |
the respect of the voters of the entire j
county.
It was stated that no steps had been j
taken looking to amalgamation with j
the Democratic and Populist forces,
and, although a conference committee
hud been appointed, it had not yet met
with other like committees. The com- j
mittee on platform reported as fol
lows, and the report was unanimously
adopted:
The Republicans of Santa Clara County
in convention assembled and represent- j
ing the movement for good government I
Indorse the entire State Republican tick- \
et headed by that stalwart Republican
and leader, Henry T. Gage.
We heartily pledge our support of and
will work to secure the carrying out of
everj' provision of the platform of the
Republican State Convention at Sacra
mento. ,
The following plank from said plat
form, which we especially indorse, haa
been brought about by the unimpeach
able array of evidence of fraud and cor
ruption paraded before the credentials j
committee of the Republican State Con- |
vention by the representatives of good
government from Santa Clara County:
"The purity of elections is the salvation i
of the country- All parties willingly
submit to an election fairly conducted
i and in which the ballots have been hon
estly counted; no other election should
be tolerated or permitted. The founda
tion of all selections of officials is the
I primary of a political party; such pri
maries should be as honestly conducted
as general elections. No partisan is
bound by the decision of a dishonest prl- j
I mary." ,
In compliance with the pro-visions of i
the Republican State platform. which |
states that no partisan is bound by the de
cision of a dishonest primary, and owing
to the fact that the primary election of
delegates to the so-called Republican
convention was carried by fraud and
corruption, as proved by affidavits of our
most stalwart Republicans of Santa
Clara County, the delegates voted for
by the workers for good government
are declared the regular delegates to this ,
convention without reference to the re- j
turns made to the County Central Com-
The burden of taxation is resting very
heavily upon the citizens of Santa Clara
County, owLng to the unexampled prodi
gality and wastefulness in the expendi
ture of our public funds that has char
acterized the administration of the finan
cial affairs of the county in the past.
All candidates nominated or Indorsed by
this convention are hereby pledged to a
thoroughly honest, business-like and
economical administration of our county
affairs. and to a reduction of taxation to
the lowest possible limit consistent with
the public welfare.
We view with the most profound regret
and alarm the making of our public
schools a part of the political machine in
this county. ' _ -
We commend the pupils of the High
School of San Jose for the fearless and
manly fight they are making against po
litical Interference in school affa r*.
which is demoralizing our boys and girls
and crippling the efficiency of our schools.
A committee of eleven shall be appoint
ed by the chair to confer with all other
persons or organizations that are work
ing in me interests of good government
for Santa Clara County, with a view to
ward making suÂ«-h arrangements as will
further the cause of good government
and tend to the overthrow of corruption,
rings and bosses.
A vote of thanks was tendered to
the Ministerial Union for Its action in
sending a resolution to the State con
vention protesting against the seating
of the Rea delegates.
A resolution protesting against the
appointment of John D. Mackenzie, one
of Rea's lieutenants, as postmaster or
this city, was adopted and ordered for
warded to President McKinley.
The fallowing were appointed a con
ference committee to meet all parties
and organizations working in the in
terest of good government: W. H.

HUSTLING FOR SACRAMENTO.
THE LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGN
WILL NOW OPEN.
Some Democrats and Republicans
Whose Names Are Heard in the
Political Woods as the
Time Nears.
The charter and the senatorshlp will
serve to add zest and importance to the
legislative campaign in San Francisco,
and will probably provide its chief feat
ures.
The prospects In the legislative field
in both parties will now take form rap-
Idly, since the State conventions are over
with and municipal politics come to the
front. It 1b yet a little too early for a
showing of prospective strength on the
part of legislative candidates, but the
woods are pretty well tilled with am
bitious one 6 who want to represent tne
metropolis in the body that makes and
fixes laws for California. The following
are among those who are either "being
talked of" for the Senate and Assemrny
or who are themselves mentioning their
ambitions around headquarters.
In the Eighteenth Senatorial District
among the Republican aspirants and pos
sibilities are Michael Coffee, who was
once an unsuccessful candidate In this
strongly Democratic District; James Fal
lon, County Committeeman, who was a
candidate for the Assembly at a former
election, and Henry Kelly, who won the
race for the Assembly two years ago. It
Is also understood that "Jack" Hoey has
senatorial ambitions and Is a prominent
candidate for the nomination. There is
quite a crop of Democratic aspirants In
the field. For some time Alex. Greggains
has been regarded as a possible candi
date, but he declares that he will not
enter the race. Charles Gildea and P. J.
Tomalty are spoken of, as are Thomas
Farrell, ex-polltlcian and now bailiff in
Judge Mogan's Police Court; John Twigg,
a member of the committee of one hun-
dred, and John Buckley, superintendent
of the Hall of Justice. Edward Harring
ton of the Sheriff's office is another possi
ble candidate.
In the Twentietn Senatorial District
Eugene E> Bert Is understood to be a Re
publican candidate for re-election. With
no opposition yet In the neld.
There is a small army of possible can
didates for the Senate on the Republican
side in the Twenty-second District, com
posed of the Fortieth and Forty-first As
sembly districts. Assemblyman Sig Bett
man has for some time been understood
as in the field. Others who are included
in the speculations of politicians are: H.
C. Dibble, Frank H. Powers, Z. M. Dodge,
Jacob Samuels, Architect Charles Mooser,
Thomas Eager. George Walker and T. P.
Riordan. On the Democratic side it is
understood that M. C. Hassett may seek
the nomination, and that Percy L. Hen
derson would be willing to lead the for
lorn hope.
The Twenty-fourth District, com
posed of the Forty-second and rorty
thlrd Assembly districts, is likewise fer
tile of ambitous lawmakers. Leon Den
nery and George A. Williams, who was
an independent candidate in opposition
to the late Senator Mahoney four years
ago, are out early and vigorously for the
nomination, and other x-epubllcans who
are understood to be ready to enter the
race are Attorney Thomas Kase, Alonto
Henry, M. Flynn and William H. Brady.
R. Porter Ashe and Joseph P. Hayes are
names that the Democratic convention
For the Assembly Peter Kelly of the
License Collector's office and James Len
non are among the Republican possibil
ities in the Twenty-eighth, and ex-As
semblyman E. F. Lacy is one of the Dem
ocratic aspirants. â¢
In the Twenty-ninth E. J. Faulkner of
the License Collector's office Is in line for
the Democratic nomination, and D. J.
Crowley, a member of the Count-* Com
mittee two years ago; Stephen Nolan and
John McDonald, who sought the nomina
tion two years ago, are other Democratic
aspirants.
Thomas Doran and Isaac Erb, both dep
uties in the County Clerk's office, are pos
sible Republican nominees in the Thir
tieth District. In the Democratic ranks
the most prominently mentioned aspi
rants are ex-Asse mblyman Barney Con
way George Smith of the Committee of
100 James Crelghton and James Creegan.
The citizenship of theThirty-flrst pro
vides quite a list according to current po
litical speculation. On the Republican
side are Thomas Doherty, M. J. McDon
ald, Thomas Brophy. James Brady and
Frank Keogh. Among the many Demo
crats willing to try their hands at law
giving are. James Kennedy of the BherilT s
office and president of the Excelsior Club
James McElamey, Joseph F. Carrick and
John Mohegan.
In the Thirty-second Robert Donahue is
being groomed by John F. MoGovern, sec
retary of the Harney County Committee.
Ex-Policeman W. H. Harrison, now a
health inspector and a candidate for the
Assembly twice before, is out for the
nomination. James Lucy of the Superin
tendent of Streets' office and James
Mooney, well known in the politics of the
district are also Democratic aspirants.
In the Thirty-third Robert McCulloch Is
a Republican candidate for the nomina
tion and the Democratic candidates In
clude Joseph Mahaney and John Holland.
David Cramer, an ex-wharflnger, Is a
Republican possibility In the Thirty-fifth,
and in the Thirty-sixth Deputy County
Clerk Bert Mahoney and ex-County Gom
mitteeman John McCarthy are in the Re
publican list.
Fred Eggers and Attorney Fisk are Re
publican candidates in the Thirty-seventh
and in the Thirty -eighth Deputy Assessor
William Rtckard and Charles C. Morris,
late secretary- of the County Committee,
are leading Republican candidates for the
nomination.
The Fortieth is one of the strong Re
publican districts in which Democratic
candidates do not swarm early. The Re
publicans most prominently spoken of for
the Assembly here to date are Deputy
County Clerk David N. Short, J. J. Cas
sldy. Captain E. J. Healy and T. Macs-
Among the Republicans in the fteld in
the Forty-first are Ben Fehneman, Oscar
Lewis and H. C. Firebaugh
In the Forty-third M. J. Flynn, Charles
McClaln and Lon Henry are Republican
aspirants.
The Forty-fourth holds a good many
would-be legislators. Among The Repub
licans are J. F. Martlnoni, who was a can
didate two years ago: J. H. Nelson, H. J.
Perazzi Frank Browell, I. E. Jarrell and
ex-Assemblyman M. H. Barry
Arthur W. Spear, son of the Surveyor of
the Port, is one of the Republican aspi
rants in the Forty-fifth. _ :
There are many other legislative ambi
tions and the process of natural and po
litical selection is just fairly beginning
along with tho hustling.

REFORMS ARE IN ORDFR
VARIOUS SCHEMES TO RE

Investigating Committee Appointed
by the Supreme Lodge Is Still
Probing Alleged Ir
regularities.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 27.-The Su
preme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, is
about all that remains of the biennial
encampment. All of the Uniform Rank
and subordinate lodge companies have
left the city, and Camp Colgrove is de
serted.
The Rathbone Sisters and Knights
of Khorassan held their final sessions
to-day. The investigating committee
appointed by the Supreme Lodge is
still holding meetings, but will prob
ably not report at this meeting. The
Supreme Lodge has much business to
consider yet and may be in session a
week longer.
Representative W. L. Seism of Ne
braska, who has been fighting the offi
cers of the Supreme Lodge vigorously
for several months and Is reported to
have made charges of excessive ex
pense accounts, has introduced a num
ber of resolutions and documents at
this session, all having a tendency to
restrict all the officers.
One resolution aimed at the su
preme keeper of records and seals, says
he shall keep an accurate account,
showing the exact financial condition
of the Supreme Lodge at all times,

Bisks Her Life to Bescue
Companions.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 27.â Three young
people of this city narrowly escaped
drowning while at a picnic near Taylor
Springs this afternoon. On the lake near

in the middle the raft upset and all were
thrown Into the water.
Miss Bessie Porter, a daughter of Judge
W. W. Porter, went to the rescue. She
waded in until the water reached her
chin, caught one young girl by the hair
and the other by the dress and got them
ashore. The boy swam out alone. The
girls would surely have been drowned had
Miss Porter not been there.

GAGE OPENS
THE CAMPAIGN
AMID CHEERS
A Rousing Reception to the
Republican Leader at
Oakland.
Introduced to the Voters by Dr. George C.
Pardee, the Man He Defeated at the
Convention.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Augr. 27.
The booming of cannon planted In the
â center of Broadway announced to Ala
meda County to-night that the State Re
publican campaign had opened. A few
minutes later the music of the band and
the clanging of the engine's bell pro-
Claimed to the crowd at Seventh and
Broadway that the man who had been
eelected to lead the Republican party of
California to victory was about to be
â¢welcomed by the man and by the county
â¢whom he had so recently defeated.
It was a significant meeting, that of
Henry T. Gage and George C. Pardee, and
It was an object lesson to those who wit
nessed it. When the man from Los An
geles stepped from the train he could not
have received a warmer welcome had he
been returning to his own city. Mayor
Thomas, George C. Pardee and W. R.
Davis extended the hand of greeting
while the crowd cheered.
Then the red fire burned. The band
put forth a stronger effort, the cannon
belcbed out a more energetic roar and the j
Pondinkle tried to down the shouting of ]
the Young Men's Republican Club.
After accepting the grasp of a few j
Bcore of offered hands Henry T. Gage â¢
was led to a carriage, which he occupied ]
with his companion. Judge Frank Davis
of Los Angeles, Mayor Thomas and j
George C. Pardee.
Preceded by the artillery mounted on |
a wagon the escort formed with the j
band leading and hundreds 01 stalwarts i
and young Republicans swelled the line
that came after the carriages. The march '
Included men who are not often seen in j
a street march and their presence was I
eignifioant of the enthusiasm with which j
the campaign has started out.
Although only one day has elapsed since
the State convention has adjourned, i
there was a great outpouring of Repub- '
licans, who rapidly responded to the call |
to ratify the work done at Sacramento, i
Oakland can always be depended upon to j
enthuse over Republicanism, and al
though the notice was so short, the size i
of the crowd and the intensity of the en- j
thusiasm was no surprise to old-timers.
Oakland boasts of all manner of Republi
can organizations, and all are ready to j
respond as they did to-night to such an j
extent that the visitors from the orange i
land could not conceal their surprise.
Inside the Macdonough Theater those !
on the platform faced tiers upon tiers of
people who used all possible means of ex
pressing approval whenever an opportu
nity was presented.
The decorations were confined to the
national colors, and as the music of "The
Star Spangled Banner" filled the big au
ditorium the events of the past few
months were brought to mind and doubt
less many memories drifted to that scene
in which many Oaklanders took part
where the same Inspired music was heard
for the first time at Santiago and Porto
Rico.
The front row of the platform might be
photographed as a text for the Republi
can campaign in California. There sat
Henry T. Gage, a stranger to Oakland,
yet a man whom every Republican in
.Alameda County is now proud to follow.
All know that but for Gage it would have
been Pardee, but that memory had no ef
fect on the crowd, and certainly appeared
to have none on the man who presided
over the meeting.
Next to the guest of the evening was
WILL FITTINGLY HONOR OLD AGE.
â¦'Father" Lorenzo Waugh, Who Enjoys the Distinction of
Being the Oldest Methodist Preacher in the
World.
"Father" Lorenzo Wau^h's four-score-and-tenth blrthdoy is to be flt
tlnply celebrated this evening in the Howard-street Methodist Church. The
Barred edifice will be crowded with friends and admirers of the grand old
man and addresses of congratulation are to be made by the pastor, Rev. J.
A. B. Wilson, Senator George C. Perkins and others.
"Father" Wangh is said to be the oldest Methodist preacher in the
â world. Age has not dimmed his faculties, but on the contrary he is able
to preach on his favorite themes with surprising ability.
He was born on the 28th day of August, 1808, near Greenbrier River,
"West Virginia, in what is now Pocahontas County. He is the oldest of
twelve children. In his younger days he knew Daniel Webster, John Quincy
Adams, Thomas H. Benton and other great men who figured in American
history. He arrived in California in 1852, having come over the plains in
an ox team, and on his arrival he was met by General Vallejo, who made
him a present of 320 acres of land in Sonoma County. This land he after
ward divided between his children, retaining forty acres for himself, which
he afterward sold for $5500.
It haa always been the aged minister's boast that he never used to
bacco or intoxicating liquor of any kind, and to thiÃ fact he attributes his
long life. He is now residing in Los Ollvos, Santa Barbara County,
where he enjoys the best of health and strength.
Senator George C. Perkins, who has Just
come from Washington, and who prom
ised that at a future time he would tell
of that portion of the administration of
President McKinley which did not ordi
narily come before the public. The Sen
ator got off a little joke at his own ex
pense that not one in five hundred seemed
to grasp. He referred to George C. Par
dee s Initials as standing for "Good Cali
fornia Patriot," and the crowd cheered,
not noticing that the same initials are
also those of George C. Perkins.
Beside the Senator sat George C. Par
dee, who was as affable and as much
master of the situation and. of himself as
when on the platform at SacramenV
withdrawing his name from the nomina
tion for Governor.
W. R. Davis, who received a defeat st
the primaries that has a strong resem
blance to that of his rival at Sacramento,
was there.
Judge Frank Davis, who placed Mr.
Gape In nomination, and Mayor- Thomas
were there to talk lightly of personal de
feat and to forward the success of the
party at large.
The Meeting Called to Order.
Senator Perkins, in calling the meeting
to order, said:
"Fellow Citizens: I reiolce with you
that we meet here to extend greetings to
our leader placed In nomination in Sacra
mento."
He proceeded to tell of the State Conven
tion, saying that the delegates were repre
sentatives of the Republican party. a:'.d.
therefore, representatives of the people of
the State of California. "We had hoped
that the nomination might fall to one of
our sons, but the fates willed otherwise."
Senator Perkins said that the people
were satisfied with the result, and that
they would as loyally stand by H. T. Gage
as they would by Pardee. had he been nom
inated' He eulogized Pardee, McKinley
and Hilborn. Xot only the California Rep
resentatives did their duty, but the whole
administration showed that It was an hon
est representation of the people. The he
roes of the war were briefly touched upon,
producing tremendous cheers from the
audience.
George C. Paraee Chairman.
George C. Pardse was introduced as
: chairman. He said:
"Ladies and Gentlemen: As you will no-
I tice by my voice. I have been to Sitcra
! m<*nto. I used It up In the past two or
| three days shoutlnff for my political an
- tagonist. We went up as Btrong antago
! nlsts, but we have come back as firm
i friends."
Dr. Pardee told of his approaching the
delegates from the south and clearly
stating the position of the people of Ala
meda County. He told them that whoever
was nominated would have the hearty
support of the people of this county.
"Alameda is not thin-skinned, and we
I shall, I believe, give a bigger majority
i than ever for the Republican ticket this
fall. I want to thoroughly impress this
fact upon our visitors from the citrus
belt, so that they can go home and tell
their friends that the banner will not go
south this year, although the nomination
went there. I do not believe there is a
Republican in Alameda County who, when
! defeated, will sulk In his tent. I was
j beaten at Sacramento, but by a man
j whom every Republican may feel proud
! to follow."
Presented With a Bouquet.
B. Fehnemann stepped forward as Dr.
Pardee sat down and on behalf of the
Oro Fino Club of Los Angeles presented
Dr. Pardee with a large bouquet. He
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 1893.
BANNER OF THE BANNER REPUBLICAN COUNTY.
The State Republican Banner Presented to the Party Ten Years Ago and
Held From Election to Election by the County Giving the Greatest
Republican Vote.
said that Dr. Pardee and all the dele
gate* from Alameda County would be
made honorary members of the club, and
paid a passing tribute to ex-Senator Eli
I Denison, who originally presented the
I banner that has since caused so much
I friendly rivalry between Los Angeles and
j Alameda counties.
W. R. Davis, upon being Introduced,
said the position for the Republican party
of Alameda County was just where it
is at present, namely, having all of its
members standing shoulder to shoulder.
He suid that wherever he might be
placed, whether as private or general, he :
would give his heartfelt support to the
cause, and the cause that he would con
tinually uphold would be the causer of !
the great Republican party. He gave a
brief history of the party, dwelling in
particular upon its work durrng and suc
ceeding the Civil War.
It was the Republican party that dealt
so successfully with the great debt in
curred by the war and protected the un
fortunate by the great pension system,
he said. Whatever may come, the Re
publican party shall go on as the Instru
ment of the god of nations to teach mon
archies that republicanism is the most
nearly perfect form of government.
Dr. Pardee next introduced the quartet
of the Young Men's Republican Club, who
sang some original verses to the tune of
"There'll Be a Hot Time In the Old
Town To-Night" and "The Banks of the
Wabash." They were heartily received.
A Hit at MagTiire.
Tirey L. Ford, nominee for Attorney
General, upon being introduced gave Ma
guire a rather hard hit when he referred
to him as the Little Triple-Headed Giant
who was down in Los Angeles singing,
I "All Platforms Look Alike to Me." Mr.
I Ford also called attention to the fact, in a j
humorous manner, that the initials of the j
Republican gubernatorial nominee stood j
for "He's the Governor." He concludf-d
with a peroration upon the Republican :
party.
Edward Meserve of the Los Angeles del
egation said that the leaders for Maguire
in the south were not of the highest class. '
He was confident that the people of the I
south would not support them. He was i
sure that the people or the State had made
no mistake In nominating Mr. Gage,
whom, he said, was tha "pride of Los An
geles."
The Young Men's Republican Club quar
tet san^r again and were heartily encored, j
D. Edward Collinn was asked to speak |
for the business men of Oakland. He as
serted his strong alliance to the Republi
can party and desired to take his part in
carrying out the business principles In
augurated in lS9fi. He predicted certain
victory in November next.
The next speaker was Frank Davis of
Los Angeles, who nominated Mr. Gage at
Sacramento. He s.-ild in opening: It is
difficult for me to tell you new deeply the
people of Alameda have touched our

favorite son and found your citizens
firmly supporting Dr. Pardee. We were
out for fight.- We shook hands with them
and then were ready."
I Mr. Davis "joshed" "Billy" Friend In
a manner pleasing to the audience and
then went on to tell of the Los Angeles
victory In a humorous manner.
Mr. Davis fiercely referred to the Ex
aminer's underhand attack upon Henry
T. Gage.
"What Is the matter with the Demo
cratic party? How very narrow it must
be growing that Its leading organ In this
State can find no nlther issue than C. P.
Huntingdon! What is the matter with
the issue that our soldiers have fought
and died for? What are we to do with all
these captured Islands? If you want to
get knowledge of all petty political mean
nesses then read the Examiner. I deny
the Indirect charges made by that organ
that Henry T. Gage is allied with the
railroad. There cannot be. found a fairer,
more honest man in the length and
breadth of this fair State of ours."
Mr. Davis predicted a great victory for
Mr. Gage In the south, where he said that
not only all of the Republican votes will
be for him, but likewise many of the.
Democratic. He said that the people have
great hope of getting again the Republi
can banner that they surrendered to Ala
meda County in 1896. > i
Introduced Amid Cheers.
Henry T. ' Gage was Introduced amid
thundering cheers given by the assembled
audience, which all stood up when Dr.
Pardee mentioned . his name. His re
marks were very brief, due, he said, to
the lateness of the hour. ; " He â¢ said: ;
"Ladies â  and . Gentlemen:. I would .be
oblivious to ' the feelings that belong to
the human heart were - I not" moved by
this grand demonstration of the people of
Alameda County. â  I thank , you from the
bottom of my â  heart. â â  I â¢ know that this
demonstration does not come from the
love of any one man, but it comes from
the love for the grand principles of the
Republican party. We owe a great deal to
the magnanimity of your Dr. Pardee that
we were able to name a candidate for
Governor by acclamation. ~ The hour is
too late for me to make a speech, and so
I thank you on behalf of the Republican
candidates and Republican party. I shall
hope to meet and talk to you in the near
future." â¢ "â  . â¢ \ â¢"-:.â 
The Republican nominee for State
Treasurer, Captain Reeves ;of San Ber
nardino, was introduced, as Dr. Pardee
said, merely to let the people see who he
was. He made no speech, and with
cheers for the Republican party the dem
onstration closed.

A HOT TIME
IN A CAMP
OF VETERANS
Congressman Eugene F. Loud
Faces His Adversaries, Ask
ing for Justice.
Annual Encampment of the Army and Navy
Republican Leagueâ Gage Indorsed.
Seamans Elected Commander.
Delegates to the fifteenth annual en
campment of the Army and Navy Repub
lican League assembled at Alcazar Hall
at 2 p. m. yesterday. The session, lasting
from 2 o'clock until 6 p. m., was animated
throughout and at Intervals exciting.
A motion to Indorse Leon Jones for
Sheriff of San Francisco was carried
with cheers for Jones, but a motion to
Indorse Eugene P. Loud for Congress in
the Fifth District caused a breeze of
excitement and prompted Mr. Loud to
assert that his name had been brought
before the convention without his knowl
edge or consent. Sharp strife between
Los Angeles and Oakland over the office
of commander-in-chief resulted in an
other victory for the south. The honor
went to W. H. Seamans, a close personal
friend of Henry T. Gage, the Republi
can nominee for Governor.
The convention was called to order by
Judge McElroy, commander-in-chief.
Little time was lost in preliminaries. A
committee on credentials was appolntted,
but the hall was so densely packed with
Grand Army vett rans, who had assem
bled either as delegates or spectators,
that the committee had hard work to
get out of the main hall into a smaller
room. While the committee was exam
ining the credentials presented by the va
rious camps, the convention was enliv
ened by spirited speeches. The comman
der introduced Comrade Loud, and the
representative in Congress from the
Fifth responded. He observed that it
would not be the truth to say that the
call to speak was unexpected, as every
one knew that men in public life were
expected to speak on such occasions. He
recalled the incidents of his youth and
the great events of the war from 1861 to
1866, and paid a compliment to the civic
patriotism of the veterans, who were de
fending the civil interests of the coun
try as good citizens. He epoKe of his
own reluctance, as a public man, to ad
vocate that the country should embark
In a war with Spain. In substance he
said:
"Our work has not ended. The nation
has entered on a new course. Graver
questions now confront us than ever be
fore confronted this country. I dreaded
the embarkation of the country in another
war, fearing that questions of government
would arise that our constitution did not
provide for. We must legislate anew.
New forms of government must be intro
duced. When the year began these ques
tions were not considered. Away down
in the hearts of the American people
there is a sentiment that will not permit
the surrender of anything we have fought
for and conquered. I am conservative,
and have been called ultra-conservative;
but I realize that Porto Rico and Cuba
must be governed by the strong arm of
a powerful nation. In my Judgment, Cuba
will never pass from under the folds of
the American flag.
"The conditions and elements of com
mercial expansion of the Atlantic coast
of our country as applied to the retention
of Cuba and Porto Rico apply with equal
force to the Pacific Coast commercial de
mands In reference to the Philippine
Islands. A strong government is there
needed, so that the commerce of the Pa
cific will receive the advantage of tne
acquisition."
Colonel George Babeock was the next
on the platform, and he apoke of the new
page in the history of tne human race,
lie declared that tne flag should ever re
main where it now floats. He believed
that the war was ordained as a step in
the emancipation of the human race.
Speeches were made by W. H. Seamans,
General E. S. Salomon, Major E. A. Sher
man, ex-Governor Gosford, Colonel Tal
cott and Colonel C. L. Pierce.
W. H. H. Hart told the delegates about
a private interview which he had recently
with President McKinley. According to
the version of the ex-Attorney General
the interview lasted from midnight until
2 a. m. Schoonemaker of New Jersey
was present throughout the conference.
When the Interview began the President
expressed some doubt as to the wisdom
of returning the conquered islands of the
Philippine group, but a* the interview
progressed new light was shed on the
situation by General Hart and the New
Jersey statesman. At 2 o'clock, accord
ing to the official report of General Hart,
the President threw up his hands and
agreed that the Philippines should be re
tained if California demanded such reten
tion. The President declared that he
would do more for California than for any
other state of the Union, not excepting
his own State of Ohio. General Hart
therefore desired the convention to ex
press its sentiments on the question by a
resolution, which resolution should be
transmitted to President McKinley.
The tale was beautifully told by General
Hart.
The committee on credentials was now
ready to report, but some delegates be
longing to the disbanded Harrison Camp
desired recognition so they could vote on
the question of their own admission to
the convention before the consideration of
the committee report. They had a hint
obviously that the report did not recom
mend their admission. The veterans of
the Harrison Camp were persistent and
even noisy in their efforts to force the
chairman to submit to a popular vote of
all those present on the issue whetner
they should come in or not. Apparently
they were about to have their own way
when C. T. Masteller produced the offi
cial records to show that no such thing
existed in this world as the Harrison
Camp of the Army and Navy Republican
League. The camp once did exist, but in
1596 it was mustered out, disbanded,
dropped from the rolls, dissolved and ex
tinguishedâits charter had been revoked
and its existence terminated. The chair
ruled in effect that the delegates from
! Harrison Camp were not officially on
' earth and refused to entertain a motion
j from the myths. The ruling was a knock
out. The Harrisonians could not muster
! the courage to appeal from the decision
of the chair.
The reading of the report of the execu
tive committee followed. Delegates were
admitted from Camps Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 14 and 16. Past officers entitled to
seats were also recognized, making the
total number of votes in the convention
195.
When the convention was duly organ
j ized ex-Governor Gosford of Los Angeles
; made a stirrinp speech. In which he said
the Gage of battle has been thrown down.
i He remarked:
"I want to say to you old soldiers that
i Henry T. Gage is an honest man through
and through to the core of his heart. He
j can neither be bought nor bulldozed. He Is
blessed with a remarkable degree of cxc-
I cutiv-e ability, and is so gifted with per
i ceptive power that he can measure the
1 character of a man at a glance. He Is
â  the cleanest, bravest and best candidate
for Governor ever placed before tne peo
ple of California. The best interests of
the country demand that the Bepubli
cans should win the battle."
At this stage of the proceedings the
committee on resolutions, consisting of
Loud. Salomon, Babcock, Talcott and
Gosford, submitted the following report,
which was adopted:
Resolved, By th* Army and Navy Republi
can League, In annual encampment assembled,
that we heartily Indorse the platform adopted
by the Republican State convention in Sacra
mento, August 24, 1898.
Resolved, That we give the nominees of our
party our full and unqualified support and do
everything possible for the success of the Re
publican ticket.
Resolved. That we believe the great Repub
lican party to be the true and tried friend of
the veteran soldiers and sailors of the war for
Resolved! That we demand of the Republican
party that the claims of the veteran Union sol
diers and sailors for their share in the dis
tribution of Government employment be re-
OOgniMd,
A resolution Indorsing Leon Jones for
Sheriff of San Francisco and pledging
veterans to support him was adopted,
with three cheers for Jones.
Colonel Blackburn of Leland Stanford
Camp moved that the convention Indorse i
Eugene F. Loud for renominatlon for I
Congress in the Fifth District.
Comrade Houguet of Oakland asked if
Mr. Loud had ever raised his voice in
Congress against civil service. If there is i
Spy man that ought to be opposed to civil j
service it was the old soldier. 1 -.â¢

I want to know if he has ever raised his

down a man in the Third District, where
I live because he did not oppose civil ser
vice as applied to veterans. Better cut
him off now than to have him defeated at
the Dolls by a Democrat. L; ; .
Comrade Loud took the floor to speak,
but Comrade C. Mason Kinne gestured for
permission to say a word.

RATIFY THE ACTION
OF THE CONVENTION
Republicans of Tehama County Hold
a Jollification Meeting at
Bed Bluff.
RED BLUFF, Aug. 27.â The cam
paign seems to have opened early here,
as was evidenced by the Republican rati
fication held to-night at Oak and Wash
ington streets. A large crowd was in at
tendance and a band discoursed music.
The meeting was called to order by
Chairman Charles Willard. He intro
duced Charles Beckman of Sacramento,
formerly Railroad Commissioner, who
addressed the assemblage for a half
hour. The following speakers were then
introduced in order: John Clements, Her
bert Gans, Maurice Connell and J. T.
Matlock. Matlock was the last speaker,
and reviewed the record of each candi
date on the Republican State ticket. The
rally closed with cheers for the Republi
can party.
SAN LUIS OBTSPO, Aug. 27.â There was

Thirty-Fourth District.
A meeting of the Republicans of the
Thirty-fourth Assembly District was held
at the opera hall on Mission street last
night. I. J. Truman presided. A resolu
tion was adopted in which the action of
the County Committee was criticized re
garding the manner adopted by that
body in selecting delegates to the State
convention. The object of introducing
the resolution at this time was not so
much to correct past errors as to caution
the County Committee against a repeti
tion of what the club considered an un
fair mode of selecting delegates.
The club was addressed by A. P. Van
Duzer, Frank Zann, M. V. Taylor, Dor
san Nichols and E. I. Robinson.
The following members were appointed
on the executive committee: Dorsan
Nichols, John J. Aloran, W. E. Bouton,

REFUSES TO
PAY WAR TAXES
The Disputed Impost
Will Be Tested.
CLAIM THAT IT IS UNJUST
ASSERT THAT THEY ARE NOT
UNPATRIOTIC.
Lome Very Plain Statements Calcu
: . lated to Show That the Tax
on Wines Is Decidedly
: One-Sided.
â¢". The Internal Revenue Department has
. been {riven a hard nut to crack in con
â¢ nection with the tax on California wines
â¢in â¢ bottles. There baa been wide com
! plaint from wholesale and retail wine
merchants, bottlemen and proprietors of
restaurants that the tax imposed is dis
:'â¢ criminating and not constitutional. These
. are made on the fact that the
'. â¢ man who produces the wine and the
' : dealer who sells bulk wines escape the
Impost, while the bottler, the merchant
arid caterer who sells wines in glass are
â  required to bear the whole burden. In
border to test the legality of this section
of the war revenue law the Wetmore
â . Bowen Company, which is more largely
affected than any other bottling house in
. the city, have refused to place stamps on
their goods as required by the statute and
are awaiting further action of the Gov
ernment calculated to bring tho dispute
to a final settlement.
In a letter to Collector of Internal Rev
enue Lynch, dated yesterday, the wine
' men set* forth the reasons for their action
as. follows:
â¢ Dear Sir: Be pleased to be advised that we
Lily protest the payments by us of war
;e tax on all wines that we have bottled
the passage of the recent war revenue
tax measure, as well as on all wines that we
may hereafter bottle and otter for sale.
. . It Is our belief that this tax on bottled wines
â  U discriminative, unjust and unconstitutional.
â  We can see no good reason why wine In bottle*
. should be subject to a tax. while Wine In wood
â  rfmali'.s uiuaxed.
We believe it would bÂ« as discriminative and
unjust t.i levy tax on tea in paper packages
â¢ and not In wooden chests, or to tax potatoes
In sack* and not In the bin as It Is to tax
wine In plass and not in wood.
. : You are aware that a uniform tax Is put
-' upon all beer In wood and that It Is taxed at
t:;--> brewery where It is made and that no
â tax is required when this same beer Is put
Into a bottle. You are further aware that
whisky Is taxed in wood at the distillery
â  ' where It is made and not when It Is put Into
â â¢â  bottles. . .
â  â¢ We respectfully suggest therefore that wine
â¢ should be taxed at the winery while It Is In
â  â¢wood and where it is made. It seems to us
that this would be a more tangible way for
the Government to accomplish its object and
It would place an equitable tax upon every
â¢ producer. ... .
We are in favor of this and are willing and
desirous of paying our proportion of the Gov
ernment requirement In response to taxation
on wine. We beg to call your attention to
â â¢ the fact that a demijohn containing five gal
â¢ lons of wine Is taxed, while a keg containing
five gallons of wine goes without taxation;
likewise in some restaurants of this city wine
'â  Is served in glass pitchers and is therefore
' untaxed while other restaurants serve It in
bottles and place the stamp required by enact
. 'ment upon each bottle. i.-^
The taxing of all â¢ wine produced at the
â  winery would avoid evasions that are apparent j
'at the present time. As all the Cresta Blanca i
'â¢ wine we produce Is Bold exclusively In glass !
â¢ we are taxed for every pint we sell, while j
many larger growers and merchants who sell i
â " millions of gallons in wood annually excape j
â¢ without paying one cent of taxation.
' ' You can see, therefore, that this protest Is
not made from an unpatriotic standpoint, but
one based upon equity and upon our lnterpre
â¢â â¢ tatlon of the constitution of the United States.
â¢'We therefore respectfully protest the pay- j
"â  meat by us of any further tax on our bottled
wines.

ANOTHER BIG RAFT,
Six Million Feet of Lumber Being
Towed From Portland to San
Francisco.
Some weeks ago there was towed to San
Francisco from Portland a raft of lumber
containing 3.000.000 feet. When it started
â  it had 4,000.000 feet, but when about half
.way here it encountered a Btorm and
. broke in two, losing a quarter section
' from the middle. The other parts were
â  successfully brought into port.
Not at all discouraged by this mishap,
the shippers of this raft flnman Paulsen

have another and larger one on the way
here, and it is expected to arrive early
. this week. It is 400 feet long, and con

. Ptruoteri on the same plan as the first,
â  with crosp-timbers and numerous verti

OAKLAND AT
SIX TO FIVE
A Close Game Which
Was Full of Interest.
GOOD WORK BY PITCHERS
STOCKTON SUFFERS FROM A
DOSE OF HARD LUCK.
Borchers Might Have Tied the Score
in the Ninth, but He Was
Reckless and Died at
Home Plate.
They did their best to tie the score In |
the ninth, but they failed, and thereby j
hangs a tale of sorrow for Stockton and
a gladsome rejoicing for Oakland. The :
score was 6 to 6, with the Slough City ]
people on the under side. Knell rapped â¢
the sphereold and took first on a single. ;
Then Borchers of ancient fame discovered ;
the angle of Moskiman's curves and did !
not stop running until he adorned the
second bag and Knell scored. Then Smith
wielded the stick for a single and Borch
ers with as much steam as he could com
mand started for home. His run would ;
have tied the score had he made it. He
died an awful death three feet from the
home plate.
The game was of good quality, with
just enough errors not to mar It. Both
pitchers did splendid work, especially
Moskiman, who struck out six men and
gave but two bases on balls. Knell,
with the exception of one inning, twirled
In old-time form. The disastrous Inning
for the Stocktonians was the second, when
the Oakland team scored five runs. The
Stocktons in the beginning of the second
placed three tallies to their credit and
they were happy. But their lightsome
emotions were darkened in a very short
time by the sluggers from across the bay.
At the end of the inning the score stood
5 to 3.
Muller of the Stocktons distinguished
himself by his splendid hitting and field
ing. During the entire game nis playing
was gingery and at all times productive
ofgood results.
The score is as follows:

WOODMEN WENT TO
SAN LORENZO GROVE
THEY HAD A WOOD CHOPPING
AND SAWING TEST.
Members of the Head Camp and La
dies Had a Pleasant Time in
Alameda County.
The head officers and the delegates to
the Head Camp of the Pacific Coaat juris
diction of the Woodmen of the World
were the guests yesterday of the camps
of Alameda County.
A committee of thirty from Oakland,
Peralta, Elm, Cherry, Old Orchard, Cy
press, Spruce, Forest, Athens, Alpha,
Maple and Mount Eden camps, of which
J. K. Jeffries was chairman, and I. I. I
Boak secretary, arranged for them a day
at San Lorenzo Grove. At 8:30 o'clock a
sub-committee, consisting of J. K. Jef
fries and J. L. Greer of Oakland, E. O.
Turner of Berkeley, \V. P. Soulsberg of
Alameda and J. D. Armstrong and A. L.
Palton of Elmhurst, presented themselves
at the headquarters of the delegation, the
California Hotei, where a procession, in
which, in addition to the officers and dele
gates, were delegates from the Grand
Circle of Woodcraft and relatives of the
delegates, was formed, and they marched
to the ferry.
The excursionists were conveyed to
Washington and Seventh streets, where
they boa: (led a special train on the elec
tric line, and after a pleasant ride through
Alameda County were landed at the
grove.
On the way there the train slowed up
as it passed Camp Barrett, the band
played the "Star-spangled Banner" and
all the excursionists rose and sang the
words of the anthem. The soldiers re
turned the compliment by waving their
hats, while the sentries came to a pre
sent.
After lunch in the grove came the fea
ture of the day, which was the wood
chopping and sawing contests. Twelve
Inch logs were taken to an open space, all
present formed a circle, and only two
contestants went to work to make the
chips fly. The first was Olney Spear of
Haywards Camp, who, with steady, well
directed bloww, made Incisions in the lop
until he had cut half way through. He
then turned the log, hewed on the other
side, and in 2:27V^ minutes had finished.
He was followed by a delegate, who is a
Sheriff of the State of Washington, a tall,
muscular individual, the equal in size of
his oppon^U. In the first half of the
work ne made better time than his prede
cessor, but on the second half he lost
time. His record was 3:44V4.
Then came the sawyer*. The first team
âWill Greer of Oakland Camp and W. H.
Robertson of Athens Campâ with a cross
cut saw went through the log in 45&
seconds. They were followed by J. 8.
Patterson of Golden Gate Camp and C
Brown of Western Addition Camp, who
showed they were not in it by taking
1-21% minutes in doing what their prede
cessors had done. The third teamâ W.
H Robertson of Athens Camp and J. J.
Willis of Spokane Campâ carried off the
honors by doing the work In 41 seconds.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 1898.
SHORT ENDERS
WERE HAPPY
Upsets Were Numerous
at Union Park.
QUITE SPEEDY YOUNGSTERS
A HABD STAKE FROM WHICH
TO PICK A WINNER.
With Fine Weather Grand Coursing
Will Be Enjoyed To-Pay at
Both Parks â The Pro
granune.
Two rounds of the largest puppy stake
that has ever been slated for a coursing
meeting were decided yesterday at Union
Coursing Park, and a grander lot of
young dogs than those that contested for
coin and glory would be hard to find In
any part of this gTeat country.
The final rounds will be run to-day prior
to the open stake.
The talent thought that It was a good
bet that Rest Assured would win a flag
from Lyga, but when the dogs were
slipped the judge* of form found their
mistake, although It was a very close
course.
There was a very strong tip out on
Maid of Bail, who is owned by the well
known breeder, Tim Cronin, but the Maid,
although going well along near the finish,
was no match for Curtis & Son's young
dog, Luxor, who, as the talent expressed
It, had too much foot for the lady.
J. F. Halton's well-bred youngster, Tic-
Tac, was one of the very long short-end
ers that caused pockets to burn and la
dies to weep.
Tic-Tax; entered the slips with Jersey
Lily a 3& to 1 favorite, and to a good
hare they started to cross the field. It
was a pretty course, but Tic-Tac did some
fine work near the finish and won the
flag. Tobasco, who sold at $1 as against
$lv on Gold Hill, came very near winning
a smali fortune for a few of the short
enders who had confidence in his ability
to defeat Gold Hill. Had Tobasco made a
good showing from the slips he would cer
tainly have got a color raised in his favor,
as he accomplished some very good work
In the latter part of the course.
The second round was replete with sur
prises. Those who played the short ends
regardless of lon odds wore smiling faces
when the last flag of the day was raised
The dogs that sold on the short end ana
won money for their backers were: Fox
Kenny. Tic-Tac, Gold Hill, O X Capital.
Statesman and Rock Island Boy.
The final course of the day, between
Victor King, an Eastern dog, and Wait
a Little, was declared a no course by the
Judge- but in the second trial Victor won.
Leashmen will watch with keen interest
to-day the performance of. the recently
imported English dog, Kentish Girl. She
is .said to be very fast, but not being ac
climated, it Is not expected that she will
run up to her real form.

COURSING AT INGLESIDE.
Fleet Hounds Give the Bettors an In
teresting Afternoon's Sport.
Shortenders had few oportunities to
swell their bank accounts at Ingleside
yesterday during the run down of the fleet
hounds. The talent had things their own
way most of the time, but occasionally
some favorite would succumb to the
speed of a rank outsider, and then the
former class would crow. This happened
at the outset, when Whitehall beat Our
Boy at 2 to 1. Tullamore proved invin
cible during the afternoon, downing good
dogs every time she was slipped. Despite
the fact that Rosaleen was not acclimated
and that she was cut up In a collision
with a barb-wire fence, the Eastern dog
won handily. Heather Dell was picked to
: lose the first course, but disappointed the
* wiseacres. Long Shot Conley had a hard
' course but should win the stake to-day,
as he is running fast and is a clever dog.
The winners of the ties oT the non-win
ners' stake to-day should be Magenta,
Systematic and L. S. Conley.

FIRE ARRAY OF
FLORAL BEAUTY
Santa Cruz Red Cross
Scores a Success.
DAHLIA SHOW AN ATTRACTION
BEAUTIFUL EXHIBITS FROM
LOCAL GARDENS.
Buds and Blossoms of Countless Hues
and Varieties to Pleaae the
Eye and Further a Good
Cause.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 27.â The ladle*
of the Red Cross Society are scoring
a success with their dahlia and floral
exhibit In the Hotaling building. The
rooms present a wealth of floral bloom
and the gorgeous colored dahlias are
well worth beholding. The windows
are arranged with ferns and flowers
in a moat artistic manner. In them
the immense bunch of varl-colored
dahlias attracts especial attention.
They are all from the garden of Golden
Gate Villa, the summer home of Major
Prank McLaughlin.
Within the building Is one of the
finest exhibits of dahlias ever shown.
The climate of Santa Cruz is excep
tionally favorable for the cultivation
of this flower. The table of Peter
Thrift, who makes a specialty of dahlia
culture, contains more varieties than
that of any other. Dahlias of every
shape and from the most delicate tints
to the most gorgeous hues are on
exhibition and arranged in a very
pleasing manner.
The table presided over by the ladies
of the Red Cross includes all the flow
ers In bloom at this season of the year
and presents a beautiful sight. They
are especially indebted to A. Noble of
Rosedale for a collection of giant
fuchsias, roses and gladiolas. As with
every other table dahlias predominate.
Dr. C. L. Anderson has on exhibit at
this table the blossom of the wild aster,
which was brought from India and
transplanted.
The exhibit of Thomas Thompson is
very striking and includes the rarest
specimens of hothouse plants and ferns.
He especially excels in his exhibit of
carnations. Asters are prominently
displayed, and his finely arranged box
of Thompson seedling dahlias in moss
is beautiful.
From Rutherglen Terrace, the home
of James McNeil, on the Cliff drive, is
a table arranged by Mr. and Mrs.
George Kirby. The principal display is
asters in white, pink, pruple and lav
ender, and a finer exhibit of this flower
has never before been made. The
dahlias are not one whit behind the
rest, while Mr. Kirby is the only one to
make a display of pansies. His table
is of a set design and arranged with
moss and bordered with pink, white
and lavender asters.
Dr. J. P. Parker, a most ardent
lover of flowerÃ, and who is very
successful as well as enthusiastic in
regard to floriculture, has a won
derful exhibit of carnations of count
less varieties, all raised in the open
air. His gloxianas. with their deep
crimson and purple centers, are a cen
ter of attraction.
E. Leedham has the largest display,
occupying three tables, two of which
are of dahlias, including some very
fine cacti dahlias and baskets of dahlias
arranged in designs. His dahlias ar<?
prominently displayed and are of va
rieties and colors without number and
of all shapes and sizeÃ.

DH. PIERCES REMEDIES
A HEARTRENDING SPECTACLE
The Strange, Pathetio Tale Brought to
Light by Our Porto Rioan Campaign.
Its Significance to American Women
One of the saddest, most incredible
revelations of Spanish atrocity in all
this heart-thrilling and desperate war
is the wretched multitude of hopeless
prisoners discovered in the filthy dun-
geons of Cuba and Porto Rico.
".Their case is even more deplorable,"
says the New York Herald, "than that
of the wretched reconcentrados. These
are men and women who have been
kept in Jail for unconscionable terms,
some on trumped up charges, some on
no charges at all. In some instances
faded and worn women who had once
RELEASE OF PORTO RICAN PRIS- I
ONERS.
been beautiful, gaunt and ragged men
who had once been prosperous, could
scarcely realize that prison doors
which seemed forever sealed were at ,
last opened to them."
But if it is a glorious and noble thing /
for this great country, with its mag- Â£
niflcent Illimitable power, to throw
wide open the prison doors and release
the miserable creatures so desperately
ground beneath Spain's iron heel, it is
no less a gTeat and pressing duty of
American manhood to think of the ten
thousand wives and mothers of free
America whose lot is more pathetic and
miserable than that of these wretched
Porto Rlcans.
WOMEN PRISONERS OF FREE
AMERICA.
These women of our own country
with homes to shelter and hearts to
love them, with all the surroundings
which ought to make life a pleasure
and a blessing, are yet weighed down
with an inward physical weakness
which shuts them off from the sun-
shine and happiness of life as com-
pletely and hopelessly as If they were
immured in the darkest confines of a
Spanish dungeon.
Sentenced to years of continual suf-
fering, weariness and distaste of liv-
ing, their sense of melancholy and de-
spair filling even their own cheerful
homes with prison-like gloom, the
daily round of housework grows more
and more irksome and dreadful until it
finally rests upon them like the leaden
routine of a Jail.
A woman whose life is embittered
and poisoned by the weaknesses or
diseases peculiar to her sex cannot but
feel that this penalty which nature has
inflicted upon her is more unreasonable
than the despotism of a Spanish ty-
rant. How startling it seems that a
true woman, capable in heart and soul
of being a loving wife and mother,
should, by sheer physical incapacity,
be deprived of the crowning happiness
of womanhood.
A QUESTION FOR HUSBANDS.
This is something for every husband
in the land to consider, and then deter-
mine if there be not something more
than fine furniture and beautiful sur-
roundings needed, and which he can
furnish to brighten his wife's existence
and to make his home, as it should be.
the ever-living source of comfort and
Joy.
No one can give an ailing, sensitive
woman too much sympathy. The best
of husbands cannot half appreciate
what she suffers. If the doctor is
called in, ten to one he will not diasr-
nose the case correctly. The ordinary
local practitioner has no special knowl-
edge of special diseases. He will prob-
ably prescribe for "Indigestion" or
"liver complaint" or "heart trouble,"
and never once reach the real funda-
mental trouble lurking in the organs
distinctly feminine.
The woman herself may hardly real-
ize where the cause of the whole diffi-
culty lies, and If she does, the thought
of the mortifying questionings, "exam-
inations" and "local applications,"
which modest women dread, will deter
her from speaking frankly. She knows
the doctor does not understand her
case; she feels that his medicines are
giving her no real help; yet she takes
them in the vain hope that so,me way.
somehow, she will be better in a little
while. But no woman ever was or
ever can be well while a hMden ailment
of this nature is daily and hourly sap-
ping away x her very life.
WHAT BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE
SHOULD KNOW.
If every ailing woman could know
what Dr. Pierces wonderful "Favorite
Prescription" has done for countless
thousands of her suffering sisters, fe-
male complaints would become almost
unknown throughout the length and
breadth of this country. This extraor-
dinary "Prescription" Is the outgrowth
of thorough education, deep research
and an almost unparalleled experience.
Its origmator, Dr. R. V. Pierce, of
Buffalo, N. V., has devoted a long life
of earnest effort to the study and treat-
ment of the various diseases peculiar to
women. For thirty years, as chief con-
sulting physician of the famous World's
Dispensary Medical Association of Buf-
falo, he has had a wider practical expe-
rience in this speciaj field of medical
practice than probably any other physi-
cian in America.
He designed this marvelous "Pre-
scription" for the one specific purpose
of healing, strengthening and purifying
the distinctly feminine organism. It Is
for this and nothing else. It heals all
ulceratlve conditions and unnatural
drains: overcomes all weaknesses and
derangements; imparts strength to the
supporting ligaments and tonic power
to the nerve centers.
There never was any other medicine
so scientifically devised for the express
benefit of womankind; there never was
any other which accomplished this pur-

pose so completely and permanently.
It is a temperance medicine, not a
mere stimulant. There is no alcohol In
it, no narcotic drugs. The persistent
use of preparations containing such
agents is liable to awaken a morbid,
intemperate craving. The "Favorite
Prescription" develops no bad habits,
The health it bestows is natural, genu-
ine, vigorous and permanent.
"I was sick for a long time with fe-
male trouble, but paid little attention to
it until last winter," says Mrs. Lydia
Craft of Larwood, Linn County, Ore-
gon, in a letter to Dr. Pierce. "I mis-
carried and this left me in a weakened
condition. I grew very nervous and
despondent. I did not want to see any-
body; everything seemed so strange, as
though I were in a strange land. I had
such a disagreeable feeling in my head;
it was not a headache, but a drawing
feeling, and the top of my head was hot
and painful. I had bearing down pains
and my back hurt me all the time. I
could not do any work at all and could
not sleep. I tried some patent medicine,
but got no relief.
"I went to see the best doctor in Le-
banon. He said I had inflammation erf
the inside lining of the womb. He
treated me for a while and I did not
see much change. I wrote to Dr. Pierce
and in due time received an encour-
aging letter, advising me to take his
'Favorite Prescription' and 'Golden
Medical Discovery." I did so and am
very glad to say it helped me steadily.
I could see that I was gaining. When
I wrote to you I weighed eighty-seven
pounds, now I weigh ninety-nine. I can
eat anything I want to, my appetite is
good I can work all day and not feel
tired at night. I have no more bearing
down pains. My head does not trouble
me any more at all and I feel better
than I have for three years."
"I feel it a duty to inform you that
I had been a sufferer for many years
from nervousness with all its symptoms
and complications," writes Mrs. O. N.
Fisher, IS6I Lexington avenue, New
York, N. V., in an earnest letter to Dr.
Pierce. "I was constantly going to see
a physician or purchasing medicine for
this or that complaint, as my troubles
became unbearable. In the spring of
1597 my husband induced me to try
Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription.
After taking one bottle and following
your advice I was so encouraged that I
took five more bottles of 'Favorite Pre-
scription' and then I did not take any
more for several weeks as I* felt so
much better.
"I am vpt now cross and irritable,
and I have a good color in my face;
have also gained about ten nounds in
weight and one thousand pounds of
comfort, for I am a new woman once
more and your advice and your 'Fa-
vorite Prescription' are the cause of it,
coupled with your 'Pleasant Pellets'
which are not to be dispensed with. I
will not take any more unless you so
advise, for I do not see that I need it.
I have often told my friends how I was
cured, and have been no little sur-
prised to learn how many of them also
used Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription
with great benefit."
For every critical period of woman's
life this superb "Prescription" is the
never-failing stay, support and com-
fort. It fits young women to be happy,
healthy wives and mothers. It gives
prospective mothers physical and men-
tal strength to pass through the ordeal
of motherhood with comparative com-
fort and perfect safety. It insures re-
cuperative energy for young nursing
mothers; and abundant healthy nour-
ishment for their babies.
"When I look at my little boy,", says
Mrs. Axel Kjer of Gordenvflle, Cape
Glrardeau County, Mo., "I feel It my
duty to write to you. Perhaps some
one will see my testimony and be led to
ÃBe your 'Favorite Prescription' and be
blessed In the same way. This is my
fifth child and the only one who came
to maturity, the others having died
from lack of nourishment â so the doc-
tor said. I was not sickly in any way.
and this time I just thought I would
try your 'Prescription.' I took nine bot-
tles, and to my surprise it carried me
through and gave us as fine a little boy
as ever was. He weighed ten and a
half pounds. He is now five months
old, has never been sick a day and is so
stroner that everybody who sees him
wonders at him. He is so playful and
holds himself up so well. I would like
to see this in print for so many have
asked me, 'Do you think those are the
testimonials of the people or has Dr.
Pierce just made them up and printed
them?*
"I do hope that if any women have
the same trouble that I have hart they
will try Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
tion. We recommended it to one of
our neighbors and she tried it and the
result is a fine bis boy. Her two babies
before this one were born dead! after
she had suffered untold misery. She
feels very grateful for the 'Favorite
Prescription." "
A PLAINj DUTY.
Every husband who feels that his
wife's health demands the attention of
an expert scientific specialist, and every
ailing woman who is down-hearted and
discouraged with weakness and inca-
pacity in a womanly way, should feel
absolute confidence in . writing to Dr.
Pierce about these troubles.
He will answer all such letters
promptly and earnestly; and will give
carefully considered, fatherly, profes-
sional advice without charge. He will
prescribe simple and inexpensive self-
treatment whereby any* woman in the
privacy of her own home, may, in al-,
DB. PIEBCE'S BEMEDIES.
most every instance, effect a complete
and permanent cure.
Any reputable dealer can supply you
with Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription.
A dealer who doesn't supply it to you
doesn't want to. Some dealers would
rather sell you a substitute on which
they can make more than the fair profit
which this great standard "Prescrip-
tion" allows them. Your health or
your judgment is of no account to such
a dealer. This kind of substituting is
an insult to your intelligence. Show
him that you know what you want.
Insist on Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription, and you will get it.
THE BIBLE OF THE BODY.
One of the greatest medical books of
the present century is Dr. Pierces thou-
sand-page illustrated Common Sense
Medical Adviser. It has been termed
"The Bible of the Body"â because
what the Bible is to the soul this book
is to the physical man. Two-thirds of
a million copies were sold at $1 50 each.
The profit on this enormous sale in-
duced Dr. Pierce to issue a new edition
In paper covers, which will be sent ab-
solutely free â one copy only to one
family â on receipt of 21 one-cent
stamps, to pay the bare cost of mailing
only, inclosed to World's Dispensary
Medical Association, Buffalo, N. Y. Or
send 31 stamps if a heavier, handsomer,
cloth-bound copy is desired.
In one chapter of this grand book
nearly a hundred pages are devoted to
the consideration of the diseases of
women; with an account of many se-
vere and obstinate cases which by
means of Dr. Pierces scientific, com-
mon sense treatment were promptly re-
lieved and nermanently cured.

A REWARD FOR RASMUSSEN
WHEAT FROM THE SOUND BY A
SAILING VESSEL.
The First Time in Years That Grain
Has Coxae From Seattle to
San Francisco by a
Wind-Jammer.
In the early part of May last the British
ship Crown of India sailed from Newcas
tle, N. S. W., for San Francisco with a
cargo of coal. When 150 miles off shore
â¢ Bhe was caught In what is now known in
Australia as "the gTeat Maitland storm"
and partly dismasted. During that ter
rific hurricane vessels scudded past the
dismasted Crown of India, some of them
under bare poles, some under goose
winged lower topsails, some making
heavy weather of it and some snug, but
the only one that stood by the ship in dis
tress was tho San Francisco schooner
Golden Shore. In spite of the wind and
waves. Captain Rasmussen hove his ves
sel to and remained in the vicinity of the
Crown of India until the storm abated.
He then stood on his way and finally
landed his cargo in Sydney, N. S. W.
When the Golden Shore had discharged
her cargo she went to Newcastle, N. S.
W., and when the Moana left was loading
coal for San Francisco. The Crown of
India was towed into Bydney, and Cap
tain Corkhill lost no time in returning
thanks to Captain Rasmussen. Through
the Mayor of Newcastle he presented
the brave American master with a hand
ponie gold locket and Mrs. Rasmussen
with an elegant diamond. Captain Ras
mussen's present bears the following in
scription: "From Captain Corkhill of the
British ship Crown of India to Captain

WAS FORGED.
and immediately retired. Shortly after
Major McLaughlin came along and no
ticed the name of his friend on the hotel
book. Now. the major possesses a joking
turn of mind and a remarkable aptitude
for imitating any handwriting, and he
then and there wrote "W. W. Foote" not
once but twice on the lines below the
original signature, so that the three were
so much alike you could not tell one from
the other. The major, chuckling at the
thought of what the morrow would bring,
also retired to the sleep of the just.
The next morning Foote made his ap
pearance bright and early at the counter
to pay his bill, and on casually glancing
at the register he was startled at seeing
the three signatures. After satisfying
himself as to the genuineness of each, he
thus communed with himself: "What in
Democracy's name possessed me to sign
three times? I suppose it was the luxury
of that champagne which caused me to
swell to three times my natural size, and
I registered for three of me. When a man
Is not used to drinking the abominable
stuff he Is likely to do strange things.
Now, whisky would never make a man do
that."
Being much perturbed in spirit, Foote
said to the clerk: "My boy, was I In full
possession of my senses last ni^ht when
I applied for a room?" The -lerk replied,
"You were, undoubtedly. Mr. Foote."
"Well," said the worried attorney, sink-
Ing his voice to a stage whisper, "How is
it that I wrote my name three times on
the register?"
"Why," said the clerk, "you only wrote
your name once. Major Mclaughlin came
in just after you did and wrote it twice,
just for a Joke, you know."
"Oh!" said Foote, breathing an intense
sigh of relief, but looking at the signa
tures in a doubtful sort of way, "I must
say that the major is wasting his talents.
Why, just think, If he wore to direct them
Into other channels he might become the

The Murderer Coolly Walked Into
the Central Police Station
and Told of His
Crime.
Shortly before 9 o'clock last night a
ynung man stepped into the Central Po
lice station and drawing a revolver from
his hip pocket placed it on the counter,
paying:
â¢I. have shot my stepfather, and want
to give myself up."
â  Corporal Sills, to whom he surrendered,
sr.w the man in the act of drawing his
pistol, and thinking he meant to attack
.him, prepared to defend himself. The
man laid his pistol, together with five
â 5 cartridges he held in his hand,
.pn the. counter and was placed under ar
rest. He gave his name as Cornelius
Joseph Sullivan, and that of his victim
â as John Charles Pratt.
.. Shortly after he arrived the officers of
rhe Central station were notified of
the tragedy. It proved to be a premedi
tated murder, with money as the moving
cause.
Decedent, -who waa a man of nearly 80
. went to his home, 633 Minna street,
jreaterday afternoon about 4 o'clock in
an intoxicated condition. Ha set about
for a time, wailing and crying, and at
half-past 6 was put to bed by James
Mills, a roomer in his house. About 8
o'clock "Conny," as the stepson was fa
..rly called, visited the house.
By this time Sullivan was about the
house In his shirtsleeves and wearing his
I.at. They talked for nearly half an hour,
tlw old man offering his visitor a drink
from a flask of whisky, which was re
fused.
They renewed a quarrel which had been
going- on for several days. In the height
if the quarrel the aged man started to
walk from the kitchen Into his bedroom,
:.ing. Hardly had he crossed the
â¢ threshold when "Conny" jumped up and
â At a word of warning hred at his
:ht-r. The bullet took effect, and

The young man emptied his revolver
. into his victim, the rtlnaining shots being
. at such short range as to set his doming
papers on the floor on fire. Sul

leaving it open behind him. and proceeded

When taken to the prison he seemed
slightly under the influence of liquor.
However, when questioned he etemed
proud of his work, saying:
Ij He tried to get me and I gave him all
I had. I laid him out on the floor."
He was locked up temporarily. When

One look she took at the man on the
floor and then rushed to the home of
Jeremiah Sullivan, 619^ Minna street.
He is a cousin of the murderer's father.
They went back to the house of death,
which they found filled with smoke.
With the assistance of Officer Hams
and Frank Murphy, driver of the patrol
wagon, they extinguished the flames
which the explosion of the cartridges,
held close to the man's clothing, had
started, by using water from the tea
kettle.
Tho money over which the men quar
reled was left by Mrs. Pratt. She was
married to the man who was murdered
last night thirteen years ago. She died
on the IGth inst. On me day before her
death Pratt deposited to his own credit
in the Hlbernia Bank $2147 08. On August
22 he drow $300 with which to Day the
funeral expenses. He has had $S0 on de
pocdi in his own name in the Hibernia
Bank since May 15, 1884.
He was preparing to go East shortly.
He had sold the furniture in the house
and had sent his personal belongings to
the house of a Mrs. Lee, who ha/T been a
friend of the family for years. Decedent
was a well-known character about the
city. He was a collector of bad debts and
also peddled lottery tickets.
The Coroner's deputies are much In
censed at the failure of the police to
notify them of the deed until an hour
after the police officer sent to investi
gate had reported tho man as dead. They
would not have found it out then had
it not been for parties inquiring for in
formation at the Coroner's office. Sulli-
van surrendered himself at about 9:15 and
an officer was sent out at once to Investi
gate.
At 10:15 o'clock a reporter strolled into
the Coroner's office and asked Deputy
Hallet if he was "back with that body
already." Hallet had heard nothing of tho
case up to this time, and telephoned to
officials at the City Hall for information.
He was then told that the man was dead
and had been dead for about two hours.
The police offered no excuse for failing to
give the customary notice.
He then told fci a disj way of the
trouble he had had w M his stepfather
over money left by his mother.
"My mother died last week." he said,
"and before she died she left all her
nwney to my stepfather. There waa
some mystery about her death and he

money. â .
"I had a quarrel with my stepfather
yesterday and this afternoon I bought a

and he denied having any. We were sit
ting in the kitchen at the time and he
got up and ran into his room. I sup- !
pose he picked me out for a good thing.
j thought this Is enough and gave it to
him. I then walked up here and sur

Sullivan did not appear to realize for
an instant the position in which he was
placed.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 1898.
THE EIGHTH
CALIFORNIA
ON PARADE
Remarkably Fine Drill
Yesterday.
WITNESSED BY THOUSANDS
A REGIMENT OF WHICH THE
STATE MAY BE PROUD.
The Men Drilled With the Precision
of Old-Time Regulars, and
Were Reviewed by Gen
eral Miller.
The drill of the Eighth California Regi
ment on the parade ground, at Sixteenth
and Folsom streets, yesterday afternoon
was witnessed by a crowd of over 4000
people, among whom were many promi
nent citizens. Occupying seats on the re
viewing stand were Brigadier General
Miller and staff, Judge Advocate Bor
rough. Lieutenant Colonel Shriver and
Major Goodall, both of the Twenty-third
Infantry; Colonel Berry, Major Welch and
Lieutenants Hammond and Fexnald, all
of the Seventh California; Adjutant Gen
eral Barrett; Colonel R. L. Peeler, assist
ant adjutant general; Colonel J. F. Bur
gin, inspector of rifle practice; Lieutenant
Colonels Young, Pippy, Andrews, Vail,
Beck, Howell and Dnolittle, aides-de
camp, and Colonel Chadbourne, all of
Governor Budd's staff; and Rev. C. E.
Locke.
Preceding the drill a concert was given
by the bands of the Eighth California,
Twentieth Kansas and First Tennessee
regiments. The opening drill was the
School of the Battalion, in close order, by
Companies A, D, E and M, composing the
P'irst Battalion, in command of Lieutenant
Tnlum-l Carrington, with Lieutenant Bean
as adjutant, which was executed with
great precision. The Second Battalion,
consisting of Companies B, C, G and I, in
command of Major Whitton, with Lieu
teriant Munn as adjutant, gave a physical
exercise with arms, which elicited merited
and enthusiastic applause. This drill was
a most interesting feature of the pro
gramme. The street riot drill, by the
Third Battalion, composed of Companies
E, H, X and L, commanded by Major
Forbes, with Lieutenant Denson as adju
tant, was admirably performed, especially
the forming of the hollow square. The
extended order drill, by Company G, under
Captain Stmp.son and Lieutenants Weth
ern and Munn, was the most novel and
exciting event of the afternoon. The firing
of blank cartridges was unexpected by the
crowd, which was considerably startled at
the first discharge. Then came guard
mounting. Lieutenant Smith being adju
tant; Captain Baldwin, new officer of the
day; Captain Rlley. old officer of the day;
Lieutenant Adel, officer of the guard; and
Lieutenant Denson, supernumerary. Next
in order wai the regimental parade in line
of masses. Colonel Henshaw commanding,
and Lieutenant 1). A. Smith acting as ad
iutant. Tlii> programme closed with the
review of the regiment by General Miller.
It was the general verdict that the
Eighth California is a credit to the State.
It is composed of a magnificent lot of
men, both a.s to physique and character,

and considering that they have been in
service only about sixty days they have
attained a wonderful degree of perfection
in tactics and the manual of arms.
At the close of the drill a collation was
served to the regiment by the Mothers'
Club of the Army and Navy Christian
Commission, the president of the club,
Mrs. C. S. Wright, superintending the
affair.
EVENTS AT THE PRESIDIO.
The Unpleasantness Between
Colonels Funston and Little
Has Been Exaggerated.
Inl the controversy between Colone
Funston and Lieutenant Colonel Little of
the Twentieth Kansas Regiment the
facts have been greatly exaggerated.
Lieutenant Colonel Little stated yester
day that he had expressed his opinion as
to the fitness of certain officers in the
regiment who were in the line of promo
tion, and that he did no more than he
believed that he had a right to do, but
that Colonel Funston had disapproved of
what he had done, and that was the end
of the matter. Lieutenant Colonel Little
was not ordered to his quarters by Col
onel Funston, nor was he put under ar
rest.
First Lieutenant James B. Nolan,
Fourth Cavalry, who went to the Yo
semite Valley with the First Utah Cav
alry, has returned to the Presidio.
First Lieutenant F. W. Harris, adju
tant of the Fourth Cavalry, left last
night on a week's furlough for Portland,
Or! Lieutenant O'Shea will act as adju
tant while he is aosent. ji'

There were no deaths at the hospital yes

he left Friday evening he shut it up as
usual and placed the glasses and revolver
in his desk. Entrance to the tent was

Private Fred Shaufele, Company A,
Twentieth Kansas, is in the regimental
hospital suffering from what Is appar
ently an attack of temporary Insanity.
Friday afternoon some of the soldiers of
his company noticed that he was acting
queerly. He was seen to go Into his tent
and load his rifle and then attempt to fire
It into his body by pressing the trigger
with his toe. The gun was taken from
him and he was carried struggling to the
hospital, where he tried to beat out his
brains with his fists. Shaufele was better
yesterday, although he Is still under a
guard. He declares that ftte is subject to
brain attacks, and when these are upon
him he is not aware of what he is doing.
He will no doubt be brought before an
examining board and discharged from the
service for physical disability. â¢

STRUCK A WAITER.
C. J. Johnson Arrested for Assault-
ing a Japanese Boy.
C. W. Johnson, a wholesale butcher,
surrendered himself at the Southern Po
lice Station last night in answer to a
John Doe warrant, charging him with
battery on S. Sumli, a Japanese boy, em
ployed as a waiter in a Market street
saloon.
Johnson visited the saloon last Wednes
day night in company with a party of
friends, two of whom were women. They
had some trouble with the waiter and
left the saloon. About half an hour
later they returned and made the claim
that Johnson had only received 40 cents
change for a $10 gold piece which he had
fiven in payment for a 60-cent round of
rinks. The boy denied the charge, saying
that he had been given two 60-cent pieces.
A wrangle ensued, in which the boy was
slapped and cuffed until the bartender In
terfered and the party withdrew to a
back room and rang for a waiter. The
boy answered the call and when he en
tered the room Johnson struck him.
knocking him Into the hall, where he lay
unconscious for an hour.
The proprietor of the saloon is of the
opinion that one of the women robbed
Johnson.
Killed by Savage Storks.
Complaint was made to the officers of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals that extreme cruelty had been
practiced In Golden Gate Park by the
manager of the Japanese tea gardens. It
seems that the old house cat had become
the mother of a healthy lot of kittnes,
which, upon becoming half-grown, proved
to be a nuisance to the manager. Dur
ing the visit of a couple of ladles who
wanted to have a sip of tea after a walk
the Jap, much to their horror, threw the
kittens Into the enclosure where the big
storks are kept. The savage birds with
their long, sharp bills, at once attacked
the helpless kittens, and after repeated
Jabbing killed them and then proceeded
to devour their victims. The sight so
shocked tho ladles that they fled without
finishing their tea and complained to the
officers of the society. To the latter the
wife of the manager made no denial that
her husband had thrown the little ani
mals to the storks, but she said that they
had been stunned before being thrown
into the inclosure. As the ladles who wit
nessed the cruelty could not be Induced
to appear In the police court the case had
to be dropped.
The Bismarck Celebration.
A meetiriK of the literary committee
having charge of the exercises of the
Bismarck memorial celebration was held
yesterday afternoon in the rooms of the
beutscher Verein. Professor Julius Goc
bel was unanimously selected to deliver
the oration In German, and Professor
Bernard Moses for the English oration.
WITTMAN NOW
LEVIES TRIBUTE
FOR SWORDS
Patrolmen Under Him
Again Assessed.
HE WILL RIVAL CHIEF LEES
MAJORITY OF THE MEN ARE
AFRAID TO OBJECT.
They Are Ail Expected to Pay Fifty
Cents Toward a Voluntary Con
tribution Fund Next
Month.
Police Captain Wlttman, ho of the
clammy hand and cold feet, and the ser
geants under him will on the next dress
parade cut a wide swathe and rival the
venerable Chief Lees and his graudy uni
form. Wlttman Is going to have a sword
of finest finish; the sergeants will also
have sword 6. but not of so fine make. It
Is needless to say that the swords will
not be paid for by Wittman or the ser
geants. They will come in the shape of
a "voluntary contribution" from the men
under them. "Voluntary contribution"
In this instance is a term used in police
circles instead of "arbitrary assessment."
Each and every patrolman will on the
llrst of next month step up to the "Cap
tain's office" and "contribute" 60 cents
out of his hard earned wages toward
the sword fund. None of the men will
refuse to "contribute." A failure to do
so would mean a call to "walk the car
pet" in the Police Commisslo.ners* office
on the slightest provocation. A police
captain and a police sergeant are to be
feared by the unfortunate patrolman who
does not "contribute" when he la asked
to do so.
Just who originated the sword presenta
tion idea is not known, but there is a
lurking suspicion in the minda of the pa
trolmen that it emanated from the fer
tile mind of Captain Wittman. Lieuten
ant Birdsall and Sergeant Nash are tht
men who were delegated to levy the "vol
untary" contribution.
When the officers under Birdsall report
ed for duty Thursday evening he in
formed them that a "contribution" of 50
cents from each of them when they drew
their next salary would be applied to a
fund to purchase swords for Captain
Wlttman and the sergeants.
"Of course you are not compelled to pay
anything into the fund unless you desire
to 'do so," said Birdsall in a suave tone.
"Understand, it Is not compulsory," he
continued, "and If any officer does not feel
like contributing- let him say so now. You
must understand that the swords will be
the property of the department, and when
any of you are raised to the rank of ser
geant, a sword will be awaiting you. All
In favor of the contribution will say aye,"
he concluded.
A death-like stillness fell over the as
sembly hall. Then there were a few chir
rups of yes.
Birdsall looked pained and surprised.
He was unable to realize for a moment
that any patrolman would object to pay-
Ing the "voluntary contribution."
"All opposed," said he, when he had In
a measure regained his composure.
There wÂ«s a chorus of noes that
went rumbling through the corridors of
the new City Hall.
Patrolman Jack Ralnsberry, who for the
last ton years has been living in hopes of
becoming a sergeant, came to the rescue.
"I demand a division," said he.
"The proposition has been lost," Â»ald
Birdsall.
"But I Insist on a division," replied
Ralnsberry.
"A division has been called for by Offi
cer Ralnsberry," said Birdsall, "and un
der parliamentary rules It must be
granted. All opposed to contributing will
please raise their hands."
i Only three of the men had the auda
city to raise their hands In objection.
They will in futune have to walk a very
straight line or their stars will be lost to
them.
The men were then sent out on their
beats and the "voluntary contribution"
fund will be started next Thursday.
"If I was a sergeant," grumbled one of
the men as he left the assembly room. "I
would pay for my own sword. Luckily
for him, he was not discovered. If he
was known he would now be patrolling
one of the fog enveloped districts out
near the ocean beach.
Sergeant Nash had his turn as a promo
ter of the "voluntary contribution fund
at the North End station. The proposi
tion went through there like a slate tick
et at a Democratic primary. Only one
officer objected, and It is probable that
within the next few weeks he will find
himself walking a beat in the Potrero.
The others were afraid to raise their
voices in protest against the assessment.
"At one time," said one of the oldest of
cera on the force last night, "a patrolman
received his entire salary at the end of
the month. Those days are gone, how
ever." he added, with a sigh. "If it isn't
a case of buying a new helmet, it is a case
of getting a new revolver. If the helmet
and revolvers are all rignt, the great
grand aunt of some sergeant dies, and
there Is an assessment for a floral piece.
It is now a matttr of an assessment every
month. Why. we have just paid an as
sessment to buy drums for a drum corps
to hammer out martial music for Chief
Lees when he is out on review. I suppose
that we will next be called upon to volun
tarily contribute toward a fund for pur
chasing groceries and supplies for our su
perior officers."

CLAIRVOYANTS.
KNOW THY FATE I
TOUR DESTINT
FORBTOLDI
BY THE GREATEBT
CLAIRVOYANT ON EARTH,
MRS. DR. F. CLARK.
Every person la especially adapted to some
particular business, profession or trade, which
may Justly be termed hia true vocation, and
yet more than half of you are fighting agalnat
an unknown fate for fame, fortune and posi-
tion, which you do not and cannot obtain un-
til you find your true vocation.
STRANGE SENSATIONS
EXPERIENCED WHILE PASSING INTO A
DEEP TRANCE.
As I have been asked so often in regard to
the sensation* experienced by me while passing
from a normal state into a deep trance, and
as an explanation to eaoh inquiring visitor, I
submit the following, and. thereby give the en-
tire publlo the benefit of this knowledges
In the first place It la n*oeÂ«sary for the vis-
itor for whom I am sitting to maintain a strict
silence. â A few passages of my - hand across
my forehead places me In a dazed condition,
such as one experiences when very drowsy and
finds it very difficult to keep awake, or while
gas or chloroform Is administered. At this stage
I become motionless for a moment, which la
called a
SEMI-TRANCE,
And while In this state I only get lmprÂ«*siona
such as you would experience ' while only doa-
lng, and have those restless, fitful dreams.
While* in a semi-trance I only see thing! in-
distinctly, and can tell nothing with any re-
liabilityâ and I will mention here that most
mediums who style themselves clairvoyant* are
only capable of getting Into a semi-trance, and
have not the power to go Into a deep trance,
and as such a medium's readings and predic-
tions prove unsatisfactory the public loses faith
In all. But there Is as much difference In the
predictions of the deep or , perfect trance me-
dium and the semi-trance a* there Is In reading
an open. book In daylight and trying to guess
its contents in darkness. While I am passing
from the semi-trance to the
DEEP TRANCE
A cold chill passes over me; a dull pain seems
to go through my temples; a feeling as if suf-
focating, and the object* which were dimly
seen while In the seml-tranoe disappear, and
I am then sensible to nothing save the most
profound darkness an! a dull, faint, ringing
sound. This state lasts only a few seconds,
then gradually I feel the most delicious sensa-
tion ever experienced by mortal. Faint flashes
of light then begin, and continue to' increase
in number, magnitude and brilliancy until a
most beautiful halo of all colors seems to cover
the entire face of the earth. Gradually ; this
halo gives place to pure daylight. My control
takes full possession of me and unfolds every
event in the past, present and future life of
the person for whom I am sitting. Sometimes
I can remember what I have seen in a trance,'
but very seldom. The difference In the â¢ semi-
trance and the deep-trance medium is ' very
great. There are more than 1000 of these semi-
trance mediums In the United States, nearly
all of whom are only capable of j going . into a
semi-trance. Bine* arriving here I have learned
that, there has been a number, of . people who
call themselves trance clairvoyants and â  me-
diums, but all of whom . are . known : to . me -to
be only semi-trance , mediums ' and could . not
foretell an event with any degree of accurate-
ness If their lives depended upon it. , The semi-
trance Is very easy ,to get , Into and can* be
taught In a very short time, but the deep
trance is only attained after much pain and an
almost superhuman exertion of will power,: and
can only be reached by those who are born
with a veil and cannot be taught. There are
only three other deep-trance mediums now liv-
ing besides myself, all of whom are in Europe.

CLAIRVOYANTSâ Continned-
ATTENTIONtU
Know Thy Fate.
YOUR DESTINY FORETOLD
By
The World's Greatest
CLAIRVOYANT
And Exponent of
The Occult Sciences.
PROF. H. ROMAINE,
The Oriental Seer,
LATE OF INDIA.
All His Patrons Are Delighted
And Pronounce His Work-
UNAPPROACHABLE.
The fact that Prof. Romalne has been promi-
nently before the public for fourteen consecu-
tive years, and stands to-day without a stain
or blemish upon his reputation. Is the best evi-
dence that could be offered in proof of pure mo-
tives and honest methods In business dealings.
â¢THEY THAT BTAND HIGH
HAVTB MANY BLASTS TO SHAKE THEM."
Prof. Romalne has stood the storm of Inves-
tigation, inspired and prosecuted to the end by
the leading scientists of the present age; has
calmly and patiently borne the treacherou*
blasts of envy and Jealousy, and is firmly and
irresistibly Intrenched in thÂ» hearts of his fel-
low-cltlzens. This honor, this knowledge, he
prizes more than gold.
THE GREATEST TRUTHS ARE THE
SIMPLEST; SO ARE THE GREATEST MEN.
Those who call upon this noted clairvoyant
are received always without ostentation and
with no attempt to mystify. No dark rooms,
no burning candles, no useless incense. Such
humbuggery and charlatanism he despises, and
is most emphatic and severe In his denunciation
of those who seek to Impose upon the puMlc by
such means.
It is a matter of history from the remotest
ages to the present time that the higher sources
of knowledge and rplrltua! guidance have shaped
the destinies of the greatest individuals and
nations. There are few who possess occult
power sufficiently to enable them to give a tot-
rect forecast of the futurr. To Prof. Romalne
nature has been most kind, bequeathing to h:m
that rare gift which enables him to read the
lives of men as clearly as an open scroll, point-
ing out the many faults and difficulties which
have kept them from success, which. In many
cases, can be remedied through their own ef-
forts.
Fully recognizing the power conferred upon |
him, his aim has been to reflne. develop and
uplift it to that degree of scientific accuracy j
that its benefits may devolve to the advance-
ment of humanity.
His claims to recognition are based upon over-
whelming evidence. He does not make them in
the spirit of a braggart, but In all due modesty
is fully confident of his ability to verify the
truth of his assertions.
So extraordinary are his marvelous tests of
the wonders and powers of clalrvoyancy that
they must be witnessed to be believed.
He tells the full name of every caller.
Tells pames of your friends.
Tells you what you called for.
Tells all about your business affair*.
All about your love affairs.
Causes speedy marriages.
Reunites the separated In seven day*.
Locates buried treasure in 5 day*.
Locates mines and valuable ores.
Recovers old estates and valuable papers.
Removes evil Influences, bad habits, etc.
Gives good luck in all your undertakings.
Guarantees Success.
In any at the Above Work
Or Money Refunded.
Being a Master, He Never Fails.
His parlors are always filled with anxious
people talking reliable information, and every
reply is most gratifying: all are pleased. His
knowledge of human nature comes to him In-
tuitively and from world-wide experiences. This
far-seeing and clear-sighted man is the only
American authority on Oriental mysticism, and
possesses occult force beyond the power of lan-
guage to express.
He understands the methods of generating and
increasing the magnetic or psychological powers
within the human body, as practiced by the
Mahatmas of India. This power Is the one great
element In nature upon which every one's suc-
cess depends. The principle of lifeâ the foun-
tain-head of all existence â all possess It to a
certain degree; and It is interesting to note
that the most successful people are those who
possess the greatest amount of this force. One
of its many principles consists in mind attract-
ing mind by its own volition, aided by the mag-
netism of the systPm. Any one possessing this
psychological power can cause others to receive
any impressions of esteem, love. awe. confi-
dence or respect. They can do more in busi-
ness transactions, sales, deals, speculations,
gaining friends and obtaining favors than the
combine* efforts of a dozen persons who use
only argument and obliging manners.
Professor Romaine's readings are always cor-
rect and satisfactory- So sure Is he of his
power to accomplish all that he undertakes that
he oftentimes awaits results before asking com-
pensation for his services. He holds flattering
testimonials from prominent residents of this
cltv and Indorsements from eminent people and
the press from all parts of the world, which are
proof positive of his ability and sincerity of
If you are unsuccessful, or wish to better
your condition in life, he can help you.

FATHER -YORKE
IN DEFENSE OF
THE SISTERS
Denounces Traducers

COWARDS INSULT WOMEN
WARNED AGAINST CLAIM OF
MARGARET SHEPHERD. â¢
The Catholic Champion Scores the
"Escaped Nun" and Extols the
True Daughters of the
Church.
To the Fair-minded People of the City
of San Francisco: It is with the deepest
feelings of shame and indignation that I
am compelled by duty to ftail your atten
tion to the Insult offered the Catholic
people, of this city by this morning's
Chronicle and Examiner. I am ashamed
that American men could have fallen so
low as to further a campaign of calumny
against American women. The managers
of the Chronicle and the Examiner knew
what manner of creature Slargaret Shep
herd was. You know what manner of
women the sisters of the Catholic church
are. The managers of the Chronicle and
Examiner have garbed a common wanton
from England in the sacred robe of a Sis
ter of Charity. From their columns thla
morning her leering face looked out to in
sult us with charges than which nothing
more deadly could be devised against the
honor of men and the virtue of women.
While the managers of these papers have
been pocketing the price of Shepherd's
shame, while the unfortunate creature
herself is pouring out her slanders to her
dupes, thirty sisters of the Catholic
church in the pestilential environs of
Santiago are smoothing the pillows and
bathing the brows of American soldiers
whom the yellow fever has laid low. It is
a shame, an indelible disgrace that
American men and American papers
should Join with a shameless vagrant to
asperse the name of these absent hero
ines and to cast mud upon a garb that is
one of humanity's most glorious boasts.
But indignation is even stronger than
shame. We have in this country lib
erty of speech; but liberty Is not li
cense. No man would dare to proclaim
publicly in this town that Protestant wo
men were all Immoral. Should any man
do so the daily papers would flay him
alive. Many a time and oft the arm of
husband or brother has written liar on
the cowardly hi'le of less guilty sland
erers and the world has applauded their
act. Hut it would seem that in the
eyes of the managers of the Chronicle
and Examiner Catholic women are a
class apart. A convicted swindler can
accuse them of every crime under tV ie
sun and the columns of the Chronicle
and Examiner are at her service. If
Catholic fathers, sons, brothers, hus
bands resent these slanders against
those who are nearest and dearest to
them, they are accused of stifling free
speech. Liberal minded men will never
consent that there should be one meas
ure for us and another for those who
defame us. Our nature is not different
from the nature of our fellow citizens
of other creeds. We have the same
parts, the same passions, the same affec
tions. Love Is as strong in our souls,
Injustice as bitter. Are we, then, to
grand by with folded arms while the
Chronicle and the Examiner wound us
in our holiest, tenderest feelings?' Fel
low citizens, we should be worthy of
every evil thing that might be said of us
were we to leave such an insult unre.
bilked.
Ye know who and what we are. We
are not wandering strangers, staggering
drunken from Jail to Jail. Our homes are
here, our lives are known to you; we are
part and parcel of this commonwealth;
we do not shirk our burdens; we do our
full duty to the State.
Against us comes this woman leaning
on the arms of the managers of the
Chronicle and the Examiner; and who is
she?
By her own confession tind by the let
ters of such personages as W. T. Stead
of the Review of Reviews and Florence
E. Booth of the Salvation Army we know
the following facts:
1. The woman who now calls herself
Margaret L. Shepherd has passed under
the names of Miss Douglas, Georginia
Parkyn. Mrs. Westly, Miss Probyn,
Louisa Egerton. Margaret Herbert, Mrs.
Riordan. Isabella Marron, Adelaide, and
Miss Truetitt.
2. She represents herself variously as
the daughter of a British officer in India,
of a soldier, of Lord Archibald Douglas,
of Solicitor Truefitt and of others.
H. She is a bigamist and has two, prob
ably three, husbands living.
4. Sho was never a sister or nun.
5. She is a notorious liar.
6. She has been a common wanton, a
swindler, a forger, a confirmed drunkard,
and has been several times convicted of
various crimes and sentenced to terms of
imprisonment.
7. She has been confined in Hoxten
Lunatic Asylum. England.
S. She was an inmate of the House of
the Good Shepherd, Arno's Vale. Bristol,
where she was placed for reformation.
9. Afterward she was taken by the Sal
vation Army in England while leading a
life of shame and the Army found her ut
terly incorrigible and disreputable and
had to cast her off.
10. In nearly every place she has been
she has left unpaid debts for accounts
run and money borrowed.
11. She is In the cause of slandering
Catholics for money.
12. Even the Apaists In the East and in
Canada were compelled to cast her off.
This is the character of the woman
whom the Chronicle and Examiner have
set before the people of San Francisco in
the garb of a sister of chaÂ»ity. The evi
dence which sustains these accusations
was in the hands of the editors of those
papers several days ago. Therefore they
cannot plead ignorance. They knew what
they were doing and they believed that
the time had come to forget the lessons
of the past few years and revive the war
upon Catholic men.
I may in conclusion ask our non-Cath
olic fellow-citizens one question. There
are many converts from Protestantism to
Catholicism. Did you ever hear of a con
verted Protestant lecturing about the
iniquity of Protestant churches or about
the immorality of Protestant women? A
true convert is not so minded, and were
I a hypocrite to undertake such a campaign
Catholics would be the first to protest
against such a desecration of the Catholic
i name.
To all liberal-minded men and women
let me offer this word of advice. The
Shepherd woman is here with a manager
â¢ and their sole object is to make money.
! Keep away from her hall, keep away
1 from the approaches thereto, let there be
I no word or sign to give her the chance to
raise the cry that she is persecuted. Thoy
that love dirt, obscene Dirds, may glut
themselves at her meetings. No others
would be seen entering her doors. Where
the carrion is there shall the kites be
gathered together.
And If any one should not know what
! Catholic women are. let them go to the
: soldiers who are waiting their country's
! call at Camp Merritt, "Camp Miller or
Camp Barrett. Let him inquire there what
these Catholic ladies are doing day in
and day out for the boys in blue without
fee and without reward. While a mer
cenary adventuress is using the Chronicle
and the Examiner to slander them for
i hire they are like the master they worship
I quietly and unostentatiously doing good.
Oh. it"is a cruel thing that men should be
found to offer even the shadow of an in
sult to these angels of God on earth.
Yours truly. PETER C. YORKE.

FREIGHT RATE
ON GRAIN BAGS
WILL BE BEDUCED TO POUSTTG
xN COLORADO.
The Beduction Made to Meet the
Schedule Put Into Effect by
Initial Lines at New
Orleans.
â 
General Freight Agent A. D. Shepard j
has announced that the Southern Pacific 1
Company will reduce the freight rate on j
grain bags from San Francisco to Den- j
vor. The present rate is 52 2-10 cents per !
100 pounds, and the new rate will be |
42Vi cents. This fate will be the same I
as that now in effect from New Orleans
to Denver. The rate formerly from here j
to Denver was S5 cents, and from New !
Orleans to Denver 52 2-10 cents. When I
the Southern Pacific Company announced
their intention some time ago that they
would reduce their rate to meet the
62 2-10 rate of the initial lines at New
Orleans, the latter threatened to make
a further cut to 42^ cents, and both re-
ductions were consummated. Now the
Southern Pacific will put in effect the
42' i cent rate to Denver as soon as the
legal details of notification to the Inter
state Commerce Commissioners can be
complied with.
'â The California grain bag Industry,"
said Mr. Sbepard, "has been laboring un
der a disadvantage for a long while. We
now intend to rectify the matter, if pos
sible. Empty grain sacks returned
from Liverpool have been imported via
New Orleans and shipped to Denver at
42% cents, while the grain sacks made in
California and those imported from In
dia paid the 52 2-10 cent rate to Den
ver. When we made the latter rate to
meet that of the New Orleans roads the
latter protested and cut the rate to 42V4
cents, which we will now also put into
effect. Whether the other roads will
make a further reduction I am unable to
say. The distances from here to Denver
and from New Orleans to Denver are
practically the same, and I have all along
maintained that where the distances and
the commodities are equal there should
be equality of rates. The port of New Or
leans serving Colorado is no more enti
tled to all the business than is San Fran
cisco, and we shall insist on a parity of
rates."
BAILBOAD REPORTS.
They Are Being Filed Slowly With
the Commissioners.
The railroads of this State are some
what tardy In filing/ their reports with
the Commissioners, although Mr. Hlnton
has made a personal appeal to all of
them to turn in their statements as
quickly as possible so as to conform to
the law. It is expected that the larger
and more Important lines will have their
reports ready by next week.
The last report filed was that of the
Pajaro Valley Railroad Company, the
directors of which are Claus Spreckels,
John D. Spreckels, John L. Koster. Sam
uel Susman and W. C. Waters. The to
tal cost of construction and equipment
up to June 30. 189 S. has b.en $395.719 60 or
at the rate of $16,823 61 per mile. The
gross earnings for the fiscal year end
ing on that date were $87,600 09, of
which $1493 25 were passenger and $86,
108 84 freight earnings. The total operat
ing expenses amounted to $39,105 01, thus
leaving a net income of $48,496 08.
The Visalia and Tulare Railroad show
gross earnings of $R573 91. and operating
expenses of $5734 99, leaving a net income
of $2838 92 for the year.
Acquitted of Murder.
The charge of murder "William
Harrison, a painter, was dismissed by
Judge Conlan yesterday on the ground
that the death of James Burns, whom
Harrison was accused of killing, was ac
cidental. The two men were friends, and
attended a dance in a hall on Masonic
aveune and Geary street Saturday night,
August 20. While in the dressing room
Burns pulled a revolver out of his pocket
and during a friendly scuffle for posses
sion of the weapon it exploded and Burns
was fatally wounded.

FIGHT FOR A
BIG ESTATE
Crave Charge Against
the Executors.
A LEGAL WILL DESTROYED
TESTATOR IS SAID TO HAVE
BEEN IMPRISONED.
Decedent Was Paralyzed and too
Weak to Have Executed the
Will of Recent
Date.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 27.
John Schneider and George Metzger,
.contestants to the probate of Cbrlatoph
Streitberger's will, made last April, and
petitioners for the probate of the will of
April 3, 1594, to-uay through their attor
neys, J. EL Smith and George do Golia,
filed amended objections to the probate of
Ihe first-named will. They also filed a
copy of the alleged will of "1)4, in which
Andrew Krueckel and William Cron Jr.
â were subscribing witnesses and Schneider
and Metzger named as executors.
By the provisions ol the will of '94 the
last-named were bequeathed a reasonable
commission for their time and labor ex
pended in settling up said estate, which
consisted of money in various banks to
the credit of deceased of about $185,000
and real estate of about $20,000.
. tr thai this will was in
Their possession for several years and
[uently delivered tc Streitberger,
who by reason of the confidence reposed
in D. Bruns and Thomas F. Graber, and
about April 13, 1888, confided the
:r- of s:tld will to Rruns and Graber,
â  her with other papers; that since
i hey have been informed that the
as been destroyed and, if so, that
â  was .destroyed at the Instigation aiid
the influence and direction of saUi
9 and Graber."
They contend that the will datetl April
-. was not the last will and testi
because it was not signed by Strelt
â  or any person in his presence, for
that at such time testator wss
md mind end was incompetent
mike, execute and publish any will.
-tarts further allege that" on April
v Streitberger was 60 years of age,
ihout one year prior thereto he had
paralyzed, from which he never re
â¢>l, and that he labored under
tge hallucinations, believing that un
known persons were desirous of killing
that during said year deceased re
sided at the home of D. i.runs where he
was induced to remain, owing to his en
d condition; that despite deceased
was a member of theGernmn Hospital As-
Uon, where he repeatedly requested
to be taken, said Bruns in conjunction
with Graber caused him to be taken to
a private hospital, to be there confined
and restrained against his wishes, with
out notice to contestants or his friends,
preventing him, moreover, from seeing
any of these. Furthermore that deceas
ed Jifgrged a friend to send for Schneider
and Metzger, who, when they called at the
private hospital, were refused admission;
arid that for the purpose of causing
fitreitberger to revoke the will of 1594.
Pruns fraudulently represented that con
testants did not cnre for him any longer.
fstants also charge Bruns and Gra
ber with inducing deceased to pay $25,
000 for a ranch in Teharaa County that
Ot worth over $uO3O.
Contestants pray that the court take
proof of the execution and validity of the
will of April ?,. 1894, and establish its va
lidity, and that the will of April I
be denied probate; and that if the first
named will be not produced, or it shall
be proved that the same was destroyed
prior to the death of testator, that it be
adjudged and decreed that the same was
fraudulently destroyed. The matter will
he heard before Judge Ellsworth next
Monday.

WANT TO SEE
THE DOCTOR
Dr. Ross Is Desired by
His Late Landlady.
FRIENDS ARE IN THE LURCH
A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE, BUT
SMALL FUNDS.
Now Believed He Is on His Way
to Manila to Prescribe for the
Soldiers and Insur
gents.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
S>OS Broadway, Auf. 27.
A few months ago a very fashionable,
middle-aged physician, giving the name
of Dr. A. Ross, engaged rooms at the
PleaÂ«anton Hotel. Thirteenth and Wash- :
ington streets. The doctor also opened 'â 
offices in the Macdpnough block, but :
seemed to have more friends than pa- j
tients. Now the doctor Is missing, and not
a trace of him can be found by those who
have an interest in him, or by anybody ,
Mrs. Robinson, the landlady of the
Pleasanton. listened for three months to
the doctor's plausible stories of foes that
would soon be collected, with which he |
could pay his board bill, and now she .
wishes she had not been so patient.
For a few d;iys the doctor has not been â 
seen. Friends have called on him. but he
was not there to receive them. Many or
these friends were ladies, and It is said |
that Row has been twice divorced, has
another divorce case pending In some
court, and was paving the way to make
another matrimonial venture.
When the landlady became convinced !
that the doctor was neither occupying his
rooms nor doing business at his offices
she made an examination of his quar
ters, and found enough to convince her
that her guest had permanently forgotten
his board bill. In his rooms were a few old
pans and a kettle of no value, and the
general appearance of everything showed j
that he did not intend to return.
While the doctor was In Oakland he
made much headway in certain circles, â 
but it is now found that his credit was
not so good as it was thought to be. Many
people would like a reckoning, and some
of them have taken possession of the bits
of personal effects found In the room, but i
have given the landlady notice that they I
do not intend to be responsible for his
delinquencies. It has been reported to \
Mrs. Robinson that Dr. Ross has gone to ,
Manila, but there is no proof of this state
ment. ________________
WERE DASHED DOWN
AN ELEVATOR SHAFT
VERY RAPID FLIGHT TB.OJL
THE THIRD STORY.
Samuel Guilford and L. Butterfleld,
Two Workmen, Miraculously
Escape From a Dreadful
Deatn.
Oa-.LAND, Aug. 27.â Fred 14. Butter
field and Samuel Guilford had a thrilling
experience on a runaway elevator this
morning, miraculously escaping death.
The accident occurred in the new Tint
building, 511 Thirteenth street, where both
men were employed in moving E. R.
Tutt's business stock.
According to their story, they were
carrying three ladders up to the last floor
by the elevator, -^s the elevator ap
proached the top floor with its burden and
the men were about to stop its upward
flight, the car suddenly started to drop.
There was nothing to grasp but the hand
rope. Mr. Buttertield made a lunge for it,
but by this time the elevator was going
downward so rapidly that hisÂ» hand was
severely burned, and he was compelled
to release his hold. Then the car dashed
down the three stories into the bsfe
ment with a noise that attracted tha at
tention of all other workmen about the
p!a>-fc.
Guilford was lying on the floor of the
car stunned, his face bleeding. At the
Receiving Hospital he underwent the s< t
ting of several fractured bones and his
left great toe had to be amputated. But
terflpl'.l was more fortunate. His iniu
ries were not so serious. The former is
a married man, residing at 419^ Tenth
street. Both men are doing nicely and
their injuries are not considered fatal.
An invKtigatlon showed that the safety
pins that check the tall of the elevator
were defective. The elevator la an old
hydraulic affair and was moved to tho
new place from the former store.
GOOD FELLOWS TO
MARRY OR BANQUET
NUMBER ONE TO CABBY OUT
HIS PLEDGE AT ONCE.
The Remaining Eleven to Draw Lots
to Determine Which Shall Be
the Next Victim in the
Game.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 27.
Six years ago twelve young college men
at Berkeley formed themselves Into a
club which they called the "Good Fellow
Club." For several years after leaving
the university the Fellows met at regu
lar intervals to enjoy jinks at some secret
spot. Four months ago the young men
decided that with advancing years it was
Incumbent on them to take a more se
rious view of life than to consider it as fit
only for Jollification. They determined to
furm a marriage bureau, and lots were
drawn numbered from 1 to 12. The man
who drew the first number was either to
be married within eight months or treat
the club to a great banquet. Succeeding
numbers were to be similarly placed be
tween a marriage and a banquet in suc
ceeding periods. At the first drawing
Fred B. Brown of East Oakland drew
No. 1. Yesterday he sent to the club a
formal notice that he had complied with
tho requirements, and invited the eleven
members to be at his wedding banquet at
Lot Angeles on September 13.
The remaining members are: Joseph
B Garber, Ed J. Pringle, Edward J.
Haas H. S. Allen, Edward Shanklin,
Robert T. McKlsick, Carlton W. Green,
Burbank G. Summers, George L. Blood,
Charles Turner and Brooks Palmer.

Progress of the Hearst
University Scheme.
CHOICE OF ONE HUNDRED
MBS. HEARST TO LEAVE FOR
THE BELGIAN CAPITAL.
The Five Lucky Architects Will
Come to Berkeley to Perfect
Their Labors at Her
Expense.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 27.
The preparations for arranging a plan
for making the Berkeley University the
most unique and perfect in the world are
being pressed as rapidly as circumstances
will permit. The first stage has been
reached, and the preliminary competitions
that were Invited are now at Brussels.
According to the terms upon which the
competition is to proceed, as outlined by
the advisers of Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst,
the 100 architects selected all over the
world to submit plans are to have their
designs at Brussels by July 15 of this
year. Word haÃ been received that these
plans are ready to be opened by the
judges, and In a few weeks the result
will be made known.
Mrs. Hearst will leave in six weeks for
the Belgian capital, and Regent J. B.
Relnstein wlil also be present, he being
one of the judges. The board that will
pass on the designs will consist of twelve
of the beet known men in Europe, compe
tent to decide on such matters. These
Judges will select from the 100 designs the
five which they consider the best in
every respect. The architects who have
submitted the five accepted designs will
then come to Berkeley at the expense of
Mrs. Hearst, and will survey the uni
versity grounds, after which they will
perfect their plans and apply their origi
nal designs to suit the conditions at the
university site.
One year will be given them in which to
submit their completed plans and specifi
cations to the board of Judges, and from
these five plans will be accepted the one
which will be the basis for the mammoth
scheme originated by Mrs. Hearst.
"There is a general idea that this uni
versity scheme is smoldering," said one of
the professors to-day; "but such is not
the case. Mrs. Hearst is seeing that
everything is done to expedite matters,
and already more has been accomplished
than we supposed could have been done
in the time that has elapsed since the
great scheme was first mooted. \\ ithin
three months we expect to have the five
fortunate candidates at Berkeley perfect
ing the details. This contest has excited
general interest throughout the collegiate
world and has been the means cf drawing
much foreign attention to our State Uni
versity." _______________

The work of the office has increased

cial work for Leslie's Weekly. His horn*
is In Elmira, New York. Mrs. Wildmar
accompanies him to his new post ol

said:
"Ik is possible that my brother will bÂ«
appointed a Commissioner to take charge
of the provisional government of the
Philippines together with Admiral
Dewey and ex-Consul" to Manila O. R.
Williams. At a Cabinet meeting it waÂ«
regarded as too early to appoint such a
commission, and it was decided to wail
until military rule had ceased in th*
islands.
"The insurgents at Hongkong and Ca
vite have petitioned the President to
name my brother, and In the event ol
his doing so I will become acting Consul
General. I will have power to act wheth

however, subject to his dictation. I will
be in effect his agent."

FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE
Mrs. Botkin Builds
a Wall of Legal
Technicality.
Her Attorneys Demand Her
Releaseâ Case Without
a Fracedent.
The local police will receive to-day the
evidence they have so persistently sought
against Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. Detective
.McVey Will arrive to-day from Dover,
â¢Del., and without delay will place in the
hands of Chief Lees the facts with which
the Eastern authorities expect to prove
Mrs. Botkin guilty of the murder of Mrs.
John T. Dunning and Mrs. J. D. Deane.
Without these facts the local prosecutors
' can do nothing- except to prevent Mrs.
Botkin from escaping upon technicalities.
The woman's attorneys applied to Judge
Carroll Cook yesterday for a writ of
habeas corpus. The application was
granted . and will be heard to-morrow
morninp.
The defense has therefore taken the In
itiative without knowing that the Dover
detective was so near San Francisco, on
his way across the continent. It is prob
able that the District Attorney will have
something more than technicalities with
â which to combat the technicalities of the
defense. The Eastern detective is cred
ited with havin : evidence of a very posi
tive character a â inst Mrs. Botkin. He
will come, of course, with the box of
candy in which the pofson was concealed.
This box and its wrapper, samples of the
candy and the superscription on the cover
will give the city authorities a tangible
basis upon which to work.
Thus far practically no evidence of
value has been discovered here. The
police have learned fully the relations
that existed between Mrs. Botkin and
Dunning. This relation. Involving a dou
ble life on the part of Dunning, gives
something of a motive for the offense
of which the woman Is accused. Her
papers and letters have also been seized
and will be used to compare specimens
of handwriting. The police hope also
to Identify Mrs. Botkin as the woman
who purchased candy under mysterious
circumstances at Stockton. Beyond this
the police have nothing.
The arrival of McVey to-day will ma
terially clear the situation. Very little
dimculty will be experienced in tracing
the candy-box to its maker. From the
m.iker will be learned the -names of the
retail dealers who bought the boxes. It
â¢will be the question therefore of only a
few days to know whether or not the
candy-box came from the Stockton deal
er. It may be possible, also, to identify
the candy. It is believed that the fatal
box was inclosed in a peculiar wrapper,
â¢which the retail dealer at Stockton will be
able positively to identify if It was such
as he used.
Comparisons of handwriting will then
be made. While the comparisons for gen
eral purposes may not amount to a groat
deal their effect will be greatly strength
ened by collateral evidence which the au
â  thorities possess. It will be remembered
that Mrs. Dunning received warnings and
threats carried to her in anonymous let
ters. If the handwriting in these letters
is similar to that on the cover of the
candy box and both resemble that of Mrs.
Botkin, the case of the prosecution will
be materially strengthened. Detective
McVey is the only person who can supply
this evidence.
"What else the detective knows must be
exploited after his arrival. He has. suc
ceeded in evading newspaper men on his
way across the continent, and even the
local police do not know what he pos
sesses. There is a hope that the corre
spondence of Mrs. Dunning will give the
supporting foundation Â£pr the fabric
against Mrs. Botkin. Twe daad woman
nas harassed for many month? before her
death by anonymous communications.
Borne of these may contain references that
will assist in revealing the identity of the
writer. Â«>
As already indicateu. Mrs. Botkin has
taken the initiative in the legal battle for
her life. Her attorneys began their tech
nical defense yesterday in suing for a
writ of habeas corpus. This is the first
Btep in a legal fight that has no precedent
Dr parallel in the United States. The au
â  thorities will demand thf extradition of
. Mrs. Botkin, whose attorneys will resist
stubbornly to the last. The application
for extradition involves a point of law
that has never been determined in the
United States. The law of this State spe
cifically declares that no person may be
' sxtradited unless proof of flight from the
Etate demanding extradition is supplied.
Mrs. Botkin never was in Delaware, and
poneequently could not have fled from
ihere. No provision seems to have been
made for the punishment of such a crim<;
is that of which Mrs. Botkin is accused.
At her bidding, under the theory of her
police accusers, death traveled across
the continent and brought desolation to
: It home, yet there appears to be no way
.egally by which she can be taken'before
the proper tribunal for trial.
The California law seems equally clear
>n the point that she cannot be tried by
:he courts of this State, as no provision is
made for the punishment of an offense
jart of which was committed out of the
State. These are the main points upon
R-hich a most interesting legal battle is
:o be fought. Mrs. Botkin will resist ex
;radition and will defy the authorities of
.his State to try her. This is the policy of

her attorneys, who have not yet discussed
the guilt or innocence of their client, ex
cept in generalities and sweeping de
nial^.
The police and District Attorney will
oppose the grant of a writ of habeas cor
pus on the ground that proceedings of a
criminal character are pending against
Mrs. Botkin in the Police Court. The
woman has been charged in Judge Joach
imsen's court with murder. This accusa
tion is made on "Information and belief."
which is not accepted by the laws of Cali
fornia. The police are aware of this, and
have no thought of holding Mrs. Botkin
under such a complaint or warrant. The
authorities are playing simply for delay
to permit the Dover detective to get here
with his evidence and demand from Gov
ernor Budd a solution of the problem
similar to that in the Durrant case, when
Judge Morrow ignored the national law on
habeas corpus and refused Durrant a
second writ, to which the Federal statutes
declared he was entitled.
If Judge Cook should refuse to grant
Mrs. Botkin's application for a writ of ha
beas corpus, her attorneys will contend
that she cannot be tried in this State, no
matter how conclusive the evidence
against her may be. This claim will be
based upon the interesting fact that in
the laws of this State no provision has
been made for the trial of such a crime of
which the woman is accused. On the
other hand, if Judge Cook grants the writ
.of habeas corpus the police will hold Mrs.
Botkin under the proceedings that have
been instituted in the Police Court. If
Judge Joachtmsen releases her ' before
Governor Budd passes on the question of
extradition she may go where she pleases.
In whatever aspect the case is viewed, it
presents one or the most interesting and
intricate legal problems ever submitted to
thg courts of the State or of the United
States.
WILL APPEAR IN
COURT ON MONDAY
Mrs. Botkin, Through Her Attorneys,
Is Granted a Writ of Habeas
Corpus by Judge
Cook.
The first legal steps have been taken
toward the rolease of Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kin, who is detained in this city charged
with the murder of Mrs. John P. Dunning
and Mrs. J. D. Deane of Dover, Del.
Through her attorneys, McGowan &
Squires and Knight & Heggerty, she has
applied for a writ of habeas corpus. This

GATTRELL REMEMBERS THE CONFECTIONS
The Candies He Sold Identical With Those in Which
the Poison Was Mixed.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 27.â Frank Gattrell was to-day shown the dis
patch from Dover published in The Call describing the kind of candy
contained in the poisoned box mailed to Mrs. Dunning. He said he be
lieved the oblong bonbons, the chocolate creams and the tongs were the
same he packed in the box purchased by the mysterious woman three
weeks ago. As to the flat wafers he was not so sure, unless that part of
the description had reference to some chocolate wafers dotted over with
white drops. The description of the tongs is identical with those used at
the Wave, being washed in a plate looking like silver, cheaply orna
mented, and about three inches long.

WILL RESIST HABEAS
CORPUS PROCEEDINGS
Acting District Attorney Hosmer
Will Make a Fight on Behalf of
the Delaware Authorities.
Acting District Attorney Hosmer will,
on behalf of the Delaware authorities, re
sist the efforts of Mrs. Botkin's attorneys
to secure her freedom. He was in consul
tation with Chief Lees for several hours
yesterday afternoon, going over the evi
dence so far gathered by the local police.
At the conclusion of the conference Mr.
Hosmer said:
"The people will oppose releasing the
accused woman. She was arrested on a
warrant, duly issued on a sworn com
plaint, and is therefore within the hands
of the law. But one point is raised in the
petitionâ that Mrs. Botkin is not extra
ditable because she is not a fugitive from
Justice. Her attorneys contend that she
has never been in the State of Delaware,
and therefore cannot be a fugitive. We
contend that she is.
"Between now and the hearing in the
habeas corpus proceedings I shall look up
decisions in this phase of the matter.
"I shall undertake to make all the de
fense I can when the case comes before
Judge Cook. Of course I cannot predict
the result. Another contention which I
shall make Is that the Superior Court has
no jurisdiction in the premises. The pris
oner is within the jurisdiction of the po
lice court. Judge Joachimsen issued the
warrant for her arrest and ordered that
the prisoner be brought before him. My
argument is that until the Police Judge
has acted in the matter the Superior
Court cannot intervene. The warrant on
which she was taken into custody is, I
consider, sufficient to hold hjer until the
proper tribunal has passed upon the evi
dence against her and decided whether or
not she should be held for trial."
Chief Lees' legal adviser has suggested
a metfhs by which Mrs. Botkin can be
held for trial in this State if she is not
token to Delaware.
The accused woman's name has not
been entered upon the prison record nor
upon the detinue book, upon which the
names of persons against whom there is
no charge are usually recorded. The law
requires that all persons incarcerated in
the City Prison shall be entered in the
prison register, but in the case of Mrs.
Botkin the law has not been obeyed. Chief
Lees gives as his reason for this proce
dure that the prisoner is in the custody of
the police court; that Judge Joachimsen
issued the warrant. It was served and
return made to Clerk Hays of Police
Court 3. _â¢ .
As far as can be learned, Judge Joach
imsen has not taken official cognizance of
the case, as it does not appear on his
court calendar. Mrs. Botkin's attorneys
allege that all these proceedings are ir
regular and they could procure her re
lease very quickly if it would be any ad
vantage to her.

DECLARE THEY WILL
PROVE HER INNOCENCE
Mrs. Botkin's Attorneys Will Not
Press Habeas Corpus Proceed
ings Until the Requisition
Papers Arrive.
George A. Knight, one of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin's attorneys, made the following
statement yesterday:
"In a consultation between Mr. Mc-
Gowan and myself to-day we concluded
to continue the hearing of the habeas
corpus proceedings until the arrival of the
requisition from Delaware. We are per
fectly seiure in our position. The woman
id innocent, and legally she cannot be
taken back to Delaware. The question is
simply o.ie oi' interpretation of an article
in the Federal constitution. Mrs. Botkin
is in no aonse a fugitive from justice. SlÂ»e
never fled fiom Delaware, because she/
had never been there.
"We purpose fighting extradition on
broad legal grounds, and there will be no
technical quibbling. Nothing will be done
that will not meet the approval of any
fair-minded Judge and competent lawyer.
"Mrs. Botkin naturally feels depressed
by her surroundings. She feels the dis
gTace of even the arrest. An inno
cent person always feels the dis
grace a great deal keener than a gullty
person. She has talked very freely with
Chief of Police Lees, and all of her letters
and papers for years back are now in the
hands of the police.
"I suppose comparisons are being made
as to handwriting, but I don't believe
there is a jury in any civilized country
that would hang a man on the unsupport
ed testimony of a writing expert, and they
ought not to."
Fnank McGowan is actively en
gaged in preparing a certain line of Mrs.
Botkin's defense, and he is more than
confident that she will never go back to
Delaware.
"We will contend that the proceedings
are irregular and that there was not suf
ficient evidence to warrant Mrs. Botkin's
arrest and detention," he said. "We have
agreed with the District Attorney and
Chief Lees to postpone tne hearing lor a
few days. While we might on a techni
cality secure her release on Monday
morning, it would be useless, as she
would be rearrested immediately on the
arrival of the officer with the evidence
and the requisition. Then the habeas
corpus proceedings would have to be gone
over again. We*prefer to have it come up
once and for nil and have it finally and
definitely settled."
Mr. Knight's attention w;as called to the
contradictory evidence given by hand
writing experts in the big will contests
tried in this city during the past five
years, and he was asked whether his side
would engage writing expends to combat
any testimony given by such witnesses.
The attorney replied that such testi
mony was weak and valueless and stated
that he could hire experts any day to
testify in any way he desired.

That much at least Is due divine
Providence. If Liliuokalani were to die
at this tide of her affairs it would have
been. only civil of heaven to have taken
â¢her .before the dawn of August twelfth.

very kindly intended of course, but I

had a cancer."

"Unfortunately, there is all truth in

perfect serenity. "You look surprised.
â  ! Js it because I smile? You see I have a
good doctor. I mean to get well. If

.-'â  not even afraid of life."
The. court sighed tenderly.
"I have needed courage to live," she
.added. "They say it is given to those
.â¢.â¢who have to endure."
"Noblesse oblige," I returned, po
' iitely.
The Queen v.as pleased to smile. Is
.. there any railk so sensitive to recognl
â  ;tlon as lost rank? The ex-Queen of
Hawaii has an eye to little matters of
:': this sortâ a gracious or a critical eye
: according as you remember them or as
you .do not. One has need of court
manners to go calling at Washington

find" that I am getting on. Moreover,
,*â¢â¢. my. heart, is in this. My sympathy goes

. "I am sure, indeed," I answered,
truthfully, "hardly any one could. I

"Why? I came here to be near my

There are duties, in every home. Is it
not bo? I ordered that the duties of
my house be attended to as usual. I
permitted no one to speak tÂ«^ me of
this" â she hesitated â "of this matter.
I did not permit myself to think of it.
Can you believe that? It is true. I
ignored."
All the Queen in Liliuokalanl spoke
there. I was compelled to quick ad
miration of the strength of the woman
and the pride of the Queen. I thought
of the picture that day had painted of
her to the curious mob â out of fond,
sentimental fancy, bien entendu â for
no one knew of her doings except her
household attendants, faithful watch
dogs of her privacy. It was known that
her doors were closed and it was con
jectured that even her stubborn cour
age had yielded to the strain under
which even aliens bent â the solemn
thunder of the guns which shook the
great house savagely, the requiem ' Ha
waii Ponoi" playing down her Flag, the
bugle sounding taps above its fall,
creeping through her Royal palms, In
sistent at her closed doors. And all
the sounds that welcomed a new sov
ereignty to rule her fathers' land.
Le roi est mort! Vive le roi! And
the king alive to hear.
There was a short, pregnant pause.
I knew, as one sometimes knows un
spoken thoughts, that. her own move
ments on this fateful day were passing
through her mind in swift review. The
lines about her mouth deepened, her
eyes were sad and far. Her women,
watching her, wept softly among them
selves. There were no tears in Liliu
okalani's eyes. But I think she is one
to weep in the heart. When she spoke
it was to go on quite naturally with her
thought.
"I made up my mind that I must be
brave, and to be brave I knew I must
be busy. For the morning I went to my
desk and sorted over all my letters.
They have accumulated during my ab
sence, and it Is a task. I have put off

for a good moment. This day," Liliu
okalani smiled bitterly, "gave me that
good moment. I wrote several letters
and then I put my mind upon, my book.
I am writing my third bookâ a work
on the Hawaiian words. There are
many of the old words which are pass
ing out of use â many now quite obso
lete; and yet their origin is interesting
and full of suggestion concerning the
manners and customs of our people be
fore â y OU know, in other days. I have
already written one book on the Ha
waiian music that will be valuable. I
hope, to those interested in such sub
jects. I have managed to put upon
paper the peculiar musical phrases of
the melees, even the oli-oli; that is the
gurgling sound our melee singers use in
wailing or chanting. It was a very
baffling task, but I wanted to preserve
the music of my country. That was all.
So I wrote and revised and planned and
kept my mind on other things. It was
while I was looking through my letters
that"â the Queen paused, "A few of
DURING THE FLAG-RAISING CEREMONIES THE QUEEN TRIED
TO FORGET WHAT WAS GOING ON BY LOOKING
OVER HER CORRESPONDENCE
my friends were here â my close friends,
my attendants. They were weeping
about me. It was not for me to weep.
We heard â you know â everything. I
spoke of other things. I do not remem
ber now of what, and It matters very
little â and t.ien I went on looking over
my letters."
The little court at the end of the
room sobbed audibly. A trio of voices
rose from the shadow of the palms,
singing the plaintive native music,
which is forever sounding in the
Queen's gardens. She sat, listening
quietly to the sobbing and the singing.
Her command is admirable.
"Did you send any protest?" I asked,
when the song was ended; "that is, did
you send one to Washington?"
"To Washington? To Washington?
Have I not exhausted Washington?
To whom would I make a protest? Tour
Government is a government of many
â by many," and this daughter of a
race which has one supreme and suf
ficient chief shut her lips derisively.
"When an appeal reaches the last of
your governors, It has had time to be
forgotten by the first. My people sent
their protest. That is as it should be â
but as for me â I have written enough
for the waste paper baskets of Wash
ington."
"I thought," I said, suggestively,
"that you might have some idea of go-
Ing on to Washington when Congress
meets in December, to make a personal
appeal."
Lilluokalani shook her head. "I
have," she said, "no such idea. I have
no ideas at all just now. I shall re
main in Honolulu. I shall live here, I
believe. I worked very hard for my
people, for my country, for my cause
while I was away in a foreign land, and
as you know, I worked in vain. I have
returned here to take up the life I lived
before I went away; a life of retire
ment among my friends, my books, my
thoughts. I am now, more than ever,
a woman In private life."
She spoke with indescribable bitter
ness. A woman In private life is sup
posed to be sheltered from the ills
which vex a Queen, but one must be
born to these safe joys to relish them.
No Queen deposed has ever yet ac
quired the taste, and I have known an
inconspicuous nobody or two who would
have given their ears to wear a crown
or even a shabby little coronet. And,
of course, under one or the other of
these decorative circumstances ears
would not be missed.
"I hear," said Liliuokalani, "that it
was not so gay over there as some per
sons expected."
"It was not gray at aIL Nearly every
one was weeping."
"Ah!" said the Queen, coldly. "Why
should they weep?"
"You mean it is for your people, not
ours, to weep. There is such a thing
as sympathy. I wish you could know â
perhaps you do â how many hearts were
filled with that."
"I know," she Interrupted, "I know."
"Admiral Miller himself " I said.
"Ah! yes, I have heard."
"And," I said, "all Americans who
love their own Flag "
The Queen made a sudden movement.
"If it had been yours!" she said sharp
ly. "If it had been your Flag!"
As if that were not what I have been
thinking ever since I came here to think
about it at all!
"I said that my day was quiet," she
went on passionately. "I said it was
humdrum. I said that I put my mind
on other things " She laid her hand
touchingly to her breast. "But that is
not here. Of my heart I do not speak.
My heart is my country, my flag, my
people. My heart is Hawaii."18

TRIED TO SHOOT
BISMARCK
In 1566 Bismarck was returning to his
home from the palace, where he had
been to see the King. While passing
through the large street of Berlin called
Unter den Linden, and quite near the
place where Hoedel and Nobeling after
ward attempted the life of Emperor
William, he suddenly heard a shot fired
close behind him. He turned sharply
around and saw a young man, who,
with a smoking revolver,* was aiming
at him. He strode up to ftie man at
once and seized the arm that held the
revolver, while with the other hand he
grasped the throat of the would-be
murderer. The latter, however, had
had time to pass his weapon into his
left hand, and now fired three shots in
quick succession. Bismarck felt himself
hurt in the shoulder and In one of his
ribs but he held his assailant fast until
some soldiers came up and took hold
Then Bismarck walked home at a
brisk pace, and reached his own house
long before anybody there could know
what had happened. The Countess had
some friends with her when her hus
band entered the drawing room. He
greeted all in a friendly manner and
begged to be excused for a few min
utes, as he had some urgent business
to attend to. He then walked into the
next room where his desk stood and
wrote to inform the King of the oc
currence. Having attended to this duty
he returned to the drawing room and
made one of his little standing Jokes,
"Well, are we to have no dinner to
day? You always keep me waiting."
He sat down and partook heartily of
the dishes set before him, and it waa
only when the dinner was over that he
walked up to the < 'oijntess, kissed her
on the forehead, wished her in the old
German way "Gesegnete Mahlzelt"
(may your meal be blessed), and then
added, "You see I am quite well." She
looked up at him. "Well," he contin
ued, "yon must not be anxious, my
child: somebody has fired at me, but it
Is nothing, as you see."
In 1860, when the tide of political paa
sion'still ran high, after the storm of
the preceding years, he went one day
into a Rathskeller in Berlin to take a
glass of Grunthaler beer; a man near
him. feeling himself supported by the
presence of his friends, began to abuÃe
a member of the royal family. Bis
marck looked at him and said quietly,
"If you have rot left this room before
I have finished my beer I'll break this
glass over your head," which he pro
ceeded to do, according to his promise,
calmly paying for the broken glass af
terward and walking leisurely away.
GENERAL FITZHUGH LEE ON CUBA`S POLITICAL FUTURE
JACKSON VIL.L.E, *ia., AUg. .:Â«.â -11l vie .riuijuu. iann.= <xim ...i.^o mki
war is no longer discussed. The question of supreme importance now
concerns the plans for the reconstruction of Cuba. "What will be the
political future of c island?" "How r r tensive is the military occu
pation to be?" and inquiries of similar import are the first to be put by
every man who has returned from Cuba since the signing of the protocol.
There is probabl. no other man in the country who can speak with so
much authority or so interestingly on the subject as Major General Fitzhugh
Lee. Since the probability of his appointment as Military Governor of Cuba
duriner the period of American occupation became a well denned certainty,
General Lee has maintained a dignified silence, refusing to t; Ik for publi
cation. Before he was summoned to Washington, however, while still in
command of the Seventh Army Corps in Jacksonville, he talked freely with
the Sunday Call's correspondent in regard to the subject of Cuba's political
future, as he was then able to do in an unofficial capacity. From the tone
of these utterances there is no doubt that General Lee understands and is in
complete accord with the views of the administration with regard to the
treatment of the Cuban situation. Following is what General Lee said at
thp time:
THE rules and regulations pre
scribing the course to be fol
lowed on the island of Cuba,
now that the war is over, will
be decided upon by the Govern
ment of the United States, but only so
tar as to embrace a provisional control
upon the part of the United States,
pending the formation of a govern- I
ment which will have the approval and
sonsent of a majority of the voters of
the island, as decreed and set forth by j
their representatives assembled in leg- j
islatlve conference.
Without, of course, being able to ,
foreshadow the policy of the Govern
ment of the United States, it may be
said that during the transition state
from Spanish to "home" rule, this Gov
ernment will insist upon peace and or
der everywhere, upon full security to
human life, and upon a strict mainte
nance cf property rights of all classes
and nationalities. In order to effect
that purpose it will be necessary to
have an armed occupation by the Unit
ed States troops as a sort of constabu
lary, or, in other words, as a guarantee
to the people who are now on the isl
and and to those who may hereafter
come that law and order and peace
will be insisted upon in all portions of
Cuba.
In taking this action the United
States can scarcely be accused of an
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 1898.
intention to interfere in any way,
shape or form with the government of
the island, which it is perfectly willing j
to leave to the people themselves, pro
vided the guarantees as before stated
are satisfactory.
Whether Cuba will ultimately become
a republic, or later be merged into an
American colony, and later still possi
bly into an American State, is a ques
tion for the future and for the people
of the island to determine. By proving
to the Spanish soldiers and residents
who elect to remain there and to Span
ish merchants and property holders
and others that a safe and suitable
government will be assured them, and
that their rights will be respected in
every particular as strictly as the
rights of all other classes of citizens, it
is to be hored that their assistance
may be obtained, with that of the con
servative Cubans and Americans, in
forming a government which will be
sufficient for all purposes. and which
will remain as formed until those in
terested under forms of law shall pro
ceed to change it.
The solution of the problem of estab
lishing a fair and stable government in
Cuba does not present any insurmount
able dilliculties. It is almost certain
that the interests of the people from
the United States and other countries
who are in Cuba now or who settle
therfÂ» in the future will become too
great to be exposed to revolutionary
riots, even should there be found an
element disposed to them. The Span
iards and the foreign-born inhabitants
of the island will undoubtedly realize
that it is to their advantage to work in
harmony with the conservative und
law abiding portion of the natives for
the strict observance of the rights of
all.
It is difficult to say how many Ameri
can troops will be required for the oc- j
cupation of Cuba during the period ;
pending the organization of a stable i
and efficient local government. The j
number should be sufficient to inspire j
confidence in the complete preservation
of order, so that capital and enterprise ,
will not be afraid to invade the island
and do their nart in the work of its
restoration to peaceful prosperity. The
change will no doubt be gradual, the
United States troops taking the place
of the Spanish soldiery as fast as the
latter are withdrawn from the various
garrisons. As the mission of the Amer
icans is to preserve order and not to
wage war, it will scarcely be necessary j
to move them into Cuba in numbers \
equal to those of the retiring Span
iards. It may seem wise, however, to
the Government of the United States to
take advantage of tnis opportunity to
give some of the volunteer soldiers who
did not have the opportunity to partici
pate in the active hostilities a chance
to secure a somewhat more thorough
military training than they have thus
far obtained. This consideration may
lead to the employment of a larger
body of men than would otherwise be
used, and to the taking of some of the
newer volunteer regiments for this
service.
It is not conceivable that the native
inhabitants of Cuba will receive the
troops of the United States in any un
friendly or hostile spirit. They must
realize that it is to the arms of the
United States that they owe their
speedy deliverance from Spanish rule,
that the mission of the United States
in the island is not one of conquest, but
of friendly concern for the establish
ment of order, and that it is to their
advantage as well as to that of the
other residents of the island to make
the task as light as possible.
An encouraging factor in the problem
of Cuba's political future is presented
by the attitude of the provisional gov
ernment, as explained by their repre
sentatives in this country, and by the
emissary who has just come from their
headquarters in Cuba. From this it
appears that those who now control
the administration of civi! affairs In
the island are willing and anxious to
assist to the fullest extent of their t
lower in,' bringing about the establish
ment of a suitable and ; satisfactory
government. It seems to be :no part of
;heir plan to seize the reins of govern
ment or even to hold the authority
that has already been intrusted to
hem, as was attempted in the case of
some of the South American countries
m the achievement of their independ
ence. On the contrary, the terms under
which the present civil administration
exists and which it has declared its in
tention of respecting; provide for the
-ailing of an assembly representing as
nearly as possible all classes in Cuba,
md to turn over to this assembly. their
present authority and leave to it the
task of constructing * v a new govern
ment.
This procedure, If carried out, will be
the first step taken by the Cubans un
der the protection of the United States
toward their own government as a free
people. Its conduct. will be, in a meas
ure, a test of the | ability of the Cuban
people" to control and direct their own
affairs. To the American .who has
watched the successful ..operation of
our own constitution It will- doubtless
be an encouraging indication that the
political leaders of the. Cuban people
seem disposed to accept its principles
and general outline for their own gov
ernment. .'.'â - -' .-'_â ' - v . ...

ofThese o,d fellows, to which we kids
used to listen in open-mouthed won
der We didn't always believe the tales
of course but we were too discreet to
say so. One man did laugh disdain
fully at one old salt's yarn and he was
in sick bay for a week afterward.
"Old Harry Sharp, chief bos'n's
mate who had been with Hull on the ]
Constitution, told me one story of a j
little event that took place at Naga
saki, Japan, -hen we weren't as
friendly with the British as we are
now.
"The ship In v.Mch Sharp was serv
ing in 1870 was assigned to service in
Asiatic waters. She was commanded
by Captain Joseph Piper, who had as
much love for a Britisher as Satan has
for holy water. One afternoon the
ship was swinging at anchor with 20 j
fathoms of chain out when the lookout |
reported a British man-of-war coming j
into the harbor flying the admiral's
pennant. That meant a salute. Gun
crews were piped and the salute was
fired, the Britisher replying gun for
gun. Twenty-one guns were fired, and
then, to the surprise of everybody,
Captain Piper turned to his quarter
gunner and said, 'Fire six more guns.
Astonishment was depicted on every
line of the gunner's face, but an order
was gospel to him, and bang! bang,
in quick succession went six more
guns. When the Englishman had
reached her anchorage and while the
admiral *\vas on the American with his
flag lieutenant the younger officer said
to Captain Piper: 'Pardon me. cap
tain, but we have been two weeks com
ing from the South Sea Islands, and
has there been any change in the in
ternational code of salutes in that
time?'
" 'Well,' said Piper, 'I fired 21 guns
for the queen of England, five for the
United States and one for Joe Piper, by
God.'
"The Englishmen left the ship, and
later the matter was investigated
through the United States Minister at
Tokio, and every mother's son of the
American crew swore by all that was
good and holy that only 21 guns had
been fired. But the upshot of it all
was that Piper was relieved from the
command and sent home."
LIQUID AIR
FOR BLASTING
HE most interesting application
r \ y o f liquid air which has hitherto
I been tried on a commercial scale
! is to make an explosive by mix
in? it with carbon. So said Pro
fessor Ewing in a paper just read be
fore the London Society of Arts. When
liquid air, enriched by the evaporation
of a large part of its nitrogen, is mixed
with powdered charcoal, it forms an
explosive comparable in powder to dy
namite, and which, like dynamite, can
be made to go oft violently by using;
a detonator.
To make the explosive the liquid, con
taining about 40 or BO per cent of oxy
gen, is poured on fragments of wood
charcoal, two to four cubic millimeters
in size. These are kept from scattering -
under the ebullition of the liquid by
mixing them into a sort of sponge with
about one-third of their weight of cot
ton wool. The liquid which remains is,
of course, richer in oxygen than that
which is originally applied, and when
the mixture is allowed to stand long,
all the liquid evaporates and the ex
plosive power disappears. It must,
' therefore, be mixed at or near the place
I where it is to be used. But the cotton
i wadding, impregnated with coarse
charcoal powder, can take up more
than enough of the liquid to supply
oxygen for its complete combustion,
arid when put quickly into thick in
sulating cases of paper, it retains its
full explosive power for five or ten
minutes. After an interval, which
ranges from fifteen to thirty minutes,
according to the size of the cartridge,
all explosive power is lost.
Experiments were made with this ex
plosive on the parade ground at Mu
nich, and a practical test on a large
scale has gone on for some months In a
coal mine at Pensburg, not far from
Munich, and are claimed to have given
very satisfactory results.
The chief advantage of the explosive
j is its cheapness, the cost being simply
I that of the power used in liquefying the
air. Even the fact that after a short
time the mixture ceases to be capable
of exploding may be urged as * recom
mendation in one respect, foi- if a de
tonator hangs fire there i* no -tanger
of the charge going off accidentally
some time .after the explosion Â« due,
nor is there any danger of 1* being
purloined or used for criminal purposes
It is questionable, however, if such
an unstable explosive can ever be
found either convenient or economical,
except, perhaps, in large quarries
where a large amount of blasting Is to
{be done at one place.SNAKES BY THE MILLION
COIL OF SNAKES BREAKING THE LIMB OF A TREE.
When the rocks get too warm in the hot summer days the
snakes love to climb into the trees bordering the river and en
joy the warm air. For some reason they take a great delight in
forming a wriggling, coiling network of snakes. As this ball
of snakes increases in size by eager newcomers the limb grad
ually bends, and very frequently the increasing mass of rep
tiles break it. Along the river bank are scores of branches and
limbs that have been broken in this fashion.
SNAKES, snakes everywhere; but
not one them will bite.
There are hundreds, thou
sands, millions of them, all
spread out on the logs at the
foot of Klamath Falls in Ore
gon.
And what Is more the residents up
there rather encourage their existence.
For any one caught killing any of them
Is likely to be zealously prosecuted. In
fact, it Is a case of the people liking
snakes.
These water snakes of the Klamath
River are one of the wonders of nat
ural history. Scientists have spent
years in studying them and there is
a great deal -"â >â¦ to learn. The snakes
are absolutely harmless and belong to
what is known as the "eutaenia" fam
ily. For miles and miles up and down
the river they can be seen at any time
during the warm season. During the
winter they roll themselves into living
balls, sink to the soft mud at the bot
tom of the river and pass several
months hibernating.
These snakes seem to be most nu
merous in the vicinity of Klamath.
Falls, the county seat of Klamath
County, Oregon. This is a town of 1500
people and makes some pretension to
being metropolitan. Yet there are
snakes running wild in the streets all
summer long.
â¢ Early in the spring the snakes come
from the bottom of the river and dur
ing the first warm days spend their
time sunning themselves on the logs.
As the season wears along the snakes
become more and more numerous, until
the logs will no longer hold them and
they begin to climb the river banks.
At "first they are rather timid and
scurry off into the water at the ap
proach of a human being, but in a short
time soon grow to learn that no harm
will come to them. When this stage of
intimacy with the inhabitants of Klam
ath Falls is reached the snakes can be
watched from a =hort distance' and they
will not pay the least attention. It is
even possible to walk among them, but
not many people care to do this.
Although the people up in Klamath
Falls know the snakes are no more
harmful than a pigeon, nobody ever
goes in swimming during the "snake
season."
To see the snakes amusing themselves
on the river bank during the long
TUMBLING c ROLL OF SNAKES BACK INTO THE RIVER.
In the early fall, when the rocks are beginning to take on a slight chill the
snakes have the fashion of gathering in balls. Per haps it arises through the
gelfishncss of the big snakes trying to keep above the chill rocks by coiling over
the smaller snakes. At any rate, these ballu of snakes are frequently seen of the
size of big barrels. Before they begin to grow torpid through the weather the
whole ball will dissolve and slip away if a stone is thrown into the heap. Later
on they become so torpid that a ball of them is sometimes rolled over by using a
piece of board as a lever.

1 the "creeps." In fact, many people In
Klamath Falls cannot be induced to go
near the river for fear of seeing horri
ble sights.
What starts the snakes seems to be
something of a mystery. A bunch of
several thousand will be stretched out
on the rocks as motionless as if dead.
Suddenly one moves, then another and
another. Instantly the whole mass be
gins to wriggle. Here and there the
snakes glide over one another uttering
a peculiar squeal that is almost blood
curdling.
Then the fun begins. The snakes are
from five to six feet in length and
thick in proportion. Their bodies are
correspondingly heavy, but they move
about with the greatest ease. All
through the wriggling mass big fellows
can be seen raising themselves high in
the air and snapping their jaws, just
as if they were angry and would attack
the first creature that came near them.
But it is all fun, and when they get
tired they draw out to one side and give
some of the others a chance.
In a few minutes the wriggling mass
somehow gets to moving in a circle.
Round and round they go, one trying to
catch the other, but never succeeding.
The air is now full of squeals of the
blood-curdling kind.
After the snakes have been "exercis
ing" a few minutes a peculiar. Inde
scribable odor can be noticed. At first
it is not very unpleasant, but after a
while a similarity to skunk can be de
tected. What the smell eventually be
comes is not known, for at this stage
of the game all spectators move back
as far as is necessary.
â¢Why don't you people get rid of
those snakes?" I asked one of the In
habitants who had been watching the
performance one day last week.
"Don't want to," he replied. "They
are useful as well a"s ornamental. And
besides there's another reason why we
don't give the boys permission to go
out among them with clubs."
"What's that?" I asked.
"They'd smell bad."
"Don't they smell bad now?"
"Yes, pretty bad, that's true, but that
ain't a marker to the way they'd smell

WILD RIDES
ON THE
OLD SANTA FE TRAIL.
Remarkable experience of Buffalo Bill, F. X. Aubrey and
other famous scouts and daring pony express messengers.
THE old Santa Fe trail, 'Ike many
of the world's great highways,
has been a racecourse at times,
over which some of the most
marvelous rides have been ef
fected by men w" -se powers of
endurance have never been excelled In
history.
Among those who were famous as
long distance riders In the days of the
"Commerce of the Prairies" was F. X.

We were standing on the sidewalk
n front of Sherring's saloon and I was
istening eagerly to all the old resident
)f Klamath Falls had to tell me, en
:irely oblivious to surroundings.
Suddenly he took hold of my coat and
gave it a gentle tug. "Step off here
a moment an"d let them pass by,"
he said.
I did as told and stood in the gut
ter while a brace of large snakes
rapidly passed along the sidewalk
in the direction of the river.
"But don't these snakes ever do
any harm?" I asked.
"Oh, yes; everything has its draw
backs, you know," the old timer re
plied. "On these warm days, after
a cold night, the snakes climb into
the trees and hang there in a sort
of network. As long as there are
only a few it don't matter, but
sometimes they get so thick they

"There's another trick these
snakes have," he continued, after a
pause, "but you won't see it until
next month. That's rolling them
selves into balls. Hundreds of
them get together and mix them
selves up so badly you can't
tell which Lead and tail belongs to the
same snake. And it takes them a long
time to get apart. I've seen some men
roll a ball of them as big as a barrel
and tumble it kerplash into the river.
How the snakes on the inside manage
to live Is more than I can say."
Snakes are not the only queer things
they have in abundance at Klamath
Falls. This is also the "toad" season.
At this time myriads of the tiny sau
rians come down on one side of the
river, cross the bridge, go right through
the town and up on the other side.
Where they come from and where they
go to no Klamath resident knows.
These toads are about one inch long,
and are a feast for the snakes. The
reptiles swallow at least a dozen of
them apiece, and still there are always
millions of toads Ipft, hopping, hop
ping toward the bridge, across it anti
into the country beyond.
As well as snakes and toads, Klam
ath Falls also has a periodical visit
from a bullfrog "wave." This comes
every three or four years, and "mil
lions" again is the only numeral that
will describe the quantity of the rep
tiles. They always come during the
skin shedding season and wander far
from the river bank, on warm days
they will get on the sunny side of a
house and pile on top of one another
as high as the window sills. Here they
pull off their skins and eat them. After
this act is accomplished they disap
pear, no man knows where.
All summer the inhabitants of Klam
ath Falls have some aquatic visitor to
interest them, and when the long win
ter days come and the rain comes
down in torrents many grow quite lone
ly and long for the return of the snake
season.

Aubrey was a Scotch-Canadian by
birth and emigrated direct from Quebec
to the remote West. He was a man of
education, apparently, for I find that
he was the author of one or two meri
torious articles on a journey and so
journ in California, which were pub
lished in one of the r jly magazines of
the country, about the time of the dis
covery of gold on the Pacific Coast. He
had also traveled extensively through
the then almost inaccessible region of
what is now the territory of Arizona,
and from him was first learned the fact
that the savages of that remote Mexi
can country employed gold bullets in
charging their crude firearms.
General Marcy met F. X. Aubrey in
1849, who had just returned from Cali
fornia, and en route crossed the Colo
rado near the outlet of the big canyon,
where he met some Indians, with
whom, he informed Marc he ex
changed leaden for golden rifle balls,
and that these Indians did not have
the slightest idea of the relative value
of the two metals.
The first ride Aubrey attempted was
in 1850. He made a bet that he could
cover the distance from Sxnta Fe.
N. M., to Independence Mo., over the
trail, in alght days. It is 765 miles be
tween the two points via the "Santa
Fe trail," as the freight caravans
traveled it, and by that route, on a
wager of $1000, Aubrey was to ride.
Aubrey succeeded in winning, making
his destination, the Jones House in In
dependence, three hours before the ex
piration of his time. During this, his
first ride, he killed a number of horses,
the death of one when within twenty
five miles of Council Grove compelling
him to walk to that place, carrying hip
saddle on his back, where he obtained
another anlmart and continued his won
derful ride.
This feat of Aubrey's was regarded
as the greatest ride ever made by any
one in ancient or modern times, and he
became the hero of the incipient bor
der town. Independence, where he was
feted and made the lion of the day.
His fame spread throughout the entire
c WARM CORNER ON THE ROCKS, KLAMATH FALLS, OREGON.
From a photograph by Mrs. Sarah E. Harshbarger.
The photograph from which this sketch was made was taken in a quiet corner of the Harshbarger back
yard, which runs down to the river. The photograph was taken during the summer, when the temperature of the
days and nights was warm and even. In the fall of the year, when the nights are chill and the days are warm, the
snakes gather in the greatest number, for they dearly love to come out of the cold water and task in the warm sun

was well known.
Although pec-ple marveled much at
the wonderful endurance of the man,
and the remarkable time In which ne
had made the trip, still Aubrey himself
was not at ail satisfied with it. He de
termined to break that record, and the
following: season he made another
wager, of, $5000 in gold, that he would
succeed in doing P . -.
He accomplished his record-breaking
clash across the great plains in the
marvelous time of only five days and
thirteen hours. His objective point
was the same hotel, the Jones House,
where he had ridden to on his former
trip. On this one, when he reached
that hostelry, he was perfectly ex
hausted and in a fainting condition, his
horse quivering from head to foot and
white with foam. Aubrey was lifted
from the back of his faithful animal by
His friends and carried into his room in
the house, where he lay in a complete
stupor for two dnys.
Six horses, which previous to- starting
from Santa Fe had been stationed at
distances varying from twenty-live to
"fty miles along the route, fell dead
under him, so terribly fast did he force
them on.
He possessed a beautiful mare Nel
lie, a favorite animal, noted for her
speed and endurance, but she expired
at the eid of the first 150 miles
Aubrey was killed by Major Richard
v eightman, a volunteer officer of the
Mexican War. and at the time of the
tragedy was publishing a paper In
Santa Fe. He and Aubrey had been
warm friends for years. After his sec
ond great ride Aubrey left Santa Fe for
California, and upon his departure for
that region Weightman published an
account of his friends leaving, which,
however, did not at all meet with Au
brey's approval. Upon the latter's re
turn to Santa Fe in 1554 he and Weight
man met, of course, journeyed to a
saloon, where both ordered whisky but
before either had time to raise' his
glass to his mouth Aubrey said to
Weightman, "Why did you publish that
lie about my going to California?"
The manner in which Aubrey put the
question angered Alajor Weightman,
and he threw his whisky in Aubrey's
face. Aubrey reached for his revolver,
but before he could draw it Weightman
sprang upon him and plunged his bowle
knife into Aubrey's heart, killing him
instantly. Weightman was, of course,
acquitted of the charge of murder.
Aubrey lies buried in an unknown
grave.
On his last great ride he rode day and
night, stopping only long enough to leap
from his tired animal and spring on
a fresh one. He made more than 200
miles every twenty-four hours, and all
the sleep he took aggregated but three
hours during the entire five days. Au
brey's ride eclipsed that famous one
recorded in the old English legends of
the outlaw Dick Turpin, from London
to York.
Weightman was a dapper little fel
low, extremely polite and affable, prid
ing himself upon "first family" connec
tions, and always sported a fine cane.
He had a small round ball of a head,
bald on top. light hair, florid com
plexion and small, piercing, deep-set
eyes. He was a man of some ability,
a fierce Southerner and defender of
slavery. He was plucky. He was as poor
as he was proud, a high liver, with the
tastes and habits of a millionaire and
the purse of a pauper. He resided
In Atchison. Kan., for several years;
was City Recorder for one or two terms
and was a candidate for re-election In
1861, but was defeated. When de
prived of his office he was literally re
iuced to extremities. Weightman was
a most gullant officer in the Mexican
war, and when hostilities commenced
between the North and South he joined
.he Confederate forces, with whom all
lis sympathies were enlisted. At the
errible battle of Wilson's Creek, at the
lead of his brigade, he was ki'.led at the
i^ery summit of "Bloody Hill"- three
mllets pierced his body. He and Gen
?rU Lyon fell within thirty -"-arris o
>ach other. Both were brou-rht off the
leld and laid side by side upon blank
;ts under the shade of the same tree.
William F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) has
nade a remarkable record as a long
llstance rider, not for speed, but endur

SNAKES GORGING THEMSELVES WITH TOADS.
Klamath Falls has another Silurian wonder outside its
millions of snakes. Every year in the fall, about September,
countless toads, about the size of one's thumb, come hopping
through one end of the town and make for the other end and
across the big bridge which spans the river. Where they
come from and where they go nobody knows. All the inhabit
ants have to say is that regularly every year in the fall the
deluge of toads passes through the town and disappears over
the bridge and there's millions of them. The snakes make
an annual feast of these little fellows, and they gather by the
thousands at the bridge to intercept them. Each snake
usually devours ttight or en toads, but this evidently makes
no impression on the number of toads, for, according to tha
natives, ''there's always millions of toads left."
The Klamath Falls has another wonder â its bullfrogs.
The deluge of bullfrogs comes along every three or four years
and, like the toads, there doesn't seem to be any limit to them.
They pile up in the warm corners of porches and back yards
several feet deep, get the chill out of their bones and then,
like the toads, they hop along and disappear .
army officer of hierh rank, who was
nevertheless a plainsman and hunter
of more than average prowess.
Cody's remarkable ride occurred at
the breaking out of the war declared
against the allied plains tribes during
the winter of 1868-69, in which cele
brated campaign General Sheridan took
the field In person, having such Indian
fighters as Sully and Ouster as his
principal lieutenants. Cody tells the
"story in excellent taste, and although I
was in active service at the same time,
and was cognizant of the, facts. I shall
quote fully from Cody's own version, as
published in his excellent autobiogra
phy. It was commenced on the day
on which Cody had his funny yet
rather tragic experience with Santata,
the war chief of the Kiowas, when Cody
"pulled the wool over the eyes" of the
wicked old savage regarding some cat
tle which had no existence in fact, crea
tures of Cody's fertile imagination, yet
the necessary lie was the means of sav
ing the famous scout's scalp. The
story will be found in full in the chap
ter of "Famous Men of the Trail," In
my "The Old Santa Fe Trail."
Cody says: "The commanding offi
cer at Fort Dodge was anxious to send
some dispatches to Fort Lamed, but
the scouts, like those at Fort Hays,
were rather backward in volunteering,
as it was considered a very dangerous
undertaking to make the trip. As Fort
Lamed was my post, and as I wanted
to go there anyhow, I said to Austin
that I would carry the dispatches, and
if any of the boys wished to go along
I would like to have them for com
pany. Austin reported my offer to the
commanding officer, who sent for me and
said he would be happy to have me tako
the dispatches, if I could stand the trip
on top of all that I had already done.
'All I want Is a good fresh horse, sir,'
I said.
" 'I am sorry to say that we haven't
a decent horse here; but we have a re
liable and honest government mule, if
that Avill do,' said the officer. 'Trot
out your mule," said I, 'that's good
enough for me. I'm ready at any time,
sir."
When the trip was finished I had rid
den from Fort Lamed to Fort Zarah,
sixty-five miles â there and back â in
twelve hours, which included the time
I was taken by the Indians across the
Arkansas. In the succeeding twelve
hours I had gone from Fort TTays to
Fort Dodge, thirty miles on horseback,
and thirty-five miles on foot, to Fort
Lamed. and the next night sixty-five
miles more to Fort Hays. Altogether I
had ridden and walked 355 miles in
fifty-eight hours, or an average of six
miles an hour. Of course, this may not
be regarded as very fast riding, but
taking into consideration the fact that
it was mostly done in the night and over
a wild country. with no roads to fol
low, and that I had to be continually on
the lookout for Indians, It was thought
at the time to be a big ride, as well as
a most dangerous one."

HIGHEST POINT
ON OUR
CONTINENT
AND THE
BIGGEST VOLCANO
IN AMERICA
is owned by U.S.
MT. WRANGELL, ALASKA, THE HIGHEST PEAK OND THE BIGGEST VOLCANO ON THE
AMERICAN CONTINENT.
No object has so much attracted the attention of the miners swarming up the Copper Biver
country as this huge apex of America. Not only is it the most titanic sight in that land, -where
nature builds giants with giant hands, but it is the heart and center of oceans of mountains around it.
Naturally the prospector thinks that may be, being the highest point, it is the point from which the
gold is washed down into the surrounding streams. That is the reason they fix their eyes longingly
upon it and plan to prospect its great sides. But no white man has ever yet set foot upon it, though
scores have tried. The Indians will not guide them there, because they believe it is bewitched. And
no man, unless properly provisioned? dare attempt to reach its desolate slopes. It is eternally robed
in snow from base to summit and from its ice-rimmed apex huge flame and billows of smoke con
stantly shoot up from the interior inferno. E. Hazard Wells, who has explored and surveyed over a
large part of Alaska, attempted to reach Mount Wrangell recently. Below will be found his story of
the trip.
NO white man has ever set foot
upon the apex of the North
American continent. That high
point is the crater of an active
volcano, the biggest on our con- j
tinent, and it all belongs to. Un- j
cle Sam. There is a point in Alaska j
where primeval nature, gathering to- j
gether all of its titanic energies, piled j
mountains one upon another, in chaotic
masses, surmounting the whole with a
giant volcano, robed in snow from base j
to summit and from whose ice-rimmed ,
nostrils now issue seething flames,
springing from an inferno beneath.
Mount Wrangell is the name applied
to the volcano. It was so named by the
early Russians in honor of Baron
Wrangell, at the time Governor of the j
territory by appointment of the Czar.
It is not a matter of record as to
whether or not the Baron ever caught
a glimpse of his towering namesake,
although the flaming summit can be
Men for a hundred miles across the
tempest-tossed region. It is known,
however, that up to the present day, no
white man has ever ascended the peak
or even placed foot upbn its base. It j
remains for some daring explorer who I
is willing to take his life in his hands i
to push boldly over the encircling j
mountain ridges and attempt the as- <
cent. Should he succeed, he will ac
complish a notable mountaineering
feat and will, no doubt, be able to add
much to geographical knowledge.
The Mount Wrangell region is to-day
one of the few on the North American
continent that has defied intrusion. To
add to its specific interest, the native
inhabitants of Central Alaska fear to
approach the locality, having, for some
reason, a mysterious dread of "fire
mountain" as they term it.
There is not an Indian to be found
within fifty miles of Mount Wrangell.
Not one will approach it any closer.
More interesting still is the fact that
Indian tradition, or more properly
speaking, wandering reports, state that
in the secluded region around Mount
Wrangell gigantic animals with curved
white tusks roam through the dark
forests. Every Indian will tell you this
story and warn you away from the lo
cality, saying that it is "no good" and
that you will surely perish if you at
tempt to enter.
It should be stated here that Mount
Wrangell is located near the head of
Copper River, from which point of
vantage it can be. seen about forty
miles to the eastward, rising up behind
successive ridges of lofty mountains.
Apparently it is not practicable to ap
proach the volcano from this direction.
' During the present summer hundreds
of gold seekers pushing up the Copper
River have, no doubt, sighted the peak
and have marveled at its altitude. Still,
it seems highly improbable that any
one of them has had the temerity to
attempt to cross the intervening moun
tains and try to make an ascent with
out ice axes and other proper climbing
equipment. The scaling of the Matter
horn in Europe is undoubtedly an easier
undertaking than the scaling of Mount
Wrangell.
According to reports coming from
Copper River, most of the prospectors
are turning back, disheartened and dis
couraged with the prospect before them,
and but few have persevered and push
ed on toward the headwaters. It is the
fair presumption that these men will
suffer great hardships and will be lucky
if they escape starvation, as the re
gion supplies no food In the summer
months. I speak from personal knowl
edge. Should these adventurers suc
ceed, however, in pressing on, they will
find the only practicable route through
the mountains to He in the direction of
the Tanana RivÂ«r, by way of the Lake
Mentasta or the Lake Susiota passes.
These courses will take them to the
westward of Mount Wrangell. Should
some of them double back from the
Tanana, following a southeasterly
course, then it may be possible for them
to reach the great volcano, as that is
the only apparent avenue for success
ful approach.
No man who has ever gazed from a
distance upon the claud-piercing sum
mit of Mount Wrangell will be apt to
dispute its sovereignty as the loftiest
upon the North American continent.
True, it has not been measured, but
triangulation, or the aneroid and the
boiling point thermc-meter, are not nec
essary to form a correct conclusion. At
the present time the few authorities in
the country concede pre-eminence to
Mount Wrangell over Mount St. Elias.
It is a cu.se of the giant and the ordi
nary man standing before one. There
is no need tor the measuring tape.
It was my fortune in 1890 to attempt
to reach Mount Wrangell. No white
man had tried it previously. The early
Russians had been content to look upon
the baron's namesake from the lower
Copper River. Seventeen of them un
der Seberinoffski had paid for their
temerity in doirg even this back in the
sixties. The Copper River natives had
massacred the entire party. Later, in
ISBS, Lieutenant Allen had pushed up
the Copper, despite great difficulties,
and had crossed to the Tanana River,
sighting Mount Wrangell from a dis
tance approximately of forty miles, but
had made no attempt to reach the vol
cano. The lieutenant, with his party of
two men, barely escaped starvation.
From that time up to 1890 no one tried
to penetrate the region toward Wran
gell.
When in the summer of '90 I started
with two white men and an Indian from
Forty-mile Creek on the Yukon, tramp
ing overland toward the far-distant
volcano, I little dreamed of the start
ling adventures that were soon to be
fall us. We carried our slender stock
of provisions upon our backs and had
no shelter save a square piece of mus
lin to spread over our heads in case of
a storm. Altogether we had about
thirty pounds of provisions to the man,
but were hopeful that our two rifles
and shotgun would be efficient to avert
starvation. Some risk we expected, but
not such as did befall.
Three weeks of wearisome tramping
and mc.ntain climbing took us across
the Tanana and well into the dark, for
bidding mountains that form the outer
barriers of the Mount Wrangell region.
Our provisions became exhausted. Lit
tle game in the way of rabbits and
grouse could be secured. Our scant
meals had fallen from two to one per
day. Then came a time when there
was nothing! Mountains enclosed us
in their gloomy silence. In the valley
of the Tokio, up which we slowly
pushed, nature ceemed to mock us!
Balmy breezes played through the
evergreens. Insects hummed on every
side. The sun smiled down from above,
bringing us no cheer. We, human
creatures, hungered and starved!
Never shall I forget those days of dire
distress! Here and there we found the
tracks of moose and large bears. The
country seemed to be infested with the
brutes, judging from the number of
tracks we saw at various points. Once
I kneeled down upon the sand on the
bank of the Tokio and measured prints
thirteen inches across. Only a monster
could have made them. Still we saw
no signs of the immediate presence of
the animals. No doubt they had been
driven up into the higher ranges of
the mountains by the terrible mosqui
toes. The swarms of these little pests
made us almost frantic. They kept up
their attacks by day as well as by
night.
In front of us the country rose
steeply. Immense glaciers appeared.
The perspective was grand and appall
ing. The tempest-tossed ranges, mass
ing toward the zenith, seemed to lose
themselves in the very heavens. Cold,
steel-colored clouds rode down upon
the north winds in darkening masses.
There was a portent in the air.
It was one August evening that wit
nessed the eating of our last batch of
bread. We cooked the dough in our
frying pan while resting upon the
mountain side. Ahead of us lay an un
known region. Behind lay a trading
post three hundred miles distant in ajn
air line. Between were mountains, ra
vines and swamps. We dared not at
tempt to go back and we could not go
forward. The great volcano was dl
i rectly in our front, not fifty miles

away. So near and yet so very far. To
attempt to reach and scale it with no
food and scarcely any equipment, even
blankets, was sheer madness. And yet
we were loth to give up the attempt.
We had come so far and had suffered
so much.
A caucus was held upon the moun
tain side. Up to this time I had di
rected the movements of the party, but
now it seemed right that every man
should have his vote and that the ma
jority should decide.
Frank Price, the Arctic sailor of the
little band, whose great strength had
pushed us through many a tight place
in the days gone by, declared that "the
jig was up." Frank thought of his
home and friends in Oakland, Cal., and
it was evident that he never expected
to see them any more. De Hass, the
old mountaineer of the party, who had
spent his life in the Rockies, muttered
something under his breath about the
present "lack even of a wooden over
coat," which did not serve in any way
to raise our spirits.
The old Chilkat "Indiaunk," who
had been with me for many months and
who was always brave and courage
ous, said briefly: "No good. No get
back home any more!" Usually bright
and of talkative disposition, he was
now gloomy and taciturn. It was a
lugubrious crowd that night upon the
mountain, and few were the hours that
any of us slept. What of the morrow?
was the haunting question.
Next day a band of sheep appeared
upon the mountain crest above us.
There was Intense excitement in the
camp. Even the old Indian lost his
self-possession and let off a subduod
whoop. Could we get the sheep we
could dry the meat and press on for
Mount Wrangell! The possibility was
alluring. De Hass and myself, as the
supposed best shots in the party, under
took to ascend the mountain on the
far side and rising over the crest, shoot
down upon our intended victims.
Weak from lack of food, but buoyed
up by the excitement, we scaled the
mountain with slow steps and infinite
pain and difficulty. It took us nearly
half a day, but the quarry waited. With
trembling hands we pointed the two
guns over the top of the rocks and
fired.
Both missed! The sheep bounded
away down the declivity and were soon
lost to view. Blankly De Hass and I
looked at each other. Then, as the
realization of what our failure meant
came over us, we started silently down
the mountain for our camp, stumbling
recklessly over rocks and bushes, care
less of what happened. Long after dark
we reached the campflre and found
Price and the old Indian eagerly ex
pecting our appearance with meat. The
disappointment was grievous. I could
not help feeling for them, even despite
the weight of my own personal suffer
ing.
A small unknown, uncharted stream
flowed past the camp. It issued from
the mountains in the direction of
Mount Wrangell and from its trend
we suspected it to be the Tokio, which
we had deserted several days previous
ly for a direct course over the
mountains. It was determined to build
a small raft and trust ourselves to the
mercies of the waters, knowing that
the flow would be toward larger waters
and ultimately to the sea. A few taste
less roots, which the Indian dug, fur
nished our only breakfast.
While the other men were busy get
ting small dry logs into the water, I
took the shotgun and went out among
the spruces, being so fortunate as to
secure two grouse and a red squirrel.
These gave us a much needed repast.
Fastening our logs together, we drifted
off down the stream. So far I have
not mentioned one of the memebrs of
the partyâ a faithful, lean four-footed
friend, our Siwash dog. Ido not like
to think of him even now. Poor fel
low. It seemed like cannibalism, but
we ate him! There was nothing else
to do. For days we had contemplated
the distressing possibility and had
shrunk from it. Even the old Chilkat
didn't want to eat dog.
We came to it and for three daya
got nothing else as we floated down
the stream, which we found was ln
deed the Tokio. At one point we blazed
the side of a tree and wrote our
names and residences upon it. We did
not want to perish and leave no record
behind.
After the dog meat gave out we made
a final soup of the bones and then
drifted on with nothing to appease
hunger. Two days passed without
food and then, to our great Joy, we
found Indians.
The rest was easy. They treated us
well and helped us to the next village
on the Tanana. On and on we went,
living with the natives and subsisting
on unsalted fish for nearly a month.
It grew nauseating, but it was better
than no food. Finally we rafted down
to the Yukon and reached the trading
post of Nuklakyet, fully 800 miles from
the place where we had eaten our poor
dog. How good the first meal at a
white man's table tasted and how sick
we were afterward ! Later we reached
St. Michael and sailed for home. It
was many months, however, before
eeveral members of thÂ« party fully re
covered from the terrible strain of the
adventure.
Do I still want to visit Mount Wran
gell? Yes and no. If a way to carry
supplies of food could be devised, yet,
with all my heart. If no food and the
old game over again, then emphati
cally no. One experience with starva

INDIANS THOUGHT SHE WAS A SUPERNATURAL BEING.
Mrs. A. C. Ountner has just died at the hospital here from wounds which she received in a Ute
Indian uprising some fifteen years ago. The story of her heroic fight for her children and her
terrible sufferings while trying to escape from the Indians is told below.
A FEW days ago a woman died in
one of the wards of the Chil
dren's Hospital, and though few
of those about her knew it her
untimely end was brought about
by an atrocious Indian massacre.
The woman's name was Mrs. Mar
garet Gunthner. She was brought to
the hospital to submit to an operation
made necessary by the old wounds re
ceived at the hands of the bloodthirsty
Utes.
In the fall of 1884 A. C. Gunthner.
with his wife and four childrenâ two
boys and two girls â moved to a home
stead in the Montezuma Valley, in
Southeastern Colorado. The place was
fifty miles from the Ute reservation.
The Gunthners did not dream that
there was any danger from the Indians.
Throughout the autumn and winter
the family made improvements and in
the spring their substantial two-story
cottage was surrounded by waving
corn fields. One June night the trag
edy occurred which ruined the prosper
ous home, robbed the children of a
father and nearly destroyed the
mother. A short time before this fatal
night several cowboys and Indians had
a row. Six of the Indians were killed.
As is the custom with the redskins,
after burying their dead they doggedly
took to the warpath and never rested
till a like number of whites had been
killed and so balanced the tally of an
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
The Gunthners had Just gone to bed
when flames were discovered sweeping
up the side of the house. The husband
ran outside to try to save his home.
His wife hastened to help him. At that
instant the spiteful crack of rifles was
heard.
Gunthner shouted to his wife to save
the children, and then, fell pierced by
bullets.
As Mrs. Gunthner turned toward the
door a bullet smashed into her right
shoulder, shattering the bones and ter
ribly lacerating the flesh.
The brave woman, however, did not
fall, but braced herself agnlnst the
house. This act alone saved herself and

It is my belief that gigantic bears
and perhaps other large quadrupeds
haunt the dark defiles around Mount

her children from a more horrible fate.
The superstitious Utes, seeing her
standing, clothed all in white, and
knowing that she had been hit. believed
her to be a supernatural being, and
were afraid to approach her.
The courageous woman managed to<
get inside her burning home. She
roused her children, and. taking her
eight-months-old baby in her left arm,
with her torn and broken right arm
dangling, she led the way from her
ruined home and dead husband out into
the night.
For three long hours she and her chil
dren hunted for assistance. At last
they reached the cabin of a half-witted
fellow. Then they discovered to their
horror that the Indians had already
been there. The place was deserted.
They searched around in the darkness
for clothes to tie up the wounded
shoulder, and cut their feet badly on
the broken window-glass which strewed
the floor.
Leaving the cabin, Mrs. Gunthner
and her children started again on their
desolate journey. A few rods from the
house they stumbled on the body of the
owner, wrapped in a blanket, under a
sage bush. At first they thought he was
dead, but he proved to be alive. He had
heard the coming Indians and had hid
from them in the brush. M.-s. Gunthner
forced him to tear his blanket into
strips and bind her shattered arm to
her body. The man then led the way to
the nearest farm house, which was
reached at daybreak.
The doctor was sent for immediately.
He looked at the woman and told Mrs.
Gunthner that if she had any bus'ness
that needed attention It had best be fin
ished at once, for the chances of her re
covery were one in a thousand.
â¢ "I must live for my children, and I
will," replied Mrs. Gunthner, simply.
She did live, and, coming to Califor
nia, she made a comfortable home for
herself and children. For years she re
sided in Hanford. The bones in her
arm, however, had been leaded, and ?n
a few years began to pain her. As time
passed it was found necessary to re
move a piece of the bone. In the course
of time several more operations were
performed without success, and as a
last resort Mrs. Gunthner was sent to
the hospital In San Francisco. The sur
geons decided to amputate her arm.
The operation proved too great a shock
for her. And so, after bearing up for

FINAL PROOF OF OWNERSHIP.
In an Eastern county court the Judge
was in a quandary the other day. A
coat was in dispute. The parties were
Irish and the evidence was direct and
positive for bath claimants. After
much wrangling, Patrick Peters, one
of the parties, proposed that he and his
opponent, Timothy Magulre, should see
whose name was on the coat. Tim
othy searched in vain and the coat
was handed to Pat, who immediately
took his knife, opened a corner of the
collar of the coat, and out dropped
two Bmall peas.
"A dale it 'as to do wld it! It is my
name, to be sure â pea foi* Patrick and

He got the coat after that.

A striking instance of the fierce and

world Is grown. Most of the tobacco
lands, however, are taken up. and the
little that is left is altogether too ex
pensive for any but the largest corpor
ations to develop. There are some
chances to start on a small scale in
certain sections, where a low grade of
tobacco is raised. But, in this business
and the sugar industry considerable
knowledge is necessary to avoid failure.
"Perhaps the industry third in im
portance is furnished by the timber
lands. In the east there are vast tra*t*
of forest that have never been touched. ,
The suicidal policy of the Spanish Gov
ernment was never better shown than
here. Little attempt has been made to
reach and market these woods. T&e
roads are few, and in many parts al
most useless. There are large quanti
ties of pine, mahogany, cedar, lignum
vitae, logwood and some 40 more vari
eties. And this land once cleared makes
a fertile soil for sugar, coffee and cocoa.
"The mineral deposits of Cuba are
more important than is generally ap
preciated. But little progress has been
made in exploring the rich deposits in
the east, owing to the heavy duties im
posed by the Spanish Government.
There are iron mines, manganese, coal,
copper and tin properties. The chances
for a large corporation to exploit these
properties are excellent, and rich re
turns can be made by such enterprises.
Of course in this industry and the lum
ber business there whould be but little
chance for a man with limited means.
"There are numerous other indus-Â«
tries; the coffee business is profitable,
but it requires three years of waiting
before It yields any return; the cocoa
business and the raising of cattle are
good money makers, and require only a
moderate amount of money upon which
to start. For the man of small means
there are perhaps better opportunities
In the raising of fruit, the cocoanut In
dustry and the regular lines of trade
that are found in every city of Amer
icaâthe hardware, grocery and provis
ion business. The ranks of retail trade
are by no means filled in most Cuban
cities.
"I ought to speak of the climate,
which is, with careful personal precau
tions, better than some of the Southern
States; of the boom in city real estate,
of the future possibilities of a tourist
season in Havana, Matanzas and the
Yumuri, and of the universality which
the English language will obtain.
"Yes, I should most decidedly encour
age the young man with some means to
go to Cuba, but he must be strong and
self-reliant in character; he must be
ready to overcome difficulties; he must
have intelligence, ambition and econ
omy or he will fail in Cuba as he will
anywhere else. That country will not
be a paradise for the lazy and the care
less. The Cubans will welcome the
Americans with open arms. There i 3
room for many more people there, and
only large additions of able men will
bring out the immense resources that
are now lying dormant along the whole
length of the island."
Mr. Fidel G. Fierret, the former sec
retary of the Pan-American Congress,
who has been engaged for thirty years
in business enterprises connected with
Cuba, says, by way of advice:
"In Cuba almost everything is to be
done. It is utterly impossible at thia
moment to define the thousand and one
things which it will be necessary to do
and tell the ones which must be done
first. ThÂ© country is completely de
vastated; we do not know what part of.
the population will be left to take up
the work of nation building. Outside of
the large cities where the Spaniards
held control, all the small industries
must be re-established. The commercial
machinery for the supply of food, of
clothing and of all the first necessities
of life must be started and at once. The
farmhouses, sheds, barns, and such
buildings in more than half of Cuba
have been completely destroyed and the
work of rebuilding them will take a
number of years. Along with this there
will be the chance of putting in the
newer American id^as in the lighting of
the towns, the building of water
works, the supplying of modern hard
ware, and many kindred enterprises. In
all these industries there are chances
for the young American with limited
capital. On a larger scale the big mon
ey corporations of America will be de
pended upon to build railroads, to sup
ply trolley lines, telephones, telegraphs
and similar improvements. In fact,
there are so many medieval Spanish
ideas that will have to be replaced by
progressive American schemes that one
cannot state them offhand.
"There is an excellent chance for the
small investor in garden farming near
Havana, Matanzas and the larger
towns of the north. The soil is so won
derfully rich that large returns will re
sult from such enterprises as these.
The raising of sugar is out of the ques
tion for men of limited means, as the
capital required for this Industry is cer
tainly hundreds of thousands, and
oftentimes millions of dollars. In the
tobacco field, too, the chances are
slim for the small Investor. The more
fertile of the tobaco lands are very ex
pensive and are practically all of them
taken up now.
"I should advise any one who has
capital to invest to study well before
he embarks. There are many chances
for blunders. In the titles of lands, for
example, there are many peculiar de
tails that require the utmost vigilance
to prevent financial trouble. I think it
would be well for the man of limited
means to start in some of the smaller
Industries, such as garden farming or
groceries and provisions, and theni
watch for his opportunity to branch
out. I can't see that the language will
be a drawback. Americans will be go-

From a photograph taken at -.c time she bought the Lake County Farm.
MRS. LAXGTRY is going to sell
her big ranch in Lake County,
now that she has secured her
divorce.
The gossips say that the
Prince of Wales is again recog

the Lily ever returning to California to
make her abode. Freddy Gebhard has
so-ldÂ» the adjoining ranch which he
bought when Mrs. Langtry purchased
hers. What was once a much-talked-of

represented in big figures lost in in
. efficient management. Experts say
$100,000 would not cover what has been
sunk in the place; so the divorce easily
cost Lily that sum.
Lily Langtry was in her bloom when
the investment was made, and so was
Fred Gebhard. In the nine years that
â¢ have since ensued Mrs. Langtry has
largely withdrawn from her spectacular
International career, she and the Geb
hard have quarreled, and California,
save for the 4000 acres in Lake County,
is to all intents and purposes forgotten
by her. Doubtless the original outlook
of the horse-farming business was an
alluring one, but the course of time has
changed things and there is little re
maining of the Langtry-Gebhard
ranch to show that wealthy owners
ever possessed it or that it ever was
intended to make two horse-fanciers
noted on the turf. Gone are the thor
oughbreds, Jockeys, high livers and gay
people who spent money lavishly to
bring it fame and fortune.
All that is left on the Gebhard prop
erty is the uncared-for relic of a mile
racetrack, together with a stud-barii
and brood-mare barn, whose closed
doors and empty lofts stand in contrast
to the activities of earlier days.
Over on the Langtry farm is a poor,
lone coaching stallion, a handsome
1600-pound Cleveland bay, with nothing
to do but to eat, no one to love him,
and history rapidly slipping beyond his
grasp. He is an after-thought of the
'irief period when Mrs. Langtry ap
peared to be making one final effort to
maintain the equine aspect of the
property.
Outside of these two features there is
nothing characteristic or indicative of
the owners first purposes.
No one seems to know Just why Mrs.
Langtry bought a ranch in Lake
County. . 'There are other sections of
California where the railroad facilities
and the social environs would seem far
better adapted to the preferences and
Idiosyncrasies of the most noted beauty
of her day. Lake County had had no
reputation as a breeder of fine horses,
although since the Langtry-Gebhard
establishment was inaugurated it has
shown certain superior qualifications in
that respect. Neither Mrs. Langtry nor
Freddy Gebhard saw the property be
fore they made their purchase; nor did
elrhti of them see it very often after
they had bought it. With boundless
faith in -~ents and mangers, this
London-New York couple made their
in\estment by proxy and managed it
by proxy.
The story goes that Mrs. Langtry and
the Gebhard, on the occasion of a
visit to California, were made the
guests of Lucky Baldwin at that gen
tleman's famous stock farm. At that
time Baldwin was making fortunes and
attracting national attention in turf
winnings. He had horses the sight of
which was sufficient to allure any one
who happened to have the least leaning
toward stock breeding. Besides, he had
a horse overseer and trainer, "Doc"
Abbey, who was "onto his job." The
Langtry and the Gebhard fell under
the overseer's guidance. He understood
his patients. And, so the story goes,
there was nothing that was right and
glorious and fascinating on the Bald
win farm that was not "raciously and
touchingly exhibited to the distin
guished visitors. They were easily
smitten. A proposition for a stock farm
of their own was quickly formed, and
"Doc" Abbey was commissioned to see
that It should be made one of the great
est places of its kind on earth.
Aside from the consideration of iso
lation the commissioner certainly could
not have made a more ideal purchase.
Eight miles from Middletown, in the
heart of the beautiful, well inclosed
Guenoc Valley he found a number of
properties which could be united into
a grand farm of a little more than 7000
acres. A third of the property was rich
bottom land, another third of it was
hill and mountain grazing land, and
still another third was excellent fruit
land, fit for grapes and wine especially.
The pioneering had all been done;
housesâ not bad ones eitherâ were in
place; fences were up; a winery was in
operation; practically everything need
ed except barns and a race course was
ready for the proposed new occupants.
Whether or not Mrs. Langtry planned
at that time to use the ranch as a basis
for a divorce suit is not known. The
actual suit was not filed until some
years after the purchase. The horse
raising business was inaugurated as if
it were the sole purpose of the property
owners.
For a few years the combination ran
excellently. The Langtry-Gebhard
farm acquired some noted studs and
brood mares. It was brilliantly man
aged by the viceroy, "Doc Abbey, who
could spend quite as much money as
his erratic employers. Turfing became
a fad among the astonished farmers in
the vicinity and the joint stock farm
was dotted all over with little jockeys
flying about on thoroughbreds. A mile

racetrack was constructed and popping
champagne entertained the visitors, for
Abbey saw to it that any and all visi
tors who were acquainted with Mrs.
Lang try and Gebhard were royally en
tertained.
The first important improvements
were purchases of studs and brood
mares. Inasmuch as Mrs. Langtry had
expended the most mo^ey for land.
Freddy appears to have elected to
make the largest expenditures for
stock. He bought the now noted stall
ion St. Zavier, who has made a record
for himself in some of the Eastern
stables since his transfer from the Geb
hardt barn; the not-so-noted but
splendidly bred stallion Imported
Greenback, and the son, Owas, of the
celebrated stallion Iroquois. Mrs. Lang
try contributed the well-known stallion
Friar Tuck. Between twenty and
thftty brood mares were secured, most
of them from the best farms in Ken
tucky.
"With this four-footed start there was
opportunity for some good breeding
and eventually for some fine, appear
ances on the country's race tracks. By
mutual consent the barns and the race
course and the other essentials to busi
ness were concentrated on the Geb
hard lands. Rtsihle men, some of
whom in their pistol-covered glory can
be seen in the accompanying illustra
tion, were engaged, small boys, 'capped
with the Gebhard colors, were em
ployed as training Jockeys, and the
champagne was accumulated in the
cellars.
Many of those who were boys then
and are youths now got their first nick
names from "Doc" Abbey while they
were jockeying for him. Many a small
man's small change was dropped into
another man's palm over the training
contests on the mile race course. Fred
dy Gebhard sent his clubroom friends
from the East to "see my horses" out
in Lake County, and the entertainment
of none of these was neglected by the
assiduous viceroy. Freddy's friends
were frequently Mrs. Langtry's friends,
and the entertainment was, of course,
a joint responsibility.
There were gun "scraps" now and
then, and mishaps, and the other usual
accompaniments of prosperity. A por
tion of the Gebhard House was bored
full of holes in a vain endeavor to per
forate the body of "Indian Joe," an em
ploye with whom some of the white
men had disagreed.
A negro employed on the Langtry
homestead fell off a porch at an ele
vation of about four feet, landed with
his chin on a wire clothesline and cut
his black head nearly off.
Harry Alsop Borrowe, the now noted
dynamite pun operator of the Rough
Riders, was bested by a littl â¢ revolver
after a little altercation with one of the
horsemen of the ranch. He was visit
ing as Gebhard's guest at th 2 time.
There was some "horse luck/'^too.
Abbey went East to purchase horses.
He says he bought thirteen. He also,
says he loaded them on a train of thir
teen cars. The engine was No. 13, and
the train started on the 13th day of the
month. What happened is shown in the
illustration. Thirteen cars went over
the banks of the Potomac River, and
thirteen thoroughbred horses never
reached their destination in Lake Coun
ty. Thereafter Abbey is said never to
have eaten on the 13th day of any
month. ,
Yet, notwithstanding the grand
times" and the Jockeys and the home
race course, months went by and
months lengthened out into years with
out putting any of the stock of the
Langtry-Gebhard farm on the great
race tracks. With four splendid stal
lions and more than a score of the fin
est thoroughbred mares, there was
nothing afforded to give either Geb
hard or Mrs. Langtry the envied fame
of a horse raiser. Nothing tangible
seemed ever to reach either of the own
ers save bills. Year by year the Mils
enlarged. Even the liberal Gebhard at
last became discouraged, and he tight
ened his purse strings.
Then Abbey' became dissatisfied. He
wont East to confer with Freddy. The
manner in which he and Freddy came
back is a familiar story. It was a race
to see which could first reach the ac
count books.
As the story was told at the time,
Gabhard claimed that Abbey was in
debted to the ranch in the sum
of about $12,000. Abbey did not
see things that way. He presented a
bill of from $6000 to $8000 against Fred
dy. The outcome of the contest is some
what smothered in the subsequent mix
up, but Abbey no longer continued as
superintendent of the Gebhard stock
farm.
Meanwhile Mrs. Langtry also be
came discouraged. She refused point
blank to lay out more money upon the
profitless stock farm. Abbey's only re
course was to refuse to work the farm
and this he did.
For a little while the broad, sun
shiny, rich-soiled acres lay in the sun
and the rain and soaked and baked.
They might have been there indefinite
ly without tilling but for the foresight
of a Lake County rancher who knew
his business. Frank Smythe, now
Supervisor and one of the few suc
cessful Democratic politicians in the
county, sized up the land and offered
to put in a crop. Abbey disclaimed au
thority and told Smythe to do as he
pleased. Smythe did so.
A few months later Mrs. Langtry
had a new agent on the property, a
young and fulsome Britisher, whom
many people of San Francisco prob
ably remember, A. G. P. McNulty.
McNalty asked Smythe* for his .iu
thorlty for placing the crop. Smythe
confessed that he had none. McNnlty
inquired as to who would get the crop.
Smythe laconically remarked that
probably the man who cut it would get
it. McNalty decided to adjust things
that way. Smythe gave up a portion
of the crop as rental. And thus, for
the first time in five years, Mrs. Lang
try's investment of over $100,000 yielded
her a revenue.
With the termination of the Abbey
regime had come the termination of
the horse and stock breeding. Geb
hard had already begun to sell off his
best animals. Langtry's coursers went
by the board also. The big property
changed from a horse farm to a grain
farm. The romantic notions of 1889
were metamorphosed into the busi
ness conditions and necessities of 1894.
McNalty remained as Mrs. Langtry's
representative for a couple of seasons.
He wanted the farm run on British
principles, but British principles are
fundamentally financial, whereas the
principles of the Langtry farm were
now required to be economical. Re
luctantly he allowed Mr. Smythe to
cultivate the property on shares, and
quite as gladly he absorbed all the
money that the industrious Mr. Smythe
could harvest. Mrs. Langtry got lit
tle benefit of the change. It was he
who purchased the useless big Cleve
land bay stallion, which is now on the
property.
The situation was disheartening. Any
woman who was not seeking a divorce
would undoubtedly have relinquished
GRAY DON'S DESTROYER
THK boast of Tesla that he could
devise an engine of war capable
of blowing an enemy's ship out
of the water at the first attempt
may be true and would not be at
all singular. For. even if true. Tesla
would have to yield precedence to one
who has not only invented but had pat
ented such a powerful device.
This wonderfully destructive agency
was born in the fertile brain of ex-
Lieutenant. Graydon of the United
States navy, and was given a most
thorough and satisfactory test in the
summer of ISB6 before a number of
press representatives of this city and
a few capitalists who were desirous to
control its manufacture.
Graydon, who had resigned from the
United States navy to enter the Chinese
service during the Franco-Tonquin
war, had at that time but re
cently returned to this coun-
V.j laden with honors and wealth,
and though his money soon melted like
fog before the rising sun, he still re
tained his great prestige as a military
genius.
Then, as now, the only method in use
for the discharge of dynamite-laden
shells was the use of compressed air in
"pneumatic guns"â a mode which lim
its the throwing capacity to a few
miles and reduces to the lowest mini
mum the possibility of hitting the ob
ject aimed at, providing one can be said
to "aim" at anything by pointing a gun
in the air at an angle of 45 degrees.
For the scene of the experiments a
quarry at Lake Temescal, in Alameda
County, was choren, and thither went
Graydon and his guests one bright
summer morning.
On arriving at the scene there were
found a number of targets, each com
posed of a series of layers of two-inch
oak planksâ the alternate layers of
plan! s being crossed to prevent split
ting.
The "o'un" was an improvised one
and of the simplest pattern, being noth
ing more complicated than a bar of
Swedish steel with an inch and a half
bore.
The dynamite was then prepared by
Graydon in the presence of the assem
blage â which included an expert on ex
plosives â sec -ecy bein maintained only
as to the character of the last ingredi
ent added.
The gun was charged through the
muzzle with a pound and a half of

the burden at whatever cost. But to
Mrs. Langtry at this particular season
a divorce probably appeared to have no
small value. She made one more ef
fort fo do something with her lands.
She placed her divorce affairs and her
land affairs in Jhe same bands, namely
with Attorney McPike. "^"ithin another
year she not only had her divorce but
was making some money out of her one
time stock farm.
The successful Smythe leased the en
tire ranch at a cash rental, bought all
that remained of the Langtry working
stock except the ridiculous piece of
horse investment made by McNalty,
I black powder and on top o that was
I placed one of the dynamite cartridges,
the lieutenant ramming it home with a
careless vigor that caused a hurried
remonstrance from the now nervous
onlookers.
The target set up at a distance of a
couple of hundred feet and the gun
pointed the lieutenant politely offered
to the leading capiv^list the proud
privilege of firing the first shot. The
offer was graciously but firmly de
clined. In turn all tl.e invl 3d members
of the party declined such prominence
in the cere. ny. The matter was
finally compro ised by the visitors
taking shelter behind a convenient cliff
in the rear of the gun, while the lieu
tenant himself pulled the forty-yards
long lanyar L
There was a loud report as the gun
was discharged, followed instantly by
a terrible crash as the cartridge struck
the target.
A quick rush to Inspect the target
disclosed the fact that it had completely
disappeared, a disappearance which
was only accounted for by the subse
quent discovery that for a few hundred
yards around the ground was strewn
with splinters hardly large enough for
toothr>h-Vs. The gu was not injured in
the slightest.
Another target was set up, the
charge of powder increased to two
pounds. a larger cartridge again
rammed home, and the lanyard again
pulled by the lieutenant. The second
target met the fate of the first.
Target after target was demolished
until the supply was exhausted. Then
the lieutenant used his surplus of cart
ridges by firing them into a bank of
earth, each discharge bringing down
tons of rock and clay.
ThÂ« test finished, the delighted cap
italists hurried back to this city to per
fect a close corporation to take control
of the patent and perfect plans for sell
ing it to the Government at a price way
up in the millions.
The lieutenant, however, did not re
turn to the city with the capitalists.
Instead, he insisted on the reporters
accompanying him to a Temescal cafe,
where he had previously arranged for
refreshments. Perhaps it was a warm
day; anyhow, the lieutenant seemed to
drink a good deal.
This trait in the lieutenant's make
up became soon apparent to the mem
bers of the newly formed corporation.
Meeting after meeting was called by
the directors, only to adjourn without
result. Remonstrances were in vain.
At last the crash came. At a meeting
the Cleveland bay stallion Redlngton
Prior.
In the meanwhile Gebhard lost all
interest in his 3000 acres and by a lucky
turn rid himself of it to A. B. McCreary
of San Francisco. How much he lost
no one knows but himself. Local resi
dents estimate that deterioration in
value of the property alone at $20,000.
The line that formerly was only an
imaginary one between his property
and that of Mrs. Langtry took shape in
a stout fence.
That was in 1897. In 1898 came the
Langtry divorce and everything was
changed.
J And Its Effect on
\ Certain Local Capitalists.
[ of the directors the lieutenant was ln
! formed that his associates had become
j tired of his actions, and as they be
lieved they had the secret they pro
posed to get along without him.
Then the lion in his breast awoke,
and raising himself to his full height
of about 5 feet 4 inches, the lieutenant
shook his list defiantly at his asso
ciates and cried out:
"You think you can do without me,
do you? Well, d you, I've got my
discovery patented, and you can all go
to hades!"
The board realizea that it was with
out standing, and a motion to disincor
porate was sadly but unanimously car
ried. Of this board Charles "Webb
Howard of the Spring Valley Water
Company was the president, General
W. H. L. Barnes was legal adviser,
while Mr. Roller, the well known ex
pert on explosives, was to be superin
tendent, under the direction, of course,
of Graydon.
A few days ago I called Mr. Howard's
thoughts back to the time when he and
his associates were enjoying great ex
pectations, and though Mr. Howard
smiled at the recollection, it was a sad
smile, as he remarked: "I lost some
money in it; I lost some money in it."
When Graydon was leaving for the
East he declared that either our Gov
ernment would purchase his patent or
it would lie barren, for in no event
would he place such an awful weapon
in the possession of a foreign power.
He evidently meant what he said at
that time, but it is said that recently
he has been giving some experiments
in the same line before the Russian
military officials. Perhaps it would be
as well for some of our officials at the
War Office in Washington to step over
to the Patent Office and ascertain if the
invention is filed there. If such should
prove to be the case it would be the
part of wisdom for our officers to util
ize the patent - nd then p Graydon a
reward commensurate with the value
of his discovery.

OMAHA, Aug. 26.â Away down in
a little hollow on the bluff tract
stands a red building with a
forest of slender smokestacks.
An unobtrusive placard an

tolls the captive genius that works the
greatest magic of the century; but the
placard merely says: "Power-house,
Visitors are invited."
Yet one may spend a wonderful half
hour here amid the dynamos. The
electrical display of the Trans-Missis
sippi Exposition is far beyond any ever
given in this country, probably in any
country. The electrical appliances In
the electricity building are only a part
of the wonder. The lighting of the
grounds shows what electricity can do
to turn night into day. It is more
brilliant than the most brilliant boul
evard of Paris; but there is nothing
of the harsh dazzle nor the inky
shadows of the ordinary electric light
ing. At the World's Fair there were
no half tones, the exquisite graduation
of sunlight, the softened olives and
violets of moonlight were lost; one
was bathed in light and suddenly one
stepped into darkness. Here, the ten
thousand incandescent lights preserve
the transparency of the shadows, pro
ducing a thousand exquisite effects.
To try to "do" the exposition in a
day is a wearying mockery. One could
easily spend a day in the Government,
or the Liberal Arts, or the Electricity,
or the Mines and Mining buildings.
"Doing," in this sense, usually means a
tramp or ride in a chair or jinricksha
around the lagoon, across the bridge to
the plaza, down past the painted gro
tesqueries of the Midway Jo the State
buildings, a little loitering in the wide
lawns amid the splendid parterres and
the riot of color in plant and flower
which surrounds the beautiful Horti
cultural building, stateliest palace of
them all; then a dip into the Midway
on the other side, a return to the la
goon and an excursion into one or two
buildings with eyes and brains equally
dazed and satiated. The real way to
have either pleasure or profit in an ex
position is to know what one wishes
to see, and go to see it. Thfe clamor
ing attractions on either side are not
to be regarded. A leisurely morning
spent in one building, a leisurely ride
for an afternoon, resting on the settees
which are placed at convenient dis
tances (at least in theory, in practice I
foun,d them too much like the police
man â always in evidence when not
needed and apparently in another
world when sorely wanted!), then a
dinner on the roof garden near the
plaza, whence floats the Bound of mu

a day that does not greatly weary
either mind or body, but it leaves its
IRISHMEN WHO HAVE MADE A NAME IN HISTORY.
NO other nation of modern times
has given of her best blood to
the upbuilding of other countries
to the extent that has Ireland.
For years her city, town and
country population has been de
pleted by immigration. To whatever
country they might emigrate Irishmen
have always taken an active part in
the affairs of state, and to-day noted
sons of Erin are in power the world
over. The Irish fair in this city draws
attention to this subject locally.
In support of this I need but to men
tion the part played by Irishmen in the
War of the Rebellion. The names of
Irishmen who were prominent both in
politics and in high office in the army
are too well known to need repeating.
However, there is one fact fading from
memory, and that is the important part
played by Irishmen in the War of the
Revolution.
The country had to be prepared by
tongue and pen before the lirst blow
could be struck for the physical en
forcement of the new idea. Even when
the fight for independence had been
waged and won, laws and constitu
tions had to be framed to suit the new
situation. In all this preliminary and
subsequent movement for independence
Ireland furnished the most distin
guished leaders. Take the pulpit for

particularly Presbyterians, were early

Of all the State buildings, the log

vtijr tastefully, and the receiving
room has a great stone chimney
wherein almost a forest might blaze, a
floor of ax-planed logs and tables, set
tees and easy chairs framed of tree
limbs in an ingenious fashion, which
surpasses the rustic furniture of parks.
The building is lighted with acetylene
gas. I observed several farmers in
quiring concerning this gas of a
ready-tongued young man who stood
in a little room with the cylinders,
otherwise, I suppose, "the plant." Is

All through the deliberations of the
Continental Congress the Irish contin
gent was numerous and powerful and
when the country seemed doomed to
destruction for want of a weil ordered
Government and when the convention
was called to form a new constitution
i Ireland furnished its wise and powerful
I counselors. New Jersey sent her Gov
j ernor, William Livingstone, a native of
New York and a descendant of John
Livingstone, the noted Irish Presby
terian preacher. The same State sent
William Patterson who was born at
sea on the passage of his parents from
Ireland. He was the author of the New
Jersey plan in that convention, involv
ing state rights. He was several times
a member of Congress, United States
Senator, Governor of New Jersey and
Judge of the Supreme Court of the
United States. Pennsylvania sent
Thomas Fitzsimmons, the great finan
cier, who was born in Ireland and came
here about the age of 25. He was an
extensive shipping merchant, in partner
ship with George Meade, the grand
father of General George G. Meade,
who commanded the Union Army at
Gettysburg. Meade and Fitzsimmons
â¢were both Irishmen and Catholics.
Delaware sent George Read, who was
one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence. He was a native of
Maryland. His father was a wealthy
citizen of Dublin. Maryland sent

sent Pierce Butler. He was born in
Ireland, was the third son of Sir
Richard Butler, fifth Baronet, and took
a prominent part in .the proceedings
and debates of the convention.
The Butler family of Pennsylvania
was a noted brotherhood of American
heroes and patriots. Richard Butler,
the oldest of the five brothers, was
born in Ireland. He distinguished him

was killed in battle at St. Clair's de

thanks of Wayne on the field of Mrm
mouth and of Washington at Brandy

guished themselves on many a bloody

Butler of Kentucky, was chief in com
mand of our Mexican army at the close
of the war with Mexico, succeeding
General Winfield ScÂ«tt, and was Demo

parents in Virginia, commanding at

SOME OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT ARE BEING SENT OVER THE WIRES DIRECT TO THE EARS OF ELECTROPHONE SUBSCRIBERS
BIG DYNAMITE SHELLS
DISCHARGED BY GUNPOWDER.
EVERY piece of artillery in serv
ice can be made a dynamite gun.
This astounding proposition is
made possible by a, process-,in
vented by Willard S. Isham of
â  â¢. . the City of Mexico, by which
. shells charged with dynamite may be
â¢ safely discharged from a gun by means
â of gunpowder, the shell bursting by im
. pact or by a time fuse.
Mr. Isham recently placed his inven
.-" tion before the Army. and Navy Ord
nance bureaus, asking permission to
give tests at the Government proving
grounds. At first the ordnance ex
. perts were rather skeptical, but after
a thorough examination of the process
Captain O'Neil. chief of the Ordnance
Bureau, said, that he believed it would
work successfully. All the ordnance
. experts agree that Isham has accom
' piishea something that no one else has
, done.
A test of the invention v. ill be made
at Sandy Hook as soon as possible, and
if successful may be adopted by the
Government. Two successful tests were
made in Mexico, and, in a letter, to
Secretary Alger, United States Minister
General Powell Clayton writes:
"Mr. Isham, under the auspices of the
War Department here, has made two
tests of his: invention, the latter of
which was witnessed . by President

What was to be done? All

course, could come to his room.
but even this was not at all
times desirable.
As usual, necessity produced
the man. This was a young
fellow who knew all about tel
ephones, and he easily rigged
up an apparatus connecting
the Prince's apartments with
Albert Hall. The result was
most gratifying, and His
Royal Highness lay back on
his pillows and enjoyed the
music to the utmost. He
heard it as plainly as if he
were in the hall.
Being able to gratify every
want that ran be gratified, the
Prince naturally was not sat
isfied with only the perform
ance In Albert Hall. He cried
for more, and it was not long
before the sickroom was con
nected with all the principal
houses of amusement in Lon
don, as well as with a number
of churches for their Sunday
sermons.

The gun used was a smooth bore; cali
ber 8 inches, length 9 feet 2 inches,
length of bore 8 feet o inches and
wight 3*i tons. The gun was dis
mounted and buried in the clay bank
of the ravine in which it was dis
charged.
"The charge was fifteen pounds of
black powder, the projectile of the
diameter of the piece, cylindrical in
form, 20 inches in length, of cast iron,
and weighing 143 pounds, in addition to
the seventeen pounds of dynamite it
contained. It was discharged by means

As soon as the plan had
proved a success the telephone
company naturally began to
make arrangements to let the
public enjoy It as well as the
Prince. This was not a diffi
cult matter, as the apparatus
Is very simple, the only es
sential being that those desir
ing the music and sermons
had to be subscribers to the
regular telephone service.
As for cost, that is within
th<* reach of people of moder
ate means. The regular tele
phone service costs about JoO
a year. The music and ser
mons also cost $50 a year,
making a total of $100. Not
very much when the amount
of pleasure and convenience is
considered.
For want of a better name
this apparatus has been chris
tened the "electrophone." It
is a very simple device, and
does not interfere with the
regular telephone service ex
cept when one or both lines
are "busy." Of course th se
who want a special wire ior
theaters only can get it at a
little extra cost.
The wires used are the tele
phone wires. In the theater,
church or concert hall trans
mitters are placed in suitable
positions and connected with
central by a heavy wire.
These transmitters are sim
ply large cones for collecting
the sound waves with the
usual telephone diaphragm
transmitter in the end.
In the theaters and opera
houses the transmitters are
placed on the footlights* in the
most advantageous p siftl >ns.
In the churches it is neces
sary to have several. One is
placed In the pulpit, another
can be sent twelve or thirteen miles.
In all dynamite guns now in use com
pressed air is used to propel the projec
! tile, and the guns on the Vesuvius are
1 operated by pneumatic force.
" 'What do you claim for your inven
tion?' was asked of Mr. Isham, and he
said:
" 'It will supplant torpedoes and har
; bor mines, for one of these shells fired
from an 8-lnch gun would be more de
i structive than the Whitehead torpedo.
i The shell can be accurately aimed at
1 any desired mark, and on shipboard Its
range of effectiveness is six or seven
I miles, while the maximum range of the
torpedo is 800 yards.
" 'For coast defenses it will make of
our mortars the most powerful de
structive agents. Harbor mines can be
dispensed with, since the charge in the
shell is greater than that in the mines.
i And instead of exploding in the air or
i prematurely the shells can be made to
' hit a vessel accurately.
" 'The shell can be fired from any field
p) ecr , â t n fact, every cannon is a dyna
mite gun by this system. Its adapta
tion requires no change in the mechan
ism of the gun or in the powder charge.
The mechanism of the shell is such
that it can be tested before and after
loading with dynamite BO as to abso
lutely prevent an explosion within the
bore of the gun. My mathematical
demonstration bears out this state
rm-nt. Moreover, these shells can stand
three times the initial strain of the or
dinary dynamite shell now in use.' "
By experiments in Mexico Mr. Isham
' discovered that, with a velocity of 1200
feet per second, a dynamite shell trav
els about six fÂ»et. after contact with a
light plate, before an explosion actually
j occurs. Hence one of thsse shells is
capable of penetrating five or six inches
of a vessel's armor plate and then
bursting within,
Ordnance experts state that It 1b not
on the altar and another on
the chancel rail. In this in
stance some ingenuity was
necessary in order to conceal
the transmitters. In the Holy
Trinity Church this was ac
complished by putting the
transmitter into a box shaped
and decorated to look like a
Bible. Of course it is advan
tageous to get the transmit
ter as close to the preacher as
possible.
At the receiving end of the
wire is the private dwelling.
There is practically no change
in the instrument. A cap,
which is the terminating
point for two or more rubber
tubes, is screwed on to the
usual hand receiver. This is
then placed In a suitable
stand and the rubber tubes,
ea< h of which has one ear
piece, are placed in the ears.
All sound that strikes the
transmitter Is distinctly heard
by everybody who has a pair
of the ear tubes. Similar ear
tubes are used In the street

graphs.
When a person desires to
hear the music at a certain
theater "central" is called up
in the usual way and the con
nection made with the trans
mitter on the stage, the same
as when a number is called.
And it Is done Just as quick
ly. By the time the receiver
is arranged the performance
is ready to begin. As many
people can hear the dialogue
as there are pairs of tubes,
and this is limited only by
the size of the plate that
screws on to the end of the
receiver.

likely that the invention will be adopt
ed for naval service until some meth
od of safely storing dynamite on board
vessels for a year at least has been
found or until some other nation adopts
it. When this was mentioned to Mr.
Isham he said:
"Dynamite is not as dangerous as is
commonly supposed, and it can be car
ried on vessels as safely as ordinary
black powder. It requires 700 degrees
Fahrenheit to Ignite it, when It burns
like an ordinary candle, without an ex
plosion. Black gunpowder spurts up
as it burns, and is more dangerous in
the mere burning of it. Dynamite in
a frozen stateâ that is, at forty-five de
greesâis not capable of being detonat
ed, and is Just as safe as wet guneot
ton. Now these shells when eonstruet
1 ed can be loaded at some dynamite fac

j the line that a new cycle of employ

of the lower class as fast as they can
be dispensed with below. Suppose that
an extreme limit is reached and that

ninety laborers out of each hundred
could be profitably employed in provid

This readjustment of vocations may
be accomplished well enough, provided
i the laborers are generally intelligent.
But this is a very important proviso.
, The populace must be educated in the
common schools and have that supe

the laborer becomes able to ascend from

She pocketed a good round sum over
the deal, but had forgotten all about
the fish, when a friend of hers, a Rus
sian Prince, being at lunch at her
house, asked her, suddenly, "How did
you like the sterlet?" "Oh," said Reich
emberg, "It was simply delicious â and
fresh, in spite of its long journey; as
fresh as if it had been caught an hour
before." "The gills were as red as your
lovely lips, were not they?" "More so,
I can tell you, for, you know, I am a
gourmande, and always see about these
things myself." "But is that all?"
"All! Pray, what do you mean?" "I
mean," said the Prince, turning purple,
"that the Grand Duke who sent the
sterlet to my house, with other things,
wrote and asked me to bring it myself
to you, for he had put in each gill an
emerald earring, which, I believe, he
had promised you. But I knew you al

Vile. Reichemberg dropped her

f a \HERE was considerable trouble and risk In bringing
the lifeboat up alongside, but it must be granted
that she was very unhandy.
I The gale that had blown them out into the At
- 1 lantic had moderated, certainly, though there was
still a considerable breeze blowing; but the sea was
â  'funning as high as ever, and all Captain Kettle's skill was
â  required to prevent the boat from being incontinently
swamped. McTodfl and the two Portuguese balled inces
santly, but th( boat was always half water-logged, in fact,
' from constitutional defects she had made very wet weath
:i through the blow.
It was the part of the steamer to have borne down and
given the lifeboat a lee in which she could have been more
lily handled, and three times the larger vessel made an
mpt to do this, but without avail. Three times she
worked round in a wallowing circle, got to windward, and
distributed a Bmell of farmyard over the rugged furrows
of ocean, and then lost her place again berore she could
drift down and give the smaller craft shelter. Three times
did the crew of the liftboat, with maritime point and flu
ency, curse the incompetence of the rust-streaked steamer
and all her complement.
. â¢ "By James!" said Kettle, savagely, after the third
attempt, "are they all farmers on that ship? I've had a
nigger steward that knew more about handling a vessel."
Meanwhile the clumsy tramp steamer had gone round in
.a jagged circle of a mile's diameter and was climbing back
to position again over the hills and dales of ocean. She
rolled and she pitched and she wallowed among the seas,
and to th<=- lay mind she would have seemed helplessness
personified. But to the expert eye she showed defects in
her handling with every sheer she took among the angry
wast^ of waters.
"Old man and the mates must b> staying down below
,-out of the wet." said Kettle, contemptuously, aa he gazed.
But the cattle steamer, if not skillfully handled, at any
rate this time had more luck. She worked her way to
windward again, and then fell off into the trough, squat
tfering down almost out of sight one minute, and, in fact,
.â¢ Blowing little of herself except a couple of stumpy, untidy
niirsts, and a brine-washed smokestack above the sea
scape, and being heaved up clear almost the next second, a
picture of rust streaks and yellow, spouting scuppers.
Both craft drifted to leeward before the wind, but the
steamer offered more surface and moved the quicker,
which was the object of the maneuver. It seemed to those
. in- the lifeboat that they were not going to be missed this
' time, and so they lowered away their sodden canvas, ship
..pe<l the tholepins and got out their oars. The two Portu
guese firemen did not assist at first, preferring to sit in a
" B"emi-dazed condition on the wet floor gratings, but Mc-
Todd and Kettle thumped them about the head, after the
. time-honored custom, till they turned to, and so presently
the lifeboat, under three straining oars, was holding up
toward her would-be deliverer.
A man on the cattle-boat's upper bridge was exhibiting
himself as a very model of nervous incapacity, and two,
at any rate, of the castaways in the lifeboat were watch
ing him with grim scorn.
"Keeping them on the dance in the engine-room, isn't
â¢he?" said McTodd. "He's rung that telegraph bell fifteen
different ways this last minute."
"That man isn't fit to skipper anything that hasn't got
a tow rope made fast ahead, said Kettle, contemptuously.
.'.'He hasn't the nerve of a pound of putty."
â¢ "I'm thinking we shall Ic3e the boat. They'll never get

The mate of the cattle boat grinned and tucked his

such a sea running. But the second mate and I put in
some ugly talk, and so he just had to do it. Here's the

"Pretty sort of captain to let his mates boss him!"

clothes in that drawer beneath the bed, and underwear be- [

the kit's quite at your service till your own's dry again."
"Well," continued the mate, as he watched Kettle,
"you may thank you're best little star that you're only
here as a passenger. The grub's beastly, tne ship stinks,
the cook's a fool, and everything's as . uncomfortable as
can be. But there's one fine amusement ahead of you, and
that's try and cheer up the other passenger." .
"Stowaway?"
"No; bona fide passenger, if you can imagine any one
being mug enough to book a room on a foul, cattle-loaded |
tramp like this. But I guess it was because sne was hard
up. She was a governess, or something of that "sort, in
Buesnos Ayres, Tost her berth, and wanted to get back
again cheap. I guess we could afford to cut rates and
make a profit there."
"Poor lady." ..
"I've not seen much of her myself. The second mate
and I are most of the crew of this ship, as the old man ob
jects to our driving the regular deckhands, and when we're â 
not at work we're asleep. I can't stop to introduce you.
You must chum on. Her name's Carnegie."
"Miss Carnegie?" Kettle repeated. "That sounds fa
miliar. Does she write poetry?"
The mate yawned. "Don't know. Never asked her.
But perhaps she does."
The mate went off to his room then, turned in all
standing, and was promptly asleep. Kettle, with memories
of the past refreshed, took paper and a scratchy pen and
fell to concocting verse.
He wondered, and at the same, time he half dreaded
whether this was the same Miss Carnegie whom he had
known before. In days past she had given him a commis- ...
sion to liberate her lover from the French penal settlement
of â¢Cayenne. With infinite danger and difficulty he had
wrenched the man free from his warders, and then, finding
him a worthless fellow, had by force married him to an old
Jamaican negress, and sent the girl their marriage lines as
a token of her release. He had had no word or sign from
her since, and was in some dread now lest she might bit
terly resent the liberty he had taken in meddling so far in
her affairs. " = â  â¢

move his papers. A grimy steward spread a dirty cloth,

He told himself sternly that he was a married man with a
family that he had a deep affection for both his wife and \
children: that. In cold fact, he had seen Miss Carnegie In

the memory that she made poetry, a craft that he adored,

The Wreck of the Cattle Boat

a shield, the women clothed in little
more than a breechcloth.
We learned that there was to be a
"smelling out" next day to discover
who was responsible for the cattle dy
ing at a village about five miles to the
north, anu made an agreement with a
young chief to guide us there.
We reached the village about 3 o'clock
in the afternoon and found the per
formance already in progress. In the
middle of the circle were a dozen men
togged out with the leaves of palm
trees and the foliage of a cereal called
mealies, like our corn.
Six of them had buffalo hide drums
suspended from the shoulder; the oth
ers carried bundles of assegais. At a
they picked up out of the boat? Oh, I am so glad you are
safe.
Kettle Strode out toward her on his steady sea legs and
stood before her, still not daring to take her ha*id. "You
have forgiven me?" he murmured. "What I did was a lib
erty, I know: but If I had not liked you so well, I should
not have dared to do It."
She cast down her eyes and flushed. "You are the
kindest man I over met," she said. "The very kindest."
She took his hand in both hers, and gripped it with nerv
ous force.
"You said you liked poetry," the girl whispered shyly,
when the first opportunity came. "I wrote the most heart
felt verses that ever came from me over that noble thing
you tried to do for a poor stranger like me."
Captain Kettle blushed like a maid. "For one of the
magazines?" he asked.
She shook her head sadly. "It was not published when
I left England, and It had been sent back to me from four
magazine offices. That was nothing new. They never
would take any of my stuff."
It appeared that Miss Carnegie's father had died since
she and Kettle had last met. and the girl had found her
self left almost destitute. She had been lured out to
Buenos Ayres by an advertisement, but without finding
employment; ana. sick at heart, had bought, with the last
of her scanty store of money, a cheap passage home in
this cattle boat. She would land In England entirely des
titute; and although she did not say this, spoke cheerfully
of the future: in fact. Kettle was torn with pity for her
state. But what, he asked himself with fierce scorn, could
he do? He was penniless himself; he had a â¢wife and fam
ily depending on him; and who was he to take this young,
unmarried girl under his charge?
"Do ,your three mates run this ship, captain?" asked
Kettle, at his first and only interview with the cattle
boat's captain.
"They are handy fellows." the captain answered.
"If you should ask me, I should call them poor drivers.
What for do they put in all the work themselves when
there are that mob of deckhands and cattle-hands stand
ing around doing the gentlemen as though they were In tnÂ«
gallery of a theater?"
"There was some misunderstanding when the crew
were shipped. They say they never signed on to handle
dead cattle."
"I've seen those kind of misunderstandings before,
captain, and I've started in to smooth them away."
"Well?" said the captain of the cattle boat.
"Oh. with me," said Kettle, truculently, "they straight
ened out so soon as ever I began to hit. If your mates
knew their business they'd soon have that crew in hand

"As if an old sailor had a conscience!" murmured Ket
tle to himself. "Well, captain, I'm no small piece of a
Christian myself, but I was taught that whatever my hand
flndeth to do to do it with all my might, and I guess bash
ing a lazy crew comes under that head."
"I don't want either your advice or your theology."
"If I wasn't a passenger here." said Kettle, "I'd like to
tell you what I thought of your seamanship, and your no

came over to us and said that "white
man has no right to stay here longer,"
and suggested to us to leave imme
diately.

The captain of the cattle boat flushed darkly. He
Jerked his head toward the ladder. "Get down off this
bridge " he said.
'Vhat!"
"You hear me! Get down off my brtdgw. If you've
learnt anything about your profession, you must know this
is private up here, and no place for blooming passengers."
Kettle glared and hesitated. He was nox used to re
ceiving orders of this description, and the innovation did
not please him. But for once in his life he submitted. Misa
Carnegie was sitting under the lee of the deckhouse aft,
watching him, and somehow or other he did not choose to
nave a scene before her. It was all part of this strange
new feeling which had come over him.
Â». S e gripped his other impulses tight and went and sat
beside her.
Perhaps of all the human freight that the cattle boat
carried Mr. McTodd was the only onÂ« person entirely
nappy. He had no watch to keep, no work to do; the mess
room was warm, stuffy and entirely to- his taste; liquor
was plenty, and the official engineers of the ship were
bcotch and argumentative. He never came on deck for a
whiff of fresh air; never knew a moment's tedium; he lived
In a pleasant atmosphere of broad dialect, strong tobacco
and toasting oil, and thoroughly enjoyed himself; though
wnen the moment of trial came, and his thews and sinews
and energies were wanted for the saving of human life, he
quickly showed that this Capua had in no way sapped his
efficiency.
The steamer had carried foul weather with her all the
way across the Atlantic from the River Platte, as though
It were a curse Inflicted for the cruelty of her stevedores.
There is no doubt that vigilance was dangerously slack
ened.
A tog, too, which came down to cover the sea, stopped
put all view of the sun, and compelled them for three days
to depend on dead reckoning; and (after the event) it was
Baid a strong current set the steamer unduiy to the west-
Ward.
Anyway, be the cause what It may. Kettle was pitched
violently out of his bunk in the deep of one night, just
after two bells, and from the symptoms which loudly ad
vertised themselves, it required no expert knowledge to
tell that the vessel was beating her bottom out on rocks to
the accompaniment of a murerously heavy sea. The en
gines stopped, steam began to blow off noisily from tne es
capes, and what with that and the cries of men and the
Clashing of seas and the beating of iron and the beast cries
from the cattle decks, the din was almost enough to split
the ear. And then the steam siren burst out into one vast
bellow of pain, which drowned all the other noises as
though they had been children's whispers.
Â«Kettle slid on coat and trousers over his pajamas, and
went and thumped at a door at the other side of the alley
way.
"Miss Carnegie?"
"Yes."
"Dress quickly."
"I am dressing, captain."
"Get finished with it, and then wait, I'll come for you
When it's time."
It Is all very well to bÂ« cool on these occasions, but
sometimes the race is to the prompt. Captain Kettle made
his way up on deck against a green avalanche of water,
which was cascading down the companionway. No shore
was in sight, the ship had backed off after she had struck
and was now rolling heavily in a deep trough. She was
low in the water and every second wave swept her.
No one seemed to be in command. A dim light showed
Kettle one lifeboat wrecked in the davits, and a disorderly
mob of men trying to lower the other. But some one let
go the stern fall so that the boat shot down perpendicular
ly, and the next wave smashed the lower naif of it into
pplinters. The frenzied crowd left it to try the port quar
ter boat and Kettle raced them across the streaming
decks and got just to the davits. He plucked a greenheart
belaying pin from the rail and laid about him viciously.
"Back, you scum." he shouted, "get back or I'll smash
in every face among you. Good Lord, isn't there a mate
or a man left on this stinking farmyard? Am I to keep off
all this two-legged cattle by myself?"
They fought on, the black water swirling waist deep
among them with every roll, the siren bellowing for help
overhead, and the ship sinking under their reet; and grad
ually, with the frenzy of despair, the men drove Kettle
back against the rallr while others of them cast off the
falls of the quarterboafs tackles preparatory to letting
her drop. But then out of the darkness up came McTodd
and the steamer's mate, both shrewd hitters and men not
afraid to use their skill, and once more the tables were
turned.
The other quarterboat had been lowered and swamped;
thl6 boat was the only one remaining.
"Now, Mac," said Kettle, "help the mate take charge,
and murder every one that interferes. Get the boat in the
water and .fend off. I'll be off below and fetch up Miss
Carnegie. We must put some hurry In it. The old box
hasn't much longer to swim. Take the lady ashore and se e
she comes to no harm."
"Oh, ay," said McTodd, "and we'll keep a seat for
yersel'. skipper."
"You needn't bother," said Kettle. "I take no man's
place In this sort of a tea party." He splashed off across
the streaming decks, and found the cattle boat's captain
sheltering under the lee of the companion wringing his
hands. "Out, you blitherer." he shouted, "and save your
mangy life. Your ship's gone now; you can't play hash
with her any more." After which pleasant speech he
worked his way below, half swimming, half wading, and
once more knocked at Miss Carnegie's floor. Even in this
moment of extremity he did not dream -of going in un
asked.
She came out to him in the half-swamped alleyway
fully dressed. "Is there any hope?" she asked.
"We'll get ashore, don't you fear."
He clapped an arm around her waist and drew her
strongly on through the dark and the swirling water to
ward the foot of the companion. "Excuse me miss " he
said, "this is not familiarity. But I have got the firmer
sealegs, and we must hurry."
They pressed up the stair, battling with great green
cascades of water, and gained the dreadrul turmoil on
deck. A few weak stars gleamed out above the wind and
showed the black wave-tops dimly. Already somr of the
cattle had been swept overboard, and were swimming
about like horned beasts of a nightmare. The din of surf
came to them among other noises, but no shore was vis
ible. The steamer had backed off the reef on which she
had struck, and was foundering in deep water It was in
deep a time for hurry. It was plain that she had very few
more minutes to swim.
Each sea now made a clean breach over her and a pas
sage about the decks was a thing of infinite oangrer. But
Kettle was resourceful and strong and he had a grip round
Ailss Carnegie and a hold on something solid when the
waters drenched on him, and he contrived never to be
wrested entirely from his hold.
But when he had worked his way aft, a disappoint
ment was there ready for him. The quarterboat was gone.
McTodd stood against one of the davits, cool and philo
sophical as evar.
"You infernal Scotchman, you'i'e let them take' away
the boat from you." Kettle snarled. "I should have
thought you could have kept your end up with a mangy
crowd like that."
"Use your eyes," said the engineer. "The boars In the
wash below there, at the end of the tackles with her side

"That comes of setting a lot of farmers to work a

"Aweel." said McTodd. "steamers have been lost be

'Oh I owed you that." said McTodd; "but now we're
quits. I bided here. Captain Kettle, because I thought
maybe you d like to swim the leddy off to the shore, and at
that I can bear a useful hand."
"Mac," said Kettle. "I take back what I said about
you're being Scotch. Yovl're a good soulâ" He turned to
the girl, still shouting to make his voice carry above thÂ©

clash of the seas and the bellow of the siren and the nolsea
of the dying ship. "IV a our only chance, miss swimming.
The lifebuoys from the bridge are all gono. I looked. The
hands will have taken them. There'll be a lot or timber
floating about when sUe goes down, and wo 11 be best clear
of that. Will you trust to us?"
"1 trust you In everything," she said.
Deeper and deeper the steamer sank In her wallow.
The lower decks were swamped by this, and the miserable
cattle were either drowned in their stalls or washed out
of her. There was no need for the three to jump. They
just let go their hold, and the next incoming wave swept
them clear of the steamer's spar deck and spurned them
one hundred yards from her side.
They found themselves among a herd of of floating
cattle, some drowned, some swimming frenziedly; and with
the inspiration of the'moment laid hold of a couple of
beasts which were tangled together by a halter, and so
supported themselves without further exertion. It was no
use swimming for the present. They could not tell which
way the shore lay. And It behooved them to reserve all
their energies for the morning, so well as the numbing cola
and the water would let them.
Of a sudden the bellow of the steamer's siren ceased,
and a pang went through them as though they had lost a
friend. Then came a dull, muffled explosion. And then a
huge, ragged shape loomed up through the night like some
vast monument, and sank swiftly straight downward out
of sight beneath the black, tumbled sea.
"Poor old girl," said McTodd, spitting out the sea
water, "they'd a nne keg of whisky down in her mess
room."
"Poor devil of a skipper," said Kettle, "It's to be hoped
he's drowned out of harm's way, or It'll take lying to keep
him any rags of his ticket."
The talk died out of them after that, and the miseries
of the situation closed in. The water was cold, but the
air was piercing, and so they kept their bodies submerged,
each holding on to the bovine raft, and each man sparing
a few fingers to keep a grip on the girl. One of the beasts
they clung to quickly drowned; the other, strange to say,
kept its nostrils above water, swimming strongly, and in
the end came alive to the shore, the only four-footed occu
pant of the steamer to be saved.
At the end of each minute it seemed to them that they
were too bruised and numb to hang on another sixty sec
onds; and yet the next minute found them still alive and
dreading its successor. The sea moaned around them,
mourning the dead; the fleet of drowned cattle surged
helplessly to this way and to that, bruising them with
rude collisions; and the chill bit them to the bone, merci
fully numbing their pain and anxiety. Long before the
dawn the girl had sunk into a stupor, and was only held
from sinking by the nervous fingers of the men; and then
the men themselves were merely automata, completing
their task with a legacy of will.
When from somewhere out of the morning mists a
fisherboat sailed up, manned by ragged, kindly Irish, all
three were equally lost to consciousness and all three
were hauled over the gunwale in one continuous, dripping
string. The grip of the men's fingers had endured too long
to be loosened for a sudden call such as that.
They were taken ashore and tended with all the care
poor homes could give, -and the men, used to hardships,
recovered with a dose of warmth and sleep.
Miss Carnegie took longer to recover, and In fact for a
week lay very near to death. Kettle stayed on In the vil
lage, making almost hourly inquiries for her. He ought to
have gone away to seek fresh employment: he ought to
have gone back to his wife and children, and he upbraided
himself bitterly for his neglect of these duties. But still
he could not tear himself away. For the future â well, he
dreaded to think what might happen in the future.
But at last the girl was able to sit up and see him, and
he visited her, showing all the deference an ambassador
might offer to a queen. I may go so far as to Bay that he
went into the cottage quite infatuated; ho came out of it
disillusioned.
She listened to his tale of the wreck with interest and
surprise. She was almost startled to hear that others, in
cluding the captain and two of the mates, were saved from
the disaster besides themselves, but at the same time un
feignedly pleased. And she was pleased also to hear that
Kettle was subpenaed to give evidence before the forth
coming inquiry.
"I am glad of that," sh said, "because I know you will
speak with a free mind. You have told me so many times
how incompetent the captain was, and now you will be
able to tell it to the proper authorities."
Kettle looked at her blankly. "But that was different,"
he said. "I can't say to them what I said to you."
"Why not? Look what misery and suffering and loss
of life the man has caused. He isn't fit to command a
ship."
"But, miss." said Kettle, "it's his living. He's been
-brought up to seafaring-, and he isn't fit for anything else.
You wouldn't have me send out the man to starve? Be
sides I'm a shipmaster myself, and you wouldn't have me
try to take away another masters ticket? The cleverest
captain afloat might meet with misfortune, and he's al
ways got to think of that when he's put up to give evi
dence against his fellows."
"Well, what are you going to do, then?"
"Oh, we've got together a tale, and when the old man
Is put up on his trial the mates and I will stick to it
through thick and thin. You gpan bet that we are not
going to swear away his tioket.
"His ticket?"
"Yes: his master's certificate, his means of livelihood."
"I think it's wrong." she said, excitedly, "criminally
wrong. And besides, you said you didn't like the man."
"I don't. I dislike him cordially. But that's nothing
to do with the case. I've my own honor to thinK of, Miss.
How'd I feel if I went about knowing I'd done my best to
ruin a brother captain for good and always?"
"You are wrong." she repeated, vehemently. "The
man is incompetent by your own saying, and. therefore, ha
should suffer."
Kettles heart chilled.
"Miss Carnegie," he said. "I am disappointed In you.
I thought from your poetry that you had feelings; I
thought you had charity, but I find that you are cold."
"And you," she retorted, "you that I had set up for
myself as an ideal of most of the manly virtues, do you

you deliberately won't understand, miss. You remember
that I said I was disappointed in you, and I stick to that
now. You make me remember that I have got a wife and
family I am fond of. You make me ashamed I have not
gone to them before."
He went to the door and opened it. "But I do not think
I shall ever forget." he said, "how much I cared for you

"Good-by," she sobbed from her pillow. "T wish I

Then she said her husband had
some fine baskets to sell, but he
had gone to the hop fields and
had taken the key of the shanty
and had locked her out. He
would not return till nightfall and
perhaps not then, she said.
"You don't have any women's
clubs here?" I queried.
"Women clubs. Oh, yes, he club me."
A small boy who had kept close to us
said his sister had some baskets, so we
followed him to her home.
It was larger and better than the
rest. A capacious fireplace without a
chimney gave forth more smoke than
warmth, and a very old Bquaw got up
in disgust at seeing us enter and went
out grumbling.
In the warmest, least smoky corner
a young woman crouched with a death
like baby, whose wall she was trying to
soothe. She paid no attention to us and
only watched her baby. Her mother,
who was stretching the skins of some
rabbits which she had just dressed, left
them and brought out the baskets.
There were two of them and on each
was pinned a note written in a round,
schoolboy hand:
THIS BASKET TWENTY (20)
DOLLARS.
NO UP NO DOWN.
The old squaw was jolly and quizzical
and wanted to know why we wanted
the baskets, but she could not grasp
the explanationâ and I asked to take
the baby's photograph.
"No! No! Not! She," pointing to her
daughter, "feel sorry. She got two
lose â no picture take!"
All the while the mother of the little
one hugged him closer, because, with
all Indians, she believed that to be pho
tographed, shortens one's life. It was
for this reason. I suspect, that they
made no objection, wV,Â«-n paid, to our
photographing their old people, who are
useless to them.
A smiling, genial Indian gentleman
allowed us to photograph a baby as of
ten as we pleased, at 25 cents a shot.
We afterward discovered it was a
neighbor's baby he had borrowed to use
on us.
In front of the last shanty in this
rancheria three old women were seated
grinding acorns into flour. An old man
lying near by on the ground did not
open his eyes to notice us.
"Is he asleep?" I asked.
"More likely he is drunk," said the
photographer.
The old man opened his eyes and
grinned and said, "Not so good luck,"
and all the women joined in an appre
ciative grin.
They had no baskets, but allowed us
to photograph them for a consideration.
The next rancheria was seven milrs
distant. Just before we reached it a
crowd of school children came out of
school. They were as wild as birds, but
soon forgot their fear scrambling for
small coin which we threw to them.
One small girl said her name was
Sara Bernhart. A boy told me he was
Paderewski, and when Sharkey and
Fitzsimmons, too, were in the school, I
asked a little lone-faced boy if those
were the children's right names.
"Oh. no; he's Mary and he's Joseph,"
came the answer, and all the names of
the apostles followed, for they are
named by the priest and the good sis
ters who teach their only school.
They had just been arranged for a
fine group when a man on horseback
appeared, and the youngsters were off
like a flash. The man rode after and
seemed to threaten as the children dis
appeared in their homes.
. When we knocked every door was
locked, and one squaw called out:
"This Injun don't want nothing."
The rest seemed all dead.
We were just deciding that either we
must attack the villiage in old Indian
style or else give up baskets and pho
tographs, when an old Indian and his
wife drove up in a cart which seemed
to be held together with ropes. We ap
pealed to him.
"My wife she no good â she too lazy.
She not make baskets â she only sit
down." raid the old Indian.
The wife smiled in a superior sort of
way, and did not seem to mind what he
said.
The man told us he was the captain,
as the chief man of the village is
called: that"~the men were in the sweat
house and that he would take us In and
we could get a picture if we paid him.
It was agreed and he slowly un
hitched and then brought out some
beautiful baskets in which to pack the
provisions he had bought.
"My odder wife she died," he ex

plained. "Oh, she very good. She
make many, many baskets. I sell and
ret much, much money. This one,"
and he pointed to his companion, "Bhe
damn no good."
The "other wife" only grinned.
The roof of the sweat or club house
only was above ground â a low pyra
mid formed of poles about twenty-five
feet long and leaving a four-foot open
ing over the center. The entrance
was dug out and descended about three
feet to the floor of the inclosure and
was so low that I had to lie down and
wiggle in after the chief, who had al
ready made the bargain with the In
dians to be photographed.
A fire was burning under the open-
Ing in the roof, which let out some
smoke and let in a little air and day
light. Not one of the braves appeared
to be conscious of our entrance as they
sat on the ground, throwing down the
cards and counting of wampum from
long strings hanging about their necks.
They were gambling and used the
wampum as counters, to be afterward
redeemed in legal tender.
The photographer explained to them
clearly that the flashlight would make
a little noise and a little fire and some
SAW NAPOLEON
MARCH TO MOSCOW
Bemarkable period which Dr. Floto, a practicing San
Francisco physician, can review as his lifetime. He spoke
to Napoleon's brother Joseph, King of Holland, and met
many interesting people of the Napoleonic era.
WHEN I was a boy, begins my
entertainer, and I gaze at
him with respectful and
wondering admiration.
Imagine sitting hale and
hearty here in San Francisco, a man
among men still, a doctor among doc
tors, with patients awaiting in an ante
room the pleasure of an audience in the
efficacy of which they firmly believe,
and yet thinking back over nearly
ninety long years and telling stories of
personal experiences with Bonaparte the

back so miserably from Moscow, and

the weak and easily influenced brother
Jerome who bartered the wife of his
choice for a kingdom of a few years'
duration.
This is the position of Dr. John H.
Floto at the present time. Born in
Hoxter, Prussia, ninety-four years ago,
the doctor came to this country while
"Old Hickory" was occupying the
Presidential chair of our nation, and af
ter graduating from the homeopathic
college of Allentown, Pennsylvania, the
first establishment of its kind in Amer
ica, studied allopathic methods in the
Philadelphia Medical College undor the
celebrated surgeon George McClellan,
and graduated with honor from that
institution also.
For over sixty years Dr. Floto has
been a practicing physician and for
thirty-three of those years he has been
practicing here in California, where he
bids fair from present appearances to
continue his professional labors for
some time to come.
Although he is undoubtedly the old
est physician still in the professional
harness in the United States, the doctor
looks as young as the majority of men
who came into this world a quarter of
a century later than himself. His
shoulders are not stooped with the
weight of years, nor has his step be
come feeble or uncertain. He carries a
cane, it is true, but the cane by no
means carries him. His figure is erect,
his manner and movements alert and
assured. A slight dullness of hearing:,
not sufficient to in any way interfere
with the pleasure of conversation with
him, is the only mark of advanced age
which Father Time has seen fit to lay
upon him. He has the' fine, high,
slightly aquiline nose which generally
tells that its fortunate possessor is of
aristocratic lineaee, a luxuriant crown
of beautiful white hair, a' crisply curl
ing white beard, and the sharp but
kindly eyes of the true disciple of Es
culapius. Moreover he has the dieni
fledly gracious ways of the "old
school."
He has shown me a photograph of his
father's brother which was taken a few
months before his death at the age of
107, and he has shown me his only pic
ture of his father who "died auite
young." he says, being: cut off untimely
after only seventy-five years of life, on
account of having contracted rheuma
tism through living three years in a
tent during his service in the French
army.
"He was a brave and good man,"
says the doctor, as he carefully puts
again under lock and key the bit of
paper cherished for so many years, and
then he tells me the story for which I
light and a bit of smell.
The captain nodded patronizingly and
said that would be all right; they
would not mind.
But they did. Every Indian came
to life with a whoop. There was no
chance to run and roiling out that rat
hole entrance did not appeal to me just
them. I stood as near the wall as I
could get, while the Indians tried to
kill the hoodoo in the camera by cir
cling around it and half chanting, half
speaking, short sentences In Indian, be
ginning very loud and ending In a
whisper.
The flashlight affected the captain,
too, and he abandoned us to the howl
ing, dancing black fiends in that pent
up smoky place. At last he came to
his senses and told us *to "git out
quick."
We lost no time in wriggling through
the low doorway.
We drove away as quickly as might
be with about four plates, a broken
camera and no baskets.
In town I bought better baskets than
I had seen at the shanties for $3 each,
but I was sure the noble red man had
at least one superstition and one
rite to ward it off. HELEN GREY.

years old, I Innocently made my father
very uncomfortable for a few moments.
He, who was always more than kind,
spoke so severely to me on that occa
sion that the whole affair became in
delibly stamped upon my mind, and
forms the first memory picture of my
long life.
"Hoxter, our home, is a .town situ
ated on the left bank of the Weser.
and is a place of considerable histori
cal interest. In the days of the 'thlrty
years' war' it was a very flourishing:
city of more than forty thousand in
habitants, but General Tilly, comman
der of the Catholic army, bombarded
and destroyed it, together with the

"When I was a little boy," it begins,
great stone bridge across the river, and
killed all the inhabitants who had not
managed to get away, except a few
who hid under the huge clock in a
church steeple. In the early days of
this century it had a population of
about 3000, and was chiefly noted be
cause of the beautiful monastery which
was built by Ludovic and Pious, sons
of the great Charlemagne, on the river
bank close at hand.
"Jerome, youngest brother of Na
poleon Bonaparte, was enjoying his
short-lived kingdom of Westphalia in
those days, and his brother,
Joseph, King of Holland, having made
him a present of a fine vessel, he made
a trip with his court up the river from
Cassel, the royal residence, which Is
about thirty miles away, to see this
wonderful old building and its beauti
ful grounds.
"Great preparations were made for
his coming; steps were built up from
the river and all the population turned
out to see the show. My father and
the Bishop were to personally receive
and escort the King, and as they stood
together at the top of the steps I ran
away from my mother and the rest and
went up beside my father.
"The King was advancing up the
steps, so father was obliged to ignore
me and carry out his part of the pro
gramme. Jerome was most affable and
stood for some minutes talking with
the two gentlemen, while the richly
dressed ladies and gentlemen of his
court waited at a little distance listen
ing, with amusement doubtless, to the
queer mixture of French and German
with which they endeavored to make
themselves understood.
"As for me. I grew tired of standing
there and being taken no notice of by
any one. and being a petted child I
announced my presence by suddenly
and decidedly pulling the King's coat
tail. I shall never forget the expres
sion of my father's face as he looked
at me, nor the tone of his voice, but the
King, who was as kindly as he was
weak and vacillating, put his hand on
my head and bade my father not to
chide me. and after that I was taken
on board the beautiful boat, which was
fitted up like a palace, and then walked
through the convent gardens and had
altogether such a delightful time as to
make that the happiest day that I had
ever known.
"That bishop, by the way, was the
famous Bishop Loer.ing, and Jerome
took such a fancy to him that he had
him remove to the palace and become
hie religious adviser. He died a year
later and his portrait, queerly enough,
since he was the last bishop ever cre
ated in that diocese, Just completed the
line of portraits of his predecessors.
which, headed by those of Charlemagne
and Ludovic, extended along and fitted
into the length of the great convent
gallery.
"About two years later, in the spring
of 1812 I think it was. Napoleon him
self was driven through the town in a
carriage. I remember well how he
looked sitting up very .straight with
his arms folded and his hat pulled a
little down over his eyes. There was a
great crowd out to look at him, but
there was no cheering, and no pleas
ant excitement. No one there either
loved or admired him, I can assure
you, and he went along as quickly and
quietly as possible.
"After that the troops began to
march through the place night and day
on their way to Moscow, and every
body was frightened and anxious, for
there seemed no real safety for any
one. The rattle of the artillery car
riages, the tramp of the infantry and
the noise of the cavalry made the
whole town a place of confusion. Our
houses were made hotels against our
wills and all peaceful avocations were
at a standstill until the great body of
the army had passed by. Some of our
own townspeople of course went with
them â because they must â and that
fall and winter some of them came
back again. One of our neighbors
came with both legs frozen off, and he
was glad to get back with the stumps.
"It seems like a nightmare, the mem
ory of the tattered, starving, crippled
creatures that I saw in those dreadful
days, while I was yet too young to un
derstand the reason of their misery
and who was to blame for the death
of the 90,000 men who were lost in that
awful retreat from Moscow.
"After the French were beaten at
Leipsic the people of Hoxter had a fine
festival and one of the amusements
was a shooting contest open to all rifle
men. The target was a life-size effigy
of Napoleon Bonaparte a. r * to the first
man who put a bullet where his heart
ought to have been was promised a
valuable prize.
"I was eight years old then and had
begun to understand things a little bet
ter than formerly, and I watched the
marksmen shoot with the greatest in
terest. Everybody rejoiced when the
figure was hit at all and rejoiced louder
the nearer a shot came to piercing a
vital part. A printer whom we knew
well was the first one to send a bullet
through the tiny spot over the heart,
and he was the king of the festival
from that moment."

hard, either, to pick up a talking
knowledge of Spanish.
"Then there are the mineral deposits
of the eastern provinces, and the Im
mense tracts of timber land, which,
once they are cleared, become the most
fertile of farming properties. Havana,
too, will grow immensely under the
Increase of business; It will become a
great winter resort for America. There
will be chances there In real estate and
many positions for hustling young
Americans as clerks. To sum It all up,
there Is no more fertile spot on earth,
and It stands to reason that under an
enlightened and progressive govern
ment the large resources will lead to
vast finances. I shall be in Havana
after peace is declared. I shall be glad
to help any Americans with such ad
vice as I can give."
Antonio Colas, one of the largest
merchants in Santiago, Is now in New
York and has with him powers of at
torney from some fifty Cuban mer
chants to act In their Interests In
America. When asked to speak of
Santiago province and the business op
portunities there, he said:
"Santiago, In the first place, is the
largest province In Cuba, with a popu
lation relatively much smaller than any
other. For this reason it offers good
chances for Americans. It 1b divided by
the Sierra Maesta Mountains, which
form a watershed, fertilizing both the
northern and southern parts. It has
many rivers, among which is the Cauto.
the largest in Cuba. The mineral re
sources are abundant. The Iron mines
produce from 65 to 90 per cent of mag
netic Iron, and it Is from this material,
because of Its high gTade, that the ar
mor and armor-piercing projectiles of
the United States navy are made.
There are manganese mines producing
from 50 to 56 per cent of peroxide of
manganese, a grade superior to the
Russian because of the small amount
of phosphorus therein. There are most
valuable copper mines, which have
been carried on by English companies,
but work on which was discontinued
because of the fatal restrictions of the
Spanish Government. Add to these pe
troleum, coal, lead, tin, and deposits
of asphaltum and you can gain some
Idea of the resources there.
"The forests of the Santiago province
are the largest in Cuba. There are im
menee tracts of pine and the hard
woods are unequaled in the island for
quality and size. The cedar is the best
in the world and the mahogany is as
good as that of San Domingo. In all
there are sixty different kinds of wood
therÂ«. After cutting the forests, the
land can be cleared easily by burning,
leaving very fertile property. The cli
mate is beautiful If ordinary care Is
taken. In the interioT the much feared
yellow fever exists only in rare cases,
and then is due to the Spanish soldiers,
a source of danger which will soon be
remored. The soil is so moist that ma
laria sometimes appears, but a little
care will avert this trouble. In San
tiago, too, coffee is abundant and also
cocoa, equal to that of Maracaibo.
There are lots of pineapples. The to
bacco, however, has not the high qual
ity of the Pinar del Rio grade Jind is
sold mostly in Germany and Spain.
"Yes, I should advise a young man
to go there. If he 1b ambitious. Intelli
gent and economical, he can make
good progress. The fact that the people
there have been able to pay the high
rates of Interest, the excessive taxes
and still make money proves that great
success will be possible under Ameri
can rule."

STOP
KISSING
IT has been a long time now since the
apostles of hygiene raised the alarm
cry "stop kissing" and more than twen
ty years since Princess Alice of Hesse
paid with her life the price of a kiss to her
dying child, but lately, as the germ
theory becomes more and more estab
lished", the cry gains force. When in 1895
Dr. Frank W. Reilly, In his report to the
Chicago Board of Health, gave the ad
vice to the public to avoid indiscriminate
kissing, and when osculation became nec
essary, to use carbolized rosewater as an
antidote, that advice provoked much
amusement. Certainly the idea of carry-
I ing always a pocket flask of carbolized
! rosewater for use before and after kies
; ing seems absurd, yet the advice was
eminently sensible. In no way are dis
ease germs so readily propagated an
I through the medium of a kiss, when the
! breath is inhaled from mouth to mouth.
Consumption and diphtheria, indeed all
kinds of lung and throat diseases, as well
as typhoid fever and cholera, are easily
I Inhaled. Dr. Reilly tells of a minister tn
I a country town who made a practice of
kissing his flock after church every Sun
day He- the preacherâ had consumption,
I and the mortality in the village increased
125 per cent in one year,
i Indiscriminate kissing of children Is ac-
I tually criminal. It was a wise child-the
I three-year-old Boston boy who turned his
cheek to his Western cousin with you
mustn't kiss me on the mouth becautn
Â° The\farmists and decriers of the tender
custom are quite right. Kissing 18 a
practice to be suppressed, or at least re
stricted within narrow limits. If one
stops to consider the matter it is not a
pleasant thing to kiss promiscuously.
Aside from thl hygienic view of the cus
tom, the growing dislike of the public
demonstration of affection among high
bred people has had much to do wltn
its decadence.
Eddy & Co., the largest wholesale
house engaged in the West Indies
trade, declares emphatically that
American merchants should not invest
their money in Cuba nor in the Philip
pines. "Those countries," he says, "are
too highly organized commerciaJly for
any American of smaJl capital or large
either, for that matter, to think of
competing with the native talent. The
AmerlcaJi visiting the islands will find
them plotted out in a manner that
would entirely exclude foreign competi
tion. The Cubans themselves are a very
shrewd people. They know the lan
guage and the habits of the people
about them. They know their wants
and how best to cater to them. They
are therefore not handicapped as the
Americans would be by the absence of
the very requirements needed to secure
an entry. Again, no American would
be willing (even supposing he could in
the climate) to work as do the native
merchants, sixteen hours out of the
twenty-four each day.
â¢You see, too many people make the
mistake of regarding Cuba in the light
of an unexplored country like the Klon
dike. Now you or I could go to the
Klondike and enter into active compe
tition with the other fellow with some
chance of success, because the same
conditions would govern us all. The
conditions, in fact, would be bu% little
different from those surrounding us in
Seattle, and we would all speak the
same language.
"The condition in the Philippines Is
precisely the same as It is in Cuba.
There is one large city, Manila, only
one-quarter the inhabitants of which
are merchants. The Chinese control the
trade and they will go on controlling
it. They know the habits of the peo
ple and what they want. They make
big profits because they live in a penu
rious manner which no respectable
American would be able to abide for an
instant. No, I do not think much of
Cuba or the Philippines as new ave
nues for American capital."

FORESTERS' RELIEF COMMITTEE.
The work of the relief committee of
the Foresters and Companions of the I
Forest of America is going on quietly
and unostentatiously. The tent main
tained at the Presidio camping grounds
is attended to daily by some of the Com
panions of the circles, and on Sunday
there Is on guard a number- o*. the mem
bers of the courts. These have rendered
considerable assistance to the Forester
soldiers, and a few days since, when the
California Seventh was ordered to move
from Camp Merritt to the Presidio, it waa
ascertained by the ladies at i.ie tent that
Captain Wankowski's company, in which
there are a number of Foresters, had
been for ten hours without food ana
they at once provided them with a lunch.
Their good offices were not limited to the
Foresters of the company, but to all the
members, who were accommodated in the
tent a few at a time.
THE AMERICAN GUILD.

nesday night, there was a large attend
ance and in the course of the evening three
candidates â Ed. H. Mutt. Charles Roth
weiler and Miss H. Harperâ were initi
ated.
This chapter discussed the proposition
offered at a previous meeting to give an
entertainment and ball, as well as a high
Jinks, and after a number of those present
had expressed themselves, the matter was
left to the committee of arrangement*.
A report from the chapter at Tomales
shows that it Is doing; well and that the
membership is displaying considerable ac

NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â 1n the au
tumn the young woman's fancy
turns perslf ently toward au
tumn garments. However beau
tiful her summer clothes may
have seemed to her three
â¢ months ago. they are now old and dowdy.
The stiffening has come out of the cblffon;
mull Is lifeless; feathers have grown
straight, and the blush is off the June
rose.
The first change which a woman makes
in her wardrobe in the fall is invariably
.in the line of hats. The white sailor is
taken off and put away, and the darker
.hat with. its heavier trimming is put on.
It Is claimed that the hats of the season
are made only to grace the windows of
the milliner shops; but this, my friend,
the milliner, tolls mo is untrue this sea-
Bon, for the early hats are to be put on
and worn.
The new fall hats, to be sure, are freak
ish. No one will deny this. It is really
astonishing to note the different ways in
which they are turned and bent. "Struck
by lightning." is the 'term by which Aunt
Samantha from the country might speak
of some of the shapes, so odd are they.
If 1 were asked to name the most popu
lar shape for an autumn hat, I should
say the cocked shape. Hats are cocked
over one eye; cocked over the nose;
knocked back over the crown of the
head; put on all a-tilt until you wonder
how the back is distinguished from the
front. To avoid error my friend, the
milliner, who sold a $40 Tarn hat. in ad
vance of the season, placed a great rhine
stone button high in the front.
"There, my dear," said she to the pur
chaser, "remember that the rhinestone
button must be directly over your left
eye. When you put on the hat set the
button over your left eye and the hat
will be on straight."
So the purchaser pinned the hat on
rakish, sideways, and a-tilt. The back
was so high that it was almost perpen
â  dicular. It was supported with many
: chrysanthemums in the rear, but the
â¢ front was low over the forehead. Folds
â of velvet with queer, trailing plumes
;. trimmed the soft, Tarn-like crown. The
whole thing was a charming medley, but
to keep it on straight the rhinestone but
ton set proudly above the left eye.
: â  Another style hat is what my friend, the
witty Miss Chic, called "an English walk
ing hat gone astray." The hat so de
scribed by her was of white straw with
curious dashes of black running through
. It. One side was quite on the regulation
â  order', but the other side was cocked and
caught with bird of Paradise plume^
â¢ which waved over the top of the hat.
Vndor the brim there was a double bow
of velvet pinned with rhlnestones, and
there were velvet haws at the back. â¢
The English walking hat in some shape
or. other will always be worn. It is so
â becoming to pretty tf aces. Even to plain
.ones it lends a gracV which mal.es them
almost classic.
Dark brown straw English walking hats
. are very fashionable, trimmed with green
birds and bright purple violets. The back
of. the hat Is slightly raised to give it a
â¢ -tilt over the nose. This hat can be worn
straight; and, Indeed, the English walk-
Ing hat is more becoming if worn conven
tionally. .''.:,;'
One of the most curious hats I have
seen was something on the style of an
English walking hat with a crown built
up very high. Crowns will be built Up
â¢ this winter in a most surprising fashion.'
. This crown was originally no higher than
..$." sailor hat. but by means of embossed
' velvet, -which was carried, round and
â¢ round the crown, .it was.- raised until â¢it
â  stood almost as tall as a man's hat. To
â¢make it. still higher a fan -feather was
â  geared at one Siue .to proudly wave over
'the head of the' wearer. <. ..These ' fan
feat hers are so eccentric that one can
: hardly recommend them to persons who
' â  will have only one hat, but where novel
ty .'is desired, instead of wearing quills,
â  the. fan feather is most. decorative.
â  Ostrich plumes will also jbo a great
â  deal worn this season. Rut alas, for
â¢the 'pocket-book of the wearer they will
â¢be extremely expensive. Plumes as long
â¢â¢as- vpur arm .are -exhibited in the shop
. window^, and piarked at startling -prices. -
- If^yoii â¢ -are rxtrdTnely "clever you will
.-tuv^-two cheap- feathers and fasten them
together so .as to make one long sweep
'' Ing plume. This you can drape over
'.your ear in good century-ago fashion or
' you can stand it at one Bide of your
head.. . . . i. .-;>-â  â â¢â¢ â 
Ostrich feathers will be used In all
colors, although the preference Is for
: .black and white. The pale shades, such
\as lilac, gray, green, pink, gas light blue
â¢ and the great array of pale yellows will
.â¢all be conspicuous In' the season's trim
. mines.
.-. They say that It Is not difficult to dye
feathers and that the old light plumes,
.feathers, tips, aigrettes and other bird
. decorations can be dipped in dye and
made a beautiful dark green, dark brown,
'. steel or black, as fancy may dictate. The
secret of dyeing, however, is such a com
plex, one that many fall to learn it. The
â¢ dye. pot should be filled to the brim with
. the dye stuff. Then the feathers can be
. plunged in one after another. It Is ruin
â¢ ous to add water 'to the dye after the
â¢ goods are in the dye pot. This is what
gives, the streaks so often seen in home
" dyed goods. :
â¢ â¢ Just now, when the season's hats are so
â¢ odd; It is not impossible to take the sum
â  rrier hat and make It a winter one by the
free, use of the ever available dye pot.
. *The straw should be thoroughly brushed
and. 'cleaned. If It is white, it should be
;.cleaed with lemon juice; if colored, with
â water. After every possible speck or stain
-has. been removed it can receive its coat
â 'of "dye. Remember .that every blemish'
â  comes to the surface in dyeing, and that
-"it will be necessary, to dip often if the
"'â¢'goods are much stained.
-..â¢ They say that winter hats are to be ex
â â¢ pensive, on account of the great amount
â -' of trlmmlnfi^that will be used upon them.
â¢It will not be a winter of great simplicity.
:''. but one In which leathers and plumes and
â¢ velvet and ribbon are used with lavish
hand. . â 
.-. For economy's sake it might he said
;â¢ that where trimming is used In great pro
" fusion It need not be so fine. For exam
â  ple, the silk ruching which is so popular
â¢"upon the hat can be made- out of â  a
breadth of old silk nicely washed and
â  ironed and cut in strips. Have the nich
ing- double and as full as {possible. This
: makes a very acceptable trimming for the
" front or the side of a hat. If the crown
be tall and straight It can be set entirely
' around the crown. â¢ -
" The small turban of last winter with
Its low crown can be built up with
â¢ NEW WAY OF TREATING THE ENGLISH WALKING HAT.
bands of velvet placed one over the other
so that a band made up of many folds
stands high around the crown. Such
trimming as this needs only a bunch
of feathers at the back, or if it be very
ful, the hat requires no other trimming
at; all. Merely a finish made of a hand
ful of autumn leaves with their trailing
stems wili be sufficient.
The velvet crown will be very much
soon this winter, and this. too. is a useful
thing, whether the woman makes her
hats or buys them of the milliner. A
width of velvet can be made into a very
acceptable crown, and as for the brimâ
a straw brim can be worn until Christ
mas.
The impossible old flat felt hat of
many seasons ago can take a new lease
of life this winter if its brim is cut
dawn a little, and its crown is treated
to a big cover of velvet. Make a big
black velvet crown and trim the brim
with small tips sotting out from the
crown beyond the brim. This makes a
very nice finish, and the hat needs no
other trimming.
Imported hats are effective and varied
this year. 1. saw one which was such a
medley of bird of Paradise plumes and !
lace and ribbon and silk that I should |
hesitate about describing it. No straw
was visible, and the hat was covered
with brown autumn flowers, with their
green leaves running along the brim.
Lace is very much used upon the hats,
and very nice it looks as it falls over
the autumn flowers so as to veil them;
or as it forms a becoming background
for delicate foliage.
The xÂ»rices run as high as $45 in the
milliners' windows, but the obliging milli
ner will suit her hat to the purse of her
customer. HELEN WARD.
COLLECTIONS
OF GARTERS
THE unseen, but useful, garter has
been seized upon as the pretext for
collection, says the Chicago Chroni
cle. Chicago girls are not now con
tent with two for week days and an
extra pair for Sunday, but gather garters
in place of souvenir spoons or pictures.
Garters all gemmed with precious stones
and quaint old-fashioned things that held
in place the silk hosiery of grandmamma
are laid side by side with the "patriotic
garter" made of red, white and blue rib
bon and held together by an army but
ton of brass.
A little South Side woman was one of
the first to turn to this fad and she has
one of the handsomest collections In the
city. Her treasures are not shown to
every comer, but her more intimate
friends have had glimpses of her souvenir
garters. One who had not yet learned
that spoon collecting was too old an
amusement to interest the end of the cen
tury young woman was talking to her
the other evening and asked if she had
made a collection of spoons.
"Of course, I made a souvenir spoon
collection," she said, "but that is old now,
and I have turned my attention to some
thing better. I have a very unique col
lection of garters."
"Garters! Do you mean to Bay that
you have a collection' of them?"
"Why, yesâ you know it is the fad now
j in Chicago, and I think that I have the
| most complete collection of any woman.
jL.st wait a moment and I'll bring them
down."
When she returned she carried a large j
I box and several smaller ones.
"You know we all have to have some
fad." she said with a smile. "Some gather
cravats, but I like to gather carters
best."
The little woman unwrapped her
precious garters and explained their
1 beauties. She has thirty-four pairs and
[one odd one "for luck." She has .them
i made of every material from' cotton to
i silk, and the clasps are of brass, silver
j or gold, ajjd some "are studcted with p'rec-
I lous .stones. A moat lovely .pair otgar
icrs were made of pink silk ribbon, caught â 
; together with a silver clasp made In a true
j lover's knot, set with moonstones.
"This was sent to me from New York."
; she said, "and this sllvec fishhook clasp
lon these yellow garters Is a Boston
! variety."
The oldest pair in her collection were
; given to her by a Viennese lady of arls- ;
I tocratic birth, in whose family they had
1 been for more than 100 years. The band ;
j has, of course, been replaced many times,
: but the bronze clasps show ' the. wear i
they have had, brushing against silk and \
â  muslin until they have acquired a bright- ;
j ness almost like gold. The clasps are of ;
: a shield shape and bear the coat of arms
iof a noble Austrian family. A pair of !
â  garters made of trlcolored webbing and !
i clasped by an ingenious' device soldered '.
] to a United States army button is ono of j
the valued treasures. . .

NOW Js the time when the sum
mer girl flutters back to town
from her outing at the seashore
or In the mountains and settles
herself down to doctor Ijer com
plexion and to coax back by fair
means or foul, the fair hues and tints
that bewilder and delight men's souls. I
wonder how many of these girls hav-e
brought back the beautiful coats of tan
and numerous freckles that I predicted
at the beginning of the summer. How
many have carried out their determina
tion to return to town as "brown as a
berry," and now wish they hadn't?
Tanned skins and sun-browned noses
may be treasurable possessions away
from the haunts of civilization, but back
among the hosts of the city, and pre
paratory to a winter's campaign of,
crushing hearts, they are a positive af
lliction.
Many a girl's complexion has been Irre
trievably ruined by just one summer's
endeavor to get nicely browned.
To remove tan and sunburn there is
nothing better than rich, sweet cream,
or half a cupful of sweet milk In which
a pinch of borax has been dissolved.
Tbe following lotion applied to the face
will prevent its tanning to any great ex
tent, that is if proper care is taken of
one's skin:
Distilled witchhazel, 3 ounces.
Prepared cucumber juice, 3 ounces.
Rosewater, 1% ounces.
Essence white rose, 1% ounces.
Simple tincture of benzoin, H ounce.
Rub this well into the skin with the
tips of the tlngers until it is absorbed
and then apply a. puro powder.
To annihilate freckles use this wash:
FRECKLE LOTION.
Three grains borax.
Five drams rosewater.
Five drama orange flower water.
With care and proper protection of the
face when going out, particularly from
the winds that are now rampant, the red
noses, flaky skins and sun-kissed cheeks
can gradually be coaxed back to their
normal tints.
I am going to give you this week a
recipe which you will find particularly
nice to use at this time of year, when
the winds seem to gather up whole buck
etfuls of dust to fling into one's face and
grind into one's skin. This cream has
splendid cleansing qualities and will re
move the soot and dust in a hurry. Here
are the proportions:
CREAM.
Spermaceti, V/* ounces.
Oil of swc-ct almonds, I*4 ounces.
Refined white wax, % ounce.
Rosewater, % ounce.
Lettuce, one cup.
Essence of violet, two teaspoon
fuls. â¢
Grate or shave the white wax and the
spermaceti into a clean, unblemished
granite diah; then add the almond oil and
set over a small, gentle flame. Just as it
begins to boll, put in the lettuce, which
must be oulv the tender inside leaves of
head lettuce and cut very fine. Let this
mixture simmer for ten minutes, when
the lettuce should be boiled down to soft
shreds.

here and there, fashion is forgotten on
very hot days, and the lawn, gingham or

a duc:k, crash or wool skirt. Longer
skirts prevail, although there is no criti
cism for those which are quite short.
TO REDUCE

MOW can one' naturally inclined to
grow stout reduce flesh?
Dr. John Beardsley, who has
been making some scientific exper
iments extending over his practice of
twenty-five years, says that exercise has
not so much to do with the matter as has
diet, and that both must betaken properly.
Exercise alone will increase the appe
tite and cause longer hours of sleeping
and so increase rather tha.n reduce flesh.
A diet of exclusively lean meat,
baked bread, tea, coffee and only vege
tables that are grown above the ground
will not increase the weight, but after a
month will diminish it.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
BEATRICE B. B.â Loose clothing,
cxerclae with the arms, plenty of
tepid baths and a diet of good, fat
tening foods, such as rice, butter,
potatoes, eggs, cereals, milk and game are
necessary to acquire development of the
bust. First of all, then, discard all pads
and be sure that the undergarments do
not confine at all. Then massage gently
with cocoanut oil, rubbing around and '
around with the palm of the hand until
the oil Is absorbed. Do this every night.
It wijl be at least eight weeks before any
development will be noticeable, but^lt will
surely come if/persisted In. To reduce the
size of stomach, take these exercises
night and morning: Lie flat on
the back upon the floor and raise
one knee and then the other ten
times in succession; then fold the arms
and raise the body to a sitting posture
ten times. Massage Is also excellent for
tfflfl purpose.

BIRDIE Y. Z.â Pour the oil into the
palm of the hand and rub with the palm
around and around and up, never down.
Do not pinch and knead the flesh, as
there is great danger of bruising: one
self, which might result seriously. Let
the rubbing be gentle and continue it
menu, but may add one vegetable grown
above the ground. Let him exercise gent
ly but not too vigorously, and exercise
the mind as well as the body, for an
excess of fat Is a certain indication of
not over exercise of the brain.
Sleep Is a great fat producer and must
not be over-Indulged In, six to eight hours
being the maximum. Hot baths tend to
make the body flabby and do not per
manently reduce fat. Cold baths, on the
contrary, do reduce fat. The fat is car
bonaceous and a cold bath, by lowering
the temperature of the body, uses suffi
cient carbon from the fat to raise the
temperature of the body to normal.
Warm clothing has the same effect as
hot baths and should be avoided by one
reducing his fat, as well in the form of
bed covering as in daily wear. Linen
being the best conductor of heat Is cool
est and so best to be worn.
Of exercise horseback riding, rowing
and fencing are the best, as they call
into use every muscle of the body.
Swimming in cold water Is doubly ef
fective, as It uses the carbon both In
exercise and to keep up the temperature
of the body.
This Is how the Delta Lighthouse of
Greenville, Miss., reported a local school
commencement:
"Public School No. 28, exercises passed
off quietly, though brilliant. Words are
Inadequate to express the Intrinsic value
of the exercise; but to the ladles con-
cerned, let the citizens congratulate you
upon your success. We witnessed the

Greenville public schools.
I until the oil Is absorbed. In other re
| spects you are carrying out directions
correctly. Rubbing the hollow places
! with the oil is all that is necessary, you
< need not pull the fle9h away from the
I body as you have been doing. Massag
; ing any part of the fleshy part of the
body with the oil should develop it, in
time. The rum and bitter apple is an
old-fashioned remedy, and may be effi
cacious. The rum is invigorating and the
bitter apple probably acts as a tonic. I
do not happen to know of any one who
has tried it. Now, for the fifth and sixth
questions. Once a day is quite often
1 enough to use soap on the face, and just
! before retiring is the better time. As
you are afflicted with blackheads, I would
advise a camelshair face scrubbing brush
in place of the coarse wash rag. You
! should also use a good pure cold cream
; upon your face each right rubbing it well
into the skin. As for your sixth ques
tion, after one has attained the desired
development, if the general health is good
and one does not lose flesh, there will be
no necessity to continue the treatment. If
i there are any more question you desire
i to ask. do so and I will cheerfully an
, swer them.
E. J.â Blushing, or flushing of the face,
; usually indicates a general perturbation
| of the health. It may arise from indlges-
I tion, poor circulation and very often from
, tight lacing. It Is also caused by nervous
ness and hysteria, because the small
vasomotor nerves which control and regu
i late the cutaneous blood vessels are dis
orderly In their action and relax and con
tract spasmodically. Take lots of walks;
take a good blood tonic; wear no tight
bodices or bandages; cat lots of fruit
such as pears, oranges and figs. Avoid
hot drinks; eat slowly and put the feet in
hot water every night. See to It that your
sleeping-room Is well ventilated. I know
no way of testing tooth powder except to
prepare It yourself.
MENA L.â l have never known of the
remedy you mention having the effect
that you describe. I should be so glad
to be rid of the trouble, for any length of
time that I should not worry about its
going any place else, at least not until
it got there. Don't believe everything the
croakers tell you.
MILLY G. M. â You can do your own
housework and still have presentable
hands, if you will take care of them.
Keep a lemon or tomato conveniently near
with wljieh to remove vegetable stains,
and If you can afford it, use castile soap
for dishwashing. Do not change the hands
suddenly, from hot to colfl water or from
cold to hot, and be careful always to dry
them thoroughly after taking them out
of water. Keep a pair of old gloves with
the t'ps of the fingers cut off to draw on
when handling coal or ashes or doing
rough work of any kind. Each night upon
retiring rub this cream well into the
hands: Cocoa butter, oil of sweet al
monds and refined white wax, equal parts.
The electric needle is the only permanent
cure for superfluous hair.
KATHIEâ To strengthen and make the
eyelashes grow use a tonic made of equal
parts of cocoanut oil and white vaseline.
ALICE SH.â Cleaning velvet is entirely
out of my line. If it were mine, I should
send it to a reliable cleaner.
EMMA D. â Follow treatment suggested
to Mrs. L. A. T.. only there need be no
pricking in your case. I do not qufto un
derstand whether it is blackheads or
whiteheads that you are troubled with.
Whichever they are do not squeeze them,
iis this irritates and inflames them, but
presi them gently out, when they are
ready to come. If they do not improve
under this treatment, write to me again.
T.oi'lSEâ l can suggest no way by
which the eyelids can be made thicker

rolce. My only suggestion to you In this
connection Is to modulate the voice when

trouble, to consult a specialist.
PATRICIA KIRKLANDâ If the spots
on the hands are freckles, use lemon juice
on them. If, however, they are in the
nature of moles, which I strongly suspect,
the coloring matter is deposited in the
deeper portion of the subcuticle, and
there is no remedy for them as they are
Impossible to reach.
MRS. C. T. WILLESâ If you will watch
these beauty talks you will very soon find
one upon the subject of massage in which
I will answer minutely the question that
you ask. I cannot very well give the
space to it to-day. There la positively
nothing better in the way of a skin food
than the orange flower skin food, formula
for which has been given several times
in these columns. Have you not seen it?
If not write to me again. I know of no
better way of restoring bleached hair to
Its natural color than just to let it grow
out. There are dyes that seem to do the
work without any harmful results, but I
cannot recommend them. The result
might be perfectly satisfactory in nine
cases and in the tenth case the hair be
utterly ruined.
GUSSIEâ Yes, the formula for skin food
given to "Belle" is the one that you wish.
I am quite certain that If you persist In

using It the "crow's feet" which are Just
beginning to come will pick up their dud 3
and depart. Merely applying the food,
however, will not bring about the desired
result. It must be thoroughly rubbed into
the -skin and be sure and rub across the
wrinkles, that is, in the opposite direc
tion to that which the wrinkles take.
GLADYS WADEâ Try the freckle lo
tion given In the beauty talk to-day. To
make the eyebrows thick, get an ounce of
alcohol and in it dissolve five grains of
quinine. Apply this every other night and
on the nights in between times massage
very gently with the fingers which have
been dipped In olive oil slightly warmed;
PEACHESâ I have heard that constant
applications of castor oil will remove
warts, but I do not postlvely know that
this is so. A lunar caustic pencil will re
move them. Touch the center of the wart
lightly with the pencil once a day. It will
turn black and gradually disappear. Great
care must be taken not to touch with the
caustic pencil the surrounding skin, else

27PLOWING IN THE RICE FIELDS' WITH THE CARABAO.
: A copy of which was sent to an American concern, who thought there was
business for steam plows in the Philippines. They don't think so now.
From "Yesterday In the Philippines," published by Scribner's.
WHILE much fault from a lite
rary point of view can be found
wi^h "Yesterdays in the Philip
pines," by Joseph Earle Ste
vens, there is no doubt that
the book is entertaining and bound to be
of a great deal of use in imparting a
knowledge cf the true state of things In
the domain that has Just come under our
Jurisdiction and to which so many Amer
icans will soon be hurrying.
Mr. Stevens was for two years a clerk
.'in the last American mercantile house in
Manila, that of Henry W. Peabody & Co.
' of Boston. He was compelled to live the
life of the people and also came into con
tact with all classes. His business and
pleasure took him into the rural districts,
where he had full opportunity of judging
of actual conditions. He certainly knows
the facts as they would appeal to an
American, and it is to be taken for grant
ed that he has set them before the reader.
: Jn opening his book Mr. Stevens gives
.his opinion as to the advisability of Amer
ica holding the Philippine Islands; but
the reader had better. Judge of that after
he has finished the last chapter.
As far as style goes Mr. Stevens' writ-
Ing is not what would be called "good."
It is careless and even flippant In certain
' paragraphs. Nevertheless, there is a
pithiness and directness about It that
holds the reader's attention from begin
ning to end. The language is simple, and
the scenes portrayed are all Interesting.
In short, the book is readable. And afrer
â¢ finishing it few, indeed, will be they who
Jind fault with the style. Indeed, most
readers will be likely to declare it tM
most interesting and instructive book of
travel that has_appeared in many a dry.
Mr. Stevens begins his account from
â¢ the time the steamer leaves San Fran
icieco, and describes all of interest on the
way across the Pacific. The big Pacific
Mai! steamer took him to Hongkong, from
where he took a small craft to his desti
â¢ nation.
The voyage from Hongkong to Manila,
700 miles to the southeast, he calls "one
of the very worst short ocean crossings
In existence." The boat has a "corft
screw motion" until It gets fairly under
the lee of Luzon. The h'rst view of Ma

The huge "punka," to make a breeze,
â which 1b a most Important article of fur
niture in every tropical establishment";
the precautions against damage from
earthquakes and typhoons â cloth Instead
of plaster walls and ceilings; no tiles on
the roofs â impressed him early. Down in
the "town." outside the city walls, the
buildings "all have an appearance of
feebleness and senility, and look as if a/
good blow or a heavy shake would lay
them fint." but in the old city, behind the
fortificationÃ, "are heavy buttressed build
ings of bygone days, built when it was
thought that earthquakes respected thick
â vvulls rather than thin, and the sturdy
buttresses so occupy the narrow sidewalks
that pedestrians must travel single file."
We already know much, however, of
Manila architecture, from recent news
paper pictures; of the situation of the
city, on the bay and Paslg: River, of old
Manila and the new town, and the cathe
dral.
Here is a statement of the population In
18P4:
As to the population, Manila, in the larger
sense, may hold 350,000 souls, beside* a few dogs.
Of the lot call 50.000 Chinese. 5000 Spaniards,
150 Germans, M) English and 4 Americans. The
rest are natives or half-castes of the Malay
type, whose blood runs in all mixtures of
Chinese. Spanish and what-not proportions,
and whose Chinese eyes, flat noses and high
cheekbones are queer accompaniments to their
Spanish accents. Thus the majority of the
bouls in Manila â like the dogs â are mongrels,
or mestizos, as the wurd Is, and the saying
goes that happy is the man who knows his own
father.
The traveler's first night In Manila was
not reassuring. In the Spanish hotel El
Oriente, Mr. Stevens made acquaintance
with the Philippine bed:
It Is a four-poster, with the posts extending
high enough to support a light roof, from
whose eaves hang copious folds of deep lace.
The bed frame Is strung tlrhtly across with
regular chair-bottom cane, and thÂ« only other
fittings are a piece of straw matting spread
over the cane, a pillow and a surrounding wall
of mosquito netting that drops down from th*Â»
roof and is tucked under the matting. How to
get into one of these cages was the first ques
tion that presented itself, and what to do with
myself after I got In was the second.
Breakfast consisted of a cup of thick
chocolate and a seedcake to sop it out
of the cup, blotting-paper fashion. He
began the first morning by ordering a
dozen suits of white sheeting from a na
tive tailorâ price. $2 50 each. Then he was
introduced at the English Club and began
to feel more comfortable:
The club affords shelter and refreshment to

STANFORD PARLOR'S ENTERTAIN-
MENT.
Last Wednesday night Stanford Parlor
of the Native Sons had a ladies' night
In Shasta Hall, Native Sons' building, and
as Shasta never does anything by halves
there is always a large attendance. Such
was the case on the night mentioned. The
hall was crowded and those who were
there included a number of army officers,
who had a rare treat. The chief feature
of the evening was a cake walk by five
couples, all attired In the richest of gaudy
silks and satins, and all the participants
concealed their identity with a mask of
burnt cork. ,
John J. McCarthy, president of the par
lor. Introduced as master of ceremonies
Frank H. Kerrigan, who explained his
position in one of the wittiest speeches
ever delivered before a fraternal organi
zation and he added much to the merri
ment of the evening by the manner in
which he introduced the candidates for
cake walk honors. These were Mrs. Par
ent and Phil Huer, who were to sing
"Ambolina Snow" and walk to the music
of that song; Mr. and Mrs. Seiberst,"Ma
Onliest One"; Mrs. Fred Lees and E. C.
Head as "The Wedding of the Chinee and
the Coon"; Mrs. Head and F.
Eckenroth, "All Coons Look Alike
to Me," and Mrs. Alvina Huer
and A. F. Schleichert as "My Lady
Jane." The singing and the dancing were
excellent, and each couple won much ap
plause and it was a difficult matter for
the judges to determine who were entitled
to first honors. They, after having "My
Lady Love" and "Ali Coons Look Alike
to Me" repeated, made the following
awards: The cake to "My Lady Love,"
the best costume "The Chinee and the
Coon " the best sustained character "My
Onliest One," best costume "My Lady
Love," best dancing "Ambolina Snow.
The prizes consisted of a live chicken,
sack of beans, side of bacon, cut glass
decanter, pair of shoes, dumbbells and
other useful articles.
The Judges announced that there was a
special prize of a dozen eggs for the mas
ter of ceremonies, to be delivered one at
a time by one of the best ball tossers at
some future time.
After that there was dancing and re
freshments including a watermelon feast.
The committee that had charge of the de
lightful affair was A. F. Schleichert, C.
H. Stanyan and J. W. Lewis.

There was a large attendance In Mission
Parlor Hall on the evening of the 19th

Las Lomas parlor, and it proved to be a
very enjoyable affair. Cascarones were
distributed during the grand march, and
after the battle of the eggs was closed
the egg throwers and the floor were cov
ered with bits of vari-colored paper. The
committee was composed of: Mrs. S. P.

The rooster Is the "native dog" of the

sometimes thrives in Manila, few houses
are too frail or poor to Include in their
furniture some kind of musical lnstru-

It is extremely curious that out of all the

only ones possessing a natural talent for mu

Early In his sojourn In Manila, Mr.
StevehÃ, for $4 50 per month, hired a man
to serve as valet. He was useful and
supported a small family and a fighting
cock on his wages. Laundry work is
cheap, and for two gold dollars a month
he could turn over to his laundryman as
much as he pleased:
Two full BUlts of whit* sheeting clothes

mean dimensions, and yet the lavandero turn*

standing knee-deep in the rtvar whanging my
trousers from over his head down onto a flat
stone, I fear for seams and button*, noth
ing appears to suffer. And, although he builds
a small bonfire in a brass flatlron that looks
like a warming pan and runs it over my white
coats all blazing aÂ» it Is, the result Is excel
lent and one's linen seems better laundered
than In the mills that grind away at home.
Tobacco is very cheap, too, and Mr.
Stevens thinks well of it:
Manila's best cigar, made of a special, se
lected tobacco, wrapped in the neateet silver
foil and packed in rosewood boxes, tied with
Spanish ribbon, costs about 6 cents, and Is
considered a rare delicacy. One scarcely ever
sees these cigars, the "Incomparables," outside
of the city itself, and the brand is so choice
that but few smokers are acquainted with it.
The foreigner In Manila thinks he Is paying
dear for his weed at $20 per thousand, and
some of our professional smokers limit them
selves to those favorite â¢â¢Bouquets," which
correspond to our "two-for-a-quarter" vari
ety, but sell here for $1 80 a hundred. Below
these upper grades come a various assort
ment of cheaper varieties. Including the cher
oots, big at one end and small at the other,
and the three-dollar-a-thousand cigars, which
are made of the first thing that comes handy,
to be sold to the crews of deep water mer
chantmen. A native of the Philippines wants
his cigarette, and gets tt. Packages of thirty
are sold on almost every corner for a couple
of coppers, and to my mind the Manila ci
garette Is far superior to the variety found in
Cuba. Smoking is, of course, encouraged by
prices such as these and one finds it perfectly
good form to borrow a cigarette, as well as a
light, from his neighbor In the tram car or
on the plaza. Even on the toll bridge which
spans the Paslg you pay your copper for cross
ing, and get In change a box of matches, and
If you are queer enough not to want the
matches the man will give you Instead a ticket
that avails for the return trip.
Ants and cockroaches abound, and so
do rats. The Philippine cats are feeble
creatures. Their place as rat catchers is
cheerfully filled by snakes:
Nearly all of the older bungalows In Ma
nila possess what are called house snakes:
huge reptiles generally about 12 or 14 feet long
and as thick as a fire engine hose, that per
manently reside up In the roof and live otr the
rats. These big creatures are harmless, and
rarely, if ever, leave their abodes. Judging
from the noise over my cloth celling, a pair
of these pets find pasturage above, and I can
hear them whacking around about once a
week In their chase after rats. They are good
though noisy rat catchers, their efficiency ap
pears to be limited to their length of stomach.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The only way to get rid of the rats
seems to be to buy more snakes, and this is
simple enough, for you often see the natives
hawking them around In town, the boas curled
up around bamboo poles, to which their beads
are tied.
Here is a bit about native women:
Orinda Parlor of the Native Daughters

The costumes worn by the women are far

around and tucked into the belt In front, the
short white waist that, at times divorced from
the skirt below, has huge flaring sleeves of plna
fiber, which shows the arms, and the costly
plna handkerchief, which, folded on the diag

often go without stockings, and Invariably
walk as If they were carrying a pall of water
on their heads. They generally chew betel
nuts, which color the mouth an ugly red;
smoke cigars and put so much cocoanut oil on
their straight, black hair that it Is not pleas
ant to get to leeward of them In an open tram

of maziy children and often play well on the
harp.

back and forth before Cavite
five times at a distance of c.

has the same air of plausible unreality as
the stories that flow with equal ease and
velocity from the pen of Archibald Clav

The heroineâ "Queen of the Streetâis
a great operator in stocks, aad, hand in
glove with Senators, she is able to specu
late with safety, making fabulous sums in
sugar and oil. Incidentally she makes
and mars the fortunes of adventurous
and penniless young men.
One of the Senators, hitherto a vague,
unseen entity, appears like the ghost at
the banquet. He proves to be the hus
band who deserted thl6 wonderful woman
and their infant daughter many years be
fore in the far West. She had put her
baby in an asylum, from which it had
been adopted, while she taught school and
staked a claim that made her rich. A
change of name and the conquest of wall
street and New York society followed
easily. The husband had also changed his
name and won fame and fortune, which
he now wished to unite with hers against
her will.
In the meantime the mother has mirac
ulously recovered her long lost daugh
ter, who, of course, is a rarely beautiful
and cultured woman. The father wishes
to possess her, and to prevent this the
mother hides her in remote places in Eu
rope, while she takes a flying trip around
the world to put the villain off the scent.
He dies opportunely while holding an
Interview with the "Queen of the Street,"
and is mourned only by a mysterious
ward. The heroine then retires to pri
vate life and marries an obscure person
age, while the daughter marries another.
All who have done wrong are terribly
punished and those who have done well
are suitably rewarded.

Joe Kerr and his writings are so well

The sentiment of all his poems Is ex

Many of the poems are uproariously

BRIEF HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA.
By Theodor* H. HittÂ«ll.
The first volume of this work is Just
from the press, and a careful perusal of
it shows t"hat It Is worthy of a high place
in educational literature. Richard D.
Faulkner, principal of the Franklin Gram
mar School. San Francisco, has written
the Introduction to the book and also sup
plied some suggestive correlations.
Principally the work is intended for
school use, but will also prove a high
class work of reference for the broauer
phases of the history of the State. It be
gins with the discovery of California, and
contains concise accounts of the early
voyages to the coast. The establishment
of the missions is handled in a broad
way, and the principal facts are so ar
ranged as to be readily accessible and at
the same time show other important
events that hinge on them.
Mr. Faulkner is an old educator ana
has found the method on which he has
arranged Mr. Hittell's history of Califor
nia very advantageous In his work in the
past. Published by the Stone Educational

Longmans, Green & Co. will shortly publish a

that "Pickle, the Spy" was Glengarry.
Charles Scribner's Sons have arranged with
A. Constable &*Co. of London tn bring out a
library edition of the novels of Henry Fielding.
It will be strictly limited in number, and Eng
lish hand-made paper will be used. Edmund
Gosse wil! write an Introductory essay for the
work, and no pains will be spared to secure a
scholarly and accurate text. The first two vol
umes will be ready in September.
The Commercial Advertiser writes: "So the
Chap-Book is dead, and the theory on which it
was founded has been again discredited In prac
tice. So far as we have observed there are no
mourners, and as to the numerous Imitator*
that for a time sprang up and flourished, prac
tically all of them died of marasmus long ago.
The literary world, therefore, will go right
along as though nothing had haDpened: and. In
fact, nothing of any consequence has hap
pened."
The fine editions of standard authors that
Charles Scribner's Sons are bringing out or
will bring out in the near future form quite a
feature by themselves. Those now appearing,
or about to appear, at the rate of one or two
volumes a fortnight, are "The Works of George
Meredith," "The Works of Henry Fielding."
"The Poetical and Prose Works of Lord By
ron " (the only complete and authorized edi
tion), "The Waverley Novels of Sir Walter
Scott" (the Temple edition). "The Works of
Charles Plokens" (the Gadshlll edition). "ThÂ« ,
Works of Thomas Carlyle" 'the Centenary cdi- .J
tlon). Besides those are the standard subscrtp-
tlon editions of "The New Authorized Edition
of Charles Dickens" (to be completed in thirty
four volumes), "The Homestead Edition of
James Whltcomb Rlley" (ten volumes).
A new method of preserving: wood
from decay, known as the Haskin pro
cess, is being tried on a large scale in
England. Instead of withdrawing the
sap and injecting creosote or some oth
er antiseptic substance, as is usually
done, Mr. Hasklns submits the wood
to superheated air, under a pressur*
of fourteen atmospheres. By this pro-"
cess. It is. averred, the sap is chemi
cally changed into a powerful antisep
tic mixture, which, by consolidating
with the fiber, strengthens as well as
preserves the wood.

THE NEW THEATERS
ij. wui ue a pieasani revelation to
the many friends of T. Daniel
Frawley to know that to that
quiet, unassuming gentleman Is
. due the credit of bringing about a
renaissance In one of the Important
branches of dramatic art-
Half a generation ago every city of
Consequence In this country had Its one
. or more brilliant and successful stock
companies, through the medium of
which the public were afforded oppor
tunities to enjoy the talents of the
greatest stars of the day. The system,
however, gradually went into decay,
and was finally relegated to the realm
of memory by the aggressive and cap- j
tivating traveling organization. Less j
than three years ago the decline of the j
popularity of the stock companies had I
reached such a stage that there were I
no organizations of the kind playing j
In repertoire at first-class prices, and j
the system was supposed to be dead.
In 1594 in this city the idea was con- 1
celved of trying an experiment on the
public by organizing and conducting a
stock company on the old lines. Messrs.
Frawley and Friedlander, Gottlob &
Co. had the courage of their convictions
and the enterprise was launched. It
met with popular favor. Capable peo
ple were engaged, budding genius was
encouraged and Introduced to the world
dramatic. The best of the old and the
new plays in comedy and drama were
presented In the most excellent style,
thus giving the people a highly appre
ciated variety. The enterprise pros- I
pered. The performances were com- I
pared with the work of the best travel- :
Ing organizations and not infrequently i
the comparison proved the genuine ;
merit of the home company. San Fran- I
ciscans became proud of the Fraw- j
ley company and enamored of the !
many sterling actors and actresses it
Introduced to them. Its success and
fame gradually spread throughout the :
West.. and East until the force of ex
ample had its effect.
At that time there were stock com
panies in New York, such as Dan
Frohman's Lyceum aggregation, but
they were organized to present one i
play to be run to a finish, which often
â¢meant a year or more, and when a new
.-.'attraction was to be presented a new
..set. of people was selected to play it.
Eastern managers were convinced that
the successful conduct of a stock com
pany, presenting a new bill each week
at the tap prices was practically im
possible. But Mr. Frawley"s triumph
ant progress along those old lines
brought a change over the spirit of
their "theories, until now the revival of
the system is an established fact, and
strange to say it appears thus far to
have resulted in no material diminu
tion of the business of the standard
combinations.
The transformation has been a marked
one. During the past season in the
I'.nited States there were in existence
,f >>r the "whole or part thereof fifty or
ganizations styling themselves stock
companies and conducted under the old
system. The majority of them played
to popular prices, and not a few met
with most signal success, the public
taking to the change quite readily. This
was the case in Boston, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Kan
â¢ ity and Los Angeles, while in
Chicago four houses were engaged in
the renaissance during a part of the
season at least.
As an indication of the high stand
ing of the Frawley Company in the
effete East it may be stated that he has
more offers of first-class bookings than i
lie can accept.
. The company at the close of Its suc
cessful season here will play the coast
and- then work eastward into the field
that has so long been regarded as the
private preserve of the promoters of
â traveling combinations.
. Here's hoping you may return to us
crowned with the laurels of victory,
M-r. Frawley.

New York, where the play ran for 100
nights.
The Master" Is said to be a picture of
domestic life far more true to nature
than those usually depicted. The part
played by Mr. Miller is that of a father,
Thomas Faber, who. without consulting
any one else, haa planned out the future
of his son and daughter to suit himself,
and suddenly awakens to find that it ie
utterly different from what they desire, or
what their mother, who is their confidant
and sympathizer, wishes for them. Fa
ber s domineering nature, both In his busi
ness and his household, has won for him
the sobriquet of "The Master," but the
playwright, even In the first act, at the
end of which Faber casts out his son for
disobeying him in joining the army and a
daughter for preferring the man of her
choice to the one he wishes her to marry,
a' lo ws certain love traits to shine
through.
He 13 truly a man of sterling qualities
ana deep affection underneath his auto- !
cratlc ways, which seem rather the result
of the rule or ruin policy of the modern
business world than of ah innate tyranni
cal disposition. The gradual softening of
Faber s nature through misfortune, aided

children is the study which Mr. Ogilvle

The reorganized stock company will be
gin the new season to-morrow night. The
attraction will be Henry Guy Carleton's
comedy, "The Butterflies," a play that
i Is familiar to the theater-goers of this
i city. The story is founded on the love- [
making complications and the monetary j
embarrassment of two proud families.
It is well told, the situations are very j
taking and the dialogues bright. The i
new company should be able to present i
"Butterflies" In a most acceptable man- !
ncr, embracing as It does several well- [
known and capable people, among whom â¢
are Earnest Hastings, former leading ;
man of the Lyceum Theater, New York,
and Miss Gretchen Lyons, previously
leading woman to Richard Mansfield. Mr.
Hastings will play the part in which
John Drew made a success. Miss Ly
ons is to assume the roll of Marion.

to be stronger and brighter. Of all Frank
Harvey's exciting plays it is said to be
one of the most thrilling, and there is not

The melodramatic situations are relieved
of heaviness by the exceptionally bright
comedy vein that is judiciously distrib

The play is naturally an illustration of
the perversity of men and women, in
which the sins and virtues of the various
characters are displayed under a bright

light. It is in four acts, and the scenic
features will be very elaborate, as shown
by the fact that there are five scenes in
the third act. The cast will be a strong
one. Including Max yon Mitzel, Fred I.
Butler, Landers Stevens, Leslie Morosco,
Bert Morrison, Lorena Atwood, Jessie
Shirley and Lillian Elliott
Jhe Orpheum.
This popular vaudeville house offers five
new acts for the coming week, and it is
claimed that suc-j a greal bill has not
been provided for a long time. The added
features range from trained dogs to high
comedy and grand opera selections by
famous artists. Barney Fagan and Hen
rietta Byron stand par excellence in
their line as comedian and soubrette, re
spectively. The Pasqualis, late of the
Royal Theater Bellini of Palermo, Italy,
made their American debut with the
Damrosch' Symphony Orchestra and later
were with the Scalchl Concert Company.
They will appear in the garden scene from
"Faust," in costume. The signor has a
great tenor voice and the signora a so
prano of wide musical range and
sympathetic quality. Charles T. Al
drien, the famous eccentric come
dian and comic Juggler, has re
turned from his London success. He is
regarded as the very best comic Juggler
on the vaudeville stage. Another novelty
will be the act done by Sadi, the Russian
gymnast, whose work, it is said, excels
anything In that line ever seen at the Or
pheum. Charles Baron and his perform
ing Great Danes will positively appear
this week. The dogs do a very funny act,
dressed up as lions, in which Mr. Baron
puts them through all sorts of tricks. The
holdovers include Charles Case, the fa
vorite monologist; McÃrlde and Good
rich, In clog dances and songs; the Hegel
mans, the greatest aerial artists In the
world, and the blograph, with new war

In congenial roles in Mr. Clement's "The
New Dominion."
The electrical display of the New Com
edy Theater, which will light the en
tire section of the northern part of the
city, will show an outlay of $1500. A spe
cial night will be set aside, prior to the
opening, when the illumination will be
given to the public.
"Zaza," the play in which Rejane is
appearing at the Paris Vaudeville, deals
with the affairs of a disreputable concert
hall singer. The American rights have
been purchased, but they are likely to ue
of little value unless the play is thorough
ly disinfected before presentation here.
There Is already a large demand for the
Modjeska season, which is to open at the

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 27.â The bears manifested
considerable confidence that a reaction in the ,
prices of stocks was due to-day, and they sold
at the opening advance and carried prices at j
one time materially below last night's close. |
They had on their side a disposition by many
holders to take profits, but the demand was so
considerable as to absorb all offerings at the
decline and the bears were forced to cover quite
heavily, lifting prices sharply above the lowest
and In many cases above last night. The drop ;
In Sugar at the opening was an unsettling fac- j
tor and a determined drive against People's
Gas finally knocked off lVs from the price of
that stock. It was evident also that there was
an abundant supply of stocks of the granger ;
and of Northern Pacific to be had on any con- ;
siderable advance in prices. The opening high
prices were partly manipulated for purposes of
realizing prices of Americans having been ad
vanced in London by cabled orders from New
Tort A number of prominent stocks showed '
vigorous resistance to the declining market, ;
and were potent factors in effecting the rally.
Most conspicuous of these were the Union Pa- .
cities The common rose 1H on j demand ajiÂ«l
â Old down nearly a point on the reacting. The
recovery carried it up an extreme 1%, â  The
preferred stock was firm above last night s
figures Denver and Rio Grande preferred [
showed continued strength, as did Southern ;
Railway preferred, Erie nrst preferred, Norfolk ,
and Western preferred and the Wabash securi- |
ties The heavy decrease in the surplus reserve
or the banks was an unsettling inlluence in the
late trading. The closing was somewhat Irregu
lar some stocks showing effects of renewed
buying, while others suffered from continued j
profit taking. - ' \
Railway bonds were active to-day and closed j
rather feverish at reactions In the speculative ,
issues. The stock market has pone through >
an extensive process of liquidation of profits :
during the week and has demonstrated such
a firm basis of underlying strength as to have ,
encouraged the re-entry Into stocks of many of j
the influential financial interests who had sold '
out to the public after having manipulated the
rise to the extreme point they considered possl- ;
bit. But the week's events have shown that
outside speculations were waiting to take stocks
at any marked recession In prices. It also i
Bhowed that the profit taking had resulted In j
the actual digestion. of larger amounts of dlvi- ;
dend paying stocks and bonds and the conse- i
quent reduction of the floating supply In the I
market. The active return in interest and
dividends make these attractive investments
while money continues cheap.
To-day's bank statement shows that the
amount of the increase in loans has been more ;
than withdrawn from the deposit account. It
has. In fact, been diverted to the United States
treasury, and there have not been sufficient
Government bonds available for the banks to
offer security to maintain the Government
money on depoplt. The result Is a loss of cash
amounting to $3,590,800. although New 'York
banks have had net receipts In the Interior
currency movement during the week. The con
sequence Is a decline In the surplus of $7.4*5,
9*.n. If the demand from the Interior for mov
ing crops should rise to normal proportions
surplus reserves would have to be promptly
replenished from some source.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. Aug. 27â The New York Fi
nancier says this week: The statement of the
associated banks of New York City for the
week ending August 27 shows a shrinkage in
surplus reserve of nearly seven and a half mil
lion dollars, bringing the excess cash down to
$21,344,300, a decrease of forty-one millions since
June 25 last. The statement was about as was
anticipated, reflecting as It does the operations
of the banks with the treasury on bond ac
count. As the settlement hus not yet been com
pleted, and the flow of money from the inter
ior has practically ceased and should give place
shortly to a movement in the opposite direc
tion for crop purposes tiieve seems to be no
doubt that money will harden temporarily. In
fact, indications In this direction are now plen
tiful. But whether an advance in rates will be
of long duration Is doubtful. The money locked
up in the treasury may be counted a reserve
since it can be made available through deposi
tory banks, and the prospect of continued gold
Imports presents Itself the moment that New
York becomes a profitable field for idle capi
tal due this country on balance. The interior
movement has really begun, and the small bal
ance that New York banks gained on account
during the week came from near by cities. One
feature that Is causing embarrassment is the
email supply of legal tenders which the banks
hold, their reserves consisting ol" nearly 75 per
cent gold. Leitals are lower than since 1593,
and the banks need all they hold. This makes
th"c shipment of gold to the Interior Imperative,
and as the operation Is expensive It Is having
a retarding effect. The treasury department
has been appealed to by some advocating the
resumption of gold certificates. This Is not met
with encouragement, but relief has been prom
isej in other ways so that crop money may
begin to move rapidly from now. It is a dis
puted question whether the West will need
as much money a? anticipated for this pur
pose. Until this is definitely known the money
market will be rather uncertain, although firm
er In tone. The current statement has been
influenced by the operations of a few large
banks, one Institution reiÂ«Ttlng near the whole
loss In deposits and almost half the loss In
cash. The st"ck exchange transactions are prob
ably responsible for the loan expansion, but
mercantile demands are a considerable factor.

lnn.l and iep".rt!Â« cf failure of the wheat crop
In one of the grain producing provinces of Rus
sia were given as. reasons for the Liverpool
quotations of wheat, showing an advance of
from %d for September to %d for December.
The advance on the other side, where a decline
had been confidently looked for. was the prin
cipal reason for higher prices at the opening
here. Behind the improvement at Liverpool
there was the still abiding cause of anxiety to
short sellers for September In the existing
scarcity of the grain In ; commercial channels.
Comparatively heavy. receipts In tho Northwest
was the qualifying condition of affairs at the
'tart that the bears took comfort from and
prevented any thins like , panic among them
trom the disturbingly small amount of store.
The week's shipments of wheat and flour from
both coasts was reported at 3,563.475. bushels,
compared to 3,085,000 bushels the previous
work. The .total receipts at Western primary
markets waa 733,000 bushels, compared with 1,

left off with a gain of. %c and December 54c

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â The Evening Post's
London fi-nancial cablegram says: Considering
that the settlement Is to begin on Monday next
the stock market here to-day was decidedly
firm. Americans were again notably strong,
the feature being the rise In Wabaah. Union
Pacific and Denver and Rio Grande aharew. It
is expected that the settlement will show a
much larger account in Americans, the amount
carried for Uerlln being decidedly large. Con
tanKoes, however, probably will be light, be
cause of eaj>y money. The strength of Brazils
nnd Argentines continues. Silver Is lower. It
Is said In good quarters that the Spanish orders
have come to an end for the present, Spain
having Imught over 10,000 pounds of silver. So
much speculation is going on in silver, how
ever, that all reports are unreliable.

by the searchlight upon Morro Castle.]
â¢ CHAPTER VI.
THE shots fired by the Spanish sen
tinels at Ned were not noticed by
General Linares and his friends as
they feasted. Firing took place
. every hour during the day and
night and the sentinels did not call the
. attention of any officer to the log
which, unknown to them, had carried
Ned to safety with Harry Ostend's mes
sage to Admiral Sampson. But Binnie
heard the reports of the rifles and went
down to the water's edge and saw the
log tt.iat away. He then went into the
prison, and there, for the first time, saw
Harry Ostend! Did Harry Ostend see
through Binnie's disguise? If he did
ho was too shrewd to show it.
It was just midnight when the deep
Bllence of the prison was broken. The
sleepy sentinels wer; glad to hear the
approaching footsteps of other sol
diers who were to take their places on
duty. The iron door of the prison was
opened and the jailer appeared.
"Watch the spy in cell 42," he said
to a sentinel. "He will be out of our
way to-morrow night."
"He will be ?"
â¢ "Shot at sunrise. Ramirez has fur
nished all the proof that General Li
nares needed to show that the man in
42 is Ostend, the greatest of all the
American spies."
"Is not that Ramirez coming?"
"Yes. What does he wish here. I
wonder?"
Ramirez received the salute of the
Jailer and handed him an order signed
by General Linares to permit the bear
er to speak with Ostend. Treacherous
to 'the last, Ramirez had come to get
Harry Ostend to give him a large sum
of money to save his life, and this
when he knew that Ostend would be
shot at sunrise.
' "Open the door of Ostend's cell and
give, me the key." Ramirez com
. manded.
The jailer hesitated.
"At once, I say."
His manner awed the Jailer, who
. handed the key to Ramirez. Harry
Ostend looked up as the key grated in
tho lock of his cell door and saw
Ramirez and knew that this was the
man who had caused him to be seized.
His anger was great, but he controll
ed It.
"Ostend," said Ramirez as he enter
ed the cell, "you will be shot at sunrise
tOTmorow unless "
"Unless what?" The words were
. paid bo coolly that Ramirez was sur-
" prised. â 'â -'*''. i
' "I am a poor man, Harry Ostend.
' You can get all the American money
â¢' you wish for. Ten thousand dollars Is
.: riot a large sum." "
â¢-. ."For that sum will you promise
safety to me?" .
"Yes I am Ramirez, â  the secret
â ! agent of the King. I give you my
â¢word that ten thousand dollars in gold
"will buy your freedom and safe con
"â¢..duct to the American lines."
â¢ ' ."Suppose that I refuse?"
'fYou will die at sunrise. But, per
â¢ haps, you will feel happy to know that
' you will have company when you face
the soldiers who will fire upon you."
" "I do not understand." .
'â¢â¢ Ramirez laughed, but his face was
-.cruel. Had Ned been captured? This
thought flashed through Harry Os
tend's mind. He had no confidence in
the promises of Ramirez. "Perhaps,"
he .thought, "I may be able to fool this
rascal." i â¢" ~~~~ ."-- - â-, r*M -::-v-
Ramirez looked at Harry Ostend sus
piciously. "Come; time presses; your
â¢ answer at once."
"You shall have the money." â â 
"â Where is it?-' â¢' l:;:j:
"Take me out of this prison and I
.will guide you to it."
Ramirez, cowardly as treacherous,
â¢ dated not trust himself alone with Har
: ry Ostend without shackling his hands.
â¢ "As you wish," said Mr. Ostend.
,;â  Ramirez did not find it difficult to
bribe the jailer to let him pass # with
: his prisoner, especially when he had
produced enough sparkling gold to fur
. nish hush money for the sentinels, who
had not been paid for many months.
Accompanied by Harry Ostend, Rami
rez went out, promising the Jailer to
â¢ return soon with his prisoner. The iron
.gate of the prison clanged behind them
and they were in a narrow street,
which was darkened by the shadow of
the high wall of the prison.
. "In which direction?" asked Rami
rez.
"In this!" answered a voice from the
darkness, and a lithe form shot toward
Ramirez with the quickness of thought.
One terrific blow and Ramirez was
felled to the ground. The assailant
leaped upon the prostrate form of the
villain and thrust a pistol into his face.
"One word, Ramirez, and you die!"
"The American! Binnie! Spare me!"
"Not another word. It is Binnie.
You know that my promises are good.
One sound nr word to attract the guard
and you will die!"
; Ramirez was thoroughly cowed and
terrified. Here was another witness to
his treachery.
"I will obey," he -whispered. "Spare
my life."
Harry Oatend now held Binnie's pis
tol pointed at Ramirez's head. Bln
nle felt in the rascal's pockets and
found the key to open the shackles.
"Now to get Julia out of the prison,"
eaid Binnie, as soon as Harry Ostend
was free.
"Julia here!"
"Yes. We came here to take care of
Ramirez. We were going to tell the
story of the death of a certain Spanish
captain, who was shot by Ramirez.
Since we find you here and about to be
shot â at sunrise to-morrow â we must
change our programme and get out of
the city with the aid of Ramirez."
THE BUMPKINS HAVE NOW STARTED UPON A VERY PERILOUS AND QUEER VOYAGE TO JOIN ADMIRAL DEWEY fIND H^ FLEET OF GALLANT "JAC^IES" IN THE BAY OF MONILO.
BOYS` AND GIRLS` PAGE
"Wonderful boy, you are, Binnie; but
how to get Julia out of the Jail?"
"I will have Ramirez sign an order
for me to bring her to General Linares.
The rest will be easy!"
The three were not noticed by the
groups of soldiers in the city. Harry
Ostend led the way to a small cottage
and finding the key under the door,
went in. Ramirez was too bewildered
and crushed in spirit to dare to o*-
fer any resistance. He penned the or
der and Binnie departed on his mis
sion. Ten, fifteen, twenty minutes
passed. Harry Ostend sat with pistol
pointed at Ramirez, intently listening.
Half an hourâ then footsteps were
heard. Binnie entered and with him
was Julia.
At the sight of the girl Ramirez shook
with fear and his teeth chattered.
Binnie had said that Ramirez had shot
the Spanish captain; here was the wit
ness who must have seen that cruel and
cowardly act, and her eyes were look-
Ing at the traitor so keenly that they
seemed to be reading his cv ry secret.
He quailed before her glance, bJt was
silent.
Harry Ostend went to a cupboard and
took therefrom a Spanish uniform.
"During my residence in Santiago de
Cuba," he said, while a sir/'.e played
over his face, "I have gathered many
things that might be of use. This uni
form will about fit Julia."
"What? I wear a Spanish uniform?"
"Certainly. You will make a capital
soldier. Hasten now; for we must be
out of the city before daylight and far
off in the hills. It is a desperate ad
venture, but here are three friends who
may be useful to Cuba if we can es
cape."
Julia soon reappeared from another
room, wearing the uniform. Tall and
erect, she looked very soldierlike.
"Come now," said Harry Ostend, who
naturally assumed command of the
party, "the jailer will soon be uneasy,
and our time is short. Ramirez, do not
forget that we are all armed and that
we are all dead shots. Your duty is to
appear to be in command. We will fol
low you and you will give the proper
word to pass us through the city and
beyond the forts. You will go wherever
we go and be useful to us. March!"
"But, Senor, if I obey you I will be
shot for this night's work."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 1898.
"You ought to have thought of that
before you came to the prison to extort
money from me for a service which
you never meant to perform."
"I cannot understand how it was that
Binnie should have been there to take
me a prisoner," protested the crushed
spy.
Binnie lÂ»ughe<3 Joyously. He had so
far won the day and although there
were many perils to be encountered
before the party could get out of the
city he felt happy and, it must be con
fessed, a little bit proud.
"You do not know how interested I
am in your movements, Ramirez. I
saw you in the city and I made it my
business to find out what new kind ot
wickedness you were engaged in. I
followed you to the prison and.w&4t3<l
for you to come out. Upon nry word
you have given me a delightful sur
prise. You think that you may be shot
by the Spaniards for the work of this
night. That is no more than you de
serve; but let me assure you that it
will not be safe for you to attempt to
play us any tricks."
No one could be more fully aware
than was Ramirez that Binnie's words
were not idle threats. He led the way
by the shortest route to the east gate
to the city. The party was halted at
short intervals, for the city was divid
ed into districts, and 1 was necessary
to have different passwords to go on.
Ramirez never was at a loss for the
right word. At the end of an hour they
were Hearing the last line of
who guarded the line of rifle pits in the
outer defenses of the city. Just as Ra
mirez advanced to give the word there
was a stir. From sentinel to sentinel
the call passed along â "turn out the
guard."
Hot on the heels of this din came
a thunder of horses' hoofs. In the
half light of approaching dawn an
officer on horseback drove up and
quickly demanded information whether
a party of four had been allowed to
pass through the lines at that point. So
the escape had already become known,
and the situation was critical
for the three ra-triots and for Ramirez.
Julia alone was equal to the occasion.
Relying upon her uniform and her
adroitness to carry the day, sho stepped
briskly forward and saluted the officer.
"Well," he said, inquiringly, "what
is It?"
"I think that I can guide you to
where they are through the lines."
"It is well," said the unsuspicious of
ficer. "Lead the way."
"But, Captain," went on Julia boldly,
"there are four of them and they have
undoubtedly separated by this time to
increase their chances of escape. I can
point you out two sharp men who can
flnd the fugitives If any one in Cuba
can."
"Bring them at once. We will then
be four to four. If we catch the ras
cals you shall share the reward. One
of the persons who has escaped is
Harry Ostend, the American spy. They
were helped out of prison by Ramirez.
Ah, if I could only catch the villain,
Ramirez, fortune would be mine."
Julia pointed out Binnie and Harry
Ostend as sharp men to find the fugi
tives. They were given horses, and
almost quicker than the fact can be
told they were merrily riding out of
the city, realizing what a wonderful
escape they had had at the last min
ute; and now they are speeding
through the country. As for Ramirez,
who has been left behind, he knew that
his only chance for safety was to get
by the sentries unknown. The dan
gers were thickening around him rapid
ly and he began to understand how
dangerous and foolish it is to be a trai
tor. D. H. W.

THE DOUBLE
BIRTHDAY
BY CHARLES ELMtR UPTON.
PLACERVILLL.
IT should have been Monday; but,
then, Mattie always was in a hurry,
and, besides, there was Joy enough
to last over into the next day.
And you couldn't keep her quiet.
She was all motion, from the merry
brown eyes that answered every laugh
to the sturdy little feet that skipped
about untiringly from morning till
night.
For a week past there had been a
constant prattle of parties, dinners and
toys without number. Everybody,
from papa and mama down, had been
told of the coming wonders at least
a dozen times; yet each showed the
greatest surprise whenever the subject
was spoken of. Now it was Sunday,
and even Matties ready brain could
think of nothing new, though her
tongue could still have rattled on for
hours had there been any one to listen.
But this Sunday was a busy day, for
rains had delayed the outdoor work on
the farm and every moment of sunny
weather was precious. I don't know
what Mattie would have done had not
something very unexpected appeared.
This was a visitor, a young man who
often came to Majiie's house. He was
very fond of children, and soon he and
Mattie were talking away at a great
rate.
"You don't know what I'm going to
have?" Mattie said, looking up slyly.
"What is it? Won't you tell me?"
coaxed Mr. Wallace.
But Mattie shook her head. "I'll be
six years old, and it's to-morrow. Now
guess."
Mr. Wallace scowled and pretended
to be thinking very hard. "It isn't a
birthday, is it?" he asked.
"Why, it is, too! It's my birthday!
Ha! ha! ha! you can't guess nothin'!"
And Mattie went off into such a funny
peal of laughter that the visitor
couldn't help joining.
"Six years old!" exclaimed Mr. Wal
lace. "My, what a big girl you are."
"Most as big as mama," added Mat
tie, looking down at her toes. "An*
maybe I'll be bigger. She don't grow
at all. Say, what makes old folks
never grow?"
"H-m! Well â they don't have time,
I guess," said Mr. Wallace.
"Oh!" said Mattie. and for a while
sat perfectly still. Suddenly she burst
out.
"Say, I guess old Liar had lots o'
time to play!"
"Old who?" asked the astonished vis
itor.
"Old Liar; 'cause he growed an'
growed an' growed till he was as big
as â as the whole world, I guess. An*
he was bad all the time, and he killed
poor Davy. No, no! Davy killed he!"
and Matties eyes blinked excitedly.
Mr. Wallace threw back his head and
laughed long and loudly, while Mattlo
stared in surprise, not seeing any
cause for such queer behavior.
He stopped presently, red in the face,
though his mouth was yet smiling aa
he said gently:
"You little rogue! You mean Go
liath."
"Yes, yes! Go-llar! That's him!
What do you think? I'm going to have
a cake!"
"You don't mean It!" cried Mr. Wal
lace, opening his eyes wide. "And can
I have some?"
"All you want," answered Mattie
generously, jumping up from her chair
and dancing about in excitement. "It's
.got choc'late In it an' sugar an' candy
an' little frizzes all on top. It's gooder
than any o' your cake, ain't it?"
EDITED BY
DAVID H. WALKER
"Well, I should say It was!" said the
visitor, with a whistle of astonishment.
"And it's all your very own?"
Mattie nodded gleefully. "Every
teenty bit! An' mama an' me made
it all our own selfs. Nobody else
didn't help one speckâ there, now!"
"Whew!" said Mr. Wallace, looking
as if he would like to get up and dance,
too. "Then there's the party"â
"An' I'll get my table an' my cupa
an' saucers, nen we can have a really,
truly dinner, an* I'll 'vite you an' papa
an' mama an' "â" â
"And dolly," put in Mr. Wallace.
"Yes, dolly, too," agreed Mattie, "an'
â an' â lots more."
Just then Mr. Wallace looked up and
saw Matties mama in the doorway.
"Excuse my leaving you alone, Mr.
Wallace. But there's so much work
now that one hardly knows where to
begin. I'm afraid Mattie is tiring
you."
"Not at all, Mrs. Stanton," answered
the visitor. "Mattie and I have been
having a very pleasant little chat."
It grew late and Mr. Wallace arose
to leave.
"You can't go home," said Mattie,
catching hold of his hands.
"You had better stay to supper, Mr.
Wallace," said Matties mama. "Mat
tie will be disappointed if you don't
taste her birthday cake."
Mr. Wallace stayed; and bo It hap
pened that Mattie had two birthdays
in one.
The table was soon set and the won
derful cake placed where it could be
seen and admired by all. Then papa
was called in from the field; then came
brother Tom, aged 11. and sister Car
rie, who was almost "grown up," being
nearly J6.
"Puss is different from most people,"
said Mr. Stanton, winking Â«t the visi
tor. "Her birthday comes only once a
year."
"Yes," said mama, soberly, "but she
has the best of it at school. The other
boys and girls didn't start till they
were six yeaws old, and Mattie has been
going three weeks already; so she's
just that much ahead."
So they joked and laughed and ate,
and everybody tasted the cake and de
clared it to "be the best he had ever
eaten.
Soon after supper Mr. Wallace said
again that he must go home- but Mat
tie climbed upon his knee arra declared
she wouldn't let him go. Then Mr.
Stanton said that the visitor had bet
ter stay all night, as home was a long
way off and the road was very rough
and muddy.
So they all sat down by the fireplace
and began to talk, and Mattie sat on
Mr. Wallace's lap and told everybody
about the fun she would have the next
day.
After a while the clock struck 9, and
mama said Mattie must go to bed or
she couldn't get up early in the morn
ing.
I wish I had time to tell you all about
the party. May be some time you will
meet Mattie and she can tell just what
happened.
Mama's voice was the first sound
Mattie heard the next morning, and
she opened her eyes sleepily, "What's
ze matter?"
"Time to get up, dear," was the
cheery answer; and then Mattie knew
that morning had come and the real
birthday was just begun.
NINE BRAVE
SOLDIER BOYS
SEVERAL Santa Rosa boya
thought that it would be fine to
camp like real soldiers, and they
carried out their idea.
Captain Ted Culver, First Lieu
tenant Arthur Wright, Privates Will
Neurater, Willie Healey, Earl Riley,
Hood Burnett, James Jamison, James
Church and Harry Wilson. Such was
the roster of the occupants of "Camp
Dewey" in the large vacant lot ad
joining Dr. Wiley's residence on Mc-
Donald avenue.
These young gentlemen for the
space of three days and nights en
joyed a taste of soldier's life on the
tented field, and spent a most enjoy
able time following out to the letter the
regime of military rule In camp.
Â»They had their tents pitched and
had their commissary, department; had
regular drills morning and afternoon
and had guard mount and review.
The young soldiers did not forget
vo mave Old Glory fluttering in the
breeze over "Camp Dewey," for in this
way did they immortalize the hero of
Manila by naming their camp in honor
of him. Visitors, and during the en
campment there were many, were re
quired always to salute the colors.
Captain Culver's company was quite
sorry when the time came for the
breaking of camp.
In Hamburg: the authorities tax a dog
according to its size.
JACK SAVED
THE EXPRESS
BY ALMA S BEMENDERFER,
ANGELS CAMP.
ALKALI POINT was situated in
Nevada, near the mountains.
Away to the east stretched the
desert, and through it the rail
road track was lost to sight in the
distance. Years ago, when silver min
ing was at its height, all the six alkali
bleached mills near the mountains
made loud music for the people who oc
cupied the liveliest camp in that sec
tion. But now all was quiet, and to
the few remaining citizens the passing
trains were the only noisy machines to
boast of thereabouts.
Jack Hqward lived there. His father
was a section hand on the railroad, and
the trains, pulled by the swift, puffing
engines, seemed to draw him to the
tracks and force him to take an inter
est in railroad work. Often in the dusk
of the evening he would wander off,
and standing by a rock pile watch tho
headlight of a locomotive quickly ad
vance out of the gloom of the desert,
growing brighter and brighter as it
bore down on the station. Away to
the south on the railroad line was a
deep gulch called Hooker Gulch, and
as mining had been done above it much
of the debris and waste ore was
dumped into its depths, until the deep,
steep cut near the track was filled by a
pile of rock.
Jack often walked by It and wondered
If it was solidly braced. Once he no
ticed that some small stones had rolled
on the track; but as that had hap
pened elsewhere, he only tossed them
to one side. Often when his father re*
turned home after a hard day's work
he sat with him on the porch and lis
tened as he explained about railroad
work.
"Jack," he said, as the through train
passed by, going East, "see that train?
"Why, it's a little world to itself, with
its own peculiarities, so to speak. Even
the people have their own railroad
ways. Look at the mall clerks, por
ters, baggage men, conductor, express
man, fireman and the engineer, who, to
my mind, is the most important man
there. He understands every part of
his engine and all the track he runs
over. Yet how in the power of others
he is, when one mistake on their part
might send him and a trainload of peo
ple to their death."
One day as Jack was passing the
gulch he saw several boys rolling large
stones down the steep bank to see them
skip the track. Quickly climbing to
where they were he said: "Stop that,
fellows. If any hit the rails they might
make trouble."
"Mind your own business," shouted
one boy; "and you think you can or
der us you are mistaken. Don't listen
to him, boys. Go i ".ead and roll all
you please."
Then more rocks were rolled over,
each boy trying to see who could roll
the farthe3t.
Jack stood by, trying to convince
them it was not safe. Seeing they
would not listen he went down and
started back to town. He had not
more than cleared the gulch when,
hearing the boys shout, he looked back.
They had started a large boulder,
which, as it bounded from place to
place on the down trip, started earth
and rock, which gathered in volume
every second, till a huge slide came
surging down over the track, covering
it deeply for several feet. The boys
stood still at the top till it reached the
bottom, and then came stumbling down
in great haste.
"JuÃt look what we have done, boys,"
said one quickly. "Who would have
thought that boulder c^uld have start
ed all that slide? Pitch in and let's try
to get it off before a train comes
along."
The boys walked some distance and
getting picks and shovels worked hard
to clear the track. But as fast as they
shoveled it off more dirt slid down from
the dump, till at length they said it
was useless.
"The best things for us to do is to
leave things as they are and skip, and,
when we reach the point, say we saw
it as we came by. No one would ever
think we started all that, and if Jack
Howard dares tattle we will pay him.
back. I mean just what I say, too.
Don't I, fellows?"
"Yes," said the boys. Then they
started for the point, leaving Jack
alone. The landslide had occurred on
level ground, and as the engineers ex
pected clear headway there, they gen
erally made ,up for lost time on that
level stretch of country. It was nearly
night and Jack decided to go to Alkali
Point and get help. He hurried on,
but before he had gone far he heard
the echo of a train along the rails com
ing from the opposite direction. He
was very much frightened.
What could he do? That flashed
through his mind as, turning back, he
hurried over the landslide, and â there
was the train! The headlight was
glowing, the cars lighted and sparks
from the smokestack trailing on behind.
Jack thought quickly. Taking off his
coat he lit one end, waving it over hisi
head. It quickly burst into a bright
blaze, w-hich was seen by the engineer,
who brought the train to a standstill
within ten feet of where Jack stood.
"Well, what's the trouble here?"
asked some of the trainmen as, lan
terns in hand, they came up. "Why.
it's a landslide!"
"Yes," said Jack, "it is. I came along
and saw it, so I was able to let you
know in time."
After a time the other boys learned
how Jack had saved many passengers
from death. They were afraid that
Jack would accuse them. But no, Jack
kept his own counsel, and from that
time he was the most popular boy in
town.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
A meeting of the executive and the spe
cial committees of the California Miners'
Association has been called by President
Neff and Secretary Julian Sonntag to fix
a date and prepare a call for the an
nual State convention. The convention
will be called for some time In Novem
ber not long after election day.
The association will this year with
out doubt have to elect successors to
President Neff and Secretary Sonntag.
Mr. Neff will be Lieutenant Governor,
. and will probably insist on retiring from
the office to which he has been, so enthu
siastically re-elected ever since organiza
tion, in 1892. Mr. Sonntag's business ln
â¢ terests make It neccessary for him to de
â¢cline to be a candidate again for the
' office he has so long and efficiently filled.
The Miners' convention will this year
again have before it the Important mat
ters of national legislation for which
the association has so long labored, but
the situation regarding all of them Is
jiore encouraging than ever before.
There will be additional appropriations
?or restraining dams to be sought of
Congress. The movement for a Depart
ment of Mines and Mining in the execu
tive branch of the Government, first
Btarted by this association, has grown
to be a national one. The prospects of
the mineral lands bill are hopeful.
The coming year promises to be a
gTeat one in the mining Industry, and
political as well as business prospects
Beem to be smiling upon It.
A bond on the Lowdon and George
m-oup of copper mines on Little Back
bone Creek was secured by William
Kemp Monday, and the prospects are
that a sale will result. The bond calls
tor a purchase price considerably above
$50 000. Kemp is at present In Jtoir* em
ploy of Lewishon Brothers, copper brok
ers' and sale agents of New York City,
and Is developing for them the copper
bearing properties on Stillwater. The
Lowdon and George property Is located
*. mile and a half west of Kennet, and
has been pronounced a most promising
copper deposit. Adjoining is the Mam
moth group of copper mines, owned by
B. M. Saeltzer, J. A. Kahny and Tony
Jaegel and now under bond to A. W.
Forstner of New York.â Redding Free

A phenomenally rich strike was made
Saturday In the famous Enterprise mine
On the North Fork of Trinity River,
twelve miles from Junction City. The
property is owned by Mrs. J. R. BaJch,
Levt Day, the Day brothers and others.
It has long been operated and has yielded
â  much treasure. A complete ten-stamp
quartz mill stands on the property.

recently bought by Colonel Dan Burns of

An Immensely rich discovery has been
I made In the Mazeppa mine, near the
i Jumper, on the mother lode, near Sonora.
I The rock contains stringers of gold al
most as large as a lead pencil. The ex

Considerable excitement was occasioned
around Ban Andreas this week over the
j reported strike of a rich lead while cross
cutting at the 700-loot level at the i ord
| mine. Already the vein shows a width
of twenty feet, and the rock, although
I not yet having been assayed, shows up
well, there being some free gold visible.
It Is hoped that the long sought for lead
has been struck, for the development of
one good mine in our immediate vicinity
would do much for the town and eventu
ally lead to the development of other
properties in this belt.â Calaveras Citizen.

grets the clean water in Deer Creek
since hydraulicking Is wholly suspended <
there: "What water there is in Deer i
Creek Is as clear as crystal from the i
head down to the Mountaineer mine. It !
Is the first time such has been the case
Btnoe the days when the pioneer miner !
began to rile up the liquid depths. This
clear water in a mining district is a very
bad thing for the country at large."
A Butte Valley correspondent of the I
Plumas Independent writes: "The bo
nanza mine of the North * ork at present
Is the Cameron, situated about 3000 feet ,
north of Marion Flat, a locality that in |
early days proved to be very rich, and |
now recent developments in the Cameron |
mine point to it as a source from which i
Marion Flat received its wealth of gold. !
The main tunnel of the Cameron at the
distance of "60 feet from its mouth makes
an upraise of thirty-five feet, thence 400 ,
feet to the main breast of gravel. Five
tnen are at work In a body of gravel j
eighty feet in width that pays over $10 a i
day to the man."
President Pierce of the Blue Lakes I
Company has Just returned from the lakes i

A San Andreas (Calaveras County) cor
respondent of the Mining and Scientific |

shaft, several crosscuts and a 10-stamp i
mill. The property has been idle some I
time. Work will begin September 1, by j
unwatering the shaft."
The following notes are given by the
Amador Republican:
"The cry of Mow water' is being heard
In Amador County, probably for the first â ,
time In recent years. It is rumored that
both the Kennedy and Argonaut mines

"The Kennedy M. and M. Company j
completed the purchase of the Mason |
ranch on Monday last by paying over $3000 i
spot and engaging to pay $7000 more later
on. We understand that this purchase in- j
eludes the Jackson Gate mine, formerly j
prospected by Siebe and others of San (
Fram'isco.
"The Keystone mine and mill are idle, !
and it Is probable that work will not be
resumed In them for some time as a I
scarcity of water prevents it."
