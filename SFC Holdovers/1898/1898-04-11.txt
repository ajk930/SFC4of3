KEY WEST, Fla.. April 10â "You may tell Mr. Blanco for me that the Fern is the last ship
of the American navy that will ever go out of Havana harbor while the Spanish flag flies over
Morro."
This was the message that General Lee sent back to General Blanco as he steamed out of
Havana harbor last night. Lee was indignant at the insults heaped upon his head by the Spanish
officials and populace. He had been snubbed at the palace by General Blanco and affronted by Dr. Con
gosto. As the Fern bearing our consular representative left the harbor there were cries of "Fuera !"
("Begone") from thousands of throats, and Vice-Consul Springer made a gesture in reply which meant,
"We will come again," and cried, "Esperen volvernos !" ("Await our return.")
When General Lee went
to the palace yesterday he
was accompanied by the
British Consul, Mr. Gullon,
who was to take unwilling
charge of the American con
sulate. Mr. Gullon is a
Spanish sympathizer and
refused to take charge until
peremptorily ordered to do
so from London. General
Lee sent in his compliments
to General Blanco, with the
request for an audience. He
was still Consul-General,
and desired to say that he
took leave pending his re
turn from the United States.
Instead of General Blanco
came Congosto, with a curt
message that the captain
general did not desire to see
General Lee again. General
Lee was dumfounded. Con
gosto bowed and withdrew.
leaving General Lee boiling
with indignation.
Consul Gullon, instead of
leaving with General Lee,
made an excuse that he had
to see Dr. Congosto on a per
sonal matter and remained
behind. As General Lee
passed down the crowded
staircase Spanish subalterns
and attaches made fun of
him. muttering insults and
crying "Fuera." It is the
duty of soldiers out of the
palace when a consular rep
resentative appears to stand
at attention. As General
Lee passed the soldiers re
mained lounging about. So many threats had been made and so gross had been the insults that General Lee had decided to remain no longer in
Havana, and went on board the Fern. Everything had been done to protect American interests. All the Consuls and Vice-Consuls were gathered
in Cuba. All persons desiring the protection of the United States were given passage in ships.
The steamer James H. Dudley, which came in, was advised by Lee not to unload, but to depart at once. The oil steamer Almouth of
Philadelphia had disregarded General Lee's advioe and unloaded, and was lying at the dock. Nothing could be done for her. The Olivette was
jrally loaded down with passengers, One hundred went aboard the Evelyn, a tramp steamer. There were twenty-six on the Bache, and on the
Fern were General Lee and his staff and the American newspaper correspondents. Among the refugees were several Englishmen. The English
colony had gone over the head of the British Consul and demanded the protection of General Blanco, fearing they would be taken for Amerioans
and killed.
The Dudley was the first to sail ; then the Olivette left ; then the Evelyn, Bache, and last of all, the Pern. Each boat wanted to be last.
The Baches engineers had arranged to plead a breakdown and did it, and General Lee had to peremptorily order the Baohe to proceed. The harbor
was lined from Machina wharf to Morro castle on one side and to La Pnnta on the other with thousands of spectators. Everybody- whistled, as
whistling is a mark of derision, like hissing in the United States.
As the Fern passed the Alphonso XII a gun was trained on her and the gun crew stood ready. General Lee saw it and spoke of it. The
gun was swung around after the Pern had passed. Above the whistling came cries of "Fuera!" acoompanied by insulting epithets. Back went
the reply from Vice-Consul Springer, "Esperen volvernos!" Covering the rear of the fleet of the refugees the Pern swept out to sea and headed
for Key West.

DTEA. April 6, via Tacoma, April
10.â At the time of the sailing of the
steamship Australia this morning at 6
o'clock, forty-two bodies had been re
covered from their burial in the snow
at the front of Chilcoot Pass by the
avalanche of Sunday morning.
A large force of men is at work mov
ing the snow and has been so employed
with all possible energy since the slide,
but the work has resulted only in the
opening of two short and narrow
trenches in an expanse of snow that
has changed the topography of the
canyon for a distance of an eighth of a
mile and has subi erged a little city of
tents, their inhabitants and a large
quantity of provisions. To shift this
body of snow, twenty and thirty feet
deep in places, will be impossible, and
the full extent of Saturday's casualty
will not be known until spring and
summer leave the canyon bare. From
what is known of the number of people
who were moving upon, or were located
on, the trail at the point covered by the
slide, it is estimated that the number of
deaths will reach one hundred.
Sheep Camp, a village of nearly 1000
people, has for occupation now only a
search for, and care of, the bodies of
the dead and the few who were taken
out alive after their long submersion.
There were less than a dozen of these,
and their experience was such as to
have wholly broken their nerve. To ask
them to relate it is to invite them to
weep like feeble old men.
A morgue has been established in a
tent where the bodies of the dead
brought from the heights above strap
ped to sleds are laid in a row for iden
tification. An undertaker has prepared
a lot of rough boxes from heavy rip
sawed lumber, and on being identified
the bodies are placed In these and
freighted in wagons dow*n through the
canyon to Dyea, fourteen miles dis
tant. The working force of the Chil
coot Railway and Transportation Com
WILL CONGRESS THINK
AS DOES McKINLEY ?
NEW YORK, April 10. â The following was received from
the Herald's Washington correspondent late to-night: While
the President's message, which goes to Congress to-morrow,
recommends armed intervention, the word "immediate," 1
learn to-night, has been stricken out. Not only this, the
President in his comment on the new programme of Spain will
indicate that she should be allowed an opportunity to prove
her sincerity to establish the new form of self-government
which she now contemplates. Thus it would appear that Spain
has gained at least delay by the new card which she has
played.

pany has lost nineteen men and the
power house of the company at Sheep
Camp has been turned into another
morgue as the bodies of these are re
covered and turned over to the officers.
A citizens' and miners' committee has
taken charge of the work of excavation
and of caring for the bodies and the
effects of the deceased, and all is being
done that can be in the premises expe
ditiously and well.
The avalanche occurred at about 11
o'clock on Sunday morning during a
heavy snowstorm and came from the
precipitous side of the mountain to the
east of the canyon. The storm had
been raging for five days, increasing in
severity until all traffic was stopped.
On Saturday a number of snow slides
had occurred, burying tents and indi
viduals all the way down the line from
the Scales to Sheep Camp, and men
were kept busy digging their fellows
out. In the camp at the Scales an or
ganization was effected and men were
placed on guard day and night with
shovels to respond quickly to the cry
of distress. They were kept busy all
Saturday night.
On Sunday morning the storm still
increased, the snow blowing so thick
before a driving wind that one could
not distinguish a figure ten paces dis
tant. About 9 o'clock a tent occupied
by Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Maxson was
buried under a snow slide, and it was
an hour before the force of men which
answered their cries released them.
Mrs. Maxson, Mrs. Estes and other
women in the camp became hysterical
and called upon the men tolead the
way to Sheep Camp, that â¢ffriy' might
all of them flee from what seemed cer
tain death.
A number of people congregated
about the restaurant tent of F. B. Hol
brook of Portland, known as No. 99,
and there the expedition down the can
yon was organized. A rope was foundâ
several ropes were knotted together â
making a line about 200 feet long, and
men and women went through the
camp calling upon all to "come and get
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
on the line and make a run for Sheep
Camp." In this work Mrs. Maxson, who
had had the experience of the morn
ing, was particularly active, passing
from tent to tent in the blinding
storm and crying, "Come out and flee
for your life."
When the line started, it is estimat
ed, there were from eighty to one hun
dred men and women clinging to it,
for the space was entirely full the in
dividuals being: about two feet apart.
In single file the long, dark line like a
serpent followed the windings r>* the
trail down the mountain, its progress
retarded by the stumbling of individ
uals over the caches and through the
snow drifts. At each tent as they
came to it the leader would stop and
some of the number would run to it
and call upon the occupants, if any
there were, to come out and get on
the line for Sheep Camp, "and to be
ware the avalanche."
In this way the number was still

further recruited. On the side of the
hill near the first descent from the
Scales stood a tent that was partially
buried by snow. When the men came
to it, erring "Come out! Come out!
Run from the avalanche!" there was
no answer, and they hastily tore open
the flies of the tent. Three men lay
Inside, crushed to death under a
weight of heavy boxes and timber that
have boon thrown upon them by a
snowslide. The bodies were taken out
ami there was some considerable delay
before it was fully determined that
they were dead and that the wisest
thing to be done at the time was to
leave them. This delay no doubt cost
many lives. The men returned to their
places on the line and it moved on.
Down near tin* power house of the
Chilcoot Railway and Transportation
Company the trail divides, a path
down a deeper cut being reserved for
Individuals ai d handsled men as apart
from the borsea and regular packmen.
A rope had been stretched along one
side of the trail which is, or was, a
deep gully, b which those going up
could assist themselves. T'-s leader of
the line had given out exhausted and
taken a place further back, and a new
man was in his place. He swerved
over and made down the side trail, In
tending to use the rope as a guide, for
the â  -'il was now obliterated by the
downfall of snow. They had scarcely
red the lower level of the side
trail when a man ran down the line
crying:
â¢The power house is falling, boys!
Look oui ! Look out!"
There was a low, hissing sound; the
. arth, or the great snowdrift, seemed
to rise up; those on the rear end of the
rope saw the dark line in front of them
lean to one side for an instant, rise
and fall back, and there was only the
.whiteness of the snow where the black
line had been.
â¢â lt was as though you scattered a
handful of ten-penny nails in the
snow, so completely and silently did
they disappear." according to one of
those in the rear who saw it.
Men with shovels have been placed at
the forward and rear end of the line.
The forward man was lost. Only one
shovel was at hand. About twenty on
the rear end of the line were only part
ly submerged, and these worked them-
Belves clear. Among them was Hol
brook, and he took the shovel and be
gan to work down the line. Messengers
were Bent to Sheep Tamp calling for as-
Bistance, and a lone came down from
the power-house. The power-house had
not moved; it was merely the illusion
in tho eye of tho excited man who saw
the snow rushing down upon it.
The work of the afternoon and night
recovered six nun living and the bodies
of twenty-one dead. The dead and liv
ing were carried to the power-house
â  near by, where all that could be done
was done for them. There are a num
ber (if physicians at Sheep Camp, and
they, with a corps of assistants, labor
ed for the resuscitation of all who were
brought in. The people at Sheep Camp
were slow to believe the first excited
9 mgers from the disaster, but. as-
Bured of the terrible truth, they turned
out in numbers and worked tirelessly.
The loss of the men in the employ of
the Chilcoot Railway and Transporta
tion Company was not realized until
Monday morning, for the nineteen
who were out were all buried under the
snow, leaving not one to tell of their
fat.-. There had been almost no out
side work done on the line for several
days because of the storm. The men
had become restless, aid when one of
the bosses proposed that a certain wire
that bad gotten out of place on one
<>f the towers be fixed he found ready
volunteers, even to the chief^ engineer
and head bookkeeper. .The party oj
nineteen started up the trail and reach
ed the vicinity of the power-house
about a half hour before the men on the
rope <ame down from the Scales. Some
men in the power-house saw them pass
and declare that there were thirty-fTve
if them by actual count. This, how-
BVI r, must be an error, as only nineteen
Â»f tho employees are missing.
A few moments after they passed
those men in the power-house felt a
tush of snow but paid no attention to
It, believing it to have been nothing
more than a slide from the roof. It
was half an hour later when a man ran
in and gave notice of the slide that
buried the people coming down from
the Scales. So it is clear there were
two avalanches, occurring a half hour
apart, at the same place, and both, by
a strange circumstance, falling at the
moment when large parties of men
were passing. The employes of the
transportation company were stationed '
at Sheep Camp, and there they would!
have been missed that evening but '
that a messenger called upon Nelson |
Bennett, the general manager, at his I
office there, from J. B. Pierce, the book- !
keeper, saying that he was all right, !
but would not return that nightâ he j
would remain <m tho summit. The mes- j
senger was a stranger to Mr. Bennett, j
and he does not know where Pierce was !
when he dispatched him or what time
he did so, but the message caused Ben~
nett to rest easy that night with re- j
gard to the party. Not until, morning !
did ho discover that they were all lost. !

Living and dead were recovered at :
a depth of from eight to fourteen feet. |
They were found in every variety of j
positions as they were caught and i
pinioned or thrown by the snow. One !
was found entirely reversed, head
down; another upright with hand up- I
raised, but most of them were lying on
their faces. The dead bodies were '
fixed and immovable in the positions â 
they had been held by the snow. The
expression on many indicated an agony
Of Buffering before death came. In '
nearly every case death resulted from \
suffocation, a /lough those who were i
taken out alive after having been un- j
der the snow for several hours reported i
having had but little difficulty in
breathing. The limbs of some of the
dead were broken.
The first avalanche at the power
house left no living witness, and what j
it buried and destroyed cannot be
known. The peeond left some twenty i
or thirty people floundering in the j
snow, dazed and frightened. The wind
**-4s blowing a gale and the snow was
so thick in the air that they could not
see. They staggered against each other
as they worked. Holbrook of No. 99 as-
sumed the leadership and urged every
body to do his utmost. Dazed and ex-
hausted, some one after some hours
suggested that they could work better
if they had some stimulant. Holbrook
climbed the hill back to his tent,
whence they had started, to get a bot
tle of whisky, but found that his tent
had in the meantime been buried under
a snow slide and two men were under
it. He had to remain and alone labor to
get them out.
Great confusion prevailed all along
the trail. Men were hunting for and
calling upon their partners, fearful that
they were under the snow. The con
fusion and panic spread to the settle
ment at Sheep Camp, and with every
one who had friend who was not at
hand great anxiety and alarm was felt.
As the hours ran into days, however,
many of the missing were found, and
th> friends of those who were not gave
them up for lost.
The character of the situationâ that
of a strapping army without organiza
tion or roster, few being acquainted
with their next neighbor, all shifting
position from day to day as they moved
forward along the trail â makes it prac
tically impossible to gain any idea of
the number of the missing. Among
those who were on the trail and who
were searched for by their friends
without success until the time of my
leaving the scene at noon on Monday
were :
C. C. Turner of Omha. Neb. He was
a civil engineer and was taking a boat
over to Crater Lake.
William Folker. who had come out
from Dawson last fall, and was return
ing.
Among those who were buried under
the snow, but taken out alive were the
following: C. L. Burge, Emporia,
Kans. ; Leo Brock, Buffalo, N. V.; J. A.
Rimes, Lockport, Me. and Kansas;
Hubbard G. Hancock. Klowa, 1. T. ;
Frank Bearss, Emporia. Kans.;

ver; Tom Hanna, Michigan; E. W. Dal
ton, Iowa; Charles Chriscaden. Seattle;
J. A. Revencroft, Seattle; John Lally.
Missouri; W. H. Maxson. Punxa
tawny. Pa.
The above were all on the rope com
ing from the Scales to Sheep Camp.
Tom Callaban of San Francisco and
J. Wilkinson of McKeesport left the
Scales ahead of the party with the
rope, but were caught in the slide. They
dug themselves out. The following
were buried further down near the
Stone House:
J. G. Holmes. Mark White, Frank
Stedman, W. J. Wallace, Orleans, Neb.;
W. J. Jennings, H. S. McGowan and
another of the same party, whose
name could not he learned, all of Ne
braska; John A. Murphy, Dixon, N. D. ;
Arthur L. Chappy, New York.
There were three women tied to the
rope line that came down from the
Scalesâ Mrs. W. H. Maxson, Mrs. E.
?]stes and Mrs, Ryan. Mrs. Maxson.
the woman who was buried in her tent
earlier in the day and who urged the
men to lead the way to Sheep Camp,
was lost. Her husband escaped. The
other two women were on the rear end
of the rope and were not.submerged.
Cliff L. Burge of Emporia, Kan., was
eight feet under the snow for an hour
and was taken out unconscious. His
account of the catastrophe as given to
me is as follows:
"It had been storming for several
days and the snow lay five feet deep
on the level at the Scales. Slides from
the mountain had become frequent.
At 1 o'clock Sunday morning I was
awakened by the stove in my tent up
setting. I got out and found that a
number of tents were entirely buried,
and with others I began shoveling. We
could hear the cries of the people un
der the snow. In a few hours we had
rescued twenty-five persons. At 9
o'clock another slide buried part of the
tent, and that of Mr. and Mrs. Maxson
and others. We dug them out and
then this plan of the rope line was
agitated and carried out. Mrs. Maxson
was active in this and kept urging the
men: "Come, get hold of the rope,
boys, and save your lives!" 1 As we ran
down the hill in the blinding storm we
lost the trail frequently and got
tangled up with the caches that were
strewn along the way. I saw and
heard the slide coming and I yelled a
warning, 'There she comes! 1 An in
stant later I felt myself lifted; then
all was dark and silent, and I was
pinioned as in a vice and lost con
sciousness. They say it was an hour
afterward that I was taken out."
Leo Brock of Buffalo, a newspaper
1 man representing the Buffalo Sunday
Times, was burled for nearly four
hours. He was taken out unconscious,
' but is almost recovered. He was at
Holbrook's tent No. 99 when the slide
j came at 9 o'clock, and he helped to
' dig the people out and afterward
: helped to organize the rope line party.
"It started from a point about 150 feet
from the base of the summit," said he.
"From the foot of the first pitch be
j low the Scales it turned to the left for
! about 1000 Teet, to where a cable util
j ized for hauling up sleds Is stretched.
On reaching the cable we were about
200 feet below and 600 feet to the
left of the tramway power - house
located at the foot of the long
hill. A small tene was observed
here almost completely covered with
snow. As smoke was seen to issue
from it a halt was made to induce the
occupants to join us. Two or three of
us reached it with difficulty, and found
that the rear end had been crushed in.
We opened the flies and saw three
men there half buried under boxes and
bales. We took them out, and upon ex
amining them found that life was ex
tinct. We returned to the line, and had
hardly moved fifty feet when Borne one
running along the line cried: 'The pow
er-house Is sliding down. At the same
instant I felt myself gently pushed for
ward by the snow â forward and down
word until I lay on my face. Then a
weight came upon me that grew heav
ier and heavier, and I felt that the
power-house was over me. I was not
frightened. I could not move hand or
foot, and although there was a tremen
dous pressure all about me I had no
great difficulty in breathing. I blew
the snow out of my mouth and nostrils.
Some one had taken my mils in the
confusion before leaving the tent, and
some one else had slipped a pair of
stockings on my hands and arms. I
had great difficulty in holding the rope
; with these, and so twisted it around
; my arm. I still held to It that way. â¢
"I did a heap of thinking as I lay
there, of course. No other idea oc
curred to me than that I was under
the power-house. Still I felt reasonably
sure that I would be dug out; that
j they would follow the rope and rescue
j me. The thought worried me, however,
j that If they did not, my wife ami
j friends would never know what had be
come of me, for I am supposed to be
over on the lakes and have got my out

Senor Gonzales de Quesada, the dip
lomatic representative of the Cuban
Junta, to-day issued the following
signed statement to show that the in
surgents have a regularly organized
civil government whose independence
can be recognized:
It is circulated by the enemies of the
cause of the independence of Cuba that
they have no government or civil or
ganization to recognize. It is .admitted
by all that there is a Cuban army which
has forced Spain to confess her inability
to re-establish her control of the island,
the triumphs and hardships of the Cuban
soldiers are written up every day, but
the more admirable example of the vir
tue and capacity of the people of Cuba,
the craatiop and working of a civil or
ganization, is lost; and yet there is no
writer who has visited the Island, ii:ig
lish or American, who has not told the
world of the government of the republic
of Cuba. At this moment a short sketch
of the laws and ofricers of the republic
cannot fail to interest the American peo
ple and serve to dispel any doubt in the
minds of Senators and Congressmen who
will be called to vote for a resolution rec
ognizing the republic
From the very inception of tho revolu
tion the Cubans provided for a civil
power. The Cuban revolutionary party,
which prepared and directed the . move
ment, was a civil organization, headed
by Jose Marti, who zealously aided in es
tablishing the paramount influence of the
law over the Bword. General Gomez then
and throughout all the revolution has
shown himself desirous that the civil au
thorities should have the supreme power.
When lie and Marti landed their lirst aim
was to constitute a provisional govern
ment. Gomez, as well as all the other
military leaders, recognized Marti as the
civil head. After the meeting of Gomrz.
Maceo and Marti at Mejorana on May 1,
IS'jo, a call for the selection of representa
tives of the Cuban people to form a civil
government was made, and Marti and
Gomez marched to the central provinces
lo arrange for these important details.
The decrees of that time are always
signed by both Gomez and Marti.
The death of Marti postponed for a
Uine the selection of the representatives,
but in the beginning of September, 1*95,
the call previously issued was complied
with. Representatives from each of the
provinces of Santiago. Puerto Principe,
Srnta Clara and the western part of the
island, comprising the provinces of Mct
tai.zas and Habana, making twenty in
all. were elected to the constituent as
sembly, which was to establish a civil
government, republican in form. The
constituent assembly, composed of doc
tors, lawyers and distinguished Cubans,
met at Jimaguayu, in the province of
Puerto Principe, on September 13, IS&S.
It was duly organized, it solemnly de
clared the independence of Cuba ami its
separation from the Spanish monarchy
and confirmed the existence of the re
public of Cuba among the political divis
ions of the world. The constitution, baaed
on democratic and republican principles,
was to be in force two years, unless the
freedom of Cuba was obtained previous
to the expiration of that time.
On the 18th of September the following
officials of the Government were elected
by the constituent assembly in accord
ance with the terms of the constitution:
President, Salvador Cisneros Betancourt
of Puerto Principe; Vice-President, LJar
tolomeo Maso of Manzanillo; Secretary of
War, Carlos Roloff of Santa Clara; Secre
tary of the Treasury; Severo Pinaof Santa
Spiritus; Secretary of the Interior, San
tiago Gracia Canizares of Remedios;
Secretary of Foreign Relations, Rafael M.
Portunondo of Santiago de Cuba; Sub-
Secretary of War, Mari Monocal of
Mutanzas; Sub-Secretary of the Treas
ury, Joarjuin Castillo of Santiago de
Cuba; Sub-Secretary of the Interior, Car
los Dubois of Baracoa; Sub-Secretary of
Foreign Relations, Fermin ValdezDomln
guez of Habana.
The installation of these officers duly
followed. The election of the g.-neral-in
chief and the second in command, who is
to bear the title of lieutenant-general,
was then held, and resulted in the
unanimous election of Maximo Gomez
and Antonio Maceo respectively. On thÂ»
same day the constituent assembly elect
ed by acclamation as delegate pleni
potentiary and general agent abroud of
the Cuban republic Tomas Estrada
Palma.
During the two years of the Cisneros
administration and up to the time of
Maceo's death, the civil authorities of the
republic have exercised their functions
throughout the territory controlled by the
republic of Cuba, which is about three
fourths of the island. There is a civil
governor in every province who has his
subordinates and employes. The provinces
fit there, and have written home to
that effect. I came back to help an old
man through. I do not know, of
course, how long I was in the snow
when I lost consciousness, but it was
three hours and forty-five minutes af
ter the slide that I was taken out. It
was several hours after that when 1
regained consciousness."
Mr. Brock was still in bed at the
Woodlawn when interviewed, and
in the course of his story frequent
ly broke down, especially when refer
ring to the thought that those he loved
would not have known what had be
come of him.
J. A. Rines, an old man of 63 years,
was burled for a half-hour, and was
taken out before he lost consciousness.
He had hold of the rope at about the
middle. He could not see well in the
storm, but he heard a subdued roar
and felt the rush of the snow. He car
ried a staff and planted himself firmly
upon it when he felt the slide. Out of
of the whirl of the storm and the rush
of the avalanche there came suddenly
rest and complete silence, with a pres
sure on every side that fixed him mo
tionless. He realized what had taken
place and could see a dim light from
above, so he felt he was not burled
deeply. His hat and parky had kept
the snow away from his face so that
he had a slight breathing space. He
called continually but could not be
heard, although he could dimly hear
the voices of the rescuing party. Pres
ently came the shovels above hin\,
striking and cutting his coat, but he
was saved.
F. B. Holbroook of tent No. 99, who
took such an active part In organizing
the party with the rope, as well as in
rescuing the submerged, was about the
twentieth man from the rear' end of
the line. He had been opposed to mak
ing this run and was protesting against
it, he said, when he saw the slide cora-
I ing. He was caught only to his waist,
j immediately struggled out and began
I to work for the rescue of others. He
I described how he saw the long line
j. ahead of him "drop out of sight quick!v
I and silently like a handful of naifs
j thrown into the snow." On the line
were his partners and tent mates. Con
Gepfert, E. J. Judson, Grimes, Cullen,
I Beck and Dahlstrom, all of whom were
! lost.
"I have seen all manner of disasters
and accidents, from a steamboat explo
sion to a railroad collision," he said,
"but never anything that unnerved me
| like this swift and silent horror, the
burial alive, before my eyes, of so many
people, some of them to whom I was
strongly attached as the best and kind
est-hearted men I had ever known.
And that night In the power house,
where a half-hundred bodies, jiving and
dead, were laid, the friends of all of
are divided into prefectures, under the
supervision of the Secretary of the In
terior. The duties of the prefects are vari
ous and are subject to special laws. That
these prefectures are in working opera
tion, the official telegrams of the Spanish
press afford innumerable proofs. General
Blanco, in a communication to his Gov
ernment, under date of March 12, pub
lished in all the Madrid papers, says:
''Havanaâ Captain General to Minister of
War: In operations of columns in the
east, the military lines of the enemy be
tween Bayamo, Manzanillo and Canto,
were broken, also destroying the civil
organization which they had in that ter
ritory for two years."
Documents were tiled before the Senate
( oramittee on Foreign Relations last
April, which were published as Document
No. 19, Fifty-fifth Congress, lirst session,
which proved that the civil government
legislated as to commerce, good work
shops, manufactories, custom inspectors,
postofflces; that stamps have been issued,
public schools established, civil marriage
provided for; that the public treasury is
well organized, taxes being collected and
amounting to hundreds of thousands of
dollars. President Cisneros, and afterwar*
President Maso, issuing state papers as
they became opportune. The military au
thorities are subordinate to the civil gov
ernment. In many documents the gen
erals so declare it, and General Gomez,
the commander-in-chief, duly took thÂ«Â»
oath to the constitution. In July, 1596, ha
published the following circular:
"Headcjuarters of the Army of Libera
tion: This headquarters being informed
of the unworthy proceedings of some
Chiefs and ollicers of the army with re
gard to the civil authorities of the re
public, and resolved, as it is not to con
sent in any case, nor by any person that
the sacred principles of discipline, subor
dination and morality of the revolution
should be disregarded, but that respect
should be rendered to the majesty of its
democratic institutions, its Commander
in-chief and its officers of the inevitable
duty which they have to respect the func
tionaries of the civil government accord
ing to their rank. The military authori
ties are obliged to give the decisive pro
tection of. their force to the civil authori
ties, for the better fulfillment of their
duties. The chiefs of the corps, divi
sions and brigades will chastise severely
ai. subordinates against whom any com
plaints may be made of their bad con
duct in-this respect, they being answer
able to this headquarters for their lenien
cy or indifference.
"P. Y. L. REMAXGANAGUXS,
"MAXIMO GOMEZ, General-in-Chief.
"July 22, 1896."
The general reports of the civil governor
of Uie east, Carlos -lanuel de Cespedes,
for tho years IS% and 1897, quoted in one
of Senator Morgan's speeches, confirm
every one of our statements and is worthy
of perusal. Five newspapers are also
publish, d in the republic: El Cubano
Libre, La Independencia, El Boletin de la
Guerra, La Sanidad and Las Villas. Books
have also been published, the first being
the primer for the public schools. Pur
suant of the mandate contained in the
t onstitution of 1895, a constituent assem
bly was convoked to meet in October,
1897, to revise the laws and to elect new
officers. TÂ».e government council passed
an electoral law and twenty-four repre
s.-nt.Ulves vtere choseij from the six prov
inces by all the citizens of the republic
those in the army as well aÂ« the civil
ians, the election was untrammeled by the
military. In a notable letter to General
Garcia, translations of which reached
President McKinley, he told how In San
tiago de Cuba he gave his vote the same
as the soldiers and peasants and how in
spiring it was to see the people exercise
the right of suffrage in districts con
trolled entirely by the republic.
It was a brilliant Congress that sat the
months of October and November. Dr.
Mendez Capote, ex-professor of law in.
Havana University, presided. The out
going Secretary of State submitted his
reports, which were examined and passed
upon by committees appointed for the
purpose. A new constitution was adopted
on the 29th of October, 1897, which will
be in force two years, unless independ
ence is obtained beforehand, when an
assembly shall be called to provide tem
porarily for the Government and admin
istration of the republic, until a deiinite
constituent assembly shall meet.
The preamble says: "We, the represen
tatives of the Cuban people, freely meet
ing in constituent assembly, convoked by
virtue of the mandate contained in the
constitution of September, 1595, ratify our
firm and unshakable resolve of obtain
ing the absolute and immediate independ
ence of tiie island, in order to establish
in it a democratic republic, and inspiring
ourselves in the present necessities of the
revolution, we decree the following con
stitution: The constitution determines
what is called the republic, who are citi-
them calling upon the doctors and
every passer-by to come for God's sake
and help them bring them back to
life: It was a pandemonium of distress
the like of which I hope never to be
called to witness again."
A. S. Smith of Kansas City gives it
as his opinion that there were about 125
on the rope. He was caught only to the
waist in the snow. Immediately be
hind him was a man named Herzog
who had a shovel. Smith and he did
good work with the single tool. Smith
is one of the Burge party, all of whom
were caught but none lost.
Hubbard G. Hancock was one of the
Burge party and was on the line im
mediately' in front of Smith. He was
submerged by about fourteen inches
and was completely Imprisoned, He
could see the light above and called,
but could not be heard. Smith cleared
the snow away from his head and. af
terward helped to dig him out.
Tom Hanna of Detroit, Mich., Is a
second cousin of Mark Hanna, He was
with the rope party and before it start
ed he said that if he was ever caught in
a snow slide he would throw up his
hand so that the searching party might
see it. When found Hanna's hand was
up.
Arthur L. Chappy was one of the
last taken out alive. He was buried for
four hours and did not recover con
sciousness until 10 o'clock Monday
morning. He was then taken down to
Sheep Camp. His arrival there at that
time gave rise to the story that- he had
been buried for nineteen hours. Chap
py is a young man, married and has a
family in Detroit.
T. M. Biack of Punxatawny, Pa., was
ten feet under the snow for two hours.
He says that he was at first not alarm
ed. His hands were caught up-raised
near his face. He immediately began
to work one of them around to his
mouth to clear a breathing space. It
seemed to him an hour before he had
worked his hand over to his mouth, a
distance of a few inches. Realizing the
impossibility of freeing himself under
these conditions, especially as he did
not know in which direction, up or
down, lay the outer world, he began
to despair and determined to try to
sleep with the hope that it would merge
Avithout pain into the long sleep. He
did actually go to sleep, but again
awoke. Previous to his going to sleep
he had heard despairing voices all
around him, praying, calling upon God
for help and deliverance. When he
awoke all the voices save one were si
lent and that seemed to be the voice
of an old man just above him, that
still kept up an agonizing' appeal for
God for help. Presently he heard the
voices of the rescuers, heard the stroke
of the shovel in the snow, heard the
Zens, their individual and political rights,
the officers of the Government, their pow
ers and provides for the assembling of
the representatives. The principal arti
cles are-:
Article 1> â Cubans and foreigners will be pro

Minister. Dupuy de Lome, dated the 22d
of January, IS9B. and signed by Senor
Congosto, tho secretary of the Spanish
Government in Cuba. It is as follows:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 10.
The Spanish Government, through
its Minister at Washington, Senor Polo
y Bernabe, to-nifM deliver d an im
portant official document to the State
i Department, stating that the armistice
| which the Queen Regent of Spain had
j commanded General Blanco to pro-
I claim was without conditions; that her
| Majesty's Government had granted
I liberal institutions to the island of
I Cuba, which the coming Cuban Par- J
liament would adopt; recalling the j
condolence and sympathy expressed by
the Queen Regent and her Government
on the disaster of the Maine and the
horror this disaster had occasioned in
Spanish hearts and appealing to the
courtesy and sense of justice of the
United States Government to enlighten
public opinion upon the attitude of
Spain.
The note also repeats the offer of the
Spanish Government to submit the
Maine question to experts designated
by the maritime powers of the world.
This document was the official noti- j
fication of the Spanish Government to |
the United States of the granting of !
an armistice and its essential terms.
"Minister Woodford's dispatch last
night had briefly stated the fact that
an armistice had been agreed upon,
but it was not communicated as com
ing from the Spanish Government. To
day's communication cleared up mis
apprehension on the most vital point i
of Spain's conditions.
The note was received by the State j
Department after the first Cabinet ,
meeting and was one of the main sub- :
jects of consideration at the second |
Cabinet meeting held to-night. Al- |
though the Spanish note was surrund
ed with the usual secrecy of official ne
gotiations, the following summary of
Its corttents was secured:
The Spanish Minister in Washington is
deeply impressed by the numerous errors
which seem to have obtained credit in
public opinion in America in regard to
the Cuban Question, and considers it his
duty to call again the attention of the
Secretary of the State of the United
States to the following points:
Firstâ Her Majesty, the Queen Regent
of Spain, desirous of ending the troubles
which are desolating Cuba, has com
manded a suspension of hostilities. Gen
eral Blanco has been ordered to proclaim
to-day an armistice without conditions.
He will determine later the duration and
details of this armistice, so as to carry
out the generous intentions of her Majes
ty and the wishes of the friends of peace.
Secondâ Her Majesty has granted to the
island of Cuba institutions as liberal as
those enjoyed by Canada under the Brit
ish flag. The Cuban Chamber will meet
on the 4th of next May. It will be their
duty and privilege to put into practice
and develop these Institutions. In addi
tion to this, Cuba is represented in the
Parliament at Madrid.
Thirdâ Public opinion in this country
appears to ignore the fact that the loss
of the Maine was immediately followed
by official and reiterated expressions of
condolence from Her Majesty the Queen
from her Government, from her charge !
d'affaires In Washington and from the
authorities in Havana; all of which tend
ed to affirm the horror which this disas
ter has caused to arise in Spanish hearts
as also the sympathy felt for the United
.States Government and navy and for the
American nation. The Spanish Minister
feels confident he can count upon the
courtesy and sense of justice of the Unit
ed States Government to enlighten the
public opinion on the subject.
Fourthâ As to the cause of this lament
able disaster, it resolves itself into a
question of facts which can only be set
tled by material proofs. The Spanish
Minister reiterates the assurance that his
Government Is ready to submit the ques
tion to experts designated by the mari
time powers, whose conclusions are in
advance accepted.
Senor Polo y Bernabe delivered the
document in person to the State De
partment, and aside from the interest
in the communication itself, the call
has added interest as an evidence of re
newal of diplomatic negotiations this
being his first call at the department
in ten days. Later Senor Dubosc first
secretary of legation, made another call
at the department on the same general
subject. Besides delivering the note,
the call permitted a personal exchange
between the Secretary and State and
the Spanish officials of an agreeable
character.
WHISTLED AT
AND INSULTED
But General Lee Is Anxious to Be
turn and Make Spaniards Change
Their Tune.
Copyrighted. IS9B. by JameÃ Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST. Fla.. April io.â General
Lee was so indignant at the conduct of
the crowds who watched the departure
of the refugees from Havana that he
wrote this note to be sent by the pilot
to General Blanco:
"You have broken every promise
made me. We have been whistled at
and insulted as we go. We will re
turn and your whistle will be that of
another tune."
General Lee tore this note up, how
ever, and as the pilot was leaving he
turned to him and gave him a verbal
message for Blanco. Beneath the
shadow of Morro some one brought a
bottle of champagne and glasses, and
General Lee gave this toast, "Here's
to the officers and men of thje Maine,
who were blown up by a Spanish mine."
In responding, Mr. Ackers, an Eng
lish subject, said:
"May fifty guns speak for each of
the Maine's dead, and may each gun
mean fifty Spaniards' lives."
I asked General Lee if his toast
was significant. He replied, "It is sig
nificant only as I speak from the heart,
not from the head."
"Is it true," I asked him. that yoi*,
have evidence showing Spanish impli
cation in the blowing up of the Maine?
"I have a report to make on the
Maine," he answered, "which will be in
the President's hands on Tuesday, but I
have no evidence." t
General Lee again denied in Key
West that he had any positive evidence
to add to what the court of inquiry had
reported. Speaking to me about pos
sible hostilities. General Lee said: -I
believe it is my duty that I should be al
lowed to lead the first division on Ha
vana. If I do. please say in the Her
ald for me that I know how to take a
city."
General Lee displayed a letter from
Algernon Sartoris, grandson of General
Grant, in which he said he wrote to him
as a grandson of the great commander
on the Northern side to ask one of the
leaders on the Southern side to permit
him in case he headed an invasion of
Cuba to serve on his staff. Mr. Sar
toris added that he was 21 years old and
sound* and presented the compliments
of his mother and grandmother.

General Lee's orders from Washington
came soon. They were that h should
take the Olivette, which was in waiting,
and proceed to Port Tampa, v-iere he
would find special transportation which
would take him to Washington. After
breakfasting on the Fern with several
naval officers, General Lee went ashore.
The whole town turned out to meet
him. He avoided a display as much as
possible, however, remaining most of
the time at the naval station with Cap
tain Forsythe, the commandant, and
Captain Cowles of the Fern.
General Lee expressed gratification
that the exodus from Cuba had been
! made without serious mishap. He also
voiced a hope that there might be no
longer a delay on the part of the United
States in settling the Cuban question.
Questions involving criticism of Presi
dent McKinley were put to the consul
general, but he declined to be en
trapped, saying he had no intention of
j discussing the political matters of his
j superior, who was doing well. Delega
| tions of Cubans met at the postofflce
j and addressed a memorial to General
I Lee, thanking him for his courage and
firmness, which hac. saved so many of
their friends from death, and compli
menting him upon the administration
of his difficult office.
In the meantime, returned Americana
and Cuban refugees were swarming
through the hotel corridors rejoicing
j that they were once again on American
j soil and beneath the stars and stripes.
| Nearly every one had friends in Key ,
i West. The landing was really a home j
â , coming. Nearly all the refugees had
j money enough for their immediate
I wants. They were all bitter against
â  Spain and expressed the intention of
i returning to Cuba as soon as Spain was
I driven out. Most of them thought Ha
y.ana would be capitulating about next
Wednesday.
General Lee went aboard the Olivette
j by launch from the naval station at
| half-past 12 o'clock, and the steamer
I sailed for Tampa, most of the refugees
j from Cuba also going to Tampa. Drs.
I Bruno and Dudley of the Marine Hos
i pital Service were ordered to Tampa to
â  await instructions. Vice-Consul Spring
:er was given leave of absence. Mem
j bers of the staff of the Havana consul
i ate were told to remain in Key West.
I The last thing said to Lee as he em
j barked was by an olc* friend, who re-
I marked: "General, I hope you will be
leading a division against Havana be
fore the week is out." To this Consul-
General Lee made no reply.

the steam whaler Belvedere, who ar
rived in San Francisco yesterday morn-
Ing, after a perilous march of nearly
4"'"t miles through the forbidding wilds

horrors of life at Point Barrow ap

The journey just completed by the in
\l lorer, who was dispatched by

In h:st. â !â¢>â - No other traveler has
ever made such a tour, practically
alone, through the boreal regions where
starvation exists ami Arctic storms
rage with unabated fury.
The traveler brings the important
news that Fifth Mate Walker of the
steam whaler < 'rca started for civiliza
tion the same day that the Tilton cx
ii put f"i-th I'm- St. Michael. The
fact that Walker has not been heard
from anywhere along the line leads to
the fear that he has perished in some !
of tlie fierce storms that characterize
the entire region he sought to traverse. ,
\ â â â â  rdlng to calculations that were
made by those familiar with the coun
try Walker ought to have reached his
nation at least three weeks sooner
than Tilton got to Portland. As there
are a great many chances of disaster,
some of which the Tilton party narrow
ly missed, it is th fear of Mate Tilton
that his comrade will never be heard of

reads like the pages of romance. Every
foot of the lonely march was beset with
almost insurmountable obstacles, but it
was made in a little more than five
months, and the man who made it stood
in The call office yesterday and told of
th^ trip. He is as fine a specimen of
rugged manhood as one will find in a
year's voyage, a native of Marthas
Vineyard, Massachusetts.
Mate Tilton and two Indian guides
arrived from Portland on the State of
California yesterday morning, having
been accompanied a long part of the
vay by 1\ Koltchoff, the Government
guide, a trained explorer, who rendered
valuable services to the man dispatched
to civilization by the starving whalers.
"No other man ever made the trip by
land in the dead of winter," said the
mate yesterday, "and there is not
money enough in the world to indu'-e
try the awful journey again. The
â¢ y of it is enough for a life time."
To properly i d the horrors
â¢ f the t rip it is but noc
recall the faei that the trav
md his Indian guides often ton â  d
way through a country never be
fore â¢. ted by white men, meeting
thai Bed when they saw the
strange caravan approach and try In
vain to converse with Indians whose
language was new and unknown to the
guM'-s from the desolate regions fur
ther n Mi. to remember that dark can
had to be crossed, mountains
climbed, rivers forded and rapids shot
without a thought i >f fear: and that
there were times when th^ pilgrims had
to hide behind mountains for days to
avoid death in theroaring blizzards that
filled the air with line snow, driven by
polar hurricanes that almost blew men
from their feet; that the trip was often
made by such zig-zag marches that a
day's travel brought the couriers but
four or five miles toward their destl
nation, and that over It all hovered the
dread danger of starvation and a loss
irf all bearings in a region as wild as
was ever made by forbidding land
scapes, frigid days and nights of wild
est storm.
It is a story of bravery', diplomacy,
g l generalship, skillful husbanding
of scanty resources â and good luck.
Sometimes starvation was so close that
Tilton had to kill some of his faithful
dogs and use them as food for the oth
ers. Sometimes his matches were so
wet and worthless that he had to use
flint stones to .light bunches of coal-oil
saturated "waste" that he carried in
lieu of luoifers. Often there was no
snow with which to build a humble
roof-tree, and amid such misfortune it
was a struggle to sleep in such a way
as to avoid freezing to death. Over it
all hovered the cold stars and the won
derful Aurora Borealis, nightly visitors
in the dread waste of Arctic silence and
desolation.
< >n the way down the party encoun
tered a band of natives that nursed a
bitter feeling against all whites, a tribe
in whose bosom slumbered the fires of
a fierce vendetta against Anglo-Saxons,
because some of their ancestors had
been killed by whalers nearly twenty
years ago. As the little band of mes
sengers passed this habitation they
learned the particulars of the murder
of a white prospector who was shot by
a native to avenge the killing of his
father.
At another point along the march two
members of a band of Indian "moon
shiners" who conducted illicit distil
leries in the frozen north, waylaid and
murdered a native who was trying to
make a record as a revenue agent, by
carrying out the instructions of the
commander of a revenue cutter. Such
things as these were incidents of a
marvelous trip, every part of which
was not only beset with strange diffl-
culties that were overcome, but which
was rich in events of human interest.
In some of the wild regions which
| the travelers crossed they found evi
dences of great mineral wealth, the
quartz being rich and plentiful. One
! night while digging down into the snow
I along the banks of the Yukon, Mate
i Tilton found plenty of rich coal, some
! of which he dug up and used for fuel.
j He took observations and noted the lo
j cation of this and other interesting
points on tho march for future refer
' ence, for he believes there is a vast coal
i fieM along the Yukon.
The story of this wonderful trip is
best told by the man who made it. By
frequent reference to his notebook the
traveler yesterday detailed the more
important points of the narrative as
follows:
"You should understand that T start
ed from Point Barrow on the 21st of
< (ctribr-r, having been selected at a
1 meeting of officers of the ice-bound
i whalers on the 18th. They had called
for volunteers to carry the news to civ
ilization, and I was one of the voiun
| teen* and was chosen to make the
southern trip. Fifth Mate Charles H.
; Walkor of the steam whaler Orca
â i was to go home by way of the
'â â  Mackenzie River and I started by way
i"f St. Michael. According to the esti
, mates made by those familiar with the
situation it was thought that Walker
ought tb got to New Bedford three weeks
\ before I could make it to Portland, but
lie has not yet been heard from and T
I begin to fear he may have perished
during the journey.
"Walker intended to go from Point
Barrow to Herschel Island, then to the
Mackenzie River, then up the river to
Fort McPherson, and from there over
the old trail.
"Walker intended to stop at the Wan
dorer, fast in the ice off Baxter Island.
After consulting the officers of the
Wanderer he Intended to go to H<Â»r

He Arrived at St. Michael With His Native Guides.
up the Mackenzie River one hundred
miles, when his route \ ould turn to the
westward, reaching Fort McPherson,
->n the Red River. Here he would prob
ably gain the first intelligence of the
g:old strike on the Klondike. Some
twenty-five miles to the westward he
would reach La Pierre's house. At this
point his routes were open to him, one
leading down the Porcupine River to
Fort Yukon, thence along the Yu
kon River to Circle City and Dawson.
The other route would lead him in al
most a direct line toward the coast,
crossing the Yukon at Fort Cudany.
striking the headwaters of the Coffee
River and bringing him to Orca, a trad
ing post and canning establishment
controlled by the Arctic Oil Company.
By a reference to the map accompany
ing this article the two- routes will
plainly appear.
"I started witl. two Indian guides,
but they were so badly frozen that they
could not make the entire trip. I had
to drop them at Point Hope
and get others, two of whom,
Tickey and his wife Kauyoana,
are with me here. I have traveled as
long as twenty-seven days at a time
with no other company than these In
dians, and I did not know their lan
guage when we started, so I had to
draw pictures in the snow to let them
know what I meant. I have learned
their language pretty well now, how
ever, and I am explaining to them the
wonders of cities, elevators in tall
buildings, and trains of cars, which
they think are houses moving by the
aid of strange ghosts.
One of the strange features of the
Journey concerns Mrs. Tickey, the loss
of whose pipe led to the meeting with
Lieutenant Jarvls. On January 3 the
mate and his guides started early and
had traveled nearly five miles when
they missed Mrs. Tickey. She had lost
her pipe and gone back after it. Soon
after this it was noticed that two men
were running toward the party, waving
their hats and throwing their hands up
as if to ask for an interview. They were
Lieutenant Jarvis and Dr. Call, who
would have been missed but for the fact
that Mrs. Tickey loved her pipe so well
that she forsook the party to reclaim it.
Those who saw Mrs. Tickey yesterday
as she wandered through the parks of
the city, or hurried along the streets
gazing with open-mouthed wonder
upon city scenes, could not overlook the
fact that she carried her pipe in a
buckskin sack.
"Well, I should state that there was
a great deal of dissatisfaction among
the men when we left Point Barrow.
If Lieutenant Jarvis gets through all
right he will be welcomed to take
charge, as things need direction. When
I left they were hauling fuel 20 miles
with a sled, and provisions were so
short that there was already some
wrangling over their distribution."
When Mate Tilton met Lieutenant
Jarvis the latter had 2000 miles ahead
of him before he could reach Point
Barrow. It was his intention to go to
Port Clarence, which is a reindeer
station, and try to drive 300 reindeer to
the men threatened with starvation un
less relief comes by July. Lieutenant
Berthof has taken a band of Lap
landers and natives to help him drive
the reindeer to Point Barrow,
Consulting his notebook again and
again the man who achieved th* won
derful feat of making a voyage that
most men pronounced impossible, said:
"Do not ask me for dates, for I was
too busy trying to keep alive and make
the Journey to try to keep run of the
days. I tried it once and found that I
had lost two or three days, so I gave it
up. But I will stick to it that we left
Point Barrow on the 21st of October;
and that we have figured out that we
made an average of about twenty miles
a day. It Is hard to say how many
hours we traveled daily, for sometimes
we had to lay up all day and take ad
vantage of the good weather of the
night, and at other times we could run
for eight or ten hours. Sometimes the
storm raged so at our backs that we
had to rope ourselves together to keep
from being lost and separated from one
another. Blizzards raged at our backs
that we could never have faced.
"The first thing of note that occurred
after we left Point Barrow was at
Point Hope station, where there was
some serious trouble among the natives,
which resulted in the murder of one of
them who was acting as a revenue
agent for the United States.
"I was within fifty feet of the mur
der. The dead man's name was Wa
shock, and he was formerly an inter
preter on the Bear. As I passed a
point within fifty feet of the assassi
nation I saw two natives firing as fast
as they could at Washock. who fell at
once. After he fell one of his mur
derers ran up to him and shot him in
the head, although he was already
dead. I had my rifle loaded and could
have killed the murderers, but it was
not within my Jurisdiction, and it would
have been bad policy anyhow, for the
natives would probably have taken re
venge by murdering some white men.
"The man they murdered was carry
ing out some of Captain Tuttle's orders '
about breaking up illicit distillieries, i
and this was resented by the distillers i
and their friends. The murderers lay i
in wait for their victim until he and
his wife returned on a dog sled with a I
load of wood. :
"Another murder, which was without
I any direct provocation, took place on
1 one of the rivers running into Kotzebue
Sound a short time before we were
! there. A white man named Boyad, '
'â  who had been fitted out by Captain
; Nelson of the Liebes whaling station at
! Point Hope, was murdered by a mali
cious native whose father was killed in j
18S0. Boyad was on his way up the river
where he intended to prospect for gold.
' On his way up there he stopped at a
native village and hired two natives as
i guides. One of them was Â£rom Cape
i Prince of Wales, and it seems that his
1 father had been killed in the Captain
Gllly massacre 17 years ago, during
the progress of a riot in which the na
tives were trying to capture a whaling;
I brig. The young man's father was one
' of fourteen who were shot and thrown
overboard during the fight. Though
the murderer of Boyad was a babe
when his father was killed he has been
threatening ever since he grew up that
he would kill a white man to avenge
his father's death.
"A few weeks before the murder of
Boyad the murderer tried hard to get
a shot at a white man on a schooner.
Failing in this he hired out to Boyad.
The story of the murder was told by
the other native, who accompanied
murderer and murdered on the voyage.
From his narrative it appears that
Boyad saw the murderer loading his
rifle and asked him what he was doing
" "To shoot a seal." was the reply.
" 'There is no seal here,' taid the
tourist.
" 'Y^s, there is one,' said the native.
"So Boyad turned his head to look
in the direction indicated, whereupon
the native shot him, and threatened to ,
shoot his companion unless the latter
promised not to tell how the killing oc
curred.
"The murderer made his way to Cape
Blossom, where a mission was started
last year, told the missionary that he had
not been paid for his services because
Boyad accidentally shot himself, and
was therefore paid by the missionary
for his services. Later the other native
told the truth. I used some of Boyad's j
provisions on my way down and car- j
ried a sack of Hour stained by his j
blood. If I could have found the na
tive who committed the munler I would
have shot him. This is the way they
administer law up there. Soon after
this I found some natives Â«who lived at
Cape Princo of Wales. They were go
ing to kill the murderer, but I warned
them not to do so, but to turn him over
to the Bear and let the law have its
course. There are many more natives
there who have the same sort of griev
ance, and the case ought to be made an
example to deter others from similar
crimes against white men. I find that
the bitterest natives are said to be
those who have grown to manhood
since their pirate fathers were shot.
"After leaving this part of the deso
late region which we traversed we
found nothing very startling until we
got to within fifteen miles of St. Mi
chael, where we found the steamer
Alice lying in the ice. After leaving the
Alice we went up the Yukon River.
This was a very bad trip, the cold be
ing about forty degrees below zero
most of the time.
"One night we camped out under a
drilling tent, as there was no snow. On
January 25 we came upon the steamer
Mare Island, and a ball was given in
my honor. There were only two or
three ladies aboard, but some of the
men tied handkerchiefs around their
arms to designate that they were play
ing female parts, and we danced until
nearly morning. By the way, there
was nothing to drink, and nothing is
needed, for there is nothing that will
finish a man quicker in that cold re
gion than drink. A drinking man in
an Arctic climate has no chance. The
best drink is tea or a few drops of
tabasco sauce in a glass of water. It
is wonderful how warm that stuff will
keep one. Coffee is good, but tea is
"Well, as we went on our mail pouch
began to - W heavier, so that when I
arrived in Portland T had a hundred
pounds. I started with about twenty
pounds from Point Barrow, but picked
up letters here and there through all
the Alaska country.
"At various points on the march I had
to rob the native caches of their food,
hut I always left some ammunition to
pay for the grub I took, which is a
custom of the country. Well, after we
left the Mare Island we began the peril
ous trip southward. We had a hard
trip of 320 miles to the town of An
droska. We h. 1 orders on the Alaska
Commercial Company's stores there to
refit us for .the trip. They furnished us
fresh dogs and -ortage to the Kusku
cuim River, 180 miles away. We had
an awful Journey over the mountains.
The snow and ice cut the dogs' feet
terribly so that they froze, and many
nf them had to be shot and fed to the
others.
"At Kuskucuim we found a merchant
named Lind, on whom we had orders
from the Alaska Commercial Company.
He did not belong to the company, as
we soon found, for he wanted the ex
tortionate Bum of $1000 for a dog team,
seeing that mine were nearly gone. I
:ould not give such a sum, so I reported
to Rev. Kilbuck at the mission. He
was a fine man in every way. He gave
me thirteen dogs and fitted me out so
I could get to the next mission, and
was kind enough to travel 350 miles
with me on the way. At this mission
we found ourselves Just in time to at
tend the weddinÂ°- of Rev. Mr. Rock
and Miss King, the school teacher. This
was called the tission of Nushigac.
"When we got to the Taoack River
our Government guide, F. Koltchoff,
knew the country, we started for
Nushigac and arrrived there about the
22d of February. We went to Rev.
Schoeckart's mission, where he fitted us
out with new dogs, after which he ac
companied me as far as Katmy, 400
miles away. On this march the
weather was very bad and the labor of
getting through with our provisions and
a hundred pounds of mail was very dif
ficult. For three days we had to take
refuge behind the mountains to avoid
a blizzard, and when we came out it
was snowing severely, but we had to
press on, because food was being con
sumed pretty fast. We remained in
Katmy four days on account of the
storm, loading up pretty well with pro
visions from the Alaska Commercial
Company's stores.
"Then I think I did the most danger
ous thing that ever a man undertook
in a sane- moment. I took an old scow
shaped Alaskan dory, renailed it, and
shot across the Shelikof Straits, a dan
gerous place where many boats have
heen dashed to pieces by the fury of the
waves and the treacherous character
of the surroundings. It was the most
startling trip I ever took or ever want
to take. A thick fog came up before
we got across, and I had to steer by
studying the movement of the water.
We get across and camped by 9 o'clock
that night, well satisfied that we had
performed wonders.
"We were well on the way toward the
end of our journey now, and were glad
to see a prospect of rest. For months
we had be<rn going up canyons, away
around inlets and doubling back and
around to avoid mountains, and it
seemed glorious to be in sight of the
goal. The next day we continued down
to Kadiac, and the second day arrived
at St. Paul, on Kadiac Island. There
the Alaska Commercial Company char
tered a schooner for $1200 to take us to
the island of Orca, but we came upon
the steamer Albion to which we were
transferred, and by which we were
brought to Portland. It was a great
rest to get away from the terrors we
had been fighting so long. Night after
night we had been sleeping in snow
houses which got so warm and suffo
cating sometimes that we had to dig
through them to keep from smothering,
and now we are at leisure, so that all
our faces got well. When we arrived at
St. Michael we were bleeding from the
cold as much aR if we had been cut in
the face with knives. At Portland we
were treated elegantly by the Alaska-
Yukon Transportation Company, which
i saw to our passage. Lewis, Anderson
& Co., however, showed us no mercy
I whatever. They would not recognize
i a telegram from their own house in
i San Francisco, asking them 'to treat
us right."
One of the most Interesting souvenirs
of the entire trip is the bunch of letters
; from various vessels which Mate Tilton
! and guides met on the Yukon. Each
! boat gave him a few sheets of paper
: containing a record of the passengers
aboard, together with data concerning
I the whereabouts of the craft.
The following is a copy of the records
he brought with him, showing many
names of persons well known In San
Francisco and throughout the country:

DELAY IS
SPAIN'S
NEW PLAN
Now Playing Her Last Dip=
lomatic Card to Pre=
vent War.
But the President Will To=Day
Send His Message to Con=
gress Favoring Forci=
ble Intervention.
NEW YORK, April 10.â The
Herald's Washington correspon
dent sends the following: Si
multaneously with the promul
gation of the Queen's decree
granting an armistice as sug
gested in the note of the United
States on March 29 last and
urged by the powers and the
Pope, comes an appeal from the
Madrid Government for reopen
ing negotiations with a view
of a peaceful settlement of the
general Cuban question, and all
points of difference between the
United States and Spain. Mani
festly, Spain is playing her last
diplomatic card to avert war
with the United States.
It is now a desperate move through
the medium of diplomacy for peace.
Will it succeed? The verdict certainly
ought to come this week. It has been
promised often before, but it looks now
as if the real crisis was at hand. On
the verge of action by the President,
Spain has assumed a new attitude,
â which has materially complicated the
situation, and has caused great embar
rassment to the Administration.
N'u one can tell what the outcome will
be. The President has not altered his
determination to send his message to
Congress favoring forcible intervention
as the only means of ending the war
and establishing peace and order in
Cuba. The only change, I am told,
â which will be made in the message,
which has already been accurately out
lined in the Herald, is the addition of
recent developments concerning the is
suance of the Queen's decree proclaim
ing an armistice, and the new proposi
tion made by Minister de Bernabe to
day for a settlement of the trouble
some question. These additions will be
made to the message without comment.
They will be referred to as important,
but it will l>e left to Congress to decide
as to whether it will immediately adopt
the recommendation* of the President
for armed intervention or to delay ac
tion until it is seen whether or not the
Cubans accept the request of Spain for
an armistice.
The administration authorities are
not unwilling that Congress should
delay final action for a few days, until
it is seen what effect the yueen's proc
lamation may have upon the insur
gents. No statement to this effect,
however, will be made in the message.
The President makes it clear that he
wants authority to forcibly intervene;
that such intervention is solely far the
purpose of maintaining law and order
until a. satisfactory form of govern
ment can be organized and that there
la no intention of recognizing the in
dependence of a new government until
there is a stable government to recog
nize. There is little doubt that Spain's
latest proposition will complicate mat
ters in Congress, as it has embarrassed
the administration. The Indications
to-night are that it will tend to pro
voke discussion and thereby delay ac
tion.
Much will depend upon the naval
and military movements of Spain. If
her torpedo flotilla continues to move
in this direction there is likely to be
action at once in the line of the Presi
dent's recommendations. If, on the
other hand, Spain keeps her vessels
where they are now, and shows that
she is really sincere in the determina
tion to arrange terms of peace satis
factory to the United States, the con
servative element in Congress, partic
ularly the peace-at-any-price men,
may be able to stave off action for
some days. And herein lies the possi
bility of renewed negotiations ending
in a peaceful outcome.
The peace men will exert every ef
fort to secure delay. It is not likely
that Spain's new proposition will be
any more satisfactory to Congress than
to the President, but it may cause de
lay with tho legislative branch which
it did not with tho executive. But even
if <"ongress should act at once on the
President's intervention plan, the au
thorities consider that Spain may yet
be forced to yield to all our demands
without the plans being put into effect.
The resolution which the President
wants Congress to pass is to authorize
and direct the President to use the mil
itary and naval forces, if necessary, to
end the war. It is not assumed that
Congress will name a date on which
the President is to act, BO that it will
still be discretionary with him as to
the time of putting the act into force.
"With Congress and the executive
united in favor of forcible intervention,
Spain will then have the alternative of
abandoning the island or being forced
to do so.
Concerning the developments of the
day, a member of the Cabinet made
this official statement to me to-night
after the last of the two Cabinet meet
ings held to-day:
"The President invited the Cabinet to
come to the White House to-night to
read over the message in Its completed
form. There is no change in the tone
â¢ or character of the message, and to
day's developments will have no mate
rial effect upon the policy of the ad
ministration or attitude of the country
toward Spain. There were several ver
bal amendments here and there, such
as changing an adjective or an expres
sion, but the modifications or amend
ments do not alter the general scope
of the message nor detract from its
force in the slightest particular. The
President made no change in his rec
ommendation that this Government
should intervene and end the insuffer
able conditions which prevail In Cuba,
The United States will adhere to its
original proposition that the island of
Cuba must have a defllnlte form of
government and hostilities must cease.
Nothing short of the ultimate freedom
of Cuba from Spanish domination will
be acceptable to the United States.
DEMONSTRATIONS MADE
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
MADRID, April 10, via Paris. 11:30
p. m. â Demonstrations continued in fa
vor of the army and against the Gov
ernment. The demonstrators have vis
ited the Military Club and the offices of
the Liberal newspapers. There have
been numerous arrests, and many of
the demonstrators have been injured.
REASON TO BELIEVE
LEE WAS IN DANGER
Rumors in Havana of a Plot Against
the Consul-General's
Life.
HAVANA, April 10 (via Key West).â
Havana is guarded more closely than
ever, the Arolas battalion being posted
around the limits of Vidano, the swell
suburbs of the city. Within the last
two days a number of Cubans have
been arrested and are now confined in
the Cabanas fortress, charged with
serious offenses. Some say the prison
ers have been engaged in a plot to as
sassinate United States Consul-General
Lee, and others assert that they have
been acting as spies for the United
States Government. There is no doubt
that the Spanish Government is
alarmed more than it has ever been
before, and is taking every precaution.
There are reasons to believe that there
was a plot to kill General Lee, and
that it was allowed to come to a head
by the Spanish detectives in order that
they might get credit for defeating it.
All sorts of rumors were in cir
culation yesterday, and there was
no trouble whatever in finding
a dozen men to swear to its truth.
The real impression among newspaper
men was that General Lee"s with
drawal was a shrewd move intended
to show Spain that the United States
means business. In the palace tele
grams were shown saying the Queen
Regent had agreed upon the interven
tion of Russia, that Spain would accept
$2:.0.000.000 for Cuba, end the war and
withdraw her flag.
PRESS ARRAIGNS THE
MADRID MINISTRY
Angered Because the Government Is
Willing to Grant an
Armistice.
Copyrighted, issr. by James Oordnn Bennett.
MADRID, April 10.â Public opinion
is excited and divided, but the Govern
ment is pursuing the -vise policy of
giving out no information. At the la
teat hour the feeling is confident that
the first Spanish indignation will be
swept away by a wave of good sense
of the responsible element, and that the
next twenty-four hours will bring the
country around to the sentiment that
the Government has acted in the best
interests of Spain. There is to-day pre
vailing a spirit of despondency which
is only natural. "We wanted peace,"
say nine out of ten people, "but not
in that way," referring to the armis
tice.
Coupled with this there Is a widely
expressed sentiment that complications
will follow should the insurgents refuse
to accept the terms.
The astonishment has been immense
in Madrid, and the same will be the
sentiment of the country, to the de
! mands of General Woodford and the
solicitations of the Pope. The Ministry
has replied ever so many times that
never would a truce be granted except
on the request of the insurgents. The
jingo Imparcial is furious. It says that
against all its strongly expressed
I opinions lately the Government grants
a truce to the insurgents which they
do not ask. Violent articles in several
papers have caused their seizure.
SPANISH RABBLE
AT MADRID PARADES
MADRID, Apri 10.â A large crowd is
still parading the Puerta del Sol crying
"Long live Spain!" and "Long live the
army!" The civil Governor of Madrid
is among them, promenading up and
down and begging them to dispei-se
peacefully.
The crowd, relying upon the kind
heartedness of the Governor, â whom the
population of Madrid adore, refuses to
disperse and is bent on visiting tliÂ«
military club to make a demonstration
of sympathy. The authorities prohibit
the formation of groups in front of the
military club and in the vicinity of the
American legation. General Castelvl
was offered at the military' club a ban
ner to head the demonstration, but he
refused, alleging that the crowd was
composed of the dregs of the city. Sev
eral of the ringleaders have been ar
rested, the civil Governor threatening
to call out the civic guards if the crowd
does not disperse.
WILL DIRECT 1/I'KINLEY
TO END CUBAN WAR
NEW YORK, April 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: A con
ference of leading Republican and
Democratic Senators was held to-night
at the residence of Senator Allison to
discuss the form of resolution to be
adopted. Among the Senators present
were Messrs. Aldrlch, Spooner, Gor
man, Gray and Jones of Arkansas. Af
ter the conference broke up one of the
Senators told me that it had been de
cided that the resolution should be
substantially in these words:
"Resolved by the Senate and Hmue
of Representatives of the United States
in Congress. That the President be
and he is hereby empowered and di
rected to take such action as will bring
to an immediate termination hostilities
in Cuba and to establish a stable gov
ernment by and for the people of that
island, and that he is hereby empow
ered and directed to use the land and
naval forces of the United States if
necessary, to bring about that result"

NEW YORK, April 10.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Congress is inclined to regard the Span
ish proposition for an armistice in Cuba
as merely another attempt on the part
of the Spanish to gain time. Senators
and Representatives with whom I have
talked to-day are almost unanimously
of the opinion that this latest move of
the Spanish Government is an effort to
again involve the United States in the
meshes of diplomacy, with the hope
that some arrangement may yet be ee- t
fected which will leave the Spanish flag
floating over Cuba,
There is much impatience in both
houses. Many Republicans talk of dis
regarding any recommendations foT
further delay that the President may
make, and acting also in the direction
of armed intervention. Few of them
are willing to talk on this line for pub
lication. They want to wait and see
what the President will say in his mes
sage to-morrow, and learn whether
the Spanish proposition looks to the
near and linal settlement of the Cuban
question, and the Maine affair as well.
No proposition will be acceptable to
Congress that does not provide for
some adequate reparation for the blcnv
ing up of the Maine.
Representative Wheeler of Alabama,
whose view of the situation is much
more conservative than that of most of
the members with whom. I talked, said
to me:
"The action of Spain in proposing an
armistice would seem to make consid
erable change in the situation. If the
Spanish Government proposes in good
faith to feed the starving Cubans, on
whose account we had proposed to in
tervene, and offers to grant an armis
tice, it seems to me that takes some of
the wind out c-f our sails as far as the
condition of the Cubans is concerned.
The Maine affair still remains, how
ever. If our Government takes the
stand that the ship was blown up by
Spanish officials, it would seem to me
that war must result from that. Unless
Spain punishes the perpetrators of that
outrage, we must punish Spain."
While none c-f the leaders in either
house of Congress is prepared to make
any positive prediction as to the course
to be pursued, in advance of the receipt
of the President's message to-morrow,
the mc-st of them take the ground that
Spain's latest proposition will have no
effect whatever upon the action of Con
gress. I have talked with Republican
members of the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs, and find that a con
siderable majority of them are in favor
c-f immediate action, and one of them
expressed the conviction that an inter
vention resolution would pass the
House not later than Tuesday evening.
The sentiment in the Senate Commit
tee on Foreign Relations in favor of
acting in disregard of Spain's procla
mations is, if anything, stronger than
in the House committee. Senator For
aker, one of the members on this com
mittee, said he did not believe the prop
osition of Spain would have any effect
whatever. There are some Btrong forces
at work In the Senate to prevent hasty
action, and it is quite probable that
those Senators who favor immediate
action will not be able to bring it about,
for while they are undoubtedly in the
majority in the Senate, under the rules
of that body they will be unable to
force a vote.
With srrme few exceptions the Dem
ocrats of both houses are for action,
and will oppose any delay whatever on
account of Spain's proposition to grant
an armistice.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 10.
Upon the presumption that Spain's
offer of an armistice to the Cuban in
surgents will make no change in the
plans of the administration and that
the President's message will go to Con
gress to-morrow, the House this week
i will make history. In anticipation of
stirring scenes and momentous action,
every Congressman has been besieged
by hundreds of friends for tickets to
the reserved gallerioe, and the general
multitude that takes its chances in the
public galleries on the principle of "first
come, first served," are prepared to as
sault the Capitol at dawn to-morrow.
It is likely that hundreds will camp out
on the marble steps all night, so in
tense is the desire to be present when
the message is read. The public gener
ally regards the message as the pro
logue to a drama which may end in
war before the curtain goes down.
After the message is read to-morrow
it will probably be referred to the Com
mittee nn Foreign Relations without de
bate. Such is the programme to which
both sirli-s have practically assented,
with tlv tacit understanding that the
committee will report on Tuesday the
resolutions upon which the House will
be expected to act. Any individual at
tempt to frustrate this part of the pro
gramme will prove abortive.
With the rravity of the situation con
fronting them, members on both sides
have been sobered and seem impressed
with the idea that things should pro
ceed in a regular and orderly way. It
seems almost certain now that there
will be a conflict both in the committee
and the House as to the nature of the
resolutions upon which the House will
be called upon to act. Individual views
vary greatly, from those who desire a
direct declaration of war, based on the
theory that the blowing up of the
Maine was a hostile act, to the few who
are opposed to any action whatever.
But the real contest, of course, will be
between those who desire to follow
what is now generally accepted as the
President's recommendation, and those
who desire the recognition of the Cu
ban republic.
The Democrats, both of the commit
tee and the House, have taken an un
equivocal position for the recognition
of independence, although there is a
, difference of opinion as to whether in-
I tervention should follow. A majority
of the Republicans of the committee
have within a few days declared them-
I dence. Two of themâ Messrs. Quigg of
| New York and Henry of Indianaâ
i while they do not favor recognition of
! the existing republic, have earnestly
I advocated a declaration to the effect
that Spain's dominion over the island
I cease, leaving to the future the ques
tion of the actual government of the
Island. But in the desire of the Re
publicans of both houses to secure har
mony of action, some of the advocates
of independence have about come to
the conclusion that the difference be
tween armed intervention and recogni
tion is more technical than substan
tial, as, unless the island should be an
nexed, to which they are opposed, a
republican form of government for the
island must follow.
It seems probable that existing dif
ferences may at least to some extent
be adjusted, and, whether all the Re
publicans agree to a resolution de
claring for intervention only or not,
P-esolution will be reported. It
qually certain that a resolu
â¢ the independence, possibly
with intervention, will be pre
y the minority.
?ek in the Senate probably will
i entirely to the Cuban ques
'he President's message is
counted upon to arrive soon after the
assembling at noon to-morrow. it
will be referred promptly to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations and the
present understanding is that no re
port will be made by the committee
before Tuesday. The report may, in
case of the development of radical dif
ferences in the committee, be delayed
to even a later day.
There is a decidedly strong disposi
tion on the part of the many Senators
who are not members of the commit
tee to have the Senate as a body take
up the subject of the shaping of the
committee's report, contemporaneous
ly with the committee, and it is not
improbable that a secret session of the
Senate may be Â»>eld with this purpose
In view.

NAVAL PLAN
OF ATTACK,
Copyright, 1898, by James Gordon Ben
nett.
KEY WEST, April 10.âMoni
tors Terror, Puritan and Amphi
trite have been ordered to join the
battleship off Sandy Key light.
This move at this time is accept
ed here as evidence that the fleet
is making final preparations to
move without the least delay
when the order comes. The mon
itors are, of course, slower than
other vessels, but will play a
great part in the formation of
the first line of attack.
Some changes in the plan of
attack have now been decided
upon. Morro Castle will not be
shelled because of the prisoners
there, and Cabanas will escape
for the same reason in case the
trouble between Spain and the
United States aroes beyond tar
get practice. As it is known
that prisoners are still con
fined in some of the cells, it is
thought advisable to concentrate
the fire on the batteries of Santa
Clara, and the twelve-inch bat
tery near Morro Castle. The
castle itself is not formidable
unless one accepts the story that
its walls have been breeched to
the outer skin and a battery of
big guns mounted inside which
will be unmasked should hostil
ities be begun. It seems likely
that, should war come, the affair
at Havana would begin with a
brief artillery duel between the
lowa and her consorts and the
guns of Santa Clara battery and
ordnance guns and the two
twelve-inch rifles planted near
Morro a year ago.

KEY WEST, Fla., April 10.â There
was no Easter Sunday in Key West to
day. The arrival of General Lee and
the widespread curiosity to get a
glimpse of the hero of the hour
brought the entire population into the
streets and to the docks. Hundreds of
refugees mingled with the crowds ex
citedly discussing the situation. When
General Lee departed the interest was
attracted toward the preparations on
the bay ajid water front. There was
enough action there to claim their at
tention throughout the long hot after
noon.
Activity on the warships was more
noticeable than for several days. That
General Lee was safely away from
Havana seemed to put new life in na
val officers and to bring revenge for
the Maine victims into the perspective
of the present week. The cruiser Hel
ena lay at the Government dock com
pleting her coaling, necessary after
her trip across the Atlantic, while a
detail of naval mechanics from the
Brooklyn Navy Yard hastened repairs
on her tower, somewhat shaken by the
voyage. A full complement of officers
and sailors industriously worked to
clear away the woodwork and put the
ship in fighting trim by night. At an
other dock a few yards distant was
the formidable monitor Puritan, which
arrived from Hampton Roads Friday
night. The Puritan was also coaling
and was almost stripped for action.
Further along was the lighthouse
tender Mangrove. Ensign Palmer, who
was detailed from the flagship New
York to command the Mangrove, set
to work with a rush. He succeeded in
enlisting an entire crew, men showing
surprising readiness to volunteer. Two
six-pounder rifles will be mounted fore
and aft, with broadsides of four rapid
fire guns. The Mangrove is entirely
unarmored, but will be effective
against torpedo-boats on picket duty.
She will be ready to put to sea Tues
day if the fleet sails. Out in the har
bor in full view of the crowded docks
one could see gun drills on the Terror,
Detroit and Marblehead.
The few officers on shore discussed
the probability of soon getting to Ha
vana to avenge the Maine victims and
insults to General Lee. On the docks
where warships are being repaired the
marines kept spectators at a distance.
On the big bartle-ship outside the bar
was the same activity. Sunday reli
gious t rvices on fleet were sacrificed
for final preparations, being: the first
time Easter has passed without serv
ices in twenty-five years. An extra
supply of water was sent aboard all
warships.
The officers refuse to entertain the
belief of the possibility of further de
lay on the part of the President and
Congress, and they expect sailing or
ders not later than Wednesday.
The possibility that the armistice
may be accepted is not credited by the
superior officers of the fleet, who think
the insults to General Lee, added to
the Maine explosion, are enough to war
rant war. There is suppressed excite
ment about the hotel where many of
ficers are quartered. Nothing was
talked of but an approaching attack.
ALL THE SQUADRONS
READY FOR ACTION.
Commanding- Officers of Vessels Now
Await Orders to Proceed Against
Spanish Ports.
NEW YORK, April 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: If
Congress to-morrow directs forcible In
tervention In Cuba, the navy Is pre
pared to carry out Its mandate at once.
Reports received at the Navy Depart
ment from Captain Sampson, corn
mandins the North Atlantic squadron,
Commodore W. S. Schley. commanding
the flying squadron, and Commodore
George Dewey, commanding the
Asiatic squadron, state that the ves
sels under their command are ready for
action. In accordance with instruc
tions given them by the strategic
board, approved by Secretary Long,
they have advised the commanding offi
cers of the ships attached to their re
spective fleets of the part they are ex
pected to play in prospective battles,
and copies of plans are in possession of
subordinates of the fleet c ;nmanders
for their study. Captain S^.npson has
under his command at Key West a
fleet of twenty-two warships, besides
the supply ship Pern and tugs which
will act as picket boats. This fleet is
to be re-enforced by the monitor Mian
tonomah, which will sail this week
from League Island; the gunboat Ban
croft, repairing at Boston; the dispatch
boat Dolphin, the dynamite cruiser Ve
suvius, and ram Katahdin. When the
merchant steamers purchased last week
by the Rodgers board are ready for
service two will be assigned to Captain
Sampson's fleet and two to the flying
squadron.
Commo-dore Schley's command is at
present composed of five vessels, and j
should war be deferred for another j
week the San Francisco and New Or- |
leans will be added to it, besides sev- !
eral steam colliers. In the event of
war being declared this force will be
joined at Porto Rico or some other con- j
venient point by the New York, In- i
diana and lowa and the protected
cruisers of Captain Sampson's com- |
mand, and this combination will be one
which Spain's navy will meet only to i
invite destruction.
When this is accomplished the Amer
ican men-of-war under Captain Samp
son can proceed leisurely with the work
of blockading Porto Rican and Cuban
ports, leaving Commodore Schley's
fleet to harass the Spanish coast. So
far as the American squadron at Hong
kong is concerned, it is the belief of offi
cials that it will be able to destroy the
small Spanish gunboats in Philippine
waters and reduce the fortifications of
the ports of the islands without trouble.
The squadron now under Commodore
Dewey's command consists of the
Olympia, his flagship, the cruisers Bos
ton and Raleigh and gunboats Concord
and Petrel. This force will be -increased
within a day or so by the protected
cruiser Baltimore, which left Honolulu
for Hongkong c-n March 25. Spain's na
val forces in the Philippines consists of
six antiquated cruisers. The largest of
these is the Castila, a wooden vessel of
3400 tons, and the remaining five are be
tween'lo3o and 1500 tons. Opposed to the

SINGULAR STATEMENT.
Prom Mrs. Rank to Mrs. Pinkham.
The following letter to Mrs. Pink-
ham from Mrs. M. Rank, No. 2,354
East Susquehanna Aye., Philadelphia,
Pa., is a remarkable statement of re-
lief from utter discouragement. She
says:
" I never can find words with which
to thank you for what Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has done
for me.
" Some years ago I had womb trouble
and doctored for a long time, not see-
ing any improvement. At times I
would feel well enough, and other
times was miserable. So it went on
until last October, I felt something
terrible creeping over me, I knew not
what, but kept getting worse. 1 can
hardly explain my feelings at that
time. I was so depressed in spirits
that I did not wish to live, although I
had everything to live for. Had hys-
teria, was very nervous; could not
sleep and was not safe to be left
alone.
" Indeed, I thought I would lose my
mind. No one knows what I endured.
" 1 continued this way until the last
of February, when I saw in a paper a
testimonial of a lady whose ease was
similar to mine, and who had been
cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta-
ble Compound. I determined to try it,
and felt better after the first dose. I
continued taking it, and to-day am a
well woman, and can say from my
heart, 'Thank God for such a medi-
cine.'"
Mrs. Pinkham invites all suffering-

PAN JOSE, April 10.â The figures
given herewith are the result of a
}Â,â¢. â to-houÃe canvass made by joint
committees composed of members of
the New Charter Club, the Good Gov
ernment League and the Liberty Club.
They Include most of Jhe voters in all
of the twenty precincts of the city ex
cept the Third, Ninth and Twentieth.
In the Third, it is estimated, the vote
will be about evenly divided, while in
the Ninth and Twentieth majorities
are expected for the New Charter Club
ticket. In the list of "doubtful" are
those who would give no information
OB to how they intended to vote, those
who may still be influenced to vote the
Charter Club ticket, and, in some cases,
those who couid not be seen by the
canvassers. Under "mixed" are includ
ed those who will vote a ticket made up
partly of Charter Club candidates and
partly of the people's or "gang" ticket.
The voters who wore put down as "fur"
the charter ticket, expressed them
selves as intending to vote the Char
ter Club ticket straight from Sanford
E. Smith for Mayor to D. C. Vestal,
the last-named candidate for the ap
pointing board.
This canvass was made indiscrimi
nately and comprises more than three
fifths of the entire registered voters.
If the doubtful and mixed vote is
evenly divided, and a similar propor
tion to that here shown holds for the
entire vote cast to-morrow, the Char
ter Club ticket will win by a ma
jority of between 700 and SOO votes.
Even should all the doubtful votes
be credited to the ticket opposed to
pood government, the Charter Club
ticket will still come out the victor. In
only three of the precincts was a ma
jority shown for the "gang" ticket in
this canvass.
As the result of the campaign of edu
cation that has been going on for the
past several weeks the people are now
fully aroused to the situation. They
realize that this is a fight on the part
of the people interested In the success
of the Charter Club ticketâ not for the
honors and spoils of office, but for the
emancipation of the city of San Jose
from the corrupt and destructive
rule of bossism that the city
may make that advance in the march
of progress, development and prosper
ity commensurate with its many natu
ral and exceptional advantages.
On the other hand, they realize the
desperate, determined, and in many
cases, unprincipled efforts made by the
boss and his henchmen for the election
Robinson Crusoe Rea and His Man Friday See Footprints Ahead.

of the candidates on the so-called Peo
ple's Municipal ticket is a batle for
spoils and for the perpetuation of
boodling, jobbery and corruption in of
fice, with all their attendant evils of
high taxation, stagnation and hard
times.
A vote for the straight Charter Club J
ticket means a vote for political, com- j
mercial and personal liberty. A vote |
for the "'pang" ticket means continued |
bundage and tribute to the boss and hi^
henchmen.
Every candidate on the Charter Club
ticket is absolutely independent and
untrammelled, without obligations to
any person or to any clique, except to
perform his duty to the people of the
city of San Jose that they may have a
government that will make their city
a model for municipal political reform
ers.
Every candidate on the People's Mu
nicipal or "gang" ticket is dependent
upon or obligated in some way to Boss
Rea. and is, therefore, bound to con
sider Rea's wishes in the administra
tion of the city's affairs whenever h^
chooses to make them known. And
even if the boss did not control every
man on that ticket it would be an un
safe experiment to vote for them, as
it is absolutely certain that he controls
at least a majority of them. In the
absence of any disavowal, however, by
any of the candidates that they are
being supported by the boss and the
"gang," despite the repeated charges
that such is the case, it is fair to pre
sume that the boss is back of them all
and will exact his reward when the
time and circumstances suit him.
Safety lies only in a vote for the Char
ter Club ticket without a single
scratch or omission.
There was an invasion on a small
scale by political heelers from San
Francisco and as far away as Sa<-ra
m^nto to-night. Some of these came
on railroad passes sent to them by
"Johnnie" Mackenzie. In consequence
of this importation by the "gang" a
hot time is expected at the polls, where
fraud will undoubtedly be attempted
on an unprecedented scale.
Anticipating something of this kind,
owing to the forlorn outlook for the
"gang" ticket, the good government
forces have made ample provision to
protect the purity of the ballot. A thor
ough investigation has been made of all
the names on the great and supplemen
tal registers, and several hundred

names have been discovered that do not
belong thereon. A list of these has been
compiled, and at every precinct the
Charter Club and its allied organiza
tions will have a challenger, whose duty
it shall be to see that none of these
would-be ballot stuffers are allowed to
V"t.i. Should any one who is not en
titled to vote swear in his vote, he will
be promptly arrested.
A reward of $50 has been offered by
the Charter Club for the conviction of
each offender.
In the First Precinct it has been
found that forty-one men are regis
tered from the New York Exchange
Hotel, and that but sixteen living there
are entitled to vote. There are only
twenty-six guests there at the present
time.
In the Second Precinct the name of.
one dead man !s on the register. There
are eleven names of non-residents, and
three are registered from vacant houses.
In the Third ten are registered from
vacant houses.
In the Fourth three are on the regis

In the Fifth six are registered from
vacant houses and three in St. James
square, in which there are no buildings.
In the Sixth, two are registered who
were never heard of at the places they
gave as their residences, and six are
registered from vacant houses.
In the Seventh, two were found reg

â¢ In the Eighth, no less than eighty
registered from vacant houses, five
from vacant lots, and several from
houses the numbers of which could not
be found.
In the Tenth, twenty-two non-resi
dents were found.
In the Eleventh, one registered from
a vacant house.
In the Twelfth, twelve registered
from the â  Normal School square, in
which there are no private buildings,
two from vacant houses, and one from

THE ''ENTHUSIASn
As this is the third week, one would naturally imagine that the interest
had somewhat abated, but quite the contrary. Notwithstanding the enthusi-
astic reception- of last Saturday, when at certain stages of the day it looked as
though the whole town was in our house, notwithstanding all this, we are
asked to give the third week of this classic sale of Spring Suits and Spring

THE COMMERCIAL SITUATION.
THE feature of last week was a sensible diminu
tion in the demand for staple goods throughout
the country. This decrease was due, as' far as
could be seen, to unseasonable cold weather and to
the discouragement of new business by the. general
expectation of war. The West, which for some weeks
has been the center of mercantile activity, reported
that the heavy rush of spring business was about over
and that current orders for goods are to complete
broken assortments. The South reported a good
enough trade, though the export of staples was ex
hibiting a check on account of the raising of marine
insurance rates consequent upon the disturbed for
eign outlook. There has also been a great frost
throughout the East and South which has played
havoc with the fruit crop of both sections and like
wise damaged the tobacco crop of the latter. The
Northwest continued to report a good business, and
there was no failing off on the Pacific Coast as far as
could be sti-n.
Still the country is considerably ahead of last year,
according to the bank clearings, which showed a
gain last week of 26.3 per cent over the corresponding
week in 1897. The commercial failures were 220,
against 232 for the same week last year. These fig
ures do not show any ialling off in business, but, on
the contrary, an increase. The diminution in the
volume of trade, therefore, is simply a slackening in
the extraordinary movement of merchandise which
has characterized the past few months and which has
been greater than ever before known in the United
States. As for Wall street, that interesting mart, we
are told, has undergone about all the liquidation it is
likely to see for the present, war or no war. It has
discounted the Spanish trouble, the public have gen
erally drawn out, and it is said that stocks are now in
strong hands and closely held, so that the floating
supply is small. This means that somebody is going
to make money in Wall street before long, and that
somebody is not the public.
The leading staples are about the same as last week.
The iron trade is still doing a rushing business, but
it is becoming evident that it is on previous orders,
and that new business is small. Dry goods are dull,
as buyers are wary about taking hold until they know
better how the affair with Spain is going to turn out.
Wool, hides, leather and the other important staples
are equally quiet, and for the same reason. The grain
trade keeps up well, the exports from Atlantic ports
last week being 50 per cent larger than for the same
week in 1897.
The feature of trade in San Francisco last week
was the sensational advance in cereals at the close
owing to the dry weather. Nobody in the trade now
expects large crops of anything. It is too late. There
will be plenty for the usual local consumption and a
surplus for export, but that surplus will be small
compared with the ordinary year. High prices
will probably rule the balance of the year in conse
quence, and that farmer who gets a crop will make
money. Wheat went up to $i 55Â®! 60 for the com
mon shipping descriptions and $1 65 for extra choice.
Flour advanced 25 cents per barrel. Barley soared
to $1 .15. with lively trading on call, where the longs,
seizing their opportunity, gave the shorts an unmer
ciful squeezing. Oats, corn and rye went up with the
two leaders, and there was a general advance in mill
stuff?. Hay continued its upward course, with ex
cellent prospects for a further rise. This stnple will
be an article of luxury this year unless all current
signs fail. The prosaic bean, too. caught the fever,
and on Saturday there was a general advance, par
ticularly in Limas, which were affected by the de
creased acreage and the dry weather. The reported
partial destruction of the Eastern crop by frost cre
ated another factor in favor of better quotations for
canned and dried fruit later on in the season, but thus
far the market has made little or no response to the
bullish conditions which have recently risen in the
fruit trade. It will probably respond further along in
the season, however.
The present year is bound to be an interesting one
to the farmer. He who gets a crop will be in clover,
and he who does not will have to accept tb> situation
with the best grace possible. The State will doubt
less average up well enoiiÃli. thanks to its wonder
fully diversified climate. It is one of the beauties of
California that the very conditions which damage one
section of the State produce successful results in sev
eral others.
Merchandise is meeting with the usual demand on
local and export account, and fluctuations are about
average. Sugar has advanced, coal has declined and
several other staples have moved about somewhat.
The money market remains undisturbed, funds being
in abundant supply at the usual rates of interest.
There is no probability that the report of McKin
ley's intention to dismiss his private secretary has a
word of truth in it. Mr. Porter has evidently pone so
far as to offend a yellow correspondent by declining

THE MESSAGE.
BY the great mass of the American people the
President's message to Congress on the con
troversy with Spain is awaited this morning
with an eagerness in which there is no feeling of
anxiety. On all sides there is confidence that the
President will uphold the honor of the nation in all
its just demands, and that whether the issue is peace
or war the course of our Government will have the
approval of civilization and humanity.
It is everywhere that we are on the
verge of war. Some hopes may still exist that Spain
by yielding to the rightful claims of the United States
on terms that we can accept may open a way for the
continuance of peace, but such hopes are not founded
on any substantial basis. They are the offspring ot
sentiment rather than of reason. Even those who
cherish them because of an innate abhorrence of war
hardly expect to see them realized. Throughout the
country the impression prevails that the argument has
been exhausted by diplomacy and that the issue now
must be Jeft to the dread arbitrament of the sword.
Moreover, if war is to come at all it will in all like
lihood come immediately. Congress will probably
act upon the message as soon as it is received. The
majority in the Senate and in the House have long
since made up their minds upon the controversy and
upon the course the nation should pursue. There
will be of course some speech-making, but not much.
The chances are that if the President's message shows
that Spain is still resolved to deny the justice which
we demand action may be at once taken in both
houses. Before this day closes, therefore, war may
be declared and the battle begun.
The cause of the United States is one which we can
willingly submit to the judgment of any tribunal the
conscience of man recognizes. Our right to demand
redress for the wreck of the Maine and for the ter
mination of the horrors of war in Cuba is justifiable
by the law of nations, the dictates of civilization and
the instincts Â©f humanity. Whether we have the sym
pathies of other countries or not in the contest counts
for nothing. The right and the might of the quarrel
are under the flag of the Union, and we can go for
ward careless of what may be thought or said in
other lands. There may be hostility in some quarters
of civilized Europe to-day, but as sure as that truth
and justice are honored in the long run, our course
will eventually receive the commendation of his
torians and good men in all countries.
How long the threatened war is likely to last is a
question few Americans have thought it worth while
to seriously discuss. It is significant that with the
exception of the stock markets in Wall street hardly
any American industry has been affected by the men
ace of the war. The general trade and business of
the people have gone along as undisturbed as if a
wat with Spain were a matter of no moment.
This sanguine feeling may be one of over-confi
dence, but it shows at any rate the attitude of the
nation. We are confident not only of our cause, but
of our strength, and the President's message, even if
it leads to immediate war, will still be welcome to the
country. It is in that mood that Congress and the
people wait this morning. Whatever duty the issue
imposes will be met with courage, patriotism and
confidence.
WAR f?ND FINANCE.
WAR will speedily disclose the vexatious con
dition of our financial system and call the
country's attention sharply to the need of re
form.
Experience proves that no nation can carry on war
and civil administration concurrently out of current
revenues. The Morrill tariff of 1862 was pressed and
passed as a war measure to approximate revenue to
expenditure, but in that respect was a failure.
As in the war of 181 2 and that with Mexico, the
treasury was compelled to issue evidences of debt and
to borrow on bonds.
The Senate having recently affirmed by resolution
that our bonds now outstanding may be paid in sil
ver at the option of the Government, and that de
claration being based on the existing law authorizing
the issue of bonds, it will be seen that a Government
call for a loan, under such law, is adumbrated by the
Senate's action. As a borrower the Government is
no more than an individual. Its ability, to raise
money by loans is limited by the same conditions.
Among these is the ability to contract for the pay
ment of the loan in the same value as that which it
receives.
If war continue for a period which makes a bond
issue necessary, the whole financial issue will be pre
cipitated. It is probable that the Government will
not be able to borrow on a gold basis without prom
ising to pay on the same basis. Then Congress, if not
in session, will be convened to effect the needed
change in the law and provide for gold payment if
gold is borrowed.
This will test the patriotism of the silver members.
War cannot be waged without money. With the
country's honor at stake, with our navy at sea and
our land forces in action and revenues all devoted to
the civil administration which must be maintained at
home, we will see what the advocates of the silver
standard will do.
They will probably attempt to compel recourse to
an issue similar to the greenback emission. Such
issue, however, w ? ould be affected by the ability of the
Government to redeem it in the par money of the
world, and as its volume increases so w-ould its dis
count, and we will go back to the foot of the
ladder, where we stood in 1868, when resumption was
undertaken by the funding of the greenbacks and
liquidation of the floating debt left by the Civil War.
Out of it all the country may learn that prosperity
in peace and power in war are alike dependent upon
sound finance.
If this probable issue arise within the next few
months we will see who will be found standing by
the administration and who will be against it by put
ting upon it the most serious embarrassment that can
come to a nation engaged in a military struggle.
The taxpayer is the final party in interest. He
must provide out of his substance the money that
pays armies and navies and fights battles. An issue
of credit notes, like the greenbacks, which fall below
par, increases the cost of war in exact proportion to
its discount. If it be 50 per cent below par it means
that, purchasing in that medium, the Government has
to pay a double price for every shot fired and every
ration issued, for it is bound to redeem its credit at
par. as it did the greenbacks when they were funded.
These details may be outside the daily knowledge
of the busy taxpayer, but he gets knowledge of them
in the form of increased taxation, which always fol
lows an unsound system of national finance.
Terms mentioned by Spain as the only ones upon
which she will consent to put in^o operation the
justly celebrated armistice seem only to embody fresh
inÂ«ult to this country. There can be no ground for
making an arrangement which for its integrity must
in any measure depend upon the honor of Spain.
THE SAX FRAJS CISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1898.
"ESPEREN VOLVERNOS."
THE departure of Consul-General Lee and Vice-
Consul Springer from Havana was made the
occasion of an exhibition of studied insolence on
the part of General Blanco and of open insults on the
part of his subordinate officers and the Spanish popu
lace. Every indignity short of actual violence which
rage could prompt mean and cowardly natures to
commit was thrown in the face of the representatives
of the United States. The general refused to see
them, the lesser officers of the Palace sneered at them,
the mob howled and hooted, and as a last taunt the
Alfonso XII swung round at her anchor in the har
bor and showed her menacing guns to the Fern as
the American ship started on her outward voyage.
All this array of insult, insolence and threats was
borne with dignity but not without wrath on the part
of the Americans. From the deck of the Fern they
sent back to Blanco, Havana and to Spain words of
defiance that will be echoed throughout the United
States wherever the news is read " this morning.
Brave, manly words V they were; fitting answers to the
coarse epithets and offensive insults with which the
Americans had been assailed.
"You may tell Mr. Blanco for me," said General
Lee to the pilot, "that the Fern will be the last ship of
the American navy that will ever go out of Havana
harbor while the Spanish flag flies over Morro." The
farewell of Consul Springer was more laconic still.
He sent back to the mob the phrase "Esperen
volvernos" (await our return").
The American people will take these words as if
uttered by themselves. The two phrases will furnish
the war cry of the nation. Let Blanco and Havana
await our return. It will not be long. Such insults
to the representatives of the United States, made at
the very spot where cowardly treachery sent to death
a crew of American seamen, adds the last spark
needed to explode the wrath of the people into swift
and terrible action.
American warships will return to Havana. They
will go there prepared to meet the guns of the Al
fonso XII and all her consorts of the Spanish navy.
They will go there, moreover, to stay until the Span
ish flag is hauled down from Morro. The prophecy
of Lee shall be fulfilled, and Blanco and all his black
guards shall speedily have occasion to remember the
"esperen volvernos" sent back as a farewell message
from the Fern.
ZOLA OND THE FRENCH-
IT is gratifying to note from the European press
that there is already observable in Paris something
of a reaction from the violent antagonism aroused
against Zola during his recent trial. Since the judg
ment against him has been set aside on appeal the
reaction will serve him in good stead if he should be
brought to trial again, and might possibly lead to
his acquittal and possibly to a reconsideration of the
case against Dreyfus.
The Westminster Gazette in reviewing the case
states that an evidence of the reaction is to be seen
in the comparatively large subscriptions which have
been collected to defray the cost of Zola's defense,
and also in the responses that have been made to an
appeal to the women of France to unite in a petition
to the Government to undo the wrong done to Drey
fus. It is further noted that signs of popular feeling
against the Jews are decreasing, and finally the Ga
zette says: "It may yet be possible that the prisoner
of the He dv Diable will have a chance of vindicating
himself In some way which will be in greater harmony
with uncoerced justice than the proceedings of the
Zola trial."
Whether the reaction will ever reach the extent
which the friends of Zola so confidently expect may
be questioned, but that it will go far is not inherently
improbable. The French are not an unjust nor vin
dictive people. Their rage is sudden and furious, but
it has none of the elements of lasting and ineradic
able hate. Their civil wars have beert as fierce as any
in history, but when once the passion of battle had
spent its force the members of the contending fac
tions soon fraternized again. Catholics and
Huguenots ceased to cut one another's throats
in France long before religious animosities died
out in other lands, and royalists and republicans
that raged for each other's blood during the Revolu
tion harmonized to a great extent a few years
after, and many of them served as comrades in the
legions that bore the eagles of Napoleon over all
Europe.
It is in French nature that there should be a re
action from the fury that broke out against Zola be
cause of his defense of Dreyfus, and it is to be hoped
there will be an equal reaction from the rage against
Dreyfus himself. That evidences of the changed feel
ing are so soon apparent is in itself a good sign. The
whole civilized world is interested in this remark
able controversy and will be glad of an outcome
which will not only do justice to the two victims of
Parisian wrath, but will show that Paris herself is
capable of atoning for the wrongs she commits as
soon as she has the calmness to listen to the voices of
her better nature.
Spain's Embassador to England says that war be
tween his country and the United States would last
for years and perhaps ruin both. There are reasons for
believing him in error. In the first place the diffi
culty of ruining a ruin is obvious. It is analogous to
the old and unsolved problem of spoiling an egg well
advanced in decay. Of course America might be
ruined, but so might the earth be wiped out by the
swish of a comet's tail. There is no use in worrying
about remote possibilities.
Senor Quesada of the Junta keeps on saying what
that body will and will not consent to as to the future
of Cuba. He might as well accept the existing fact
that affairs have progressed to such a point that the
Junta is no longer playing first fiddle. That dis
tinguished body must inevitably accept whatever may
be tendered after the banners of Spain shall have left
the island.
It is getting a little late in the game for seamen to
desert on the pretext that there has been nothing
done to avenge the loss of the Maine. People, view
ing the active war preparations, might ascribe ex
actly an opposite motive.
The patriots who burned the boy King of Spain in
effigy might easily have been in better business. Al
most any business short of robbing clothes lines
would come under this head.
Rev. Edwards Davis ought to return from his evan
gelistic tour long enough to convert his old flock
from the idea that while guiding them he misguided
the funds .of the church.
Perhaps it is not a violation of confidence to remark
that Steve Elkins as a Presidential adviser is not up
to the Hanna standard, and that confidence in Hanna
is less than unanimous.
The "musical wonder" is becoming so common that
soon the only child not to be regarded as a wonder
will be the one who isn't "a wonder."
MUST I GET OUT?
From the A*etr York Herald.
OUR CHANCES WITH SPAIN.
BY WILLIAM C. BOYNS.
In yesterday's Examiner Ambrose
Bierce had a sermon of "warning,"
I the text being our possible war with
' Spain. No critic is due more deference
on such matters than he, for not only
is he an able writer, but he is familiar
with his subject, having had the very
consider ble advantage of being a staff
officer in a great war. Members of the
staff of a commander in action learn
much more than others of the force
have any chance to. Yet I venture to
disagree with Mr. Bierce in his ideas as
to what it is likely will occur if we war
with Spain. To begin with he says:
"The lasÂ»t word has not been spoken in
the ship market, and it may well be that
by secret purchases Spain has reduced
the disparity; not all the purchases of
warships are bulletined."
I dissent. Spain sees as clearly as we
that war *!s imminent, and she knows,
too, that no great power will permit
any juggling in the turning over of war
vessels to either of the combatants four
hours or so before hostilities commence.
The consent of the Government for
which a warship is being, or has been,
built, is necessary before a sale is pos
sible by the constructors, for they,
much like other business men, wish to
keep customers when they once have
them.
I quote again:
"If" (the value of the torpedo is great)
"the disparity between the naval strength
of the United States and that of Spain,
as they stood before the present activity
in purchase of ships, is not nearly so
great as is complacently affirmed."
No doubt the torpedo boat question is
a serious one, but it seems to me that a
torpedo flotilla is not nearly such a
bugbear as most people imagine. These
tiny craft have no coal endurance, and
detached even a couple of hundred
miles from their port of refuge they
are much at the mercy of a skilled
naval tactician who has cruisers at his
command. I do not wish to be mis
understood; I am talking of the weak
ness of a torpedo flotilla for offensive
purposes. The value of a dozen torpedo
boats or destroyers attached to a
squadron of battleships and cruisers,
is another matter. Then they
must be carefully reckoned with in
dubitably. Alone, a "mosquito fle.et"
does not constitute a very serious men
ace, although it 'is pretty evident that
the administration has insisted on
Spain keeping hers at the other side of
the Atlantic.
In diagonal opposition to this capa
ble â writer I am inclined to think our
superiority on the sea is much greater
than we are accustomed to say it is.
Truly it could be wished that the crews
of all our ships were two-thirds Ameri
cans, but the fact that they are splen
didly officered makes up in great meas
ure that weak point. The discipline ob
taining in our navy Is excellent; it is
not equaled in any marine branch of
national service excepting, possibly,
those of Germany and Great Britain.
It has been my fortune to see much of
navies of many countries and I know
of none except the Turkish where dis
cipline is more lax than it is in the
ships of war of Spain. And Mr. Bierce
to the contrary notwithstanding, disci
pline wins more battles than collective
courage. It breeds confidence, and that
is the prime factor in the decision of all
struggles. Spain's particular weakness,
both in the army and the navy, is in
her officers.
Where that unfortunate country got
her 100,000 troops in Cuba, "fully one
half of whom are veterans," or where
Mr. Bierce got the notion that she had
them, I am unaware. The "veterans"
Spain has in Cuba are principally raw
recruits, badly drilled and not well of
ficered. (I am not making this state
ment idly; it would be confirmed by
anyone who has seen the Spanish army
In Cuba within a year.) Mr. Bierce
further says:
"If it please 'whatever gods may be' to
raise up against us on the sea a Spanish
Nelson, denying us one of the same sort,
there will be lamentation in the landâ
a lamentation that even the chin-thunder
of talking Bob Evans cannot drown."
So far as the possibility of the rising
of a great genius is concerned that sav
ors much of the "Lucky shot" of Mr.
Irving M. Scott, which |his gentleman
with whom- 1 controvert so mercilessly
satirized when war ..ith Great Britain
over affairs Venezuelan was in the air.
A writer in this paper once said, "It is
essential to face the situation as it is;
not as we dream it might be." That is
clearly true, and it is scarcely sensible
to estimate our chances of succeeding
in our war whilst counting possible
Nelsons and Napoleons. We are quite
as likely to develop them as is the en
emy; indeed, it is more reasonable to
suppose that we shall, for having had
somewhat extensive opportunities of
viewing men and things I m imbued
with the idea that the average Ameri
can brain is usually more capable than
the Spanishâ it is more fertile in ideas,
and therefore the probabilities of evolv
ing a genius are greater.
This trouble is not similar to those
which bred the cries of "On to Rich
mond:" and "A Berlin!" The territo
ries of the combatants in each of these
instances were contiguous. The foes in
the former instance were nearly on
equality, but Spain's only equality in
this dispute is in the number of ships
she possesses. Incidentally the cry of
"A Berlin!" might have had its echo in
reality but for the character of the
French officers, and in that one point
alone we have an advantage which the
Spanish will find cannot be easily over
come.
In conclusion this is quoted:
"If we must make war let us make it
â¢ â¢ * remembering that it is a three
handed game, Chance being the third
player. He is sometimes the strongest of
the three and gives his assistance to the
weakest."
The man who goes into a fight with a
heart so weak that he imagines he may
be "knocked out" by "Chance" is half
defeated before the first blow is struck.
I see no possible "Chance" in the out
come of this war. Of military opera
tions, in all human probability there
will be scarcely any, and our advantage
on the sea is so gTeat that we may with
well-placed confidence assume that the
naval warfare will be short, with vic
tory for us as its end. The immense
advantages of docks, coal and general
supplies easily available, as well as
ships and well trained men, are ours, and
they certainly outweigh any Nelson of
the imagination â even when so great
as that of Mr. Bierce.
As a patriotic citizen I hope we may
yet avert war, and so do all sensible
people. The horrors ,of even the small
est struggle between nations are far
more dreadful than can be imagined by
those who have not seen the actuality,
but if it must come I can see no reason
for believing but that we shall conquer
quickly and easily.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Three .torpedo-boat destroyers are com
pleting at Genoa for the Italian navy.
They are of 260 tons displacement and 200
fÂ»et in length, calculated to make S3
knots. They have been named the Ful
mlne, Peliicano and Condor.
The armored cruiser building at St.
Nazaire for the French navy Is to be com
pleted by June, 1901. The vessel is Dftfl
tons displacement, 433 feet 4 inches*lengTh
on water line and 59 feet 7 inches beaiu.
The total cost is estimated at $3,094,000, of
which hull and fittings amount to JI.jCI,
710 and the boilers $331,000.
Reports received at the British Admir
alty are rather unfavorable on the Belle
ville boilers in the Powerful. The BhiD
consumed S3OO tons of coal making the
passage from Plymouth, 49 days' actual
steaming. Her average speed was only
ll^i knots per hour, or 276 miles a day,
and she used 65 tons daily to make this
distance. In addition the auxiliary ma
chinery consumed 40 tons daily, bringing
the total up to 105 tons*. The consumption
reached the extraordinary figure of 2^
pounds per horse power per hour, abouv
doubls what it ought to be. An Atlantic
liner of like size would not use over 40
tons daily to steam at the rate of 11V>:
knots .ma the auxiliary machinery woulu
not require more than one-fourth of tna
coal used for like purposes in the Power
ful.
The keel of the Formidable. British bat
tle-ship of 15,000 tons, was laid March 21
at Portsmouth dockyard. Its dimensions
are 400 feet in length, 75 feet beam and
2S feet 9 inches me,an draught. She is to
have engines of 15,000 horse-power, caleu
'atec! to give a speed of 18 knots. Ther-3
will be expended $2,329,060 upon her con
struction during the present fiscal year,
and will probably be completed In lead
than two years.
A Japanese armored cruiser named
Asama was launched at Elswlck, March
2t! The ship is 408 feet in length, 67 teet
breadth and displaces 9750 tons on a mean
draught of 24 feet 3 inches. She has an
all -mound water-line belt of 7-lnch Har
vÂ«Â»yized steel and transverse steel armor
tulkheads 6 inches thick. The batteiy
consists of four 8-inch wire-wound rifles
in two barbettes, fourteen 6-inch quick
firers, twelve 12-pounders, seven 3-pound
ers and five submerged torpedo tubes. A
speed of 21% knots is confidently expected.
Of the forty-five million dollars assigned
by t_ho Czax for tha Increase of the navy
the greater part will be applied to the
building of armored ships, cruisers, tor
pedo-boat destroyers and a torpedo-b^at
flotilla. Nearly all the new vessels are
to be built in the yards of the Neva and
only a small part of the orders will he
given to the French. The visit of Cnailea
Cramp to St. Petersburg at the present
time is somewhat mysterious, and not a
word has been said by him expla nmg
why he should be in Russia. The larga
prospective shipbuilding orders may have
some connection with Cramps trip ana a
branch yard at St. Petersburg under the
Cramp syndicate management is not im
probable. Palmers in England run t
Spanish dockyard at Bilbao, and the
Armstrong Company at Elswick have a
shipyard and armor plant in the I?a> o
Naples and a shipbuilding plant In Japan.
The Russian armed fleet in Asiatic
waters consists at the present time or
two battle-ships. Sissoi Veliky and Na
varin, of SSBO and 9746 tons respectively,
also the following armored cruisers:
Rurik, 10,923 tons: Rossia, 12,130 tons; Ad
miral Xachimoff, 7783 tons; Vladimir
Mousmach, 5796 tons, and Dimitri Dons
kol. 5893 tons. The cruisers and gunboats
number thirteen, with an aggregate dis
placement of 18,312 tons, making a total
Sett of 20 ships of 79,462 tons.

THE air was full of the message of
the Easter bells. "Peace on earth,
good will toward men," welled from
every church tower and brought its
meaning home to those who heard. It
was a day of peace slipped into weeks of
talk of war, and on the verge of the crisis
people paused to listen to the choru3 of
iron tongues and brazen throats and to
rellect upon Its meaning.
It meant something to every oneâ a
great deal to many. It filled the churches
and lent its aid to the prayers of those
who thronged the sanctuaries; It wooed
the sunlight and chased away the clouds
and went with the people etfen as far as
the ocean, where the song of the bells
blended with the voice of the Bea.
It was a day of rejoicing and happiness
from the gray of the morning when nrst
the men of God proclaimed that Christ
had risen to the last note of the vesper
chime. There were special services in
most of the churches in the morning, and
again In the evening many were alight,
and thousands joined in the evening pray
ers.
It Feemotl as if the crowds had left the
churches only to seek the park, for it
looked as if the whole city was there. It
needed neither the smiling day nor the
bells, nor even a calendar to herald the
fact thai it was Easterâ lt needed only
the rainbow hues of the millinery to tell
of the Eastertide.
They came In all sizes and shapes and
colors-, and the pJain in front of the band

At the Cathedral.
The papal benediction given to the
people by the Most Reverend Archbishop
Riordan was the most striking part in
the service yesterday at St. Man s Ca
thedral. It followed the solemn pontifical
high mass and the people received it *-;tli
all the fervor of the Christians who make
pilgrimages to Rome for this great bless
ing. The mass was particularly solemn,
it being one suns: only on great feasts in
the church. Father Prendergast preached
the sermon at the mass, choosing for his
subj< et "The Resurrection."
The decorations were most beautiful.
Ferns, fan palms, date palms and yuccas
surrounded the steps leading to the tab
ernacle and Bermuda and Bast India lil
ies were in profusion in the sanctuary.
During the mass the altar was a blaze of
light. In the sanctuary stood the Easier
randlf, which was lighted while the choir
was intoning the "Gloria." Thia candle
a not merely a decoration; it is one of
:he customs of the church to light '.h'.s

after reading the services, emphasized
the appropriateness of the occasion in

from I (. orinthians, the fifteenth chanter

OLD LAVENDER
STILL FRAGRANT
Edward Ha-rrigan Appears
Once Again in a Famous
Part.
The Easter Opening of the Hyde
Comedians at the Orpheum a
Big Success.,
13d ward Harrlgan has grown much
older than when we saw him last, and
the play of "Old Lavender" has aged
even more than its author-actor, but
Harrigan is still an actor of remarkable
originality and personal spell, and last
night his characterization of Old Lav
was attended with sympathy and admira
tion by an audience that more than
comfortably filled the California Theater.
Even the oldest and staunchest admirer
of Harrigan and his art could not wit
ness a performance of "Old Lavender"
to-day and call it more than a series of
Dickinesque character studies threaded
on the slightest of melodramatic stories*
It is the best that Harrican has ever
written, and still a great wry short of
being a real play. But for all its unreal
ity of plot and reckless bursts of song
there are several characters in it which
are not soon forgot, and one. Old Lav
himself, which already has become al
most a classic among the few memorable
figures of the American stage. There i.Â«
something unerringly human in Harri
gan's Old Lavâ his very extravagances
seem natura.l and consistent, his humor
is good humor of the rarest sort, and his
pathos is quietly and gently tru<>. The
years have not relaxed Harrigan's grip
on the part with which his best efforts
have been identified, and while his pres
ent company and scenic outfit are not
first-rate, there is enough character in
the performance to make It curiously and
genuinely attractive.
â¢ --'"â â¢
The Easter matinee at the Orpheum
disclosed an entire new bill in Hyde's
Comedians, as clever a vaudeville band as
has been here since the palmy days of
the Boston Howard Atheneum show.
There are seven turns; none of a fastidi
ously high grade, but all plain, out and
out variety acts, clever, capable and just
the sort admired by the better class of
persons who patronize the Orpheumâ just
the sort that have been the exception
there rather than the rule during the last
six months. The one serious fault in yes
terday's performance was the exagger
ated length of several of the acts, the
seven being stretched out to cover the
time usually devoted to nine or ten.
Mclntyre and Heath, old-time minstrel
men, have a sketch of peculiar humor
and idiosyncratic charm which needs only
condensation to be a gem; John T. Thorn
employs a very comical personality in the
skit called "The Rustic Actor," but he
lingers longer than is tactful; and Charles
R. Sweet, who, perhaps, is the only man
on any stage who can interest an au
dience with tricks on the piano
forte at this time of day, overstays him
self in a lengthy monologue.
The other turns profit by their celerity
Williams and Walker do a spirited fifteen
minutes of song and step, contrasting in
their persons the linen duster nigger and
satin-faced coon, winding the act up with
a lively cake walk, in which participate
two prancing ladies of authentic choco
late tint and a sumptuous drum major

It more fully understood. He spoke with
sorrow of the present cloud of strife

bulence of the masses clamoring for war.

St. Luke's Episcopal Church.
St. Lukes Church began its Easter ser
vices with early celebrations of the Holy
Communions at 7, S and 9 a. m. The rector
was celebrant at 7 o'clock, when tfao
church was thronged with worshipers.
\ Mr. Shaw, assistant priest, cele-
L "â¢ d at 8 and 9 a.m., and the rector was
celebrant again at 11 o'clock. Great num
bers of communicants approached the
altar. It being estimated that 750 received
the Blessed Sacrament during: the day.
At 11 o'clock many scores of people had
I to turn away regretfully from the front
door, as the seats and aisles were filled
The rector, Rev. \V. H. Moreland,
, preached an Easter sermon from the text:
"Christ is risen from the dead, and is be
come the first fruits of them that slept."
He said: "We stand to-day before the
; vi*lon of a future life. We think of our
immortality. We prize every evidence
,of this great truth. We look with
: out and within us for some pledge that
we are not to perish in the grave. Nature
i tells us of a resurrection. A voice within
j each of us calls out loudly of our undy
1 ing nature nnd glorious destiny. I shall
; not be annihilated, is the language of cre
ation. Most convincing of all we see
| Jesus Christ risen from the grave, and
: clothed with immortality, thus on Easter
we stand surrounded by many and glori
| ous proofs of a future life."
Mr. Moreland urged as evidence of a
. future state the immensity of the uni
v^rsr he infinite variety of life, the im
pose â¢ ty of annihilating matter or force,
the i \ ience of design in creation, the
! large .mortality among infant lives, and
! the infinite capacity of progress, which is
! a- quality of the mind, and when to this
! the resurrection of Jesus Christ is added
i the reason and the senses are convinved
I of the certainty of man's immortality.
Good Samaritan' Mission.
All the services at the Cathedral Mis
sion of the Good Samaritan yesterday
wore crowded with congregations of de
vout and interested worshipers. At the 11
o'clock service the ceremony of the dedi
cation of the handsome window erected to
the memory of the first bishop of Califor
nia preceded the regular morning prayer.
At a signal the window was unveiled, and
the beautiful work of art, bright with
color and of superb design, was revealed
to the congregation in all Its beauty.
In his sermon fbe Rev. TV. I. Kip Jr.,
the minister In charge, referred to the
lutions of himself. Helena Mora, whose
manly barytone first introduced "That Is
Love" to an Orpheum audience many
years a^o. sings several of the descrip
tive BOnga that are typical of the spieler
voiced fraternity with large effect, and
does really remarkable melodramatic
work in a song written in glorification of
the present unpleasantness; concluding
with "The Star Spangled Banner" to an
accompaniment of Old Glory, patriotic
scenery and applause that breaks the
Sabbath for blocks around.

HAD EYES BUT DID NOT SEE.
William Coleman Stole Money While
in Charge of a Police Officer.
Policeman Frank MacGrayan of the
California-street station is the butt of a
gre ( at deal of good-natured fun at the
hands of his brother officers on account
of a clever piece of stealing done under
his very eyes by a man whom he held
under arrest.
The officer saw William Coleman, a
wood peddler addicted to the use of mor
phine, walking up Kearny street with a
flower-pot about the size of a barrel con
taining a botanical specimen the large
ness of which would justify calling it a
tree. MacGrayan was acquainted with
Coleman and scented something wrong.
He accosted the peddler and by means of
much cross-questioning found that the
plant had been stolen from a restaurant
on Clay street.
Taking his man with him the officer
went to the eating-house and found the
lady In charge, who was not aware of her
loss until his arrival. She was greatly ex
deceased prelate as one who had gone
before, bearing witness and as resting
from his labors.
At the evening service the music was
the principal feature. T. C. West read
the prayers and the Rev. Edward Mor
gan, assistant, preached.
In the evening gold medals were award
ed George Tre.ssly and George Neuscholz
for creditable work, and John Long, John
Verdenal and John Parry were honorably
mentioned as deserving of credit.
Central Methodist Church.
Standing room only was to be found on
the sidewalk at the Central Methodist
Church on Mission street last night. As
early as 7 o'clock every seat in the body
and galleries of the church was occupied,
and yet the stream of anxious worshipers
kept pouring up the steps in the vain
hope of getting accommodation.
Dr. C. E. Locke gave a vivid portrait
of the crucifixion and resurrection of
Christ.
In consequence of the exhausted condi
tion of Dr. Locke by his day's labors the
choir, at his suggestion, interspersed some
choice solos to his evening discourse.
At St. Dominic's Church.
Mozart's twelfth mass was sung at the
services at St. Dominic's Roman Catho
lic Church yesterday. The soloists were:
Soprano, Mrs. Majnie P. W. McGlade;
alto, Mrs. H. Clark; tenor, Roberti Stan
tinl. and bass. D. H. Cuttrell. Those who
composed the chorus were: Misses M.
Lambert, F. Young, A. Mannins, S. J.
Duffy, Mrs. Brown, Misses M. Madden,
M. Ballinger, Eve Bowlen, C. Mc-
Fadden, L. McFadden, C. Farrel, E.
Farrel, K. Edmonds, M. Edmonds,
S. Sicklair, J. Buckley, M. Buck
ley, M. McKeon, L. Huklman, John Gil
more, M. Toby, J. Schmidt and T. Gil
more. Miss Daisy Roche was the organ
ist and the orchestra was composed of the
following: Miss C. Tinnon, Frank Sulli
van, M. Chester, A. Kelly, M. Buckley,
M. Millwood, violins, and J. Carrigan,
violoncello.
A special evening service concluded
with Mlllard's "Tantum Ereo." The
tenor solo was sung by Roberti Stantini.
First Presbyterian Church.
At the First Presbyterian Church Rev.
Robert Mackenzie delivered a sermÂ»n,
taking for his text, "If a man- di^f shall
he live again? But now is Christ risen
and become the first fruit of them that
slept," Job xiv:l4, Cor. xv:2o. He said:
"The two greatest days in the history
of this world are the day of creation,
when God tirst said let there be light and
the morning stars sang together, and that
day when Christ rose from the dead and
filled the world with his increasing vol
ume of Easter songs.
"The resurrection of Christ settles the
question of anothex life. The grave is a
pertinent fact In every man's life. Shall
he live again? Life is sweet; we are not
willing to be done with it. The life of
others is doubly sweet; we are not will-
Ing to be done with them even at the
grave. The mother never sees the da^y
when she is willing to lose her children,
and after they are gone there are no
waters of Lethe where she may find for
getfulness.
"Would the question of immortality
ever nave become a certainty were it not
that over in the long array of graves this
one of Christ is open and empty? Life as
we know it is connected with the body,
nor can we forget the dust. But as the
almond tree blossoming in February tells
us of a power at woric that will bring all
the trees of the garden into bloom, so
the open grave of Christ tells us of a
power at work at whose voice all that are
in their graves shall come forth."

her flower and rushed to the back of the

MacGrayan's eyes followed her, and
j while his eagle optics were turned to
ward the lady Coleman cast his on four
' half-dollars which were lying on the
! counter, and allowed his hands to follow
them. The lady returned, failed to see

j her silver. A search of Coleman revealed
the cash, but as it will be held for evi

CLAIMS TO
HAVE BEEN
DRUGGED
Emma Freel, Aged 13
Years, Accuses T.
Costello.
Claims That the Latter
Enticed Her Away
From Home.
Taken to the Ingleside Coursing

Har Alleged Assailant Locked Up
In the Central Pulioo
Station.
Emma Freel. aged 13 years, who lives
with her parents at Twenty-ninth and
Mission streets, claims she was induced
t â¢ !,. r borne by a man named Tom
CostellO yesterday afternoon, who after
Caking her to [ngieside, drugged her. Last
evening they were found staggering along
Tenth street by Policeman Harry T. Day,
Who suspecting something wrong, took
them to polio* headquarters. Costello
was charged with being drunk, and the
girl subsequently restored to her parents.
Amid tears the eirl informed Captain
Bpiliane that Costello met her on the
street and asked her to accompany him
to the Inglesiue coursing track. She in
nocently accepted his invitation, and after
reaching the track he induced her to
drink a glass of lemonade, which she
claims was drugged.
"After 1 drank the stuff," she tearfully
remarked, "I felt bad and asked Tom to
take me home. He promised to do so.
and v\ -i -in incoming car. 1 im
mediately fell asleep, and did not awake
until the car reached Tenth street. We
then alighted and walked along the latter
Btreet to Howard. Juat then a policeman,
who had been following us, accosted us
and a>k.il me where I was going. 1
. j was on my way home, but evi
dently doubting my story, he placed us
under arrest.
"I know I did wrong to Â£O to the track
with a man," innocently remarked the
girl, "but ;*-s he was acquainted with my
mother 1 did not think he would harm
me. 1 will never go out with another man
unit my mother is with me."
A short time afterward the mother of
the girl appeared at police headquarters
to claim her offspring: As she entered
Captain Spillane's office she caught a
glimpse of her daughter, and clenching
her list approached her with the evident
purpose of severely chastising her. Cap
tain Spillane, divining her purpose, stopped
her and commanded her not to punish the
girl.
"This is awful." bemoaned the woman.
"My G.hl: what is to be done?"
A young man, who accompanied her,
announced that he was sorry that he had
not met Costello with the girl.
"He would now be occupying a slab in
the morgue," he remarked. "Shooting is
too good for such a creature."
Mrs. Freel then took her daughter's
hand and left police headquarters. She
intends to have Costello arrested to-day
on a more serious charge, providing she
can corroborate the story of her daugh
ter that she was drugged.

patterns of moldings for picture frames,

PEPPER COUPONS
A LIVING STATUE.
The Mysterious Case of Miss Wilber, WJ)o Was
Poisoned by Carbon Monoxide.
A MODERN GALATEA.
High up in a southwest room on the third story of the house, where every
warming, health-giving beam from the pun may enter, a beautiful woman lies.
She breathes, she sleeps, she takes nourishment, yet she lies in a trance, like
a lovely princess in an enchanted tower high up In her airy chamber, in the
world, yet not of it; a type of healthy girlish grace, yet motionless,speechless,un
conscious of the loving care that watches over her, of the tender skill of her
physician's touch, of the ideal conditions that surround her, facilitating her
wakening to youth and love and life.
It is just seven weeks since Miss Ellda Wilber spoke her last good-night to
her family. She went upstairs to her room and lay down for a moment on a
couch. The window was open, the gas half turned on, and Miss Wilber fell asleep.
The breeze extinguished the flame and the next morning her people found her
unconscious. Since that time the accomplished, lovable daughter of the house
is gone; spirited away by the deadly magic of monoxide poison, and in her place
there has been substituted a reclining Galatea, whom neither prayers nor tears
will vivify. The gentle heart has grown obdurate, the s ympathetic ear has
become deaf; the gentle hands do not feel; the beautiful eyes do not see.
It seemed to me when I saw this breathing, living statue yesterday that she
was just on the point of speaking. That is the way she impresses one. The
pretty color in her cheeks, the round, soft contour of her face, the delicate nose
and purely beautiful lips, and the great eyes, which seem to lack expressiveness
for just a moment, as a baby's do when sleep haa just left themâ the whole
face, so nun-like, so serene, with the fair hair rippling back from the white fore
head, one is confident, must be immediately irradiated with consciousness, with
intelligence. But nothing disturbs the placidity of the beautiful sleeper. When
the whole city and every living creature in it shuddered at the shock of the great
earthquake two weeks ago, one child of humanity refused to acknowledge
nature's dread power. Serene, calm, unmoved, unaware of danger or terror, this
girl alone of ail San Francisco's 300,000 people did not feel it. The mightiest con
vulsion of nature, as well as the tenderest tie of humanity, is nothing to her.
Every physician of note has been called to 2228 California street in consulta
tion. All the wise men of the West have been drawn into this case by the
mystery of It and the parental care which spares nothing to solve it. One after
the other the elect of the medical world has advanced a theory to fit this unique
case and retired baffled. Of the sixteen physicians who have studied the case,
not one is ready with the solution of the enigma, which, affecting the brain
alone, has left every other organ, every function of the body, unimpaired.
A flower blooming in self-consciousness. A Diana deprived of motion, of
speech, of all her senses. No, not all of them. This girl can still feel pain, and
make known her perception of suffering by a faint, short cry that ceases when
the suffering is past.
Dr. George W. Fuller, who has watched over this cÂ«.se with all the interest
of a physician and a friend, has not given up hope that Miss Wilber will be
restored to the world. There are signs of improvement discernible to the eyes
of those whose hourly study this strange case Is. There are gleams of con
sciousness, swiftly-passing expressions of eyes and of features that mean hope
to the watchers. Never a word has passed this girl's lips since that last good
night. At first she could take nourishment. But now. besides the peptonized
milk and beef tea administered through a tube twice a day, the patient has
learned to swallow broth from a spoon. Her temperature has fallen, and
through the long, slow days and the weary nights when this eirl who never
wakes, closes her eyes and sleeps, the nurses, the physician and the mother note
small symptoms of change, of improvement.
No one may say what effect the monoxide poison has had upon the brain
centers, while leaving the body free. There is no paralysis, nor is there hysteria,
despite the hypotheses of some of the physicians called in consultation. This is
simply an exception to all rules. The sufferer from monoxide poisoning either
dies or recovers within a few days. This particular suffererâ the day for whose
wedding to Mr. James Dunphy has passed without his fiancee's being aware of
it â does neither the one nor the other. She is half-living, half-sleeping. Whether
she dreams or not in this strange stupor, who can say? Her arms extended on
either side of her. she lies with her purely-modeled face turned upwards, the
eyes only turning now and then as if in grateful, speechless recognition of the
mother's presence or the physician's easing touch.
Below tHe head here is a model of sane, healthy organism, responsive to the
every guidance or hindrance the human machine is subject to. But In that
slumbering brain that has left the beautiful face uninformed but not in the least
vacant, the mechanism is all awry, clogged, benumbed by the poisonous gas this
girl, while sleeping, inhaled. MIKIAM MICHAELSON.
COMPASSES NOW
SHOULD BE TRUE
Magnetic Ranges Estab-
lished in the Har-
bor.
Shore Objects Defined for De
termining Needle Devi
ations.
About a year ago the suggestion was
made in the columns of The Call that
true magnetic ranges for determining the
deviation of the compasses of vessels be
established in the harbor of San Fran
cisco by the Government. The matter was
taken up by nautical men generally and a
few months later instructions were issued
to the Coast Geodetic Survey Depart
ment of the navy to undertake the work.
The result is shown in a pamphlet just
issued from the Government Printing
Office containing a chart of the harbor,
with illustrations of several of the most
prominent objects suitable for locating
ranges which can be seen by shipmasters
on entering or leaving port.
As a rule every vessel, whether of steel,
iron or wood, a sailing vessel or steamer,
bus her own individual compass errors.
They may be due to construction, the
material and method of construction in
ducing special magnetic effects, and
finally to the position given to the com
pass or compasses on ooard any vessel.
These Individual eccentricities are some
times complicated by careless stowing of
cargo or by bringing masses of iron in
too close proximity to the compass.
These peculiarities producing compass
deviations on board vessels must not be
confused with magnetic variation, which
is controlled by natural law.
The magnetic ranges for San Francisco
Buy and its entrance, now published by
tho Coast Geodetic Survey, are for the
purpose of giving the mariner and others
interested a ready means for determin
ing compass errors on board ships.
The ranges and compass bearings have
been carefully determined. It is only
necessary for the mariner or compass
adjuster to "swing ship," as It Is called,
over oue of the given ranges and compare
and carefully note the difference between
the reading of his vessel's compass and
the true bearing as given In the official
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1898.
publication. The recorded differences
permit the making of so-called "devia

correct her compass courses as to make

DEVOTIONS BY
THE MASONS
Templars Hold Solemn
Services in Honor
of Easter.
First Congregational Church
the Scene of the Cere
monies.
A Similar Ceremony Observed, in
Trinity Presbyterian Church
on Capp Street.
One of the most Impressive religious
demonstrations In comnv-.moration of
Easter was observed at the First Congre
gational Church last evening by^ the
Knights Templar of California Command
ery No. 1.
The Interior of the Mason-street edifice
was one blaze of light and the ceremony
for grandeur and solemnity was such as
is seldom seen outside the Masonic
Chapel. The order of services was well
defined and included, in addition to the
usual chanting of hymns and the recital
of prayer, several eloquent addresses by
prominent prelates.
At the first burst of melody from the
great organ the outer doors leading from j
the street to the interior of the church ;
were thrown wide on their hinges and the
"Knights," clad in the full insignia of
their order, filed into the church In solemn
and dignified procession, marching to j
their place of honor Immediately in front â 
of the chancel rail. At a word from the I
Eminent Commander a rustle of spangles
and the swish of cross belts were heard,
and the "Sir Knights" had assumed an i
attitude of attention and awaited partic- i
ipation in the ceremony in honor of the ;
ascension of the Redeemer. The services '
were opened by the pastor of the church, !
Rev. G. C. Adams.
From the commencement to the last
word uttered in the long devotional exer- j
clses they were most devout and inspiring.
One of the most striking features of the
â 01 Vice was the oral confession of the
Knights on bended knee before the min
later. The prayer beseeching forgiveness j
in substance was as follows:
Loving: and merciful Father; we humbly con
fess our sins before Thee; we have often trans- '
gressed; we have gone astray like lost sheep !
from a tender shepherd; we have done those
things that we should not have done; we have
left undone those things that we should have !
done, but Thou art a loving Father; Thou art i
all compassion; thy tender mercies are over â 
all. Forgive us, then, our sins, O Ix>rd, and :
may we live with Thee in giad submission to
thy will.
At the conclusion of the ceremony the '
word of command was given and the I
devout knights formed In martial array.
They marched out into Post street and j
tnence to the Masonic Temple, where they i
disbanded.
The sermon of the evening was dcliv- |
ered by the Rev. George C. Adams upon i
the text of "Christ the First Fruits of
Them That Are Asleep." Rev. W. E. '
Smith, prelate for the commandery, was
also in attendance and delivered a short
address.
The music was of exceptional merit, i
being rendered by the choir of the I
church, consisting of the following sing
ers: Soprano, Mrs. B. E. Paxton; con
tralto, Mrs. A. E. Story; tenor, Samuel
D. Mayer; basso, J. F. Fleming. The or
gan accompaniment was rendered by S. !
D. Mayer, who also assisted as director j
of the choir.
The principal officers of the command
ery present were: Commander John P.
Fraser, Generalissimo Charles H. Wilson !
and Captain-General Frank Titus. The
decorations in the church were elaborate
and magnificent. In -the, center of the
great organ was an enormous cross com-
Sosed entirely of white Bermuda lilies,
urrounding the reading desk and hiding
it from view was a mass of pink roses, I
entwined In delicate streamers of smilar.
To the left of the chancel rail was tne
American Stars and Stripes, while on the
extreme right were erected the colors of j
the Masonic order.
The services at Trinity Presbyterian i
Church last night were made doubly
memorable, by the attendance, in a body, i
of Golden Gate Commandery No. 16, !
Knights TÂ«Â»mplar. As the Sir Knights en- |
tered the edifice the organ burst into mcl- i
ody, playing a prelude, during which the
Sir Kniglits were seated In front of the : ,
chancel. The services of the evening |
opened with responsive exercises, fol
lowed by an invocation, during which all !
Sir Knights remained standing. It closed j
with all chanting the Lord's Prayer with '
bowed lu-ads. After responding* to the j
Easter pealm a Scripture lesson Wcis read
by Sir Knight Alexander N. Carson,
pastor nf the church, who also delivered
an Impressive sermon appropriate to the !
occasion. The music, which was rendered !
by a quartet, was especially good.

INGLESIDE.
Ono of the largest crowds of the season
saw some excellent sport at the Ingleside
Coursing lark yesterday, and the old
time favorites went down in rapid order.
Susie, Old Glory. Connemara. Log Boy
and Seminolo went under, much to the
disgust '>f the form players, who simply
poured Mioir money into the pool boxes.
It was thought by many that Log Boy
would defeat Susie in the third ties, out
the trick was left to Patria. who sold a
6 to .'! favorite. The hares were as fleot
as the hounds, and, in consequence, the
majority of the courses were long and
exritinK. Interest throughout the day
seemed to center on Susie and Old Glory,
but their defeat caused attention to be
turned to Mystic Maid and Patria, who
ran the final.
Much oxi-itpment was created over the
consolation stake and the final between
Koo Lawn ;;n<l Glen Roy was hard fought
from start to finish. Log Boy, who has
but recently graduated from the puppy
class. Is doing splendid work, and it is
ted lhat he will carry off some good
money in t!i<- near future.
A. Sellers and C. B. Wise, president and
vice-president of the Modesto Coursing
Park, witnessed the races during the af
ternoon as a guest of Harry Brennan,
the well-known sporting man. The visit
was made for the purpose of looking iwo
the methods of training, slipping and
Judging, and the visitors lert the park
well satistled with the days pleasure.

UNION PARK
The long shots had all the best of It at
Union Coursing Park yesterday, and
Bookmaker Walten was kept busy cash
ing place and straight bets upon the very
rankest outsiders. The day was a beau
tiful one for the hounds and hares, and
an unusually large crowd was In attend
ance. There were a number of "no-goes,"
and the hares were not fiuite up to the
standard, but these little drawbacks were
more than offset by several of hair-rais
ing courses. The betting in the ring was
fast and furious, and it can be safely
estimated that several thousand dollars
changed hands.
W. C. Glassons Terrona. who opened at
25 to 1, managed, by brilliant work, to
land the final stake, defeating George
Whitney's Theron. In the puppy stake
Bonita was an easy winner and a ra\or
ite, and in the final course with Pastime
she showed her supporters that there was
nothing to it. . .
The talent came home happy, for they
managed to get next on the long shots
without exciting suspicion. Ihe nest
work of the day was done by Eclipse,
who, but for the long and tiring courses
that she was forced to run to reach the
linal course, would have in all probabil
ity beaten Terrona.
The following is how the dogs ran:

TRIED TO HANG HERSELF.
An Insane Woman Attempts Suicide
in the Receiving Hospital.
A midihe aged woman giving her name
as Mollie Meyers created considerable
excitement in the vicinity of Turk and
Mason streets last night by loudly de
claring that a man had attempted to
murder her. Her hands were covered with
blood, and in a wild manner she begged
the passersby to save her. A policeman
was summoned, and realizing the woman
was insane, he had her removed to the
Receiving Hospital, where she was placed
in a padded cell. Shortly afterward Dr.
Fitzgibbon happened to pass the cell In
which slio was confined and discovered
tlie unfortunate woman in the act of
hanging herself with a portion of her
night dress. Summoning several attend
ants,- Dr. Fitzgihbon had them search her
to prevent her from injuring herself.
Discussed the New Charter.
A meeting was held yesterday afternoon
at the rooms of the Labor Union, 915V2
Market street, to discuss the ne^ charter.
Vice-chairman F. Crandall, of the B. T.
Council, presided, and James N. Rose
acted as secretary.
Delegates from many different unions
were present and listened to speeches
from John McCarthy, E. L. Maulsbury
and others relative to the matter under
consideration. As many of the labor or
ganizations, owing to It being Easter
Sunday, were not represented, it was de
cided to adjourn to Sunday next at 2
p. m., at which time a meeting will be
held at the same place at which repre
sentatives from every recognlied labor
organization In the city will be present.
Eilerman's New March.
There was a particularly good pro
gramme rendered by the Park Band yes
terday, and heading it was a march, "The
Golden Jubilee. " by Charles B. Eilerman,
a musician well known here and in Sac
ramento. The piece has a lively, catchy
melody, and its appearance on the spe
cial Easter programme is proof it de
served the applause it received.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 11, IB9S.
SHOOK HIS
FIST AT A
PASTOR
Violent Dissension in
the Central Chris
tian Church.
Rev. R. H. Sawyer Was
Threatened From the
Congregation.
Mr. Sawyer Had Denounced
the Organization as a
"Bubble."
WILL FORM A NEW BODY.
Most of the Congregation Promise
to Follow the. New
Leader.
OAKLAND, April 10. â The Central
Christian Church of this city will reor
ganize and adopt a new name as soon
as possible. An attempt Is to be made to
pay oft the Indebtedness, which amounts
to $500, before the step is taken, but this
decision was reached at a largely at
| tended meeting of the congregation this
[ morning.
Rev. R. H. Sawyer of Montana, who
! succeeded Rev. Edwards Davis, resigned
i and refused to preach to-night or any
other time for the present organization.
! The two hours' session of discussion was
â¢ closed when Gideon Davis, brother of the
late minister, walked up to the front of
the edifice and in the midst of a crowd
i shook his clenched fist in the pastor's
I face and said: "You have failed to prove
j your remarks, and you have no right to
i say sucn things if you cannot prove them.
'. If you keep this work up you will have
; to leave the town, for the people will
! never stand it. I knew you twenty min
| utes after you came into this city, and
I'll show you up."
The pastor had made the following
' statement concerning the church:
I have found this church in a deplorable con
dition. It is reported that I said it was "a
hiss and a by-word in this city." I have not,
but I do now say It here. Anything I say of
persons or church I stand ready to prove. It
is also reported that I am indignant regarding
my call here. I am not. I believe that it was
given in good faith. The officers were totally
Ignorant of the state of affairs or dishonest. I
look upon them as Christian men and women,
and believe that they must have been ignorant.
The church was nothing but a great bubble,
which has burst. leaving nothing but people,
not even an organization.
I want to be separated from this dis
reputable state of affairs, and if there are
sufficient people to gn out from this place and
organize a church, who want me to stay and
preach to them, I am willing to sacrifice self
and do it, but I will never preach again for
the Central Christian Church.
James B. McArthur declared that Mr.
Sawyer had insulted the church and every
member and proposed that he be given an
opportunity to prove his assertions, but
his resignation was accepted and a call
tendered to Mr. Sawyer to continue his
preaching to the congregation pending
reorganization, which was decided upon
by a majority of the members present.
To-night the congregation held a
lengthy session, when Deacon and Mrs.
Tate asked for their letters of dismissal.
The deacon presented his resignation to
Central Church. The letters were
granted, the resignation rejected.
Mrs. Van Pelt, Mrs. Gracey, the Misses
Scadden, McArthur and Dodson were ap
pointed a committee to raise funds to pay
the indebtedness, after which over forty
signed a pledge to support Mr. Sawyer
financially and otherwise in the new or
ganization. The.se and others who de
sire to join them will meet soon, organ
ize and incorporate a. new Christian
Church.
"That Central Church." said Mr. Davis,
in talking of the affair to-night, "is an
aggregation of a class of people every
man cannot handle. My brother held
them well in hand, but this man Sawyer
can't do it. He sees they have got away
with him, hence this kick. The cnurch is
sure to go to pieces now as far as I can
seÂ«."
SHOOTS THE WIFE
OF A NEIGHBOR.
Crime Committed by a Man Whose
Repulsive Attentions Were
Spurned.
PORTLAND, Ore., April 10.â Valentine
Bauer, an eccentric middle-aged German
living near Hillsboro, this morning
en. plied the contents of a double-bar~eled
shotgun into the shoulder of Mrs. Lizzie
Overroeder, a widow who lives nearby,
inflicting a wound which will probably
prove fatal. Bauer attempted to finish
his work with a butcher knife, but be
came frightened and rsÂ«n away when the
woman swooned. He then ran to Hills
boro and procured a physician, who rode
out to the scene of the shooting.
Mrs. Overroeder's husband was at
church whfn the shooting occurred, and
she was a.one in the house with two
children. Bauer entered the back door
and without a. word of warning fired on
her. No cause is assigned for the action,
and Bauer is at present endeavoring to
play the insanity dodge, talking wildly
whenever Questioned. Once he said he
was shooting her for revenge. He has
been endeavoring to secure the woman's
good will for some time, and she has
constantly repelled him. The woman is
at present unconscious, and her recovery
is despaired of. The shot in the .charge
nearly all took effect.

COMPLAINT OF OWNERS
OF MERCHANT SHIPS.
None of the Subventioned Vessels
Have Yet Been Taken By the
Navy Department.
NEW TOI \ April 10.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Although thousands of dollars have
been paid by the Government as subsi
dies for merchant vessels capable of
being converted into armed cruisers,
not one of these ships has yet been
taken by the department for naval
service. As a result, considerable dis
satisfaction has been expressed by the
management of steamships whose ships
are subventioned for =orvice as armed
cruisers and there is some talk on the
subject among members of Congress.
There has been soi-.e division of opin
ion at the Navy Department, where
Chief Naval Constructor Hichborne
has advocated the purchase of subsi
dized vessels before other merchant
ships.
So far as the department itself is con
cerned, it has taken for Government
service vessels which, in its judgment,
seemed best qualified to meet the
navy's needs. Assistant Secretary
Roosevelt, who has had charge of all
negotiations relating to the purchase
of merchant ships, instructed the Rod
gers board to take only such vesssels
as were best adapted for conversion
into armed cruisers, and it has been
upon the board's recommendation that
Mr. Roosevelt has closed negotiations
for the purchase of vessels.
Up to this time but four large ships
have been bought. This number may
be increased this week, and it is prob
able that several of the subsidized
ships will be obtained. Unless war
breaks out the department will not, as
the Herald stated, buy the St. Louis,
St. Paul and Paris.
MARIETTA'S CREW NCT
PERMITTED TO LAiJD.
Kopt Aboard at Valparaiso to Pre
vent Clashes With the
Spaniards.
Copyrighted, 159". by James Gordon Bennett.
VALPARAISO, April 10.â During the
stay of the United States gunboat Ma
rietta at this port none of her crew
were allowed â¦" come ashore because
of fear that they might have trouble
with the Spaniards here. It is now
stated that the battle-ship Oregon will
not come for the same reason.
To me it seems such fears are with
out foundation. The Spanish colony
here is moderate in its utterances on
the present relations of the United
States and Spain, and the likelihood of
trouble would have been romote, unless
provoked hv sailors.
The Marietta sailed for Candy Point,
Straits of Magellan, last night at 8
o'clock.
Stabbed and May Die.
P. W. Hewitt, living at 322 Seventh
street, was stabbed and probably fatal
ly wounded last night by O. P. Leavitt,
a machinist, residing at 907 Bryant street.
The quarrel was over a girl. Dr. O'Brien,
who lives near the scene of the cutting,
hurried to Hewitt's bedside ?nd made
every effort to save him.

NATIVE SONS'
CELEBRATION
No More Log-Rolling in the
Convention Wanted by
Delegates.
IT the Railroad Company Does Not
Give Fair Rates There Will
Be No Turnout.
A preliminary meeting of the delegates
to the 9th of September celebration of the
Native Sons of the Golden West was held
Saturday night in Balboa Hall, Native
Sons building, and was called to order by
D. C. Martin of Stanford Parlor, and
was subsequently chosen temporary
chairman.
D. A. Ryan of Pacific Parlor placed In
nomination W. E. McCreery of National
Parlor for permanent chairman, and W.
H. Hazell, also of Pacific Parlor, nomi
nated Charles E. Mooser of Presidio Par
lor, after which there was an animated
discussion as to whether there should be
an open or a secret ballot. Ryan was in
favor of a secret ballot, Hazell in favor
of an open ballot, so that every one nrfight
know how every member stood. Percy
V. Long of Columbia Parlor said that
there had been so much manipulating in
celebration committees that the affairs
had resolved themselves Into log rolling
conventions, and that men had come into
convention pledged to vote for each can
didate and he wanted every man to de
clare himself openly. W.J. Wynn of Yerba
Buena Parlor favored a secret ballot and
opposed innovations. Finally the open bal
lot prevailed and Mooser was elected by
a vote of 26 to 24. McCreery had 34 votes
pledgÂ«'d to him, but some of the delegates
Sid not come in time to vote.
Eugene W. Levy of Bay City Parlor
was elected vice-chairman without oppo-

9th of Septemb.r Celebration.
sition, as was Robert W. Martland of Se
quoia Parlor for the office of secretary, a
position he has filled on previous occa
sions with great satisfaction. C. D. Stei
ger of Stanford Parlor was unanimously
elected treasurer.
The chairman was authorized to appoint
a transportation committee, that shall
ascertain what rates can be obtained
from the Southern Pacific in case the cel
ebration bo held at San Jose, and it was
suggested by W. E. McCreery that the
committee report at the next meeting, so
that the delegates to the Grand Parlor
may vote intelligently.
John F. Finn presented a letter from
the railroad company which declared the
rate to San Jose would be $1 25 for the
round trip and $1 50 to Napa. The letter
asserted that "it was conceded by the
members of the State order that in L>93,
when the celebration was in San Jose, the
Native Sons had never had such excellent
train service."
The reading at this point was inter
rupted by loud laughter and cries from all
parts of the hall of "What? What's that?
Call standing up all the way down or
sitting on the platform steps good
service?"
Then followed a. discussion on the sub
ject of transportation, which took a wide
range, many members taking part, and
it was asserted that as the company is
carrying excursionists to San Jose for
65 cents, 75 cents and $1 for the round trip
it certainly should offer like rates to the
Native Sons. Finally, on a motion by S.
J. Thiesen of Mission Parlor, amended bi
ll*. F. Byington of Niantic Parlor, who
declared that if the company will not
make hotter rates that it be the sense of
the convention that there be no celebra
tion this year, it was decided that the
transportation committee apply for a
rate not to exceed $1.
The committee will be named to-day.
The other sub-committees will be named
later.
It was decided to invite the par'ora of
Oakland and Alameda to take part in the
convention, but a motion to include the
parlors of Marin County was defeated.

OLD FORT HALLECK
â¢ IN WARLIKE GARB.
Three Cannon Mounted by the Grand
Army Veterans of
Monterey.
MONTEREY, April 10.â Old Fort Hal
leck, on the summit of the hill overlook
i ing the Bay of Monterey, which com
prises the United States Government
i reservation here, is assuming a warlike
! aspect. The one small cannon which has
; stood so long as the only remaining relic
; of the fort now has three pieces of ord
; nance to keep it company. Three cannon
; that were assigned to the local Grand
! Army post by the War Department some
; months ago have arrived and were placed
j in position yesterday on top of the old
: earthworks of Fort Halleck. The can-
I non arrived from Benicia several weeks
i ago, but the Monterey post being unable
1 to settle the large freight bill they were
allowed to lie at the Southern Pacific
I depot until the money could be raised
:by subscription. The railroad company,
; hearing of this, immediately canceled the
! freight charges and presented the can
non to the veterans to be disposed of as
i they deemed most suitable. The pieces
i were therefore removed to the Govern-
I ment reservation at once and the balls
i and powder stored.
The pieces are obsolete and can be used
; only for firing salutes where blank
j charges are to be employed.

WEALTHY BUT
IN BAD LUCK
Margaret Warren, Laden With
$20,000 and Jewels,
Arrested.
She Surprised the Police Officials
When Invited to Produce
Bail.
Margaret Warren, a woman who ar
rived in this city a few days ago from
New York, was arrested last night and
charged with disturbing the peace. When
brought to the City Prison, Desk Sergeant
Bidwell informed her that her bail would
amount to $10. The woman astounded
him by bringing forth a $10,000 check, some'
magnificent diamonds and JlO.ikju in cur
rency. Being brought before CaptaiQ
Spillane, she told the following story:
"I arrived in this city on Friday and a
hackman took me to a hotel on Fifth
street. As the room was unsatisfactory
and as I had a large amount of wealth
on my person, I applied for a better room.
This was given me and, after staying for
a day or two. I called for my bill. I
thought there was some mistake and told
the proprietor so. In my excitement I
went to my room and opened my window I
and yelled for assistance, when an officer j
came and was told by the proprietor to |
arrest me, which he did."
After the lady had deposited her bail,
she was directed to a place where she
could deposit her valuables.

Infantry Companies Are Fully
Equipped and Ready for
Field Service.
Changes or Officers and Men During

A scene of quietude prevailed at the
Presidio yesterday following the activity
of the previous forty-eight hours, during
which time the companies of the First
Infantry stationed at the post were fully
equipped for field service, and put in
readiness to move immediately on the re
ceipt of orders. The inspection of the
First [nfantry in heavy marching order
on Saturday morning showed conclusively
that Colonel Miles and his able regimental
Btaff and company officers were ready 10
cope with any emergency. The privates
and non-commissioned officers were in
perfect alignment, ready to obey prompt
ly the commands of their superior offi
cers. If war comes and the First is or
dered to the front not an officer or en
listed man will perform an act that might
reflect discredit to its present reputation
for gallantry and efficient services ac-

First Lieutenant Edwin B. Babbitt, ord
nance department, Benlcia arsenal, has
been conducting experiments during the
past week at Fort Point with the powder
for the big guns. It [a Btated on good au
thority that there is not only an ample
supply of powder and shot on hand at the
various points ol seacoast defenses along
the Pacific Coast, but that in case neces
sity demands it the California Dowder
companies will ship powder to Eastern
points.

ROW IN PRISON.
Several Female Inmates Engage in
a Short but Lively Battle.
Several disreputable women confined in
the City Prison engaged in a row last
night, and for a short time hair and
portions of feminine attire were flying in
all directions. The trouble was due to
a remark made by Kate Gallagher, who
has been arrested on numerous occasions
for being drunk. She was arrested last
night while Intoxicated, and after being
placed in the women's cell, she proceeded
I to hurl epithets at another unfortunate
named Rose Cronin. The latter ordered
; her to desist, whereupon the Gallagher
woman seized her by the hair and threw
her on the floor. The other women at
this juncture took a hand in the melee
and proceeded to annihilate the combat
â  ants. Their curses reached the ears of
Turnkey Hickey. who entered the cell,
< and after a desperate struggle, succeeded
in separating them. The Gallagher woman
! was at once placed in the "dark cell,"
where she will be detained until she is
sober.

NEAR TO DEATH'S DOOR.
CHARLES AULL, WARDEN OF FOLSOM PRISON
Charles Aull, warden of the State prison at Folsom, is at the point of death
at the Grand Hotel. He arrived from Folsom on Saturday, and since his arrival
a phy^cian has constantly been at his bedside. Hopes, however, are held out
for his recovery. Warden Aull has been ill for several weeks. About two months
ago he was taken sick, and his physicians advised a trip to the springs. He
remained there about three weeks and improved to some extent, and it was
thought that he was on the road to recovery. He returned to his duties, but
he was so enfeebled that his work had to be left almost entirely to his depu
ties. For a time he gained in strength, but his Illness a disease of the kidneys
was such that complete recovery was doubtful. A few days ago he began to
grow worse, and he was brought to this city where he would be nearer his
physicians.
Charles Aull has been warden of the prison at Folsom for nearly twelve
years, nnd he is looked upon by experts is the foremost of America's criminolo
gies. From the moment he took his offl 9 he instituted a system of discipline at
the prison that is unequaled at any p dal institution of Its magnitude in the
Union. Folsom prison is the dread of vil-doers in the State, and yet prisoners
are treated with the utmo|t kindness. Some of the most desperate criminals of
the Western States have been given in > his charge, but by his strong though
just rule they realized that he was thel master, and seldom were the rules of
the prison violated by them. Folsom p son, as conducted by Warden Aull, is
looked upon as a model institution of it kind, and Warden Aull is considered
by the Prison Commissioners as the mist competent man that has ever held
such a position In the State.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1898.
DOLPHINS HAVE
RARE SPORT
Pape Defeats Patch for
the Club's Diamond
Medal.
Al Shields and Charles Farrell
Win Their Heats for the
Treadwell Medal.
Aquatic Sports, Music and Dancing
Enjoyed at the Cozy
Boathouee.
A beautiful day and an excellent pro
gramme of aquatic sports and music
drew a large number of people to the
Dolphin Swimming and Boating Club's
cozy boathouse yesterday. Great in
terest was manifested in the different
events and the winners and losers re
ceived alik"! applause.
Alex Pape is now the possessor of the
beautiful diamond medal offered by the
club, having won it a third time yes
terday by defeating W. O. Patch in the
senior skiff race. The race was wit
nessed by a large crowd and as the
tow-headed oarsman spurted over the
finishing line he was greeted with
hearty evidences of appreciation. Patch,
rowing a pretty but less powerful
stroke, crossed the line about thirty
lengths to the bad, but his plucky work
earned him a generous reception. At
the start of the event of the day
Patch had the outside course, while
Pape gained a slight advantage by
hugging the shore. The latter spurt
ed as sorm as the word was given,
and kept increasing his lead by power
ful and quick strokes. When the stake
boat was reached Pape had a few
lengths to the good, while Patch seemed
to be handicapped off by a cramp in his
arm. Notwithstanding this, however,
the latter pluckily continued the race,
and crossed a few seconds after the
winner. Time, 12:16.
Pape showed by his work yesterday
that he will be a dangerous opponent
in the coming championship regattas.
He possesses strength, youth and en
durance, and with a little more coach-
Ing will be able to give Dennis. Me-
Crossland or any of the cracks a r.ose
struggle for honors.
In the first beat for the Treadwell
medal AI Shields defeated Joe Farrell in
14 -3S Farrell made a costly error on
nearing the finish by hugging the shore.
He and ShieMs were even up to within
ten yards of the finish, when hr- tried to
take" Shields" water, but without success,
the latter crossing two lengths ahead.
The second heat brought out Charles
Farrell and Tom Hopkins. The latter h.nl
the lead on the return from the stake
boat, but swamped off Powell-street
wharf. Farrell rowed in and was de
clared winner. The final heat will be
rowed In two weeks.
Victor Cagalarie, a promising swimmer,
gave Pape a race in Indian kiacks for a
quarter of a mile. Cagalarie, when near
the finish, capsized.
Joe Earls captured the 100-yard swim
ming race in clever fashion, with Jack
Cooney second and Peter yon Hadlen
a close third.
Visiting crews from rowing clubs about
the bay were in attendance and helped to
add color to the occasion. An excellent
musical programme was rendered at the
conclusion of the races and refreshments
were serv i& to the guests of the club.
HOUSING WORKMEN.
Interesting Sermon by Rabbi Nieto
at the Second Unitarian Church.
Rabbi Nieto spoke at the Second Uni
tarian Church. His topic was "Housing
of the working classes."
The rabbi gave a graphic description
of the quarters inhabited by the poorer
classes and pictured the misery of their
surroundings. He showed the baneful
effect of these congested districts upon
the health of the city and went on to
show how disease germs were bred and
nurtured in the miasmatic atmosphere of
the quarter. All the conditions favorable
to the growth of bacteria prevailed, he
said, and the sun's rays, the only force
inimical to their disseminating were never
able to penetrate the abodes of the
toilers.
Poor men paid a larger rental than was
adequate for the premises they occupied,
because by reason of the nearness to
their places of business a demand had
been created for these hovels. This left
the workingman with less money to ex- |
pend for necessaries of life than was re- j
quired for his family, and compelled him !
to pay large prices for small quantities \
of inferior quality.
Crime, he said, was engendered in
such environment, while the temptation
to steal could hardly be resisted, and al- \
cohol in unhealthy quantities was taken
to lighten the misery-laden heart.
The rabbi suggested as remedies: 1â
That capitalists who complain of having i
no outlet for their wealth imitate the phi- j
lanthropists of Europe, who built arti- j
sans model dwellings and received 10 per i
cent per annum for their philanthropy.
2â That San Francisco follow the lead of :
some of the Eastern cities by offering the !
people small holdings of city lands at rea- j
sonable prices and on easy payments. !
3â That the workman be educated to un- ;
derstand that the disadvantages to him
in living wnere he does, paying too much
rent and purchasing necessaries of in- |
ferior quality at extortionate prices, are
Car greater than he would endure were
he to live farther out. Added to this the
benefit of a walk to and from work and
the absnece of sickness in the family
consequent on the inhaling of miasma
were points in favor of his leaving the
Infested district for one more healthy.

718 MARKET ST., S. F-
ern city, has withdrawn from our con
fines. For three days, at least, he has
not been seen in San Francisco. In the
early part of last week brother attaches
of the various consulates of this city
were surprised by the receipt of "pour
prendre conge" cards, sent out by the
man who represents a country not now
on bowing terms with us.
Ordinarily the ethics of the consular
system imposes the distribution of
these P. P. C. favors only wher: a con
sul retires, is recalled, or departs the
country <>n a protracted or uncertain
journey. This is what has caused in the
minds "of the consular fraternity many
misgivings and stupendous conjectures.
ln.es the Spanish consul know the
proper forms thoroughly, or has he
been called to Washington by the voice
of the Spanish minister domiciled
there? The latter is the solution of the
problem suggested by many.
Opinion is strong in consular circles
that Felipe de C;istro has left San
Francisco for Washington. Why he
has deserted his post here In San Fran
cisco the gentlemen who keep a lookout
for the welfare of their countrymen
in this city are not in v position to say.
They recognize the air of mystery that
envelops the departure of Senor Fe
lipe, but are unable to account for it
with any definite or certain explana
tions. He has Just left us. For how
long or on what business they are not
prepared to answer.
The Consul has gone from us and he
has gone alone. His family are nest
ling peacefully In the bosom of their
staid and unperturbed home. With
beautiful assertive Ignorance of the lo
cality of the master of the family, chil
dren and wife are sequestered in belli
cose Pan Francisco. They have im
bibed so freely of the blessings of peace
that the fact of the patriarch's depart
ure or the possibility of an immediate
return troubles them but little. They
are all smiles, affirmations and nega
tions In a single bundle.
When will the Consul return and why
has ho left us"
SEVERELY INJURED A BOY.
An Unknown Bicyclist Vents His
Anger on Little Frank
Thompson.
L,ast evening 1 about S o'clock a boy
named Frank Thompson, who resides
with his parents at 645 Bryant street, was
badly beaten about the head and face by
an unknown man. While a crowd of boys
were at play on Folsom and Fourth
streets the man rode up on a wheel and
became almost insane at a remark passed
by one of the boys. Jumping from the
wheel he placed a heavy horse shoe ring
on his finger, and catching young Thomp
son by the shoulders inflicted severe lacer
ations of the lips and eyebrows, which
were dressed by Dr. Dillon. The matter
will be called to the attention of the
police.
Printers Praise The Call.
One of the largest meetings held by the
Typographical Union since the commence
ment of the recent strike was held yes
terday afternoon in the meeting hall of
the organization. There w<-re over two
hundred printers present, ahd all were
firm In their confirmation of the decision
which has been made regulating the hours
and pay of employes of job printing es
tablishments. A unanimous vole of thanks
was east by the members, thanking The
Call for the unprejudiced and fair treat
ment with which it dealt with the argu
ments advanced by the printers against
the methods of their employers.
Taken Back to Texas.
Sheriff Holland of Carson County, Tex.,
left the City Prison yesterday morning
with Rev. (Jeorge E. Morrison, who is

THE SAN FEAyCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1898.
STARS AND STRIPES CHEERED
Temper of the People in Regard to the War Issue
Unmistakably Demonstrated at a Popular
Gathering.
THE temper of
Ran Francisco 3
â¢people on the
eve of an inter
national crisis was
never more dearly
displayed than dur
ing a ball game
played yesterday.
1 lie ban b'ranciscos
were playing the
/resnoa at Reerea
tion Park before a
large crowd of spec
tators. Interest in
the game was at its
strains ot' a band
were heurd and a
little procession of
musicians was seen
wending its way to
ward the high flag
staff set opposite
the grand stand.
"Yankee Doodle"
was rendered and
there was a pause
In the music, punc
tuated by the impa
tient crowd with
cries of "Go on,"
"Play ball," etc.
Suddenly the bright
new folds of the
"staxs and stripes"
ran up the lofty
staff and were flung
to the free breese,
while the band burst
into the triumphant
chords of the "Star-
Spangled Banner."
The effect was elec
trical. The game
was temporarily
unheeded as the
spectators, as one
man, rose to their
feet and cheered
and cheered again
the proud emblem of
lioeriy.
Three thousand
people cheered "Old
Glory" yesterday at
.Recreation Park
with a fervor that
would have been an
impressive object
lesson to the Span
ish Ministry could
they have witnessed
the scene and heard
the outburst.
It was during the
last half of the sec
ond inning of the
national game on
the California
League grounds, and
Fresno was in the
throes of wiping out
the lead of one run
held by San Fran
cisco, when the roll
of a drum rattled
through the grand
stand, followed by
the dear old strains
of "Yankee Doodle."
A moment later a
band, preceded by
President McPike
and Colonel T. P.
Robinson of the
league, marched
into the grounds.
Hayes was at bat
and Tawney was in
the act of delivering
the ball, but stopped
with his arm drawn
back and stood mo
tionless for a mo
ment, and then a
cheer burst forth
from players and
spectators.
The little proces
sion swung across
the big lot at a live
ly pace and halted
RELIANCE BOAD RACE.
! H. M. Platt Won First Place â Deacon
Won at Elmhurst.

I Leandro triangle yesterday morning. The
â  distance was ten miles and the race was
â  the first of the regular club try-outs for

but always popular with wheeling en
i thuslasts. Inasmuch as it permits of the
1 riders being seen when but two miles
i under way and again at the all-important
i finish.
Twenty-three riders faced Starter Wil
liam Pettis at the start. H. M. Platt,
with a lead of seven minutes, plugged

first place, twenty-five yards or more In
front of a speedy bunch of three-minute
men.

minutes and a half, captured first time
prize, riding the distance In 27:48.
Deacon and Wyman won second and
third time prizes, respectively.
A. Brogl, V. Ligda and F. Jurgewitz

The two mile handicap race at the Elm
at the foot of a towering flagstaff that
had been erected ever the left field fence.
There was a huah of expectancy while
President McPike straightened out the
halyards, which was broken by the na
tional anthem, while a colorless bundle
shot up to the peak. Half way up the
breeze caught its folds, shaking them- out,
and the shapeless mass was transformed
into the glorious stars and stripes.
Instinctively each ball-player grabbed
his cap and stood with bowed head,
while pandemonium broke loose in the
grand stand and on the bleachers. Men,
women and children sprang to their feet
as though electrified, hats and handker
rhiefs were waved frantically, while the
cheers were almost deafening. The band
changed to the "Star-spangled Banner,"
when the flag floated at the peak, while
the crowd continued to cheer.
The incident lasted hardly five minutes,
but it was enough to give ample evi
dence of the spirit of patriotism that ani
mates every person who lives beneath
the folds of the Hag.
Both teams started the game with a
vigor that promised an exhilarating con
test, and the flag-raising episode only
Increased their pace. The game was
played in an hour and twenty-five
minutes, and while there were some
holes in it, the excitement continued until
the last man was out. â 
Fresno's Eastern battery arrived just
in time to come up with the team, and
although Towney was in the box his lack
of condition was very evident. He proved,
however, that he has great speed and
good control of the ball, and had it not
been for the sixth inning, where the
locals bunched on him, he would have
gone home with a big credit mark.
Snyder, his receiver, did not feel equal
to going behind the bat, so he played
second, while Henry, a diminutive chap
with a wonderful throwing arm, was
made receiver-general. The others were
lively on their feet and swatted the ball
hard, but were unfortunate in placing it
out of reach of their opponents.
The local men were aided and abetted
by chance to a considerable extent, and
gave proof that they have something to
learn yet about team work, but Manager
Bunker is going to give them large doses
of practice from now on, and will soon
have them in shape.
Hughy Smith, he of the famous old
Pioneers, made his debut as an umpire,
having just been appointed to the staff,
and gave general satisfaction. He was
called upon to render several difficult
decisions, which he did with excellent
judgment and Impartiality. He is giving
every promise of ranking with McDonald
and Sheridan when he becomes thor
oughly familiar with his position.
Fresno was first up and started right
to work. Brittan fanned, but Ferguson
made the circuit on a missed third strike,
the ball rolling through a knothole in thÂ«
backstop. Snyder was given his base
and Held (nut Anna) laced out a single
to left. Snyder tried to reach third, but
was headed off and retired in trying to
get back to second. Courtney drove out
a double, sending Held home, bui Mc-
Laughlin struck out.
Frisco scored one in the second. With
one out and Lee on first, Stroecker plant
ed a single in left and Lee was caught at
third. Stroecker stole second and scored
on a high throw to nail him at third.
The score was evened up in the third,
when Murphy reached first on a fumble
by Snyder. Krug bunted the ball to
third and was retired at first. Murphy
was headed for third by that time, and
Held threw high to cut him off, allowing
him to score.
The Tigers took the lead again in the
fourth, Held being hit by a pitched hall,
foing to third on Courtney's second
ouble and making a daring steal home
on a short passed ball.
Then came the disastrous sixth, when
Frisco won out. K. Krug started the
trouble with a single to left. Hearty hit
to McLaughlin, and went to second on
the latter's low throw to first, both run
ners scoring on Kelly's long single to
center. Lee's questionable double to
center, which looked to some as though
Donahue misjudged the ball, sent Kelly
home, and Lee followed him a moment
later on Stroecker's two-cushion shot.
Tawney steadied down then and further
disaster was averted.
The Tigers took another turn in the
hurst Velodrome yesterday was run in

The entries were as follows: First

CENTRAL PARK.
In Harvey Sacramento has a worthy
substitute for Hughes, who is now pitch
ing in an Eastern league. The auburn
haired left-handed twirler from the cit
rus belt gave an exhibition of his ability
yesterday that will long be remembered
by the crowd that attended Central Park.
His curves seemed a veritable Chinese
puzzle to the OaKlands. Time and again
a batter would step to the plate only to
return to his Beat crestfallen at the ludi
crous figure he cut while trying to con
nect with those wonderful shoots. Twelve
men were retired on strikes and but five
Athenians were able to connect safely.
Sacramento might have won, however,
with any other pitcher fn the box, as the
Oakland team played like so many school
boys. Nearly every man on the team was
guilty of yellow fielding, ten large and
rotuiid errors being the main cause of
their defeat.
How "Smiling" Mike Steffanl can pitch
for two nines without being released was
a matter that puzzled many yesterday.
Mike has, since the opening of the season,
cast his fortunes with the San Jose con
tingent, but in yesterday's game he
twirled for Oakland as if his life depended
on victory. Sad to relate his smile dis
appeared when the hard hitting crowd
that composes the Capital City team got
to work. Aided by three bases on ba..s,
twelve hits and ten errors they landed
nine runs. Home runs, three baggers, two
cushions and singles were tapped off at
will, but Steffani stayed it out, gaining
some consoiÂ«.^on by hitting Dennei an<^
Hughes.
Stanley is a prize for any nine and the
Sacramentos are fortunate in possessing
him. His work behind the bat is worth
watching. The support he gave Harvey
enabled the latter to toy with the Oak
landers.

The third week of the California League sea
son finds the San Francisco team In the lead
by one tame more to Its credit than Stockton
and Sacramento. Oakland has lost three bit
terly fought contests, and Is In the second
division with San Jose and Fresno, but It will
be at home now for a time while San Fran
cisco will do the visiting. San Jose has been
even worse oft, In having played all Its games
abroad and it will not open its home grounds
until May 1. It can then be counted on to take
its place among the leaders. The Tigers, too,
will soon have their delivery department In
working order and will give a good account of
themselves. The standing of the teams Is as

SLUGGING AT SACRAMENTO
The Giants Defeat the Horti
culturists in a Whirl
wind Game.
SACRAMENTO. April 10.â The Sacramento
and Pan Jose teams of the California State
League put up a great game of ball at Oak
Park to-day, the former team winning by a
score of 13 to 12. The game was replete with
brilliant plays, both individual and team, and
the batting was the heaviest ever seen on a
Sacramento diamond. The fielding of Van
Norden of the visitors and Mi-Hale and Reltz
for the home team were features, and a one

said work.
Sec. 19. In the case of improvement

shall not be required to present sealed
proposals, but may, upon making oath
that they are such owners, or the
agents of such owners, within ten days
after the first posting of notice of said
award, elect to take said work and en

tract therefor within said ten days, or
should they enter into such contract
and fail to commence the work within
the time stated therein, which time
shall not be less than ten nor more
than twenty days from the time of the
execution of such contract, the Board
shall enter into a contract with the
original bidder to whom the contract

shall justify and make an affidavit (for
which a form shall be printed upon
said bond), signed by him, that he is
assessed upon the last Assessment
Book of the City and County in his

amount greater than his liability^n all
bonds on which he is surety to tlwCity
and County, and that the taxes on
such property so assessed are not de
lirÂ»ouent.
The contract shall specify the time
within which the work shall be com

CHAPTER 11.
Improvement of Streets.
SECTION 1. All streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts in the City and Coun
ty, now open or dedicated or which

places or courts, for the purposes of
this Chapter; and tiÂ»o Supervisors are
hereby empowered to fix the width
and grade thereof, and to order to be
done therein and thereon any and all
street work and street improvement
under the proceedings hereinafter de
scribed.
Sec. 2. Application for the doing of
any such work or improvement must

by the affirmative vote of not less than
fourteen members of the Board of Su

for any work or improvement of which
the expense is to be paid by the City
and County, and the Board of Public
Works shall not approv : of such appli

and the Supervisors may then, after
having obtained from the Board of
Public Works an estimate of the ex

The Board of Public Works may also,
except as herein prohibited, recommend
any improvement, the expense of which
is to be paid by the City and County,
though no application may have been
made therefor, and must make, with
said recommendation to the Supervis
ors, an estimate of the expense, and in
such case the Supervisors may order
the same done.
No street work or street improve
ments of any kind shall be ordered to
be done by the Supervisors unless a
written recommendation to do the
same has been made to them by the
Board of Public Works, and all sucfi
recommendations shall be made mat
ters of record in the office of said
Board.
When the Board shall recommend any
work to be done on a street intersec
tion or crossing, where the streets do
not intersect each other at right angles,
it shall in each such case determine
what lots in the blocks adjacent to such
intersection or cro. ing will Le benefit
ed by said work, and shall cause a
map to be made on which shall be
delineated the lots so to be benefited.
Such map shall be transmitted to the
Supervisors with said recommenda
tion.
Sec. 3. Before recommending to the
Supervisors the ordering of any work
or improvement, the expense of which,
or any part thereof, is to be assessed
upon private property, the Board of
Public Works shall pass a resolution of
its intention to recommend the same,
specifying: the work to be recommend
ed, and shall fix a day when it shall
take final action upon said resolution.
Upon the passage thereof the Secre
tary of the Board shall forthwith, with

of unknown owners, such notice need
not be sent.
The Board shall also cause to be con
spicuously posted along the line of said
contemplated impro-vement, at points
not more than one hundred feet in dis
tance apart, notices, not less than
three in all. of the passage of said reso
lution. Each of said notices shall be
headed "Notice of Street Work" in let
ters of not less than two inches in
length, and shall in legible characters
state the fact of the nn?sage of said
resolution, its date. and. briefly, the
work or improvement proposed, and re
fer to the resolution of intention for
further particulars.
Sec, 4. The owners of a majority of
the frontage of the pro: rty fronting

of the district, as aforesaid, shall \
meanwhile petition for the same to be j
done, and the same shall, after the ex
piration of said six months, be contin
ued under the resolution of intention
first passed if said Board shall deem

ment, and, in the case of a district,
those owning at least two-thirds of the
superficial area of the district, shall ;
make written objections to the i
same within said six months, no fur
the^proceedings shall be taken under

signed by the owners of a maiority of
the frontage or of the district as afore- j
said, the Hoard shall, at Its next meet

assessment therein, who. after the first
publication of the aforesaid resolution (
of Intention, may feel aggrieved, or
who may have objections to any pro- I
ceedings in relation to the performance
of the work described in said resolu
tion, may file with the Secretary a pe
tition of remonstrance, wherein they â 
shall state in what respect they feel |
aggrieved, or the proceedings to which ;
they object. Such petition or remon- >
strar.ee shall be passed upon by the j
Board, and its derision thereon shall
be final and conclusive.
Sec. 5. When the contemplated work
or improvement hi the opinion of the
Board of Public Works is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the i
expense of such work or improvement !
be made chargeable upon a district, !
and said Board shall in its res- |
olution of intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
and to be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to i
be benefited by said work or improve- |
ment may be made by any interested i
party, in writing, within ten days af- i
ter the expiration of the time of pub- j
licatioii <>f the resolution of intention. !
The Secretary of the Board shall lay j
said objections before it and the Board i
shall, at Its next meeting, fix a time I
for hearing said objections not less |
than one week thereafter. The Secre- I
tary shall thereupon notify the persons I
making such objections by depositing j
a notice thereof In the Post Office at the '
City and County, postage prepaid, ad- j
dressed to e;u-h objector. At the time j
specified the Board shall hear the ob- j
Jections urged and pans upon the same, j
and if said objections are overruled, its !
decision shall be final and conclusive i
as to the extent and boundaries of the
district.
If the objections are sustained, th<Â»
Board shall proceed to set out another
district to the extent and boundaries j
of which objections may be made and i
a hearing had thereon as above pro- j
vided: ai.d <=v on in like manner until:
a district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob- !
jections shall be overruled by the Board j
â its decision in that behalf to be final I
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro- i
ceedings shall continue the same as if
no objections had been made. In its
report to the Supervisors the Board
shall aecompan\ its report with a dia- j
gram on which shall be delineated each |
separate lot, piece or parcel of land, \
the area in square feet of each of such j
lots, pieces or parcels of land, and the!

or with any one on his behalf, to ac
cept a price from him less than the
price named in said contract, or to

been done, said assessment shall in- |
elude an assessment against said per- I
sen. company or corporation, for its i
legal proportion of said expense, and

same and hear objections thereto. Upon
such hearing it shall determine whether
it will recommend that the street be
closed; and if it shall so determine, it
shall transmit such recommendation to
the Supervisors. Thereupon the Super
visors may pass an ordinance that the
street be closed; and the same shall not

without such approval, indorsement
and record. No street hereafter laid
out shall be approved or become a pub
lic street unless the same shall be at
least forty feet in width and two hun
dred feet distant from any parallel
street.
Sec. 29. The Board shall annually in
vite proposals for cleaning and sprink
ling such of the streets of the City and
County as the Board Bhall determine
should be cleaned and sprinkled at the
public expense. Before causing notice
for such proposals to be published the
Board shall divide the City and County
into such number of districts as in its
judgment will best induce competition
for bids, and secure the cleaning and
sprinkling of the streets at the lowest
cost. The Secretary of the Board shall,
under its direction, on the first Monday
in May of each year, cause to be pub
lished for a period of ten days a notice
inviting proposals for cleaning and
sprinkling each of said districts speci

of the streets and to the funds at its
disposal.
Sec. 30. The Board shall cause to be
made all urgent repairs upon the pub
lic streets that may from time to time
be requisite for the public safety, and
for that purpose may employ such la
borers as may be necessary, and at
such wages as may be from time to
time fixed by the Board; but when the

til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary
of the Board an amount of money
; which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
j the expense that may be incurred in
case the Supervisors shall not pass an
ordinance for said improvement.
Sec. 2. If within three months after
i the passage of the resolution determin
ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as tha
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
l inal construction or condemnation, of
I public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util-
I ities in order that the electors shall
! have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, aa
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. Tho
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such pror>osl-Â
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted- but in
case the votes cast In favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re~
.â c> ted.
<othing in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors fnun responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding tit once, without the submission |
of propositions to the electors as afore- |
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same asÂ»
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to acÂ« i
quire the same in the manner herein- !
after provided. I
Bee 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid '
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall:
be iawi'ul to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
n BUch verms.
In case, however, the cost of such
publir Utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
i'f, a:~ to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
n itting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
si thereon, and whether such bonded
Indebtedness shall be incurred. At
two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
oonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
3hall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
In section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
n< wspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting erf
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
i'.dji urned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
phnll be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public,
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
a< quisition of the same as set forth in

than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. S. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and : for which the indebted
ness ;? proposed to be incurred, the es
tltnated cost of the prr-posed public
utility, the necessity for th" acquisition
"f the same, and that bonds of the City

dfnance set forth iif the proposition be

THE NAVAL MILITIA.
During the past week there has been a
great deal <>f activity In the naval militia,
not only at this port but all along the
coast. The divisions are f>eing recruited
up to the maximum, which is 104 rank
and file. Under instructions from Lieu
tenant-Commander Nemey, acting cap
tain during the temporary absence oi Cap
tain Turner, in the matter of enlistment
the preference is given to men who hav<Â»
some knowledge of the sea. As it is, the
recruiting has been <jui:e active, and the
acting captain Is confident that in a very
short time a full complement of men can
be secured. He also f<-<-is confident that
th<- militia Will be called upon to go on
board of the Monterey and the Monad
r.o, k.
In the event of war an effort will be
made to secure some'of the fast tugs to
be used tor the- purpose of chasing and
capturing privateers which the Spam si]
Government proposes to turn loose upon
the high seas to prey on American mer
chantmen. If such as the Fearless and
the. Vigilant can be secured for that pur
pose It is the hope of the officers of tho
militia that some of their men will be se
lected for service on board.
The men at this port are being drilled
with a view to make them thoroughly
familiar with their duties on board ship,
so that in case of need they will not have
to go through a second course of instruc
tion.
The officers are perfecting themselves
in navigation, and the progress that they
have made in the past two months is very
.satisfactory to their Instructor.
It is computed thai there are enough
paupers in Great Britain to form, four
abreast, a procession over 100 miles in
length.

A SENATORIAL
TOGA AT STAKE.
CANDIDATES
SEEKING FOR
AN ADVANTAGE
Editor Otis as a Fac
tor in the Coming
Campaign.
Indorsed by Perkins in
Order to Promote Bul-
la's Interests.
A Letter From Washington
That Is the First Move in a
Very Pretty Contest.
HENRY GAGE THE VICTIM.
Southern Interior Press Scores the
Lot Angeles Editor ior Alleged
Acts of Treason.
From Los Angeles comes the an
nouncement that Senator Perkins has
written a letter to Colonel Otis of the
Los Angeles Times in which the writer
avers that his correspondent (Colonel
Otis) is the man the people of the State
of California want as successor to Sen
ator White.
This announcement throws a bright
light on the very interesting state of
affairs resulting from R. N. Bulla's re
i cent declaration of a desire to wear the
Senatorial toga. It is the first card in
a very pretty political game that will
be watched with interest by every poli
: tician in the State, because upon its
outcome depends the success or failure
of the aspirations of the men who are
i seeking the position of United States
Senator. Not the least interesting fea
ture of the play is the fact that Editor
Otis is to be made, unconsciously
enough so far as he is concerned, the
object of the shafts of political strat-
egy. â¢
It is a matter of common knowledge
that Senator Perkins is the stanch per
sonal and political friend of Bulla.
It was State Senator Bulla who nom
inated Perkins before the Legislature I
three years ago, and it was Bulla who
was largely instrumental in bringing
about the compromise with the south
ern members whose votes were neces
sary to Perkins' election. By this com
promise it was agreed that the Republi
cans south of the Tehachapi line should
be accorded the privilege of naming the j
next United States Senator. Editor -J
Otis was, somewhat reluctantly, made j
a party to this agreement. There has j
not been and is not now a desire on the
part of the party leaders to go back on j
the terms of this agreement made three
years ago. therefore the northern Re
publicans are content to remain in the
background and watch with some de
gree of complacency the struggle that
has begun on the other side of the line.
The time has now arrived when the :
man who is to be the next United States
Senator must come forward and an
nounce his intentions and make his bid
for the support of that section of the j
State that has been accorded the right I
of selecting the favored candidate. !
Colonel Otis, acting ir^ the capacity of
a molder of public opinion, as well as
steerer-in-chief for the Republican
party, has recently, through the col
umna of the Times, strongly intimated
that Henry Gage of Los Angeles is the
man whose name should be presented
to the next Legislature as the selection
of southern Republicans for Senatorial
honors. About the same time Bulla
paid a visit to San Francisco, and after
a consultation with his friends an
nounced himself as a candidate for the
honor of being elected Senator at the
next session of the Legislature.
It is generally understood and not
denied that Bulla's candidacy, so far as
this end of the State is concerned, has
been placed in the hands of John P.
Jackson and Billy Hamilton. Bulla's j
candidacy having been announced, it ,
became at once a matter of grave con- ;
cern how to deprive so formidable an
opponent as Gage of the advantage de
rived from the support of Colonel Otis
and the Times. The letter said to have ;
been written by Senator Perkins to
Colonel Otis may give some insight \
into the matter. Of course if Colonel
Otifl could be induced to himself be- i
come a candidate for Senatorial hon- I
ors he would withdraw his support of j
Gage. Without the support of the
Times Gage would no longer be for
midable. These things being accom
plished Bulla would find himself in the
field with no more dangerous an op
ponent than U. S. Grant, it being safe !
to assume that Gage and Otis could j
neither of them win the allegiance of j
more than a small minority of the j
southern delegation.
It is a very pretty game and one that j
will repay the closest attention on the j
part of the student of political diplo-
macy.
"There is not the least doubt," said
John P. Jackson yesterday, "that
the next United States Senator will be â 
a man from the southern half of the j
State. At the time Senator Perkins was â 
elected it was agreed acpong the party j
leaders that the south should be al- i
lowed to select the next man to be
voted on for Senator, provided the
northern Republicans were allowed to
nominate the candidate for Governor.
There has not been, so far as I know,
any effort made to bring about a revo
cation of this agreement.
"I am aware that Italia has an
nounced his desire to be the man se
lected to succeed Senator White, but
you must excuse me from making any
statement as to what part, if any, I
shall take in his candidacy. I am his
friend, but I am also the friend of other !
gentlemen who may aspire to the same ;
honorable position. Senator Perkins is
also Bulla's friend. I don't know
whether or not he has written a letter !
to folonel Otis, but if he has I have
sufficient confidence in the wisdom of '
tlie Senator to believe that he knows
what he is doing. He is a man who has :
â  never yet made a mistake."
The attitude assumed by the Los
; Anereles Times recording the present
â  political situation has "had the effect of
i bringing down unon the head of Col
onel Otis the censure of the editors of
interior papers, who accuse him of try
ing to bring about the election of Dem
ocratic successors to Senator "White
and Congressman Barlow. The follow-.
THE SAJN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1898.
Ing from the Pasadena News will serve
as an illustration of the castigation to
which he is being subjected:
Colonel Otis has for years been an open
antagonist of the Southern Pacific rail
road influence in politics. Yet in 1596 the
Southern Pacific railroad ring had in
Colonel Otis a stanch political ally.
With every man in the Southern Paci
fic Railroad employ openly fighting for
Charles A. Barlow's success at the polls:
with certain of its men taken down from
their engines and turned loose with money
In their pockets to spend for Barlow;
with Stephen M. White advocating Bar
low from every stump in the district;
with a combination made up of J. Marion
Brooks, Nathan Cole, Thomas V. Cator,
George W. liaker, J. Noonan Phillips and
Sutherland Hutton taking orders from
Huntington's hirelings and going up and
down the Sixth District shouting for Bar
low, the Los Angeles Times said not one
word editorially for the candidate of the
Republican party, whose vote might have
saved the credit of the administration.

Jacob Heinz and Edward J. Ford, two
young men, went into the store of F. K.
Weiss, florist, 9 Eddy street, yesterday
morning. They were under the influence
of lictuor and objected to the price of
the flowers they had asked for. They
made themselves so offensive that Weiss
requested his neighbor, E. Phillips, a
tailor, to go for the police.
Phillips started out on his mission and
Heinz and Ford followed him. At the
corner of Powell and Eddy Ford attacked
Phillips and a crowd gathered. Police
man Fennell came upon the scene and
placed Ford under arrest for battery
upon Phillips. Heinz interfered with the
officer and attempted to drag Ford away
from him. Fennell drew his club and
hit Heinz over the head with it. A citi
zen remonstrated with Fennell, and dur
ing the discussion Ford threw Fennell
down the steps of the Louvre and ran
along Powell street. Several citizens
started in pursuit, and he was captured
after running a couple of blocks. Fen
nell put the handcuffs on him and also
took Heinz in charge. At the City Prison
two charges of battery were booked
against Ford, the complaining witnesses
being Tailor Phillips and M. J. Gannan,
who went to Phillips' assistance. Heinz
was charged with battery and disturbing
the peace.
BURGLARS IN A SALOON.
Ed Gorman, of the Argonaut, Loses
His Money and Goods.
The Argonaut saloon on Mission and
Twelfth streets was entered by burg
lars early Sunday morning- and a lot of
articles were stolen. When the proprie
tor, Ed Gorman, entered the saloon yes
terday morning he thought everything of
value had disappeared. He at once noti
fied the police headquarters, and Detec
tives Fitzgerald and Graham of the Mis
sion district were detailed on the case.
Gorman locked up the saloon shortly
bo/ore midnight Saturday night, and a
few minutes later the policeman on the
beat saw the saloon lighted up, but he
thought Gorman was still there. If ne
had taken the trouble to make an inves
tigation he would have found the burg
lars at their work.
Gorman places his loss at between $40
and $45 cash, and several bottles of liquor
and boxes of cigars. Entrance w;ls ap
parently effected by- means of a skeleton
kt-y, and it is thought the burglars are
residents of the neighborhood.

tious fears of the crew.
QUEEN OF SONG AND MASTER OF MUSIC.
Two World-Famous Artists Who for Three Nights Will Make the California
Ring With Sweetest Melodu.
MELBA AND SIGNOR BIMBONI.
Oresto Blmboni, who will direct the per
formances of Mme. Melba. has had a
career this is rich in achievement, both
in composition and in the direction of
grand opera.
He was born at Florence, Italy, Septem
ber 11, 1547, of a family of musicians. His
father was a bandmaster, a trumpet vir
tuoso, and the Inventor of the "Bimboni
fonla." Every attention was given to the
education of Oresto. He studied the piano
under Dechamps, and harmony and coun
terpoint under Professor Mabelllnl, at the
Conservatory of Florence. When he was
18 he enlisted as a soldier under the ban
ner of Garibaldi. After his return from
the campaign he finished his studies at
Berlin under Taubert.
His career aa a conductor began at
Bastla, Corsica. He then went to Milan.
BOUND FOR KOTZEBUE.
The stern-wheel steamer to be used by the passengers on the barkentlne
Jane A. Falkenberg is to be taken to Kotzebue Sound In a novel manner. A
plank will be taken out of the bottom and the rigging of the foremast will be
unrove and passed through the hole and then made fast again. The hull of the
stern-wheeler will project about five feet over the barkentine's side, and the
rest of her will rest on the deck. The steamer's boilers will be placed at the
port side of the vessel, and both steamer and boilers will be securely lashed.
The boat is to be called "Kotzebue," and is 47 feet long, 15 feet broad and 4 feet
deep. She will carry fifty passengers and fifty tons of freight on an 18-lnch
draft at a speed of 9 knots an hour.

twenty days from Sand Point, Alaska,
with a cargo of 30,000 codfish for the
Lynde & Hough Company. Captain

Eagle Harbor, three seamen were
drowned by the capsizing of a small boat.
Their names were Peter Jensen, Olan

where he was engaged for the Victoria
Theater at Berlin, by the Impresario
Polllnl, who is now In Hamburg. He then
served In like capacity at the Imperial
opera of Moscow. Few are the European
cities In v.--hlch he has not shown hia
power. Thus, he was conductor at the
Vienna Imperial Opera House in 1883 and
ISS4; he has led in the opera houses of
Barcelona, Lisbon, Bucharest, Venice,
Naples, London, with companies of the
highest grade, with such singers at Pattl,
Gerster, Calve, etc.
In connection with the announcement of
the grand operatic performance In this
city by Melba, Signor Giuseppe Campa
nari will sustain the role of Figaro, the
mischief-making intermediary between
Roslna and her lover, the Duke Almaviva,
In the performance of the "Barber of.
Vigilant. The steamer was launched at
midnight Saturday, and is said to be the
first vessel ever launched at Fort Bragg.
Here she will be fitted out with boilers
and machinery, probably at the Fulton
Iron Works. Her length is about 150 feet.
The steamer Morgan City, the first
steamer purchased for the Klondike trade
by the Ladue Gold Mining and Develop
ment Company, arrived here yesterday,
sixty-four days from New York. A short
stay was made at Valparaiso and four
steerage passengers were brought up from
there. On the ltith lnst. the steamer will
make her first trip to Alaskan ports. The
vessel is 2SI feet long, 3S beam and has a
20-foot depth of hold. Several changes In
cident to what will be required of her on
her future run have been made in what
one of those who came out on her calls
"a most bungling manner." In fact, the
steamer conveys a general appearance of
awkwardness even to the eye of a novice.
Some careless driver left a mall wagon
standing in the alleyway between the
new ferry building and ihe postoffice
building yesterday morning, without
hitching the horso. The animal took
fright and started to run away, tearing
the woodwork at the corner of the post
office. If this had not delayed its progress
until strong hands could grasp the reins,
several people might have been seriously
injured or killed, as the pathway of the
horse lay right across the entrance to the
Oakland ferry.
Two boatloads of the Naval Battalion
from the training ship Marion, compris
ing about fifty men, held a drill in the
stream off Folsom-street wharf yester
day. Ensigns Harlowe and Morrison were
in charge.
Hit With a Bottle.
Frank Travis, a colored sailor, got into
a barroom altercation on Pacific street
yesterday afternoon with a man named
Silva. The result of the row was that
Silva struck Travis on the head with a
bottle inflicting a deep gash on the left
temple. Officer Cavanagh came upon the
scene and sent Travis to the Ferry Re
ceiving Hospital for treatment and locked
Silva up in the California street station
on the charge of an assault with a deadly
weapon.

NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN
An Important Change
That Will Affect Line
Officers.
The State's Guard Can Be Fully
Equipped at Very Short
Notice.
Regulations for Target Practice to Be ;
Revisedâ The Signal Corps
Celebration.
One of the most important orders Issued :
of late is the one establishing a new |
board of examiners for the Second Brig
ade. The old one was composed entirely j
of officers drawn from the retired list,
and with possibly the exception of one j
they did not have the same interest in ;
the affairs of the guard that have officers
who are constantly in touch with the rank
and file, and as a matter of course they j
could not view the guard in the same
light and understand its conditions as
well as those who are constantly with
it. That was the view taken when the
change was made, and it is in line with
the policy of the major-general, whose
desire it Is to place the guard on the best
footing, war or no war. The new board
will adopt more stringent rules in the ex
amination of officers sent before it. It is
probable that the examinations will not
be, as in the past, confined to the the- ;
oretical, but will be extended to the prac- j
tical. That is, it is likely a captain or a
lieutenant will be called on to proceed to
the regimental armory, where he will be !
given a strange company, and will be re- ,
quired to drill it in such movements as |
the board may direct, without giving pre- ,
vious notice of what movements he shall j
be called upon to have executed.
In view of the fact that next July new
tactics will probably go into effect, the i
new board will have considerable to do !
seeing that the officers are familiar with |
the new movements. Colonel Smith, i
First Infantry, president of the board, is
a very active member of the guard, and ;
he has able assistants in the persons of â 
Major J. F. Hayes of the Fifth Infantry j
and Captain George Fillmer of Company j
B, First Infantry. It is more than likely ,
there will be a marked improvement in '
the officers of the Second Brigade so far
as knowledge of duties is concerned, in
the future.
READY FOR ACTION.
When asked what was the condition of i
the Second Brigade of the National Guard |
at this time, .brigadier-General R. H. j
Warfleld, commanding that brigade, re- I
sponded "All present or accounted for and
ready to move on short notice."
It Is true that the guard is ready to ,
move on short notice. All the property)
of the First Infantry has been overhauled!
and arms that were not in condition put
in the best possible condition, and there is
not a rifle that Is not at this time in a
serviceable condition. .It is true that
many of them are not of the very best
for target practice, but all are in service
able condition, and the only things the |
guardsmen are short of are, as has been \
previously stated in this department,
tents, overcoats. and blankets.
As to these articles, there will be no
difficulty in supplying them should the i
entire , guard or the State be called into
active service, for there is under the con- '
trol of the Commissary branch of the de
partment of California, U. S. A., enough
to equip 10,000 men, and there are more of
the modern Springfield rifles at the Be
nlcia arsenal . than the 4000 and odd men
of the National Guard of this State would
need. It is stated that a dispatch was
received by the higher authorities of- the
guard of this State from Senator Stephen
M. White, announcing that the War De
partment Is ready at any time to make
an exchange of arms so that the guard
of California may be armed with better
rifles than It now has.
The general opinion of the officers of
the guard is' that in case of war being
declared the regulars will be sent to the
front and the National. Guardsmen of the
several States will be mustered in as vol
unteers and sent to guard ; the seacoast
on the Atlantic. and Pacific; that subse
quently.the first contingent sent to Cuba,
as a reserve, will be composed of colored
men who are better adapted for the cli
mate of that country ( than/ are white
men.
Whatever may happen the guardsmen
of California are ready to go wherever
ordered and wherever they can be of the
greatest . service, but they prefer being
sent to the front to being placd on guard
duty at some post on the seacoast.
'.',.": TO LEARN FIRST AID.
The recent work of the sanitary corps
of the Second Brigade | under the direc
tion of Major. McCarthy, as exemplified
by drill on the field, has so favorably im
pressed Colonel Smith of the First In
fantry that he has decided every man in
his regiment shall become familiar with
the principles of first aid to the wounded.
Each company of the â  regiment will be
instructed in that art for a period of
three months, so each may become thor
oughly familiar with what is required.
He also proposes that each man shall
carry in his haversack those articles that
may be of immediate, use on the field. If,
for. instance, a man should receive a
wound that severs an artery he would
be able himself, if the injury did not ren
der him unconscious, to apply the tour
niquet, check the flow of blood and be
ready for removal to the hospital tent
by the sanitary corps, or he could tem
porarily dress a < wound that needed Im
mediate attention. The Idea is that men
may learn to help themselves, until re
lief comes. â '*-' -. -v. '*-,
: RIFLE PRACTICE.
It has been finally decided to call, on
the 21st of the present month, a meeting
of the inspectors of rifle practice, with a
view to formulate a set of rules and reg
ulations to enable the members of the
guard to know, what they are > to do at
the State shoot in '-.May.* The regulations
now in force, adopted in s November, 1896,
and put into effect last June, are a mass
of misinformation 'and impracticability
that is equaled ,only by the useless red
book of the guard.. The regulations say:
* Target practice in the National-Guard shall
be held in the months of -January, May, Sep
tember and â¢ October, and at 200, .300 and 500
yard ranges and skirmish firing.' / - t
â  .Each officer and enlisted man will be al
lowed fifty-five rounds of ammunition an ' the
, same - will ibe Â» fired as â  follows: i One score of
five shots at each of . the * 200, ; 300 and 500 yard ,
ranees in January; â  one score of rive shuts
at each of the 200.- 3iW and 800 â¢ yard ranges
In I September I and â  one > score of five shots at
each of the JuO, 300 and 600 yard ranees In
October. â  Provided that each : officer and en
listed man must make -. score of at least 15
at the' 200-yard- range .before he will be â¢ per
mitted to fire at the 300- yard â¢ range; and â he
must make a score of at least; IS at the 300
yard range 'before' he wi.. be permitted to fire
at the 600-yard ranjre; also one score of ten
shots at skirmish* firing in May. r;
The -language of 'this- one of the many
sections : : of the ; regulations -.is what has '
been bothering the guardsmen since its
promulgation. â¢â â¢ If '.lt- 1 means . that : there
shall be target practice In January. May.
September and October at two, three and
five hundred â  yard ranges â¢ and skirmish
firing they are > at ".a-.- loss to understand
how they can 'â  accomplish:; that with only
fifty-five rounds of ammunition, using, up
forty-live rounds at the shoots in Janu
ary September : and October, which would
leave them only ten rounds for target and
skirmish practice "In May. The schedule
omits the m*nth of 1 May . and the infer
ence from the 'proviso": Is that the ; ten
shots must be used In skirmish- firing In
that month. If that is the case then there
can be no skirmish firing at the shoots
-in >' January; September and October, al
though there is an Inference in the. first
paragraph that "* there Is â to be skirmish
firing as well as firing at the three ranges.
Another matter that has created a great
deal* of dissatisfaction is that part which
declares - that - If â a / guardsman fails .to
score at least 15 at the 200-yard range, at
the January shoot he is disqualified from
shooting -at ; the I other ranges, and they
construe that to mean that If they fail
to- score at the first-named - range they
; are - disqualified * for â¢ the balance of ; the
year. They claim i that Â« this Is an injus
tice and shuts them , out from competing
' for ' honors. 1 5 It ' will i be : the duty ;of the
"board of Inspectors, which has been called
together -by ' Colonel Park Henshaw, to
mike the regulations so clear that all
may be able -to understand them.

Captain Perkins. During the evening
there was a short programme of music
arranged by the committee on entertain
ment, consisting of Corporal H. F. Gould

There were addresses by ( Lieutenant-
Colonel Denicke. Captains ifanks and
Boardman and others. The most interest
ing address was the one by the lieuten
ant-colonel, who at the time he was
placed on the retired list was signal offi
cer on the division staff, and who during
the war of the Rebellion was a signal
officer. His address was one calculated
to arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of ma
listeners, and in that he was very suc
cessful.
