UNITED STATES CRUISER BROOKLYN, THE FLAGSHIP OF THE FLYING SQUADRON.
TORPEDO FLEET
A MENACE TO
THIS COUNTRY
Better Be^in the War by Destroy
ing It Than Give Spain the Ad
vantage of Its Presence,
NEW YORK, March 25.â The
Herald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: In spite of the dec
larations of members of the Cab
inet and the officials of the State
Department that the departure of
the Spanish torpedo flotilla from
the Canary Islands cannot be con
sidered a menace to the United
States under the rules of interna
tional law, it is still so construed
by many officers and officials of
the Navy Department.
There is every reason, naval
officers believe, why the torpedo
flotilla should not be permitted to
reach Cuban waters, and the plan
was discussed at a conference to
day of having the flotilla inter
cepted by United States naval
vessels in the neighborhood of St
Thomas and either compelled to
turn back or surrender.
Such action, it is realized, would
be an act of war, but there are
officials in the Navy Department
who think that the United States
would better take the responsibil
ity of committing the first hostile
act than allow the Spaniards to ob
tain such a decided advantage as
they would have if the torpedo
flotilla should succeed in reaching
Havana.
According to authoritative in
formation received from Madrid to
day, naval officers there regard the
sailing of the fleet as a menace and
a threat to the United States, and
are exulting! y and openly talking
' of it as being a distinct advantage
gained over this country.
High officials of the Navy De
partment consider the coming of
this strong torpedo flotilla to
strengthen the Spanish naval
in Cuban waters as adding
so much to the gravity of the sit
uation that they held a special
conference to-day to discuss what
i action should be taken.
It is realized that if the torpedo
k boats once get into the harbor of

MADRID, Mar. 25.â 1n spite of
the absolutely pessimistic views
Jaken of the situation, I am in a
position to state that there is
yet a large margin of possibility
that war may be averted and a
settlement arrived at. Even yes
terday the Spanish Government
knew of the verdict of the Maine
Commission, and to-morrow will
know It officially. Its official re
ception will lead to a council at
which a proposition will be made
regarding the situation and a
scheme put forth for a peaceful
solution of the question. That
proposition may be startling and
unexpected, but it will voice the
sentiment of the extreme liber
als, including Sagasta and
Moret. Their views will either
dominate and secure peace, or
we may expect, without any
kind of a doubt, a ministerial
crisis. I have had a serious talk
with one of Spain's foremost and
most liberal men to-day, which
convinces me that unless the
United States absolutely insists
on war, Spain has in hand a
means of avoiding it.
Havana or some other Cuban har
bor the task of the United States
fleet in the event of war would be
made much harder. It will add
greatly to the danger of attempt
ing to take Havana if the swift
torpedo-boats are there to supple
ment the wo k of forts and the
larger Spanish vessels and make
sudden dashes upon first one and
then the other of the American at
tacking fleet. It will also make
the task of blockading Havana ex
ceedingly difficult if these vessels
are on hand ready to run out un
der cover of darkness and attack
the vessels of the blockading
squadron.
With Havana as a base of oper
ations, the torpedo flotilla might
even threaten the vessels of the
United States at Key West

Not One of the Powers Cares to

NEW YORK, March 25.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: European mediation will not
be offered to the United States and ;
Spain with a view to securing an ad- j
justment of the differences existing j
between them. Even if it were con- j
templated, and the officials have no j
knowledge of such intention, they de- j
clare that, while the relations be
tween the Washington and Madrid |
Governments are very much strained, \
the trouble has not yet reached a j
point where the mediation of a third |
power is absolutely necessary for the J
maintenance of peace.
It is confidently believed that
Spain will oe unable to count upon
the assistance of a third power in
the event of hostilities. The Presi
dent has been using the authority
given him to purchase ships abroad
to put foreign Governments in a po
sition where, should they now sell to
Spain, they wu be guilty of an un
friendly act toward the United States.
All the available snips in the market
have been negotiated for by agents
of this Government, and as a result
the officials express the opinion that
the Madrid Government has now no
chance of acquiring formidable ves
sels.
Italy has been the only power be
sides Austria which has been re
garded with some suspicion, and the
fact that the Rome Government has
announced its willingness to sell
ships to this nation indicates clearly
that it has no intention of joining in
an offensive alliance against the

TO THIS COUNTRY
Still President McKinley Is Working
Hard to Avoid an Outbreak
of Hostilities.
In the Face of the Maine Report and the Coming*
of the Spanish Torpedo Flotilla Congress
Shows Signs of Acting on Its
Own Responsibility.
NEW YORK, March 25.
The Herald's European Edi
tion publishes the following
from its correspondent: Mad
rid, Saturday â At a late
hour I find that the Spanish
reply to the United States
will not be anything like
what the sanguine optimists
expected, and the outlook
consequently is decidedly
serious.
NEW YORK, March 25â The Her-
aid's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: The situation here to-night is
more critical than it has been at any
time since the Spanish question reached
an acute stage. Even the most con
servative'believe that unless Spain re
cedes from her position hostilities may
break out within the next ten days. The
cry of the war party is now or never.
The Herald's Washington correspond
ent telegraphs: Taut as a bowstring is
the tension, and lights are burning late
in the White House. The Cabinet has
been twice in session considering the re
port of the Maine Court of Inquiry,
and at midnight the President is in con
ference with tried friends and confiden
tial advisers. The crisis over the de
struction of the battleship approaches,
and popular interest is at white heat.
How great is that interest is shown by
the crowds in Washington. The hotels
are jammed. The city has not had so
many visitors since the inauguration of
President McKinley. They are all at
tracted by the prospect of exciting times
in Congress when the President trans
mits to it the report of the Court of
Inquiry.
But just now all eyes are on the Pres
ident. The determination of the admin
istration not to be hurried into war in
opportunely, and for that matter not
to be hurried into war at all over the
destruction of the Maine, shows no
signs of being weakened. The Maine
crisis is not th. only crisis the President
has in mind. Back of the Maine he sees
Cuba. He is willing to go to war over
Cuba, if Spain will not permit the
United States to feed the suffering re
SPAIN AND AMERICA
HAVE REACHED THE
PARTING OF THE WAYS.
WASHINGTON, March 25.â The Court of Inquiry appointed to In
vestigate the cause of the Maine disaster has reported that the loss
of the battleship was due to an outside explosion. The State Depart
ment, hy direction of the President, has cabled United States Minister
Woodford, at Madrid, to notify the Spanish Government of this conclu
sion. The President and his Cabinet advisers held two extended ses
sions to-day, one at 10:30 a. m. and another at 3:30 p. m., at which the
report was considered in detail. Members of the Cabinet stated that af
ter the meeting the discussion was of a grave character, and that never
since the wrecking of the Maine has the situation seemed so critical.
The Spanish Government has cabled officially to Washington that
the Spanish Naval Commission holds the disaster to the Maine to be of
Internal origin. The Government of Spain, it can be stated positively,
Is not disposed to turn back the torpedo fleet now proceeding from the
Canaries, and would be disinclined to consider a suggestion from this
Government tending to interfere with the disposition by Spain of her
own naval forces.
War preparations on an unprecedented scale are being hurried to
completion by the War and Navy Departments, and the country prac
tically is on a war footing.

war, in the eyes of the civilized world,
would not be justified, for two rea
sons.
First â We cannot prove that Spain
blew up a United States ship.
Second â We cannot trace her respon
sibility so far even as to justify a blunt
demand for indemnity.
Therefore, it would be readily per
ceived that all the talk at the Cabinet
meetings and the President's night con
ferences has been of peace, so far as the
Maine report is concerned. What is in
the Maine report, aside from the infor
mation that it was an outside explosion
by a submarine mine, which everybody
knew through the Herald loner ago. has
not been permitted to leak in detail from
the Cabinet.
One of the conferences at the White
House was between the President, Jud^e
George F. Edmunds of Vermont, and
Second Assistant Secretary of State
Adee. This conference was about the
note to be sent to Spain about the
Maine disaster. This note is not to be
a demand for indemnity. It is rather a
representation. The difference between
a demand and a representation in this
instance, is that a demand would put
us in the position of adjudging the
Spanish nation guilty of crime, where a
representation, such as is being penned,
will state our view of the case and
leave Spain to treat it in a way that
might avert war. This representation
will be written by Judge Edmunds and
Mr. Adee, and one of the points to be
laid before Spain will be this clause from
Article VI of the treaty with Spain:
"Each party shall endeavor by all
means in their power to protect and
defend all vessels and other effects
belonging to citizens or subjects of
the other which shall be within the
extent of their jurisdiction by sea
or by land."
When this note goes to Spain the
President will be ready to send the re
port of the Court of Inquiry to Con
gress, and this will be done on Monday.
Then will come the crisis. The pro
gramme will be to have the report quiet
ly referred in the Senate to the Com
mittee on Naval Affairs, and in the
House to the Committee on Foreign
Affairs. This will gain time and drift
the poor old Maine into the channels of
diplomacy. If this be accomplished,
well and good. The immediate danger
of hostilities over the Maine will be
passed and the President will be free
to address Congress on his plan to
"feed or fight," in connection with the
general situation. How tremendously
anxious the administration is about the
conduct of Congress is shown by the
tremendous work being done among
the members of the Senate. The Sen
ate is still regarded as a tinder box.
Yet a poll has been made of that body
for the President, and the report is that2
RUSHING WORK
ON WARSHIPS AT
THE NAVY YARD
While Men fire Kept at the Re
pairs Day and Night the Re
cruiting Office f\\so Busy.
VALLKJO, March 25.â "We are working night and all day Sun
days " is the way Admiral Kirkland describes the situation at Mare
Island just now, but even that does not tell all. There are 1500 men
in the shops, along the wharves, or at work on the ships, and every
one <â ! them la working overtime. They are in three shifts and are
on the run from .airy morning until far into the night. The Charles
ton is in the dry docfk; she has been there since Sunday last, and an
other few days will see her out in the stream and almost ready to
go into commission. The Philadelphia is alongside the wharf and is
swarming with workmen, and just beyond her lies the Yorktojvn,
where more men are busy as bees. The Monterey is also alongside,
but she La up only to fill her magazines. That done, she will go down
to the city and the Monadnock will come to the yard for the same pur
pose.
"We can get the ships ready as soon as the Government wants
them," Bays Admiral Kirkland, "and when they are ready we will eas
ily get the men to man them."
on the Independence the recruiting officers are breaking all previ
, ;s recruiting records. From thirty-five to forty men in a month is
a good average under ordinary circumstances, but so far this month
there lias been over 100 shipped.
Lieut- â nant-Ciimniander Adams of the Monterey has been detailed
as recruiting officer Cor the present. He says they are Just as strict
as ever In the selection of men, and he had received no orders to be
any more lenient than the strict requirements of the regulations. It
i^ known at the yard that the Patterson, of the coast survey service,
is going to be put out of commission, and the report has it that her
officers will be given the choice of attaching to the Charleston or go
ing East. The men will be allowed to ship in the regular service and
they will be assigned to the ships now at the yard.
Another significant thing is being noticedâ supplies will come to
the navy-yard from the East by express instead of by the slower
freight, and provisions of various kinds will arrive in shipments of dif
f. rent sizes, but amounting to fully 400 tons. This would indicate that
the Charleston, Philadelphia and Yorktown are going to be rushed into
mission as Bpeedily as possible did it need any evidence beyond
the air "i" activity* which pervades the island.

tual war over the Maine affair and faces
the personal responsibility for declar
ing war not more than ten members
will he willing to leap.
But what of the House of Represen
tatives? This is the body that Speaker
Reed has been holding in the hollow
of his hand. No one until to-day
thought that the Speaker would have
'ightest trouble in restraining that
body. Now stories are afloat that there
is a just restiveness among a large num
ber of Representatives, and that they
want war at once. The Speaker vet
feels that he will be equal to the oc
casion. The announcement was made
to-day that he is moie opposed than
ever to war with Spain, and that if nec
essary he would take the floor and. par
adoxical as it may seem, tight for peace
as he never fought for anything before
in his life.
Ominous things, however, have been
happening to-day, only half concealed
by these elaborate arrangements for
peace. The President is for peace, but
to-day between the iirst meeting of the
Cabinet and the second meeting, an
order was issued by the Navy Depart
ment for all warships to be painted black.
B!.u-k is the war color. All our gun
boats, cruisers, monitors and battleships
are painted white and easily visible to

Not only the President, but the Cabi

ton Roads was officially recognized in
orders, and Commander W. S. Schlev
takes command on Monday.
For peace, too. are Speaker Reed and
such influential Senators as Gorman.
Gray, Allison, Hale and Hanna. but to
day the Cabinet received information
about Spanish finances, which indicates
that Spain is much more likely to go to
war than any one in the administration
thought. The impression has been that
Spanish bonds are largely held through
out Europe. The information given the
Cabinet to-day was that about 8o per
cent of Spanish bonds are held by Span
iards. This, of course, in a measure re
moves the likelihood ol intervention be
tween Spain and the United States by
some other power. But it also lessens
the likelihod that Spain will be re
strained by her creditors.
The administration was also informed
that the Spanish debt is $1,700,000,000,
and the revenues fall about $25,000,000
short of paying the interest. The Gov
ernment has no information about the
loan that Spain is reported to have ne
gotiated with the Bank of Spain for
$40,000,000. If this be true, and it is
accepted as a fact, then it is regarded
that Spain has procured this money for
war preparations.
With information of this sort leaking
out, and stories, ten times more lurid
Hying everywhere, and eaperly accepted,
what wonder is it that the war spirit
is running bankful, like the Ohio River.
The hotel corridors are crowded to
night, and there is but one topic. Ev
erybody is talking of the outcome of
the Maine renort.
In the corridors to-night a member
of the Republican National Committee
said the President would be forced to
act in favor of a war policy.
"It he does not do so," said this
man. "there will be no Republican party
left. No one can get to the President to
tell him the truth, but if we do not
declare against Spain I'll tell you what
will happen. Fitzhugh Lee will resign
in ten days. He will lay the whole
thing bare. He will become a popular
idol, and be elected President."
On the other hand, General Lona
street. the most conspicuous soldier on
either side, serving in the late war,
said: "No one wants war unless it
becomes our duty to go to war. I don't
want war unless we have to fight. I
know what war is. We can do far bet
ter with Spain as our friend than with
Spain as our enemy. I feel that the sit
uation is in wise hands. I believe the
President will avoid war with honor to
America."
SPANIARDS ARE
SUPPLEMENTING
FORTIFICATIONS
San Juar), the Main Port of the
Island of Puerto F^ico, BeiQg
StrengtheQed.
WASHINGTON, March 25.â Word reached the Navy Department of
ficials to-day that the Spanish authorities have taken steps to supple
ment the existing fortifications at San Juan de Porto Rico, the main
port of the island of Porto Rico. The news is regarded as signi
ficant. Porto Rico is the only other possession which belongs to the
Spanish Government on this hemisphere besides Cuba. The officials
of the department, while acknowledging that Information of the fore
going character has reached them, are very chary about imparting any
of the details to the press. The city of Porto Rico is fortified after
the old style prevalent in early days. The defenses consist of a wall
which completely circles the several forts at strategic points, while the
only points of egress and ingress are through massi%-e gates. These
fortifications are being strengthened and the armament has been in
creased by two large guns of formidable pattern and caliber. San
Juan has 23,414 inhabitants.
Lieutenant Colwell of London was directed by the Navy Department
to urge the builders of the recently purrtiased cruiser Albany, former
ly the Brazilian vessel Abruall, to hasten the construction of the ship
with all possible speed. In the ordinary course of the work the yes
. sel would not be completed before next December, but it is bejleved
by olficials of the Navy Department that if the builders are placed un
der pressure she can be made ready for sea within three months, and
perhaps in a little less time.

Percy A. Pope, U. S. M. C, the recent-
ly appointed commandant of the ma

the Charleston navy-yard, arrived in
Boston this afternoon about 3 o'clock.
He went at once to the yard from the
Albany station and was entertained at
the home of Commodore Howison.
commandant of the navy-yard, where
Mrs. Pope had preceded him. Major
Pope was not officially received by the
Marine Corps. The ceremony of his
taking charge of the marines, the
prison and the recruiting station will
take place to-morrow morning. The
entire command will be drawn up in
full dress uniform and Captain Kelton,
who has been in charge, will turn over
the command to Major Pope. The lat
ter really succeeds Major Robert E.
Mead, who was placed in command at
the Portsmouth navy-yard.
Major Pope is not a stranger to the
Charleston yard. He was brought up
in Charleston, and it was here that he
saw his first service as an officer of
the Marine Corps. Nearly five years
ago he was detached and placed in
command of the forces at Mare Island,
California, where he has been ever
since. The major was seen last even
ins by a Call man at the home of Com
modore Howison. He said that he would
assume command to-morrow. He left
Mare Island about a week ago.
"The war scare," he said, "has hard
ly reached the Pacific Coast yet. Things
were very quiet at the Mare Island
yards when I left there. Some three
ships were being repaird, but that was
all. Being so removed from the cen
ter of the trouble, there has been lit
tle of the war talk heard."
In answer to the reporter's query
Major Pope said that from what he
had heard on his way through the
country he thought the situation was
serious, but he hoped that the Govern
ment would be able to avert a con
flict.

Consul-General Lee this morning ca

Mr. Klopsch has received a cable
from a personal friend that Mr. Ste

ence in Red Cross work. Answering
this dispatch, Mr. Klopsch cabled to
Mr. Sanderson, editor of the Christian

not feed the hungry. The work ne
cessary is to move supplies, and no
obstacles should be placed in our way.
Mr. Barton should not talk until he
has heard both sides. I hope Mr.
Schieren will take no stand until he
sees me. I leave for New York next
Wednesday, but will return to Havana
at once and charter a 750-ton steamer to
handle supplies."
Miss Clara Barton, it is expected, will
reach Washington to-morrow and it is
said that she will at once use her in

regards in no friendly light, believing
that he has interfered with her.

The German Government
Consents to Help Un

This Will Be a Most Valua
ble Acquisition to the
Navy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. March 25.â Navy
Department was informed by cable
gram from Lieutenant Colwell, naval
attache to the..United States . embassy
at London, that agents of this Govern
ment had purchased a "Schischad"
torpedo-boat that had been constructed
for the German Government. The new
acquisition is of the general type of
German torpedo-boats, and is regarded
as a valuable addition to our navy One
feature regarding her that affords
special gratification to the officials of
the Navy: Department is that she is
now ready for sea. It is expected that
in a few days she will leave for the
United States. She will be able to make
the Journey across the Atlantic without
difficulty, as she is a good; sea-going
vessel, and her coal capacity is ample
for the trip to, this country
She is a twer^y-three knot- vessel,
and about 150 feet long. While of the
same general type as the Rodgers and
Foote of the United States navy, she
is a trine larger. At the Navy Depart
ment the precise dimensions of the new
boat could not be given. The price paid
for her . , the j navy officials declined at
this time, to state/but it was said to
be very reasonable.
Work on the vessel, has just been
completed. She never . has '< been in
service. She is supposed to carry three
torpedo tubes and two small-caliber
rapid-fire guns. Nine: to twelve men
will be needed to man her. â¢ 'â¢ '

HOLDS SPAIN
RESPONSIBLE
There Can Be No Doubt
as to the Meaning
of the Report.
President and Cabinet Con
vinced That an Outside Ex
plosion Sunk the Maine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 25.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: The report is con
sidered by the President and Secretary
Long as definitely determining that
the explosion came from outside the
vessel, and that it was thiÃ outside ex
plosion which resulted in the de
struction of the ship and the death of
so many as 266 of her officers and
crew, is indicated by the fact that they
have notified Professor Monroe of Co
lumbia University, one of the highest
authorities in the country on explo
sives, that his services in connection
with the report would not be required.
Professor Monroe, who was formerly
attached to the torpedo station at New
port, had placed his services at the dis
posal of Secretary Long in case he
would be required to clear up any
doubtful points in the report of the
Court of Inquiry. The report has been
found so conclusive that no expert
analysis of it and of the testimony by
Professor Monroe was required to en
ble the President and Secretary Long
to decide that the findings of the court
are conclusive as to tfie points covered.
While the report does not fix the re
sponsibility of the explosion and does
not in any way connect any individual
or the Spanish Government with it di
rectly, the testimony as to the destruc
tion of the ship coming from an out
side source is so strong that it will lead
to inferences that may be fraught with
tremendous consequences. Already
these inferences are being drawn, based
on the immense amount of some pow
erful high explosive which must have
been employed, and on the well-known
fact that the importation of explosives
into Havana at all times is carefully
regulated and that no one inside the
city or harbor except the agents of the
Spanish Government and the Maine
herself could legally have been in pos
session of such an amount of ex
plosives as must have been used to de
stroy the ship.
Officials of the administration are
very guarded in all their references to
the report, and if they are drawing
such conclusions- as are freely voiced
by members of the Senate and House,
who would rather go to - ar to avenge
American s ilors than feed the starv
ing Cubans, they are very careful not
to give expressions to them. The Presi
dent, Secretary Long and others of the
Cabinet are counseling conservatism
and patience until Monday, when the
report and testimony on which it is
based will be made public by being
transmitted to both houses of Congress.
SPANISH WILL
GET NO HELP
FROM EUROPE
Continued from First Page.
the Frenoh Ambassador and in touch
with affairs of France, told me to
day that, while i ranee was unques
tionably interested in the Cuban
question, both on account of the large
loans her citizens had made to Spain
and the fact that she had common
ties with Spain by reason of race
affiliation and territorial situations,
she would not give active support
to the Madrid Government in the
event of war and would not offer her
good offices for the settlement of the
trouble unless she had prior assur
ances that the tender would be ac
ceptable to the Sagasta Ministry and
the McKinley administration.
"France is very friendly to the
United States as well as to Spain,"
he continued, "and her interests
would be largely affected in case of
war. Take, for instance, the Paris
exposition, which is to be held in
1900. If Spain and the American
republic engage in hostilities neither
will be able to participate in the ex
position, and their absence from that
fair would leave vacant space which
will have to be filled and which will
not only necessitate the expenditure
of more money, but will injure the
success of the exposition and the
trade which France hoped would re
sult therefrom.
"There has been some talk in dip
lomatic circles that the nations of
Europe might act in concert to put
an end to the trouble between the
United States and Spain. Ido not
believe that this Government need
have any fear on that score. Great
Britain would never consent to such
a step because she would nppreciate
that such action would lose for her
forever the chance of entering into
an offensive and defensive alliance
with her American offspring. Ger
many would be willing to humiliate
the United States if it were possible
to do so and Austria wou,ld join with
Germany. Russia, I believe, not
withstanding the persuasion of
France, would be disinclined to take
any step in the strictly private af
fairs of the United States and Spain."
APPROVES THE
PRESIDENT'S COURSE.
Senator White Says the Policy of the
Administration Has Been a
Wise One.
SACRAMENTO, March 25.â United
States Senator Stephen M. White, en
route from Los Angele-- to Washington,
was in the city several hours this even
ing. He was met at the depot by Ad
jutant-General A. W. Barrett and was
informally received at the Golden Eagle
Hotel by Peter J. Shields, Colonel R. L.
Peeler, Judge A. C. Hinkson, Thomas
Fox and other prominent Democrats.
Senator White was non-committal in
speaking of the Cuban situation, and
said he advocated waiting for a report
of the examining board before giving
an opinion on the blowing up of the
Maine. He thought the course adopted
by President McKinley had been a wise
one.
SCHLEY GETS
INSTRUCTIONS
Commodore Advised as to
Plans Arranged in
Case of War.
. .
Flying Squadron to Be Kept
Separate From the Fleet
at Key West.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Com
modore Schley was in conference to
day with officials of the Navy Depart
ment, receiving instructions which will
guide him should war occur between
the United States and Spain.
For the present Commodore Schley's
squadron will kept separate and dis
tinct from the fleet at Key West, but
in the event that hostilities should oc
cur there would undoubtedly be joint
operations conducted until such time
as the Spanish fleet in Cuban waters
shall have been destroyed or demor
alized, when the flying squadron
would turn its attention to the Spanish
coast.
As the plan of operations was out
lined to me to-day, I understand that
it is proposed to blockade Havana and
Matanzas first, and, having closed
these ports as a supply basis for Span
ish vessels, to separate Commodore
Schley's command and to dispatch it
to Porto Rico and across the ocean
with a view to preventing Spain from
sending re-enforcements to Cuba.
The possibility that war may occur
before the Spanish torpedo boat flotilla
has reached Porto Rico has induced
naval authorities to give serious con
sideration to a plan of sending the fly
ing squadron at once to a point di
rectly in the path of the flotilla, and in
case of war to dispose of these little
hornets as quickly as possible.
EVIDENTLY
EXPECTING
ARBITRATION
El Comercio Praises Blanco for
Refusing the Use of Dyr)a
mite on the Maine.
Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, March 25.â Officers of the volunteers have submitted to
General Arolas plans for academies of military instructions, as di
rected, and at the same time the plans to increase the number of men
in each battalion and for general reorganization. General Arolas has
promised his support and Captain-General Blanco will recommend
them to the Madrid Government.
El Comercio says under the title, "We are in Time:" "It is most
important to take due precautions so that if trouble from abroad
should be inevitable we should not be found unprepared to .meet it.
Loyal Spaniards should sustain the dignified attitude of Captain-
General Blanco in refusing Captain Sigsbee's presumptuous request to
permit the use of dynamite in blowing up the wreck of the Maine.
Within that wreck lies proof that the disaster was due to internal
causes. Since a difference appears in the conclusions reached by the
Spanish and American Courts of Inquiry the wreck must remain in
tact to afford evidence for a possible court of arbitration."
El Commercio also points out th 3 danger to neighboring wharves
and buildings which the use of dynamite might involve, since it is not
unlikely that explosive material still remains in the wreck.
The paper adds: "Spain has endured as much as possible for the
sake of peace; she has tolerated the insidious alarms of Monroeism
and has conceded much in the interest of amity. If, after her many
sacrifices, Spain is still provoked to action she will accept the chal
lenge with dignity and without fear."
WAR PAINT IS
NOW ORDERED
Hulls of Men -of- War
Will All Be Painted
Black.
This Is Regarded by Navai Of
ficers as Being Peculiarly
Significant.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 25.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald says: In
stead of glistening white, which has
made the American modern navy so
distinctive and attractive, the hulls of
men-of-war of the service will here
after be black. The issuance of ap
parently insignificant orders to this
effect after consideration by the Cabi
net of the report of the Court of In
quiry on the battle-ship Maine, was
thought the most important by naval
officers, and indicates to their mind that
the administration, appreciating the
present strain on the relations between
this Government and Spain, has de
cided to adopt a war color for Ameri
can vessels.
Instructions were that ships should
be painted black at once. They were
sent by telegraph to Captain Sampson,
Commander-in-chief of the North At
lantic station; to Commodore Dewey,
commander-in-chief of the Asiatic
station; to vessels attached to the Pa
cific station and to other ships on de
tached service. Torpedo boats are the
only class of vessels exempt from the
order issued by the Secretary. The
boats are painted sea green, which
makes them almost invisible at night,
lying low in the water. It is almost im
possible to see them on a dark night,
and naval officers ascribe much of the
invisibility to the color of the paint.
Just as the department desires tor
pedo boats to be as invisible as .possible,
so it is anxious that the larger men-of-
war be inconspicuous. It is appreciated
by the authorities that if they were al
lowed to wear white during war an
enemy would be more apt to discover
their whereabouts than if they were
painted a gloomy color. It was with a
view, therefore, of deceiving the Span
ish fleet as to their whereabouts that
the instructions were issued directing
that hereafter black be used as the
color of the paint for hulls of ships in
commission.
MANY SEAMEN
ARE WANTED
IN A HURRY
While Machinists, Firemen and
Sailors (\re Recruited, Survey
Crews fire Transferred.
Men are wanted for the navy, and Uncle Sam is evidently in a
hurry. The three coast survey steamers are to go out of commission and
their officers will hold themselves in readiness to hurry East, while the
men will be transferred to the United States receiving ship Independ
ence. The recruiting office at 10 California street was put in opera
tion early yesterday morning, and Lieutenant George M. Stoney swore
in five men before the day was out. The schoolship Pensacola has
been tied up to a mooring buoy at the navy-yard and the petty offi
cers and men have been transferred to tl^e Independence.
The officers of the coast survey steamers who will go East are:
Lieutenant-Commander J. Forse, Lieutenants (junior grade) G. W.
Brown, G. R. Slocum, R. E. Coontz of the Steamer Patterson; Lieu
tenant-Commander H. P. Osborn*. Lieutenant (junior grade) A. M.
Beedell; Ensigns C. M. Stone, P. Symonton of the steamer McArthur;
Lieutenant J. M. Helm, Lieutenant (junior grade) W. A. McCulty and
Ensign M. L. Miller of the steamer Gedney. All the sailors on the
three survey steamers were enlisted for three years for "special ser
vice," and now they will have a chance to do it aboard a man-of-war.
The men wanted at the Naval Rendezvous are machinists, oilers,
coal-passers, firemen and seamen. Landsmen are not wanted just now,
as Uncle Sam desires men who know their business, and not amateurs.
The first vessel to be manned will be the Charleston and the men
from the Patterson, Gedney, McArthur and Pensacola will so on her.
The next warship to go out will be the gunboat Yorktown, and
as soon as she is manned and ready for battle the cruiser Philadel
phia will be ready to go into commission. If the number of men of
fering for enlistment is anything like what is expected there will be
men to spare and these will be drafted East to fill vacancies on ships
of the navy already in commission. Candidates for enlistment in the
engineers' department will be examined daily at It) California street by
an engineer from the coast defense steamer Monadnock now in port.
Among the officers and men who have been retired and who are now
anxious to be restored to the acti>e list are Lieutenant J. Burnett,
Gunner J. B. Tresselt and Sailmaker William Redstone. Tresselt was
a gunner on the Trenton and was injured on that vessel in the Samoan
hurricane.
GOES IN HASTE
TO HAVANA
Tender Mangrove Dis
patched, Ostensibly to
Bring Americans.
Much Excitement at Key West
Following the Report as to
Findings of Naval Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, March 25.â The Associ
ated Press bulletin that the Court of
Inquiry has found that the Maine was
blown up by a submarine mine created
intense excitement here. It was read
by eager crowds, which included Rear
Admiral Sicard, elderly captains and
young cadets. As frequently stated in
these dispatches, most of the naval offi
cers at Key West have held to the opin
ion shared by all the officers of the
Maine, that the warship was blown up
by external means. The minority who
previous to to-day had expressed the
conviction that the court would be un
able to determine the cause, was hard
to find. All were glad to know the
Maine's fate was not due to the neglect
of the officers.
Intense eagerness for further details
is manifested on all sides. Countless
opinions are offered as to the possibil
ity of war and arbitration. Until a
late hour to-night discussion was ram
pant on ship and land as to the out
come.
The most significant development
that followed the announcement of the
court's report â a development known to
but few â was the sudden sailing of the
lighthouse tender Mangrove for Hava
na, The Mangrove was lying quietly
at the dock, loading buoys, when or
ders came about 5 o'clock this after
noon for her to proceed with all haste
to Havana and to take on board all
the American officials In that city
with the exception of Consul General
Lee.
It is feared here that the knowledge
of the court's report has excited Ha
vana's population and brought the
anti-American sentiment to a climax.
Officers of high rank were still reticent.
Rear Admiral Sicard, however, said:
"The Court of Inquiry brought in find
ings according to what its members be
lieved. Nothing could have made them
do otherwise. If they had been able to
fix the responsibility, I feel sure they
would not have shirked this duty."
The attention of Rear- Admiral Sicard
was drawn to the fact that Spain had
officially denied that Havana harbor
was mined. He replied: "If Havana
harbor were mine, I certainly should
have mined it. The water there is es
pecially suited for such a method of
defense. Spain's denial had nothing to
do with the Court of Inquiry. I should
not believe a statement that Havana
harbor was not mined. The court had
not yet been dissolved. It is barely
possible that more work may be re
quired of it; but this is not probable.
The Court of Inquiry is composed of
splendid men. I am greatly satisfied
with their work. I hardly suppose that
much excitement will be caused by the
announcement of the verdict, as I am
under the impression that 99 per cent
of our own people were already con
vinced that the Maine was blown up
externally; and I scarcely think their
Ideas would be changed even if the
court had reported otherwise."
When the possibility of arbitration
and the ensuing entanglement were
suggested to him, Rear-Admiral Sicard
said: "The Maine case is nothing in
comparison with the Alabama claims.
Then we were opposed to a powerful
commercial rival; but now we are deal
ing with Spain."

"Distressing as the outlook
may be, I do not see how war
can be avoided."â From an in
terview with Senator Gorman of
Maryland.
NEW YORK, March 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald has this:
Senator Gorman says he does not be
lieve there will be any material oppo
sition to the President's policy in deal-
Ing with the Cuban question from Dem
ocrats of the House or Senate. He
made that statement to me this even-
Ing during an interesting conversation
on the subject. Mr. Gorman is not a
sensationalist, nor is he disposed to
jump at conclusions hastily. In view
of his recent consultation with Presi
dent McKinley and the fact that he is
the recognized leader of the Demo
cratic forces in the Senate his views at
this juncture will be read with -addi
tional interest.
"As I understand it," the Senator
said, "it is the President's fixed deter
mination to send substantial relief to
the suffering people in Cuba. In that
humane act he will, in my judgment,
be backed up by the great majority of
the American peuple. I am convinced
that there is an overwhelming majority
in Congress ready to sustain him in his
course. 1 am convinced that he thor
oughly appreciates the Importance o-f
taking prompt and decisive action. It
remains io be seen whether Spain will
resent the humanitarian spirit which
prompts the American people in this
matter. In my judgment the Spanish
people will resent our well-intended in
tervention. That, of course, will result
in a conflict between the two nations.
I do not wish t<> see this country in
volved in war with Spain i/r any other
j'ation, for that matter. War is a very

will be no hesitation in voting
another $50,000,000 if tfio President tells
us he needs it, and there will be pro
visions i>ut into the sundry civil ap
propriation bill to purchase supplies for
the Cubans if the President indicates to
us that he wants it. There has been
no consultation among Democrats on
this subject, and I do not believe there
is any occasion for a party conference
so long as the President adheres to his
firm policy of sending relief to Cuba
on peaceful terms if possible, and re
sorting to force, if necessary. I re
gret to say that I do not look for Spain
to quietly submit to such action on our
part. They are a proud people, and
they will in all probability resent our
good intentions.
"Distressing as the outlook may be,
Ido not see how hostilities can be
avoided. The appropriation of $50,000,
000 for preparations for war was not re
sorted to until it became evident that
Spuin intended to resist our efforts to
feed her starved and neglected peo
ple. The preparations which have been
going on in this country, as well as in
Spain, show conclusively that both
countries are Aroused to a full under
standing of the situation and it will
require the most delicate diplomacy to
prevent a conflict."
Senator Lindsay of Kentucky be
lieves that it is the duty of this Gov
ernment to recognize the independence
of Cuba, and contends that such step
on our part must necessarily carry with
it the intervention of our Government
in behalf of the new republic.
"It is my idea," said he, "that the
course for this Government to pursue
Is to .recognize the independence of the
Cubans and to follow that up by such
assistance as they may require to bring
peace on the Island. If we recognize
the Cuban republic we are bound by
the Monroe doctrine to keep Spain and
any other European nation from inter
fering with her affairs. I think that
. the London newspapers which declare
it our duty to either join with the Sa
gasta Ministry and bring peace accord
ing to his lines or to at once intervene
by aiding the Cuban republic, expressed
the exact situation. We must do one
thine: or the other."
Senator Julius Caesar Burrows of
Michigan said: "I see no particular
change in - the situation. Certainly
there Is nothing alarming. The next
thirty days will probably develop some
thing definite. Everybody in the Unit
ed States is crying out against the con
dition of the Cubans brought about by
the policy of concentration inaugurat
ed by Spain.
"I think the first thing necessary is
to relieve the suffering of those people,
but while doing this with one hand, we
should notify Spain that the policy
which reduces these people to starvation
must be abandoned. If Spain objects
to our feeding the starving victims of
her cruelty, then we must feed them
anyhow, and if necessary under the
protection of the guns of American
ships of war, and in the presence of
American soldiers and sailors." '- â

WILL BUILD DESTROYERS
OF TORPEDO BOATS.
Lewis Nixon May Get Contracts to
Turn Out Rapidly a Dozen
Such Craft.
NEW YORK. March 25.â Lewis Nix
on, proprietor of the Crescent Ship
yards, Elizabeth, N. J., is to receive
orders from the Government, it is re
ported to-day, for ten or twelve first
class torpedo-boat destroyers. Mr.
Nixon went to Washington recently,
and with several naval officers dis
cussed plans for a most efficient class
of torpedo-boat destroyers. He re
turned to Elizabeth on Thursday, and
for an hour was in consultation with
various heads of departments at his
yards about the ability of the plant to
start to turn out boats on short notice.
It was found that the first boat could
be finished in ninety days, and work
on the others rushed along at the same
time, so there would be only about two
weeks' wait for each of the others.
Nixon has a bid in for three thirty-knot
torpedo-boat destroyers, but the Gov
ernment, according to the report, is
anxious to increa.se the order, and he
will be ready to fill it. It is said that
plans for torpedo-boat destroyers are
now being prepared.

CATHOLICS LOYAL
TO THIS COUNTRY.!
President Delaney of the Knights of
Columbus Utters Some Very
Significant Words.
CHICAGO, March 25.â At Central
Music Hall last night, before a large
audience of Roman Catholics, presided
over by Archbishop Fehan, Hon. John
5. Delaney of New York delivered an
address under the auspices of the
Knights of Columbus, of which he is
the chief executive.
While eloquently telling what
America had done for the people of the
Catholic faith and what they had done
for her, he paused a moment and said:
"Need I add that if any crisis arises in
the life of this nation to-morrow, let
the occasion come how it may, you
may be sure that the Catholics of the
United States will, if need be, drain
every vein in their bodies to prove
their devotion?"
The applause that followed continued
several moments.

By 6 o elbek this evening there had
been over 150 names enrolled, embrac
ing those of all classes and stations.
Should a call be made for volunteers
in case of war with Spain a full regi

themselves into a cavalry regimentand
ask to be sent to Cuba.
RAPID-FIRE GUNS
ARE BOUGHT ABROAD.
WASHINGTON, March 25.â The Ord-
nance Bureau of the War Department
expects to obtain in all about forty
six rapid-fire guns from abroad for the
seacoast fortifications. Twenty of these
were obtained through Vickers Sons
and the remainder through the Hotch
kiss Company. The former consign
ment, it is understood, is already on
its way to this country. These guns
are of 4.7 caliber and the officials say
the contract providing for their pur
chase includes between two and three
hundred rounds of ammunition, a very
desirable thing at the present time.
Not Delayed by Protests.
WASHINGTON, March 25.â Protests
against the Oregon's removal from
San Francisco are still being received
daily at the Navy Department, and
promptly pigeon-holed. They are too
late, and the Oregon will continue her
voyage to Callao. If she does not re
ceive any orders then* she will continue
to Valparaiso and stop again for or
ders.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1898.
NEW 12-INCH DISAPPEARING GUN FOR SAN FRANCISCO.
NOT TAKING
ANY CHANCES
Government Continues to
Strengthen the Coast
Fortifications.
Big Guns Arriving for the Pre
sidio and Forts. Around
the Bay.
Plenty of Projectiles Are Also Being
Shipptd for the Hijh-Power
Cannon.
It is considered that San Francisco,
in the event of war between the United
States and Spain, would be remote
from the scene of actual conflict, yet
the Government is taking no chances
on this account. Preparations for the
defense of this harbor are going for
ward with vigor. Immense quantities
of ammunition have been delivered and
the Ordnance Bureau is advised that a
further supply is on the rail due to ar
rive in this city early next week.
Another 12-inch gun for the Fort
Point fortifications arrived yesterday,
and is now at the Southern Pacific
freight yards at Fourth and Townsend
streets. The immense gun weighs fifty
nine tons. On account of its weight it
cannot be taken over the streets of San
Francisco to its appointed place on the
Presidio reservation. To-day the Quar
termaster's Department will enter into
a contract with same individual or firm
to transport the ordnance by water to
a point near the works. From the land
ing place near the battery it will be
hauled up the hill.
This latest 12-inch breech-loading:
rifle will be mounted on a disappearing
carriage. The ponderous carriage,
which weighs 180 tons, also arrived yes
terday. The emplacement for the gun
is on the extreme right of the 12-inch
battery near the left of the 10-inch bat
tery of disappearing guns. Another
rifle of the 12-inch pattern is on the rail
billed for San Francisco, and should
arrive in a few days. It may be sent
over to Lime Point to re-enforce the
Fort Baker battery.
Morton's drays were busy yesterday
conveying projectiles for the me-rtars
and high-power rifles to the Presidio
magazines. T^e ammunition comes
from the Watertown and Watervliet
arsenals.
To-day the Quartermaster's Depart
ment will receive bids for twenty mil
lion pounds of coal.
General William R. Shafter, com
manding the department of California,
yesterday issued the following orders:
Pursuant of authorization from the
Acting Secretary of War, a class will
be formed at the Presidio of San Fran
cisco, Cal., consisting of two men from
each troop of cavalry and each com
pany of infantry serving in this de
partment, for instruction in signaling,
under the immediatechargeof thesignal
officer of the department. The class
will be stationed at the Presidio, to
which point the detail from the com
panies at Benicia barracks will be sent
at once. This detail will be rationed
and quartered with one of the infantry
companies at the post. The men of the
signal class will be selected by their
troop* and company commanders and
will be sent to report to the command
ing officer of the Presidio on Monday,
the 28th inst., at such hour as he may
designate.
First Lieutenant Frank Greene, sig
nal corps, will make such journeys as

Captain Shoemaker, chief of the rev
enue cutter service, was busily en
gaged to-day in making assignments
of officers to the revenue cutters de
tailed yesterday for defensive service
along the Atlantic seaboard. Every
vessel in the service available for ac
tion has been, or will be, assigned to
duty. Even the new cutter Gresham,
on the Great Lakes, and the little cut
ter Calumet, located at Chicago, have
been called on, and in a day or two
both the lake ships will be en route to
the rendezvous at Hampton Roads.
The commanders of the revenue cut
ters have been notified by wire to be in
readiness to move as soon as their gen
eral orders were received.
The revenue cutters which will be
ordered into service and their present
stations are as follows: The Wood
bury, at Portland, Me.; Hamilton,
Philadelphia; Hudson, New York;
Manning, Boston; Calumet, Chicago;
Gresham, Milwaukee; Morrow, Wil
mington, N. C., and Windom, Balti
more.
Captain Shoemaker was of the opin
ion that it would require about a week
for all of the vessels to reach Hampton
Roads, or rather Norfolk, which will
be their official rendezvous. At the
navy-yard there the vessels will re
ceive their equipment â guns, ammuni
tion, torpedoes and supplies â and will
make such other preparations as are
necessary for fighting service. The new
cutter Gresham. recently built at
Cleveland, in a brief time can be
transformed into a â¢ formidable com
merce destroyer or torpedo boat. She
was built expressly for such an emer
gency as she is now called upon to
meet. She is equipped for a torpedo
tube and can carry an ugly battery of
rapid-fire guns. All of the vessels are
first-rate seagoing craft and all of
them are fitted with small but effective
batteries. Their speed varies from
fourteen to twenty knots.
All officers of the revenue-cutter
service now on duty with the life-sav
ing service are being withdrawn to
day and assigned to duty on the ves
sels ordered to Norfolk. Their orders
are made Immediately effective in
every case, and they will report to the
commanding officers of the ships as
soon as the vessels arrive at Norfolk.
As soon as the cutters are prepared for
service at the Norfolk navy-yard they
will be dispatched to Key West and
placed at the disposal of Commodore
Sampson, in command of the naval
squadron at that station. The cutters
will be employed as scout or picket
boats, and will be prepared for both
offensive and defensive service. It is
thought they will prove to be pretty
formidable ships even .in aggrersive
tactics.
The new revenue cutter McCollaoh
left Baltimore several weeks ago for
duty on the Pacific, going by way of
the Mediterranean Sea and Suez canal.
She is now somewhere in the vicinity of
Singapore, and will be used as a dis
patch boat on the Asiatic station. Un
less present plans are changed, a cable
message will be to her commander
at Singapore, directing her to proceed
to Hongkong and place his vessel and
crew under the command of Commo
dore Dewey, in charge of the naval
forces on the Asiatic station.

Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, March 25.
The "flying squadron" was definite
ly established to-day with Commodore
Schley in command. He will hoist
his commodore's flag on the flagship
Brooklyn next Monday. The squadron
is to consist of exactly five ships, de
spite conjectures as to possible ships
that might be added. Those of the
squadron will be the crack armored
cruiser Brooklyn, the battle-ships
Massachusetts and Texas and the cruis
ers Columbia and Minneapolis. Other
ships which are now or will be hereaf
ter at Hampton Roads will not be of
the flying squadron, but will belong to
the North Atlantic station under Cap
tain Sampson. The flying squadron
is to be a small, compact fleet of the
best ships of the navy, for quick ser
vice at any point along the Atlantic.
At the same time the North Atlantic
station, under Captain Sampson, is to
be further augmented. The cruiser
Cincinnati, which left Port Antonio
three days ago under sealed orders, is
to report at Key West and become a
part of Captain Sampson's fleet. The
gunboat Wilmington, also en route
from Port Antonio, will likewise report
to Captain Sampson at Key West, as
well as the gunboat Vicksburg, now at
Hampton Roads. Late to-day the Navy
Department gave out the following
list of vessels, as showing the exact
character of each fleet as it stands to-
day:
The following vessels compose the
North Atlantic squadron: New York,
lowa Indiana, Miantonomah, Fern,
Puritan, Terror, Marblehead, Montgom
ery Delaware, Castine, Nashville, He
lena, Wilmington, Vesuvius, torpedo
boats Foote. Dupont, Erlccson, Cush
ing. Porter, Winslow, tugs Leyden and
Samoset.
The following vessels comprise the
flying squadron: The Brooklyn, Mas

exceptions. the finest In the United States,
according to the testimony of the East
ern players who have been upon the
grounds. The Gilt Edges, who are in the
Pacific Coast States League, playing in
San Francisco at Central Park, are a
stronger aggregation this year than they
were last year when they defeated the
world-famous Baltimores. They will play
in San Francisco two weeks from next
Sunday. Harvey and Doyle will be the
pitchers, and Stanley catcher; Hennessy,
first base; Hughes second base; Lock
head shortstop; Peoples, third base;
Shan'ihan, center field; Borland, left field,
and Dennie, one of the extra pitchers,
will alternate one of the other pitchers in

REGARD THE
SITUATION
AS GRAVER
The President and Cabinet
Now Feel That War Is
Drawing Near.
Report of the Naval Court of In
quiry That Spanish Officers
Are Implicated May Hast=
en the Conflict.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 25.
In spite of the assurances given by
a member of the Cabinet to-night that
there are no unusual or startling de
velopments in the Cuban situation, it is
known that the President and his Cab
inet regard the situation as graver than
it has been at any time.
The Naval Court's report of an out
side explosion by a submarine mine and
that the responsibility cannot be fixed
was discounted some time ago, and it
was predicted here that no demand for
indemnity would be made unless it ap
peared conclusively that the Spanish
Government was grossly negligent.
Nevertheless the testimony itself as re
viewed by President McKinley and his
Cabinet to-day is calculated to create
a sensation when it is transmitted to
Congress. The Naval Court states posi
tively that the vessel was destroyed by
an outside explosion (probably a
mine), but does not attempt to locate
the responsibility.
But the testimony of divers and other
witnesses examined by the court is said
to be startling, ami leads to the inev
itable conclusion that Spanish officers
must have had pome knowledge of a de
sign to destroy the Maine, although
they may not have been actual partici
pants. It is considered impossible that
such a terrible engine of destruction
could have been placed under the vessel
and in such close proximity to the
Spanish warship Alphonso XII without
the officers of that vessel being aware
of these operations.
The evidence tends to convict the
Spanish officers aboard the Alphonse
XII and on shore of gross and crim
inal negligence. ' The President and
Cabinet some time ago agreed with E.
J. Phelps, ex-Minister to England, that
no demand for indemnity would be
valid unless the participation of Span
ish officers was proved or unless there
appeared to be gross negligence on
their part. The President and his Cab
inet are apprehensive that when the
evidence is read in the Senate and
House Congress can no longer be
restrained.
Ex-Senator Edmunds was in consul
tation with President McKinley for
two hours this evening. He discussed
the report from a judicial standpoint,
and his opinions are known to be con
sidered highly important by the Presi
dent, as he has been opposed to war
from the first. From the fact that the
President consulted with Mr. Edmunds
it is believed that he is yet considering
Spain's culpability for the disaster or
her liability for indemnity.
It is believed to-night that in view of
the sensational testimony taken by the
court and notwithstanding the court's
failure to fix the responsibility Presi
dent McKinley, fearful of radical ac
tion by Congress, may yet be forced to
make an immediate demand upon
Spain for reparation. For the past few
days it has been thought he might
waive his demand for a money indem
nity and propose merely a policy of
"peaceful intervention" by sending
food and supplies to the suffering Cu
bans, but this plan might be changed.
No decision will be reached, however,
until all of the evidence has been care
fully reviewed by the President. He
will devote all of to-morrow and Sun
day to this and it is expected that the
evidence and report of the court will
be printed at the Government Printing
Office in time for distribution to Con
gress on Monday or Tuesday.
The war feeling is intense to-night.
Crowds gathered to-night at all the
leading hotels, eagerly discussing the
exciting and important news of the
day, and at the principal clubs, notably
at the Army and Navy, zealous offi
cers of both arms of the service talked
enthusiastically of the possibilities of
active participation in war. Nowhere

is the war spirit more rampant than
at the armories of the District of Co
lumbia militia companies. The District
has nearly three thousand militia men,
including her High School Cadets, and
they are all under high pressure, ex
pecting and hoping for an early call to
garrison some of the ports which will
be vacated by the regulars when they
are called to the front. Secretary of
War Alger said this afternoon that the
directions to move all the troops east
of Denver to the Atlantic seaboard
when made would not emanate directly
from Washington, but would be issued
by the departi.ient commanders. If tho
Government - ocides to send troops
from the interior to the seacoast tho
department commanders will be in
structed to forward a certain number,
but will be given full discretion as to
the garrisons from which they will be
detailed. The War Department will
have no advices of orders issued to the
different regiments until the depart
ment commanders make their reports
to Washington detailing the instruc
tions issued from their headquarters.
The revenue cutters, including the
'boats now being completed, are all to
be brought down to tide water as
speedily as possible. Naval officials are
very much pleased with the acquisition
erf the new revenue cutters, as they will
supply a deficiency in torpedo-boat de
stroyers which are needed more than
any other class of vessels at this time.
AH of these vessels are equipped for
torpedo tubes and secondary batteries
of rapid-fire guns, and their speed
ranges from fourteen to twenty knots.
They will be fitted for naval service at
the Norfolk navy yard, where their
armaments are now being sent. They
will be employed at the outset as scout
or picket boats, but in action will turn
their attention to rendering the small
Spanish torpedo boats helpless. The
cuttor McCulloch. now in the vicinity
of Singapore, will be used as a dis
patch boat on the Asiatic station, and
her commanding officer will be directed
to report to Commodore Dewey, now
commanding the naval forces on the
Asiatic station, with headquarters at
Hongkong, where the fleet is assem
bling, presumably for the purpose of
making a demonstration against the
Philippine Islands in case of war.
Viewer] In detail the finding of the
Court of Inquiry was the most vital
feature. Lieutenant-Commander Ma
rix. Judge Advocate of the Court of In
quiry, delivered the report to Secretary
Long early this morning and shortly
afterward it was carried to the White
House and placed in the hands of the
President. At 10:30 the Cabinet as
sembled, half an hour earlier than us
ual, and began consideration of the
momentous document. Even the rigid
rules of secrecy which prevail at Cabi
net meetings were made doubly strict
in this case, and no intimation of the
result reached by the court was known
until 2 o'clock, when a bulletin gave an
information to the country, as well as
to the eagerly waiting officials.
These results briefly stated are that
the loss of the Maine was due to an
explosion from the outside, the court
being unable to fix the responsibility
for the explosion. The court does not
express an opinion as to the character
of the explosion, but the testimony
goes to show that it was a powerful
submarine mine, the exact character of
which is not determined by the testi
mony, though the belief was expressed
that it was a floating submarine mine.
There were two explosions, the court
finds. The first was from the outside
and that set off one of the smaller mag
azines. It was this result, expressed
in detail, and with the precision of a
court deeply cognizant of his respon
sibility, together with the evidence
.upon which it was based, that occu
pied the attention of the Cabinet
throughout its "extended sessions of the
morning and afternoon. All other sub
jects gave way to this foremost ques
tion.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 25.â "Jim" RÂ»a
has made his first play for time in the
suit brought against him by J. P. Jar
man for $50,000 damages on a charge of
slander. On the day the suit was com
menced Rea, in an interview he caused
to be published in the Mercury, his
acknowledged organ, declared he would
make no fight for time, but would
gladly meet the issue at the earliest
day. On that same day he denied that
he had used the alleged slanderous
language, yet in the demurrer filed by
his attorneys to-day, after the full
limit of ten days for such filing had ex
pired, no disavowal of the objectionab'e
words is made. After the usual pre
liminary phraseology the demurrer
states:
That said first pretended cause of action
is uncertain in this, to wit: That it
cannot be ascertained therefrom what
steam-roller is referred to or that the
Eaid Common Council of which plaintiff
was \ member ever purchased a su.nn
rolle>, or that any sum of money was
expended for . a steam-roller by said
Common Council, or that the plaintiff aid
wrong in receiving J'.uo. or that there was
anything wrong in taking or receiving $900
or that plaintiff was damaged in his busi
ness or reputation or office at all.
That there is no averment snowing or
tending to show that plaintiff at the
time of the utterance of the words
charged was a Councilman, or that they
affected plaintiff in his office or personally
or at all; that it cannot be ascertained
therefrom to whom the word "you" re
fers; and, further, the language used
shows that the same was addressed to
the plaintiff personally; that there is no
averment that the language used was not
privileged ana not used on a privileged
occasion.
That said second pretended cause of ac
tion is uncertain in this, to wit: That it
cannot be ascertained therefrom what
steam-roller is referred to, or that the
said Common Council of which plaintiff
was a member ever purchased a steam
roller, or that any sum of money was
paid for a steam-roller by said Common
Council, or that plaintiff did wrong in
receiving $900, or that there was anything
wrong in taking or receiving $900. or that
plaintiff was damaged in his business or
reputation or office, or at all.
That there is no averment showing or
tending to show that plaintiff at the time
of the utterance of the words charged
was a Councilman, or that they affected
plaintiff in his omce, or personally, or at
all; that there is no averment that the
language used was privileged and used
on a privileged occasion.
Wherefore defendant prays that plain
tiff lost nothing by reason or his said
action and that he be hence dismissed,
with his costs of suit.
The most remarkable feature of this
document, as pointed out by one of
plaintiff's attorneys, is the reiterated
averment that there is nothing in the
"pretended cause of action" to show
"that the plaintiff did wrong in receiv
ing $900, or that there was anything
â wrong in taking or receiving J300." In
the cause of action it was alleged that
Rea had charged Jarman with receiv
ing a sum of money, while a Council
man, to bring about the purchase of a
steam roller by the city. Such action
on Jarman's part, if it took place, is
declared by Rea through his attor
neys, not to be wrong.
Rea's attorneys are H. V. Morehouse,
F. J. Hambly and D. W. Burchard. Red.
had also engaged the services of F. E.
Spencer, but this gentleman is pros
trated by a severe illness and is unable
to attend to any business whatever. D.
M. Delmas of San Francisco has been
retained by the plaintiff in addition to
A. H. Jarman and E. A. Wilcox of this
city.
From every appearance this cas?,
when brought to trial, will prove one
of the most bitterly contested and sp?i
sational ever tried in the State. The
demurrer will be argued Monday after
noon before Judge Kittredge.
RUNAWAY ACCIDENT .
AT PACIFIC GROVE.
A Grandniece of General Vallejo
Thrown From a Carriage and
Injured.
MONTEREY. March 25.â Miss Rose Ab
rego. a prominent society young 1 lady of
Monterey, was seriously injured yester
day in a carriage accident and is now en
during great suffering as a consequence.
Miss Abrego and Mrs. F. C. Botch were
driving a pair of pinies on Lighthouse
avenue in Pacific Grove when a horse at
tached to a hay cart became frightened
and dashed into their team before they
could turn out of the way. Some bystand
ers rushed to the rescue and the ladies
got out of the phaeton as .iiiickly as pos-
Blble. Miss Abrego was, however, in her
alarmed state of mind a little too hasty
and in .lumping from the phaeton alight
ed in such a way as to cause a double
fracture of her ankle joint, besides badly
epralnir.g her foot. Her physicians hope
there will be no serious results, but say
an injury of the kind is always an ugly
one to den! with.
Miss Abrego belongs to two of the
prominent old families of this historic
town. She is the granddaughter of the
late Don Jose Abrego, and through her
mother, who was a Leese, is grandriiece
to that celebrated Californian, General
Vallejo.
MONTEREY'S NAVAL RESERVE.
Forty-Seven Youths Have Alreauy
Joined the Battalion.
MONTEREY. March 25.â The Monterey
Naval Reserve Battalion, now being
formed, has already enlisted forty-seven
men and as many more will probably
join. It will act as an independent di
vision of the State Naval Reserve until
next January, when it will bo mustered
Into the Naval Battalion of the National
Guard. Lieutenant Lasher, U. S. N., has
volunteered to drill the boys In naval tac
tics, and Captain M. P. Seeley, U. S. A.,
retired, will attend to their military
training. A number of the leading citi
zens are taking steps to secure a training
ship for the station in Monterey harbor.
It is proposed to allow the Santa , Cruz
division of the Naval Reserve to have
part use of the training ship.
TWO CANADIANS
ARE SLAIN BY AN
ENRAGED MOOSE
Frenchmen in Search of Fresh Meat At
tack a Bull With Knives and Are
Trampled to Death.
BOSTON, March 25.-A story reached here to-day from Sheridan
Plantation, Aromee County, Maine, near the Canada border of the
killing of two Frenchmen. Labonte and Perieux, by an infuriated bull
moose, Ajhich they attacked with camp knives. Labonte. Perieux and
a boy heard the bellowing of a moose, which came tearing through
the brush toward them. He halted within a rod of the camp door
Labonte and Perieux ran into the cabin, armed themselves with long
carving knives and started for the moose in high glee, as they had
been without meat for a fortnight, the animal awaiting their'com
ing Labonte reached him first and thrust the knife at his throat.
The blow was misdirected and Labonte plunged headlong into the
snowdrift, having inflicted but a flesh wound. Labonte s knife slipped
from his grasp, and with a lightning stroke of the bull s front hoofs
Labonte's skull was laid bare and the moose trampled upon him.
Perieux rushed to Labonte's aid and drove his knife into the body of
the bull almost to the hilt. With a sudden spring the moose leaped
on Perieux and threw him into the soft dirt, where he trampled him
to death. The cries of the two men hurried the boy to the scene,
revolver in hand. The moose paused for an instant in pawing his vic
tims, and the frightened boy, after firing one shot ran into the cabin
and barred the door. When the wounded moose had trampled the life
out of the two men he wandered off into the woods and the boy went
to the scene of the slaughter of his companions. Their faces were
stripped bare of flesh, and both skulls fractured by the pounding of
razor-edged hoofs.
LEONARD DIES
BY THE ROPE
Murderer of Old Jacob
Malquist Hanged
at Colfax.
Beat Out the Brains of a Man
Eighty-Five Years of
Age.
One Thousand People Witness the
Avenging of His Awful
Crime.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLFAX, March 25.â The execution
of John Leonard for the murder of Ja
cob Malquist at Texas Ferry occurred
this afternoon in the presence of fully
1000 people. Leonard was brought from
the jail and ascended the scaffold unas
sisted at 1:18 o'clock. Father Kearns.
at the request of Leonard, read a short
final statement, protesting his inno
cence of willful murder. At 1:21 Leon
ard stepped on the trap, shook hands
with the officers and a few others. At
1:24 a vc-iee called out "Good-by, Jack,"
and Leonard responded in clear tones,
"Good-by. Charley." As the last word
left his lips the trap was sprung and
Leonard dropped six feet. The body re
bounded slightly, but not a movement
of the muscles was noticeable. After
the body hung sixteen minutes Leonard
was pronounced dead by the attending
physicians. The body was at once
taken in charge by Father Kearns and
conveyed to the cemetery, where fun
eral exercises were held.
The crime for which John Leonard
suffered the death penalty was com
mitted at Texas Ferry on Snake River,
on July IS. 1896, in the saloon of his vic
tim, Jacob Malquist, a Swede, 85 years
of age. It was shown at the trial that
Leonard beat out Malquisfs brains from
behind, though he claimed that Mal
ouist first drew a revolver on him and
he was compelled in self-defense to
strike his assailant with a club. There
were no- witnesses to the tragedy and
Leonard made his escape, but as soon
as the murder was discovered a posse
was organized and he was captured a
short distance from Texas Ferry. He
admitted the killing, but said it was
done In self-defense.
Leonard was tried, found guilty and
sentenced to be hanged on October 9,
1896. An appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court, but the judgment of the
lower court was affirmed and Leonard
again sentenced to- death on July 2. He
was granted a stay of execution by the
Governor and an appeal to the Su
preme Court was taken. The court
again refused a new trial, and the de
fendant was resentenced to hang on
March 25, 1898.
Leonard was 37 years old, a barber
by trade and served two terms in the
penitentiary at Walla Walla, having
been released from the penitentiary
on the day he killed Malquist. Mal
quist for thirty years was employed on
steamboats in various capacities and
was known to all steamboat men on
the upper Columbia and Snake rivers.
CHANGES IN MONTEREY
BAÂ¥'S CONFORMATION.
Portion of the Harbor Made Deeper
by the Action of the Ocean
Wash.
MONTEREY, March 25.â A recent dis
covery regarding the bay of Monterey is
rather startling and is causing much con
jecture among those who have been in
formed of it. J. W. H. James, the Lon
don civil engineer and railroad expert,
who is here examining Monterey harbor
in the interest of London capitalists, has
found that the ocean wash is throwing
the sand to the northeast side of the bay,
and has so widened and deepened the har
bor that the latest United States Govern
ment maps are entirely Incorrect. This
discovery is corroborated by MontereVs
veteran fisherman, Antonio Pisanni. Pi
sanni alleges that the water at the end
of the old Government mole has deepened
from four to six fathoms In the last twen
ty years and that the beach beyond Del
Monte has widened correspondingly. The
comparatively recent formation of the
sandhills at Seaside, the little town across
the bay from here, is also said to have
been caused by the ocean wash.

unanimously agreed upon a platform
Which was reported to the respective
conventions and adopted. When the
vote adopting the platform was an
nounced in the Populist convention, 18
middle-of-the-road delegates left the
hall.
The platform demands the free and
unrestricted coinage of silver and gold
at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1,
without waiting for the consent of for
eign nations, and is unalterably op-
posed to the financial policy of the
present Republican administration and
especially the avowed attempt to fas
ten the country irrevocably and for
ever to the single gold standard. It
declares for a national money, safe and
sound, issued by the general Govern
ment only, without the intervention of
banks of issue, to be a full legal tender
for all debts, public and private; also
a just, equitable and efficient means
of distribution direct to the people
through the lawful disbursements of
the Government.
It demands that the volume of circu
lating medium be speedily increased to
an amount sufficient to meet the de
mands of the business and population
'jf this country and to restore the Just
level of prices of labor and produc
tion.
The platform favors such legislation
as will prevent for the future the de
monetization of any kind of legal ten
der money by private contract; it de
mands that the Government in pay
ment of its obligations shall use its
option as to the kind of lawful money
in which they are to be paid, and de
nounces the present and preceding ad
ministrations for surrendering this op
tion to the holders of Government ob
ligations. It further demands that
there shall be no further issue of
United States interest-bearing: bonds;
that postal savings banks be estab
lished by the Government; that United
States Senators be elected by direct
vote of the people.
The platform finally demands the in
itiative and referendum system of law
making in its optional form, and con
demns as dangerous and unjust the
surrender in all departments of th*Â»
Government to the influence of trusts,
corporations and aggregations of
wealth generally and the packing of
the courts of the land with corporation
lawyers.
On the taxation of corporation prop
erty, which caused the split in the
Populist convention, the platform
says:
"Inasmuch as railroad and other cor
poration property is not bearing Its
proportion of taxation, we demand that
such property shall bear its just and
equal share of expense of goverm
ment."
SWINDLER JACKSON
IN RIVERSIDE JAIL
Proclaims His Innocence and Says
Alleged Victims Will Regret
His Arrest.
RIVERSIDE, March 25.â Sheriff John
son returned to-day from Denver, having
in charge D. T. Jackson, who, with M.
W. Clay, is accused of having swindled
I. Witherspoon and other mine owners of
this county out of a large sum of money
by falsely representing that he was a
capitalist who wanted to buy mines.
Jackson was arrested at Denver on a
telegram from the Sheriff. He offered no
objection to returning. He is cool and
uncommunicative and says he is not guil
ty, and that those who sent for him will
wish they had not done so before the
matter is settled. When arraigned in
court to-day, he asked one day's time
in which to plead and his examination
will take place to-morrow.
Clay, who was Jackson's partner, has
not been apprehended yet. When last
heard of he was in Kansas City, but the
officers there have not been able to lo
cate him. Clay is wanted very badly by
the victims of the pair, for he is ring
leader. He is believed by officers here to
have gone to Mexico.

SUSPICION
OF MURDER
AT DAWSON
Death of Mrs. Jessen
Was Not Due to
Accident.

Her Husband.
Course of the Bullet Gives the
Lie to the Theory He
Advances.
CRAZY MOTHER'S CRIME.
With a Hatchet a Douglas Island
Woman Fatally Injures Her
Babes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 25.â Dawson advices
received here via Juneau state that the
killing- of Mrs. Jessen at Dawson last
month is an affair that is viewed with
great suspicion by residents there. Ac
cording to the story told by her hus
band, the occurrence was accidental
and was caused by a revolver falling
from a shelf and being discharged by
striking a table, the bullet passing
through the head of Mrs. Jessen. who
was standing close by. It is said, how
ever, that the course of the ball indi
cates that the shot was fired from a
point level with her head, passing from
the back to the front and striking a
mirror before which she was standing,
the points of entrance and exit of the
skull and of striking the glass being so
nearly on a horizontal plane as to pre
clude the possibility of the shot having
been fired from so low a point as a ta
ble top. The matter was being inves
tigated when Mail Carrier Atwa
ter's party left, and the general be
lief existed that Mrs. Jessen was mur
dered.
On Sunday morning the residents of
Douglas Island, near Juneau, were hor
rified to learn that in a fit of insanity-
Mrs. A. Aldrich, residing with her fam
ily near Mexican Mine, had attempted
to take the lives of her four children
by striking them upon the heads with
a hatchet, inflicting wounds which are
expected to prove fatal in the cases of
two or three of them.
Mrs. Aldrich has for six years past
exhibited symptoms of mental aberra
tion, but as there were no apparent
tendencies toward violence it was not
thought necessary to place her under
restraint. The affliction grew, however,
and culminated in the attempt made
upon the lives of her little ones during
the absence of her .husband, who works
in a blacksmith-shop at Mexican Mine.
He was required to work on Sunday,
but left home later than usual. He had
scarcely gone when Mrs. Aldrich went
to the woodshed, obtained a hatchet,
and on returning struck each child sev
eral times on the head. Their little
hands, put up to defend themselves,
Were badly cut, and two of the babes
wre rendered unconscious.
While striking them Mrs. Aldrich ut
tered terrific screams. These, with the
cries of the children, attracted the at
tention of the neighbors some distance
away, who rushed in and disarmed the
crazed mother. Mrs. Aldrich was taken
to Juneau and is now at St. Ann's Hos
pital. The childrenâ the eldest six
years old and the youngest but seven
weeksâ are said to be in a very pre
carious condition.
This case emphasizes Alaska's need
of an asylum for the proper treatment
of insanity cases. The matter is being
agitated at Juneau, and efforts will be
made to have the national Government
provide for this need when new Fed
ral buildings are erected there. There
have been a number of violent cases of
insanity at Juneau during the last
year, several of which have been
brought to the Steilacoom Asylum near
Tacoma. Incidental to this year's rush,
all Alaska towns are considered certain
of having numerous insanity cases to
deal with.
The bark Richard 111, which has been
discharging at Skaguay for three
weeks, started on Sunday for the re
turn trip to the Sound. While her crew
was pulling the anchor aboard Sailor
Joe McDonald, said to be from San
Francisco, fell over her bow. His head
struck the fluke of the anchor as he
went down and he was killed. The
vessel did not stop to recover his body.

PRISONER FOR
HOURS IN THE
PALACE HOTEL
Capitalist Nevills Accused
of Having Held a Man
Captive in His Rooms.
FRESNO, March 25.â John E Azhdarian has brought suit against
Capitalist W. A. Nevills for $25,000 damages for keeping him a prisoner
for two hours n the Palace Hotel in San Francisco last Monday.
The complaint is short and interesting. Azhdarian alleges that on
the 21st day of March, 1898, at the Palace Hotel, in the city and county
of San Francisco, State of California, the defendant imprisoned the
plaintiff and deprived him of his liberty for the space of two hour 3, un
lawfully and by means of force and threats, violence and the use of
deadly Weapons and without any probable cause, against said plaintiff's
will and consent to great damage, to wit: To damage in the sum of $25,
000.
M. H. Azhdarian, Nevills 1 late foreman in this city and a brother of
the plaintiff, had a contract, whereby Nevills was toadvancehim $10,000
to build an opera-house at Jamestown. The capitalist failed to keep
the agreement. M. H. Azhdarian went to San Francisco to see Nevills
and was accompanied by his brother, the plaintiff in this suit. M. H.
Azhdarian was to deliver to Nevills deeds to certain lots in Jamestown
and also a life Insurance policy. Azhdarian went ahead and let the
contract and work on the building went on for two weeks, when
Nevills notified Azhdarian that he would not advance the money.
Nevills' ex-foreman then consulted Attorney George E. Church, and
was advised to make "Nevills a tender of the deeds and the insurance
policy, and it was for that purpose that Azhdarian went to San Fran
cisco, asking his brother to accompany him, probably as a witness.
At 11 o'clock on Monday Nevills sent for M. H. Azhdarian, and John
E. Azhdarian also went up to the room in the Palace Hotel. Accord
ing to the Azhdarians, Detective John Curtin was in the room and Nev
ills very soon became abusive. M. H. Azhdarian claims that Nevills
struck him c-n the head with a poker, inflicting a gash, and also drew
a pistol upon him several times. Curtin, he claims, was egging the
capitalist on, but when the latter would draw his pistol the detective
would step between him and Azhdarian. Azhdarian declares that
Nevills insisted upon him signing a paper, which the ex-foreman re
fused to do. He says he does not know the purport of the documents.
After two hours the Azhdarians were allowed to go their way.
John E. Azhdarian, so far as appears from the story, was merely de
tained, but he wants $25,000 an hour for it. M. H. Azhdarian claims
he was ill at the time and when he returned he had two physicians
examine a gash in his head.
It is reported M. H. Azhdarian also will sue Nevills.

Single Nugget Valued at $9000 Re

Creek.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. Mar. 25.â The steam
ship Pakshan, which arrived from
Skaguay, Alaska, to-day, ha 1 among
her passengers four men direct from
Dawson City. They were J. F. Den
ham of San Francisco, B. Lung of Ta
coma, D. Lasalle of Leadville and C.
A. Goodwin of Los Angeles.
They repor' a stampede for the
American side below American Creek.
This section, they c 1c 1 m. will beat the
Klondike. Pay dirt is more easily di
vided and is shallower. A nine thou
sand dollar nugget hat, been found on
El Dorado Creek, they say. It is esti
mated by them that forty million dol
lars in gold w 11 be brought out this
season. In speaking of the finding of
the nine thousand dollar nugget. Good
win said:
"That sounds like a tall story, I
know, but it is a fact. The nugget has
considerable quartz mixed with it and
is as big as a small pail."
The owner's name, Mr. Goodwin
said, was being kept dark, as he hoped
to get it out intact without paying
royalty on it. Other rich strikes have
been kept secret for a similar reason.
The p*arty left Dawson on February
15. In recounting the events of the
journey Goodwin said that for the first
600 miles the cold was intense and trav
eling extremely difficult. At the con
fluence of the Stewart and Yukon riv
ers they met the northwest mounted
police detachment with 700 pounds oL'
mail.
Goodwin says that at a very conser
vative estimate at least twenty tons
of gold will be brought out in June,
when navigation opens. The country
around Dawson was black with smoke
from fires burning to thaw the frozen
ground. Claims were frequently chang
ing hands. Quite recently the Healy
company had paid "Nigger Jim" $225,
000 for three claims on Bonanza Creek.
Claims on Bear and Dominion creeks,
on the Indian and Klondike rivers, re
spectively, had been sold as high as
$20,000. On Hunker Creek $20,500 had
been paid for a half-interest by a man
named Elliott, and $40,000 for a whole
claim. "Skiff". Mitchell, owner of No.
1 Eldorado, was buying several claims
on Hunker at a high figure when they
left. In Dawson $60 a cord was the
price paid for wood.
Before the party left many reports
were coming in of the richness of Clar
ence Berry's claims on the hillside of
El Dorado. Reports were also being
received every day of rich finds on
American Creek, on the American side.
Rosebud Creek was drawing much at
tention.
None of the party brought out much
actual dust, as drafts could be ob
tained at Dawson for gold at $15 50 an
ounce, and very few would pack dust
under these circumstances.

The second thing to be considered
was the matter of freight classification
and groupings. This was treated in

CINCINNATI, March 25.â A1l over
the Ohio Valley the sun has shone to
day and the sky to-night is clear Â£fnci
the weather mild. As far as terror and
loss of life are concerned, that is all over
in the interior or tributaries of the
Ohio. But want and desolation in tho
track of the storm are sadly manifest.
The greatest damage to homes seems
to have been at Dayton and Zanesville.
In these two places hundreds of fami
lies have been driven from their homes
and made dependent on public charity,
which has been bounteously bestowed.
In Dayton one building association ha*
a mortgage on 200 inundated houses.
Many of the occupants will lose their
homes if not helped. In Zanesville 900
families are being fed by public charity.
The Ohio River is rising at all points

Army Reorganization Bill.
WASHINGTON', March 25.â Chairman
Hull of the Military Affairs Committee
said to The Call correspondent to-night
that other important matters had pre
vented the consideration of the army re
organization bill, but that it would l;a
taken up next week for consideration.
Nature has a large heart, and she endow-:
us bountifully when she launches us on earw.
But many men do not respect her gifts as
they ought to do. They seem to believe that
she will always respond when called on for
great vitality. She cannot. The time comes
when she refuses to be stimulated, and then
the result is shown in a small or weakened
growth of what should be a perfect man.
This abuse of the privileges bestowed often
leads to despair on the part of those who
have been foolish. They fear, their hands
and legs tremble, and the fact is ever present
with them that they are puny. Some have no
hope of recovery, but they can never have
heard of the very great work which "Hudyan"
has dene. It restores all the organs of the
body to a sound and healthy condition and

Slow Progress on the
Naval Appropria
tion Bill.
Carter of Montana Tries in Vain
to Make a Speech Against
the Measure.
Speaker Reed Has Many Encounters
With Filibusters, but Is Up
held by the Majority.
Call Office, Ripgs House,
Washington, March 25.
The stirring scenes of the Fifty-first
Congress, when members of the minor
ity were charging down the aisles pro
testing against the rules of Speaker
Reed, were recalled to-day in the tur
bulent protests made by the minority
against the ruling of the chair during
the consideration of the naval appro
priation bill. The ruling in effect com
pelled members to confine their re
marks, under the iive-minute rule, to
the subject before the House and was
made against Hartman (811. It.) of
Montana, who attempted to make a po
litical speech. The ruling was de
nounced as a usurpation and appeal
after appeal was taken. When all else
failed, every expedient was resorted to
to block progress with the bill. As a
result but lour pages were disposed
of.
Before the bill was taken up for
amendment Foss ili.i "f Illinois, a
member of the Naval Committee, made
a general speech in advocacy of the
policy of building up a strong and
powerful navy. The eyes of the Amer
ican ]â â  . pi . he said, were lixed upon
the American navy, the defender of the
living and guardian of the honor of
the dead. If an emergency was upun
us the American navy was ready to
meet it. With glowing words he paid
an eloquent tribute to me brilliant
achievements of our navy in the Revo
lutionary war, the war of 1812 and the
war of the rebellion, eulogizing the
deeds of John Paul Jones, Decatur,
Perry. Porter, Farragut ;;nd Dupont.
He then described the decay of the
navy after the war and the rebuilding
of t lie new navy, which began under
tarles Chandler and Whitney.
Bartholdt <R.) of Missouri said that
Borne European papers and theirechoes
in this country said that the foreign
born citizens of this country would be
a menace to the United States in case
of war with a foreign country. He re
sented this in the strongest possible
manner. The flag of the United States
â was the flag of its adopted citizens.
Hartman created the diversion which
caiis.'d the blocking of business during
the rest of the day by delivering a five
minute speech, satirizing the Republi
can party, and when, under cover of
a second pro forma amendment, he at
tempted to proceed. Boutelle called him
to order. He made the point that
Hartman's remarks were not pertinent
to the amendment. A lively parlia
mentary wrangle followed, when th
chair sustained a point of order.
After the debate on appeal had ru
on for an hour, Boutelle moved to clos
the debate on th< appeal. Instantly
point of order was made against Bou
telle's motion, which was overrule*
Party feeling ran high. The vote wa
taken on Boutelle's motion to close de
bate on the appeal and carriedâ lll t
The vote then came upon the appeal
from the decision of the chair, and the
chair was sustained â 120 to 92.
Hartman then changed his tactics
and arose to a point of personal privi
lege.
Dingley made the point that no ques
tion of personal privilege could be rais
ed in committee of the whole. Pending
a decision upon Dingley's point of or
der Hartman was allowed to proceed,
but Payne objected, whereupon, with
flushed face, Hartman shouted out that
he would refuse to be intimidated by
the gentleman from Maine.
Thereupon Payne called him to or
der and the chair ordered him to take
hi? seat.
Bailey moved that he be allowed to
"proceed in order." The motion was
opposed by the majority and defeated
â91-110,
The minority then inaugurated a fili
buster, demanding a vote by tellers on
the pro forma amendment to which
llartman had been speaking.
Payne made the point that the de
mand was dilatory, and was sustained.
The chair also sustained a similar point
against an appeal. A moment later,
when another demand was made for
tellers and !t was denied. Bailey de
nounced the ruling. "If you do not per
mit us to verify the count," he de
clared, "you destroy the last safeguard
of the minority. A dishonest man In
the chair, and there have been dishon
est men In the chair, could defeat the
will of this Hnuse. I am frank to say
that my purpose in inaugurating this
filibuster was to consume twice as
much time as you denied the gentleman
from Montana, and I intend to do it
every time you deny a reasonable de
mand." (Democratic applause.)
Denunciatory speeches were made by
McMlilin (D.) of Tennessee and Bland
(D.) of Missouri, and the scenes of ex
citement and confusion were reminis
cent of the sensational days of the
Fifty-first Congress.
The chair finally announced that
he did not desire to deprive any mem
ber of a right honestly demanded. If
the gentleman from Texas would state
that the demand for tellers was made
In good faith he would entertain the
demand.
"I repel as an insult," retorted
Bailey, "that demand from the occu
pant of the chair. The chair has no
right to ask me to disclose my motive,
and you and all the power behind you
cannot compel me to say what my mo
tives are." (Democratic applause.)
Thereupon the chair insisted upon
his ruling, and the reading of the bill
proceeded. At the end of the first para
graph read, Hartman again offered a
pro forma amendment, and after some
prefatory remarks In denunciation of
what he characterized as an attempt
to "throttle free speech," was proceed
ing with the speech he began hours
before, when he was again called to
order.
llartman was requested to take his
Ff-at, while the confusion and parlia
mentary struggle went on. At last
Bailey moved that Hartman be per
mitted to explain. The motion was de
feated by a vote of 10* to 116.
Debate was then closed on the para
graph, and as soon as the next para
graph was read, with a dozen Demo
crats on their feet demanding recogni
tion, the chair recognized Boutelle, who
moved that all debate on the para
graph be closed.
"How can debate be closed before It
is begun?" asked "Williams (D.) of Mis
sissippi, amid laughter.
The turbulent scenes continued the
remainder of the day, the minority re
sisting every step in the progress of
the bill. Only four pages were disposed
of.
After the committee rose Pearson
(R.) of North Carolina denied a charge
made by a North Carolina paper that
he had abused the franking privilege.
At 5:05 the House adjourned.

have read as an ice-free port. He adds:
At the Tsung Li Yamen (Chinese

conditions were agreed upon respecting
the Talien Wan lease. Russia agrees

Senator Perkins asking him to use his
influence with the Governor of Nevada.
Representative Barham will introduce a
bill appropriating 1 $1500 for a cable from

the reservation each summer for several
years. A resolution will be offered i.i

Rainfall.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, March 25.â After a long,
dry, cold spell of three weeks rain be
gan falling at 8 o'clock this morning
and continues with prospects of an all
night storm. The precipitation up to
6 o'clock to-night was about three
quarters of an inch. The downpour will
help this vicinity considerable and aid
in saving an immense amount of grain
which was fast being killed by the
cold and drought. The Santa Lucia
and Gabilan mountains are covered
with snow. Reports received from as
far south as Santa Margarita are to the
effect that the storm is general over
the Salinas Valley. The hopes of the
farmers are raised and all are jubilant
over the relief afforded by the rainfall.
SANTA CRUZ, March 25.â Rain com
menced falling early this morning: and
continued the entire day. It came Just
at the right time and farmers are jubi
lant. The severe north wind of several
days ago had done its harmful work,
but the rain to-day is Just what is
needed for grain and feed.
HANFORD, March 25.â Rain began
falling at 4 o'clock, and a steady light
fall continues.
STOCKTON. March 25.â Rain set in
at 6 o'clock this morning throughout
San Joaquin County and continued up ;
to 10 o'clock, when it ceased, though
there are prospects of continued show- j
ers. The rainfall varied from a drizzle !
to a quarter of an inch. In Stockton .16 ]
of an inch fell. Telephone messages j
this morning from various points in i
San Joaquin County and vicinity mdi- j
cate that there is no question that
apricots, almonds and other early fruit
were almost totally destroyed by the j
frost. Vegetables have been set back j
somewhat, but not badly damaged, and
the prospects are that with a couple
more showers the grain yield will be j
large. j
SAN JOSE, March 25.â 1t commenced i
raining here about 6 o'clock this morn
ing and up to noon one-third erf an
Inch had fallen. The downpour is wel
comed with great Joy by the farmers,
the high winds of the past few days
having dried out the ground to such an
extent that irrigation would soon be
necessary. The prospects for a heavy
and continued downpour are bright.
The frosts of the last few days about
ruined apricots in this county. Apri
cota turned black and are a total loss.
One man with seventy-five acres of
fruit offered to sell his crop for $10.
Grain in Ignacio Valley will be de- j
stroyed unless there is rain soon. The
crops in the San Ramon hills are look- !
ing good, but about Brentwood farmers
have given up hope.
WATSONVILLE, March 25.â 1t com
menced raining here this morning and
there was a heavy downpour all day,
with indications of more to-night. This
will enable many to plant beets.
The rain comes in very good time, as
stock was suffering from continual
frosts and dry weather.
CARSON. March 25.â Snowstorms
prevail throughout the western portion
of the State. It is hoped they will con
tinue long enough to stock the moun
tains well with snow and avert a
drought next summer, which has
seemed inevitable for the past month
or so. There have been few 'storms
during the winter, and farmers in the
valleys, especially Mason Valley, one of
the most important agricultural re
gions of the State, have hesitated about
seeding ground for next season. April
snow melts rapidly and does not pack
on the mountains, and Nevada may ex
perience a pronounced drought.
VISALIA, March 25.â Rain com
menced falling this afternoon and will
probably continue all night. The fall
up to 6 o'clock was .20 of an inch. The
rain will save late-sown grain. It Is
reported from the Visalia Fruit and
Land Company's orchard north of here
that the entire crop of the 440-acre or
chard was destroyed by the recent
frosts.
FRESNO, March 25. â Welcome rain
fell at 2 o'clock this afternoon. There is
still hope of a good grain crop In this
county if enough late rain falls. The
precipitation changed from heavy
showers to a drizzling downfall. Up
to 5 o'clock .15 of an inch fell, which is
a good precipitation for three hours at
this time of the year. Reports received
from different parts of the county are
all to the effect that grain has not yet
suffered, but rain is necessary within a
few days at the longest, and the sooner
the better. The winter-sown grain is
three or four inches above the ground,
while summer fallow wheat is still
higher. Heavy winds last week dried
the ground, and had the rain not fallen
to-day the grain would begin to show
the effects of the wind and drought
soon. The prospects for showers
through the night are very good.
TULARE, March 25. â Rain has fallen
here steadily since 2 o'clock this after
noon. Indications are favorable f<>r a
continuation of the storm. It will save
some grain and produce abundant feed
for stock. The outlook is much Im
proved.
SANTA BARBARA, March 25.â Rain
began falling here at 7 p. m. and indi
cations point to the heaviest precipita
tion of the season. A good rain now
will insure a fair hay crop. Hay Is
quoted here at $20 a ton. Dealers are
talking of shipping hay from Oregon.

NO TRACE OF
THE OUTLAWS
Futile Search for the
Cross Creek Train-
Robbers.
Officers Beat the Kings River
Swamps in a Vain
Quest.
With Their First Theories Exploded
the Men of the Law ArÂ«
al Sea.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, March 25.â Officers who
have been hunting for the Cross Creek
bandits since the morning following the
hold-up are now completely at sea.
This evening they gave up the hunt
and returned to Visalia, where they
held a long consultation in the Sheriff's
office. Yesterday they were confident
they could catch the robbers in a few
days, as they had tracked them as far
as Klngburg, and were satisfied that
the outlaws had taken refuge in the
swamps along Kings River, where they
would ultimately be beaten out of their
hiding places.
To-day, however, the bandit hunters
searched the swamps, but could find no
trace nor the slightest clew to indicate
that the men were there or even had
sought a hiding place in that vicinity.
The officers who were beating through
the swamp to-day were Detectives
Mead and Hume, Sheriff Van Buckner
of Kings County and Deputy Ayres and
Sheriff Merritt of Tulare County. It is
stated that they were completely at
sea. They found nothing to confirm
their suspicions as to the robbers'
whereabouts. Yesterday Sheriff Rob
erts was confident he knew where at
least one of the robbers was, but to
day's futile search caused him to doubt
whether he was right in his first con
jecture.
The officers think that the robbers
might possibly still be hiding in the
swamps and will more thoroughly
search that section before entirely
abandoning their theory, but their
hopes now are faint.
Absolutely no news has been received
here about'the robbers. Deputy Sher
iff Timmins and Deputy Constable
Henry started in a carriage yesterday
afternoon, but did not say where they
were headed for. It is believed they
went to the voodchoppers 1 camp on
Kings River. Nothing has been heard
of them Blnce, and it is not known when
they will return.
Some of the officers believe that the
robbers are now walking the streets of
Fresno, but it is hardly thought possi
ble that they could have driven to the
city after the hold-up without being
seen. They are known to have -one as
far as Kiiigsburg. and from there the
officers thought they had traced them
into the swamps, but now It seems that
they did not go into the swamps after
all.
Detective Humo is said to have ex
pressed the opinion that there were at
least five men in the job.
WANTED FOR BURGLARY
AT BELLA VISTA.
Capture at Salinas of an Accused
Man Who "Jumped" His
Bail.
REDDTNG.Mnreh 2.Vâ A short time ago
Robert Raper, son of Thomas Raper, a
prominent farmer of the East Side, was
arrested on a charge of burglary pre
ferred by Mrs. Victoria Browning, a well
to-do widow. Raper was released under a
$300 bond. His examination was set for
March 17, at Bella Vista, but he disap
peared on the 14th. and could not be found
on the day of his trial. His bail was de
clared forfeited.
Raper was subsequently located at the
home of his brother, near Salinas, and on
the 2oth inst. was arrested by the Sheriff
of San Benito County. Deputy Constable
Parker was detailed Ui bring the prisoner
back, and arrived this morning with Ra
per in charge.
The prisoner denies that he is the man
wanted, and asserts that his name is
Charles R. Draper. He declares that he
was not implicated in any crime at or
near Bella Vista. He was taken to Bella
Vista this afternoon to appear before
Judge Ferguson.

HOPKINS TOOK
HIS OWN LIFE
Sudden Death of the
Philadelphia Banker
Explained.
He Had Loaned Over $600,000
to One Man on Worthless
Security.
Following This Disclosure the Insti
tution of Which He Was Cash
ier Suspended.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, March 25.â The
sudden death yesterday of John S.
Hopkins, cashier of the People's Bank,
and the assignment made last night
by the Guarantors' Finance Company,
were followed to-day by disclosures
which showed an important connection
between the events.
The Coroner's investigation this aft
ernoon developed the fact hitherto con
cealed by the family that Hopkins had
committed suicide by shooting, and an
examination of the affairs of the Peo
ple's Bank by its officers resulted in
the revelation that Hopkins had during
the past two years loaned the bank's
funds in large amounts to Richard F.
Loper, general manager of the Guaran
tors' Finance Company. These loans,
which remain unpaid and aggregate, it
is said, over $600,000, were made wholly
without the knowledge of the officers
and directors of the bank.
The securities given by Loper as col
lateral for the loans were found, ac
cording to the statement of one of the
bank's officials, to have very little
value. In consequence of these rela
tions the bank closed its doors to-day
indefinitely.
The State Insurance Commissioner on
Wednesday asked the court to appoint
a receiver for the Guarantors' Compa
ny, which did an insurance business,
and it is believed that Hopkins, on
learning that the company could not
make good its indebtedness to the bank
and knowing that exposure would fol
low an investigation of the Guarantors'
affairs, concluded to end his troubles by
taking his life.
It is the general belief in financial
circles that the People's Bank will pay
dollar for dollar to its creditors. Presi
dent McManes is reputed to be worth
at least $10,000,000, and he is credited
with the statement that he would see
that no creditor of the bank lost a cent.
The directors are: James G. Wells.
Clay Kemble, Allen B. Roorke and
John Wiseman. The bank was incor
porated in 1870 under the State laws,
and for years was known as the "Po
litical Bank." because it attended to
the financial transactions of nearly
every city or State politician of note.
United States Senator Quay has had
extensive dealings with the bank, but
a telegram received to-day from Mr.
Quay stated that he was not affected
in any way by the failure.
The bank has a capital stock of $1,500,
000 and is an official depository for the
city and State. The active deposit of
the State's fund is $505,000. and of the
State sinking fund there is on deposit
about $250,000. City Treasurer Michael
says there Is $25,000 of city money on
deposit, this being about 13 per cent of
the deposit to which the bank is en
titled by law.
WILL ASSIST
THE LADIES
Representative Gentlemen of
St. Patrick's Parish
Meet.
Formed Themselves Into a Picnic
Committee to Financially Aid the
Proposed Bazaar.
About 500 representative gentlemen of
St. Patrick's parish met last evening in
the sodality hall of the church to devise
ways and means for carrying the pro
posed bazaar to a successful issue. This
is the first time the men have interested
themselves in any undertaking for the |
benefit of the church, and in the natural
course of events it seemed rather strange
to the large number of male church
goers present.
After considerable debate it was decided,
that a picnic would be as profitable a line
Of business as could be entered into and .
in consequence the gathering organized
itself into a picnic committee and
over 3000 tickets were distributed among
the members for sale. Father Brennan
addressed the meeting, T. L. Dorrin was
appointed chairman and Joseph F.
O'Brien secretary. Suggestions from
those present were freely given, and at
times the debate among the members be
came rather personal and in the end some
left the hall without tickets and stated
that they would not in any way assist
in the work which had been decided upon.
The picnic will be given at El Oampo on
May 21, and as the parish is a large one it
i.s presumed a large amount will be col
lected with which to help the bazaar.
The men have taken the matter in their
own hands. Father Brennan aroused
some feeling during his address by stat
ing that he was opposed to a mannish
or new woman, but that he was bitterly
opposed to a womanish man. He also
stated that the men had not heretofore
taken sufficient interest in the workings
of the church. The meeting adjourned at
the call of the chair.

ATTACKED BY
TWO ROBBERS
Thrilling Experience of
Banker Beekman of
Sacramento.
Badly Injured While Resisting
an Assault by High
waymen.
Sudden Leap of His Horse Overtu
His Carriage, but He Drives
Away the Thugs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 25â William
Beekman, the Sacramento banker, was
attacked by highwaymen last night just
this side of the town of Auburn, and
while resisting he was thrown from his
vehicle and severely, but not dangerously,
injured.
There Is a dark ravine just this side of
Auburn, and as Mr. Beekman was pass
ing through it very slowly a highwayman
sprang from the side of the road and
seized the bridle of his horse. At the
same instant another robber approached
him from behind, and, reaching over the
wheel of the carriage, made a grab for
Mr. Beckman's watch chain. The banker
quickly placed one hand over his waten.
and with the other hand struck the horse,
a blow with the whip. The horso gave
a lunge, but, being still held by the bit,
turned the buggy so as to cramp it in
such a way that Mr. Beekman was
pitched headlong to one side of the road.
As Beekman fell ho shouted that he
would kill the first man that moved, and
by the time he was able to regain his
feet his assailants had disappeared in
the brush which lines the road.
Beekman made his way to a farm house,
where his wounds, which consisted of a
contusion over the right eye, and three
broken ribs, were dressed. Subsequently
he was taken to Auburn and thence to
this city, arriving this morning. The at
tending physician pronounces the wounds
by no means dangerous, and as Beekman
Is a man of wonderful physique, and In
the best of health, he will be out in a
few days.
He is the second director of the People's
Bank attacked by robbers this week, Mr.
Croly being the first. The condition of

A BOBBER FOUND GUILTY.
W. J. Clarke Convicted in Judge
Dunne's Court for Robbing an
Intoxicated Man.
After deliberating forty-five minutes,
the jury in the case of W. J. Clarke,
charged with robbing William Pettit on
New Year's morning, found the prisoner
guilty, and he will be sentenced by Judge
Dunne on April 9.
J. N. E. Wilson fought hard to acquit
his client of cnarg-e, as the fate of
Badgeley and Ely, men implicated In the
robbery, was in the balance.
Pettit arrived in town from Fort Point
with $20 in his pocket, and began to cele
brate the incoming year. He started at
1-ourth and Market streets, and tried the
liquids in all the saloons on that street
until he met Clarke. He was then in a
loquacious mood, and made friends with
the prisoner. In corrpany with him and
with Ely and Badgely he walked uown
Stevenson street. He was struck over the
head, thrown to the ground and his
pockets rifted. Michael Rabbit, a paper
hanger, siiw the roboery, and went up to
assist the faJlen man, when the prisoners
ran away.
After being told by Pettit to get out, he
walked up the street and informed Of
ficers Naylor and Clark. Accompanied
by them, he made the rounds of the dif
ferent saloons, and at last found Clarke
in the Alliance saloon. Six weeks after
ward. Ely, who is a pugilist, and Badgely
were arrested, and are now awaiting trial
on the same charge.
Assistant District Attorney Arthur
Brandt made out a strong case against
Clarke, and from the evidence he aduueed
during the trial it looks bad for the omer
prisoners.
Scholars Debate.
A very Interesting debate took place at
the Humboldt Evening High School last
evening between the pupils of the Senior
High School class and the pupils of the
Junior High School class. The subject
was: "Resolved, That San Francisco
should own and control its water supply
system." The debate was won by the
Junior class. The speakers were: In the
affirmative. C. H. Hincken, G. C. Bennal
lack and C. S. Allison. For the negative,
C. C. Sullivan, J. S. Gaffney and T.
O'Connor.
Seeking a Lost Son.
Chief Lees has received a letter from
Mrs. E. A. Morrison of Butte City, Mont.,
asking him to find her son Jay Morrison,
who ran away from home on January 20
and came to this city. He is 14 years of
age, but looks oiuer, has dark complexion,
brown hair, blue eyes, large features and
has a scar on his forehead between the
eyes.

STRIVING FOR
KASSON'S GOLD
Conflicting Stories Told
by Claimants to the
Estate.
Aged Witnesses Give Evidence
of a Memory That Is
Remarkable.
Hopes of the Contestants Are Blasted
by the Statements of Mrs.
Malluy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. March 25.â 1t is doubt
ful If there has been another legal con
test waged in this State that has de
veloped as many surprises and dramat
ic incidents as has the Kasson estate
case, now occupying the attention ot
Judge Jones, and in which a dozen
prominent attorneys have been en
gaged for more than a week. It is re
markable in many ways. The wit
nesses, though seemingly truthful and
sincere, have shown memories that an
most unusual, and evidence given by
them have made up stories that are so
strangely contradictory as to make thÂ«Â»
whole affair appear more like an ex
travagant romance than a collection of
queer facts.
The hopes of the contestants were
destroyed when Mrs. Malloy told her
story. She declared she was at one time
the wife of George M. Kasson, had
lived with him during the years these
two children were said to have been
born, and that she had never given
birth to a child by Kaspon. She Is a
woman of 74 years, and she has aston
ished everybody by the remarkably
clear manner in which she recounted
all the principal events of her long life.
She was questioned under cross-exam
ination to-day for several hours, but in
spite of the efforts of the attorneys
who represent the other side to shake
her evidence, they have not as yet
snapped a single thread in the chain
of her story.
The most important testimony In the
case to-day was that of Mrs. Sarah E.
Millekin, a cousin of George W, Lindy
a claimant in the case, and the puta
tive son of Thomas Lindy. Mrs. Mille
kin swore that she frequently saw
Lindy at the breast of his mother, Mrs.
Lindy.
A dramatic incident was the identifi
cation by Thomas Wilson, 83 years of
age, of the family record in the Lindy
Bible. He had written the record fifty
one years ago. He identified the hand
writing as his own, but could not re
member having written it, though that
fact had already been developed by
Lindy's testimony. He was present at
the marriage of the Lindys and the
Kassons. and knew all about the fam
ily affairs. His testimony was very un
favorable to the Lindy claimants.
SPOKE ON DOMESTIC RELIGION.

; Rabbi Voorsanger addressed a large con
; gregatton on "Domestic Religion, or the

unsatisfied from their own views. "V\'<;

fl GOOD SELECTION.
GOVERNOR BUDD being a Democrat, we
could not expect him to appoint a Republi
can to the office of Registrar, and since a
Democrat was to be selected the appointment of ex-
Senator Biggy will be received with approval. The
great mass of citizens whose commendation is worth
having will cordially indorse the selection of the Gov
ernor, and the* general sentiment of the people will be
one of satisfaction and gratification.
The office is one of the most important in our
local government. The duties imposed upon the
Registrar and the trust reposed in him are so great
as to render it imperative that the work should be in
the hands of a man of unassailable integrity and un
wavering honesty and fairness. With a corrupt man,
or even an extreme partisan, in the office it would be
possible for gross offenses to be committed in every
election with comparative impunity, and therefore the
need of a firm, faithful and impartial man in the po
sition is recognized as essential to the right admin
istration of our electoral system.
Mr. Biggy possesses every qualification for the
office. He is an experienced man of business and has
an executive ability of a high order. He has been
tested in office and has shown himself superior to
the dictations of bosses and the temptations of
boodlers. Both in public and in pri%'ate life he has
won the confidence of his fellow citizens by the hon
orable performance of every duty and the faithful ful
fillment of every trust.
Governor Budd is to be congratulated upon hav
ing found so excellent a successor to Registrar Hin
ton, and the public will regard the appointment as
one of the successes of the administration. It assures
us an honest and efficient management of an office of
the highest importance, and it is safe to say that in
the work now before him Mr. Biggy will give new
evidences of his fitness for public service and add to
the esteem in which he is held.
ThjE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS.
AMPLE evidence has been given that the peo
ple of California will have to fight over again
the battle against the school book ring which
resulted in the establishment of a system of State
school books. In ways more or less direct the ad
vocates of abolishing the State system and returning
to that which prevailed in times past have given signs
of an intention to force the fight. The issue will
have to be met and it is important that the people
should prepare for it.
It may be conceded at the outset that the State
system of school books is not wholly satisfactory.
No system of books could be. Almost every teacher
*has his own idea of what should be taught in the
schools and how the teaching should be done. The
book that would appear perfection itself to one would
appear an absurdity to another. Each teacher, there
fore, would like to have the selection of the text
books out of which his pupils are to learn what he
has to teach, and such a right of selection might be
good if it were not for the fact that school books cost
money and few parents are able to change them every
time a teacher is changed.
As a matter of fact the better part of all teaching
comes from the teacher and not from the book. Under
the instruction of a competent master a child could
learn to spell just as well out of the Webster spell
ing book of fifty years ago as out of the most im
proved spelling made easy that has since been put on
the market. For that reason the purchase of school
books is one of the departments of public education
in which economy can be well practiced as a matter
of the highest importance. It is not necessary to
have a new set of text books in primary education
every time a new fad in teaching sweeps across the
country.
It is much easier to see the evils of the system we
have than that of a system we have not. Before we
become so impatient of the State system, however, as
to return to the former method we should recall the
fact that experience with the old system was the
cause of the establishment of the present one. In
States where there are no State school books the
dissatisfaction is as great as it is here, and with much
better cause. The school book ring of the East is one
of the giant evils of the republic. It is a corrupting
force in politics and in the schools of the first mag
nitude. We are fortunate to be rid of it, and will
rue the day if for slight discontents we abolish our
State system and return to the domination of the ring.
When robbery of an express car is committed
the public is left to guess what the value of the booty
is, and while its conjectures may be wild, it is never
deluded into the belief that the sole loss consisted of
a bundle of twine and the express messenger's lunch.
The waher who is in charge of the police because
he refuses to support his family ought to find in the
circumstance a tip of considerable value.
THE WATER FRONT SCANDfIU
WE present to-day, in summary form, the water
front scandal, for which there is somewhere
serious and perhaps penal responsibility.
For years the administration of the harbor by Com
missioners has furnished scandals and been charac
terized by corruptions of the most serious nature.
Members of the commission have, indeed, suffered
penal consequences, as have their agents and em
ployes.
With such a record one would suppose that the
Board of Harbor Commissioners would be admon
ished that the property and the revenues under their
control present such favorable opportunities for in
direction and dishonesty that they would be moved to
the greatest care and would never surrender those
scruples that are an ever present element in the hon
est exercise of their authority. There are before them
the honorable examples of Commissioners like Irwin
and McCoppin; whose highly scrupulous and intelli
gent management of the water front added honors to
those which they wore so worthily before they en
tered upon these duties.
After reading the record which we publish to-day
we think that no one will conclude that the members
of the commission who are responsible for the loot
ing of the appropriation for fhe ferry building or
those who have constituted that body for the last
few years have found leisure to bask in the light of
these illustrious predecessors in the same office. In
deed it would seem that basking in any kind of light
is not their favorite form of repose.
They have succeeded in erecting a ferry building
so thickly veneered with frauds that if they were
â¢risible in concrete form the building would be written
all over with them as thickly as the words "one dol
lar" on an old Indiana red dog bank note.
If any part of it ha? been spared, from the vent
hole of a pipe to the time ball above the tower, it
should be recorded and a tablet set to commemorate
the oversight. So open and patent is it all that the
sewer openings on the front smell like cologne in
comparison, and the teredoes and limnoria take sec
ond place as ravagers of the State's property. It is
no pleasure for us to point these things out nor to
expose the misfeasance of any one in office. But the
duty of exposure is accepted as inexorable and per
formed with regret. The further pursuit of the mat
ter lies with those who are charged with the penal
purging of high places to cleanse them of corrup
tion. If these things go on the face of the tower
clock will blush so that it will need no illumination
at night, and its hands will be the only ones around
the building that have not been held behind the back.
THE PRIMARY LAW DECISION.
THE decision of the Supreme Court declaring
the Stratton primary election law to be unconsti
tutional will occasion little or no regret among
non-political citizens. The experiment established by
the statute was one which the practical politicians were
quite anxious to try, but there was no popular de
sire for government primaries nor general opinion
that through them- the people would be enabled to
secure better government. Indeed, on the contrary,
there is every reason to believe that the Stratton law
was a device of the political bosses to check the
operation of the official ballot act and by strengthen
ing party organizations restore the old system of cut
and-dried tickets which the people may either vote
or not vote at all.
We are among those who believe in party respon
sibility and party government. We think that after
the Australian ballot has run its course and the un
thinking multitude has had ample opportunity to de
monstrate that in electing "good fellows" to office
they are mostly successful in selecting incompetent
officials there will be a return to the old method of
embodying political conventions and conferring upon
them the power to nominate party tickets and for
mulate party politics. Some of the best government
the State and city have ever had has been produced by
party responsibility. In fact, until the political boss
appeared upon the scene with his following of plug
uglies and criminals party government was a success.
Until this malignant individual has been disposed of
we think no device for strengthening the political
machine should be encouraged.
At present the system of independent voting es
tablished by the Australian ballot is rapidly retiring
the corrupt political bosses from view. People no
longer regard party labels nor party machines. A
nomination by a political convention has no greater
significance than that a body of citizens calling
themselves Democrats, Republicans, Taxpayers or
something else have indorsed the aspirant for poli
cal favors for an office. The moment the course of
events demonstrates that such an indorsement mean's
nothing more than this, that moment politics will be
come a science of vote-getting and the present science
of stuffing primaries and packing conventions will be
abolished.
At some time, perhaps, the Stratton primary law â
clumsy and impracticable though it was â might be
considered a step in the right direction. Its purpose
was to dignify parties and strengthen their indorse
ments. But the day has not yet arrived for the en
forcement of such a law. Had the Supreme Court
declared the statute valid there is no doubt that it
would have damaged party organization. There
would have been an unseemly struggle by the bosses
to get control of the Republican and Democratic ma
chines of this city, a loud protest on the part of the
press and the people and the entire theory of the
law would have been discredited. The evils certain
to flow from the independent system of voting now
in vogue have not become sufficiently conspicuous to
justify such a statute. When that time comes it will
be in order to inaugurate a government primary
system.
In the meantime it is well that Senator Stratton
cultivates a feeling of hostility to the constitution and
writes legislative bills with skyrocket sticks. Were
he once to read the organic law we might have elec
toral reform forced upon us long before it is due.
Before an alliance between England and the United
States can assume any more definite form than that
expressed in casual observation, it will be necessary
for the mother country to make that overgrown kid
of hers up in the Northwest behave.
The proposition to give Patrol Driver Cashel a po
sition on the police force is a good one. There is not
only reason to believe he would be a faithful officer,
but he might serve as an example to other officers too
prone to $print.
In papers published yesterday afternoon the find
ings of the Maine Board of Inquiry were announced
for probably the tenth time. When the findings have
been revealed they will be announced some more.
Perhaps Spain's boast of being prepared for war
means that she has a lot of white flags ready to run
up at short notice.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1898.
' VAIN TRICKS IN HAWAII.
AFTER the frank exposition of the Dole idea
of government in his organ, the Advertiser,
one is prepared to properly weigh and meas
ure the propositions coming from Hawaii and in
tended to affect annexation. There is pending in the
Legislature at Honolulu a measure affecting contract
labor. This has been urged by Dole's representatives
at Washington as a proposition to abolish such labor
and is used as an argument for annexation. An ex
amination of the proposed bill shows that it does not
abolish contract labor at all. It merely abolishes the
penal clause in labor contracts. The contract labor
law of the United States, passed in 1864, had no penal
clause. Its liens were not upon the person, but upon
the property of the contract laborer. That law (see
Brightly's Digest, vol. 2, 1857-65, page 148) pro
vided: "Section 2 â All contracts that shall be made
by emigants to the United States in foreign* coun
tries in conformity to regulations that may be estab
lished by the Commissioner of Immigration, whereby
emigrants shall pledge the wages of their labor for
a term not exceeding twelve months to repay the
expense of their emigration, shallbe held valid in law
and may be enforced in the courts of the United
States, of of the several States and Territories; and
such advances, if so stipulated in the contract, and
the contract be recorded in the Recorder's office
where the emigrant shall settle, shall operate as a
lien upon any land thereafter acquired by the emi
grant, whether under the homestead law when the
title is consummated or on property otherwise ac
quired, until liquidated by the emigrant."
That was our contract law which became so offen
sive that it was repealed upon the demand of our
labor organizations. It made the contract a first
lien upon the laborer's wages for twelve months, and
upon his real property forever until liquidated. The
difference between this and the Hawaiian contract
labor is that the latter instead has a penal clause
enforceable against the person instead of the prop
erty of the contract laborer. The withdrawal of this
penal clause leaves the statute ju?t as offensive as our
own and with every feature which made it so ob
noxious that no one dared resist its utter repeal.
Again, the repeal of this penal clause has not
passed. It is proposed as a blind by the crafty island
politicians, who brazenly quote what we all understand
to be the odium of our politics as the avowed rule
of action in theirs.
If the penal clause in their labor contract law is
wrong, it is wrong regardless of its effect upon the
fortunes of annexation. -If it is right, its rightfulness
is not measurable by its relation to annexation. The
men who now parade as a virtue the proposition for
its repeal have had the power to abolish it ever since
1893, but they have let it stand and have taken the
benefit of it.
If our Congress defeat annexation this penal clause
will not be repealed. The MacchiavelHs of the oli
garchy will reveal their true character by continuing
and enforcing it.
These things teach and exhort. They illuminate
Dole's remark that "we expect the United States will
give us special laws by which we can get labor." If
annexed they expect to exert their peculiar craft in
violation of our labor laws or in getting special and
unequal privileges.
Existing conditions on the islands expose the
hypocrisy of holding out hope to white labor of an
outlet there. The highest wagfcs paid to field hands
are $12 50 per month, and it is proposed to reduce
this to $10. The Portuguese are disquieted by this,
for they and many of tTie natives are now on the
verge of starvation for the first time in the history of
the country. Dole's government is the author of
these distresses, and the signs of disintegration
among its supporter^ are on the increase. The sham
republic will totter and fall, to be replaced by a real
republic in which the people will have a voice and
the power to protect themselves against starvation
by the use of the ballot.
WARNINGS TO KLONDIKERS.
WRECK after wreck has occurred to give warn
ing to the adventurous that if they expect to
reach the Alaskan ports in safety they must
exercise more than ordinary care in the selection of
the ship on which they are to make the passage. The
rush to the northern gold fields has been so large
that the demand for transportation has led the un
scrupulous to press almost any kind of old hulk intp
service to carry passengers, and there is danger
ahead for all who take ship without close scrutiny
into the nature of the craft they are to embark upon.
While the men who outfit the coffin ships for pas
senger service are to be condemned for the offense,
those who engage passage on them, are not wholly
free from blame. There is no law to prevent such
ships from plying in the coast trade, but a man who
exercises reasonable care can easily find out whether
any ship starting from this port is of that character.
There are abundant sources of information ready at
h?nd for all who have sense enough to make in
quiries, and those who neglect to seek information of
such vital importance are themselves to a large extent
responsible for whatever may befall them on the
voyage.
In one respect the most important lesson taught
by the wreck of the Almy is that of individual re
sponsibility in matters of this kind. It is most
important because it is the one which is
most timely. It will require a long period
of time to procure from Congress the legis
lation necessary to prevent the outfitting of
coffin ships, but the importance of personal care can
be learned and practiced at once. The men and
women who are going north should begin at once to
rely upon themselves to guard against the dangers
of the venture in which they are going to embark.
The leap begins when they take ship, and they must
look before they take it.
Great as is the rush for Alaska, there is no reason
why any one starting from San Francisco need take
any risk with coffin ships. The coast transportation
facilities of the city are large and are being rapidly
increased. There is every reason to believe that by
the time the Yukon opens for navigation the means
of transportation will be ample for the demand, and
the season when the river will be open is now so near
that persons desiring to reach Dawson will be able
to make the trip just about as quickly by waiting for
the river steamers as by going over the passes and
making a long journey by the lakes.
The moral of the situation is plain. The Alaskan
movement is an adventure where prudence is the
better part of valor. The wary will go in safety
where thoff; of reckless daring will rush upon dis
aster. In due time the outfitting of coffin ships will
be made a penal offense, but for the present those
who go north must rely upon their own brains and
look cut for themselves.
Senator Stewart might be in better business than
attempting to haul chestnuts out of the fire for Hun
tington, but he would not be apt to be.

schooner Water Witch, and as is custom
ary- at these sessions of the old tars, there
was much discussion upon the leading
topics of the day. In consequence, the
patriotism of the gathering led to the in
terchange of opinions as to what was the
cause of the Maine disaster. During the
conversation one of those present inti
mated that he would like to be a diver,
declaring that it was a soft thing with
plenty of money for easy work. This
brought forth a few words from Captain
Bogus, a learned and practical seaman,
who, to illustrate that the lot of a diver
is not a happy one, said:
"The average person who glances over
the accounts of the investigation of the
Maine disaster probably thinks little or
nothing of the divers engaged in this
work. He does not know of the dangers
to which these men are constantly ex
posed, even, in the calmest waters. There
is no work which requires such a strong,
vigorous constitution as is necessary to
the diver. Not only must his muscles be
like iron, but his heart and lungs must be
in faultless condition or he will be unable
to stand the strain of living for even a
few moments in deep water. The diver
carries with him on every trip eighty
pounds at least. The suit he wears is
heavy and oppressive. The boots alone,
made of thick lr-ather, with leaden soles,
weigh twenty pounds each and the hel
met, with its Ingenious arrangement of
air pipes and valves, adds forty pounds."
Captain Bogus is a man who knows
what he talks about, so it did not take
him long to change the mind of the
would-be diver, who frankly admitted
that perhaps the diver did not have such
a snap after all.

THE CALL ON COLNON.
Eureka Standard.
The State Harbor Commissioners and
Mr. Colnon, the particular, bright and
shining light who reflects his effulgence
from the pages of the StocKton Mail,
receive a most genuine roasting in The
Call of March 16. Leaving the harbor
piling contract, over which the Mail be
came bo abusive some weeks ago, Tna
Call has been Investigating tne construc
tion of the new ferry depot at the foot of
Market street. It is shown that -n many
instances the specifications have been
changed and that at each change tne con
tractor makes a lot of money by P utl '"B
in cheaper material. The contract for tha
galvanized iron called for No. 22 iron, and.
by consent of the Commissioners No. 2tÂ»
iron waa used, saving the contractor over
$2<>oo2 < >00 The Call also asserts that the Com
missioners paid this contractor about fcOua
for covering certain walls with iron,
which he had agreed to do In his original
contract. __
The same crooked work is done, so Tna
Call avers, all along the line. The steel
work is not up to contract; the brickwork,
which the contract says- should be of Ro
man pressed brick, is done in common

eting money at the expense of the people.
If this be trueâ and The Call would
scarcely dare make such specific charges
unless they are trueâ Brother Colncn of
the Mall will need to use more fairness,
more explanations and more argument
than his former reply to the Standard
contained to convince the people of this
State that they are getting a square deal
at the hands of > udd's Harbor Commis
sioners. It will be well for this bellicosa
official to use his pencil to explain tha
reason for the failure of the commission
to hold its contractors to their contracts
and not allow money to be drawn from
the pockets of the people to fatten tho
bank accounts of those who contracted
to do the work. The ferry depot will cost
far more than it should, and as it is done
by the State the people of the whole State
have an interest in seeing that jobbery'
and corruption shall not run rampant
through all departments of its construc
tion. Will President Colnon rise and ex

They Told the Same Gauzy Tales as
Did Those Refused a Landing
by Commissioner North.
Commissioner of Immigration North
has completed his examination of the
sixty Japanse laborers who arrived by
the steamer Puebla from Victoria and
found that each of them held a certifi
cate from the United States Immigra
tion Commissioner at Victoria entitling
them to land. This left Commissioner
North and the special board of Inquiry
nothing to do, the certificates being
regular and the Japanese having been
admitted to land even before they ar
rived at this port.
The new immigrants were of a worse
character <han the batch of thirty
three who were refused a landing the
ether day by the Commissioner and
who are now quartered on the Uelgic,
pending their appeal to the Secretary
of the Treasury. They said that they
also were farmers : nd that they in
tended to study agriculture In Califor
nia by walking from farm to farm and
â tvÂ«ichinÂ£r the wheat wilt under the
dry north wind and fruit blossoms
freeze on the trees. They bear all the
ear marks of contract laborers.
Under this new and unexpected
phase of affairs Commissioner North
wired Commissioner-General Powderly
for advice, and yesterday received a
dispatch reading as follows:
Under the agreement between the Sec
retf ry of the Treasury and Canadian

certificates of admission from the United

"This matter," said Commissioner
North yesterday, "may develop a dis
cussion between the transportation
companies. If we keep shutting out
this class 6f Japanese laborers at San
Francisco and if the Commissioner at
Victoria keeps letting them in, the
transportation companies whose lines
terminate at San Francisco will kick.
In order to avoid this friction and not
to injure the trade of San Francisco
while at the same time performing my
official duties conscieutiously, I have
invited United States Commissioner
if Victoria to a conference with
me, in order that we may agree upon
a uniform system or standard of exam
ining and dealing with alien immi
grants suspected of coming here on la
bor contracts. He has accepted the
invitation, and we have hope that the
matter may be adjusted satisfactorily
to the interests of this port, as well as
of the Government."

Another vessel has been wrecked on the
coast. The schooner Bobolink left Mon
docino City last Thursday morning with
every prospect of making a quick passage
to San Francisco. The land breeze car
ried her off the coast, but it soon fell
light and the schooner began to drift.
Everything posible was done to save her,
but before nightfall she was hard and
fast on Kents Point, near Mendocino
City. An attempt was made to get her
off, and while the men were at work one
of the boats capsized, and Peter Nelson
was drowned.
The Bobolink was loaded with lumber
for the Mendocino Lumber Company, and
while the vessel will probably be a total
loss, the chances are that the cargo will
be saved. The schooner was built in IS6S
in Oakland Creek, and was 161.67 tons net
burden. She was 104 feet 5 inches long,
29 feet 3 inches broad and 8 feet 9 Inches

The Susquehanna has a cargo that would

her cargo la 5470 pigs of lead, 142,646

Strange coincidences sometimes arise in
the names of deserters from the United
States navy. Thus Charles Oceon got ;
tired of "a life on the nrfen wave," and !
deserted the cruiser Baltimore at Hono- j
lulu, while the fidelity of Louis Fidelity
could not withstand the allurements of
sunny Italy, so he deserted the cruiser '
San Francisco at Genoa. Both Oceon and |
Fidelity joined the United States navy in
San Francisco, so the record of their de
sertion had to be sent to this port for
filing. It will go hard with both of them
if they ever return to the United States
and are caught.
Nearly the entire fleet of coasting
steamers has been withdrawn from the
regular channels and is now engaged in
the Dvea-Skaguay trade. Twenty-six
San Francisco-owned steam schooners
are running between Portland, Seattle
and Tacoma and Juneau, Dyea and Skag
uay. Beside these there are thirteen
other steamers now on the way here from
Eastern points to join in the general rush,
so a big break in rates may be expected
before many weeks are over.
The three-pile beacon on the end of the

The crews of the life saving stations
have been patrolling the beach from
Point Lobos south to Point San Pedro
for the last few days in the hope of
picking up something that might come
ashore from the wreck of the Helen W.
Almy. Yesterday while near the Ocean-
Bide House they found the remains of a
black doc. It wore a muzzle, also a steel
collar, on which was engraved "Nigger
Bohen." H. Mohns of Mohns & Katten
bach asserts most positively that there
was no dog on the Almy when she sailed.
Others say, however, that Captain Ho
gan owned a dog called "Nigger Bohen,"
and that it went to sea with him.

the conclusion that the rockets were fired

time ago and stealing considerable
jewelry, was arrested last evening af-
EDNA TRUEWORTHY, the Girl Burglar.
ter an exciting chase and locked up In
the City Prison. She was found in
company with a girl named Alice At
wood, who was also taken into cus
tody.
Shortly after 5 o'clock yesterday af
ternoon Mrs. Schofleld recognized the
Trueworthy girl on Fourth street, and
she started to speak to her. Evidently
thinking that she had intended to have
her arrested the erring girl ran up
Mission street and darted into St. Pat
rick's Church, where she tried to con
ceal herself. Detectives Sullivan and
Graham happened to be in the vicinity,
and, seeing the girl running, they fol
lowed her into the church. She was at
once taken to police headquarters and
closely questioned. She at first de
nied her guilt, but finally broke down
and made a confession. A portion of
the -Jewelry which she had stolen was
found in her possession.
To the detectives the girl admitted
that a short time ago she entered a
room in the Hotel St. Nicholas ami
stole several pieces of jewelry. Her
scheme was to visit a hotel and after
entering the parlor she would appai
ently amuse herself by playing the
piano. As one of the women guests
left her room the girl, with the aid of
a skeleton key, would at once enter the
apartments and make a thorough
search for jewelry and other valuables.
After satisfying herself that she had
not overlooked anything she would
then leave the hotel as mysteriously
as she entered.
Last night the detectives recovered
several pieces of Jewelry which the girl
had stolen. They were found in a
pawnshop on Third street, where she
had sold them.
F.dna is not unknown to the police.
Some time ago she wÂ£s arrested for
stealing some jewelry, but on accouri
of her tender age it was decided to
send her to the reform school.
After a few weeks' incarceration she
escaped with several other girla by
climbing over a high fence whisa sur
rounded the institution. To-day the
detectives intend to place several
charges of burglary against her.

Ran Away From Home Intending

Mrs. Gay .Thomas, the woman whom
Irene Lynch accuses of having held her
a prisoner in a room in the Glenbrook
House, was arrested yesterday after
noon by Detective Anthony and taken
to police headquarters. To Chief Lees
she said that she fir: met Irene about
a week before tie latter disappeared.
Subsequently sh< frequently met Miss
Lynch at the race track.
Irene told her that she was dissatis
fied with her home life and had deter
mined to run away. She begged Mrs.
Thomas to allow her to live with her
until she could better her condition.
Mrs. Thomas, after considerable per
suasion, consented to take the erring
girl to her rooms.
The day after Irene disappeared, as
the story runs, she telephoned to Mrs.
Thomas that she was on her way to
the rooms of the latter. Notwithstand
ing the positive denial of the girl that
Mrs. Thomas held her a prisoner the
woman told Chief Lees that Irene fre
quently left the room to visit various
male acquaintances. She would return
in a few hours, and, according to Mrs.
Thomas, she gave evidence of having
drunk to excess. The girl, she said,
was in the habit of sending notes to
race track touts and jockeys, asking
them to call. When told that her pa
rents were making strenuous efforts to
locate her she merely smiled and said
that she would never return home. It
was her intention, so Mrs. Thomas
states, to go to Skaguay or some other
Alaskan point, where she intended to
seek employment. Mrs. Thomas was
accompanied by the "mysterious Jack,"
who Irene claims had assisted Mrs.
Thomas in abducting her.
Jack, whose last name the police re
fuse to divulge, formerly worked at the
Union Iron Works. He corroborated
Mrs. Thomas' statement that the girl
voluntarily left her home and that she
had no desire to return. Convinced
that these people were telling the, truth
Chief Lees at once released them. He
does not expect that Lynch will prose-
cute the* pair, as he seems to think
that an abudance of proof has already
been obtained to the effect that the girl
left her home of her own volition, de
termined to leave the city at the first
opportunity.

In the early part of the session of 1833
he introduced a bill for the erection of
a public building in San Francisco, to
be used for State offices, calling for an
appropriation of $300,000. This bill
passed both houses of the Legislature,
but was finally killed by the veto of

and Dr. Hatch. Superintendent of State
Hospitals. The Secretary of State was
not present at tht session yesterday.
The little dispute at the Mendocino asy

gaged the attention of the commission. A
ruling was made that the $250 allowed
every month for the superlntendency of

appointed to the position of superintend

TO BUILD A HOME.
Wives of Masons Lend Their Aid in
Making the Festival a Success.
The wives of Master Masons are taking
an active part in the coming Masonic
Festival and are daily holding meetings
to insure its success. Yesterday the wives
of members of California Lodge organized
a temporary circle, which is to be made
more complete next Wednesday after
noon when they will again meet in King
Solomon's Hall. Mrs. Ernest H. Hill was
made temporary chairman. She told the
ladies present that it was the first time in
the history of Masonry in California that
an organized effort was made to gather
money for the building of such a home.
i, a r ule said she, Masons quietly go
into their' packets, but in this instance
t was deemed the wiser plan to hold a
festival, and in this way gather the
money needed.
While the ladies are at work the men
are also busy collecting funds. The most
prominent among them is the treasurer
of Scottish Rite Lodge of Perfection Lip
man Sachs. Captain-General Frank Titus
of California Comma ndery has just re
turned from a tour of tne State, and as
sures the executive committee that Ma
sons' in the interior are coming to the
festival in large numbers. Nearly every
lodge will send a delegation, while many
will come of their own accord.
There are to be competitive drills among

' Donations' to the amount of $4000 were
received by Chairman Charles Patton
yesterday.
Governor Markham.
During the session of 1895 he was in
strumental in securing the passage of
a bill making an appropriation of $200,
000 to the Affiliated Colleges.
When the coyote scalp bounty ques
tion matter was agitating the Boards
of Supervisors of the different counties
of the State he drafted and introduced
a bill to repal that notorious act and
was successful in carrying the meas
ure.
He was a strong advocate of the
measure granting terminal facilities to
the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railroad, aidincr materially in
the passage of the bill.
In 1596 he received the Non-Partisan
nomination for Supervisor, but met de
feat at the polls.
When, by an order of Judge Wallace,
the Board of Supervisors were ousted
from office for failing to fix a water
rate. Governor Budd appointed him to
fill one of the vacant places.
At present he is the vice-president of
the United States Laundry Associa
tion, which office he has held for sev
eral years.
The appointment meets with the ap
proval of all parties.
MYERS ARRESTED
FOR PERJURY
Was Arraigned Before Judge
Campbell and Will Be
Tried on Monday.
Notary Henry May Also Get Into
Trouble on a Charge of
Felony.
Judge Hunt yesterday adjudged Ber
nard F. Myers guilty of perjury and or
dered him Into the custody of the Sheriff.
The perjury that Myers must account for
was committed in the divorce suit of Dies
vs. Dies. While action was pending in
this case it seemed that the attorney for
the plaintiff served a summons upon the
defendant to appear in court and show
reason why he should not pay the ali
mony that was demanded. The defend
ant did not appear and a bench warrant
was issued for him.
He denied that he had ever received the
summons, and in the investigation of the
matter it was shown that Attorney Howe
got Myers to appear before Notary A. J.
Henry a.nd swear that he had served the
summons upon the defendant, which he
had never done.
In the order of commitment Myers was
taken before Judge Campbell and ar
raigned and the case continued until
Monday. Howe is "a disbarred attorney,
and it "now appears that he got Myers to
sign his name to a paper, the contents of
which the latter says he did not know,
and then Howe took the paper to Henry
and got him to affix his seal to it. This
i.s a felony and Henry may get into trou
ble for afflxins his seal to a document
without the affiant being present to be
sworn.

CALIFORNIA'S SEMI-CENTENNIAL
THE great International fair cele
brating the fiftieth anniversary of
the admission of the Golden State
into the Union may now be regard
ed as an assured fact. Mayor Phe
lan has completed the important
task of naming the fifteen committee
men who will handle the various
branches of the vast undertaking, men
who have been selected after mature
deliberation as being representative cit
izens in their line. And it is a pleas
ing fact, indicative of the success of
the project, that all have entered into
the spirit of the project with unbound
ed enthusiasm and have promised to
do all in their power to further the
best interests of their State.
Now that the committee has been
appointed the next thing to be consid
ered is a meeting for the purpose of
formulating the preliminary steps. Here
is where the greatest caution will have
to be exercised, as a start in the right
direction means much to the ultimate
euceess of the affair. Mayor Phelan
states that he will call a meeting of
the committee in a few days. At that
meeting it is probable that the first
thing to receive consideration will be
the matter of a State appropriation to
aid in bearing the expenses of the
work.
Governor Budd has received letters
from the Governors of Nebraska, Mon
tana, Oregon and Minnesota, all prom
ising warm support for the fair. Each
one promises to appoint a committee
to a convention to be held to discuss
plans for the exposition and to do
whatever else may be in his power for
the good of the project. The Gover
nor of Idaho is at present out of that
State, but. his secretary, under date of
March 15, writes that he is expected
to return in a few days, and a favora
ble reply will doubtless be received ai
that time. . .
From the Mayors of the various cities
and towns of the interior come letters
eulogistic of the idea of a great inter
national fair to spread abroad the
knowledge of the resources of this State
and the advantages of living here. Sev
eral are given in this issue, and others
vill be printed later on.
Attorney J. B. Reinstein of the law
firm of Reinstein & Eisner, who has
been assigned the educational and pro
fessional branch of the grand celebra
tion, believes it too early yet to dis
cuss the means of securing the cele
brat.'on or the features; that these
things should be left to the mature de
liberation of the committee.
"California is a State the advantages
of which are little known throughout
the East and elsewhere," he said, "and
there is no doubt that such an exposi
tion would do us a world of good. There
is no reason in my opinion, if proced
ure is made along the right lines, why
the affair could not be made a grand
success. My professional and other du
ties are pretty heavy at present, but I
am in hopes they will lighten by the
time active work in this matter be
comes necessary, as I would take a
great deal of pride in lending my best
efforts to the furtherance of the plan."
A. S. Baldwin of the real-estate firm
of Baldwin & Howell, who has been as-
Pigned the Merchants' Association
branch of the celebration, stated yes
terday that the proposition will prob
ably be brought before that body after
the charter has been signed, which will
probably be within two weeks. Speak
ing individually, he was sure that the
association could be depended upon to
do all in its power for the furtherance
of so worthy a project.
"A great deal of preliminary work
â¢will have to be done by the committee
before the citizens are assembled," he
said, "and the most important thing to
be considered is the raising of the nec
essary funds. The people will doubtless
enter into the spirit of th<* affair so
heartily that I anticipate little trouble
in that direction."
There is one branch of the celebra
tion which will be exemplified in a
manner never seen before west of the
Rockies â the amusement element. This
branch has been placed in charge nf a
man of experience and keen profes
sional spiritâ P. H. Frioilnprtpr nf M<Â«
theatrical firm of Friedlander, Gottlob
& Marx.
"I am going to make this one of the
efforts of my life, said that cotn
mitteeman yesterday. "The people of
this State can rest assured that they
will be given amusements of such a
nature and such a character that they
alone will be one of the strongest
drawing cards of the celebration, a
card that will bring a tremendous in
flux of people into the State, without
considering any other feature.
"As I have been only lately notified,
I have had no chance to outline any
plans as yet. However, I can say this:
The character of the amusements will
be different from anything ever given
the public here before, and it will be
absolutely independent of the the
aters."
W. H. Mills, who will have charge of
the transportation branch of the af
fair, asserted yesterday that this end
can be depended on to take care of it
self. He did not care to make any
definite statements, on account of the
fact that the committee must act as a
whole. In Mr. Mills' estimation, the
affair, if conducted rightly, will be of in
calculable value to the State in many
ways, educating as it will the country
at large to a proper appreciation of the
resources of the State.
"LEO XIII IN THE VATICAN."
A Lecture by T. Marion Crawford
Arranged by the Y. M. I.
The Young Men's Institute Lecture Bu
reau met last evening and completed its
arrangements for the lecture to be deliv
ered on "Leo XIII in tiie Vatican," by F.
Marion Crawford, the eminent novelist,
nt the California Theater, next Monday
ovenlng.
Mayor James D. Phelan has kindly
promised to preside and introduce the
distinguished lecturer. The committee
reported a good demand for tickets. The
Committee also reported that the boxes
had been sold to prominent Catholib gen
tlemen, who have thus shown their in
terest In the lecture and their apprecia
tion of the work of the lecture bureau.
SUICIDE CAUSED BY SICKNESS.
Mrs. Lippman, Dreading a Necessary
Operation, Took Her Life.
Despondent on account of an illness of
a serious nature Mrs. Ambrozlne Lippman
took carbolic acid yesterday at her home,
94514 Folsom street. The dose was taken
at 4 o"clock in the afternoon, and a short
time after that the woman was found
lying on the floor of a Closet by her
mother-in-law. Mrs. Simons. Dr. Maston,
of 989 Howard street, was called In, but
â was unable to counteract the poison, and
Mrs. Lippman died at 7 o'clock.
Mrs. Lippman had been suffering from
a tumor for some time, and yesterday
morning went to Mt. Zion Hospital and
consulted Dr. Livingston in regard to her
ailment. He informed her that an oper
ation would be necessary. This news
frightened the lady, and on her return
home she went to a closet and took the
carbolic acid. She was 28 years old, a
widow and leaves a little girl 8 years
old.

NOW WE MUST HAVE A
GOOD APPROPRIATION
A Most Important Subject to Be Considered at
the First Meeting of the Committee.
I have worked hard on the problem of a committee, and have finally se
cured what I regard as an ideal working body. All the men are represen
tative of their respective lines and ail but one, who was until lately out of
the city, have cheerfully consented to act. I shall call the committee together
in a few days and have the preliminaries for the great movement under way
as soon as possible. One of the very first matters to be considered will be
the taking of steps to secure a State appropriation. The prospects are excel
lent for a celebration on a great scale, one that will herald the fame of the
State far and wide.â Mayor James D. Phelan in an interview.
MONTANA TO BE RELIED UPON.
OUR DIVERSITY OF INTERESTS.
They Should for Once Be Adequately Represented tc
the Outside World.
PACIFIC GROVE, March 15.â 0. S. Trimmer, president of the Board of
Trustees of Pacific Grove, in speaking to-day of the exposition project for
1900, as suggested by The Call, said: "I
about so laudable a project, and I can think of no more fitting manner of
celebrating the golden anniversary of our entrance into the Union."
OREGON HEARTILY APPROVES.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1808.
think such an enterprise would be an
inestimable benefit to California, both
in bringing people from other portions
of the country to our State, and also in
developing and demonstrating the
many resources of the State. The com
mercial interests of California have
never been and are not now adequately
understood by those outside the State,
because they have never been properly
represented. Qur climate and fruit
products have been advertised to the
fullest extent by the railroads, but
otherwise little is known of us, and I
believe by an exhibition such as The
Call suggests we could show the rest
of the world what we can do in other
ways than fruit raising. I should cer
tainly co-operate heartily in any effort
that may be made toward bringing
EXPECTS OVERWHELMING SUCCESS.
Sonora's Chief Official Wants to See All Previous
Efforts Totally Eclipsed.
SONORA March 15. â Leonard Kahl, president of the Board of City Trus
tees, is speaking here to-day to a representative of The Call concerning its
efforts in behalf of holding an exposi
tion in 1900, said: "The Call's efforts for
the holding in San Francisco of an ex
position in lflOO to commemorate its half
century of Statehood are praiseworthy
and timely in an eminent degree, for
I feel that such would prove of incal
culable good to this State, and I sin
cerely hope and expect to see its ener
getic steps in furtherance of the plan
meet with overwhelming success, such
as will totally eclipse, great and far
reaching though they were, the glories
and results of the Midwinter Fair.
Such an undertaking, with the right
kind of men at its head, should prove
to the outside world that we on the
Pacific Coast are fully abreast of the
idea as fully and completely as our
brethren in the older and more thickly settled Eastern States. The Call is
deserving of great credit for the unique idea, and I hope and fully expect
to see it crystallize itself into an assured fact at no distant date, and feel
sure that such wIU prove the case. Tuolumne County will do her share by
making such a display of her mineral â wealth and other resources as will be
alike creditable to herself as a county and an integral part of the common
â¢wealth, and doubtless her neighbors will vie with her and each other by their
gold exhibits, in showing to the world that California to-day, with her great
Mother Lode' and almost equally great eastern belt, has no peer as a gold pro
ducer The Call is deserving of the thanks of every man, woman and child
in the State for its present intelligent and heroic efforts in behalf of the ad
vancement of the material and industrial progress of our people, and truly
proves itself a worthy champion and exponent of their needs."
HEARTILY IN FAVOR OF THE PROJECT.
Redding's Mayor Says That the State Should Dis
count All Past Efforts.
REDDING, March 15. â "You may quote me as heartily in favor of the ex
position for 1900," were the words of Mayor O. J. Lowry when questioned on
the subject.
"I am certainly not in favor, how
ever, of an exposition which would in
terfere with that of the Paris Exposi
tion, and appear in the light of an act
of discourtesy to the French Govern
ment. But if the dates could be so ar
ranged as not to clash with those of
the French Fair, I am sure that San
Francisco could depend on Northern
California putting no stumbling block
in the way of the project as outlined in
The Call.
"San Francisco's winter climate is
such a great attraction in itself that
It would be a mistake to open an ex
position in any other season of the
year, and on that account there is no
reason why our exposition should in-
terfere with the Paris fair, which closes.
I believe, in November. If such a splendid showing as the Midwinter Fair
could be made in so short a time we ought to discount it with the time and
opportunity now at our command. Our marvelous winter climate makes Cali
fornia the show ground of America, and if the public-spirited citizens of San
Francisco, aided by those of the State at large, take the matter in hand I
am positive the results would surpass our most sanguine anticipations."
Other prominent citizens expressed enthusiastic approval of The Call's ex
position project, and there is no doubt but San Francisco would receive sub
stantial encouragement from Shasta County toward making the exposition
the greatest in the history of the State.
THE CALL HAS THE RIGHT IDEA.
The Mayor of Salinas Suggests Some of the Bene
fits of Such an Exposition.
SALINAS, Cal., March 15.â Charles Frances Mayor of Salinas, said: The
semi-centennial celebration of Califor nia's admission into the Union should
rich strikes will have much, money to leave here if they find an exposition or
anything else to interest and amuse them, and naturally whatever money is
expended in our State adds to it 3 wealth and power. The financial benefit of
an exposition such as The Call suggests will come not only after the formal
opening of the fair, but will be felt In the various lines of trade from the
very beginning. Laborers antl mechanics will be given employment In pre
paring the grounds and erecting the buildings and artisans and artists of all
classes will be called upon to make them attractive. Taking the project as
a whole I am strongly in favor of It, and as a citizen of California shall give
my efforts and hearty sympathy to its furtherance.
OUR UNEXAMPLED RESOURCES.
It Would Be an Excellent Opportunity to Make a
flascnificent Display of Them.
VISALIA, March 15.â Mayor Hammond of this city was interviewed to-day
as to his views on the proposition to hold a jubilee exposition in San Fran-
Cisco in 1900 to celebrate the fiftieth
annlversar- of the admission of the
State into the Union. Mr. Hammond
is greatly pleased at the idea. He said:
"That idea of The Call is a grand
thing, sure. I am heartily in favor of
it. But that proposed exposition should
be done on a grand scale in order to
attract the people not only from all
over the United States but from put
side our boundaries. It will be an ex
cellent opportunity, Indeed, to make a
magnificent display of our unexam
pled resources.

securing, to California the -population

justify. The exhibits should embrace
representations from Mexico, China

HONOR THE
HEROIC DEAD
Impressive Obsequies
of the Late Lieu
tenant Burke.
Streets Blocked by the
Many Friends of the
Deceased.
His Courage and Christian De
votion Praised by the Rev.
Father Cummings.
THE BIER FLOWER LADEN
Remains Followed by His Late Com
rades and Heads of the Police
Department to Holy Cross.
All that was mortal of the late Lieu
tenant William F. Burke was borne
from St. Charles Borromeo's Catholic
Church on Eighteenth and Shotwell
Btreets yesterday morning to Holy
Cross Cemetery, where the body was
consigned to the grave, covered with
such floral offerings as are rarely seen.
The expressive words, "He died doing
his duty," told the history of the man.
At the late residence of deceased, 238
Shotwell street, at an early hour yes
terday morning, thousands gathered to
take a last glimpse of the features of
the dead. The body reposed in state
in the front parlor of the house. The
features were calm and peaceful. Upon
the coffin had been placed cut flowers
and handsome floral pieces of every
description and in great quantity.
The offerings came from, the Police
Department, the Police Commissioners,
the Widows' and Orphans' Aid Society,
Borromean Council (Y. M. I.), The Call
staff and the various presentations of
friends. The pieces were various in
form, representing stars, shields and
other appropriate emblems. On the cof
fin were noticed sheaves of wheat and
a wreath of immortelles.
At the hour set for service the Church
of St. Charles Borromeo was filled to
Its utmust capacity with friends of the
murdered officer, while there had es
sembled 150 policemen and the various
officers, to exhibit the last mark of re
spect and to share with the bereaved
wile the sorrow lor one who ha.d been
a true husband, an honest, upright
man and an officer who, when duty
called. feared not to risk and
to lose his life in reply to
the summons. Besides these were
present the officers and members
rromtran Council No. 129, Young
Men's Institute, the officers and mem
bers of the WldowB 1 and Orphans' Aid
!>- and hundreds who never knew
the dead lieutenant during his lifetime,
save from the publication of . his bril
liant deeds performed in the service of
the public.
The scene at the church when the
hour arrived for the service was unique
in the extreme, as every seat and even
standing room was at a premium. The
police formed in a line, holding the
crowd back, and when the somber fu
neral carriage reached the sidewalk
the body was borne into the church.
At the door it was met by Faiher Cum
mings, pastor of the church, and two
acolytes, who sprinkled holy water, on
the casket as it was carried into the
sacred edifice and placed on a dais
before the altar. The casket was fol
lowed closely by Chief of Police Lees,
Police Commissioners Tobin, Alvord
and Gunst and Police Judge Conlan,
after which followed the widow, lean
ing on the arm of Patrick Burke, a
brother of the dead officer. The detail
of police then marched in and occupied
seats that had been reserved for them
in the body of the church.
A solemn high requiem mass was
eaid, Father James McDonKld, sub
deacon, being the celebrant. Schmidt's
"Requiem Mass" was sun); by the
choir, composed of Miss M. A. Stevens,
soprano; Miss May Corlett, alto; Man
lloyd Jones, tenor; L. A. Larsen, bas
fo, and Mrs. Paul B. Hay, organist and
director.
Before the close of the mass the Rev.
Father Cummings, who had Known the
deceased and admired him for his
many acts of goodness, delivered a
short eulogy. After having read a
chapter in the Bible from Thessaloni
ans and from St. John, he said:
"When the epitaph of our c"cad friend
comes to be written the woids will be,
'Died doing his duty.' He vis a man
devoted to his duty, faithfu! under all
circumstances, all condition , and his
death, though sad, was a ft ting close
to an honorable, and dutiful |ife. There
Is no need, gentlemen, to sp ;ak to you
of the worth of him as a n^tn and an
officer. You who knew him* who were
with him night and day Jfigh unto
twenty years, knew his *eal merit,
how hard he worked, how faithful to
duty. It was known to yc*i, as It is
now known to the whole * city, how
brave he was. He bore the honor and
respect of his superiors: he u-as looked
upon as a model. To him <'.:ity meant
more than the mere answe'ing to roll
call or keeping the peace in various
ways or as a guardian of thy public."
His Christian character and his de
votion to his church was dwelt on at
some length.
Continuing, the speaker said: "His
death, his devotion to duty, we feel
assured will recommend him favorably
to the generous Christ, and of him like
wise we know it will be said: 'Well
done, thou good and faithful servant:

TAKING THE CARGO OUT OF THE NEW YORK BY TROLLEY
The illustration represents the New York as she lies in Halfmoon Bay
while her cargo is being taken out by means of a wire trolley stretched
from a fifty-foot cliff on the shore above the sandy beach to the deck of
the ship. The beach is composed of quicksand four feet in depth, and for
that reason it is not possible for wagons to travel over it. Hence the top
of the fifty-foot cliff has been utilized as the place for depositing the cargo
as it comes over the trolley. It will be seen that the ship has not much of
a list In fact, her hull is uninjured, and it is expected that when all her
cargo shall have been unloaded she can be hauled off with a tug and saved.
Thou has been faithful over a feu
things; I will place thee over many.'
At the conclusion of the services in
the church the body was borne
to the hearse, accompanied by the
honorary pall - bearers, who were:
Sergeants l"rice, Mooney. Donovan and
McManus, Lieutenants Hannah, Bird
sail, Esola and Bennett. These, with a
squad of twenty-five policemen under
command of Sergeant Bethel, escorted
the body to the Holy Cross Cemetery,
where it was interred.
The escort from tlti church to the
train consisted of Chief of Police Lees
with fifty men from Company A, Cap
tain Wittman; fifty men from Com
pany B, Captain Spillane; and fifty
men from Company C, Captain Gillin.
Following the police the representa
tives of the Widows' and Orphans' As
sociation marched. The officers were:
John Martin, president; John Fitz
henry, vice-president; Sam Rankin,
financial secretary; and Directors But
terworth, Williams, Houghtaling and
Anderson.
The officers and members of Borro
mean Council of the Young Men's In
stitute came next.
At Holy Cross Cemetery the cortege
was met by Father Brady, who officiat
ed and offered up the last prayer over
the remains.
The floral offerings were numerous
and expensive. It required two wagons
to convey them to the cemetery- Vacant
chairs, broken wheels, pillows and in
fact everything emblematic of death
and sorrow were worked into floral de
vices. But the most impressive one of
all was the patrol-wagon and horse.
The horse was in white roses, while the
wagon was in evergreens with the
words, "His last ride," in violets. This
piece was placed on the grave by the
four lieutenants who accompanied his
remains.
The bottom of the grave and also the
sides were lined with canvas, on which
were numerous white flowers stitched
on the cloth which concealed the grave.
Under the provisions of the pension
law and the rules of the department
the widow gets $1100 from the widows'
and orphans' fund, and $45 a month as
pension from the city as long ao she
lives or remains unmarried.
COWARDICE SUSPECTED.
The Actions of Officers Ken-
nedy and Wilkinson to
Be Investigated.
Detective Cody has been specially de
tailed by Chief Lees to make a thor
ough investigation into the actions of
Officers Wilkinson and Kennedy at the
time of the murder of Lieutenant
Burke.
Just what they were doing when their
officer lay in front of the miser's cabin
has been a matter of some conjecture,
and it is strongly suspected that they
behaved in a most cowardly manner.
If it can be proven that they willfully
got themselves out of the way of dan
ger and allowed the wounded man to
take his chances at the hands of the
frenzied assassin no time will be lost in
ridding the department of the odium
of their presence.
Sergeant Russell has been instructed
to prepare models of the shanty and
surroundings, and these will be used as
evidence in the coming trial.
Apart from the actions of the two of
ficers and the distrust in which they
have been viewed, stands the character
of George Cashel, the driver, who is be
ing everywhere lauded as the hero of
the hour. His many friends on the
force are preparing a handsome reward
for him as a token of their esteem for
a man who did not know how to flinch
in time of danger.
HOFF PROSECUTION CLOSED.
The Prisoner Will Now Have a
Chance to Offer Evidence in
His Own Defense.
Albert Hoff will have an opportunity on
Monday next to explain his actions on
the day of the murder of Mrs. Clute. The
prosecution closed its case yesterday.
Stenographer Heyneman's story of
Hoff's actions before the Chief of Police
was corroborated by Detective John Sey
mour, who told how Hoff tried to conceal
the wound on his hand by placing his hat
over it and of the cxpliination Hoff gave
of the wound. Mr. Seymour then told of
his taking Hoff to the scene of his crime,
how he was confronted by Mrs. Leprg.
who lived immediately beneath the resi
dence of the murdered woman, and of
her identification of the prisoner. The
prosecution then rested its case and
court adjourned until Monday, when the
â¢'Â«'onse will put in its evidence.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1898.
WHEN THE BAND
BEGINS TO PLAY
Ready for the Opening of
the California League
Season To-Day.
Colonel Robinson Will Do the
Honors and Lead the Pro
cession.
Enthusiastic Cranks Will Swarm at
Recreation Park to Cheer Their
Favsrites on to Victory.
Colonel T. Perennial Robinson is with
us again in all his glory, and this
afternoon his commanding figure,
swathed in gorgeous raiment will be
the star attraction on Market street.
For the colonel has rounded up another
scintillating aggregation of ball-swat
ters, and with them as a counter
balance will sally forth at the head of
a soul-inspiring band to inaugurate the
regular season of the California Base
ball League.
Of course there will be a procession,
and of equal certainty will the colonel
lead it, for what would a baseball turn
out be without his lengthiness to swing
the baton? The parade will start from
the Baldwin Hotel at 1:15 o'clock in the
following order: The colonel and his
band with a string of carriages contain
ing these promoters of the great Amer
ican game:
California League officersâ H. H. Mc-
Pike, president; Charles E. Wiggins, sec
retary.
San Jose Baseball Clubâ S. N. Rueker,
President; James Rueker, vice-president;
George E. Owens, secretary.
Oakland Clubâ H. A. Tubbs. president;
Charles Hannan, secretary! C. J. Heese

form; players.
San Francisco League Clvb â George D.
Bunker, manager; Marty Murphy, cap
tain; players.
Oakland Baseball Clvb â J. Cal Ewing.
manager; Fred Lange Jr., captain; play
ers.
This is the line of parade: Baldwin
Hotel to Market street, to California, to
Sansome, to Sutter, to Montgomery^ to
California, to Kearny, to Market, to
Eighth, to Recreation Park.
The park will be reached by 2 o'clock,
and for an hour, until game is called,
the fans will be given an opportunity
to divide their attention between ad
miring the colonel (who will positively
be on exhibition) and listening to an
excellent concert. Jim McDonald will
umpire the game. The California
League has secured his services until
his departure for the East to fill his
contract with the National League, and
for the next three weeks he will give
decisions at the big park at Eighth and
Harrison streets.
The children of all the orphan asy
lums in town have enthusiastically ac
cepted the invitation extended by the
league to attend the opening game, and
j the bleachers will be given over to the
little ones. The colonel will see that
they are properly supplied with pea
nuts and popcorn.
The grounds are in excellent condi
tion for the game, a vast amount of
j work having been performed during the
week on them. The fences have been
moved back sixteen feet, giving that
j much more space for the players. The
j opening game will be between San
i Francisco and San Jose, and when Um
i pire McDonald yells "play ball" they
j will line up as follows:
! San Francisco â H. Krug. shortstop or
J pitcher: Kelly shortstop or third base;
Murphy, first base; K. Krug, second base;
Hearty, left field; Pyne, center field;
Broekhoff, right field; Stroecker, catcher;
! Lee or Iberg, pitcher.
San Jose â Collins, short stop; Hall or
Reilly. second base; Ford, catcher; Shee
han. left field: Parker, center field; Dean
right field; Sharp or Hall, third base;
Weed, first base; Wheeler, pitcher; Hoff
man, extra.
For Sunday the league managers
have secured an extra attraction in the
person of big Jim Jeffries, the putdlist,
who knows all about the came and will
double up with McDonald In umpiring.
Charlie Chase of Stockton has also
been appointed to the- staff of umpires,
and the third will be selected next
week.

INSPECTOR
O'BRIEN HAS
A SINECURE
A School Department
Employe's Private
Contract.
Paid by the City to Attend
to His Personal
Interests.
Draws Salary for the Time He
Is Engaged in Other
Work.
STANCH FRIEND AT COURT.
Director Ragan a Brother-in-Law of
the Man Who Has Charge of
the School Buildings.
John J. O'Brien has what may with
entire truthfulness be termed a "snap,"
and, needless to say, he knows how to
make the most of it.
Mr. O'Brien is inspector of build
ings for the School Department,
for which he draws a salary of $150 a
month. He is also a brother-in-law of
School Director Ragan.
Mr. O'Brien's duties require his In
spection of all the school buildings, to
ascertain what they need in the way
of additions, repairs, etc., and to see
that the necesary work is done. This
in itself would seem to require about
all the inspector's time, and certainly
it was the supposition when the position
was established and the salary placed
at the comfortable figure named above
that the man who filled the place would
give his time to the city.
But Mr. O'Brien evidently has dif
ferent views on the subject, and is a
believer in the old adage that "a public
office is a private snap." For although
the gentleman has held the position
ever since the present board went into
office, he has found plenty of time to
engage in the business of contractor on
the outside and to superintend his pri
vate work when the occasion required.
One such jÂ»b in particular, which The
Call has succeeded in bringing to light,
will illustrate how Mr. O'Brien has
used the time he should have given to
his public duties to carry out his pri
vate enterprises. The property at 724 j
Mission street, on which stands the
Niagara Hotel, a small frame structure,
is owned by a gentleman named Sey
mour, but is controlled by E. W. Haw
kins, the real-estate agent. Last sum
mer it was deemed necessary' to put a i
new brick foundation under the build
ing and in th>? absence of Mr. Seymour
Mr.' Hawkins pave the job to O'Brien.
The work was performed last Septem
ber under O'Brien's supervision, and
the money paid to him by Mr. Haw
kins, as is shown by the receipt held
by the latter.
During that time O'Brien was draw
ing his regular salary from the School
Department, as shown by the payroll,
and President Barrington says that so
far as he knows the Inspector never
asked for, or was gra.nted, a vacation
since his appointment. While Mr.
O'Brien was carrying on his private
contract on Mission street he may have
found time to- make an occasional tour
of the school buildingsâ there is noth
ing to show that he did not â but the j
fact remains that not content to give j
his entire time during working hours
to the duties for which he was :
liberally paid by the taxpayers he j
engaged in a private undertaking,
and that, too, without the knowledge
of the board.
A Call reporter called upon Agent
WHERE O'BRIEN PERFORMED HIS CONTRACT.
' Hawkins yesterday and asked him who
put in the new foundation under the
Niagara Hotel, and the answer
promptly given was: "Mr. J. J. O'Brien,
the inspector of the School Depart
ment. At least, he is the man I made
the arrangements with and to whom
I paid the money for the work."
Asked where Mr. O'Brien could be
found, he replied that he was usually
i at the repair-shop until 9 o'clock in the
I morning. After that hour it would be
; a difficult matter to catch him, unless
it was at the City Hall or at his resi
dence, 6HV2 Broderick street. Mr.
Hawkins was asked the date that the
work was performed, and said he could
only tell by the receipts given him by
O'Brien. These showed three pay-
I ments, two during the month of Sep

MARION CRAWFORD IS HERE,
Author, Navigator and Cosmopolitan, He
Appears Master of His Fate,
There is wonderful vitality In Marion Crawford, whose name, as the writer
of many successful novels, is known from one end of the Union to the other.
Though" he only arrived in San Francisco yesterday morning, having traveled all
night from Ogden, he was found looking fresh as paint in his sitting room at
the Palace, ready either to be interviewed or to discuss business details with his
indefatigable manager. Major Pond.
There was a humorous twinkle in his clear blue eyes as he motioned his visi
tor to a seat, and held out the cigar box. "Look out for the matches." he said,
"or Major Pond will get them. Why, I've known that man to absorb forty
seven boxes of matches into various parts of his person, and still cry out for
more. I call him Judas Pond, because he carries the bag of silver, you know."
Major Pond, who is a man of wide experience, laughed good humoredly at
this little sally. It is evident that the entrepreneur and his lecturer are on the
best of terms.
"We have had a splendid trip," went on Mr. Crawford, "and I am delighted
to get this chance of seeing the country. I have never been West before, and
California is an unexplored land to me. But everywhere I have met with the
kindliest of receptions."
"It is a wonder you never thought of exploring the Californlan field of ro
mance."
"Bret Harte was there before me," replied Mr. Crawford, "and besides I
have been so busy in other parts of the world that I have had no time to study
the peculiar conditions of the Pacific Coast."
It is no wonder, Mr. Crawford is just now about as busy a writer as is to
be found in any part of the world. Though he is only 44 years of age. he has
produced no less than thirty novels, and even whilst traveling is actively work
ing upon another.
"This is how I work," said the author, as he held up a loosely bound vol
ume of yellow sheets. "I write upon my knee, so, I find that is the best
way of working. This is a medieval romance, which "is to be brought out by
Macmillan's in November. No, they do not wish the name known at present, or
else I would tell you, *nit they are in a hurry for the copy, and I have to
keep on sending it in as I go along, writing during the intervals of travel. Here
is the penholder with which I work," and Mr. Crawford held up a large and
venerable wooden holder. "All my novels have been written with this, though,
of course, the nib has been changed occasionally."
It would not do to mention what kind of a nib it was; that would be a direct
advertisement for the manufacturers, but it was a large soft steel one. And
Mr. Crawford's writing is small and cramped, so that It is not very easy to de
cipher.
"I have often been blamed for writing too fast," he remarked, "but that Is
simply because people do not understand my method of working. I know my
books by heart before I even begin to write them. I have everything composed
ready in my head before I start. I may have been evolving the plot for two or
three years, doing other work in the meantime.
When the whole outline of the story Is framed, the Incidents and characters
decided upon, and not until then. I sit down to write. I get up early in the
morning, and go on writing perhaps for nine hours every day. At this rate I
can manage 5000 words a day, and write one of my long stories, of about 150,000
words, in five weeks or so. But it is not faJr to accuse, me, as some critics have
done, of writing too rapidly; it is only the mere mechanical transposition that I
do at this speed. I am very slow and careful when composing."
Despite the enormous amount of literary work he has given the world, the
author does not show the slightest signs of exhaustion. His frame is vigorous
and erect, he carries himself with military bearing. His face is slightly bronzed
through travel, his forehead high and intellectual, his hair, now getting rather
thin, has only the very slightest tendency toward grayness.
"You see, I come of a very strong family," explained Mr. Crawford, "or else
I would never have been able to get through such an amount of work and show
no ill effects. All my ancestors were Rhodo Island people; they have been
buried at Newport since 1868. Some of them lived to be over 100, and nearly all
of them exceeded the allotted span of man's life. It is recorded of my grand
uncle, Richard Ward, that he once threw a mad bull which tried to gore him.
He seized the bull by the horns and turned him over with the greatest ease.
It was the last modern performance of this wonderful feat."
No wonder Mr. Crawford is strong, both physically and mentally. With
bull-fighting ancestors and artistic parents, he has had every chance to develop
his powers. And the free, wandering life which he has led, tied to no country
nor nationality, has tended to enlarge his mind and give him that marked
breadth of conception which is his strongest characteristic when dealing with
human nature. Crawford's father was a famous American sculptor, Thomas
Crawford, living at Rome, where the author was born. But the young Marion
got his early scholastic training in the States, and then, to round off his edu
cation, he spent some years at the English university at Cambridge, India ap
pealed to him, as it has done to many other clever men, with its wealth of mys
tic lore, and in 1880 he became the editor of a small up-country paper.
Strangely enough, Sinnett, who has also become known to fame as a Theo
sophical writer, was his rival editor, and the two formed a close friendship.
"It was there I wrote my first novel," said Mr. Crawford. "At least, I did not
know I was writing a novel then. I merely wrote the book to amuse my uncle.
It was just after Mme. Blavatsky's manifestation of occult phenomena, and
Mr. Isaacs was the result. Mr. Isaacs himself was taken from real life; he
was the famous jeweler of Simla, Jacobs, who was concerned in a great diamond
case. And most of the preternatural happenings in the book are taken from
my own experience."
"Then you believe in the workings of the occult brotherhood?"
"Oh, no; I have seen most of the tricks which Oriental jugglers can accom
plish, and my theory is that the audience is hypnotized. I am sure I have been
hypnotized myself on several occasions. I did not write any more Indian books,
though. Other matters attracted my attention, and by the time I was ready
to turn to the subject again, Kipling was in the field. He has an inherited
knowledge of Indian life and. lore, which makes him facile prlnceps when deal
ing with the East. I have never met Kipling in the flesh, but I have thegreatest
admiration for his work."
At present Mr. Crawford divides his attention between each side of the At
lantic. His home is in a romantic villa at Sorrento, by the side of the beautiful
Bay of Nades, but for about half the year he works in New York. In addition
to his many other accomplishments, the author Is also a practical sailor. He
crossed the Atlantic recently In a New Y*ork Pilot boat, which he bought and
fitted up as a yacht. "I have been used to the sea from boyhood." he says mod
estly. "I can sail anything, and hold a master's certificate from the New York
Association of Certified Ship Masters. So I navigated my own yacht across the
Atlantic, and though we had much rough weather, we got through without car
rying away a rope yarn." r-
tember and one early In October. Mr.
Hawkins explained that while the work
was being done O'Brien asked him for
some money, saying he needed it to pay
off his men. He was given the money,
and Mr. Hawkins inferred from the
dates on the receipts that the work
must have been commenced about the
first of September. It required about
a month to complete it.
The payrolls of the Board of Educa
tion show that O'Brien has drawn his
$150 per month regularly since his ap
pointment.
President Barrington of the board last
evening disavowed all knowledge of
O'Brien having been engaged in any
private enterprise since his appoint
ment, and said it could not have been
known to more than one or two mem
bers, if any. He said that so far as he
knew O'Brien had drawn his salary
regularly and had not been granted
any leave of absence. Had It been
known that the Inspector had been
using the time he was supposed to be
attending to his duties for his private
J benefit it would have been stopped sum
i marily, for although there was no rule
i that he knew of prohibiting employes of
the department from adding to their
Incomes outside of the department, a
regular employe like O'Brien and the
I two storekeopers. the scavenger and
| the teamster and the office clerks,
would not be permitted to attend to
other matters. Such a rule, Mr. Bar
rington said, would work great hard
ships on many teachers, particularly
those of the night schools, who are
paid but $50 a month and are obliged
to seek other employment during the
days, but there were restrictions
placed upon even the teachers in this
respect.
The president admitted that O'Brien
was a broth<>r-in-law of Director Ra
gan, but said he had be.en appointed to
his position as inspector before the doc
tor became a member of the board.
What, if any, action will be taken in
O'Brien's cas â¢ Mr. Barrington could not
say.

WHERE ANGLERS
CAN WHIP
FOR GAME TROUT.
Anglers do not hope for enjoyable
sport whipping coast streams this year.
For the past live or six seasons trout
fishing has been very poor because of
the scarcity of fish, which were in
variably caught by poachers before the
season for trout-fishing opened.
Of course, when those who defy the
fish laws are aware that no arrests have
been made, they become bold and reck
less and as a result they fish whenever
trout can be taken by any means. Then
the limited stocking which the coast
streams have received has been another
drawback to the angling fraternity.
Fish Commissioner Vogelsang has an
nounced that the coast streams will be
thoroughly stocked with rainbow trout
this year, and it Is hoped that the rail
road companies whose lines pass within
easy reach of favorite anglins waters,
â will lend the commission assistance in
Its attempt at stocking streams prop
erly.
The old system of dumping trout fry
into deep pools where large trout hide
should be abolished by the present
Board of Fish Commissioners, as the
only "pleasure" that the commission can
expect from such a lazy method of
stream-stocking is in the reading in its
biennial report to the Governor of the
thousands of little trout that were pitched
into the streams to be the food of pre
datory fishes.
Unless heavy rains arrive between now
and April Iâ which is the opening day of
the trout fishing season â anglers will find
the coast streams as low in April as they
were In June of last year.
It is reported from some country re
sorts that several of the large breedj.ng
fishes which dashed up stream during
the last freshet have remained in fresh
water, being unable to return when the
streams receded.
As far as fingerlings are concerned, it
Is hoped that anglers will not display any
of the feelings of the trout hog, which
are solely for quantity.
Trout fry under five inches in length
should be returned to the stream, and it
Is a very poor excuse for any angler to
have baby trout in his basket simply
because they were dead when they
reached his lingers. Dead or alive, trout
under four or five inches in length should
not find a resting place in the basket of
an angler who loves the sport of fly
fishing.
Those who are not acquainted with the
streams where in past years anglers have
enjoyed happy hours, will find the in
formation they desire by glancing over
The Call's summary of favorite trout
waters as follows:
The Nicasio is a good early stream. To reach
Its waters take the North Pacific Coast line
to Nicasio, walk over the hills to the north
and fish down the stream to the Paper Mill.
The upper portion of the Nicasio is known as
the San Geronimo. To fish this creek get off
at San Geronimo station and commence fishing
right at the station.
Following the line of this road, the San
Anselmo is the next good early stream but
this year It Is fished out. To fish its waters
go to Fairfax, fish down stream several
miles and take the return train at San An- i
selmo.
The next stream is the Lagiinltas. a beau
tiful body of water.
Leave the train at Lagunitas station, better
known as the 'â¢Wood Pile." and fish down
the Carson to the Lagunitas and then either
up stream or down to Camp Taylor; or go to
San .Rafael, take the Bolinas stage to Lib
erty, the headwaters of the Lagunitas, and
fish down stream to the 'â¢Wood Pile." where
you can take the return train. This is a ten
mile walk and can be finished in a manner,
but It will take two days to fish it prop
erly. It is a small stream, at Fairfax and
somewhat bushy, but is full of inviting pools
and riffles.
Olema Creek is one of the best early sea
son streams. Take the train to Tocaloma, then
stage tow miles to Olema, or get off at Point
and fish up stream. There are several
miles of good water before you reach the
Country Club preserve.
One of the most popular fishing resorts on
this line is Point Reyes. Paper Mill creek at
tliis point furnishes the best of sport both
early and late in the season. Steelheafls and
grilse may be caught at any time, and one
should go prepared for large fish.
There are two streams on this line known
as Salmon creek.
The one near Tomales Is properly Mud
Creek. To reach this stream leave the train
Just after it crosses the trestle at Tomales
and fish up stream.
Salmon Creek proper Is a beautiful stream
that empties into the ocean and afford 3 many
miles of good fishing. Go to Bodega roads
it is a plf-asant walk to the stream.
To those who can spend two or three days.
Duncans Mills provides an abundant choice
of good streams. Austin Creek, one mile from
the El Bonita Hotel, is a very fine stream,
that clears up very quickly after a rain
There are plenty of native fish and 10,000 rain
bow trout were planted there five or six years
ago, and several large rainbow trout were
caught near the mouth of this stream last
season.
Kidd creek, a -branch of the Austin, four
miles from Duncans, is one that can be de
pended upon for a nice lot of ttgh.
Old Bridge creek, another branch of the
Austin, two miles from Duncans, is a nice
little stream.
Freezeout. one quarter mile from Duncans, is
good almost any time for a nice breakfast.
Willow Creek, three miles south of Duncans,
Is one of the surest creeks few any season.
Sheep House Creek, which empties into the
Russian River directly opposite Willow Creek,
is another good creek. Howards Creek, three
and a half miles north of Duncans, empties
into the Russian at Russian River station.
This is another excellent stream. Russian
Gulch Creek, eight miles north of Duncans,
empties into the ocean. This ia a large stream
that stands lots of flshinc. Jennie Gulch, four
miles south of Duncans, empties into the Rus
sian near its mouth. This is a good small trout
creek. All of the streams of this section are
accessible by county roads.
From Cazadero the upper Austin can be
fished, and just above the town is Ward
Creek, one of its tributaries, an excellent
early stream.
The East Austin can be reached by a two
mile walk to Watson's place. This Is one of
the very lip^t streams of that section.
The Little Guallala, a six-mile drive from
Cazadero. is a pood early stream of fair size.
Two young men took out over 1000 trout iri
three days' fishing in the Upper Austin last
April.
In Alameda County a pond early stream is
Alameda Creek. Go to Sunol or Pleasanton
and fish down stream.
San Pablo Creek is another excellent early
etream, but it is quickly fished out. On Sun
day you can take the California and Nevada
Railway at Emery station anil go to Bryants,
Orlnda Park, fish about four hours, and re
turn the same day. or go up one day and come
back the next. Some excellent catches of
good-sized fish were made in this etream early
last year.
There are many creeks and side streams
that can be reached from Los Gatos. Guada
loup Mine Creek, which is about four miles
from the town of I>is Gatoe, Is a good early
stream. L.os Gatos Creek, four miles from the
town of Lon Gatos, is another fine stream, as
Is also Saratoga Creek, four miles, and
Stephens Creek, eight miles distant.
San Mateo County. from Bp&niahtown or
Halfmoon Bay, to Pescadero, contains many
email mountain streams that are always good
at the first of the season. The Purissima is
one of the best. To rea<-h this stream go to
San Mateo and stage to Spanishtown, then
take a team to Mrs. Dougherty's, if you go
In the afternoon. If y<.u go in the niornlng
the stage will take you right through.
To reach the Ran Gregorio, another excel
lent stream, go to Redwood City and drive
over the hills to the creek. The I>a Honda,
another favorite stream. Is on the same road.
Further south are the I>obit^s, Trinitas, Clear
Creek, Ponpano, Peacadero. P.urtano and Fri-
Joles â all excellent eariy streams.
Boulder Creek is another good stream. Take
â¦he narrow gauge to Felton, change at Fel
The Field of Sport
ton for Foulder Creek, near the headwaters
of the San Lorenzo river. Boulder Creek is
rather bushy, but is one of the best of the
early streams for small flsh. The San Lo
renzo is quite a river, but generally runs
clear early in the season.
The Coyote was an excellent early \stream
last year. Go to Gilroy Hot Springs and fish
down stream. The Yagas and Llagas are
also good.
Go to Llagas station and drive four miles
to "Nick's."
The agents of the San F-ancisco and North
Pacific Railroad have reported the condition
of the streams as follows:
Cloverdaleâ Streams in this vicinity In good
condition; !ish are large and plentiful.
- Vassar and Gillispie creeks are quite clear;
will be good on the first.
C>lon Ellenâ The water is very low.
An excellent cast for opening day Is <a
March brown, red spinner and Benn's royal
coachman. If the red spinner does not take,
try in Its place the gray hackle, brown hackle
or black gnat. Last year on the Lagunitas,
during the middle of the day. anglers had
excellent luck with the Alexandraâ a fly with
peacock body and peacock hurl wings, closely
resembling the common housefly.
ATHLETES ARiTnOW
ON A FINE EDGE.
As each week passes the time prior to
the intercollegiate games is narrowed
down and now there are but two weeks
remaining before Stanford and California
will again meet on the tented field. The
first intercollegiate baseball game is
scheduled for April 9. The second game
will be played on the 16th of April. A
week later the blue and .gold and the
cardinal will flutter on the cinder path.
The final spring hand-to-hand encounter,
April 30, will have a diamond for its set
ting and then there will be a long rest
until the students with athletic proclivi
ties test their prowess on the gridiron
during the fall.
With but two weeks to end experiments
and to solidify a team it can hardly be
said that either college has selected the
nine which will represent it in the battle
for intercollegiate triumphs. Cochran
has had a severe trial at Berkeley and
Sheehan's work has not been what is
called a sinecure. One thing both mei>
have done and that is the attainment of
a -certain perfection in field play. The
improvement at Berkeley has been great.
Errors are less frequent and the rapidity
and style of the men in action is now a
noticeable quantity. Last Wednesday
California made but three errors in a
rattling game. Stanford is also showing
much better form, due to constant and
painstaking coaching.
It is a lamentable fact, but none the
less one of positive existence, that neither
the cardinal nor the blue and gold have
hitting teams. There are no men to re
place Elston. Krug, Hennessey and Sykes
with the stick. These men won the ma
jority of games for California last year.
Thi'ir absence may mean a lowering of
the California standards and a relegation
to its former position as the under one in
baseball affairs. T'nleas natters are de
veloped in the next two weeks the most
careful ball will be needed to win the
game for either team. Sykes. the one
good man with the stick at Berkeley, has
been kept off the team because he did
not appear regularly for practice. There
is a strong belief prevailing, however,
that he will wear the colors when the
bats are crossed on April 9.
At both institutions unabated interest is
manifested in track and field affairs.
Next Saturday the "annual handicap field
days for all the college will take place
on the university campus at Berkeley.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1898.
YACHTING DAYS
THAT ARE
NEAR AT HAND.
The officers of the Pacific Inter-Club J
Yacht Association for 189S are as follows:
President, Dr. C. L. Tisdale of the En- ,
cinals; vice-president Louie Sonniksen of ;
the South Bays; secretary, R. R. l'Hom
medleu of the Californlas; treasurer, P. j
J. Martenstein of the Corinthians. The :
regatta committee consists of Captain
Alexander Swanson, representing the Pa- j
cine Yacht Club; J. H. Hopps, represent- j
ing the Corinthian Yacht Club; Henry
M. Landsberge.r, representing the Encinal j
Yacht Club; John W. Homer, represent- !
ing the California Yacht Club, and C. I
A. Barker, representing the South Bay j
Club. Two years ago the San Francisco j
Yacht Club, resenting the action of the |
association in disqualifying the Catherine
for the Macdonough cup, left the asso- ;
ciation. The club has now intimated that,
on receipt of an apology from the asso- |
ciation, it will join the fold again. In- !
asmuch, however, as the action of the as
sociation was approved by the delegates
of the San Franciscos to the association,
it is unlikely that the association will
tender any apology.
The association has issued the "Yacht
signal code for use in San Francisco Bay
and adjacent waters," a handsome book
of fifty-two pages, with colored plates of
the international code, the burgees of the
Btz yacht clubs on the bay, anu the flags â â 
of their commodores and vice-commo- ;
dores. Signals have been arranged to j
give information and to direct evolution;?,
also for the names of the various points j
of the bay, and of all yachts that belong
to any of the six clubs. Members of clubs
may obtain copies by addressing their :
secretaries, or by applying to Mr. A. M.
Clay, of the Bank of California.
A* meeting of the members of the San
Francisco Yacht Club is to be held at
the Merchants' Exchange on Monday
evening 1 , for the purpose of ratifying the
new by-laws and considering the question
of joining the Pacific Inter-Club Yacht
Association.
The club has adopted a uniform consist- ;
ing of a blue military tunic and a naval 'â 
cap.
Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill's Cygnus will
be towed down from Larkspur on April
3 to her moorings, near the San Fran
cisco clubhouse.
The sloop Will o' the Wisp (owned by
Vice-Commodore G. T. S. White of the
San Francisco Yacht Club), which broke
loose from her moorings at Sausalito last
Sunday night, and ran into "Baron"
Ghetaldi's wharf, is now on the ways at
Menotti's, and will be ready in ample
time for the opening days. The pro
gramme of the San Francisco Yacht Club
has ben drawn up, but is -.iot yet printed.
Fleet-Captain Dr. A. W. McKenzii-'s
launch Alberta went over to Tiburon last
Sunday to tow Scout. Juanita and Will
o' the Wisp out of the lagoon and over
to Sausalito; after accomplishing this, she
took a party over to Tiburon Cove, where
she stuck fast in the mud, but after four
hours' contemplation of the beauties of
Belvedere scenery, she came off without
damage. The launch Hilda, formerly
Electrix, owned by Eugene Lee, has not
been recovered.
Dr. V. Buckley and Arthur Kanzee of
the San Franciscos intend to build a
schooner yacht with an engine to push
her along when breezes fail.
Ex-Commodore G*"> - ge ri. Billings' sloop
Nixie has been lying, covered with can
vas, on Frank Stone's ways at Tiburon
all winter.
It is the intention of 'the jinks commit
tee of the Corinthian Yacht Club to dis
pense with the farce and stereopticon
that have hitherto formed the leading
features at their opening entertainments
and give a variety show. What with n>w
boats, new members and a new hotel
nearly finished at Tiburon, the Corinthi
ans lonjt forward to a very successful
season.
The schooner Florence, 32 feet over all,
formerly of the California Yacht Club,
has joined the Corinthians. The King
Brothers' sloop Lois in on Frank Stone's
ways, and is being refitted for the sea
son.
F. Stone is building a 34-foot sloop on
lines designed by the late Captain Hall.
She is a kind of compromise between the
cutter and the center-board kypes. She
is deep and has a center-board, while her
lines are fine and promise great speed.
She has not so much overhang, either
forward or aft, as many of the modern
boats.
Mignon, owned by Biber. and Secret,
owned by T. P. Tracy, are still in the la
goon, but, being dismasted, may be
brought out at any time. Secret is for
sale. Biber, with two friends, will sail
Mignon.
Alex J. Young of the sloop Clara and
ex-commodore of the Corinthian Yacht
Club is to be married in April, but as his
fiancee is a yachtswoman it will not be
necessary for him to forego yachting.
C. J. Lancaster of the sloop Edna and
commodore of the California Yacht Club,
having sold E<tna to a member of the
Corinthian Yacht CUib. will carry his flag
during IS9S on E. N.Walter's sloop Embl3.
George B. Edgar of the sloop Thelma is
vice-commodore of the California Yacht
Club.
The officers of the Encinal Yacht Club
for ISM nre: President. Dr. C. L,. Tisdale:
vice-president, P. S. Teller; secretary. W.
O. Henn; commodore. Captain J. L. Han
ley, and vice-commodore, Harold Ward.
The new board of directors is composed
of energetic men. who intend to work
hard to increase the facilities and enlarge
the membership of the club. The club
house is to be repaired, repainted and fit
ted with more electric lights. The swim
ming quarters are to be improved, and
it has been suggested that a breakwater
should be built to render the anchorage
safe for yachts. That this is needed is
shown by an experience of George
Wright in last Sunday's blow. While
cruising with hi? children and two young
men, after rounding Hay Farm Island, he
lost his center-board, and carrying his
children ashore moored the yacht. Next
day when he came to look for her she
could not be found: but later was
brought back, having been picked up on
the bay.
On Saturday, April 2, the Enclnals will
hold a social for members, and the open
ing day is definitely set for May 14. A
programme is heintr arranged for openine:
day. There will be singing, recitations
and a stereoptlcon entertainment, fol
lowed by dancing and refreshments.
Kenichi's Money.
Thomas D. Riordan, counsel for Oyama
Kenichi, the young Japanese wanted In
Yokohama for forgery, yesterday had a
writ of certiorari issued by Judge de
Haven against. United States Commis
sioner Heacock in the matter of the
Commissioner's notion in reporting to the
court that Kenichi had been guilty of an
extraditable offense and because of his
having ordered United States Marshal
Baldwin to hold in his custody the money
found on the person of Kenichi when he
was arrested.
FLEET HOUNDS
WILL MEET
IN THE SLIPS.
There is money In the coursing at the
two parks this weekâ money for the dog
owners, money for the individual wise
enough to "pick 'em," and sport for all.
The management at Ingleside has pro
| viderl two stakes, an open event for the
! tried performers,- and a stake for sap
lings.
The former embraces in the entry about
the "hottest" aggregation of flyers that
I have been brought together on the sward
since Ingleside first threw open its gates.
The latter shows an array of youngsters
of whom more than one-half have never
been seen in the slips. â¢
The running begins to-day at 1 p. m.
and to-morrow at 11 a. m.
Without landing a stake, other than a
consolation, and with absolutely no os
tentation, the two dogs, Glenroy and Old
Glory, have pulled down for Deckel
man & Panario something like $375 since
the first of the year. This, too, in mere
stake money.
What the gentlemen have realized on
divers bits of pasteboards is confined to
conjecture.
Pat Rtilly has in his charge at Ingleside
one of the largest strings being trained in
this city. Improvements will shortly be
inaugurated at Ingleside, including a bet
tering of the field, improvements in the
grand stand and better accommodations
for dog owners.
In a communication to a weekly publi
cation last week a correspondent suggest
ed that the greyhounds should be classi
fied.
He alleged that a certain quartet of
owners, having acquired a little higher
class stock than their competitors, were
(pulling down everything. The classifica
tion idea, properly inaugurated, appears
to have much to commend it. But the
winning of stakes by good dogs should
not be belittled. It is ilie breeding and
successful rearing of the top notch stock
that has acted as an incentive to others
and lifted coast coursing above that of
the entire continent.
Comparing the Monday morning sum
maries of Ingleside and Los Angeles one
might be led to believe that several of
the greyhounds are playing engagements
after the manner of the London music
hall stars. Frequently Skyball, White
Chief and divers others may be seen per
forming in both cities on the same day,
Los Angeles should take up the matter
of registration.
Immediately after to-morrow's running
at Ingleside there will also be drawn a
consolation stake in the run down. This,
with the ties of the other events, will lie
pulled off to-morrow, and practically
means that the two days' running em
braces the courses of a seventy-two dog
stake.
At Union Park to-day the followers of
coursing should certainly enjoy some ex
cellent sport. No better hares than the
ones that have been selected for to-day's
coursing can be found on this side of the
Rocky Mountains.
Good harts, good judging and good slip
ping will make popular the grand old
sport in any demesne, and the managers
of Union Coursing Park have promised
all three of these things for to-day and
to-morrow.
The probable winners at Union Park to
day are: Open stakeâ Move On, Lady
Grace, Lady Perm, Bonita, Arapahoe,
Mountain Beauty, Forget, Promise Me,
For Freedom, Carmen. False Flatterer,
Bonanza, Sportsman. Blackstone. Rusty
Gold, Flying Buck, Vigilant, Commodore,
St. Alicia, SarnjÃell, Harkaway, Joy
Bells, Cavalier. PVar Not. Gannon Pasha.
Veteran stakeâ Skyrocket, Valley Queen,
Electric, Waratah.
FIRST-CLASS TENNIS
IN PLACER COUNTY.
Invitation tournaments are the fad at
present. To-day Penryn, Placer County,
will be the scene of a grand fete, the
final act of which will be a special match
of doubles between Robert N. Whitney
and George Bradshaw, and George Whit
ney and Walter Magee. Every prepara
tion has been made to have the fete a
glittering success. J. Parker Whitney,
one of the wealthiest land-owners in that
part of the country, has been the moving
factor in the celebration. Backed up by
the Citrus Club of Loomis, he has ar
ranged a programme of events which will
consume a full day in running. Special
trains will leave Marysville and Sacra
mento, and large crowds are expected to
attend the celebration.
The next invitation tournament will
have a gathering of the tennis champions
from the two enas of the State. The
tour champions of this section of the
State will go all the way to Ojaa \ alley,
in Ventura County, to meet the cracks
of the south. The two Whitney ireres
and the two Hardy freres will face J. C.
Cravens, ex-champion of Yale University
and ex-champion of Missouri, Kansas,
Nebraska and Iowa; L. R. Freeman,
champion of Southern California; O. S.
Picher, champion of Stanford University;
and R. A. Rowan, a winner of many
tournaments in Southern California. This
tournament will be held in the middle of
next month, under the auspices of the
Ojai Valley Tennis Club.
There has been no abatement in the
interest of the game at the California
Club grounds. A doubles tournament is
scheduled for this afternoon.

EVENTS TO COME.
The Turn Verein Cyclers of San Jose will
hold a five-mile handicap road race over
the Milpitas staightaway course to-mor
row morning at 10 o'clock. An aUempt
will be made to lower the record of U.:U4.
held by J. E. Wing, made by him in a
road race gA-en by this club April 11, WW.
The following are the entries and handi
caps for to-morrow's event: F. Hagen,
2 minutes; L. Haehnlen, P. Thiel, E. Cof
fin, 1 minute 30 seconds; F. Graul, J. bs

W. Sharp, 20 seconds; H. Schnittspan,
scratch. The handicapping was done by
C. J. Belloli.
Zerah Y. Howard and Robert A. Reid,
of the Bay City Wheelmen, completed a
trip last Saturday and Sunday of which,
they may well be proud. Leaving hero
Saturday afternoon they rode to Pesca
dero, via San Mateo and Spanishtown, to
view the wreck of the ship New York.
They returned the following day, ar
riving back here in time to occupy front
seats on the rooters" bench at the Bay
City-Acme baseball game early in the
afternoon. The distance traveled and the
roads and hills encountered characterize)
this as a particularly hard trip, and the
time in which they made it under these
conditions was remarkably fast.
The five-mile match road race on April
3 between L. R. Cofer, E. J. Bangs, C. W.
Schilling, Walter Macdonald, Arthur F.
Lundberg and R. P. Phillips is attracting
a good deal of attention in the Bay City
Club, of which the men are members. It
will be a scratch race, and Bangs Is the,
favorite in one or two infinitesimal wag
ers that have been made on the result.
Either Cofer, Lundberg or Macdonald
will probably show him their rear wheels
at the finish, however.
Arrangements have been made match-
Ing "Bob" Terrill, the crack professional,
and "Plunger Bill" Martin, who has just
returned from a two years' season in
Australia, for a five-mile pursuit race at
the Elmhurst track on Saturday after
noon, April 9. under a double sanction
from both the L. A. W. and the C. A. C.
C, the former controlling the men and
the latter the track. An amateur tandem
handicap at two miles will also be oh the
cards for the same day.
Martin has also been matched to ride
against Floyd A. McFarland, the San Josa
professional, in that city on April 8, under
the auspices of the Garden City Wheel
men. There is also some talk of a four
cornered unpaced match between Martin,
McFarland, Terrill and Otto Zeigler Jr.
This would be one of the best events in,
cycling racing ever held on the coast,
and should draw a big gate.
R. Gallegos. a prominent wheelman of
Mission San Jose, was : - town during the

will be a barbecue at destination.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen's regular
meeting will be hold next Tuesday even
ing. To-night there will be a home
trainer race, held in the bowling-alley at
the club. Three handsome prizes will be
awarded to the three members covering
the greatest distance in ten minutes, from
a flying start. The entries are as follows:

wheel.
The Smith-Wing match at Elmhurst
on April 3 is attracting a good deal of
interest around the clubs, particular. y at
San Jose and in the Olympic Club here,
where the men belong respectively. Since
Wing disposed of Wyman so easily last
Sunday the netting has slightly favored
his side, but Smith will undoubtedly have
the best pacing.
W. C. Brode of the Bay City Wheelmen
left on the steamer China Wednesday,
and just -before his departure was in re
ceipt of a touching evidence of his pop
ularity among his fellows at the club
in the shape of a handsomely engrossed
set of resolutions, signed by the memhers.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
ten-mile road-race on April 10, as a try
out for the relay race in May. There will
be a club run' to-morrow via 10 a. m.
boat, to Elmhurst. At some near future
date the club will hold a coasting race on
Balboa boulevard, to which all member 3
are eligible without training. "Has
beens" are particularly urged to enter,
Tom Doane and his ordinary being
barred, however. The club's annual run
to Blythedale will be held probably about
April 24.
A Southern California paper says that
Shoemaker of Riverside, Tabor of Cor
ona and Cromwell and Furman of Los
Angeles have been booked to ride in the
annual relay race May 8. Furman will
ride for the Bay City Wheelmen, unless
he turns professional before that time
under the pursuasions of the manager of
Elmhurst track.

Duplissea. August Nickel, James Sander
son. Arthur Wenle and Will Sperling. The
favorites are Arthur Wenle, Duplissea
and Sperling. Duplissea is the famous
oarsman of the South End Club, and is
said to be a crackajack on the wheel as
well.

Clausen Must Suffer.
The Supreme Court yesterday decided
that Charles Clausen must suffer ac
cording to the mandate of the Superior
Court for having knowingly received
stolen goods. Ho failed to reeister a
complete description in his books, as re
quired by the local ordinance governing
pawnshops, and he misrepresented the
facts to the police, who were tracing
property stolen by Burglar The
irregularity in the books and his decep
tion convinced the Supreme Court Jus
tices that there was no reason for revers
ing the Judgment of conviction of thÂ©
Superior Court.BOB FLINT
IS NOW A
PAUPER
Inherited a Fortune,
but He Recklessly
Squanders It.
Was in the Habit of Giv
ing Waiters Ten Dol
lar Tips.
Nearly One Hundred and Forty
Thousand Dollars Was Ex
hausted in Two Years.
IS SAID TO GO HUNGRY.
Capitalist J. K. Prior Now in Posses
sion or His Sixty Thou
sand Acres.
Having through fast living and an
over-generous nature parted with al
most every dollar he had, Robert Flint
of San Luis Obispo County will, on the
first of next month, lose all claim to
the magnificent property left him by
his father only two years ago.
Inheriting $40,000 at his parent's
death, he, like "Prince Carl" the tramp,
who found the $50,000 buried by the
train-robbers a few years ago, did not
know what to do with the money.
Right and left the tens and twenties
flew, until nothing remained but the
60,000 acres in Southern California.
By proper management this might
have been made to yield a princely in
come for life, but not so with young
Flint. He had tasted what seemed to him
the joys of high living, and hud been so
carried away with the glitter of a sport
ing life, that he began to make, inroads
on the valuable estate. J. K. Prior, the
man of countless thousands, was ap
pealed to and he humored the spend
thrift by loaning him thousands of dol
lars. At the end of a year the young
man had succeeded in throwing away
nearly $100,000.
To Flint money seemed made to scat
ter to the winds. As fast as he grot it
he allowed it to slip through his fin
gers as readily as water through a
sieve. One way of ridding- himself of
the borrowed gold was to gather a
score of friends who had gained his
good graces by flattery, and drive out
to suburban resorts and hold high car
nival. The waiter who removed his
coat was handed a ten-dollar gold
piece, the waiter who attended him at
the table was given an eagle, till in
fact he gave such handsome tips that
he became known as the "Ten-Dollar
Prince."
For a time it was thought the young
man had reformed. He was not seen
at his old haunts, and his absence was
noted. Inquiries developed the infor
mation that young Flint had embarked
in business. He fitted up the Marble
Market in sumptuous style, but as be
fore, his lack of financial ability as
serted itself, and the market in which
he had believed he would upbuild his
'waning fortunes, proved a losing invest
ment.
A.s Flint could not redeem his pledges
Prior instituted suit for the possession
of the realty pledged. The court
granted him a judgment of $113,000.
Six months passed and Flint, unable to
raise the necessary amount, asked and
was given a further extension.
A few months ago he nearly secured
Baron Yon Schroeder as purchaser of
the land. In fact, papers had been
signed, giving the Baron an exclusive
right of purchase, for which the latter
was to turn over his San Rafael prop
erty and a sum of money. At the last
moment the deal was broken, and
again the young man's hopes were
dashed to the ground.
Another instance of his looseness in
money matters was exemplified while
the deal between himself and Yon
Schroeder was on. He drew from the
California Bank his last three thou
sand dollars, and stuffing his pockets
with greenbacks invited a friend to ac
company him to the beach. The old
scenes were again enacted. Money was
thrown about like so much waste paper,
and on his return the next day he had
hardly enough to bu- dinner.
During the past month he has been
seen on the streets looking pale and
emaciated and causing his real friends
to worry over his condition. A gentle
man, in speaking about him last night,
said he was afraid "Bob" was going
without food. "He looks so bad that I
feel sorry for him," he added. "If I
could assist him I would do so, but he
is too proud to ask for aid or even
accept it."
J. K. Prior, who is now in possession
of the young spendthrift's property,
was seen last evening. Speaking about
his transactions with Flint he said:
"Under the old law," he said, "his
right to recover his property terminat
ed on the 29th of last May. I gave him
further extensions of time in the hope
that he might sell the property and
realize a profit.
"A man by the name of Tom Wilson
was given a contract by Bob to sell the
property for $175,000, and if successful
he was to be given 7 per cent. On the
strength of his contract he loaned Bob
$200. When the sale came off Wilson
and the rest of his crow wanted to ex
tort from me. They wanted to sell the
property in sections, knowing that if
they did it would ruin the ranch, as
one or two acres would have a spring
on it, which added to its value. They
tried to get him to instruct the Sheriff
to sell it in sections, but Bob had
strength enough to refuse.
"Failing in their attempt, they filed
suit in San L,ui ~ Obispo County to
establish their right to sell the prop
erty as they wanted to. As I consid
crc(] it a. scheme to blackmail me, I
decided to fight them. I did not in- .
tend giving them money to get out of
the way. Failing to get any satisfac
tion from me, they made application
to the court to. reject the sale, but it
refused to do so. They then appealed
to the Supreme Court, and the case is
still pending.
"I have foreclosed on the property
and taken possession, and have two
men down there looking after my in
terests. I rented the place to another
person, but his time has expired. I
gave Flint a certain length of time to
redeem the place at a certain price,
but the time for redemption is passed.
I got judgment against him for $113,000.
I originally loaned him $100,000, but the
balance was for interest and taxes.
"The property lies in San Luis Oblspo
County, and the San Juan River runs
through It. Owing to the lack of rain
end the stringent times we have be^n
unable to dispose of it. No "one wants
to buy, not caring to tie money up in
country property.
"It is certainly worth a great deal
more than the amount foreclosed on.
"When Flint fell into the property
he had $40,000 in the bank, 6000 head of
cattle, farm implements, horses, bug
gies, and in fact everything to run the
place with.
"As soon as he came into his rights
Clarke got him to insure his life and
succeeded in getting him to pay $f>ooo
on his premium. Clarke also got him
to start up this Marble market and
went in as manager, drawing a hand
some salary. Then shortly after that
Bob bean goincr in bad company,
which brought him to his present po
sition.
"Baron yon Pchroeder tried to gain
possession of this property but failed.
He wanted to exchange for it his San
Rafael propert" and was willing to add
money to the ocr,o _er, but I knew that the
San Rafael property was a white ele
phant on his hands and did not want
it. He tried to trade with Bob, but
that also feL through.
"The interest on the property, costs
of suits, lawyers' fees make the orig
inal sum run up to $125,000. I have
given Bob the privilege of selling at a
certain sum of money. Should he suc
ceed in selling it. I will make a deed to
the purchaser. He has until the first of
next month.
"I really want to help the young
man. but money is only a curse to
him."
CHARTER ELECTION
DAY, MAY 26
The Freeholders Have Completed Their
Labors in Framing an Organic
Law for This City.
The fifteen Freeholders, or those of
them who have attended to the framing
of the proposed charter, concluded their
labors at last night's session, and after
appending their names to the document
adjourned sine die.
The meeting was intended for this
.purpose only, but, ontrary to expec
tation, Mayor Phelan put in an appear
ance and pointed out a few errors in
the work of the Freeholders. He com
plained of the members for not consult
ing Clerk Russell of the Board of Su
pervisors on matters which, he thought,
would be advantageous to the work.
Chairman Britton called his Honor
down on this proposition and gave him
to understand that the Board of Free
holders would not be rebuked even by
the Mayor of the city. After a few
words of mild apology from the Chief
I gistrate he proceeded to explain that
funds as provided for in the charter
were not appropriated under their
proper heads. Freeholder Taylor, how
ever, straiehtened him out on this idea.
He next pointed out there wns no pro
vision for a contingent fund for the
Mayor. As the law now is the Mayor
has* $150 a- month for which he does not
have to render an account to any per
son. His next attack was on the elec
tion of nine of the Eighteen Supervis
ors from Senatorial districts. This, he
stated, was worse a thousand times
than the old ward system, from which
the city had suffered years ago; and
from which it had been rescued much
to its benefit.
"Leave the Senatorial district system
in the charter, and the bosses will own
the entire city for all time to comu," he
said.
The views of the Mayor were coin
cided in by ex-Mayor Ellert, who saw
the monster head of the Fire Depart
ment cropping up ready to gobble the
new City Hall at one gulp. Conse
quently, he moved to reconsider that
portion now. Other members became
converted to the danger, and one after
the other spoke in its favor except Tay
lor, who opposed it.
that they had changed their minds, as
A rollcall of the members showed
that they had changed their minds, as
nine voted for reconsideration and two
against it.
By this change of mind the Mayor
got $3600 a year contingent money for
which he will not have to account to
any person. And the Senatorial district
election of Supervisors was knocked out
and in its stead the eighteen City Fa
thers will be elected at large.
With these amendments the charter
was passed as a whole and received the
signatures of all of the Freeholders
present. It was moved by Mr. Clement
that 5000 copies of the charter be pub
lished for distribution. On motion, the
Law Committee was appointed an Au
diting Committee, with power to pay
all demands incurred by the Freehold-
I ers in preparing the charter, and also
to see to its election on May 26 be
fore the Election Commissioners, settle
all claims incurred by the Freeholders
in their charter making capacity and
also to attend to all arrangements be
fore the Election Commissioners in
' getting it before the people on May 26
as proposed.
Chairman Britton received a vote of
thanks for his courteous treatment of
the members during the many sessions
of the board; ,
WIFE-BEATING
BY A CHINESE
First Case in the History of
the Police Courts in
This City.
Ho Sun Ho Swears Out a Warrant
for the Arrest o! Her Hus
band, Wong Sing Yun.
For the first time in the history of the
police courts in this city a warrant was
issued yesterday for the arrest of a Chi
nese on the charge of wife beating.
Ho Sun Ho, a pretty little Chinese
woman, accompanied by Ging Dong, ap
peared before Judge Low, and Dong ex
plained to the Judge that she wanted her
j husband arrested for beating her. She
' had been driven out of her home by her
husband yesterday morning and wandered
around Chinatown asking some one to
direct her to the City Hall. A Chinese
peddler took pity upon her and went with
her to the hall, where they found Dong.
There were tears in her eyes as she
told her story to Dong, who acted as
I interpreter. Her husband is Wong Sing
Yun a manufacturer of shirts at 1017
Stockton street. They were married four
years ago by Rev. Jra M. Condit, superin
tendent of the Presbyterian Chinese
Church and Mission. They lived happily
together for two or three years and then
her husband began to beat her occasion
ally. He became worse in his conduct
toward her, and besides beating her, in
sulted her by telling her to pack up her
things and get out us he was tired of
her.
Yesterday morning he threw her out of
the house and told her never to comf
back. She suspected that he wanted to
get another wife, as they had no children,
and that made him cruel to her. The
warrant was obtained and Dong promised
to assist the police in seeing that it was
served upon the husband.

MASONIC FETE
IS BOOMING
Chairmen of Committees
Make Encouraging
Reports.
Many Novel Features Will Be
Presented in the Various
Booths.
Merchants Competing for the Privi
lege of Making Individual
Displays.
At St. John's Hall, Masonic Temple,
last night there was a meeting of about
300 people, representing the various
committees of the Masonic Festival to
be held at the Mechanics' Pavilion
from May 9 to 14, both dates inclusive.
Charles L. Patton acted as chairman
and Charles Conlisk as secretary.
The meeting was held for the purpose
of receiving reports from the chairmen
of the various committees of the differ
ent departments of the festival, which
is to be held for the purpose of raising
money to clear the Masonic Widows'
and Orphans' Home from debt.
The greatest enthusiasm prevailed
and the reports of committees evinced
assured success of the festival.
While a full report has not yet been re
ceived, the work already accomplished j
will give a fair outline of the scope of |
the festival. Many of the business |
houses of the city have promised to !
make liberal donations, and are vying
with each other for privileges to make
a display of their goods, which in most
instances will be sold and the money j
received therefor will be turned over to j
the committee for the benefit of the !
home. Principal among these is the ,
firm of Tillman & Bendel. who, if per
mitted to fit up their own booth, will
put at least $3000 worth of goods there
in, all of which will be sold and the re- j
ceipts given to the home.
W. Frank Pierce, chairman of the
committee on booths, reported that
there will be from forty to fifty booths,
and that many of them will represent
novel features. One of these struct
ures will be the $20 booth in which a
twenty-dollar gold piece will bo placed j
in a vessel filled with water. This will j
be in charge of Thomas Cunningham
of the Postal Telegraph Company, and
chances for permission to take the $20 ,
piece from the vessel will be sold for 25
cents. The successful person will befj
entitled to retain the coin and the
shock of electricity that goes with it.
At the newspaper booth a voting con
test will be conducted to determine j
which of the papers of San Francisco |
is most popular in the estimation of i
the patrons of the festival. The suc
cessful newspaper is to receive a fac
simile of a newspaper in solid sold.
Mrs. Dr. Edna R. Field reported that
she would have a model Masons' Home j
arranged, with furniture, kitchen uten- |
pils, etc. The bedroom will be fitted by
W. J. Sloane & Co. at an expense of
$1500. this to be sold for the benefit of j
the festival.
Mrs. K. J. Willatts, grand secretary
of the Eastern Stars, reported that
many of the interior chapters are pre- j
paring special features to be brought to ;
the festival. '
Frank Titus has secured about $1000 ;
worth of furniture from different
houses dealing in that line of goods.
The chairman of the entertainment
committee, C. L. P. Marais says that ;
the festival will be opened with a grand
chorus of 1000 voices.

JACOB SCHWEITZER DEAD.
One of the Most Prominent Mer
chants of the City Passes
Away.
Jacob Schweitzer, a prominent Jewish
merchant of the city and partner in the
firm of Schweitzer & Levy, wholesale
butchers, succumbed to a brief illness at
his home at 10 o'clock last Thursday
evening.
Deceased was prominent in all Jewish
circles and was a member of the Con
cordia Club. He came to this coast in
1554 nnd opened a country store in Sono
ma County. Later, in 1868, he located in
this city and organized the firm which
now bears his name. Ever since this
time he has occupied the premises on
Clay and Leidesdorff streets, which is
now one of the old land marks of this
section of the city.
His business career has been a most
successful and honorable one, and during
thirty years he has been associated with
the firm he has amassed a large
fortune, the exact proportions of which
are at present unknown, but it is esti
mated between $200,000 and $300,000.
The decedent leaves a widow and eight
children to mourn his loss.
The funeral services will be held at the
family residence on Post street, Sunday
afternoon at 2 o'clock, and will be con
ducted by Rabbi Voorsangrer of the Tem
ple Emaiiu-El. The body will be Interred
in the Home of Peace Cemetery in San
Mateo County.
NO BOULEVAKD FOB B JSH.
Supervisors Will Take the Matter
Under Consideration.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided Thursday to let tne
matter of declaring a boulevard on Bush
street rest for the next sixty days.
Representatives of the advocates of the
boulevard urged that the board take im
mediate action in the matter on the
ground that the value of property on
Bush street from Dupont street west was
constantly being depreciated by the pres
ent condition of the street.
The opponents of the boulevard said
that the only salvation for property on
the thoroughfare was the building of a
railroad on the street. They called at
tention to the fact that the grades on
the street preclude the passage of teams
on certain portions and that these blocks
must remain in their present state until
they arc in some way improved. They
believed that the only way to bring prop
erty values up to their proper standard
was to allow the street to remain open
for th*- building of a street railroad.
The Street Committee was evidently im-
Cressed with the arguments of the anti
oulevaxd people, for it laid the matter
over for sixty days for a more tÃorough
investigation.

CURBS AND
CEMENT IN
OAKLAND
Object Lessons in the
Paving of East
Twelfth Street.
Clever Twisting of the
Specifications for the
Concrete Bed.
Granite Curbs From Folsom
State Prison Are Used
on the Job.
AN INSPECTOR'S RECORD.
Prison Material Comes Billed by Rail
to W. O. Badyley, a Shareholder
of the Paving Company.
Oakland has a beautiful scheme of
improvement. As the plan is extensive
and in a measure experimental it has
attracted the attention of The Call's
expert in street paving. The progres
sive citizens of Oakland decided to
pave East Twelfth street from First to
Thirteenth avenue with redwood
blocks on top of concrete. The story
goes that considerable influence was
needed to get a wooden block specifica
tion. Seven lumber companies, it is
said, had to unite in the pull for the
blocks.
The proposed improvement will cost
$42,000, of which amount the city of
Oakland pays one-half and the inter
ested property owners on the line of
the avenue the other half. On the first
proceeding to pave the avenue the con
tract was awarded to a San Francisco
firm, but a technical objection was pre
sented and the proceedings were re
opened. On the second deal the con
tract was given to the East Oakland
Paving and Contracting Company.
The method of preparing specifica
tions in Oakland differ somewhat from
the fashion followed in San Francisco.
Over there the City Engineer, who is
an elective officer, prepares the specifi
cations and establishes the grade.
Then the Street Superintendent, who is
appointed by the Board of Public
Works, comes forward and carries out
the work, with the assistance of in
spectors appointed by himself.
For the East Twelfth street paving
the Engineer made capital specifica
tions. For concrete bed he designated
elements in this proportion: One un
broken barrel of cement, containing
three and four tenths cubic feet; three
cement barrels of sand and eight ce
ment barrels of rock. It seems that
anybody should understand this speci
fication. In due time Marsden Camp
bell, who says thai he is a candidate
fo City Engineer of Oakland, \v ; is ap
pointed to inspect the work. He has a
record as a graduate from the San
Francisco Harbur Commissioners'
School of Assistant Engineers, lie was
mentioned in the court testimony re
cently as an inspector who acccopted
undersized piling timber on the State
work.
As the work progresses In Oakland
Campbell stays with the rock. The sta
tion, seven blocks distant, where the
sand and cement are mixed, does not
receive the careful supervision of the
inspector. The men of the contracting
company look after affairs at the point
where the cement comes in. At the
mixing station there is a box three by
four feet, containing twelve cubic feet.
This box is for sand. On top of the
sand is another box. This one, two by
two feet, holds four cubic feet. This
box is for cement, but it has no bot
tom. Cement is originally placed in the
barrel under hydraulic pressure. When
the barrel is opened and the pressure
relieved the bulk expands in the two by
two box from three and four-tenths
cubic feet to four and a half cubic
feet. The mixed sand and cement Is
then hauled seven blocks to the rock
on the street. One barrel of the mix
ture is used to every thirty-three cubic
feet of rock, whereas the real propor
tion, according to the specification,
should be one barrel for every twenty
seven cubic feet of rock.
It is calculated that there should be
used on the entire job, according to the
specifications of the engineer, 3000 bar
rels of cement. Under the measurement
of the Street Superintendent and in
spector less than 2300 barrels will be
used.
Cement of the brand used, the Hil
ton, costs laid down in Oakland about
$2 85 a barrel. It is not improbable that
the contractors will save $1960 on ce
ment alone.
Oaklanders will be delighted to lparn
that the East Oakland Paving and Con
tracting Company is using on the East
Twelfth-street job .granite curbing
hewn and dressed at Folsom Prison.
How the law forbidding: the competi
tion of prison labor with the labor of
free men is evaded is not clear at pres
ent. The Board of Prison Directors
may be able to throw some light on this
branch on the subject.
The story concerning- the use of the
Folsom prison granite presents some
striking features. Observations of the
work made on behalf of The Call
pointed directly to the use of the prison
dressed stone for the curbs, but the
paper hesitated to believe that the East
Oakland Paving and Contracting- Com
pany was advisedly using tho product
of convict labor. Verification of the
report was demanded. When Prison
Director Fitzgerald was asked whether
such material was in the market he re
plied that Warden Aull of Folsom was
under some obligation to supply Oak
land with granite curbs. Tracing the
subject further it was ascertained that
W. O. Badgley. a real estate and in
surance man of Oakland, was able to
obtain granite curbs from Folsom.
Further inquiry disclosed the fact that
the curbs from Folsom came by rail
billed to Badgley, but that the East
Oakland Paving Company received the
material and paid the charges. Ad
hering to the same thread a journey
was made to the clerk's office and
there it was found that Mr. Badgley
was a shareholder of the East Oakland
Paving and Contracting Company.
When Mr. Badgley was asked if he
could supply curbs of the style which
engaged the attention of The Call's ex
pert he inquired as to the quantity re
quired and gave the price at which he
could supply a small lot at 45 cents a
lineal foot on the cars at Folsom. Sur
prise being expressed at the high figure
Mr. Badgley called attention to the ex
cellence of finish and the general
beauty of the curbing. It was suggest
ed by Mr. Badgley that the customer
should call again, when more accept
able figures might be submitted. When
first asked where the granite came
from Badgley said at a point above
Sacramento. When the response sug
gested Rocklia as the place Mr. Badg
ley said, "Oh, no; the other direction."
The interesting part of the Oakland
experiment will begin when the con
tractors introduce the asphaltum to
coat the blocks and cover the roadway.
The work may be performed so scien
tifically that the redwood blocks will
not shrink during periods of dry
weather and expand ivhen the moisture
of warm rains is admitted. If the
pavement does. not break or bulge in
the crown of the roadway or displace
the curbs in the pressure of expansion
it will be a surprise to those who have
noted the action of the elements on
wooden pavements in San Francisco.
BADGLEY'S CONTRACT.
It Calls for the Delivery of Stone
at Folsomâ Warden Aull's In-
terpretation of the Law.
FOLSOM, Cal., March 25.â Curbing is
being sold to Contractor W. O. Bad
gley, 111S Broadway, Oakland, presum
ably to be used on city contracts. The
constitution does not prohibit such
sale. San Quentin is restricted to jute
bags, but Folsom has no restrictions.
The Board of Prison Directors under
Governor Waterman's administration
authorized the Warden to sell such
stone as he could. Statutes of 1889,
page 404, govern the case. (See sec
tion 18, page 408. Also see Senate con
current resolution No. 9, page 451,
statutes of 1895.) The sales amount to
two or three hundred dollars a year.
The prison has been selling some for
the past ten years. Warden Aull con
siders the resolutions and statutes of
1895 as commanding him to sell all he
can. Crosswalk and cemetery stone
are also sold. Badgley's contract calls
for stone delivered at Folsom.
WILL APPEAR FOR CONTEMPT.
Judge Morrow Will Question Officers
of the Klamath River Lum
ber Company.
Members of the Klamath River Lumber
Company have been cited to appear be
j fore Judge Morrow for contempt for not
| having obeyed an injunction ordering
them to refrain from entering on the
property which was under the possession
of the Pokegama Sugar Pine Lumber
Company. Marshal Gallagher went to
the place and after considerable trouble
J. R. Cook, W. E. Cook, J. S. Cook, H. B.
Gillis, George W. Marsh, G. Morris and
Henry Martin are those ordered to ap
< pear.
It is stated the men forcibly kept pos
session of the property at the advice of
: Attorney H. B. Gillis of Yreka, and they
I were assisted in their work by men who
had been employed by them prior to
the trouble over the property. The in
junction had been issued over a week ago
and hence the citation.

"I know a Mrs. Curry, who lives in Tennessee," said the
Professor, "who never had any trouble with her health, asid*
from rheumatism, until after she was sixty years of age, but
then there came some derangement of the digestive organs, and
at the suggestion of her daughter, with whom she was living,
she tried Ripans Tabules and was benefited immediately. Now
she keeps them in the house all the time, and generally takes
one just after eating. She finds that it cures any irregularities
of the bowels, and says that, in her opinion, no family should
ever be without a supply of Ripans Tabules in the house."

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal ,
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal j
temperature. The word "high" meani high
barometric press-re and Ib usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low prea
â¢ure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When i
the pressure is high In the Interior and low I
alone the coast, and the Isobars extend north i
and \=outh along the coast, rain Is probable; !
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce aa
eppcslte result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 25.â To-day's closing
prices were the lowest in most cases since the
Cuban question became a dominant factor in
the situation. Twenty active shares averaged
lower than at any time this year, and Gov
ernment new 4s coupon were down to 119%
bid. This was on the assumption that new
issues were possible if expenditures for war
purposes continued long. Before the battleship
Maine was blown up they were quoted above
12S. It was freely predicted that the Maine
report would be extremely unfavorable. The
market opened with quotations slightly below
â yesterday's final figures. The bears, however,
were determined to bring about a substan
tially lower level and hammered many of the
leading stocks vigorously in an endeavor to
precipitate liquidation. The local transporta
tion shares and Sugar were the most vulner
able points of attack and the extreme weak
ness in those specialties was soon communi
cated elsewhere. Numerous stop loss orders
â were expected, and the market for a time took
on a very animated appearance, with losses
ranging between 1 and 3 per cent during the
first half hour's operations. Purchases for
London account and an effort on the part of
some traders to rally prices gave a steadier
tone, which, however, was accompanied by ex
treme stagnation. As the day progressed the
market dipped frequently, but there was an
absence of feature in the general speculation
until the final hour, when extensive liquida
tion set in, which depressed the bulk of the
high-priced specialties to the lowest figures of
the day. Washington houses were sellers, and
it was inferred that they might have some inti
mation of the nature of the Maine report.
Bucar was down 3^, partly on fear of the
proximity of increased competition In the
trade. The steady decline in this stock tended
to color recent reports that Inside support had
been withdrawn for the time being. The
break In Northern Pacific preferred of 1%, ac
companied as it was by weakness in Canadian
Pacific, was taken to indicate something un
favorable as forthcoming in regard to the rate
war. New York Central and the Grangers
showed little resistance to attack. There was
a further engagement for import of a moderate
amount of gold, making the total of the present
movement, including that from Australia,
nearly $35, 000, CO"). The foreign exchange market
exhibited heaviness to-day and some conces
sions were noticed In rates.
Quotations for railway mortgages continued
to sag on light offerings, which for the most
part consisted of usually active speculative
liens. The total transactions were $1,100,000.
Government bonds displayed extreme weak
ness, the new 4s coupon and registered and old
4s coupon yielding 1 per cent in the bid price;
the old 4s registered suffered to the extent of
I 1?I 1 ? and the 5s coupon and reclstered lost '4
each.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 546.000
shares, Including: Burlington, 32,427; Louisville
and Nashville. 6135; Manhattan, 20,575: Metro

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 25.â Wheat opened weak
and lower on the ' extremely heavy shipments
from Argentine, that country contributing 2,
360,000 bushels during the week, compared with
one-tenth of that amount in the same week
last year. Liverpool cables showed declines
in that market averaging %d, part of which j
was quickly recovered, however. From S2%@ j
S2V4C at the' start, July fell to 82c, and held i
steady at that figure for some time, rallying,
occasionally to 82% c only to be pounded down
again. As the session progressed the market
became still heavier, July finally tumbling to
81% c. War talk had undoubtedly much to do
I do with the decline, which was accompanied by
I heavy liquidation. Professionals covered freely
from 82c down, but the offerings more than
satisfied them. Reports that the Servian im
port duty on â  Wheat and Corn had been re
moved and a cablegram stating that the po
tato crop in the United Kingdom was the
smallest since 1884 had little or no effect.
Sales of thirty boat loads at the seaboard and
the Modern Miller report alleging serious dam
i age to the growing crov in California, Ne
braska, Kansas and Texas during the recent
cold wave started a buying movement near the
close which rallied prices a full cent. May sold
between $1 03 and $1 04, closing at $1 04. July
opened Me lower at 82Â«4@S2^c, sold off to SlVic
and closed at S2VÂ»@B2V*c sellers.
Corn shared in .the general weakness. The
recovery In ' Wheat near the end had a bene
ficial effect. May closed Vie lower.
Oats suffered a decline of Vi@%c for May
delivery, and 4Â® Vie for July, on moderate
trading. Longs were the chief sellers. The
weakness in Wheat and Corn had a good deal
to do with the heaviness that prevailed.
Provisions were weak and selling: of Pork
more especially was urgent for j a long time.
The steadier feeling in the grain markets near
: the end of the session had a somewhat re
! assuring effect and caused the recovery of some
of the early decline. May Pork showed a loss
of -274 c a barrel at one time, and of 174 cm
the end. Lard and Ribs were relatively less
weak. â¢ The former . lost for â¢ the day 24@oc
and the latter 24@5c for May, with July leav
ing off at Thursday's prices. i >

FRUIT IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, March 23.â The Journal of Com
merce rays: The frequent reports of frost
damage to the fruit crops In California and
the statements made by each mall of late,
and also by telegraph, that the crops were
suffering from lack of rain, seems to have had
no influence to stimulate speculative or even
to Increase the consuming demand In any line
with the exception of apricots, which sold
freely in Eastern markets for immediate de
livery, It is reported, while spot stocks of all
desirable qualities have been closely absorbed.
The market, however, has not advanced ma
terially. The interest In peaches has not ex
tended beyond the limits of the jobbing trade,
but In view of the fact that many sellers here
were instructed to-day by their principals on
the Coast to withdraw offerings, the- tone of
the market was decidedly better, although no
advance in spot quotations was made.
The situation In dried fruits, in spite of re
ports from California. Is still somewhat unset
tled on the spot. It is held by many in the
trade that the coming crop in California might
be much more seriously damaged than indi
cated by the reports so far received and yet
leave a supply that would be fully adequate
to all home requirements and leave a consider
able surplus to be exported. In fact, there
seems to be a general Indisposition to accept
reports of a total ruin of the crop, because
somewhat similar reports in the past nave
been later disproved, and this is shown in the
entire absence of speculative demand at pres
ent for spot goods.
FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. March 25.â Bradstreefs Flnan- ]
clal Review to-morrow will say: A dull and
nervous tone has prevailed in speculative clr- :
cles. and while the market has been generally
weak and lower, several slight rallies were
produced by the short interest. Attention has |
D een centered to even a greater extent than In !
the preceding weeks on the relations between
Spain and the United States and the probability
of matters in that connection coming to a j ,
head. The public is entirely out of the market ;
and the larger interests are also taking com
paratively little active Interest, though for
eigners were sellers to some extent. The pro- j
fessional and semi-professional element has
evidently prepared for any emergency by Bell-
Ing stocks right and left. Indeed, the liquida
tion of weak long holdings has been so com
plete that the further declines failed to bring
any noticeable selling by commission houses. â 
On the other hand, the borrowing demand for i
stocks throughout almost the whole active list
has t*>en evidently increasing from day to day
and has at times assumed an unwleldly appear
ance In spite of the absence of any buying
power.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, March 2o.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
| Weekly Review of Trade will say in to-mor
row's Issue: A waiting state of things always
I binders business to some extent. With more .
' than $34,000,000 gold received or on its way
since the movement began, with ample bank
reserves and treasury reserves and a redemption
â¢ of notes in all ways nearly a third smaller
than in February, to date, with no stringency
iti the money market and stfrllnjj exchange
weak, with the volume of business at clearing
; houses outside New York larger than in IM<2
! by 6.9 per cent this month, and with failures
I nearly 3U per cent smaller than In the same
month of 1892, there is not much visible ground
i for panic, even if earnest efforts should fall to
; keep peace with honor. Warlike reports come
every day, and stock operators make the most
! of them, and yet the average of prices of rail
| road stocks Is $53 OS against $53 20 two weeks
afeo to-day. Nor have industrial operations
j been perceptibly affected except where extra
| ordinary buying for some weeks past has made
necessary a pause for breath, so to speak, or
where unnatural prices had caused a halt be
j fore the destruction of the Maine. Some de
crease in new engagements would be expected
I with war apparently near. But as yet scarcely
any Indication of decrea.se for that reason is
I seen. It is difficult to take dismal views when
i the nation is surpassing all records in market-
Ing products. Atlantic exports of wheat for
the week have been 2 ISO.S2rt bushels, against
1,272.286 last year, and in four weeks. 9.302.514.
i flour included, against 5,103,425* last year, with
Pacific exports 4.232.H32. against 899,242 last
year. The price has declined 2% cents, but the
! heavy shipments and contracts for export are
'â  having a constant Influence.
| Sales of wool have been only 11.411,600 pounds
â¢ in three weeks, at the three chief markets,
against 46,605.300 pounds last year, and quo
tations are yielding, with sales of old wool
'iftilc below current quotations for clothing,
and no Indication that manufacturers are near
ing the end of their stocks.
Cancellations are numerous, but in proportion
j to orders smaller than for five years past, and
find natural explanation in an advance of
prices greater in some lines than distribution
seems to warrant. Yet the mills are nearly all
full of orders for some months to come, and
' rather more demand for gooas Is seen since
I colder weather appeared.
The Iron and steel Industry is more fully
employed than ever before in its history, and
although production of bessemer pig is be
yond all precedent, the price advances and bil
lets are still bought in open market by some of
the largest producers. Other pig Is steady in
proportion, and no decline appears in finished
products, excepting steel plates at the East,
but for these the demand at Chicago is enor
mous as for cars and agricultural Implements
materials, pending orders for cars covering
500 to 2000 each. The structural demand during
the first quarter was SO per cent larger than In
the same quarter any previous year, and It Is
said the demand for pip* 1 Is swelled by pend
ing contracts for 126 miles. Minor metals are
| comparatively quiet: tin at 14.3 cents: lake
copper at 12 cents; lead firm at 3.7 cents, and
nickel in heavy demand at 34 cents.
Failures for the week have been 251 In the
| United States against 291 last year, and 21 In
Canada against 50 last year.
BRADSTREET' S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. March 2.".â Rradstreet's to-mor
row will say: The favorable features of the
week in distributive trade have been the rÂ»
ports coming, with few exceptions, from all
parts of the West and Northwest, and marred
only by the checks to business and shipments
caused by heavy rains Rn.i htgh water in the
Ohio Valley. The unsettled condition of our
relations with Spain is credited with exercis
ing some effect upon immediate demands and
upon future undertakings in the eastern por
tion of the country. But the two industries,
cotton and woolen, most complaining, are
those In which conditions other than foreign
complications have for some time past been
working toward depression. The coarse cot
ton goods situation does not Improve In any
way, and declines In print cloths to a still ]
lower record quotation, rendering ineieasingly !
Imminent action by manufacturers toward cur
tailing production in this line. While some
woolen goods mills have already booked good
orders, the business as a whole has not
been up to anticipations. Raw wool, however,
does not reflect the rather unsatisfactory con
dition in the manufactured product in lower
quotations. The condition of the iron and
steel trade Is one which excited satisfaction
and almost surprise. From a number of wide
ly separated sections the report comes of un
precedented activity in nearly all branches of
the trade. Pigiron is higher at several mar
kets and efforts toward harmonizing produc
tion elements in crude ami manufactured pro
ducts are being assiduously pushed. Modern
steel plants are reported rushed with orders
and consumers' demands more than keep up
with the deliveries. Western steel men are re
ported buying billets in the East, while East
prn ship builders are buying steel plates in
the West.
The price situation this week Is notable In
showing decreases more numerous than for
some time past. This, of course. Includes
many lines in which speculation plays a
marked part. The passing of the cold wave,
with little or no reported damage to the grow
ing winter wheat, coupled with the forward
movement of agricultural matters and the an
ticipated hlgli acreage in spring wheat, is
credited with much of the depressing influence
manifested In cereals this week. Aiding this,
of course. Is the dlsmuragement of specula
tion by the Strong statistical position of the
Immense wheat supplies and the uncertainty
as to our political relations. The position of
the flour trade Is unsatisfactory for several rea
sons: business Is re ported as dragging a.n<l
production may l>e reglMted.
Klour and corn exports are larger this weefc,
but those of wheat are smaller. The total ex
ports "f wheat. Including flour, aggregate 3.
896,318 bushels, against 3.679.056 bushels last
week: 1,749,100 bushels in this week a year ago;
1,744/00 bushels In 1596. 2,562.000 bushels In 1895
and 2.966,000 bushels In IS!>4.
Business failures in the United .States this
week are 216, against 233 last week. 221 In this
week a year ago, 276 in ISS6 and 232 in IS9Â».

â  The circular of Jacob Wollner says: "The
Wool 'markets, :. both i local' and : Eastern, â  are
Incomprehensible as j with the foreign markets
â¢tronx and advancing and stocks snort, and the
strong demand and advancing prices at the
London sales now in progress, there is hardly
any- Woo! selling in America. The sales in
the three largest Eastern markets, Boston,
New York and Philadelphia, show a falling off
since the Ist of January of this year of 60.000,
000 "pounds, and there is no demand whatso
ever at the time of the present writing. How
long this dull spell is going to last without
affecting the prices now asked for wool it, Is
hard to foretell. One thing is certain, that
America cannot import Wool at the prices now
prevailing In Europe. Prices asked in ; this
country are still from 3c to 5c below the im
porting point. ,
"The supposition is that the mills are using
their purchases made in 1897 and will not go
into the market until their old stock is ex
hausted and they can get a further advance
on manufactured goods. : - .
"Another cause of the inactivity of the wool
market is the war scare. If we have war of
course it may make the., market somewhat
duller for the time, but it will react favorably
on the market later. <
"Shearing is In active progress In the south
ern part of the State, but the wools are not
quite as good as. they were last year. There
is very little selling the country and so far
the arrivals of Wool In this market from the
Ist of Jaunary to this date are 3100 bales less
than last year. Very little new Wool has
come forward so far.

THE AUDITOR
IS SUSTAINED
Dalton's Assessment of the
Adams Property Is
Valid.
The City Board of Equalization Has
Their Riyht of Review-
Upheld.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 23.
The suit of Edson F. Adams ro recover
taxes paid the City of Oak'.anl under
protest on the Adams estate property
north of the lake, was decided in favor
of the city this morning by Judge Hall.
The plaintiff was represented by Harvey
S. Brown, while City Attorney W. A.
Dow and Assistant S. W. Condon repre
sented the. city's interests.
The property was assessed for $456,200
In 1896. The Board of Equalization re
duced this to $289,000. City Assessor R.
W. Snow accepted Mr. Dalton's figures
and made his returns for that much.
The representatives of the estate ap
peared before the City Board of Equal
izers and sought to have the same reduc
tion as made by the county board, but
this was refused. The tax under the city
assessment amounted to $4051 42, while the
county assessment would only nave made
It $2'J27 90. Mr. Adams paid the whole
amount under protest, and sued to re
cover the $1521 52.
The contention made was that the
City Assessor must accept the figures
fixed by the County Board of Equalizers,
being without power to fix a valuation
himself. Mr. Black also attacked Judge
Grtene's decision made last week, in
which he held that tax money paid could
not be recovered. He held that it was
a technical point which was not in ac
cord with the intent of the law.
Attorney Dow responded by presenting
the city charter, in which there is no
reference to the County Board of Equali
zation. It provided for the fixing of the
city assessment by the County
Assessor's figures. and he did not
believe that it contemplated the equal
izers in any way. As the rolls were turned
over to the Auditor on the first Monday in
August it was an impossibility to accept
the revised rolls as a basis of taxation.
Goodall-Comstock Nuptials.
OAKLAND, March 23.â Captain Charles
Minor Goodall and Mrs. Marion Cullen
Comstock will be married to-morrow at !
the home of the bride's parents in East |
Oakland. It will ho a very quiet wedding '
with only the immediate family in at- ,
tendance. The ceremony will be per
formed by the Rev. Dr. Breck, a cousin ;
of the bride. After the ceremony, bride
and groom will leave on a short honey
moon trip. Mrs. Comstock is a widow
with one child, and is one of the most
charming women in Oakland. Prior to
her first marriage she was a Miss Cullen
of East Oakland and a social belle. Re- j
cently she has resided with Mrs. H. R. i
Hunt at Glen Echo.
Annexation Suit Decision.
OAKLAND. March 25.â Judge Hau has i
lnumated that he will render a decision !
on Monday on t..0 annexation test case. |
It is entitled. "The Suit of the People, on !
the Relation of. Thomas Cuff, against the i
<.ity of Oakland," and attacks the valid- i
Jty'of the entire portion of territory an
m'xefl last fa â¢ 'me decision will be a
short oral one in favor of the city, If the
Intimations thus far made go for aught,
iviuch interest is being manifested in me
outcome of this suit, and if favorable to
the city it means much for that portion, as
well fl " s in politics. It is not likely that
the â¢ ase will be a pealed, unless the deci
sion is against the city.
Miss Meads' Death.
OAKLAND. March 25.â Miss Eloa E. !
Meads, the U-year-old daughter of Pro- i
NT.Mris, of the high school, died this ;
afternoon of inflammation of the base of
the" l.raln. She has been studying hard
in school, and in the preparation for the |
anniversary of Washington's birthday she
overdid herself. After the exercises she
returned home greatly exhausted and
nervously excited. She went to bed and
never rallied thereafter.

THE PROPOSED
SCHOOL DEAL
Monster Protest to Be
Presented to the
Council.
Sanitary Condition Claimed
to Be Better* Than
Others.
Half the Money Put in Improving the
Surroundings Would Be of
More Value.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, March 25.
The attempt to move the Tompkins
School from its present location on Fifth
street, between Linden and Chestnut, to
Castro street, between Eighth and Ninth,
is not to be accomplished without opposi
tion. The residents for whom the school
was built and whose children are to be
affected are largely opposed to the move
ment. They declare that on the state
ment of Superintendent McClymonds be
fore the City Council Monday evening, if
for none other, the removal of the school
should not be allowed.
When the resolution was introduced Mr.
McClymonds was asked if the pupils from
north of Seventh street were as numerous
as those from the south side. He an
swered in the negative, but claimed that
it was an additional six biocKs for part
of them to walk. He said the scnool
lacked 200 of being full. Now the parents
claimed that all but a few of the lowest
grades are full and point with the linger
of scorn to the Cole School, as far as
health is concerned. There has never
been an epidemic in the Tompkins School,
while the Cole was closed owing to diph
theria. , . . .
William D. Macdonald, who is in busi
ness directly across the street from the
school, and lives there, prepared a peti
tion yesterday protesting a-gainst the re
moval of the school, and last evening
spent an hour carrying.it from house to
house for signatures. It was signed near
ly one hundred tintes, and to-night he
was at work again. He believes that he
can present a protest that will bear some
weight, either with the Board of Edu
cation or the City Council. The protest is
as follows:
OAKLAND. March 24. IR9B.
j To the Honorable the Council of the City of
Oaklandâ Gentlemen: The undersigned resi
dents and tax-payers in the vicinity of Tomp
klns School beg leave to protest against the
removal of the school from its present loca
tion to the block on Castro street, between
Eighth and Ninth. By removing the school
you will leave a large district unprovided with
school facilities. The locality is thickly set
tied, and a large number of children in that
portion of the city bounded from Kirkham to
Market street attend there. If they are caused
to attend the school on Castro'street, they will
be obliged to cross the steam railroad track
and street railroad track, thereby creating
wi.rriment to the parents.
There can be no reasons for the removal
from the present site, as it Is now in sanitary
condition: all the children are healthy, and the '
class rooms are filled with pupils.
Another reason we desire to call your atten- ;
tlon to, is that quite a number of poor people ;
have bought their little homes near the school
in order that their children could have the
benefit of education: another, that no excuse
can be offered on grounds of removal for sani
tary reasons, aÂ« our children are healthier,
and more of them to the lot than any part of
Oakland. If the Brard of Education desires to
remove the building for 6altary purposes,
why it Is absurd, as the Cole School pupils
were in danger of epidemic from diphtheria, and
no mention was made to remove the building.
We beseech your honorable body to .indefi
nitely postpone the ordinance, and not to de
prive our children of education. Respectfully
submitted.
"If the city -wants to help that dis
trict." said Mr. Macdonald to-night, "why
not improve the surrounding: property by
making a park there? Half the money
spent for removing the school put into
improvements around tne school would
raise the pric<* of property and nelp the
city's welfare."
GRAND JURORS' ACTION.
Judge Ellsworth Refuses to Allow
Them to Be Questioned
in Court.
OAKLAND, March 25.â Attorney Moore
attacked the validity of the accusation
under which Supervisor Charles Roeth is
being tried before Judge Ellsworth. This
move was made this afternoon when the
defense called R. D. Hunter, a member
of the Grand Jury which indicted Mr.
Roeth, and asked him 1/ lie had voted for
the Indictment.
District Attorney Snook objected on the
ground that the question was incompe
tent, irrelevant and immaterial and not
touching an issue in the case. He further
declared that it was a contempt of court
In asking such a question as it tended to
disturb the privacy of the Grand Jury,
which the law forbids. If such a question
were permitted, he declared, the Grand
Jury's actions would be public affairs and
every man's vote used against him after
ward.
Mr. Moore asked if he could be allowed
to prove that the accusation was returned
by a part of the jury or all of them, as it
was only signed by the foreman and sec-
retary.
"I don't believe it a matter to be raised
here, and I don't know that it can be
raised anywhere else," answered the
Court.
Henry Beamer. another member of the
jury, was called and asked the same ques
tion., but did not answer on the objection
of District Attorney Snook.
"Were all of the members of the Grand
Jury present the day the accusation was
voed upon?" was the next question shut
off by an objection.
"We desire to show." said Mr. Moore,
"that the accusation was not the work of
the Grand Jury, but of certain members
of that body."
TIRED OF SUFFERING.
Mrs. J. Armstrong Uses a Revol
ver but Does Very Little
Harm.
OAKLAND, March 25.â Mrs. J. Arm
strong, wife of an engineer of the San
Francisco and San Joaquln Valley Rail
road Company, made a desperate attempt
to end her sufferings at tÂ».e family resi
dence, 556 Forty-seventh street, just be
fore noon to-day by shooting herself with
a revolver. She fired three shots, none of
which is necessarily fatal.
Mrs. Armstrong has been a sufferer
from neuralgic pains during a recent ill
ness, and it is supposed she sought relief
in this manner.
One bullet was aimed for her heart, but
went wide of its mark and slipped along
a rib, lodging near the back, in the fleshy
part of her body. Another shot, aimed at
the temple, made only a flesh wound, and
the third shot just grazed the skin, being

Dr. B. T. Mouser, the family physician,
pronounced the wounds as not dangerous,
and did not remove the bullet from her
back until to-night. Mr. Armstrong was
telegraphed for at Stockton, and Is ex

Did Albert Church Consent?
OAKLAND. March 25.â The suit of Mrs.
Sarah Church to have the marriage of
her son, Albert T. Church, with Miss
Angle rotter annulled is not believed to
have the sanction of the youthful hus
band. He Is in school in the East, and
no word has been received from him, but
it is known that he is well p.eased with
his selection, ana without his consent the
action cannot secure a standing in court.
Neither the bride nor her mother will
make a statement regarding the affair.

a new high school building on the pres
ent site of the Kellogg School, will be
held to-morrow. The polls will be open

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 2G, 1898.
has been waged over the question of is
suing the bonds, and the outcome of the
vote is a matter of speculation. Consider
able of the opposition manifested is di
rected at the manner of raising the money
â i. c., by bonds rather than by a dlr'ect
tax.
PERRINE'S COMET APPROACHES.
Traveling Toward the Earth at the
Bate of About a Million Miles
a Day.
BERKELEY March 25.â According to
computations just completed by the de
partment of astronomy at Berkeley the
comet discovered by Astronomer Perrlne
at Mount Hamilton last Sunday morning
has been approaching the earth ajid sun
at the rate of a million miles a day. The
computations were based upon two ob
servations at Mount Hamilton and one
observation at Berkeley by Professor
Leuschner, and were made by Tracy R.
Crawford, on assistant, and H. K.
Palmer, a senior student at Berkeley.
"According to our calculations." said
Professor Leuschner, "the comet ap
proached the earth at the rate of a mil
lion miles a day for several days after its
discovery. The rate of approach, how
ever, is diminishing. On April 6 its dis
tance from the earth will be about 141,
000,000 miles. Shortly after that it will
begin to recede, anu will then pass off
Into space. The comet will be nearest
to the sun on April 8. when it will be
about 99,000,000 mi.es away. About April
it will be at least 20 per cent brighter than
when it was first observed.
"The comet's plane of motion is inclined
to the plane of the earth's motion at an
angle of about 79 degrees, and intersects
it in longitude 271 degrees. The axis of
its motion points about 73 degrees east of
the intersection of the plane of its mo
tion and that of the earth."
A Noted Visitor.
BERKELEY, March 25. â Professor
Hans Wolisch, a noted German scientist
and professor of botany at the University
of Prague, Bohemia, was a visitor at the
university to-day. Professor Wolisch Is
on his return from a trip around the
world, having just come from the great
botanical gardens of Buknzorg. Java. He
left Berkeley this evening for the East
and home.
HER EASTER HAT.
How My Lady of San Francisco Will Eclipse Her
Sisters of Less Fortunate Cities.
"Tlhe Shepherdess" and Other Charm ing Creations
Which Will Captivate the World of Esthetic
Spring Worshipers.
Never before have the artists of Parisâ the conceded birthplace of all that Is dainty in millineryâ shown more ex
quisite taste in designing or greater skill in executing than in this season, year of our Lord, 1898.
The prime characteristic of this season's Easter bonnet is softness and flexibility, the whole air being decidedly
ethereal.
To produce this effect straws are used, the favorite being Mazzuolo and a large variety of chiffons, dotted nets and
mousscline francaise.
Black and white are used on some very stylish hats, but the favorite colors are turquoise blue and the yellows,
shading from pallle to the deep cogue de roche.
Tips and ostrich plumes are seen in some exquisite shadings and give promise of being used more as the season ad
vances, but at present flowers reign supreme, all others giving place to their regal queen, the rose. And they are all
there, the modest little tea, the half-opened Jaqueminot, the stately American Beauty, the old-fashioned June, disclosing
its yellow heart, and even the rose mourante, or dying rose, with its faded petals just ready to drop. The artists, not
being content with the most perfect simulation, have used the real rose stems with their very real thorns to uphold the
beautiful blossoms.
Hats are large, decidedly large, and the favorite shape is La Bergere, the shepherdess, worn by the Empress Jose
phine a century ago, in fact many of the styles are revivals of the eighteenth century, but plaques and toques
have not entirely surrendered the field. One chic little plaque was of fancy braid shading from corail to deep pourpre.
caught up high in the back and worn to dip well over the eyes. It was trimmed with two- Immense shirred rosettes, red
poppy buds and oats on the left side and in the back.
The "'Shepherdess" is a low-crowned, broad-brimmed hat, in chip or leghorn, drooping low In the front and back
with a high upward roll of the brim on either side.
A dashing one. if such a term can be applied to any thing so modost as a shepherdess, is of white leghorn,
covered with white net dotted with black. The net is drawn very full over both upper and under side of the brim,
and also covers the crown. Enormous bows of straw color and cogue de roche ribbon are set An the left front, the loops
standing over the brim to the edge. Two black ostrich plumes are fastened at the left, drooping down and back. Bunches
of black violets fasten long ties of the net that are to be carried loosely under the chin and caught at the left side with
crushed pink roses. The flat effect of this hat reminds one of the demure maids whose faces are seen in old-time minia
tures.
This "dream of a hat" Is almost overshadowed by a "midnight dream," one wholly of black. It is made of craq^jle
tulle, shirred full over a narrow rim slightly upturned from the face. The crown is large and bouffant, the sole trim
ming a bunch of black ostrich feathers caught at the left by a large rhine stone buckle. One plume droops across the
front and off at the right side, being followed the entire length of the stem by a fancy aria in rhine stones.
A "midsummer night's dream" is in direct antithesis, being of white crepe, large and flaring with long plumes of
white ostrich, bows of wide crepe ribbon and ties of the same. Ornaments of pearl are used, and the fair maiden
who looks out from under that creation may possess her soul in peace, confident that a dearer "love of a bonnet"
cannot be met with. ,
The hat to be worn by Miss Cluff on Easter morning is a veritable flower hat. It is a creamy white leghorn, the
wide capeline brim half faced with emerald-green velvet, the high crown draped with taffeta ribbon shading from
nymph-rose pink to vert green. It is caught high on the left side and massed with silk American Beauty roses, with
La France roses next the hair. Rhine stone ornaments hold the ribbon and sprays in place.
Miss Corlnne Josephi's carriage hat is of Imported Tuscany braid, violet and white, the brim faced with shirred
white chiffon. It also is caught up at the left side back, a bow of turquoise silk ribbon nestling against the white chif
fon. The brim Is completely hidden by violets, white and purple, which peep coquettlshly through the meshes of a
black Chantllly scarf carried around the crown in a festoon which is caught at the back by a handsome turquoise
buckle and then allowed to fall gracefully in long ends. Black and white nodding plumes give the high effect so much
sought.
Miss Patton's walking hat is a deft modification of "the shepherdess" in fine black chip. Blue corn flowers He
closely together over a roll of green velvet around the entire rim. giving the combination of blue and green so slow to
be relinquished by the aesthetic. Long black feti quills, fastened with cut steel ornaments, stand at right angles from
the front. Plaited black chiffon is fulled around the edge of the crown and made In soft rosettes on each side of the
back under the brim. Rhine stone ornaments are used galore and come ir, many pretty fancies. Buckles, arias, violins,
harps, appear often In combinations of pearl. So generous have been our Paris designers that a lady, be she blonde or
brunette, dignified or coquettish, has but to contemplate the numerous styles and shades, exercise her good taste and
make her selection, happy with the consciousness that Bhe Is well "bonneted."

IN BIG LUCK
The New York Wreck
Is Likely to Prove a
Bonanza.
Driven Up the Beach, Where
the Work of Salving
Is Easy.
ThÂ» Operator Thinks He Sees Not
Less Than Twenty Thousand
In Sight.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
S)S Broadway. March 25.
J. Pantoskey, tfie local junk dealer, who \
bought the cargo of the big ship New ,
York as she lay wrecked at Halfmoon
Bay, came to Oakland to-day and is in a >
highly elated frame of mind. He sees his :
way nearly clear to realize a large for- ;
tune out of his investment.
The sum paid was $6800, and it is not |
impossible that three times this figure
and even more may be netted. The cargo \
was invoiced for $135,000 and is one of the ;
most valuable of general China ship
ments.
"The ship is now securely jammed in
about twelve feet of sand," said Pan
toekey to-day, "and there is no fear of j
her shifting. The way the swell strikes j
her helps her further up the beach and
at low water now you can walk to within
seventy-tive feet of the vessel.
"The storm that wrecked the Almy
does not seem to have done much, if any,
damage to the New York, which cvi- j
dently is a good stanch hull. The cargo
is not yet damaged to any great extent,
except in certain parts of the vessel, and
there are tiers and tiers of valuable ma
terial as good as new. We are working
away as fast as possible and I dv not
think the weather will interfere much I
with our plans.
"If everything goes along nicely, with
no serious interruptions it ought not to
be difficult to get $20,000 out of the wreck,
but of course the expenses of salvage are j
great."
Pantoskey's last big venture was the
purchase some years ago of the con- i
demned Government drydock at Mare Isl
and. He brought the mammoth affair to \
Oakland, broke it up and out of the tons j
of massive chains and numerous pon
toons he made a small fortune.
CERTAIN TO INTERVENE.
Professor Bacon Says the United '
States Will Put an End to Cu
ban Horrors.
BERKELhi, March 25.â Prof. Thomas !
R. Bacon lectured Thursday afternoon |
at the university on â¢"Liberty and Au- !
thonlty." In the course of his address j
he touched upon the attitude of the j
United States toward Cuba. He declared j
It to be certain that ie is the deliberate \
American Judgment that the United i
States should and will intervene in Cuba !
to put an end to the terrible condition of j
things at present existing in the island.
Professor Bacon spoke in part as fol- j
lows:
"As a rule the action of government is
professedly confined to seeking the good j
of its own subjects; sometimes, espe- |
cially under popular governments, it !
breaks through these limits, and is moved
by considerations of justice and mercy j
toward those who are outside its own j
borders. If the United States shall inter
vene in Cuba (which we trust God will ;
forbid) It will be because we cannot |
stand by and see another three hundred I
thousand helpless persons go down to the j
grave by the hard and doleful way of j
starvation, as three hundred thousand
have already gone, while we have it in
our power to save them. Every consid
eration which justified the French and
English fleets in blowing out of the water
the Turkish and Egyptian fleets in 1527
would justify our armed intervention in
the affairs of Spain and Cuba. The judg- ]
ment of enlightened man approves of the
battle of Navarino, and regards it as one
of the most splendid events in human
history. The judgment of enlightened
man would ultimately come to regard in
the same way the intervention of the
United States in Cuba provided they
show that their action has no other mo
tive than disinterested humamtv
The last few days have brought us to
a very grave crisis. The people of the
United States have shown through all the j
period of the Cuban rebellion a self-pos- ;
session with which the world has not
hitherto credited any democracy The
terrible evil of war has been justly ap
preciated and weighed. No touch of â¢'jin-
Koism" has stained the anxious calm with
which we have watched the course of ;
events. But these days have made cer- ,
tain that the administration and Con
gress thoroughly represent the deliberate
judgment of the people, that the awful
condition of things upon our own bor- .
ders beside which the much-talked-ot !
Armenian massacres are as v mere '
trifle must be put an end to and that we
must' do it. I think it now certain that
W6 are going to do it, 'peaceably Jt we
CÂ»n, forcibly if we must. 1

FORM PLATERS
FELL HEAVILY
Upsets in Profusion, for
Favorite Followers at
Ingleside.
Bradley's Traverser Beaten by
Both Morellito and Scar
borough.
O'Connor Downed a Nose by May W.
Veragua Turned Up Winner
at Odds of 2O to 1.
As though the racing game was not
hard enough to beat at all times under
the most favorable circumstances, the
track at Ingleslde is one day fast
enough tcr crack all kinds of records on
and the next harrowed up until a stake
horse cannot run a mile over it fast
enough to get warm. Under such cir
cumstances there is little wonderment
that the outside public has been buck
ing the horses in the face of adversity
the past few days. Yesterday a dyna
mite bomb exploded in the grand stand
would not have killed over thirty-three
people and the crowd in the betting
ring would have been considered a slim
one at the "dawg" races.
Bettors who followed form were light
enough to enter the feather-weight
ranks when the racing was all over.
Bonnie lone caused the first shock by
turning down the favorite Soscol in the
opening event, and later in exercises
Veragua came rolling in at odds of 20
to 1. Taluea and May W were the only
successful favorites.
The mile and a quarter run plainly
demonstrated that Traverser cannot be
rated back in the bunch, and then be
expected to come on at the end and
win. The chestnut colt was pitted
against Morellito and Scarborough, and
as usuaJ went to the post favorite.
Morellito having the benefit of Tod
Sloan in the saddle was well supported
by his stable connections at odds of 7
to 5. Scarborough was allowed to make
the pace to the stretch, where Thorpe
on the favorite cut loose. Sloan also
made his move with Morellito and won
in a gallop, covering the distance in the
slow time of 2:o9*Â£. The first choice
was beaten a head for the place.
Quite a collection of speed was
gathered together in the final five-fur
long sprint. The Corrigan entry, Gey
ser, was scratched, and May W then
received the nomination. The Calgary
wonder was plunged on by every, big
bettor on the track at the short price
of 4 to 5, and she played in big luck.
Managing to outbreak O'Connell and
Paul Grig-gs at the start, Tod Sloan
rated her nicely, and she just lasted
long enough to down the former a nose
in 1:01 fiat. Griggs was third, ten
lengths ahead of Eakins.
Dick Clawson had the pleasure of
getting beaten -on the extrenely warm
favorite, Soscol, in the opening six-fur
long sprint by Bonnie lone, a 10 to 1
shot. The latter struck the stretch in
front, but at the paddock looked to be
beaten by the favorite, but Conley on
the outsider outfinished Clawson, get
ting the decision by half a length.
Honenlohe, the second choice, was
third.
The "baby" race at three and a half
furlongs proved an easy thing: for the
3 to 5 favorite,- Toluca, ridden by Tod
Sloan. The Nomas filly headed Gold
Scratch and Ach in the run home, win
ning: hands down. Ach was led out for
the place, by Gold Scratch.
The Apache mare. Lena, with Sloan
up, was a prominent favorite for the
"THE CALL'S" RACING CHART.

The chestnut horse, Fort Augustus,
closed favorite in the betting in the

over a length by Lodestar, backed
down from 6t01t09 to 2. Mamie G,
after cutting out the pace, finished in
the show.
Tom Ryan's chestnut horse. Sir Dilke,
was made a 7 to 5 favorite for the

TRACK ITEMS.
After the poor showing made in his race
yesterday the Judges decided that If Sutton Is
a sulker his entry is not wanted in any future
races at the local track. The brother to Dlggs
was heavily played but appeared unable to
run a yard.
Dick Clawson on Soscol, the favorite for the
opening event, had the race won opposite the
I paddock, but grew gay In an effort to show
I Conley how to draw it fine and, caught nap
ping, was beaten out by the colored rider.
Tod Sloan again rode three winners. He
now has a large following which does nothing
I but back his mounts.
Donation has shown improved form of late
and received extensive backing to win the
I third race. He could not keep up the first
! part and, compelled to travel the overland
route, was beaten two heads on the wire.
There is considerable "kicking" among
horsemen at what they term Corrigan's high
handed way of running \nings in general at
Ingleside. Yesterday, so one well-known own
er said, ropes were stretched across the main
' track as is the usual style and owners were
1 compelled to work their horses over the in-
Fi.le track. Shortly l.efon? the noon hour Ed
I Corrigan brought out his horse. The Bachelor,
the ropes were removed 'and the horse was
sent two miles over the main track. The
! ropes were then stretched across the track
I again. If such things are allowed to continue
i racing will be a dead card ere two more sea
! sons have elapsed. Already several visiting
, Eastern horsemen are getting ready to say
farewell to the State with its muchly cracked
' up winter gameâ forever. No one-man game
for them. s;iy they.
' The gossip now traveling the rounds anent
the decision of the Board of Stewards of the
California Jockey Club rendered on Thursday
' night, when Harry Wise was ruled off the turf
for being implicated in the "ringing" of the
mare Mary Nance at Oakland track some
I weeks ago. Is to the effect that other rea
; sons contributed to the decision. Mr. Wise, it
! serrne. had speculated quite heavily on tho
â  races with the inevitable result, and owed a
I number of bookmakers "markers." His friends
; claim the layers of odds connected hi.s name
i with the job to work his expulsion from the
I turf.

THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1893.
THREW OUT HIS
DRUM AND FLAG
The Union Mission Army
on Hayes Street Dis
rupted.
Commander Moore Has the
Other Members Arrested in
Consequence.
They Will To-Day Prefer Charges
of Threats to Kill Against
Him.
Disruption has taken place In the
Union Mission Army, and where peace
reigned a day or two ago there is now
war, accompanied by revilings and
charges and counter charges.
The army was organized on January
3, with its headquarters at 114 Hayes
street. The original members were
Mrs. Sissie Davis, a dressmaker; her
husband, W. J. Davis, a painter, from
Sacramento, and A. W. Moore, who was
before coming here a member of God's
Regular Army in Portland, Or., of
which Mrs. Clark, the woman who was
arrested recently for cruelty to the lit
tle girl Alice Loy, was also a prominent
member. .
It was one of the rules of the army
that no one would take upon himself
or herself the title of commander, but
that all would stand equal and work
together for the common good.
Everything went along smoothly for
a time and Mrs. Davis provided Moore
with a drum and flag to help him in
his work of gathering in converts. This
was not an easy task and finally Mrs.
Davis presented Moore with a uniform.
Then Moore took on airs and arrogated
to himself the title erf commander. Mr.
and Mrs. Davis expostulated with him,
pointing out that he was violating the
rules, but it had no effect upon him,
so Wednesday morning the husband
and wife threw Moore's drum and flag
into the street and told him not to en
ter their house again.
Unfortunately there were no converts
to appeal to and Moore decided to ap
peal to the Police Courts. Yesterday
morning he swore to complaints in
Judge Low's court for the arrest of Mr.
and Mrs. Davis on the charge of dis
turbing the peace. They were arrested
and taken to the City Prison and much
sympathy was expressed by the neigh
bors for Mrs. Davis, as she is a cripple.
They were almost immediately bailed
out and hurried back to their home, as
they were afraid that Moore might take
possession during their incarceration
or do something worse.
Moore lives in a shack in the rear of
the Davis house and when Davis and
his wife got back, accompanied by At
torneys Rose and Harrington, whom
they had engaged to defend them, Da
vis called in some of the neighbors and
opening the rear window shouted to
Moore, who was standing at the door
of his shack: "In the presence of these
people and my attorneys T warn you,
Moore, never to enter my house again,
and I tell you that your connection
with our army is from henceforth at
an end." Moore did not make a reply.
Davis also accuses Moore of brutal
treatment toward his wife and with
threatening to kill them, and to-day he
will secure warrants for Moore's ar
rest on the charge of threats against
life.
When swearing out the warrants for
the arrest of Mr. and Mrs. Davis,
Moore was particularly anxious that
the press should not be notified, as
much injury had. he said, been done to
Christian organizations, such as Ood's
Regular Army and Jesus Christ's Army,
by the publication of their connection
with the little girl Alice Loy.
CRICKET PLAYERS
NOT ENTHUSIASTIC
There Is little doing among the cricket
ers just now. Only five or six members
of the Bohemian Club responded to the
call for a meeting:, and up to date the
club has failed to organize. This leaves
only two city clubs, the Alameda and the
Pacific, In the Cricket Association this
season; and it is impossible to arrange a
series of interesting matches between
two clubs. Lovers of cricket sincerely
hope that a third club may be formed,
but the prospects are not encouraging at
present.
The Golden Gate ground at Klinkner
ville is in excellent condition and the
proprietor promises to permit it to be
used free of charge if two matches a
month are guaranteed.
H. Morgan-Browne, an English barris
ter, has recently brought out a volume
of sporting and athletic records, in which
are noted many interesting and remark
able performances at cricket. In 18i>6 the
I'arsee batsman, K. S. Ranjitsinhji, made
2750 runs in 55 innings (not out seven
times}, or an average of 07.9 runs. In I
England vs. Australia matches Ranjit
sinnji played four innings (once not out)
and scored 235 runs, or an average of 78 33
runs per inning. His highest individual
scon; against the Australians was 154 i
During His career he has made 5381 runs !
in English first-class cricket, in 113 In- j
nings, aji average of 47 runs. When we i
observe that champion W. G. Grace's av
erage for 1124 completed innings is 41, and
that of A. Shrewsbury, who stands next
to "W. G.," is 33. we see what a splendid
batsman 'â¢Ranji" is.

FERRY DEPOT CONTRACTS FURNISH RICH BOOTY.
A Summary of Profits That Have Accrued to Some of the Men Who Have Found Favor
With the Honorable Gentlemen Who Have Misspent the State's Funds.
Changes Made to Promote
Easier Means of Fraud.
Plans and Specifications Ignored
Where Such Action Would
Aid the Scramble for
Plunder.
For a series of days the duty of call-
Ing attention to the manner of con-
struction employed in giving to the
gtate the ferry depot for which it had
voted a liberal appropriation, has oc-
cupied some space and attention,
Neither has been wasted. Charges that
public money was being squandered,
that contractors with the connivance
of the Harbor Commissioners had been
lining their pockets, that the completed
structure will be a sham, a monument
'to shameless fraud, have been fully
established.
It is fair to say that the first cvi-
dence of crookedness, leading to a
studied and unbiased investigation, only
gave an inkling of the whole truth,
Every clew followed has led directly
to some abuse of the confidence re-
posed in the Commissioners. Little
wonder that taxpayers are indignant
and that the cornered rogues are try-
ing to shift responsibility, and raise a
storm of protest behind which they
may hide. Not only have they been
caught and exposed, but they have
been clearly proved guilty of acts which
seem to have all the color of crime. As
to this point there is a duly consti-
tuted body upon which the task of final
determination must fall. Reference is
had to the Grand Jury.
To the eye the depot presents an as-
pect imposing and almost noble. It
stands as a gateway through which all
traffic between San Francisco and the
East must pass. Naturally it is the
first tangible shape upon which the
gaze of the traveler rests, and in leav-
ing the city it is the last thing, save
the lights and the outlined hills, to be
seen. As a commercial focus it was
deemed that it should be of grand
proportions, of the best material and of
the finest workmanship. It has these
proportions; nothing more. From the
foundation to the highest stone in the
tower the structure is a cheat. In
every department of construction so
far as yet looked into, there has been
the practice of fraud, open, shameless,
palpable. Denial is worse than use-
less. So long had the wrongding pro-
gressed undetected that the wrongdoers
had grown bold. They looted in fan-
cied security, and now their golden
dreams have been rudely dissipated,
But they have the gold.
There seems to have been from the
first an implied understanding that a
contractor undertaking to do certain
â work at a price utterly ruinous to him-
self, provided specifications be fol-
lowed, had nothing to fear. It was to
be his privilege not only to throw
specifications to the wind but to have
a new set devised to BUit. In this man-
ncr bidders were enabled to substitute
cheap for expensive material, bad for
good workmanship, cut out such work
as they did not wish to perform, and in
the end send in a bill for "extras." A
bill of this kind represented oftentimes
an entirely fictitious outlay on the part
of the contractor. In other words,
when his friends of the Harbor Com-
mission allowed him to make such
changes as he could well have afforded
to acknowledge by a healthy reduction
from his bill, they also allowed him to
I chaxge for these changes as though
they had been an expense to him in
stead of an actual gain. Just what be
: came of this gratuity is not precisely
j known. Perhaps the Commissioners
j could be induced to lend a little light.
If the contractors were permitted to
keep it all then indeed is the generosity
\of the commission a thing past all
j comprehension. The initial swindle
j searched out relates to the stone. The
\ Pacific Bridge Company, which, so far
as this edifice is concerned, seems to
i consist of James McCarthy, had the
; contract at a figure mentioned in de-
I tail elsewhere. It was instructed to
put in stone which cost $11,000 less, but
it was paid at the original figure. The
Impression was sought to be sent
' broadcast that in accepting this gift
McCarthy was a benefactor. President
Colnon of the commission gave to this
! impression all the currency he could,
; and in an unintelligible way still de
fends it, when not engaged in defend
ing some other job equally audacious,
In the grand nave the same favored
contractor was told to put in marble
for the glazed brick he had agreed to
put in, the brick, according to every
i other bidder, being more costly. He
! was also given the privilege of sub
| stituting in the exterior end walls
; common brick worth $6 per 1000 for
, Roman pressed brick, which would
! have cost $75. He put in a floor so much
j less expensive than the one he had
i agreed to put in as to save him many
j thousands. And how much did the
: State save? Not a cent. The State
; paid McCarthy more for his cheap
j work than it had stipulated to pay for
the good work planned, and in the in
scrutable wisdom of the Commission
cast aside.
! The interior finish was to have been
j finished in oak and on this basis bids
j Were made and the contract let. Bate
man Bros, got it. They concluded they
| woui(j rather put in pine, worth about
j a quarter as much as oak. A few parti
were added, but more were cut
out Qne entire story it was decided to
]cave untouched. And the reduction?
Not a cent. The contractors had the
nerve to ask for an increase of pay,
and the archltect had the nerve to rec
j ommend it. The Commission was not
j t0 be outdone in nerve. It sanctioned the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 2(5, 1898.
I the Commissioners likely Beem a Bet of
I haloed philanthropists.
It is impossible to even mention here
I the various confidence games which
have been praticed. Seemingly there
is no end to them, except as there is a
limit to the number of contracts. Ma
sonry, wood work, iron work, steam
heating, plumbing, as well as minor
matters, each represent a distinctly
fraudulent transaction of which the
State has been the victim, and to which
the Commissioners, whose names adorn
the corner-stone of the ferry building,
have freely given or sold the boon of
official sanction.
RICH PLUMS FOR THE PLUMBER.
Experts Pronounce the Work as Com
pleted Worse Than Worthless.
While not so large in the matter of
dollars and cents as some of the other
contracts for work on the ferry build
ing, the contract for plumbing and gas
fitting has proved equally as remuner
ative as others in the matter of illegiti
mate profits.
As in other cases, this contract has
been turned into a bonanza by means
of numerous changes and omissions in
the original plans and specifications,
authorized by or acquiesced in by the
Board of Harbor Commissioners. It is
also apparent that the contractor has,
on his own motion, used inferior mate
rial and workmanship, though all of
the work has ostensibly been done un
der the eye of one or more agents of
the board and has been accepted and
paid for. The work as it stands in its
completed state, according to the pub
lished statement of Chief Plumbing
Inspector J. J. Sullivan of the Board of
Health, should be condemned as a
menace to public health. According to
this same official, who is a recognized
authority on such subjects, all of the
plumbing in the building will have to
be taken out within a year or two, as

it is utterly worthless for the purpose
for which it was intended.
A few days ago Thomas J. Ford, a
well-known expert on plumbing, was
commissioned by The Call to compare
the work as constructed with the plans
and specifications under which thecon
tract was let. His report shows that
the many changes that have been in
augurated and permitted have been
put into effect at a cost to the State of
an adequate plumbing system for a
very costly building, and at a profit to
the contractor of many thousands of
dollars.
The principal defect in the system of
plumbing as it now stands is the qual
ity of material used in the piping. The
original specifications called for cast
iron pipe. The kind that has been
used is wrought iron. Careful esti
mates show the saving of time, labor
and material due to this change to rep
resent a net cash saving to the con
tractor of $925. Instead of deducting
this amount from the amount of his
contract price when the change was
made, the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners paid the contractor $2063 extra
for doing the work. This meant a net
saving to the contractor on this one
item of almost $3000.
Another important provision In the
specifications that has been disregard
ed is that relating to vent pipes. The
specifications, as well as the regula
tions, of the Board of Health state
that all vent pipes must run through
the roof, and that none of the pipes
shall be of less diameter than four
inches. In the work as completed
many of the vent pipes do not run to
the roof and those that do are none of
them of greater diameter than two
inches. On this item of construction
the contractor saved $325.
In the fitting up of the numerous
wash basins in the building the mar
ble slabs, safes and slats called for in
the specifications have been omitted at
a saving to the contractor of $1124.
More than $1000 worth of closets have
been left out where called for, and
those that have been put in are of an
other and cheaper make than those
originally called for. Extras amount
ing to more than $5000 have been au
thorized and paid for by the Commis
sioners. In one instance the masonry
contractor was paid $1492 for doing
work included in the plumber's con
tract.
COLNON'S COSTLY SUGGESTION,
Paid a Good Price for a Pavement and
Gave Some "Boot."
A costly suggestion that is laid at
the door of Commissioner Colnon is
the substitution of artificial stone pave
ment for the bitumen originally laid
on the floor of the new ferry building.
The bituminous rock that fell under
the ban of Mr. Colnon's disapproval
was laid some time ago by the Pacific
Paving Company at a cost to the State
of 9% cents a square foot. The thick
ness of the bitumen as laid was 2%
inches. After Commissioner Colnon
had decided that a change must be
made from bitumen to artificial stone,
the City Street Improvement Company
sent in the following proposal:
"We hereby propose to pave the exits
in the new ferry building, aggregating
approximately 5125 square feet, with a
1% inch layer of Santa Cruz bitu
minous rock upon a one-inch binder
course of concrete (cement to be fur
nished by the board) for 7Vi cents a
square foot, with the understanding
that the bituminous rock now covering
the passenger waiting-room, aggregat
ing an area of 10,080 square feet, shall
belong to us after we have taken up
and removed the same."
The 2^ inches of bitumen covering
the 10,080 square feet of floor space has
been "taken up and removed." The
new work has not yet been begun. The
bargain that was made by the City
Street Improvement Company can be
seen at a glance. The State furnishes
the materials and gives them 7^4 cents
a square foot for putting down the
bitumen, and then makes them a pres
ent of enough bitumen to cover 7500
square feet of space to the depth of a
little more than an inch. In other
words, the firm gets more than ample
pay for doing the work and then gets
enough "boot" to make the job com
pare favorably with other "sugges
tions" that have emanated from the
same source.
DOORS THAT COST BIG MONEY.
One Firm Allowed to Make $4000 Without
Doing Any Work.
According to the original plans and
specifications, the doors for the various
exits and entrances to the ferry build
ing were to be constructed of the best
steel, besides being fitted with proper
counterweights and other necessary
fittings. The contract for' doing the
work was let to the Risdon Iron Works,
the price not being named, as the item
was included in the blanket bid for all
of the structural ironwork in the build
ing.
The Risdon Iron Works do not con
struct doors of this character, and in
order to make a proper estimate of the
cost so that they could include the
amount in the sum total of their bid,
the firm asked for estimates from con
tractors who made a specialty of this
kind of work. By this means it was
ascertained that the cost of the doors
would be about $8000.
After the contract had been let, th<*
Harbor Commissioners, for reasons of
their own, concluded to change the
style of the doors from steel to wood.
Satisfactory plans were submitted to
Edward B. Hinds of 411 Mission streeet,
and he was finally awarded the con
tract for furnishing the new style doors
for $5570. Negotiations were then
opened with the Risdon Iron Works,
with the result that the firm was re
leased from the necessity of carrying
out that part of their contract relating
to doors. In consideration of this re
lease, the firm consented to deduct $4000
from the total amount of their contract
price for all iron work. This was
agreed to.
By entering into this agreement, the
Harbor Commissioners allowed the
Risdon Iron Works to make a net profit
of about $4000. This being so, the wood
en doors for which Hinds was paid
$r>ii7o represent a cost to the State of
$9570, considerably more than steel
doors would have cost the Risdon Iron
Works at first hand.

GALVANIZED IRON CONTRACT,
Much Profit Results From Changes, Eva
sions and' Substitutions.
The contract for doing the ropflng
and galvanized iron work on the ferry
building was let to William Cronan for
the specified sum of $43,599. Up to the
present time he has been paid some
thing more than $10,000 for extra work
at prices that allowed him to make
from 50 to 300 per cent profit on the
amount of money expended. In every
instance where he was granted author
ity for doing extra work the amounts
involved were a little less than $3000.
This enabled the Board of Harbor
Commissioners to have the work done
without the necessity of advertising for
bids, as is required by law where the
amount involved is more than $3000.
In all of the cases where extra work
was ordered on this conti .rt the esti
mates of the contractor were approved
by Architect Swain and Commissisoner
Colnon and his associates.
From time to time the original plans
and specifications under which the con
tract was let were so changed as to
permit the contractor to substitute in
ferior workmanship and materials at
a great saving to himself. The in
stances where these changes were
made and permitted are numerous and
resulted in an aggregate saving to the
contractor of considerably more than
$10,000. One of the most striking in
stances of this nature was in the man
ner in which the galvanized iron was
put on the inside and outside walls of
the rear gallery, running the entire
length of the building, and also on the
inner walls of the wating room on the
first floor.
The specifications under which the
contract was awarded specifically re
quire that the galvanized iron cover
ing of these walls shall be put on with
flush joints, the edges being riveted to
a heavy fish-plate and the whole fast
ened to the iron framework of the
building with galvanized iron clips. In
stead of doing this the contractor ig
nored the requirements of the specifi
cations altogether. He lapped the edge
of one sheet of iron over the edge of the
sheet above it and nailed them to the
wall as a farmer would nail shakes on
a barn. The finished surface presents
a rough and unsightly appearance.
As a result of his evasion of this pro
vision In the specifications the contrac
tor effected a saving to himself of be
tween $5000 and $8000. The completed
work as it now stands will become loose
in a short time on account of the draw
ing of the nails by reason of contrac
tion and expansion from heat and cold,
and the entire covering of the walls will
have to be removed.
The specifications also call for the
covering of all of the walls of the gal
lery and waiting room with galvanized
iron. After the contract had been let
and the work was under way the con
tractor claimed that he was not re
quired to cover the west walls of the
gallery and waiting room. After be
coming hesitation the members of the
Board of Harbor Commissioners and
Architect Swain claimed to- see the
force of Contractor Cronan's reasoning
and granted him $2978 for doing the
work he had already been paid to do.
Besides the things before enumerated
Cronan was permitted to fit the build
ing with fixed instead of movable
louvres, was allowed to- omit the hy
draulic device for opening and closing
same, was paid an exorbitant price for
fitting open and closed windows in gal
leries leading to the ferry slips, and on
the entire contract was allowed to sub
stitute a lisht iron for the heavy qual
ity specified by his contract, the latter
item effecting a saving to the contrac
tor of 52261.
SMALL CONTRACT-BIG PROFIT,
Price Paid for the Big Heating Plant Out
of All Just Proportion,
Of the many jobs perpetrated in
connection with the ferry depot con
tracts, that which was successfully
carried out in the installation of the
steam-heating plant is the most con
spicuous in proportion to the amount
of money involved. The contract price
for putting in the piping system was
$5200. The amount saved by the con
tractors over and above a legitimate
profit is estimated at $3430.
It was generally understood among
those contractors who put in bids for
the work that the specifications had
been prepared by the firm that ulti
mately secured the contract at a figure
far below all competitors. The con
tract was awarded to the firm of W.
W. Montague & Co. The specifications
called for a low pressure, single-pipe
system for all -of the floors except the
ground floor, which was to be fitted
with the double-pipe system. The w 7 ork
as completed shows that the two-pipe
system on the ground floor has been
entirely omitted and that a single-pipe
system has been put in instead.
The specifications also provide that
all pipes throughout shall be covered
with magnesia sectional pipe covering.
The completed work shows that all the
return pipes buried in the floor are de
void of covering, being simply laid in
trenches, no regard having been paid
to the covering clause. On this item
the contractors effected a saving to
themselves of about $1000.
Perhaps the most glaring fraud in
connection with this contract is shown
in the trenches made for the recep
tion of the return pipes. These
trenches, instead of being cut large
enough for the reception of the pipe
with pipe covering on it, and graded
toward the receiving tank, have been
cut barely large enough in width to
receive the pipe, and of a uniform
depth just sufficient to allow for a thin
covering over the trenches. The heavy,
ribbed cast-iron covers called for by
the specifications have been omitted
altogether. The saving to the con
tractor in the cutting of the trenches
in the concrete floor and the omission
of the cast-iron covers amounts to
about $2430.
The same firm was granted the con
tract for furnishing and setting the
radiators throughout the building for
the sum of $2927. The cost of the work,
when figured at retail prices, thus al
lowing a jobber's profit to the contrac
tor, is but $2422. As the contract was

let by the Board of Harbor Commis- |
sioners without competition, it will be

BATEMAN BROS IN CLOVER.
Commissioners to Them as Pliant as Clay
in the Hands of the Potter.
Bateman Bros, could well afford to
sing a paean of praise to the Harbor j
Commissioners, for by the acts of those !
distinguished gentlemen have their
yawning pockets been lined for work
never performed. These contractors, as
others, have basked in a profitable glow j
of favoritism. Of this the most recent i
example concerns the laying of certain i
pine flooring. The Batemans have been j
given the c ntract at $1868. Any com- |
petent contractor would have been glad ;
to get it at $467. These floors are for :
various offices, embracing an area of |
11,676 feet. Such floor can be profitably
laid at 3M> cents. At 4 cents it would be
regarded as a good thing. At the lat
ter figure it would come to a total of
$467 04. The Batemans are to get 16 j
cents, or a total of $1868 16. The re- j
suit that for their benefit the State is |
to be put to a direct loss of $1401 12 is j
easily determined but hard to explain.
The change from oak to pine finish !
reeks with every evidence of rascality.
For this change, a gift in token of
which the contractors could well have
afforded to present the State a substan
tial rebate, they received an allowance
of $2995 extra. Architect Swain coun
seled the Commission to this peculiar
course. He may know the reason, but I
searchers after the truth have sought
vainly the shadow of a legitimate one.
Swain figured that the revised plan
called for 71S1 feet of pine partitions
12 feet in height, for which he al
lowed the contractors $3 per lineal foot.
ITnder the work called for by the orig
inal plans he enumerates 3244 feet on
the first and second floors. But what
of the abandoned mezzanine which had
been figured upon in the bidding? And
he figured the oak at $4 20 per lineal
foot, when pine was selling in open
market at $20 per thousand feet, and
oak at $120 per thousand feet. Here is j
enough to arouse a spirit of inquiry. |
Why is all mention of mezzanine par
titions omitted from the estimate made
by Swain? The difference between
what the architect conceived to be the
value of the oak and the pine was
$3821 70, of course in favor of the con
tractors. As an award of this amount
could not have been made legally with
out calling for new bids the contractors
knocked off $828 70. Very good of them,
too. A summary of this strange pro
cedure shows that the State paid high
for the privilege of acquiring a cheap
wood in place of an expensive one.
Bateman Bros, have been granted al
most $10,000 for extras. A sample job
will sufficiently exploit the method.
There were to have been six floors in
the tower. The commission decided
to leave them out and asked the Bate
mans to make a corresponding reduc
tion. The contractors were willing to
relinquish $119 and this concession was
satisfactorily. Afterward it was de
cided to put in one of these floors and
for that floor alone the Batemans got
$310. There seems no necessity for
comment. Swain admits the part he
took in it all, and repels what he terms
an effort to make him out either a fodk
or a knave.

M'CARTHY's HYPNOTIC GLANCE,
Various Crooked and Profitable Jobs in
the Masonry Contract.
James McCarthy is one of the con
tractors whose hypnotic eye the Har
bor Commissioners have been induced
to loot the State. He procured the con
tract for all the masonry work in the
Ferry depot. This, of course, included
as a considerable item the exterior
walls, which were to have been of Ore
gon graystone. Many others , made
bids, and the relative cost of the various
stones proposed became well known
among the members of the craft. The
cost of the Oregon product would have
been to McCarthy or any of his com
petitors $11,000 more than the cost of
Colusa sandstone. Yet, after the con
tract had been let, there was a change
in material, the Colusa article being
adopted. McCarthy was not even
asked to share with the State this un
expected profit. There . was no reduc
tion made, and, so far as known, none
proposed.
But ' the McCarthy cup of joy was
destined to be filled to the brim. He
had agreed to supply for the interior
large quantities of terra cotta. His bid
had been 12 cents a square foot, his
lowest competitor having bid 22 cents.
Contractors affirm that he could only
have lived up to the original terms at
serious loss. To his rescue flew the
Commissioners. They abolished the
terra cotta. For the white, glazed brick
which had been designed to make the
grand nave a place of beauty they sub
stituted marble.
For Roman pressed brick at the ex
terior ends, worth $75 a thousand, they
substituted common brick worth $6 a
thousand. For the floor to be support
ed by arched tiling they substituted
expanded metal. All these changes
were for McCarthy's benefit, and yet,
as if to flaunt their boldness in the
face of the public, the Commissioners
actually voted him $2416 extra. The
changes in the finish of the nave
meant to the contractor a gain of $13.
893. The omission of terra cotta caps,
plinths, bases and string courses was
$3345 more to his advantage, while the
alteration in the floor alone was at
least an additional $12,000. V/-
But this was not all. So liberal had
the Commissioners been in scattering
among the contractors pay for bogus
extras that danger appeared of the
money running short. This was pecu
liar, as the appropriation had been am
ple, and something had. to be done.
Happy thought! Omit the mezza
nine ( story. It was so ordered. This
story was to have contained thirty-five
rooms, with terra cotta partitions. Mc-
Carthy was not in favor of supplying
it, although he had taken obligations
to do so. In round numbers this was
worth to him about $7000. Whatever
impulse of gratitude he may have felt
did not take the form of making resti
tution to the State.
And this masonry contract is the one
in which Colnon boasts of having saved
to the people the sum of $53,000. How?
Where is it?
